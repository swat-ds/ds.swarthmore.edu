<a  class="button button-red" href="https://forms.gle/BjjTWp6kAAeLVbxBA" target="_blank">Apply for Fall '20</a>

Interested in collaborative projects that span disciplinary boundaries, that bring networked technologies to bear on conventional scholarship, that demand a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital"?

The Libraries are now accepting applications for digital scholarship opportunity for the fall semester. Accepted students will receive [level 3 student employment](http://www.swarthmore.edu/student-employment) for one semester to engage in theory and practice of digital scholarship and to collaborate on projects already in the works.

### What do Fellows do?

Now in its fifth year, the LibLab Fellows can expect a combination of open lab hours and weekly meetings, through which Fellows will be exposed to:

- Web development and design, plus digital media, text analysis, and/or data visualization depending on time/interests
- Current conversations around digital environments from a variety of perspectives
- Experience with project management, design thinking and tools for collaboration
- Self-directed research culminating in a digital project

For an idea of some of what we cover, [visit last fall's syllabus available online](https://swat-ds.github.io/liblab/).

### How much of a commitment will it be?

Fellows will be expected to contribute an average of 6 hours a week, including discussions and lab meetings. Students can expect to pursue individual projects using tools and concepts we cover. In the spring semester, Fellows have the option of continuing on and contributing to ongoing library-supported digital projects.

### Who should apply?

You! While priority will be given to Sophomores and Juniors, the application is open to all current students, all majors. No background in computer science or web development is necessary, though students who get the most out of the experience tend to answer yes to the following:

- Do you feel proficient with any OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)?
- Do you feel comfortable learning new software and web interfaces on your own?
- When tech problems come up, do you feel confident--maybe even *curious*--about finding solutions?
- Do you feel comfortable writing and speaking about pressing, complex issues for diverse audiences?

Any experience with the command line or with HTML/CSS is helpful but not required.
