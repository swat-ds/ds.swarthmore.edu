could "give other instances of even more
extreme contractual restrictions demanded by the holders of such copyrights—which stand in practice."
After a meeting with members of the
cast, Svoboda decided that the intent of
putting on the show was to have fun. not
to make a political statement.
Svoboda and his associates are now
working on alternatives to "A Chorus
Line." They are considering alternatives
such as "Pippen" and "The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas'.
The cast of "A Chorus Line" has been
assured they will still have a part in
whatever show is decided upon, even if
that means double-casting the principals
since "A Chorus Line" has more principal roles than almost any other show.
"We are excitedabout theprogress we
are making in formulating a new policy,"
Svoboda said. He hopes that, "we will
take the stress from the show and turn it
into something positive." No matter what
happens with the legal ramifications of
"A Chorus Line," there is sure to be a
musical put on this spring by a cast and
crew that have gone through more stress
and hard work than any typical production.

In January of this year, a few AfricanAmerican students formed an a capella
group which they called "Black Coffee."
In the first week of November, the group
submitted a charter proposal to the Student Council Charter Committee in the
hope of becoming an officially recognized group ofSwarthmore College. The
chartering process is usually completed
within two weeks; however. Black Coffee is still awaiting a decision.
There was one problematic line in
Black Coffee's charter proposal that is
holding up the decision: "We wish
t0... highlight the culture and experience
of African American people through the

music we perform." Itis expressly stated
by the Student Council that a charter
must contain a statement ofnondiscrimination based on sex, race, color, age,
religion, national origin, sexual preference, or handicap. Black Coffee did not,
and would not, fulfill that requirement.
Tanya Wiggins '96 is adamant that
Black Coffee should be officially recognized as an African-American group. She
said, "We wantnot only black sound, we
want to represent ourselves as black
people."
TheStudent Councilrules allow groups
to discriminate only if they call themselves a support group in their charters.
S.A.S.S.- Swarthmore African-American
Students Society- is already the char-

tered African-American support group
and Black Coffee does not want to become a subset of S.A.S.S. because it
believes it is very different and has different objectives.
The StudentCouncil is now faced with
the challenge of solving this problem
fairly. The administrationhas asked it to
wait untilnext semester to make its decision. Meanwhile, research is being done
into the legal implications of the matter.
The StudentCouncil also held a meeting
on December 6th entitled, "Should a
capella groups be allowed to discriminate on things other than talent?" in an
attempt to get feedback from the college
community.
Thus far, Student Council is consider-

ing creating a third category (in addition
and nonsupport groups) that
would allow the groups in that category
to discriminate on style and representato support

tion.

A suggestion was also made to have
all a capella groups unchartered, but this
was quickly disregarded because the a
capella groups want to have the right to
officially represent Swarthmore College
when they sing elsewhere in order to give
the school the recognition it deserves.
At the start of next semester, in January 1996,the issue will be examined even
further and a decision will finally be
made on whether or not Black Coffee
will receive the charter they are applying
for.

The game room now contains actual

last time S warthmore defeated Lafayette

in basketball until Wednesday night. The
trip to Easton, Pennsylvania was one of
the shorter trips on a monstrous six game
road swing and proved to be the most
satisfying to date.
To place the victory in perspective,
one must understand that NCAA Division 111 programs are rarely competitive
with Division I programs. Scholarships
and facilities are just two of the advantages for the latter. When Coach Lee
Wimberly walked into his modest office
Thursday morning, he had voice and Email messages from around the country.
Representatives of the UniversityofPennsylvania, Yale, Notre Dame, Williams,
Pomona, Haverford, a Philadelphiaradio
station (610 am), and dozens of alumni
were among the well-wishers.
The accomplishment is not the sole
thing to be put in perspective. The players performance as a team and, for many,
as individuals was remarkable. The Garnet defense held Lafayette to a feeble
37% overall shooting percentage and 10%
on three-point attempts.
The starting lineup for Lafayette towered over their S warthmore counterparts
at 6*ll. 6*7, 6'6, 6'5, and s*ll. The
Garnet have one player on their roster
over 6'5. Lafayette's shortest starter, a
S'll guard, is also their star. He scored
27 points in a winning effort last season
but was held to only eight by Swarthmore
counterpart Craig Rodner "96.
"We did a lot of good things [Wednesday] night. We were under intense manto-man pressure, but we didn't let them
intimidate us into making dumb turnovers," Wimberly said. Both teams committed only 12 turnovers and had seven
steals.
Wimberly devised a masterful game
plan that his team followed almost flawlessly. In layman's terms, the defense
looked to isolate and prevent two key
perimeter shooters from getting open
shots by double teaming them. The plan
was to tempt the less effective shooters
*

into taking shots.

College Selects Honorary
Degree Nominees
By Erik Huneke
The Honorary Degree Candidate Selection Committeerecently selected hon-

orary degree candidates for Commencement 1996, although their names are not
to be released until early May.
Harry Gotwals, Vice President for
Alumni, Development, and Public Relations, who serves on the committee along
with President Al Bloom, members of
the faculty, and representatives from the
Board of Managers, notes that the committeewaits torelease the names both out
of custom and out of the need to "[clarify]
information with the candidates."Nominations are accepted all year long, but are
particularly solicited through a public
request in the Weekly News in October. In
the past, the committee issued individual
requests to seniors, but Gotwals said,
"the response was no different than only
putting in the Weekly News."
Usually, the committee deals with
thirty to forty nominations every year.
Gotwals estimated that 60-70% of these
nominations come from faculty members, 20-23% from alumni including
Board members, 5-10% from students,
and the remainder from staff members.
Members of the committee can choose to
reconsider nominations from previous
years.
Although Gotwals noted that "the responsibility for awarding degrees—honorary or otherwise—is the faculty's, with
final approval by the Board," he acknowledged that "at other colleges there is a
committee which selects the speakers at
Commencement" Aside from a member
of the senior class, the honorary degree
recipients are the only speakers at Commencement.

At Swarthmore, the senior class officers coordinate the election of the student
Commencement speaker and the Last
Collection speaker for the Sunday afternoon preceding Commencement.

Students who consulted with their advisors in thePolitical Science, Sociology
/ Anthropology, or History departments
before registering may have noticed a
certain disarray. All three departments
currently have their faculty offices in
Trotter, but now all three departments are
expected to move out of Trotter by the
end of the semester so that it can be
prepared for renovation.

Gotwals also invites class officers to submit nominations for Baccalaureate
speaker, although the President, in consultation with Dean Ngina Lythcott, is
responsible for the final selection.
Gotwals felt that student involvement
in this committee would not be productive because "you can't let out before
everybody who thecandidates are. ..There
would be no way that two students [on
the committee] could say [to fellow students], 'What do you think?'" Gotwals
said that senior class officers "usually
ask me" how previous classes have done
it, but during the past six years that
Gotwals has been involved in the process, officers have generally "chosen not
to change anything." He feels that the
current system is the "fair and more appropriate way of doing" it because the
option of nominating candidateshasbeen
open to students.
The committee uses a variety of criteria in selecting degree candidates from
the nominations. In weighing nominations, the considers "distinction, leadership, or originality in a significant field
of human endeavor" to be most important, according to the "Honorary Degrees: Purposes, Policies, and Procedures" document from the Office of the
Vice President. The individuals chosen
are also expected to serve as role models
or sources of inspiration for the graduates. The College makes an attempt to
achieve a balance of alumni, friends,
Quakers, local residents, women, and
members ofracial minority groups. The
committee also prefers not to have too

table, and additional money for the accessories for the ping pong and pool
tables.
"It took us awhile to get were we are,"
Harvey added. "What we have to do now
is deal with the more physical aspects of
the space."
Planned expenditures include a stereo
system or jukebox for music; probably a
juke box because of security problems
with a stereo system. Renovators are also
considering improving the current lighting, carpeting the general room, installing more plush carpeting in the TV room,
commissioning a mural to be positioned
on the wall currently adorned with crude
art from a variety of students, and putting

new benches in the west end of the larger
room.
Part of the reason the game room has
falleninto such disrepair is because much
of the equipment was stolen over the
summer. In order to prevent this happening again, new locks were installed on
the doors thathold the board games and
supplies. Desk-sitters have also been
instructed to request and hold Swarthmore ID's from any students wishing to
use the pool or ping pong accessories or
any other games.
There are also video games and a
change machine in a smaller room. Mortal Kombat 3, Street Fighter 11,and a pair
of pinball games are available for 50
cents a game. The game room is open
from noon to midnight seven days a week.

Dozens of newspapers across the nation from The Sacramento Bee to The
New YorkTimes picked up the story and
provoked still more outraged responses.
The criticism continuedwhen University
Judicial Administrator (J.A.) Barbara
Krause J.D. 'B6 investigated the issue
and then decided not to charge the student authors of the list.
Cornell administratorshave since been
rebuked from all sides, reaping criticism
not only from women's rights activists
for not doing enough, but from freespeech advocates for interfering at all.
The American Civil Liberties Union
and the National Writers Union have
written letters to Krause questioning the
University's handling of the incident.
A Web page called "Justice on Campus" has compiled a lengthy collection of
responses to dieCornell incident Justice
on Campus is an informal, on-line collaboration of people concerned with defending free speech on campuses.
Several respondents to the Web page
suggested that the four freshman authors

their own.

access to computers grows at campuses
nationwide, according to a Nov. 15 ar-

ticle in TheLos Angeles Times.
In response, universities across the
country have struggled torespond to electronic scandals without infringing on free
speech.

The issue goes beyond academia. Connecticut recently passed thenation's first
anti-computer harassment law. On a
federal level, a Congressional committee
is now debating several bills intended to

regulate "indecent" material distributed
over the Internet, most referring specifically to pornography. Attempts to controlthe"information superhighway" have
sparked a buzz of protest among internet
junkies and elicited jingoist calls to defend free speech on the Web.
An article in the Harvard Law Review
in March of 1994 concluded that new
electronic mediahave been unfairly subjected to greater governmental regulation thanthe print medium. The Internet
does, however, offer an attractive outlet
for expression, which sometimesincludes
hate speech and harassment, because of
the ease and anonymity of on-line communication.
Complaints involving e-mail harassment have increased at Cornell, according toCornell Police Capt. Randy Hausner
'B5. Sending unwanted e-mail to others
can constitute harassment under theCampus Code of Conduct. The difficulties
involved in tracing e-mail messages has
created new problems for the Cornell
Police, and "for police everywhere,"
Hausner said.
Nevertheless,

Office
of
Technology's legal advisor, Marjorie
Hodges J.D. '9l, said she felt "incredibly

comfortable with Cornell's level of expertise" in identifying the source of offensive mail. The decision whether or
not to penalize the authors of such messages, however, depends upon the "nature of the institution" which runs the
network, said Hodges, a former Cornell
J.A.
Cornell has a "strong history of supporting free speech" and therefore does

began as a casual lunchroom conversation between Karen Mazza, Auxiliary

has now grown to an annual project that

College Adds Server Space
Abraham Nussbaum, Manager

ofthe Student Server, posted

thefollowing

"As many of you may have noticed, the student server has changed
dramatically in the past few days. On Monday, I (with the help of Michael
Gelman) added an additional 1G drive to the server, bringing its total capacity
to 1.5G. In the process, we repartioned the drives into three separate volumes:
Organizations, Students, and Computing Center Employees.
•All Organizational and Student Council folders reside on the Organizations volume.
•All individual student folders exist on the Students volume.
•All computing center folders, including lablogger, live on the Computing
Center Employees volume.
We attempted to spread the abundant memory of the server around fairly,
and have revised the server guidelines accordingly. Organizations still have
no set limit to the size of their folders, but should aim to keep them under
10MB. However, the student limit of SMB has been raised to 6M8."
The Student Server is located in the network zone under SC Servers EN. It
is accessible to any student either logging on as a guest or through a student
account. They can receive a student account by logging on as a guest, and
opening up the Students folder, where they can fill out an application for their
own account. There are separate folders for such organizations as Student
Council to which different students have different access privileges. All
students can access Student Council, and some students can access other
folders. The server is owned and operated by the College, and Nussbaum is
paid as a Computing Center employee. Anyone will any further questions can
send them to anussbal.

as he "learned not to be afraid to voice [his] true
beliefs, in or out of the classroom," to which your
columnist can only say: bully for you, Mr. Schenk.
If you were unable to do thatbefore you got here,
perhaps you are more in debt to the place than you
otherwise admit.
The point of all this is not that your columnist
is tired of Mr. Schenk's views as such; he thinks
more conservatism is fine. But he's very, very
tired of the meta-conservative argument that liberal discourseisbad in itself, and that Swarthmore
fails its students by not providing a balanced
political environment, as if it could. (Inviting
conservative speakers, even if they didn't charge
several arms and legs, would not change Swatties'
reactions to those speakers, which often involved
laughter. Lots of it.) What the "radical elite" on
campus is supposed to mean is unclear: if Swarthmore is anything, it's egalitarian. There's simply
no evidence that anything besides a reluctance to
face disagreement prevents any conservative from
making his voice hear. Your columnist has a few
unpopular views of his own, views which he
sometimes declines to articulate for the sake of
peace. But he will never argue that his silence in
that respect is attributable to anything other than
circumstances, the way things happen to be.
Certainly, it might be interesting to hear the
conservative side of things more often. Your columnist encourages dissent; it keeps the Phoenix
hopping. But there is a clear difference between
substantive disagreement and moaning and groaning, and your columnist is sorry to say thatCommon Sense features entirely too much of the latter—though this issue was, he must say, an improvement over the last. Moreover, he feels that
exorcising the spirit of Mr. Schenk can do nothing
but good for conservatives around here; the more
we hear about actual issues, and the less insupportable blather about liberals and the hegemony
of liberal talk, the more actual progress toward a
balanced political environment we will have. To

I am sitting in my little room overlooking Rue
in Lille, a fairly large town in the
north ofFrance. I am spending the year here trying
to find some roots that someone once told me that
I had. So far the search has proved futile. But now
thatI have been here about a monthI feel it is high
time that I share some thoughts. Besides, you
should see whatThe Phoenix is paying me for this
article (yeah, right). A shorter headline for this
piece might be: "France, Paranoid?"
"Franchement, vous trouvez ca normal?"
("Frankly, you find that normal?") reads the caption above the picture of an old man, hunched
over, clutching a cane, and trying to squeeze
between two parked cars with their bumpers almost touching. The bulletin board goes on to say,
"Park better. There are 20,000 parking spots in
Lille." Well, thatis not quite true. Now there must
be only about 19,000. Ever since that car bomb
wounded a group of students outside a Jewish
school a couple of months ago, the parking spots
in frontofevery schoolhave been blockaded. This
occurred overnight in the city of Lyon, and took
only about a day for the rest of the country.
But the counter measures against terrorism do
not stop there. Planning to take the subway?
Better plan on packing up your trash. Trash cans
are not to be found in any subway stations. Some
districts have even gone so far as to remove all
municipal bins. Bombings in Paris, the most recent of which occurred perhaps a week ago and
involved a wad of nails being shot out of a trash
can into a crowd of commuters, prove that garde la Bassee,

bage receptacles are hazardous to the population.
In their place, you now find signs pleasantly
stating that anything left unattended in the subway

stations will have to be destroyed. And just about
every other time that I take the Metro I have the
pleasure of riding with a bunch of armed soldiers.
They travel in packs of 5, one officer and four
enlisted men, all carrying automatic rifles. Needless to say with my fantastic French accent I am
not about to strike up a conversation. Foreigners
are suspicious, and the soldiers know it.

The question is whether there is a real threat or
if it is just a case of paranoia. To answer that, one
wouldhave to explain terrorism, a task too mighty
for me and my little laptop to take on at the
moment. I will, however, state what people here
believe to be the cause of the current problems,
which commenced at the beginning of the year (or
perhaps it was the end of last year, I do not really
know. I am just another of theranks of engineers
who donot keep up with current events.) with the
hijacking of an Air France flight by a group of
Algerian "Islamistes," to use the French name.
Well, the current problems are attributed to the
same group.
The Algerian doctrine of Islam is pretty much
the same as in other Islamic countries, but is
characterized by some key differences. The most
important of theseis a global objective, namely, a
crusade against the values of the Occident and all

theenemies ofIslam. It was inAfghanistan during
the war with the Soviet Union that the first Algerian Islamistes were born. Upon their return to
Algeria after the war, they gained in popular
support, to the point where they almost took

control of the government by election in town
halls and the likes. But the army intervened and
the government regained control. What resulted
was civil strife in Algeria, with the Islamistes
using violent methods of terrorism within the
country. Their methods are brutal and their targets
are French speakers, foreigners, the police, the
military, and even women and children. It is not
possible to pinpoint their numbers exactly, but
figures range from 2,000 or 3,000 active militants
to 600,000 sympathizers.

The Islamistes' goals inFrance are pretty simple.
The most amusing is to convert the President of
the Republic, Jacques Chirac, to Islam. Their
main goal, however, is more general and consists
of the conversion of all of France to Islam by the
year 2000. Logic, of course, dictates that the best
way to do this is to gain popular support for the
group by bombing groups ofunfortunate citizens.
The issue is complicated by a couple of factors.
First, the spread of Islam in France has momentarily halted. Second, elections in Algeria are

slated for 16th of November. In fact, for the
of all the trash cans and
re-opening of the parking spaces is scheduled for
some time in January, long after these elections.
As to the reality of the threat to France, I am
forced to conclude it is real. There have been
enough bombings and bombing attempts to justify
concern. What has me torn is the effectiveness of
the counter measures taken by the French government. On the one hand it does make sense to get rid
of all the trash cans in the subways, especially
given that they have a history of posing problems.
On the other hand, I am sure that the terrorists can
find other simple ways to harm the general public.
Finally, I quite frankly believe it is dangerous to
have armed soldiers running around all over the
place. France, with the required military service
for all men, has the means to beef up security on
a national basis. But this required national service
means that these"soldiers" are nothing more than
students just out of college, the geeky kid who
used to live next door, and even the people who
will end up in prison five years from now guilty of
terrible crimes. A freak accident could pose more
of a threat to the public than the terrorists themselves. With armed soldiersrunning around things
could go badly wrong quite quickly. So, faced
with two juxtaposed sources of national problems, which is the lesser evil? Probably beefing up
national security, as ineffective as it seems. At
least that way the people cannot claim that the
government is not making any efforts. No matter
what measures are taken, I am sure that the terrorists will find ways to evade them.
So what have I shown in this littlearticle? Most
of you are probably saying "not much." Some of
you who know me are saying, "wow, so that is
what Chris is up to." At least a few, I hope, are
realizing that even seemingly quiet, developed
countries like France are faced with a daily battle
against terrorism. Finally, for those very few of
you, if any, who know someone who is heading
towards Lille in the near future, here is a little
advice: recommend against renting a car. There
may be 19,000parking spaces in Lille but, I assure
you, they are all taken.

Letters to the Editors
Chairman

of Computer Services Committee defends Swat Web policy

To the Editors:

I write regarding the editorial of November 17, "College Web Policy Shortchanges Students." As Chairman of the
Computing Services Committee, perhaps
I can help clarify a few of the issues
raised.

First, the Committee has not "released
College web policy guidelines." We spent
most of one meeting discussing a draft of
policy guidelines and released them for
public discussion shortly thereafter, but
they are in no sense to be construed as
having been approved by theCommittee.
Any official policy would be premature,
since the administrative mechanism that
will carry out a policy has not been completely decided upon. Indeed, it is my
own sense that common community understanding may obviate the need for
much of a formal policy. Nonetheless, it
is well worth thinking about the structures and issues raised by the draft, and
for that reason alone I was eager to have

it released.
Both the draft and a student's perspective of our discussion thereof are to be
found on the "swat-webber" discussion
group (directions for access are given
below). Please note that there is indeed
student representation on the CSC (see
the swat-webber posting "Your reps on
the Computing Services Committee").
Also note that it's not just the administration which is none too swift at getting
things done Student Council takes a
month to appoint students to committees,
which rather cuts into committee activity.
The CSC asked me to look into the
administration's plans for the Web, so I
talked with many of the folks involved.
Much of the Phoenix editorial was substantially correct, although its conclusions appear a bit impatient. There do
seem to have been a few in the administration who before August thought the
World Wide Web was simply a technological toy that was keeping some studentsand members of the faculty more or
less out of serious trouble. When it was
discovered that the Web was an important battleground for the hearts and minds
of prospective students, measures were
taken to capture the form if not the substance of the Yale home page, but there

was not

time for adequate input from

students, nor for unleashing the deep

knowledge of the Web held by the faculty. ;=)
There was nothing ominous, however,
about the roving Phoenix reporter being
unable to find Nancy Lehman, the director of Swarthmore's Web project, since
her family had moved to Princeton. Now,
having cast a Swarthmore oak leaf upon
the Web, the administration is looking to
refine and continue in an appropriate
manner. They'd like to have a "Web
editor" of some sort, half or full time,
housed in the Computing Center or Public Relations, but there is serious competition for funds for administrative personnel. For example, there is a pressing
need for help in themassive job ofchanging over to the new administrative computer system. This can't be delayed; the
old system is decaying and can't be repaired, and students need their grades
and faculty their paychecks.
The administration is looking for shortterm approaches to updating and improving the College's Web pages. One solution might be a faculty director working
with a team of students and able to incorporate input from the swat-webber group.

I'm sure the administration would welcome a discussion of possible short-term
solutions on swat-webber, where the ongoing discussion of the College Web
page and policies is worth looking at. To
see this mailing list through your web
browser as a threaded discussion, go to

Using either of these methods, it's possible to post html. (Note thatthe software
driving the local newsreader at the site
mentioned was produced by alumni slaving in a windowless cell in DuPont.)
Having put aside my committee chair
hat some paragraphs ago, I would like to
close with a few words to those who
realize that the World Wide Web is the
greatest innovation in educational technology of our time. The rest of you,
please go look at the above Web page.
Are they gone? Folks, the administration
doesn'trealize what a revolution is going

on—no wonder they can't tell a Web
page from a brochure. Academic revolutions are usually ponderous and slow:
you can see them coming, stroll alongside, and jump on board when you wish,
but the WWW has taken everybody by
surprise. It's a great credit to our administration that they realized something must
be done and took a productive step.
What can you do to expedite making

Swarthmore into an institution where
people can conveniently and pleasurably

access vast quantities of useful information and reach new dimensions in communication? Remember that the faculty
and the administration are great repositories of information, but that many of us

have only recently (and some of us imperfectly) mastered e-mail, for us a great
leap into Modem Technology. Having
leapt, most of usare sitting therepanting,
catching our breath, and reposiling more
of our specialized information. Most see
absolutely no need for this new-fangled
WWW technology it will never fly! It
will never be important to me!
So, student surfers, go out and find
three Web examples that a favorite faculty member or administrator will find
genuinely interesting and important
and don'tbe guilty ofcultural bias; many
of us are not swayed by amazing images
or even Socks' meow.
Then take your favorite faculty/administrators to a suitablecomputer (even
better, install a good browser on their
computer if it's up to the job) and lead
themby the hand through your examples.
Offer to make them a nice page with links
to some of their important work, scholarly or pedagogic or whatever, and explain to them that they can even do their
own pages
some of the new html
editors are just like word processors so
you don't have to know html from a hole
in the ground.
The big hassle ahead in the College's
taking advantage of the power of the
WWW is going to be in getting everyone
on board. Don't forget your fellow students andremember that some people are
tone deaf, some are color-blind, and some
just don't like computers.

Finding Support for Eating Disorders
By Katie Laird

Sometimes I walk out of Sharpies with
five cookies in my hand and I wonder
what emotional hunger it is I am trying to
feed. Other days I don't eat lunch until
3:30 and then get a pretzel at Tarble and
I wonder if I'm trying to starve myself
and if so, why. Most days I feel like I've
recovered from my eating disorder, but I
still get scared sometimes.
I get the sense that with most women,
their food issues go back further than
they'd even like to admit. Through my
recovery process, I'vehad to goback and
claim those crazy diets I was on in 9th
grade as the true beginning of my eating
disorder even though I didn't start throwing up my food until after I graduated
from high school. Those diets were all
about starvation and control. The summer after 9th grade I created my own diet
consisting of no breakfast, an apple and a
diet Pepsi for lunch and the smallest
amount possible of whatever my parents
were serving for dinner. And this diet
was supposed to keep me alive while I
was fencing 6 hours a day! I was elated
when my former classmates
complimented me on my weight—l had
never received such a compliment in my
life.
Towards the end of my senior year in
high school, I finally started being more
social and as a result drinking more. I
wouldoften throw up at the end of a night
of crazy drinking. This throwing up was
always more or less justified because I
had obviously had so much to drink that
I couldn't hold it down any longer. I
thought I'd have less of a hangover if I
just threw up. One night I came home
pretty sober, but decided that I had eaten
too much at the party that night and I
would probably feel better if I just threw
up. So I did. I was a little scared, but I
could still make myself believe the story
that I needed to throw up because I had
been drinking.
I toldmyself that same story the entire
next year. I tend to block out the many
timesI threw up simply because I felt like
I had eaten too much. Whenever I threw
up from drinking, my story was reinforced and I was once again able to ig-

nore theother episodes. I lived thisentire
year in denial of my bulimia. No one
around me knew anything about it. In
fact, they all congratulated me for being
so health conscious because whenever
we went out for dinner, I always ordered
a salad. Whenever I bought food for the
house it was always fat free. My junk
food binges took place between shifts at
the restaurant or when no one else was
home. Any time I thought the word
bulimia to myself, I immediately shut
down, and told myself that that was not
me. I threw up sometimes, but I certainly
wasn't bulimic. Good defense mechanisms, Katie.
That summer I finally told my best
friend about my deep dark secret. She
held me and we both cried for awhile.
She because she was so sad that this had
affected me and me because I was so
relieved to finally stop living a big secret.
During the five weeks that I spent with
her that summer, I did not throw up once.
I thought I was instantly cured, but I did
promise her that I would seek out help
once I got to school. Weboth figured that
at college there would be plenty ofplaces
and people who could help me out.
I got to Swarthmore that fall andfound
nothing. I looked around for signs, I
searched the bulletin boards in Parrish
desperate to find some club or group that
could help me think about eating disorders. I found nothing. I did find a helpful
RA who was willing to talk with me
about it. He sent me to psych services
where I convinced the therapist that I was
really just fine now and that I was just
worried about a hallmate. I didn't go
back until a few months later. I continued
to throw up occasionally and told myself
thatit was really not aproblem any longer.
But the problem escalated again that
following summer. I was bingeing and
purging 3 or 4 times every day. I spent a
month at the beach where the horror of
getting into a bathing suit every day kept
me throwing up any time I ate something
besides lettuce leaves with fatfree dressing. It was a constant cycle of punishment for me. I would cook dinnerfor the
family, catch myself licking my fingers
in the middle and get so upset that I
would go on an hour long binge and

throw up just in time to sit down at the
dinnertable and claim that I wasn't hungry enough to eat anything (I was once
again the good girl who watched her
weight).
I returned to Swarthmore once again
with resolve to "fix" this problem of
mine. I decided to stick with an outside
therapist (this is nothing against
Swarthmore's psych services; my therapist from home just happened to already
know my whole life story) and we worked
through a lot together. But there were
many times when I wanted support from
my peers. I wanted other people to admit
that they deal with these issues too. I
wanted to hear from others how they
handled their situations.
I feel fortunate to say that I feel much
better now. And that is not just in a form
of denial where I throw up every once in
a while but tell myself the story that I am
OK. I occasionally overeat,but I haven't
thrown up in over a year, I sometimes
still feel bad aboutmy body and about my
eating habits. But I also feel fortunate to
say that I now have the' kind of peer
support that I wanted so desperately before. Once a week I get to meet with a
group of other people who are dealing
with or have dealt with any kind ofissues
around food. Some have recovered from
eating disorders, others are in the throws
of it, and still others are sort of body/food
conscious and don't want it to get out of
hand. We come together to support each
other and talk about all of this. On those
days when I wonder why I took 5 cookies
with me from Sharpies, I get a chance to
think about it out loud with a group of
others who may have had similar experiences. It gives me a chance toreflect and
sort out the tough stuff. We work together on everyone's issues and solve the
little that we can each week. I never want
another person to enterS warthmorelooking for support on food/body image issues and find nothing like I did. I want
everyone to feel supported in theirdesire
to heal themselves.

Letters to the Editors
Mistaken assumptions
To the Editors:

Last week in these pages, Jason
Zengerle and Eric Mealy severely criticized my integrity as a writer (in the
article "Integrity of Brus Article Questioned" and the letter "Brus Misrepresents Words," respectively). They did so
thoughtfully, but based their writing on
false assumptions about my motives for
writing "Racial Realpolitik on Planet
Swat" (The Phoenix, Nov. 10). I hope
this letter will put to rest such
misperceptions.
Zengerle accuses me of intellectual dishonesty. He thinks I attended the Race in
America forum and disagreed with participants opinions, but then kept quiet so
that I could denounce the whole affair a
week later through the more secure medium of print. I agree with Zengerle that
this would have been quite unscrupulous. However, I did not attend the discussion.
I based my account of the forum entirely on Erik Huneke' s and EricaTurner' s
front page news story in The Phoenix. I
indicated this first in my introduction (".
at the recent campus discussion en.
titled 'Race in America' [as reported in
last week's front page PAoenix report].")
and then beforemyfirst quotation ("Consider this particularly damning defense
ofLouis Farrakhan, taken verbatim from
The Phoenix").
Of course, my absence from the forum
alone does not absolve me; had I deliberately avoided the discussion with an eye
to later combing The Phoenix for incriminating material, I should be hanged
twice. The fact is, at the time of the
discussion I had distinct views on racial
politics but did not make time to attend.
There are perhaps a dozen lectures and
colloquia on campus every week, and
most students are lucky to fit even one
into their schedules. The discussion
passed me by as many opportunities here
inevitably do. At the timeI did not intend
to write about the forum, never mind

SC Responds

on campus.A liberal arts education should be more thanchoices from an
ideological menu. As Professors Burke
and Judson pointed out, the liberal arts
should expose students to a variety of
perspectives. Faculty should teach students how to define terms, weigh evidence, and defend conclusions in a
Socratic environment where everything
is open to challenge.
A good liberal arts education is not
possible unless thefaculty is multicultural
in the broadest sense of that term. Diversity is an important educational tool.But
the liberal arts suffer when professors
with strong opinions fail to restrain their
enthusiasms, or when too many of them
beat the same ideological or conceptual
drum. Conservatives have charged that
Swarthmore's faculty is pushing a particular agenda to the exclusion of others,
or to the exclusion of intellectual freedom on the part of students. Right or
wrong, these charges deserve more of an
answer than they have so far received.
I am not a conservative, but I too am
concernedthat the only non-honors course

on Shakespeare concentrates so heavily
on race, gender, and other "identities."
The History Department that can offer a
course on the Historical Construction of
Identity, but cannot mount a survey of
American history from colonial times to
the present. And I am concerned that the
English Department cannot offer a full
survey of English Literature, but can
mount a course on Lesbian Novels Since
World War 11. My concern is not that
identity issues are being taught, but that
they seem to be displacing broader concerns. I would be expressing the same
concern if conservatives were in charge,
and pursuing their enthusiasms to the
detriment of basic survey courses.
To this outsider, Swarthmore's curriculum resembles a potluck supper that
somebody failed to organize around the
basic food groups. It seems designed
more for specialists than generalise.
Courses that should function as basic
building blocks are not offered every

Yesterday the elections for Student
Council were completed. One thing we
all noticed was the monstrous amount of
paper, cloth, and ink used in the campaign. For those even remotely concerned about the environment, that is
fairly upsetting. Thus the question becomes, how can we change the election
process so thatresources are not wasted?

election season has rolled around again.
For the whole week of campaigning, not
one single poster is seen with the
candidate's name, face or thoughts on

they convince Swat to vote for them?

Why am I writing this? Yes, I am
bored; the last elections were very bland
and devoid of electrifying political passion. I want to see energy, intensity and
pure dedication. By subjecting candidates to the scrutiny of the "market,"
inefficient ones will have to drop out of
the race. The final product? A class of
excellent representatives, whosereserves
of public spirit are infinite. Perhaps, as
some critics might argue, I am looking
for a political "best and brightest."

To the Editors:
As a parent I have followed the current
debate over "PCism" in the curriculum
with some interest
I agree that it helps to read syllabi
before passing judgment on the curriculum, but no syllabi were available last
week whenmy son and I conferred about
his schedule.From reading the catalogue,
I suspect thatthe Young America'sFoundation was onto something that its three
faculty respondents were much too quick
to dismiss. My suspicions are heightened
by the fact thatthe faculty letters focused
less on the substance of the conservatives' critique than on its anonymity or
the fact that the YAF drew its conclusions, as they had to, without syllabi.
Every age has its "politically correct"
curriculum, its literary "canon," its conventional wisdom, and its settled habits
of thought Most ages also have their
critics who would substitute their "new"
wisdom for the "old." The current debate
over "PCism," however, is not so much
between an old and a new guard as it is

GIMME SOME SUGAR, BABY
Casino: Scorsese's Losing Gamble PANDORA'S PSYCHIC PREDICTIONS*
By lan Bricke
Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro),
the protagonist of Martin Scorcese's
Casino, has a head for numbers. He works
for theKansas City mob bosses, "making
book" and making lots of money. Ace
never bets wrong.So, when the goodfellas
move in on Las Vegas in the early '7os,
hebecomes theirnumber one man. Ace is
put in charge of the Tangiers, the largest
and glitziest casino on the Strip. His job:
to pull in as much money as possible,
legally or illegally. And he does. Almost
overnight, the Tangiers becomes a cash
cow beyond anyone's wildest dreams.
And Ace runs it with an iron hand and an
obsessive eye. He weighs the showgirls,
he eavesdrops on the guests, he counts
the numberof blueberries in each muffin.
After Ace has a few card sharks' hands
broken, the local scam artists learn to
leave the Tangiers alone.
Life is perfect Ace is the king of his
own domain, staring down on the gaming
floor from his office high above, padding
across wine-red carpets in very expensive shoes, hiring and firing at will. And
hehas a queen, Ginger McKenna (Sharon
Stone), a former hustler and showgirl, his
new wife. It is with Ginger that the problems start, and with Ace's childhood
friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), the
volatile hitman brought in to cover his
back. As Ace discovers. Ginger has a
great many skeletons in her closet: specifically alcohol, cocaine, and her old
pimp, Lester Diamond (James Woods).
As his blissful domestic life shatters into
a thousand chaotic shards, Ace watches
Nicky single-handedly demolish everything that he has built. Nicky kills off a
few too many people, twists a few too
many arms a little too hard, steals a little
too much money from all the wrong
people. Pretty soon, he has attracted the
attention of both the bosses and the authorities. And allof theheat comes down
on Ace's head. It's only a matter of time
before Ginger and Nicky get together,
and once this happens. Ace's fate is sealed.
Casino opens as he walks across a parking lot, climbs into thedriver's seatofhis
car, and disappears in the fireball blast of
a car-bomb.
Casino is a brilliant, dazzling disappointment. Meant to be the third part of
director Martin Scorcese's crime trilogy
(after two classics: Mean Streets and
Goodfellas), Casino is, finally, both too
little and too much. It's all flash and no
flesh, a stunning showcase for Scorcese's
prodigious talents, but one without real
dramatic meat. And it's very, very familiar. Scorcese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi covered much of the same
ground, admittedly on a smaller scale, in
the far superior Goodfellas. Casino and
Goodfellas share the same themes and
obsessions: glamour, betrayal, violence,
pride, the rise and fall of modern day
gangsters. With the earlier film, the material was fresh, shocking, new.This time

It's a cheap shot, to
compare Casino with
Goodfellas and decide
that it can't hold a candle
to its predecessor. But it's
an accurate one. Although an hour longei

tually, exhausting.
Scorcese and Pileggi want the collapse
ofAce's empire to be tragic, to be a fable
of greed and grandeur, a new spin on the
Garden of Eden. It doesn't work, primarily because Casino's characters are neither likable nor particularly human. De
Niro, Stone, and Pesci are all great actors, doing great work, but they're playing icons, filmmaker's toys, not human
beings. Pesci is good—Nicky is a very
convincing psychopath indeed. But, like
Scorcese, he's done this before. De Niro,
in an atypically low-key role, simmers
and smolders manfully and struggles with
the blank he's been handed to play. It's a
tribute to his considerable skills that he's
able to turn Ace, the repressed outsider,
into an almost noble figure, obsessive as
hell but somehow still vaguely sympathetic. James Woods gets away with several mouthfuls of chewed scenery as
Lester Diamond, twitching and mugging
like mad, but his performance seems to

be only tangentially related to the rest of
the film. The big surprise here is Sharon
Stone, actually acting for once. Her Ginger is a fascinating bundle of quirks,
dependence and bombshell sexiness and
desperation and cold-eyed calculation,
but the screenplay sells her short by denying her any logical motivation.

By Chuck Stevens
This being 1995, misery and self-destruction are hardly unexplored topics in
the cinematic world; admittedly, the advent of what has come to be considered
Generation X cinema has lent angst a
distinctly shallow feel, but there is still
room for legitimate exploration, of the
themes it implies. But it is not often that
the despair depicted on screen is quite as
palpable, or as strangely compelling, as
in Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas,
currently on limited release in theaters,
starring Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.
It isn't that the events portrayed are
particularly novel movie fare, or even
thatthecharacters are especially real: it's
that the dreariness, for this is aprofoundly
dreary movie, comes within the context
of more dreariness, surrounded by, well,
you get the idea. That the events and
characters, by rums tragic and pathetic,
seem
absolutely normal and
unremarkable, lends Leaving Las Vegas,
as a cinematic and cultural statement,
considerable power.
The plot tells only half the story. Cage
(perfectly cast,
extraordinally
comvincing) depicts Ben, an alcoholic
Hollywood screenwriter who, uponbeing
fired, heads toLas Vegas to drink himself
to death; on his first night there, he picks
up a prostitute named Sera (Shue, also
entirely believable) who finds him
interesting and eventually convinces him
to move in with her. Figgis (who also
wrote the screenplay) is not particularly
interested in a redemptive-love-story
theme, though: Ben's self-destruction
goes on unabated and largely unremarked
upon, and the relationship at the center of
the film is among its victims. We see
extensive segments from a perspective
that mirrors his: disjointed, marked by
flashbacks, blackouts, delusions, and a
heightening sense ofdiminishing control.
Sera, for her part, struggles with an
abusive pimp and more abusive
customers, and steadily wearies of saving
Ben from himself; they eventually
separate, accelerating his breakdown, and
their reconciliation comes too late to
rescue him.
Leaving Las Vegas is not a love story,
in any real sense, nor is it about alcoholism. The sex scenes—of which there is
no short supply—are largely mechanical, joyless, whether they involve Ben
and Sera or Sera and one (or more) ofher
clients. Sex, here, is simply sex for its
own sake; emotional attachment is not a

those whereBen is seemingly stable and
self-aware; while the viewer recognizes
alcohol's effects, there are no scenes of
relative happiness or coherence due to
Ben's putting down the bottle for a bit, as
might be expected if the aim were solely
to dramatize alcoholism. Drinking

simply
exists—again, for its own sake. The mood
of the soundtrack alternates between
bluesy and peculiarly jaunty, making it
hard to take the story entirely as tragedy;
finding pathos in self-destruction is hard
when the story is set to bouncy, even
raucous, music. The opening shot shows
Ben walking down agrocery aisle tossing
bourbon and whiskey into a shopping
cart—but thehard-edgedjazz beatbehind
the scene undercuts any sense of that
sequence as ominous or disturbing. He
lives to drink, and he drinks to die: sadness
at the concept comes only from a removed
perspective.
The failure of the relationship of the
two characters further undermines any
sense of a renewing force, a redeeming
feature. When Ben moves in, Sera buys
him gifts, prominent among them,
astoundingly, agoldhip flask. Thecamera
lingers on the object for a while, as if to
say, yes, she really did it: clearly, this is
not a scenario wherelove struggles against
the effects of drink. Rather, love (or
whatever approximates it) serves to aid
and abet theprocess of disintegration. No
sense of future intrudes on their life—and the grimness is reinforced by a
lighting scheme where shadows are
heavy, pervasive. Discussions of their
relationship are invariably tied to sex:
should they have it, what does it mean,
etc., and it is over sex—his bringing
home a prostitute, in a scene redolent
with irony
that they go their separate
ways. In all the time he lives with her, she
makes no apparent effort to halt his slide:
she sympathizes, when drinking leads to
uncontrollable rage or shaking
helplessness, but she does nothing. To
extrapolate this attitude into a larger
cultural statement about life choices, and
our willingness to see and condemn selfdestructive behavior, may seem like
something of a stretch, but the tone of this
film supports that notion.
Essentially, the movie concerns itself
withcertain actions, actions that come to
mark and define two lives: sex and alcohol
abuse. We are immersed in—no, barraged
by images of these behaviors, to the point
where they seem distinctly unremarkable:

pleasure, in Casino comes from details.

is Disney's summer block buster
Pocahontas.With Mel Gibson as the

produces another masterpiece of
cartooning. Now I can list until the
Phoenix runs out of ink the number
ofhistorical inaccuracies (and possibly even offenses) in the film, but as
long as we look at Pocahontas as a
cartoon that has some historical basis about John Smith's coming to the
New Worldand subsequent involvement with Pocahontas of the Powhatan
Indians, and not as a historical documentary, we don't have a big problem. The
animationand music are both what you'd
expect from Disney, but I have to say, I
still likeAladdin better. I'll probably go

Cabaret: Celebration of Psychosis
After weeks of praxis, a motley mishmash of foreigners, geeks, star children,

conservatives and rebels pulled off what
hasbeenheralded as the mostrevolutionary performance piece in recent Swarthmore herstory.
Last semester, Yonathan Dessalegn
'96 invited Amiri Baraka to speak.
Baraka, formerly Le Roi Jones, is the
author of Dutchman, finale of the
Director's night of scenes, also last weekend. Baraka spoke of homestyle artistic

Olde Clubbe was as recollective of
Berlin 1932 as a former fraternity house
can get. Red table cloths, periphery of
seats in shadow, narrow aisles, a small
stage bathed in white light. Robert
Palmer-style waitresses slithered between
teetering customers, distributing intoxicants. The strict policy of smoking and
cigarette sales fostered not only a fog, but
a stench. Mary Gergen said it was decadent.
Above the stage, the balcony burgeoned with fresh funk. A six-piece band
including sax and female vocals styled
catchy original hip-hop inflected
jazzrock. Props, to the musicians for coherence and danceability, and to the singer
for ethereal effervescence.
The focus of the show was below not

Beirut: Swat Sports Extravaganza
Rugby

Phi Psi

By Frank Amar

By Jen Philpott and Margaret Cohen

By Jen Philpott and Heather Goff

The Beirut played at AY is perhaps the
competitive and the most complicated on campus. The basic rules are the
same fromlocation to location—the first
team to sink the ping pong balls into all
the cups first wins. However, the Beirut
played at AY has evolved into a sport
with a complex set of rules and strate-'
gies. Before 1994, AY Beirut (named
because the constantraining of ping pong
balls on cups resembled the daily bombardment that the city of Beirut took
during the early and mid 1980's) was
played on a rickety old ping-pong table,
supported by two trash cans. Thanks to
the work of Kurk Selverian '97, Eddie
Shin '97, and the rest of the 1993-94
pledge class, a new, durable, wooden
Beirut table (with the AY letters painted
on the surface) was constructed.
The simple task of filling the cups for
each game and positioning them on the
tablebecome more important. M any players put less beverage into their front cup,
sinceit is the one that is usually hit early.
The middle two cups have a medium
amount of beverage, and the back three
cups have the most, so that they can't be
knocked over easily. The positioning of
the cups has undergone some slight
changes in the past year. Whereas in the
past the cups were placed directly in front
of the defender, some players (especially
Pat Donaghy '97) like to arrange their
cups in a "student section," placing them
on the far back corner of the table, making it a low percentage shot.
Every Beirut-playing member of the
fraternity chooses to shoot the ping pong
balls into the cups. In thepast, quite a few

It has been an exciting week inRugby
Beirut with excellent matches played by
Jason Dougal '96 and, after a prolonged
dry spell. Jack Schecter '96. Dougal and
Schecter's winning streak was particularly unexpected as they were not playing on their home table in Wharton
CD basement; it was an away game at
Phi Psi.
The Rugby Beirut League, a club sport
at Swarthmore, has been very competitive thisyear. The primary reason for the
markedincrease in the numberofmatches
and quality of play is the construction of
the league's new home table. It is a masterpiece of wood and vamish designed
and constructed by Eric "Iggy" Engstrom
'96, who is a key player in the league.
Engstrom commented on his creation,
"My ass proud."
Following their performance on Phi
Psi's turf, the Rugby Beirut League demonstrated its skills on their home table.
On Monday night, the League convened
for a special tournament.The teams comprised roomates Dougal and Engstrom,
Choe and Schecter, and Jason Sturm '97
and Schwan. Dougal and Engstrom were
frustrated in an early round match and
struggled to get back into the rotation.
Sturm and Schwan dominated, and had a
run of the table for many rounds, defeating many opponent pairs.
Because Rugby Beirut is a club sport,
itis played with somewhatdifferentrules

Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi. Rugby Beirut
is played according to Gentlemen's Rules,
following a well-established rugby tradition. As a result, turns to shoot alternate

the cups. The current table is more conducive for bouncing, but pouring some
liquid onto the area in front of the cups
(watering down the infield) reduces the
effectiveness of bouncing.
Once a shot is attempted, no player is
allowed to interfere with the flight of the
ball or allowed to touch it while it is
bouncing, unless it is obvious that the
ball cannot bounce into a cup. A player
may obstruct a shooter's view at the cup
or try to distract him, provided he stand
no further than half court. This isreferred
to as playing defense and is usually only
used late in a game when one side is
losing. Chuck Hudson '96, arguably the
best defensive player in the fraternity,
stands at half court with his arm extended. Steve Vokes '97 prefers to wave
his shirt in the shooter's line of sight.
Like all sports, Beirut has a tournament to determine its champion. In the
past, one day was been set aside for a
double elimination tournamentto decide
who owns "the belts." Last year, the team

of Francis Amar '96 and Chuck Hudson
'96 won both tournaments. This year,
league play was instituted to make
seedings for the playoffs. As of this printing, JP Simon "97 and Pat Straub "97
were in first place with a 13-5 record.
Individual statistics have been kept for
each game, and Keith Pieck '97, Pat
Straub'97, Donaghy, Amar, andBen Hall
'9B have emerged as the leading shooters.

members also work to bring conservative
speakers to the campus to help incorporate a variety of views into the student
body. In general, the group's goal is to
expose the S warthmore community to all
sides ofpolitics by spreading conservative ideas
through literature, advertising, debates, and other

SCU-sponsored activities.
Justin Herring '97, recently re-elected president
of SCU, summarized
SCU's success. Herring
said, "Theeffectiveness of
our political activism is
aided by the fact that we
are right." Supporting Herring are vice-president
Christian Mikkelson '99,
secretary Damon Taffe
'99, and treasurer Julie Schwendiman
'99.
Probably the most exciting news for
SCU is the growing numberof total members, and particularly the growth in the
number of active members. Especially
promising are the large number of first-

esteemed Phi Psi fraternity and home
table for Phi Psi varsity Beirut The
arena, as described by Dulaney, is built in
what is commonly thought to be the Phi
• Psi dance floor.
The home turf is an old wooden table
on which generations of players have
spilled their equipment. In the center is
the symbol of life for the brothers who
dedicate many of their evenings to honing the art of the game.
The game at Phi Psi is not for weaklings. It takes strength, stamina, and agility to play with these brothers. The ball
does not automatically alternatebetween
teams, but rather, it is a war to see which
player can first recover the ball from
places unbeknownst to polite society.
This includes running, jumping, tackling, reaching, kicking, scratching, biting, slapping, diving, and the occasional
full-out slide.
Additionally, the Phi Psi Beirut squad
must contend with a full 36 ounces as
opposed to the "Gentlemeri" up the hill.
The rigorous demands placed on theplayers have severely limited their human
resources. As a result, each individual
player is responsible for more playing
time than in other varsity leagues.
The team roster is short, but distinguished. Senior tri-captains Andrew Place

'96, Eric Griffin '96, and Kevin Frazer'96
are the active masters and torch-bearers
of the Phi Psi tradition. Journeyman underclassmen Aaron "El Caballo" Bond
'97, Will Dulaney '97, and Rico Suave
Delgado '97 form a (usually) reliable
backbone. Trainees Wilson Kello '9B,

grabbing, poking, scratching, gauging,
slapping, or otherwise impeding a
player's right to the ball, although trashtalk is encouraged.
Another key difference' is the equipment required to play Rugby League.
Due to the nature of funding for club
sports and the level of commitment by
most club players, RugbyLeague doubles
teams are onlyrequired to bring 24 ounces
to thetable insteadof the standard varsity
amount of 36 ounces. Furthermore, at the
varsity level one seldom hears the witty
reparte, such as "We should have made
the table out of glass so that Sturm could
see the cups!," or"Drink, Choe!"
In addition, Rugby League doubles
teams are often co-ed, reflecting the inclusive nature of the Rugby Beirut philosophy. Pick-up games are the most
common type played on the CD table as
opposed to the more organized tournaments at the varsity level. The Rugby
League often challenges themselves

One element that is lacking inPhi Psi's
game is audience support. The fans have
either "crashed" out in front of the home
entertainment system (probably from the
exhaustion created by too much playing

against varsity level competition.

While the Rugby Beirut League always welcomes newcomers to the table,
there is a core of returning players who

keep the League active all season long.
"From night to night, the faces may
change, but they all have one thing in
common, Dougal says, "They all have
the love."

Kentwell Receives National
Honor: Div. III Coach of the Year
By Jen Philpott
The former head coach of
S warthmore's Divisional Championfield
hockey teamrecently received theprestigious National Division 111 Coach of the
Year Award. On November 17, at the
Division I field hockey championships,
Coach Richard Kentwell was presented
with a plaque honoring his contribution
to the sport by the President of the U.S.
Field Hockey Association.
Kentwell was chosen to receive this
honorby his peers, allof the Division 111
field hockey coaches nation-wide. Assistant field hockey coach, Annie Fetter,
explained that the fact thatKentwell was
selected by hispeers makes the award an
even greater acknowledgement of his
contribution to the sport. The award is
also a great honorfor Swarthmore's athletic program, which is not often recognized at the national level in such a manner.
Kentwell coached at S warthmore for
four years, beginning with the 1991 season and a team that had a losing record
more often thannot. Kentwell arrived at
Swarthmore after coaching at Yale, a
Division I school, where he led his team
to several championship seasons.
Kentwell did the same for Swarthmore.
The combination of Kentwell and Fetter
molded Swarthmore's field hockey program into what it is today, a Division
111powerhouse. This season, the squad
won the prestigious Seven Sisters Tournament for the second year in a row,
finished with a nearly perfect record, and
were named Division Champions.
When asked what this award represents to him, Kentwell responded modestly, "You can be the greatest coach in
the world, but if you don't have athletes
with the desire, then you don't get results. This award is a reflection on the
team. It is nice to be recognized by your
peers, but this is really a recognition of
the season that the team had."
In Kentwell's opinion, the main criteria for the award is the amount of improvement that a team demonstrates.
Kentwell said, "It's the guy who takes
the team from nothing to winning. It's
what the players have done." In just four
years, Kentwell shaped the raw talent on
the team, accumulated without recruiting, into a squad of skilled, determined,
cohesive, and winning players. .
Kentwell reflected on the season, "A
lot of changes were made by a lot of
people this year. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The players enjoyed
what they were doing, and they extended
both on the athletic field and academically." The players have expressed simi-

lar sentiments about the season and are
very pleased for Kentwell and honored
by the award.
As mentioned above, however,
Kentwell is the former head coach of
Swarthmore's field hockey team. Approximately three weeks ago, Kentwell
received notice that his contract had not
been renewed by the athletic department
due to "administrative reorganization."

After a championship season, Kentwell
was not invited back because the athletic
department wanted to fill his position
with a full-time coach, which Kentwell
was not.
The players were disappointed and felt
betrayed by the athletic department, particularly since they were not consulted
before the decision was made.
One player, who preferred to remain
anonymous, said, "In my opinion, this
administrative decision which is supposed
to be

good for the program is a concept
which is completely off-base, hj just

"These athletes were
challenged to the
fullest. They rose to
that challenge. They
wanted to rise to that
challenge. They had
goals and they met

Wrestlers Split Meet
By Alejandra Gonzalez
and Curtis Trimble
The S warthmore matmen opened their
1995-96 campaign Saturday, splitting
dual meets with Rutgers-Camden and
Albright S warthmore lost a hard-fought
meet against Albright, 28-19. Afterwards,
the Men of Sparta beat up on a shorthanded Rutgers-Camden, 30-18.
Win or lose, the new team spirit pervaded everything S warthmore attempted
throughout their matches. No one embodied this spirit more than co-captains
Jon Fiorello '9B, Chaz Teplin '96 and
Tirian Mink '9B. Fiorello wrestled two
weight classes (158) above his actual
weight (134), in an attempt to thwartthe
loss of points Swarthmore would have
incurredif forcedto forfeit the 158pound
class.
Also turning in superb efforts, but coming up short in the win column, was
Mink. When Mink steps on the mat, the
on-lookers can be sure of a show. The
only problem seems to be that while
Mink often starts the show, he doesn't
always finish it. But, rest assured wrestling fans, ifMink continues to put forth
as much effort as he did this weekend he
will win more than his share of matches
this year.
Teplin, nicknamed "Dynamo" because

ofhis perpetual feistiness, met a 26 yearold retired construction worker, Dave
Pendergast, from Rutgers in his only
matchof the day. While it was clear that
this Pendergast had done more than his
shareof sledgehammer swinging, Teplin
took it to him in his 8-2 defeat.
Also turning in stellar winning efforts
for the matmen were co-captain Pete
Balvanz '9B, Matt Miller '95.5, and
AdrianWilson '99.Balvanzdefeatedboth
of his opponents in the 150pound class,
pinning one in the first period and beating the other to a pulp in a fifteen-point
rout.

Winning the surprise match of the day,
senior Miller pinned his sub-superiorly
conditionedAlbright opponent at the 6:18
mark. Seeing the confused look on
Miller' s face immediately after thematch
provided the grandest entertainment of
the afternoon.
Rounding out the list of winners in the
Albright match, Wilson defeated his
Albright opponent 5-3 in the 134 lb.
weight class. Said one on-looker, "For
such a nice guy he sure is cocky on the
mat." Judging from his win, one might
say he's just cocky enough.
This weekend Swarthmore wrestlers
will indubitably be tested as NCAA Division JJ schools Cheyneyand Mansfield
travel to Lamb-Miller in search of a little

well-advised decision. Fetter said, "It
makes me question the College's commitment to successful athletic teams, if
they make decisions that are this shortsighted."
Another player expressed a deeper resentment over the decision, especially in
lightof this award, "Thefact thatRichard
was named Division 111 Coach of the
Year just makes the decision and the
athletic department look even more ridiculous than it did when the decision
was first announced. It's like telling the
student body that the coach's qualifications (and therefore the assets they can
bring to the team) don'tmatter as long as
the coachis full time.Doesn't it matter if
the teams are successful or if the athletes
are benefiting both as athletes and as
people from the coaching that they receive?"
Kentwell was more reflective and simply regrets the effect that this decision
will have on the team that has worked sc
hard to excel underhis tutelage. For himself, he is sorry to have lost a "fun, parttime job,"but he will continue to run his
business andpossibly findanothercoaching position at another school.
In response to the players' feeling?
about the athletic department, "I'm not
sure that they [Athletic Department] are
interested in teams' reaching their full
potential. They are more interested in
teams' playing at a satisfactory level and
having a good experience. The players
want the best to be brought out in them,
but this is not a criteria that is necessarily
stressed by the Athletic Department."
Kentwell also feels that if the Athletic
Department had consulted the players,
they might have made a different decision regarding his employment.
Kentwell stressed thathe has no negative feelings toward Swarthmore's athletic program, and only the greatest fondness and pride in the field hockey team.
Kentwell is pleased with the four years
that he spent coaching at Swarthmore
and with the effort that the players put
into making their dreams come true. He
said, "Many decisions made on the athletic field carry over into life. These
athletes were challenged to the fullest.
They rose to that challenge. They wanted
to rise to that challenge. They had goals
and they met them." It is easy to understand why Kentwell was chosen by his
peers for special recognition.
Karen Borbee, head coach of women's
lacrosse and former head coach of
women's basketball, will replace
Kentwell next season. Borbee has both
played and coached field hockey in the
past, but never at Swarthmore. Borbee is
a full-time Swarthmore coach.

more had little hope of staying close in
the second half, and had much less of a
chance of winning. Lafayette's size put
two important Garnet big men in early
foul trouble. A.J. Shanley '97 and Aaron
Bond '97 saw limited time because of
early fouls.
Swarthmore's bench outscored
Lafayette's 39-16. Sam Voolich '96
scored 19 points and sank eight of 14
attempts. Colin Convey '97 added 14

points. Convey controlledthe gamefor a
stretch and scored 13points in about two
minutes.
"It was about midway into the second
half. They switched to a zone. I drool at
a zone because for me it means: spot up
and shoot a three" said Convey. He sunk
a three, floated a driving layup over
Lafayette's 6'll 250 pound center, netted a mid-range jumper, and then connected on two more three-pointers. "It
was the greatest couple ofminutes I have
ever played," he added.
Scoring five points in the last 1:13 of
the game, Ben Schall '97 was the hero.
He sank two free throws to tie the game
at 67-67. On its next possession, Lafayette
made great underneath passes, and an
open man answered with a thunderous
slam dunk. The Garnet ran a set play
looking to set up sharpshooter Tim
Schofield '99 for a three-pointer. He was
well covered and smartly passed off to
Schall who drained the shot to give
Swarthmore a 70-69 lead.
Lafayette missed a shot on its next
possession and then fouled Voolich. He
missed the front end of a one-and-one.
Lafayette missed another shot but retained possession when a Garnetplayer
knocked the ball out-of-bounds. On the
inbound play, the Lafayette point guard
broke free for an open nine-footer but
missed. The ball was tipped back up by a
teammate, and as the tip rolled off the rim
and the final buzzer sounded, everyone
was frozen in disbelief.
The win gives the team a tremendous
confidence boost before their final road
game of theroad trip. "We can't be overconfident going in. We just have to play
the same way we've been playing: with
pride,"saidßond. Indeed, facing Franklin
and Marshall on the road is a task few
teams look forward to. F&M has won 60
straight regular season games against
Division HI opponents including 33
straight at the Mayser Center.
Having already ended a 50 year losing
streak, Swarthmore have proven that
nothing is beyond theirreach. They are
also approaching the game with a different attitude.
"Last year when we went[to F&M] for
theplayoff game, we faced a huge deficit
in the secondhalf. Then with eight minutes left we pulled to within six, had them
frazzled, andforced themto call a timeout.
Now we won't be happy with thatresult,"
saidConvey. A win would even the team's
conference record and put the team in
excellent position after thefirst semester.

Women's Hoops Lose Close Game, 69-61
By Leslie Hermsdorf
The women's basketball team competed in the Seven Sisters Tournament
this weekend at Bryn Mawr College. In
a dimly lit gym with a bright yellow
court, the women hoopsters picked up
two losses and a win.
On Friday, St Joseph's College topped
Swat with a final score of 61-51. The
first half was messy but, in the second
half, Swat came out and rallied against
St. Joe's until they were down by only
fourpoints.St. Joe's was able to maintain
and widen their lead. Michelle Walsh
'9B and Co-captain Nancy Rosenbaum
'96 eachcontributed 13 importantpoints,
to no avail.
The second tourney game, held on
Saturday against Haverford, repeated the
pattern of the first half lacking intensity.
The women beat Haverford three times
last season, so this 63-49 loss was unexpected.
Rosenbaum's '96 combative play
earned her fifteen points, whileshe dominated the boards pulling down 15 rebounds. Still, Swat picked up a second
loss.
Erin Greeson '99 explains: "As we
fought to close the scoring gap in the
second halves, we proved that we can
play with intensity and skill. I have a lot

of confidence in our team."
On Sunday, at 9 am, aching for a win,
the women established themselves with
a 61-39 victory over Bryn Mawr.
Rosenbaum '96 played more stellarbasketball, leading the team with a career
high of 19points and adding 15rebounds.
Co-captain Emily Walker '96 performed

amazingly, with 14 points as proof.
This win was very hopeful according
to team member Betsy Rosenbaum '9B:
"We put a lot of stuff together. People
started shooting and hitting their shots."
Nancy Rosenbaum '96 agreed: "I was
really happy with the third game. Each
half we were building, and we finally
pulled a whole game together against
Bryn Mawr on Sunday."
Returning to regular season games.

Each half we were
building, and we finally pulled a whole
game together against
Bryn Mawr
Swat played Eastern College last night
on their own turf. Yet again, stricken by
thenot-so-intense firsthalf disease, Eastern College led 35-27 at the half. But
Swat came out ready in the second half.
Walsh '9B rocked the house with three
consecutive three-pointers, going on to
finish with 13 points overall.
Holly Barton '99 played one of her
best games yet with 16 points and 11
rebounds, and Rosenbaum'96 again awed
the crowd, leading the team with hustle,
17 points, and 15 rebounds.
With such a scoring spurt in the second
half. Swat stayed within 3 points of Eastern untilthe buzzer. Greesontossed in 10
crucial points to keep the women in the
game. The final score, 69-66, was disappointing after the exciting last-minute
scramble to get those three points.
