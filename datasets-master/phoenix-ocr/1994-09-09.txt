Key Participants in
Stalking Case Speak
By Tamar Charry and

Erik Huneke
In recent months, Swarthmore has
received an unusual amount of media
attention surrounding the incident of
intimidation involving Alexis
Clinansmith '97 and Ewart
Year wood. Many members of the
college community are unsure of the
details of the case due to conflicting
media reports and sensationalism.
With the opening of the new semester, the Phoenix staff would like to
provide the community with firsthand information from the perspective of Clinansmith and a member of
the administration.
Last November, in response to
Alexis' complaints about being
stalked by Ycarwood, the administration issued a decision requiring
that a minimum forty-fool distance
be maintained between Clinansmith
and Yearwood at all times on campus. Clinansmith was to be escorted
everywhere she went, since the College could not guarantee that
Yearwood would obey this mandate.
However, Clinansmith still felt that
her safety was in jeopardy. Upon
requesting that further measures be
taken, the administration encouraged
her to seek assistance from the
Swarthmore Township Police.

Since Yearwood did in fact violate
the active-avoidance order issued by
the College, Clinansmith's attorney
obtained a restraining order from a
Delaware County judge intended to
prevent Yearwood's presence on
campus. At the same time, the col-

lege was considering alternative disciplinary measures which were realized and subsequently became the
focus of a media blitz in early January. The program that the College
adopted required Yearwood to attend
another institution for the spring semester at the college's expense while
undergoing psychological counselling. At the end of this period, the
situation would be reassessed to determine whether Yearwood would be
allowed to return to the college for
the fall semester.
This agreement was reached between President Bloom and
Yearwood without Clinansmith's input. In fact, she claims that she was
only told that: "Ewart has recognized that he has a problem, has withdrawn from the college, and has

long time to come. The new academic building which is to be built
on the site of Parrish Annex, will not
be completed until the spring of 1996.
According to Associate VicePresident Larry Schall, the demolition of
the old building will be completed
within the next fortnight, after which
work on the new building will commence. Most of the utility wires and
pipes in the vicinity were re-laid during the summer. The new building,
which will house the Economics,
Sociology/Anthropology, and Modern Languages departments, will also
be the new site of the Credit Union. It
will be constructed of stones from the
quarry used in the building of Parrish.
Various other conveniences will
be provided, including a forum room
to be used in a similar capacity to
Bond at the present time. A recessed
alcove called North Campus Commons will serve as an informal meeting place for members of the college
community. Furthermore, there will
be a covered walkway, possibly decorated with mosaic tiles, which will
convey traffic from North Campus

Class of '98 is Welcomed
During Orientation '94
By Cathy Glasheen

Before Swarthmore College returned to the reality of classes, the
incoming class of '9B, transfer students, and exchange students attended

very expensive summer camp and
loved every minute of it. Camp
Swarthmore provided the 328 firstyear students with the opportunity to
a

enjoy the last few days of summer,
socialize with their new classmates,
and get acquainted with college life

before getting acquainted with their
biology books.
Orientation was a five-day whirlwind of activities running from August 27 to August 31 this year. Five
upperclass orientation chairpeople,
Andrew Marino, Beth Green, Andy
Feldman, Tony Cheesebrough, and
Rebecca Bennett coordinated the

that Willets really is just as nice a
place to live.
The planning of Orientation '94
began last spring and continued
through the summer. According to
Andy Feldman '96, the committee
kept three goals in mind while orchestrating the week. First, the committee hoped that Orientation would
provide new students with a sense

that Swarthmore is unique among
small, liberal arts colleges. The committee
tried to
incorporate
Swarthmore's history and Quaker
values into the lectures and work-

shops.

The second goal was to forward
the theme of concentric communities. Activities were geared for participation in groups of varying size,
such as the CA group, the dormitory,
and the entire class, in order to dem-

S8 million of the 525 million spent
on the project was donated by alumnus Jerome Kohlberg. Of the $25
million, S2O million is to be used for
construction expenses, while S5 million is to be invested and used toward
running costs.

this summer and in spite of "a difficult period during the move," ac-

cording to Schall. The Modem Languages department is reportedly
happy with the building now.
Trotter will also be renovated after
the new academic building is completed. It will feature a grand central
staircase, a skylit lounge, and more
spacious classrooms and offices. This
renovation will result in a 10% loss in
space. While the inside will be com-

pletely rebuilt, the outside will remain virtually the same as it is today.
This project is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 1997.

New Alcohol
Policy: How Will
Parties Change?
By Ben Salter
The drug and alcohol policy listed
in this year's Student Handbook is
significantly different from that of
previous years. The procedure, which
had last been modified during the
1988- 'B9 academic year, was changed
to comply with Federal Government
regulations and to respond to the
growing number of alcohol-related
disturbances on the campus. The
policy now addresses the college's
position on parties, student conduct,
and underage drinking.
Associate Dean Bob Gross noted
that the alcohol and drug policy "had
not been systematically examined in
five years, and there was a feeling
that it was becoming ragged in its
implementation." He also said that
there had been increasing concern
over parties getting out of hand and
the growing number of incidents of
sexual abuse, vandalism, and violence associated with alcohol consumption. Gross said that in the past
few years, the local borough police
have been enforcing state laws more
stringently because they felt that the
college was doing an inadequate job
and that "much of their concern was
over high school students getting into
parties." Finally, the school was
forced to change its policy to comply
with The Drug-Free Schools and
Communities Act of 1989, which requires that underage drinking be prohibited by the administration. Until
now, the Handbook had only staled
that underage drinking was against

Pennsylvania state law.
There are four principle changes
from the previous policy, according
to Dean Gross. The new policy is
more coherent, and combines the two
separate documents drawn up by the
Alcohol Committee and the Personnel Office that appeared in last year's
handbook. The new policy includes a
behavioral code, "some of which was
implicit in the old policy," said Gross.
There are also new guidelines to deal
with the "reality" of impromptu parties. "In an effort to discourage
[impromptus] we instituted a ten dollar fee and a size limit," said Gross.
Finally, the college is establishing a
program of Party Associates, or

Judicial Code Addresses Conduct Anew

By Eli Rubin
The Swarthmore Judiciary policy
determines "what is or isn't acceptable" student behavior, in the words
of Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie, is
determined. Previously, the policy
was based largely upon the belief that
Life of students should be governed
"

by good taste and accepted practice,
rather than elaborate rules," as stated
in last year's StudentHandbook. This
year, significant changes have been
made. They are the culmination of a
process intiated three years ago, in
order to address concerns over the
efficiency and consistency of the judicial process, as well as the
administration's perceived failure to
"communicate the values of the community to the students," according to

Goundie.
Goundie expresses mixed feelings
about the fact that the code has necessarily become more elaborate than in
previous years. "Part of me does not
like it," he says, "and yet, it is very

difficult for me as a Dean to sanction
a student for an offense which is not
clearly stated as an offense...also,

dent is brought up on charges when
the exact rules are not clearly stated."
Even more substantial are the
changes in the judiciary procedure.
Until this year, student offenses were
processed along one of three avenues:
•Cases of minor misconduct, such
as violation of party guidelines or
minor acts of vandalism were handled

by the Student Judiciary Committee
(SJC), comprised of six elected students.

The SJC was eliminated because,
"it had no problem finding guilt or
innocence, but had difficulty agreeing on an appropriate resolution or
punishment;" asserted Goundie, "I
was also concerned about the lack of
consistency in the SJC's policies from
semester to semester."
To address this concern, "students
on the new CJC will hold a position
of two years, and will undergo the
same training as far as what constitutes certain offenses, judicial procedure, etc," said Goundie. Matters that

Lee, co-president of the
Swarthmore Asian Organization,
was one of twenty students in the

1994 Duke Study in China Program. The program involved eight
weeks of intensive Chinese language study at Capital Normal University in Beijing and a fall semester at Nanjing University. Between
the summer course and the fall semester, students took a 12-day trip
to various cultural and historical
sites, including HuKou Waterfall.
At the waterfall, Lee found a
place to sit and take pictures. She
joined her friends at the upper level
where they were all sitting, then
went back down to take more photographs. Descending, she slipped
and fell into the turbulent water. At
least two students saw her fall and
quickly ran downstream hoping to
spot her. They searched for several
hours without success.
Authorities asked people within
sixty-five kilometers of the waterfall to look for a body, and began
searching nearby waters with two
boats. The search halted at nightfall, but resumed the next morning
at dawn. The assistant director, with
three of Lee's closest friends, stayed

The day after he heard of his
daughter's accident, Genevieve's
father called Dean Ngina Lythcott
in the middle of the night to say he
was "unsure about the intensity of
the search for her [Lee's] body."
He wanted the search effort to triple.
Lythcott immediately called President Al Bloom, and Bloom called
the Department of State and the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing to emphasize the importance of finding Lee's

body as quickly as possible.
Lythcott also telephoned the president, deans, and provost al Duke
University to urge them to take the

same action. Bloom called James

that the authorities were doing all
they could.

Jack Schcctcr '96, a Student Council

mainly just enforcing the old policy.
There are definitely still some points
that need fine tuning. Our main goal
was to stay away from where we were
heading: intervention by the Swat police and concerned residents. We had
to show that we were taking some
positive action, to meet them halfway.
It will mean some minor inconveniences, such as strict I.D. checking,
and enforcement of party permits."

Lee, an Economics major, was
also concentrating in Computer
Science and Public Policy. In addition to serving as co-president of
SAO, she was active in Women of
Color and the Student Housing

Committee.
To Brian Wong '96, SAO's copresident and Lee's friend since
their first year, she was someone
whom he "came to know and respect for her ability to point out
truths" that others did not see or
were too timid to point out. "She
was honest and frank, a calm and conscientious individual who will always
speak her mind," Wong recalled.
Others like Tonet Santos '95, a
friend and SAO member, thought
of Genevieve as "quiet." But in
SAO, she was "very active and vocal about her heritage, and Asian
issues were very important to her."

Dean Lythcott agreed, saying,
"Genevieve was a person who cared

deeply about the important things
that affected people's lives." Not
only that, but she also "worked with
many students of different cultures
to change those things."

Genevieve was

not always so se-

rious. Myrt Westphal, Director of
Residential Life, who got to know
Genevieve through the Student
Housing Committee, still recalls the
jokes that she shared with Lee. Lee
was someone with whom she could
"let down her hair" when others
were very serious. Nina Santos '97
remembers the time she and
Genevieve "took the red trays and
spent the next hour traying down
Parrish lawn in [their] pajamas" on

winter night. Even though
Genevieve Lee has passed away,

her legacy still lives on in the memories of her friends. For such friends

but was also felt throughout the College, especially the administration.
The prospect of seeing a conflict
within the college played out on a
national stage was a drain on the
administration. Vice President for
Alumni Development and Public
Relations Harry Gotwalscommented
that, "I'm a little concerned...
and
I'm not saying this is a normal situation
but every time two students
have a problem, if it takes all that
much effort because it gets into the
press and the courts, it's going to be

Clinansmith considered accepting an offer of admission to
Harvard University, largely based on
whether or not Yearwood would return. In July, she decided to remain at
Swarthmore because she was told
that Yearwood would remain at Boston University and she did not want
mester,

to move closer to him.

On August Blh, Yearwood expressed possible interest inreturning
to Swarthmore. This was contrary to
an assertion he made in an article in

the January 14th issue of the New
York Times that "Swarthmore is the
last place I'd want to be after what
has happened." In keeping with the
original agreement, the college provided for psychological testing to
determine whether it was appropriate
for him to return. After an evaluation

Some changes were made from pre-

This year, new students received their

making move-in day a lot easier on the
new students and on the CAs.
But a more significant improv ement,
according to Orientation committee
member Tony Cheesebrough, was the

Cheesebrough said
that much of the
success of Orientation '94 was due
to "CAs who were
more confident because of the train-

The response to
Swarthmore's orientation program

from the class of

Gotwals, the administration approved
his possible return on August 28th.
Even before this decision was
reached, Clinansmith's attorney filed

Clinansmith, is her main objective;
she asserts that reports of a suit for
$lOO,OOO in damages are false.
According to Gotwals, Yearwood
would "enjoy the challenge of
Swarthmore, but had felt comfortable at Boston University," the institution which he attended last semester. Last Friday, Yearwood indicated
his desire to remain at Boston University, although Clinansmith has not
been able to obtain written documentation of his withdrawal from
Swarthmore. Nevertheless, it seems
that both Clinansmith and the administration are presently considering that
the call for the emergency injunction
may be revoked.
This situation has been difficult
for all parties involved. One of the
concerns raised by Gotwals is that
"the college's process for deciding
student cases is a college-defined
process; it's meant to be as fair as it
can to all involved, and it is not meant
to be pari of the external legal system." He encourages students to consider that "going to the media immediately with a problem may not be in
their own best interests." With considerations like this in mind, the college community may be better able to
handle situations of a similar nature

New York subway, and Chicago's

The first week I witnessed one of
the most peculiar of daily rituals:
carpenters and corporate lawyers
alike would approach the closing
doors of a subway like Roger Bannister—arms outstretched, their
bodies arching towards the porthole, faces contorted in sweaty grimaces. Inside the Metro, aside from
the heavy breathing of the newfound track stars, it was as quiet as
a public library. Eye contact and
verbal communication were both
taboo. Accidental glances were met
with "who, me?" stares or a ner-

vous smile; some avoided even this
minor contactby shielding theirfaces
with copies of the Washington Post.

Swarthmore education is at the least
a long term investment, and, in some

though, this grumbling reaches a
point where it can no longer be

At first Gonesh was reluctant to

He told me the only reason why he

because I came from Dhaka and his

He assumed I studied in Dhaka. I

Bangladesh rivers.
Bangladesh was created by the
sediments deposited by a mighty
river system. The Bengali people
smell, see, eat and often die with the
rivers; a major portion of our culture
is river-oriented.
I travelled down and around several rivers. I saw fishermen, their
ribs jutting out, waiting patiently,
enduring the impossible heat for a
little glimpse of silver scales, pulling
the long nets in and out, their eyes
tired and hopeful. I saw the women
standing by the Guava trees, shielding their eyes to catch a glimpse of
familiar dinghies.

gave way to a soothing evening

fishermen to return home, I met

Liberty Bell. The Manhattan native spent pre-

Prior

to the

vious summers as a camp counselor in New
York state, yet had never taken a science
course and in her words, "might have had trouble pointing out the north star."
For these reasons, Perry, a senior English
major with a women's studies concentration,
still finds it hard to believe that just three
weeks ago she was leading hikes past herds of
bison, explaining logistics of cricket mating
positions, and falling asleep to coyotes howl-

ing in Badlands National Park.
Perry places the origins of her summer in
South Dakota in a conversation with a close
friend, who told her of a program that would
allow her to spend a summer working in a park
on the western plains. Perry had been there
vicariously through the literature of Native
American writers she had read in her
American Literature seminar.
Even though Perry's wilderness experience
until then had amounted to occasional walks in
the Crum, she sent away for a catalogue of
Student Conservation Association positions
available in national parks. Of the hundreds of
job descriptions she read, only three contained

liberal arts buzz phrases such as, "good communication skills," and the "ability to work
well with others."
With the application deadline fast approaching. Perry chose a fourth location in a hurry as
a long shot —Badlands National Park. The
phone rang early Sunday morning one week
later, and a strange voice calling from South
Dakota offered her a job.
Two weeks later, she received a package
with a small green swab of cloth instructing
her to buy pants of "this" color along with a
pair of sturdy hiking boots. Two days after her
last final, Perry got in her car with four tapes
and a few belongings and headed west.
Perry arrived at a place that she says
"looked like the moon," and seemed utterly
devoid of people. After tracking down a ranger
and settling into a small apartment, she began
a rigorous two week training course during
which she learned her way about the park and
some basics

in first aid from

career park ser-

vice rangers.
At the end of the two weeks, Perry was
working stints at the visitor center giving
directions and leading 10 mile hikes into the
wilderness. "I spent a lot of time in those first
two weeks going to other rangers' hikes and
slide shows because I wanted to be able to
show people interesting things on my hikes,"
she says with a smile.

Perry explains that her urban background
perhaps made her guiding easier; "I had never

watch whole thunderstorms and tornadoes
develop twenty miles away and pass across
the edge of the horizon without ever being
touched by wind or rain... unlike many people
there, I had never seen anything quite like it."
In time off, Perry would indulge in the
beauty of the surrounding area, exploring the
Black Hills or learning about astronomy by
observing night skies that would make most
astronomers foam at the mouth.
Perry describes her company of park

Perry went through with the show and

appreciation to indignation, "I learned almost

people only dream to vacation are of an interesting breed and have given a lot of thought to
their vocation." With 85 miles to the nearest

placed

on conver-

sation and immersion in the spirit of the land.

Perry's biggest responsibility came in an
opportunity to lead an outdoor slide show
about anything she thought worthy of 300
travelers' attention. As she describes, "I was
shown the park library and slide file and told 1

Perry decided to focus on the lives of the

initial research," she remarked.
Perry has experienced mixer emotions in
as much

returning to school: "I realized more new
kinds of learning that never occurred in a
classroom and I feel like a whole new way of
learning has been opened up for me."

However, Perry has no regrets abou
mer that used to seem incongruous to
demic schedule this year; "the experiences I
had this summer have informed my ideas
about teaching and will help me appreciate the
limitations of classroom learning."
Learning methodology is more than just a
consumer interest for Perry, who will receive
her certification to teach English this spring.
America's schools will have to wait for this
qualified teacher, though. Perry's current postgraduation plans are to find a job in the park
service.
Having been set on a teaching job, Perry
says she doesn't mind the low pay. After all,
"being a park ranger you take pay in sunsets."

What did you do
over the summer?
A Phoenix survey

of 482 Swatties found out.

Of the 482 surveyed, 53% were
female, 47% were male. The most
popular activity was listed as "other,"
while the least number of people
worked in the food service industry.
Other popular activities included
interships and manual labor jobs.
Swatties spent, on average, 59 days at
home (47% were at home for the
entire summer), and 19% travelled at
least part pf the summer. Females
made on average $270 more than
males for the summer, and the overall
average income was $1,397.

From those who had their way right away working at the local BK to the
summer abroad in Italy, everyone came home this September to the familar Parrish beach lawn chairs.

Dan Gallant's road to Swarthmore.
By Fred Bush
Nine Inch Nails and

a novel,

Australian tap dancers and the
Washington Post, the Smithsonian
and jazz piano: Dan Gallant '9B, a
native of Rockville, MD, has certainly taken an original path to

Swarthmore.
Gallant started drama at a very
young age—even before he started
school. A little later in first grade,
he started playing soccer and the
piano. Since then, he's acted in
professional productions, played
varsity soccer, and taught himself
jazz piano.
Also a writer, Gallant wrote editorials and creative pieces regularly

for his high school paper. He has
visited the offices of the
Washington Post and met Bob
Woodward, one of the journalists
who broke the Watergate story.
His ambition is to publish the
400-page novel he's written based
on the people he's known or met.

One summer. Gallant worked at

hand-made chain mail armor, a
biker gang who liked to wear handcuffs, and Yanni's drummer.
Needless to say, the clientele was
more interesting than the music.
Another
summer,
Gallant
worked at the Smithsonian, where
he did research for a curator, and

helped on a Japanese television
show about US presidents. Other
work will be on display in a new
exhibit on Asian immigration in the
Museum of Natural History.
Gallant's most inspiring trip was
abroad to London, where he was
treated to some unusual music at
the changing of the guard .at

Buckingham Palace:
"The band, the Queen's band,
started playing Beatles' songs
because the Queen wasn't around.
They must have played all of Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band."
Not only did he hear the Beatles
performed in their native country,
he visited a huge film museum

Okay, let's go on.
It was not, of course, until I myself
began the training to become a
Writing Associate that I truly began to
understand the magnitude of my sin.
It was not until I myself was forced
to read page after page of articles entitled things like "Love Your WAee
and He Will Love You," "Zen and the
Art of the Red Pen," and "I'm Okay,
You're Okay, But This Sentence Is a

4:00 p.m. on FRIDAY that I realized
my salvation was in peril and my stay

arduous one.
So, in order lo save you, my
beloved Swatners in crime, from my
fate, I will offer you some lips to

Romance on the Roof

Imagine you have a date.
Don't strain yourself, but try.
What would you do? If you're an
average Swarthmore student and
you don't have a car the possibili-

ties seem limited.
You could go to Rcnato's and
share the magic of piz/.a and sodas
with the 'Ville rats. You could go
to Oldc Club, and spend the
evening straining to understand
your date as he or she whispers in
your ear.
Though the situation is more
promising at the Jumping Cow and
Paces, there are few obvious
answers besides catching a train to

Philly.
Or so it seems.
Some resourceful students have

use for romantic walks and picnics.
'The nice thing about the Crum
is that it's right there. You don't
have to plan or anything; you just
head right in. You can have anything from a quiet ramble to a picnic to an impromptu swim," Sonya
Smallcts '96 said.
Other favorite spots are officially off-limits. The roofs of numerous
buildings (most notably
Parrish) have maginificenl views,
lots of privacy, and the tantalizing
lure of the forbidden. The spacious
room underneath Parrish Dome,
while full of graffitti and old beer
bottles, provides privacy, a view,
protection from the elements, and
the threat of being caught by security if your lights are noticed.

Preseason Update...

In his freshman year at PermState University, Larry Perry was a member of the first
Eastern team ever to be ranked number one
in the nation in men's volleyball. After a
year serving as assistant coach to the Pcnn
State women's team. Perry has taken over as
head coach at Swarthmore. Coach Perry's
playing experience will be vital in reshaping
a team that lost three key players to graduation last year. This year's on-court leader
will be captain Rachel McKaig '95. "We're
relying heavily on her; she's the tallest, has
the most ball control, and is our biggest

offensive weapon," said Coach Perry. Fellow captains Mary Beiler '95 and Yvonne
Lui '95 will also be key offensive players.
Anchoring the back line will be Laura Pitman '96. The team's next home match is on
Tuesday, September 13 against Western
Maryland at 7:00 in thcTarblc Gymnasium.
David Lischer

Men's Tennis
This weekend the men's tennis team will
travel to Bloomsburg University in northern
Pennsylvania for an annual tournament. The
Bandits will have a total of eight singles players
and four doubles teams competing in single
elimination play. This year's team looks to be
the strongest Swat has put together in the last
couple of years. "This year our players have
matured and have the mental edge that they
might not have had before, when they were less
experienced. The team is all upperclassmen,"
says Captain Chris Ciunci. The fall season,
though short, is viewed as an important physical and mental warm-up for the longer spring
season.
With the return of senior Jeremy
Shweder in the Spring, the Bandits will have a
solid line-up and will be a strong national
contender.

Men's Rugby
The Evil Buzzard Rugby Cult, the
Swarthmore men's rugby team, is ranked second in the EPRU (Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby
Union) after last year's successful fall (4-2) and
spring (6-1) seasons. Led by senior captains
Mike "Captain Crunch" Madden and Darin
"Speak softly and make big kicks" Freiss, the
team is ready to use its quickness, strategy, and
superior intellect to overcome its typically larger

opponents. Madden, the forward captain, is
preaching a new strategy that will add more
flexibility and speed to forward play. The back
line, now playing its second full year together,
will be the most dangerous in the EPRU. Having lost only two starters, this fall's rugby
players are ready to tackle the EPRU and claim
their long-overdue division rugby champion-

ship.

Football
After weeks of preseason practice, this
year's Garnet Tide looks strong. Captains
Dave Reeser '95, Mark Fink '95, Pete
Steelman '95, and Eric Williams '95 spearhead a strong senior class whh the talent and
experience to contend for the Centennial

Football Conference title. At the offensive
helm is quarterback Patrick Straub '97, who
should get plenty of protection behind an
offensive line with five returning starters.
Rounding out the offense, David Reeser '95
and Nick Milligan '96 lead a powerful ground
attack. The Garnet defense is led by a corps
of defensive backs with four returning starters, including standouts Mark Fink '95 and
Tim Henderson '95. Linebackers Eric Williams '95 and Jim Hunt '95, along with
imposing defensive linemen Nate Hegedus
'95 and Kurk Selverian '97, should frustrate
the running attacks of most of the Garnet's
opposition this season. The season opener
will be played this weekend against Earlham
College in Indiana. The home opener against
John Hopkins will be next Saturday on Clothier Field.

Ultimate Frisbee
Both the women's and men's Ultimate
frisbee teams have gotten off to positive starts.
Participation is up from last season, and one
new ultimate player noted his appreciation
for the team's receptiveness to new, inexperienced players. The captains of the men's
team this season are Matt Robison '95 and
Robin Mandel '97. The women's captains
are Courtney Harter '97, Carrie Harp '95, and
Katy Harrod '97. Lisa Meenen is welcomed
by both teams to Swat as a coach and mentor.

Ingrid Spies '96, Sophie Beckham '97, Amy
Klosterman '97, Daniella Learner '96, Stacy
Nakel '96, and Claire Farrel '97. Seven
newcomers join the team, including the promising Danielle Wall '9B. "Everyone is working hard and looking forward to the start of the

Conquering the U.S. Open
By Hunter Gelhbach

Rapidly becoming one of the most difficult
in sports to obtain tickets for, the U.S.
Open is no longer an event merely to be attended. At the National Tennis Center one
must compete for every inch. Propei viewing
of the Open has become an art form to be
mastered, much like the game of tennis itself.
Naturally the first hurdle is getting inside the
grounds themselves. In my own personal encounter with the United States Tennis
Association's most prestigious event, I used a
little Swattie nepotism to get me through the
pearly iron gates. Calling upon Dan Oppenheim
'96, who just so happened to be a touring
umpire this summer, I asked him, "Oppie, whatever would you be up to during the U.S. Open?"
He replied, "Well I'm working the whole two
events

weeks

and

you're coming to visit."
my slow, deliberate

"LetmethinkYES." was

response.
Now a point ofclarification. I jumped at the
chance to go to the Open under these conditions, not because of the extremely reduced
ticket price, but for the intellectual opportunity
it presented. Being a typical Swarthmore College Poster Boy, I wanted more stimulation for
my weekend than just watching tennis. I wanted
to view tennis from the perspective of "the
other", in this case the umpire. No more would
I cheer for Chang, Agassi, or Sampras. Instead
I would gleefully applaud my friend's long,
low, primitive, unintelligible, bellowing
ennunciation of "out". With a hyper-critical
eye, I would deconstruct the audience's reaction to every line call.
Getting one's ticket is hard enough, but getting seats at individual matches can be as difficult as convincing Swarthmore's professors
that they don't need to assign you that extra 200

pages of reading. The catch-22 is that you can
get great views of bad matches or you can stop
up that nose-bleed and watch little specks on
the court who are reputed to be the best players
in the world. To have the best of both worlds,
you have to have a large money clip and a knack
for spotting bribable ushers or ride that connec-

tion wave one more time. Our boy Dan was
blessed with a large red photo i.d. pass. It read
"umpire" and translated, "I'm more important
than you, so step off." By saying little more
than, "I'm with him," I was able to mingle with
the important folk from Heineken, Fuji Film,
and Chase Manhattan Bank (all of whom have
luxury boxes).
Anyone who has been to the Open knows
that all the "work"requires sustenance. Food is
the next obstacle to overcome. Being a college
student automatically disqualifies you from
being able to afford anything that would satiate
you. (Tarble's 51.25 12oz. drinks look like a
going out of business sale there). Once again,
one needs a workable connection. This time
my membership with the USTA combined with
impeccable timing did the trick. As one of the
sponsors, the USTA just happened to offer
drinks and snacks for members. It was an
appreciated and unforeseen bonus
membership has its privileges.
The lesson
connections will get you very
far. As I was waiting in the umpires' lounge,
preparing to depart from the National Tennis
Center, my attention was drawn by a Tasmanian Devil-like cloud of reporters bearing
down
hard on me. Diving out of harm's way, I
realized they were surprisingly more preoccupied in photographing Andre Agassi and Brooke
Shields than in interviewing me. Reporters
surrounded the security guards who surrounded
the couple. I suddenly realized thai 1 was glad
my connections weren't too high-profile.

Hockey Returns from Pre-Season Tour In England
By Jen Philpott

The Field Hockey team was conspicuously absent from the fall preseason at Swarthmore this year.
The entire team and coaching staff,
with the exception offour students,
traveled to England on August 17
for an intensive training trip. They
returned, weary but much improved, on August 30, just in time
for classes and the more mundane
aspects of student life- such as unpacking.
The team stayed at a boarding
school in Uppingham, England for
eight days during which time they
had a rigorous practice schedule
(six to eight hours a day), enjoyed
some of the village pubs, and
mingled with the residents. While
staying in Uppingham, the team
was fortunate enough to have their
photo taken by the President of the

Royal Photographic Society (appointed by Her Majesty, The Queen,
of course), as he was participating in
a conference in the

area.

In between

training sessions, scrimmages against
very experienced Club teams, and
meals, the twenty-six hockey players
fit in time to tour the area. One
afternoon was spent in Stratford-

Upon-Avon and Warwick Castle,
another in Oxford, and a lovely
evening was spent at an outdoor performance ofThe Merchant of Venice.
The team's Head Coach, Richard
Kentwell, a native of England, allowed the players a brief respite from
hockey on the ninth day of the trip,
which was spen; in London.
The final portion of the team's tour
took them to Southampton where they
participated in an international tournament and were pitted against teams
of very high caliber. Although the
Swarthmore team was not victorious

Chuck Hudson pitched for ihe Sussex
County Commerce, a semi-pro baseball team
in Delaware, over the summer. The team
finished 28-9, winning the Eastern Shore Baseball League. Though Hudson was one of only
two NCAA Division ID players on the Commerce, he amassed impressive statistics: in 39
innings of pitching, he struck out 28 batters and
walked just 15, while allowing 31 hits. Hudson
appeared in 15 games and finished with a 4-1
record, 2 saves and a 1.97 ERA.
"I enjoyed being able to continue playing.
Hopefully the extra experience will help with
the upcoming season," said Hudson.

in the tournament, their improved
skill level was apparent, even against
British teams that play at the national
level. In Kentwell's opinion, even a
Division I field hockey team from the
United States would not have made it
to the final round in this tournament.
The team, their Head Coach, and
the Assistant Coach, Annie Feller,
planned and organized this training
trip far in advance. Fund raising
efforts began as early as January of
1994 and the players worked hard
selling t-shirts, raffle tickets, and signing up sponsors for a run-a-thon. The
players also worked on their fitness
over the summer by following an
exercise program prepared by their
coach. Richard Kentwell was pleased
with the results of everyone's hard
work both before and daring the trip.
"Everyone worked hard and we
learned a lot. We feel confident going into our regular season this year,"

commented Kentwell. Kentwell's
sentiments were echoed by the ma-

Men's Soccer Kicks Back Into
Centennial Conference Play
By Matt Peck

The 1994 Men' s Soccer season got
off to a strong start as the squad
challenged two Division II teams and
Division I Villanova University this
week. Last weekend, the squad split
its matches, defeating the University
of Pittsburg, Johnstown 4-0 and losing to Westchester University 0-1 at
the Westchester Tournament. Then,
on Wednesday, the Garnet lost to the
Wildcats of Villanova 3-1 despite a
gritty defensive effort.
In a dazzling offensive display,

Swarthmore outshot the University
of Pittsburgh, Johnstown 16-3.
Sophomore striker David Lane, who
scored two goals, led the barrage.
Amber Thompson '97 and midfielder
Lenny Cuello '96 also scored for the
Garnet while co-captain Ben Cook
'95 had two assists and co-captain
Nate Fairman '95 and midfielder Jay
Rose '95 each had one.
The disparity in shot attempts, of
course, must be attributed to the
mighty Garnet defense headed by
sophomore goal ies S hawn B undy and
Will Delauny. Unfortunately, the
defense lost one of its most important
cogs when its stopper, co-captain
Jesse Murphy '95, was injured in the
first half. Murphy may be out for the
season. Instead of a traditional stopper defense, Head Coach Wayne
McKinney has gone with two backs—
Cook and Dave McCauley '97—in a
four back zone-like defensive alignment.
Perhaps because of the new mix of
personnel and perhaps because of
some alleged uneven officiating, the
Garnet was denied victory over
Westchester. The only scoring in the
match came early in the first half
when the Westchester striker escaped
inside the 18 foot box on the left side
and sent a shot deep into the lower
right hand corner of the Swarthmore
net.
After this early strike, the
Westchester defense packed the
midfield, playing with five
midfielders, andstymied the Garnet's
ball-control offense. However, as

Swat began to introduce more long
sideline passes, the offense generated some nice scoring chances that
came just short of yielding goals.
In the end, Westchester outshot the
Garnet 15-7, but the second half
total was an even 4-4.
For most of Wednesday's battle

against Villanova, it appeared that
Swarlhmore would claim victory.
After surviving a sloppy first half
which was salvaged by the fine
goal keeping of Bundy and the stellar play of the defensive backs—
Cook, McCauley, Derrick Johnson
'96 and Ben Wagsden '9B—the
Garnet scored the first goal of the
match in the 63rd minute. Rose
broke free out of the midfield and
found Krister Johnson '95 on the
left side of the box. Johnson then
assisted an open Fairman at the
right side of the net. With the
momentum on Swarthmore's side,
the midfielders packed in the defense. However, the congestion
resulted in a couple of errant passes
and defensive breakdowns that

quickly led to three Villanova goals
in a six minute period. With emotions high, Swarthmore tried to retaliate, but was stopped by an exceptionally aggressive and physical
Wildcat defense.
Considering Swarthmore's fine
efforts against superior competition,
Garnet soccer fans should have much
to cheer about in the upcoming season as the team strives for a Centennial Conference championship and
an NCAA bid. Last year, the team
just missed an invition to the big
dance. This year's squad has returned a lot of depth and experience
at almost every position. This
season's key matches will come
against conference rivals Haverford
and Gettysburg, and the team's schedule also includes a trip north to Maine
where they will face Bates and Colby.
The squad's next match is away at
Stonybrook on Saturday, and their
next home game is Monday against
Eastern College at 4:00 PM.

Soccer's
Slow Start
By Lauren Jacobi
The Swarihmore Women's Soccer
team is looking forward to a
sucesssful season this year, despite
the outcome of their first two games.
With fourteen new players, the team
is adjusting to different individual
styles. The game plan has shifted to
two forwards, five midfielders and
three backs, which allows the team to
utilize the width of the field.
After two preseason wins over
York College and Beaver College,
the team lost their last two games
against Montclair University and
Goucher College. Despite the loss
against Goucher, "the team played
with intensity and consistency," remarked
Head Coach Cheri
Goetcheus. "Heather [Maloney] had
an outstanding defensive game, and
Claire [Baxter] was very solid," said
Goetcheus. Captains Bess O'Neil
and Mary Catherine Arbour have been
leading the team energetically since
preseason. Said O'Neil of team play,
"Our season looks good. We have an
unusual arrangement with half the
team being rookies, but we have lots
of potential. We look belter than we
have in the past."
The next home game is on Wednesday, September 14 at 4:00 pm on the
newly expanded and grub free Clothier field.
