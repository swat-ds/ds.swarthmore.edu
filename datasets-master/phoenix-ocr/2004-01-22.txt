Poor ventilation poses health risk

Breathing is often taken for granted. But
students whose classes meet in
Beardsley, it has become more than just a
simple reflex. Art history and studio art professors say ventilation problems are making
art history classes uncomfortable and studio
art classes dangerous.
Lack of adequate ventilation in both the

concern to professors and students for over
a decade. Art history professor Michael

Art history major Claire Ruud 'O4 said
the situation is'disgusting" and "you can

you're looking at slides. Or breathe."
Ventilation is even more important in
the other studios, where toxic fumes are
often present. Inhaling paint and paint thinners can cause headaches, dizziness and respiratory problems, according to
the
Princeton Art Safety Training Guide.
Meunier said media used in ceramic classes

ignore.
Two months ago, the college acknowledged his complaints. It has evaluated renovation costs and is trying to prioritize the
most critical projects.
Cothren said he had always been confident that the college would eventually fix the
problem. "Our sense was that if members of
the administration knew, they'd do something about it," he said.
Art department chair Brian Meunier also
expressed concern over the ventilation problem. He said he first heard of the problem in
the middle of last semester from art history
students and informed Registrar Martin
Warner about the problem in an effort to
move classes to other rooms.
Cothren said ventilation in Beardsley
was more crucial than in other buildings

because both art history and studio art
classes require proper air circulation.

must be closed and covered to see the

Veronica
Betancourt 'O6, who is enrolled in the printmaking class, said she felt the condition of
Beardsley limited the learning that went
on there. "To have that sort of restriction
because we don't have adequate facilities is
frustrating," she said.

Meunier said problems with ventilation
were especially critical in the photo studios on the third floor of Beardsley, particularly when temperatures were high in
September and May. The rooms do not
have air conditioning, and the darkroom's
windows do not open. Meunier said temperatures in the photo studios have become
"brutal" and "almost unbearable" in the
past. In extreme heat, chemicals used in
photo processing become much more hazardou. Meunier has had to cancel class twice
because of the heat problems.
Studio art major Emily Alvarez 'O4 said

just have to put up with. At least, we're putting up with it," Alvarez said.
But Cothren will not be putting up with

Smaller enrollment creates big room shuffle
BY MEGO LIEN

mlienl@swarthmore.edu

The December housing lottery ended with an excess of
over 30 rooms for this semester, in contrast to the housing
lottery in April that left more students on the waiting list
than ever before.
The extra space allowed returning students more
choice in room selection and gave those unhappy with
their fall residences the chance to switch rooms. The college also gave students living in overflow housing the
opportunity to move.
Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal said more students studied abroad during the spring semester than in
the fall this year, a return to the historical pattern that
existed prior to the past few years.
"The last two springs [were] jam-packed," Westphal said.
This semester, over 100 students graduated, decided not to
return or went abroad, in contrast to about 60 in the fall.
The housing shortage following last year's lottery
forced many juniors to live in doubles, and other students
were placed in emergency housing such as the Dana and

THE PHOENIX

Hallowell lounges, Whittier Place, Field House Lane and
the seventh floor of Strath Haven.
Westphal said most of the students living in overflow
residencies will not return to traditional dorms because
she did not want to "disrupt people's lives," and because
the rooms were found to be satisfactory.
Orphaned juniors were allowed to keep their doubles to
themselves, with the exception of Dana well lounge residents. Westphal said she had hoped to change converted
Danawell dorm rooms back to lounges this semester and
had requested that students living in the rooms move to different rooms. "It's an unhappy situation," she said. Having
no lounges "inhibits residential life and hall gatherings."
Willets basement resident John Egan 'O6 and his roommate Andrew Skemer 'O6 volunteered to move from their
converted lounge into singles so that the hall could have a
lounge space again. Egan said that, when properly
equipped with couches and entertainment, lounges "connect people" and help students, particularly first-years,
make friends.
"It wasn't that big of a hassle [to move]," Egan said. "It's
just the pain that you want it to be. And if it is for the

January 22,

2004

greater good [of the hall], then that's even better."
Many Danawell juniors, however, refused to relinquish
their doubles for singles simply for the sake of having
lounges in their halls. Despite Westphal's attempts at persuasion, Dana RA Adil Nure 'O5 said, many students are not
moving. "Anyone in their right mind wouldn't," she added.
Having lived in Dana last year, as well, Nure said, "there
[wasn't] a big a need to make a lounge." In contrast to
Wharton's centralized lounges, the gathering spaces in
Dana and Hallo well "are isolated and pretty much like
rooms themselves," he said.
The excess rooms left 30 to 40 spaces empty and many
more orphaned students, Westphal said. Some students,
such as Casey Baines 'O6, quickly took advantage of the
open beds. Unhappy with her Strath Haven room, Baines
secured a room on the first floor of Willets after its previous occupant went abroad.
Westphal said she expects "a flurry of room-change
requests," especially this weekend, as students settle into
the new semester. However, she reminded students to be
patient, as room changes are "carefully considered decisions," prioritized by seniority and individual situations.

Students watch the State of the Union address on Tuesday night in the fifth floor Parrish lounge.

Bush speech provokes skepticism
BY CAROLINE GRUBBS
cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

In the final State of the Union address of his

term, President George W. Bush defended his
record in Iraq and the economy and sharply refuted critics of his policies. He also asked Congress
to make permanent earlier tax cuts and a revised
U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act, which would expand police
powers for the purpose of anti-terrorism. In addi-

tion, he outlined a new immigration policy which
allows some undocumented workers to temporarily but legally remain in the United States.
The war on terrorism occupied the first half of
the president's address. Bush presented the

achievements of his administration's aggressive
"the once all-powerful ruler of
foreign policy
Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison
cell"
while cautioning that "terrorists continue
to plot against America and the civilized world."
In response to critics of the war in Iraq, Bush
said, "Let us be candid about the consequences of
leaving Saddam Hussein in power." He cited an
inspections report on Hussein's weapons plans,
arguing that "had we failed to act, the dictator's
weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day." He did not say that the report
had not uncovered any actual weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.
Bush argued that, while contributions from
international partners in the war were appreciated, objections from abroad would not affect the
United States' course. "America will never seek a
permission slip to defend the security of our country," he said.
The president moved on to his domestic agenda, which includes a new temporary worker program that would allow undocumented immigrants to labor legally for a period of time. He
also touched on increased funding to community
colleges, a stronger stance on teen drug issues, a
plan to privatize health care and a new budget
that will "cut the deficit in half over the next five
years."
In regard to the last point, economics professor
Thomas Dee said that "it's hard to take that claim
very seriously," since cutting taxes means a
decrease in revenues, which seems to contradict
his claim to reduce the deficit. A Congressional
Budget Office report projected that making the tax
cuts permanent would cost "more than $1 trillion
over the next decade," according to The New'York
Times.
Political analysts said the speech marked an
opening to President Bush's re-election bid and
offered a glimpse of his campaign agenda. Many of
the criticisms to which he was responding originated in the Democratic presidential primary con-

test.
"Tax policy is going to be one of the defining
and dividing issues of the presidential campaign,"
economics professor Stephen O'Connell said. "It

4

wouldn't be a problem if Bush would be willing to
raise taxes. The only other way to make it happen
is to be optimistic about economic growth. That's
the Arnold Schwarzenegger solution."
The most controversial aspect of the speech was
Bush's assertion that he would back a constitu-

tional amendment prohibiting same-sex mar-

riages. In a forceful denunciation of these unions
sparked by a recent ruling of the Massachusetts

Supreme Court legalizing them, Bush said, "On an
issue ofsuch great consequence, the people's voice
must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their
arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative
left to the people would be the constitutional
process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of
marriage."
"Who are these 'people' he's talking about?"
Rebecca Benjamin 'O7 asked. "It's not the federal
government's responsibility to regulate marriage
based on Bush's religious beliefs
same-sex marriage, whether he agrees with it personally or not,
should not be something he can ban with a constitutional amendment."
Bush's domestic policies were also met with
skepticism by some students. "He was really vague
in saying how he planned to cut the cost of health
care," Emily Wisfar 'O6 said. "He was adamant
about how privatized health care was the way to
go, but he didn't make a case for it."
Harris Kornstein 'O6 found the president's call
for professional athletes to act as examples in the
area of drug prevention oddly specific. "It was
strange that he put so much emphasis on sports
stars and was vaguer on education," Kornstein
said.
President Bush did not mention a new initiative, announced this week, to build a program to
take humans to Mars by 2030. He also did not discuss .the Israel-Palestine conflict or the ongoing
negotiations over interim government policies in
Iraq and Afghanistan. While he discussed the war
on terrorism, he did not mention Osama bin Laden
by name.
Much ofBush's speech, described as a "vigorous
*and sometimes combative defense" by The
Washington Post, was in response to arguments
raised by Democrats vying to oppose him in reelection. "There are two different worlds here,"
presidential primary candidate Sen. John Kerry
said after the speech. "[There is] the world the
president talks about and the world that
Americans are living."
"As a nation, we must show our greatness, not
just our strength," House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi said in the Democratic response. "America
must be a light to the world, not just a missile."

design is still appropriate for current uses of the rooms."
According to Schall, when

Hasbrouck and the consultant
then received a report of what
renovations the art department
wanted and got an estimate for
the work. The estimated costs
were very high, Schall said.
"It's complicated. It's not paint
and carpet," Schall said. "There's
a whole process to get things like
this approved. This is hundreds
of thousands of dollars worth of
work."
Because of the high estimated
costs, Hasbrouck and the design
consultant are trying to prioritize
concerns to determine what needs
to be done at this time. "We recently spent time with the department
"reassessing how the rooms are
used," she said. "Now we are going

Schall said ventilation renova-

tions were more complicated and
more expensive than any other

kind of building maintenance project. The expense may prove to be a
major deterrent since the college
already has three major construction priorities: the Science Center,
the Parrish renovations and the
new dorm. "That's restricted what
we've done in other areas," Schall
said.
But Cothren is still optimistic.
"I would hope that even if the college decides it would be impossi-

ble to build a new building, it
would commit to making the facilities at least adequate," he said.

Iowa caucus draws Board of Managers names
Mather first female chair
student interest
BY TERESA KELLEY

tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu

With Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's win in lowa on Monday,
the national media is turning its attention to the self-described
"Comeback Kerry," while others, including Swarthmore students
and professors, are questioning whether lowa's caucuses merit
such sway.
The Democratic National Convention this July will be mere
ceremony, with the "real drama" happening in the primaries and
caucuses on the state level, political science professor Rick
Valelly said.
Kerry's success in lowa has thrust him into the spotlight, yet
according to political science professor Keith Reeves 'BB, he must
be even more cautious as the campaigning process continues.
Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who Reeves said was
"anointed by media as a frontrunner" in lowa, finished third in
that state, partially because he became the target of media
attacks, said Reeves. The lowa caucuses have proved that "Dean
is not as invincible as some people believed" and have marked the
end of the race for Missouri Rep. Richard Gephart, who withdrew
after receiving unexpectedly low support, Reeves said. This year's
is an extremely competitive race, and the Democratic nomination
is far from decided.
"In politics, things can and do change," and the presidential
nomination race is "very fluid at this point with lots of variables
still in flux," Reeves said.

Barbara Mather '65, a 21-year veteran of the Board
of Managers, was named the first female chair of the
board in Swarthmore's history in December. She
replaced J. Lawrence Shane '56.
Mather, who has served on the board since 1983,
said her main goal is "keeping Swarthmore as a top
educational institution." Mather sees her role as the

man."

The new board members are joined by Anna
Orgera 'B3 and Jed Rakoff '64.
Some new members also have differing ideas about
the mission of the board. Orgera, the current president of the Alumni Council and newly appointed ex
officio member of the board, said in an e-mail that her
official role as a board member is creating "awareness
on the part of the Board of Managers concerning [the]
Alumni Council's views, as well as initiatives we are
undertaking to support the constituencies that we
serve alumni, students and the broader college community."
Rakoff, a federal judge for the southern district of
New York, said in an e-mail he hopes for the board "to
simply try to help maintain the unique combination
of intellectual rigor and social conscience that is so
distinctively a part of Swarthmore College."
The board in December set out some initiatives
they want to achieve in the next year. The two immediate goals of the board are the successful completion
of the capital campaign and monitoring the effects of
the controversial athletic cuts, said Thomas Spock '7B,
head of the finance committee on the board.
The board will hold its next meeting in February.

first woman chair as a natural progression of the concept of equality that Swarthmore has been promoting

for many decades, she said. A lawyer by profession,
Mather said she did not anticipate many changes
coming with her appointment as chair but hopes that
she will be able to enhance existing support for
President Al Bloom.
"Swarthmore had a terrific effect on my life,
caused me to have aspirations beyond what I came to
college with and provided me with the tools that have
made me successful. I hope that [the board] will be
able to support the school in providing this for future
generations of students," she said.
Other new board members come from a range of

At the state level, candidates choose Democratic delegates to
serve on their behalf at the national convention. Each state is
allotted a certain number of delegates based on its population.

The candidate who receives the majority of delegates nationally

(and stay in the U.S.)

wins the nomination.

Unlike the ballot system, party members in the caucus system
meet in large rooms and try to convince each other to support
certain candidates. Backers of individual candidates gather in
separate groups. If a candidate only receives a small fraction of
support at any particular caucus, his or her supporters may join
another group, according to an article in The New York Times.
Reeves said state caucuses like those in lowa "harken back to
the notion of town-hall democracy, which some view as archaic
in the modern arena of the Internet and television." These meetings are purposely held in public locations to encourage wider
participation. And although the Democratic caucuses are open
only to registered Democrats, lowans who are eligible to vote can
register at the caucus site, making the process more accessible to

the public.
The importance given to lowa's caucuses has been questioned by those who feel the state is unrepresentative of the
country. lowa has an agricultural economy and its residents
are overwhelmingly white. But Vallely argued that no state is
truly representative of the nation as a whole.
The victories in the spotlighted lowa caucuses were no
candidates have been planting supovernight success story
porters in lowa for over a year. Success in the lowa caucuses and
the presidential nomination process overall depends in large part
on grassroots organization and on drawing enthusiastic support
from volunteers.
Ethan Ucker 'O7 was one such volunteer. He traveled from
Illinois to be a member of the Dean campaign in lowa. Ucker, who
has been following the primaries closely and described his own
Illinois primaries as "inconsequential," wanted to take an active
role in the excitement of the political campaigning process. He
spent three days in Davenport, lowa, where he made phone calls
and traveled door to door to garner support for Dean, targeting
registered Democrats and undecided lowans.
Since 1972, lowa's caucuses have been the first in the nation,
serving as testing grounds for presidential hopefuls to demonstrate their campaigning prowess. They remained the first official
contest this year, despite a bid by the District of Columbia to host
the first primary (see story, pg. 8).
The candidate who is able to win lowa's support traditionally
gains momentum to continue on the six-month state hopscotch
before his or her party's national convention, bringing the candidate one step closer to the White House. Whoever gains lowa

Roberts pipe bursts
BY MEGO LIEN

mlienl@swarthmore.edu

Roberts dormitory residents returned to damaged property and
freezing shower water this semester. Record-low temperatures over
the holiday season caused a water pipe to freeze and crack, flooding
room 177, a first-floor lounge and the basement.
Director of Maintenance Ralph Thayer blamed the pipe burst on
"unusual cold spells," exacerbated by the lowering of dorm temperatures by maintenance staff over winter break to conserve energy
and Roberts' "sheltered location" off campus.

"Even if the college malfunctions, the
student's property is his or her
own responsibility."
Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
When the water pipe cracked in the closet of room 177, most of
the belongings of residents Bernadette Baird-Zars 'O6 and Win Ling

Chia 'O6 were waterlogged or damaged.

"[Maintenance] had moved everything out and back in, so everything was in a huge mess," Chia said. "They tried to dry stuff up by
putting it in the lounge, but there was a whole bunch that didn't get

dried, and it was all moldy."
Baird-Zars, whose closet and property received the brunt of the
damage, is trying to receive compensation, but Dean of Residential
Life Myrt Westphal said the college cannot pay for students' damaged property. As Swarthmore insures only its buildings, "even if
the college malfunctions, the student's property is his or her own
responsibility," she said.
Thayer said six inches of water had covered the basement floor,
damaging some student property and a pump. The submerged pump
left Roberts with no hot water for the last weekend of winter break.
Residents expressed mild reactions to the maintenance problems. "We just had no hot water for a while," Roberts RA Matthew
Goldstein 'O4 said. "It was kind of refreshing."
Housekeepers discovered the leaking pipe on Jan. 12 and immediately reported the problem to maintenance. To control damage,
six people bailed water from the basement while others chopped
through the closet wall, removed Baird-Zars' and Chia's belongings
and replaced the water heater and broken pipes. The repairs were
complete by the end of the day.
In spite of this year's cold, Thayer reported few temperaturerelated maintenance problems on campus.

The second floor of the new dorm has been completed, but inclement weather has caused some delays.

Cold front slows construction

Construction of the new dorm has been delayed

of the Northeast.

ITS upgrades virus D.C. primary falls short of expectations

Students returning to campus were surprised to find
their Internet connections disabled and a note in their
mailboxes instructing them to re-register on the college
network.
Information Technology Services installed a new virus
protection system on the network, and users must install
updates for the automated program to work.
The network upgrades consist of two main programs:
ePolicy, which is an anti-virus management program, and
Campus Manager, which registers users and scans computers on the network to ensure that they are up-to-date
with their virus software as well as Windows, ITS manag-

er Mark Dumic said in an e-mail.
ePolicy will minimize the amount of manual installa-

tion needed for virus protection updates by automating the
patch process, Dumic said. This process takes place
through a small program on the user's computer that waits
for ITS to place an update on the network and then downloads it.
Campus Manager will keep users vulnerable to viruses
off of the network by either placing the computer on its
own network or blocking it altogether.
Another use of Campus Manager is tracking network
addresses by using a database of users and addresses to
identify users' locations. This will serve both to identify
the owners of vulnerable computers and to locate those
guilty of a copyright violation so that ITS may contact
them.

A female student was a victim of sexual assault on Dec.
5, according to a Swarthmore Police Department report
filed on Dec. 13.
Police Chief Brian Craig said that "the victim came in
[to the station] on the thirteenth and stated that she had
been assaulted on the fifth after a party." Craig added that
the victim knew the name of the assailant, who was another Swarthmore student.
At the time of the report, the police put the victim in
touch with support and advocacy group Women Against
Rape. The police also asked Associate Dean of the College
for Student Life Tedd Goundie to come down to the station.
According to Craig, the victim was supposed to return to

"We can't force somebody to follow through on reports,"
he said.
No charges have been filed at this time and no action
has been taken against the assailant, according to Craig.
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave said Public
Safety has documented the incident in a report, but is not
part of the investigation. "The primary investigative body
is the Swarthmore police," he said. Public Safety did not
send out an official awareness bulletin, because under the
Cleary Act, a notice to campuses of such an event is not
mandated.

American work ethic-.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the latest dieting fad. The Atkins and South Beach diets, invented by Mr.
Atkins and Mrs. South Beach, have people flocking to
them in droves. And yes, of course losing weight is good
for you. As. you can tell, Emiliano lost 80. pounds over

looked better. Just look at our hotornot.com ratings; a
seven and eight respectively. In case you've been chillin'
with Osama for the past three years, the Atkins diet forces
you to give up delicacies, like sprouts and lettuce, and
replaces them with tasteless things like steak, salt, shrimp
and cheese. First of all, it's a wonder these people can still
defecate. Emiliano's mom always said he should eat broccoli to stay consistent, but Dr. Atkins seems unconcerned
about the profit margin of the toilet paper industry. But we
digress. While the Atkins diet may give you quick weight
loss, you also get clogged arteries, saggy breasts (men and
women) and a life expectancy of 45. OK, so we may be exaggerating, but at a. Rugby practice last year, a relatively fit
player with frosted tips passed out. When we asked him
what he had been eating, he told us he was on the Atkins.
What Mr. Atkins doesn't advertise too much is that, by getting rid of slow-burning carbs, you lose the energy that you
need for your mitochondria to operate properly.
The Atkins, however, is not alone in the world of logic-

less diets. The CR diet is sheer brilliance. By only eating
one meal a day, composed of only 1,600 calories, your body
supposedly uses less energy to break down food and thus

increases your life expectancy by five years, or so we're
told. What? Yes,' when you stop eating, you lose weight.
Any Somali could have' told you that, but, unlike
Americans, they prefer not to do it. These diets are about

Olde Club's hard-hitting indie line-up ready to leave the bench
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
jmphruksl@swarthmore.edu
Olde Club is' ready for another semester as
Swarthmore's premiere (well, only) venue for indie
music.
In planning the spring schedule, co-directors David
Berger 'O4 and Jen Ku 'O4 have worked to create a lineup
that reflects the growing demand for more diverse acts.
"I think it's important to have one of the big shows of the
semester be a non-rock show," Berger said, referring to
hip-hop group Prefuse, which performed last semester.
The fall semester's shows, booked by Berger, were intentionally chosen to "get people to dance. Dance was the
big thing for indie in 2003
When I first,came to
Swarthmore,'people did not dance at Olde Club." Though
bands like Out Hud were met with much enthusiasm,
Berger said the dance theme was not as successful with
the band Spoonbender Version 1.1.1.
The spring season, booked-by Ku, starts Jan. 30 with
Need New Body, an eccentric spazcore band hailing from
Philadelphia. The Feb : 20 show is Olde Club's "big rock.
show" of the season, Berger said. Scheduled to perform
are Broken Social Scene, Elefant and The A-sides, another band from Philly. Broken Social Scene, in'particular,
has received strong reviews from publications as finicky
a.s Pitchforkmedia.com and as mainstream as Rolling
Stone. Feb. 27 is the date of Olde Club's- hip-hop show for
the semester, featuring Philadelphia disc jockeys
Hollertronix. Berger promises that Hollertronix, who
sample "all types of hip-hop and Britpop," will offer a
more dance-oriented show.
John Vanderslice, who has performed at Swarthmore
the past two years will pay his third visit to the college
on March 28. "It's funny how much he loves this campus," Berger said. "The first time he visited, he thought
it was beautiful here. You'll see him walking around
campus talking about 'the beauty of the arboretum.'
The Liars', a Brooklyn-based band that opened for the
Yeah Yeah Yeahs on their most recent tour, are the last
act booked for the season. Young People will open. Ku is
still working on booking a sixth and final show.
With the exception of the Broken Social Scene, Elefant
and A-sides show, Berger has scheduled two acts for each
night. "Olde Club used to do a three-band show, but people seemed to like the two-act shows. Plus, you can get
better acts. We try to do Friday shows, because Saturday
is the day people like to go out and party. On a Friday, it's

not as taxing to go to a show and hang out."
On the cosmetic side, Olde Club itself will undergo
decorative changes. The murals created by Diego
Johnson 'O2 will be repaired and extended up from the
basement to the first floor. Tammy Wood 'O4, Olde Club's
unofficial interior decorator, will re-design the rooms.
Plans include new furniture, bar tables and better lighting, in hopes of eliminating the dead space in Olde Club's
basement. "I hate the overhead lighting," Berger said.
"We're excited about creating a space where people can

Olde Club directors have planned a marketing push to

attract students to the shows. "Until a few years ago,
Olde Club didn't promote its shows," Berger said. "We
only used to send out e-mails to WSRN rock DJs
I've
been to shows where it's been me, the band, and five
other people." Due to extensive promotion and diversity
of acts, however, Olde Club is no longer such an exclusive "indie rock club" and has become a legitimate music

Dreaming of Jeopardy
Alex Leader-Smith 'O6 is looking for his niche. He's been at Swat for a year
and a half, and he still hasn't found that one activity, that one group, that one
organization that really calls out to him and beckons him to join. So Alex has
made a pledge. Every other week, Alex will visit a differenton-campus group,
join in its activities, and see if maybe, just maybe, that group is right for him.
Along the way, he will meet a variety of interesting characters and get himself into all sorts of zany, wacky situations. What follows is the first episode
of his adventures.
I didn't know the essential functions of
the Norse Gods. Not Freya, not Balder, not
Heimdall, not a one. My knowledge of
Ancient Chinese dynasties was equally
shaky. Did Qin or Xin come first?And don't
even get me started on molecular structures. On any normal day, these shortcomings wouldn't concern me. Today, however,
was different. Today, I was testing my mettle against the legion of intellectual juggernauts known only as the Swarthmore
College Bowl team, and, believe me, I was
scared. These guys had been around.
They'd won fourth place at the ACF fall
ALEX LEADER-SMITH tourney, fourth place at U. Maryland's fall
tourney, and 11th place in 2003 Div. II
Nationals. They were serious competitors.
I considered myself lucky to win a game of
Trivial Pursuit.
Still, their shtick sounded fun. I'd always sort of dreamed of being on
"Jeopardy," and College Bowl seemed a comparable alternative, once fame,
money and a chance to meet Alex Trebek were removed. And while my academic knowledge lacked in some regards, things weren't entirely hopeless.
There could always be a question on the 1993Philadelphia Phillies. You never
knew when a bonus on X-Men villains could come up. It was a long shot, but
I needed to give my brilliance this slim chance to shine.
I chose to attend one of the team's open practices, held 7 p.m. Mondays
and Thursdays in Kohlberg. I arrived a bit nervous, but my fears were quickly allayed when I encountered the team lazily sprawled out on the floor of
Kohlberg second. What was going on? This much-ballyhooed bunch of mental titans was locked out of their practice room and couldn't get in! I was
greatly amused. Even the Swarthmore rugby team usually finds its way onto
their practice field. In other ways, too, these supposed cerebral superstars
seemed decidedly human. No matching College Bowl uniforms. No incom-

The Prodigal Prodigy

prehensible intellectual babble. And no massively swollen medial temporal
lobes. I soon felt almost comfortable in their presence.

I need an activity where my ego can be
soothed, not battered.
Then things got started. First, the team brought out The Judge™, a flashy,
blinking, mega-high-tech buzzer system that appeared to have been stolen
straight out of a bad '6os sci-fi movie. It looked ready to launch a self-destruct
sequence each time a player rang in to supply the name of some obscure
Scandinavian playwright or ancient Roman emperor. Thankfully, however,
this was rarely an issue. It turned out most College Bowl players favored the
old-fashioned yell-it-out method over actual buzzer usage. I waited and waited for College BowlPresident Chris White 'O5 to lay the smack down on these
abusers who sought to escape The Judge's™ strict regulatory paradigm, but
alas, no reprimands were forthcoming. Such leniency surprised me. I doubt

Alex Trebek would have been so tolerant.
Of course, how to buzz in was hardly an issue for me. Time and time
again, I'd hear things like, "For 10 points each, answer the following questions about Icelandic civilization," and knew I could put my buzzer down. I
spent these short breaks looking for insight into the nature of these College
Bowlers. What did they like? What did they dislike? What things particularly bothered them? I've summarized my findings below:
Dislikes: Questions on computer science. Questions on college sports.
(This, in particular, is the team's 'avowed enemy"). Questions on islands.
The following question: "What is the name for an ancient Mesopotamian
school for boys?" (That question's writer will "pay for his sins.") All question
packets read that night, feldspar.
Likes: Trigonal bipyramidal molecular structures.
Needless to say, this group was not in a particularly complimentary
mood.
Finally, after 90 minutes of intense quizzing, The Judge™ was bundled up
and put away, and the players dispersed from their awkward hallway meeting place. Meanwhile, I'd learned some valuable things from my night at
College Bowl. For one, College Bowlers are nice, friendly, mostly normal people, and, if you know anything about college sports, you should help them out
and join their team. Unfortunately, I also learned that College Bowl isn't the
place for me. The savage beating these scholarly luminaries laid on me made
that clear enough. I need an activity where my ego can be soothed, not bat-

tered. And besides ... I'm still sort of holding out for "Jeopardy."

from a squelchy, register-jumping synth line into
Missy on the microphone"), this approach combines a pleasing economy of sound elements with
an unexpectedly funky march-cadence with
an improvisatory freshness. On first listen, one calypso-esque flanged guitar strums; the atypimight wonder why something so rough and simcally rocky burst of "The Clap," which could
almost be The White Stripes for a second there;
ple even made the album, but the playful "is-itlive?" meta-ness is clever enough to bear repeating, and the tune persists as one of the album's
most memorable, serving as a sort of template for
some of the more sonically developed cuts.
Actually, the lack of a standout is more than
anything a testament to the record's consistency.

Along with Jay-Z's "Black Album" (also fantastic
and perhaps
though only speaking relatively
unfairly overlooked), this is one of few recent
mainstream hip-hop albums that maintain such a
high standard of quality from start to finish.

a buoyant guitar line reminiscent of South
African mbaqanga and becomes a sort of folksy

singalong before the barn-stomping breakdown,
complete with handclaps and ominous spoken
narration (what, that doesn't sound straightforward and pop-flavored to you?). Such moments,
even when they're as fleeting as their creators'
beasty namesakes, shine brightly out from the
surrounding chaos, infectious confections as sugary as the record cover suggests. In the meantime, the chaos is pretty interesting, too.

The Virgin Chronicles
it is stereotypically a source of shame in men and one of
Virginity
pride in women.
According to social convention, women should be virgins, wives and
then mothers. Once an unmarried woman loses her virginity, she no longer
has a role within this model. Conversely, men are supposed to be symbols of
virility. However, virginity becomes a scarce, depleting commodity. One
can only be a virgin once. Much of the lure of the female virgin revolves
around issues of possession and control. A woman's decision to "give" a
man her virginity carries great value. The deflowerer has acquired something that is unique and irreplaceable. This double standard enables the
extreme case of the "serial deflowerer," to whom virgins are the only worthy object of desire and pursuit (a tangential tidbit: Abu'l-Hayjeh allegedly
deflowered 80 virgins in a single night. Source: The Book of Sexual
Records).
Generally, men undervalue virginity
while women overvalue it. The reality of

deflowerment is that it is messy. For

as virgins. When you're ready to have sex, have sex! In our opinion, deflowerment is good because it ultimately means that you are having sex.
However, as the sexually experienced columnists that we are, we have a
strong aversion to virgins
in bed. This first experience becomes one's
basis for what sex is, good or bad. It is important to leave the newly deflowered with some level of sexual prowess. Basically, deflowerment is a huge
responsibility. Although coaching is necessary, it is frustrating to re-teach
what one has already learned. It is difficult to be emotionally considerate
of virginity's importance when one person has long past that milestoneand
moved on to the greater joys of sex.
We're not saying "Go out and lose your virginity." We just won't help
you do it.

Break tales: More than sittin' and sleepin'
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu
For me, this was not the most exciting winter break
ever. As the weeks of nagging parents, single-digit temperatures and utter boredom dragged by, my return to
Swat started looking more and more appealing. Yes, even
the part about classes and work. Sad, I know. But while I
was at home killing time, a lot of Swatties were out traveling the world, gaining job experience or just doing cool
stuff.
Jessica Larson 'O6 was one of the many students who
had an externship during the final week of break. Career
Services paired her with a Swarthmore alum who works
as a veterinary oncologist at Tufts. "I just shadowed her
for the week," she said. "I got to observe radiation therapy
and chemotherapy treatments, and I got to experience
firsthand the handling of animals." Larson also took part
in the Tri-College Winter Institute, where she took part in
discussions on race, gender and sexuality. "It was a lot of
fun, and I met some great people from the other colleges,"

THE PHOENIX

she said.
Jason Bronstein 'O5 spent his vacation tutoring a middle school student in writing. They met for four hours each
day, including weekends. "I had him write lots of essays,
and I critiqued them," said Bronstein. "I really enjoy work-

ing one-on-one with kids."
Emily Ford 'O4 traveled to Colorado with seven friends,
where she learned the fine art of skiing. Amazingly
enough, she spent most of her time on the slopes upright.
"We went really slow. It's hard to fall down when you're
going less than one mile per hour," she said. "We did a lot
of stuff, but skiing was definitely the best part."
Sarah Bryan 'O5 gets the prize for being most excited
about her vacation. She traveled to Shanghai, where she
stayed with her first-year roommate, Crystal Li 'O5, for
almost three weeks. "It was an amazing experience," she
said. "I definitely have a new appreciation for her culture
and background, for all her traditions, more than I had
from just living with her as a roommate." She was
astounded by Shanghai, which in the past few decades has
undergone huge growth. "They're finishing a new building

everywhere." She also raved about the food. "The food

there is nothing like American Chinese food. I don't speak
a bit of Chinese, so, when we went out, Crystal would
order for me. I wouldn't even know what I was eating until
the dish came out. And I perfected my chopstick skills."
Bryan and Li also spent a few days visiting Beijing. "Now
is the best time to travel abroad and stay with friends. I did
the whole thing for under $9OO. When else are you going to
be able to do that?"
The day after she got home, Bryan started an externship in the office of Sen. Carl Levin '56, a Democrat from
Michigan. She did everything from press clippings and
research to sorting the mail and writing letters to constituents. "That wasn't as bad as it seems because you get
to read all the mail and see what people are concerned
about," she says. "I have a Senate ID badge now, and a
Senate checking account, and Senate stationary, and I'm
trained to give tours of the Capitol... I got a sense of what
a senator's office is and isn't capable of doing. It was really incredible."

It's a Greek opera,
Charlie Brown

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY LILLIAN DUNN

r

lciunnl@swarthmoie.edu

In the upcoming Swarthmore musical, "Orfeo "ed Peppermint
Patty," Orfeo and Snoopy must make a grand, operatic journey
to the underworld (facing Furies and Death on the Red Baron's
flying doghouse, of course) to retrieve Peppermint Patty and
restore her to her love, Charlie Brown. Well, that's not quite
right. But as dissimilar as they are, "You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown" and the opera "Orfeo ed Euridice," two productions soon to come to the Swarthmore stage, have enough in
common that one would be excused for confusing the two.
Both "Orfeo ed Euridice," an eighteenth-century opera to
show Feb. 13 and 15 in the Lang Concert Hall, and "You're a Good
Man, Charlie Brown," which will show March 25 through 27 on
the Lang Performing Arts Center main stage, are studentdirected musical productions. Both boast strong critical success
in their previous incarnations, and both have relatively small
casts.
Mark Thatcher 'O6 is the director and driving force behind
"Orfeo ed Euridice," a tale of Orfeo's travels into hell to beg the
god of the underworld to send back his departed love Euridice. In
the Greek myth upon which the opera is based, Orpheus is eventually allowed to return to his world with Eurydice, but only on
the condition that.he doesn't look back to assure himself that she
is still following. Even though the myth ends tragically, composer. Cristoph Willibald Gluck was writing the opera for a festival
and gave the story a different ending in which the gods reprieve
the two Jovers.
"The historical period in which it was written also affected
the piece in another way," Thatcher said. Thatcher said the opera
was originally written in 1762 for the castrato Guadagni as Orfeo.
Today, a woman or a countertenor sings the role.
"Last year, I approached the chair of the music department,
Michael Marissen, to find out if there would be funding for a
student-run opera production," Thatcher said. "I am a countertenor and was interested in performing the role of Orfeo."
Thatcher discovered that the music department had money
earmarked specifically for such projects and began auditioning
and organizing the opera last September. There are only three

the roles of Amore, Euridice and Orfeo
there is a chorus and dancers for ballet sequences. Finding the
soloists and a conductor to unite the production was no problem
for Thatcher, Marissen said.
"I chose the other soloists, who are Emily Shrader [*o4] as
Euridice and Tamara Ryan ['o6] as Amore," he ssfid. Thatcher
said he was particularly interested in doing the opera this year

An in-depth look at the reality television craze
As we venture toward a new semester inundated
with labs, seminars and essays, there seems to be no
time to reflect on the "more salacious and sometimes
superficial aspects of the media and entertainment
industry. This is where I come in. Call me your quick
avenue to the pop culture world while in the Swat

together."

The success of the opera is important to-Thatcher, but, he
said, bringing this new musical experience to Swatties is also
one of the key elements of his project.
"This is a very special piece of music, and lam very excited to
introduce it to people that wouldn't normally ever experience it,"
Thatcher said. "Most people have never been to an eighteenth-'
century opera, and most have not ever heard a.countertenor sing,
so I am very happy to offer these performances."
The other major musical event of the semester, "You're A
Good Man,- Charlie Brown," is a -thoroughly modern affair..
Director Kathy Liu 'O4 said this production was drawn from the
1999 revival musical, which won two Tony awards, rather than
the original musical, written in the 19605. The subject matter of
the musical is. also somewhat different than the passion, tragedy
and sorrow that fills "Orfeo."
Rather than the struggles of a soul to find his mate in the
underworld, "it's about the trials and tribulations of a sevenyear-old, a regular day in the life of the Peanuts gang," Liu said.
"It isn't really typical Swarthmore fare, not heavy and jaded and
depressing. We don't want to enter the cheese area, but it's good,
innocent fun. Some people might roll their eyes and say, 'Oh, a
musical about Snoopy,' but it's very straightforward and very

fun."
The main cast is small, about six people, which Liu said will
make directing the show more enjoyable for her.
"It's going to be a very intimate experience, not a grand-scale
production," Liu said. "Also, we have two months to get it together, so it will make it more manageable and relaxed to have a
small cast."
If these musical events sound intriguing, you still have a
chance to participate. Liu is auditioning singers and actors today

Never have the words "you're fired" been spoken
amid such nervous anticipation as on Donald Trump's
brainchild, "The Apprentice" (NBC Wednesday, 8
p.m.). Set in the heart of New York City, the show follows 16 intelligent men and women as they vie for
selection as president of a Trump company for one
year. Though on for just three weeks now, "The
Apprentice" has already captured millions of viewers
as they watch both teams, the women's Protege and
the men's Versacorp, battle it out to win each task. The
losing team finds its way into the ominous boardroom,
where the boss sends a business hopeful packing.

difficulty until one superior entrepreneur is left standing. This show is probably most conducive to a

Swattie's mental capacity, as it delves into the intricacies of the business world. But don't fool yourself into
thinking the Harvard Law degrees and PhDs will keep
"The Apprentice" on the professional level. This competition could get as ugly and backstabbing as the
"Real World/Road Rules Challenge."
Backstabbing and jealousy is the norm for the second installment of "America's Next Top Model" (UPN
Tuesday, 8 p.m.). With supermodel host Tyra Banks
and her team of judges, 12 young women compete for
a cqntract with a modeling agency and a photo spread
in Jane magazine. Judging consists of weekly photo
shoots, runway walking, attitude and individual
progress. Each week, another lady is sent home with
a lost dream. The battle turns up the temperature in
the penthouse as the women get catty and emotions'
run rampant.
MTV has a slew of celebrity reality offerings for
mindless entertainment. A new season of "The
Osbournes" begins Jan. 27 at 10:30 p.m., and the premiere of "Newlyweds" aired . yesterday at 10.
Following suit with wedded bliss captured on tape is
Carmen Elecfra and Dave Navarro's new series "'Til
Death Do Us Part," a pairing that will be decidedly
more edgy than Jessica Simpson and assorted
"Chicken of the Sea" commentary. Cameron Diaz will
be executive producer and star of an as-yet-untitled
travel series, while Hilary Duff, Frankie Muniz and
Foxy Brown are getting ready for reality show spots
on the network as well. Sadly, my own guilty pleasure,
"Punk'd," has been put to rest, at least for now. FYI: If
anyone is desperate to see the lanky trucker-hat wearing dude Ashton Kutcher elsewhere, he's trying to act
in the new flick "The Butterfly Effect." A staple of
MTV, "The Real World," recently began its new season in sunny San Diego. Watch the youngsters get
drunk in the Jacuzzi, shout racial slur's, and get
arrested
all in the name of quality television.
For some people, merely viewing reality TV just
isn't enough. If some Swatties'want to partake of the
action of a reality show up close,' there is talk of the
next "Real World" season filming right here in Philly
in April. Who knows? If you're in the right place at
the right time, you, too, could, become one of those
lovely blurred figures on screen.

Reviving MLK Day
There are some idiosyncratic Swarthmore policies
that don't make it into most admissions presentations.
Of these, the one that sticks out the most, after the
swim test, is probably our class schedule's general
indifference toward national holidays.
While other students plan social events around the
three-day and four-day weekends scattered throughout
the semester, we have only one, the long Thanksgiving
weekend. Aside from that single concession to
American culture, the Swarthmore grind trundles on
unvaryingly from week to week, pausing only for our
generic seasonal breaks.
Perhaps it's all for the best that we don't invoke the
controversies that go with taking Columbus Day off,
and Presidents' Day and Veterans' Day seem to slide

past without much protest. But around this time of
year every year, various voices, including voices on
this editorial page, question the administration's decision to start the semester on Martin Luther King Jr.
Day.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day occupies a different
role from other public holidays. Unlike all the other
federal holidays, which blandly promote American
patriotism, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created
only recently and sends a much more direct political
message. King's message of interracial cooperation
and integration, of equality and mutual respect, of
courage without violence and power without force, is
today still attacked from all directions.
Swarthmore, given that Dr. King is a modern exemplar of its own traditional values, has every reason to
stand in solidarity with our nation's government and
the vast majority of other schools and businesses in

recognizing this day. The sense of indifference that
results from our college's treating the third Monday in
January as just another work day and school day is
much more significant to many members of our com-

munity than it is with other holidays, particularly
many faculty and staff members for whom King's

struggle is not only a continuing struggle but also a
living, bittersweet memory.
What makes this worse is that our schedule is

already set up so that Martin Luther King Jr. Day
would be much easier to officially recognize than
other holidays. Starting our semester on a Tuesday
rather than a Monday would do no great violence to
our class schedules, compared to taking a three-day
weekend in the middle of the semester. We could make
up for the lost Monday of classes by adding a Monday
at the end of the semester that would, unlike during
fall semester, actually count as a Monday. Students
would have a shorter, less stressful first week, and
those who chose to would have an opportunity to pay
homage to Dr. King's legacy. True, for some it would
only be a day off, but the benefits for those who hold
this day dear would greatly outweigh the costs.

Class recommendation database needs help
Dear Editor:
As the steward of the Class Recommendation
Database, I would like to address the difficulties many
students have recently encountered with this resource. A
reserved-students e-mail was distributed in early
Januaryasking for students to complete a series of online
surveys about their fall 2003 courses. Unfortunately, as
many students discovered, their good-citizen efforts were
met with frustration. The system did not allow for feed-

back on recent courses. This is another in a growing list
of valid complaints about this resource. I apologize to
those who are frustrated by the failure of the database to
live up to its potential as a practical and valuable

resource for students. To its credit, the current system is
far better than anything we have had before.
I'm grateful for the voluntary assistance of a former
January

student who had the skills necessary to put the database
online. However, his graduation has disrupted the maintenance that this system requires and explains the recent
problems. We have been working to remedy the situation,
and I ask for understanding when a second request for
feedback is sent out within the next week.
This semester, I am looking for a new coordinator to
merge the managerial and technical responsibilities this
project needs; this should result in rapid evolution of the
current system. Hopefully, in the near future, our community will then gain powerful access to this wealth of
information. I ask the student body to continue contributing to the database despite its current limitations.
That being said, the position pays well, and I'm seeking

applications.

Bush's NASA plan not so spacey Bush hijacks Title VI
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

One of the incidental

benefits of President
Bush's brand-new space
exploration plan is the
(or, at

creative

least,

criticisms
being heaped upon it.
One Australian columnist asserted, "The U.S.
President may figure

Judidiah was even more
vicious: "What are the
other planets chosen for
U.S. invasion? Are they an axis of planetary evil?"
Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich's comment
was perhaps the most memorable: "Why is the president talking about going to the moon and Mars while
we're still in Iraq? Maybe he's looking for the weapons
of mass destruction still."
As entertaining as these suggestions are, Bush's
plan deserves to be taken seriously, despite the circumstances of its introduction. The intentions of the
plan are threefold. First, the United States will complete its obligations to the construction of the
International Space Station by 2010, letting us use it as
a base for further exploration of the solar system.
Second, NASA will develop a new reusable manned
spacecraft to replace the shuttles (which will, according to the plan, be decommissioned by 2010).
Lastly, and most importantly, the United States will
return to the moon by 2008 with robotic explorers and
by 2020 with manned missions, aimed at creating a permanent outpost on the moon and using it as a base for
further expeditions, specifically a manned expedition
to Mars. All this at a cost, NASA says, of a mere $l7O
billion.
The first two points are hard to argue. Finishing the
ISS is a worthy goal, and, once the station is completed, we'll have a real space outpost from which we can
conduct serious research and which we can use as a
refueling pad for long-distance jaunts into the solar
system. The need to replace the shuttle has become
dramatically evident with the Columbia disaster: the

shuttles, designed to last 10 to 15 years, are now well
past 20 and showing their age. They are inefficientand
ruinously expensive to launch, and a more efficient
design is desperately needed.
The third goal, however, is a little mysterious. The
basic logic of our first moon mission in 1969 had more
to do with the Cold War than with science. It was
enough, then, to venture to the moon because we
could; it is not enough to do so now. The assertion that
the moon be used as a staging point for further exploration rings hollow. The space station serves as a bet-

ter launching point, since leaving the moon means
escaping gravity.
This, I think, isn't Bush's point. Setting up a permanent colony on the moon will teach us valuable lessons about exploring another planet, which we can
then apply in travels to Mars and beyond.
Furthermore, without much of an atmosphere, landbased telescopes on the moon will have a view matched
only by the Hubble telescope today. Of course, there is
also a wealth of information to be had by studying the
moon up close; its composition, geography and geology
all remain largely unexamined.
But there is a key problem in the plan, and that is
the inefficiency and bureaucracy of NASA itself.
Looking at the Columbia report is depressing, not only
because of how preventable the calamity was, but also
because of how much like the Challenger report this
looks. Once again, NASA's bureaucracy resisted
change and ignored warning signs. Messages weren't
passed on, information was ignored and bad decisions
were made. One is tempted to think that had NASA
the recommendations made after
Challenger, Columbia would still be in one piece today.
NASA seems as unlikely to change now as it was 17
years ago. Bush has proposed a new era of space exploration; it deserves a new, vital agency to pursue it.
Despite the entertaining objections of the proposal's critics and the inevitable (and probably true)
assertions that this plan is largely an election-year
attention-grabber, Bush's proposal is, on balance, a
good one. While in some aspects it does not go far
enough, the ideas it embraces
manned exploration
into the solar system and permanent settlement on
worlds other than our own
are long overdue. It's
been more than 25 years since man set foot on the
moon. It is high time we returned, this time to stay.

choice. He had the Southern background, he was a four-star general
and he had a nice, photogenic smile.
Sure, his opinions flip-flopped and
most of his speeches seemed heavily
coached, but that was part of the
strategy. He parroted the Democrat
party line well enough, but never in
a way that would scare away the

Republicans.
Sure, we all knew

that the

Republican Party was by now close
enough to being a Bush personality
cult that he probably wouldn't pull
THE PHOENIX

let the Democrats lose with dignity
and keep us in the game for when
the Republican glow of success finally faded some time after Bush's sec-

ond term.

My mood changed, though, seeing the way Dean dominated the poll
figures and dominated the debates.

He was irascible and uncompromising and a caricature of everything
Democrats wanted to erase from

their image, but it was working.
He certainly was no Ralph
Nader, pumping himself up as an
icon of virtue with no regard for
whether his policies were politically
possible. He had the gritty air of a
politician who took big ideas and
made them work. He was everything I thought a Democrat was supposed to be.
Then came the lowa caucus.
While the caucus itself is no reliable predictor of national success,
the sudden turnaround against
Dean inside and outside lowa during the caucus speaks of a largescale nationwide balk. People are
talking about electability again,
about holding the center, about picking a candidate who can keep his
mouth shut.

Now, John Kerry is no Joe
Lieberman; he's not substantially
more moderate than Dean, though
he's a softer sell. But the message
being sent by the sudden shift of the
support to the quieter, more compromising candidate is that we're
scared. We Democrats, watching
Bush's sky-high approval ratings,
seeing the Republicans' brazen dismantling of every Democratic policy
since the 19605, seeing the way Bush
openly courts the far right and the
right wing fawns on him in worship,
worry that the best we can do is pick
some four-star general in a suit with

a Southern accent, convince the
Republicans we're no real threat,
and moulder in the center.
Maybe it's just me, but up ahead
I see a future where conservatism
defines America and inoffensive
Democrat
after
inoffensive
Democrat loses with dignity in election after election.
I wish it weren't so, but I'll accept
it if it is. Even so, something in me
would rather have a party of opposition rather than moderation; a real
left wing instead of a right wing and
a reluctant center; a loud, angry and
shameless defender of our values.
We might lose the election, but
what a better way to go.

not be far from reality, come
The
International
February.
Studies in Higher Education Act passed the House unanimously in October and is up for a vote in the Senate early this year.
The act claims to renew the landmark Title VI, which has
provided grants for international studies and world affairs at
places like the University of Chicago, Columbia and Harvard
since 1965. However, in order to "meet the needs of the post-9/11
era," the new act makes some significant adjustments. Most

mandates the establishment of an International
Education Advisory Board. Although the board wouldn't be
able to directly control curriculum, its seven members, including two national security representatives, would make recommendations as to how Title VI programs "might better reflect
the national needs related to homeland security."
Right-wing pundits argue that tweaking Title VI would simply balance out the international studies curriculum, allowing
pro-American policy views their fair share of airtime on campus. The venerable David Horowitz gives proof that the balance
is "tipping," pointing out in an interview with Salon that, while
in 1979 only three percent of Middle Eastern scholars were non
Western, today 50 percent come from Middle Eastern countrie
Horowitz warns that this latest influx of Middle Eastern Middl
Eastern scholars may fuel terrorism and "Islamofascism," di
regarding the possibility that these might simply be the peop
who know the most about the Middle East.
Since the bill also requires that Title VI centers train stu
dents for government service, students interested in nation
defense may be given preference for fellowships. After all, a
Martin Kramer of the right-wing Middle Eastern Quarter
notes, "Studying gender in eighth-century Cairo is perfect
valid, but I'm not sure it's a taxpayer priority."
The dollar-sign rhetoric drones on in Kramer's weblog. H
asserts that the Title VI modifications attempt to correct a situ
ation in which millions of dollars are funneled into internation
al studies programs with no assurance of ' "return on the tax
payers' investment." Since when has education become a profi
based endeavor? Since when can we determine how muc
"return" taxpayers get out of any university program? By th
logic, art history, classics and English literature majors shoul
notably, it

be cut off from financial aid immediately.

(Bye, guys.)

Yet Kramer's not alone: Pundit Daniel Pipes, who was recen
ly appointed to Bush's U.S. Institute of Peace, also warns tha
current Title Vl-funded programs are letting taxpayers down
He argues that the latest bill should be amended to deny func
ing to universities that fail to cooperate with the Nationa
Security Education Program, a Pentagon initiative which rep
resents our "nation's interests." (Apparently, the entire natio
came to an agreement about what its interests were while I wa
studying abroad.)
However, supporters of the modified Title VI didn't get it all
wrong. Of course "national security" would improve if U.S. cit
zens were informed about issues in the Middle East and able t
communicate more effectively with the Arab world. But th
route to "security" (which, I assume, means fewer people dying
is not about coercing academics into promoting a more "pro
American" worldview. If we really want to give taxpayers
return on their investments, shouldn't government-funded pro
grams encourage students to ask tough questions and brain
storm the best solutions? Shouldn't we be examining the rea
sons why these really smart people are challenging governmen
policies?

We need to learn about the Middle East and the rest of th
world in an environment where we can question and criticize
fostering communication and understanding for the next gene
ation of world citizens. Otherwise, "security"
which, inciden
tally, all of us want
will never be achieved.

Let's all move to Canada.

Israel's human rights leadership still being ignored
When Reem Raiyshi set

off a metal detector at a
border control station
while passing from Gaza
City to Israel last week, she
explained that her leg contained pieces of metal from

a surgical procedure.

Twenty-two-year-old
Raiyshi, a mother of two,

was neither harassed nor
humiliated by the soldiers
on duty. Rather, she was
escorted to the privacy of
RANDY GOLDSTEIN nearby room, where shea
was told to wait for a
Bursting the Bubble female
soldier who would
perform a body search.
That female soldier never
came, however, as Raiyshi seized the opportunity to run
several meters into a nearby building and blow herself up,
killing four soldiers and wounding seven others, both
Israelis and Palestinians.
While this story certainly demonstrates the vile
lengths to which Islamic Palestinian terrorists will go to
wage war with Israel, it also contains a more subtle truth.
Hamas sent Raiyshi on this horrific mission because she

was a woman. Had she been a man, the soldiers on duty
would have certainly been more wary of her claims.
However, in their effort to accommodate this woman with
the dignity of a private search by a member of the same
sex, these soldiers sadly allowed Raiyshi the opportunity
to complete her task.

It is difficult to find an unbiased opinion of what goes
on in Gaza and the West Bank between Israelis and
Palestinians. It is not difficult, however, to recognize that
Israel has demonstrated clear moral leadership in many
facets of human rights. Sadly, those who are so quick to
criticize the necessarily severe restrictions of passage
between Gaza and Israel would likely refuse to recognize
that the country's reverence for gender privacy resulted
in the death offour of its own soldiers.
Many of Israel's human rights stances would be well

cited as exemplars for human rights in the region and the
rest of the Arab world. Unlike its antiquated neighbors,
Israel has embraced its homosexual community.
Same-sex unions are officially recognized, and dual
parenthood is awarded to homosexual couples with children. Homosexual Israelis serve openly in the army. If a
homosexual soldier is killed, his or her partner is awarded the same benefits a heterosexual partner would
receive. Even Israel's parliament, the Knesset, now has
homosexual representation.
Israel's effort to protect alternative lifestyles does not
stop at its proper borders. As per a 1951 United Nations
resolution, Israel grants asylum to anyone facing gender
persecution, which has been interpreted to include persecution of homosexuals. As such, Israel has become a safe
haven for Palestinian homosexuals who face abuse, tor-

ture and death from the Palestinian Authority and often
from their own families. Rather than suppress their true
identities in such an intolerant setting, Palestinian homosexuals frequently attempt to flee to Israel, where there is
no pressure to mask their sexual preferences.
Also in grave contrast with its neighbors, Israeli law
has afforded women the greatest equality of any in the
January

Middle East. Israel is one of the few countries in the

region in which women, regardless of their religion, may
vote in elections, drive automobiles, dress in any manner
they choose and make their own decisions regarding sexual activity. Women serve as corporate CEOs, Air Force

pilots and government and civil service officials. Perhaps

anti-Israel activists would find worth in demonstrating
against the many Arab countries in which women can
only dream, in secret, of such equality.

A final example of Israel's passion for human rights is
its consistent offering of humanitarian relief in times of
need around the world. Israel has sent countless amounts
of food and medical supplies to all parts of the world,
including Afghanistan, Albania, Venezuela, Rwanda and
China. This generosity has been largely embraced as a
demonstration of Israel's global humanitarian concern.
Sadly, the Iranian government recently rejected an
Israeli offer of aid after an earthquake in the ancient city
of Bam killed tens of thousands of people. That Israel
would offer humanitarian aid to a country that has his-

torically funded terrorism against Israeli civilians is
telling. Sadly, it is even more telling that Iran would reject
the aid while its civilians perished under the rubble.
It is unfortunate that critics of Israel have failed to
laud the country's record on these and other issues as a
model for the rest of the Middle East. When the current
conflict has ended, these issues will remain crucial to the
lives of ordinary civilians. As such, recognition of Israel's
human rights successes will be pivotal in the evolution of
individual rights for Israel's neighbors in both the near
and distant futures.

Baseball's
thorny Rose
A lot happened in the world of sports over winter break. College
football ended in a controversial split championship. The Super
Bowl matchup is set, with Carolina going up against New England.
A lot ofbaseball players made news for switching teams, and a few
made news for not switching teams. Professional and college basketball both started to get interesting. And Pete Rose finally admitted to gambling on baseball as manager of the Cincinnati Reds.
Now, before I go ahead and righteously lay into Rose, I have
some admitting and confessing of my own to do. I partook in a little gambling myself this winter break. I managed to walk out of
Foxwoods Casino with $lO more than when I walked in. That cash
should make up for the $lOl lost in
a football suicide pool this fall. So,
as I readily admit, I am not without sin myself. But damn it if I
won't cast some stones anyway.
So, I'll open this up with the
obvious beginning. I don't think
Pete Rose should be reinstated to
baseball, admitted to the Hall of
Fame or allowed to manage a baseball team. I've said so before in this
He tarnished the game,
undermined its purity, and put
himself above it. But this is all old

news. What ofhis recent confession
and book?
First off, I believe (with reservations) that his confession is

genuine and contrite and authen-

tic. I think he's sorry for betting
on the game. Really sorry. But I don't think he's sorry for the right
reasons. He's basically sorry he got caught. The most telling
moment of his interview with Charles Gibson was the very beginning, when Gibson asked him about Rule 21, the regulation that
expressly prohibits betting on MLB contests, being posted in
evrery clubhouse in baseball and why Rose persisted in breaking
it. Rose responded by trying to downplay the significance of the
rule and consequently the seriousness of breaking it. If Rose can
comprehend the enormity of his actions at all, it is strictly in relation to how much misery and inconvenience they have caused
him. He has no concept of the game as larger and more important
than himself.
As for the timing of his interview, and for the book release coinciding with the election of actual deserving players to the Hall of
Fame, I really do believe it to be an unfortunate coincidence. I've

A good way to commemmorate Pete Rose
would be a blank plaque in the Hall of Fame.
heard it from ABC News and Rodale Press that Rose's admission
was not supposed to coincide with the Hall of Fame election and
that Rose meant no disrespect to Dennis Eckersley and Paul
Molitor. That this may be an unfortunate coincidence does not
make up for the fact that Pete Rose willingly and voluntarily sets
up a booth near the Hall ofFame every year on induction weekend
where fans can buy his autograph. That is a sign of blatant disrespect for all the players who not only managed to play the game
right but also were able to refrain from betting on it.
So what's gonna happen to Pete now? My guess is that Bud Selig
reinstates him. When it comes to Bud Selig, I generally expect him
to make the most irrational decision possible. With Pete Rose reinstated, he'll come up for election into the Hall of Fame where he'll
be rejected by the writers and the veterans committee, at least for
the first few years. But, after a few years, the public will forget some
of the ugliness surrounding the confession of "Charlie Hustle," and
public support will again grow for Rose to be elected. Eventually,
he'll get in. As much as it pains me, I think someday Pete Rose's face
will be smiling from a plaque in the Hall of Fame Gallery above a

listing ofhis monumental achievements as a player.
A better way to commemorate Rose would be for the Hall of
Fame Gallery to put up a blank plaque. Nothing on it at all. No
name, no face, no teams, no achievements. Everybody wouldknow
who it was for, and Rose would have his coveted place among the
greats. But it would serve as a stark reminder that corrupting the
game carries with it a heavy price, no matter how records one holds
and that some black marks should never be completely removed.

Members of the indoor track team prepare for a meet this Saturday against archrival Haverford.

Track races through break
BY MATTHEW SCHILLER
mschilll@swarthmore.edu
The Garnet track and field teams raced back to
campus in early January to prepare for winter break
meets in New Haven and New York. In a test of early
season fitness, the men and women followed up a
respectable performance last weekend at the Yale
Invitational and had an even more impressive showing at the New York City Collegiate Opener.
In their first meet of the New Year, the Tide went
up against tough competition from both Division I
and 111 schools at Yale. Sprinter Matt Williams 'O4 and
the Garnet relay teams excelled for the men. In the 55meter hurdles, Williams finished second among Dili
runners, with a time of 8.06, and seventh overall. The
distance medley team of Vernon Chaplain 'O7, Keefe
Keeley 'O6, Paul Thibodeau 'O6 and Williams also
came in second at 11:03.43. The men's 4xBoo team of
Chaplain, Keeley, Thibodeau and Alex Elkins 'O6 was
second among Dili competition.
For the women, distance runners Caroline Ritter
'O6 and Pam Davis 'O7 led the way. Ritter's time of
11:39.95 in the 3000-meter race was good enough for
second place against their Division 111 competitors. In
the mile, Davis finished in second place as well, clocking in at 5:52.25. Teammates were impressed with the
first-year's performance. "Pam Davis is going to be
strong this year," runner Sarah Hobbs 'O6 said.
After braving the wind and snow as well as abnormally cold temperatures inside their practice facility
at Lamb-Miller Field House, the Tide traveled to New
York Jan. 16. According to coach Pete Carroll, the
New York University track is one of the fastest on the
East Coast. With that in mind, the team focused more
on personal achievements than on how they finished.

"We were more interested in running fast than what
place we got," Carroll said.
The men's distance medley team of Chaplain,
Keeley, Garrett Ash 'O5 and Kier Watchterhauser

'O4

improved upon the previous week's time by 13 seconds, and the 4x400 team of Chaplain, Elkins,
Thibodeau and Tyler Lyson 'O6 ran its fastest time of
the year, crossing the finish line at 3:38.90.
Not to be outdone, the women's 4xBoo relay performed exceptionally, as well, despite the absence of
star Elizabeth Gardner 'O5, who is spending the
semester in France, and team leader Claire
Hoverman 'O3, who graduated last June. New relay
runners Davis and Emily Wistar 'O6 teamed up with
veterans Njideka Akunyili 'O4 and Hobbs to put
together a time of 10:17.01, which brought them in fifth
overall. Hobbs continued her solid day in the mile,
running a personal best of 5:21.50. "It was a little disappointing," she said. "I want to break 5:20."
Coach Carroll attributed some of the team's early
success to good team cohesion, thanks to the many
soccer players who joined the team in their off sea-

son. "The soccer guys are a great bunch and are really helping out. They bring a different perspective," he
said. "It's hard to be a team when people are doing different things in different locations, but they're big on
relays and doing the team stuff. All these soccer [players] bring a nice chemistry to the team."
With just under six weeks before the conference
meet, the Garnet aim to improve upon last year's disappointing finishes of 10th in the conference for the

New DIII rules a flawed plan
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND

aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The president's council on Division 111 athletics made
critical decisions this winter about the nature of Dili
sports with far-reaching implications for all of its athletes,
both at Swarthmore and beyond. But, while the BCS fiasco
with USC and LSU, Kobe Bryant's neverending rape trial,
Pete Rose's admission to betting on baseball and the controversy over performance-enhancing drugs like the
designer steroid THG have dominated headlines and popular debate recently, a more relevant issue has gone

unnoticed.
Simply put, the changes passed by the council include
the following:
Shortening the playing season from 21 weeks to 18
weeks in fall sports and 19 weeks in winter and spring
sports, effectively limiting the time in which coaches can
schedule games and practices
• "Significantly limiting" practice and competition during the nontraditional segment for fall and spring sports
• Further limiting voluntary out-of-season workouts
with coaches
Continuing to allow certain Division 111 institutions,
such as Johns Hopkins, to offer athletics scholarships in
their Division I programs
•

•

The council also attempted to cut season contests by 10
eliminating some non-conference contests and
possibly at least one football game from those conferences
and schools that carry the sport. It argued that the changes
would help the "academic" side of Division 111 sports.
percent,

The changes proposed and passed by the council,
regardless of the so-called good intentions of the policies
and their attempt to help student athletes, are exactly the
wrong thing for athletic programs. They wiU have unfore-

seen consequences for student athletes both here at
Swarthmore and at other schools.
Shortening the playing season by three weeks in the fall

and two in the spring, with the intention of giving athletes
more time off of their season to study, can only backfire.
By shortening the season without cutting the number of
contests, the only likely conclusion is that teams will play
more games in simply less time, as coaches try to fit in all
their required conference games as well as the necessary
out of conference contests. Instead of making life easier for
athletes, the president's council has instead made life
tougher, giving

athletes less time to spend on their work

during the shortened

Furthermore, allowing programs with Division I teams,
like Johns Hopkins' lacrosse team, creates a disparity
within those conferences and sports. By allowing those
schools to maintain the ability to hand out scholarships to
some athletes and stay in Division 111 with other sports,
the council has given them an unparalleled recruiting
advantage, granting those schools prestigious programs
that small schools like Swarthmore could never hope to
match. What will happen when the Division I lacrosse star
wants to play basketball for the university? Can the athlete
then join any other college team, giving the group an
advantage in size, strength or quickness?
Ultimately, the decision by the president's council,
although intended to help student athletes, only hurts
them in ways the council could not have imagined.
Coaches will likely schedule the same amount of games in
an even shorter time span. Athletes will have less time to
spend on their sports out of season and less time to come

together as a team.
These changes may not have a profound effect on
Swarthmore. Our teams already schedule fewer games

other conferences,

season.

"Significantly limiting" off-season practices is also
counterproductive and ultimately works against the council's aims of cutting athletes a break. Off-season practices
and workouts are too short as it is. Simply ask any athlete
if he or she would like a longer off season and more
chances to play, and the answer will almost certainly be
yes. While Swarthmore is a great academic institution
with a multitude of options for its students to learn and
grow academically, most athletes came to play sports and
would jump at the chance to play at anytime of the season,
something that cutting off-season workouts would not
help.

Hoopsters keep winning
BY COLTON BANGS

The Garnet women's basketball team
has been busy making a name for itself
over break. It went 5-2, placing in the
upper half of the Centennial Conference.
The Tide is 10-5 overall and 5-3 in conference. High-caliber performances
from defending conference scoring
champion and captain Katie Robinson
'O4 fueled Swarthmore. Robinson currently leads the conference in scoring,
posting 16.5 points per game.
In recent action, the Garnet defeated
Gettysburg on the road, 60-44. The
women opened the contest with a 13-4
*

run, never looking back. The Garnet's
tenacious defense turned 24 Gettysburg
turnovers into 21 points. The Garnet

defense ranks among the top 25 in the

nation, allowing just 51.3 points per
game.
Coach Adrienne Shibles credited the
team's tough defense to their success.
"One of the things that gets us going is
pressing. We have good athletes and our
press has gotten us a lot of steals," She
said.
Robinson was a large beneficiary of
the turnover-prone Gettysburg offense,
finishing the game with 25 points.

Radiance Walters 'O6 pocketed seven
points and eight rebounds, putting her
10th in the conference in rebounding
with 7.2 rebounds per game.
A day earlier, Bryn Mawr proved no
match for Swarthmore as the Garnet
Tide nearly doubled their opposition's
score in a 77-39 wipeout. A balanced
attack with buckets from 11 different
Swarthmore players helped the Tide
gain its fourth conference victory. Once

again, the stingy defense not only held
Bryn Mawr to 39 points but also let the

Tide come away with 17 steals.
In the most thrilling game of the
break, the Garnet defeated F&M on a
last second basket by Ali Wolff 'O5. The
Garnet led for almost the entire game,
finally giving it up with 10.1 seconds to

go. Taking the ball on the in-bounds
pass, Robinson traveled the length of
the court to find Zoey Adams-Deutsch
'O6, who connected with Wolff for the
lay up.
Shibles said it was great to see the
team come away with the win after
playing 35 minutes of impressive basketball, only to have F&M take the lead
with just seconds left. Robinson tallied
her first career triple-double with 22

points, 11 rebounds and 11 steals.
The other two games were split
between a loss to Dickinson 57-46 and a
victory against Washington 54-45. In
the victory, Robinson had 17 points
paired with seven rebounds, and
Walters pulled a double-double with 11
points and 11 rebounds.
Women's basketball takes the court
at Tarble Pavilion Jan. 22 at 7 p.m. to
face high-scoring Muhlenberg. The
Mules are known for putting over 90
points on the board game after game.
Shibles recognized
the challenge
ahead. "It's going to be tough. We know
that. We have to be able to break their
press and finish layups," she said.
She also pointed to the health of the
team, including a key ankle injury to
Debbie Farrelly 'O6, as an obstacle to

overcome. Robinson echoed her
coach's comment. "We expect to get
trapped and pressed a lot. We just have
to stay in our tempo," she said.

Springtime in
Philadelphia
In his hit "Cycles," Frank Sinatra sang, "So I'm down and so I'm
out, but so are many others." Well, the Eagles are officially down and
out, joining the 29 teams before them to make it to the off season.
Congratulations on a job well done.
Eagles fans must be feeling worse than Bill Murray in "Groundhog
Day." Same crucial game, same pathetic performance. Is anybody actually surprised the Eagles lost their third consecutive NFC
Championship Game last weekend? Certainly not this writer. No, I
don't have the prognosticating abilities of Punxsutawney Phil, but I
just knew.

Didn't you? The mood
around the city last week wasn't
"We're going to smoke them." It was
"How's it going to feel if we lose
again?" Talk about a positive attitude.
Call it bad karma, call it bad luck, but
the fact remains the same: The Eagles
were outplayed by a better Carolina
team, a team that only two years ago

had only one measly win.

"You know, it's almost funny, but

things can't get worse than now." I know
many Philly fans certainly it is the case

Matt Gustafson hits a shot from beyond the three-point line. His peformance against Gettysburg fueled
Swarthmore's offense in the 68-62 Garnet victory.

BY DARCY NELSON

On a night of milestones, the GarnetTide pulled
out a victory and then some. Saturday night
marked not only a win against conference foe
Gettysburg but also the I,oooth point for Matt
Gustafson 'O5.
Gustafson is the 15th player in Swarthmore history to reach this mark and is now the 12th top scor-

er in Swarthmore men's basketball history with
1,024 total points with nearly a season and a half
remaining in his career. The hook shot that broke
the 1,000-point mark came after he drilled one from
behind the arc, sparking the Garnet offense. But the
'

y

scoring did not stop there. The 6-4 forward ended the
game with a career-high 37 points, scoring 20 before
halftime, managing to outscore Gettysburg's entire
team for that half and tallying 18 of the first 22 points
of the game. At halftime, Gustafson's 20 points put
the Garnet ahead 27-19. "It was an important game
for us to win," he said. "If we had lost, we would
have been out of the playoff picture."
Before his record-breaking performance against
Gettysburg,
Gustafson received Centennial
Conference Player of the Week honors on Jan. 13.
The acclamation came on the heels of Gustafson's
performance against Washington College on Jan. 7,
as Swarthmore prevailed 101-97 in double overtime.
The Tide defeated the Shoremen behind Gustafson's
35 points and seven rebounds, with the team shooting 55.8 percent from the floor and 53.3 percent from

beyond the arc.

"[Gustafson] definitely carried us," co-captain
Jacob Letendre 'O4 said after the recent victory over
Gettysburg. But Letendre recognized the positive
attitude of the team as another factor. "One of the
great things about the team this year is that every-

20

one has a winning mentality. Losses don't linger; we
come out and win the next game."
"We came and beat them in their own gym, which
shocked them," Letendre said. "They were prepared
for an easy game, fairly confident that they were
going to beat us." Letendre added seven assists, five

points and two steals to total 137 steals in his career,

the Swarthmore steals record.
Continuing Saturday's record-breaking streak,
Swarthmore also celebrated its first win against
Gettysburg since 1997, ending a six-game losing
streak to their Centennial Conference rival. The
victory came a day after a loss to Franklin &
Marshall's nationally ranked team, 57-87. Co-captain
Jared Passmore 'O4 said he believed that it was the
team's mental toughness that prevented any discouragement from carrying over from Friday's loss.
"We did a really good job as a team putting that loss
behind us and looking forward to the next game," he
said. "[Gettysburg] was the type of game that we
wanted and we did exactly what we wanted to do.
We managed to do the little things: to cut down on
turnovers, move the ball, make shots, and play good
defense."
The Tide's defense held the two top scorers on
Gettysburg in check all night, allowing the Bullets
to lead at only one point early in the game, 8-4. Jeff
Maxim 'O7 and Chris Loeffler 'O5 added 10 points
apiece for the Garnet Tide to help move the team's
record to 6-8 on the season. "Everyone that went in
contributed and did what they needed to do,"
Passmore added. "We played a terrific team game. It
was nice to see everything come together."
The team will travel to face Ursinus this
Saturday and rival Haverford next Wednesday. It
faces Franklin & Marshall on Saturday, Jan. 3L and
Johns Hopkins on Wednesday, Feb. 4, at home in
Lamb-Miller Field House.

that, after three in a row, what could be
worse? Here's what would be worse.
Allen "The Answer" Iverson has a
career-threatening ACL injury after
attempting to dunk the ball on a breakaway after one of his steals. Jim Thome

decides the winter weather here in
Philadelphia is too frigid and forfeits the
remainder of his contract to go back to balmy Cleveland. Jeremy Roenick
goes into a coma after a vicious hit by a rejuvenated and playoff-bound
Eric Lindros. Energizer spokesman J.D. Drew returns to the NL East and
singlehandedly costs the Phillies a playoff spot.
But all is not lost, as the scenarios outlined above are pure fiction
(well, except the last one). "Life is like the seasons; after winter comes
the spring." And so as the cold winter winds blow hard on Philadelphia
sports fans, rest assured that Old Blue Eyes was right; spring is right
around the corner. Less than a month now until pitchers and catchers
report. Just over two months until Billy Wagner saves his first game
as a Philly. Less than a hundred days until Larry Bowa gets the axe
and Grady Little swoops in to lead the Phillies to his third straight 90win season. Citizens Bank Park? It ain't the Vet. The Flyers are looking strong, and AI is back from street clothes to help the Sixers on
their quest towards .500, probably good enough for third seed in the
East. There is reason to have hope.
"But I'll keep my head up high, although I'm kinda tired." Tired of
thinking this is the year the Eagles break through? Sure you are. But
be happy, as the Eagles next year won't be the same Eagles that lost
last weekend. Free agent Terrell Owens replacing James "I Didn't
Show Up To Play on Sunday" Thrash as the team's top receiver? It
could happen. Don't get your hopes up too high, however. The Eagles
were not built to peak in one year; they were built to contend for
awhile. And contend they have. But with this off-season, pivotal parts
of their division-title-caliber team will be gone. Troy Vincent and Duce
Staley? Gone. Bobby Taylor and Carlos Emmons? Free agents. A.J.
Feely and Correll Buckhalter? Restricted free agents. But don't worry.
Andy Reid is a good coach. He will win again with an inaccurate quarterback surrounded by zero talent.
"There isn't much I have learned through all my foolish years,
except that life keeps running in cycles; first there's laughter, then
there's tears." So, Philadelphia, don't be surprised when next year this
same scene repeats itself, with your Birds marching to the NFC title
game only to lose yet again'to another team with more talent, but this
time to a coach who has been out of football for the last decade, Joe
"God" Gibbs. Just face it. Philadelphia teams can't win championships. Your best bet is to pin your hopes of a championship on the
Flyers. The Eagles sure aren't going to win anything anytime soon,
except maybe another division title, but those are meaningless. The
Sixers aren't going to win anything, not with the Pacers and Pistons in
the East, let alone the eight or so teams in the West that would crush
them. The Phillies will fail yet again to snap the Braves' record 12 consecutive division titles, and even if they win the wild-card, they'll get
smoked in the first round by the Cubs. The Flyers need to get by only
the Devils and then get lucky against the West. Hey, it could happen.
But for those of you who don't like hockey, well, it appears as though
you're out of luck. Unless you live until you're 80. "So I think I'll stay
awhile and see if my dreams come true."
