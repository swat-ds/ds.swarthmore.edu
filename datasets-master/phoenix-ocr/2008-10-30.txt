Obama speaks at Widener University
A week before Election Day, candidate stresses unity, education, the economy and getting out the vote
BY JONATHAN EMONT
jemontl@swarthmore.edu
Barack Obama gave a speech at Widener University in
Chester, Pa. on Tuesday morning, rallying supporters just
one week before Election Day. Obama spoke before a shivering crowd of 9,000, commending his audience for attend-

ing the outdoor rally despite sub-optimal weather conditions. Many of Obama's supporters arrived hours early to
clear security, waiting outside under a persistent rain while
the temperature hovered at a brisk 39 degrees. Obama's
speech focused on his strategy for addressing the problems
economic and otherwise that are currently afflicting
America. He also emphasized the need for massive mobilization efforts to get voters to the polls on Nov. 4.
When Obama took the stage, the crowd roared so loudly
that a crackle reverberated through the sound system. He
began his speech by discussing the importance of next
week's elections. "One week. After decades of broken politics in Washington, eight years of failed policies from
George Bush and 21 months of a campaign that has taken us
from the rocky coast of Maine to the sunshine of California,
we are one week away from change in America," he said.
Obama then immediately transitioned into a discussion
of the ailing economy. He referred to the current downturn
as "the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,"
and discussed the effect it was having on middle class
-

-

Americans.
Obama attempted to link spiraling unemployment and

stagnating real wages to the economic policies implemented
under the Bush administration policies that he accused
Republican nominee John McCain of supporting. "John
McCain has ridden shotgun as George Bush has driven our
economy toward a cliff, and now he wants to take the wheel
and step on the gas," Obama said, prompting a round of
applause.
The issue of the economy resonated with the predominately working-class residents of Chester, a onetime industrial powerhouse that has since fallen victim to an exceptionally high rate of unemployment. Angeline Robinson, a
Chester resident who attended Tuesday's rally, said that she
supported Obama because he was the "candidate of the people
[and knows] how the rest of us are feeling." She cited
Obama's health care policies and his plan to expand scholarship opportunities as the two primary reasons behind her
support of his candidacy.
While Obama emphasized the severity of the current eco-

Great Depression and other historical challenges, Obama
said he was confident that America was equally capable of
overcoming the present crisis. Describing American workers as the "most productive" in the world and American
research universities as the "envy of the world," Obama
said that with a "new direction," there is no reason why "we
can't make this century another American century."
The rally in Chester took place shortly after Obama had
been lampooned by critics for a purported excess of leftist
ideals. Excerpts of a chat Obama had on a radio show in
2006, in which he apjfeared to bemoan 1960s politics' lack of
"redistributive change," surfaced a couple of days ago.
Shortly thereafter, the McCain campaign accused Obama of
espousing socialist policies. The attack came at a timewhen
Obama's campaign was trying to contain the fallout from a
remark made by a plumber in Ohio who declared Obama's
tax plan as "socialist." During Tuesday's speech, Obama
made a number of attempts to distance himselffrom the far
left. As much as Obama emphasized the need for more
active federal involvement in education, healthcare and the
floundering economy, Obama reiteratedhis support for free
market policies and his opposition to protectionism. He
said, "Government shouldn't try to solve all of our problems
But all of us must do our part as parents to turn off the
television and read to our children and take responsibility
for providing the love and guidance they need."
Obama incorporated the theme of unity throughout his
rhetoric, something that has long been a hallmark of his
...

campaign.

be reversed under his stewardship. Citing World War n, the

Obama said, "There is no city or town that is more proAmerica than anywhere else we are one nation, all of us
proud, all of us patriots."
While the words were clearly in response to a comment
made by Palin in a recent speech in North Carolina, in
which she said she was happy to be visiting a "proAmerican" part of the country, not once in his speech did
Obama mention Palin directly by name. In this, and in
many other ways, the overall tone of Obama's speech was
conservative; many lines he employed had been recycled
from earlier speeches, and Obama took no new swipes at his
opponents.

On Tuesday, however,

the words took on an added meaning. Obama, first implicitly and later explicitly, began contrasting his message with that of Sarah Palin and other
Republicans who he accused of cultivating "division."

Before Obama spoke, a preacher led a public prayer that,
among other things, asked God to ensure better healthcare
for all. A number of campaign volunteers, one of them a selfdeclared "single mother," spoke to the crowd before Obama
arrived. The volunteers led people in Obama rallies' trademarked chants of "Yes, We Can," and attempted to dispel
myths they feared would keep people from voting. Then

came Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who reiterated
the importance of the upcoming election.
The rain, wind and sub-40 degree temperatures could
have been expected to depress turnout at this outdoor event,
but it looked as if the designated area was completely filled.
According to the Associated Press, a McCain rally scheduled in Northern Pennsylvania on Tuesday was canceled
because of the inclement weather.
Swarthmore students flocked to the rally, taking public
buses and driving by car. Jessie Cannizzaro 'l2, one of the
many Swarthmore students to attend the rally, described it
as an 'Amazing experience." She said, "My friends and I got
there at 5:30 a.m. Even though it was windy, raining and
freezing there was still a long line of people there to see him.
Everyone was so excited!"
When asked to comment on her experience at the rally,
Cally Feingold 'l2 said, "Obama was speaking in Chester, a
town where the economy absolutely imploded in the 'Bos
and yet he made people feel so much hope. For me, seeing
the crowd's reaction to him was the most important part of
the experience." The people of Chester loved him." Many
people in the crowd appeared to be of college age, and
Obama dedicated a section of his speech to them,promising,
as president, to help students pay their tuition costs.
Pennsylvania has 21 electoral votes, and is a state hotly
contested by both campaigns. While polling earlier in the
election declared Pennsylvania up for grabs, more recent
polling shows Obama up by as much as ten points in the
polls.

Annual Halloween party moved to Sharples
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

The annual Halloween party will be
held in Sharpies on Saturday night and
will be the first party held in the dining
hall since Fall 2005. The party, which was
held for the last two years in Upper Tarble
and previously had been held in the Mary
Lyon dormitory, was moved to Sharpies
for reasons concerning safety and convenience.
According to Rachel Head, Assistant
Dean of Residential Life, the decision not
to host the party at Mary Lyon was "left
up to the residents of Mary Lyon and the
RAs." Head said that the administration
advised the RAs and gave them some
input, but ultimately left the decision to

people out of non-party
spaces

doors and running down
hallways."

the residents. She said that the RAs hosted "all-hall meetings where they invited
all the residents to come and share their
opinions" on the party.
The residents of Mary Lyon decided to
decline hosting the party, mainly because
of the huge impact caused by most of campus descending on their dorm for a party.
The Pitt-Palmer basement was also considered and rejected. "It's going to be a
pretty messy event," Head said.

"There's a safety concern
students
are going to be drinking at this event, and
then they have to get back to campus,"
she said. Head went on to say that the
school had explored the option of providing a shuttle between Mary Lyon and the
rest of campus for the night (like the shuttles that ran at previous Mary Lyon parties), but ultimately decided against it,
due to the safety and logistical issues
involved with such a shuttle.
There were also concerns with having
a party in a residential space, especially
one where some residents might not wish
to participate in the event. According to
Dan Abdul-Malak 'O9, an RA for
Hallowell, there were problems with
restricting partygoers the last time the
Halloween party was held in Mary Lyon.
"It was hard to keep people out of nonparty spaces," Abdul-Malak said. "There
were people knocking on doors and running down hallways."
Upper Tarble, where the Halloween
party took place last year, was rejected for
different reasons. According to Paury
Flowers, Assistant Coordinator of Student
Activities, the school felt there were conflicts between the normal status of Upper
Tarble as a dry space and the lifting of
that status for this party.
Flowers also said that there's "a really
nice floor [in Upper Tarble] that we're trying to keep nice for as long as possible,"
and that the stairs there presented safety
issues. Last year, an intoxicated male student fell down the stairs and had to be
transported to Crozer-Chester Medical
Center.
Flowers said that Sharpies Dining Hall
is "a large space that can accommodate
just about the entire campus, if it needs

to." She also mentioned that Sharpies'
central location makes it a relatively safe
space for the party, as students won't
have as far to go traveling to and from
their dorms, and are less likely to injure
themselves or others or to get in trouble

with the Swarthmore police. "If it was in
Tarble,
often times [the
Swarthmore Borough Police] will come
around the Parrish circle and cite people
if they see them stumbling back to their
room," Flowers said.
"If things go well with the Halloween
party there are a lot of folks in the Dean's
Office that would like to see that space
utilized more for larger scale parties, like
formals, that used to happen in years
Upper

prior," Flowers said.
According to Flowers, the party will be
mainly held in the central area of
Sharpies, directly below the stairs, where

condiments are usually kept. The main
dining room will be blocked off, along
with the small, private rooms that adjoin
the condiment room.
She said the organizers of the party are
considering the use of the long, narrow
dining room on the West side of the dining
hall for additional space, but that they
hope the room won't be needed. For one
thing, the organizers hope as much as possible to keep the party out of areas used
for eating.
As much as possible, Flowers said,
"We like to keep it small, so we can manage it and keep people safe."

Financial compensation for StuCo members debated
BY CLARISSA SKINNER
cskinnl@swarthmore.edu

In response to recently voiced concerns

that students from low-income backgrounds who are financially reliant on
paying campus jobs cannot feasibly serve
on student government committees,
Student Council has begun considering the
possibility of compensating committee
members with a salary. The suggestion of
paying student government representatives, however, has sparked controversy
within the Swarthmore community.
Equality for low-income students is the
main argument of those in favor of finan-

cial compensation for committee mem-

bers. Paul Apollo 'O9, who served on both

Student Council and the Student Budget
Committee last year, said, "It's not just or
equitable for the student body, which is an
economically diverse body, to only have
people that don't have to work [jobs] on
committees."
Apollo noted that lower-income students do serve on committees, but said, "A
vast number of people that I've worked
with are generally upper middle class at
least." He points out that low-income students have to balance not only their academic load and their work for committees,
but also their jobs.
Apollo, who comes from a lower-income
background and contributed a large

4

amount of time to the committees he was
on last year, said that he did not have
spare time to work, and therefore did not
have spare money. "I couldn't buy pizza
from Renato's, or go to Philly with my
friends," he said. This year he chose not to

serve on committees so that he would have
sufficient time to take on a paying job.
"This should not be a choice that lowerincome students have to make," he said.
Paying students on committees eliminates
the need to make this choice.
In response to the proposal, Student
Council has fielded two types of questions:
those pertaining to the funds needed to

finance the salaries and those dealing with
the potential impact of the proposal on the
campus community. With regard to the
funding question, the Council briefly con-

sidered the option of paying committee
members through the Dean's Office. But

because council members convene with
the Deans on behalf of the students, however, this possibility was deemed unethical.
Therefore, if this system were set up,
committee members would be paid
through the SBC. Student Council
President Yongjun Heo 'O9 estimates that
30 to 40 jobs would be created. Committee
members would be paid for the hours
spent in meetings only, ranging from a few
hours per week to a few hours per semester depending on the committee. Although

an exact amount is still being computed,
Heo estimates that the total cost of paying
committee members would come to a few
thousand dollars yearly.
StuCo Vice-President David Sven
Udekwu 'O9 said, "Funding for groups and
group events will come first. If a group
wants supplemental money, there will definitely be enough."
Another possible solution that has been
raised is only paying students who are on
financial aid. Apollo points out, however,
that this would force students to divulge
their financial aid status to others, cause
the budget to constantly fluctuate from
year to year, and also would be inequitable
since higher-income students do the same
amount of work.
Whether funds are available or not, two
other questions about the notion of paying
committee members have been raised. The
first is how money might change the motivations of present and future committee
members. The second is whether money
degrades the intrinsic value of volunteering one's services for the community.
"StuCo members don't just want to pay
themselves," Heo said, who said that he is
undecided about the issue. If the decision
were made to pay committee members,
Heo noted that payment would start next
term; this would exclude those currently
in the decision-making process from getting paid.

October 30, 2008

The issue of committee members getting paid also brings up concern about

future candidates' motivations for running
for positions. Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said, "[Working in student
government] is a kind of service to the
larger community that ought to come from
interest and by volunteering."
However, Udekwu said in an e-mail,
"The students who would have run no matter what will still run." The voters, he said,
will have to distinguish between who is
running because of the money and who is
running because of their passion.
Eldridge also said that being paid
debases the educational value of working
as a volunteer in student government.
"This is a group of people that come
together with the campus community as
its focus. They're advocates, interpreters,
seekers of informationand brokers of solutions," Eldridge said. For Eldridge, student
government is an "effective conduit of
information" from which "good emerges."
Money, he said, taints this process.
Eldridge "understands the pressure" for
students on financial aid, he said, and
hopes that problems of equality or limited
choice can be remedied. However, he
notes, the process of reaching that goal
needs more consideration.
The one point on which both sides
agree is that ultimately, the student body
will have to decide this issue.

Congress hopefuls take stage to outline platforms

Todd Friedman Phoenix Staff

Candidates for representation of the 7th Congressional District, incumbent Democrat Joe Sestak and Republican Craig Williams fielded questions from Barbara Dietrich, debate
moderator and president of the Philadelphia League of Women Voters.

BY JEFF DAVIDSON

jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu

On Wednesday, Swarthmore hosted a debate between
the two candidates currently vying for representation of
the 7th Congressional District in the U.S. Congress. With
the Nov. 4 election day rapidly approaching, incumbent
Democrat Congressman Joe Sestak took to the stage in a
spirited war of words against Republican Craig Williams.
This event, hosted by the League of Women Voters of
Delaware County, began with three-minute opening
remarks by the candidates at 10 a.m. followed by nearly an
hour and a half of questions and concluded with closing

statements at 12 p.m.

The debate proceeded according to the town hall format
that has been widely employed by congressional as well as
presidential candidates this fall with one exception: the
moderator read all of the questions instead of the audience. Before the actual event, members of the audience
submitted written questions to the League, which then
conveyed them to debate moderator and president of the
League of Women Voters of Philadelphia Barbara
Dietrich. The League of Women Voters subsequently evaluated the questions and selected those deemed most suitable for Wednesday's event.
After the introductions of the two candidates, Sestak
began with his opening statement.
"Complex, challenging issues certainly confront us,
and it's nice to have a comprehensive debate forum,"
Sestak said. "And Craig, thanks for being here for a bipartisan debate."
Throughout the debate, both candidates stressed the
importance of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. They
delved deep into issues ranging from the economy to
healthcare and even addressed the role of the United
Nations. Williams questioned the accuracy of Sestak's statistics pertaining to the number of Americans who lack
healthcare coverage, while Sestak disagreed with offshore
drilling, which is one of the central pillars of Williams's
campaign platform.
The topic of the Iraq War and a possible Iran War also
brought up a heated discussion.
"We are going to win this war and come home with
honor and dignity," Williams said. He later added that
"now is a time to be on the offensive with Iran. Now is a

THE PHOENIX

time to get tougher on economic sanctions." Afterwards,
Sestak noted the current overextension of the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan and warned against the hazard of imposing further strains on the troops by deploying
them elsewhere.
Every question besides the last prompted a rebuttal by
the opposing candidate. Beyond the alloted 30 seconds
though, the candidates were not able to respond further to
statements made by their opponent. In a post-debate interview, the candidates discussed their opinions on the
debateformat.
"I thought the format was very nice, but it was hard to
get into a great deal of detail because there wasn't much
back and forth," Williams said in an interview.
"Nevertheless, I think it gave the people a good thumbnail
of the differences between me and Joe Sestak."

"I think that this form [of debate]...
provided an opportunity for a
substantive and a fairly in-depth
discussion far more than any debate
I've seen [for Congress]."
Joe Sestak
Incumbent Democratic candidate
...

With four minutes to answer each question, the debate
was strongly based upon in-depth answers instead of fullon arguing.
"I think that this form [of debate] without question provided an opportunity for a substantive and a fairly indepth discussion far more than any debate I've seen so far
[for Congress]," Sestak said in an interview. "Usually it's
an hour with 45 seconds to a minute for answers. Without
a question, this gave me a great chance to outline my
views."
Although the crowd was told repeatedly that clapping,
cheering and others attempts to interact with the candidates during the debate were unacceptable, the audience
violated these ground rules on two occasions. First, Sestak
October 30, 2008

attacked his opponent with the accusation that Exxon
Mobil financed Williams's trip to Alaska for research on
energy. Williams fired back with a curt rebuttal.
"Yeah nice try but I paid every nickel on that trip as
did the other six congressional candidates," Williams said.
"The power, the oil, the natural gas, the coal of this country belongs to us. The only people standing in our way are
liberals in the United States Congress. It belongs to you
and me and we [have a right] to go explore that."
The clapping and cheering that ensued were quickly
suppressed by the moderator.
When later asked what Congress can do to effectively
limit the power of the imperial president, Williams
responded by stating, "I'm not sure if we've got one." To
this the crowd erupted in laughter, at which point Sestak
stepped in to say that this response was inappropriate.
Other than these two instances, the crowd remained
quiet and there were few interruptions. After the debate
ended, the candidates stayed to talk with anyone who
wanted to give their say. According to Dietrich, after all of
the preparations, the debate ran smoothly.
"I think they did well," Dietrich said. "They respected
the time frames because there were limitations. They
addressed the questions in a straightforward way."
Before the debate began and the camera started rolling,
some members ofthe crowd expressed a concern about the
bias that might result from holding the event at such a
strikingly liberal location.
"How did the League of Women Voters choose such a
neutral site?" a crowd member sarcastically asked, standing up to make himself heard. When the crowd laughed
and Dietrich did not present a direct answer, he asked, "So
you won't answer?"
Although the debate took place on the predominantly
politically liberal campus, the crowd that filled up LPAC
Cinema consisted mainly of local citi2ens and very few
students. Many people boasted their favorite presidential
candidate, with both McCain and Obama receiving atten...

tion.

This debate, planned in September, marks only the
third debate for the 7th District U.S. Congress position in
the last decade. Before the two one-hour debates held for
the 2006 term, the candidates did not have any formal
debates. This debate stands as one of the final campaigning opportunities before the Nov. 4 election.

NOLArize! works to focus revitalization on the future
BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu

Four years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New
Orleans, many displaced residents are still unable to return
to their still flood-damaged homes, and vitalelements of the
city's infrastructure have yet to be repaired. While these
rundown conditions persist, there is some worry that the
country at large has forgotten about the city's need for
restoration. "I guess it's because the tragedy has now
become such an abstract concept since the damage no
longer floods news reports every day," Michelle Walters 'l2
said.
Refocusing the public's attention on the ongoing crisis
is precisely the goal of New Orleans Week, a six-day program packed with events relating to the reconstruction of
New Orleans. "We want to come in with this culturaTperspective so that people can see how amazing the culture is,"
Marsha Davis 'lO, one of the event's leading organizers,
said. The week's goal, she said, is to emphasize the human
dimension of the infrastructure crisis so that Swarthmore
students can realize that in helping New Orleans "they are
affecting people."
New Orleans Week offers a variety of activities that will
encourage students to immerse themselves in New
Orleans' distinctive culture. Events include Wednesday's
Desserts ofNew Orleans in Shane Lounge, which offered an
opportunity to sample New Orleanian desserts, a screening
of "Shake the Devil Off," a documentary the week's committee describes as being about "a predominantly black
Catholic church in New Orleans and its important role in
the community," and a "NOLArize! Dinner," which will
give students an opportunity to sample New Orleanian cuisine. The event will culminate in a benefit concert, the date
of which has yet to be announced.
By focusing on the cultural aspects of New Orleans,
NOLArize!, the organization sponsoring the event, hopes to
personalize the problem of restoring New Orleans. Davis
said, "This year we want to bring people the culture of New
Orleans. We want them to understand why the cause of
rebuilding this city is such an important one. For a people
to demonstrate this sort of resilience and strength, there
must be something unique and special going on. New
Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. It's a melting pot of all different cultures. It is a representation of the United States."

Anne Hu Phoenix Staff

Students gather in Parrish Parlors for a round of New Orleans Week-themed Jeopardy.
NOLArize! hopes to continue offering support to New
Orleans in future semesters, although the organization is
not limiting its focus to hurricane relief. According to
Davis, "We are not going to focus exclusively on Katrina
because we want to move into the future." NOLArize! was
founded in 2006 by Marissa Davis 'OB, Marsha Davis's sister, who was frustrated with the government's lackluster
response to the tragedy of HurricaneKatrina.
She soon began the Katrina Relief effort, which led
weeklong trips to New Orleans to help tutor and mentor
children in grassroots community centers. Junior John
Boucard attended one such trip in 2007, and has been
actively involved in the organization ever since. "The more
I talked to the students, the more I understood the gravity
of the impact of the storm. From their point of the view,
they had so much hope whereas we saw it as nothing but
disastrous. They did not let the storm bring down their
spirits," Boucard explained.

This sort of interaction with local communities is central to NQLArize's mission. "We focus on communicating
directly with the community ... listening to what they have
to say rather than imposing [our] ideas," Davis says. Unlike
many trips thatseek to provide physical aid to the city, this
organization also seeks to "rebuild the spirit of New
Orleans [through] educational programs," Boucard says.

FMF leads campaigns
in both legal and
community fronts
about pressing issues
for women everywhere, from expanding the
role of women in law enforcement, to public
education on emergency contraception, to
ensuring that clinics are available, accessible, and safe for all women.
"Two really exciting things I did this
summer were to spearhead the data collection for exposing fake clinics as well as campaign to work towards subsidizing birth control, or at least showing the repercussions of
the Deficit Reduction Act," Nguyen said.
The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 limited
reimbursements for pharmacies that sold
products at discounted prices. Thus, college
health centers have been forced to sell birth
control at two and three times their previous
prices, severely decreasing the number of
students who are able to afford it.
For Nguyen, the link between feminism
and the upcoming election is a crucial one.

During her search for summer internship opportunities last spring, Candice
Nguyen 'll came across a position available
with the Feminist Majority Foundation in
her hometown of Los Angeles, a national
non-profit organization founded in 1987 that
is "dedicated to women's equality, reproductive health, and nonviolence," according its

Web site.
Awarded the internship out of a very
large pool of applicants, Nguyen started
work immediately after her return home
from Swarthmore. Her job included being
part of FMF's Get Out Her Vote campaign to
increase female turnout at the polls. In fact,
Nguyen was featured in a Public Service
Announcement for Get Out Her Vote, which
included a mix of celebrities and noncelebrities. "The Los Angeles office has the
benefit of access to celebrities and high-profile people in the media. So one thing FMF
has tried to do is to appeal to young women
and voters by relaying their message
through people they can identify with,"
Nguyen said.
Her appearance in the PSA came as a surprise. "Originally, I was just going to be the
coffee girl [as an intern]... But someone just
grabbed me and put me into makeup. I was
surprised to see that they took that footage
and put it into five or six different PSA

"It is the difference between electing a

Khan recalled a time when women's
rights issues were not even on the national
agenda. "I think about women who literally
put their lives on the line so that I could
walk up to the ballot box, I think about the

Civil Rights movement and the people who
made sure that the right to vote was not
something that just existed on paper, all of
these Americans who believed in their
hearts that participating in elections is
something worth dying for
how could I
ever think about skipping an election?" she
said. "Voting is the first and most basic act
of political agency; people died to make it
happen, and there is no justification for not

taking it seriously."
Nguyen emphasized that voting is imperative for everyone, not just women. In an
election that is sure to make the history
books, everyone's voice should be heard. "I
was just reading this article that said if
you're not sure who you want to vote for,
then you shouldn't vote at all. I completely
disagree with that statement," Nguyen said,
adding that voters have no excuse to be

uninformed about the candidates and their

platforms. "It is our obligation as citizens to

educate ourselves and be aware of the issues
that are going to affect us. If I had to give a
message to anyone, it would be to inform
yourselves
and vote accordingly. It's the
only way change can manifest itself," she
said.

about the need to maximize voter turnout.

"Too muchhas been sacrificed and too much
is at stake for you to not vote," she said.
Nguyen grew up in a family that prioritized political engagement. "My parents
immigrated from Vietnam in 1973 as political refugees," she said. "I have never met
[people] more patriotic, dedicated and so
truly embracing of the ability to vote and
exercise rights as citizens thanmy parents. I
remember going to voting polls with them as
a child, and I don't believe my parents have
ever missed an election
presidential,

"Originally, I was just going
to be the coffee girl [as an
intern]... But someone

Nguyen said that she welcomes questions
from fellow students interested in getting
involved with FMF. "I highly recommend
women of color to get involved. The majority of leadership in FMF is over 40 years old
and Caucasian. That's not to say that there
aren't young women of color involved, but
they are at lower positions. This is how you
represent yourself and help form govern-

ment and policy and reach out to other com-

munities."

Recognizing that positions in the nonprofit sector are sometimes passed up
because of financial issues, she said, "I really wish FMF gave stipends. It's really unfortunate that a number of non-profits don't. I
was kind of biting the bullet because I needed money this summer, but I decided that
working at this organization was inherently
more valuable. The only reason I was able to
do that was because I was able to find housing in L.A. Stipends would give more access
to students of different socio-economic backgrounds."
Still, Nguyen, who is also involved in
Feminist Majority on campus, cites her
experience as an intern with FMF as "selfactualizing

and life-changing."

drivers for the new Saturday shuttle
and to gain approval from the SBC.
"It's really hard to hire van drivers,"
Coleman said. He mentioned that
van drivers for the Saturday
ML/PPR shuttle have to be willing to
show up on time on Saturday mornings. It also took a few weeks for
Coleman to calculate the expected
costs to run the shuttle and to gain
approval from the SBC. The decision
in favor of the Saturday shuttle was
made about a week and a half before
October break.
Gabriela Moats 'l2, an ML resident who has not yet taken the
Saturday shuttle, hopes that the
shuttle will run more efficiently
than it had at the beginning of the
school year. "It's kind of a drag when
it comes too early or too late," she
said.
Nonetheless, with enough student
drivers, the shuttles are expected to
be more regular than they had been
at first. "We look forward to all our
shuttles continuing to run smoothly," Coleman said in an e-mail sent
out to the student body.
Nevertheless, Moats does not
expect to use the Saturday shuttle
often, mentioning that she has no
intention of leaving her dorm on
Saturday morning. "I eat breakfast
here," she said. "Most people from
Mary Lyon would not go to Sharpies
for breakfast on Saturday morning,"

The availability of the weekend

happens every Saturday. According
to Michael Xu 'IL an ML Student
Academic Mentor, about half of the
people who attend ML breakfast are

from dorms other than ML.
"In terms of convenience, it's
great," Xu said. When the weather is
unfavorable, the shuttle makes getting back to ML much more comfortable. The shuttle also makes it possible to get to campus more easily, a
benefit to ML residents who want to
go to campus for any reason! "I think
it's a great idea," Edwards said. "It
just gives you more options."
Some students have criticized the
service, saying that it is not worth
the cost of running the shuttle. Xu
said that many of those who would
not use the Saturday shuttle may
find it a bad use of the SBC's money.
"I think it's true for all kinds of campus events also,"

he said.

"The

events will benefit some people but
not others."
"I most likely won't use the shuttle," Genevieve McGahey 'l2, another ML resident, said. She said that
the shuttle will be convenient for her
if she does decide to go on campus on
Saturday morning. "It's really nice
that they provide the service,
because the weather may not be good
and we have time to sleep in."

Some students mentioned that

having the shuttle run on Sunday
morning, when ML breakfast isn't
served, would also be a good idea. "If
you want to get brunch, you have to
walk, and if you have nothing else to
do, you just walk back," Xu said. He

also mentioned that it would be nice
to have the shuttle run during the
day, but that it may not be feasible
due to the cost. "If [the shuttle] did
run on Saturday afternoons, I'd
probably take it," McGahey said.

"Most people taking
the shuttle would be
people on campus
going to ML for the ML

breakfast."
Gabriela Moats 'l2
For the moment, the Saturday
shuttle is a test-run. Coleman and
the SBC will wait to see if students
use the Saturday shuttle before
extending the
shuttle service
throughout the year, Coleman said.
Accordingly, if the shuttle is not popular, the service might be terminated. "We'll just have to wait and see,"
McGahey said.
In the meantime, several ML residents, like Xu, have taken advantage of the Saturday shuttle and plan
to continue doing so. "For me, it's
great," he said.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Candidates pursue reform for financial aid
BY MARISSA LANG
THE DIAMONPBACK (UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND)
(U-WIRE)
Students unhappy with financial aid its
availability, application process and eligibility requirements
have yet another factor to consider on Election Day. Sens.
Barack Obama (D-Dl.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) both plan
to reform the financial aid system but have different priori-

-

ties.
Both presidential candidates want to simplify the system
and lower the financial burden on families, but they differ
on the specifics. Obama has focused on new plans, including
the introduction of a refundable tax credit toward higher
education and the elimination of the Free Application for
Federal StudentAid. Meanwhile, McCain is pushing to eliminate the reliance on federal loans and consolidate existing
aid programs and applications.
A key feature of Obama's plan is creating a fully refundable tax credit that will ensure the first $4,000 of a college
education is "completely free for most Americans," according to his Web site. The credit wouldbe contingent upon the
completion of 100 hours of community service per year.
Some students say this requirement would not deter
them from participating in the program.
"No money is free money," University of Maryland senior
kinesiology major Sarah Easterwood said. "There's always
fine print in everything, but if there really was a chance to
do community service to help fund college I did 100 hours
to graduate high school
I would definitely do it. With
something like that, you're giving back to the community.
It's a win-win."
McCain, on the other hand, looks to reform the federal
studentloan system, making it a last resort for students and
shifting more accountability to the private sector.
A spokesman for the Republican National Committee

pointed to the platform outlined on McCain's website, which
states a "more effective program" will result from increasing
the availability of private sector loans and holding lenders to
the "highest standard of integrity."
Edie Irons, a spokeswoman for The Project on Student
Debt, an independent think tank that studies financial aid,
said that while, ideally, the government should look at
expanding programs that do not require students to pay
back money, student loans continue to be a reality for more
than two-thirds of college students and should be an issue

that candidates consider.

"[Private sector loans] are riskier, more expensive loans,

and should be used as a last resort," Irons said. "We don't
anticipate a problem being able to get federal loans, but
there needs to be a combination of better advice and counseling, so that as students are making those decisions so they

don't borrow too much and they are able to choose the safest,
most affordable options."
Both candidates identify a need to simplify the application process students and families must undergo to obtain
financial assistance.
Obama's call to eliminate the FAFSA is a step the
Democratic National Committee officials said will simplify
the process and encourage more people to apply for aid.
McCain does not explicitly mention the overhaul of
FAFSA in any of his proposals, but he emphasizes the need
for a simpler process, so students aren't deterred from applying for aid. He aims to consolidate grant and award programs to reduce confusion and the need to fill out multiple,
complicated applications.
The FAFSA asks 127 questions across five pages, which is
more than many federal tax returns.
"I've always thought the FAFSA was kind of 8.5.,"
Easterwood said. "My father was a pastor for 20 years, and
we have three kids in our family that need to be put through

college, and he doesn't get paid a lot. [My parents have] made
a lot of sacrifices so that we could have a childhood and [the
FAFSA] bases everything off of numbers that just aren't

accurate."

According to a report published by the Institute for
College Access and Success, an estimated 15 million lowincome students who were likely eligible for Pell Grants did
not apply for aid in 2004, an increase of 76 percent from 2000.
"Instead of digging through piles of papers, doing calculations with various lines of data, and transferring numbers
by hand from a tax form to a worksheet to an application,
students and parents could give the Department of
Education direct access to needed income information," the
report states.

Vice President of the institute, Lauren Asher, said if the
Internal Revenue Service is allowed to directly forward data
to the Education Department, more students would likely

apply for federal aid and it would reduce processing costs
paid by colleges.
Students, however, remain skeptical of candidates' proposals.
Many students who are forced to take on multiple jobs
and loans in both the federal and private sector in order to
pay for school are hesitant about the proposed shift in
emphasis and think instead, the next president should look
at the root of the problem: rising college tuition rates.
"The government should do whatever they can to find a
way to lower the interest rates on these loans that exist, but
also just make college affordable," said Kevin Mawyer n, a
sophomore criminology and criminal justice major. "College
students are going to come out thousands of dollars in debt
that they only have to pay because it's so expensive to
begin with. I honestly don't understand why the same classes at different institutions cost more just because of the
name that gets put on your degree."

Google prevents drunken e-mails Text-alert systems could
with new feature, Mail Goggles fail during emergencies
BY JANE ADAMS
THE POST (OHIO UNIVERSITY)
In a world where communi(U-WIRE)
cation is 24/7 and a drunken message can
turn into a social war, one e-mail provider
is trying to stop the late night e-oops.
The new feature added to Google's
Gmail on Oct. 6, was named Mail Goggles
after beer goggles, which simulate the way
things appear to someone intoxicated. The
feature is intended to stop drunk or tired
messaging late at night.
When activated Mail Goggles asks five
math questions which must be answered
correctly within 60 seconds. The difficulty
level of the questions is adjustable and can
be set to levels one through five.

"[Sending emails while
drunk is] all right in the
morning. It is usually
embarrassing, but fixable."
Adrienne Hapanowicz
Jacqueline Jones, an Ohio University
sophomore studying journalism, said that
though she has never sent or received e-

mails while drunk, she often receives late
night text messages from her ex-boyfriend.
"I send a lot of text messages [when
drinking], but I have a spell checker so people think I am in the perfect state of mind,"
she said. "So that feature for my cell phone
would definitely be nice." Like all experimental Gmail Lab features, Mail Goggles

was created based on requests and the personal experiences of Google staff.
"Sometimes I send messages I shouldn't
send. Gmail can't always prevent you from
sending messages you might later regret,
but
Mail Goggles may help," said Jon
Perlow, the Google engineer who created
Mail Goggles, on the Official Gmail Blog.
Drunk e-mailing is not something that
Kiersten Bonifant, a sophomore studying
visual communication, turns to when she
wants to communicate. "I have probably

ing."
As for the consequences of drunken e-

mailing, Facebook or texting, Adrienne
Hapanowicz, a sophomore studying visual
communications, said are normally easily
resolved. "It's all right in the morning. It's
usually embarrassing, but fixable," she

said.

But e-mail lacks many clues people gain
from face-to-face or voice-to-voice communication such as tone, inflection and gestures, and that can lead to conflict, said Tom
Daniels, a communications professor at OU.
"We have some pretty good evidence that email exchanges make it easier for conflicts
to emerge and those conflicts are harder to
manage in that environment," Daniels said.
He added that a feature like Mail Goggles
isn't capable of solving all the conflicts that
instant communication can cause.

"There is a point at which it's time to log
out of the email and have a face-to-face conversation," Daniels said. "E-mail is not the
place to deal with complex problems yet
many of us use the medium to do precisely
that."

BY JIM MYERS
ARIZONA DAILY WILDCANT (U.
ARIZONA)

(U-WIRE)
Cell phone text messages
may not be an effective way of getting
information out in an emergency, according to a recent report by a Georgia
Institute of Technology professor.

But officials in Penn's Division of
Public Safety say they are confident the
UPennAlert emergency system
which
sends notifications through text, e-mail
and voice messages
will work if it is
needed.
Patrick Traynor, the Georgia Tech
computer science professor who developed the report, claims that the architecture of cell phone networks makes the
system unable to deliver a high volume of
emergency messages in a short period of
time.
His report concludes that cell phone
networks cannot send out a sufficient
number of alert messages in 10 minutes,
which is the goal set by the Emergency
Alert System charter, a national publicwarning system.
Eugene Janda, DPS' chief of fire and
emergency services, disagrees that cell
phones might cause such a problem. He
said, "SMS is the way to go," referring to
text message alerts.
Janda cited the University's recent
shelter-in-place drill as evidence that text
messages are effective in issuing an

emergency alert.
In the shelter-in-place drill, roughly
6,000 students were targeted to receive a
text message alert through UPennAlert.

October 30, 2008

In the event of a real emergency, that
number would be more than 50,000.

However, Janda said he is confident
that the system would still work, but said
that it might take a little longer for the
system to process such a huge volume of
messages.
"It's a way to get information

out very

quickly, as opposed to recorded voice
messages," he said.
Vice President for Public Safety
Maureen Rush agreed with Janda, saying
that DPS was "very happy with the
response of the system."
The main concern she expressed was
that some people don't have the DPS
number in their phone, making them
likely to ignore an alert.
She added that text messages are just
one component of the University's emergency-alert system. Penn is in the initial
stages of planning for a siren-alert system that would put loudspeakers around
campus for use during emergencies.
Security on Campus, a non-profit
organization that promotes safety on college campuses, was not so quick to dismiss the validity of the new finding.
"It confirms what has always been a
concern of ours: getting information to
people in a timely manner," said
Jonathan Kassa, executive director for
Security on Campus.
Kassa said the study underscored the
importance of using multiple methods of

communication.
"It doesn't mean that we shouldn't use
these systems," he said. "Now that we
know it's a weakness, we can work to

improve it."

MING CAI

The Swatorialist
There are three things on my mind right now that are
intersecting in absurdity: Palin's $150,000 wardrobe
makeover, Paris Hilton's "My New BFF" TV show and
Comme des Garcons's Spring/Summer 'O9 collection. In
the face of the current economic downturn, such things
seem lavishly contrary to any frugality that people
should be exercising. The collections shown earlier this
month during fashion week SSO9 left style critics con-

fused: while some showed refinement reflective of the
recession, most were as extravagant and over-the-top as
ever. Comme des Garcon's line featured models with bigger-than-life hair, piled sky-high in a manner reminiscent of and clearly inspired by Marie Antoinette. Not
only does the line visually evoke everyone's favorite
French hedonist, it also channels her attitude that
"everything is fine and dandy" while the outside/real
world is plummeting into chaos. Much of the fashion
world is stuck in a "Marie Antoinette moment," designer
Jeremy Scott commented; it is simply not conceding to
reality.

But if the fashion world is having a "Marie Antoinette
moment," how is that affecting the rest of us average citizens? Well, for one thing, it means that VP nominee
Sarah Palin has not exactly been thinking much about
cutting back on personal spending. While her appeal and
reach may be to average moms and working class families, that certainly hasn't stopped her from using cam-

to find someone to tag along with
her to live a spoiled lifestyle. I'm
not saying Paris Hilton is a terrible person. It's more that the
marketing for such a show is
indicative of what people

Infamous 'Terror' at old penitentiary is a screaming good time
BY EMILY CRAWFORD

ecrawfol@swarthmore.edu

Eastern State Penitentiary, the local
abandoned prison and site of many a firstyear seminar fieldtrip, takes on a more
sinister role every fall when it becomes
"Terror Behind the Walls," the numberone haunted house in America. Known as
America's most historic prison, the

Eastern State Penitentiary began housing
annual Halloween fundraisers over a
decade ago to pay for the preservation of
the national historic landmark; today,
these fundraisers have evolved into what
is supposedly one of the. scariest haunted
attractions in the country.
On weekends and select weeknights
from Sept. 19 until Nov. 2, crowds of people are ushered through the ominous
crumbling gate of the high exterior walls,
to the sounds of spooky music and maniacal shrieks. Once inside, visitors wander
through the prepared sections of the 11acre structure at their leisure, encountering various unsavory characters all along
the way.
Because of its proximity to the city, the
prison's annual haunted house is a
famous
or rather infamous event for
Philadelphia residents and Swarthmore
students alike. "I was going to go once

10

when I was in high school," Ariel
Martino 'll said. "I went to buy tickets

and I just totally chickened out. When
you're waiting to get tickets, you have to
wait outside the walls and it looks so
medieval and creepy with all the haunted
house noises in the background. I saw
grown men leaving looking terrified and
I just couldn't do it."

point, visitors in the "Night Watch" section are provided with a flashlight for an
excursion into the dark perimeter of the
penitentiary, surrounded by fog and darkness; this section is specifically labeled as
"not for the faint of heart."
In fact, the penitentiary is considered
so adrenaline-inducing that children
under the age of seven are not allowed on
the property while the haunted house is
open and it is suggested that the children

According to brochures, the horror
only increases once inside. The tour is

divided into five different sections and
detours, including the cellblocks and
facilities, a 3D section where the prisondoctor-turned-mad-scientist conducts a
human experiment and being taken to the
"processing center" via prison bus. At one

who are old enough visit on Family
Nights, when the actors know to back off
from traumatized kids who say the safety
phrase "monster be good." If nothing else,
these precautions alone could fill you
with spine-tingling foreboding.
"It was the scariest haunted house I've
ever been to," said Terror Behind the
Walls survivor Jon Schaefer 'll, who went
last year" I think what made it so scary
was that the actors, and the costuming
too, are really really good. They try to
freak people out as much as they possibly
can." When asked exactly how scary it
was, he said, "I was actually expecting it
to be more scary. When you go there, you
get creeped out by the crumbling exterior
and the fact that it's a real prison, but
once you're inside, I guess they can't take
you into the parts that are still old ruins,
and what you go through is a lot more like

October 30, 2008

a haunted house than an actual prison."
It appears that what scares visitors
the most is the knowledge that the cellblocks and hallways they are walking
through were occupied by real criminals
who are long dead, and many of whom
died in those actual cells. There have been
many claims made to actual ghost sightings on the property, enough to attract
TV's "Ghost Hunters" and "MTV's Fear"
to film episodes at the site.
"I haven't gone yet but I'm planning to
check it out as soon as I can," Peter
Liebenson 'll said. "I love horror movies
especially
so I think it would be fun
since it's in a real former prison. I've
heard from friends that it's scary to visit
the museum even when it's not a haunted
house, so I can only imagine how crazy it
...

is around Halloween."

Located five blocks away from the

Philadelphia Museum of Art, Eastern
State Penitentiary is ideally located for
college students around the Philadelphia
area who are looking for a few screams on
Halloween.
"Terror Behind Walls" is open every
night through Nov. 2 from 7 p.m. through

midnight.

Valerie Clark peruses the final result of the Polaroid Project at the Kitao Gallery.

'Polaroid Project' promotes shared art
BY TIFFANY UAO
tliaol@swarthmore.edu

A fresher, more collective-oriented approach to art is
being brought to the Swarthmore community this fall as
Pun/ctum, a new magazine devoted solely to photography, arrives on the scene amidst the typical spate of campus literary magazines.
Back in Fall 2007, current Pun/ctum Editor-in-Chief
Cheryl Tse 'O9 and alumni Eve Lampenfeld 'OB, Linda
Huang 'OB and Meagan Hu 'OB first came up with the idea
of a photography magazine when the budding photographers decided that a proper platform for photography didn't exist on campus.
"We didn't like the quality of images printed on existing campus publications, that the images were primarily
used to break up the text [or] that images selected were a

bit lackluster," Tse said.
A year later, Pun/ctum magazine was born. Tse was
inspired to christen the magazine with its unique bifurcated moniker when she came across the term "punctum" in Roland Barthes' "Camera Lucida."
In the novel, Barthes adopts the term puhctum, which
technically is the corner of your eye where tears drain
out, to describe a "moment that is purely personal to the
individual and in which you are pierced by an image,"
Tse said.
In addition to Tse, the Pun/ctum board is made up of
Linda Wang 'O9, Maria Khim 'lO, Abe Bae 11, Blaine
O'Neill 'l2, Val Clark 11 and Matt Goodman 'l2.
According to Tse, the core principle of Pun/ctum is
"really to provide a means for Swarthmore students of
past, present, and future to present their perspectives
through photography."
Keeping in line with this broader vision, Pun/ctum
recently held the successful Polaroid Project in order to
announce the inception of their magazine and to promote
their agenda of shared art.
According to Assistant Layout Editor Maria Khim 11,
the Polaroid Project really sought to "include the whole
campus and go for a more collaborative approach."
On Oct. 25, students were invited to borrow Polaroid
cameras and to snap three photos each. Slots for renting
out the cameras quickly filled up and in total, 80 students
contributed their photography. The resulting photos
were incorporated into a larger art exhibit that was displayed at the Kitao Gallery this past Sunday, Oct. 26.

THE PHOENIX

Emphasizing the communal nature behind this project and behind Pun/ctum, the Polaroid pictures were left
anonymous. The pictures were displayed in batches that
were disparate and yet still appeared loosely unified. The
intended message, Tse said, was that "it's not just about
the photographer and their perspective. It's how each
image is read by the collective community."
The message was not lost on gallery viewers such as
Xiaoxia Zhuang 'lO, also a Polaroid Project participant.

"I liked the idea that students from all different academic and artistic backgrounds could participate and
contribute to form a collective piece ofart," Zhuang said,
"From Engineering to English majors, the Polaroid
Project showed that everyone has a unique perspective."
Jumping off from the popularity of the Polaroid
Project, Pun/ctum plans to do more projects in order to
continue fostering this creativity through the photographic medium, such as Polaroid transfers.
Currently Pun/ctum exists only as an online magazine, with the print edition in production. The online
magazine is hosted at www.pim-ctum.squarespace.com.
As a way of making the magazine a collaborative venture
among students, Punc/tum is designed to be open-source.
Students are invited to submit photographs either via the
Flickr
or through
group
feed
e-mail at
pun.ctum.mag@gmail.com. The idea is for the site to be
user-generated but with evidence of an editorial voice.
"We'd like to have the magazine be as inclusive or
egalitarian as possible, but without compromising the
integrity of the medium," Tse said.
Pun/ctum will be published in print biannually under
a new general theme each semester. This semester,
inspired by the movement of images in this modern digital age, the theme will be "mobility."
For the inaugural print issue of Pun/ctum, the board
hopes to change the existing format for exhibiting photographs. The size of the magazine will be between that of
small literary magazines and that of commercial magazines. Images will be variably aligned page by page so
that the viewer is encouraged to hold the magazine differently to view each of the images "correctly."
"As I personally often justflip through pages, we'dlike
our viewers to engage more with the material," Tse said,
"My interest in the format mostly lies in dismantling normative ways of looking, or offering a different viewing
experience, but for others it might be as simple as having
it fit better in their pockets."
October 30, 2008

Last Friday, the queer performance artist, Sara Felder,
electrified Hillel's usually subdued Shabbat service with her
arsenal of juggling props. Bond Hall proved too small for Sara
Felder's explosive personality and dynamic one-woman show.
Felder
In her performance
a part of Coming Out Week
explored issues of spirituality through art and humor, disarming the audience with her engaging introduction: "My
name is Sara Felder and I am a Jew for juggling."
Felder began performing in 1984 with San Francisco's
Pickle Family Circus. She has also toured with Jugglers for
Peace in Cuba, the Women's Circus in Nicaragua and Joel
Grey's Borscht Capades in addition to participating in Jewish
and Yiddish cultural festivals in Amsterdam, New York, Los
Angeles and Toronto. Felder views juggling as a medium for
conveying her creative vision, engaging with others and promoting social justice. While Felder has experimented with
numerous performance arts, she insists that juggling is her
true passion. "Juggling is my love. It's how I entered theater,
it's how everything started."
For almost an hour, Sara Felder used juggling, acting and
dancing to explore the sometimes humorous complications of
simultaneous membership in two marginal groups: the queer
community and the Jewish community. With her spontaneous sense of humor, Felder was able to salvage the few
failed tricks. She quickly won over the crowd despite her visible nervousness with self-deprecating commentary. "Thank
you, but you don't need to applaud when I drop them. I don't
need your pity," Felder said after a botched trick.
The artist also engaged her audience with occasionally
provocative statements. After a question-answer round, she
observed, "You know, you're not very pretty, but you're very
smart!" Incorporating the audience's reaction is one of
Felder's signature tactics. "In solo performance, the audience
is the other performer. I try to make the people feel comfortable and willing to participate by amusing and surprising
them." This performance demonstrated the effectiveness of
the strategy, as participants veered left and right to avoid
being showered with water after Felder's lively interpretation
of Sholom Asch's "God of Vengeance" using Barbie dolls.
Sara Felder does not shy away from controversy. Her body
of work, including radical solo circus theater and witty multiactor plays, explores politically and socially contentious
issues. Despite the heightened visibility of her views under
the spotlight of her developing career, Felder has remained
faithful to her convictions while using humor to make controversial issues accessible to a diverse audience. The themes
of her plays and performances are serious, but the form is
comic, engaging and even vaudevillian. Speaking about the
intentionalrole ofhumor in art, Sara Felder shed light on the
difficult task of approaching controversial issues. "Religion,
Art can give you a window into all that.
sexuality, politics
And it's fun, you know. It's not a lecture," Felder said.
The audience's reaction to Felder's performance was overwhelmingly positive. Maki Somoset 'l2 was initially confused
by the unconventional format of the performance, but eventually came around to Felder's unique sense of humor and
style. "I underestimated it at first, but in the end I was definitely won over by the quirkiness."
The content of Felder's performances is heavily informed
by her personal experiences. "Things I've lived, things I've
felt, things that are important to me I use that in my shows
because it gives my performance authenticity," Felder said.
Reflecting on her experience with queer theater in Israel
where the Jewish community comprises a majority
she
alluded to the challenges that Jews have historically encountered in the United States and elsewhere. Felder said that she
has felt marginalized at various points in her career, when it
has been difficult to convey the challenges faced by minority
communities to a mainstream audience. "It's always a challenge to manage to have a mainstream career. Most of the
material was written for mainstream theater." Many of
Felder's jokes feature Jewish or queer references and can
seem obscure or inaccessible to people who do not belong to
one of these groups.
William Lin 'l2, recently read an excerpt from the author's
most recent book and was therefore more attuned to her performance style. "I didn't catch all the references or get all the
jokes, but it didn't really matter because she was entertaining
in so many different ways. How can you not find a clever reading of 'One Dyke Two Dyke Red Dyke Blue Dyke' funny?"
Felder is enthusiastic about her upcoming projects, including a play that she is currently writing for the Philadelphia
Theater Initiative. Entitled "Melancholy, a comedy," the play
will explore the issue of mental illness.

of his surroundings, connecting through his
mural the trees on either side of the building and
transforming the parking lot into a park. He uses
squares of color to imitate pixilation, which
authors Jane Golden, Robin Rice, Monica Yant
Kinney, David Graham and Jack Ramsdale compare to architectural drawing, labeling it a "style of
fracturing," in their book "Philadelphia Murals and
the Stories They Tell." The other murals in the
"Season" series
"Summer: The Meeting,"
"Autumn" and "Crystal Snowscape"— are also
composed of these squares of color.

Today, I didn't fight the Antichrist much, but I did do
some interior design. Praise the lord! God gave me the aid of
a builder named Teddy, who helped me turn the nearby
EBGames and Duane Reade drug stores into fortresses for
God! Now, the people in Modell's sure were confused when
Teddy and I busted in and started throwing aside basketballs
and replacing them with deep fryers (to feed the righteous),
but it was for the greater good.
However, my faith was challenged when I used the power
God gave me to learn about Teddy's "life story," only to learn
that his wife and kids left him behind in more ways than one
because he's a pedophile? WHAT? Eli Eli, lama sabacthani! I sent him off to make a home for our magical choir
director before settling into a well-earned sleep.
Before I went to bed, God tried to lecture me about how
evolution wasn't real, but I just politely ignored him. Geesh,
I mean, hasn't everyone seen "Expelled"?

Jesus Christ. Just... Jesus Christ.
I'm at a loss for words at how to describe "Left
Behind: Eternal Forces," a (allegedly) real-time strategy
(RTS) PC game (think Warcraft) based on the infamous
eschatological, apocalyptic book series. I mean, yes, it's
bizarre and full of some of the wackiest end-of-days theology you can find apart from this one dude I met at
Dupont Circle who earnestly believed that Barack
Obama's potential ascendancy to the presidency marked
the apocalypse because he was a "Ham-child."
Coincidentally, it's also the worst RTS game I've played
in my life.
Perhaps unfortunately, I came into the possession of
this game thanks to a Daily Gazette sex columnist (Sup,
Dr. Strokes!) and felt a perverse obligation and curiosity
to try my hand at leading the righteous Tribulation
Force against the Global Community (led by the
Antichrist). And the only way I've been able to parse this
Goliath-sized clusterfuck is to engage in some (poorly)
imagined narrative.

Day 1

Dear Diary,
Today, God told me that I needed to destroy the
Antichrist. Neat, huh? I was just strolling along the
streets of New York when all of a sudden I was struck
with these amazing visions. Families playing baseball! A
sassy waitress who gives "Jesus hugs!" And
Draco
Malfoy? I could hardly believe my eyes, but it seems as
though the real threat of "Harry Potter" wasn't its witchcraft, but the mad celebrity of its young albino stars.
Ack! It was clear from his vaguely menacing looks that
something had to be done, and that it was up to me to
lead the crusade!
God then said that I needed to convince eight people
on the streets to be my Christ-friend, and that I needed to
take them all to an abandoned chapel so we could, um,
pray together, I guess. This part of my quest was actually pretty simple, as walking up to people quickly made
both of us glow with holy light, and soon enough they
were simply compelled to follow me to the church. Also,
everyone got to wear a sweatervest when they joined my
party. Sweatervests rule! Go, God!
However, the path of the righteous is not easy, my
friends. God placed these funny, impenetrable dotted
lines between the church and me, so I had to go all the
way around the city rather than making a direct path.
God Works In Mysterious Ways
and also really likes
cardio, I guess.
What's worse were those damn gay purse-wielding
thieves. You know how it is, running into a pack of more
than a dozen grimacing men in tube-tops, wielding purses full of poison vials. They tried to stop my Christfriends with their death purses, but we ran away while
furiously praying, only to run into some equally queer
musicians who tried to fool us into sin with their rock
and roll music and rap lyrics (which made them glow a
demonic red
I'd never seen this happen to 50 Cent
before, but whatevz). Their music made some of my
friends lose their faith and, more importantly, their
sweatervests. Oh, no!
After I found enough special friends and took them to
the abandoned church, God thanked me and then started
to pipe Christian rock music into my soul, asking if I'd
like to buy it. I politely declined, because if my exper...

Day 3

Dear Diary,
When I woke up this morning, my EB-Bank and the
Mo'Christ Cafe were MISSING. Huh?!? God told me I needed
to wait around and build them again. I hope God is trying to
teach me an important lesson through all this, uh, illogical

repetition.
Actually, it's a bit surprising whatlittle fighting I need to

do in my holy quest to eradicate Satan from God's green
Earth. In fact, all I've been doing is running from gays
and finding special friends and founding banks. Is this
being
what Jesus did? (I'm honestly not all that sure
preached to just makes me glow more and God says I
need to pay him $l5O for the Bible upgrade and I think
he's ripping me off and I think it's sacrilegious for me to
think that and oh God I'm going to Hell aren't I?!?!). I
once even tried to beat up one of the purse gays, but this
made me weirdly depressed and I almost lost my sweatervest. I tried praying at them too, but this didn't help
either. This kinda sucks.
God tried to sell me Christian hip-hop tonight. No.
...

Dear Diary,
Today, God told me that I needed
to destroy the Antichrist.
Day 4
Dear Diary,
It was all gone again. Purse gays were back. I am
starting to believe that they are really the alpha and the
omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

God tried to sell me a ticket to Jerusalem. I told him
where to shove it.

drama that make you think while you

laugh. Following is a list of ten episodes
that are, in my opinion, the best of the

bunch.

10. "The Father, the Son, and the Holy
Guest-Star" (Season IS)
This episode is the best of the later seasons, combining incisive social commentary, great gags and a spot-on guest appearance by Liam Neeson as the hip Catholic
priest who convinces Bart and Homer to
convert (although, really, all Homer needed
was the free pancakes). The story relies less
on outlandish plot devices than later
episodes do, instead focusing on the
Simpson family's internal conflict and the
show's trademark brand of sharp satire,
which drives home the message of religious
tolerance.
Memorable moment:
The scene in which Marge imagines herself in staid, boring Protestant heaven while
Homer and Bart party it up with the Irish,
Italians and Mexicans in Catholic heaven.

9. "A Streetcar Named Marge" (Season

Four)
An episode that manages to satirize community theater troupes, egomaniacal directors and Ayn Rand and still leave time to
deal with Homer and Marge's maritalcrisis.

THE PHOENIX

Another episode that is known largely
for a musical number (the Emmy-winning
"Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?") this
episode focuses on the travails of everyone's favorite ethnic stereotype, Apu
Nahasapeemapetilon. The episode takes
Homer and Apu from Springfield to the
world's first convenience store located,
not very conveniently, at the top of a

"The Simpsons" is perhaps the defining
piece of pop culture of the last 20 years. The
show's influence has permeated Western
civilization to a degree that's almost frightening. Just think about your classes, guest

are, you will find a "Simpsons" reference

7. "Bart the Daredevil" (Season Two)

This episode is best known as the
episode that contains the Springfield Gorge
Jump, arguably the single most memorable
moment in the show's history. There is,
however, considerably more going on here
than just the one moment; this is an episode
in which Homer and Bart's tense, fractured
and occasionally loving relationship is
explored with depth and feeling.

How could one not include a Sideshow

5. "Whacking Day" (Season Four)
An episode that showcases the mob mentality and bloodlust of the citizens of
Springfield, it's also a classic Bart-and-Lisasave-the-day episode, but with a twist; this
time, Bart acts as the knowledgeable foil to
Lisa's determined crusader as they try to

the gym is just as distasteful, so we put it off
until the next tomorrow, forever. It's a pret-

ty familiar story.
Others of us realize that we have selfcontrol problems and so, when planning
when this week we should work out, we
realize that the gym's pain does not disappear in the future. While this won't make us
perfect, realizing we have a self-control
problem stops us from lying to ourselves,
which is the first step in getting anything

TAMAR LERER

Everybody Eats
I hate going to the gym. Hate. More than
I hate animals in sweaters or chunks offruit
in my yogurt or the fact that behavioral economics knows me better than I know
myself. Regardless, I have to participate in
some form of physical activity in order to
graduate, as the Dean's Office so kindly
reminds me on a rather regular basis. This,
I will now admit, is a good thing. We should
all be exercising in some way for two reasons: Firstly, it is good for you, physically
and emotionally. Secondly, to maintain your
healthy weight or to lose weight in any sort
of healthy way, you have to combine sensible eating habits with sensible exercising
habits, no matter how much that sucks.
So how does one get him or herself to the
gym under such circumstances? Even if the
hatred isn't present, laziness, time constraints and crappy gym hours come into
the play. You need to understand your problem with the gym, find a (more) enjoyable
way to work out, and finally to incentivize
exercise.
The first time I went to a gym was freshman year in college, having gained about 15
pounds and found out it had not gone unnoticed. After Thanksgiving my roommate
forced me down to Mullan as I dragged my
feet and wailed at her. What was I wailing?
"Don't make me go, they are going to laugh
at me."
The secret is that there is no "they."
While many of us nerd-folks have all sorts of
inferiority complexes about physical activity, I will promise you that no one in the gym
is looking at you. The whole point of going
to the gym is to engage in self-improvement,
and everyone at the gym is quite focused on
the self. In addition, everyone looks pretty
goofy at the gym. And Swatties are pretty
nice, so it takes more than your pigeon-toed
running stride to make them laugh at you.
Also, put the damn clip on your shirt if
you're on the treadmill, because everyone
will stare if you fall offof it. And it hurts.
The key to your reluctance, on the other
hand, could be the pure physical costs of
going to the gym. It's a whole seven minutes
out of your way, it's cold outside, the gym
tires you out, forces you to shower and
hurts muscles you weren't aware you had.
This is where behaviorial economics comes
in.

In a nutshell, it goes like this: we all have
self-control problems. This means that we
delay things that have an immediate cost,
such as going to the gym, and don't hold off
as long as we should on things that have an
immediatebenefit. We deal with this in two

done.
Okay, so we realize that no one at the
gym is interested in anyone but themselves

(and the newest issue of Us Weekly) and
that we have a self-control problem. Now

what? Now you find a workout that works
for you. Many women who are trying to lose
weight thinkthat the only way to do so is by
running endlessly. This is not true. I, for
one, never got a runner's high, no matter
how hard or long I ran, and so I was miserable. Then, one day, I discovered the elliptical and my life (and knees) greatly
improved.

More than that, you officially have my
permission to move away from cardio, or, as
one friend put it, "the girlie workout."
There is nothing wrong, ladies, with lifting
some weights or working thosemachines. It
can make you feel powerful and it certainly
makes you look toned.Don't be intimidated

by the bulky guys. Walk straight up to the
leg press, put it on the minimum weight and
start your slow process of strengthening,
(remember, unless you want to bulk up, use
lower weights and more repetitions).
Alternatively, some three or five pound
hand weights and Body By Glamour (at
glamour.com), can help you begin a simple
weight-training regime in your own room.
Take advantage of the wide range of
physical education classes offered at
Swarthmore. By that I do not mean "take
bowling" because that does not count. I
mean check out a dance class, try Pilates, or
get in the pool. I myself am currently fulfilling my last two gym credits by taking ballet.
It forces me out of my comfort zone, gets me
thinking about my whole body and increasing the mind/muscle connection, is improving my posture, and comes with adorable
accessories. It's very hard, and I'm not very
good, but I love it. And that, for me, is an

exercise-related first.

Lastly, incentivize working out. Commit
yourself to working out by going with a
friend, promising yourself a small gift (like
buying a new song for your play list on
iTunes or buying yourself those cute new
running shoes) after you go so many days in
a row or a non-monetary personal reward
(see my last column for suggestions).
Alternatively, dock yourself something
pleasurable if you don't go when you promised you would. Make physical activity part
of your routine, be it every day or 20 minutes
three times a week (and always remember
moderation), and eventually you will actually want to go. Strange, but true.

E-603 fires up Olde Club
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

The evening begins with fire.
Dressed nonchalantly in tight jeans and
large black glasses, Ethan Ward, also
known as E-603, is struggling to unwrap
his newly purchased computer mouse.
A lighter is produced, plastic is burned
and the mouse is liberated from its
packaged prison. This is Ward's triumphant return to Swarthmore after a
raucous and hugely successful set of
mash-ups at last year's Worthstock. So
far, things are going well.
Although his electronic tracks have
recently enjoyed a wide circulation,
Ward has not always been interested in
laptops and digital pastiche. "We always
had a piano in the house," Ward said.
Constantly trying to one-up his older
brother, he learned to play a variety of
instruments, including the drums and
guitar.

Yet his exploration of electronic and
mash-up music was a gradual one.
Initially using only very small samples,
Ward taught himself how to mix together songs to create a unique sound.
Following in the footsteps of Girl Talk's
Greg Gillis, he now typically spends
over 40 hours to produce a single track
comprised of hard-hitting hip-hop, jangly pop and sharp guitar riffs. "It's trial

and error," Ward said of his creative

process. "It takes for-fucking-ever
am always second guessing myself."
Currently a second year student at
Hampshire College in Massachusetts,
Ward finds it understandably difficult
to balance music and academics. "I put
off all of my schoolwork as late as possible," Ward said, adding that he once
drove to Baltimore to play a show on a
Thursday night and returned to
Hampshire the next morning to take a 9
a.m. class.
Sleep deprivation aside, Ward values
his college education and plans to pursue his passions outside of the music
world; he hopes to one day make short
films.
For the time being, Ward is content
to juggle school and music, touring during vacations and on weekends. He has
even found the time to release two
mash-up albums, both of which can be

downloaded for free on his website, e-603.c0m. "It's weird that people actually
like my music," he said, musing on his
experience at Pop Montreal, an annual
Canadian music festival that has previously showcased up-and-coming bands
such as Broken Social Scene and Vivian
Girls.
Although Ward may seem a bit bashful when he speaks about his music, his
show at Olde Club this past Saturday
night proved that he has no reason to.
Flanked by a trusty bottle of Olde
English, Ward set up his laptop (sadly
sans new mouse, which ultimately
proved to be a bust) at the front of the
stage and pounded out an unrelenting
show that juxtaposed artists like Kanye
West, Nirvana and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Despite a bout of drenching October
rain, Swarthmore students came out in
droves to dance and crowd-surf tirelessly to Ward's tracks.
Although much of Ward's music follows a similar pattern, what prevented
the show from becoming another orgy of
repetitive bump-and-grind was the fact
that mash-up demands listeners to challenge their musical assumptions.
Under Ward's deft command, "Sweet
Home Alabama" and "Smells Like Teen
Spirit" became hot dance tunes.
Similarly, club favorite "Harder, Better,
Faster, Stronger" was amplified to the
maximum when blended with other
powerful hip-hop hooks. Furthermore,
each track that Ward sampled elicited a
visceral response from the audience as
they recalled memories of grooving to
Destiny's Child at a middle school dance
or weeping to The Verve. The experience of hearing such standard artists
blended together bordered on the surreal. It's like "sparking memorabilia in
your head," Ward said.
By the end of the night, Olde Club
was packed from basement to ceiling.
Ward was surrounded on all sides by
sweaty students who surged along with
the beat as it rocked the building. There
was not an inch of space not draped
with bodies (even the windows and radiators saw some action). If Ward can
carry a party to such heights even on a
rainy night, here's hoping he decides to
forego his other passions and stick with
a career in music.

The play's the thing
Playwright reflects on "Play in a Day"
BY JON PETERS
jpetersl@swarthmore.edu

Although not as well-known as the McCabe Mile,
Dash for Cash, or the Screw Your Roommate Dance,
Drama Board's "Play in a Day" festival is a gem of a
semester-ly tradition, one that is quite fun and
involves no nudity (these past years, at least). Over
the course of an evening and a day, Swarthmore playwrights, directors, and actors get together to plan out
a show, usually a collection of short plays, to be performed at the end of the 24 hours. Sound dizzying yet?
While the festival was originally attempted this
semester in September, the play was aborted due to a
which led us to last Friday and

Saturday's Play in a Day.
Dustin Trabert 'lO could be considered the mastermind of the festival. At 10 on Friday night he had
assembled a good selection of fine food, including rice
crackers, cider and brie in Parrish Parlors; as he said,
"You have thirty dollars, might as well spend it."

Shen Wei Dance Arts group dances among colorful flying confetti in their piece "Re-(partl)"

Shen Wei stretches imagination
BY EVA AMESSE
eamessel@swarthmore.edu

Shen Wei and his company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, choreographed material for the 2008 Opening Ceremony of the
Beijing Olympics, which was viewed by over four billion
people worldwide. The Swarthmore community had the
pleasure of a more intimate experience with Shen Wei
Dance Arts on Friday evening when the ensemble performed two of their well-known pieces, "Rite of Spring" and
"Re-(partl)," in the Pearson-Hall Theatre.

"I felt ['Rite of Spring'] gave unison a
whole new meaning because the
movements were so specific and
fully embodied by the performers."
Jumatatu Poe 'O4
Associate in Performance (Dance)
Shen Wei Dance Arts has performed repeatedly at the
American Dance Festival, Lincoln Center Festival, the
Venice Biennale, Los Angeles Music Center, Het
Muziektheater Amsterdam and many more premier festivals around the world. It is a thrill that Shen Wei Dance Arts
added Swarthmore to their performance schedule this season, which was made possible by the William J. Cooper
Foundation.
Wei, a choreographer, director, dancer, painter, photographer and designer, is an artist in every sense of the word.
His cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and innovative
approach to modern dance has been praised by critics worldwide. Wei utilizes visual art and elements from traditional
Chinese opera in conjunction with Western performance art
to develop an original dance vocabulary for his abstract
repertory. On Friday evening the Swarthmore community
enjoyed a mesmerizing piece called "Rite of Spring" set to
Igor Stravinsky's influential work by the same name. The
Chinese Opera walks were instantly recognizable as the
dancers treaded swiftly and lightly with very still upper bodies. When Stravinsky's dissonant and rhythmic chords
began to sound, an explosion of sharp and acrobatic movement followed. The dancers moved with such agility that
their movements often evoked the nimble, dexterous twists

THE PHOENIX

and curvatures of limber felines. Throughout the entire
piece the dancers moved in synchronization with each of
their breaths and intimated a provocative connection with
gravity, sometimes pulling each part of their bodies off the
ground one inch at a time.
After intermission, the audience was surprised to find
the stage transformed into a work of art, with symbols
traced by colorful confetti on the floor. '"Re-(partl)' was
meditation through movement and we had the pleasure of
experiencing it through the dancers," Lori Barkin 'l2 said.
The flying confetti created a beautiful effect. After the performance Wei explained that the music for this piece was a
traditional Tibetan chant and prayer that he encountered
during his travels. "Re-(partl)" was created as a "wish for
peace," Wei said, "a hope that we can all come together
*

peacefully."

Associate in Performance Jon Sherman was awed by the
dancers' sheer athleticism and ability to combine simple
and complex movements. "['Rite of Spring'] was amazingly
imaginative and incredible to watch. I can't say enough
about it," Sherman said. Associate in Performance and
alumnus Jumatatu Poe 'O4 was also impressed by the
dancers' extensive movement vocabulary. "I felt it gave unison a whole new meaning because the movements were so
specific and fully embodied by the performers," Poe said. "It
made me excited about dance. It's hard for me to get into
work that is so abstract." Kathryn Stockbower 'll rushed to
the performance after basketball practice to catch the second piece and admitted that she has never seen anything
quite like this. "I am so glad that I made it," Stockbower
said, "I really enjoyed it. The way they used confetti to
emphasize the movement was really creative, and I noticed
the interplay between the dancers."

"'Re-(partl)' was created as a wish
for peace, a hope that we can all
come together peacefully."
Shen Wei
Stockbower's observation that the dancers were always
playing off of each other is a key element in "Riteof Spring."
According to a member of the company, Jessica Harris, a lot
of the movement is improvised allowing the dancers to just
feel and react to eachother. "We have clear rules but we play
on each others' energy," Harris said.

organ. Fortunately for us, Hunter itched to do the former that night, so he joined our ranks..
Over the next few hours we laughed, we talked, we
tried the cheese, and then we settled in to try writing

a play together. We discussed a drunken Orson
Welles, Monty Python, and Beckett, finally deciding it
was best for us to part ways and write individually.
However, we still held onto our common inspiration:
Hunter's declaration that all good plays are about the
search for cheesecake.

Over the next hour and a half, the writers continued to write, I chose to sleep, and the work eventually
wrapped up for the evening. The next afternoon, I
caught up with Dustin studying the cheesecake
scripts in McCabe, and the production process
resumed. As the day wore on, scripts were refined and
edited, while I consulted both with Hunter about the
next step, and with Dustin about the location of
Hunter, neither of which was certain. Finally, at five,
Hunter, Dustin, and Nemo Swift 11, a thespian of wide
renown, met at Science Center 101 to begin rehearsal.
Hunter's play involved many declarations of "I
want some cheesecake," "No, I want some cheesecake," which echoed through the hall throughout the
evening. In my play, Nemo made a good showing as a
forty-year-old woman betrayed by her cheesecake-loving husband. Susanna's play involved a very creepy
old man (Nemo again) who beckoned a weary traveler
(Dustin) into the halls of death. Rehearsals continued
unabated for the next few hours, Dustin helped distribute signs across campus later, not deterred by the
rainstorm, and I returned to Science Center 101 at 9
p.m. to be met by some theater stalwarts in the audience readily awaiting the play.
The plays were excellent, considering the short
amount of time it took to create them
as Dustin
wrote in the Facebook invitation, "When It Only
Takes a Day, You Can't Say Its Overcooked!" Nemo
played Susanna's grim old man with panache and
humor, and when Dustin finally entered his castle,
and possibly death, the audience couldn't help but feel

chills. Hunter's work reminded me of Terry Gilliams'
Brazil mixed with Silver and Cohn's "Yes, We Have
No Bananas." A man at the Cheesecake Factory,
played by Hunter, tries to order a cheesecake and
instead is denied by each level of restaurant bureaucracy until he finally commits suicide.
Some plays like "The Seagull" and "Hamlet" last
forever, which is laudable. Others are made for the
moment in which they are created, an impromptu
event celebrating the spontaneity of life itself, and
these are something to be celebrated as well. As
Dustin said during last Saturday's rehearsal, "We
'hey,
take people out of their daily lives and say
wanna put on a show?' And it's usually funny."
Life can be enjoyed simply through its randomness, like cheesecake and mixed-up French waiters
and creepy old men; as Shakespeare said, the play is
the thing.

By the time American rock
band Guns 'N Roses had released
all the tracks that set them up for
global acclaim, most current
Swatties had yet set to foot in an
elementary school classroom. After
17 long years, however, it appears
that the group's enigmatic frontman Axl Rose is finally releasing
his pet project, the album Chinese
Democracy.

With a US release date set for

time. Chinese Democracy has been
flailing about in the music industry for about a decade now, with
numerous leaked singles, retracted
release dates and dissatisfied guitarists quitting. But this finally appears to
be the year that Axl Rose makes good on the album he promised in 1999.1 can
already hear the disappointment of fans and much fuss made about nothing
in terms of the political nature of the record; to those voices, I would say just
try to appreciate the music.
In its prime, Guns 'N Roses enjoyed nearly as much popularity worldwide
as back on home soil. Record sales of 90 million globally, with 39 million coming from America, support this notion. Instantly recognizable tracks like
"Welcome to the Jungle," "Sweet Child o' Mine," and "November Rain" solidified the critical and commercial success of Rose's high-pitched vocals and
guitarist Slash's efficiently bluesy licks. Unfortunately, Chinese Democracy
isn't primed to achieve the same heights as previous incarnations of the
group. It has simply been too long of a wait, and anything Rose and his new
bandmates have created cannot possibly meet the enormous expectations
that any album dubbed "the most expensive never made" by the New York
Times would understandably arouse.
More importantly, however, is the disillusionment many feel towards
Rose himself. Googling "Axl Rose douche" returns over 10,000 results to
peruse, and for good reason: the racism and homophobia that have been
attributed to the volatile lead singer have been less damaging than the general disrespect that Rose has shown fans at concerts in the past. Arriving
late for and leaving early from a set are some of the tamer transgressions
Rose has committed against the millions who once supported his music.
But it's the recent upswing in popularity for ousted guitarist Slash
that may ultiprominently featured on the video game Guitar Hero 111
mately prove to be the most costly for Rose. The ugly breakup of the band in
the mid '9os stemmed from increased tensions between the lead singer and
the guitarist, and self-proclaimed critics are already lambasting Chinese
Democracy as an Axl Rose project, not a Guns 'N Roses production.
While the released title single and leaked tracks over the years do indicate that this is pretty much entirely Rose's music (to put it one way, there
is more "November Rain" than "Sweet Child o' Mine" to be found), I think
the fact that the album is coming out at all is cause for celebration. The primary reason is that free Dr. Pepper will be given out to every American,
with the exception of the guitarists Slash and Buckethead because of their
well-publicized feuds with Rose. This is Dr. Pepper making good on its promise to give a free can to the nation's 300 million if the album is released in
2008.

Free soda aside, it is refreshing (pun shamelessly intended) to herald the
return of a group who was willing to push genre boundaries, even if it is
comprised of different members this time around. For all the flak Axl Rose
catches, the fact is that he is still a pretty good musician, and if the reports
are true Chinese Democracy will cover everything from industrial rock to
blues. In a world oversaturated with the likes of the Jonas Brothers and Fall
Out Boy, Guns 'N Roses could come out with an average album
which in
all likelihood they will
and still be regarded as a savior in some capacity.
An important factor to consider in all of this buildup, however, is the thematic nature of the album itself. If precedents are to be trusted, the People's
Republic of China will block the album from release and the pirated CD will
still be sold for 10 kuai ($1.43) on the streets. The larger issue, I think, is
whether or not listeners should take Rose's apparent political views seriously. In the case of Axl Rose, it is better to take in the music than to quibble over his political stance. It has been well-established that in many ways
Rose is an affront to humanity, and "Chinese Democracy" has become more
the symbol of his reputation's deterioration and years of delay that the
Communist Party would never condone in the construction of something,
rather than any meaningfully charged statement. This album, doomed never
to turn a profit, should only be regarded in terms of musicality.
With Axl Rose, that musicality has a high propensity to rub fans the

Nathalie Stone 'O9 pushes forward in a tough game against Gettysburg. The team will play its final game
against Franklin and Marshall on Saturday.

BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore field hockey team dropped a
hard-fought game against a formidable Gettysburg
squad 4-0 at home Saturday. Despite the rainy weather and their opponent's menacing ranking of sixteenth in the nation, the Garnet came off Clothier
Field in high spirits.
Co-captain Sarah Reynolds 'O9 called it "one of the

best games of our season." Drawing on the experience of battling #4 Johns Hopkins in September,
Reynolds felt that "[Gettysburg] looked better than
Hopkins," and was pleased with her teammates' ability to keep up with such a competitive opponent
despite having only one substitute to work with on
the field, which has proven to be a nagging disadvantage.
Reaffirming her sentiments, Reynolds proudly
recognized that "we played like a team." Admitting
that the team's recent "scores and record don't do justice" to the level of play they have exhibited on the
field, she said that the Garnet squad is due for a victory.
Indeed, Swarthmore, who fell to 5-11 (1-7 in
Centennial Conference play) after the loss, looks to
snap a three-game losing streak in the final two
games of the 2008 season this week. Gettysburg (11-5,
6-2 CC) extended their winning streak to three with

the win.
Bolstered by a strong defense, Gina Grubb 'lO tallied six saves in goal against Gettysburg, while Katie
Ashmore 'll notched four in the final minutes of the
second period. Reynolds, who was credited with two
defensive saves against the Bullets, is one of five seniors whose impending departure weighs heavily on
the team. The program looks to first-year head coach
Lauren Fuchs to help facilitate the recruitment of a
top-notch freshman class next year to propel the
team to a winning season.
In the meantime, Fuchs has been pleased with the
women's effort on the field, but is eager to make
improvements. She noted that the ladies did "some

22

nice things offensively [against Gettysburg]" and
that the squad has been "working with different ways
to draw our corners" in order to make a big impact in
upcoming conference matches, which could serve as
necessary inspiration as the team looks forward to
coming back with a vengeance in 2009.
While a playoff berth is not within reach for the
Garnet, there is plenty of motivation as they are still
in a position to affect the dynamics of the conference
tournament. Reynolds pointed out that with a win
against Franklin and Marshall on Saturday, they
could prevent the Diplomats from reaching the playoffs. This may be small consolation to the team's
aspirations, but such an exclamation point may
remind the conference that Swarthmore is not to be
discounted.
"This hasbeen the definition of a transition year,"
Reynolds said, a bit disappointed that she will not be
around next year to play with the talented new-first
years who are expeced to join the squad. "Lauren

[Fuchs] brings such a good morale. The girls are

excited about playing, and recruits see that [when

they visit]." With more players, Swarthmore will be
able to acquire the roster flexibility enjoyed by many
of their opponents and substitute players throughout
the game, reducing fatigue, and thereby improving

overall play.
With only two games left, the seniors on the roster
are preparing for their long journeys as collegiate
athletes to come to an end. Reynolds remembers beating Franklin and Marshall in the final game of last

forward to ending the season on a winning streak
and hopes to "come out with two wins. I think we can
surprise both of them," Reynolds said.
Natalie Stone 'O9 concurs, noting that it will be
bittersweet to play her final game on Clothier Field.
"It's been great. I will be sad to see it end," she said
of the final weeks of her collegiate athletic career.

Conference.
In a match cut short due to lightening, the 25th-ranked Garnet
took full advantage of the weather throughout the game. "The
key to the game," team captain JeffKushner 'O9 said, "was taking
into account the rain and puddles throughout the field." The
Garnet focused on having as many shots as possible and pressing
the opponent's defense. Defensively, the players successfully
restrained the Terror while the offense placed balls to the corners
and limited the number of back passes. As a result, the Garnet
dominated the Green Terror and controlled the flow for the
entire game. McDaniel was kept busy kicking the ball out of thenfield for the majority of the match.
Four differentSwarthmore players scored a goal each, leading
the Garnet to a 4-0 victory over McDaniel. The first score of the
night came at 28:44 when Garnet captain Dylan Langley 10 broke
away from the Green Terror defense and sent a long cross to forward Evan Nesterak 'O9. Nesterak slid into the ball and sent it
into the right corner of the net for his sixth goal of the season.
David Sterngold 'l2 doubled the advantage four minutes later.
The Garnet sent a through pass to the box that was one-touched
into a shot. The GreenTerror goalie cleared the shot, only to be
re-collected by Sterngold who shot the ball in the middle of the
net to tally the second goal for the Garnet.
Swarthmore's domination over McDaniel became ever more
apparent in the second half. Garnet's third goal was the result of
a penalty kick drawn by forward Ladule Lako Lo Sarah 'O9. In the
64th minute, Lako Lo Sarah dribbled into the penalty box but was
taken down by the McDaniel defense in the box. Ladule was
injured and was substituted, but captain Rory Stackpole 'O9 took
the penalty shot and collected his first collegiate goal.
Midfielder Stu Leon 'O9 scored the last goal of the game. At
65:43, Leon redirected a missed clear by the Green Terror, and the
ball found the back of the net. Leon posted his first goal of the
season and thirteenth goal in his Garnet career. "Stu Leon
dropped the hammer and got his first goal of the season,"
Kushner said.
Swarthmore's unstoppable domination of the field continued
until the game was called with eleven minutes left on the clock
due to lightning and severe weather. The contest had reached the
■reasonable point ofconclusion' of seventy minutes, as per NCAA
guidelines, and the result was therefore declared final.
Various statistics clearly indicate Swarthmore's domination
over the Green Terror. The Garnet outshot the Green Terror by a
22-6 margin, with 11 shots in the first and second half each and 11
shots on goal in total. The Garnet had four corner kicks to the
visitors' zero. The McDaniel goalies, Michael Radcliffe and
Benjamin Knight, made three saves in the first half and four
saves in the second half, respectively. The Green Terror failed to
produce any significant threat, making only one shot, comfortably saved by the Garnet Goalie David D'Annunzio 'l2.
D'Annunzio registered one save, collecting his fourth shut out of

the season.
Head Coach Eric Wagner expressed deep satisfaction with the
team. He did not hide his excitement with the team's performance this season. Wagner commented that the 2008-2009 men's
soccer team shows depth incomparable to previous teams he
coached at Swarthmore. Additionally, the fitness level of the
team leaves almost no room for improvement, and confidence
level is high after consecutive wins in the Conference. (The
Garnet won six consecutive games in September and October.)
He was especially impressed with Senior Jeff Kushner's performance on Saturday. "He did [an] awesome job controlling the
game."

This huge win against McDaniel put the Garnet in first place
in the conference over conference rival Johns Hopkins (5-0-2 CC)
with two matches left in the regular season. The Garnet now

have 18 points in Centennial action this season, and clinched
their fourth Conference playoff appearance in the last five seasons. The six wins tie the program record for Conference victories and extend their current overall win streak to seven games
in a row the last time the Garnet won seven games in a row was
in 2005. McDaniel falls to 4-9-1 overall, 1-5-1 in the Centennial
Conference, while Johns Hopkins runs 11-2-3 in overall and 5-0-2
in the Centennial.
The next matchfor the Garnet will be in Allentown, PA where
they will take on Muhlenberg on Wednesday, October 29 for a
Centennial Conference contest. "We have a real tough test
-

against Muhlenberg on Wednesday evening at their place. It's a
huge match because it could determine if we remain in first by
season's end. We are expecting a tough battle but if we play our
game, we should be fine," Kushner said.

Five ingredients for a Sharks success story
Because of
the length of
the season,
hockey commentators
argue

about
early
how
one can tell if
a team will
have a good
season or if
they will be

contenders
for
the
Stanley Cup.

Still, with the
HANNAH PURKEY
way
the
Sharks have
Purkey Perspective
started the
season,
I
don't think
anyone could
argue that they are not a team to watch. With 7-2-0 so far,
this has been one of the best starts for the team since its creation during the 1991 season.
Considering the changes that took place in the short time
since last season, this is no small feat. The team this season
has a new coach with an entirely new vision for the team's
style of play
a defensive line anchored by several new
players
and the loss of some key figures from last year's
team. And all of this after coming off a disappointing end to
last season's playoffs. Watching the team play, however, you
wouldn'tknow it. There are five things in the team's first ten
games that have helped, or hindered, their success so far.
L Composure.

It's a simple concept to understand but not an easy one
to show with thousands of screaming fans and an opposing

team of some of the best players in the game just waiting to
slam you against the boards. And yet, both the returning
and new faces of the Sharks have shown amazing composure so far. The team hasn't been thrown off when the game
isn't going their way; they just keep playing, throwing
pucks to the net and putting pressure on opposing teams'
defenses. In their game on Friday against the Florida
Panthers, after Ryane Clowe had a power play goal disallowed, what did he do? That's right; he scored again, legally
this time, in the same power play. Having a goal taken
away or getting scored on can be a huge mental block for
athletes. The Sharks have done an amazing job this season
in overcoming that block, and this has already paid off in
more than one stolen, last-minute victory.
2. The power play.
Special teams can make or break a season, but so far the
Sharks have been strong on their power play and penalty
kills. Players like Devon Setoguchi have been aggressive in
driving to the net and getting penalties called, giving the
Sharks the opportunity to go up in numbers. The best part
of the Sharks' power play this season is its unpredictability. Last season, the team had a tendency to get complacent
with the man advantage and became static on the ice. This
year, players have been covering enormous space, and
defenders, like Dan Boyle, have really been making an
effort to get into the attack, essentially giving the Sharks
another forward. While this aggressiveness is good, defense
on a power play is still important. Short-handed goals
should be rare, so letting Danny Brier of the Philadelphia
Flyers score two short-handed goals in back-to-back games
shows that there is always room for improvement, even on
a good power play.
3. Turnovers.
Just don't do them. Against the Flyers last week, there
were three turnovers in the first 15 minutes, two of which
lead to goals. It was an extremely high-scoring game, but
turnovers just show a blatant disregard for puck possession

and sloppy play. What was especially shocking is that the
player who was most guilty of this in the Philadelphia
series was none other than Captain Patrick Marleau.
4. Big players making big plays.
Joe Thorton is currently under a three year $216 million
contract. Other team leaders are under similar contracts,
and for that kind of money, fans and coaches demand
results. It will be key this season for the big players on this
team to play like big players. So far, this has not been a
problem. Jonathan Cheechoo, who has previously been
criticized for his slow starts to the season, is already
impacting the team through not only his scoring but also
his tough style of play. Marleau has had problems contributing to the team's offense in past seasons, but this year
has gotten onto the scoreboard early and stayed there.
Otherkey players to lookfor this season include, as always,
goal tender Evgeni Nabokov as well as Devon Setoguchi,
who, although only in his second year with the Sharks, is
already playing like a veteran.
5. Team chemistry.
In professional sports, it can be hard to maintain steady
team chemistry with players of such varied ages and experiences, and with such long
and sometimes negative
histories of playing against one another on different teams.
However, the Sharks have had no problem learning how to
adapt to the changes Coach McLellan has thrown at them.
They have stepped up as a team. It's great to see that when
players on teams like the Anaheim Ducks try to push
around some of the younger Sharks players, veterans like
Jody Shelley, the team's leading fighter, immediately step
in to defend them. In fact, in the second game against the
Ducks this year, even Joe Thorton, who usually spends
more time on the ice than in the penalty box, stepped up to
stick up for his teammates, showing that truly anything is
possible this season.

Volleyball season ends with records broken and fanfare for seniors
BY DENNIS FAN

dfanl@swarthmore.edu

The end of the Swarthmore women's
volleyball team's (6-17, CC 2-6) season
draws ever closer as the Garnet completed two of their last four matches this past
week. The first match, against Ursinus
College, was a three set rout as
Swarthmore won resoundingly, 25-10, 2520, 25-20. Later that week, our Garnet
fought hard against Gettysburg on an
exciting Senior Day, but eventually lost
the match, 25-22, 25-22, 25-9.
During the Ursinus match, the Garnet
women were able to dictate the pace of the
game by serving hard, digging often, and
communicating well. Jen Wang 'O9 finished the game by smashing her own
school season-kill record, contributing 17
kills to reach 321 kills for the season and
adding a team-high of 21 digs. Other
notable exploits included the performances of Genny Pezzola 'l2, who posted an
impressive 12 kills and 11 digs, and
Hillary Santana 'l2 with 15 digs.
It was hard to miss the advertisements
for the Senior Day match against
Gettysburg. The women used the irresistible allure of brownies and free tshirts, hung a bed sheet in Sharpies,
chalked the sidewalks, made the indispensable Facebook event and even made
posters with the two seniors' (Wang and
Erin Heaney) heads Photoshopped onto
the bodies of Misty May-Treanor and
Kerri Walsh.
The result was a record attendance of
214 students, family, and staff in the audience, far surpassing the old record of
roughly 125 audience members. The
Garnet would keep Gettysburg on their
toes through the first two sets, losing by
only three points in each. Coach Harleigh
Chwastyk comments that often, because
of Swarthmore's weaker record this sea-

THE PHOENIX

son, "Teams don't know how good we
are." Heaney added that the Gettysburg

team, which was tied for first in the conference at the time, decided to keep in all
of their starters once they realized how
close the match was. Heaney also contributed 18 digs to increase her career dig
total to 1,548, cementing her own school
record and catapulting her to 14th in
Conference history for career digs.
Senior Day gave senior captains Wang
and Heaney time to reflect on their
careers at Swarthmore as well as the season so far. Wang commented that for herselfand Heaney, "[Senior Day] was really
a trip down memory lane." Wang and
Heaney have been playing together since
freshman year and between them, many
school records have fallen.
Heaney added that volleyball here at
Swarthmore had really helped her "learn
how to be a member of the community."
The volleyball community might be
described by her as a process of "working
each other harder, but also keeping each
other up."

Heaney was also proud of the team's
performance this season. "We were very
young and small (in height and numbers)
and went in with the cards stacked
against us," she said, but nonetheless, "we
laid the foundations for next year."
Though on the surface this season had not
been exceptionally triumphant, as both
Ursinus and Gettysburg learned, the team
was capable of competing at a high level.
Chwastyk concurred and added that
the team improved greatly over the past

few months. Parents who had watched
their first games came back for Senior
Day and expressed disbelief at the team's
quality of play.
Even without a middle blocker for the
season, and with a small team, the Garnet
can be considered the best team, defensively, in the conference, with a

been the most dedicated that she has

can be credited with making the team successful. It is still difficult, however, to
imagine
the face of Swarthmore
Volleyball without its two seniors.

Battle with Bullets ends in draw for soccer
Gettysburg found the net in the second half, however,
and tied the game at 1-1 in the 60th minute. The goal

BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore Women's Soccer battled with Gettysburg
in the rain this past Saturday at Clothier Field. The
Bullets (5-6-5, 4-4-1 CC) scored in the second half to force
the game into overtime, which remained scoreless
through both extra periods. The match ended in a 1-1
draw, giving the Garnet a point in the conference standings and sending its record to 9-3-2 (5-1-2 CC).
As of midday Wednesday that record translated into
sole possession of third place with 17 points. Previously
the Garnet had been in second place, but when
Swarthmore's match versus Haverford on Tuesday was
postponed a day due to rain, Dickinson passed
Swarthmore and clinched a tournament berth with a win
over Gettysburg. John Hopkins University is first in the
Centennial Conference with an undefeated record of 9-0
in conference play, with 27 points. The top five teams
from the conference make it into the tournament.
The Garnet could have effectively clinched one of
these five playoff spots on Saturday, and that made the
draw even more difficult to swallow. The team looked
good early, with its goal coming in the 28th minute.
Gettysburg defenders attempted to clear the ball out of
their half but Swarthmore defender Eileen Earl 'lO sent
the ball right back into the middle of the box. There forward Kelsey Cline 'll redirected the ball into the right
corner of the net. Despite trailing the Bullets in shots 6-4
during the first frame, the Garnet managed to keep the 10 advantage into halftime.

came off a corner kick by Bullets defender Lauren
Johnson. After a previous corner that Swarthmore keeper and captain Lauren Walker 'O9 was able to knock out
of bounds, Gettysburg lined up again, and Johnson's boot
found her teammate Jordann Smak, who headed in the
tying goal.

Swarthmore had opportunities to win the match
towards the end of regulation, kicking the last three
shots of the second half. On the final attempt, in the 84th
minute, the shot struck the crossbar but the ball could
not find a way in, sending the game to sudden-death overtime.

Neither team managed a shot on goal in the first period of extra time, but Swarthmore saw two opportunities
go by in the second period. Monica Cody 'lO remarked on
the goal-scoring chances. "I thought they were going in
actually. They both were really close," she said. Neither
shot connected with the back of the net, however, and
after 110 minutes of play the teams remained deadlocked

atl-L

The shot tally was also close, with Swarthmore getting the slight edge 14-13. A tie is a familiar feeling for the
Bullets; they have had five over the course of the season,
the most of any team in the Centennial Conference. It
was harder for the Garnet, however, because they came
in as the favored team, ranked eighth in the Mid-Atlantic
Region. Head Coach Todd Anckaitis acknowledged the
sour taste of the draw. "Honestly, the team was disappointed with the result," he said.

But Anckaitis also noted that the team should not be
too disappointed because they've gone through a lot.
"We've battled a lot of adversity in the last few weeks and
I'm proud of how we've weathered some tough competition. From the tough travel schedule...to the winds and
poor quality field at the Ursinus game and the wind and
rain conditions against Gettysburg not to mention the
revolving door of injuries our squad has had in the last
two weeks we've performed well in some harsh conditions." Player Taylor Rhodes 'lO was also optimistic.
"We're moving on and we're putting it in the past and
we're preparing for our next game," she said.
Keeper Lauren Walker was an important player for
the Garnet, coming up with four saves in the match. As

a result of her efforts Walker was named the Centennial
Conference Defensive Player of the Week for earning ten
saves in the last two matches: this tie and a 1-0 shutout of
Ursinus last Wednesday, while only allowing one goal.
Anckaitis referred to his goalie as "a rock" and praised
her and the rest of the defense saying, "She deserves that
award and so does our defense. An average game for her
is an outstanding game for any other keeper in our conference." He added that, we're really going to miss her
and the other three seniors next year, Cait Mullarkey,
Melinda Petre, and Alexa Bensimhon." The Garnet's
final match of the regular season is away at Franklin &
Marshall on Saturday, Nov. 1 at 11 o'clock.

Camaraderie galvanizes rugby teams in final matches
BY ALYSSA BOWIE

abowiel@swarthmore.edu

As the fall sports season draws to a close
and conference championships rapidly
approach, club teams, such as men's and
women's rugby, find themselves with just a
few matches remaining. For the rugby
players, participants in a sport noted for its
rough play and heightened sense of community, the end of the season brings about
a chance to play their last few games and
look forward to the spring season.
For members of the men's team, playing
rugby on the club level is largely a new
experience. First year students usually
take up the sport with little to no prior
experience, though many were formerly
football or soccer players. Although such
ability level coincides well with the relatively low commitment level required, it
does not mean that the squad is not tested.
The team travels within the area to face
other squads such as Lehigh, The College
of New Jersey, Haverford, and most recent-

ly, Lafayette.
The Lafayette game, according to Ken
Flanagan 'l2, was the perfect embodiment
of the spirit of rugby, both in the environment in which it was played and the way in
which it marked the team's progression
from the beginning of the season. "We
played really well," he noted, "the entire
team did really well on the whole. It was
super fun because it was pouring rain and
muddy, but not too cold...and the [opposing] team was a very nice team, they didn't
play dirty." "You can tell that we're getting
better," added Julian Leland 'l2, 'and that
everyone's working more like a team now.

most to team members when asked about
the highlights of the season. Against

Haverford, Leland noted, there was great
unity between the middle backs and the
quick wings, who were able to travel down
the field in their V-formation towards the
trizone, where points are scored. This is
especially promising in light of this being a
"growing year," due to the loss, to graduation, of several speedy seniors. For the
men, the hope is that this promise will
carry through into the spring season,
which begins in January.
Similarly, the women's team has many
reasons to be optimistic. Beginning the season with very low numbers, due to the loss

At the very least we understand the mis-

takes that we're making." Although they
fell to Lafayette 12-13, they were happy with
the close score and were excited by specific
individual plays that stood out, such as
successful combinations of passes and runs
coming out of the back. These beautiful
passing progressions are what stand out

of 10 graduating seniors and 10 juniors to
study abroad, the team finished 1-2 in divisional play. The win, against Muhlenburg,
was a result of the hard work put in by the
team throughout the entire semester,
including significant contributions by "a
really dedicated and wonderful group of
rookies who have worked tremendously
hard at learning the game and improving
their level of play," according to captain
Marina Isakowitz 'O9.
Similar to the men, Isakowitz noted the
unity she felt between members of the
backline and the forwards, "which has
helped raise the team's understanding of
the entirety of the game." All of this makes

ou,

the potential for more wins in the spring
season even greater.
More importantly, however, for both
teams, is the sense of community emphasized within the rugby culture. For the
men, this means socials after Saturday
games, an event that helps the team
unwind after the rigor of that day's match.
Combining the inherent social nature of
rugby with its presence as a club sport at
Swarthmore makes for an atmosphere in
which the players desire to do well for
themselves and their teammates, but do so
in a relatively low-pressure environment.
"We just like to play together," explained
Flanagan. "It's about unity."
