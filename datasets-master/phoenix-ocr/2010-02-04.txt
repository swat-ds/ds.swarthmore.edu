Sams would say, 'This [the BCC] is your
house,' Giles said. "It's where we get support and love."
While it may be harder for first-years to
deal with the transition, Giles said that she
would have liked to see Sams "graduate"
with the seniors, with whom he had developed a relationship over the period of four
years. "I wouldn't be the same student if it
weren't for him and the BCC," she said.
As an admissions fellow, Giles claimed
that many black students are attracted to
Swarthmore primarily because of the BCC.
"We got a lot of students [to apply] thanks
to the BCC," she said.
Paul Cato 'l3, a programming intern at
the BCC, said that it was "a blow" and "a
shock" when he heard that Sams was leaving. Sams has been a particularly important person for Cato, who is epileptic and
was sick throughout last semester. Cato
described Sams in an e-mail as his "biggest
advocate."
"Quite literally I would not be back this
semester were it not for him. He was amazing," Cato said. "He has been the most
important person in my life at Swarthmore
thus far, and will probably be one of the
most important people in my entire life."
Sams acknowledged that the students
could have and even "should have," as
Sams put it, been shocked about him leaving the position. While he admitted that it
was tough and painful having to leave his
students, Sams added that he has to stay
distant. "[The students'] primary source of
support is each other," he said.
Sams deemed developing and encouraging student leadership as one of his most
important roles at Swarthmore and said
"

Though Director of the Black Cultural
Center Tim Sams has already left for
another position at NYU Abu Dhabi, the
college is waiting to hire a new dean of stu-

dents before replacing Sams' position.
After some students expressed concern

about the future of the BCC, however,
Acting Dean of Students Garikai Campbell

'9O sent an e-mail last week to several stu-

dents involved with the BCC to address
their uncertainties. "The college will
indeed have a new director of the BCC," he
said in the e-mail.
Until a new dean of students is hired,
Darryl Smaw, associate dean of multicultural affairs, will spend half of his time at
the BCC acting as the interim director.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal will take over Sams' role as the
dean for the class of 2010.
Sams, who was at the BCC for nearly 13
years, announced his decision to leave the

college in December after a trip to Abu

Dhabi over Thanksgiving break, where he
received a job offer to be Associate Dean of
Students.
Still, however, some students associated with the BCC have concerns about the

transition.
"Half-time is not enough," Charmaine
Giles 'lO said, referring to half of Smaw's

time being committed to the BCC. Giles
has been involved with the BCC since her
freshman year.
"I wish they would fill the position
faster," said Romane Paul 'lO, another student involved with the BCC.
Giles said that she thinks Sams' departure will be particularly hard for firstyears who have been receiving guidance
and support from Sams and who are still
getting acclimated to the college. "It's like
pulling a rug from underneath a baby who
is just learning how to walk," she said.

Though it is also a resource for the
wider campus through coordinating programs such as the Blueprint education program, the BCC provides for many black
students a sense of home and a safe place
with family-like support. As Sams said,
"We function well, because we function as
a family."
"At the beginning of every speech Dean

that he was confident about the abilities of
the current student leaders.

"I may leave, but students still have
people to push and support them," he said,
listing black faculty, members of the

administration and members of the Dean's
Office.
"My role is to be a resource person,
facilitator, to answer questions, plan programs, be an academic advisor," Smaw
said of his interim position.
Hiring a new person to replace Dean
Sams might not be the only change in the
BCC.

"The nature of the campus and the
black community have changed," said

Februarys 2010

Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and community relations. "The community is different than it was 10 years
ago. It is larger, it is not as monolithic,
more diverse," he said, referring to students of different ancestries.
Eldridge said that the best way to be
supportive of the BCC and black students

is to react to the changes in the structure,

character and size of the community.
"The process, these conversations
about changes will be as inclusive as possible," he said, meaning that students
would be involved in the replacement dis-

cussion.

The BCC was created in 1970, stemming
out of student protests at the end of the
19605. "The BCC came out not of consensus,
mainstream concern. It came out of black
students' protests," Sams said.
Sams underlined how important the

BCC is for. the campus as a whole.

"Swarthmore still acts as a predomiwhite institution," he said. "I lost
sight of that because I love this place so
much," he said. He said he hoped his successor would take care of organizing more

nantly

outreach to the wider campus.

Eldridge said that the BCC provides an
opportunity for the whole campus to learn
how to live in a diverse society.

Imaani Greene from the BCC conducted
a year-long study on social life ofblack students last year. According to notes from
the focus groups that were organized for
the purpose of the study, "they [black students] are torn between white friendships
and their desire to be a part of the black
community. The two groups seem mutual-

ly exclusive."
"I was shocked," Sams said. "Students
shouldn't have to choose."

Sams said that he views Abu Dhabi as a
professional promotion but also as an
opportunity for activism. "We [at NYU]
want to explore social justice, using education as a tool," he said. "And I've always
been an activist," he said pointing to a photograph of him on the wall of his office
taken many years ago at a rally.
When asked about what would he miss
about Swarthmore, he said he would miss
everything. "I love the place, the people,
intellectual talent, commitment to social
justice, resources. I will miss my colleagues," he said.

Class on Haiti extends
earthquake relief effort

WEEK IN PICTURES

The Society of Ancient Instruments performs as part of the Midday Monday Concert
Series, a program sponsored by the Department of Music and Dance.

John Williams, a resident artist at the Clay Studio in Philadelphia teaches students
how to sculpt, mold and play in a lecture and workshop on Saturday.

In response to the recent earthquake
in Haiti, groups such as Coalition for
Free Haiti have been working to raise
money for and awareness about the
recent disaster. Furthermore, events
such as film showings and a new course
on Haiti hope to educate the campus
about Haiti beyond the earthquake.
About eight Swarthmore students are
choosing to take a course called "Haiti,
French Antilles and Guyane in
Translation" to learn more about Haiti.
This seminar course on translated
Caribbean literature has been offered
before. This year it was offered to students after the semester began, in part
due to growing interest in Haiti after the
recent earthquake. Assistant Professor
of French and Francophone Studies
Micheline Rice-Maximin, a native of
Guadalupe who is teaching the course,
plans to modify the content of the course
to put a focus on Haitian literature.
"I think everyone just really needs to
know their history and how strong of a
nation it used to be so maybe you can
help them rebuild it while still respecting
their culture," said Ta'ryn Colonnese 'l3,
a student in the course. "Whenever you
go help a country, you don't want to just
go with your ideals and implement them
on that country. You have to know what
their values and ideals [are]."
The course grew out of an independent study course on Haitian literature.
Jacqueline Bailey-Ross 'l2, who is
Haitian herself, has been taking French
Creole as an independent study from
Rice-Maximin for the past two semesters.
This year, while forming Bailey-Ross'
program for her independent study on
Haitian literature, Bailey-"Ross and RiceMaximin realized that there is greater
interest in this topic and chose to make it
a course instead.
"It's a monumental time for me and
for Micheline. There are many other
schools that are forming courses out of
this, which is remarkable," Bailey-Ross
said. "[Haiti] was isolated for so long, to
the point where not many people, very
few people know its history although its
history is very intertwined with other
countries and is very important."
Bailey-Ross is also the co-founder of
Coalition for Free Haiti, which has been

spearheading many projects for Haiti

relief efforts.
The January 12 earthquake in Haiti is
estimated by the Red Cross to have affected 3 million Haitians, according to CBS
News. Bailey-Ross, estimates that there
are 10-12 Swarthmore students with
Haitian heritage.
According to Bailey-Ross, Coalition
for Free Haiti has raised over $6OO so far
in a raffle for Haiti relief efforts.
According to Student Council President
Rachel Bell 'lO, Student Council also
raised about $3OO at Pub Night last week.
It has not yet been decided which organization this money will be donated to.
Coalition for Free Haiti also has plans
for more relief events as well as for general promotion of and education about
Haitian culture and history. In addition
to several events about Haiti during
Black History Month, Coalition for Free
Haiti will also host a Haiti Week in April.
To raise money for relief efforts, the

group plans for a benefit concert at the
Lang Center as well as a Tri-Co ball.
Swarthmore College and the borough of

Swarthmore will also co-host a 5K race

Other groups on campus are also
choosing to help in their own way. The
international students' group i2O and
Students of CaribbeanAncestry are planning an open dinner for Haiti. The Dance
Department is also honoring Haiti in its
Faculty and Friends Dance Concert on
Feb 6. The performance is free, but there
will be a collection of donations.
"Our dance program is focused on
global discourse. That means the program that we make is directed toward
helping students to understand other cultures," said Sharon Friedler, director of
the dance program. "Given that we have
this faculty performance, and then the
tragedy occurred, it seemed ... appropriate to bring together with what we have
to offer, which is dancing, with a need,
which is fundraising."
Despite the number of groups and
events held for Haiti, both Bailey-Ross
and Bell said that a major problem was
the lack of collaboration between the various student groups and among student
groups, the faculty and the administration.
"I think student efforts could be better
coordinated, but [l] think we more so
need to connect with faculty/staff who
also have an interest," Bell said in an
email.
Bailey-Ross also stated that in addition to working collaboratively with the
entire campus, she would like to see
more long-term projects for Haiti rather
than simply raising money for relief.
"We're taking a lot longer than most
campuses. There is still a lot of planning
to do in terms of the college's response. I
just hope that we continue to collectively
work together to raise awareness and
fundraising," Bailey-Ross said. "What I
really hope is that there'll be more of
working together and a more longtermed joint effort."
Vice President for College and
Community Relations and Executive
Assistant to the President Maurice
Eldridge '6l agrees with Bailey-Ross. He
said that due to the number of organizations on campus and the number of people in the community, it has been difficult to organize everyone. However, he
has been in talks with Bailey-Ross and
the Lang Center in attempting to create a
more organized method for Haitian relief
efforts on Campus.
Bailey-Ross said that Coalition for
Free Haiti is currently working to bring
a Haitian author as a Cooper Foundation
speaker next year. She hopes that the college will plan for long-term interests in
Haiti, eventually with a Lang project that
will send students to Haiti.
The course on Haitian literature will
also be one way for students to retain
their interest in Haiti. Bailey-Ross said
that she hopes the class will become an
entry point for students into Haitian culture and that those students will continue to spread interest about Haiti.
"I hope it'll set a precedent in regards
to classes [on] Haiti," Bailey-Ross said. "I
hope there'll be more classes on Haiti
and the Caribbean. I hope students will
get a deeper understand of Haiti and pass
on that interest to other students."

Committee chooses to forgo spring Large Scale Event
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ALLISON GANTT
aganttl@swarthmore.edu
Due to a 40 percent cut to its budget,
the Large Scale Event Committee will not
be hosting a spring semester concert,
making Worthstock in May the next
event organized, though not fully funded,
by the committee.
While there was also was no spring
LSE performance two years ago, this is
the first year that the LSE budget has
been significantly cut since former
President Al Bloom increased it to
$lOO,OOO in 2005.
The Dean's Office collectively decided
last summer to reduce LSE funding by
$40,000 to help meet a budget cut quota set
by the President's Office.
"We decided that we could part with
that money," said Myrt Westphal, associate dean for student life. "I think that students understand the reality of financial
...

times."

She added that not everyone on the
campus comes to the LSE concerts.
Typically, the LSE Committee puts
roughly half of its budget toward one
event in the fall and the other half toward
an event in the spring. With the 40 percent reduction in its budget, however, the

committee decided that it would be best
to have only one concert in the fall.
"The decision was made to consolidate
[the] two events in the year
into one
event in the fall so that we could have a
bigger-name artist with our limited
funds," Henry Linder, a member of the
LSE Committee, said.
The committee brought Girl Talk, a
popular mash-up artist, as the fall semester's LSE in November.
Assistant Coordinator of Student
Activities Paury Flowers, who oversees
the LSE Committee, echoed Linder.
"It occurred to a lot of us that there is
a lot of over-programming that goes on in
the spring," Flowers said. "We think [the
LSE] is a great way to ring in the fall
semester, so we wanted to keep that
intact."
According to Re id Wilkening 'lO, last
year's LSE coordinator, approximately
500 people typically attend theLSE event
each semester. Flowers said that between
600 and 700 people went to see Girl Talk.
The LSE Committee's allotted budget
fully funds the fall semester and spring
semester events, which are typicaUy concerts. The budget cuts, then, aren't
expected to affect funding for Worthstock
because most of it comes from the
Student Budget Committee. Worthstock
is an all-day event at the" end of the spring
semester that brings together a variety of
bands on the courtyard outside of Worth
Hall.
SBC Manager Simon Zhu 'll said that
the SBC "definitely" has available money
for Worthstock. The SBC typically provides between $15,000 and $20,000 for the
event, Zhu said. The LSE Committee has
to write up a proposal to submit to the
SBC to apply for funding of the
Worthstock concert, which is the team's
next task.
"We have a great relationship with
give us
SBC, so we think that they'll
enough money to really do a great event,
and they know how much the students
are looking forward to it, but it's always
sort of undetermined until we get the proposal put forward," Flowers said.
Zhu said that once the Worthstock proposal is submitted, it will be evaluated
and voted upon by the SBC. After a negotiation, revision and approval process,

the SBC manages the finances.
In addition to the new challenge of
budget cuts, the LSE Committee also
lacks a coordinator and has three vacancies. The previous coordinator, Sarah
Kroll 'll, left Swarthmore just before Girl
Talk's performance.
Flowers said, however, that the committee might be hiring a coordinator
later in the week.
"One committee member stepped forward, and we're also advertising it to the
larger student body," she said.
Flowers, however, said that most of

"Worthstock is in May, so we'll be

Linder added that most of the current
LSE members have had at least one
semester of experience. •
As a student-led committee, the LSE
Committee is responsible not only for
brainstorming the event but also for con-

The LSE Coordinator is the only paid

other eight to 10 members work strictly

as volunteers.
After leaving her position, Kroll said
that she thinks the committee will be able
to effectively organize Worthstock.
"I have an enormous amount of faith
in the students that are on the committee,
and I'm sure they're going to put together
a fantastic show for Worthstock," Kroll
said. "[The LSE Committee members] do
everything they can to put on the best
events possible."

Linder also said that the committee
will have time to collect itself and organize the Worthstock concert, which is only
in the brainstorming stages at this point.

Though O'Neill and Postone,
both members of Earthlust, went
to Copenhagen to study architecture, they set out to get involved
with the climate conference in
any way possible.

They both spent the entire
two weeks of the conference,
commonly known as COPIS,
working with young activists
from across the globe. But it was
two weeks before the opening of
the climate talks at the Bella
Center when they discovered a
project that would become one of
their biggest- commitments
HeadQuarters.
"Originally, HQ was a purely
artistic project invented by the
French artist Thierry Geoffroy,

also known as Colonel. The idea
was to have artists working
together inside an art institution

reacting immediately to events
happening outside in the world,"
said Linda Peterson, another
core volunteer at HeadQuarters

who collaborated with O'Neill
before COPIS.
Working alongside the social
activist groups Avaaz Climate
Action Factory, The Yes Men and
ActionAid, O'Neill and Postone
transformed the Gallery Poulsen
in Copenhagen into an open collaborative work space and exhibition
for
organizations,
activists and artists to express
their views about the conference
through different artistic mediums.
HQ aimed to provide steady
commentary on the negotiations
and an alternate, reliable voice
even when access to the conference was restricted.
"Civil society access to the
conference was reaUy radically,
radically cut back as the conference proceeded," Postone said.
"It was pretty open the first
week and then towards the end

6

of the first week and the beginning of the second week, they
really did starting cutting down
the level of NGO and civil society access to the Bella Center."
While the main floor of HQ
allowed artists to showcase their
immediate reactions to summit
events in the form of artwork,
the basement was transformed
into a replica of the increasingly
restricted Bella Center. The
Bella Center replica welcomed
all to voice and capture their
opinions on video.

Before
COPIS, O'Neill spent the summer working for the Avaaz.org
Climate Action Factory with
other young activists organizing
environmental actions and camin several different
paigns
European cities.
For several months, they
tried to pressure governments
into passing a legally binding
global climate treaty to replace
the Kyoto Protocol, which is set
to expire in 2012. Political lobbying, banner drops and rallies
were just a few of their tactics.
Postone joined O'Neill in
Copenhagen in November 2009
for the study abroad program at
the Danish Institute for Study

Abroad.

"For activists and youth and
civil society, it was extremely

empowering and not at all
demoralizing, because you're
confronted with literally tens of
thousands of people who were all
there representing tons of different issues, geographies and iden-

tities," O'Neill said.
"Everyone

being

together

and contributing their skill sets
and experiences towards a unifying crisis that needs to be
addressed, I think that's really

powerful."
Beyond the gallery, O'Neill
and Postone also participated in

numerous demonstrations, some
of which took a violent turn by
the end of the conference.
One demonstration, known
as "People First, Planet First,"
took place before the chaos of the
second week and promoted a
more positive and peaceful tone
that attracted approximately
100,000 people. Postone said that
while they were walking collectively from the center of
Copenhagen to the Bella Center
to rally, HQ members still had
optimism for the outcome of the
summit.

negotiations, both O'Neill and
Postone said that they lost hope.

They now question whether climate change in the future can be
approached through the U.N.
process. According to O'Neill
and Postone, the 192 member
states should have equal opportunity to voice their opinions in
these negotiations, but that did
not happen at the Copenhagen
Summit.
"A lot

of people came together
to show that they were concerned about the movement,
which gives people hope that

about in the future, but the actual agreements weren't really as
strong as they need to be to hold
countries to commitments that'll
make a lot of positive impact,"
Earthlust member KC Cushman
said.
Though the outcome of the
Copenhagen Summit led to frustration, O'Neill and Postone
came back home with more confidence, a larger network of connections and more innovative
ideas for potential campaigns
and projects.

"What happened in the negotiations is pretty generally

regarded as a disappointment,
but people who were there really
were inspired by the level of
energy that descended upon the

city," Postone said. "A lot of the
U.S. youth have come back with

a lot of energy and a lot of new
campaign on how to approach
U.S. climate change policy."
For next year's climate talks
in Cancun, Mexico, O'Neill and
Postone intend to incorporate
more structure and organization
in HeadQuarters and hope to
receive" funding to establish a
new work space apart from the
gallery.

SusCom, activists work toward better communication
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY JACQUELINE SMALL

jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

In the wake of environmental
groups' criticism that a lack of
definition in the Sustainability
Committee was creating communication problems, SusCom has
taken steps to become more accessible. It has opened every other
meeting to the public, invited student involvement in some of its
new projects, and worked with
student green groups.
"We invited the student groups
to come and talk to us on several
occasions. They produced a docu-

ment of suggestions, many of
which we have adopted," said
engineering
professor
Carr

Everbach, co-chair of SusCom.
The Phoenix reported in
October that student green groups
were dissatisfied with SusCom's
effectiveness and the lack of communication between the two factions.
"It all turned around after the
last article was published," Zein
Nakhoda 'l2, a member of
Earthlust, said. Jacob Socolar 'IL
also of Earthlust, agreed.
"We've been in very productive dialogue for the last couple of
months now. I wouldn't say I have
any complaints about SusCom at
all," he said.

While SusCom meetings used
to be closed, they now are open on
a biweekly basis. An open meeting "gives everyone in the
Swarthmore community the ability to speak their minds,"

Everbach said.
He added that the committee,

in having only every other week
open, still wanted "some privacy
to allow members to speak their
minds without fear of being misquoted or quoted out of context."

Everbach said that one reason

students may be frustrated by
SusCom is a lack of understanding of how its money is to be used.
He said although many students
came to him with "great" ideas
for projects, the committee's

Renewing Fund is supposed to act
only as a resource for those projects that will make a profit to
replenish the fund. So far, no proposals have-been made which fit

that criterion.
Current plans for use of the
fund include using LED bulbs in
Sharpies, which will cost nine dollars less per bulb and are
brighter. The committee may ask
for student volunteers to unscrew
the current lights and screw in
the new ones.
Even more so, SusCom hopes

for student involvement in identifying hallways and foyers with a

mix of natural and artificial light
and bathrooms that have no light
switch or are always left on. The
committee wants to install sensors that will turn the lights off
when no one is in the bathroom or
when the sunlight in the halls or
foyers is sufficient. Students are

already in the works."

Linda McDougall, Director of

dining services, said she was
pleased with the overwhelmingly
positive response about recent
changes to the grab-and-go lunches. She also agreed that the situa-

Khan also explained that candidates should feel comfortable and

•Everbach said that he attributed the strained relationship
with student groups to a difference in vision for SusCom's mission.
"I happen to think we never
had communications problems.
There were just different ideas of
what SusCom should be and I
think we've suffered because of
the perceptions of green groups
and some students in particular,"
he said.
Responding to the criticism
that SusCom didn't act boldly
enough, Everbach said that the

committee is primarily meant to
make recommendations to the
college. According to its mission
statement, the committee aims to
"identify policies that promote
the most efficient use of College
resources, to coordinate and consolidate sustainability education
and communication, and to focus

attention on the Lang Center as
the vehicle for sustainability education and communication."
"We are as bold as we can be
within our charter, but we're a
committee of volunteers, and
without a real budget or much
power, we can't instantly reform
the campus," Everbach said.

Group gets Pericles funding for work with disabled

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu
After interning with the Chinese
NGO Joy in Action, Bettina Tam 'lO
wanted to bring her work with people
recovering from Hansen's disease, the
condition formerly known as leprosy,
back to Swarthmore.
"My goal was to continue to help
eliminate discrimination against people
with physical and mental handicaps,"

she said.
That goal now forms the backbone of
the mission statement of Global
Neighbors, a student-run service group
that was founded by Tam in 2008 and
that was recently awarded a grant from
the Project Pericles Fund.
Global Neighbors focuses its efforts

on two projects: helping the victims of
in China and volunteering with Children and Adult
Disability and Educational Services,
which is located a mile from campus in
Swarthmore Borough. CADES, according to Tam, is a local center for people
with physical and mental disabilities
that not only provides schooling for
children but also serves as a gathering
space for adults.
Project Pericles, founded in 1999 by
philanthropist Eugene M. Lang '3B, is an
Hansen's disease

not-for-profit organization
with 22 chapters at colleges and universities
across the country. The
Swarthmore chapter of Project Pericles
was established in 2005 by Lang-and the
Board
of
college's
Managers.
Swarthmore's Project Pericles Fund is
managed by the Eugene Lang Center for
Civic and Social Responsibility, and is
meant "to provide funding for social and
civic action projects of substantial scope
that are designed and implemented by
groups of Swarthmore students,"
according to its website.
Global Neighbors intends to use a
portion of the money granted by the
fund to send two

program, but that would likely require

fluency in Chinese.
Although Global Neighbors was initially founded to work only with JIA,
the limitation of two volunteers at a
time made the group add another project
volunteering at CADES. Members
of the group already visit CADES weekly.
Regina Collins, a classroom teacher
at the school, said, "Sometimes volunteers just sit there and look at the kids,
but the Swarthmore students are always
eager to help. They really engage with

the kids."

Global Neighbors plans to use the
grant money for the large-scale project
of working with children to create a
mural mosaic on the school's campus.

They will continue bringing people

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Admissions favors gender balance despite applicants
BY ALISSA RICHIE
VILLANOVAN.COM, JAN. 27, 2010

Merritt, as well as other educators,
look to three main reasons as to why
colleges aspire to admit a freshman
class equally composed of men and
women.
First, gender is part of the diversity equation, which creates a variety of
perspectives in the classroom, along
with race, ethnicity, class, geographic
location and other personal experiences.
Furthermore, coeducational institutions of higher education want to
create a community that serves both
men and women.
Likewise, colleges want to create
an environment that reflects the real
world after college, where men and
women must work and communicate
with one another in professional settings.
Students who apply to coed colleges
desire the chance to socialize with
both male and female peers according
to their preferences.
Conventional wisdom suggests that
a college campus where the gender
imbalance is especially pronounced is
less appealing to applicants overall.
At a certain point, a preponderance
of one gender may make a coed campus
seem
more like a

Although there is a larger influx of
female applicants nationally, the
University tends to have a natural
gender balance in its applicant pool a
function of the programs offered,
according to Steve Merritt, dean of
enrollment management.
However, many college admissions
offices are finding the need to attract
more male applicants for the first
time in history.
According to a Dec. 16 article in
The Chronicle of Higher Education,
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
is currently investigating 19 colleges
for evidence of gender discrimination
undergraduate
admissions.
in
Included on the list are Gettysburg
College, University of Delaware and
Johns Hopkins University, among others.
The main concern is that college
admissions committees are favoring
male applicants as the number of
female applicants
continues to
increase. If colleges are giving admissions preferences to men, they are in
violation of Title IX, the federal gender-equity law,
according to the
article. Public

and constitute
half the workforce.
"Women have
been able to gain ground on a variety
of indicators, such as test scores,
graduation rates for high school and
college and earnings in comparison to
men," said Jill McCorkel, a sociology
professor.
Many colleges strive

to admit an

even number of qualified men and
women but receive far more applications from women.
For example, according to a Dec. 14
article in The Washington Post, the
College of William & Mary admitted
43 percent of its male applicants and
29 percent of its female applicants in
fall 2008. Differences of this magnitude between men and women in
terms of acceptance rates can look
like gender discrimination.
However, factors such as programs
offered and geographic locations of
colleges may help explain admission
statistics by gender.
"Women are attending and graduating college at higher rates than men
at the aggregate level," McCorkel
said. "These rates will differ by location at the individual level."
A majority of the colleges on the
U.S. Commission of Civil Rights list
are located in the Northeast, where
women slightly outnumber men in the
general population.

THE PHOENIX

Sixty percent of current undergraduate liberal arts students are female
and 55 percent of current undergraduate science students are female.

The Villanova School of Business
and College of Engineering have higher proportions of male applicants. 64
percent of current undergraduate
business students are men and 73 percent of current undergraduate engineering students are men.
Merritt explains that the admissions process at Villanova is holistic
and seeks talented, qualified applicants above all else.
"Besides looking at numerical
qualifiers, such as grade point average and SAT scores, the admissions
committee also looks at personal qualities and experiences that cannot be
quantified," Merritt said. He also
thinks that gender gap by enrollment
is less of an issue for larger colleges
with more programs, such as
Villanova. For now, Merritt states
that the University's admissions
process is regularly reviewed and gender equality is not an issue of concern
for the University.

have ranged from 39 to 48 percent.
In fall 2009, 45 percent of all male
applicants were accepted and 48 percent of all female applicants were
accepted.
Merritt reports that Villanova
enjoys a fairly even gender balance.
"There is no effort on behalf of the
Office of University Admission to
provide any preference to men over
women, or vice versa," Merritt said.

The wide range of programs
offered at Villanova attracted roughly even numbers of male and female
applicants for fall 2009. Enrollment
by college reveals a much clearer
picture of where students apply
according to their interests and
career aspirations.
"The biggest difference in terms
of male and female applicants is that
many more women apply for the
Colleges of Nursing and Liberal Arts
& Sciences," Merritt said.
Ninety-five percent of current
undergraduate nursing students are
female, by far the most female-dominated segment of the University.

evidence of gender bias toward male
applicants is discovered.
The commission can only "draw
public attention to practices in a way
that could prompt action in Congress
or the courts," according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education.
McCorkel predicts that major
changes in policy regarding college
admissions are improbable for the
time being.
"Until somebody files a lawsuit
that claims discrimination or reverse
discrimination, it seems unlikely that
colleges will change their admissions
processes," McCorkel said.
At this point in history, women
outnumber men on college campuses
overall, and this trend will continue
to be tracked into the next decade.
"The economy also has an influence," McCorkel said. "I would expect
that more boys will apply to college in
the future because there are not many
well-paying jobs one can obtain without a college education. Competition
for jobs will propel men's achievement."

The art of bookmaking: mixingprint wirh poetry
npelaezl@swarthmore.edu

Combining the creative elements of
printing, illustration and bookbinding,

Mary Phelan builds an intricate craft.
Phelan, a professor of book arts here at
Swarthmore as well as an associate professor at the University of the Arts, is currently displaying her work at McCabe
Library. The exhibition, titled "The
Working Process," highlights the collaborative aspect of printing and book making.
It featured spans from the whimsical to the
traditionaland from the finished edition to
the work in progress, created using a variety of different book structures.
The works featured include Phelan's
own designs and those produced by her

press, the Irish Pig Press, but the pieces
also include the contributions of other

artists

from Swarthmore students in

her book arts class to collaborations by
groups of print artists to poet and
Swarthmore professor Natalie Anderson.

"Everyone brings something new to the
conversation," Phelan said. "Every project
will have its ups and downs, but the collaborative process is always interesting."

All of the work featured is fine press

printed, using handset type. This method
of printing, which is different from just
making photocopies of pages or printing

them from a computer, calls for a great
deal of planning and painstaking work.
Phelan said, "The first time I printed handset type it seemed totally natural and exciting

the process of making the paper, the

stitch, and then another and another."
Phelan expressed her enthusiasm for
working with Swarthmore students by
saying "I love my classes at both schools
but I am always impressed %ith my clafs
at Swarthmore where students with usually little art training do such interesting
work." Her course, offered every spring,
gives students the opportunity to learn
about and complete their very own artist

punch that you get when the paper hits the
metal type. It is very satisfying."
One of these collaborative works,
"Exquisite Horse," is based on the surrealist visual game Exquisite Corpse. The
piece uses print images of the front or back
halves of a horse, each one produced by a
different artist, and pairs them together.
The result is a seemingly infinite combination of images, and with each half
designed in a completely different style,
the results can be quite hilarious. Phelan's
own addition to this sequence is the rear
end of a pig
half the emblem ofher own

books.

press.
Two collaborative books done with stu-

dents from the Book Arts course,
"Relevancy" and "The Middle of
Somewhere," allow us to see some of the
work that Phelan does in her course.
Tayarisha Poe 'l2, who is currently in the
class, said, "[Book making] connects in
ways I never expected to all different parts
of art." Poe, who is also interested in filmmaking and fashion design, saw similarities between these three disciplines and
others. "Making books is similar to
ing what shots or colors to include in a
scene," she said.
The class has already begun learning
different kinds of structures to make
books, and many of the students have
already completed their first book: a
Buttonhole Stitch Sketchbook. Poe mentioned how relaxing the process can be.
"It's a repetitive thing that pulls you in,"

instruction librarian at McCabe Library,

exhibition. "Without artisans, like Mary
who are devoted to this an form it would
be a lost art," Harris said. This exhibition
draws fronvthe library's own impressive
and exquisite collection of artists books,
which is a part of the Swarthmore College

The event, which will include more than

are pretty excited," Harris said about the
library's involvement in Philagrafika. "We
hope to make [our participation] an annual event."
Anderson, who is currently involved in
a project with Phelan, also spoke about the
importance of the fine press as an art form.

extremely exciting for me," she said.
Anderson and Phelan have been working together with Philadelphia artist
Sarah McEneaney to create a book featuring a series of Anderson's poems,
Phobophobia, written about outlandish
phobias. The book, which is currently
unfinished, is one of the pieces displayed
in the exhibition and serves as a representation of the many phases and painstaking
processes that go into completing a fine
print book.
Anderson explained that the production of the piece has taken "much longer
than expected" but feels that "the final
product will be even more distilled as a
result." She described working with
Phelan and McEneaney as an "interesting
experiment for all three ofus," and one she
certainly has seen as rewarding. "I can't
wait for the book to take its final shape
to come to embodiment," she said.
This exhibition proves to be both innovative and imaginative, bringing together
the work of Swarthmore faculty and students and contributing to a larger and
highly relevant artistic event Each piece
exhibited also stands as an individually
evocative and exceedingly poetic work,
representing the book and text as artifact.
The exhibition will be on view through
Feb. 27 in McCabe Library. In addition,
Mary Phelan will be giving a talk about
her work at 12:00 p.m. on Feb. 25 at
McCabe.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Ambar La Forgia
Class Year: 2011
From: Sao Paulo, Brazil (but currently living in New Delhi,

India)

Current Residence: Mary Lyon

What She's Wearing:
La Forgia's outfit is an international affair. While her hat
is from Urban Outfitters and blazer from Zara, most of her
other clothing comes from shops in India and Brazil. La
Forgia's scarf is from Dilli Hut, the purse is from a store in
Connaught Place in New Delhi, and her ring is from a bazaar
in Suriyani Nagar all in New Delhi. The dress is from
Armazem and her tights are from Lupo, which are both
stores in Sao Paulo. The black leather boots are from ArNezo
in Sao Paulo, which La Forgia labels the "best shoe store
ever."
La Forgia has lived in different countries around the
world. "[l'm] not only visiting the country, but I actually live
there so I get to see how people in the country dress." Her outfit, though not featuring a sari from India or warm weather
attire from Brazil, still haselements ofinternational fashion.
Worn with a tailoredblazer and tights, La Forgia's fun and
bright dress echoes the beautiful colors worn in both Brazil
and India. Her use of accessories, like the cheetah print scarf
and the beret with an applique, adds great fixture and variety. This mix of sophistication with fun is what gives La
Forgia's look a cool take on a winter-ready outfit.
-

How She Describes Her Style:
La Forgia said that she always wonders what she would
say in describing her style. "I think the only [thing] I can [say
is] international and quirky," she said. "Someone told me
once that I dress like a mix of a can can dancer and a child,
but I don't see that." La Forgia's look is far from this mixture;
it's her ability to combine eclectic pieces with basics and fun
colors that characterizes her own style. She has a large scarf
and jewelry collection, all in very bright colors, "Typically
my scarves are electric blue or electric red," she said, 'and
the jewelry's just super bright and big."

Fashion Influences, Inspirations and Style Icons:
La Forgia cites her mother as her main influence. "I was
never into style," she said, but her mom's love of fashion (her

closet is reportedly bigger than Ambar's room) made her
start to think more about her style. "She doesn't let me buy
anything... unless she approves of it," La Forgia said. "I'd say
a lot of my clothing is a direct influence of what my mom
allows me to buy." After having moved from the Dominican
Republic to Brazil and now to New Delhi, her mom also cul-

turally adapts her style to

wear in each country.

what people

La Fbrgia mentioned admiring the '4os
glamour fashion and pin up style of burlesque artist, Dita Von Teese. "She's
always wearing nice coats and hats and
tights and heels," La Forgia said, "so I think
she would be my style icon." La Forgia also
flips through fashion magazines, observing
what the models wear in the spreads. "My

favorite thing about the gym [is] all the magazines," she said. Her room is also decorated
in magazine cutouts as sources of inspiration.

Where She Shops:
"Zara, to me, is the best for staples," La
Forgia said of the Spanish store, which is similar to H&M but specializes in European style.
"[ln] Brazil, Zara is amazing... I feel like in the
U.S., Zara isn't as good, but you can still find
good pieces."
She also loves Arezzo,

the shoe store in
Brazil where she got her boots. "It's amazing,"
La Forgia said. "I wear a lot of high heels, mostly because of my mom and because I'm short,
and every single one of my shoes is from Brazil."
Favorite Items in Her Closet:
"I love my big purses," she said. "I have two:
one from Brazil that's electric red and one from
India." La Forgia likes the convenience of oversized purses because she likes to have everything
with her. "My friends call them backpacks because
they're just so big." Her first high heel purchase, a
of black booties, is one of her favorite pairs of
es, and she wears them all the time. "I have to

Miss Martha Graham Cracker redefines drag theater

'

'

t

,

\

I

iMiss

!

L ■

The squeals and roars emitted by the audience when Miss Martha Graham Cracker sauntered onto the stage last Friday belied the iden& tity of the audience.
The sounds we associate
with boy band concerts and strip clubs blended
into a gleeful cacophony by Philadelphia's intel- ;
lectual and artistic elite, along with the rest of
Pig Iron Theatre Company's devoted followers.
Martha Graham Cracker, you see, is the
enchanting alter ego of Pig Iron co-founder Dito
van Reigersberg '94, and her appearance that
evening was in the service of the company as it
convened for its annual fundraiser/cabaret.
This year's benefit, "Hams Across America,"
Anne Coleman
featured talents from all over Philly, including
From the Green Room
L Curtis Institute trombonist Ryan Seay, Penn's
I mmm^mmwmwmm^mmmmtm all-male dance ensemble Dbamaka and the
cabaret singer with a cult-like following, Johnny
Showcase (the alter ego of performer David
! Sweeney, who appeared in the Philly Fringe this fall under the direction of :■
i Swarthmore alumna Adrienne Mackey'o4).
One might think that a leading lady like Miss Martha would object to
j sharing the spotlight, but it was no matter. Not even fellow Pig Iron cofounder/Swarthmore professor/clown-extraordinaire Gabriel Quinn
Bauriedel '94, who emceed the evening in a get-up that was straight out of a
Richard Simmons video, could hold the audience's gaze if Martha was near.
Van Reigersberg is an uncommonly tall man when he is not wearing heels
j and Miss Martha is a peerless lady who never goes without heels, so even at
first glance, this queen stands out from the crowd. That she fearlessly
flaunts her arm and back hair in strappy dresses while stomping and gyrating with the best of them only makes her more fascinating.
Her most exceptional trait, however, is her popularity. Miss Martha
Graham Cracker was selected by the Theater Alliance of Greater
Philadelphia to sing the closing number at its annual Barrymore awards
j ceremony in 2009, demonstrating just how much she is loved and accepted.
In the theater world, camp/drag performance is not a new phenomenon;
there
are long-standing traditions like the British pantomimes, which feaI
ture an archetypal character known primarily as "The Dame," who is
always played by a man in drag. By the 70s, artists like Ridiculous
Theatrical Company founder Charles Ludlam turned camp into a recognized
art form. In more recent years, shows like "La Cage Aux Folles" put drag
I queens on the docket for Tony and Olivier Awards. American audiences
have become more welcoming, but drag is still a niche art
that is, unless
i you are RuPaul or Miss Martha Graham Cracker.
Martha's acceptance can be credited in part to her connection with Pig

Iron, since the company has garnered attention all over the country for its
innovative work and process. The rest of the credit belongs to van
Reigersberg, who has developed his character with such love and regard
that she is' nearly seamless.
Perhaps it is also experience which has made him such a master; once a
month, usually on the second Thursday of the month, van Reigersberg dons
Martha's shockingly high platform boots and delights audiences at the
Philadelphia creperie/cabaret L'Etage. Van Reigersberg combines a quick
wit and Swarthmore education with the pop culture lexicon, ballet dancer
training (the pseudonym is no coincidence) and a knack for storytelling in a
madcap fashion that can only be described as genius.
Miss Martha Graham Cracker is a perfect drag diva, who can pop up from
crawling to prancing with a grace that eludes most women in more modest
heels and who can change from a wedding dress a la Madonna circa 1984 to
a salmon pink chiffon number complete with a 1920's coiffure without losing
the slightest bit of credibility. It is rare to find someone who can so thoroughly inhabit not only the many unusual characters ofhis own sex (which
include Federieo Garcia Lorca and a blue alien) that he has played for Pig
Iron shows but also the body of a bombshell, and it is worth a look.
The incomparable Miss Martha Graham Cracker will next appear at
L'Etage on Thursday, Feb. 18 at 8:00 p.m. She is a siren who brings- spunky
rockers like Johnny Showcase to their knees (literally, since she had him
proposing within seconds of joining him on stage) and brings audiences to
their feet, and she never gives anything less than her all. Your time will be
well spent.

Revitalized jam space offers a new musical outlet
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DINA ZINGARO
dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Students interested in music outside the academic

sphere have often found themselves with no place to jam,

at least without the risk of quickly making enemies. The
reemergence of the student-run Sound Machine will soon
remedy this problem. Sound Machine aims to offer
Swarthmore students a space to play and practice music
at Olde Club.
Ben Sailer 'O6 chartered Sound Machine in 2004, but
much of the equipment fell into disrepair after Sailer
graduated. Sound Machine was first chartered as a club
for students who paid a membership fee. Members could
use the space but were required to clean the area afterwards. The musicians hosted jam sessions and other
events for fellow musicians and the student body as a
whole.
This semester, the club has been reestablished
through the efforts of director Trevor Rizzolo 'll. "There
wasn't really anyone who was willing to take over and
put in the time to keep [Sound Machine] that way,"

Rizzolo said.
Since 2006, student musicians have continued to use
the space, and several students have controlled access to
the space, but there was little oversight of equipment
use. Equipment that broke stayed broken; no one looked
into getting the items fixed. This is what really attracted Rizzolo to the space. He is an engineering major with
a focus on electronics and an interest in musical elec-

tronics.

Rizzolo explained that repairing the broken equipment seemed like "a great way to build experience."
Although he is the primary caretaker of the equipment,
Rizzolo welcomes "any specialized knowledge" from students who may be able to help.
Now, Sound Machine has been revitalized and offers
its room and equipment to groups, individuals and established bands looking for a place to jam. After obtaining
approval from the Student Planning Committee, Sound
Machine now has official status. Rizzolo hopes that this
will provide an incentive for the organization to keep
going after he graduates.
Rizzolo has been a guitarist for about three years and
is a member of the band The Smile. Rizzolo first became
aware of Sound Machine when looking for a place to

practice last fall. He can sympathize with other student
musicians searching for a practice space.
"When I first found out about it, it was mostly that
you had to know someone who knew someone who could
tell you where it was," Rizzolo said. "The music department obviously has its own stuff; they do choir and
orchestra and jazz band, but if you are basically looking
to do anything else, you are sort of out of luck without
Sound Machine."
Sound Machine offers students an outlet to rehearse,
collaborate and share their music with other musicians.
"There's such a thrill to the collaborative aspect of making and shaping new sound alongside other people:
blending influences, sharing suggestions, and, of course,
the glory or horror of attempting vocal harmony,"
Jessica Holler 'lO said in an email. "I could invite a soul
guitarist or a funk pianist to some shindig with a couple
of banjo players, and who even knows what might happen?" Holler specializes in an unusual array of instruments including the banjo, guitar and baritone ukulele.
Through participating in Sound Machine, she is hoping
to locate other musicians interested in playing folk
music and to be able to have a space to play music with
them.
Rizzolo has cleaned up and rearranged the space in
Olde Club in order to provide better accessibility for student musicians. Also, he hopes to purchase new music
equipment with the additional budget granted to him by
the SPC. Rizzolo's addition of an equipment request
board allows members to easily place requests for instruments that they need. The equipment that Sound
Machine maintains includes two five-piece drum kits, a
small selection of cymbals, a PA system with two vocal
microphones, a guitar and a bass guitar along with several guitar and bass amplifiers, and a keyboard and keyboard amplifier.
Rizzolo considers the drum kit "the most unique draw

12

at Sound Machine," since the Swarthmore jazz band
maintains the only other drum kit available on campus.
Although priority of the equipment offered belongs to
Olde Club and the rehearsal space, some of the equipment can be loaned for use outside of the space. Students
do not have to be concerned about lugging around their
instruments since Sound Machine will provide the
equipment.
"I could go straight from a study session in Hicks to a
jam session in Olde Club," member Daniel Spagnolo 'l3
said. "That's awesome."
Rizzolo hopes to bring back the older tradition of holding open jam sessions for various types of music, which
was originally mentioned in the club's charter. Spagnolo,
who plays guitar, electric bass and ukulele, believes
Sound Machine will help accomplish his goal of performing as soon as he builds a band or writes his own songs,
which he has done in the past.
Rizzolo also mentioned the likelihood of a karaoke

Wesley Edwards 'l2 expressed his excitement to "jam
with some new faces." The space in Olde Club will allow
students the opportunity to re-embrace their passion for

music.

Bassist Julian Leland 'l2 found that even though he
has been playing music since the age of eight, his
"involvement with music has dipped sharply" since he
arrived at Swarthmore. He hopes Sound Machine will
remedy this and become "somewhere we can go to meet
other musicians, organize groups, learn and enjoy ourselves."
Sound Machine presents musicians in search of an
outlet the chance to channel their musical abilities
alongside fellow students. Perhaps Sailer simply said it
best in his charter for Sound Machine: "There are no
garages on campus. Rock bands certainly can't rehearse
in a Willets double." For students looking for a pratice
spot for their band, Sound Machine may provide the

night hosted by Sound Machine, but added that he needs
"people who are willing to do it and willing to be ridicu-

answer.
To reserve the space and request a timeslot, or if you
have any questions, please contact Rizzolo at soundma-

lous for it."

Washed-up country singer finds love,

merely a character in a film but as the legendary, alcoholic musician himself. Bridges'

Country singer Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) falls in
love with budding musician Jean Craddock
(Maggie Gyllenhaaf) in Crazy Heart.
BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu
Getting the chance to reconcile with oneself

and take control of one's life can never come
too late in life. Such is the case in "Crazy
Heart," an adaptation of a novel with the same
name by Thomas Cobb, directed by Scott
Cooper and starring Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake,
a down and out-of-luck country-western musician whose songs are more nostalgically legendary than popular or well-known by the

masses.

We first see Bad Blake on a very modest tour
as he drives from town to town in his old truck
playing his old catchy tunes, based on his life

experiences, for small audiences in bowling
alleys and bars, consuming dangerous amounts
of alcohol in the process. McClure's whiskey is
his trademark drink of choice and he continuously drinks himself to the brink of death to
cope with the failures and troubles that he has
experienced throughout life.
Then McClure arrives in Sante Fe where he
meets Jean Craddock, played by Maggie
Gyllenhall, the niece of the owner of the bar at
which he performs. Jean is an aspiring music
journalist who is hoping to write a piece on
him. His involvement with Jean and her fouryear-old son, Buddy, and the love that he has
for them give him another chance to take
trol ofhis life, after he loses Buddy at the mall
when he stops for a drink. As a result of his
experience, he goes to rehab for his alcohol
addiction and learns to become a better person,
all the while writing another grand masterpiece entitled "A Weary Kind," which contains
the lyrics "Pick up your crazy heart and give it
one more try," that encapsulates the theme and
message of the film.
The grand attraction of this film is the life
that Jeff Bridges imbues into the character of

performance really draws the audience into the
world of Bad Blake. The important aspect of
Bad Blake is obviously his alcoholism, and
Bridges skillfully delivers the most accurate
performance of being drunk on screen that I've
ever seen in a film. The way Bad Blake sways
when he is drunk, stumbles to put his belt back
on, or scrambles to get to a toilet or trash can to
barf is not exaggerated but subtle and effortless. Furthermore, Bridges does his own vocals
aptly performing the songs written for the
movie as if they were well-known classics. His
vocals also match the scene, turning up the
energy during the good gigs at huge venues or
good bars and stumbling when he's performing
completely wasted at bowling alleys. Bridges
performance is much deserving of the accolades it has received (i.e. Golden Globe Best
Actor Musical/Comedy) and may receive in the
future (Oscar?).
As a fan of the Coen brother's classic "The
Big Lebowski," one thing that I was interested
in seeing is how my perception of Jeff Bridges
as being "the Dude" would skew my viewing of
the movie. But I was impressed to see that Bad
Blake was not reminiscent of "the Dude" or "El
Duderino" (if you're not into the whole "brevity thing"). Bridges is able to aptly separate himself from "his Dudeness." It's true that both
characters are alcoholics that seem to stumble
through a good part of the movie.
In" addition, Crazy Heart seems to acknowledge "The Big Lebowski" in the opening scene
when Bad Blake pulls up to a bowling alley, a
place overtly frequented by "the Dude," and
scoffs at it, annoyed by the fact that he has to
perform at such an unworthy venue. However,
Bad Blake holds his own against "the Dude" as
a troubled musician in need of sympathy as
opposed to a proud and lazy, unemployed man
who's absurd existence is surpassed by the
absurdity of the events happening to him. The
fact that the two characters can be distinguished is a testament to the greatness of
Bridges' performance.
"Crazy Heart" features

a great cast including Bridges, Gyllenhall, Robert Duvall, and
Colin Farrell, as the country-western star,
Tommy Sweet. The entire cast gives a solid
performance to back the mildly heartwarming
story of a broken-down legend of a man who
needs a chance to regain his pride and glory.
Thanks mainly to Bridges, who makes a return
to the forefront of Hollywood, Crazy Heart is a
great film with a powerful message of hope that
the right chance and experience will come

around

AMC MARPLE 10 THEATER, SPRINGFIELD
Edge ofDarkness: Directed by Casino Royale's Martin Campbell, this film adaptation of his own BBC miniseries stars Mel Gibson as Thomas Craven, a former homicide-detective-turned-single father, who embarks on-a hunt to avenge his daughter's
death. Her death occurs in a bloody and public fashion; her body is strewn about on
the front steps of his home. After further investigation, Craven discovers that his
political activist daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) was not the innocent career
woman he had previously envisioned pre-mortem. The bullet was meant to finish off
his daughter, killing off her access to secrets to which she should never have borne
witness. Emma had been leading a double life, inevitably and unfortunately engaged
in a world rife with shady corporate deals and government crimes. While hunting
down Emma's killers, Craven encounters a government secret agent who may or may
not know the full plot behind Emma's death. R. 1 hour and 48 minutes.

When In Rome: Beth Harper is a successful museum curator in New York, but a
perpetually single one. And when love and romance disillusion ambitious young
women, the solution is evidently to go on spontaneous trips to Rome. In Rome, Beth
pickpockets enchanted coins from a local fountain of love. This single girl's spontaneous act entices a motley of weird and wonderful characters, struck mad with love,
to run after her: namely a street magician (Jon Heder), a wannabe painter (Will
Arnett), a sausage magnate (Danny DeVito) and a vainglorious model (Dax Shepard).
But when reality and magic start to blur into each other, who can determine when
love is real or not? A charming reporter (Josh Duhamel) pursues Beth with equal fervor. The audience is left to decide whether the reporter is romantically charmed himself just like all the rest or whether he loves Beth, plain and simple, without
enchantment. PG-13. 1 hour and 31 minutes"..Showtimes: 1:50 p.m., 4:45p.m., 7:15p.m.,

the best and the most well-known in his impressive nouvelle vague oeuvre. It is a staple of the genre and rightly so, incorporating hallmarks such as voiceover narrations,
newsreel footage, freeze frames and tracking shots. The plot is quintessentially nouvelle vague and characteristically European: a love triangle evolves between Jules
(Oskar Werner), a German man, Jim, a Frenchman (Henri Serre), and Catherine, a
Frenchwoman (Jeanne Moreau), with tragic consequences. But before the drama
rears its head, the menage a trois manage, to have a lot offun and playful intellectual
repartee. As the shadow of World War I looms over Europe, all three individuals continue to indulge in the bohemian lifestyle, ever determined to live

each other despite the übiquitous devastation of war. But their lively, yet convoluted
threesome is doomed to fail, propelled by Catherine's indecision over the two men.
yules and Catherine eventually marry and procreate, but Catherine remains attached
to Jim, and vice-versa. Still an influential film in our contemporary times, Jules et

Winning concerto competitors will display virtuosity

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY JOHN OH
joh2@swarthmore.edu
Every spring, the Swarthmore College
Orchestra holds a concerto competition
open to all Swarthmore students. While all
seven concerto competitors stepped up to
both the challenge and the jury that makes
winning a reality, two Swarthmore students
came out triumphant: Jenna McCreery 'lO
will be playing the Lalo. Cello Concerto in
the spring of 2010, while Soren Larson 'll

will be playing the Glazunov Saxophone

Concerto in the fall of 2010. The Swarthmore
College Orchestra will accompany both.

The

basic

requirement

for

the

Swarthmore concerto competition is to
learn an entire musical piece involving a
solo instrument, several chamber instruments, or simply voice. Contestants perform their chosen pieces before a panel of
jurors, which typically include faculty
members of the Swarthmore music department. Like any internationally renowned
musician, the winner of the competition
will be given the privilege of performing his
or her chosen work alongside a full orches-

tra accompaniment.
"It continually amazes me that busy
Swarthmore students, most of them not
music majors, take the time to learn entire
concerti and play them with great virtuosity and musicality," Andrew Hauze, college

orchestra conductor and competition juror,
said. "We should applaud all seven of the
winners for their dedication, but the rest of
school will applaud again when McCreery
and Larson step on stage to perform in the
spring and fall of 2010."
This spring, McCreery will perform the
Lalo Cello Concerto, a romantic tour de
force for the soloist, alongside the
Swarthmore College Orchestra in a concert,
which will also feature Dukas' "Sorcerer's

Apprentice," played in the Disney movie
"Fantasia," and the majestic Brahms
Symphony No. L In fall 2010, Soren Larson
will play his rendition of the Glazunov
Saxophone Concerto, with other repertoire

to be announced.
McCreery's and Larson's victories exemplify the dedication and time that they
poured into honing their performance technique, musical finesse and interpretation.
Despite their dedication to their musical
endeavors, these two winners also have
time for other equally impressive activities.
Here is some information regarding this
year's winners.
Jenna McCreery 'lO
McCreery studies with Yumi Kendall,
assistant principal of the Philadelphia
Orchestra. Jenna was introduced to the
cello at age six by her mother, Kristine Fink
McCreery, a Suzuki violin teacher. Soon
after, Jenna began studying with her father,
Carlton McCreery, until her high school
graduation in 2006. While under her father's
tutelage, Jenna made her solo debut with
the Hendersonville Symphony playing the
Vivaldi Double Cello Concerto with her
father. Jenna's summers at the Brevard
Music Festival gave her the experiences of
instruction under Andres Diaz, David
Salness, Roberto Diaz, William Prucil and
the Miami String Quartet.
Jenna served two seasons with the
National Repertory Orchestra in Colorado
and was the orchestra's assistant principal
Cello in the summer of 2009. She also gave
a solo performance of the Faure Elegie in
NRO's 2009 season. When visiting her home
in Alabama, Jenna serves as a substitute
Symphony,
for the Tuscaloosa
the
Huntsville Symphony and the Tupelo
Symphony. Jenna has served as principal
cello of the Swarthmore College Orchestra

2006. Current Major: linguistics
major, music and psychology minor.
Soren Larson 'll
Larson started playing tenor saxophone
in sth grade and began playing alto saxophone in 10th grade. He studied saxophone
with Minnesota jazz saxophonist Greg Keel
since

throughouthigh school. He was selected for
Minnesota's All State Concert Band in 11th
grade and Minnesota's All State Jazz Band

in 12th grade, both times on tenor saxo-

phone.

In his first two years of
Swarthmore, he studied with Charles
Salinger on E alto saxophone and this year
he began studying with Swarthmore and
New England Conservatory of Music alumnus Sam Lorber. He has played in
Swarthmore's jazz ensemble every semester since. Current Major: economics honors
major, math and music minor
How long have you played your instrument?
McCreery: 15 years
Larson: 11 years
What piece did you choose to perform?
McCreery: It is French composer Eduard
Lalo's only cello concerto. Increased compositions for solo cello in the nineteenth
century, like the Lalo Cello Concerto,
demanded more artistic expression and
technical proficiency from cellists than

ever before.

Larson: The classical saxophone literature,
is
perhaps
unsurprisingly,
small. Probably the most famous work that
prominently features a solo saxophone is
the second movement (called "The Old
Castle") of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition." Although a composition's popular recognition shouldn't be a metric of its
quality, this anecdote might illustrate the
limited nature of the solo classical saxo-

phone repertoire. When has anyone heard
sax with G-strings anyway? The repertoire's limited nature made choosing simpler.

Why did you choose this piece?
McCreery: I chose this concerto because

it is one of my favorite works for solo
cello. The dramatic flare in the themes of
the piece really complements my performance style. This concerto has special meaning to me because it is the piece I was studying when I first came to Swarthmore. I feel
like performing it during my last semester
here brings my Swarthmore experience full
circle.
Larson: I chose the Glazunov Concerto
because it's one of the best concertos in the
small literature. My teacher and Swat alum
Sam Lorber paraphrases the words of his
teacher, Kenneth Radnofsky: "the saxophone literature isn't very good but the
Glazunov Saxophone Concerto is the best
we've got." His teacher is probably right. A
majority of other works in the repertoire
sound like, as my friend Corey Silberstein
'l2 put it, "frivolous French film
music." The themes of these works are mellifluous but bite-size and ultimately forgettable. The Glazunov Concerto, however, is
remarkably Russian (i.e. romantic) and

compelling.

What are you most excited about after
winning the competition?
McCreery: I am excited to share my love
of music as a soloist for the orchestra in
which I have served for four years.
Larson: I'm really excited about sharing
with the Swarthmore Community that a literature exists for classical saxophone. The
saxophone isn't just for jazz, although not
traditional classical music. I'm excited to
share the uniqueness of it all.

Feeling stressed? Exercise might be the answer
I spent the last column
going on and on about exercise and how simple it can
be to add to your schedule.
As you may or may not
have noticed, I left out a

substantial chunk of the
argument for exercise in
that column. To be sure, it's
pretty clutch to know how
and when to exercise, but
that doesn't help you much
if you're not convinced you
need or want to be exercising at all. Enter this week's
Katie Becker
column: the missing "why"
of exercise.
Well, Well, Well. H
Why exercise? Why try
to cram yet another activity into an already overloaded
schedule? Why
brave bitterly cold weather to go for a walk or take a trip to
the gym? What's so important that exercise should get this
special treatment?
I could regale you with physical health benefits, but that
feels like a tired old line that no one pays much attention
to, if any, at this point. We're young, most of us don't have
heart disease or high blood pressure or diabetes yet, and so
we don't feel an urgency to keep our bodies working. An "If
it ain't broke, don't fix it" attitude. Which is unfortunate,
because there are substantial preventative health benefits
to exercise. But again, we are already inundated with
"healthy diet and exercise" blah blah blah all the time, yet
exercise still doesn't cross our. minds as a priority.
So I'm not going to feed you another tired old argument
that doesn't really affect you now in the body, mind, and
schedule of a college student. Forgive me ifI'm generalizing
too much from my own experience, but we want some more
immediate, visible benefits from the precious few activities
to which we devote our time. I get tired after days of class,
work, and reading, which means that venturing outside my
cozy room, let alone hauling my lazy butt down to the gym,
is not really on my radar as a super fun activity that will
make me feel better about my life. Plus, adding physical
exhaustion to mental exhaustion and sleep deprivation
sure as hell does not sound appealing to me most of the
time. If exercise isn't going to produce some tangible difference for me, then all those cons hold me back and I'm
more likely to take a nap than go exercise.
Amazingly enough, exercise does provide some benefits that most of us would be interested in. Mood, stress,
anxiety, sleep: these are some Swattie key words. We're
always talking about how stressed we are or how we're not

a

sleeping enough. And then there

are the things that we

might not be talking about, but we know are going on with
us and suspect are going on with our friends, such as
depressed mood and anxiety about assignments, family,
money, internships, friends, grades, etc. This place can be

stressful. We know that.
Luckily, exercise does more for you and your body than
just helping you to lose weight or to stay in shape. Exercise:
Causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn
help to elevate mood. Even if you approach your scheduled
exercise time with a sense of dread, you’ll come out of it
feeling happier. I usually get an added boost of happiness
during exercise because it’s an academics-free thinking
zone for my brain during that time.
Lowers stress and anxiety. You might be feeling overwhelmed by work and meetings to the point where you
think you barely have time to see your friends-. If you take
the time to exercise and decrease your stress levels, the
stress relief from exercise would more than pay off in terms
of the stress incurred by having another timecommitment.
You could then spend less time stressing about everything
you need to do and more time doing it.
Helps with the relief of depressive symptoms. I am not
suggesting that you stop a treatment regimen (therapy,
medication, support group, etc.) in favor of exercise if you
have a mood disorder, but exercise can be a helpful supplement to those treatments.
Improves mental clarity. Having a hard
time focusing in class or when you’re trying
to study? In addition to getting more sleep,
you could add exercise to your routine. The resulting boost your mental acuity would help you be more
efficient in your studying, and
we’re always looking for ways
to be more efficient.
Increases the amount of energy
you have during the day. I always
hate it when I’ve gotten tons of sleep
and still feel exhausted. As it
turns out, after an initial
decrease in energy, regular
exercise will increase the
amount of energy you have.
Instead of a morning coffee, try
a morning jog and see how your
energy levels are affected.
You may be tempted to
5) discard all of those beautiful
nuggets of information above
as another mere list of health
Carey Pietsch Phoenix Staff benefits that won’t really

,

to-day basis. In actuality, all of those benefits

can make you
a better student and a happier person, which counteracts
those pesky negative effects of too much schoolwork and an

overscheduled life. In addition, those benefits of exercising
dispel some of the myths that may be preventing you from
exercising. No more excuses about too much work, not
enough time, too tired, too depressed to exercise. You can
turn those times when you feel exhausted, stressed, and
overloaded into the perfect time to exercise. You'll have
more energy and focus for when you do go back to studying, and you might even feel more optimistic about your
ability to get work done. Why exercise then? Because
you're a Swattie, you're probably wracking your brain half
the time to figure out how to be a better student, and even
if you're not, you could always use more happiness in your
life.

Free news expectation demands new business model
It is not uncommon nowadays for pundits to claim that the news industry is
dying. This is a misrepresentation of what
is happening in an industry that is desperately trying to change its business model
by taking advantage of new technologies.
More news is consumed now than ever
before.
A Kaiser Family Foundation study
found that kids 8 to 18 years old average
seven and a half hours a day consuming
different media types—second only to
sleeping. The problem is that only three
minutes of that is spent on newspapers.
While overall consumption of media is
steadily on the rise, consumers do not pay
for their news and have grown to expect
not to pay for information. The challenge
the industry faces is to change this expectation.
The news industry won't die. But to see
why it won't, we need some information
about exactly why news isn't doing well
and what new business models could be
the answer to monetizing those countless
hours ofmedia consumption.

Quality journalism comes at a price
While it is difficult to determine
whether the quality of journalism has
dropped over the past years, it is certain
that many cuts have been made in the number of reporters that newspapers hire, especially those based internationally. Across
the board, newspapers are cutting coverage. It might not appear that they do, but
newspapers are increasingly substituting
wire stories, which they receive from corporations like the Associated Press, for
their own coverage. A direct consequence
is that more and more readers now get
their news from one semi-anonymous
source. In addition to this change, newspapers are also shifting from national and
international to local and regional coverage, which is less costly. Together these
trends lead us to a situation in which consumers will eventually have to pay to

access quality journalism.

Peace Logues I
m^^^^ i

The deeper I sank into
the morass of literature
on the Israeli-Arab conflict, the more I realized it
is impossible to truly
know anything about it.
After a while, I developed the only kind of "balanced opinion" one can
have on such a contentious subject: an amalgamation of polarizing
tidbits. It became an
assortment of equally-

weighted opposing blurbs,
dictated by two different
national narratives. My

conversations

became

quite ambivalent, often starting with "Well, it's clear
that..." soon to be followed by "But, on the other

hand..."
The truth is, there are enough facts, figures and well
thought-out arguments on all sides that you can believe
whatever you want to believe. There is no "getting to
the bottom of it." Anyone who tries to convince you
otherwise is selling something. Sage advice for thereal
world, Swatties: Beware the zealots who pass out
leaflets on the sidewalk. There will be many.
Since coming back from Israel, I've learned to

embrace my peculiarly cosmopolitonationalist, tempered emotional connection to the Jewish State that

balances like a see-saw on the narrow fulcrum of bias.
Full disclosure: I'm Jewish, and I studied abroad in
Haifa, Israel, in the spring of 2009. But let me be perfectly clear, because I know where your suspicions
must lie: I am in full support of the free State of
Palestine, without qualifications or reservations.
So here's something that will step on a few toes: I am
against campus activism on the Conflict.
I'll be explicit. I am vehemently against any sort of
political activism either on behalf of or against any of
the parties to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Activism
includes the small reading groups, the campaigns, the
discussions and the biased speakers thinly veiled as
academic presenters.

So that I am not guilty of the all-too-oft-indulged liberal arts student's habit of tearing down an edifice
without positing a solution, I'll offer my own: dialogue
and cooperation. True dialogue that promotes non-violence, political negotiations, coexistence and the bridging of ideological differences. Activism to fund Israeli
and Palestinian peace initiatives that are actually local
to the region.
Why am I against campus activism in its current
incarnation? Because I think an interesting process is
taking place at America's colleges: The conflict flies
over here from the Middle East, permeates the student
body and is perpetuated back out to the tired land from
whence it came in the form of emotionaland moral support. It is an ideological battle as much as a physical
one; the battle pervades the consciousness of students
and causes friction and fisticuffs at larger schools and
psychological stress and hurt feelings at smaller ones.
That is not to say that Swarthmore has caused the
bulk of my complaint; on the contrary, the groups here
have tended to precariously teeter on the careful side of
the fulcrum. That doesn't change the fact that I am
against the concept.
Anywhere besides Israel and Palestine, activism and
political lobbying on the conflict all rests on the faulty
assumption that one party (pick your poison) is mostly
to blame for the conflict, and that if the United States
could just see the truth, the offending party could be
restrained.
Seriously? Let's not pretend that this is simply about
balancing the scales. There are enough "underdogs" on
either side who are willing to stand with rhetorical
spears leveled at another group's throat. But I think it's
time that we all gave up the precious crutches of our
persecution complexes.
My point, exactly: Whenever anyone offers you

some advice on Israel and Palestine, ask what their
ideal solution is. If it deviates too far from a balanced,
down-the-middle-of-claims split, they're passing you
something smelly in a leaflet. Anyone who can ignore
the actual consequences of a solution, rationalizing it
to themselves on the basis of justice, is committing
criminal negligence. Kofi Annan said it himself on Dec.
15, 2006, in his last official speech on the matter:
"Perhaps the greatest irony in this sad story is that

there is no serious question about the broad outline of
a final settlement."
Yet extremism lives on. Behind every Hamas militant, behind every Israeli fighter pilot about to drop a
bomb, there is a college-educated intellectual massaging the fighter's wounded psyche, writing an article
that tells him he is doing the right thing. Today, the
elite cloak their biases and baser instincts in pretty
words, enabling the warriors just as much as if they
were to pick up the sword themselves. Are we, the new
generation who will write the new literature, going to
perpetuate the ills of our predecessors?
How much time are we willing to waste spurring
hatred and spinning justifications for feelings so
ancient that they need no reasoned arguments, only
rationalizations? I, for one, am not willing to waste
another second. Not when I could spend it doing good.
Or doing nothing, which is better by far than doing
harm.
Lest you think that I am attacking the Palestinian
side of activism, because that is the most salient at
Swarthmore, recall that in the rest of the country there
is a thriving activist camp for the Israelis that I equally repudiate. Please do me one favor, though: Don't discount that fact. It is not a trivial thing to take gross
exception with one's own "side," and the costs are real.
An ideological change did come over me in Israel. I
now have too many friends on each side to take a side.
I know too many Palestinians and too many Jews
whom the proposed solutions would affect. It has
become real to me.
Yet I see how unreal each side's grander visions are.
Let's not fuel that fire; rather, let's encourage cooperation. There are so many local movements in Israel and
Palestine that are dedicated to enhancing constructive
dialogue and building friendships. However, every
time we succumb to the temptation to bicker we starve
them of their funding and vitality. They could use our
support.

Kofi said it himself: It's possible to be a "true friend
and supporter of both sides." He sees himself as one. I
see myself as one. Don't talk to me about sides; I'm not
interested in hearing it. Just talk to me about peace.

Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger troubling for industry
BY KEVIN SULLIVAN

Tears no longer a far cry away from pro male athletes

swarthmorephoenix.com

With apologies to Tom
Hanks's lovable alcoholic
in "A League of Their
Own," it's starting to
appear as if there is crying
in baseball. And football.
And tennis. And just about
everywhere else.
Sure, it may have taken
Mark McGwire blubbering through an explanation of exactly why he took
steroids even though he
Timothy Bernstein
knew they wouldn't help
Bullet Points
him hit more home runs to
finally bring this phenomenon out into the open, but
the writing was on the wall long before his "admission":
There's been an awful lot of crying going on in sports
these days.
Whether it's McGwire in tears during his confession
to Bob Costas. Or Terrell Owens tearfully defending
Tony Romo after a playoff loss to the Giants. Or Jets
coach Rex Ryan crying in front of his team after a loss
to the Miami Dolphins. Or Roger Federer after
Wimbledon. Or Roger Federer after the Australian
Open. Or Roger Federer after the French Open. Or
Roger Federer after he stubs his toe. Or Roger Federer
after a particularly taxing Lifetime movie (the one with
the terminally ill patient).
The most interesting part of all this (maybe only to
me, but it's my column) is this: When's the last time
we've heard or seen anything involving a female athlete
crying? Aren't women supposed to tear up at the drop of
a hat? Yet there's nothing. Granted, there are fewer professional female athletes to follow, but to my knowledge,
those that do exist have avoided prominent waterworks
displays in recent years. Female tennis players aren't

crying, despite numerous opportunities to do so.
"Danica Patrick cries" has never been the title of a clip

on YouTube. In the four and a half minutes of WNBA
action I've watched in my lifetime, I saw no tears. Even
Kassidy Shumway, a collegiate soccer player who
became semi-famous last fall when another player
named Elizabeth Lambert grabbed her by the hair and
pulled her to the ground, staved off sobbing, and let's
remember that in sexist 1950s depictions of how boys
and girls interact, hair-pulling is the thing that boys do
when they want to make girls cry. Truly, times have
changed.
My point, and there is a point here, is that when no
one was looking, it suddenly became acceptable, even
somewhat admired, for male athletes to cry. Over the
years, sports had always been the arena in which it was
most acceptable for men to cry. Now it is simply occurring with an unprecedented mix of frequency and publicity. More importantly, the idea that the crier in question is "just being who he is" has also never been more
in style. Wearing his heart on his sleeve has long been
considered endearing in the sports world, but that
sleeve is more and more stained with the tears of its
wearer. Whether due to an evolution of the gender or
otherwise, it doesn't seem to be a problem at all.

I'm not sure if either "sympathy" or "condolences" is
the proper word to use when a lame event suffers the
tragedy of becoming even lamer. Whichever it may be,
though, is the one I would like to offer to the Pro Bowl,
which this past Sunday misfired on the hilariously
incorrect assumption that placing it before the Super
Bowl would build on the "hype." What ended up happening was that a large number of the selected players,
with two fewer weeks to recover from any lingering
injuries, dropped out along with anyone who would be
playing the following week in Super Bowl XLIV. Long
story short, Matt Schaub and David Garrard ended up

as the AFC's top quarterbacks. Once again, that's Matt
Schaub and David Garrard. With one simple date
change, the Pro Bowl has quickly become pro football's
equivalent of the People's Choice Awards
if you're
lucky, you'll see a few familiar faces, but chances are
most of the big stars "couldn't be here tonight, so David
Garrard will accept a Pro Bowl berth on Tom Brady's
behalf."
To add insult to injury, what little spark of excitement could have potentially been injected into the proceedings was promptly snuffed out when AFC coach
Norv Turner declined to take Chad Ochocinco up on his
offer to handle some of his team's kicks. Evidently, the
idea proved to be just a little too good for Turner to
process, much like the idea of not performing unnecessary onside kicks. This isn't to dump on Turner completely; by winning three playoff games in his career,
he's already moved into the top one percent for
Accomplishments By People Named Norv. It's just that
his failure to make a decision that would result in the
one interesting part of the Pro Bowl coming to fruition
is the latest instance of Turner taking potential and
turning it into less than it should be. Whether that
means refusing to allow Ochocinco to kick just one effing ball, or taking charge of the deepest roster in the
NFL and having nothing to show for it, Turner provides
us with an example of someone meant to follow instead
of lead. I'm reminded of a Russian phrase my greatgrandmother Esther used to use,
bo pa
BewaiOT, a no/rmHHoro necTßyiOT," which translates
roughly to "Norv Turner handled Troy Aikman's development brilliantly as a coordinator in Dallas, but he
lacks the dynamism and decision-making skills that are
the hallmarks of a successful head coach." She was a
wise and thoughtful woman who, ironically, enjoyed
watching the Pro Bowl. May she rest in peace.

things that
amaze me.
The first is

Swat athletes despise Kids' Night Out.
Since I only get a thousand words, which
can't possibly describe the absurdity of
Gates' diet, let's talk about the latter.
Kids' Night Out is an event hosted by
Swarthmore College Athletics that gives
kids in grades K-8 from the town of
Swarthmore the chance to play sports
with Swarthmore athletes for one night.
I'm completely aware that I'm in the
minority when I say that I love Kids'
Night Out (a minority of one, incidentally), and I'm committed to changing that
culture. My transformation plan begins
and ends right here, with this list of ways
to make one of Swarthmore's most frustrating traditions hilariously awesome.

There's a simple solution to all of this:
"Ask that guy..." Direct them towards
your leastfavorite teammate. It's a golden
opportunity to allow someone else to
annoy them for you anyway. This goes for
collecting the balls at the end also; do
yourself a favor and when someone wants
to know who's doing it, throw an "Ask

way.

We all know that trying to pry a basketball from an overly anxious gradeschool boy is a tornado of frustration
located somewhere between Sharpies during Ride the Tide and seeing Lady Gaga
win a Grammy.
While implementing these strategies,
never forget that the things that matter in
the real world make absolutely zero difference during Kids' Night Out. Even if
you literally peed in your pants in the
middle of Paces, these kids will have no
clue and they'll still love you, even if the
Swattie you were grinding with doesn't.
Realistically, you can take a break from
our hopelessly claustrophobic and incestuous institution for a couple ofhours and
create yourself as whoever you want to be.
Their ignorance can be your bliss; it's all
a matter of how you manipulate it.

Loss leaves Garnet ladies on brink of missing playoffs
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
Dramatic finishes have been the story
of the year for the Swarthmore women's
basketball team. This past week was no different as the Garnet (9-11, 6-9 CC) survived
a double overtime thriller on Saturday
against Franklin & Marshall before losing
another heartbreaker on Monday at home

against McDaniel.
In Lancaster, the Garnet led the
Diplomats throughout the majority of regulation. But the Diplomats' Megan Pauley,
who scored a career high 32, hit a three in
the final seconds to force an overtime session. In the waning seconds of that extra
period, the Garnet once again found itself
leading by three before Franklin
&

Marshall's Beth'Holt extended the game
with a three of her own.
Yet the Garnet was finally able to overcome

Diplomats in that

overtime,

Swarthmore knew that the McDaniel
Green Terror would be a tough test at home
on Monday night, but as they have all season, the Garnet played with one of the top
teams in the Centennial Conference.
The Green Terror ended Monday's
action having won 14 games in a row, their
last loss coming back on Dec. 1 against the
Garnet. But though Swarthmore committed just 16 turnovers, the Green Terror col-

lected 20 offensive rebounds, grinding out a
71-66 victory.

Swarthmore was led by Stockbower
with 19 points, Bodur with 15 and Madeline
Ross 13 with 15.
But even with Monday's loss, the
Garnet still find themselves only three

games out of the fifth and final playoff spot
in the Centennial Conference, with four
games remaining.

career night of Genny Pezzola 'l2, who
scored 24 points on 8-11 shooting from

as the Garnet's head coach, is thrilled with
the performance of Pezzola, who has

said.
This combination of team-wide energy,
positive attitude and aggressive play on the
court has the potential to keep the Garnet
in playoff contention. "We have nine conference games left. A lot can happen. We

not necessarily just the ball-handling [in
general], but specifically in very stressful
trapping situations at the end of games."
Pezzola believes that strong practice
habits will help the team decrease
turnovers through the remainder of this
season and looking toward the start of next
year. "To beat teams, we need to [put ballpressure] on each other at practice and
learn to take care of the ball that way
We
need to play aggressive and smart, and we
need to out hustle every team."
"Bringing the ball up the court, we need
to help each other out, pass the ball
around, and be calm and patient. Once we
get to half court, we need to set up our
offense and run a play because when we
don't run anything, things get frantic.
We either try to do too much individually
or make bad passes and cause unforced
turnovers," Bodur said.

FAVORITE DISNEY CHARACTER:
Olivia Natan Phoenix Staff

"Nala from The Lion King."

The matchup against the Green Terror,

one of the hottest teams in Division 111, is
only the latest tests on a brutal schedule for
the Garnet, who have the 49th toughest
schedule this year out of 433 Division 111
teams. But Pezzola knows that the team
will remain competitive through the final
stretch of its tough schedule as it looks to
move up towards the fifth spot in the
Conference playoff picture.
"Scrappy play will get us back in contentionfor that fifth seed. We want the win
so bad, and once we show how much we
love playing the game and how much we
want to win through scrappy playing, hustling and fighting for every possession, we
will be able to win those close games," said
Pezzola, who continues to make an impact
both on and off the stat sheets, taking

charges, finding offensive rebounds and
forcing tie-ups throughout the season. "Not
only does scrappy play sometimes result in
a basket or a rebound or an extra possession, it also raises the team's energy level
on the court, which will in turn make
every player on the court and on the bench
want the win so much more," she said.
After a 71-43 loss to Muhlenberg on
Wednesday night moved the team to 9-12
overall and 6-10 in the conference, the

Sputtering offense sinks Garnet
BY MARK CHIN
mchin2@swarthmore.edu

After defeating McDaniel 60-48 on
Wednesday, the Swarthmore men's basketball team headed into the game
against No. 14 Franklin & Marshall (16-3,
10-2 CC) this Saturday hoping to make it
three wins in a row against opposing
Centennial Conference teams. Though

the Garnet struck first, with Will Gates
'l3 successfully sinking a three-point
shot a little over a minute into the game,
the players could not consistently find
their shooting strokes for the remainder
of the 38 minutes. As a result, the team
failed to capture its third straight win
and instead suffered its worst loss of the
season to the Diplomats, 77-47.
Though they trailed after the first
half of play, the Garnet were able to
defeat McDaniel the past Wednesday off
of a strong second half showing. The
Garnet men, who had not been able to
string consecutive wins for the entire
season, won their second straight with
the victory over the Green Terror.
The win over McDaniel showed the
team's potential when its offense was
clicking
on
all cylinders.
The
Swarthmore men sank 14 of 18 freethrow attempts in the second half of the
game alone, demonstrating the team's
ability to attack and get to the line in
crunch time. The Garnet also shot very
well overall for the game, shooting 45.5
percent from the field and 46.2 percent
from three-point land.
Yet the Garnet's offense was unable to
find a similar rhythm for nearly all of
the game against Franklin & Marshall.
Gates led the team in points and
rebounds with 22 points and 7 boards,
but no other player was able to score in
double figures, a fact that undoubtedly
helped to sink the Garnet's hopes. The
team as a whole shot 30.5 percent from
the field for the game and missed nearly
half of their 27 free throw attempts.
Despite what the final score suggested, some players on the team felt that it
ultimately was the poor offensive showing that spurred the Garnet's defeat, not
a lack of effort on the defensive side of
the ball.
"Our defense did its job, with

[Franklin & Marshall] only scoring 30 in
the first half, but only scoring 14 ourselves put us in a deep hole against a
really good team," Gates said. "The second half we played pretty well and were
just about even with them, but we were
just way too far behind against a team of

February 4, 2010

that skill level."

"I thought [the team's execution of
the game plan] was okay. It's tough play-

ing without Ryan Carmichael. The
defense we wanted to run that particular
game made not having him difficult,"
added Coach Lee Wimberly. Carmichael
'll, who normally starts at forward for
the Garnet, sat out Saturday's game
because of illness. "We're going to be
without Ryan Carmichael again for this
game on Wednesday, and we're just trying to make some adjustments and figure out what our personnel situation is
for that game. [Muhlenberg] is a tough
place to play," Wimberly said.
Though the team suffered its worse
defeat of the year, the game against
Franklin & Marshall was not without its
positive revelations for the Garnet. Sean
Conroe 'l3, who received a significant
amount of playing time in the absence of
Carmichael, contributed seven points off

the bench.
"As a freshman, my main objective is
to find out ways to contribute in any way
I can, and try to use every practice as an
opportunity to get better," Conroe said.
Many of the players also agree that,
despite their loss, the team's defensive
intensity has improved throughout the
season, and this improvement has been
one of the key components in the team's
run for the final spot in the Centennial
Conference playoffs.
"[A win against Franklin & Marshall]
would've been a huge win for our program, but we know that we're playing
well and that if we just play defense the
way we've been playing, we can win all
of our remaining games," Gates said.
"At this point, every game is a mustwin in order to give ourselves a chance
to slip into the playoffs," Conroe added.
"We're currently half a game out of
being tied for sixth."
The team's offensive intensity will
have to catch up to its improvements
made on defense, however, if the Garnet
are to have a chance at making the playoffs. "We need to do a much better job on
scoring inside and a much better job on
defending inside. I've been disappointed
with what we've gotten from the front
line in that regard," Wimberly said.
"And we absolutely need to shoot the ball
better to give ourselves a better chance
[the rest of the season]."
The men's basketball team look to
keep its playoff hopes alive at
Muhlenberg on Wednesday at 8 p.m. and
at home against Johns Hopkins on
Saturday at 3 p.m.

Men drown Bullets, women fall short on Senior Day
