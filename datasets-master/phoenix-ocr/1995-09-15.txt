IC Considers Adding
New Student Groups
By Fred Bush

in joining. Chang-Muy said that
under the original charter, a group was
eligible to join the IC if it worked on
"issues ofrace, gender, and ethnicity and
actively [thought] about these issues."
Several groups on campus exist to address these issues besides those currently
in the IC, he said. However, now, just as
when he arrived, there is no provision for
allowing new groups to join: "When I
came here I was told,' Hereis the IC; it is
madeupof SAO, LBGA, and HOLA. No
one ever talked about new members,"
Chang-Muy said.
So why change thepolicy?Said ChangMuy, "Nothing is static. Everything is in
motion and everything changes. The issues thatexisted then [at the formation of
the IC] are not the issues that exist now."
He hastened to add that the IC board is
still working on policy changes and is not
yet ready to implement any changes.
Perhaps it's a good thing the policy is
not ready, because the potential members may not be ready to joinright now,
either. Members of Ruach, the group
mentioned most often by Chang-Muy as
a possible new member of the IC, seem
rather hesitant about the possibility of
joining. Member-at-Large Margaret
Cohen '97 says, "I don't think Ruach
even has a position on joining the IC. It's
not something we talk about." Ben
Thomases '97, the Facilitator and Head
ofRuach echoes this sentiment: "No one
from theIC has approached us with this...
I'm just not sure what membership in the
IC entails and whether the space provided to members would fit our needs".
He added, "I'vebeen on the Ruach board
for two years and we haven't discussed it
at all."
Chang-Muy said he hopes that, with
the new policy, and a semester's worth of
speakers and events, the IC will be better
able to fulfill its goal of reaching out to
the campus, and more people will be
discussing the IC.

everyone".

The IC is now reviewing its policy in
an effort to include more groups under its

rubric. Chang-Muymentioned theCoalition Against Xenophobia (CAX), Ruach,
and theWhiteness and Racial Issues group
as organizations which might be inter-

sprung in organizations, corporations,
schools, even colleges. Even Swarthmore
College. Aprovision in the latest draft of
the Student Council constitution, passed
last semester, allowed each council to
decide whether to have open or closed
meetings. At last Sunday's meeting, the
Student Council voted 8-2 to open its
doors to the public.
Most members agreed that while privacy has its virtues, openness pays off in
the end. However, most members also
agreed with Student Council Co-Coordinator and Appointments Chair Seth
Harvey '97, who said, "if the Student
Council feels that certain issues require
some degree of privacy, we reserve the
right to close meetings or portions of
them."
According to Council member Joseph
Goodman '97, who voted for the motion,
there were only two reasons why anyone
would decide against it. "The first reason
is when there are personal situations involving affairs that the participants do
not want made public," he said. These
include appeals of charters and appointments. Also, when someone has to appeal a decision and does not wish to do it

Opinions Vary On Proposal For
Electronic Registration System

An electronic system for Registration

but for the system to be implemented,
many questions and problems must first

As the Intercul tui al Center begins another year of sponsoring multicultural
activities on campus, it is considering
allowing more groups to come under its
banner. IC Director Fernando ChangMuy said that the Intercultural Center
has two goals: "One is to provide support
and space for those organizations that are
already part of the IC; and the second is
building upon that space to reach out to
everyojne at Swarthmore."
Chang-Muyfeels that this second goal
is often overlooked: "We have a complete series of events for the fall and
spring, and absolutely everything is open
to the public," he said. He pointed to the
IC's upcoming series of talks by activist
alumni, Swarthmore faculty and outside
speakers like Rigoberta Menchu, winner
of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, all of
which will be open to the entirecampus.
Chang-Muy worries that too many students viewthe IC as an exclusive site: "If
even five people think that the IC is a
closed space [to some members of the
student body], that's a concern".
Of course, the IC sometimes does serve
as a private space for its three members,
the Swarthmore Asian Organization
(SAO), the Lesbian Bisexual and Gay
Alliance (LBGA), and the Hispanic Organization for Latin-American Awareness (HOLA). However, for them theIC
does little more than provide a meeting
space, which Chang-Muy said goes unused most of the time: "For something
like three hours a week, the IC is being
used to support meetings, and that's it.

However, the arena format brings all
the faculty together and presents an opportunity for the students to ask ques-

tions concerning various courses. Dean
Bob Gross, a former Professor of Education, said thathe "liked to see the students

who were going to be in his class beforehand." The easy accessibility of faculty
and the personal quality of being "faceto-face" with the student or professor
would be lost in the computerized sys-

the departments use to conduct lotteries.
Professor Craig Williamson, Chairman
of the English department, said that preenrollment "gives a rough idea of the
number of students interested in the class.

tem.

But when it comes time to actually signing up, many students change their
minds," so that "many of the faculty do
not put much faith into pre-enrollment."

For electronic registration to work,
some kinks in the present registration
process would have to be worked out.For
example, many departments hold lotteries for popular courses. But many students are confused as to what time, what
place, and for which departments the
lotteries are being held. It is not certain
whether a completely computerized system would remedy difficulties incurred

by lotteries.
A form of electronic registration has
already been in use at Swarthmore. It is
the computerized pre-enrollment system

Student responses to the idea of electronic registration have varied. Matt
Grossman '96, thought that it was "a
good idea." Amity Cox '99, however,
said, "The Freshmen would not be able to
learn the computerized process during
the short period between Orientation and
Registration." Dean Gross, who is also
an academic advisor, said that there are
many ways to side step these difficulties.

reserve power to close meetings, because
we can foresee things of a personal nature or appeals coming out, where things
should be dealt with in a smaller forum."
The second reason to keep meetings
closed would be to maintain order.
Goodman said, "There are some obnoxious people out there, and if they show up
at a public meeting, we'll be sorry we
made them open. However, that's easily
remedied by calling security."
Not everyone agrees. Those against
open meetings voiced their fears of students interrupting meetings. "I think I
see where the opposition is coming from,"
saidS akhuja. "I believe that some people
felt that maybe, if not now, in years to
come, people could deliberate and do
better work if they did not have the 'distraction' of so many others around. However,"he added, "Iwould welcomepeople
to come to our meetings if they are interested."
"The burden of truth shouldfall upon
the council members to show that their
duties are above public scrutiny and rebuke," said Goodman, "rather than upon
the student body to prove that it has the
right to observe its electedofficials. Anyone who thinks that people actually trust
the maniacs they elect needs to associate
more with normalpeople. Expecting students to trust us when we have closed
doors is inane."
The issue of open meetings is not the
only issue being deliberated."One of our
most important concerns is improving
student life," Harvey said. This includes
striving to get housing for all Swarthmore students who want it, working on a
revised food/meal plan, and exploring
the options of cable television. "It's most
important to have goals and specific
timelines to hold ourselves to," Harvey
said, adding that "we would like to see a
book sale happen next semester."
Also on the agenda is increasing the
presence of security and thereby making
it more effective, an extremely important issue to many students.
There has also been talk of improving
Registration by making it all computerized as well as "increasing communication between the administration and students with the StudentCouncil being the
vehiclefor the exchange of ideas," Harvey
said. He added, "In the past, the link
between the two has never been as firm as

possible."
Next week's meeting will get the ball
rolling even further.Whereas last semester, Sakhuja said, the Student Council
was "bogged down by creating a constitution," whereas this semester it could
devote its energy to reforms in the "meal
plan, housing, and security.""We'll look
at...setting dates and assigning people to
work at each goal," Harvey said. "By the
end of the semester, we want to say that
we have been focused and attained something that we've been working on this
semester."

Milligan, Tide Overpower Earlham
By Frank Amar

The Garnet Tide relied on a bruising
ground attack and a big play defense as
they defeated visiting Earlham 28-21
this past Saturday. Nick Milligan '96
rushed for 108 yards and scored three
touchdowns, Frank Amar '96 chipped in
with 106 yards, and the defense delivered several key momentum swings that
turned the game around.
The Tide's opening driveof the game
and the season gave the fans a preview of
what to expect this season: power football. The offense utilized a straight ahead
and perimeter running gameand several
short, high percentage passes. Unfortunately, the drive ran out of gas deep in
Earlham territory and ended on a failed
4th down-and-1 attempt by Kurk
Selverian '97. The Hustlin* Quakers responded with an equally impressive 7
play, 75 yard scoring drive. The score
remained 7-0 into the second quarter,
when the defense came through big. On
Earlham's first possession of the second

quarter, the defense held them to a three and-out. Blessed with great field position, the Tide drove down the field and
scored their first touchdown of the year

on a 4 yard run by Nick Milligan '96.
The defense struck again on Earlham's
next drive. On a slant across the middle,
several defenders, including Sean
Mcßride '96, converged on the receiver
and produced a bone-jarring hit. The ball
popped loose into the hands of Matt
Wiggins '96, who returned the ball into
Earlham territory. Eight plays later,
Patrick Straub '97 (10-19 for 87 yards)
shot putted a pass to Milligan, who, despite hobbling the ball, was able to cross
the goalline and make the score 14-7.
Coming out of the locker room,
Earlham seized the initiative and swung
the momentum back in their favor. The
Hustlin' Quakers drove straight down
the field and culminated their eleven pi ay
drive with a touchdown.
"Coming into the second half, we were
flat," said defensive coordinator Don
Burns. "Mentally, we appeared ready.

but we just weren't able to do it physically. We got away from the basics and
we got burned."
The Garnet Tide offense came away
empty on their next drive, and Earlham
regained possession. They got inside the

Tide's 20-yard line but had to settle for a
field goal attempt. Thus, the stage was
set for the most dramatic play in the
Garnet Tide's young season. Matt
Wiggins '96, coming off the right end,
blocked the field goal attempt. "Wiggins,
along with Keith Pieck '97 and Kurk
Selverian '97 were some of our most
positive factors on defense," said Burns.
"They did their jobs, and made few mistakes." Rejuvenated, the Tide offense
marched ninety yards, aided in large part
by a 39 yard rumble by Milligan, and
made the score 21 -14 on a 1 yard run by

The Feminist Majority Foundation, an
activist group located in Arlington, Virginia that promotes feminist leadership,
has taken its program to college campuses this year. Swarthmore College is
among twelve institutionsnationwide to
implement a Feminist Majority organization on campus.
The Feminist Majority Foundation's
mission is to train feminist leadership
and provide feminist services through
education and research. The Feminist
Majority, its sister organization located
in Los Angeles, California, promotes
grass-roots activism through various programs, including the National Clinic
Defense Project, the Becky Bell/Rosie
Jimenez Campaign, and Emergency
Clinic Survival Fund.
The National Clinic Defense Project
works to keep women's health clinics
open and organizes a violence watch at
such clinics to prevent harassment by
abortion opponents, which was essential
in countering the activism of Operation
Rescue. The Bell/Jimenez Campaign
fight* to lift parental consent laws and
federal funding restrictions that can cause
young and poor women to seek backalley abortions.
In 1994,interns at theFeminist Majority Foundation in Arlington started a
branch of the organization at Duke University. Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, the Feminist Majority Foundation, and former president of
NationalOrganizationof Women, wanted
to develop a plan for new feminist organizations across college campuses. This
past summer, seventeen interns, including Kristin Sostowski '97, worked with
Smeal to establish a program thatwould
begin a Feminist Majority organization
in each of their respective schools.
Swarthmore, Duke, Cornell, Princeton,
Brown, Oberlin, UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, Skidmore, Purdue, Miami University of Ohio, and Connecticut
College are among the schools with newly
formed organizations. The Feminist Majority intends to spread to other college
campuses in upcoming years.
Sostowski, along with Amy Albert '9B
and fourteen other students, have begun
planning the goals of the Swarthmore
branch. Plans include bringing feminist
speakers to the campus and providing
training for feminist activism. The organization hopes to network with other
common interest groups on campus, since
Sostowski said, "even at Swarthmore, I
find that it is shcoking for many people to
hear what [feminism] actually means:
the advocacy of political, social, and economic equality for women and men." On
a larger scale, it hopes to achieve a connection with Swarthmore alumnae involved in the feminist community. The
Swarthmore Feminist Majority will also
try to provide a voice for feminist concerns on campus through student government appointments.
The organization wants to work on
developing a stronger sense of community between female students, faculty,
and staff, as well as exploring prominent
issues on campus like sports equity, child
care, and maternity leave for professors
and staff. They intend for theirresearch
to shed light on many questions sur-

rounding women at Swarthmore, such as
why a disproportionate numberof women
intending to major in engineering eventually switch to another department. In
general, the members of the Swarthmore
Feminist Majority wish to foster an environment on campus conducive to discussing feminist concerns and issues, an
aspect of Swarthmore that has lacked
attention in the past.
The Swarthmore Feminist Majority is
also hoping to make an impact beyond
the campus as well, through community
outreach work with non-profit organizations in Chester and Philadelphia and
volunteering at shelters in Media. The
group will work on the Domestic Abuse
Project's Clothesline campaign. Similar
to the AIDS Quilt, the campaign displays
T-shirts made by women whohave been
victims of abuse as a demonstration of
unity and strength. Other options the
members have been thinking about include establishing a program at
Swarthmore that would educate elementary school girls on issues of gender equality and self-esteem issues. This program
would encourage feminist leadership at
an early age.
One of the other main projects that the
Feminist Majority at Swarthmore plans
to work on is a Rock for Choice benefit.
Rock for Choice was started in 1991 by
members of the band L 7 to give young
women the knowledge that they have a
voice in terms of both government and
what happens to their bodies. Rock for
Choice (R.4.C.) organizes benefit concerts and gives the proceeds from the
ticket, button, and T-shirt sales to the
Feminist Majority for their various
projects. During thebenefits, participants
obtain informative literature and sign
petitions to send to Washington, DC. The
Feminist Majority at Swarthmore hopes
to work with nearby colleges Bryn Mawr,
Haverford, and the University of Pennsylvania to host its R.4.C. benefit with
local bands in Philadelphia.
Albert said, "I'm excited to be working on a project which has thepotential to
reach a diverse group of people on campus and to be a really powerful social
force in the creation of feminist leadership on campus, in our community and in
the greater national sphere." All themembers of the Swarthmore Feminist Majority feel that the organization will have a
positive effect on the campus.
Ultimately, the grouphopes to become
financially independent and be able to
return themoney granted by the Feminist
Majority Foundation so that it can be
used to start another branch on another
college campus. If the Feminist Majority
college branches expand, they will also
be able to provide an employment service for young women who want to be
field organizers.
Sostowski commented, "It is my sincere hope that by establishing a feminist
voice and forum for discussion on this
campus, women and men that have never
identified [themselves] as feminists in
the past will consider what feminism is
truly about. With set plans and a prominent national organization supporting it,
the Swarthmore Feminist Majority is off
to a strong start. It will have its first open
meeting on Monday, September 18th at
9:30 pm in the CRC. All are encouraged

In efforts toattract the best and brightest to their firms, companies today tend

With the stakes so high and highly

"making a good impression is critically
important."
Here are a few questions corporate
recruiters have asked to woo potential

-Do you get laid much at your school?
-Is your boyfriend white?
-Describe the making of a perfect banana split.

system.

Yet, a strikingparallel lies in the fact that both
trends are driven by the same lack offaith m the
institutions that are considered responsible for
curing society's biggest problems.
According to Peter Powers, New York City's;
Deputy Mayor, "educators have controlled this
system since its inception, and no one is happy
with results." Replace the word "educators-" with
"Democrats" and you basically have the Republican campaign message from 1994.
Now it seems that many "outsider" politicians
and non-politicians alike are ready to shape their
candidacies around that same theme. They're basically saying the system is broken, and askingto
fill in the gap in people's hope.
Why is thisdangerous? Well, first of all; if the
system is truly "broken", as Bradley claimed after
his retirement, then by feeding it CEOs and military heroes, do we necessarily change it, or do We
just provide fresh blood?
I wonder what is to prevent either self-labelled
or true outsiders to education and politics from
making the same mistakes which have already
soured the public's perceptions.
Furthermore, what about competence? Whfle
one could hardly question Bradley or Jackson's
competence as politicians, it seems Odd, at the
very least, to pry the educational system from'
educators for the sake of a single goaf' such as
balancing the budget ot maintaining discipline.
Both schools and government are far more complex than they may seem to all those who believe
that tough stances, tightened pockets, and common sense can solve our nation's problems.
Maybe all this talk about the "radical middle"
and their desire to see change in the form of
independent campaigns and ousted superintendents is overblown. But politicians who ire shaping their campaigns and elected officials faced
with the rampant social, economic, arid educational issues that confront urban school districts
these days are listening.
Before we hafid over the reigns of oui government and schools to these "outsiders", we must
decide: are we promoting healthy reform of simply indulging in fantasies?

I Would Rather Use E-Mail Orientation
is Overkill
'''

by Alex Lundry

When I arrived on the campus of Swarthmore
College, I brought with me a certain sense of fear
and apprehension which I could not quite define.
I understood thatI was entering a world of higher
education where alot more would be expected of
me in those lofty areas such as academics, sports,
activities and drinking beer.
Call me naive, but I figured that the least ofmy
worries wouldbe getting my mail on a daily basis.
My experience with the battleground that is
known as the Swarthmore mail room began innocently enough with the simple task ofreceiving
My own personal mailbox. To my great surprise
I found out that I had recieved a bottom, and I am
talking bottom, mailbox.
1 Not only was I placed on the lowest level of
hell, but they also stuck me in a comer that is by
far the most populous of themail room. In my few
days here at Swarthmore I have recieved the
following injuries from the simple act of checking
rfty mail: two Charlie horses, a sore back, and
plenty of stepped on fingers.
In the process of collecting my mail, I have
been told the following things: "You really get to
know people intimately when you have one of
those boxes," "I hope you're flexible!" and by far
the most eloquent and descriptive one, "Wow,
that really sucks!" As you can see, the lower
mailboxes are held in the same respect that the
food at Sharpies is.
Yet from whatI understandmine is not the only
predicament that people face daily in the mail
room. I have been told (and this is pure word of
mouth) that there are those who face just the
Opposite problem that I have.
Take for example a dorm mate of mine who is
vertically challenged. From what I understand,
'said person was assigned a tippy, tippy, top mail
box.
Here is the daily routine which she has fallen
into. 1) Push her way into the actual mail room.
This is a difficult enough task for those who have
never been in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
2) She then must clear herself a path fromher box

by Jen Phllpott

For the most part I am very happy here at
' Swarthmore. I go to class, study in McCabe, talk
to my friends, and eat in Sharpies with a feeling of
comfort and ease because I am a member of a
strong and supportive community. Well, I don't
exactly remind myself o>f that every day, but you
get the idea.
I am proud of this school and of the fact that I
have been included in this community. All right,
I obviously did not write to The Phoenix to reassure you all that I am supremely content with my
choice in a college. So, I will get to my point.
A recent incident caused me to consider my
naive feeling of satisfaction and take stock of this
community that I generally praise. I was giving a
tpur to a large group of high school seniors and
their parents late last week at the same time that
there were a lot ofmessages chalked on sidewalks
around campus.
Normally I don't notice the chalkings, or I read
them once, accept their message, and move on. At
times, the various messages have made me uncomfortable, but I usually just shrug and accept
that the sidewalks are a public forum and that we
all have a right to express ourselves via chalk.
Besides, thewords thatmay irritate me aire quickly
Washed away and don't leave a permanent physical mark on our campus.

for his or her life when they step into the post

I think that the disgruntled postal worker is
something that is as American as baseball and
apple pie. Yet at the same time, I am concerned
that the college is depriving us of the U.S. Postal
Service experience by putting us in these horrid
mail rooms.
Call me crazy, butI beliefthat the day will come
when I can reach my hand into my mailbox and
not have to worry about being able to bring itback
out. I foresee a future where mailbox assignments
are made according to height and not by housing

I envision a time when the postal window will
be open when I need to get a package. I can also
imagine a situation where all the students of
Swarthmore College can cast aside their worries
about mail and direct them towards the more
important things at college, such as academics,
sports, activities, and drinking beer.

I am forced to admit that it would have been
unfortunate if we had been left by ourselves to
flounder around the first week. But Orientation
week had obviously set itself to give such paltry
issues as "where buildings are" a rather cursory
glance, instead undertaking the monumental feat
of redefining "overboard" and "overkill".
I don't mean to be hard on the C.A.s. They did
an excellent job, and I liked mine a lot. It is the
overall composition of the job thatI have a quarrel
with. The function of Orientation, as it has trickled down tome, is to bond" a class through a series
of activites, games, etc". However, I think it is
rather pretentious to assume you can force people
to bond.
Bonding goes on late at night with ten people
eating pizza in a dorm room, not by falling backwards into the arms of ten people who know
nothing more of you than your name. I wish that
the acquaintance of our class had been left to its
own devices, that I could have met these people in
the mail room by accident.
There were a couple of shining moments for
me. The first Collection was great, and I had a
wonderful time. The campus tour was both productive and necessary, and to my surprise, I had a
lot of fun on the trust walk. However, the rest of
the time I was waffling between two distinct
thoughts: "Why am I here?" and "I wish I was
unpackingright now."
In the end, any positive aspects of the week
were eclipsed by the sheerhorror of the infamous
lap sit. Lap sits are great and I like them, but thirty
minutes of preparation to sit on a person's lap is
inarguably a complete waste of time.
No doubt I am nitpicking here; orientation is
over and there is no use in complaining about it
now. But I believe thatwhat theOrientationCommittee wished to achieve, namely school best
advice to those in our class who are lonely or
bored is to cram your whole hall into one double
at 2 A.M. and order Chinese. Love and trust will

he did manage to avoid taking stands on many

would have beennowhere at all; only the crankiest

You may call the New York Times stodgy
you may call it biased—you may even call it
Howard, (your columnist sometimes does) —but
you must also admit ithas a flair for the amusing
headline now and again. The frontpageof the late
editionofSunday, September 10, notably, yielded
this gem: "Powell Asserts 3rd Major Party May
Be Needed." Your columnist's mind naturally
started reconstructing some famous moments in
light of this new notion of "assert": Lincoln's "a
house divided
■gainst itself
probably
would not
stand,
but
then again
you never
know" and
MacArthur's
"I may return, but I don't want to commit myself
to anything at the moment" came to mind.
However, thereference in the headline turned
out to be rather fitting: the ever-so-daring candidate in question voiced such boat-rockers as "the
time may be at hand for a third major party" and
*1 do not unequivocally rule out a political fu*«are." Standard stuff frorn Colin Powell, who
jpends much ofhis time campaigning for the Bill
<ttlintonTry-To-Please-Everyone-At-OnceAward,
> but it occasioned a few thoughts on the nature of
third-party candidates in general and on Gen.
Powell in particular. Specifically: Powell's "candidacy" illustrates a few of the strengths of the
current two-party system, which forces cantidates
to take actual (gasp) positions on issues to define
themselves to the electorate, rather than simply
sliding by with a nice smile and some catchy
slogans.
Let us examine, by way of further illustration,
what exactly Gen. Powell tells us (or, at least,
what presumably noteworthy bits theTimes happened to recount). He describes himself as a
"fiscal conservative with a social conscience,"
which is a bit like calling yourself a lumberjack
who doesn't like cutting down trees. (Let's play
the Logical Extension Game: "I favor government
support for the oppressed minorities of America.
However, I don'tfavor spending any money on
them.") He states, "There are a lot of Republicans
who are somewhat silent and tend to be more in
die moderate. Rockefeller vein. In order to appeal
to the active wing of the party, most candidates
are ticking to the right." (Whoa. Where*d he find
ithat out?)
,

Sincerely yours,

Faith in Outsiders is Naive
Here's the scenario: an outsider shows up in a
tough public school or the U.S. government,
troubled places by any standard. He or she is not
your typical educator or world leader. In fact, the
person I'm talking about is almost definitely just
a regular man or woman. However, this person's
feats and skills on the job are anything but ordinary. They might include balancing the budget,
taking delinquents to gourmet restaurants, ending
wars and playing an excellent game of golf. And
have no doubt, by the time the story ends, this
humble newcomer will have succeeded where
"experts" or insiders have failed time and time
again.
In fact, therookies often succeed despite insiders, who are your typical bureacrats- selfish, greedy
types who defy logic, accept bribes, and are
reponsible for the violent deaths of teenage
protaganists.
This is the fantasy which has been enacted to
varying degrees in recent films ranging from
Dave to Dangerous Minds. The entertainment
value of the plot is understandable.We all like to
believe in the underdog who can fight corrupt or
simply stupid "systems." Yet, I believe this theme
also reflects a trend in U.S. politics and education
that is potentially harmful and short-sighted.
There has been a great deal of recent speculation over the plethora of potential independent
candidates for the 1996presidential election- Jesse
Jackson, Colin Powell, Ross Perot, Bill Bradley,
and Lowell Weicker are a few of the names that
have been tossed around by the media.
By contemplating independent campaigns, these
individuals are all considering positioning themselves outside of the two-party system- and removing themselves in the minds of voters from
the corruption and stagnation which have been
associated with current politics.
In education, school boards and mayors across
the country are also searching outside the system
for candidates to fill their district's top posts.
They often settle upon leaders who don't exactly
specialize in education. In Chicago the mayor
himself is the ultimate chiefof the city's schools.
Seattle has chosen an ex-army general. And in
New York, after well-publicized battles between
Mayor Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Ramon
Conines, Conines quit. Giulianiis currently pressuring the board to replace him with a CEO.

Those who read last week's Phoenix Editorial
may have noticed a theme regarding cycles and
beginnings, particularly since the Editorial was
littered with such words. Indeed, the idea of
embarking upon new beginnings may have been
apt for the first Editorialof the new schoolyear, as
the Phoenix started a new cycle with the first
edition of the 117th year of publication, while at
the same time itself setting off in many new
directions and new beginnings. We, the Editorial
Staff of the Phoenix, would therefore like to greet
the class of 1999, say welcome back to the
upperclasspeople, and introduce you, faithful
reader, to the new look that is the 1995 Phoenix.
The most obvious change wouldhave to be the
new paper size. Yes, after many years of tabloidsized paper, we're going Inquirer-style, with a
larger sized paper called broadsheet We hope
this will be a first step towards further growth in
the Phoenix, as it continues to turn into a first rate
collegiate newspaper.
But other changes are less readily apparent.
You may have noticed that the first page isn't
always necessarily for purely news -orienteditems
anymore. You can now find out how the football
team is doing, or perhaps what is going on with

that whole Dave Matthews mess, by checking thee
bottom of the front page.
Plus, you'll see a whole slew of new features
and columns in the weeks to come. Our weekly
official Opinion Poll takes the pulse of the campus, while Faculty Viewpoint, soon to become a
regular page four column, conveys what'* on the
minds of those who work to make us brilliant.
Plus, Features is now justplain wacky... check it
out for entertainment news, funny tidbits, and
other assorted randomness.
Even the Editorial, that stand-by of the Opinions page, has undergone serious changes. It now
speaks exclusively for the Phoenix Staff as a
whole; we'll tell you what is on our collective
minds, and we hope you reply with what is on
yours. Indeed, tell us how you feel about any of
our changes, or anything we write about... we're
biggernow, we can take the criticism, and it helps
us develop and create a better paper. For now,
however, we'd simply like to say hello and good
luck as we all embark upon new beginning* and
new cycles in the upcoming year.

However, after I had spent three years walking
over the sidewalkmessages, a parent forced me to
evaluate how I really feel about this particular
mode of communication. She asked me why the
words written on the sidewalk were so graphic. It
was a simple question, but I didn't really have a
good answer for her and I felt very much put on the
spot.

community for
about an hour as I leadvisitors aroundour campus,
and, at this moment, that fact was particularly
prominent in my mind.
So, you may be wondering, what did I tell the
concerned mother? Well, I hesitatedand muttered
something innocuous about diversity and getting
a message of awareness across to the student
body. I was acutely aware, though, of thefact that
I didn't really answer her question.
What that astute mother was asking me, and
whatI have been thinking about ever since, is why
activism on this campus tends to use shock value
as a means of educating. I am very proud of being
a member of a community that promotes activism
and am proud of all the organizations on campus
who seek to make us all aware.of the very real
problems in our society.
Thus, it is not activism itself that I question; it
is the means of presenting an activist message via
anonymous sidewalk chalk written in the middle
a tour

•represent the entire Swarthmore

of the night that I do not embrace.
If the purpose of activism is to promote awareness and tolerance of diverse opinions, then why
hidebehind offensive messages? I think that it is
important to be aware of the possible effect that
your words may have on this community, which
includes many people other than students.
Isn't it possible to inform without shocking?
Isn't there a way to educate without offending
some members of your community? Words on a
sidewalk fade away in time, but the impression
that they created does not.
I am not suggesting that anyone who has a
message to offer to allof us should be silenced, or
should not take advantage of the sidewalk chalk
opportunity. I am merely asking why it seems to
be necessary to shock people into receiving an
activist message.
In my opinion, this method of communicating
is akin to first yelling at a child for not cleaning up
her mess and, later, calmly asking her to do the
job.
I am curious; if the"calm asking" already been
done, has it fallen on deaf ears? Are we being
reprimanded into awareness because all other
measures have failed to promote tolerance, or
because "yelling" was the method of choice?
Perhaps if I knew the answers to these questions,
I wouldhavebeenbetter prepared for that mother's
question last week.

TOE JAM
Dave Matthews to
Play LPAC Next Week
by Charity Miller
Amid much controversy and speculation, Dave Matthews will perform for the
Swarthmore community on Sunday, September 24, 1995.

Charlie Mayer '9B has coordinated the
Student Activities
Committee. The idea of Dave Matthews
performing at Swat first arose in December 1994, when Mayer was producing a
piece on The Dave Matthews Band for
National Public Radio in Washington
D.C. Matthews commented that he
wanted to come to Swarthmore to play,
and gave Mayer his card. Matthews has
ties to Quakerism as well as the campus.
During his childhood, his parents were
friends with a member of the faculty and
he remembers riding his bike around the
area.
The Student Activities Committee is funding
the event with
money from
the overall
budget. The
total cost of
the show is
estimated be
well under ■
event along with the

$lO,OOO,

roughly half of what it cost to bring
Widespread Panic last semester.
Giovanna Giuliani '97, co-coordinator
of SAC, commented that Matthews is
doing S warthmore a favor by performing
for a relatively low cost.
Matt Minero '96, co-coordinator of
SAC, and Giuliani assure the Swarthmore community that this event will not
affect the weekly budget in any way. The
$7OO a week designated for parties will
remain unchanged. The speculation that
the cost would be high began last year
when the logistics were vague. An email was distributed to campus last
springto gauge student interest in the
event. The results of the poll were in
favorofMatthews' coming, roughly 65%35%, with about 1000 students responding. It is anticipated that the project will
end up being under-budgeL
There were no other performances
being considered when Mayer approached SAC with the ideaofMatthews'
appearance. SAC pursued the event because "it's unlike anything we've ever
had."Giuliani accepted the fact that criticism is inevitable, but that SAC decided

that it is in the best interest of the commu-

nity to accept Dave Matthews' offer to
perform.
Ideally, Matthews would be playing
outdoors in the amphitheater in order to
accomodate more people. However, the

technical problems associated with holding the concert outdoors, not to mention
the higher cost involved, eliminated this
option. SAC and Mayer both agreed that
the Lang Performing Arts Center is the
best alternate choice. The concert will be
limited to Swarthmore students and seating will be based on a first come, first
serve basis. You MUST have a ticket in
order to see the show.
On Sunday, September 17, at 8:00
a.m., tickets will be distributed at the
Lamb Miller Field
House. A student
must wait in line,
WITH 1.D., and will
then receive one
ticket for him or herself. This will be
done in an honest
effort to be fair to
everyone. If more
students want tick-

■

ets than there are
available seats in the

LPAC, closed circuit television will be set up inTarble and
Lang as necessary so thatall students can
watch the performance. Obviously this is
not the ideal situation; both SAC and
Charlie expressed regret about this system, but itis the best choice in regards to
cost and fairness to the whole community. The tickets will be general admission and seating will be first come, first
serve on the day of the performance. The
concert, which was originally scheduled
as an evening event, will be in the afternoon due to the arrival ofRosh Hashanah
that night. The day had been chosen by
Dave Matthews' staffbefore the realization of the holiday was made.
Dave Matthews will be performing
with Tim Reynolds, an acoustic guitarist
who has accompanied Matthews on his
albums. The other band members will
not be present because the band is not
currently touring and are therefore not
mobilized.
Once again, after much deliberation
and controversy, Dave Matthews will be
performing at the LPAC on Sunday, September 24..

Aftera short-lived hour of greasy

Pizza has won. Four local pizza
dives, Renato's, Alfredo's, Swat

judged by Phoenix staff for their
speed of delivery, price, and quality. In the cut-throat oligipoly over

Alfredo's emerged as the overall

is so special to me. Here's the scene: I
was on a summer program taking political science courses in Cambridge, England. For all of you who have been in
Cambridge during the summer, either on
tour or studying, you know that there are
no real British students there, just lots
and lotsof tourists and a bunch ofrandom
foreign students taking really easy summer courses (but they are still able to put
"Cambridge University" on their re-

sumes).
The point is, it's kind of boring and
there is no real, authentic British flavor to
the town. So, during the week, I searched

desparately for a way to pass my time. As
luck would have it, the Cambridge Film
Festival was in town. As my friends well

gloomy enough term to describe the feeling one gets from this film. It bit.
Therefore, it was with great trepidation that I agreed to go see the fifth and
final film of my Cambridge Film Festival, The Usual Suspects. But you know
what? I won't hold you in suspense: it
rocked. It was far and away the best film
I've seen in 1995, and it pretty much
validated the whole experience.
I can't go too much into this movie
without giving away it's complex and

for a line-up. Among them are fine Irish
actor Gabriel Byrne and the great character actor, Kevin Spacey (and I can't forget one of those Baldwin brothers,
Stephen). Any1 way, these five

IT'S LAMP LUNACY
by Justin Hall

This year Swarthmore "prohibits the
use of halogen lamps in dorm rooms." A
student at a nearby college flung her bed
linens over such a lamp, left, and "returned... to find her sheets and bed on
fire."
There are an enormous
amount of halogen lamps
in use around the country, disproportionately so
in college dormitories.
Swarthmore is no exception to this rule. Halogen
lamps provide an awesome amount of light for
a manageable price. Perfect for dorms, one such
floor lamp can illuminate
an entire room.
Surely preempting the
nationwide recall, Swarthmore would have us do
without these lights. In
my room in Worth, I was
provided with one table
lamp by the college, one
steel and plastic fifties
issue taole lamp shedding
just enough light to read

by, if you have it in your
lap.
IfI desire enough light
to prevent injury, I must
procure it myself. If I

am trusted to illuminate my own room,
I should be trusted with halogen lights.
Most Swatties I know do not hang bed
linens on lamps.
If the college would like to play it safe
by eliminating the Halogen Threat, they
shouldprovide adequate
alternative lighting. So
far the closest thing I've
seen are the flourescent
lights in Mertz.
Flourescent lights are
simply an abomination,
stress inducing hummers unfitfor human illumination. These lights
provide a new form of
torture comparable to
Chinese water torture.
What a perfect complement to the already

stressfulenvironmentof
the school.
Perhaps
ceiling
mounted halogen lights

you'd have to be a genius to hang your laundry on that, and then you
probably wouldn't want
to anyway.
Halogen lights or no,
it's time the school provided decent overhead
lighting.

Featured Organization of the Week
By Ben Maulbeck
Many organizations at S warthmore emphasize political issues, educate people,
provide support groups, and save the
world, but one group— called Vertigogo—is devoted to something often lacking at Swat: fun. Vertigo-go member
Jodi Sherman '97 describes the group:
"Vertigo-go is an improv comedy troup.
Performance-wise, our shows are sort of
a collectionof comedy games,muchakin
to the show on Comedy Central called
Whose Line Is It Anyway? Our shows
are basically 10 or 12 games where we
pull a lot of suggestions from the audience and thereby make funny things happen."
Those funny things start happening on
Friday, September 29, when the group
performs its first show of the year at
Mephisto's in Willets. The following
day, auditions will be held for all those
wishing to join the troup. Last year, three
members graduated and two are away for
the semester, so the current group consists of only seven members; Vertigo-go
needs fresh blood to fill in the gaps.
Auditions are very informal. Those auditioning simply play games with the old
troup members. The auditions themselves are fun, and Vertigo-go encourages anyone who's even thinking about
trying out to do so. There will be sign-up
sheet for allinterested on the dramaboard
before auditions.
Every show is a unique experience for
the players. Even they never know what
to expect. Without a script to work from,

tensionsrun high before performances—they all know anything can happen. The
only part of theshow that is at all planned
is the audience warm-up, an exercise for
which different parts of the audience
chant different words or sounds so as to
loosenup and getrelaxed. The rest of the
show is performed "without a net."
The audience interaction makes every
show different; there are so many possible combinations and ideas that the
same jokes are never repeated. Only the
format of the games remains the same.
The audience's role is critical: "If you
put us out there and there was no audience, we wouldhave nothing to do," says

pletely improv. Our rehearsing is a way
for the group to bond, and it's much
easier to do improv comedy when you
know the people and you can sort of
sense their comedy styles and their humor styles."
Rehearsals also give thechance to work
out other difficulties of improv. Greg
Posey '96, says, "One of the things we
actually practice is trying not to laugh.
That's the hardest theing for me. Especially if you're in the same scene, and
[you have to] to keep your w its about you
and keep going with the scene."
Does all this rehearsing make them
more witty? Notnecessarily. Greg Posey

As an important group on campus,
Vertigo-go's rehearsals have a special

DiFranco Performs at Bryn Mawr
Ani DiFranco performed at Bryn Mawr
She strummed, picked, and
downright ravaged thatpoor guitar as if it
were one of the scorned lovers that she
sings about in songs like "Not A Pretty
Girl," the title track of her latest album.
The label is Righteous Babe Records,
and you bet sheis. She filled thatcavelike
gymnasium with more sound than could
ever be contained on disc.
She certainly had help; drummer Andy
Stochansky, was as much a part of the act
as Ani was, if anyone cared to take their
eyes off of her. At one point, as Andy
went into an incredible bare-hands-slapping drumfest, she hid behind the speakers. The woman in front of me turned to
last night

her partner and mouthed, "Wait— he's
GOOD." The crowd was so hooked on
Ani's presence that they hooted when
she emerged from the speakers to admire
Andy's handiwork with that giant grin of
hers. She wasn't even DOING anything,
and they yelped I'venever seen anything
like it.
But I'd never seen Ani DiFranco in
concert before, either. Her voice is actually better in concert than on her albums.
Maybe that's because when you see her
live, you get to watch the play of emotions across her face as she sings and
talks about abortion, bisexuality, and
power to women. As thefirst set rounded
out, she was comfortablewith jokesabout
Bryn Mawr's name,"-- that's Welsh for
'high heels,' right?"

The highlight for many was when she
floated out the chords to "Both Hands,"
that staple of tri-college musical counterculture. She laughed as shemixedup the
verses, "Heh— I guess I'll just skip to the
breakup..." While much of her two set
playlist was from her new album, Ani
didn't hesitate to slam out some new
songs none of us had heard. It's reassuring to hear that she's as prolific as ever,
and the crowd bopped just as hard when
they didn't know the words.
We were all looking at her tour dates
on the way out, to find venues that might
be accessible over October Break: "I just
have to hear that new version of "The
Slant"again!"Onething'sforsure: Dave
Matthews will have to put on one hell of
a show to top Ani DiFranco's show.

Dodging Party Fees: At What
By Franklin Rubinstein
Yesterday, as fellow editor Emily
Willets and I walked through the halls of
Parrish, we came across an interesting
sign advertising a party at Olde Club this
Saturday. Itread"MakeaSplash...exotic
drinks and fermented ones too." When
asked, a few swimmers explained that
such careful wording was used becasue
the word "beer" cannot be written on
signs promoting an on-campus party.
Emily remarked to me, "I guess the College wouldrather that its students drink
fermented drinks... we're just too good
for plain old beer."
The sign went on to explain that if one
wears a swimsuit to the party, s/he will
gain free admission. I find this rather
insulting. Think about it; the objective of
this party is to raise money. If everyone
wears a swimsuit, then the swimming
team will certainly lose money. This
means that the swim team believes that

on balance, the average Swarthmore
party-goer fits into one or more of the
following categories: (1) S/he hates to go
shopping for swimsuits because it is de-

pressing (2) S/he knows better than to
slip into a Speedo among others who are
consuming fermentedbeverages (3) S/he
has moral problems about showing flesh
to save money (4) S/he is sexually starved
enough to pay two dollars to go see the
unaverage students get drunk in their
swimsuits.
I asked my roommate, who is on the
swim team, exactly why the swim team
was encouraging people to wear swimsuits to the party. He replied that, "We're
promoting pure hedonism. In fact, the
signs were supposed to say thatyou could
only get in for free if you wore a tight
Speedo." I later asked him what would
happen if someone simply stripped down
to a swimsuit atthe door, and later dressed
inside. He then explained the plan to
assign roving bouncers to enforce the

In the times before advanced technology, you couldn't turn a raptor into a
condor withouta willingness to go against
nature and a team of very dedicated ornithologists. However, this weekend, the
Swarthmore College Computer Society
(SCCS) will do just that
withoutruffling a single feather.
On September 17th, all 498
Swarthmore accounts currently
on the Raptor Unix server will
be moved to a bigger, faster
server called Condor. This
server, a Dec Alpha 3000/400
running OSF/1 sold to SCCS by
Physics Professor John Boccio,
runs "mucho rapido" than the
previous server, according to a
press release issued by system
administrator Adam Preset '96.
The Decstation 5000/200 known
as Raptor has been providing
473 students, twenty faculty
members, and five staff members with various Unix-based
Internet services since 1993.
Condor, like Raptor, will offer
electronic mail, access to
USENET news groups, Internet Relay
Chat, and Unix talk, among other services.
The change is necessary because of the
amount of use Raptor received during
last semester. "It got to be a bit of a
crisis," admits Matt Reed '96, another
system administrator and former treasurer of SCCS. The system administrators, or sysadmins, have been planning
for and working on theswitch since April.
There will be an interruption of service
while students' accounts, mail, and files
are copied from one machine to the other,
but it should be short. Reed said, "We're
hoping that by the end of Sunday, everyone will be able to long onto Condor."

SCCS President Sam Weiler '96 concurred: "With luck, the machines will
only be down for a few hours."
At some point this semester, the 93
student-runWorldWide Web pages will
return to Raptor. Explained sysadmin
Dan Eisenbud '9B, "We're planning to
install a new version of Ultrix, Raptor's
operating system, and reconfigure the
machine to serve mostly as a web server."

rules through wrist-checking. I suspect
that this will be one of the only times that
one Swattie is going to be able to approach another and orderhim/her to strip,
without fear of a lawsuit.
Emily remarked to me that she hoped
that other sports teams did not get any
bright ideas. "Next the lacrosse teams
will start throwingparties where they let
you in free if you wear your 'stick', and
the football team will waive their fee if
you wear your cup."
All jokes aside, it is refreshing to see
something new break up the Olde Club
monotony of stale beer and loud music.
While there are certainly less risky ways
of enhancing the scenery, I give the swim
team credit for creativity. Butlmustjoin
Emily in hoping that this trend does not
catch on withother groups. IftheSwarthmore Socialist Tree Huggers asks me to

Carl: Before we review this week's
flicks, I would like to first introduce the
new and exciting rating system Kate and
I will be using this semester. In order to
get more in touch with Swarthmore's
Quaker heritage I visited the Friend's
Historical Library to see how the Quakers of years' past rated visual performances. As you may have guessed it was
in terms of oats. Therefore, when either
of us feels a movie was poor, it will
receive "no oats". Just ok movies will get
"one to a few oats". Really good movies
will receive a rating of "a bowl of
oatmeal". And those films that we feel to
be truly outstanding will be rated as "a
whole bucket of oats!"
Kate: Since I get to go first on this one
(and I know Carl disagrees), I'm going to
start out by saying thatClerks is an awesome
movie. It

Once, when I asked a kid what type of
soft drink hewanted, hereplied, "cheese,"
and more than one fully grown adult
asked "how much is the free water?"
There is another aspect of Clerks that
meritsmentionhere: its facility for showcasing the cultural wonder that is southern New Jersey. It's like one big inside
joke for the Jersey folk. The humor is a
bit crude at times, and could easily be
considered offensive by those with more
sensitive ears, but it's always appropriate
to the dialogue and the scene, and is, in
my opinion, justified by the characters
and the situations. Overall, an extremely

unique and highly enjoyable movie.
Carl: Well, I agree it was unique. I
think my main problem with themovie is
that all my friends said, "It was sooo

Volleyball

By Jennifer Philpott
Another week passed for S warthmore' s
women ruggers, and they are one week
closer to their first game. The team has
been practicing hard, learning new skills
while trying to avoid the early injuries
that can sometimes occur before allof the
players perfect their skills.
In fact, the biggest obstacle for the
team's captains, Rebecca Cole '96 and
Kelly Shannon '96, has been the lack of
a reliable playing field. The team was
met by a huge yellow tent when they
went to check out Dupont Field for
Monday's practice. The tent was put up
a week early for the Scott Arboretum
Plant Sale which is scheduled for this
Saturday. So, the team had to find other
fields for space and remained flexible.

WEEK IN REVIEW
Several returning players are displaying impressive skills during this pre-season period, and there are also quite a few
'rookies' who are showing great potential. This week has been particularly
eventful as the new ruggers have learned
some of the game's more physical elements including how to tackle, ruck and
post theball. Starting Monday, the practice schedule will change as the team
shifts into high gear in preparation for
their first game at home on September

23. The new players will have to choPse
sides, in effect, by becoming either forwards or backs and being assigned to
positions by the captains.
The upcoming week will be an exciting one for the womens rugby team as
they build on the skills and fitness that
the players have been developing over
the past two weeks. Of course, rugby is
a club sport and the team always welcomes any interested Swat student v/ho
would like to give it a try.

Since the women's volleyball team
graduated six seniorslast year, itis inevitable that comparisons and contrasts will
be drawn between that veteran squad and
this season's youthful squad. For one, the
Garnet lost most of its size and will be
forced to rely more heavily on ball controland other skilled aspects of thegame.
After just completing a grueling first
week with three matches in two days, the
team still shows some off-season lustiness and tentativeness. After dropping
the first two games of the season Monday, the team rallied behind the leadership of co-captains Nancy Rosenbaum
'96 and Diana Bieber '96 to sweep the
final three games and take home the first
victory of the year against Cabrini, 3-15,
12-15,15-11, 15-10,15-13.
There are several areas, including serv
ing, in which the team hopes to pick up
from where it left at the end of last season. "Last year we led the Conference in
service aces. I intend to recapture that,"
said Coach Larry Perry.
Rosenbaum had a phenomenal match
againstCabrini andracked up impressive
statistics. She had 20 kills, 17 assists,
four solo blocks, and three aces. However, the 13receiving errors by the Garnet nearly cost them thematch. A receiving error is equivalent to a free point
because it does not allow a play to develop and eventually force theother team
to earn the point with a kill.
Serve reception can only get better in
the next couple of weeks for a number of
reasons. The team is currently struggling
to control free balls,- which are weak
returns by opponents, while it is digging
the harder hit balls. The talent and skill
are in place, and the consistency will
come with time.The Garnet will also be
bolstered by the return of Holly Barton
'99, out with a broken toe, in a couple of
weeks, and Laura Pitman '96 shortly
thereafter.
Meanwhile, injuries havemade Coach
Perry look at his bench and severalofhis
rookie players. Surprisingly, the player
with perhaps the most volleyball experience is the rookie, Deena Bahri '9B. She
is returning to the sport after years of
club-level competition. ChristinaCostasRussell '99 has established herself among

Ultimate Frisbee
By Jennifer Anderson
The Ultimate Frisbee teams began
their seasons with a bang this past weekend in games against long time rival,
Haverford.TheWar Mothers, led by captains Erika Baumgartner '9B and Lena
Loewenthal '97, suffered a close defeat
to Haverford in the game on Saturday.
They were not upset, however, for as
Baumgartner observed, "We saw a real
improvement in the way we were playing
together at the endof the game compared
with the beginning." The Swarming
Earthworms, led by captain Dave Lewis
'97, had a successful day as well. The
team used two separate forces to put
downHaverford. One, comprised mainly
of veterans, triumphed 13-8. The other
team, whose players were mostly rookies, lost 15-1. The teams then reconvened to beat Haverford again, thereby
bringing to a close a victorious day for
Swarthmore.
This season is filled with promise for
both the men's and women's Ultimate
teams. Sophomore Rob Eberhardt is
optimistic about the upcoming season.
"Swat Ultimate is gaining popularity and
the quality of the team is improving.
There are many freshmen whohave come
out. They are enthusiastic and have good
skills." Baumgartner also praised the
new players. "We'rereally excited about
the rookies. They are a great group of
people and have learned a lot already."
The men's team has the added advantage
that five ofits players participated in the
Philadelphia Area Disk Alliance summer league this summer, and improved
theirskills. Both the men's and women's
teams will be playing in a number of
tournaments this fall at various colleges
in the Mid-Atlantic region such as
Princeton, U Penn, Penn State, and
Rutgers. An UltimateFrisbee League is
also in the works for the fall season to
give the team a more organized schedule.

Houdini imitations, turning plays that
should have been stopped for little or no
gain into positive yardage, including a
big fourth down play where several defenders had a chance to tackle Thompson. After 17 plays, Earlham finally
scored, making the score 28-21. The
Hustlin' Quakers had one final chance at
tying or winning the game, but the Tide
defense stiffened and closed things out.
"We're looking for better intensity and
more consistency this week," said Burns.
"We could have scored more points, but
Earlham's long scoring drives gave their
defense a chance to catch a second wind."
Outstanding performances included
Nick Milligan (108 rushing yards, three
touchdowns), Frank Amar (106 rushing
yards), Frank Santora (13 tackles and a
spot on the conference honor roll), Jim
Hunt '96 (12 tackles), Matt Wiggins
(blocked a field goal and an interception), and JasonStraub (5 catches). Tomorrow night, the Garnet Tide opens
their 1995Centennial Conference schedule at Johns Hopkins. The Tide hasn't
won on the fake grass of Homewood
Field since 1989, and the Blue Jays own
a four game winning streak against Swat.
Hopkins is currently 0-1 after losing Friday night in the final seconds 20-17 to

Men's Soccer
By Dan Malkoun

Last Friday the Garnet-clad soldiers
of the men's soccer team loaded up the
vans and headed north to Elizabethtown
to square off against some tough
nonconference competition from
Elizabethtown's perennial soccer force
in a four-team tournament. However, the
Swarthmore team never got to clank
swords with the powerful Elizabethtown
team due to a first round loss against
Salem State.
The Swarthrhore team did, however,
come away with a somewhat redeeming
consolation win on Saturday against
Stevens Tech to finish the trip on an
upbeat note and improve their record to
3-1.
In Swarthmore's first round match
against Salem State on Friday, the Tide
fell behind early as what was described
as a "sleepy" Swat defense gave up a
header off a corner kick only five minutes into the game. After a slow and
uneventful first half, Salem State came
out firing again in the second half and
extended their lead to 2-0, putting the
Garnet away for good.
The next day the team squared off
against Stevens Tech in the consolation
game of the tourney looking for, coincidentally, some consolation for Friday's
poor effort. Whileit might be said that no
one showed up to play on Friday, it should
be noted that senior striker Len Cuello
'96 came to play in a big way the next day
as he erupted for three first half goals and
a natural hat-trick to lead the Garnet to a
4-1 triumph over Stevens.
With a nearly spotless record after the
weekend, the soccer team travelled to
Albright College Wednesday to play a
team they had stomped on at home last
year by a score of 7-0. Amber Thompson
'97, who noted that the playing condi-

tions of the Albright field were less than
adequate, started the scoring for Swat
with a first-half goal. However, more
sloppy play by the Garnet team on a
sloppy field led to an Albright goal which
evened the scoring at 1-1 going into the
half.
The fired-up Tide came out on a mission, though, in the second half and shut
down Albright while adding two more
goals to seal the gameand win 3-1. Citing the conditions as the reason for the
narrow margin of victory, Thompson
added, "The field conditions were very
bad which worked to their advantage
because it was extremely difficultfor us
to finish plays down at their end."
With their record gleaming of success
at 4-1, the Garnethave pulled outto a fast

what promises to be a competitive and
entertaining match.

athletics. Lester is inclined to agree.

three years ago, he thought that he mightplay a littleoffense and defense,
but never in his wildest dreams could he imagine the scenario he was
thrust into last Saturday. Milligan plowed through Earlham's defense,
gaining 108yards and scoring three touchdowns. Milligan also played
much of the second half on defense, making several key tackles and
pressuring Earlham's quarterback all afternoon, inspite of the oppressive humidity. For his efforts, Milligan was named Centennial Conference Offensive Player of theWeekand he is our male athlete of theweek.

Kelly Wilcox began her hockey career as a defensive player, then
moved to the mid-field, and is now wearing a completely different
uniform and standing in the goal cage for Swarthmore's field hockey
team. Kelly is an amazing athlete whose willing attitude has prompted
Coach Richard Kentwell to play her in many different positions. She is
playing goalie in her third season of collegiate hockey a position that
she hadn't played since high school and that she hoped never to play
again. However, Kelly has been performing very well in her new
position and has given a lot of herself to her team. Kelly also plays
lacrosse in the spring with equal success.
