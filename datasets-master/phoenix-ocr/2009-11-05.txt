'What is the What' co-author Borough seeks input

The Swarthmore Borough is
looking for student involvement

Valentino Deng, co-author and subject of "What is the What," speaks in Science Center 199.

BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Valentino Deng had been
forced from his village, his country and even the Ethiopian
refugee camp where he took
shelter by the time he was old
enough to attend college. A
native of Sudan, he is one of the
"Lost Boys" who lost his childhood to the civil war that
occurred in the late 1980s and
early 19905.
Today, he is a lecturer and coauthor with Dave Eggers of
"What is the What," which is
Deng's
autobiography.
On
Monday, he spoke to a group of
students and faculty in Science
Center 199.
Born in Sudan, Deng became
a child refugee when his country's civil war destroyed his village. Today, he is an activist for
universal rights to education
and has started the first secondary school in his childhood
home.
The war that would bring
Deng to a refugee camp, and
later to the United States, was
fought between rebels and the
government, who employed the
same militia group that currently terrorizes Darfur. The militia
killed men, abducted and raped
women, burned villages and
committed "aH kinds of human
rights abuses." Deng was one of
thousands who were displaced
when his village was attacked in
1986. .
He latched onto one of the
groups of people leaving the
wreckage and traveled by foot
without shoes for four months
until he arrived at a refugee
camp in Ethiopia. The journey
to the camp was extremely difficult and many people died from

THE PHOENIX

starvation. Often the refugees
were not even able to bury their
friends and relatives because
they needed to hurry to safety.
Once they reached Ethiopia,
Deng and the other children
were able to attend school.
Initially, it was a very rudimentary program, with high school
and university students teaching younger children without
even the use of chalkboards.
Soon, though, the U.N. brought
in enough pencils and exercise
books that the children were
able to share them with only one
other person.
"We became children, and I
was a happy boy," Deng said.
Because of the terrible reports of
Sudan he heard from recent
arrivals to the camp, he did not
have any desire to return home.
After a few years, the
Ethiopian government was overthrown and the refugees were
forced out of the camp at gunpoint. When Deng relocated to
northern Kenya in 1992 he was
able to become a peer counselor
and youth leader whose clients
included children of the
Rwandan genocide. In late
September 2001, he moved to the
United States through the Lost
Boys Foundation, a program to
help children whose lives were
disrupted by the Sudanese war
to achieve stability in America.
Deng attended Allegheny
College, where he contacted
Eggers to write his autobiography. In the writing process, he
reunited with his family members, most of whom survived the
war.
Currently, he uses the proceeds from the book, as well as
private donations, to help his
former village by building the
region's first high school, the

Marial Bai Secondary School.
Because of the number of people
who apply, the school is selective, using an entrance exam to
choose students. All instructions
are in English. When the first
class graduates, Deng hopes that
they will send many students
abroad to universities all over
the world.
"Maybe some will go on to
local teacher training colleges
and return to help the high
school," Deng said.
Though the overwhelming
culture of the region does not
value education for girls, the
school is co-educational, he said.
"Next year we hope to have at
least half of the students be
female," Deng said.
He said that he plans to build
dormitories for female students
so that they won't have to live at
home, where they are expected
to do laundry, take care of
younger siblings and prepare
meals on top of schoolwork.
Male students who live far from
school currently board with
local families, but Deng said that
dorms will be built for them, too.
The talk was hosted by the
English department, the history
department, the peace and conflict studies program and the
political science department.
There was also a grant from the
Forum for Free Speech.
"It was very interesting to
hear him speak because it's very
rare to have an opportunity to
hear an actual refugee speak
instead of hearing it secondhand, like from a documentary
or a book," Matthew Heck 'l3
said.
Other students mentioned
that although parts of it were
emotionally harrowing, the lecture was overall very uplifting.

Task Force.
On Sunday, the Swarthmore
Borough Council appointed
Hannah Jones 'l2 to the task
force. The Borough also contacted other members of Earthlust
to ask for participation.
The task force will research
ways to make the town more
bicycle and pedestrian friendly
and make suggestions for
improvements to current infrastructure to the Borough
Council. The task force will consist of nine members coming
from both the college community and the town. Meetings will
be open to the public.
Zein Nakhoda 'l2, a member
of Earthlust who was invited to
work on the task force,
expressed his support for the
idea of a task force and its implications for the environment. He
stressed that student participation in the task force will be
important.

"The idea of expanding bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure would be nice in encouraging that kind of transportation
over cars," Nakhoda said.
"They are looking for student
involvement. It is important to
put out there that they are looking for a student voice."
Borough
Swarthmore
Council member Ralph Jacobs
said that he hopes that the task
force will work with a range of
community organizations such
as the police, schools, and the
college to properly represent
the interests of all town members.
Jacobs puts special emphasis
on the importance of the
Pedestrian and Bicycle Task
Force for the town's senior citizens, college students, families
with children, and recreational
bicyclists.
Ben DeGolia 'll, a frequent
bicyclist, is enthusiastic about a
possible task force to increase
the safety of biking pathways.

"The task force seems like a
great idea," DeGolia said. "At
the very least, the Borough will
have an opportunity to evaluate
the conditions of its roadways
and sidewalks. I don't really
I
know what they'll find out
haven't experienced many problems, but I also haven't been
here long.
"Also, it appears that they'll
be looking for opportunities to
create or expand on existing
groups, programs and education. I'd be interested to know
what the proposed projects are."
Jacobs stresses the increas-

ing importance of non-motor
transportation. He points to an
example
of infrastructure
change in Philadelphia, where

one lane of each of the two

major east-west streets was
closed to make room for biking

lanes.
Jacobs also spoke of potential programs that will encourage groups of young students to
bike to school together with a
parental volunteer. While these
are just a few of his ideas,
Jacobs said that the task force
will also study programs implemented in other communities
and could be
tried in
Swarthmore.
Jacobs said that the borough
will be very receptive to suggestions from the college community

"I know that there are a
number of groups that are interested in doing things like planning bike routes, arranging for
connectivity among bike routes,
and educating people to their
availability,"
Jacobs said.
"Bike routes are only one of the
many issues that the task force
will look at. Maybe there is a
need for more bike racks. I
haven't studied the issue. But
that gives you an example of
some of the things the task force
will be working with."
Providing safer services for
pedestrians and bicyclists is
becoming
increasingly
an
important issue for the borough
as more people are choosing to
take alternative forms of transportation. Jacobs attributes this
increase to many issues.
"Non-motor transportation
is a real quality of life issue,"
Jacobs said. "Whether people
do it for the health issues or
enjoy the aesthetics of walking
or bicycling or they think it is
green and environmentally conscious, or all of the reasons
above.
"I think that there are a lot of
people who think it is important
to promote, to the extent that
you can, bicycle and pedestrian
transportation."

Jacobs makes the point that
the task force is not a response
to any particular incident in the
borough.

"The impetus for the task
force was to have a broad look
at many issues," Jacobs said.
"The task force was not created

to respond to any particular
incident or to address a particular problem.

"Bicycle and pedestrian traffic is a good thing. It is something that should be encouraged
and it is on the increase. It
improves the quality of life and
is environmentally friendly.
There are a lot of reasons why
the borough should look at it
systemically."

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS

SFAP and administrators

discuss impending cuts

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

Members of Vertigo-go perform improv and sketch comedy for their Halloween
show last Saturday in SCI 101

The Student Financial Advisory Panel
a body formed to complement the Ad
Hoc Financial Planning Group met with
members of the administration on Friday
to talk about budget cuts.
They talked to Dean of Admissions Jim
Bock, acting Dean of Students Dean
Campbell and Tracy Thompson of human
resources. The admissions cuts are confidential, so they were not discussed at the
Student Council meeting. The other budget
cuts are public and are available online.
Human resources is considering several measures to reduce its budget. SFAP was
presented with the options the Faculty
Staff Benefits Committee is debating. The
benefits are the same for every position in
the college. They vary, however, depending
on the family situation of the beneficiary.
The single beneficiaries have a cheaper
plan, but they are compensated from a benefit bank. The committee is choosing
between just reducing the benefit bank, or,
in addition to restructuring the entire
health plan, reducing the tuition credit
that faculty and staff have by a small percentage. StuCo members said the committee seems to be slightly inrfavor of the

restructuring option.
Students are not a part of the decision
process. However, StuCo members want
the student body to have the possibility of
discussing human resources issues with
Campbell or Bock. StuCo will be organizing a town-hall style session. SFAP would
provide background information about
budget cut proposals.

last week.

Textbook update
StuCo still has to decide what to do with
a $lO,OOO grant for textbooks. Several ideas
have been put forth, including textbook
rental and purchasing an e-book printer.
The e-book printer costs $40,000, so "no
one is even considering buying it," as
StuCo President Rachel Bell 'lO said.
It is hard to assess if it would be efficient, taking into consideration the additional cost of e-books. The librarians are
considering the college's participation in a
consortium, perhaps bigger than Tri-Co,
maybe including the University of
Pennsylvania, to buy one.
A suggestion made by Dan Symonds 'IL
StuCo financial policy representative, considered subsidizing art supplies.
"Given that some students do struggle
with the costs associated with such art
courses, the art department maybe [can]
sell student work at the end of each semester and then redirect those funds towards
subsidization of new supplies for future
students," Bell said.
Stephan Lefebvre 'll, council secretary,
is going to look into this proposition.
Elections

Jacqueline Bailey-Ross 'l2, StuCo
appointments chair, talked about election
promotion strategies, which might include
making a video, chalking and a Paces Cafe
takeover with sessions involving members
whose positions are up for election. The

elections will be

StuCo members were pleased to hear
from Symonds that there was a considerable interest in running for StuCo among
students. The timetable was discussed.
The positions up for election will be
announced on Nov. 19. Students will have
until Nov. 29 to submit their platforms. The
election date is to be determined, "but

November 5, 2009

probably will begin the next weekend,"
Bell said, referring to the weekend of
Friday, Dec. 4 through Sunday, Dec. 6.

Bike update
StuCo is planning to launch a bike
share pilot program.
Student Events Advisor Angela Meng
'l2 gave other members of StuCo an update
on the bike front. Lindsay Yanez of
Swarthmore Cycles gave StuCo an offer of
ten bikes for around $l,OOO. Instead of
painting the bikes a bright color to distinguish them from other bikes and prevent
them from being stolen, Yanez proposed
that the bikes should have "Swat" stenciled on them.
StuCo is also thinking of what to do
about a lock system. One of the suggestions
is to change the lock codes every two
weeks or so and inform the students of the
change. "Like in Dumbledore's office!"
Bailey-Ross said.
StuCo is searching for funds for the
project. An alumnus pledged $5OO.
There are several more issues concerning the bike program. One of them is how
to finance the maintenance, which should
be done every four or five months, as
Lindsay suggested. Meng added that there
is the problem of whatkind of bikes to get
in order to accommodate "the short and
the tall." Meng also mentioned other ways
of acquiring bikes, for instance taking
some of the bikes that have been in front of
Willets for a long time.
StuCo is planning to put the bikes in
five designated places around campus. The
launch date of the program is to be determined. They will be looking for institutional support from the dean's or president's office.
Miscellaneous
StuCo is planning another pilot program: a weekly shuttle to Media. The shuttle would probably run on Fridays from 5
p.m. to 9 p.m. The proposal for the program
will be made for this semester, to see how
it works out.
Meng raised the issue of committee
transparency. One of her friends, Arthur
Chyan 'lO, mentioned that he would like to
get an update from the committees each
semester.

"For more transparency and accounta-

bility, perhaps a simple e-mail towards the
beginning of the semester outlining what
is going to be worked on by the committee
in addition to an "e-mail at the end of the
semester detailing what has happened
would help educate students on what these
committees are doing," Chyan told The

Phoenix. The committees that he would
like to hear from are, among others, the
Equal Opportunity Advisory Committee,
the Social Responsibility Committee and
the Council on Educational Policy.
"It's a fantastic and simple [to implement] idea," Symonds said.
Simon Zhu 11, manager of the Student
Budget Committee, came in to discuss the
expansion in the Movie Committee and
changes in the Student Activities Fee use
and purview concerning non-chartered
student groups. Since there are many proposals from students about bringing various bands to campus, the Movie
Committee could be transformed into a
"Movie and Music
Committee" or
"Entertainment Committee."

Eight students arrested in Phila. Blue Cross sit-in

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Eight Swarthmore students and one

alumna were arrested Friday after holding

a sit-in at the entrance to the Independence
Blue Cross headquarters in Philadelphia.
Their non-violent direct action was aimed
at pressuring the non-profit health insurer
to support a single-payer healthcare system.

"Before now there haven't been direct
actions for universal single-payer health
care," said Markus Schlotterbeck 'lO, one
of the students who spent 17 hours in jail.
"There's been a lot of lobbying, which is
necessary, but lobbying without direct
action, without real popular pressure, isn't
as effective."
The other students who were arrested
are Dan Symonds 'll, Dermot Delude-Dix
10, Nat Sufrin 'll Anna Grant 'lO, Elowyn
Corby 'l3, Dani Noble 'l2 and Hannah
Jones 'l2. Alum Shandra Bernath-Plaisted
'O9 joined them.
These students are members of the
Student Health Action Network, a local
organization formed last spring with only
two chapters, one in Philadelphia and one
at Swarthmore College. They were joined
by members of two other national campaigns: Mobilization for Healthcare for All
Philadelphia and Healthcare-NOW!
These groups are all advocating for single-payer healthcare, a single government
or government-related organization that
collects all insurance fees and then pays for
all medical services. Medicare provides
insurance coverage to the elderly in this
manner.
Those risking arrest originally planned
to go inside the headquarters, ask to meet
CEO Joseph Frick or whomever would talk
to them, read their demands, and refuse to
leave until they were met. Other protesters
planned on holding a rally behind them.
But the action was not a secret. Blue
Cross expected tne protesters and shut
down the offices to non-employees for the
day. Those risking arrest marched towards
the headquarters and found the door.
The head of security said he was there
on behalf of the CEO and wouldn't let the
group meet with any high-level members
of the company. The group risking arrest
sat down facing outward, planning to stay
until someone came to meet with them.
They were told they would have three
warnings.
Schlotterbeck read the protesters' three
demands through a megaphone.
First, they wanted Independence Blue
Cross to approve all doctor-ordered care
and procedures. Second, they demanded
that Blue Cross stop funding advocacy

THE PHOENIX

against reform through their insurance
premium income. For example, they currently fund gethealthreformright.org, a
group that claims to push for reform but is
against a public option and a single-payer
system. Finally, they want Blue Cross to
come out in support of a single-payer
health plan.
"We weren't sitting down to sit down;
we were sitting down for our demands,"

Schlotterbeck said.

Schlotterbeck
read online about
Mobilization for Healthcare for All calling
for sit-ins and signed his group up for participating. Schlotterbeck met Jeffery
Muckenstrum, one of the staff members at
Healthcare-NOW!
at a meeting
in
Philadelphia and the two decided their
groups should join forces for this demonstration.
explained
Muckenstrum
that
Healthcare-NOW! is involved in various
direct action projects to promote single-

payer healthcare. Every year they cele-

brate Medicare's birthday by bringing
birthday cakes to the office of their congressperson. In addition, they hold rallies
in D.C., general single-payer education
events, rallies at private health insurance
offices and an annual vigil for people who
died because they didn't have insurance.
"Healthcare-NOW! does a lot of lobbying
but we haven't gotten anywhere because
we don't have the kind of money that insurance companies have," Muckenstrum said.
"It's impossible for us to compete in the
lobbying sphere because we just don'thave
the money."
And that lobbying sphere is making
Healthcare-NOW!'s situation all the more
difficult.
"The insurance companies are lobbying
against real healthcare reform," said
Bernath-Plaisted, who is still working with

human health isn't there, then what good
is fighting for these other issues? It just
gets down to the human rights aspect."
Mukenstrum was happy that so many
people, especially the Swarthmore students, were able to come together for this

movement.

"It was really good to see college students caring about healthcare. In our
group there aren't many young people. I'm
usually the youngest and I'm 31,"
Muckenstrum said. "It's pretty brave."
Mukenstrum added that being in jail
with young people was a new experience
for him.
"It wasn't my first time [in jail], but the
group of people, especially being with all
the students, was a lot more positive than
some of the other times I've done it," he
said.
It was the students' first time in jail.
The activists were held in the roundhouse
on 9th and Race with everyone else that
was arrested that day.
"It was a sobering place to be,"
Schlotterbeck said. "We needed to be
respectful of being in jail because most people weren't there by choice."
"I was very aware of how my position
was different from the position of a lot of

these lifelines."
The group was charged with one count
of obstructing a highway, which includes

sidewalks. The charge was dropped in
court on Monday on the condition that
none of the activists are arrested again
within the next two months.
Activists chose to target Blue Cross
because ofits status as a non-profit.
"They're an interesting case because
they're non-profit," Scholetterbeck said.

"When we talk about healthcare a lot of
times we talk about for-profit healthcare,
but a lot of those same practices exist for
Blue Cross. They're non-profit but they
still need to use the same strategies profitcompanies use to break even. A non-profit
organization is theoretically in it for
healthcare, not for their own ends."
Blue Cross was the target of one of the
group's previous actions. On August 19
SHAN set up its own health insurance
company in front of Blue Cross called
Efficicare. In what the group called a "sarcastic action," the company offered 100%
efficient service and free rejections for
everyone.

In the future the group plans to continue with direct action.

Sri Lankan novelist tells a story of the civil war
BY LINDA HOU

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan never
intended to become the spokesperson for
20 million Sri Lankans, not counting the
millions who left the country as part of the
Sri Lankan diaspora. Yet with the publication of her new novel, she has been asked
to fill that role in her lectures throughout
the United States.
"I
wrote a work of fiction,"
Ganeshananthan said. "While it makes
sense because people are interested in the
Sri Lankan diaspora, I think it's very
interesting for me to be put in the position
of a spokesperson because
that devalues therest of my community who are perfectly capable of speaking for themselves."
Ganeshananthan was invited to give a
reading and lecture Friday on her first
book "Love Marriage." Her novel explores
the themes of family and war through the
tale of a Sri Lankan family spread all over
the globe because of the Sri Lankan Civil
War. The book was named Best of 2008 by
the Washington Post and was long-listed
for the Orange Prize.
Following a reading of the book,
Ganeshananthan spoke of the history of
the Sri Lankan Civil War and its effects.
Deshi board member Ramya Gopal 'lO
invited Ganeshananthan to speak at the
...

college.

"I asked her to talk abouther book and
about
as she was researching for the
novel, what did she learn about the Sri
Lankan war ... and the intersection of how
...

fiction kind of works to tell the stories of sized that her work isn't meant to be reac

In bed, beware: You can't always trust intuition
swarthmorephoenix.com

Last week I gave you a
list of sexual 'Dos,' and far
be it for me to know whether
anyone is either daring or
naive enough to take my
advice (or read my column
for that matter). But I figured that since the 'Don'ts'

section of this discussion
was blatantly missing, it
would not only fill up some

I
-—-

Amber Wantman
Sex and the Bubble

'

space in the 700-900 word
requirement, but would also
provide some advice that
requires less effort to follow.
All the reader need do is
observe the following list,

and in doing so, stay away from the awesomely bad shortcuts that might be tempting in theory, but go terribly awry
in realization.

Observe:
DO NOT have sex to music unless it is something that
you can tune out. A song with a really prominent beat can be
more distracting than the pleasure you're feeling. What's
worse, you can find yourself bobbing up and down in
rhythm with the beat, and after a couple seconds, when you
both realize you're in unison with the synthesizer, it just
becomes awkward. You might find yourself purposefully
ignoring the beat, but then the arrhythmia makes you feel
like you're doing the Soldier Boy to Norah Jones.
Music can be great to drown out the noise in a dorm with
paper-thin walls, butbe aware that it can take your attention
away from the task at hand. And it's really much more fun

to be focused on the task at hand
Two years ago, my boyfriend lived in an apartment with
roommates, and would always put on Radiohead or Brand
New when we were about to get down to it. When Jesse
Lacey would go on a screaming rampage, it was definitely
excessive, but most of the music was mellow enough to tune
out and provide some background noise. As far as successful
songs go, Radiohead's Idioteque actually became my favorite
song of the season. Just be careful not to put your iPod on
shuffle unless you know the playlist well. The Ying Yang
Twins' "Whisper Song" might come on unexpectedly and
deflate your libido.
DO NOT use your hands or mouth without knowing what
you're doing. People weren't born with great head skills, so
before you give out your first favor or two, get an anatomy
lesson online. If you have any close friends with a lot of experience, ask for a tutorial. Honestly, the initial shame will
save you an uncomfortable experience down the line, and if
you go about askingright, it willprobably be a hilarious con-

versation.

Literally, all one needs to do is Google "hand job," and
thousands ofresults pop up that will teach you, for free, how
to give a fabulous hand job! (Technology is a marvel, isn't it?)
Seriously, hundreds upon hundreds of websites are just
waiting to teach you techniques like "The Washing
Machine," "The Pancake," or "Milking the Bull." Even if you
think you've got your shit down, check it out for fun. It's
never a bad idea to learn more.
There is nothing worse than receiving a shoddy job of
any kind, and having to either coach your partner into doing
it right, tacitly tolerate the pain/discomfort or pretend like

you're actually enjoying it. I take that back. It's equally horrible for the giver, or shall we say, the star of this perform-

ance. Trying to dish out oral or manual pleasure without a
roadmap is like starring in a play without having seen the
script. Improvising Romeo would ruin a classic, just as
winging it in the bedroom will devastate the opportunity for
potentially mind-blowing foreplay. Not only will you leave
your partner unsatisfied, but you will also leave the experience feeling like all of your inadequacies have been exposed.

Not a self-esteem booster.
Which brings me to my next point: if it's not a one-night
stand and you're not having fun, DO NOT fake it! Pretending
like you're feeling pleasure will only make it worse for you
next time. Have you ever heard of "Fake it til you make it?"
Throw it out; it doesn't apply.
Anyone who's taken Psych 101 knows that praise is a
form of positive reinforcement, and if you want your partner
to keep on doing what he/she is doing, then by all means,
"ooh" and "ahhh" your heart out. Otherwise, praise only
reinforces bad behavior. You're an adult with a mouth; talk
to your partner! Keeping silent might not reinforce the
behavior, but it will take a lot longer for your partner to
learn without any direction. You are your own best barometer; tell him/her what you want more/less of. You know best
what you like, and you're a Swarthmore brainiac. For God's
sake (or your own goddamn sake), grow some balls and stop
wasting time.
And so I conclude the two-parter of Dos and Don'ts. It's
been fun, this conversation between you and me, but more
importantly, it's been didactic (I can only hope). For any further questions, suggestions, hate-mail or friendly heckling,
you know where to find me.

During orientation, the Sarah Lawrence
at Oxford program director, Deborah, made
a point of telling us that the way British students approach drinking is very different
from what we, as Americans, might be used
to. With a drinking age of 18, university students presumably have worked out their
youthful indiscretions with regards to
alcohol by the time they arrive on campus, and as it was put to
us, "Brits enjoy alcohol. They don't drink
to get drunk." And,

friend of mine. British students, it turns out,
are exactly the same brand of sloppy
drinkers as Americans. The only difference
is that in the U.K., you have to pay a pretty
significant amount of money for the privilege of drinking mediocre alcohol, whereas
you get it for free at Paces with a Tri-Co ID.
(In Fliss's defense, she did inter-college
mail my friend a bracelet as a token of apology the next day, but honestly, I don't know
if even an infinite quantity of kitschy homemade jewelry could make me get over being

one, being an Oxford student means you

Americans. Instead, a party is known as a
"bop," a word that is as uncomfortable to say
in public as it is to read.
Moreover, these bops all have exceedingly complicated premises that require
not
just suggest, but actually require
"fancy
dress," a British phrase that, improbably,
translates to 'tiress like a complete and utter
fool in accordance with an ill-conceived
theme developed by the party organizers to
make people unhappy."
Bop themes thus far this term have
included "back to school" (I'm embarrassed
to admit that I dressed as a schoolboy having
an affair with his teacher; I've never felt so
dirty in my life) and "the London
Underground," while some more 'colorful
examples from previous years include "golf
pros and tennis hos" (I swear I'm not making

this up) and "P is f0r..." a theme that leaves
open such exciting avenues for costumes as
"porn star," "Presbyterian" and "pumpkin."
And all this takes place while writing two
2000-plus word essays per week, attending
lectures, eating, sleeping and trying to maintain some semblance of hygiene using
British showers that alternate at will
between scalding hot and unbearably cold.
It's amazing that Oxford students don't
explode from the excitement of it all. At
Swarthmore, it seems like the operating philosophy is "work hard, party harder."
Spending days locked in McCabe's basement
can be rationalized by the anticipation of
screaming a drink order at a surly Deshi
member tending bar and getting stuck to the
floor in Paces. At Oxford, the hard work is
there, as is the drinking, yet when it comes
to the primal gratification of partying, at
least for now, it's all just a bit too weird.

Where he likes to shop:
"I shop at a lot of places: Urban
Outfitters, H&M, sneaker boutiques and
Nordstrom," Anderson said, though he
pointed out that there are not specific
places he always shops. "If I find something that I like and I see a store that looks
interesting then I go in," he said. "I don't
wear anything that I don't really like and I
don't buy anything if it doesn't inspire me
or if I know I can't use it."

What he's wearing:
"This cardigan is from American Apparel," Anderson
said. His pants, tie and shirt are all from H&M. "My watch
is Michael Kors. My shoes are from Creative Recreation
and my glasses are Marc Jacobs." He said that his skateboard is not an accessory and that he puts it to good use.
The color combination is especially striking in
Anderson's outfit. "I like color and I like contrast," he
said. The light blue oxford shirt and tie contrast greatly
with the charcoal cardigan, while the gold of the sneakers
and watch works well with the black of the pants. The
blue, black and gold palette makes for a cool mixture of
colors. The sneakers, which are one of his favorite pairs,
create a distinct look, forming an outfit that brings together the American Apparel male model style with a dash of

Advice for stepping up one's style:
Anderson, when asked how his style compares to how most guys dress at Swarthmore,
said he felt "superior." He advises that guys,
but really both genders, should "start wearing
clothes that fit you ... and wearing clothes that
match"your body type."" All the bros out there
should "avoid wearing your athletic gear everywhere."

How he describes his style:

Though Anderson laughed and mentioned that his
first thought was to say "bailer," he described his style as
a "really interesting mix of a lot of things because I switch
it up a lot," combining urban and fresh and clean. "I don't
like to look overdone, but I like to have a certain amount
of complexity," Anderson said.

to "know what you like, because when you find
something that you really like, it looks good."
Even if your style may range from grunge to
crazy colors, Anderson said you should "find

Fashion influences:
"My three style icons are Kanye West, Pharrell and
Lupe Fiasco," Anderson said. All three of these artists
have styles similar to Anderson's, especially Kanye and
Pharrell. Their mix of sophistication, color and hip-hop

Trio Ivoire plays music with transcontinental keys

Jake Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

Jake Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

In a quiet moment, Hans Ludemann gathers his thoughts before playing the piano.

Trio Ivoire unleashes a creative and original performance based on collaboration.

"[Trio Ivoire] is a very fresh, inventive and very together group [with] nice

accessible music," French lecturerCarole Metier said.
Sharing an affinity for improvisation, jazz is the Trio's musical playground. "It is the biggest treat to invent
music for fun," Hans Ludemann,
founder of Trio Ivoire. said. "[With jazz]
we can play our own ideas, and we have
the freedom to make our own musical
decisions. You are liberated by music."
The three band members are each
representatives of a unique worldview
of music. Pianist and composer
Ludemann feels just as at home with
traditional African music as he does
with European musical classicism and
the American jazz tradition. Aly Keita,
a contemporary "griot" from Cote
d'lvoire, plays the African instruments
balaphon and sanza in the traditional
story-telling style, with subtle overtones of modern jazz. Drummer

THE PHOENIX

...

No matter what they played, however, it was clear that the band members
were enjoying themselves. Keita kept
grinning
mischievously
while
Liidemann and Sardjoe reciprocated
with sly smiles of their own as if sharing a little-known secret.
"They obviously enjoy being together," Adriana Popa 'l2, a classical music
enthusiast, said. "It is easy to see that
their creative force derives not only
from a love of music, but also from a
love of each other as contributors to a
unique artistic process."

s

musical traditions and cultures.
"[Trio Ivoire] could be a model of
today's reality
the musical image and
face of globalization," Ludemann added.
"There is a broad horizon in our music.
It's about opening up completely, and
not following traditions or cliches."
:Lang Concert Hall was packed with a
sizeable turn-out, a pleasantly surprising balance between adults and college
students. When Trio Ivoire finally burst
through the doors, they were met with a
near-deafening roar of applause and
whistles from the crowd.
Heading the night's line-up was
"Turning Points," Trio Ivoire's first
ever collaborative piece. Musically it is
a sad. slow burn that lingers after the
first listen, built around a repeated
insistent beat that alludes to something
impalpably greater beyond the song,
but never quite makes it there.
For Trio Ivoire, the secret is instrumental and musical synchronization
while delivering unexpected bouts of
passion in between syncopated beats. "I
think my relationship with music can
best be characterized as a love affair."
Ludemann said. "It was love at first
sight." Or. in this case, sound.
With eyes closed. Ludemann played
the melancholy opening notes of
"Turning Points" on the grand piano.
His face held an impassioned expression, and his eyes .surveyed the crowd
with a kind of ritualistic appreciation.
At frequent intervals, he would sit or
stand up from his chair, carried away
by the intensity of his playing.
Sardjoe handled his drums like a
beloved car, harnessing them in their
full structural drivability. He tapped
the metal horns and caressed the hi-hat,
and just as skillfully, he banged on the
drums with all his might during his
intense, epic solos. For the most part,
Keita treated bis balaphon like an old
friend. At some points though, it started
bouncing precariously from his vibrant

exploded from the stage, the listeners
were caught off guard but not completely surprised. The music drove towards
a dynamic, grandiose crescendo that
was reminiscent of joyful African

dances. These guys were a riot.
Trio Ivoire showcased an original
musical oeuvre that defied easy categorization on Friday night. "The virtual
piano" was Liidemann's flirtation with
experimental piano, creating discordant sounds by tweaking the piano
strings. Pieces such as "Himizo" and
"Ha-Iri" sounded playful and childlike;

As the spotlights in the Lang Concert
Hall dimmed, a hushed silence diffused
through the waiting crowd. The stage
was set. with a gleaming grand piano on
the right, an unassuming set of drums
on the left, and in between, an exotic
object stood, demanding attention.
It was a curious wooden instrument,
much like an earthy version of a xylophone, with ball-shaped gourds buttressing each key. This was the "balaphon." Rich in history, it is the instrumental backbone of the musical storytelling tradition in West Africa. For centuries, the balaphon accompanied poetsingers, the "griots," as they wandered
from, village to village, telling stories,
satires and gossip and singing songs of
old.
But for Trio Ivoire. the exceptional
balaphon was simply part of the musical norm. It was just another cog in the
wheel of the electrifying three-person
ensemble that unequivocally brought

will be performing live on campus, on Saturday at 8:00 p.m. for
this semester's Large Scale
Event, or LSE.
Girl Talk shows have reputationsfor being, essentially, massive and crazy dance parties.
Gillis is-known for inviting
audience members to come up
onto the stage and dance with
him. Concertgoers tend to leave
drenched in sweat. Many would
be hard-pressed to think of any
other DJs quite as name-recognizable that is, if one is of the
opinion that Girl Talk is a DJ.
"Mash-ups," also known as
"bootlegs," "blends," "bastard
pop" and by a wealth of other
names, are pieces of music created by overlaying tracks (e.g.
vocal tracks, beats, etc.) from
songs over tracks from other
songs. Perhaps due to his popularity, Girl Talk has become

somewhat of a poster child for

appropriation-based contempo-

rary arts. He was featured in
the documentary "RiP! A Remix
Manifesto," which suggests that
copyright laws stifle creativity.
Some claim that, even despite
the gray areas of legality in
which he works, Girl Talk's
main crime is that of unoriginality; after all, he doesn't write
any ofhis own music.
Popular opinion, especially
among college kids, seems to be
of the former. "The biggest reason for getting Girl Talk is that
so many people on campus want
to see him," Sarah Kroll 'll,

head of the LSE committee,
said.
LSE selections, according to
Kroll, were made based on a
survey that the committee sent
out after Worthstock asking students who they would most like
to have perform on campus.
"[We] all have different tastes,
but
we want to try to appeal
to as much of the student population as possible," Ivana Ng 'l2,
member of the LSE committee,
said.

ranged few and far between.
Mostly, there are just those who

know him and those who don't.
"[Girl Talk] will be a great
time, so I'm really excited,"
Linnet Davis-Stermitz 'l2 said.
"[The concert] will be very participatory."
Questions and debate over
Girl Talk's talent and legitima-

cy, voiced all over campus when

"Feed the Animals" was
released seem to have died
away in anticipation of the live
performance.

Girl Talk's most recent
album, "Feed the Animals," was
composed of over three hundred
samples from artists both popular and obscure. However these
samples are unauthorized; The
New York Times Magazine has
referred to Gillis' work as "a
lawsuit waiting to happen."
Gillis, in response to the criticism, cites fair use in "Feed the
Animals." He states that the
album was originally created as
a single, long piece of music
weaving in and out of genres,
styles, and artists to create one
seamless mash-up. In fact,
interestingly enough, when

and "I don't value music made
from sampling."
The opener for Girl Talk has
yet to be announced, but will be,
according to Kroll, a stand-up
comedian. "The decision was a
combination of having tech constraints and wanting to appeal
to a bigger crowd. It's kind of
unconventional, but it should
be fun."

"Feed the Animals" was
released, Girl Talk's record
label, Illegal Art, made the
album available for download
online and gave the buyer the
option of paying exactly as
much as he or she would like,

BY CAMILA RYDER

cryderl@swarthmore.edu

All the hype surrounding "Paranormal Activity"
began with the trailer, which mixed scenes from the
movie and clips of screening audience's reactions. With
rumors of people walking out because it was too frightening or not sleeping for weeks after, "Paranormal
Activity" drew comparisons to "TheBlair Witch Project"
and seemed poised to be one of the scariest movies of the
year. But was all this hype just that?
"Paranormal Activity" was shot in a week in director
Oren Peli's house with one of the main actors, Micah
Sloat, collecting footage with a hand-held video camera.
An unmarried couple moves into a new home and believe
they are experiencing a demonic presence. Micah hopes
that the video camera, which is set up facing their bed
and hallway, will capture what goes on at night and help
them "solve the problem." Over the two weeks of recordings, the demonic presence becomes stronger every
night, ranging from the doors moving and footsteps to
even more scream-inducing moments.
While patience is needed to get through the couple's
string of arguments, the slow build-up of the demon's
scare tactics gets your heart beating quickly. The acting
was not superb, though that could be expected for a horror movie, but people yelling at the screen, "Wake up,
Micah!" or "Leave that crazy bitch," along with an excess
of curse words, made "Paranormal Activity" a more
enjoyable experience.
Most horror movies traumatize me for weeks, even

months, after watching them. But "Paranormal Activity"
was not the frightfest it was made out to be.

Remixing the debate over Girl Talk's music
On August 22,1990, a young man named
Robert Van Winkle released a seminal hiphop track that was at once a monumental
mainstream success for the genre, a colossal affront to the integrity of the art form
and an act of blatant thievery. Better
known to the world as Vanilla Ice, Van
Winkle's song "Ice Ice Baby" sampled the
bassline of the 1981 Queen and David
Bowie collaboration "Under Pressure"
without crediting the original composers.
One lawsuit later, Vanilla Ice was forced to
hand over $4 million and songwriting
credit to Freddie Mercury and Bowie.
The reason we bring Up "Ice Ice Baby"
is not to renew memories of a song that
Blender Magazine once ranked fifth in its
list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, but to preface the many arguments lodged against
the mash-up artist Gregg Gillis, better
known as Girl Talk, who will be the main
act of this semester's Large Scale Event.
Girl Talk's musical creations have also
come under fire for being popular despite
being derivative, and many question both
his legitimacy and his originality as an
artist. Vanilla Ice stole only a bassline
from Queen and David Bowie and was
forced to pay $4 million; Girl Talk's repertoire consists solely of, as a 2008 New York
Times review states, "a collage of hits,
recent and old, that are instantly recognizable to just about everyone in the crowd."
With four albums released since 2002,
all under the appropriately named label
Illegal Art, Girl Talk is enjoying success
while still under intense scrutiny. If critics
are not concerned about the legality of his
work, then they question the morality of it,
and many challenge the very notion that
Girl Talk is a musicalartist at all: as a 2006
Stylus Magazine review of his album
"Night Ripper" scoffs, "Gillis
deliverfs]
decent, low-fiber escapism and
cheap
thrills." Arguments in these veins are easy
to make, but they definitely require further exploration before anyone quickly
...

...

denounces Girl Talk's work.

To begin with, consider the legal worries surrounding Girl Talk. There are four
factors that guide "fair use" under United
States law, three of which can be applied to
the controversy: purpose and character of
the use, amount and substantiality of the
use, and effect of use on original value of
the used work. Supporters of Girl Talk will
argue that his music is transformative, but
there are equally strong arguments that he
falls short in the first factor. Fair use can
be attributed to educational or critical
works, neither of which Girl Talk qualifies
for. His music is hardly a parody of anything else, either, which would be permissible under fair use rulings
he is simply
mashing together tracks, after all.
Girl Talk's proponents may go on to say
that his music only takes short samples
from others' material, which does not constitute copyright infringement. While this
is true in some cases and not in others (he
lifts entire verses from rap songs for some
of his own tracks, for example), this argument is potentially irrelevant. In the
Harper & Row vs. Nation Enterprises case
of 1985, the Supreme Court ruled that even
a short sample is illegal if the sample is
"key" or important enough. (So Vanilla Ice
might have been guilty of copyright
infringement even if he had just used the
"Under Pressure" bassline for a couple of
bars, since the riff was the foundation of
the song,)

12

On the final point, defenders of Girl
Talk (and, indeed, the man himself) contend that the original artists' songs have
hardly been devalued as a result of the
mash-ups. If anything, borrowing from
some older songs has reinvigorated their
appeal. But while there is enough gray
area in the law to favor Girl Talk, obviously there remain convincing arguments
against him from a legal standpoint.
From an ethical standpoint, Girl Talk's
detractors also have plenty to say. There
are those who question the morality of taking other artists' work and adding nothing
original to it, and then passing it off as new
material. It seems, however, that making
that argument ignores the inventive
nature of Girl Talk's music. Mashing up
tracks sounds easy to do, but to fit the beat
from a hip-hop track to the vocals of classic rocks and the backing melody of a
trashy 'Bos pop song is definitely harder
than it sounds. And it is not as though Girl
Talk is pulling a Vanilla Ice and claiming
credit for the songs he borrows from (it
also helps that Girl Talk is not putting out
garbage like "Ice Ice Baby"); on the contrary, Girl Talk explicitly disavows credit
for the source material and does not
charge for his music, which can be found
online.
Yet there he is on stage, raking in the
profits from live concerts. Surely there is
something wrong about achieving success
based completely on other artists' songs
without even giving them so much as royalty checks. But this argument sounds
weak. Maybe some do feel strongly that
Girl Talk is obliged to pay the hundreds of
musicians he borrows from, but to feel as
such would be to ignore the undeniable
fact that people have demonstrated a great
willingness to pay for Girl Talk concerts
specifically without regard to whether the
artists he cribs from are compensated. If
people are willing to give up money for his
performances, what right does anyone
have to push any kind of nebulous moral
argument against him?
At the same time, the copyright worries
crop up again even for Girl Talk's live
shows. Clubs, for example, have to pay
licensing fees to play music for partygoers'
enjoyment; Girl Talk, as clearly established, has paid no fees in the creation and
subsequent presentation of his music.
Until the legal ambiguity is resolved,
though, this remains a fairly weak point.
What is not a weak point is the argument concerning the integrity of the music
he mashes together. Somehow, it does not
feel right to blaspheme "Bohemian
Rhapsody"
by
mashing
it with
"Umbrella," or, worse, the aforementioned
Vanilla Ice, both of which Girl Talk does in
the track "Set It Off." And then there are
the politically or socially powerful messages that some songs project; mash-ups, it
would seem, horribly cheapen these messages. Girl Talk might as well play Dr.
King's "I Have a Dream" speech over
"Crank Dat (Soulja Boy)."
Nevertheless, the overarching point
that must be made is that, musically or
ethically or otherwise, Girl Talk does
retain a measure of ownership over what
he has created. There is an excellent
Malcolm Gladwell article in The New
Yorker from 2004, in which the journalist
muses on the nature of plagiarism and
deriving from others' work, having been
the "victim" of plagiarism himself. Called

"Something Borrowed," the article reveals
Gladwell's inclination against so quickly
condemning those who take from others'
material and then expand upon it, sometimes in completely new directions. "Old

words in the service of a new idea aren't
the problem," Gladwell writes. "What
inhibits creativity is new words in the
service of an old idea."
In Girl Talk's mash-ups, then, what we
find surely are new and innovative ideas

to

presented through an amalgamation ofold
words. To deny him the musical ownership
of the
if not his legal ownership
creations would be to deny the very nature
of art itself: a constant reframing, remixing and reviving of previous progressions.
Whether or not an individual enjoys the
dance tracks produced from combining
Golden Age rap and alternative rock and
R&B is irrelevant to the conversation on
Girl Talk's musical validity.

Direct action needed to effect change we need
To the Editor:

Recently, while I was leading a seminar in Canada, a labor leader came to me during a break, fixed me with an intense gaze and said, "George, why have your people

abandoned your President?"
I had little to say. Her question hit the mark; my people have been remarkably
passive.

A group of Swarthmore students on Friday, October 30, however, modeled a possible turn-around. The students were arrested while sitting at the entrance to the
Independence Blue Cross headquarters (a company that serves Swarthmore) to
underline their demand that Blue Cross stop trying to block health care reform.
Eight students and one alum were among the thirteen who committed civil disobedience, supported by a rally that included more Swarthmore students.
It has always been plain to me that President Obama had no chance of getting serious health care reform through a Congress that is already largely bought by the private insurance industry, unless a serious "people power" movement using nonviolent direct action provides a counterweight. I remember some naive liberals in the
Sixties imagining that civil rights could be gained simply by voting, lobbying, and
signing petitions
and then learning the hard way that it takes direct action to
make democracy work.
Now some Swarthmore students and others are showing what truly pragmatic
politics looks like
getting in there and fighting for what you want.
We don't need to abandon our President, who years ago concluded that a single
payer system is actually what would deliver healthcare best. Obama doesn't believe
that Americans will fight for the best, so this year is proposing something that, while
very inadequate, is at least a reform.
Dr. Martin Luther King said over and over that "freedom is not free." I personally am not very interested in hearing criticisms of our President from people who
voted for him, and then left him twisting in the winds of right wing attack and
bought-off Democratic Congress members. Will others in the Swarthmore community follow the lead of the Swarthmore nine and take direct action, on health care, climate change and other issues vital to our future?

Two songs I heard at the Halloween

song "Blame It" by Jamie Foxx: with a
well-known chorus line "Blame it on

claims that "no means yes" for the
woman he is pursuing in the song. "She

the drunken hook-up culture (no

front of women. Good girls are the type
you introduce to your parents; bad girls
are the type you just sleep with.
"Goodness" and "badness" are attributed as permanent characteristics: good
girls will always be good and bad girls
will always be bad. Even if the singer
gets the "good girl" to "go bad" for "just
one night," her "badness" is transient.
This song celebrates the notion of the
ultimate "conquest" for the "bad boy" to
get the "good girl" to unleash the "bad"
inside. Why is the badness of "good
girls" more compelling than the badness of "bad girls"? It also perpetuates
cultural stigma attached to female sexuality. Even while encouraging "good
girls" to "go bad," the necessary implication is that sex is inherently bad (for
women) and ''good" is a child-like, innocent sweetness.

The fact that the song features a coed group of vocalists and includes the
voice of the "good girl" asserting her
sexuality could be interpreted as

watching

watch music videos with similar sexual
themes reminds me that not everyone
interprets videos this way.
"Empowerment" can easily become
pure sexual objectification. So is it okay
for progressive, liberated women to like
these videos? How are we to respond?
Ultimately, I think the problem lies
in the fact that female sexual empowerment still occurs within the dominant
(read: male) paradigm that determines
definitions of sexuality. Reclamations
of sexuality, often even mainstream
nods at queerness, occur in such a way
as to still appeal to male fans. Is empowerment on someone else's terms really
empowerment?
At Swarthmore, a lot of people like
talking about not being sexist and not
being heteronormative, but our social
lives still revolve around dancing to
songs that reek of these progressive

sins.

McMinn, Rose lead runners at muddy conferences
BY TIMOTHY BERNSTEIN
tbernstl@swarthmore.edu

The men's and women's cross country teams spent
the afternoon of Halloween on Saturday at the 2009
Centennial Conference Championships at Gettysburg
College.
Adding to a stellar debut year, John McMinn 'l3 led
the Garnet men in the championship race with a
27:59.96 finish over the eight-kilometer course, good for
21st place overall in 99-man field. As a team,
Swarthmore finished sixth, an improvement over seventh last year, while the title went to Dickinson for the
second year in a row.
Dickinson won the meet on the strength of the top
four individual finishes, with senior Greg Leak defending his 2008 championship in 26:30.7
L
While the sixth place finish wasn't what the Garnet
men hoped for, it was an impressive result considering
the conditions on race day. Swarthmore, along with the
other teams in the meet, was forced to battle less than
ideal course conditions as well as key absences due to

illness.
Michael Fleischmann 13 said the course was "unbelievably muddy
the muddiest course we had run all
season."
Four-year veteran David Riccardi 'lO was pleased
with the result considering the circumstances. "While
we were disappointed that we did not reach our preseason goal
we had reasons to be optimistic," he
said. Riccardi explained that four of the Garnet's top
runners (Zach Gershenson 'l2, Bill King 'l3, Jacob
Phillips 'l3 and Jonnie Tompkins 10) were sidelinedfor
the conference race by the HINI outbreak on campus.
Another runner, he said, ran despite having the flu.
...

With the 21st-place finish, McMinn headlined what
has proven to be a top notch group of first-year runners
for the Garnet. Brian King 'l3 crossed the line in 33rd
place with a time of 28:35.94, while Aidan Dumont
McCaffrey 13 took 45th place, coming in at 29.2L47. The
trio was second, third, and sixth among first-year runners at the meet. Their success is especially promising
in a sport that favors age. The top 20 finishers included
only four sophomores and just one first-year.
Garnet head coach Peter Carroll was pensive following the race.
"I thought things went okay, considering [the
absences]," Carroll said. "Cross-country isn't a sport
where someone sick or hurt can play ten minutes, then
sub out and come back in. Your skills diminish over the
course of a race."
"Not to make excuses," he added. "We got sixth; bestcase, I think we could have gotten fifth, but we'll give
Haverford a shot [at the Mid-East Regional Meet] and see
if we have a few tricks up our sleeve."
Chris Wickham 'l2 finished in 62nd place in a time of
30:14.20, while Patrick Hartnett 11 crossed the line in
65th place (30:26.83) to round out the scoring for
Swarthmore, which was the only team not to score a senior in the meet another good omen for the future.
"It should definitely get better," Fleischmann said of
the strong crew of newcomers that has anchored the
Garnet this season. As always, the men celebrate
improvement even if the results don't tell the whole
story. Still, there are concrete goals for the next few seasons. "We'll definitely feel this loss," Fleischmann said.
On the women's side, Hannah Rose 'l2 finished the
highest of the Swarthmore entries, coming in 17th with
a time of 24:27.43. Swarthmore finished fifth overall
while national No. 2 Johns Hopkins University defended

the team title. Haverford sophomore Emily Lipman won
with a 22:40.66 finish, defeating Hopkins' defending
champion Laura Paulsen.
"We had to fight our way through the mud," Rebecca
Woo 11 said, echoing the frustration of her male teammates. Woo added that the race conditions heightened
tensions between runners in the pack, recalling that
elbow jabs and growls were exchanged during the race.
The Garnet also got a boost from top runner Nyika
Corbett 'lO, whose involvement in the race was up in the
air leading up to Saturday due to a leg injury.
"She'd been nursing a sore hamstring for the past
couple of weeks," said Carroll, "but she's a plugger."
Corbett took to the course for the Garnet anyway,
coming in in 21st place at 24:4L49.
Lauren DeLuca 'lO and Margret Lenfest 'l2 also
scored for the Garnet in 27th and 30th places, respectively, in times of 24:52.97 and 25:1176. Woo finished out
the scoring positions for the Garnet in 43rd place
(25:37.30).

Next up for both teams is the NCAA Division 111 MidEast Regional meet, to be held at Lehigh University in
Bethlehem on Nov. 15.
The top two teams at the Regional meet will automatically advance to the NCAA Division 111 Cross Country
Championships, which will be hosted by BaldwinWallace College in Cleveland on Nov. 2L

Sixteen additional teams across all eight regions will
receive at-large bids. Fifty-six individual runners who
are not on a qualifying team will also be invited to the
meet. Seven runners will score for each team at the
Regionals.

Results from the conference meet will be wiped clean
as the top Garnet runners will attempt to qualify out of
the region. Start time is listed as 11:00 a.m.

On Federer fanfare: Overcoming the 'bad guy' stigma
I should

final for a

is one of

the
best
Tricks out of the Playbook
and most
consistent
tennis
players of the decade (only he and
Federer have finished ranked in the top
ten for the past six years), and he also
represents everything a casual sports
fan loves in an athlete.
Roddick plays a somewhat comically
single-faceted tennis style; he dominates opponents mainly through the
power of his serves and forehand. He is
funny and humble on-court, throwing
exaggerated facial expressions at the
line judges (the classic Roddick wideeyed, open-mouthed look that suggests,
"I have no idea what match you're
watching." or "That ridiculous call
must be matched by my equally ridiculous facial expression."), while also
lauding his opponent for well-placed
shots (also accompanied by his
"Roddick Glare").
He is also funny and humble offcourt at his press conferences and
interviews. (Though clearly upset after
losing this year's Wimbledon, Roddick
remained true to character, joking,
"Sorry Pete, I know, uh, I tried to hold
[Federer] off [from breaking your
Grand Slam record]." And despite his
consistency, Roddick remains the perpetual underdog (his record against

14

Federer is 2-19, 0-4 in Grand Slam
finals).

Most importantly, Roddick is passionate about tennis and devoted to
improving. Everyone watching him
play Federer knew he wanted desperately to win his second Grand Slam by
triumphing at Wimbledon. Andy
always plays an elevated level of tennis
against Federer (see: 2007 US Open
Match), and this Wimbledon was no
exception.
I should have rooted for Roddick.

But I didn't.
Federer is everything Roddick is not.
Unlike Roddick, Federer is never overlooked. He makes headlines when he is
winning but also when he is losing (possible sample headlines: "Federer's Fall
from Tennis Immortality" or "Federer
Tries out for Swiss Figure Skating
Team"). Federer also acts in an elitist,
tactless and gaudy way in the spotlight.
For example, take my somewhat exaggerated
interpretation
of
the
Wimbledon post-match interview:
ROGER: As you can see, my pristine
white track-jacket that I had embroidered (before the match, I may add) with
a golden "15" symbolizes my recordbreaking 15th Grand Slam victory. I
decided that the ridiculous white cardigan that I wore last year was inappropriate. Oh, and sorry about your loss Andy.
Can't win them all! I lost here last year
to Nadal, you know?

ANDY: (dejectedly sitting on the
side, shooting the Roddick glare) Yeah.
Though this was one of the best matches of my career and I still can't beat
you. And you've already won five

[Wimbledon Championships]!

And after the winner's ceremony
ended? We were all greeted by Federer's
face again in those absurd commercials. Look, Federer playing tennis in a
suit! Look, Federer playing tennis while

shaving! I should buy a Rolex and a

Gillette Fusion!
I should have rooted for Roddick for
many reasons. It's easy to cheer for
Roddick, the eternal joker and underdog, and Federer can be disagreeable.
Yet one more thing separates both athletes: Federer is a winner. That is why I
wanted him to win Wimbledon this year.
We all love winners. But we also
want athletes to be more than just good
at what they do. We want them to be the
whole deal; we want them to be able to
hit a forehand winner, but we want
them to be humble about it. We want
talented athletes to have good character. That kind of athlete rarely exists,
and the character of an athlete overall
especially if the athdoesn't matter
lete is as accomplished as Roger is.
It isn't wrong to judge athletes on
their lifestyles or characters, but they
shouldn't overshadow the beauty of talent. Federer shouldn't even be placed
under such scrutiny because his faults
are trivial (I can't forgive him for the
commercials, but I can throw some of
the blame on his sponsors for creating
his image of elitism).
Add in the fact that he chose to fly
commercially during the peak of his
career and has also created a charity
group that helps educate children,
Roger doesn't seem as bad as I've made
him out to be.
I am attracted to people who aren't
just passionate for what they do but
also excel at what they do. While he was
in his prime, I rarely doubted Federer's
ability to win important matches
(Sports Illustrated columnist Joe
Posnanski notes that his career winning percentage of 91 percent at
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open is greater
than the free-throw percentage of most
basketball players). Few other athletes

Michael Phelps and Mariano Rivera are
some athletes who exhibit this "Federer
Factor"
the ability to always find
ways to succeed in critical situations
(should we note a "Nadal Exception"?).
Tennis fans everywhere saw the factor in action this summer. With
Roddick playing the match of his life,
serving on set point, Federer quietly
stepped up to the baseline and stole the
set back. From that moment on, I realized Federer would triumph, and both
players might have guessed the outcome of the match as well. Federer is
just that good, and this excellence has
always inspired me to support him.
Watch any clip of his highlights on
YouTube (suggested match: 2008
Australian Open versus Fabrice
Santoro), and I guarantee you will be

I
began

to

reflect about my own experience as a
scholar-athlete.
From reading Reilly's column, it's
instantly clear that Barkley already
lives the life of a superstar.
' How could he not? The kid is 19 years
old and is seen every week by hundreds
of thousands of fans on the biggest stage
in college football. There are already
"mock drafts" that predict Barkley will
be picked in the first round of the NFL
Draft in two years.
Regardless of the fame, the potential
big bills contracts, and the tremendous
opportunities that are a reality for
Barkley everyday of his life, I would
never trade my experience as a scholarathlete for his.
Sure, the cynics among you out there
are probably saying this is all bogus;
who wouldn't want a life like Matt
Barkley?
I'm not saying it isn't a sweet deal to
be a star quarterback at a storied university with a tremendous future. I'm
just trying to say that the life of a
Division 111 athlete isn't half bad either.
With only one

The overarching feeling, though, is
that being out there is just plain fun.
Even when we get fired up at each
other, even when the snow is really
coming down around us and even when
I don't have a great practice, I'd still
rather be out on the field with my teammates than anywhere else.
I feel tremendously privileged to feel
the way about playing a sport that I do,
because I'm sure for many athletes like
Matt Barkley, it isn't all that fun.
I certainly don't have to put up with
national media outlets or disgruntled
fans maligning me on the Internet after
a bad loss. I simply get to enjoy the
sport. Let's not get confused though.
Division 111 isn't just about having fun,
much like my Phoenix columnist brother Andrew Greenblatt noted in his column about D-111 athletics. We are real
athletes here to win games.
The real love for the game as
Division 111 athletes comes out in the
offseason. Swarthmore isn't USC; our
team doesn't have a platoon of strength
and conditioning coaches watching
over our shoulders to see who's improving and who needs to get in gear. We do
it because we are highly motivated people who get a lot of intrinsic value out
of making ourselves and our teammates
better.
I see scholar-athletes of all "sports
working hard down in the weight room
or out on the track and you can see it in
their faces that they enjoy it.
You might not consciously admit
that you like the feeling of burning
lungs or aching muscles, but the bond

through pain and hard work in the offseason is incredible.

first-years in the conference.

cer team returned to its winning ways on
Saturday, defeating Haverford on the road
with a 4-2 final score.
The regular season finale, played in a
steady cold rain, saw Morgan Langley 'll
score for the first time since Oct. 7. With
the win, the Garnet clinched the second
seed in the Centennial Conference playoffs.

Having been shut out for only the sec-

ond time this season in that penultimate
game against Muhlenberg, the Garnet
offense jumped to life at Haverford.
In just the 14th minute, David Sterngold
'l2 took a pass from defender Brett
McLarney 'l2 from the right wing, and six
minutes later, Langley scored his teamleading 13th goal of the season, giving the
Garnet a two-goal lead.
Defender Gage Newman 'll, who missed
the matchup with Muhlenberg due to illness, added two goals in his return to the
Garnet to cap the Swarthmore scoring.
Coach Eric Wagner believes that the
Garnet, even though they couldn't put a

shot into the net against Muhlenberg, was

able to build from its strong performance
on Senior Day at Swarthmore. "We had our
chances [against Muhlenberg]. We hit the
crossbar, we had another one go off the
post, and I thought that we played extremely well," Wagner said.
"Our guys did everything they could. In
the overtimes, we had eight shots. Wa're

disappointed, but not disappointed in how
we played and how hard we worked,"
Wagner added.

The hard work paid off for the Garnet on
Saturday, as Swarthmore dominated play
and scored more goals than they had in
their previous four games combined
and
the most goals in
a game since

But although the Garnet was able to
shutdown Hopkins' potent offense in tha
first match-up this season, the player
know that tomorrow's conference semifinal

will be an intense game.
"It's always difficult to play a team twice

in a year, especially one as tough a
Hopkins. It'll take an even better team
effort and more creativity because they
have already seen how we beat them before
and they'll look to stop that," Fabian Castro
'l2 said. Castro is tied for second on the
team with five assists.
"Any game we have against Hopkins i

just need to have that mentality again. We

Morgan Langley, who finished second in

As the Garnet turns towards the
Centennial Conference playoffs, Langley' s
goal represents the transition and metamorphosis of the junior who scored just
three times last season. "Morgan plays a
big part
and he has realized that his part
is more than just scoring goals
it's setting up goals, it's drawing attention away
from other guys like [Sterngold] who can

becoming a much more complete player
now," Wagner said.

Conference semifinals for the first time in the history of the program.
The volleyball team dropped a 3-1

them.
The win clinched the second seed in

Veterans Kearney Bangs 10 and
Johanna Bond 'lO had a strong showing
on their Senior Day. The setter Bangs

Despite the loss, the Garnet earned a

continued the historic run by defeating
fifth-seed Muhlenberg by a score of 3-1
last night, taking three consecutive sets
after dropping the first set.
