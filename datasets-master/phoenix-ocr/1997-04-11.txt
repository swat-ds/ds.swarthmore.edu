On Thursday, the first pro-life speaker at
the College in five years spoke on abortion.
Serrin Foster, Executive Director ofFeminist
for Life gave a lecture entitled "Feminist
Argument for Life." She asserted that abortion being legal puts "pressure on women to
make that choice." The abortion choice, according to Foster, is made out of desperation
and women are merely "adapting to a society
that says they can't have children until a
certain age."
Foster described the early davs of the feminist movement, when pioneering feminists
like Mary Wollenscraft, Alice Paul, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton vehemently recognized
that "abortion was not the answer." These

Foster described how the feminist moveprogressed to a stance that made abortion itscentral goal. During this period, women
were manipulated to believe that they couldn't

His mother bought their first computer, an

the age of 14, Hall began work selling retail

businesses.
Hall first got online, local Chicago bulletin

computer as a means to find out about weird
subcultures and "shock people with them."

After one of the most selective
admissions seasons in its history,
Swarthmore will open its green pastures to mass numbers of new prospective students this weekend, more
commonly known as "Spec Weekend". Students have already volunteered to welcome the specs into their
rooms for the night and the admissions staff has planned non-stop activities designed to give the specs a
better understanding of life at
Swarthmore.
The festivities begin on Thursday
afternoon when 90 prospective students of color are expected to attend
Minority Pre-frosh Weekend. The
program will feature a luncheon with
staff and faculty of color, three dinner discussions on Friday night—which are hosted by SAO, SASS,
and HOLA respectively—as well as
a potpourri of social events on Friday
night. These will include the second
annual Night ofCreative Expression,
held at the BCC, where both current
students and prospective students can
show off their talents.
According to Tracy Matthews, Assistant Dean of Admissions and one
of the main organizers of Minority
Pre-frosh Weekend, the purpose of
the event is "for specs ofcolor to find
out about their perspective, their situation, at a predominantly white institution." Matthews emphasized that
the orientation program was not intended "to segregate the students,"
also mentioning that specs participating in pre-frosh weekend are encouraged to stay through the regular
spec weekend which ends on Monday.

Swarthmore will host eight of the
thirteen students who have been selected as potential Lang scholarship
recipients for their commitment and
achievement in community service.

On Wednesday, in a campus debate entitled "Welfare: Safety Net or Web of Dependency?" Wendell Primus, a liberal, and Robert Rector, a conservative, debated welfare
policy. Although both agreed that the welfare system should encourage self-sufficiency
rather than dependence, they disagreed about
the most effective method to achieve this
goal.
Primus, who resigned from Clinton's administration after the signing of the welfare
bill, asserted that the current welfare system
is sexist, and advocated a two-pronged strat-

egy to move women into the workforce and
force fathers to pay child support. He objected to the recent bill because it drastically
cut spending, increased child poverty, and
forced one million legal immigrants off the
welfare rolls.
Rector, who supports most points of the
welfare bill, advocated reforms which "rebuild families and build a responsible work
ethic." According to Rector, the welfare
system during the past thirty years sends
people the message "fail, engage in dysfunctional behavior, and we'll send you a check."

coup Franco received arms, airplanes, ships,
as well as thousands of troops from his allies
Hitler and Mussolini. Outraged, the Republican government announced that it would
accept volunteers from around the world for

SAC Event

Raises Issues
of Exclusivity
By

Aarti Iyer

Over the last two weeks, a small controversy has emerged regarding the way Student Activities Committee (SAC) allocates
funds for weekly social events. This issue
was raised when SAC decided to fund an
event sponsored by the Swarthmore ChristianFellowship (SCF). The sponsored event
was a reception after the Easter Sunrise
Service on Sunday, March 30.
According to Michelle Park '99, President and Evangelism Coordinator of SCF,
the group "didn't have the money in [their]
budget to do this extra event...we were looking for alternate sources of funding." Since
SAC funded an all-campus bonfire hosted
by SCF last spring, the group decided to ask
SAC for $7O to help fund their reception.
The week before the reception, SCF
handed in a proposal to SAC. Brian Bell '99,
then co-director of SAC, said that a lot of
time was spent discussing the proposal. "At
the time, SAC was not readily aware of
rules pertaining to such a proposal, mainly
because such a proposal rarely is presented,"
said Bell. Several SAC members expressed
some concern about the nature of the event:
"The issue came up that this was a religious
event that may cause some people to feel
excluded," said Bell. "There was also some
concern about whether this was the kind of
event that SAC should be sponsoring."
In the end, a decision was made to fund
the reception. According to Bell, what stuSee Funding, page 2

Bi-partisan Welfare Debate
from Welfare, page 1

To counter this, Rector advocated a work
requirement in order to reduce the welfare
caseload. He also advocated marriage as a
way to counter pervasive social problems, since
"out of wedlock childbearing is the principal
cause of theseproblems." Rector also asserted
that we must distinguish between materialpoverty and behavioral poverty, andbetween those
whoreally needwelfareand those who will take
"a free handout."
Depending on their political affiliations,
students had different views on the debate.
Nina Paynter '97, stated that Rector's allegation "that women are having kids to get money
is utterly ridiculous because the money provided by welfare is not even enough to provide proper daycare, clothe and feed their
children." Rowan Hoole 'OO criticized
Rector's assumption that marriage and nuclear
families will solve larger social problems.
Instead, Hoole said that Rector's proposals
would push single mothers off welfare rolls
and "put financial pressure in order to keep
women in marriage and can, by forcing women
into bad marriages, lead to domestic violence

situations."
On the other hand, Neena Shenai '99, said
that the debate was "very representative of
how the country feels on welfare in
generally...both debaters agreed that the welfare system in place for the last 30 years
needed to be changed and that it was not
working the way it was." Damon Taaffe '99
agreed with some of Rector's points, particularly Rector's "reasonable" assertion that re-

a community service requirement in
return for public assistance.
Planners of the event, both from College
Democrats and Swarthmore Conservative
Union, were pleased with the debate.
Brendan Nyhan 'OO, co-president of College Democrats, was pleased to see "an
effective conservative speaker, which is
something we don't get at Swarthmore often." Hillary Thompson '99, secretary of
SCU, stated that she would like to see more
dialogue between the two groups, and more
bipartisan debates next semester.
Many students found the debate informative, but some wished that the debaters had
been talked more about the moral and racial
issues surrounding welfare. "I would have
picked someone a little more emotionally
involved in the issue," said Nina Paynter
'97. According to David Zipper 'OO, at the
beginning of the debate, "both were keeping
issue of at arm's length...welfare is an issue
oflife and deathand should not be treated in
theoretical terms." Nyhan noted that no little
mention was made ofrace, which he saw as
a glaring omission since welfare is often
coded language for black single mothers.
"It would have been interesting to see the
race issues addressed more," said Nyhan.
The debate was sponsoredby Swarthmore
College Democrats and Swarthmore College Republicans, as well as Swarthmore
Conservative Union, Economics Department, Political Science Department, Public
Policy Program, Black Cultural Center,
Worth Health Center, and Forum for Free
Speech.

more important than children." Also, the
argument used in Roe v. Wade, which asserts that pregnancy is "our problem because it involves our bodies," is used to
support legislation that is harmful to women.
For example in the case of child support,
men are relieved of responsibility because
"if it's a woman's choice, why should [the
husband] pay child support?"
Foster stated that when a woman has a
unexpected pregnancy, she is pressured to
abort by parents, boyfriend, and employers
who say that "a child will ruin your life."
She is also told that she can "have a child
later" as if children are interchangeable. ..but
as we know even siblings are so different."
Foster told a number of anecdotes about
women who had abortions and regretted it.
Years after their abortion, a numberof them
asked themselves "what would my child be
like at this age?" No women should have an
abortion and according to Foster, both sides
agree that "abortion should be made rare
because it hurts women and children." According to Foster, "6000 women every years
become infertile during the procedure."
Foster urged the audience to demand housing, daycare, and maternity coverage from
universities and an end to "discrimination
against parenting orpregnant students."She
advocated education about strong decision
making skills, and skills about how to say
"No" in sexual situations. She said that she

brought a message of "hope and empowerment for women" and hopes that we can look
at solutions which address women's real
needs—such as "maternity benefits, quality
daycare, and shared responsibility for children coi- :eived"
According to Foster, both thepro-choice and
pro-life sides agree that "abortion is traumatic,
and hard on women." Both sides should work
together to make sure that "no women be
driven to the desperate act ofabortion."
Responses to the lecture varied. Julie
Schwendimann '99, co-coordinator of
Swarthmore Students Advocating Life, said

that agreed with Foster's assertion that "if
abortion were illegal, and there were more
discussion of options like adoption and having the baby, more women would be able to
stand up and say they want the child."
Herrin Hopper '9B, co-coordinator ofProChoice Task Force, disagreed. "I have a big
problem with the fact that Feminists forLife
are trying to outlaw abortion...Although
Feminists for Life and pro-choice organizations are working for many of the same
feminist causes, Feminists for Life are too
idealistic and are not addressing immediate
concerns."

"it was now or never."
Shmuckler also sees this con-

some were journalists, some were
Communists, some were merely men
and women concerned about the rising tide of fascism in Europe. Many
had fled fascist governments in their
own countries in Central and Eastern

Europe.
Gordon's involvement in the war
stemmed from his interest in political
and social causes. Gordon and a
group of fellow students sailed to
Cherbourg posing as a baseball team,
then went on to Paris as a musical
group. They followed secret routes
between sympathetic towns throughout France. Then, they arrived at the
foot of the Pyrenees and were led
through the mountains by a Spanish
guide.
Gordon fought during 1937 and
1938 in the 86th Brigade, which included soldiers of many nationalities. The International Brigades
fought from August of 1936 to November of 1938, not long before the
eventual defeat of the Republicans.
In the hopes that Germany and Italy
woulddisband their troops in concordance with the non-intervention pact
signed by the League of Nations, the
Republican government disbanded
the International troops.
Other nations, however, chose only
to pacify Hitlerand Mussolini and no
action was ever taken to punish Germany or Italy for their illegal intervention.
Franco then took control of Spain
and ran it as a military dictatorship
until his death in 1975.
Gordon survived the war and continued on to fight in Burma against
the Japanese and as a paratrooper
against the Germans in World War 11.
On his return to America, he was at

first praised for having served in
Spain. However, in the years following World War 11, as McCarthyism
rose and suspicion was cast on anyone whohad fought in a foreign army,
veterans of the Spanish War were
vilified as Communists. The only
consequence Gordon suffered, since
he had a stable job with a union, was
that he and his wife were not issued
passports for 19 years because they
were considered untrustworthy by the
government.
Since Franco controlled Spain until 1975 and a fairly conservative
government has been in power until
the nineties, only recently, in 1995,
was there a meeting in Spain for all
the veterans of the International Brigades.
Out of the 35,000-40,000 who
served, only 400 were able to return.
Most have died, many in World
War 11, some in concentration camps
when returned to fascist nations like
Germany and Italy. Sixty-seven
Americans returned, including Gordon. One hundred American veterans were unable to return, most for
medical reasons.
The Spanish Civil War claimed
more that 1,000,000 lives. It was the
first war in which modern technology was widely used to kill civilians
and wipe out whole villages. It involved soldiers from more than 53
countries and the active participation
of six national governments.
Gordon's lecture included videos of
veterans visiting Spain in 1995.
Students who attended were
pleased with the lecture. "I didn't
know anything about the Spanish
Civil War before," said Jennifer Weiss
'9B. "Now I feel like I do. It was
good to get the point ofview of someone who was over there."

Everyone needs to stop and smell all of our

wonderful flowers

The daffodils are out. So are the magnolia trees. Give them a couple
more weeks and the lilacs aren't too far behind. Guess what all good
Swatties are doing? Like you and me, they're all sitting around, and
studying.
We are writing to tell you to cut it out, especially the seniors. We've all
heard the old cliche before: stop and smell the roses. Well, the roses aren't
out yet, so we want you to stop and smell one of the zillion of otherflowers
on this arboretum we call a campus. After you've sniffed all the flowers
you can, we would like you to sit down and appreciate the physical beauty
of Swarthmore. They've taken the big trailers away, and have seeded the
lawn behind Kohlberg. Before we know it, all signs of the construction
will be gone entirely.
After appropriately appreciating the foliage, we want you to go and talk
to your friends, and we don't mean that your conversation should be
restricted to that seminar you had together last fall. Spend some quality
time with the people you care about. The Admissions Office has accumulated 1,000 plus interesting people on campus for the community's
benefit. Hopefully you' ve gotten to know quite a number of them by now.
One of the most important parts of the college experience is getting to
know your neighbor. In the real world it will never be so easy to pick up
a conversation concerning world hunger, Kant, and the imperialistic
tendancies of Baywatch. Some of the best resources can be found outside
of McCabe, and some of us seem to forget this. In twenty years are you
most likely to remember Chaper 6 of that text you're reading or the
conversation that went to 3 a.m. that helped you figure out the meaning of

"Did you know that there are faggot-haters on this campus?"
"Even here people are not out."
"End the silence."
The Day of Silence, which took
place this Wednesday, April 9, is
meant to promote awareness and discussion about the silence that lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgendered
people endure in the face of oppression and hate. Participants took a
vow of silence, and instead of speaking passed out small pieces of paper
that described what the event was
about.
Started last year at the University
of Virginia by two queer female undergraduate students, it is unique in
that it was created by and focuses on
queer youth, and it brings together
both straights and queers to call attention to this pervasive, insidious
silence.
This year more than a hundred colleges, universities, and high schools
across the nation participated. Why
did I choose to organize this? And
why on this campus?
We, as students, pride ourselves on
our heightened levels of social and
political awareness. We are acute
thinkers, astute observers of the real
world around us, and functional members of this pretty little microcosm
we call home for eight months of the
year. This is what we think of our-

selves.
The world, with all its opportunities, is laid out before our eyes, and
we are empowered to seize them,
make something ofourselves, change
what's out there. But do we really
know what's going on? Are our perspectives truly insightful?
What needs to be changed on this
campus is not necessarily the intent
of the activism which our awareness
produces, but the perspective and

Swarthmore must be an interesting place to visit. A person walking
around campus on any given day can see a message scrawled in chalk
across the stones ofMagill Walk thatreads "The other day someone called
me a faggot." Hanging on the walls of Parrish are signs proclaiming,
"America for Americans." Inside dorms, at the appropriate time of year,
you can find signs that say "I live in Wharton and I was raped."
We think it's wonderful that Swarthmore is such an open campus that
people can writemessages like this across campus and these messages, for
the most part, are taken in the right way. We like that awareness days can
be advertised through the same means as lectures and parties in ways that
reach out to all students.
But with Admitted Students Weekend coming up, it seems appropriate
to think about how Swarthmore must appear from an outsider's point of
view. Taking all of these signs at face value is more than simply misleading for those that don't understand that our ways of getting messages
across are to make them as glaring as possible, whatever method that may
take. We understand, however, that it must be a little overwhelming to
suddenly be confronted with all of this overt acceptance of difference.
Because there will be hundreds of somewhat bewildered youngsters
roaming around this weekend, we ask that Swatties keep an eye out. If you
see someone looking confused, whether it be about locating one of the
randomly numbered classrooms in Dupont, or about comprehending why
the College was taken over by Canadians (spelled Kanadians, no less),
help them. Share a little of the insight you've learned about our campus.
After all, these students may very well be a part of this community next
year and it's important that they get a sense of the real Swarthmore
experience before making their decision.
For admitted students, the best advice we can offer is that you realize
that everything you see across campus is an attempt to perpetuate the
openness and honesty of the Swarthmore community. Our increasingly
diverse student body is creating an even more communicative and truthful
environment, as issues that would typically be silenced are brought to the
surface. The best way to get an accurate feel for Swarthmore is to talk with
students about the role of this type of discussion on our campus. Ask
people lots of questions—most of us here can tell you that's the best way
to learn anyways.

A small complaint
Put the chairs back out!
Okay, April Fool's Day is over.
There have been several days over 70 degrees recently.
And yet, the Adirondack Chairs are not yet in their customary resting
place on Magill Walk.
Students are sprawled all over Parrish Beach, dozens and dozens of
them, and there are absolutely none of our beloved Adirondack chairs in

sight.
Parrish needs chairs!
Enough said.

conditions or failure to pay for services rendered would be granted
backpay, in addition to compensation for their time and suffering. At
the same time, the employer would
have been required to make specific
policy changes to ensure that the problem would never occur in the future.
However, this did not happen in the
case of slavery. Negroes did not receive payment anywhere near their
contribution to the nation'seconomic
well-being during the period when
Americans could own slaves.
In fact, neither the newly freed
slaves nor their descendants were
compensated for the gross injustice
done to them by the public and private sector. The government didn't
even make due on it's promise to give
forty acres and a mule to every freed
slave in order to help them start their
lives.
Luckily the country enacted the
policy change necessary to make slavery illegal. Unfortunately several
other aspects of the "peculiar institution"remained imbedded in the foundation of nearly every major institution—public and private—and continues to impact the lives of many
descendants of slaves.
Ironically, Congress may still grant
negroes reparations since it authorized the money but never spent it.
Given the current political climate, I
don't foresee that happening unless a
massive effort is made to achieve that

goal.
To make matters worse, attempts
to address problems stemming from
the legacies of the "peculiar institution" havereceived such a huge backlash. Affirmative action programs
have been vociferously attacked in
the past few years. The federal government has basically cut the safety
net entirely and refuses to adequately
fund the programsand initiatives necessary to move citizens from welfare
to work whichprovides a living wage.
And prisons receive more funding
than public schools in low income
communities of color.
Given the nature of the problem, I
feel that it's timefor America to own
up to its own faults. Ideally theUnited
States would follow the Swiss example. Now I don' t think every Black
person should get a check. Instead a
multi-billion dollar fund should be
created to underwrite programs and,
initiatives aimed at improving edu-

cation, infrastructure, access to home
andbusiness loans, college assistance,
etc. for primarily Blacks and other
communities in need.
Such actions would communicate
that the country is finally acknowledging its guilt in creating and perpetuating a system designed to keep
AfricanAmericans at thelowest rungs
of the social order. Such a fund would
also provide the resources to attack
many of the problems hindering African-American progress at theirroot.

Student Behavior Puts Bad Face on College

Students Smoking in Tarble Anger a Visitor

To the Editor:
We are writing to express our extreme humiliation by the behavior of
several students of the Swarthmore
collective at the recent debate on
welfare issues between Mr. Robert
Rector and Dr. Wendell Primus. The
lack of respect for the opinions of the
speakers began as an embarrassing
murmur and escalated into an appalling display of immaturity. These men,
well respected in their fields of expertise, were invited to participate in
a civilized debate at the top liberal
arts college in the nation. They were,
instead, subjected to a barrage of catcalls, hissing, booing and blatant interruption.
This letter is by no means an insinuation that all Swarthmore students in attendance behaved poorly,
nor are we taking any political side of
the issue at hand. Any subject of
discussion is nullified in the face of
suchreprehensible behavior. The minority of students who participated in

the continual disruptions represented
the whole with alarmingly misdirected fervor; the passions felt by
those students are by no means unreal, but were, rather, inappropriately
displayed.
By inviting these respected speakers here, the College and the student
body made the commitment to provide at the very least a civil atmosphere in which various opinions
could be voiced.
By their actions, the involved students negated that civility, allowing
instead an idealistic shouting match
in which no voices seemed to be
heard. It is unfortunate that these
speakers will leave with such an antagonistic impression of the student
body at this college. It is our sincere
hope that in the future, guests of
Swarthmore College will be treated
with the respect implicit in that invitation.

Straight, White Men Must Face Up to Responsibility for Social Injustices and Work for Change

Health Center Compares Favorably to Others

To the Editor:
A month or so ago I went to a
round-table discussion in the Intercultural Centerabout support groups.
I looked around the room and was
pleased to see a very diverse group of
forty or so students, who also represented a very diverse set of opinions
and attitudes.
Then, however, I scanned thecrowd
for the number of white straight men.
I counted (I think) four, including
myself. Worse, as the discussion furthered, I noticed two of these men
had some of the most conservative
views in the group. They were questioning the need for support groups,
and one even suggested support
groups may promote discrimination.
I see the same trend in most activist
groups on campus. At the Winter
Institute, three white straight men. In
the Diversity Umbrella, perhaps four.
I've gone to a couple feminist majority meetings this semester, and who
would guess, I'm all alone. I recognize the work a few of us are doing, in
SPEEC, Conscious Consumers, and
some other groups, but I imagine
these few see the same trend. .
I read a Phoenix article recently
about why it is not a good idea to guilt
people into social action. I agree.
When I hear someone calling all white
men power-hungry, sexist bigots, I
am not moved to action. I get angry.

I was disturbed after reading the
editorial "Student Health Concerns

three of the March 21 Phoenix. My
staff and I were just recovering from
a particularly busy few days and lamented how it hurt to have students
question our credentials and the quality of our work. We are concerned
when students voice discontent with
our service. I would have appreciated
a call informing me ofyour concerns
and offering me an opportunity to
respond. At the Juan Williams talk, a
Phoenix reporter commented that she
usually queries groups on both sides
of an issue as an effort to be objective. Why wasn't this courtesy afforded us? Before you wrote this editorial, you should have tried to answer the following questions.
1) How many colleges/universities
in the United States have an infirmary service and/or 24 hour service
for students? What percentage of
these are small colleges? What percentage provide this service with no
out of pocket cost to their students?
What happens to students at institutions that do not have 24 hour service?
2) Did you know that the credentials of our regular staff can be found
in theCollegeBulletin? Did you know
that nurses' licenses are posted in the
Health Center Medication Room?
3) What is the usual turnaround
time for laboratory tests at your own
physician offices, let's say from
Monday through Friday, much less
over the weekend? How long are cultures supposed to be incubated? How
does this affect the turnaround time?
4) Under what circumstances can
you be examined by a physician or a
representative from his/her office on
Friday evening, Saturday or Sunday?
And at what cost?
5) How do you define life threatening? Serious danger? How does this
definition compare to that of your
insurance or private care provider?
(Hint: Call Kaiser Permanente for
their definition and when they pay.)
What are the major types ofillnesses
students report and/or are diagnosed
with here? How many were life threatening? How many throat cultures or
tests for mono were positive?
6) What medical procedures are
performed at the Health Center? Are
any new? Exotic?
7) What do other students pay for
studentinsurance? Medications?Lab
testing? Are these free, orare they out
of pocket charges?
8) What is the major concern reported to the Dean or Parents' Board?
9) What is an acceptable standard

the questions are even asked. The
winner gets to be called "asshole,"
but do you know what they call a
woman student that wins? "Feminazi."
I watched the women in the audience laugh, while the men, including
myself, squirmed in their seats. Then
Guinier went on to explain how as the
female students were excluded from
the class discussion, they began to
fall to the bottom in class rank and
would therefore miss out on the best
jobs after graduation.
I could almost hear the men saying,
"I would never cause that to happen.
I'm not sexist. I'm not racist. Why is
she pointing her finger at me?"
I think the hardest thing in the
world to see is our own privilege.
True, most ofus aren't Hitler or David
Duke or the CEO's of a huge company oppressing strawberry workers,
but we, as upper-middle-class, white,
heterosexual men ofthe U.S., benefit
from the inequalities others haveproduced. We control the most powerful
country in the world, holding all the
most important positions in government and business. And if you believe, as I do, that the U.S. uses its
power to oppress the non-Western
world, our dominionextends around
the globe.
We are, in a sense, today's lords,
dukes, and kings, ruling over the rest
of the human race. This privilege
may have been handed down to us
from past generations, but we have
willingly accepted the inheritance.

Though Black People Can Hate, It Is the Institutions of White America That Perpetuate Racism
To the Editor:
I usually don't write the Phoenix
primarily because as an Alumnus
from 1977 the issues debated tend to
be ones that are ongoing (going on
since I was there!) or not particularly
interesting to me. But every once in
awhile something strikes my fancy
and this is one of those times.
I don't know Vincent Jones and I
am not familiar with his column, but
the responses to his March 21 column
on March 27 by J. Miller 'OO, B.
Schwartz '97 and M. Van Itallie '9B
have caused me to stand in his defense based on their responses to
whatever he said in his column.
Let me address Mr. Miller's letter
first, primarily because of its length
and content. It was totally inappropriate for your 7th grade teacher to
ask you to "invent" a definition of
racism when a perfectly good one
exists in the Fung and Wagalls Standard Desk Dictionary, 1984. As a
result, there are now X numbers of
students running around with a
warped definitionofracism. The definition is: "1. An irrationalbelief in or
advocacy of the superiority of a given
group, people, or nation, usu. one's
own, on the basis of racial differences having no scientific validity; 2.
Social action or government policy
based upon assumed differences."
How your definition, "racism is considering a person as a part of his race
instead of as an individual" came
from that is beyond me. Your definition is inaccurate and should be revised.
-Since you are a White and male
American and that will not change, I
am sure that you find it difficult to
imagine that their could be a monster
called "White America" out there.

Results

There are only individual "monsters"
who may happen to be White and live
in America e.g. Byron De La
Beckworth. If it were just individuals, then we would not have the problems of race in this country we do
today. Unfortunately, White America
has created institutions which embody the concept that Black people
were not, are not and never will be on
par with a White human being. The
actual wording has long been stripped
away, but the "idea" is still there and
perpetuated by individuals (with malice or without malice) who exist
within the system. For example, the
fact that there must be a Black History Month in order to insure that
Blacks are semi-included within the
history of this country is an abomination and a direct reflection of an
American school system which continues to discount the contributions
of non-white Americans. I would not
be surprised to find that the teachings
of Martin Luther King are only addressed during Black History Month.
Your criticizing of Jones's statement regarding monopolistic control
of the politics and economics of this
country by Whites is based upon
flawed logic and definitions. You
cited a few African-Americans as
leaders as if to say their presence
invalidates the monopoly. By definition, a monopoly does not mean the
total elimination of all competition,
but rather exclusive possession or
control. White America dominates
the political landscape in terms of
position and numbers while there is
no doubt that the economic scene is
almost exclusively White. Hence, the
lack ofeconomic/business leaders on
your list. Sidebar: my cousin is the

of Christmas Tree Survey Reveal

To the Editor:
At the end of last semester I sent
out an e-mail message to students,
staff, and faculty asking whether there
was general agreement with the
College's policy of officially banning Christmas trees from public
spaces on campus. Here are the results. Of 60 faculty and staff members who responded, 57 expressed
disagreement; and of the 395 students, over 90 percent disagreed with
present policy.
The poll brought some surprises.
The present policy was instituted by
a former president who in response to
a few students' protests stopped the
wife of a vice-president from decorating a tree in the Admissions Office
and then promulgated the policy. No
one can recall any input into the decision by students, faculty, or senior
staff.
Neither President Bloom nor the
Dean's Office was aware ofthe policy,
an indication that the institutional
memory resides largely in the faculty, several of whom commented
that they thought the policy foolish

who he is? No, it's not Cheaunalt
from AMEX and it wasn't Bob Holland from Ben & Jerry's.
African-Americans being racist is
truly a misnomer. They can hate, but
unless you control the institution or
the society it's almost impossible to
be racist. Maybe, it exists in other
countries, where Blacks control the
government and society but once they
step out from that country, America
andWhite Americabecome thedominant influence. Racism and hate are
linked concepts, but they are not interchangeable. I can believe that you
may not hate me, but that still does
not preclude you from being a racist.
I too believe that hatred is counter
productive to working out solutions,
but just because it is wrong doesn't

"acceptable."Why is it that you would
not expect a number of Blacks to
resort to the most base human emotion? On the one hand we are viewed
as something less than human and on
the other hand we are expected to
have a greater moral center than the
majority of White Americans.
Mr. Schwartz's letter is interesting
in that it illustrates a point; the need to
eliminate all differences in order to
accept other individuals who are different. I consider that the most bizarre concept yet put forth by a large
segment ofWhite America. Let's try
this one on for size. Don't let my

when first promulgated.
The result of the widespread ignorance of the policy was that those
who remembered observed the prohibition, while others on their own
initiative put up trees. So there were
decorated trees in Sharpies and Tarble
and decorations in the Dean's Office
and Personnel offices, but those who
created the "giving tree" received
instructions that forbade the representation of a tree. Several people
told me they remembered when the
Parrish parlors were beautifully decorated.
Most distressing were two phenomena I had not anticipated. There
was a widespread perception, particularly among staff but also among
some students, that there was no freedom of expression on religion at
Swarthmore College. Several individuals' memos expressed gratitude
for my alleged courage in speaking
out in what they perceived to be a
climate of intimidation. Staff members have not felt free to express
similar sentiments to mine to their
supervisors.

or feel that because of our differences
I don't eat, shit and sleep like you.
The differences are not the problem.
It is the checklist that the majority of
White Americans associate with it
that is the problem. Also your statement about lacking political power is
based on not knowing it rather than
not having it. How can you not have
political power? On your worst day,
you are not singled out because of
skin color and that in itself is both a
political and individual statement of
power.
In terms of Mr. Van Itallie's letter,
I can't say whether Jones was trying
to shame anyone into doing the "right
thing." He may be a talented writer,
but "he ain't that good." Guilt and
shame tend to be self imposed states.
You feel guilt/remorse because you
choose to react that way. If you and
others feel guilty then it may be that
you/them sense some wrong doing.
Why is it necessaryfor Black people
to admit to White people thatAmerica
is a better place racially than it was 30
years ago when surveys, etc. suggest
that in general, White America feels
we are worse off as a country? Since
we are the ones who are so-called
being included, shouldn't White
America be saying "thank God we' ve
at least started using a little of our
Black resources." I don't see how the
responsibility is ours to make you
feel good, about starting to undo
something, you should never have
done in the first place.
Well, I'm sure some will be inflamed about what I've said, others
confused and others surprised, but
keep writing Jones and maybe I'll
even get a chance to read your column sometime.

FEATURES
Nights In White Satin: Behind The Scenes At Sharples
By

David King

It's 4:25 p.m., and Deanna Thielemann
seems calm.
The Dining Services Coordinator sits
peacefully in the Big Room of Sharpies Dining Hall with an almost serene look to her.
She appears not to notice the Sharpies employees scrambling this way and that, or the
subdued ruckus emerging from the kitchen.
She is unfazed by her impending responsibility of overseeing the employees for the
evening or the fact that two employees are
out sick today. She merely sits at a corner
table, still and composed, with alighthearted
expression on her face.
Isn't she at all nervous?
"For special events, sure," she says matterof-factly. "But as far as, 'What will students
think?' No."
The dining hall, for the most part, is quiet.
The sun beams brightly as it begins to set
over a distant hill, and the mood in the room
is one of somber anticipation. A student
strolls lazily about the perfectly-aligned
tables, and a few employees taunt each other
jokingly, whileothers walk quickly back and
forth between the kitchen and condiment bar
with nervous but determined looks on their
faces. A soft din can be heard coming from
the serving area.
To the untrained eye, it may seem like the
calm before an imminent storm; but for
Deanna, it's routine.
"I was just going to go back into the kitchen
and check with them to make sure
everything's okay," she says with a stolid
face, barely revealing a hint of eagerness in
her eyes. It's little more than a pre-dinner
formality, but should a cook call out sick, she
or another manager could take over at a
moment's notice, as they have all attended
culinary school.
In addition to supervising the employees,
Deanna sits on the Dining Services Committee, which works with students to meet their
food preferences and nutritional needs, and
is always working on upcoming special
events. (In fact, she just returned from the
fabrics store to buy costume materials for an
upcoming event—though she won't say what
it is.)
She makes it clear that she enjoys it all very
much, regardless of the responsibilities she
has taken on since starting in December.
"We're all a team here. We're all food
people," she proclaims with a smile, before
rushing off to the kitchen.
.■■,,-.

4:35 p.m.
Nazma Alam Bangladesh prepares to man
her post at the dining hall' s rear door. Nazma,
who works as a card checker, seems somewhat quiet and reserved, but her shyness is
more than made up for by enthusiasm.
"We enjoy it," she says wholeheartedly.
"You guys are very good kids."
Nazma puts in over 26 hours a week but
has few complaints. Of the many previous

jobs she has held- including babysitting- she
insists this is one of her favorites.
"I always love to work in schools," she
adds, displaying a compassionate smile.
Nearby, Tony Agostinelli walks slowly
across the serving area floor,
also in preparation for the
evening. In his hands, he caries
a green sheet of paper with
meal requests from the health
center. Taking food over to the
nurses is one of his duties, in
addition to washing dishes.
Before starting at 11:45 AM,
Tony usually walks around the
campus, browses through the
library, orreads a little. He also
has some company on campus—his dad, Gus, works for
Buildings and Grounds.
"I remember the day I
started-Saturday, September
18th, 1982," Tony recalls with
a soft smile.Fifteen years have
gone by, and he's still at it,
diligent as ever.
A moment later, Jamie Wilson, who also works in the
dishroom, is seen readying her-

She looks despondently at a pan full of pasta

now two. Even so, she says, it will get busy as
the evening progresses.
A coworker approaches and
looks over Kathy's shoulder.
She hesitates for a moment; then,
after eyeing a reporter cautiously, nods her head and scurries away.

Dinner is in full swing. The
sky is slightly darker, and the
noise level is at its highest yet.
Students carrying loaded trays
flood the condiment bar from
every direction, while a steady
stream pours into the serving
area, each hand scrambling for
a remaining piece of silverware. A few students dawdle by
the toasters, and a great number
converge on the salad bar—but
nowhere is the crowd so impatient as by the ice cream bar,
where a large group of sweettoothed students anxiously
awaits a free scooper. It is there
that a shy Charee Borsello wearily unloads a tray of black and
yellow sugar cookies, much to
the delight of those on line.
"Yeah, everybody'sfriendly,"
Charee contends, after freeing

busy doing what you have to
do, that by the time you get
there, you usually miss it," she
says somewhat regretfully.

Night has descended on the dining hall, and
the general sentiment is one of calm and
fatigue. No one hordes the drink machines,
and the toasters are left alone. The hustle and
bustle has died down, and students begin to
file slowly up the stairs at a relaxed pace.
In the midst of a lull at Very Vegetarian,
Cass dumps a tray of mixed vegetables into
another one half-empty.
"I always work where the food is," she says
half-jokingly. "It's a lot of fun."
Cass, who has white curly hairand a pleasant wide-eyed smile, is all too eager to mention her fascination with the dining hall's
architecture.
"I like the building," she exclaims, citing
its facade and the way the stones are set as
having great appeal to her.
6:55
The sky is completely dark, and few students remain. A light bulb flickers in the
Small Room, where a student throws a piece
of food into a friend's hair, and others sit
lazily, chatting amongst themselves. Meanwhile, one employee removes containers of
jellies and sauces from the condiment bar,
and others wipe down counters and whisk
away leftovers. The sound of rock music
emerges periodically from an open kitchen
door, puncturing theotherwise quiet air ofthe
serving area.
The Big Room, by contrast, is alive. Students emerged in heated conversations shift
restlessly in their chairs, most with nearly
empty trays in front of them, all oblivious to
their surroundings. A cluster of deserted trays
sits conspicuously on a group of tables in the
corner, complemented by sticky tabletops
and scattered chairs.A couple of employees
with soured looks on their faces carry the
trays away, while others work feverishly to
scrub the tables. Among the latter group
stands Sarah Amesalu, armed this time with
a sponge, soapy water, and an optimistic
smile.
"If s busy," sheconcedes with a thoughtful
look. Sarah has her characteristic friendly
demeanor but shows signs of weariness as
she looks pensively around the room. Eyeing
a group of students, she explains how some
may stay as long as thirty or forty minutes to
socialize, study, or just relax. She adds that
employees have little recourse but to inform
students that the dining hall closes at 8:00.
"We'll finish like 7:30, [then] most of the
tables will be done," she says with a trace of
anxiety in her voice.
Though she knows she must stay an hour
longer, she is eager to get home. "I have to put
my baby to bed," she sighs, her face now
lighting up.
Sarah is then silent for a few seconds as she
takes a final look around the room. Soon,
though, she breaks from her gaze and is
focused back on the table.
"We get tired," she utters almost listlessly,
before turning back to her sponge.

Hustle Over to DuPont for a Scream of a Time
By Jeremy

In

Mathias & Julia Sable

contrast to the timeless themes

of

Shakespeare, this weekend brings up some
more contemporary moral issues in The
People vs. Larry Flynt. At the center of the
heated controversy over a raunchy magazine,
Hustler, is theever-contentious subject of the
First Amendment. Don't worry, the movie is
not mired down by boring court scenes, nor
does itoverdo the sexual aspects ofthe story
it portrays a trenchant and biting story of one
man who, by a bizarre twist of fate, becomes
a champion of free speech.
The movie focuses on the life of Larry
Flynt (Woody Harrelson), beginning with his
childhood in backwoods Kentucky where he
lives with an abusive, alcoholic father and
ends up dropping out of school. The story
then skips to the early 19705. Flynt has acquired a small chain of stripjoints that he runs
with his brother, Jimmy (Brett Harrelson,
Woody's real brother!). Flynt carries on relationships with a number of his strippers,
eventually meeting his future wife Althea
Leasure (Courtney Love), a hard-edged bisexual.
Dissatisfied with the profits of their business, the Flynt brothers start a small magazine, Hustler, which severely pushes the limits of public tolerance for obscenity. Nevertheless, the magazine grows in popularity,
and is soon being distributed nationwide.
Flynt is charged with libel and obscenity by
Rev. Jerry Falwell over a fake ad saying
Falwell had sex in an outhouse with his
mother; he takes his case all the way to the
Supreme Court. Flynt's attorney, Alan
Isaacson (Edward Norton), tries to defend
him, but Flynt makes this more difficult by
his outrageous conduct. What would you
think if you saw someone wearing a diaper in
court? The argument over limits on publishing pornography soon escalates into a debate

For the most part, Scream is entertaining,
scary, and funny. Though the movie is especially for those fans of Jason, Freddy, and the
other freaks, it is built around those horror
movie devices thateveryone knows and loves.
There are the happy-go-lucky teenagers, dark
nights, missing parents, and...well, the list
goes on. Yes, the movie is scary, as, many
times, the serial killer appears out ofnowhere
and hacks his victims to pieces. However, the
fact that the film is mocking its own genre
makes the killings more enjoyable to watch

(really!!!).
In Scream, Wes Craven has produced a
group of uniquely imagined, fun characters.
Drew Barrymore does not give "a performance thatrivals Janet Leigh's in Psycho" as
some television ads claimed. Leigh is the true
queen of "actresses who take small roles as
the bloody prey in horror movies." However,
Barrymore, in her five minutes on screen, is
very convincing, and sickly funny, as a bubbly, airhead high school cheerleader who
falls victim to the serial killer. Courteney
Cox, as an aggressive reporter who will go to
any lengths to get the scoop from Sidney on
the murders, and Matthew Lillard, as a dumbas-a-rock goof-ball, are very amusing. Finally, Neve Campbell, who owns the lead in
Scream, believably plays Sidney, who, faced
with memories of a horrible past, confronts
the present with courage, a keen wit, and a
ferocious kick.
Scream's finale is fun and clever, as the
house party becomes a gory gathering, and

What exactly is Rock for Choice?
Rock for Choice, a program of the

Feminist Majority, galvanizes the music

community to protect abortion rights and
women's health clinics. At each concert,
young people can register to vote and
sign petitions in favor of women's right
to get an abortion. Proceeds from the
concerts benefit the Feminist Majority
Foundation's National Clinic Defense
Project and theFeminist Majority' s Abortion Rights work.
The Feminist Majority Foundation's
National Clinic Defense Project, the largest clinic access project in the nation,
leads efforts to keep women's health
clinics open in the face of violence and
harassment by abortion opponents.
Through public education, community
organizing, emergency clinic crisis survival assistance, and a clinic violence
watch, the National Clinic Defense
Project has helped keep clinics open in
over 30 cities in 13 states which were
threatened with crippling anti-abortion
blockades and violence.
The National Clinic Defense Project
started in 1989 by mobilizing 10,000
volunteers in response to Operation
Rescue's threat to turn Los Angeles into

the first "abortion-free city."
The Project next applied these successful
strategies to prevent announced blockades and to visibly demonstrate the
strength of the pro-choice majority in
Buffalo, NY; New York City; and Houston. To date, the Project has mobilized
over 27,000 volunteers to assist clinics.
The Project assists independent clinics as
well as affiliated clinics, and nonprofit
clinics as well as for-profit clinics.
Who Started Rock for Choice?
Rock for Choice was founded by the
all-femalerock band L 7, music journalist Sue Cummings and the Feminist Majority Foundation in the fall of 1991 to
support safe and legal abortion. "We
wanted to do benefit concerts for an issue
we care passionately about—abortion
rights," says L 7. They hooked up with
the Feminist Majority to do the concert
planning and administration. The first
concert was held on October 25, 1991 at
the Palace featuring Nirvana, L 7, and

Hole.

Announcing the Second InternationalLeft Wing Film Series. For those ofyou who still have
not caught your breath from last year's series, take heart: our first film (April 10) will soothe
your soul and calm you down, as Kidlat Tahimik (Philippines) takes us into the surrealistic,
comedic, Marxo-Chaplinesque world of Perfumed Nightmare.
Though we are biased here, and prone to exaggeration, it is perhaps one of the few sure
things left in this world to say that this is simply the best film since Godard'sPierrot lefou,
and perhaps even the best film since Steamboat Bill, Jr.
If you can recover in a mere seven days from the absolute beauty and intelligence of
Tahimik's gem, you should most definitely schlepp yourselfto the next week's offering (April
17), Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, as the series moves from the Third World to the soonto-be-post-industrial internal Third World of Kentucky coal mining.
Hard on the heel's of this devastating portrait of worker's struggles and solidarity in the face
ofhideous corporate greed will follow a truly bizarre, recently resurrected cinematographic
tour-de-force, lAm Cuba (April 24). Bring the dramaminefor this one, since the camera never
sits still as you are whirled from the revolting heights of sugar-fed decadence to the euphoric
and hard-scrabble front-lines of the Cuban revolution. This Soviet-made film was suppressed
for years and was brought back to life by Martin Scorcese of all people (perhaps a closet
commie? Mean Streets as subversive portrait of decadent capitalism?) a few years back.
Ourfinal film (May 1) will be slightly less revolutionary in spirit, but what it lacks in outright
oomph it makes up for in understated gorgeousness: Alexander Kluge's pathbreaking, New
German Cinema-founding Yesterday Girl. This one stars Kluge's sister, Alexandra, as the
hapless Anita G., recently come to West Germany from the East, who tries to find her way
through a not all too welcoming West German landscape. Winner of prizes in Vienna, Cannes
and elsewhere, Yesterday Girl put the New German Cinema on the international film map.
So come on down to the series, put your feet up, and get a good dose of anti-venom to
Holly wood's mind-jellying poisonous offerings. We are not responsible forany revolutionary
optimism the series may cause.

All showings are Thursdays, 10 p.m., DuPont Cinema.

Have

you heard about the lat-

est toy craze? Surprisingly
enough, it's not the new

Barbie Teaches Skipper To Go
Potty action/adventure playset or
Power Rangers that can eat their
own flesh. The latest most coveted
toys are Beanie Babies. Basically,
they're hand-sized bean bags
shaped like animals. There are
something like 120 varieties and
new ones are constantly being introduced as older beanie baby
shapes are "retired," meaning they
are no longer produced. Beanie
Babies only cost five bucks a piece,
but some of the retired babies are
going for hundreds of dollars.
Now, I've seen these Beanie Babies in stores and I have to admit
that I'm a little perplexed by this
new fad. Beanie Babies don't do
anything. They just lie there limp in
your hand. Sure, they're really cute
and justheavy enough so that ifyou
throw them at your sister they can
really sting but soft enough that
they won't leave a telltalebruise on
her that could get you grounded.
But other than that, they're pretty
dull. They don't shoot. They don't
ooze. They don't poop.
No, Beanie Babies are nothing
like the toys we used to have. We
used to have great toys
like...umm...like...like Slinkies.
You remember Slinkies, of
course. Many, many happy hours
were occupied by those little metal
coils of unadulterated fun.
Well, as I nowrecall, they weren't
exactly happy hours. They were,
more exactly, frustrated hours. I
mean, you could only watch the
coil oscillate between your two
hands for a couple of seconds before needing something more.
And that something more was, of
course a flight of stairs. But then
you had to go on a search for a
miniature staircase or construct one
out of your father's heavy medical
reference books (I'm sure he was
pleased) because Slinkies are too
short to travel down a normal flight
of stairs. But even if you did manage to find some dwarf stairs, it
never worked anyway. Either you
didn't use enough wristmotion and
the Slinky would just stand there
on the secondplateau, or you would
use too much force and it would go
tumbling down the stairs.
And then as it tumbled it would
get all tangled up and as you tried to
liberate it from itself, you would
undoubtedly bend the metal out of
shape so that the Slinky was no
longer uniformly coiled. And even
ifyou put your father's entiremedical reference library on top of it, it
would never flatten out and stand
straight again. And who wants to
play with a retarded slinky?
Not to mention the fact that
Slinkies smelled weird. I don't understand whythey smelled so weird,
though. They were just coiled up
pieces of metal, right?But they had
thatvery distinctive odorthat would
get on your hand and was quite
difficult to get off because, as a
child, you wouldn't really think of
using soap and water.
Slinkies tasted weird, too. (And
if you're now asking why the heck
I know whatSlinkies taste like, you
really need to get in touch with
your inner child because you've
gotten way too old.) They had that
odd, sharp and tangy metallic taste,
sort of like your dorm room key.
(Don't ask.)
And Slinkies have been known
to get so ensnarled in your hair that
your mother had to cut them out.
Plus, they would pinch your skin at
every opportunity. But even with
their flaws, I'd take a Slinky over a
pathetic, bean filled marmot any
day.
But you must admit that a Slinky
certainly isn'tElectronic Battleship,
which I asked for every birthday
for about twelve years and never
received. Mom wanted to know
why I wanted a seventy-five dollar
game that I could play just as well
with a piece ofpaper and a pencil.
But mothers never understand. It

Women's Ultimate Frisbee

Swat Women Ruggers Tackle Temple
By

Jen Philpott &

Amber Halsey
On Saturday, Swarthmore's A-side

squad collected another victory and
extended their winning streak to 4-0.
The women ruggers dominated a
large, ferocious Temple team by a
score of 13-7. The plethora of victories is attributable to the extraordinary level of skill and determination
shown by the team as a whole.
The B-side squad did not come
away victorious and suffered from a
lack of fresh players. Many A-side
members were forced to combat in
both games after playing two grueling 40 minute halves.
In the first game, the first points
were scored by fab frosh fullback
Meghan Brennan who skillfully
kicked for points on a penalty play.
Soon after, brawny Becky Snyder
'9B single-handedly drove Temple's
entire forward into the try zone and
touched the ball down. Temple managed to score a questionable five
points in the second half while Swar-

thmore stood in amazement since the
ball was never actually placed on the
ground. The final try of the game was
scored by brash Beth Vose '99 and
aggressive Alexa Miller 'OO after a
series of runs and passes.
Jean-Claude (the French referee)
was appalled by the playing strategies of the Temple team; and he commented in an unintelligible French
accent, "You are off-sides 100 percent of the time." Temple displayed
an unusually atrocious amount of
vulgar language, including several
threats to Swarthmore players in addition to high tackles and dirty play.
The back line played an exceptional defensive game and ran the
ball through Temple's line repeatedly. In particular, assured Andrea
Barnett '97, back captain, made a ton
of tackles, taunting the Temple team
with her tough tactics. Clever
Courtney Clark '9B, fly half, and
jumpy Giovanna Giuliani '97, outside center, also handled the ball well
offensively and provided fierce resistance to Temple's weaker line.

Competitive Corinne Bright '9B
played in her first A-side game at a
new position, second row. Bright
and pumped Pia Houseal '97 provided the necessary push in the Swat
scrum against a comparably strong
opposing scrum. Bodacious Bridget
Arbour '9B was able to tackle even
the burliest of the Temple forwards.
In lineouts, Swarthmore's jumper,
assertive Amber Halsey '9B struggled
to catch the ball after Temple's savage jumper did her best to break
Halsey's fingers. Hanan Hussein '97
told the forward pack, "I told you we
could deflate Temple if we got
pumped enough, and we did. Only
the gameball was as pumped as us!"
The B-side score was 6-15; however, the score is not reflective of the
effort contributed by the Swarthmore
players. Facing an equally aggressive squad, compact Katie Jozwicki
'97 honed her hooking skills despite
a pulled neck muscle. Rugged
Rebecca Hover '99 was all over the
field, throwing in lineouts, controlling the ball in the scrum at her eight-

man position, and rucking hard.
Sprightly Sarah Cross '99, who played
in both games, demonstrated her virtuosity as a rugger by playing at second row instead of prop.
The back line was lead by experienced Elin Lisska '97. In addition,
Annie McCasland-Pexton' 97, after
conquering her thesis and the flu,
played with determination at flanker
in the first halfand wing in thesecond
and made an abundance of tackles. In
addition to being great kickers, cocky
Kira Cochran-Bond 'OO and killer
Kirstin Knox '99 ran and handled the
ball with a surprising level of skill
given theirrookie status.
This Saturday, the undefeatedSwat
squad will play both American University and Bryn Mawr College at
home beginning at 11:00 a.m. on
DuPont Fields. This weekend's competitions have the Swat ruggers excited at the thought of a 6-0 record.

Erin "Figgie" Figueira '99 promised
to dye her hair color garnet to celebrate should the women ruggers
extend their winning streak.

Men's Rugby Clobbers Widener and F
Sturm
Chris DiLeo

By Tony

&

The men' s rugby team evened their
season record to 2-2 last Saturday,
defeating Widener and Franklin and
Marshall at F&M. Because of a cancellation of an earlier game, both
Swarthmore and Widener traveled to
Lancaster to play a round robin tournament composed of40 minute games
with F&M. Swarthmore started the
day off against the host Diplomats,
who were big but slow. The Buzzards, fresh from a week off, may
have been well rested, but they were
not healed. Pete Zustovich '99 and
Cameron Geddes '97 both made rare
starts, and as a result the forward
pack took a little time to get comfortable in their scrums.
F&M had some speed on theirback
line, which showed early on, when
Iheir wing blocked a kick by Matt
Jacobson '97 and rushed it in for an
early score, giving the Diplomats a 5-

0 lead. Swarthmoreanswered quickly,
when off a F&M scrum deep in Diplomats territory, Jason Sturm' 97 tackled the scrum half, causing him to
expose the ball and allowing Chris
Jahnke '9B to pick it up and place it
down in the try zone for a score,
evening the tallies.
F&M's back line scored again before the half, when a F&M wing
picked up a Swat missed pass and
dashedinto the try zone for the points.
All conversions in this half failed,
and the score at the half was 10-5,
F&M.
As Geddes and Zustovich settled
in, Swarthmore's forward pack started
playing solidly, and the back line also
meshed after the break; and neither
lost a step for the rest of the day.
Swarthmore was unable to get on the
board for most of the half, but F&M
barely threatened.
Jahnke had a try waived off because of a knock on, and as the shortened half proceeded, the question

became whether the Evil Buzzards
would be able to score before time
ran out.
The forwards answered this question with threeminutes left, when the
penalty plagued Diplomats committed yet another infraction, this time
ten meters from the try zone. Swarthmore ran its penalty.
Off ofthe ensuing ruck, Elijah Porter '99 touched the ball down for his
first career try. The attempt by Tony
Sturm '99 at the conversion kick,
which meant the difference between
a tie and a win, snuck inside the right
goal post, giving the Buzzards the
lead and the game.
Swat got to rest during the next
game, which saw F&M avenge their
loss and beat Widener, 15-14. Widener was somewhat out of breath for
the next game against Swarthmore,
which was thoroughly dominant during this game, scoring four tries and
winning the game 22-5.
The loose forwards were quite ef-

&

M

fective. Dan Schwan '9B, playing
solidly as always, got the Buzzards
on the board early, scoring off a ruck.
Tony Sturm made the conversion,
and two more quick tries by the back
line put the game out ofreach. After
a textbook back line, Jason Sturm
looped around and got the ball from
Jacobson, and scored the first back
try of the season. Adam Blescia '97
added a try soon after, shedding defenders on a 20 meter dash to the try
zone.
In thesecond half, Swarthmore lost
the shut out as Widener's 250 pound
prop took a penalty from ten meters
out and drove into the try zone for
their lone tally. Schwan answered
quickly, adding his second try of the
day off a ruck.
In B-side action, the Buzzards
clinched the sweep, running all over
Widener in a game of sevens. Jerome
Bushnell '99 scored multiple times,
with Booth and Uche Eneanya 'OO
also getting into the try zone forSwat.

Witgert said, "They were a team we
could have and should have beaten.
We were fairly equally matched as
far as pitching and hitting ability, and
it is possible that we were better fielders overall." In the second game, the
offense was not there forSwat. Dunning and Alvarez each had two hits.
On that day, the team committed
seven errors. "We went from making
five total errors in seven games in
Florida to making more than five in
one gamealone Ynijcan't win games

defense. "Also, we really need to

every effort we can, even ifit requires
letting a ball hit hard at us hit us in

diving catches on grounders and pop-

ups. We all need to take it to the next

First Night!

Warmothers Travel
to Penn State
By Emily

Rice-Townsend

This weekend the women's Ultimate Frisbee team traveled to Penn
State for their fourth tournament of

the season. They finished 2-3, in a
roller coaster of a weekend at this
year's largest College tournament.
Originally, the Warmothers were
seeded first in their pool, but due to
last minute switches, they were added
to another challenging pool which
included Rutgers and Haverford.
Undaunted, the Warmother's began
the day with an opening game against
Rutgers. Despite Swarthmore's 5-13
loss, this was the highest score any
team had against Rutgers all day.
Next, the Warmothers played a
heartbreakingly close game against
Haverford. Swarthmore was down
by four points at the half, but they
came back and held the Sneaches at
game point for three points before
finally succumbing to a final score of
9-12. Courtney Harter '97 had an
impressive game with two scores,
three assists, and four defensive
blocks. Anna Sugden-Newbery '99
played hard and was particularly vital to the team's incredible effort.
After trouncing Syracuse 11 0, in
a game in which Katy Harrod' 97 was
virtually unstoppable with two layouts, two defensive blocks, one assist, and four scores, the Warmothers
faced their final opponents of the
-

day, Rochester. Cheered on by the
Swarming Earthworms (those occasionally cool guys that seem to endlessly follow the team around), Swarthmore sailed to a 12- 4 victory. Lena
Lowenthal '97 and Erika Baumgartner '9B turned on the heat in the
fourth game of a grueling day. Lena
made connection after connection
with her great cuts and clean throws.
She also had two layouts, two defensive blocks, one assist, and two scores.
Withher stern determinationand toweringheight, Erika was a strong force
in the end zone pulling down five
scores, and making three assists.
Carrie Bader '99 was hot on defense,
and Gabi Kruks-Wisner '99 controlled both ends of the field with
four blocks and four assists.
On Sunday, Swarthmore suffered
a disappointing loss to Penn State
with a score of 9-13. Courtney Harter
was deemed the team iron woman for
her marathon performance throughout the entire tournament. Courtney
watched only four points from the
sidelines during all five games but
ironically lost her pants seven times
for this achievement. Mandy
Hourihan '9B inspired the team with
her fabulous play despite a severe
knee injury.
The Warmothers will host their
next tournament, the Conference
Championships, during Parent's
Weekend.

Men's Volleyball
Suffers Tough
Loss to Rutgers
Bv

George Matula

In an extremely tight first set,
Rutgers' most prolific hitter swung
the ball into the waiting arms of
Swarthmore's tri-captain Matt
Sosland '97. The ball bounced off his
arms and into the opponent's court.
The first set ended with this block
and the first set going to the Swarthmore men's volleyball team 15-13.
The Swarthmore College men's
Club Volleyball team gave a valiant
effort in Monday's match versus
Rutgers Camden.For a while, it actually looked like Swarthmore could
beat this talented team. Swat started
out with some brilliant play. They
were hustling defensively and spiking powerfully. Their serves were
solid and effective. They almost gave
the first set away at the end with
several missed passes but managed
to preserve it.

However, the second and third sets
were different stories. It seemed that
most of the players had lost the fire
they had shown in the first set. Matt
Sosland's injury from a previous
match was re-aggravated and prevented him from playing front row.
But, tri-captain Paul Hsu '9B was a
defensive dynamo, sacrificing his
body at every opportunity. Even so,
Swat still lost the next two sets 2-15
and 4-15.
With an intensity born of desperation, Swarthmore fought back behind
Hsu's leadership. The great passing
returned and so did their potent offense. Swat fought off several match
points from 11-14 to eventually force
a tie at 15. However, a couple of
crucial mistakes prevented themfrom
winning the set. The set went to
Rutgers 15-17 and so did the match.
Swarthmore plays at Ursinus tomorrow away.

Garnet Tide Still Looking for Consistency
By

Frank Amar

The past few weeks have not been
kind to the Garnet Tide, with wins
coming few and far between. The
Garnet Tide has been able to put
together some good stretches during
games, but still lack the day in-day
out consistency needed to stay competitive.
After losing to Montgomery
County Community College, the Tide
settled in for a four game stretch
against conference opponents. Last
Thursday, the Tide traveled to
Chestertown, MD to take on the
Shoremen. Dave Giles '9B turned in
a workmanlike effort, pitching 8 innings and allowing only 3 earned
runs. However, the offense was nowhere to be found as the Tide could
only muster one run in dropping a 41 decision. The two teams completed
their home series the following day.
In that game, the Garnet Tide bats
reappeared from their one day slumber, erupting for 14 runs on 13 hits.
Jeremy Bonder '97 (3-4, rbi), Pat
Straub '97 (2-3,4 rbi) and Carlo Fitti
'OO (3-5, 4 rbi) led the way offensively. Bonder pitched 6 innings to

pick up the win, and Steve Farneth errors by first baseman Malkoun and
'OO held down the fort in the final one by rightfielder Joe Aleffi 'OO
three innings to pick up the save.

and put the game out of reach, a 5-2

Historical Victory
against Ursinus
By Jaclyn

Coutts

A few years back, when it was the
women's head lacrosse coach Karen
Borbee's first year here, she was
speaking to a good friend and fellow
lacrosse player who is a Ursinus
alumi. Karen made a bet with her
friend that during her fifth year as
headcoach ofSwarthmore's women's
lacrosse team, they would finally beat
Ursinus for the first time in the two
school's histories. This Tuesday, in
Karen's fifth year, her words proved
prophetic as Swarthmore walked
away with a 14-11 victory over the
Ursinus Bears.
The Garnet started the game with a
vengeance, scoring five goals in the
first ten minutes. Third man defender
Sam Peltz '97 had a great run down
the field into the attack zone and
made a great cut and found the back
of Ursinus's net.
After a time out, however, the Bears
came back into play and were ahead
(8-9) at the half. "You guys are
playing well out there," Borbee told
the team at the half. "We have control of the ball a lot of the time, but
we're not getting our shots off. Set
[the ball] up behind the cage and run
plays."
The second half was played ag-

gressively by both teams, keeping
the score within one point for much
of the time. The Garnet's attack did
an excellent job making connections
and moving the ballaround the Bear's
cage, keeping Ursinus defenders on
their toes. Scoring was lead by right
attack wing Holly Baker '99, whose
final goal tally was a stunning six
points. Captains Kristen Osborne '97
and Lia Ernst '97 each tallying two
for the garnet. Ch'uya Hornberger
'97, Betsy Rosenbaum '9B, Laura
Starita '97 and Sam Peltz '97 all
checked in with one.
Swarthmore's defense was lead by
Kelly Wilcox's aggressive play.
Kelly got several turnovers by fighting for ground balls, blocking and
stick checking. Jane Kendall'oo and
Kate Doty 'OO once again did an
excellent job in goal, teaming up for
eleven saves.
As of last week, the Garnets 5-1
record had them at ninth place in the
Conference and second in the region.
The rest of this week's games must
be played to establish where they
stand after this weeks victory.
Saturday, the Garnet will be traveling to Dickinson to meet them for
another CentennialConference game.
Next Tuesday Gettysburg will be
coming to our home field at 4:00 p.m.

Bats Come Alive
By

Jean Quinn

The Garnet played three doubleheaders against conference foes this
week. Although all the games resulted in losses for Swat softball,
the team is looking better than it has
in a long while. Bats have come
alive for the Garnet who are stringing hits together, and the defense is
executing more and more of the
routine plays that have caused problems recently. The Garnet are 2-18
overall, 0-10 in the conference.
Against Western Maryland, Swat
had an exciting, intense outing.
While they lost the first game 1511, Coach Cheri Goetcheus called
the team's performance as "the best
offensive effort this season." She
said, "As a team we hit .450 in the
first game. Mental mistakes led to
physical errors, but we didn't let
that make us fold. We answered
with offense each time we needed
to, except in the last inning where
we fell a bit short."
The offense was anchored by
Lurah Hess '99, Michelle Walsh
'9B, and Jean Quinn '99, all ofwhom
collected three hits. Combined, they
accounted for seven RBIs and 5
runs. Pitcher Dana Lehman '9B
knocked two runs in on a pair of
singles, and outfielderNette Witgert
'9B also had 2 hits. Apryl Dunning
'99 commented after the game, "I
came away from the game feeling

pleased that we had almost beaten
WM, usually one ofthe stronger teams
in the conference, and frustrated that
we had been so close, and then just
couldn't shut the door and get the

win."
In the second game, multiple errors hurt the Garnet. Mary Beth
Alvarez '9B said, "The pitcher in the
second game proved to be a challenge to our hitters, making it difficult for us to keep up. That was the
major difference. WM is one of the
best offensive teams in the conference. Because their bats are so strong,
we would have had to play errorless
defense to beat them. But, we didn't.
We also couldn't overcome the series
of bad calls from the umpires."
The team facedDickinson the very
next day, not giving the players much
time to rest. Dickinson routed Swat
in both contests, 13-6 and 8-3.
Goetcheus calledthe games the "most
frustrating double-header of the season." She said, "We stranded 15 runners in the first game alone. In the
3rd, sth and 7th innings, we left the
bases loaded. Not coming up with
that one extra hit to score a couple of
runs hurt us and allowed for a more
lopsided score."
Dunning and Quinn each had three
hits, and together, they scored three
runs and knocked in a pair as well.
Alvarez, Lehman, Witgert and Jen
VanderVeer '99 all chipped in two
