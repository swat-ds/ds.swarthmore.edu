Students Protest Against
Possible Immigration Law

College Remains Tax-Exempt
Local School Board Withdraws Appeal
By Evelina Shmukler

In recent months, colleges throughout
Pennsylvania have had their tax-exempt
status challenged. If this were to happen
at Swarthmore, annual donations could
fall and expenses wouldrise by $1 to $2
million, which could cause tuition costs
to skyrocket.
Such a scenario very nearly occurred
at another small college, Washington and
Jefferson College, in Washington, PA.
Luckily for the college, on Friday the
Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania
restored its tax-exempt status, which had
been removed by a lower court. Without
a tax-exempt status, institutions would
be forced to pay property taxes, and donations could not be considered tax-deductible. Such a move could drivesmaller
institutions out of business.
The Washington and Jefferson case is
representative of similar cases all over

the state, including right here in Swarthmore.
Swarthmore College, however, is also
protectedby theconstitutionalright granting "institutions operating for purely
public charity" (i.e. non-profit institutions) relief from all taxes. Still, the college has had to defend it's status on
several occasions since 1991.In thatyear.
the Wallingford-Swarthmore District
School Board filed an appeal to theßoard
of Assessors challenging the tax-exempt
status of a number of the College's properties. Swarthmore received a bill on
several properties and appealed to the
Court ofCommonPleas.The school board
lost there, but appealed to the Commonwealth Court, where in 1994 itlost again.
Rumor had it thattheschool board was
going to try again thisyear, but aTuesday
phone call calmed fears of more litigation. According to the school board's
attorney, the board has decided to with-

Although reassured by the board's recent move, Associate VicePresident and

Executive Assistant to the President
Maurice Eldridge said that the real issue
at hand has not been resolved.

"Such actions represent a widespread
devaluationof thenotionthat higher education is a social good," Eldridge stated.
"This is really the heart of the matter; it
has yet to be fully explored and is certainly not concluded."

Jason Zengerle

When Newt Gingrich stepped to the
podium after the Republican sweep of
the 1994mid-term elections, hepromptly
declared that he was going to erase the
legacy of the 19605. He and his party
intended to eradicate the failed social
policies, bleeding-heart attitudes, and
cultural excesses that, in their minds,
defined the turbulent decade. Not so fast
says Meta Mendel-Reyes, Assistant Professor of Political Science.
In her new book. Reclaiming Democracy: TheSixties in Politics andMemory,
Mendel-Reyes attempts to offer a corrective to the current view of the sixties; a
view that, she contends, is shaped largely
by the conservative voices that dominate
today's political debate.While acknowledging the threatening aspects of thesixties, Mendel-Reyes prefers to focus on
thedecade's more positive legacies; most
importantly, she pays attention to the
high degree of political participation that
characterized the sixties.
"We dwell upon only the negative aspects ofthe sixties," Mendel-Reyes says.
"It's a strange combination of amnesia
and distortion. Instead of remembering
things like the enthusiastic young civil
rights workers, we recall only a distorted
image of shotgun-wielding Black Panthers, as if that was all the civil rights
movement was about."
Mendel-Reyes discusses the ways in
which democratic participation was at
theheartofpolitics during the 19605. She
points to the civil rights movement, the
anti-war movement, the women's movement, and the New Left as political efforts that all emphasized the everyday
participation ofordinary people in activism and public life.
Mendel-Reyes's own life had a large
impact on the book. Though too young to
have been a participant in the struggles of
the sixties herself, Mendel-Reyes believes
she has inherited a part of the decade's
activistlegacy. After receiving amaster's
degree from the University of California
at Berkeley in 1974, Mendel-Reyes began her 15-year career as a labor and
community organizer by working with

the United Farm Workers and Cesar
Chavez. For four years she helped the
largely Mexican migrant workers form
their first union. After working as a field
representative for a service employees
union in the eighties, Mendel-Reyes returned to graduate studies in 1988 at
Berkeley and received her Ph.D. in 1992.
She came to Swarthmore in 1993.
"The sixties legacy of mass political
participation inspired me to get involved
in politics and support movements for
justice," Mendel-Reyes says. "This book
is partially the result of my wondering
why society didn't have more access to
the specific memories that inspired me.
I'm hoping this book will help put participatory politics back on the agenda."
By reminding Americans about the
positive aspects of the sixties, MendelReyes hopes to aid activists in their efforts today. She is quick to point out that
she is not a "sixties fogy" advocating a
return to the decade, but rather hopes to
use the decade as a teaching tool for
future activists. Mendel-Reyes is excited
about the prospects for mass participatory movements in environmental and
immigration politics, and she is inspired
by the activism ofher own students. She
points to Swarthmore students' participation in the Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living and the Coalition AgainstXenophobia as two examples

The Women' s Soccer team entered the

Phoenix Opinion

In the past week, members of the
Swarthmore Civil Liberties Union and
the College's international student community have worked together to raise
awareness and support about immigration issues. Specifically, the coalition is
protesting H.R. 2022, also known as the
Smith Bill, which is currently being debated in the House of Representatives.
The Smith Bill, introduced by Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas), addresses issues of both legal and illegal
immigration. The bill proposes tooreate
an annual cap of 330,000 on family immigration, to remove 5000 employment
visas, to increase border patrols, to create
a national identification card to ensure
that federal legislationbarring the hiring
of illegal aliens is enforced, and to establish secret tribunals which will use information to deport so-called "alien terrorists."
The Senate version of this draft legislationby SenatorAlan Simpson (R-Wyoming) proposes a thirty percent surcharge
on the wages paid to alien workers to be
put into a federal fund towardeducation
in the United States.
Under the leadership of Jude
Uzonwanne '9B, the coalition of concerned students has asked students to
contact their Representatives and Senators by calling the Capitol switchboard to
express their opinions about this pending
legislation. In order to make iteasier for
students to do so, the students posted
"talking points," or suggestions for conveying their views succinctly. They divided their concerns into the following
categories: due process and relief, employment/labor issues in H.R. 2022, and
family issues.
The students feel that legislators
should, according to what the students
posted, "split the bill. Congress should

deal with immigration enforcement issues first, and not unfairly blame legal
immigrants and refugees for public perceptions about illegal immigration by
cutting admissions levels." Vladimir
Bilcik '97, an organizer of the campaign,
noted that the bill "can target almost
anyone who is not a permanent resident
or citizen."
The economic implications of this
policy extend to such corporations as
Microsoft, which fear that they might
have, to pa v much more for highly-skilled
workers who immigrate fromother countries. Such companies might relocate to
othercountries in order to reduce personnel costs, thus increasing unemployment
among all American workers.
Bilcik said, "It is a smartly written
bill...because it calls for these measures
in the name of national security." However, healso notedthat"Americans don't
realize that thisbill will jeopardizethings
this country promotes...likerefugee status."
According to Jagath Wanninay ake '96,
another organizer for the campaign. President Al Bloom sent a letter to Congress
on thebehalfof the S warthmore community and Maurice Eldridge, Associate
Vice President and Executive Assistant
to the President, faxed a message to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Newt Gingrich and to the Pennsylvania
Representatives.
Wanninay ake and Bilcik were disappointed by the lack of participation and
concern among the student body about
immigration issues. Bilcik believes that
the bill will pass, and says that the reaction to the display near Parrish Parlors
"shows the apathy of students on campus
towards immigration." Wanninayake
notes that this issue"hasn'treceivedmuch
press in the mainstream media, and as a
result, didn't gain momentum in the student body.

should have played the Black Squirrels
of Haverford on Sunday, but because the
two teams are playing later in the season,
they opted to not play each other. In a
steady, soaking rain the Garnet fell behind early and could never recover, suffering a disappointing 1-0 loss. In the
same poor weatherconditions, Haverford
defeatedBeaver 1-0. After its two victories Haverford must be considered an
early favorite in the season ending Hood
Trophy battle between the Garnet and the
Fords. Following the Swarthmore game
the team felt that if the
playing conditions were
better that they would
have come away with
the victory. Additionally, one player noted
that the two competitive games that the
Quakers played in the
tournament should help
prepare them for the
upcoming

The format of the
Seven Sisters Tournament was such that the
teams that won on Sunday last year had a
chance to win thechampionship this year. The
4 teams in the championship bracket were
Wellesley, Vassar,
Smith (the defending
champion) and Bryn
Mawr. On Saturday a
freshman-dominated
Vassar defeated an

team 3-1. This was unquestionably the best

In addition, Wellesley

This Tuesday, September 19 at 4:00
pm. President Al Bloom made the first of
many planned public appearances. In a
session informally entitled "Meet the
Prez," he spoke with students in Parrish
Parlors for an hour and a half.
Justin Hall '97 approached Bloom with
the suggestion ofholding his office hours

in public space last week. Bloom was
enormously receptive, and it seems that

students were as well. Over a dozen
Swatties drifted in and out in the late
afternoon, with others popping theirheads
in to inquire about the next session.
Discussion began over the mural that
once existed on one facade of Old Tarble;
students wondered why it had been replaced by a wall of gray. Suggestion of
students creating a mural were deferred

by Bloom, who noted that further discus-

sion on the issue would be necessary.
Tension over the Dave Matthews concert was still evident; some students were
incensed that it had been scheduled during Rosh Hoshanah weekend.
The Social Affairs Committee (SAC)
explained that it scheduled the concert
before sundown, in accordance with Jew
ish tradition as explained by members of
Ruach, the campus organization for Jewish students, but it needed to schedule for
sundown in Jerusalem. When SAC arranged for a collection to discuss the
issue, the time selected was during
Shabbat dinner.

Aslanian Joins Swat As VP
for Finance and Planning
By Will Quale

The newest face on campus is not one
of any first-year student or new professor. Paul Aslanian, the new Vice President for Finance and Planning, started
work at Swarthmore this Monday, having taken only a "short breather" after
finishing his work at Macalester College
in St. Paul, Minnesota. Aslanian brings
to the Swarthmore community over two
decades of experience in managing college finances, as well as all the excitement and anticipation of a student.
Aslanian's career path deviates far from
that typical of people in his position.
Instead of moving up the business ladder
in financial administration, Aslanian
transferred into the business offices from
the faculty. He had been a teacher in the
economics department at Macalester for
seven years when, in 1974, he was asked
to help out the administration by serving
as treasurer. This "temporary position"
lasted twenty-one years, much to
Aslanian's surprise. His experience as a
teacher has given him a unique insight

into his job: "It is a big help to know the
school side [of finance]," he says. Before
starting his teaching career at Macalester,
Aslanian was a CPA and a computer

analyst with Boeing.
After twenty-eight years of working at
Macalester College, Aslanian's contact
with Swarthmore began last November
when a search committee, headed by
Harry Gotwals, Vice President in charge
of Alumni, Development, and Public
Relations, first contacted him about the
open position. After "hemming and hawing" for a few months, he announced to
the committee in January that he had
accepted their nomination. He had contemplated job offers in the past, and due
both to the intrigue of working at
Swarthmore and his age, he felt that if he
was going to make a career move, this
was the time to do so. After two or three
trips from Minnesota to Swarthmore for
interviews, Aslanian was hired. "I was
amazed by the number of faculty and
staffmembers who cared enough about a
Vice President of Finance to come and
talk to [me]."
Of the actual job change, Aslanian
said, "MacalesterCollege was a wonderful experience for me, and I'm proud of
what I was able to do there. But the
Swarthmore job is a step up."
The responsibilities of a new Vice
President for Finance and Planning are
numerous. He works closely with Meryle
Rinker, Director ofFinancial Operations
and Controller; Sue Welch, the Treasurer, who works with the Swarthmore

endowment and budgeting; Laura Talbot, Director of Financial Aid; and Human Resources,

the department in charge
of personnel and benefits. In addition,
Aslanian works with President Bloom's
staff on budgeting issues.
What will happen to Swarthmore's
endowment now that Aslanian is here?
Macalester College's endowment increased tremendously during Aslanian's
tenure as Treasurer, but that increase is
mostly from substantial gifts by Dewitt
Wallace of Reader's Digest. Of
Macalester's current $5OO million endowment, "about eighty percent came
from Mr. and Mrs. Wallace." However,
Swarthmore's endowment of $536 million (as of June 30) is in very good hands.
"We have anicely diversified portfolio...
[lt even includes] international investments and private partnerships. It's very
well managed." The actual investing is
handled by money managers hired by an

of whichis allocated for scholarships and
salaries.S war thm ore's(andMacal ester's)
situation is quite unusual: while most
other colleges in the country are concerned with retrenchment, Swarthmore
is actually steadily adding to its programs and faculty. With such a stable
endowment, "here we can deliberate
about future planning rather than move
from financial disaster to financial disaster."
Aslanian's recent college experiences
come not only from his work at Macalester
College, but also from his two children.
His daughter attended Grinnell, a small
liberal arts college "a lot like here and
Macalester," while his son went to Notre
Dame and is now at Stanford pursuing a
graduate degree. Both of his children are
excited about their father's new job and
are "very supportive."
It appears that Paul Aslanian will fit
into the Swarthmore community quite
well. "This is a special place," he says of
Swarthmore. "You don't impose things
on a community like this." One of the
reasons he was attracted to Swarthmore
was the high degree of interest everyone
has in the community, and Aslanian says
he is definitely interested in maintaining
this atmosphere. His wish is that there be
"[no] barriers between staff and faculty
or administration and faculty." Such barriers would intrude upon Swarthmore's
central purpose in the eyes of Aslanian.
"There is no question why it is ranked so
highly," says Aslanian, "Swarthmore
exists to serve young people."

Concern arose over the fairest way to
satisfy Swarthmore's Dave Matthews
fans after last week'sPhoenix poll stated
that 68% of students plan to attend the
concert, indicating that over one hundred
students could not be accommodated in
the seven-hundred seat Lang Perforning
Arts Theater.
The tickets were distributedat theField
House Sunday evening; the box office
was supposed to open at 8:00 pm, but
since the line started forming as early as
5:00 pm, it opened early at 7:15 pm. At
8:20 pm, after tickets had been distrib-

uted to everyone present, there were still
150 tickets left, according to Charlie
Mayer '9B and Giovanna Giuliani '97,
Co-Coordinators of the Social Affairs
Committee.
A campus-wide broadcast on the computer network, sent at about 9:00 pm,
announced that tickets were still available at theField House. Beginning Monday, tickets could be obtained by E-mailing Giuliani. The ticket distribution was
widened to include everyone on campus:
faculty, staff, and administrators. However, Giulianiestimated that aside from a
small number of tickets reserved for
Dave's production crew and approxi-

mately ten faculty members, everyone
attending will be students. As of early
Thursday evening, allbut ten tickets were

distributed, and requests had "slowed to
a trickle."
Dominic Sagolla '96 announced that
the a cappclla group Sixteen Feet will be
opening for Dave Matthews at Sunday's
concert In the first issue of "Footprints,"
the group's electronic newsletter, Sagolla
said: "Way back in January, my friend
Charlie Mayer, of NPR fame, handed
Dave a tape of us doing "Ants Marching," and he smiled to his tour manager,
saying 'Hey, check it out! They're singing our stuff at SWARTHMORE!'"

ations, and again raised the point of degrees of protection. After the pair of
assaults lastyear, Bloom said theCollege
was on the verge of encircling the campus with a fence and installing a checkpoint for all thosewho wished to enter it.
Short of that, absolute safety is elusive.
A few in the audience were New York
natives, and both they and Bloom agreed
they felt safer in the Big Apple. "It's the
silence," Bloom observed. Hall suggested
a Swarthmore soundtrack for those unnerved by the silence at night
On the subject of lighting, I proposed
the school supply dorm rooms with overhead illumination, especially because of
the recently instituted halogen lamp ban.
Bloom seemed decidedly underwhelmed
at the risk of bedclothes inflammation
and did not commit himself to a solution,
saying that the College "should not be
duplicitous" in creating and enforcing its
rules.
The meeting finished on a light note as
Al was invited to the Straw Bale house
for a full fledged tour some Saturday.
The meeting was cordial, at times effective.
Hall viewed the meeting as a lesson in
community: "While no single person can
shake the foundations, by navigating the
web, you can at least find an explanation
for why things are screwed up." More
informal "Meet the Prez" sessions are
planned for the future, but might take
place in different venues.

PA.. .from page 1
It is also College policy that partygoers have a choice of non-alcoholic
beverages ("such as cider, sparkling
grape juice, ginger ale"— water alone is
not enough) and substantial food, at a
party where alcohol is being served.
The PA is to ensure that party hosts
comply with this rule as well post a sign
stating, "You must be 21 years of age to
consume alcoholic beverages in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."
Skills learned during a training session
should allow the PAs to execute their
duties easily and efficiently. They will
be easily identifiable at a party, and will
fill out a simple report afterwards.
Originally the PA program was sup-

posed to get underway last semester.
This didnot happen because, as Goundie
explains, "There were a great deal of
logistics that needed to be ironed out

before we would implement the program, including how would we pay the
PAs (no money was budgeted as the
program was conceived well after the

budget process), what sort of training
was required, and how to recruit students." By the time some students had
been recruited and money secured, it
was already late into the semester. Thus,
a pilot run of the program was launched
last April at a fraternity house party, and
Goundie was pleased with the results.
During October, the plan will be put
into full action.
Being a Party Associate is a campus
job requiring students to "party watch"
for four-hour shifts. Training of the first
group of twenty students will take place
on Sunday, October 1 at 1:30 pm. Any
interested persons are asked to contact
the Deans' Office. The primary source
of funding is the Deans' budget- ironically enough, money collected from
fines around campus, including those
issued for holding parties without permits.

Swarthmore's operating budget is the
"primary beneficiary of the endowment;"
it totals about $2l million annually, most

Josh Silver '97 had a major complaint
over deferred maintenance in its basement. After a history of clogged toilets
last year, he returned this semester to
four clogs in the last fourteen days. Tensions are high between him and maintenance staff, but profound repairs have
been promised.
Bloom expressed displeasure over the
apparently poor communicationbetween
students and College maintenance staff,
noting also that long-term maintenance
issues should be brought to the attention
of Larry Schall, Vice President in charge
of Facilities and Services.
Due to therecent incidentof assault on

Students and Faculty Members
Face Off In College Bowl Match
A Faculty Member's Perspective
By Scott Gilbert
A noisy crowd of quick draw intellects
and Alex Trebek-wannabes overflowed
into the aisles of Kirby Lecture room for
the annual student vs. faculty college
bowl game. The faculty team, "The Evil
Buzzers," consisted of Tim Burke, Assistant Professor of History, Scott Gilbert, Professor of Biology, Associate
Dean B ob Gross, andPeter Schmidt, Professor of English. The student team contained Fred Bush '9B, Ed Conn '99, Bob
Griffin'99, and JeffLockman '9B, whose
combined SAT scores can probably only
be computed by scientific notation.
The faculty team was able to immediately and precisely give the atomic mass
of rubidium, the names of five consecutive twelfth century popes, the resting
places of the last three poet laureates of
America, and names the current managers of all AFC teams. The students, however, won the match by being able to
name Barbie's younger sister, compute
the number of carbons in a glucose molecule, and list three of the five members
of the musical Jackson family.
Things got rowdy when a toss-up question was announced as counting for three
rather than thirty points. The faculty refused to answer, as receiving three points
was beneath them. The students went
wild, threatening to boycott classes and
organize a sit-in at the Deans' office.

Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, and
the faculty team was calmed down. At
the end of the session. Gross counseled
the faculty team that even though they
lost, this does not make them bad people
and they could still feel good about themselves.
Moreover, teachers should be happy
when their students perform better than
them. After the game, everyone shook
hands, put on their clothes, and left..

A Student Perspective
By Fred Bush
The college bowl student-faculty match
started on a down note: Scott Gilbert,
captain of the faculty squad by virtue of
his silly hat, got the first question and
then Tim Burke the next. Things threatened to turn rowdy when Mike Pan '97
unfurled his "Bob Gross, you're going
down!" sign.
However, the student's considerable
knowledge of useless things like Mickey
Mouse, Barbie, and Canada soon began
to tell. Tim Burke could only look on in
despair as the students went on to get 2,
count 'em 2, bonuses dealing with African history. Though Bob Gross struck
with a quick answer on "Playboy Club,"
it was too late. The students won, 400200.

After consoling themselves with large
quantities of sugary snacks and cola, the

faculty, joinedby quisling Ed Cohn, took
on some of the audience members in a
second match. This team proved nighunstoppable. The faculty narrowly triumphed this second time around.
Emboldened by this student-aided success, mild-mannered English professor
Peter Schmidt yelled, "We'll get you
crazy kids next year!" as he departed.
Though the faculty fled to avoid another shellacking, student diehards stuck
around for yet another match, and ate
many more sugary foods. A good time
was had by all. The rumors of students
and faculty playing the "Beverly Hills
90210 drinking game" are scurrilous and
false.
College Bowl is always looking for
new recruits. If you blast through Jeopardy, scare your friends at Trivial Pursuit, have an intensedesire to put professors and Ivy Leaguers in their place, and

Letters to the Editors

Chalkings Serve A Purpose Scheduling of Concert Signifies Lack of Respect for Religion
To the Editor:

To the Editors:

Queer invisibility is a serious problem. There
are people on this campus who are not aware that
there are real Queers in the world, and that we are
people they'll run into at Swarthmore. And there
are not-yet-out folks who have real concerns that
they're the only ones. And there are frosh (like
myself) who had no such problems, but just need
to know that there is an active Queer community
here.
For all those reasons, and any more, LBGA
folks did some chalkings a few weeks ago. They
,were intended to welcome Queers, returning and
new; and to share the factof our existence with our
heterosexual friends.
The chalkings were not intended to be shocking
or confrontational. Only if one is offnded by the
very concept of homo and bisexuality could one
be bothered by such graphic messages as "queers
study science here." What is offfensive about the
fact that bisexual, lesbian, transgender and gay
students live and study on this campus?
Ms. Philpott was on the right track up until the
end of her tour. She saw chalkings as a "public
forum", and believed that "we all have a right to
express ourselves via chalk." No matter what
your personal biases about themessage, thatshould
hold true.
The article failed to mc ntion which chalkings
offended the parent—there were two distinct
groups that week, one produced (quite vidictively,
it seemed) in response to the other. Let's be
clear—LßGA folk had nothing to do with the
bestiality alliterations. She failed to point out
exactly which message she found shocking and
offensive. As she attributes the chalkings to
activism, I can only hope thatshe was referring to
the Queer-realted chalkings, and not the (rather
odd) bestiality set. If she does believe that the
latter was activism, I'm afraid I just can't argue in
that level.
Ms. Philpott questions the anonymity of the
chalkings. Would she ask that after every phrase
there be a signature? Would she have the same
concerns if the message were diffrent? Maybe
"Party in the Olde Club"? Nobody was hiding
behind anything, it just doesn't seem reasonable
to attach names to chalked messages.
Ms. Philpott likens the offensive chalkings to
yelling before asking calmly. First of all, we were
hardly yelling. There was no demand made, only
a welcoming wish for awareness of Queer presence on campus. Secondly, that is exactly what
every oppressed minority has been accused of
when demanding rights and awareness of issues.
It was said to, and of, and at theBlack Civil Rights
movement in this country. Women were told we
ought to be more rational, etc.
Everyone is welcome to their opinion, and I'm
sure someone is bound to be offended by every
message. If we all took intoconsiderationoffending visiting parents, we'd never advertise parties,
let alonebe political. Queer visibility is important
to the psychological and physical well-being of
straight and Queer students here, and chalkings
are one important way of being out.
—Becca Hover

We, the members of the Ruach Board feel that
a mistake has been made in the scheduling of the
Dave Matthews concert at 4:00 Sunday, September 24,1995. This conceit will overlap with the
beginning of Rosh Hashannah, one of the holiest
Jewish holidays of the year.
Itis first ofall necessary to clarify exactly why
we think that this is definitely a mistake. It is not
simply because it is inappropriate thatthe conceit
has been scheduled at this time although this is
one factor. Nor is it because a large sum of money
which comes from our tuition is being spent on an
event that Jewish students who plan to observe the
holiday cannot attend, although this too is an
issue. Essentially it is because Jews who plan to
observe this Holy Day have been excluded from
attending a major, highly publicized, eagerly anticipated, once in a lifetime campus event. Thus
Swarthmore has displayed a lack of respect for
one of the most essential observances of the Jewish tradition.
We do not claim that this disrespect is particularly aimed at the Jewish community. We do not
feel that there is any ill will directed towards the
Jewish community. This occurrence has its roots
in the lack of respect for all religious lifestyles that
is pervasive at Swarthmore.
This is not the first indication thatsuch a lack of

respect exists here at Swarthmore, but other examples are not within the scope of this letter. The
primary purpose of this letter is to increase aware-

of this disrespect by pointing to a particular
instance. We would also like to point out that this
lack of respect is clearly in conflict with Swarthmore creed whichproclaims tolerance and respect
for diverse lifestyles.
The purpose of this letter is not to request an
apology. In situations like this apologies often
serve primarily to make the apologetic parties feel
better, without providing any real comfort to the
recipients of the apology.
We request, instead, that you take some time
out of your life to ponder your own attitude
towards religion, as well as the general attitude of
this campus. Do you think that the attitude towards religion expressed by this incident fits in
with the creed of tolerance?What do you think
about your friends who make sacrifices for the
sake of their religious faith or religious communities? Do you understand and respect these sacrifices? The mistake has been made, and cannotbe
erased. Please take some time to think about these
issues in the hope that greater understanding will
reduce the frequency of similar mistakes.

International Students: Give Credit Where Credit's Due
To the Editors.

In last week's Phoenix article, "Swarthmore
News Ranking", Ben Fritz wrote that
"It has been revealed that some schools have
counted unfinished applications in calculating
admissions ratios and have left InternationalStudents and Special Needs students out of SAT
averages. However, Swarthmore only counts completed applications and ifanything is overly scrupulous in reporting statistics."
I strongly object to this statement as it implies
(though does not directly say) that International
and Special Needs students have lowerSAT scores
on an average, and are responsible for Swarthmore not being ranked 1 in the country. This is
quite untrue.
It is true that most foreign students who come
from non-English speaking countries do have
reacts to US

#

lower Verbal SAT scores than most domestic
students. However, on an average, they usually
have much higher Math SAT scores.These scores
more than compensate for any lower Verbal SAT
scores, and so the International students end up
with higher scores overall. (A littleresearch at the
Admissions office will tell you this).
I also think thatit is unfair, and quite untrue to
say that a person with a special need will have a
lower SAT score than any other person. I do not
see how a special physical or emotional need can
influence a person's intelligence. After all, we are
all at Swarthmore, and we all should have been
pretty good to get in here in the first place. I
believe that writers should cross-check theirfacts
before they say anything which, not only means
what it says, but also has a lot of implied meanings.

Women's Teams Have A Long History at Swarthmore
To theEditors:
The article in the Sept. 15thPhoenix, by Rachel
Gutman, is so ungrounded in facts, and so lacking
in knowledge of the history of Swarthmore, that
my first comment is that I am most grateful that
not many Swarthmore Alumnae (that means
women alumni, Ms Gutman) will read it
My next question is why a student at Swarthmore
would do such an abysmally poor job in research

and why the editor wouldn't ask some questions
and thus put together a better paper.
SwarthmoreCollege, Ms. Gutman, was founded
as a college for men and women, in 1864, and

there has been equality since then, far beyond the

The Great Swimsuit Controversy Examined
By Tara Zahra

was 9:00 P.M. on a Saturday, that noman's land between the early movie at
the LP AC and the acceptable hour to hit
the Olde Club. It's not like I checked the
TV Guideahead of time. It was on when
I walked in the room, and I had no chance
of accessing the remote.
I'm talking about the 1996 Miss
America Pageant, which was broadcasted

live into millions of homeslast weekend.
In case you hadn't heard, those ever ingenious pageant directors came up with an
added gem of suspense this year. They
decided to let you, the American people,
make a crucial decision: should, or
shouldn't the swimsuit competition be
continued? All it took to have your voice
heard was 50 cents and a little patience;
lines were jammed for the entire two
hours.
I have to admit that as I sat watching
the pageant with a predominantly male
crowd, I almost felt obliged to ramble
about all of the obvious reasons why the
swimsuit competition is ridiculous and
sexist. And then I realized something.
The argument in itself is ridiculous, and
I'm pretty happy that things turned out
the way they did, with 79% voting to
keep the annual parade of flesh. I'd have

voted for tradition.
The problem with beauty pageants is
not that they judge women on their "fit-

about millions of dollars worth of scholarships.
Even Hillary Rodham Clinton mentioned
a similar statistic whilereceiving an award
from the reigning Miss America at the
White House last year.
This reasoning is supposed to somehow make the pageants pro-women. But
I remain unconvinced. After all, do
women really need another incentive to
sell their bodies for lots of money?
I'm sure plenty of women have put
themselves through school by dancing
on table tops at night or posing for beer
ads. I would definitely not say that any
such activities, or their supporters, are
"pro-women", simply because they recognize and pay women for their "talents".
Furthermore, if we take the swimsuit
competition away, is the contest any less

Plus, there's still the
"poise in evening wear"
segment to fall back on,
for those who feel threatened the intel-

lectual ring of the first two categories.
Competitors will no longer be judged on
how well they walk on a runway in skimpy
bathing suits and high heels. Instead
they'll be judged on how they good they
look in a tight dress. And let's not forget,
all contestants will still be required to
dance around in skimpy sequined leotards and tap shoes in between Clairol
Commercials.
Now, I'm not suggesting that the current categories be replaced with more
substantive tests, such as "LS AT Scores,"
"poise in a high stress corporate environment", and "ability to endure 'HellWeek'
at the Citadel." Because then it wouldn't
be a beauty pageant. It would be another
resume contest, just like the thousands
that women can already enter on equal
grounds with men.

Faculty Viewpoint: E. Can Everbach

I'm saying that the pageant should be
accepted, or rejected, for what it is. The
attempt by the pageant to 1) gain media
attention 2) gain ratings points and 3)
validate itself through the phone poll was

Science Is Not The
Enemy Of The Earth

far more insulting than the swimsuit com-

petition itself. It was akin to asking a
crowd in a bar to approve of Prohibition;
about as enlightened and sincere as the
smiles of the contestants after hearing
that they'd lost.
I think Phil Hartman got at the heart
of the pageant issue when he said something along the lines of "if they ban the
swimsuit competition, you can always
turn to Baywatch to see women in bikinis."
Sexism didn'tstart withMiss America,
and the great swimsuit controversy will
have little impact on my life or the lives
of women around the world. Frankly, we
have better things to do and more important fights to pick.
So before the pageant ended, before
the results were tallied and revealed
amidst a carnival of lights and hype, I
picked myself up and headed down to the
swim party to indulge in a little pure
hypocrisy.
There I was treated to a night among
friends, mostly spent making superficial
judgments about the looks of the various

ment has always been unusual, if not
bizarre, in the taxonomy of undergraduate education nationwide. We occupy a
kind of Darwinian niche, like the
Galapagos Finches, with very few other
programs in direct competition. Unlike
the big engineering universities, we do
not even try to offer the myriad of
subspecialized course topics (e.g., "As-

Environmentalist!!, Science, andTechnology have always had a complex and

difficult coexistence, and nowhere more
so than at Swarthmore. Many Swarthmore environmentalists see science and
technology as the causes of most environmental problems, and seek a return to
a pre-technological or even pre-industrial world in which humans live in harmony with nature. This distrust of technology is shared by many Americans,
who demand (through their elected representatives) that the work of scientists
and engineers be carefully monitored and
regulated, lest a doomsday bomb or killer
tomato be unleashed on the world. The
caricatureof themad scientist, of course,
predates Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, and
is still a staple of Saturday morning cartoons. It is no wonder that we grow up
suspicious of those who seek to "play

inventions can neverreally becontrolled.

fanatics to go so far as to kill scientists

engineering curricula. Indeed, the very
idea of an engineering department at a
small liberal arts college raises eyebrows
among our ivied sister institutions, yet it
is one of the features that distinguishes
Swarthmore from other small colleges.
Even if you have never entered Hicks
Hall except to take an exam in French or
to attend a Religion class in the Mural
Room, the existence of engineering on
campus indirectly influences you by shaping the culture of this place. Engineering, I would argue, is as much a liberal art
as Classics or History in that it seeks to
tap human creativity to solvehuman problems for the benefitof humanity, and so
it deserves its place here.
Rather than thinking of nature as composed of the forests, lakes, and mountains, environmentalists should view our
own environment, with its mix of human-made and non-human-made components, as natural. People are part of
nature, and although we have made mistakes as a civilization, we feel the same
kind of selection pressure that nature
always applies to living systems. I believe, for instance, that the recent resurgence ofenvironmentalism is thenatural
consequence of the industrial and postindustrial world we have created, and

week two respectable newspapers yielded

the demands of the so-called
Unabomber to print his anti-technology
manifesto.
As a faculty member who has taught
environmentally-oriented courses with
technological content, I have felt the ire
of those who question the use of technology to solve environmental problems.
Adopting the view of the world-as-organism, they argue that it is a moral
wrong to cut down a forest to save a
human population, and that any activity
that seeks to improve the lot of people at
a cost to "nature" is misguided. Since the that we shall find new solutions to the

New European Art Exhibit at PMA PANDORA'S PSYCHIC PREDICTIONS
By JohnFreeman
Last week the Philadelphia Museum
of Art made it even more difficult to defend sleeping till
noon with an OldeClub hangover. The grandreopening of
its renovated wing of European art from theRenaissance
through 1850 marks the first
time in the past three years
that the PMA has had all of
its permanent collectionopen
and accessible to the public.
And with a first ever exhibition of photography by Tina
Modotti (sponsored by Madonna) just opened, and
Constantine Brancusi and
Cezanne retrospectives in the
works for this school year,
the Museum's free before
1:00 deal ought to be hard to resist.
In spite of this year's stellar special
exhibitions, it is the reopened European
galleries which set the tone for the
Museum's worldclass devotion to chronicling and preserving the history of art and
civilization. Located on thesecond floor
opposite the Medieval art, the newly
opened galleries feature paintings by artists such as Bronzino, Poussin, Rubens,
Gainsborough, Turner, and Ingres, as

well as sculpture, tapestries, furniture,
and a wealth of decorative objects in
silver, ceramics, and glass. The balance

rooms were reconfigured, cleaned and
repainted, and re-lit. In total, the whole
process cost $l2 million.
Walking through the new
galleries is indeed much like a
trip through time. A visitor
may cross the hallway from a
turn of the century English salon and duckinto a Pennsylvania Dutch kitchen. Among the
highlights of the reinstalled
wing are a gallery devoted to
French Renaissance architecture and architecture sculpture,
a suite ofrooms displaying neo-

The Birth of Venus by Nicholas Poussin

between works in variousmedia and their
juxtapositionwith period interiors is carried out to a degree unparalleled by any
American art museum.
The reinstallationof European art from
Renaissance through mid 19th- century
was part of a three year project to reinstall the Museum's entire collection of
pre-20th century European art. In addition to treatment and conservation of 251
objects, over 80 galleries and period

classical sculpture and decorative arts, and a widerrepresentation of 17th- century Dutch
paintings from the Johnson
Collection, the third largest in
the world, which are new displayed in galleries adjacent to
the Museum's 17th- century room from
Haarlem.
Among the new exhibition spaces
are galleries devoted for the first time
exclusively to costume and textiles, with
an inaugural display of 16th- and 17thcentury textiles; colonial Mexican paintings and talavera ceramics; 18th century

works better as cinema verite than as a
compelling urban crime drama. Rocco
Klein's investigation is slow and often
repetitive thisis not a fast-paced flic. A
noticeable flaw is that the camera is so
busy trying to make sense of the murder
and examining the core story, that Mr.
Lee fails to give much insight into the
lives of these characters beyond their
connections to this murder (something
that would have been very helpful in
understanding Rocco Klein). The film
could use some domestic scenes or some
"regular" life. I mean you don't even see
the dockers macking!
Clockers, like much of Mr. Lee's previous work, draws heavily from the seventies. From the thick yellow typography of the opening credits to the often
grainy quality of the film, I get the feeling
that the director is invoking the spirit of
the seventies to portray a nineties reality.
Whether borrowing from that era or making films directly about that time (such as
Lee's previous film Crooklyn or the
Hughes Brothers upcoming Dead Presi-

Clockers (***)
After sitting through too many trailers,
including the grievously misplaced
"White Man'sBurden," the screen turns
black, themusic begins slow and elegiac,
and we are shown a montage of dead
black men with exposed bullet wounds.
The pictures are shocking, brutal and
sad, then cut to the heart of the tragic
space you entered for thenext two hours.
The film is Clockers, Spike Lee's latest
directorial effort and an honest lament on
the hopelessness and despair thatcharacterizes our inner cities.
Based on Richard Price's novel of the
same name, the film is centered around
Strike Dunham (newcomer Mekhi
Phifer), a 19-year-old black teenager who,
along with his crew, spends his time
"clocking" (selling drugs around the
clock) in the courtyard of a Brooklyn

"[the seventies] are perceived as a timeof

the pressures faced by the dockers, yet
he is unwavering in his insistence that

Strike acknowledge responsibility for his
actions.
The performance that the film is
contigent upon, however, is Mr. Phifer as
young Strike. This film is about his
struggle, his war. He is trapped in a
world of drugs and death which he literally can't stomach (he has a painful ulcer). Strike's idealism in the face of such
obstacles is the film's plea for hope. His
passion for model trainsis a metaphor for
his desire to escape from the life he is
leading. Clockers offers him no solutions, but it does not deny him hope. This
is a fascinating film which is well worth
a look.

Where Locals Eat Their Burgers
By Jessica Gorman

When I discovered that my exchangestudent friend likes hamburgers and
milkshakes, I said we'd have to go to
Charlie's. "Charlie'sT' Jason said.
"What's Charlie's? It couldn't be as
good as In-N-Out."
And so I began another quest against
In -N-Out, the drive-thru chain ofchoice
in Southern California, to prove yet again
that Charlie' s hamburgersreign supreme.
Following my first trip to In-N-Out, last
semester, my LA-area friends proudly
asked me if it my cheeseburger wasn't
the best I had ever tasted anywhere.
Well, it was okay, I replied, but it wasn't
Charlie's.
I was verbally attacked. Iwas mocked.
I was redeemed when one ofmy taunters visited this summer.
Yep. You guessed it.
Charlie's was unlike
anything he'd ever
tasted before (and he's
hard to please, too).
Now was my opportunity to go two-for-two
against In-N-Out. But,
honestly, In-N-Out isn't
even really worthy competition.
Charlie's is a Delaware County tradition.
I tried explaining this to
my California friend
before we got there.
Charlie's is celebrating

My grandmother still eats there.
After squeezing the Fury, the '76 Sport
edition (not a car; a boat), into one of the
last parking spots, we squeezed ourselves
into the only standing room available in
Charlie's, which was by the door. A
woman behind the counter called over
the heads of customers in front of us to
ask what we wanted to drink, and my
companion ordered a large Coke. Not
too bad, for not being a local, but not
perfect. Still, he hadn't screwed up yet.
I ordered a black & white.
As customers ahead of us finished
requesting large orders of burgers and
shakes for take-out, we got the Coke and

Then came our major faux-pas.
"What'll you have?" interrupted our
discussion, and Jasonorderedhis double

behind the counter, stared as I debated
whether I should correct the problem or
explain that Jason'snot from around here.
Bunny's responded first, resolving my
dilemma: "We don't have lettuce.".
So we ordered the burger without lettuce, and I ordered two cheeseburgers

milkshake to stop his endless In-N-Out
babble. His eyes glowed as he began to
sip through the straw, pausing only long
enough to ask "Whatis this?!?" and "This
is good!"
Charlie's shakes are unlike milkshakes
almost anywhere. They are thick, but not
ice cream (too often ice cream tries to
pretend it's a milkshake). A black and
white shake is made with vanilla ice
cream and chocolate syrup (other places
with good, but not as good, black and
whites are the Dairy Cottage in Springfield and Nifty Fifties). A b&w is sweeter
than a chocolate shake, but not as rich as
one. It's a taste that needs to be experienced.
Soon, though in awe of the shake,
Jason continued his oh-so-ignorant raving about In-N-Out cheeseburgers. I figured he would find out soon enough, so I

at the busy counter.

Here you could find
tattooed bikers with their kids, softball
team members, senior citizens, people on
their way home from the office, workingclass locals and high school kids. There
was one four or five-year-old wearing an
imitation nativeAmericanheaddress with
brightly colored feathers.
Finally, the moment arrived. The two
white plates were placed in front of us. I
was already eating whenI looked at Jason,
who was unenthusiastically looking at
his double cheeseburger. I told him to
order two singles, but he didn't listen to
me. Eventually, he picked uphis burger
and took a bite, and then another and
another. Between mouthfuls, all he
muttered was, "W0w...w0w..." Whenhe
was done, he ordered another.
And so the "transformation" or "conversion" (as Jason described it later) was
complete. Never again
will he thinkof a burger
the same way. In-NOut and other hamburgers are "just mortal," but Charlie's are
"heaven." In an attempt to be descriptive,
at a loss for more words
than these, even 24

paintings of views ofVenice known as

Museum's famous holdings of 18th-and
19th-century British portraits and landscapes.
Perhaps the most dazzling display of
tHSrPMA's curatorial and conservation
skills are thesuiteof 18th-century French,
English, and American period rooms.
The cleaning of all period woodwork and
plaster ornamentation, the installation of
new curtains, and better lighting make
the rooms sparkle as if ready to house a
baron's grand ball. This total presentation of paintings, sculpture, architecture,
and decorative arts and textiles in one
room reveals the museum' s dedication to
historical authenticity.
A pleasing affect of traveling in between these period rooms and other galleries for the visitor will be a sense of
cross-cultural influence and overlap. As
if traveling through an artistic map of
Europe, one can feel the history of art
without having to read voluminous patronizing wall texts. The great 18th-century London drawing room by Robert
Adam, for example, tastefully presents a
wealth of French, Italian, andDutch paint-

beginning in the late 18th- century and
the many international crosscurrents between Europe and Philadelphia in the
Federal period are also explored.
The central role played by Philadelphia not only in the political and economic history of the 18th- and early
19th-century but also in the arts during
that period is particularly evident in the
reinstalled wing, which draws upon
works of art collectedand commissioned
by Philadclphians and contrastslBthcentury French and English drawing
rooms with one grand Philadelphia town
house, as well as juxtaposing the latter
with a humbler Pennsylvania German
kitchen form the nearby countryside.
Several works by 18th-century painter
Benjamin West, bom at the Benjamin
West house on campus, highlight
Philadelphia's contribution to the artistic world.
Throughout the installation process,
the museum has kept up a full exhibition
schedule featuring shows on Japanese
Design, the Barnes Collection, the John
Cageexhibit this summer, and also opening the same day as the European wing
was the first ever comprehensive exhibition of thephotography of Tina Modotti

(1896-1942) in the Philip and Muriel
Berman gallery across from the museum
shop. Modotti's beauty, radical politics,
and association with politically motivated
vanguard artists Diego Rivera, Jose
Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro
Siqueros has somewhat obscured the lasting affect of her original aesthetic on the
world of photography.
Among the 118 prints amassed from
52 public and private collections, perhaps the most powerful and relevant are
Modotti's lyrical images of Mexican
workers and peasants. In these images,
Modotti fuses her aesthetic interests with
her social concerns, going beyond the
world of art for art's sake.
In addition to its collection and traveling exhibitions, the Museum holds a regular program of movies, lectures, and sundry cultural performances during extended Wednesday night hours. After

Kathak Dancer Teaches at Swat
By Emily Will its
When I asked Swarthmore danceprofessor Sharon Friedler about yesterday's
master dance workshop with Kathak
dancer and choreographer Antonia
Minnecola, she explained that, "[The
workshop] being [described as] a master
class doesn't mean that masters take it. It
means that masters teach it." Friedler, I
soon found out, was not exaggerating.
Antonia Minnecola's beautiful dancing
was as masterful as her workshop was
fun.
Minnecolabegan the workshop by asking us to acknowledge the floor as well
as the people around us, as is customary
in Kathak Dance. She explained that
when she began studying Kathak dance
in her early 20's, her teacher would accompany her with his voice. During the
workshop Minnecola chanted along with
her own movements. She pointed out in
the workshop thatthe words arein fact a
part of the dance, sometimes telling a
story, and other times telling her body
how to move.

Minnecola's dancing style ranged from
graceful to athletic. She explained that
sty les will v ary withinKathak dance, just
as they do throughout India. Minnecola
used her arms and hands to express the
rhythms thather feet created on the floor.
She encouraged us to concentrate on details such as our eyes, wrists and fingers,
which are as important as the legs and
arms in Kathak dance.
Minnecola explained thatKathak dance
can be either pure or narrative. The narrative dances tell stories, both through
the music and motions. Kathak dance
originated in northern India and combines both Hindu and Muslim cultural
elements. It was part of the daily Temple
ceremonies in ancient India. Many elements of the dance remain unchanged.
Sita Fredick '96 said that she enjoyed
theKathak workshop because she thinks
it is important to learn about a variety of
dance forms. Fredick, a dance major,
said she believes that dancers can benefit
from a diverse dance program. She said
that trying a new type of dance is "like
eating a new food."

VeetiTandon '96 agreed. She said, "I
loved [the workshop]. It is wonderful to
see that the Swarthmore Dance Department is bringing these different styles of
dance." Tandon is trained in
Bharatanatyan dance, which comes from
southern India. She said that because
there are many different types ofIndian
dance, the material in the workshop was
completely new to her. She added that
there were similarities in the two styles of
Indian dance, such as the emphasis on the
eyes and hands.
Not all the students at the workshop
were experienced dancers. David
Moskovitz '96 said that he enjoyed watching the dance as much as participating.
He said, "I don't think most people appreciate dance as an art form."
Minnecola will be performing at the
Lang Performing Arts Center on Saturday night with world-renowned tabla
player Zakir Hussain. The performance,
called "Rhythmscape," will include percussionists and dancers from the Philadelphia area. The concert is free and
begins at 8:00 p.m.

Swarthmore Students Participate
in the Fight Against Poverty
By Ben Maulbeck
Empty the Shelters (ETS) is a studentrun organization at Swarthmore dedicated to combating poverty and bridging
gaps. For many Swarthmore students,
poverty may seem to be distant and unreal; as member Jen Cox '97 says, "It
becomes easy to believe what we're told
in the media, and just to have
misperceptions about people, and I think
it's really important that groups likeETS
exist to try to bridge thatgap, to enable us
to developrelationships with people who
[we] normally wouldn't have the opportunity [to know]."
According to member and
founder Beth Green '97, the
group established three means
for achieving their goals at their
organizational meeting last week:
(1) direct action/services, (2)
campus education, and (3) selfeducation. Green emphasizes the
interdependence of all three of
these goals. None of the goals
can beachieved without the foundation that the other two provide.
Louise Rodriguez, author of
the book about gang life in California
called Always Running, and himself a
former gang member, will be speaking at
Swarthmore on November 2 to help educate the campus about youth in inner
cities. Madeline Kramer, President of
National Welfare Rights Union, is also
scheduled to visit and lecture at Swarthmore this November.
ETS, along with several other groups,
will also be taking part inPoverty Awareness Week (formerly known as Hunger
and Homelessness Week) on November
13-17, again working at educating
Swatties about poverty. Several members of the group will also be making a
road trip to a conference in Boston on
November 10.
ETS began taking direct action this
year when they visited a group of 35
homeless families staying in an abandonedchurch in Philadelphia. The group
is staying there not only to provide temporary shelter for themselves, but also to
protest homelessness and to insist on
being given affordable housing in the
city. There is a 15-year waiting list for
subsidized housing in Philadelphia. The
shelters are full and poorly developed.
ETS assists with food and other services
and adds its voice to those demanding

The Swarthmore ETS group is only a
smallpart of a larger National Organization. Jen Cox says, "It's an organization
of students and young people that was
founded about five years ago in Philly to
figure out what the role of students and
young people could be in the struggle to
end poverty. ETS exists on a variety of
levels: as a national organization, at
local sites in specific cities, one of which
is Philadelphia, and at college collectives
such as Swarthmore's. ETS holds Summers for Social Action every summer in
a different city. The first Summer of
Social Action was held in Philly five

students who participate in it
As Janice Gallagher '99 said
after herfirst meeting, "Out of
all the meetings I've attended, I
was most impressed with ETS,
because it combines community service with political action."
Cox describes howher sevenmonth tenure with the group
has affected her: "I've learned
a lot about poverty and what it
means to be poor at this time in

years ago. Students then went from there

to form affiliates in different cities. Just
recently, thetrend is for the students to go

back to theircampuses and form Campus
Collectives. Over the last year students at
five or six different colleges in the Philadelphia area have formed Campus Collectives which work on their campuses.
Swarthmore, Villanova, Bryn Mawr, La
Salle, Saint Joe's, and University ofPennsylvania are the Philadelphia area colleges that are involved."
The Swarthmore Collective was
founded last fall after Green participated
in the Summer of Social Action of that
year, at about the same time as other
colleges in the area were forming their
own collectives.
Cox describes the National Organization: "One of the national projects of
ETS is called the Break the Media Blackout Campaign. The idea is that there is
growing poverty in this country, but at
the same time there's alotofhatred being
directed towards poor people, and a lot of
scapegoating of welfare recipients in
national politics and national discourse.
So there's a lotof classism and racism in
the national discourse. There are a lot of
myths about what poor people are like,
about what welfare recipients are like,
that they're all lazy....What we're seeing

thought I would develop relationships
with: welfare recipients, homeless
people—people with a variety of life
experiences. I've thought a lotabout what
the purpose of a society is and what the
purpose of an economy is. Should it
strive to meet the needs ofall? On what
basis should people be included in a
society? Who is it that our society rejects, and why? I've just thought a lot
about how we perceive people and how
we perceive their worth in our society
and kind ofreworked my own prejudices
and become more critical towards the
prejudices and perceptions that are promoted in the official and the national
discourse and how that affects how we
deal with people and how we reject
people."
ETS has no formal hierarchy, but there
are about 10 core members who perform
organizational roles. About 40 people
attended the first meeting of the year,
abouthalfofwhomwerenew. Thegroup
welcomes all new members; meetings
are on Tuesday nights at 9:00 PM in the

and Johanna Peters-Burton.

What's Rampant African Monkey
Loving Disease Got to Do With It?
Kate: Those of you who are fans of
Swat's big movie tradition, the annual
showing ofThe Graduate, will be glad to
see that Dustin Hoffman returns to Swat
cinema this weekend in the spring '95
blockbuster Outbreak. This is a really
fun movie, and I'm guessing that, althoughI saw it on video, it would be a lot
more fun on the big screen. I've heard
rumors of some fairly mellow friends of
mine jumping clear out of their seats in
the theater.
Outbreak, also starring Rene Russo,
Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and
Donald Sutherland, centers around the
introduction of a deadly flesh-eating, organ-melting, bleeding-out-the-eyes-inducing virusinto theUnited States.When
a small town is infected and quarantined,
Sam Daniels (Hoffman), a medical doctor and colonel working for the U. S.
Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, and
his ex-wife Robby Keough
(Russo), an M.D. working for
theCenter forDisease Control,
are called in to contain the virus.
Daniels, under orders from
friendand superior officer B illy
Ford (Freeman), is also saddled
with the responsibility of keeping the U.S. Army from looking bad throughout the whole
mess. In the process of investigation he discovers (big surprise) government corruption
and cover-ups, and must reconcile his government obligations with his persona] ones.
You're not going to find anything earthshatteringly original in
Outbreak, but it is entertaining. Look
for Patrick Dempsey as Jimbo Scott, the
token idiot-at-fault, whose trip to Zaire
justmight explain Dempsey'sproficiency
for the tribal dancehe so deftlyperforms
in the classic 1987 film Can't Buy Me
Love. Overall, the performances are average, as is the dialogue (although Morgan Freeman is awesome, as usual), but
there are just enough gross-out and government corruption scenes to keep it interesting.
Carl: I found rather Outbreak enjoyable as well. The thought of our government working on a secret biological
weapon is scary, but both possible and an
ingredient for a good story. The work
done in tracking down thevirus and protecting the town produced an attractive
and interesting plot And for our piece of

useless information this week, while I
found Hoffman excellent in his portrayal
of the good doctor, theroleof Sam Daniels
was originally intended for Harrison Ford.
I wonder how the film would have
changed with Ford fighting the evils of
corrupt government again.
Now, Saturday night's film is no less
exciting. What's Love Got to Dowith It
stars Angela Bassett and Laurence
Fishburne as Tina and Ike Turner. The
film is based on Tina's autobiography, I
Tina, and chronicles her life, struggles,
and triumphs as she rises to fame. After
a brief look at Tina as a rebellious, yet
talented, child singer, itbegins withTina's
(Bassett's) early singing career with then
husband and musician- songwriter Ike
(Fishburne) and leads up to the establishment of her solo career in the early eighties. It's a really fascinating story detail-

cult movie to watch. Anyone familiar
with Ike and Tina's story is aware thathe
was an incredibly abusive husband to
her, and Lawrence Fishburne is just a
little too convincing an actor to make me
very comfortable watching the film.
Aside from its disturbing (but reportedly
accurate) violent nature, the film is a
really interesting look at the life and
career ofTina Turner (and I say this as a
non-fan). Both Bassett and Fishburne do
outstanding jobs, and I just love the early
soul/blues/R&B scenes. See the movie
(unless you're in a particularly strong
men-suck sort of mood, in which case it
would be a really bad idea), just be warned
that it is disturbing.
To wrap up, Carl feels that Outbreak
deserves at least a bowl of oatmeal. Kate
agrees on the amount of oats, but specifies that it's one of those bowls of really
fluffy oatmeal with little substance that you eat anyway
just because it's got so much
brown sugar in it. Carl gives
Tina's endearing story in
What'sLove Got to Do Witklt
a whole bucket o' oats, while
Kate holds at another bowl of
oatmeal, thekind you know is

of the fact that it's not exactly

ing not only the history and success of

her musical career, but also a triumphant
tale ofher personal life in overcoming an
abusive marriage. You also get to learn
things aboutTina that you might have not
known before, such as her involvement
withBuddhism. Bassett received an academy award nomination as well as agolden
globe for her role as Ms. Turner and I'm
going to say that I think she did an extraordinary effort in playing the part one
of rock's most energetic performers.
Check out Bassett's biceps to see how
she really tried to emulate Tina word
has it that Angela had problems keeping
up with the dancing Tina had in her stage
performances. Really, a good flick, and
to top it off, you get to watch Tina perform the title song.

Swarthmore Student Volunteer Firefighters
Make Backdraft Look Like Child's Play
By Giridhar Srinivasan

Until recently I only knew two things
about the campus volunteer firefighters:
they run like possessed people whenever
that ridiculously loud horn sounds down
by the field house, and they were really
noisy and authoritative at 1:00 in the
morning during the Parrishfire last year.
However, after talking to a few of them,
I realized that there's a lot more to it than
we outsiders really think about. For
example, these people risk their lives
more times in a week than most of us do
during our whole lives!
So why do they do it? "They must be
crazy," you probably think (just look at
them on any given day together at a table
in Sharpies). "No more crazy thananyone
else here!" is ofcourse what Rob "Hoss"
Eberhardt insists. But that still doesn't
explain why they do it "Initially it's an
adrenalinerush," says Scott Freisen, "but
later, it sort of becomes a part of you."
"I always saidthat! wanted to risk my
life for someone else, and I thought that
this was a great way to do it," say s Charlie
"Chuckles" Mayer.
Although not all of them really fight
fires, the more experienced ones actually
do go and fight fires inside buildings,
while the less experienced ones are
involved in the no-less-important tasks
of helping out with water supply and
ventilation.
Most of the firefighters join during
their freshmanyear (although several do
join later on in their Swat careers) and
continue right through their senior year.
Actually becoming a full-fledged fire
fighter is a fairly long process. You're
first a "probee" for a year (on probation),
during which you do a lot of the support
tasks. You later go on to "get your green

stripes off," and then, after taking a test,
you "get your white stripes." (The test is
conducted by placing the trainee in a
pitch black room where s/he mustrepair
a specifically-created problem, and then
emergewithin a certain amount of time.)
Once you pass the test, you become a
full-fledged firefighter. A member of
the few, the proud, the department that
puts Backdraft to shame.
Although there are not too many fires
in Swarthmore, the firefighters often get
called to assist with other fires in the
area. They hardly ever miss any fires,
and Mayer said that the only one he has
ever intentionally missed was, "when I
was writing a final last fall, and just as I
was about to get up and run, my professor told me to stay."
"Fires almost always occur just on
those nights when you 're really tired and
just want to lie down in bed and have
nothing to do with it.But if we tried to fit
it into our schedule and plan it out, we'd
never be able to do it. It's doing it at these
random times whichis half the fun of it,"
says Scott.
One of the major fires in which the
department was involved was a large fire
ona ship in theChester Naval Yard, over
the summer, during which "the metal
was so hot that it was almost impossible
to get close to the ship, but we [the Swat
Fire Department] managed to put itout,"
said Rob with a gleam of pride. "We
were therefrom 8:00 PM toabout3:ls in
the morning."
"More often," he adds, "we just respond to a lot of false alarms which
usually take less than half an hour."
"Of course, the biggest thing that has
happened in recent times was when we
went to Georgia to help with the flood
relief a couple of summers ago," said

Gabe Ross, who went on the trip. "We
were there for a week, and it was really
tough work. However, I really got to
know the officers in the department really well, and it was a really special
bonding experience, even better than the
ones we normally have."
"Every training session and fire is a
really special bonding experience because we have to trust each other," says
Freisen. Mayer remembers a time when
he and Ross were involved in a big fight
down at the firehouse, and suddenly got
a call. As they were riding on the truck
together, they made up, and, as Mayer
wryly said, "Hey, if he died, I didn't want
it to haunt me later."
One wonders why they keep at it if it's
so much work and if it's so tough.Mayer
of course says that it's now a part of his
way oflife. He has joined the department
near his home, where he did some work
over the summer. Ross and lan Chang
were fighting fires over the summer in
Wyoming, while Scott Freisen and Rob
Eberhardt stayed here over the summer
partly because they really loved "being a
part of a team which does so much work
for the community," as Freisen says.
An incident thathe always remembers
occurred when he was fighting a fire in
Chester around Christmas, and they had
to break into a house to see if the fire had
spread. He sadly remembers, "pushing
down a cupboard to get to the fire and
seeing gift-wrapped Christmas presents,
which were being hidden from the children, fall all over the floor. It later made
me thinkabout how much I have and how
fortunate I am in the wake of other
people's sorrow. The fact thatI can really
help out and make a difference in other
people's lives is really what keeps me

going."

WEEK IN
REVIEW

By Jennifer Philpott

The women's rugby team is in high
gear this week, as they prepare for their
first game this Saturday against Rutgers.
The team normally only practices three
days a week, but they have pushed themselves to five days this week. All of the
players are learning new skills and perfecting previously learned ones while
running hard, sprinting lots, and getting
as fit as possible.

The upcoming match
against Rutgers is a
highly amticipated
one, and the captains
are optimistic about
their chances for a
win.
The upcoming match against Rutgers
is a highly anticipated one and Swat's
captains are optimistic about their chances
for a win. Swarthmore's A side will take
the field with 15 experienced players,
while Rutgers reportedly only has eight
returning players and 35 rookies waiting
for their first chance to play. The women
ruggers have been scrimmaging welland
expect to be more than adequately prepared for their first game.
Given the amount of preparation that
theruggers have put into this Saturday's
game, they would really appreciate a
good showing of spectators. The A-side
game will begin at 11:00AM on Dupont
field with the B-side immediately following. The men's game will begin
shortly after the end of both women's

tiethe score at 11 -11. Huge serves by cocaptain Nancy Rosenbaum '96 and Deena
Bahri '9B and a thunderous kill by
Stickney keyed the rally. However, the
serving was not the consistent weapon it
usually is, and three consecutive service
receipt errors gave the game to Widener.
Similarly, in the second game the Garnet had to fight back from a five point
deficit to tie the game at 9-9. Widener
seized a 13-10 lead after several Garnet
mental mistakes. The team was able to
fight off two game points before a Widener hitterpounded a kill through a Garnet block.
It seemed like the disappointment of
losing the first two games after fighting
so hard had broken the team's spirit.
Capitalizingon servicereceipt errors and
setting mistakes, Widener cruised to a
11-3 lead. However, the lead was then
quickly cut in half by several good Garnet serves and some Widener errors.

Women's Cross Country Races at Fordham

By Charity Miller

By Danielle Wail

This past Saturday, the Swat Cross
Country Studettes went on a rampage
over the hills and dales of New York
City's wondrous Van Cortlandt Park.
Fordham University hosted this great
race, which attracted a plethora of topnotch Div. I institutions, including
Villanova, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and
Cornell. Despite the intense level of
competition staring the Amazon women
directly in the face, the Swat pack managed to emerge unscathed and in high
spirits.
Once again, the fleet feet of Becky
Riskey '9B set the pace for the Garnet
Tide. Riskey finished sixty-third overall, in an impressive 20:21, out of a field
of over two hundred runners. She was
closely shadowed by Alison Schirmer
'97, who, after sitting out last week's
alumni run, was hungry for a taste of
competition. She put forth an extraordinary effort, lasting 20:47, which secured
her eighty-fifthplace. New Jersey'sown
Shoshannah Pearlman '9B rounded-out
the Swat top three Amazon harriers, finishing in a time of 20:57 for ninety-sixth
place. DanielleWall '9B, DanielaLearner
'96, Ingrid Spies '96, and Stacey Nakell
'96, respectively, comprised the rest of
Swat's strong and enthusiastic top seven
runners. An awesome job was done by
all the Amazon women., .keep up the good

work, ladies!

The field hockey team (4-1) has continued to dominatetheir opponents, dropping only one non-conference game this
past week to Elizabethtown. The team
lost 2-1 and was hindered from the beginning of that match by having only 20
minutes to warm up. "We were not
mentally into the game uie whole way
through, and Elizabethtown was able to
capitalize on that in the second half,"
according to Lia Ernst '97. Ernst scored
the lone goal for Swat in the first half of
the Elizabethtown game. Keeping them
out much of the second half. Coach
Kentwell decided to let Ernst and Sam
Peltz '97 "repair their injuries", and save
their energy for the more important con-

ference games that were to come. Missing two key players and not having more
time to prepare at the field, the team
performed as best it could under the circumstances.

Everybody is playing
very, very well. The
team is really coming
together.
In their next game against Western
Maryland, the Garnet played brilliantly
against the Centennial Conference foe,
shutting them out 4-0. "The Western
Maryland game was a much better game.
We were all ready for the game and every
player played very well," said Lurah
Hess'99, who scored two goals. Also
contributing to Swat's fierce offense were

the cage. Goalie Kelly Wilcox '97, who
made a great save early in the first half,
said, "We were much more focused and
played as a team. We concentrated on
passing and communicating with each
other." Anyone who has attended a field
hockey game this year can attest to the
fact that the Garnet does play as a team.
Swat also hammered out a victory
against Franklin and Marshall at home,
defeating them by a margin of 4 goals to
none. Duffy, Ernst, Griffin, and Hess
scored goals for the Garnet, who are so
far unbeatable on their own field. Lynne
Steuerle '99 solidly patrolled the sidelines, swatting the ball away from any
one who came in her path. Coach

Kentwell lavished praise on his team,
saying that "Everybody is playing very,
very well. The team is coming together.
They are creating opportunities out of
nothing, keeping pressure in the circle.
What is seen in the game is what everyone puts into each practice." Kentwell
particularly cited the efforts of Duffy,
who had a couple of nice drives in the F
& M game. "Danielle is showing a lot of
exciting stuff. She would be a threat at
any level," he said.
Kentwell believes that if the team continues to play this well, they will have a
very good chance of winning the Seven

the team will now be "a marked opponent." "People will be ready for us this

Swarthmore College placed 15th out

of 27 teams, beating not only Trenton
State (the only other Division 111 team
present) but also 10 other Division I
teams. Even though some runners commented on the race conditions and the
hilliness of the course, Swarthmore
showed what a little liberal arts college
can do against large institutions which
invest muchinto their athletic programs.
Brenn Jones '96, who finished at 29:23,
said, "While we have a strong group this
year, the meet showed us that we have a
lot of work and improving to do if we are
going to achieve our goal of reaching the

The women's tennis team faced
Princeton JV on Saturday,September 16.
Becca Kolasky '96 played an excellent
match at #1 singles to defeat her opponent. She battled to win the first set 7-6
and then rolled in the second set 6-0.
Michelle Martinez '97 played well at #2
singles but was unable to overcome her
opponent. Rani Shankar '9B fought hard
at #3, winning the first set but succumbing after a long three set match. Neena
Shenai '99 stepped into the line-up at #4
and showed her talent, but was unable to
capitalize. Hilary Gehlbach'96 and Aarti
Iyer '99 both battled in their matches at
#5 and #6 respectively, but fell to the
Princeton players. In exhibition singles
play, NgaLai '97, Wendy Kemp '99, and
Charity Miller '9B all defeated their opponents.

The #1 doubles team of Kolasky and
Shankar defended Swat's pride by defeating their opponents in a highly competitive match. Points were exchanged
and blistering winners were hit, but
Kolasky and Shankar proved they were
the better team in the end. Swarthmore
was down 5-4 in the second set when they
broke serve to tie. They then held serve
and broke once more to win the match 62, 7-5.
Martinez and Gehlbach formed the #2
team and played an excellent match, trading numerous volleys and lobs. Despite
their efforts and convincing rallies, they
were unable to prevail. The #3 team of
Kori Bell '9B and Kate Schneider '9B
also fell to their opponents. In exhibition
doubles play, Valerie Threlfall '96 and
Lara Ewens '96 hit many smashing
groundstrokes but also fell to Princeton.
Elisa Negrini '99 and Margaret Su '99
showed great potential in their three-set
match. The team faced stiff play from the
Division I squad, but gained great exposure to well-played tennis, as they continue to build strength for the spring
season. The loss of graduating seniors
has forced the team to pull together and
work hard to prepare for a tough year.
The women will continue their fall schedule this Saturday at Kutztown.

Ultimate
Frisbee

The Women's Ultimate Frisbee team
had an exciting week. The War Mothers
hosted the Princeton women's team
Wednesday for a rip-roaring game of
frisbee. Though Princeton eventually
emerged as the victor, just sliding past
Swarthmore for a 7-6 win, the War Mothers were not disappointed. "We played
really well. The team really came togetherduring thegame. By the endof the
season, we will probably be able to beat
Princeton," beamed captain Lena
Loewenthal '97. Theseasonhas also just
begun for the women. Next weekend the
War Mothers join many other mid-Atlantic teams in a tournament appropriately called"Swamp Thing" in New Jersey, followed by a game against the University of Pennsylvania next week at
home. Loewenthal is optimistic about
the upcoming matches, saying, "Wehave
alotof talent on the team. Its just a matter
of getting used to playing together to get
to where we can win."
The men's Ultimate team, on the other
hand, had a rather slow week, devoid of
games. The Swarming Earthworms were
scheduled to play Princeton this weekend, but Princeton forfeited the win to
Swarthmore. Soon, however, the team
will be knee-deep in games, once the
league commences. The five team midAtlantic league, comprised of Princeton,
Rutgers, Haverford, University of Pennsylvania, and Swarthmore, should create
a more reliable schedule for the Earthworms. The men are also looking forward to a promising season.

women's volleyball team dropped its first
Centennial Conference match. To face
Franklin and Marshall, the defending
conference champion, this early in the
season was a difficult test for the young
Garnet squad.
Although they dropped the match in
three relatively quick games, 15-8,15-3,
15-0, co-captain Diana Bieber '96 felt
thatit was a positive experience. "It was
a lot of pressure because we're sort of in
a rut. I feel like as a team we're more
bonded now," she said.
When the team was able to create rallies, they were competitive with F&M.
However, it's good passing and receiving that allow rallies to develop, and
these were the team's main problems.
Another positive was the encouraging
play of Heather Stickney '9B at the net.
Stickney made several important blocks
and is developing into a strong hitter.

Lane '97 expressed his surprise about
the 6-0 win for Hopkins. "We're all a
little shocked about the outcome of the
game. They were a quality team, and it
showed. What was surprising was that
we were playing as equals the first half,

strength was their overall team speed and
persistence after the ball."
Despite the Hopkins loss, S warthmore
should be proud of its men's soccer team
for all of its hard work and talent. The
team is young, with only seven upperclassmen playing. This year is a rebuilding year for the Garnet, as the few veterans take on the task of harnessing the
immense talent of the underclassmen.
"This year's team is very disciplined and
pays close attention to defensive details,"
captain Len Cuello '96 observes. This
powerhouse defensive squad is made up
of captains Jesse Murphy '96 and Derek
Johnson '96, freshman Mike Shaw, Tirian

The men look forward to their game
Thursday against Millersville, a Division II school. Lane anticipates that,
"They should be a tough team. It will be
a challenging game." As for the rest of
the season, it seems to be a promising
one. Cuello is full of optimism, "We
have played a really tough schedule so

The Phoenix

Football
By Frank Amar
The GarnetTide war machine rolled
through Baltimore on Saturday evening,
looking to notchconference win # 1 on its
"Shock the Centennial Tour" against
Johns Hopkins. Unfortunately, the Garnet Tide became the victims, shooting
themselves in the foot with stupid penalties and all-around poor play as they fell
to the Blue Jays 25-3.
The Garnet Tide never really got going. The rain and the slight breeze hampered the passing game, and the Blue
Jays' front seven bottled up the running
game.Defensively, theBlue Jays' ground
game exploited the GarnetTide defense
for 270 yards and accounted for all four
of their touchdowns.
The Tide'sfirst drive was nondescript,
ending after nine plays. After receiving
the punt, the Blue Jays marched right
down the turf, culminating a 16-play, 81
yard drive with a two yard plunge by
Victor Carter-Bey. For the rest ofthe first
and most of the second quarters, the two
teams tradedpunts. Hopkins struck again
late in the second quarter, adding another
rushing touchdown to make the score 130.The Tide's next possession was threeand-out, but Jim Hunt '96 (16 tackles)
intercepted a pass to give the Tide one
last chance before the half. Going without a huddle, the Tide started to move the
ball, but a holding penalty wiped out a

tion thatwould have put the ball on the 2
yard line. Back to back sacks put the
Garnet Tide way out of field goal position and they punted to end the half.
In what seemed like a replay of the
previous week, the Blue Jays opened the
second half with a time consuming 15
play, 86 yard scoring drive. On the
ensuing drive, an errant Straub pass was
intercepted in Garnet Tide territory. A
mere threeplays later, Hopkins had scored
again. By now, the blitzkrieg was over,
but the damage was irreperable: the Tide
was staring down the barrelof a 25 point
deficit. Matt Minero connected on a 27
yard field goal early in the fourth quarter
but it was far too little, far too late.
Unfortunately for the Garnet Tide, the
football game wasn't all they lost. Strong
safety Frank Santora '96 (26 tackles, one
interception) suffered a broken foot and
is lost for the season. Santora's aggressive play and enthusiasm will be sorely
missed. Expect Curtis Trimble '96 to see
more time in the secondary.

team came away with its first clear win
and its first shutout of the season in a
physical 1-0 triumph. First-year Kirsten
Knox collected the goal off a deflection
on a free kick, the first of her career and
the defense led by Willard, Baxter, Diana

Baxter noted that, "It is nice to get our

The past week proved that the team
was finally able to settle down and find

Cheerleading
By Elaine Huang and Jen Weiss

Yes, there are cheerleaders at Swat,
and no, they're not your stereotypical
cheerleaders. No big hair. No booty
shakin'. This is serious cheerleading.
It wasn't always that way. Co-captains Elizabeth Hirshfield '96 and Gena
Merliss '97 started cheering on the
Swarthmore squad in 1993, way back
when the cheerleaders were best known
for hip thrusts and rump shaking. Since
then, they' ve gradually switched emphasis to cleaner, sharper cheering to rouse
fans and build energy.
Cheerleading is not just a weekly activity. In order to earn a gym credit per
season (football and basketball), squad
members must attend three to four twohour long practices per week. And let's
not forget games, which can be day long
affairs for football. Recently, practices
have been revamped to include aerobic
exercise, plenty of stretching, and muscle
toning. The other half of practice is
devoted to learning and reviewing cheers.
This year's squad is composed of five
seasoned veterans and five new recruits.
Although some have cheered in the past,
experience is not a prerequisite this season. However, the co-captains agreed
that energy, determination, and enthusiasm were certainly necessary. Returning
members this year are co-captains
Hirshfield and Merliss, Brenda Arellano
'97, Elaine Huang '9B, and Jen Weiss
'9B. Freshmen are Vanessa Jann-Jordan,
Jessica Harbour, Valencia King, Denise
Tenorio ,and Julie Schwendiman.
Right now, thecheerleaders are inhigh
gear, working towards cheering at the
home gameversus Gettysburg thisSaturday, September 23 at I:3OPM. Practices
thus far have been cram sessions focused
on teaching as much of the large cheering
repertoire to new members as possible.

Sturm '97, the team constructed two
makeshift goals out of PVC piping and
duct tape. They were anchored into the
ground with nothing more than a halfmeter deep hole and dirt, and lasted two
games without even wobbling.

Although the Buzzards dominatedplay
for most of the game, they couldn't push
the ball into the try zone until nearly 20
minutes into the game. Early in the first
half. Matt Miller '96 appeared to have
scored when he touched theball down in
the try zone. But, for the second time this
season, thereferee was in a poor position
to see the ball and consequently, disallowed Miller's score.
When the team did score, the forwards
played a big role by rucking the ball
down within five meters of the try zone
beforeChaz Teplin '96picked up theball
and dove in for the score.
Teplin's conversion made it 7-0, but'
La Salle cut the lead to two points soon
after with a quick try. La Salle then
threatened, rucking downclose to the try
zone before Swarthmore, with a little

help from the half time whistle, was able
to keep the score 7-5 going into the second period.

After halftime, the Evil Buzzards took
control of the game, scoring again when
Eric "Duke" Ellingson '96 scored on a
forward maul early in the half. Soon
after, Jason Sturm scored one ofthe more
heads-up tries this season. A penalty was
called on La Salle around our the
Buzzard's 22,and while they were trying
to organize their defense, Sturm touched
theball in and sprinted past the retreating
defense, running around 30 meters before pop kicking the ball deep, where it
was grabbed by Mark Pletcher '96, who
shoveled itback to Sturm, whodove over
the five meter line, then got back up and
re-dove into the try zone to seal the game.
LaSalle scored again when a back broke

through for a 20 yard run for a score, but

there was no looking back for the Buzzards, who added another insurance score
on another forward ruck, when Teplin
picked up the ball and ran it in again.
Tom Hooper '96 played well in his
first Aside game at inside center. Also
turning in a fine performance in the back
line was Danßarrick '9B, who saved a try
by falling on a loose ball in our own try
zone after a blocked kick.
According to Teplin, though, "The forward pack basically won [the game]."
Elijah Porter '99 made played solidly in
his rugby debut at prop. Bryce Walker
'9B, at second row and JoeKhan '97, who
came in as a sub for Jim Tracy '96 early
in the game, both helped the forwards
push La Salle all over the field.

Featured Sports Figure:
Athletic Director Bob Williams
By Rachel Gutman
Bob Williams's main interest is intercollegiate athletics and sports activities;
amateur sports are his true love. Williams has been working as the athletic
department chair and athletic director of
Swarthmore College since 1987. He is
responsible to the provost to oversee the
athletics/sports activities program, which
include the intercollegiate teams, the
physical education program, club sports,
intramurals, and therecreation program.
Some members of the athletic department have direct responsibility for these
specific areas, but Williams organizes
the entire program. He works on the
budget, home and away game management, and is the president's delegate to
the NCAA, of which he is an officer and
a member of the Division 111 committee.
The committee conducts a business session at the national convention which
represents the Division HI membership
for the council. Williams works on the
taskforce and thenational championship
committee. His job is to study and restructure the committee. He also works
on a board which tries to promote sportsmanship and ethical behavior.
'Today's hot issues are gender equity
and sportsmanship," says Williams."At
a place like Swarthmore, we can emphasize sportsmanship, and over the nine
years I have been here, student athletes
have alwaysrepresented the highest standards of sportsmanship. We have many
club sports activities. Just last Saturday
I was at a men's rugby game. This kind
of sport is tough and it is hard to conduct
such a program. We're fortunate that
everyone cooperates and the program
works."
Bob Williams was originally a track
and field coach and member of the department of physical education at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick. He coordinated the college and community university recreation program for seven
years. This involved non-intercollegiate
athletic use of the facilities by the college
students and the New Brunswick community. After that, Williams became the

directorof physical education at Amherst
College, where he stayed for fourteen
years.
He also coached men's and
women's cross-country and indoor and
outdoor track and field. He left Amherst
inorder to takethe job here at Swarthmore.
In the short run, Williams hopes to
enhance the athletic facilities and keep
them working. "The coaching staff is a

really good one," says Williams, "and I
owe them a lot of credit" Williams's
long range goals are to maintain an athletic program that offers numerous options on all differentlevels. "We'll need
a larger facility," he says. "We must
address this issue. We're unique in that
we only have 1300 students and yet we
have 22 intercollegiate teams, 7 club
sports, and a very extensive intramural
and recreation program. I'm worried,
however, about the quality of people's
athletic experiences. With all the overlap
of sports seasons and need for team practice time, we must make sure not to push
aside club sports and intramurals. I'm
somewhat concerned that we're running
out of space. It's already a problem with
trying to balance everything." Williams

has talked about this informally with the
college administration; it's a big item on
their agenda. They will have a tentative
plan by spring but it's difficult because
there's already so much building going
on on campus.
In the nine years that Williams has
been here, he has witnessed a few major
changes. The facilities are maintained
muchbetter now than in 1987. The staff
is adequate although more secretaries are
needed, but they're "doing a great job."
The budget is now in place and working
very well. Williams credits that to the
administration's willingness to supply
the athletic department with funding
which is quite large for a school of 1300
students. In his nine years, Mr. Williams
has also seen the length of the sports
seasons grow due to NCAA legislation.
"This is a hardship on the support staff,
especially training and equipment. These
are two areas we are very proud of. The
stafffor these programs is truly outstanding."
Bob Williams lives in Wallingford,
Pennsylvania, about a mile and a half
from campus. In addition to watching
and coordinating sports, he enjoys fishing, arts and crafts, reading and quiet
time. He has three sons who are all grown
and working as professionals. His youngest went to Amherst College and is an
attorney in Philadelphia; the other two
are in business. His wife is a speech
pathologist. Williams participated in track
and field in high school and college. He
also played football and swam competitively. He never gave himself many
options as to what career he would pursue. He was always an athlete and this
just seemed the natural thing to do. Interested in physical education, he attended

Delaware State University which was
primarily a teaching college. He received a degree in physical education
and there were not too many choices
from there. He worked in this field for a
while whenhe became very interested in
athletic administration, as a position in
which he would have "a say about how
things go"and he would be involved with
the NCAA with a view of "how it all
works." "It is very exciting and challenging work. It's important to beable to
defend athletics on the college campus.
Sports should continue to be educational
and fun."
Bob Williams likes the associationhere
with the larger faculty, in thatthe athletic
department members are members of the
faculty too. He enjoys working with the
students and teaching physical education
classes. "They're a joyand a challenge to
work with." He is also happy with the
support from the administration and faculty. "You could say I like it here."
