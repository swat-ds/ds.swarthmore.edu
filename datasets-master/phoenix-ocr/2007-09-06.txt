AlcoholEdu receives mixed feedback
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu
This year, all incoming first-year students, along with
RAs, SAMs and Orientation Committee members, were
required to complete the AlcoholEdu "course," a two and a
half-hour online education survey intended to provide a
common base of knowledge on the health and safety issues
related to alcohol. "The AlcoholEdu online survey is
meant to provide students with widely varying backgrounds and experiences with a shared foundation of
knowledge to start a discussion," Dean of Students Jim
Larimore said.
According to its Web site, AlcoholEdu has five years of
experience as the leader in alcohol abuse prevention,
and has established contact with over 400 colleges
and half a million students. Due to its developed database
and his familiarity with the program, having used it at
both Stanford University and Dartmouth College,
Larimore wanted to try it with Swarthmore, according to
Swarthmore's Alcohol Education and Intervention
Specialist Tom Elverson '75. Elverson said that
the survey was useful for making sure that all incoming
freshmen had the same amount of information concerning
alcohol.
"It puts everybody in the same playing field," Elverson
said. "We have such a diverse population of students coming here, we felt it would be good to have common ground
for information and prevention and understanding. And
the program definitely does that. So, in that respect it's
very advantageous."
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal agreed,
adding that alcohol was one of college administrators'

and that it was essential that all students
were equally informed about it. Westphal also said that
Swarthmore had to team up with other small colleges in
order to lower the price per student for the program.
"Our dean created a consortium of small liberal arts
colleges to make the price more attractive because when
we looked at it initially we were being charged horrible
rates. We were really suffering from having a small population because they were putting all the overhead costs on
us, and so when that changed then we said OK, we'll give
it a try," Westphal said.
biggest concerns

However, many of the first-year students were disappointed with the survey, describing it as too long and not
particularly informative.
"It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever had to do. In
high school during health we learned all that same stuff.
So it was really repetitive," Halona Jackson 'll said. "The
freshmen were saying it made them want to drink more."
Nicole Topich 'll held a similar opinion. "I think I didn't learn anything, and that I couldn't apply it to real situations," Topich said. "It will happen whether or not we

take a course."
RA Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9 had to take the survey
along with his fellow RAs and individuals in the SAM program. "The vast majority of freshmen didn't like the program, but I think everyone learned something from it,"
Gilchrist-Scott said. "The biggest complaint was the presentation. It could've been done in a better and faster way"
During their training, RAs also had to take a "Social
Life at Swarthmore" workshop with Elverson.
"[The workshop and the online survey] complement
each other pretty well," Gilchrist-Scott said. "The online
survey gives a lot of the hard facts, and the workshop gives
specific information on Swat. But, because AlcoholEdu is
used for many institutions, it can't be personalized like the
RA alcohol workshop."
Westphal agreed that the survey is not specific to
Swarthmore, saying that she hopes that some students will
be motivated to develop a version of the online survey spe-

cific to Swarthmore students.
Elverson also agreed that the program may need to be
improved or customized to better fit Swarthmore, but felt
that was a significant first step. "We know it's not a perfect
program but it's a good start to creating an even greater
program," Elverson said. "As a drug and alcohol counselor,
I've done alcohol counseling now for 30 years. I think it
can't hurt... and can we and will we adapt it to our population here? Absolutely."

According to Elverson, for the next three years, incoming first-years will have to take the AlcoholEdu online survey. The college continues looking for a more effective pro-

gram. AlcoholEdu will be using feed back from schools
across the country to make improvements. According to
Westphal, Larimore knows the owner of this program personally, which allows his feedback to be heard.

Typically, students complained that the survey was too
long, and that there were some computer-compatibility
issues with the Web site. In addition, there were questions
referring to parts of the brain and chemistry that some
first-years interviewed claimed were unnecessarily

detailed for this type of program.
The program will also provide the college with the combined data from the survey, which will be an aggregate
of all the answers as well as a compilation of all the
student comments anonymously. The college hopes
to learn about the incoming class through this information and to monitor student behavior to see if there
is a decrease in alcohol-related incidents, based on the
number of students that go to Worth with alcohol-related
problems and the number of incidents involving public
safety.

"The vast majority of freshmen
didn't like the program, but I think
everyone learned something
from it."
Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9
Alice Paul RA
Last year, campus fraternity Delta Upsilon, which
belongs to a national group and must buy insurance
through them in case of accidents occurring in their
house, was encouraged to take AlcoholEdu in order to
ensure a reduced insurance rate. According to, Westphal,
the college provided funding for fraternity members to
take to take the course in exchange for feedback on the
program.
"I thought it was a pretty good program, especially for

students coming into school who don't have much experience with alcohol. The program can sort of initiate them.
It's not the most interesting thing to take, but I've been
here three years and I still learned something from it," DU
President Scott Dalane 'OB said.

WNR progresses forward despite a loss
mkhiml@swarthmore.edu

Even after losing a mentor this past June, War News
Radio has nonetheless managed to have a dynamic summer that consisted of many changes and accomplishments, ranging from acquiring a new advisor to forming
closer ties with the Lang Center for Civic and Social
Responsibility.

"Although we did lose a great
mentor, it helped us shape the
whole summer experience in a way
that did not end tragically."
Hansi Wang 'O9
WNR Senior Producer
In early June, just before WNR's summer programming began, War News Radio endured an abrupt shift as
they were presented with a challenge: the departure of
their longest-standing journalist-in-residence, Marty

Goldensohn, who had worked with the students for the
last two years.
"I helped transform the program from something
even the parents wouldn't listen to, to a professional
program on 70 or so outlets," Goldensohn said in an email. But he also explained that although he had taught
THE PHOENIX

the students how to "think radio" and write for radio,
it was the students who ultimately did all the work.
"My experience with WNR has been pure pleasure.
The Swarthmore students were the best
smart and

compassionate

and the work was important,"
Goldensohn said.
Since its founding, War News Radio has worked with
journalists-in-residence who have helped oversee the
radio program and provide guidance based on their
greater level of experience. At first, many students
involved in WNR were shocked and a bit upset to hear
that Goldensohn's contract with the school was not
renewed and he was to leave.
"At the time, the method that led up to the decision
wasn't clear to us. We weren't happy with the way things
[proceeded.] It was a surprise to us, and so we were
unsure about where things would go next with WNR,"
War News Radi student-member Aaron Schwartz 'O9

said.
However, after the initial shock, the students of War
News Radio were able to respond, as Hansi Wang 'O9
related, in a way that made the program even stronger.
"Although we did lose a great mentor, it helped us
shape the whole summer experience in a way that did
not end tragically. It made our program stronger in a
sense," Wang said. "We really focused on moving forward in a way that would strengthen our program and
continue the awesome learning experience because, ultimately, it is one of the best student experiences that

Swarthmore has to offer."
Students from War News Radio participated in the
search for Goldensohn's replacement, which ultimately
selected Ayub Nuri to be the new WNR mentor. Nuri was
September 6, 2007

contacted through Swarthmore alum David Gelber '63,
the producer of CBS' 60 Minutes.
Well known for being an active reporter in Iraq, Nuri
has been writing from Iraq since 2003 on various issues
ranging from daily life in Iraq to ethnic violence and border issues.

"When I heard about War News Radio, it interested
me right away," Nuri said. "One reason that it interested
me was because when I became a radio reporter, my original goal was to cover Iraq and tell the world what was
going on. Now, I'm not alone, but working with twenty to
thirty students on several reports about Iraq every
week." A further interest of his for War News Radio
includes expanding upon their list of contacts to establish as wide a range of connections in Iraq as possible.
"It's exciting because [Nuri] is very different from
[Goldensohn], and they have a lot of different strengths.
It will be interesting to see how this plays out.
[Goldensohn] was a veteran radio journalist in the
states, and [Nuri] is coming in with a lot of experience
from Iraq, which should be particularly exciting to see,"
Schwartz said.

In addition to the students, the administration also
expressed enthusiasm about working with Nuri.

"As part of the evolution of the program, the Lang
Center is going to become the administrative home for
Ayub since the War News Radio program is very much
what the Lang Center is about, a very exciting marriage
between intellectual development and putting it to use in
the real world," Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said.

New wireless Internet encounters problems
BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyakl@swarthmore.edu

Despite Swarthmore's ranking
as the fourth "most wired" college
campus in the nation in PC
Magazine's Dec. 31,2006 issue, students have been struggling to consistently connect to the college's
newly-expanded wireless network
since returning to campus.
"When I heard about [wireless] I thought it was going to be
convenient, but I'm having problems," Katerina Kontogouri 'lO
said. Kontogouri also said that
she and her roommate have expe-

rienced

different

levels

of

Internet connectivity while in the

same room.

Last year, Parrish was the sole
dorm with wireless Internet. Now

all of the residence halls are outfitted with wireless access points
in the ceilings, with a total of 350
points

According to Associate Director
of Networking and Telecommunications Mark Dumic, the approximate cost for implementing wireless Internet in the dorms was
$175,000.
The Restech office has seen a
wide gamut of technical problems

related to the wireless connection. "We've been overloaded. The
help-desk is more crowded now
than ever before with registration
and wireless problems," Client
Services and Coordinator of
Information Technology Services
Seth
Frisbie-Fulton
said.
"Because we operate with a limit-

to follow the instructions posted

before coming by the help desk,
but we are of course available to
assist if you encounter difficulties," Frisbie-Fulton added in an
email.

"The helpdesk is

Seth Frisbie-Fulton
Client Services
Coordinatof ITS
Frisbie-Fulton has not seen
definitive trends among wireless
connection problems, but stated
that nearly all of the computers
brought to Restech have been able
to connect to the network after
some fine-tuning. "I have a feeling that wireless will be used
heavily by our student body and
may require additional access
points and bandwidth to meet the
demand," Frisbie-Fulton said.
Frisbie-Fulton also predicted the
need for a separate wireless network to function for devices such
as iPhones, personal digital

Assistant and Nintendo Wiis.
Dumic also said that different
operating systems in Windows
and different versions of Mac OS
operate differently and therefore
pose different obstacles to stu-

dents trying to connect to the
wireless Internet. "As people
change their passwords, Windows
users have to download the certificate again," Dumic added.
Dumic also said that it appears
that about two-thirds of student
computers are able to connect to
the wireless network, and the
remaining one-third who have
visited Restech were eventually
able to connect. Unfortunately,
systems including and older than
Windows 2000 will not be able to
connect to Swarthmore's wire-

less.
According to Dumic, numerous tests were run over the summer to deal with the permutations
of the wireless system.
The wireless network was
extended to outdoor areas, including also the Willets lawn,
Sharpies patio, Wharton courtyard and Kolhberg Quad. In the
next few weeks students can
expect to enjoy wireless Internet
even in more remote areas like

the fieldhouse outdoor track and
Alice Paul's front door area.
ITS manager Trilok Acharya

'O9 said that the expansion of
wireless is fairly recent and
requires more time to begin
working perfectly. "It will probably be a little finicky this semester," Acharya said.

Administration responds to bomb threat
Multiple alarming emails sent to admissions from unknown origin determined false
BY KAITLIN KYI

kkyil@swarthmore.edu

On Friday afternoon, a bomb threat
was sent repeatedly to the admissions email account, soon after which the administration took immediate steps to investigate the severity of the threat and to
inform the greater campus community.
The bomb threat e-mails were sent to
admissions@swarthmore.edu on Friday
between 2:40 p.m. and 3:20 p.m. According
to Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l, all
six e-mails contained the same narrative,
stating explosive devices were located
around the campus.
"The e-mails came within an hour
of each other, all routed through a
series of unrelated, distant addresses,"
Eldridge said.
The e-mails were transmitted through
multiple servers locate in Italy, Cyprus
and Austria.
At least 13 other colleges and universities were targeted, including Carnegie
Mellon, Princeton, Cornell, MIT and the
University of Alaska.
In these cases, in order to avoid being
identified or detected, the messages were
purposefully sent via remailers, a service
through which e-mails can be sent without disclosing the sender's identity or
location."

Upon receiving the e-mails, the
Swarthmore Borough Police was called to
the campus. "My first involvement was to

bring the Swarthmore Police into the mixture. So, we had two Swarthmore Police
officers respond here," Director of Public
Safety Owen Redgrave said. The Borough
Police arrived on campus at 2:50 p.m. on
Friday, soon after making a phone call to
County
the
Delaware
Criminal
Investigation Division, whereupon they
determined that the threat did not warrant a campus-wide search.
The information was passed onto the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to Redgrave.

"I trust that the
administration's response
was accurate given the lack
of specificity in the threat."

"There's a series of procedures [to

We spent time up there and there are certain guidelines to go through, and we

"The President's staff meets every

think that it is an advantage," Hain said.
"It is a more closely connected community, and I think that does help." According
to Hain, there had been two previous
bomb threats during his past 17 years at
the College.
Overall, the administration was
pleased with how the threat was handled.
"I think it was the right way to handle
it. We did what was necessary," Eldridge
said. "I hope that we don't have to repeat
it, but I'm glad to get a sense that we are
prepared if we are threatened. I think it's
reassuring to the community to know
that."
Students were reassured by the awareness bulletin put out by the administra-

Al Bloom,
of his presidential staff,
Redgrave, Associate Vice President of
Facilities and Services Stu Hain and
Director of Communications Nancy
Nicely met and discussed the gravity of
the bomb threat.
Afterwards, Hain promptly sent out an
awareness bulletin to the college community informing them via e-mail that the
threat was false and to be cautious of "any
suspicious packages
or unfamiliar
devices."
Fortunately, Public Safety had a large
number of officers on campus during the
time of the threat due to an overlap of
shifts.
"We're fortunate that Fridays are very
well-staffed," Redgrave said. "We had six
officers including myself." However, if
there had not been overlapping shifts, the
officers "would have been called in,"
according to Redgrave.
Eldridge attributed the quick response
to the unique culture and size of the college.
"It's a very closely knit community,
and I think the announcement had its
intended effect. I think people got the
information and appreciated the tone of it
and went on with their lives," Eldridge
said. "There was not a lot of fear or panic
because there wasn't a reason for that."

West to be missed throughout community
BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyal@swarthmore.edu
After nine years at the college, Vice President for
Alumni, Development and Public Relations, Dan West,
will retire at the end of this year.
For those who worked with West, his retirement will
leave a void in the college community. "As a boss, I'm
going to miss him a great deal. When you work for just
one person you have a very close relationship [with
them]," said Connie Baxter, West's Administrative

Coordinator.
Director of Development Stephen Bayer described
West's retirement as "bittersweet," stating that "[West]
has been a wonderful, fantastic vice president."
Both Baxter and Bayer praised West for his strong
leadership, work ethic, modesty, sense of humor and hospitality during his tenure at Swarthmore. Bayer attributed West's charisma and success to "a combination ofhis
Southern charm and dogged determination."
The college hired West to head the Meaning of
Swarthmore capital campaign with the goal of raising
$230 mill-ion before Dec. 31, 2006. Under West's guidance,
the campaign amassed $l5 million more than anticipated.
"There were times when the campaign looked daunting,
but never to him. He is an eternal optimist," Bayer said of
West. Bayer stated that West was instrumental in building
the development team, which had not existed in its current form prior to his arrival at the College. West currently heads a 45-person staff, which, at one point, consisted of around 60 personnel.
"Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves for they

shall never cease to be amused," reads a plaque on West's
shelf, summing up the work environment West fosters.
"Dan never takes himself so seriously that he can't
laugh," Baxter said, and questioned whether, if under different leadership, West's development team would have
had as much fun during the campaign.
Additionally, West and his wife, Sydney, completely
revamped the West House. The Wests redecorated,
repainted and landscaped the West house, which Baxter
and Bayer described as a "bed and breakfast" of sorts for
board members, alumni counsel, speakers and other

guests. Gil Kemp '72 endowed the house and named it the

West House in appreciation of the Wests' hard work and
dedication to the college. Baxter said that West also dons
a chefs hat and makes breakfast for the West House
guests, confirming that West is, indeed, a good cook.
As a national search for West's replacement begins,
Bayer expressed the hope that the search will find "someone who is willing to undertake the next big campaign and
to commit themselves to fostering great teamwork and
garnering the energy needed."
"Dan led a historic period in development and alumni
relations at the College, raising record resources, establishing an extraordinary number of close relationships
with alumni and friends and generating a higher level of

consciousness across our
broader
community
about the College's essential continued dependency on philanthropic supSwarthmore

Deans organize into
teams by class year
BY ELENA CHOPYAK

echopyal@swarthmore. edu

Starting this semester, the Dean's Office
will adapt a new model of organization, the
"Class Year-Dean Model," in which two
deans are assigned to each class year. These
deans will offer advice and support throughout the four years their assigned class
spends at Swarthmore.
Dean ofStudents Jim Larimore, who had
began thinking of organizational reforms as
early as fall of 2006, proposed this new
model. "I concluded that students had a fair
impression of the deans, but [most] didn't
actually know one," Larimore said. "With a
school this size, I thought we should be able

to overcome that familiarity gap."

Larimore consulted students and faculty
for feedback. "As a newcomer proposing
change, I wasn't sure it would work or take
off immediately, but the decision unfolded
pretty quickly," Larimore said. After a deans
staff retreat in June generated positive
responses, the deans felt this model would
inspire positive changes for Swarthmore
students. "My hope is that the Class Year-

Dean model will make it easier for students
to know who to turn to if they have questions, encounter problems or simply want a
bit of advice or help," Larimore said.
Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs
Darryl Smaw will act as dean for the Class of
2011; Assistant Dean and Director of the
Black Cultural Center Tim Sams will act as
the dean for the Class of 2010; Assistant Dean
and Director of the Intercultural Center
Rafael Zapata for the Class of 2009; Associate
Dean for StudentLife Myrt Westphal for the
graduating Class of 2008.
Additionally, Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs Garikai Campbell '9O will
also take on the role of the dean for all class
years. "I wanted to make sure that, as a dean
whose primary concern is the academic life
of the students I'm in touch with all of the
classes," Campbell said.
Assistant Dean and Gender Education
Advisor Karen Henry 'B7 is currently a

Bloom said in an email. "And he did so with deep embrace
of the College's mission, untiring energy and unfailing
care. We will greatly miss his leadership and look forward
to

celebrating his remarkable contributions to
Swarthmore later in the semester."
Noting Swarthmore's transformation during his years
at the college, West said, "I think the college is more confident about its ability to raise money ... and is more committed to mounting the effort that is necessary to do devel-

opment successfully."
"[Swarthmore's] education approach is extremely
expensive, and to continue, we'll have to raise a great deal
of money in the future," West added.
Prior to working at Swarthmore, West held the position of Vice President of College Relations at Union
College in Schenectady, New York. For the past 39 years,
at five different liberal arts colleges West has worked in
development and is ready for a change. "I have mixed
emotions because I've really enjoyed my work here, being
part of the college a part of the Philadelphia area," West
said.
West, who is also a minister in the Presbyterian
Church, said he looks forward to preaching, writing,

for one year and then be assigned an
incoming class of first-years to work with
for the subsequent four years.
"It's not rigid, but it gives structure so
people who don't know where to go have a
dean to start with," Westphal said.
Westphal emphasized that she wants students to have the comfort of knowing that
there is a dean out there for them.
Randall Johnston 'O9, who served on
the Dean's Advisory Council last semester,
said, "I hope that it'llprovide a greater system of support and more contact with
deans because the deans are here for the
students and I don't think that students
usually understand that... The reason people survive on this campus is because of its
support systems."
While the deans are excited about the
new system, they understand that it is
novel and may need adjusting. "We want
to make it work and identify any problems
or bugs as we go," Larimore said. "I'm
curious about the feedback from the students and whether this new structure will
help in any tangible way or not."
Dean Campbell said the new system
should help optimize the campus environment for students. "If we develop the right
mechanisms and put the right structure in
place, we should have the capability to
address all the issues, needs and concerns
of all the students," he said.
"The deans
are always looking for
new ways to make contact with students
hopefully students will reciprocate this
feeling," Johnston said.

PhillyCarShare coming soon to Swarthmore
phoen ix.swa rth more.ed u

The non-profit organization plans to provide a car for the Swarthmore students and residents
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

For students who need a car in a pinch
and do not have access to one, Earthlust
recently
has
announced
that
PhillyCarShare has made new plans to
provide a car for residents in the
Swarthmore College and borough area.
PhillyCarShare is a non-profit organization that attempts to reduce harmful
automobile emissions by providing their
members with a 24-hour, pay-by-the-hour
car-sharing service.
Clayton Lane, a PhillyCarShare representative, said the mission of the organi-

zation is "to get cars off the road and
encourage people to walk, bike, take
transit more
and it tends to work well
for students," Lane said. "We realize that
now and
people need a car every
then, especially if you need to leave campus. We are trying to provide an alternative that makes it easy to [do so]."
Earthlust, a student group on campus
that addresses environmental issues,
decided to work with PhillyCarShare in
order to introduce this service to
Swarthmore students because it is convenient and benefits the environment.
...

"[PhillyCarShare is] very
environmentally friendly. It
allows [for] efficient use of
vehicles."
JJ England 'O9
Earthsust member
Additionally, Earthlust thought the
service would appeal to students, especially considering the current limitations
and the problems these restrictions pose

for students with cars on campus.

"According to PhillyCarShare, one
car should be able to support 30-50 mem-

bers that sign up," said Earthlust member JJ England 'O9, one of the main student proponents of the PhillyCarShare
service. "If we get this implemented properly, we expect that some students may

not feel the need to bring their cars to
[With] such a high demand for

parking spots and so few of them available, I thought this would be a great solution," England said. "It's very environmentally friendly. It allows [for] efficient
[and for] fewer cars to
use of vehicles
...

...

be on campus, which allows for fewer
paved areas and more green areas to be
made available."

"With car-sharing, you can
save a lot of money for
driving less, and people do,
and that's why it's good for
the environment."
Clayton Lane
PhillyCarShare
representative
PhillyCarShare services are accessible to anyone 18 years or older with a
valid license.
To register, drivers must submit credit card or debit card information to the
PhillyCarShare Web site, and will be
charged an hourly rate of $5.90.
New members are mailed an electronic key that gives them access to any of the
vehicles available in their local "pod," a
specialized PhillyCarShare parking lot. A
wide variety of cars are made available
by the service.
Cars can range from the Toyota Prius,
a hybrid gas-electric vehicle, to miniCoopers, pick-up trucks, beetle convertibles, BMWs and mini-vans.
""When you get a car, you can choose
exactly what car you want at that time,"

Lane said. "You get a bill once a month
showing you all your trips and all the
costs. We just provide a single price to
make it easy," he said.
"Everybody saves money in the
process. When somebody owns a car,
it's costing them 15 to 20 dollars to
...

drive the car," Lane said. "With car-sharing, you can save a lot of money for
driving less and people do and that's why
it's good for the environment."
Additionally, the service pays for fuel
and provides varying insurance options

glove compartment of each car.
As for car insurance, "before you turn
21, PhillyCarShare will augment your
existing, basic insurance to one million
dollar coverage," England said. "After
you turn 21, PhillyCarShare will include

insurance."

Kotarski appointed as new Worth director
BY lAN YARETT
iyarettl@swarthmore.edu
Beth Kotarski has been appointed as the new director of
Worth Health Center and will succeed the current director,
Linda Echols, who announced her retirement last spring.
Kotarski will begin work at Swarthmore on Oct. 1 Most
recently, Kotarski has been a nurse practitioner at
Haverford College for 11 years, and has worked as associate
director of Haverford's health services for the past 6 years.
One of Kotarski's primary goals for the health center is to
increase outreach to the students on campus.
"I feel like college health is just my niche," Kotarski said.
"I just enjoy dealing with students." According to Larimore,
the search process for a new health center director was
started in mid-spring soon after Echols announced her
retirement, and the job opening was posted at the beginning
of May. Two students Meredith Firetog 10 and Dominic
were appointed to the search committee
Lowell 'OB
through the Student Council Appointments process.
In July, a group of applicants were invited to
Swarthmore for a series of interviews and given the opportunity to meet with students and anyone else on campus.
According to Dean of Students Jim Larimore, about 25-30
students attended these sessions. Women's health, the need
for the health center to play a positive outreach role and the
role of the health center in providing care to intoxicated students were among the concerns voiced by students at the
meeting, according to Larimore.
"The way we put together the interview schedule, usually over the course of a full day, was in itself a test for the
candidates," Larimore said. "[The candidates] met 50-60
people during the day, heard lots of questions and got inforit was impressive to see the
mation from many people

turnout and how seriously students take their health."
"When I met Beth, I got a good feeling from her, as many
students have felt about Linda," Firetog said. "It's important
to have someone you feel comfortable approaching. Beth
also seemed dedicated to student outreach."
"[Kotarski] had a lot of experience with outreach for students and has an amazing background in sexual assault prevention and a great background in women's health," Lowell
said. "She was also very receptive to concerns of the queer
community."

"I feel like college health is just my
niche. I just enjoy dealing with

students."
Beth Kotarski
Incoming Worth Health Center

Director
According to Larimore, a record of excellence in healthcare delivery and a record of keeping up with new developments in the field, were major qualities the search committee was looking for in a new director. Also, the committee
was looking for someone who could maintain the high level
of service in women's health that Echols provided and someone who could maintain many of the local connections
Echols developed over her years as director. "We were interested in finding someone who could step into that kind of
environment and not miss a beat moving forward,"

Larimore said. Lowell echoed Larimore's sentiment. "We
wanted to find someone who could hit the ground running,
and who had a lot of creative energy," Lowell said.
Kotarski said student outreach would be one of her top
priorities as she steps into her new role as director of Worth
Health Center. "I'm a big fan of brown bag lunches,"
Kotarski said. "Let's talk about the issues I know students
are more awake and available at 7 p.m. as opposed to during
the day, and I'd be happy to make myself available at those
times. "With regard to specific issues such as the price of
birth control, Kotarski said that she was confident the price
per pack of birth control pills could be kept reasonable. "My
distributors now give me between $10.99 and $12.99 per
pack," Kotarski said. "When you take into account other
costs like shipping, I'm hoping to have birth control available for $l2-15 per pack." As a point of comparison, Kotarski
said that Planned Parenthood sells birth control for $2O-25
per pack. "Linda [Echols] has done such a good job getting
contracts [for birth control] in the past," Kotarski said.
With regard to the health center's policies and procedures for dealing with intoxicated students, Kotarski
described her philosophy as "safety first." "I need to live in
the system for a bit, and meet student groups and staff," she
added. According to Kotarski, a major strength of Worth is
the dedication and commitment of the nurses to high quality care. Kotarski said that one of her greatest joys at
Haverford was her connections with the students, and that
she hopes to establish the same types of relationships with
students at Swarthmore. "I want students to know that I'm
on their side my role is to be a support to the students,"
she said. "I can't be all things to all people, but I can be
accessible."
"I feel honored and privileged to know committed students," she said. "It all comes down to communication."

Dining Services introduces compostable containers
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu
Over the summer, cups, plates and containers in Essie Mae's and the coffee bars

undergone an environmentally
friendly makeover. Thanks to the joint
efforts of Earthlust, the Good Food Project,
Dining Services and the Swarthmore
administration, many of the containers
used in the snack and coffee bars are now
compostable. In most cases, these changes
will not affect students' wallets.
The switch to compostable containers
was initially proposed by Earthlust's
Campus Greening Committee in the fall of
2005.
However, due to budgetary issues and
resistance from the administration, the
proposal did not take off until the Good
Food Project began campaigning for it
again in January of 2007.
According to Good Food Project cofounder Marshall Morales 'OB, the idea to
•switch to compostable containers came
about during talks between Good Food,
Dining Services and the* administration
about, starting a food-composting program
at the college
a program that is currently in the planning stages. During discussions, Dining Services suggested that
changes should be made so that the containers used to serve food could also be
composted.
Morales saw this move as a sign that
Swarthmore's administration is not only
supporting, but also matching student

efforts.
"This is a really great case of the
progress that Swarthmore is making. No
longer are we just pushing an administration that would rather us be silent, but
now we have an administration that is
willing to meet us and even come up to us
with great ideas," Morales said.
Currently, the plates and takeout containers in Essie Mae's are made from
sugar cane and are compostable. The cups,

THE PHOENIX

cup carriers, cold cup lids and salad containers in the coffee bars are made from
corn and are also compostable. Essie Mae's
will continue to use Styrofoam cups, as
there is currently not enough room in the
budget to replace them with their compostable counterparts. In addition, the lids
used in the coffee bars for hot drinks are
also not compostable because the com-

postable material cannot withstand the
heat generated by the warmer beverages.

Further details about the new containers
can be found on posters in Essie Mae's and
the coffee bars.
While the cost of these new containers
is significantly steeper than that of the old
ones, Dining Services has worked to
ensure that prices at Tarble and the coffee
bars will not be affected.
The only pricing difference that students will find this year is that the coffee
bars now charge $0.15 for a cup of water or
an empty cup. Cups are still provided free
of charge with coffee and tea, and .the

The motivation behind the program is

not only to make Swarthmore a greener
campus, but also to teach interested students how they can be more environmentally friendly both on campus and off.
"The big reason the school should be
behind this is it teaches students to compost. A lot of students have approached us
and want to learn how," Morales said.
According to Morales, Good Food plans
to start small by setting up composting
bins in Tarble and Paces, then in the coffee
bars and lastly in Sharpies. Good Food

members will then take these bins and
deposit them in large concrete bins by the
Scott Arboreteum office, where the food
and containers would then be composted.
After about two months, the compost

would be ready to be spread over campus
garden beds.
Student response to Good Food's recent
efforts has been positive. Students praised
both Good Food and Dining Services for
the commitments they have made to the
two new endeavors.
"I think the changes are a great step
because Swarthmore students are already
so environmentally conscious, and now
Dining Services is showing that they really want to be a part of that. I know that
there were changes in Sharpies last year,
so it seems like a lot of progress is being
made," Angelica Saada 'lO said. "My sister
went to Mount Holyoke, and they composted there, so it's good to see that
Swarthmore will be doing the same soon."

prices of the coffee and tea have not risen.
Dining Services Cash Operations
Manager Gusti Ruhri estimates that the

price of the compostable containers is
approximately twice that of the previously
used ones.

Despite the drastic rise in expenditures.
Rhuri is excited about the new containers.
"I'm nervous about [this change] because
of the budget, but I think that it's a good
change to make. I'm very happy about this.

It's important that students care about this
it's their future, their environment."
Ruhri said.
After its success with compostable containers, Good Food is continuing its work
by way of a food-composting project.
Already approved by the college, Good
Food is currently working on securing
funds for this project. Having received previous support from the Lang Center,
Student Budget Committee and the Scott
Arboretum, Good Food is once again in
talks with these groups about funding.

Orientation reformed to create closer bonds
BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore.edu
Although orientation week is over,
some first-year students from the Class of
2011 might still be Sharple-ing it up with
their Campus Advisor group, or at least the
Dean's Office is hoping. The way CA
groups fit into orientation has changed for
the first time in twenty years, in
both"structure and composition," according to Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal. Newly-appointed Associate Dean
for Academic Affairs Garikai Campbell '9O
worked to arrange CA groups according to
a new system intended to improve the orientation experience, since they were previously arranged randomly
The Orientation Committee wanted to
reform the philosophy of CA groups after
interviewing prospective
CAs who
expressed discontent about their own past
experiences, according to OC member
Emma Ogathey 'O9. Indeed, CA Stephanie
Appiah 'lO commented that as a first-year
she had "skipped out on activities sometimes."
Several ideas for reorganization were
proposed in the OC, but "we really didn't
have time," Ogathey said. Dean Campbell
planned the reorganization. "[He] first
approached us in the middle of June, soon
after he stepped into his role as Associate
Dean for Academic Affairs," Orientation
Committee Co-Chair Doug Gilchrist-Scott
'O9.

The effect of the reorganization was "to
create CA groups that had some natural
connection and would last longer," according to Westphal. The Deans hoped students
would form strong academic connections
with each other and find a "unifying connection
not something people would necessarily choose," Westphal said.
Ideally, the CA groups would fulfill a
role similar to Facebook, to "build a network of familiar faces," Westphal said.
...

Dean Campbell experimented by purposely and thoughtfully forming the CA
groups, such that the groups contained
pockets of students with similar academic

interests.

For instance,

three students in a group
might have had an interest
in art history, where
another three students in
the same group might have
had an interest in engineering. Campbell also
made an

effort to put
together "pairs of people

with the same advisor or
advisors who are nearby
each other," he said,
adding that he used
extracurricular interests
as a secondary factor. At
the same time, he tried to
diversity
create some
within the groups.
"It's not like everyone
with an engineering interest is in one CA group,"
Campbell said. "Instead,
we created groups of 10 in
which pockets of students
share some academic
interests."

Although
bonding
through academic experi-

ence was the theoretical
intent, CAs felt that the

students coalesced better

because there were more

interactive activities.
Despite its intent, students rarely discussed or
bonded over their academic-interests, according to

Appiah. "We dismissed the course of study
never asked them what they were studying because we didn't want to divide the
groups," she said. It was more about "being
together and goal-oriented," such as pressing for everyone to pass the swimming test
together as a group.
CA Rodrigo Luger 'lO Luger experi...

enced a similar situation where the academics did not facilitate relationships
between his CA group members. Yet,
according to him, neither did the activities.
"The [orientation] activities only worked

to a certain extent. Our CA group was
mostly quiet arid I didn't feel like they
became good friends," Luger said. He contrasted the activities to the pre-orientation
hike where students "bonded through the
excitement of the experience together."

"There were some groups that worked

out better than others," Campbell said.
Nat Sufrin 'll agreed that discussions of
academics did not play out much in his
CA group. Nonetheless, he enjoyed the
group activities. "It was nice to go to a meal
and automatically sit with people," Sufrin

said. However, "[the groups] didn't gel
completely and there was no complete
sense of unity
no sense of comfort, but
everyone was really nice." Sufrin attributed some of the awkwardness to the natural aura of the first few weeks of college.
"People were quiet because we were overwhelmed and nervous," he said. Despite
the kinks, Sufrin's final judgment was positive. "I was friendlier with people from
my CA group
and I want to get to know

On

Monday,

the Communications
Information and Technology
launched a new Campus
Calendar Web site (http://calendar.swathmore.edu) in response to a growing need
for an accessible venue for publicizing
events. The site consolidates many types of
events with one Web-based format.
Categories include academic calendar, arts
and culture, althletics, lectures, public
events and student events. The site also
features information on planning an event
and a "submit events" form that allows
new events to be added the system.
"This will evolve organically into whatever the campus most wants it to be," said
Director of Communications Nancy
Nicely. "It can be used in a variety of ways
and we hope that it is."

A team of "super users"

and also to see everyone's events in the

"People will get a

sense of the flavor of

what goes on here. There's such a diversity of events on campus, which [the calendar] captures in a snapshot way," Nicely

said.

The pre-existing Event Management
System will now be referred to as "Space
Reservations." When hosting an event, a
group must first use Space Reservations to
secure a location and then publicize it on
the campus calendar.
According to Manager of Web Projects
for ITS Kelley Mueller, features built into
the calendar allow users to create e-mail
subscriptions to the types of events that
interest them, create RSS feeds and download events to calendars like iCal. Also, the
design and layout is conducive to easy
viewing and images complement the
events listings.
The project of producing the new calendar system began last spring, when
Mueller monitored Reserved Students

Digest (the popular student-run e-mail listserv) and found that over seventy percent
of messages in the digest were event publicity. In addition, student Dashboard comments and voices around campus highlighted the need for a renovated calendar

and the Communications Office used
Active Data Calendar software to design
and develop the Website and worked diligently over the summer to complete it in
time for its recent launch.

According to Mueller, EMS carries out
essential activities that many people are
unaware of, from conserving energy by

grass mowing at times when exams are not
in session.
Mueller also said she hopes the new
campus calendar will help decrease

While ITS explored the option of reconfiguring the front end of EMS for calendar

'War': What is it good for? Absolutely nothing
BY ABBY GRABER

An open letter to the gangsters, mob bosses, and hitmen
of Hollywood:
A recent viewing of "War"

safety
and

protection.
Due to your
inability to

reviewers until

such time that you can demonstrate that you know more
than we do about building an evil empire. This memo will
guide you to a strong future in mayhem, corruption, murder
and general knavery.
We would like to begin your training by drawing your
attention to examples of poor evildoing from "War." "War"
follows FBI agent Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) as he pursues rogue FBI agent Rogue (Jet Li; writers Lee Anthony
Smith and Gregory Bradley were clearly short several monkeys on typewriters the day they came up with that

films like music videos to compensate for their uninteresting camera work and pedestrian fight choreography, most of
which in "War" is little more than one fully-armed guy
shooting less-prepared foes in the back. We caught on to that
trick back with "Charlie's Angels 2."
Your own behavior could also use a thorough clichecleansing. Do not hold meetings in popular nightclubs, tea
houses or brothels. (Mobsters from "Miami Vice" are
excused on account of artistic justification.) Instead, try
church basements, assisted living communities, and bowling alleys; the FBI will be much less likely to look for you
there. And please, for the love of God, pause, reflect and
reconsider before you ever, EVER tell a henchman to "take
him out of my sight and kill him." Unless you follow up that
command with an order for sharks with frickin' laser beams
attached to their heads,-we don't want to hear it.
Ultimately, you have a duty as a Hollywood criminal to be
entertaining as well as nefarious. If you are not interested in
karate-chopping your foes, do not engage in Jet Li films.
Much that was wrong with "War" could have been overlooked if the ratio of karate-chopping to shooting people in

moniker). Rogue, meanwhile, pits two LA. gangs against
each other for reasons of his own. The villains in "War" are
exceptionally dim, and it is the worst movie of its genre
since 2002's "Ballistic: Ecks v. Sever." In fact, it is even worse
because it lacks a funny title. We hope that the following discussion will convince you to seek the help that you so desperately need.
An evil mastermind must select his henchmen with
detailed attention to their performance and loyalty. A hench-

man who has double-crossed your greatest enemy may seem

promising. However, bodyguards with past records of
slaughtering their employers rarely make good long-term
investments, especially if your long-term plans include vital
activities like "breathing" and "living."
You will notice the immense stupidity ofmob boss Chang
(John Lone) to hire Rogue knowing nothing about him
except that he had betrayed both the FBI and rival mob boss
Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi). You should not have been surprised
when Rogue started killing everyone in sight, including
Chang's gang.
On the subject of surprises, you will notice that "War" is
suffering from a critical dearth. A supervillain should
always keep his friends, enemies and paying audience members on their toes. To that end, he should avoid the multitude
of cliches in which "War" so ineptly invests. Speak to your
cinematographers. If they are consistently and without
irony zooming in for close-ups as characters pause to don
sun-glasses and stare sullenly into the distance, you may
need to have them shot. You should also refuse to work for
directors like Philip Atwell, who insist on jump editing their

the back had been significantly greater.
As it was, Li was utterly wasted. If you are interested in
having audiences understand anything going on, do not
engage in Jason Statham films. Or, in a pinch, hire him a
diction coach, because Guy Ritchie told him to mumble back
in 1998, and he clearly hasn't had any further direction since.
In order to assure us of your good faith in this enterprise,
please raise your right hand and repeat the following oath:
I will only entrust important tasks to henchmen who I
have met in person and whose loyalty has never been in

question.
I will not be predictable or tacky.
IfI insist on fighting Jet Li, I will only do so with my bare
hands. If I insist on fighting Jason Statham, I will endeavor
to ensure that his shirt is ripped off, if only to alleviate the

boredom of my viewers.
I will not play with my food before killing it.
We eagerly await your improvement in "The Brazilian
Job." Until then, good luck and godspeed.

Swarthmore local Farmers' Market satisfies with organic produce
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Saturday afternoons bring an unusually
busy crowd to the generally empty parking
lot across from Swarthmore's Co-op. In
place of parked cars stand a dozen tents
shading colorful containers of fruit, vegetables and baked goods. Between 10 a.m. and
2 p.m., a steady stream of pedestrians
meander from tent to tent, perusing the
offerings of Swarthmore's weekly Farmers'
Market.

The

produce ranges from standard
berries to homemade bratwurst to
Chester County wines produced by a 100
percent solar-powered vineyard. All of the
vendors, who hail from towns close to
Swarthmore, are eager to chat about their
largely organic production methods and
the benefits of eating locally grown food.
Some, however, are reluctant to reveal the
secret of creating the perfect jam.
Swarthmore's Farmers' Market is sponsored by both the Co-op and the Borough of
Swarthmore. For a fee, farmers are allowed
to attend and retain all of their sales profits. According to Nancy Bernhardt of
Indian Orchards, most of the same vendors
return from week to week and even from
year to year. The connection between producer and consumer was apparent as
Bernhardt briefly took her eyes off of her
stand to greet a girl who has visited Indian
Orchards virtually since birth.
The market's attendees are quick to
praise the farmers and their goods. Natalie
Anderson, an English professor at

THE PHOENIX

Swarthmore, has been frequenting the
Farmers' Market for the past two years.
"Just looking at this stuff makes you feel
healthy," she said, gazing at a row of lettuce.
"Usually it's like a faculty meeting," she

said, when asked how many Swarthmore
the
professors
frequent
market.
Unfortunately, Swarthmore students do not
know the Farmers' Market as well as the
faculty. Prices at the market are more
expensive than at a typical supermarket,
but its regular customers would argue that
it is money well spent for the high-quality
produce and a break from Sharpies. Most
vendors, upon realizing that they have
found a Swarthmore student, ask that the
word be spread across campus. "Tell your
friends," is a common refrain.
Still, weekly markets are something of a
teaser. "[Farmers' markets] enable people
to have a taste," said a Stargazers Vineyard
representative armed with small sample
cups of wine. Vendors come to the market
to entice a variety of people to come visit
their farms. Pamphlets displayed at many
produce tents advertise berry and apple
picking.
Although
Swarthmore's Farmers'
Market itself is only in its second year, it's
only one of many such markets that spread
across the heart and periphery of
Philadelphia, serving localized groups of
consumers. Swarthmore's market is part of
a larger effort to increase the consumption
of locally grown produce in the
Philadelphia area. Organizations such as

So, why visit the Farmers' Market next
Saturday? According to Local Food Philly's
website, buying local not only ensures the
freshest produce, but also directly supports
family farms and preserves open space and
farmland.
Perhaps a more simple answer is that
there isn't a more satisfying way to support
the Swarthmore community than buying a

'Riot'-ing at Swarthmore

The Riot Group seeks to revolutionalize theater through a week-long residency and performances

biggest commercial and critical successes.
"The Riot Group doe's very politically-conscious work.
I would say not exactly political work but they do work
that is politically informed and [sparks] dialogue with
current events," Kuharski said.' The two plays being
shown in LPAC are no exception. "Pugilist Specialist"
features a group of American soldiers attempting a
covert assassination of a Middle Eastern leader, while
"Hearts of Man" tackles the issue of child predators in
today's hyper-mediated world.
Yet, the Riot Group aims for more than just being
timely with the nightly news. Having returned to the
U.S. after his residency with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, Shaplin and his collaborators noticed a preponderance of stories about Internet sex offenders.
Watching NBC's "To Catch a Predator," Shaplin began to
wonder, "How do you defend a guy guilty of the most
...

It's Saturday morning, five days before the world premiere in Philly of his new play "Hearts of Man," when
Adriano Shaplin tells me over the phone, "I didn't finish
the script until yesterday." The comment throws me off

for a second.
After all, Shaplin has been the Royal Shakespeare
Company's first international resident playwright and
has garnered praise from the likes of critics Tony
Kushner and Ben Brantley. Rest assured, Shaplin, who
along with his theatre group is bringing "Hearts of Man"
to Swarthmore this coming Sunday, is the last person to
take his craft lightly. He relates to me this slightly worrisome piece of information only to make a point.

"When you're writing a play, you
have to write about what you don't
know about. You never write what
you do know
For me, that's really
only advice for how to write a diary."
Adriano Shaplin
Director of The Riot Group
...

heinous crime?"
Shaplin is adamant about using theater to approach
unanswerable questions. He said, "when you're writing a
play, you have to write what you don't know about. You
never write what you do know. That's the kind of thing
that people tell you a lot: 'write what you know.' For me,
that's really only advice for how to write a diary, not for
how to, write a piece of art."
It's a principle that Shaplin won't compromise on,
even when conducting his workshops. Described as
"action writing" by Kuharski, the workshops will have
participants discovering their own unanswered questions, molding them into the form of a play and performing them. Shaplin guarantees, "My workshops are
extremely labor intensive
I will demand that [they
write] for hours under a series of extremely strict exercises."
Some Swarthmore students have already endured
such an experience. In the spring semester of 2006,
Shaplin taught Swarthmore's Playwriting Workshop.
One of Shaplin's students,. Sonny Sidhu 'OB, says, "He
was one of the least professorial professors I've ever had
at Swarthmore. He was very open with his students.
When he praised you, you could tell he really meant it.
When he criticized you, you could tell he wasn't holding
back for any reason. As a writer, he knew exactly how to
sit down and turn a room full of college students into a
room full of writers."
Three of Shaplin's students went on to become
Swarthmore's first honors playwriting majors. One of
them, Dan Hodson 'O9, hopes to have Adriano as his thesis advisor. Hodson stated, "He seemed to be very big on
just letting the dialogue create the scene and wasn't real
big to use a lot- of scene descriptions."
Strangely, Shaplin takes a decidedly traditionalist
stance when it comes to dialogue. Shaplin's plays are
mostly comprised of words, with little action, and his
...

-

Shaplin develops his plays as they are being
rehearsed. For the past ten years, he has worked almost
exclusively with the same four cast members, now
known as The Riot Group. In recent years, the group has
expanded to include Maria Shaplin and Paul Schnabel.
Shaplin also serves as the director, sound technician and
sometimes as an actor for his company, something
unheard of in today's theater world. In part, it's because
of Shaplin's distinct method of creating theater that
Swarthmore's Department of Theater has taken such an
interest in him.
Department Head Allen Kuharski said Shaplin's
approach is "not a typical way for a playwright to work
and be processed in American theater, but it's very close
to what we teach in our department as a model."
Shaplin started The Riot Group with fellow students
Stephanie Viola and Andrew Friedman, when he was an
undergraduate at Sarah Lawrence College. This coming
week, the actors will be Swarthmore residents. Starting
Sept. 9, they will be running workshops, visiting theater
classes and performing "Hearts of Man." The troupe will
also perform "Pugilist Specialist," one of the troupe's

12

words are usually in the form of flowery blank verse.
Interestingly, "Hearts of Man" is mostly in iambic pentameter. As a result, we have gems like the description of
a hot dog by the eager-to-offend Lieutenant Freud in
"Pugilist Specialist": "It is the distillation of some
swine's hopes and dreams, the reordered flesh of a once
noisy creature. Someone took the raw material of life
and transformed it into something meaningful, and beautiful and delicious. And it is your responsibility to consume this hot dog and transform it into energy; energy
which will assist you in the seduction and evaporation of

our enemies."

"It is the distillation of some swine's
hopes and dreams, the reordered
flesh of a once noisy creature
it is
your responsibility to consume this
hot dog and transform it into energy."
Excerpt of "Pugilist Specialist"
...

Shaplin doesn't feel his overly eloquent dialogue is
antithetical to his naturalistic approach to rehearsals.
He finds that theater that tries to be realistic and relatable ends up being just the opposite, citing Shakespeare
"as one of the least sentimental writers that you can
find."
"I almost walked out of a show where characters were
discussing the frequency of the movie 'The Godfather' on
cable. I'm really opposed to that. I'm really opposed to
plays that congratulate the audience for having the right
opinion of something," Shaplin said. "And I'm really
opposed to plays that just .test people's pop culture
knowledge or [are] a series of references to cultural artifacts. That's not what theater is supposed to do."
In spite of their status as critical darlings, Shaplin
and The Riot Group are at odds with the theater establishment, which is part of their appeal for Kuharski.

"Why they're exciting to me, why they're original and
innovative, is also why they have a hard time getting
support and promotion," Kuharski said.
Shaplin has a much simpler spin on his troupe's
unique setup.
"We thought of ourselves as really cutting edge until,
after being together for ten years, we realized we're actually extremely old-fashioned. We make plays in the same
basic way that groups of artists and actors have made
plays for hundreds of years."

Wobegone.
Presumably, Shalit imagined these longer shirts being
worn with pants. The fashion industry, in summer celebration of the bare leg, seems to have less modest intentions. Fall fashion spreads, on the other hand, are filled
with Shalit-approved clothes. Vogue's Sarah Mower sings
the praises of the scarf, musing, "In a jacket, in the neckline of a dress or T-shirt, [it's] a way of flagging that
you're fully conversant with the growing noughties preference for modesty." Pages are devoted to sweater sets
and pencil skirts, shoes that match belts that match bags.
With fitted suits, tailored dresses and spectator pumps,
the look emulates '2os vamps and '4os screen icons.

This season's look seems less about an embrace of
than a "return
to riches." Gone are the aggressively mismatched patterns, prairie skirts and haphazard layering of seasons
past, swallowed by newly-revived furs, houndstooth capes
and prim strands of pearls. Spending huge amounts of
money to dress like you don't have any is so 1997. This season, the idea is to look unabashedly expensive. Jean Hanff
Korelitz recalls an article the, 1970s "free to be...me" mindset. "If you wanted to wear your Chanel jacket with jeans,
that was your right as a child of the universe. If you wanted to wear your Yves Saint Laurent dress with flip-flops,
what was he going to do? Stop you?" The idea is to look
like you don't care: oh, this old thing? Well, it's either
Missoni or Wal-Mart, it's just oh-so-hard to remember
which!"
Korelitz rightly points out that dressing down to dress
up is a privilege reserved for wealthy. You can only wear
ripped jeans down Fifth Avenue, a Hermes scarf tied
shtetl-fabulously around your neck if it's clear you could
be wearing head-to-toe designer. If the fashion industry
has anything to say about it, the age of mix and match is
over.
This year, designers are creating collections that don't
"tolerate dressing down," and Vogue seems ready to celebrate. The well-dressed woman of today is the Bette Davis
secretary of yesteryear: the kittenish clothes of a sexedup typist on an executive budget.
Now, runway models are sporting the whole shebang:
coiffed hair, buttoned-up collars and all. If you read it as
a direct (but dainty!) antidote to 1980s shoulder-padded,
menswear-inspired fashions, you can argue that the trend
sort of "empowers" traditional women's wear.
No longer relegated to the girl Friday, that figure in
the pearls and the tweed sheath might just as well be the
CEO: the high-powered woman no longer needs to masquerade as a man. Maybe. On the other hand, I can't help
wonder if this season's sweater sets embody a Shalitapproved nostalgia for those pre-Betty Freidan halcyon

I have moved
from Opinions
into the Living &
Arts section here
at The Phoenix;

this comes about
so that I can be a resource for students/faculty/staff interested in environmentally conscious lifestyles instead of
acting as a raving greenboat. So look forward to big tips
and environmental events all this semester
but let's
start small, and look at the current state of Swarthmore as
we begin this year.
Many of you, like me, ended up at Ikea to shop for
housewares, and probably noticed their environmentally
conscious placards and policies. Ikea is charging for plastic bags customers use to reduce waste (while selling
reusable tote bags), using many recyclable packing materials and sporting energy-efficient compact fluorescent
light bulbs. At the same time, however, Ikea is notorious
for causing huge traffic problems and promoting long commutes for customers, which goes against the first principle
of fighting global climate change: look local! Also, Ikea still
imports global material in many of its products, meaning
huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.
While the impact of customers commuting to Ikea and
their super-global import networks are detrimental to the
environment and social communities, they demonstrate a
rapidly increasing awareness of institutional responsibility for environmental issues. Ikea seems to be ahead of the
pack for most large consumer stores on environmental
awareness, and I am hoping that spreads to its shoppers.
September 6, 2007

&

Ikea

We can apply Ikea's practices to our shopping at
Swarthmore by taking van carpools to Genuardi's and
Target, or even better: walk or bike to the Co-op!
Now, how does Swarthmore fit in on the scale of
instructional responsibility for environmental sustainability? Many magazines and websites issued sustainability
reviews of U.S. college campuses, and, sadly, Swarthmore
didn't make any list that I saw (despite our 40% wind-power
victory this spring). Why? One big reason is that we have
not signed the American College and University
Presidents Climate Commitment. It is a document that
commits universities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by 80% by 2050, and it has currently been signed by 347 colleges and universities across the nation. With our prowess,
idealism and endowment, can we really afford not to take
that leap?
On the other hand, who cares about signing some piece
of paper as long as we have sustainability efforts on campus? We have increased our wind power purchasing drastically, and now freshmen are given a CFL bulb for thenroom with information on the CFLs and, more importantly, wise energy use in general. An Environmental Studies
Senior Seminar even produced "The Greening of
Swarthmore," a detailed plan to make Swarthmore a more
environmentally sustainable institution. With school projects like the student garden and biodegradable serving
materials (available in Essie Mae's and the Coffee Bars),
we are doing very well compared with just two years ago.
The only problem is that these initiatives are mostly
coming from the students. Step it up, Al! We need collaboration between administrators and students with a commitment from the administration to stopping climate
change as a unified statement of solidarity. All the schools
that top the lists for sustainability have devoted offices of
sustainability with coordinators and assistants, paid students working on these issues and a publicly outspoken

and committed administration.

So in your green lifestyle here at Swat, look out for
ways to encourage and support the administration's efforts
to go green. Tell Dining Services you are excited about
biodegradable plates. Ask the deans about wind power. Tell
your hallmates to recycle, recycle, recycle. Make an obsession with turning off light switches. We're inheriting this
let's make sure we have it to pass on to the next
globe

generation.

We're older than Kevin Durant, Sean Kingston and

the incoming students so much: it's a combination of nostalgia and self-confidence that can usually only be found

As I crept my way across the campus toward the blaring reggaeton that was assailing my senses with its typical homogeneousness and the promise of free food, I
encountered a friendly group of well-dressed students
who smiled happily, introduced themselves and asked for
the usual contact information.
Briefly stunned by their fresh faces and good manners, it took me a moment to realize that despite my
stained athletic shorts, four days' facial hair growth that
had taken three weeks to develop and jaundiced eye, I
had been identified as one of them. I had been indoctrinated into their new world, and was marked, despite my
best efforts to dirty myself in a way no self-respecting

new attendee would do, as a freshman.
As the requisite secret depression spread when I told
the group I was 21, I saw six pairs of eyes widen at the
real-life opportunity to encounter a battle-hardened veteran who could surely assist with their adjustment to the
dreaded Swarthmore work environment.
Part of me immediately recoiled at these understandable requests for aid and I wanted to tell them that they
shouldn't ask me for anything more than how to cultivate a Jew-fro (avoid showering) and possibly a recommendation of an above-average indie group whose second album probably will suck (Beach House). How could
I, after three years of ill-made extension requests,
imbroglios of the heart and other misadventures, suddenly be in the position to tell others to follow my path?
For god's sake, I didn't even realize there was cheese in
the condiment bar until late last spring. Then, in a heartbeat, a narratively convenient flashback struck.

From my first meeting before the barbecue to the
sight of a "dry" Paces party, freshman orientation was a
bizarre mix of new and old that left me feeling a bit disoriented. During the admissions play, as I sat
with a group of seniors snickering at the more

wholesome advice in the work, I happened to

I remembered how, trembling with fear, I had gathered with my hallmates during the third day of school

After all, they were so much mere laid-back than the

Blogging: the end of writing as we know it
By now, most blogdon't matter.
Blogging, like indie
music, has bulged and
spawned to the point
gers

that there are separate
and

mainstream

underground components to the thing that

JOSH COHEN

I Got the Bullets

tle bit rock n'roll

was once the underground. The terms are
misleading
a
bit
because I'd consider
lesser-read blogs adopting a mainstream phi-

losophy to be "mainstream"
[i]
and
because, in truth, most
blogs are probably a

little bit country, a litbut, still, the contrast works in order

to show how blogging is becoming stagnant and mattering less.
The mainstream philosophy of blogging, which is obviously a later development in the history of the thing,
sanctifies self-expression. This is because it is shaped by
those that love their own opinions, particularly the politically-minded. The MO of the mainstream is Mattering,
i.e. creating ideas (which, clearly, is an ambition fueled
by the way that earlier blogs, the bastards, managed to
matter so much). The truth is that by blogging to Be
Heard, mainstream bloggers add nothing; by trying to
matter, they don't. Their efforts are as symbolic, and
empty, as Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton's blogs.
The bloggers that matter have burrowed into the
underground of the underground in order to continue to
shake up the superterranean. There they're virtually
literally freed from the temptations of professionalism.
They subsist on spreading news, rather than on other people's approval. They promote others' ideas (art and fiction, too); not their own. Matt Drudge, the Libertarian
middle-aged fedora-wearing paranoid high-school
dropout and self-described "failed bar mitzvah," of the
Drudge Report, who implicitly bashes the NY Times
while printing their paid advertisements, is an example.
Iti the UG of the UG, bloggers don't try to create ideas but
settle, simply, for replicating them.
I tried to matter this summer by blogging for a new
politics and culture (i.e. Everything) online magazine.
Here are some observations about the "dialogue" I was
participating in that make it, and made me, so entirely
unproductive.

I. It's impossible to have an original voice. Blogging
is never writing. At it's best, it approaches the sort of collage-like text comprised entirely of quotes and references

that Walter Benjamin envisioned, but that applies to the
really good (and rare) blogger who manages to invent an
individual personality by constantly linking to the things
and people that he believes in. That blogger is obsessed
with one thing in a way that is anti-social (and if he gets
deemed an expert, he gets hired by an actual publication).
The elite world of blogging
which gives lesser-read
"mainstream" blogs their philosophy, and which old
Mainstream people wishfully refer to as the "blogosmirrors the lived social world of journalists and
phere"
pundits, which is predicated on networking and relative
power. Basically, you must claim authority while being
constantly deferent to other people's authority. Risks, i.e.
creativity, are not amenable to mainstream blogging
because your existence is predicated on gaining clout.
a. You also have the uniformizing tendency.
Mainstream bloggers all sound the same. There's a
lingo and set of cliches (e.g. the phrase "Over at," in
reference to another blog, or the use of oddly flatter
ing adjectives before names of other bloggers, such as
"the estimable Eric") that they employ conscious
to the effect of making them
ly, then unconsciously
all seem worthless. Maybe ,you can justify the repeti
tiveness of the blogosphere by the fact that's it predi
cated on the inherent value in circulation but you
can't consider it creative, which is sort of a prerequi
site for a good idea. Really, reporting
not fiction,
diary-keeping or opinionating
is the thing most rev
olutionized by blogging. Sites like The Drudge Report,
Gawker or baseball-reference.com add something by
saying nothing.

L I mean, no one can produce a thought worth
reading at the speed with which professional
bloggers are required to do so. Free association
and off-the-cuffconversation is something valu
able to the private sphere that becomes serious
flummery when publicized. It brought out the
worst in me.
11. The unspoken mandate for contrarianism. A
good way to consistently produce originality, though, is to
be a fundamentalist contrarian. Ifyou're competing to get
read, you have to scream, "READ ME!" and you have to
do so amidst the 100,000 new blogs that appear every day
(whereas USA Today is, still, somehow always sitting at
your hotel door). Now, your community is narrower if,
like I was, you are in the elite community of bloggers,
because they all pretty much link to themselves. Yet, really, in this incestuous mini-universe there is even greater
pressure to be contrarian, because it is mostly comprised

111. Constant commentary. If a mainstream blog doesn't allow comments, it is ostracized by the blogosphere for
not being open. Sometimes, the comments section can be
more worthwhile than the original post [2] (though this may
simply be because expectations of insight are pretty low, so
surprising depth is common). Mostly, though, comments on
blogs are made by people also trying to Matter, and end up
saying much more about human psychology than the topic
at hand. Worse, they offer a chance for a writer, playing
blogger, to feed his neurotic obsessive writer's personality
by constantly checking
and resisting making anonymous rebuttals to
the comments to his posts. At one
point this summer, I thought, this isn't the writer's life.

There's no

quiet, and you're

never alone.

By blogging to Be Heard, mainstream bloggers add nothing; by trying to matter, they don't.
Actually, it was a Swattie, Justin Hall, who is considered to be "the founding father of personal blogging." As a
college student in 1994, Hall created "Justin's Links from
the Underground". Hall, who designed a special major in
"Meaning, Context, and Media", is the brilliant kind of nerd
any of us can imagine, the one who prefers to make it happen on stage from behind the scenes. But his blog, which
began as an extrospective tour of the then-nascent Web,
devolved into relentless introspection. That's the same natural trend in blogging happening with its mainstream-ification. If blogging is going to last longer than a decade, the
"links from the underground" are going to have to reclaim
their sphere from the narcissistic pseudo-Opinions columnists attracted to the phenomenon. But I'm no blogger, so
take it from Justin, "freshperson in the dorm of Willets,"
circa 1994, who justified an early posting of a photo he

direction, it was but a mere stepping-stone towards a more effective
approach to alcohol awareness on

States, saying,

"We

strongly
protest the unilateral measures taken by the U.S.
Congress and government that have only persecut-

ed and exacerbated the mistreatment of Mexican
undocumented workers." Clearly, illegal immigration still poses a problem for us, but the "temporary worker" program proposed by our Congress
seems like a promising way to alleviate it in the
future.
Many of us know of the numerous challenges
that illegal immigrants face. First of all, they cannot work legally in the U.S., meaning that they
have to scramble to earn bread by taking odd jobs
such as construction work and house cleaning.
Furthermore, they cannot receive higher education and proper medical care.
That said, illegal immigrants constitute an integral part of our economy. According to the
American Immigration Law Foundation, 2.9 million Mexicans immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s
alone, and the proportion of Mexican workers in
the U.S. workforce has doubled during the same
period. Tens of thousands of these immigrants
came to the U.S. illegally.
The research by AILF demonstrates that the
growth of the U.S. economy has become dependent
on illegal immigrants. In fact, the organization also
estimates that "nearly 43 percent ofall job openings
by 2010 will require only a minimal education, at a
time when native-born Americans are obtaining
college degrees in record numbers and are unlikely to accept positions requiring minimal education."

To the president of Mexico and to many U.S. citizens, it seems fundamentally unfair that, while
the growth of the U.S. economy depends on these
workers, American laws do not help them. For
example, under the current immigration law, illeSeptember 6, 2007

become U.S. citizens.
The U.S. government could help the illegal

immigrants by granting citizenship to them.
However, this would mean condoning illegal immigration
essentially, the government would
reward the people who break its laws. Such policy
would also make little sense because it would not
necessarily reduce the number of people who live
here illegally.

According to the American
Immigration Law Foundation,
2.9 million Mexicans immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s
alone, and the proportion of
Mexican workers in the U.S.
workforce has doubled during
the same period.
But, there is an alternative solution and it
seems like it might work. The "temporary worker"
program, if approved by Congress, has the potential to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.
This is because it will enable the foreigners who
would otherwise come to the U.S. illegally to enter
and work here lawfully therefore not cutting the
supply of immigrants that the U.S. economy needs.
In summary, this program would target the problem of illegal immigration effectively by increasing
the opportunity for legal entrance into the country.
As proposed in Congress, the law that will allow
temporary workers to come to the U.S. will also
require them to eventually leave the country for
some time. By returning them to their home countries, the government hopes guest workers will
spread the knowledge and whatever technical
expertise they might have gained to their peers.
Thus, as an added benefit, human capital would
increase in those nations.

The "temporary worker" program, if adopted,
will help the U.S. accomplish some of its short-term
and long-term goals. In the short run, it will allow
the U.S. to curb illegal immigration without disturbing its high rate of economic growth. In the
long run, it will allow other, less technologicallyadvanced nations to accumulate human capital.
This means that, in the future, the world will contain more developed countries, and, hopefully, a
safer global environment.

Volleyball team chemistry shines through for Swat
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
Having a comfortable and relaxing start
to the season is obviously not the Garnet
volleyball team's style. Instead, by traveling out of their normal region of play to
SUNY-Cortland's Red Dragon Classic last

weekend, the women faced off against some
of the nation's toughest teams in their first
official matches of the season. Swarthmore
dropped its matches against SUNYFredonia, Stevens Institute of Technology,
tanked 21st in the nation going into the
contest and Montclair State University, but
ended the weekend with a sweep of Buffalo
State College.

"Even if we don't win them
all, we're still able to trust
each other going into the

next game."
Johanna Bond 'lO
Though some of the team members were
little disappointed with the 1-3 record
coming out of the event, any dismay over
the statistics was overshadowed by the
squad's visible improvement and display of

£

team chemistry.
"We're not taking it easy," coach
Harleigh Leach said. "We're really trying
to get ourselves prepared to play our conference. [The weekend] was a great team
effort."

The greatest excitement of the weekend
came out of the Garnet taking the first
game of the best-of-five match from the talented Stevens Tech squad. Though the
Ducks came back to win 27-30, 30-18, 30-14,
30-13, Swarthmore knows that its play in
that game is indicative of what it can do
down the road this season. "We actually
ourselves when we were playing
Stevens Tech," Karen Berk 'OB said. "I
think we surprised them as well. That was
kind of a big game for us. It really showed
us what we can do and how competitively
we can play."

Jen Wang 'O9 led the squad in the Stevens
Tech match with 10 kills, and co-captain
Erin Heaney 'O9 contributed 16 digs.
Sandwiched on either side of its promising game against the Ducks, Swarthmore
was swept by SUNY-Fedonia, 22-30, 21-30,
26-30 and Montclair State, 25-30,24-30, 28-30.
The Garnet was able to head home on a positive note, however, as it convincingly took
down Buffalo State in the final match of the
Classic, 30-19,30-17,30-18. "It was exciting to
be able to travel outside of the area and we
got to see teams that we don't normally
see," Johanna Bond 'lO said. "We feel like
we could have done better ... but we ended
on a win and that was important."
Co-captain Katie Gold 'OB (11 kills)
stepped up to join Wang (12 kills) on the
leaderboard for the Garnet against the
Bengals, and rookie Sarah Lambert 'll had
a strong performance with 15 digs. Kearney
Bangs 'lO displayed her offensive prowess
with five service aces in the match.
The team is also feeling good about coming out of a preseason that was successful
both on and off the court, as the women
took time to help the first-years get
acquainted with the Philadelphia area and
put in quality bonding time together.
"The team really spent a lot of time

working on their chemistry and bonding,
and I saw that reflected in our play this
weekend," Leach said.
"We feel like we're in pretty good shape.
It adds confidence when you get on the
court because you know that you've done
those sprints," Bond said. The team also
has a closeness this year that should work
to its advantage. "We all like each other,"
Bond said, "so even if we don't win them
all, we're still able to trust each other going
into the next game."

This weekend the team will host a trimatch in Tarble Pavilion, facing off against
Neumann College at
11 a.m. and
Marymount College at 3 p.m. The Garnet
struggled against Neumann two weeks ago
at the Swat Preseason SpikeFest, but since

then has had a chance to work out the
kinks and is hungry for revenge. "I'm
expecting us to definitely be more prepared
than we were for them when we scrimmaged them," Leach said.

somehow. Then it hit me like a
with a hockey skate: college football jumped off this week-

have ever seen. The fifth-ranked
University of Michigan dropped a
against
34-32
barnburner
Appalachian State, the defending
division I-AA champs, in a game
that was harder to swallow than
Indian bar. What makes this game
both inspiring and shocking is the

fact that it should have been more
of a blowout than the Mike Tyson
v. Peter McNielly fight. What started as a simple tune-up game for
coach Lloyd Carr and
the
Wolverines turned into a disastrous and embarrassing loss for a

coach who was already in the hot
seat. I wouldn't be surprised to see
Carr waiting on tables at Tom
Jones in a few months, and when I
order a drink and he asks, "Is
Pepsi okay?" all I can do is say to
him, "No, Lloyd, Pepsi is not okay."
All ribbing aside, Appalachian
State's victory shows that America
still loves to root for the underdog,
and that you never talk shit to the
quiet kid who hasn't said a word

all night; he's dangerous because
he's unpredictable.
Even though only one week of
the season has gone by so far, the
N.Y. Times has already run a
"Heisman Watch" column that
included the stats for some of the
top contenders for the trophy,
including University of Arkansas
running back Darren McFadden
and West Virginia quarterback
Steve Slaton. Some of the statistics
were impressive, but some were
downright ridiculous. For example,

Hawaii quaterback Colt
Brennan went 30-for-40 for 416
yards and 6 touchdowns in the first

September 6, 2007

half against

North Colorado.

Naysayers may believe that he is
just a system quarterback, but anyone who can gain the entire field
four times over in yardage in the
first half is a maniac. Also, Boston
CoUege quarterback Matt Ryan
uncorked 32-for-52 for 408 yards
and five TD's. I don't care who you
are, if you can throw 52 passes in a
game and not have your arm turn
into a piece of wet linguini, you are
something special.

My disgust with the wall-to-wall Michael Vick coverage

but the public's hunger for and reaction to it has
been downright embarrassing. On Sunday, I saw someone
wearing a fake Vick jersey with an "S" in place of a crossedout "V" to spell "Sick." I thought that was a little awkward
to look at and would have hated wear it myself. But a look at
the selection at http://www.cafepress.com reveals that it was
positively mild. One CafePress shirt says "Electrocute
Vick," another has "#7: Dog Killer" on the back, a third
states "I support torturing those who torture dogs" and a
fourth has the even more direct message of "Vick should be
put down." If those aren't enough, there are 542 other ways
to show your contempt (just to show that I'm not immune,
my favorite is "In jail, Vick will be the bitch.")

are we preaching to? I can understand why someone would
want to wear a Barry Bonds-bashing shirt (many of those
are also available on CafePress) since Bonds's steroid use
is still somewhat in doubt and there is still an active
debate about what we should all think of him. Vick, however, has pleaded guilty to participating in and funding
dogfighting and even the few who defended him in the past
have recanted. If the people designing and wearing these
.shirts really want to electrocute or' torture Vick, then
we've got a new (and much more worrisome) debate on our
hands; given that torture is still off the table for the time
being, the shirts make their wearers seem not just selfrighteous, but also a little silly.
Athletes are heroes. This means that when someone
like Vick is involved with something like dogfighting, it's
justifiable to express one's hatred for him on a T-shirt, just
like it's "justifiable" to buy his jersey after being wowed by
his unique athletic talents. But buying a jersey is one of
the best ways to be a fan it's a good conversation starter,
makes you feel giddy when "you" do something great, and
is a lot more fun to wear than one of your five blue golf
shirts. On the other hand, putting "Electrocute Vick" on
your back is not the way to stop dogfighting. It would be
great if the Vick story acted as a catalyst for renewed
efforts to eradicate dogfighting and other cruelty to animals indeed, Vick himself should be at the forefront of
attempts to do so
but there are better ways to show support for this goal.

Kirsten Peterson looks to win posession against Neumann College's Alyssa Collazo in the Swat Kick Classic,
held last weekend. Swarthmore defeated Catholic University in its first game, 1-0, with a goal by Kelsey Cline,
and then took its match against Neumann 3-0. Danielle Tocchet 'OB scored two goals against the Knights and
Caitiin O'Neii added another. The Garnet will look to continue its winning streak tomorrow night, when it hosts
Grinnell College at 7 p.m.

The cross country teams got theirseasons off to a running start at Saturday's Delaware Valley Invitational in
Doylestown, Pa., as the women's team finished third out
of the 15 teams competing and the men's team finished
seventh out of the 19 teams in its race.
The meet saw Garnet women frontrunners Ashley
Davies 'lO and Emma Stanley 'O9 finish their 6K race
eighth and ninth within a second of each other, with
times of 25:33.64 and 25:33.97, respectively.
On the men's side, Jonnie Tompkins 'lO, Ross Weller
'OB, Jon Shoop 'OB and Micky Katz 'OB led the way for the
Garnet men in their 8K race, finishing within two seconds of each other with times of 29:52.93, 29:53.65, 29:54.41
and 29:54.91, respectively, to take the 33rd through 36th
places in the heat.
Besides the men's and women's teams' respective
leaders, many other Garnet runners finished the race in
groups. Finishing 33rd through 36th, the Garnet women's
pack of Caitlin Russell 'll, Lauren Deluca 'lO, Kathy
Feeney 'O9 and Faith Pampel 'O9 all completed the race
within five seconds of each other, with times of 27:39.91,
27:42.94, 27:43.48 and 27:43.48, respectively.
Running in packs was a part of Swarthmore's strategy in the race, according to Chloe Noonan 'lO. "Coach
[Pete Carroll] really stressed that we should stay together with people who are our speed," she said. "Bettina
Tarn ['lo] and I ran together, and we found that we kept
the same speed. It's a good tactic."
Weller said that on Saturday the Garnet "really
worked on pacing, control and discipline. We ran in
packs, which we maintained all the way to the end."
Carroll used Saturday's meet as a chance to learn
more about his runners. "The biggest things I took from
Saturday is each person's fitness level," he said in an email. "Depending [on] how everyone ran and how controlled they were, I can create training groups that have

similar fitness levels."

Despite being pleased with how his teams performed
on Saturday, Carroll acknowledged that both teams have
room for improvement. "At this point we need to get a
couple weeks of continuous training in before we can
talk about goals," he said. "The elders on the team know
what they want to accomplish this year. The rookies just
need to get settled into a routine."
Weller, who would like to see an improvement on the
team's end-of-the-year conference finish, agreed. "We
need to get comfortable running faster," he said. "But
there's plenty of time for that."
The cross country teams are set to run their next
race this Saturday at home in their annual alumni meet
at 12 p.m.

The Humane Society (http://www.hsus.org) has it right
its Web site's featured article highlights the current
progress being made on the dogfighting situation, explains
the need for continued action and never mentions Michael
Vick. It does sell T-shirts, but with the slogan "Real heroes
don't fight dogs"
a positive, non-vitriolic message.
Michael Vick deserves whatever our legal system can give
him. If his story inspires people to take direct action
unless you're a
against dogfighters, great. Otherwise

Garnet men open season with goal-scoring binge
Swarthmore defeats Delaware Valley and Merchant Marine Academy in Garnet Alumni Classic to start 2-0
BY ANNA BAETH

abaethl@swarthmore.edu

OT

The Garnet men's soccer team is beginning this season
with a roar, after ending last fall with a 12-5-2 record and a
spot in the ECAC South Region tournament. There is little
doubt that the Swarthmore men have their work cut out
for them if they hope to continue the success of the recent
past. The squad, led by Coach Eric Wagner, has made it to
three consecutive Centennial Conference Semifinals and
three consecutive ECAC Championship appearances in

2004, 2005 and 2006.
However, if this past weekend was any indication of
Swarthmore's upcoming season, it is clear that the team
could well be going further than ever before. In the tenth
annual Garnet Alumni Classic this weekend, Swarthmore
defeated both Delaware Valley College and the United
States Merchant Marine Academy before an enthusiastic

f

home crowd.
Led by its three captains
Pat Christmas 'OB, Brendan
Grady 'OB and JeffKushner 'O9
the Garnet men crushed
Delaware Valley Saturday night by a score of 10-0. Sunday
evening ended with a 2-1 win over USMMA and four
Garnet men namefl to the Garnet Alumni Classic's AllTournament Team: Christmas, Kushner, Ladule Lako Lo
Sarah 'O9 and Andres Freire 'lO. Overall, though, "the
team played well, but not to [its] full capability," this
weekend Yoi Tibbetts 'O9 said. According to Tibbetts, the
team this season has the most depth he has ever seen,
especially with its new freshman class, which is likely to
see significant playing time this year. The tournament,
says Tibbetts, was really just a chance for the team to see
what it needs to work on for the season. It gave the Garnet
men a chance to test their skills now and see what errors
they can improve on before more important games later
this season.
Freire led the Garnet men against the Aggies, coming
off the bench with a hat trick, and Morgan Langley 'll
added two goals in his first collegiate match. Lako Lo
Sarah had two tallies of his own and Philippe Celestin 'll,
Toby Resch'll and Tibbetts each had one goal. In the comefrom-behind win over the Mariners, Evan Nesterak 'lO and
Kushner each found the back of the net to lead
Swarthmore to victory.

Patrick Christmas juggles for control during Swarthmore's 10-0 win over Delaware Valley last weekend.
At this early point in the season, Swarthmore's lineup
looks solid. The forward line will be anchored by Micheal
Bonesteel 'OB, Omari Faakye 10, Freire and Lake Lo Sarah.
The midfield looks particularly strong this season with

and J.P. Faunes 'OB leading the way. Also making a huge
impact on the team this season will be Dylan Langley 'lO,
Stu Leon 'O9, Andrew Macurdy 'OB, Nesterak, Christopher
Szeto 'O9 and Tibbetts, all of whom have demonstrated
speed and skill.
This season's defense is comprised of veterans
Kushner, Rory Stackpole 'O9 and Grady, an All-Region
selection in 2006, along with Andy Hoot 'lO and Darren
Johnson 'OB, who will also be making larger contributions
to the team this season.
The net will be held down by Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB who
returns this season with a 0.59 save percentage under his
belt. You may also see Jason Thrope 'O9 or Zach Weimar 'lO
in goal this year.
The Garnet men are joined by a group of seven new
first-year faces including forwards Philippe Celestin,
Andreas Lagos and Morgan Langley, midfielders Michael
Nguyentat and Kei Saotome and defenders Toby Resch and
Gage Newman.
"The season has a lot of potential," Sutcliffe said.
"Potential to win the Centennial Conference championships and potential to win an at-large bid for NCAAs."
The Garnet has progressed this season, keeping its general principles like hard-nosed defense while still changing its style and level of play. With the recent incoming
class comes a more offensively-minded squad that adds
creativity to the program and the caliber of play,
Sutcliffe said. However you look at it, this season's men's
soccer team is apparently headed in a new and promising
direction.
Swarthmore faced off against Arcadia College yesterday in a game that was too late for publication, and will
travel to Skidmore College this weekend to play the
Thoroughbreds on Friday and Montclair State University
on Saturday. You can see the Garnet men's soccer team
either in its gorgeous team photo inside the Lamb Miller
Field House (there are a few hidden surprises, including

some golden cleats and leopard print boxers) or on
Saturday, September 15th at 7:00 p.m. in its next home
game against Centennial Conference rival Johns Hopkins
University.
