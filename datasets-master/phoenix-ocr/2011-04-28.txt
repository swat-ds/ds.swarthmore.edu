Dems to advocate Pell grants in D.C.
BY ELI SIEGEL
esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

About 10 members of the College
Democrats will travel to Washington D.C.
on May 2 to speak with several congressmen about the issue of federal funding for
Pell grants. As this semester saw no
major elections, the College Dems felt
that this trip would be a productive culmination to the year.
"[The trip to D.C] is something we've
done in the past," Peter Gross 'l3, president of College Dems, said. "It's a great
way to get experience in the political sec-

tor."

The goal of the trip is to advocate the
federal Pell Grant program, which pro-

vides need-based non-loan aid to lowincome undergraduates. In 2009-2010,
almost eight million students nationwide
received Pell Grants. Within the past
month, Congress has voted to support the
program through 2011. However, the
College Dems would like to see Congress
support the system in 2012 and many
years into the future.
The Dems chose to represent this issue
because it is relevant to many students at
Swarthmore. Currently, about 10 percent
of Swarthmore students receive Pell
Grants.
"We wanted something we could represent as students," College Dems secretary Paul Shortell 'l3 said. "[Pell Grants]
are something that is important to our

In addition to preparing this sheet, the
Dems are conducting mock interviews to

simulate their discussions with the congressmen during their time at the

Capitol.
Although the trip is mainly headed by
the College Democrats, it is also supported by various student groups on campus,
such as the Swarthmore Feminists and
the Swarthmore Labor Action Project
(SLAP).

much of the campus as possible," Shortell
said. "If Pell Grants are cut it will be bad

Democrats Julio Alicea 'l3 proposed the
idea at a recent meeting in April. "Given
our statuses as students from a broad
range of socioeconomic backgrounds, I
felt that we would be able to craft a genuine narrative articulating not just why
Pell Grants were essential in order to
maintain a certain quality of education
on campuses across the country," Alicea
said, "but also how imperative it was that
Congress not cut Pell grants at a time
when the United States was falling
behind in international achievement
rankings regarding math and science."
The Dems have already confirmed a
meeting with Democratic Senator Carl
Levin from Michigan and plan to meet
with Representative Chris Van Hollen
from Maryland's eighth district.
To prepare for the trip, the group has
been researching the statistics behind
Pell grants and has come up with a statement outlining how they believe Pell
Grants are beneficial for the United
States. They will present this paper to the
congressmen they meet. In this letter, the
College Democrats emphasize that Pell
Grants help students with the highest
need, are a smart investment that generates results for both students and the government and are important for the
nation's education system and national

Overall, the Democrats hope to represent the local view of the Pell Grant discussion. "There is a shrinking pie for
education funding," Gross said. "We are
in some ways falling behind to the rest of
the world. We don't want to fall behind in

Faculty may have to
teach fewer courses

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY PATRICK AMMERMAN
pammerml@swarthmore.edu

The course load for Swarthmore

professors may be increased in the near
future to keep up with the policies
already in place at our peer institutions. While such a shift has not been
officially proposed, it is likely that the
school will pursue something similar to
that in years to come. Strategic

we do: advising theses and research and
working intensively on people's writing
and things like that," Hungerford said.
Professors will be able to spend more
time working on innovating and
revamping courses if they teach fewer
classes. Under the current system, the
professor has more or less an increase
of a third in his or her workload during
the three-course semester. Under the 2-2

next few years,
which

would
require professors to teach

only
four
courses a year, rather than the current
five courses.
The Knowledge Committee will likely issue a formal recommendation for

strategic planning regarding professor
course loads in the fall.
Swarthmore professors shifted to a
3-2 course load system in the 1980s,
which meant that a professor would
teach three courses one semester, and
two the other, for a total of five courses
over one academic year. However, professors at similar liberal arts colleges,
such as Williams College, Pomona
College, Bowdoin and Wellesley, currently teach only two courses per
semester.
"It looked like it was going to happen
before the economy tanked in 2008
It's looked like it's going to happen for
years," said Professor Peter Schmidt,
department head of English Literature,
about a change in course load.
Many see no other alternative than
to change course loads for professors in
order to make the school attractive for
young professors.
"I think it's inevitable that we're
going to [change to a 4 course load]

sor of economics, said.
Such a disparity may make professorship at Swarthmore with its current
3-2 system less desirable than at one of
these other institutions. "I interview
finalists for tenure track jobs and the
two things they are more aware of are
what the salary comparison is and what
the teaching
load is," Provost
Constance Hungerford said.

Transitioning from five courses to
four courses is also a way to recognize
the increasing workloads that professors take on outside the classroom.
"One of the reasons for [changing the
course load] is that the faculty workload
has shifted over timeand we're doing a

argue that we're assigning the fifth

arrive
under the new
system'as well.
The most worrisome issues are the potential increase
in class size and the decrease in number
of courses offered. Kuperberg draws a
comparison between reducing the
course load for professors and reducing
the number of the school's professors by

a fifth. Such a change would, of course
be drastic and nearly inconceivable. "I
would expect that some departments
would argue that they need more faculty assigned to them," Hungerford said.
One source, who wishes to remain
anonymous, worried about whatreducing the course load means for
Swarthmore academically. "We could

do other new things instead with the
same faculty and the same money, and
be able to keep classes as small as they
are right now," the source said.
The source also worries about the
effect the change would have in departments that already have faculty shortages. "There are already some departments that need more faculty that don't
have them and... even if you add 20 percent more [professors across the board],
they would be no better off," the source
said.
The change could also be hard when
professors are already limited in the
number of courses they could offer
because of other commitments, such as
chairing a department, that are the
equivalent of teaching a course.
Schmidt, for examples, raised the point
that many English professors are called
upon to chair other, interdisciplinary
departments. "If we have several people
that year being asked to lead interdisciplinary programs, that could have an
even bigger effect on the curriculum
and the courses we offer," Schmidt said.
"The benefits are clear, the problems
are sort of speculative," Schmidt added.
Hungerford was unsure how gradually the school was going to go about the
process of changing course loads. "I
could imagine discussions about how to
implement taking place next year and,
depending on how costly they are, it
may be possible to start implementing
I thinkthere's a pretty strong interest
in doing it as soon as possible," she said.
However, as Schmidt reminds us,
...

Aging sewer line to be replaced in Crum Woods
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

For the past month, construction
workers have been working in the
Crum Woods to replace an aging concrete sewer line in order to accommodate its use by three additional townships. Unfortunately, this has
required notable destruction to the
Crum landscape.
"What we worry about is
the
interior forest, kind of the center of
the woods, that is really important for
habitat," Stu Hain, Vice President for
Facilities and Services, said.
some almost 80Many trees
in a 25-foot-wide strip of
years-old
land running along Crum Creek have
already been bulldozed by a contractor hired by the Central Delaware
County Authority (CDCA), an agency
that assists in the installation and
operation of water and sewer services.
"In order to do the work that needs
to be done, the trees really have to go.
It's sad, but there really isn't a
choice," Hain said.
In 1938, the college granted a rightof-way to the CDCA for the construction of a sewer line. Since then, trees
have grown on top of the strip of land,
...

some of which have already been
removed in order to replace the line.
Hain maintains that the college is
working hard to ensure that minimal
damages will be made to the Crum's
landscape.
"We have limited say in what they
can do in their right-of-way," Hain
said, "[but] we can ask them to
restore it in a certain way. We've
asked them to provide us some
we've asked
replacement trees
them to do some stream bank restoration."
Silk fences to control erosion have
been installed on the edges of Crum
Creek in order to keep mud from
washing into the stream when it
rains. The CDCA has also given the
college the means to plant trees along
the sides of the right-of-way once construction is complete, though no trees
will be allowed to grow on top of the
line again.
The college has also requested that
the CDCA plant a blend of natural
grasses instead of turf on the restored
land and also find a way to control the
invasive species that will unavoidably explode onto the land once
restoration is complete.

Ecosystem of Cram will be in disarray after project
Continued from p. 5
When the Crum Woods Stewardship Committee, a
group that is devoted to recommending policies on
the uses of the Crum to the community, heard about
the project last month, most members were upset by
this news.
"Pretty much the whole committee went up in
arms over what was happening," Sarah Scheub 'l2, a
member of the committee, said. "Everyone was really upset [and] wanted
to know if this was the best
plan possible for dealing with the need to replace the
sewer line."
Scheub has worked with professor of biology JoseLuis Machado in an ecology course, collecting data
and doing research on trees and floodplains that
have already been demolished. Some of this research
has been going on since 2002.
"Biologically and in terms of the ecosystem,
what's happening is really horrible," she said.
However, Scheub and other members of the committee have come to terms with the inevitability of it
all, and have also been requesting money and the
means to ensure that the land will be restored prop...

erly.

"Work has obviously been started and there's
nothing that we can do," Scheub said. "At this point,
we're just trying to work with them as best as we
can."
Construction at the site is expected to be complete
sometime during the Fall 2011 semester.
"Positive things will come out of it," Scheub said,
"but will these positives outweigh the negatives, I
don't know."

stream when it rains, have been installed around Crum Creek.

Worthstock welcomes wealth of musical styles
BY HENRY KIETZMAN

hkietzml@swarthmore.edu

This Saturday at noon, the Large-Scale Events
Committee (LSE) will host Worthstock 2011, featuring
Someone StillLoves You Boris Yeltsin (SSLYBY), Koo
Koo Kanga Roo, J*DaVeY, Golden Ages, Drink Up
Buttercup and Swarthmore's The Lineup, winner of
the Battle of the Bands competition.
Led by coordinator Ashley Vogel 'l3, LSE
Committee began planning Worthstock after the
Mayer Hawthorne/St. Vincent concert in January.
The committee members contacted bands they
believed would be a good fit for the event. "We try to
get [bands] from a whole spectrum of genres," Vogel
said. Then, the committee met and voted on the
choices, picking artists with the hopes of satisfying a
variety of music styles.
A member of the LSE committee, Brennan Klein
'l3 was very active in organizing the event. "The lineup is sick
I think it's much better than last year,"
Klein said. This year he believes the bands are more
popular than previous Worthstocks.
One of the committee's biggest hopes is that
Worthstock will feature a variety of musical styles.
"We'll be changing up the type of sound that happens
throughout the day," Vogel said. The concert will
move from rock to hip-hop, pop and much more.
Working with a smaller budget this year, the committee is pleased with the popular artists that will
I think
perform. "I was actually really surprised
that we got a similar deal [to that oflast year]," Vogel
said.
Battle of the Bands winner The Lineup will kick
off the concert. Members include Trevor Rizzolo 'll
(guitar), Andrew Zimmerman 'll (drums), Josh
Lipman 'll (vocals), Kenny Flanagan 'l2 (guitar) and
Julian Leland 'l2 (bass). The group has been preparing and organizing for the past year and a half, first
...

...

performing many covers of the Beatles and The Who
before transitioning into writing their own songs.
"Our sound grew out of [our initial covers],"
Zimmerman said. On Saturday, The Lineup will play
all originals. Although each member in the band has
different musical influences, they all work collaboratively when writing their songs.
Worth Courtyard is a beau"I'm really pumped
tiful place to be," Rizzolo said. "We're going to get up
and hopefully be really really energetic
We're
going to play a lot of good music!" Both Rizzolo and
Zimmerman hope that their music will get everyone
pumped up for the rest of the day.
The other professional bands performing will
cover a large variety of musical genres, from the
hilarious techno charged beats ofKoo Koo Kanga Roo
to the catchy pop hooks of SSLYBY, finishing with the
new wave hip hop of J*DaVeY. All of the bands performing Saturday have released new albums in the
past year, most of which have been well-reviewed.
"We look for bands that maybe will get bigger in the
next couple years," Klein said.
SSLYBY, the most popular of the group as of yet, is
an indie pop band hailing from Springfield, Missouri.
Their third album, "Let It Sway" (2010), was co-produced by Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie. In
January and February, SSLYBY toured with Tokyo
...

...

Police Club and Two Door Cinema Club. Band member Jonathan James also recently recorded and
mixed several songs for the soundtrack for the
Academy Award-nominated film "Winter's Bone."
Touring with SSLYBY is Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a
comedic disco/hip-hop/pop duo self-described as
Beastie Boys meets children's TV Show Sesame
Street. The band's website reads, "The live show is
really where the music comes to life and what the
band is most passionate about."
Both Vogel and Klein expressed their excitement
about booking both acts together. "They should have

been 10 times the price we got them for They could
have been the LSE
We have several headliners in
one concert," Klein said.
Adding to the mix is Philadelphia-based Golden
Ages, a psychedelic electro-pop band. Likened to
Washed Out and Toro Y Moi, Golden Ages has
received rave reviews across the board for its remixes and recently released cover of Toto's Africa.
Last January, Neu magazine raved, "Set like a
jewel into an increasingly familiar glitz and shine of
tearaway loops and found sounds, they're a bold step
back to the time when big acoustics mattered but
[they] still keep it very 2010."
Also based in Philadelphia is psychedelic quartet
Drink Up Buttercup. Drink Up Buttercup's debut
album, "Born and Thrown On A Hook," was released
on recording label Yep Roc. NPR's "All Songs
Considered" raved, "Psychedelic without being
cheesy, this band sounds like a sinister carnival." A
twisted combination of indie pop and the golden
oldies, Drink Up Buttercup's music has wowed
numerous reviewers from the New York Times to
Pitchfork.com.
Klein believes that J*DaVeY, the hip-hop/new
wave/fusion duo from Los Angeles, will be the largest
crowd-pleaser on Saturday. They will be wrapping up
the concert on Saturday. In 2006, J*DaVeY opened for
Prince at his 3121 Club in Las Vegas. The band's
sound has been revered as a mix of Radiohead and
Erykah Badu. Their sophomore album, "New
Designer Drug" (2011), was released on the rock division of Warner Bros. Records.
The lineup will begin promptly at noon, and LSE
members encourage people to attend Worthstock not
only for the great performances but the relaxed
atmosphere. "Some bands are really chill and other
bands are kind of upbeat, and there's a very wide
array of music and events," Klein said.

Swarthmore belies a sinister takeover of your proletariat self by the bourgeois
Swarthmorean academic

system. By reducing your

immediate future to a mere

nothing but work, you haplessly effectuate the transformation and degradation
of your personhood. You

ships, sleep, personal development and personal hygiene
sometimesall at once merely for the sake of accomplishing finite amounts of homework that will invariably
remain at untenable levels all the way from first collection to graduation. The mere fact that we Swatties get
pleasure from winning at misery poker epitomizes the

absurd facade of the "well-rounded education" that we
have so ardently sought and yet so naively foregone.
Misery poker is the game that ensures our implicit
acceptance of our degraded status as academic laborers.
Yet where is the overthrow? If virtually all Swatties can

count themselves among the academically masochistic
proletariat, why hasn't the system been overthrown in a
violent revolution? I purport that Mr. Marx was wrong,
and not just about the timeframe. Ifplaying misery poker
makes us laborers of the establishment, then perhaps we
should strive to become the establishment itself.
For too long, we have been treating our individual
selves as the oppressed workforce, fully neglecting our
innate potential to serve as the entire business enterprise.
We have routinely failed to acknowledge the importance
of our roles as CEOs, HR departments, R&D and Strategic
Planning commissions. As CEOs, we can manage our time
and money effectively and ensure that our entire selfenterprise functions optimally. In our capacity as HR, we
can facilitate our interactions with our acquaintances,
friends and lovers. Through R&D we can invent new and
creative ways of maximizing productivity and happiness
each and every day. Finally, as strategic planners, we can
acknowledge our short- and long-term goals and map out
exactly how we can achieve them over time. Instead of
misery poker, let's play Perfection®. In the traditional
game of Perfection, you have oneminute to fit as many
diversely shaped game pieces as possible into their corresponding places on the game board. For us, let's assume
that we have four years to fit all of our college goals and
aspirations into their corresponding sectors of our college
lives. Misery must no longer dominate us. As your in-

now explain how to optimally run
your self-enterprise.
As CEO, you must make things happen. You are the
executive authority in your college life. This means that
when you observe that your workforce (your body) has
been working 16-hour days without even the weekends for
respite, you should naturally want to put an end to these
brutal conditions and ensure that your workforce is kept
healthy and productive. Unhappy workers lose productiv-

tractions. Secondly, you forcibly prevent yourself from

experiencing moments of "flow" because a friend could
walk up to you at any moment and distract your whole
operation. If you want a successful personal R&D department, you need to develop your entire self, not just your
academic labor force. This means routinely finding ways
to increase your happiness and well-being. For this, I recommend tethering. Make a list of your daily activities,
and try to associate a happy thought or a self-affirming action with each one. The association will keep
you in the habit of feeling good and

yourself or for others.

the most important one
for you to hone, and

we receive is a blunt, conversation-ending "Sorry, we are

departments are in charge
of how we interact with
our acquaintances,
friends and lovers,
and our collective
lack of personal HR
is only further
evinced by the
übiquity of social
awkwardness

and

the utter absence of a dating
scene on campus. My advice? Give your HR employees billable hours. Spending an hour at Paces on the weekend does not constitute a social life. If you are willing to
spend 40+ hours a week on homework, yet under four
hours a week on developing your social life, then clearly
your inner CEO should be fired, because he has no idea
how to run a successful business. Friendship, dating and
love, just like everything else in your life, take time. Do
not deny them that time, no matter how nicely you think
your problem set could fit into your free 6-hour block on

Friday evening.

Swatties are immensely creative individuals, but I nevertheless find myself questioning the direction of their
R&D efforts time and time again. For example, many
Swatties engage in seemingly brilliant "Sharpies
Saturdays" in which they wake up early on Saturday,
pack up all of their work and spend the whole day in
Sharpies, thereby saving two extra meals and gaining an
entire day's worth of productivity. Of course, the downsides to this are as insidious as the upsides were insightful. For one, you squander an entire day of your weekend,
cooped up without direct sunlight in a cafeteria full of dis-

its

failure

could

well be the source
of the majority of
your post-graduation
regrets. It's this commission that tells you
to start job hunting and
alumni networking during your junior year or

...

earlier, a feat that can only

prevail
if you actively
choose to play Perfection® and
not misery poker. This commission plans out how to
approach that cutie at the reference desk whom you'll inevitably

adore for all four years here. And as

evidence of the collective failure of Swatties' strategic planning, we have Green Bottle, an event mere days
before graduation during which seniors frantically come
together and awkwardly try to hook up with individuals
that they never had the bravery/forethought to approach
before. My advice: take at least one day at the beginning
and end of each semester to sit out on the Big Chair with
a close friend and discuss all of your aspirations, career
plans, personal proclivities and, of course, love interests.
Plan out all the things you want to accomplish in your
time that remains and create your own Swat Bucket List.
Compare it with your friends' lists to make sure you didn't forget anything important.
We currently exist as the unsuspecting victims of a culture of academic masochism. Swatties love to complain
and misery poker perfectly exemplifies our perpetual race
to the bottom, to the dregs of workload-induced despair
with the odds never in our favor. However, if we choose to
stop gambling with our selfhoods and instead play a game
of Perfection®, of total self-realization, we can leave
Swarthmore not as victims of the institution, but as fully
functioning enterprises of our own.

Film considers abortion from pro-choice perspective
&

BY STEVEN HAZEL
shazell@swarthmore.edu

This year, Congress has zoned in on the govern-

ment funding of Planned Parenthood, a sexual and
reproductive health care provider, as the latest battleground in the conflict between pro-choice and prolife views on abortion. With a presidential election
approaching, abortion policy is becoming an even
more heated issue, along with the economy, foreign
policy and the budget deficit. The Swarthmore

Feminists have chosen to illuminate this issue for
the Swarthmore community with their screening of
the documentary "The Coat Hanger Project" today at
7 p.m.
This film is an in-depth look at the issues of abortion from both a historical and social perspective,
and will be followed by a talk and discussion of the
film by Angie Young, the filmmaker. "We chose this
film because it was shown at the National Young
Feminist Leadership Conference that we attended in
March, but most of us who wanted to go missed the
screening. [But] it seemed like an important film,
especially now when there are many bills that have
been introduced in Congress that are hurting
women's health," Lisa Sendrow 'l3, president of the
Swarthmore Feminists, said.
Young is a business manager for "Feminist
Studies," a journal hosted by the University of
Maryland that publishes articles relating to
women's issues thrice-yearly. "After I graduated
from college, I moved to Washington D.C. and
worked as a hotline operator for the National
Abortion Federation's toll-free hotline," Young said.
"Through that experience, I got to connect with
many women and men faced with the task of needing
to obtain an abortion for themselves or their partners, and the difficulties they had to overcome." In
2006 in South Dakota, when the legislature of that
state banned all abortions without exceptions, she
became more directly involved with the pro-choice
movement. Young became part of an effort that successfully repealed the ban on abortions. In the
process, she videotaped aspects of the anti-abortion
movement, which later encouraged her to create a
documentary of abortion from a pro-choice perspective.
"The Coat Hanger Project," produced in 2008, has
been shown across the country and the globe, as
Young has toured Europe, Canada and the United
States. Although the film displays a pro-choice slant
as it highlights the terrors and often-mortal consequences of illegal abortion and the need for women
to control their own bodies
it has been reviewed
favorably by a variety of journals, including Buzz
Magazine and the Yale Herald, and was also an official selection of the Rosebud Film Festival in 2009.
"It's so important to see the way that abortion rights
intersect with other basic human rights: environmental rights, civil rights, women's rights, LGBT
rights, economic justice, the right to control one's
destiny, the right to one's own bodily integrity. If we
can see the ways we are connected, we can be
stronger and have a better chance of defending a
right we have all been taking for granted for the last
38 years," Young said.
a
The film gets its title from the coat hanger
symbol of the desperate, back-alley abortions that
women were forced to perform before the 1973
Supreme Court Decision Roe v. Wade, affirming
which represents the
women's right to abortion
fact that between 60,000 and 80,000 women still die
each year from unsafe abortions. In particular, the
film emphasizes the disparity between the generation born before Roe v. Wade and after the landmark
decision, and explains that those born after 1973
have no experience of the horror of having to chose
a dangerous, illegal abortion, and therefore may not
take the necessity of abortion rights as seriously as
those of the pre-1973 generation. "I hope the audience can take away the simple maxim that abortion
is a personal decision and it should not be a decision
made by our politicians who are generally older,
white men," Sendrow said. "I want people to believe
that women will make the right choice for themselves, whatever it is."

swarthmorephoenix.com

The Project combines interviews with important
feminists, stories from women about their personal
struggles with abortion and reproductive rights and
statistics about abortion that add depth to the anecdotal evidence presented. Some of the women Young
interviews include Loretta Ross, the Co-founder of
SisterSong and the Women of Color Reproductive
Health Alliance and Dr. Bonnie Morris, Professor of
Women's Studies at George Washington University.
To add an intimacy to the film, Young incorporated
the story of an Iraq War veteran who performed a
self-induced abortion. "I connected to other feminist
women working on the issue of choice, found counter-protesters [through MySpace], even found the
woman from the military that I interviewed. The
power of social networking and our new media revolution is not to be underestimated and was essential
to the making of this documentary," Young said.
Regardless of one's perspective on abortion, the
film serve as a valuable source of personal commentary and statistical information about one of the central political issues of American government today.

right now with cases of extreme nostalgia. I personally am so laden with nostalgia I can't really

that my editors will promptly and rightfully hurl
me into the Crum. If this were to happen, you
would in fact be reading my last column, which
would be occasion for a great deal of panic, sentimentality and nostalgia. To be prepared for this
possibility we must reminisce and become so nostalgic we have to be carried on stretchers to Worth
where we can reminisce more and then, maybe,
get some sleep.
Sleep is one thing we've talked about a lot this
year. According to these columns as well as the
universe's store of objective truth (concepts which
may be used interchangeably for our purposes and
any other purposes you can think of), we at
Swarthmore do not ever sleep. According to the

"Lysistrata," while outdated, still
relates to contemporary times. "It is
quite humorous to discover all these
unresolved issues between the sexes
have been applicable since the time of
Aristophanes," she said.
In traditional classical Greek form,
"Lysistrata" features dialogue in addition to choral passages, a feature
which, considering her work with
voice and singing since a young age,
excited Amesse. The cast employed the
Roy Hart Voice method
which
Amesse described as a "sort of modern
dance for the voice"
in "Lysistrata"
to express in sound things the text does
not. Amesse explained that where the
text falls flat, soundscapes fill the space.
"We are making sounds that are not
traditionally 'pretty' or 'pleasant' and
trying to access things beyond what the
story provides," she wrote in an e-mail.
The cast improved their knowledge of
this method through a series of voice
workshops with Adrianne Mackey 'O4,
a director in Philadelphia. The workshops emphasized learning how to
improvise music and song. "All the
things you're going to see is planned, so

said.

In reflection, Amesse feels that her
Swarthmore experience greatly influenced her production, and cited her
directing style as a product of her work
in last semester's Senior Company. This
year, when the Company performed

April 28, 2011

Mary Zimmerman's "Metamorphoses,"
the senior cast included a large number
of actors, very few of whom wanted primarily to direct. Therefore, all of the
actors were directors at the same time,
and collectively built a vision of the
play. "Walking away from the production, everyone felt such a deep ownership over the piece. This was something
we made together," Amesse said. It was

with this idea in mind that Amesse
wanted to ensure she was not a director
who imposed her vision on the production, but rather made the active decision to make "Lysistrata" an actor-driven piece.
"The actors are responsible for
more than just providing characters
and emotion
we create the set, the
soundscape, and set the mood with our
bodies and our voices. It's totally awesome," Masucci said.
Amesse hopes that audience members walk away from the performance
acknowledging "the power of the voice

singing and appealing to people

One person has the
power to make a difference." Lipschutz
equally urged the Swarthmore community to prepare themselves for chorus songs, outlandish costumes and
props, a tango and a sex deprivation
scene.
Most importantly, however, Amesse
hopes to attract a diverse group of students. "I think it's a perfect show for
someone who doesn't identify as a theater-goer because I think it's very
accessible and very fun."

herself since she wanted a change from her usual preference for longer tops. She designed this top with a layered
effect. "I recently learned a fabric cut in circular shape
flows better and falls naturally," she said.
Making her own garments:
Looking back, Kim remembers her aunts making
quilts and shirts throughout her childhood, and believes
garment-making runs in the family. "Growing up I was
surrounded by people who had sewing machines. But I
started to sew during my sophomore year when I took
costume design here [which is] taught by the theatre
department," Kim said. Since then, Kim has completed
two internships during her sophomore and junior years,
at Adidas. She has also worked as a seamstress for the
Opera Company of Philadelphia's production of "Romeo
and Juliet." As Kim's commitments take place mainly
outside campus, according to her, "I rarely stay in
Swarthmore
I'm always in Philly."
In fact, Kim has her own Singer sewing machine in
her dorm room. The Singer comes in handy for Kim
when she designs and sews blazers, which are her signature wardrobe staple. "I make all of my blazers," she said.
She currently owns four, which she wears in rotation.
However, her practice in garment-making is still new.
"I've never learned formally how to make [garments],"
she said. "Whenever I see in a store something I can
make, I never buy it. I look at how it's made." She then
tries to recreate the garment herself, starting by making

Growing up, Kim admits that she

was a tomboy and an unlikely candidate for fashion design because she
was surrounded by males. "I always
had an interest in fashion, it just came
really late," she said. When Kim
watched a televised fashion show of
Haider Ackermann, an avant-garde
inspired womenswear designer, her
interest in fashion was piqued. "I was
fascinated by his stuff. That was the
starting point that pushed me into [fashion design]," Kim said.
Her fashion inspirations:
From day to day, Kim is mostly influenced by the weather in selecting her
ensembles. "I look outside the window and
just decide what to wear," she said.
But in terms of inspiration for creating
garments, she studies and appreciates
Haider Ackermann's work, and ignores the
rest of the fashion industry. "I'm not into

said. In particular, Kim is drawn to Ackermann since
the designer incorporates architectural elements and

to an old

physicist that I was studying abroad in
Hungary, he told me, "There used to be a
funny story circulating among scientists
and mathematicians that Hungarians
come from Mars, in part because their
language is so peculiar (to Europeans)
and partly because the country produced
so many brilliant scholars." Indeed,
there are many famous Hungarian mathematicians. To name a few: Paul Erdos,
an incredibly prolific mathematician
comparable only to Leonhard Euler;
John von Neumann, who made major
contributions in a vast range of fields
and is considered the father of the modern computer; and, Laszlo Lovasz, one of
the best living mathematicians today

THE PHOENIX

and who has won numerous prizes,
including the Wolf, the Knuth and the

Kyoto prize.
I am a math major and wanted to go to
Hungary, but since this Hungarian excellence of mathematics was unknown to
my parents, I had to ask Professor
Maurer, chair of Swarthmore math
department, to write me a letter so that
my parents would be convinced that I
didn't go crazy. As I recall from the letter,

he offered three reasons for their excellence. First, there is a general respect for
the study of mathematics in the country.
Also, there are a number of excellent
mathematics competitions for secondary
students, going back over 100 years. And
lastly, there is a tradition of good teaching and research.
Spending almost four months in this
country, I have confirmed these three
reasons and they all seem to be related to
each other. There is a great respect for
mathematics because it seems that the
secondary level mathematics education
in Hungary is of very high quality. Most
people who graduated high school, the
general population, either see the beauty
of math or come to believe that math is
something very hard, and passively
respect it. It seems to be the good teaching, in fact, is possible because
Hungarians tolerate the fact that there
will be people who are left out.
The reason that I related the three
explanations to each other is the follow-

ing. I was at a Japanese cultural center
talking in Japanese with Japanese beginners, and as it often happens, we talk
about what subject you like and what
you don't. There were five of them, and
they all said theirleast favorite subject is
math because it's too hard. At another
time I was having tea with an art history
major, and when I commented that I
heard Hungary has a very good math
education, she didn't quite agree and
explained to me that in her high school,
only about 10 out of 40 students in her

class understood the lectures in math,
while she and the rest of the class were
often left out. However it is not that they
don't like math. It is just that they do not
want to do math themselves. I remember
one of them, an English literature major,
telling me that, even so, she respects
math. She wouldn't have got that feeling
if her math classes hadn't taught her
good math. Hungary further offers the
math competitions to young motivated
students so that they refine their mathematical sense and enjoy math, which I
think is a good thing.
There is perhaps a shortcoming in
Hungarian math education in some
sense, but as I think of my math experience so far, it has been excellent. It is definitely not easy, but the material is really interesting and challenging and I have
had the most fun out of math ever. The
professors assign us only a few problems
but they are very well chosen. Moreover,

April 28, 2011

I have good amount of time to work on
them without having to think about my
philosophy and history papers. Some
problems are really hard, but the professors give us hints in a way that makes
them doable, and after having done them
I am left with satisfaction. It's absolutely
great.
These shortcomings can also be interpreted positively. There is a technical
university that I heard that sends new
students a welcome package that says,
"50 % of you will not be engineers, for
sure," and in fact one of my friends who
goes there had a class of 400 at first,
which dropped to 250 by the time he was
a junior.
This university is one of the most
prestigious universities in Hungary, but
still the dropout rate is extraordinary.
However, dropping out could prevent
you from pursuing a life that you may
end up not liking.
I met a dropout from the technical
university who was now, surprisingly,
attending a Buddhist university studying Buddhism and Japanese,and it looks
like it suits him better that way. It's hard
to say what is good and what is bad,
because it all depends. I definitely benefited from American liberal arts education, but this semester has taught me
how other systems could work, as well as

how much fun math could be.

Four course plan betrays key student interests
Many students are concerned that

increase, class sizes also rose. Midlevel class sizes grew and many students faced lotteries in required courses for their majors.
Apart from rising class sizes, the
distribution of tenure-track faculty

Jon's reflections on the Swarthmore experience

As I sat in my room,
staring at my four fat

seminar binders and six
separate stacks of books,
pondering what to write

that in my final column I
might stray from the
usual political tract to

person."

It didn't make as much sense as it does now, but I
appreciated the blunt gesture of affirmation. It was
the kind of thing I needed to tell myself more often.
In the better part of a day I fell in love with
Swarthmore and made the decision to come here for
four years.
Countless papers, more books, six elections, too
much Paces, lots of friends, one boyfriend, three
trips abroad, four honors seminars, one Crunkfest
and zero discussions of Nietzsche over Cheerios
later and it's almost time for me to graduate.
My first three years were a roller coaster, lots of
highs and lows and no discernible pattern. What I
can say unequivocally is that my senior year has
been better.
That's true for a lot of different reasons, but most
importantly it's because I made a conscious decision
to change the way I did Swat. In my first two and a
half years I did what felt most natural, most com-

If I had to pick the single most redeeming quality
about Swarthmore it would not be its academic
rigor or endearing quirkiness, but rather its openness: its capacity to let people experiment with who
they are.
Yes, we have our insular cliques and yes, there
are some of us who whisper or even write columns
about those terrible "swawkward" losers among us,
but they are in the minority.
I think most of us recognize that being socially
awkward, just like being shy in class, is the product
of a learned lack of confidence, just in a different
context. At its best, Swarthmore is a place to
unlearn that kind of crippling self-consciousness
wherever it afflicts us.

Unfortunately, while the absolute
number of minority faculty members
went up 8.5 percent between 1999 and
2009, as a percentage of total faculty,
minority faculty declined from 20.5
percent to 17.3 percent, according to
the Equal Opportunity Office (EOO).
This is an unacceptable trend judging by the College's own mission of
"mak[ing] its students more valuable
human beings and more useful members of society." Students cannot reach
their "full intellectual and personal
potential" (also from the mission statement) without an understanding of the
diversifying and globalizing world
around them. Thus, there are two simple, concrete steps that we propose to
the College administration at this
point in time:
First, consultation of the EOO must
be institutionalized in the hiring
process. This is an easy and logical
first step towards increasing faculty
diversity. Currently, its involvement
is not mandatory. Though the College
obviously cannot make hires based on,
for example, race, the EOO's input
needs to be heard if the College is serious about faculty diversity.
Second, structural changes are
needed to improve understanding and
communication between the faculty,
administration and students. Though
we are grateful for the open doors that
professors and department offices
have always offered us, simply walking through these doors on a studentby-student basis does not provide a
measurable system to gauge student

April 28, 2011

interest in curriculum offerings. Even
the involvement of students in visiting
professor hires becomes distorted if
students are not able to make it to lectures and meet-and-greets.
Thus, we suggest institutionalizing
forums where students can express
their interests and faculty members
can respond. Candidate professors' lectures could be posted online. Basically,
formal avenues must be provided to
students to solve our collective action
problems. Furthermore, departments
would be held accountable if dialogue
becomes formalized and transparent.
We are not asking for more diversity for diversity's sake. Our mission is
to create the most enlightening and
supportive environment for the students on this campus. Faculty of color
are simply one aspect of this mission;
we also desire faculty who have a
demonstrated interest to being active
members of this College community
and engaging thoughtfully with students and administration alike. By the
raw numbers our faculty diversity
falls short of the 18 percent minority
figure at other leading coed liberal
arts colleges such as Williams and
Amherst. But increasing faculty diversity also requires a culture of accountability and transparency.
The ethos of social concern and
community building sets Swarthmore
College apart from comparable institutions. It is time for the administration
to affirm that commitment.

Resolve pets on campus matter with open discussion
BY MELANIE YOUNG

myoungl@swarthmore.edu

The topic of pets on campus is a
complex one. I've heard from students
about how a few moments petting one
of the campus dogs has relieved the
stress they were feeling and reminded
them of the comforts of
■■■■■ home. I've heard from
staff that have been
J
■■■■■l bitten by a dog in the
past and when turning
a corner to find a dog off their leash
growling at them has caused their
blood pressure to skyrocket and their
nightmares to return.
I've heard from faculty who maintain that their ability to bring their

pet to work is a cherished part of their
experience at the College. I've heard
from people who have had to maneuver around excrement left in the hallways of our buildings.
And I've heard from community
members of all types that it can be

16

uncomfortable to raise issues about
pets on campus because they worry
that their views are those of the
"minority" on a campus that mostly
self-identifies as a haven for animals
and animal lovers.
It's clear that when it comes to a pet
"policy," people feel strongly no matter what their life's experiences have
been. It's also clear that we can
empathize with those with fears or
allergies, just as we can embrace those
who count on our animal friends to
comfort and nurture their experience.
Dogs on campus provide benefits and
dogs on campus create liabilities
both of these truths co-exist.
So how does one go about bridging
what seems to be a daunting divide
between perspectives and emotions?
Our current policy, which does not
permit animals in public spaces or to
be off the leash when walking through
campus, provides a good starting point
and attempts to balance the needs of
all. And yet, issues arise for which the

current policy provides insufficient

solutions.
For example, some community
members are uncomfortable with asking pet owners to remove their pets or
put them on a leash, because occasionally their request is met with disdain
or because they are not confident that
they have the right to make such a
request. And there are property damage issues and liability issues as well
by pets who are not well supervised by
their owners.
On the other hand, other community members are concerned about
restricting the presence of pets further
than we already have, some because
they enjoy having pets around and
some because they worry our workplace is becoming overly regulated.
While these differences may appear
irreconcilable, we owe it to ourselves
to try to work together in common
cause, respecting both individual
opinions and rights, and our collective
commitment to one another.

April 28, 2011

The meeting scheduled for May 3rd
at 12:30 in Scheuer gives us an opportunity to engage in constructive problem solving and create a space where
consensus surrounding a way forward
that serves all of the members of the
Swarthmore community can emerge.
We cannot ignore the issues that exist;
we have to do our best to understand
them and find solutions.
I believe all of these issues are
resolvable, as long as we listen to one
another with respect and concern and
stay focused on the well being of our
community as a whole.
It's not simply a matter of whether
people enjoy the pets on campus, but
rather a question of how we respond to
the issues that their presence creates.
To do that, we need to move beyond
dichotomous thinking and use this
moment to creatively strengthen our
community. I'm confident that we can
do so.

ofHuman Resources.

Friends,

Policy
As
Financial
StuCo
Representative this year, I have
gained substantial understanding of
the workings of the College and the
making
administrative
decision
process. But most of all, I have learned
how much work there is left to be done
to ensure a vigorous student presence
in the management of the College.
Even after years of students voicing
concerns over insufficient student
power and oversight, major decisions
are often made without student conour only real role in
sent or input
the process is to validate decisions
after they are made.
This was especially apparent to me
in my work on the College Budget
Committee. This committee is ostensibly tasked with reviewing and providing input and recommendations for
the budgeting process, but in practice
its function is merely to receive a cursory glance at budgets that have
already been created.
Much of the problem here is the
way that decision-making processes
are institutionalized. Something I discovered as I worked on the Rollover
Initiative this year is that students
have extraordinary leeway over the
management of our own funds and
institutional structure. That is, we
have immense freedom to spend the
Student Activities Account as we like
and design the student-led committee
structure as we see fit.
It took me longer to realize, however, that this freedom granted to students is partly a way of separating
almost entirely student institutions
from administrative ones. We have
total control over our budget; in
exchange, we have no control over the
College's.

As Student Council President, I will

act to redefine and reinvigorate the
committee structure by pushing

administrative committees like the
College Budget Committee, Committee
for Investor Responsibility and
Student Advisory Committee to the
Dean of Admissions to meet more frequently and allow for a greater student role in setting the agenda of the
committees.
In addition, I will pursue the formation of a Financial Practices Advisory
Committee to review and publicize
financial decisions made by the
College and to respond to student concerns about these decisions. This
would be an extension both of the
Employment
Advisory
Practices

THE PHOENIX

Committee recommended by the
Living Wage Committee in 2004 and of
the recommendations of the currently
active Committee for Purchaser
Responsibility. The committee structure could be a great space for student
involvement and increased transparency in the creation of College policies and budgets, but it needs serious
reworking.

Furthermore, students must be
more involved in the Strategic
Planning process. Implementation of
the strategic plan begins next spring,
so students have little time left to significantly influence the near future of
our school.
The Strategic Planning process has
been distressingly opaque to most if
not all students; apart from the handful of student representatives selected
by administrators to sit on the various
working groups, almost all the conversation and information generated
through the process has been kept
from the student body.
The Strategic Planning blog is a
frustratingly inadequate way of supporting student participation. As
President, I will press those involved
in Strategic Planning to open up the
process by critically evaluating what
information needs to be confidential
and what can be disseminated to the
student body. With more specific
details about the decisions being
made, students will be able to give precise feedback on the process.
In addition, I will push for more
communication between the working
groups and the student body so that
students can see the direct results of
their contributions.
This is an ambitious agenda, and
it's worth asking whether these
reforms are achievable, especially
given the inability of Student Council
to significantly impact the functioning
of the College in the past. I believe that
much of what has hampered StuCo up
until now is that its members generally see the council purely as a mediator
and liaison between students and
administrators. StuCo members feel
that they have to advocate to students
on behalf of the administration as
much as they advocate to the administration on behalf of students.
What we forget in doing so is that
we are simply students ourselves, and
that positions on Student Council are
only titles that allow access to broader
communication mechanisms and give
StuCo members face time with administrators.
The responsibility of Student
Council is to the student body and student concerns, and it does its con-

stituents a disservice by striving at all
times to maintain positive, concordant
relationships with administrators
relationships often built by moderating and diffusing student concerns.
Student Council should be willing
to engage in broad campus organization and action around initiatives of
importance to the student body. We
come to the negotiating table in a
much stronger position if we are comfortable backing up our requests with
organized
cohesive,
a
student
response.
This doesn't mean that we should
burn bridges, but it is possible for us
to have a working relationship with
the administration while maintaining
the understanding that we are willing
to exert uncomfortable pressure on
the College if our concerns are dismissed or trivialized. That StuCo has
not been able to function in that way
this year is something I regret about
my tenure as Financial Policy Rep.
Moving forward, I will continue to
work with administrators to make the
changes seen as necessary by the student body. I understand the importance of cooperation and compromise,
even if I believe we must sometimes
eschew the bureaucratic methods of
achieving our goals.
To that end, I have been heavily
involved this year in the creation of
two pieces of long-term policy: the
Rollover
Initiative
and
the
Responsible Purchasing Guidelines.
The Rollover Initiative, spearheaded
primarily by
me and current
President Simon Zhu, is designed to
make funding through SBC easier to
get, less arcane and more efficient,
-

and to open up a self-renewing $lOO,OOO
fund to be allocated by a student committee for the development of student
projects.
Responsible
Purchasing
The
Guidelines, written by the Committee
for Purchaser Responsibility on which
I've served since its foundation last
spring, reiterate Swarthmore's commitment to spending its money in a
socially responsible manner through
the establishment of new College policy defining acceptable and unacceptable purchases.
Each of these pieces of policy was
created in coordination and conjunction with Swarthmore's staff and
administration, and helped to build
the strong working relationship I
enjoy with many of the College's
administrators.
In short, I believe that Student
Council has extraordinary potential to
be an aggressive force pursuing student initiatives. But we have a tendency to hamstring ourselves by assuming that our only role is to mediate discussions. At times, StuCo has to be
just another student group advocating
student concerns
concerns which
can be at odds with the interests of the
administration.
Frankly, that kind of conflict is a
healthy part of the development of an
institution
like
Swarthmore.
Administrators will push one way;
students, often, another. When our
interests align with the administracooperation
tion,
works
well.
However, Student Council renders
itself pretty ineffective and incapable
of successful negotiation when it forgets whose side it's really on.

For campus life representative:
Matt Lamb 'l2
For three years I have been fortunate enough to be a part of this incredible student body. As I reflect on my
time at Swat, I have come to the conclusion that it's time for me to give
back to the Swarthmore community,
specifically the great student body. As
a member of the Swarthmore community, I've been incredibly lucky to be a
part of the baseball team, DARTeam,
Delta Upsilon fraternity, SAC and an
RA. My experience with different campus organizations has given me a deep
understanding of what students love
about Swarthmore and what they want

to change.

Essentially, my job as your Campus
Life Representative would be to act as
the liaison between the student body
and the administration. As your

April 28, 2011

Campus Life Representative, I would
actively seek out student body sugges-

tions and complaints and ensure that

they are heard by the administration.
The Student Council can improve communications with the student body by
creating surveys with questions better

suited to get at the needs and desires of
students. The student body deserves
an active voice working to make your
experience here as enjoyable as possible. Once we identify your concerns on
campus, we can work with the administration to instill positive change on
this campus that would create a more
enjoyable experience for us and for
future generations of Swatties.
So let's work together and better
this already great campus. I'd appreciate your vote for Campus Life
Representative. Thanks!

Hi Swatties!

Life Representatives.
my
hometown,
After
Istanbul, Turkey, I feel like
Swarthmore is my second
home. I would love to serve
this unique community to
ensure its welfare by acting as
an intermediary link between
the students and the administration. To achieve that I am hoping to interact with
more of you in a personal level to hear what you have
to say about the current events and your opinions
about the different operations of the College.
We have a very well-bonded community that is a
rich mosaic of different backgrounds and stories. I
would like to sustain this strong bond by keeping the
conversation channels open and urge a fruitful environment for every positive idea and opinion to flourish. In my opinion, mutual understanding and empa-

thy are the keys elements for that. As the Campus Life
Representative, I would do my best to keep the positive and friendly atmosphere active by presenting the
different opinions and reactions to the Council.
We have good conditions at our dorms, but I think
we can make them better by some improvements. One
could be adding useful appliances to the lounges. A
microwave and a fridge are two examples that every

resident could benefit from. Also the school pays a
substantial amount of money for cable, but only a few
locations around the campus have access to cable TV.
Every lounge should have access to cable TV that is
already being paid for. Another improvement that I
want to suggest is the "wellness centers" in every
dorm that would have some fitness equipment and
mats. This is a harder task to achieve but I would
work hard to bring these opinions and many more
from the student body to the StuCo and try to make
these suggestions come true.
As the Campus Life Representative, another one of
my responsibilities would be to pursue the improvement of dining services through the inputs from the
student body. Rollover meal points have been a topic
ofinterest on the StuCo for a while now, but no resolv-

ing conclusion has been reached. I would urge a solution to this important matter on the StuCo and hopefully get the rollover meal points system going in near
future. In addition to that, implementing new and delicious specialty bars to the Sharpies menu and introducing healthy food choices to Essie Mae's would be
my other priorities.
While trying to make this campus a better place
than it already is, I also would like to encourage the
efforts to make Swarthmore a green campus.
Although composting is achieved at a reasonable
level, it could be further enhanced and combined with
other conservation efforts such as energy-efficient
light bulbs or implementing lights with movement
sensors that only turn on when there is someone in
the room.
Swarthmore is a beautiful place and I really want
to take part in efforts to make it better than it already
is. I am always open to hear what you have to say and
really appreciate your input. I would love to be the
bridge between you and the StuCo.
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!

For educational policy representative:
Panchompoo (Fai) Wisittanawat 'l3
Hi everyone!
My name is Panchompoo Wisittanawat. (I go by Fai.) I would like to be your
next Educational Policy Representative.
I am running for the position because I am deeply
interested in education and educational policy. My
academic experience at Swarthmore has been a formative and challenging one. I am truly appreciative of
the rich academic resources that the college provides,

but I believe that there is more work to be done to
make sure that all students succeed in what they aim
for at Swarthmore. As the Educational Policy
Representative, I will work closely with students and
the administration to make the existing resources
accessible and look for areas where the college can
still do better.
I am a physics major in the Class of 2013, with chemistry and education
minors. In the past two years, I have been involved in many activities related
to the college's educational policies and beyond. I served as a student representative on the Curriculum Committee. I have been investing a lot of time
and energy to provide student inputs in the Strategic Planning process, especially on issues regarding academic support and students' educational experiences. In addition to educational policy-related work, I served as a co-president of 1-20 (The International Club), which gave me the opportunity to be
engaged with the campus community through various events that 1-20 organized.
As the Educational Policy Representative, in addition to attending the
Curriculum Committee and the Council on Educational Policy regularly, I will
continue and initiate conversations around the following student concerns
and push for changes that students want to see.
Department-Specific Academic Support: In the past two years, academic
support has been a widely discussed topic among students and faculty. While
the sciences have been praised for their support systems, namely SAs and
tutors, it is time we reevaluated the existing programs as the introductory science classes have become significantly larger. In addition, we should look for
a possibility to expand the support systems to departments in other disciplines.
Writing Courses and Writing Requirement: At present, there are many continuing student concerns regarding writing courses and the writing requirement. To be specific, some students are concerned with the inconsistency in
terms of expectation and quality of writing courses, and the lack of upper-level
writing courses. Sometimes students find that their writing improves more in
a non-writing course. I believe there should be a reassessment of the rubric for
writing courses, and possibly a student end-of-the-term, writing-specific evaluation for every writing course.
Course Diversity: For a college of our size, Swarthmore already offers a
wide variety of classes, but as the world is changing rapidly and there is
always something new to learn, it is not easy to keep up. However, visiting
professors can be great resources for emerging fields of study or ones that are
in high demands among students, and we should have more say in who the college recruits to be visiting professors and which field of study they represent.

These are a few concerns that I have heard discussed among students in the
past years. However, when I am the Educational Policy Representative, I will
make a serious effort to listen to students' opinions, foster conversations and
communicate students' ideas to the administration.
I am committed to and excited for this position. I will make it a top priority. With your help, we can create a formative and supportive academic atmosphere.

Thank you and good luck with the rest of the semester!

Hello! My name is Lisa Bao and I am interested in becoming your Educational Policy
Representative for 2011-12. I'm a prospective linguistics major in the Class of 2014, and I
work at the McCabe reference desk
come ask me a question about library research or
printer malfunctions!
Since arriving at Swarthmore, I've been increasingly fascinated
by the administrative decisions that shape our academic experiences. I had the opportunity to read the College's 2009 re-accreditation self-study*, which was surprisingly transparent, spurring me to
participate in College governance. In the process, I discovered a new
affinity for the intricate balance of priorities between Swarthmore's
expansive curriculum and the diverse individual community members that make it happen.
As a student representative on Working Group 2 (WG2):
"Knowledge, Teaching, and Learning," of Strategic Planning, I've

and informal ways. The committee is charged to design an academic
program addressing knowledge in the 21st century, preparing citizens to contribute to a
global society and teaching students who span a range of diverse experiences and identities.
Many times I have met with students individually to discuss specific concerns, and
either directed them to the appropriate working group or addressed the issue during my
own weekly committee meeting. I've represented the student body in this capacity by:
Participating on the panel of WG2's two Fireside Chats, Q&A-style meetings open to

questions, and continued the conversation with interested students in my dorm.
Meeting with the IC/BCC communities as an informal liaison with regard to course

Contributing research on peer institutions to WG2, such as different structural models to support interdisciplinary programs, honors and independent research. In the
Pedagogy subgroup, I was responsible for writing the interdisciplinarity section of our
report to the whole committee.
Forming a new subgroup of WG2, on "mapping the curriculum," at the behest of Will
Treece 'll and myself, both of us student representatives on the committee. The subgroup
will discuss long-term needs in scaffolding of curricular knowledge and integrate existing
improvements already underway on a "Course Catalog 2.0" by the Registrar's office.
However, I also wish to serve immediate student needs through concrete measures that
will not conflict with the Strategic Planning process. My specific goals as Educational
Policy Representative include:
Presenting existing information in an organized format to students, such as a list of
courses offered without prerequisite in the natural sciences division, or courses with content relating to Ethnic Studies.
Centralizing faculty course syllabi. This idea had been discussed and tabled a few
years ago, due to concerns about copyright, but I remain hopeful that a mutually beneficial
compromise can be reached between students and faculty.
Restructuring the Tri-Co Summer Institute for Diversity, which has been disbanded
(without student input) into a Swarthmore-only program for Fall 201 L I attended Tri-Co
myself last summer and found it an empowering space for all interested first-year students,
regardless of their college or cultural identity, to come together in educational dialogue.
Through Strategic Planning, I have gained invaluable experience with the inner workings of Swarthmore-specific educational policies. I am ready co take one step down from
visionary planning to the long-term but concrete decisions made through consensus by the
Council on Educational Policy and the Curriculum Committee two important College
administrative committees which include the Educational Policy Representative
as well
as, of course, to full participation in the resolutions and goals ofStudent Council as an
independent body.

Thank you for your time in reading this (lengthy) platform! I am always open to new
ideas and feedback on current, emerging, or continuing initiatives. Please contact me with

to dismiss the man who
holds it, and there's no good reason why. In nearly every
case, the people doing the dismissing would have zeropoint-zero percent idea how one even becomes a parking
lot owner, how much work it might take, or what kind of
net worth could come from owning parking lots. They just
know how it sounds off the tongue, and unfortunately for
the man in question, there is something unmistakably second-rate in the sound of "parking lot owner," something
that has no place anywhere near the ownership of the Los
Angeles Dodgers. Own enough buildings, and you become
a titan of industry; your right to purchase a piece of baseball royalty is beyond question. Own enough parking lots,
and five percent of the Padres seems like more your speed.
All this might make it that much easier to see why,
when McCourt got unanimously approved by Bud Selig
and the owners in 2004, people wrote it off as baseball's
quick fix to keep FOX, who owned the Dodgers and were
desperate to unload them, in the mood to negotiate a fanTV deal going forward. It could also explain a little better

McCourt took over, they were ranked fourth and valued at
half of what they are today, a pattern of growth few teams
can claim to have emulated. For his sins, McCourt's
Dodgers have not ceased to be a valuable entity.
To deny that there was a massive double standard at
play here, to say that this thing wasn't always steeped in
an ugly sort of elitism, would be to ignore just how steeply
the deck was stacked against Frank McCourt when he took
over the Dodgers. To those same people who tossed off the
phrase "parking lot owner" like it was nothing, the idea of
handing over one of baseball's most beloved franchises
the one that comes with names like Robinson and

to this man was like selling the "Mona

SPORTS IN BRIEF

Symposium explores women in sports during and after college
On Friday, April 22, Hannah Purkey 'll and Kira
Kern 11 hosted the second annual Women in Sports
Symposium, which included a talk from Caitlin
Barrett, the program coordinator for Coach Across
America.
The Women in Sports Symposium focuses on the
challenges female athletes face at Swarthmore and
other colleges, and how to encourage women to stay
involved with sports after graduation.
The symposium was first held on April 5, 2009 by
Anna Baeth 'O9, the former captain of the Garnet field
hockey team, and Erin Heaney 'O9, the former captain
of the women's Garnet volleyball team. Baeth and
Heaney decided to hold the event after attending the
2009 Snell-Shillingford Coaching Symposium, which
was held at Bryn Mawr and focused on creating a network between female athletes and coaches. Baeth and
Heaney brought Jen Shillingford, a former field hockey coach and athletic director at Bryn Mawr, to discuss female athletes in college and the issues surrounding Title IX and athletes.
Title IX, which was passed in 1972, states that "no
person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance." College athletics falls under these Title IX
guidelines.

Both Kern and Purkey attended the 2009 Women in
Sports symposium, which inspired them to continue
the tradition this year.
"[The symposium] got female athletes together
with coaches of female teams and administrators and
it was such a great experience," Purkey said. "I
thought that was a good thing that we should continue doing."
Purkey and Kern modeled this year's symposium
after the 2009 Women in Sports symposium, but wanted to expand upon the theme of Title IX and focus
more on how women can continue their involvement

with sports after college.
"We decided to make it more how to stay involved
with sports after college, or even during college, and
how to help women in sports if you're not going to
become a professional athlete," Purkey said. "I don't
think that many Swatties are [going] to go down that
route."
Caitlin Barrett was the keynote speaker at this
year's event. Barrett works with Coach Across
America, a program that incorporates sports, teamwork and coaching as a form of mentorship for youth
in low-income, urban communities. Coach Across
America also works towards ending childhood obesity through sports and physical activity and encouraging youth involvement in sports. Barrett was also the
former director of the New York division of America
SCORES, a program which incorporates soccer and
learning for students from urban communities.
Purkey felt that students could identify with the
work Barrett does through Coach Across America
because of the program's work towards bettering the
world and children's lives through sports.
"Her kind of way of combining inner city kids
while doing sports is kind of [a] unique idea that I
think Swat athletes, if they knew more about, would
be excited about," Purkey said.
Barrett attended Pomona College and was also a
Division 111 athlete. "She has a similar background to
a lot of Swarthmore athletes, so I thought people
would identify with her and feel comfortable talking
to her about the challenges that come with being a
female athlete and continuing into athletics after college," Purkey said.
The symposium began with Barrett's discussion of
her own personal story and her experience as an athlete. "She talked about her own experiences as being
a female athlete and what that means and how it is
kind of difficult to stay involved with sports after college," Purkey said. During their time in college,
female athletes are ensured equal opportunities under

Title IX provisions, but according to Purkey, it can be
difficult for women to stay involved as professional
sports is still a very male-dominated world. Barrett
discussed how even in her non-profit work, which is
typically heavily dominated by women, she still
comes across the issue of whether women should continue to stay involved with sports.
She then opened up the symposium to discussions
to reach out to and incorporate more
about
female athletes and coaches into sports, both during
and after college.
After Barrett spoke, the audience, which consisted
of mainly female athletes as well as coaches, broke
into small group discussions about their involvement
with sports. Coaches and atheltic trainers, including
Harleigh Chwastyck, head volleyball coach, Jeremy
Toomis, head women's tennis coach, rugby coach
Laurie Focacci and Marie Mancini, the head athletic
trainer, talked about their experience with coaching
female athletics.
Female athletes from both varsity and club teams
attended the event. "Even if full teams didn't come, I
was glad that at least a couple people from a lot of different teams came so that maybe they can start a conversation with their teammates," Purkey said.
Purkey hopes that the symposium will become an
annual tradition and that future events will expand
upon the themes of female athletes in college and how
women can stay involved after graduation. "[At
Swarthmore, there are] these smart, amazing female
athletes that I feel like their perspective on these
issues is fascinating and I think if we can get discussions going I think that's great," Purkey said. "No
matter what, [when] you get these amazing women in
a room together, you're going to get a productive discussion going about important issues facing women
athletes."

Quakers dismantle Big Green in final home game
BY JOE SANFILLIPO
dailypennsylvanian.com, April 25,

2011

Prior to his final home game at
Penn, senior defenseman Brett Hughes
told his teammates they had made a lot
of memories at Franklin Field, but it
was time to make one more.
With a definitive 9-4 victory over
Dartmouth (5-8, 1-4 Ivy), the Quakers
(8-4, 4-2) did just that, closing out their
most successful Ivy League season in
five years and finishing their 2011 slate
a perfect 6-0 at home.
For the 10 graduating players,
Saturday's Senior Day made for an
atmosphere that was "pretty emotional
before the game," according to senior
midfielder Gorey Winkoff.
But Penn's Ancient Eight finale was
about more than just one class.
"We took the view of not necessarily being Senior Day, but this team's

senior attack Al Kohart said. "We've

Keeping the ball out of their net
allowed the Quakers time to find a

The Red and Blue rattled off four
unanswered goals to close the half
with a 4-1 lead. They then poured in
three more scores at the end of the
third quarter, at which point Winkoff

Sensing the desperation, the Big

net three shots in a row, closing the
gap to 7-4 with under nine minutes to

play.

"They got a couple cheap ones,"
Hughes said. "But we just kept sticking to the plan and we eventually
stopped them again."
After catching the Dartmouth goalie
wandering outside his crease, junior
attack John Conneely dumped in a
shot to make it 8-4. Kohart put the
icing on the cake shortly after, scoring
the final goal of the game.
The Quakers visit Virginia next
weekend for theirfinal regular-season

But as Murphy said, for now, the

Athletic department debuts Garnet Hall of Fame
ly, and nominations can go as far back as there are viable candidates.
Members of the Hall of Fame will be chosen by a committee of 11 people, five

BY RENEE FLORES
rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore College announced April 8 that there will soon be a Garnet Hall of
Fame. The Garnet Hall of Fame will be a way to honor past Swarthmore students
for their athletic performances during their college years. Discussions to create a
Hall of Fame have been in the works for several years, and a decision has finally
been made that a hall of fame would be the best way for the college to celebrate
athletes' accomplishments.
Other colleges and universities already have their own halls of fame, recognizing their athletes for accomplishments made during their college years, and
Swarthmore is now following suit. Swarthmore has lately been trying to amp up
the athletics department, and the Garnet Hall of Fame is one way of taking a step
forward in doing that.
The purpose of the Hall of Fame is to commemorate "teams and individuals
associated with athletics at Swarthmore College," according to the athletics website. For the past several years, members of the athletic department, including
Marian Ware director of athletics Adam Hertz, have been in discussions about
developing the Hall of Fame.
Hertz said in an e-mail that the Hall of Fame would be the best way to "recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of our athletes, coaches and others associated with the program." With this idea in mind, discussions have been aimed at
determining the best way to accomplish the desired effect of athletic recognition,
especially in a school where athletics are not in the forefront of decisions.
The Garnet Hall of Fame will be physically represented in the Lamb-Miller
Fieldhouse, as well as on the athletics website. "We are currently working with a
design company to create a display area in the lobby of the Tarble Pavilion. There
is also a page on the athletics website that will contain a list of all inductees, as
well as nomination information, by-laws, induction dates, etc.," Hertz said.
Athletes will be eligible for nomination to the Hall of Fame if they are
Swarthmore graduates of at least 10 years, and coaches become eligible at least
five years after retirement. Nominations will be considered and inducted annual-

of whom will be part of the permanent Hall of Fame Board, which has yet to be
determined. "They will appoint a group of six additional committee members who
will serve term appointments. Those members will include coaches, alumni and
current student-athletes," Hertz said. It is unknown if the alumni on the committee will have to be former student-athletes, but the committee is a way to incorporate more alumni relations and involvement on campus.
The inaugural group of nominations is currently being accepted and the recipients will be announced at the Awards Banquet in the 2011-12 academic year.
According to the website, nominations will be accepted from the college faculty,
staff, alumni, students and friends of the program. Nominations are submitted to
the Director ofAthletics in writing or on the athletics website.
"Highest consideration will go to those who have brought distinction to themselves and to the College through their accomplishments in athletics and their
contributions to their community and society," Hertz said. As Swarthmore is a
school that recognizes community outreach and service, it goes without saying
that consideration would go into finding student-athletes who not only performed
well in sports, but also personified Swattie ideals.
As for the opinion of the student-athletes in regards to the Hall of Fame, the
reaction seems positive. "Athletes practice every day, often during the regular
season and during the off season. They miss classes and valuable study time
because they are dedicated to their sports. I think it is important to recognize the
products of this dedication," Kelsey Johnson 'l3, a member of the Swarthmore
women's tennis team, said.
At Swarthmore, being a student-athlete means learning a complex balancing
act between classes, sports and club affiliations. With all of the time they spend
representing Swarthmore in sports endeavors, recognition of their feats is a
must. "I think this is important to student-athletes because it shows that their
commitment and dedication are worth noting. It shows that they will not just
graduate Swarthmore with a degree, but with a team and a memory," Johnson
said.

After a season full of ups and downs, the
Swarthmore baseball team's postseason chances
came down to the final day, as a three-win week
was not enough to get the Garnet into the
Centennial Conference playoffs. Two losses to the
Ursinus Bears were the deciding factor, as the
Bears tied the Garnet for fourth place in the
Conference and went into the playoffs on the headto-head tiebreaker.
Swarthmore celebrated Senior Day on Friday
against Ursinus, as Andy Allen, James Beall,
James Bernard, Isaac Han, Adam Koshkin, Neil
Mejia, Thomas Nakamura and Ben Schneiderman
played at Clothier Field for the last time in their
careers. That was, perhaps, the only cause for celebration, as the Garnet fell 15-0.
A Saturday double-header against F&M kept
playoff hopes alive, as Swarthmore earned a 6-3, 45 split. Ignacio Rodriguez 'l2 returned to form to
lead the Garnet in Game One, and every member
of the starting nine got at least one hit. However, a
Game Two rally from 5-1 down in the fifth culminated with the tying run on third base in the ninth
inning, ending Swarthmore's Conference season
with a 9-9 record.
Two non-Conference games to finish the season
allowed Swarthmore to end the year on a positive
note, as the Garnet defeated Eastern (6-4) on

start of his Swarthmore tenure, and left fielder

Pitt: Men, women's soccer teams wrap up spring season
BY GREG TRIETLEY

pittnews.com, April 20,

2011

Injuries plagued both the Pitt men and women's
soccer team this spring season, but it gave both teams
the opportunity to develop experience heading into

next fall's season.
The men's team tested players in different positions to see how they would play, while the women's
team was forced to start all 11 of its rostered players.
Both head coaches for the teams said that while the
injuries were unfortunate, now the teams know

where they stand as they prepare for next season.
The teams concluded spring play last Saturday, as
they finished an exhibition schedule in their new stadium, the Petersen Sports Complex.
While both teams experienced injuries, the
women's team seemed able to persevere past them
more easily than the men.
Although it played the majority of the spring with
just 11 players
meaning, it had no substitutes the
women had a dominate record, at 4-0-L
"You'd like things to go one way, but you just got to
do the best with what you have, and I think we did
that this spring," head coach SueMoy Chin said in an
interview Monday. "We would have liked some different things. I would have liked to see some combinations
whether it's at forward or in the midfield
but we didn't have the players to do that."
Despite injuries, the women's team still took positives away from the situation.
"We got a couple of girls back from injury in the
last game
but to play 90 minutes with 11 girls, our
fitness was really good," Chin said. "We had girls
playing out of position in order to play."
The lack of depth gave younger players such as
midfielder Danielle Benner, forward Morgan Masci
and defender Alyssa Meier a chance to gain valuable
on-field experience.
"It helps in their development to get that experience," Chin said. "It allows them to show us what they
can bring to the program. The competition was good.
It wasn't Big East opponents, but it's still important to
get that experience."

THE PHOENIX

Perhaps the biggest change from last fall to this
the
spring and beyond is in goal. Morie Kephart
school's all-time wins and shutouts leader graduat-

ed, so the largely untestedKristina Rioux played most
of this month's exhibition games.
"She's been training behind Morie for the past
three years, so it was good for her to get some action
in the net and some playing time," Chin said. "It helps
build her confidence. It's differentfrom just training,
to apply it to a game."
The Panthers shut out four of their five opponents
this spring. Only Duquesne cracked their defense, but
Pitt still won 5-2.
"We definitely made some mistakes, but I think
we're a little bit more seasoned now," Chin said. "Our
understanding got a lot better in the attack with our
possession, but our decision-making needs to be betunderstanding different
ter. I think that's youth
playing situations and different pressure."
But while the women finished undefeated despite
the injuries, the men's team had more trouble adjusting to the change.
"We didn't get done what we hoped in the spring
mainly because of injuries," men's head coach Joe
Luxbacher said.
Luxbacher used the spring to try players at new
positions. The Panthers had to replace departing
defenders Connor Malone and Andy Kalas, and
Luxbacher was creative in doing so. He shifted Robert
Iledare previously a forward
to the back line.
"We wanted to get an idea going into the fall

very good idea
Luxbacher said in an interview Tuesday. "[lledare] is
a big, strong, skilled athlete, and I thought maybe he'd
be a good fit to play in the back. He did a pretty solid
job."

Goalkeepers Keegan Gunderson and Matt Aberegg
missed time with concussions, which gave tryout
player Mark Hast several starts.
Luxbacher also considered Mike Whitaker at center back, shifted defender Alex Harrison up to midfield and tried Alex Fischetti at right back. Fischetti
split time between the back line and midfield last season before a concussion cut it short.

April 28, 2011

"We're going to play a bit different system next
fall," Luxbacher said. "We're looking at that this
spring."

That system
which the team started to use
toward the end of last year
is a 4-3-3, in which the
Panthers will play three forwards instead of two. With
the change, the men's team finished spring play 2-2-2
and held the opposition to three goals in six games.
Yet, like last year, the Panthers created chances but
struggled to find the back of the net.
"We need to put the ball in the goal," midfielder
Ryan Brode said in an interview Tuesday. "We've
been pretty good defensively, but offensively, we really haven't been able to find our rhythm."
Luxbacher was impressed with how the adjustments went even though it didn't show on the scoreboard. Pitt played the Pittsburgh Riverhounds
a
local professional team
to open the exhibition season and matched them chance-for-chance until the
Riverhounds scored a late goal to win 1-0.
"We played pretty well," Luxbacher said. "We had
chances. They're definitely a Big East-caliber outfit.
They're a professional group."
The scores of the games mean little in the long run,
as Pitt's spring lineup won't resemble the final fall
team. The Panthers have eight recruits arriving for
training camp in August.
The men's and women's teams have already adjusted to the new synthetic turf at their new stadium,
which allows for crisper passes than the grass at
Founders Field.
"I think it stood out the first game," Chin said. "We
moved the ball around really well. Our possession
was probably the best I've seen it in a game, and I
think that has a lot to do with the surface we're playing on."
Both Chin and Luxbacher said that the move to
campus helps them in every aspect of the program
from training to recruiting to playing.
"It allows you to play better soccer," Luxbacher
said. "You can really use skill more. When you play
on a field like Founders, especially late in the season,
it's muddy and heavy. You can't play the same way
you do when the surface is good."
