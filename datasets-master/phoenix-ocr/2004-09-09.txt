Living wage debate awaits resolution
Bloom agreed, explaining that the issue

BY BEN OLDFIELD

boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

The board of managers will discuss
implementation of a living wage at its Oct.
1 meeting.

The Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign, which presented its
first report to President Al Bloom in
February 200 L feels that the issue has been
left unresolved for too long.
"We've been waiting and waiting.
There's a sense of urgency now," campaign
member Harris Kornstein 'O6 said.
"Whatever Al Bloom's priorities and opinions are, he's been slowing the decisionmaking process."

"We've been waiting and
waiting. There's a sense of
urgency now."
Harris Kornstein 'O6
The campaign has been pressuring the
board to decide on the issue for three years
and believes Bloom and the board have
been unjustifiably breaking promised
deadlines," Kornstein said.
In a meeting Wednesday with Bloom,
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l and
board
of managers Chair Barbara
Mathers '65, campaign members accused
Bloom and the board of failing to consider
seriously the proposal put together by the
Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage. A
majority of the committee had proposed a
$10.72 per hour wage, excluding childcare
and health care, in its February report.
During the meeting, Kornstein said the
campaign has received no new information
from Bloom or the board since February.
"We know it's a hard issue
but frankly,
it's time to start making decisions," wrote
...

Kornstein in the letter to the board.
Mathers said that the board has done all
it can to make progress on the issue.
"We've discussed it several times and we
will continue to discuss it, but there's no
consensus yet," she said.

was too important to rush. "You're talking
about something huge," he said to the campaign members during the meeting. "It's
equivalent to the creation of an entire academic department. When in the history of
this school has an allocation of this sum
happened quickly?"

Just fulfilling the campaign's demand
that all employees be provided health care
would require $5 million from the college's
endowment, according to Bloom.
Implementing the entire program,
which includes a minimum wage of $10.72,
childcare and health care, would amount to
$5O million.
Despite these costs, campaign members
believe wages could be increased within
the alloted budget if the college reevaluates
how it compensates its staff. That would
entail giving the same financial attention
to staff wages that large-scale events, financial aid packages and new buildings have,
Kornstein said.
Bloom also denied certain charges made
against him by the campaign, including his
accused 13 percent salary increase, at the

meeting.
Campaign member Alix Gould-Werth'O7
expressed frustration at the administration's perceived lack of effort to encourage
a dialogue among and educate students,
faculty and staff about the issue.
According to Gould-Werth, a committee
chaired by Eldridge was formed in
February to bring about and facilitate discussion throughout the community.
"The committee didn't formally meet
and only held one event," she said. "The
event was a panel with not enough time for
questions," she said.
But, Associate Vice President for Human
Resources Melanie Young, who co-chaired
the ad hoc committee, believes that a "genuine effort" was made by the administration
to inform the community of the issue.
A questionnaire designed to determine
whether the community wanted more discussion regarding the living wage was sent
to 3,000 e-mail accounts and placed in all
facilities, dining services and environmental services employee mailboxes in April,

A student pauses to examine the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign's banners
protesting the college's pay scale in front of Parrish.
Young said.

The results, according to Young, showed
"there isn't a fire in people's bellies about

this."

There were 40 e-mail returns, and 13
paper returns. Of the responses, eight staff
members, five of whom were dining servic-

es employees, three faculty members and

nine students expressed interest in further
discussion of the living wage.
The pace at which the board comes to a
decision is limited by the many opinions

held by the community, Young said.
"We are moving forward at a pace that
allows a decision to be reached in time for
next year's budget cycle," she wrote in a

document entitled "Misunderstandings
Surrounding the Living Wage Campaign,"
prepared last Monday.
In the document, she rebuts certain

accusations that have been made against
the board and administration by the cam-

paign.
Answering a charge that senior administration staff salary grades have been
increased substantially, she wrote that
senior staff were only recently put on a
pay grade.
Furthermore, they were put on a pay
grade to increase the transparency of the
compensation system, she wrote.
Regardless of whether the board decides
at its October meeting to implement a living wage or not, it has until its February
budget meeting to develop a fiscal plan for
the wage increase.

"Nothing conclusive will happen in
October," Mathers said.
If passed, the living wage would be put
into effect in June 2005.

Student arrested, charged with underage drinking
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

Swarthmore police arrested a
student Saturday night during a
swim team party at Olde Club.
The student has been charged
with public drunkenness, underage drinking and carrying false
identification.

appeared to be a "domestic dispute," Swarthmore Police Chief
Brian Craig said.
At the point, the officer got out
of his vehicle and approached the
two students. The female student
left the area before the officer
could reach them.
The officer observed that the

THE PHOENIX

male student was having a "hard
time standing straight," Craig
said. He then "started a conversation with [the student] and detected a strong odor of alcoholic bev-

erage" on his breath.
Upon being asked his age, "[the
student] said he was 30," Craig
said. He then presented the officer

with a New York driver's license
"that appeared to not be him."
The officer administered an
on-site breathalyzer test that registered the student's blood alcohol level as "very high," and the
student "was then brought to

police headquarters," according
to Craig.
Public Safety was notified of
the arrest by the officer when he
was still on the scene, but the student "was already in the custody
of the Swarthmore police when
[Public Safety] got there," according to Public Safety Director
Owen Redgrave.

"In the process of checking
identification, [the Swarthmore
Police Department] found out [the
student] was a 19-year-old and had
a different name than the one that
was previously presented on the
driver's license," Craig said.
This led the police to issue the
three citations to the student.
The student was later released
to the custody of Public Safety
officers, who took him to Worth
Health Center, Redgrave said.
Assistant Dean and Gender
Education Advisor Karen Henry,
who was the dean on duty this
weekend, was called at home
Saturday night and notified of the

student's arrest, though she did
not have to come to campus.
Deans rotate serving as dean
on duty, which means that they
are available for contact if an

incident occurs on campus so that
action can be taken if necessary
and so that the deans can assist
September 9, 2004

students if needed, Henry said.
Deans are called in response to a
variety of instances, including
student illness or injury, as well
as for incidents of like vandalism
and fire.
Redgrave and Craig said patrol
of the campus by Swarthmore
Police Department officers is a
normal practice.

"We include the college campus
as part of the patrol. We're
just trying to make sure you're as
safe as everyone else," Craig said.
"The Swarthmore police do
not notify us when they come on
campus," Redgrave said, adding
that this occurs on "a regular
basis."
But, according to Redgrave,
...

this does not involve entering college buildings. "There's an agreement about Swarthmore police
entering residence halls. The stipulation is that it has to be a
reported safety issue to enter

without

[Public

Safety's]

approval."

This agreement also extends to
other college buildings, including
party venues.
"[The Swarthmore police] just
wouldn't waltz into a party or
academic building without a reason," Redgrave said.
The penalty for the student's
charges will be decided by a district court judge, who received
notification of the citations this
week and will set a court date,
Craig said.
Henry has yet to meet with the
student and does not yet know
enough information to determine
the college's course of action.
The next step for the college is
to discuss the incident with the
student and Public Safety and
determine if the action requires

further intervention from the
deans or the College Judicial
Committee.

Students enjoy
pay scale raise

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

The student pay scale has increased by 2.3 percent for the
2004-2005 school year. The top scale for campus jobs is now $7.81,
followed by a middle scale of $7.55 and a bottom scale of $7.29,
Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot said.
"The percentage increase is set by the board of managers
after a recommendation from the College Budget Committee,"
Talbot said. "Every single cent comes from a discussion in that
committee."
The committee considered a variety of factors in crafting the
budget, including the student pay scale increase. "Certain equilibrium assumptions are built into the budget," Vice President
for Finance Sue Welsh said.
These equilibrium assumptions include increases in tuition,
inflation and increases in student and staff pay. These increases usually are based on an inflationary percentage, rounded off
to the cent.
"We also use the wages paid to students at other schools as a
benchmark," Welsh said. "We have access to that information
from financial aid directors. In this year's budget, we froze
departmentalbudgets and prioritized an increase in the student
pay scale."
"I'm mildly thrilled. The extra cents are going to add up over
time," van driver Rachel Rynick 'O7 said. "If they add up to
twenty bucks, that's a CD you couldn't have bought otherwise."
"If this is one of the things contributing to the gross increase
in tuition, then I'm against it because 20 cents here and there is
nothing," Mischa Stephens 'O6, who works as a Mullan desk
attendant, said.
"I hope that we compensate students properly for their work,
but I also hope that the pay scale is not an incentive to work,"
Talbot said. "It's a different kind of campus because students
don't have to pay for activities. That's part of our Quaker heritage. Ideally, students can find work that coincides with a
hobby."
Students agree that the wage increase does not really impact
whether they work or not.

"I hope that [the college] compensates
students properly for their work, but I
also hope that the pay scale is not an
incentive to work."
Laura Talbot

director of financial aid
"I'm basically just using the money I earn as minimal spending money," Stephens said. "I think what they pay is pretty consistent with what I need. Maybe I could get more working somewhere on the Pike, but the commute isn't worth the time."
Andrew Herrmann 'OB worked as a lifeguard at home over
the summer and made about $9 an hour. He is also working as a
lifeguard at Swarthmore.
"The lower pay isn't a big deal for me. It's good work; it's
pretty low key," Herrmann said.
"When you have a job like the library, or the Mullan center,
you get the opportunity to have focused time to reflect or read,"
Stephens said. "Otherwise you might not go to the library or the
gym as often."
There are UOO students on the Swarthmore payroll each
year. About half these students are on financial aid.
Collectively, students earn over $1 million a year through campus jobs, according to Talbot.
"In some financial aid packages, we require a very manage-

able amount of work
seven to eight hours a week
considering students for scholarships," Talbot said.

before

This is not the first time student wages have undergone a
substantial increase. In February 2000, the CBC approved a student pay increase of 16 percent, The Phoenix reported. This pay
increase did not cause an increase in students looking for jobs,
according to Talbot.
Staff wages have also increased. "Staff got a higher increase
than students did, based on the inflation rate and benchmarks
set by area market research surveys," Welsh said.
Last year, the student pay scale was $7.69, $7.38 and $7.12. The
Pennsylvania minimum wage is the same as federal minimum
wage, $5.15 an hour, according to the U.S. Federal Labor

Department's Web site.

Delays complicate Co-Op construction

the
Swarthmore Food Cooperative
market in the Ville from opening
on time.
The project's completion was

initially planned for August 2004,
but the date has been pushed back
to mid-October. The delay is a
result ofboth last spring's weather,
which hampered construction, and
the process of "pooling financial
resources," which is taking longer
than expected, Co-Op General
Manager Jack Cavanaugh said.
Once the new Co-Op is completed, products will be moved out of
the current Co-Op building, which
will then be replaced by a one-way
street and bike trail leading to
Myers Avenue.
The demolition of the current
Co-Op property will be the first
phase in a series of streetscape
changes the borough has been
planning since 1999. These changes
have also been delayed. Originally
estimated to be completed by July
2004, the project has been pushed
back as a result of the Co-Op's
delay.
In August, the council authorized contractors to bid on the demolition of the Co-Op. The demolition phase of the project will take
roughly one month to complete.
The second phase will be the
improvement of parking accommodations for shoppers along Myers
Avenue.

"This part of the project will

Right now, shoppers don't use

well as organic,

helping local governments improve
"alternate methods of transporta-

tion," like railways, biking and
pedestrian walkways. The FTEA
has granted the borough SL3 million to complete the project.
Billings, who was in charge of
finding funding for the project,

said the federal government provided for the most significant portion of the costs.
In the past, the borough has
relied upon independent groups,
such as Town Center, Inc. and the
Swarthmore Business Authority,
for grants.

is what Billings called the "beautification phase." All sidewalks
beginning at the PNC Bank located
on Chester Road and ending at the
old Michael's College Pharmacy
building will be adorned with a 30-

inch strip of bricks at the curb.
"The bricks will provide easy
access to utilities under the
street," Billings said. "But will also

be consistent with what we call the
'look of Swarthmore.'"
The sidewalk project will also
include the replacement of 20-foothigh street lamps with shorter,
pedestrian-level lights, modeled
after those surrounding Parrish.
Recycling receptacles, planted
trees and bike trails will also be

added.

disturbances and holiday traffic

could further delay the process.

"Most of the shops in
Swarthmore are dependent upon
holiday shopping," Billings said.
"We don't want construction to
disrupt it."
Despite these obstacles, Billings
said that all streetscape construc-

tion will be completed by May
2005.
When finished, the new Co-Op
building will feature 3,000 more
square feet of floor space, a professional kitchen, a cafe area, as well
as a greater selection of organic,

The new location's grand opening will include demonstrationsof

Students, faculty unite to register voters
New coalition seeks to get Swarthmore students and area residents to the polls
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore Voter Registration
Coalition, founded last spring by Ethan
Ucker 'O7 and Christian DeSimone 'O6, has

undertaken initiatives to register voters at
the college and in surrounding Chester and
Upper Darby before the presidential election this November.
Prior to SVRC's founding, several
groups on campus had been planning voter
registration drives, including the College
Swarthmore Progressive
Democrats,
Action Committee, Choosing Clarity and
Radical African Dissent.

"Our goal would be ideally
that everyone on
campus will vote."
Christian DiSimone 'O6
"The idea behind [SVRC] was to unify
all those efforts and have one group in
charge of voter registration," Ucker said.
The group's efforts in Chester and
Upper Darby have been coordinated with
Delaware County Wage Peace and Justice,
a Quaker organization, and other left-lean-

ing groups, including America Coming
Together, Peace on Streets! Peace on Earth!

and Delaware

County Democrats.

The drive, however, is non-partisan.
"All of the groups that we are working
with, even those that are partisan organizations, are all running, and we are all col-

laborating on specifically non-partisan
voter registration efforts," Ucker said. "We
register everyone, Republicans and
Democrats alike."
College Republicans have not been
involved in the effort up to this point. "We
invited them. We're still open to them com-

ing and helping out. They're more than
welcome to come," DeSimone said.
College Republicans President Maria

Macia 'O7 said she would introduce the
issue at the organization's next meeting.
"As the new leader of the group, I'm definitely open to getting involved in [the voting drive effort]," she said.
Last spring, SVRC organized a three-day
voter drive in Chester during the first weekend in May. Twenty-two Swarthmore stu-

dents went block-to-block, stopping people
on the street to ask whether or not they were
registered to vote. The effort registered over
80 people.
"I think most people in this country are
pretty unaware of how many specific populations are totally disenfranchised, and

systematically underserved, democratically speaking," DeSimone said.
"Four-fifths of eligible Chester residents
are registered, but a far smaller percentage
actually show up to vote," DeSimone said.
"The trick is getting people to the polls,"
DeSimone added. The group will work on

and providing free transportation to
polling stations, both in Swarthmore and
in Chester and Upper Darby.
"Because of the success of SVRC's
Chester drive last spring, the group is planning a drive each weekend in September,"
DeSimone said. The group's registration
effort will be forced to stop near the end of
September because the last day to register
to vote in Pennsylvania is Oct. 4.
The campaign has also organized an oncampus drive, called Every Swattie Votes,
to register Swarthmore students and help
students registered in other states to
change their registration to Pennsylvania,
since it is considered a "swing state" by
both parties.
"During orientation and the first week
of school, the drive registered over 150
first-year students," Ucker said.
"Our goal would be ideally that everyone on campus will vote," DeSimone said,
though he admitted the goal might be unrealistic. As part of the campaign the coalition is also working to broadcast the presidential debates on campus.
Along with registering students at
Swarthmore, Aaron Strong 'O6 has led the
group's efforts to facilitate absentee voting

"Last spring we had packets sent out to
all the 100 or so students who were going to
be abroad in the fall," he said. "[We sent
them] absentee ballot instruction forms for

"There's a federal law that college registrars are required to make a good faith
effort to encourage voter registration,"
Warner said. "This means that registrars

must at least send students voter registration forms, but beyond that the legal
requirements are vague," he said.

September 9, 2004

In addition to making voter registration
forms available, Warner has expanded the
section on the registrar's Web site that
explains how students can register.
Swarthmore is a particularly difficult place

to register students properly because different dorms are

in different

precincts,

meaning some students already registered
in Swarthmore will need to change their
registration if they want to vote this fall.
"In the past there were questions about
where to vote, and what precinct to vote
in," Warner said. "I think I've dealt with

that on the Web site and made it very easy."
Warner added that student interest in
registration efforts this year surpasses that
of previous years. "It's mind boggling how
much interest there is in voter registration
this fall. I've never seen anything like it

before."

"[Warner] has been an excellent
resource in terms of getting down to the
nitty-gritty of the rules and procedures of

Pennsylvania

voting
regulations,"
DeSimone said. "We've come to him for
ideas and general networking contacts."
Berger has worked with the group in
part through his Democratic Theory and
Practice course. Part of the required work
for the course is that students go with

SVRC members on the campaign's drives,
as well as other voter registration and
turn-out related work.
"It's my belief that it's a very important
learning experience for college students,
for all people really," Berger said of the
group's work. "By getting involved in the
community, we're able to see in a way that
the books can't tell us what a challenge it
can be to get people involved in politics,
both students on a Saturday morning and
busy residents of any urban community."
SVRC has received some funding from
the political science department as well as
through Berger's Democracy Project fund,
through which Berger has committed
money for his own students' voter registration efforts. The Democracy Project is a
program Berger runs that pays for events
related to his civic engagement classes and
attempts to encourage civic engagement at

Swarthmore more broadly.

Ville finds buyer for former pharmacy
Nature of business that will occupy storefront is still unknown, officials say
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu
The building that housed Michael's College

Pharmacy, the Ville institution that has been
closed since March, is moving toward new ownership.

The plan to sell the storefront and four
apartments above it to a real estate investment
group could be finalized as soon as Oct. L
Lee B. Greenwood, the real estate broker
handling the sale, declined to divulge specific
details about the deal, because he said it could
jeopardize the purchase.
Neither the college nor the borough administration has been informed of the nature of the

buyer. The potential owner has not applied for
a building permit, which suggests there are no
immediate plans for renovation.

idents "need a business that will attract people
a foot-traffic, retail-oriented store" to draw in
patrons from the surrounding area.
"Having something to generate student and
faculty interest would be great," Gerner added.
Tom Huestis, borough director of finance
and community development, agreed.
"We have an interest in having something
retail-oriented, as opposed to professional," he

said.

"I know students would love to see a space
where they can go late," Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
The store presents a complex opportunity
because of the combination of its location near
the train station, its well-known facade, and its
deceptively small size.
Since it measures just 1,700 square feet, it is
extremely unlikely that the storefront could
entice a big-name chain retailer, borough offi-

cials said.

"We have an interest in having
something retail-oriented, as
opposed to professional."

Both Gerner and Huestis firmly denied a
rumor that Starbucks Coffee had been contacted about opening an outlet.
Schall said a restaurant or cafe would be the
best option, especially for drawing student
patronage.
Interest regarding a prospective buyer is
palpable in the entire community.

Theresa

Greenwood said that the owner would rent
out the apartments and a retail store but that
the contract specifically prohibited the opening
of another pharmacy.
College administrators said a student-oriented store is a high priority, and Vice President
Larry Schall said the college plans to participate

in the recruitment process for the build-

that had "socially responsible management
the living wage and organic products."
He also suggested that the college offer a
grant to recent alumni or to students so they
could develop an establishment in the space. He
said greater college involvement would be integral to attracting more student patronage.
"This is a great opportunity for a
Swarthmore College-owned business," he said.

Free culture movement hits campuses across the U.S.
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
The free culture movement at Swarthmore, which was
started last year with the founding of the Swarthmore
Coalition for the Digital Commons by Nelson Pavlosky 'O6
and Luke Smith 'O6, is making inroads at college campuses across the country.
The movement fights for freedom of speech on the
Internet and against overly restrictive copyright laws and
media consolidation, according to Pavlosky.
Last spring, SCDC launched freeculture.org, a Web site
dedicated to the free culture movement. The site, which
serves as an international hub for the movement, has led
the movement to grow tremendously, spawning similar
groups on campuses all over the United States.
The site provides a database of college free culture
groups and is used by students who are starting free culture clubs on their own campuses to coordinate and discuss ideas for their respective groups.
The site also includes a weblog for free culture posters
and a self-proclaimed "free culture manifesto" outlining
the mission of the free culture movement.
"[Freeculture.org users] have a lot of communication,"
Rebekah Baglini, a Bryn Mawr sophomore who is starting
an on-campus group, said. "We have conference calls about
twice a week."
In addition to the Bryn Mawr club, free culture clubs
are expected to start this semester at Brown, Columbia,
Cornell, Duke, Emory, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford,
New York University, University of Connecticut,
University of Michigan and Yale, Pavlosky said.

Emory University senior Desirina Boskovich, who
started a club at Emory this semester, found the Web site
after developing an interest in free culture issues.

the past year I'd been interested in copyright
she said. After reading "The Right to Read" by
Stallman, she found freeculture.org on the

while doing some research on the movement and
decided to start her own club.
"Getting a free culture club started at Emory was a

natural progression [for me]," she said.

Baglini became motivated to start her own free culture
club at Bryn Mawr after hearing Stanford University law
professor Lawrence Lessig speak at Swarthmore in April,
when he was brought to campus for the launch of freeculture.org.
"That was where I learned about the free culture movement," Baglini said
Boskovich's club is one of the more developed of this
year's crop of free culture clubs at college campuses, since
the club was able to announce its presence at Emory's
activities fair.
Boskovich said about 50 people are on the club's e-mail
list, and the list-serve has been active leading up to the
club's first meeting.
Other campuses, including Bryn Mawr, have still not
held their activities fairs, meaning that many clubs are
still in the planning stage.
In the meantime, Baglini has begun to build the groundwork for her club by approaching certain academic departments to gauge their level of interest in the issues involved
in the free culture movement.
Bryn Mawr's Language Learning Center has been especially supportive, Baglini said, since it could be affected by
developments in copyright law.
The center often re-records foreign films in VHS format
so that students can watch them, an action that could
potentially violate laws like the Digital Millennium Act,
which have strict provisions banning the copying of cer-

September 9, 2004

tain media.
Baglini has also targeted the art history department at
Bryn Mawr, pointing out that copyright laws could affect
the use of slides in art history classes.
In addition she hopes to find free culture supporters
among student studio artists who look to others' artistic
creations for inspiration and more' direct uses and, as
such, could come into conflict with existing copyright

laws.
The free culture movement advocates having much less
strict copyright rules on art so that artists can have more
creative license when utilizing older works of art for their

own creations.
Boskovich described the main obstacle facing her club
as a lack of knowledge about the issues. "People need
someone to explain [free culture] to them and hold their

hand," she said.
Lack of interest in a relatively political issue like free
culture is a problem she foresees at her school. "Emory is
not an overtly activist campus," she said.
At Swarthmore, SCDC is planning to host more educational events like the campus-wide information meeting
held last Thursday. Pavlosky said that about 20 people
attended the meeting.
Though SCDC has been involved in a lawsuit with
Diebold Election Systems, Pavlosky said that the group
does not plan to have voting-related programming this
year.
"We're not voting nerds," Pavlosky said.
One of his goals is to make SCDC appear friendlier to
those who are not versed in the minutiae of the computing
world.
"A lot of people have this conception that we're geeks
only. We're trying to be more accessible to non-geeks,"
Pavlosky

said.

Observers: Third-party
group ads aid Bush bounce
BY MATT WACHTER
DAILY COLLEGIAN (PENNSYLVANIA STATE U.)
(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.
Since the conclusion of the
Republican National Convention, President George W. Bush has taken a
seven-point lead over Sen. John Kerry in recent polls, a jump that Kerry did
not experience after the Democratic National Convention in July.
Those following the election attribute the bounce to a number of factors,
one of those being ads placed by third-party political groups not directly affil-

iated with the candidates.

Lounges in Parrish, which were created from former dorm rooms, contain little furniture and are
without televisions or computers.

Construction project leaves
Parrish without social space
woke me up earlier than I wanted to."
Students have also voiced ccomplaints about
reduced social life as a result of the construction

BY AMANDA WINTERS
awinterl@swarthmore.edu
When the Parrish renovation project is completed, residents will have a new fourth floor
lounge and kitchen joining the two wings. But,
for the time being, residents are left without
public area computers, useable lounge space or

other amenities.

Room 300, the lounge on Parrish Third East,
is intended to be a computer room, yet there are
currently no computers there or in any public
areas in the residential portion of Parrish. There
are also no televisions in the three open lounges,
which are right across the hall from the construction barrier.

"Last year people were always
walking through Parrish
[now] they just come in to
check their mailboxes and
leave as soon as possible."

...

In addition, the lounges have little furniture
and, given their location at the end of the halls,
are most susceptible to noise and dust from construction.
Parrish RA Lola Irele 'O5 said due to the condition of the lounges, her hall "just had [their
first meeting] in the hall."
"Some of my friends want to hang out here,
but there are no lounges. It could be better if we
had a lounge or some TVs," Justin Chen 'OB

said.

Jonathan Sarmiento 'O6 felt unaffected by the
lack of TVs or lounges. "Frankly, it doesn't
bother me that much," he said. He pointed to the
fact that Hallowell, where he lived as a
sopohmore, did not have lounges last year due to
a housing crunch.
Because of last year's housing crunch,
lounges in Hallowell were converted into rooms,

"The first week without the Internet and the
lack of computers was really a pain," Parrish
resident Sarah Gordon 'O7 said. She also noted

project.

Lee Paczulla 'O5, who has requested a room
change, recalled, "Last year people were always
walking through Parrish because it's so central.
This year they just come in to check their mail-

boxes and leave as soon as possible."
"I lived in Parrish last year, so I like the
building," Paczulla said. What moved her to
request a room change were both the isolation
and the noise. She described the social side of
Parrish as "just kind of lifeless."
"The major loss is Parrish Parlours," Parrish
PvA Jesse Young 'O5 said. He did not see a major
change in social life in the building. "I don't
think [the social life] is any different than
before," he said.
"I think when people try to get in this dorm
they realize it's not the center of social activity,"
said Tyler Lyson 'O6, who described the social
atmosphere of Parrish as "fairly quiet."
Some believe the construction elicits intense
reactions only from those who have previously
lived in Parrish. "The freshmen don't really see
[the construction] as an inconvenience, as they
haven't lived here before," Irele said.
"It's been very frustrating as an RA to have
all of these issues on the hall," said Irele about
the renovation project, but she also added that,
"it's more of an annoyance."
"I'm trying to stay positive because I know
it's all for a purpose," she said.
Young noted that the men's side of the dorm
has yet to experience the worst effects of the construction. "I'm waiting to see what happens
when they start working on [the men's] side," he

said.

He pointed to the planned construction of an
elevator shaft as potentially posing a major

inconvenience.
Currently the east and west central staircases, the north wing and Second East are closed,
as are the third floor West hall lounge on the
men's side and the women's east wing kitchen.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal said the project is expected to be completed before residents move in for fall 2005.
New sprinklers and upgraded electrical systems should be in place within the next few
weeks, but other improvements are unlikely to
be completed during this academic year.

September 9, 2004

Bob Shepherd, Centre County (Pa.) Democratic Committee chair, said the
recent polls are not a concern for the Democratic Party.
"Unless there is a consistent polling result for a long period of time with a
big difference in the polls, I don't feel they are a big deal," Shepherd said.
Some Democrats disregard the influence of the Republican convention on
Bush's popularity.
"The post-convention bounce that Bush got is no indication of how the election will go," Rich Rogers, Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania General
Assembly 171st district, said.
However, Republicans argue that the public cannot relate to Kerry and that
Bush's surge in the polls is the result ofboth the convention and his long-term
campaign message.
"You do expect a bounce following a convention just because of the media
attention that is played from that. I don't think we saw that from Senator
Kerry, but I believe that we have seen such a bounce from Bush," said G.T.
Thompson, Centre County Republican Party chair.
Both presidential candidates' popularity has been under attack throughout
the current campaign season and is constantly being measured.
"Polling is important throughout the process for varying purposes; both
campaigns have internal polling, as well as the RNC and DNC, as well as many
state-level campaigns also retain private pollsters as well," Penn State student
Tiffany Iriana, Students for Bush in Pennsylvania executive director, said.
Iriana said one reason for Kerry's drop in the polls could be criticism of
Kerry's war record by 527 groups, which are named after their tax-code designation.
Political science professor James Eisenstein said these groups get around
the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill, which limits contributions to political parties, by remaining independent from the campaigns. The
groups can raise and spend as much money as they want, he added.
The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an active 527 group, has begun an ad

campaign attacking Kerry.

Several Democrats denounced the group, and Kerry's service in Vietnam
has become a cornerstone of his campaign.
On the opposite side of the election, Moveon.org, a liberal-leaning 527
group, has produced television ads comparing Bush to Hitler. However,
everyone does not agree about the necessity of the political activity of the 527
groups in the political debate.
"Unfortunately, for every piece of legislation that is passed, there are both
intentional and unintentional consequences," Thompson said. "McCainFeingold empowered these fringe groups by leaving loopholes, while it hurt
the free speech of individuals."
Bush has called for the dismissal of all 527 organizations, which are contributing to the political ads.
Liberal-leaning groups outnumber and out-fund conservative 527s significantly.
"527s are the law of the land," Shepherd said.
Politicians are fighting for a small percentage of swing voters and polls
should be switching soon, said communication arts and sciences professor
Dianne Gregg, who is working as Pennsylvania Legislature candidate Jon
Eich's campaign manager.
"This is the most important time for students since the '6os," Gregg said.
"Students are going to make a powerful difference in this election, but they
have to get out and vote."

Bigger screens,
but still nothing on
Swarthmore students now have yet another reason to put off
that reading. Over the summer, Special Projects Director Alice
Balbierer purchased four 56-inch television sets for dorm
lounges.
"[Associate Dean for Student Life] Myrt Westphal called me
and said that students would really like large TVs in the bigger
dorms, so larger groups of students could gather to watch
events like the Super Bowl and the presidential debates,"

Balbierer said.
Olivia Toro 'O5, a Mary Lyon RA who served on the housing
committee last year, said the housing committee did not discuss
buying the televisions. However, she expects that they will have
a positive effect on student life. "ML plans to have movie nights
every weekend. We think it'll be a big draw" and encourage community bonding.

The new TVs are located in Mephistos lounge, Mertz, the New
Dorm and Mary Lyon. During orientation, the Mephistos TV was
used to screen "Casablanca."
"So far, people aren't really watching any more TV than
usual," Mary Lyon RA Jawaad Hussain 'O5 said. "But people definitely appreciate having the 56-inch screen."
The TVs in Willets and the New Dorm have not been hooked
up to cable yet.
"Willets should have it very shortly," Balbierer said. "Comcast
may need to design a different kind of cable circuit for the New
Dorm."
Each of the new TVs cost $1,435 and came with a stand. The
money for the TVs came from the special projects budget.
"Very rarely do I have anything left over," Balbierer said. "The
[special projects budget] money goes to furniture and renovations, but there was no big renovation project last year, so I
could buy the TVs. I just bought less furniture and recycled furniture from the Science Center."

First stop is the Men's Rugby table. I begin the
interview with a gimme: "So how would you guys like
it if I tried out for rugby?" A huge cheer erupts.
Encouraged, I press on: "Can you tell me why I should
join?" Their answer is concise, articulate, well-reasoned, and to the point: "We're the best m *****f*****s
ever!" What more could I ask for? I add my name to
their mailing list and move on, stopping only to grab
a complimentary rugby bumper sticker. After all, the
buzzard-choking-on-a-football artwork goes perfectly
with the car I don't own.
Next up are the College Democrats. Thanks to my
political awareness, I barely need to ask them anything. Reasons for joining? Please. I have cable. I saw
John Kerry on The Daily Show. What more is there to
know about democratic initiatives? I quickly join
their mailing list too, though their lack of free goodies gives me pause. They could've at least had those
spiffy "I voted, but all I got was this lousy president"
buttons.
SCDC is next. They overwhelm me with free
things
buttons, stickers, a bastardized picture of
Mickey Mouse
all of which I graciously refuse. I'd
love to have it, but I'm not stupid. I've heard about the
campus crackdown on copyrighted material. No
mouse is going on my wall without Disney's express
written consent, no matter how darn cute and rebellious it is. Meanwhile, I ask about SCDC's fall plans.
Their response is less than heartening. "We haven't
figured out yet who we're suing this semester," one
anti-copyright crusader admits.
And so the afternoon goes. I sign my name on
Vertigo-go's giant cardboard box. (Poorly, as it turns
out. Purple marker does not take well to packing
tape). I try tactfully to escape overly eager folk dance
recruiters. (Their schedule, sadly, conflicts with some
of my favorite TV shows. Ergo, my niche can't be
there). I add my name to more mailing lists than I can
count. (Need to know when the Pterodactyl Hunt is?
Curious about tomorrow's rugby practice? Interested
in Storming the Dorms? My mailbox is an all-purpose
information source!). Finally, the crowds thin out and
the booths begin to close. Captains and presidents
cling tightly to sign-up sheets, anxious to be the first
to e-mail their group of new recruits. I stand and
watch. Three activities fairs down, one to go. Next

...

Even though porn sites and sex books are replete with images and
info about anal sex, it remains a somewhat taboo subject among most
people
a sad fact considering there is enormous potential for both
genders to experience pleasure and satisfaction from this genre of sexual play. In spite of what many people continue to assume, your female
librarian is just as likely to have had anal sex with her husband as are
the two boys next door, and all of them may have had the most mindblowing orgasms of their lives
during the experience.
The myths surrounding anal
sex are numerous, and mostly
result in a lack of cultural knowledge about the topic. So, before
we go any further, let's look at
what anal sex actually is and
isn't. Thinking something is
"gross" is only a state of mind.
After all, I am willing to bet that
many of you have been putting
your mouths on things other
than lollipops since returning to
campus. So just give it a chance.
Researchers have proven that
SARAH WALSH
the anus is a sexual organ just
like any other
one that is rich
Sex and the Swattie
in nerve endings for both those
with penises and those with vaginas. All parts of the area are
highly sensitive and can even orgasmically contract. The one difference between male and female (I apologize for using gender terms in
this very biological way) anatomies is that men also have a prostate
gland located very near the rectum. At the same time, since very little
separates the anal wall from the vaginal wall, with a little angling of
the dildo/penis/finger, anal stimulation can also produce G-spot
orgasms for women (or, at least, those who can have them).

Thinking something is "gross" is only a
state of mind. After all, I am willing to bet
many of you have been putting your
mouths on things other than lollipops.
If you're interested in anal sex, the first thing you need to do is
make sure your partner is completely into this kind of play as well.
S/he isn't? Buy a book on the subject and read it together. It's possible
that once you and your partner explore ways to have the safest, most
enjoyable experience possible, you will both be more comfortable.
Then, consider these two keys to safe and enjoyable anal sex: protection and lubrication. I cannot stress enough that condoms and LOTS
of lube are absolute necessities. The walls of the rectum are extremely
thin and can tear easily so it is important for them to be wet and protected.

Start small. Do NOT go sticking a strap-on or penis in there right
away or s/he will be in pain. The trick is to relax, and one of best ways
to do this is to relax, breathe and use only small objects in the beginning (e.g. two fingers or a small anal plug, which is a short dildo,
shaped like a mushroom to prevent it from getting ... lost). And please,
for god's sake, masturbate during anal sex, people! It will make the
experience infinitely more enjoyable.
It is a complete fallacy that anal sex will always be painful.
Although some amount of discomfort will probably be experienced by
the receiver (similar to vaginal penetration for the first few times), any
intense pain is a signal that something is wrong. If this happens to you
or your partner, change your motion or level of penetration. Trust me,
if you want to keep enjoying this particular genre of sex, don't let your
enthusiasm accidentally cause your partner to have a traumatic experience.
When many people think ofanal sex play, they automatically think
of, shall we say, dirtiness in the tangible sense. Yet, this is not wholly
correct. Without getting into too much biology, let me just say that in
virtually all cases, things can be squeaky clean. That said, a pre- and
post-sex shower is always a good idea. Plus, since you and/or your
partner will (I hope) be wearing a condom, what's the problem? In
terms of anal play, though, it's most important to just get over your
fear. After all, as Woody Allen put it, "Is sex dirty? Only if it's done
right."

Philly Fringe shows cutting-edge works by Swat alumni

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY DANA SEAY

With hundreds of artistic performances offered over the
course of 16 days, the Philadelphia Fringe Festival may be a
bit overwhelming. If you find yourself stranded amidst the
array of dance, music, theater and other performances, why

not start by checking out the works of some former

Swatties?

Many productions by Swarthmore alumni can be found
in both the Fringe Festival and the Live Arts Festival. This
year, what was formerly the Philadelphia Fringe Festival
has been divided into the Live Arts Festival and the Philly
Fringe. Both are artist-centered festivals and occur at the
same time; the distinction lies in the amount of autonomy
granted to the performers. The Fringe Festival provides
opportunities for artists to produce their own work within
the festival setting, while the Live Arts Festival presents
risk-taking artists in a curated rather than self-produced format.
"Philadelphia comes alive for this festival," said Jon
Stancato 'O2, co-artistic director ofThe Stolen Chair Theatre
Company.
His company's submission in this year's festival, entitled
"Sister Carrie: A Spectacle of Warm-Blooded Humanity,"
embodied the experimental spirit of the Live Arts and
Fringe festivals. The work-in-progress was loosely based on
the first seven chapters of Theodore Dreiser's melodramatic
novel "Sister Carrie." It featured a combination of Dreiser's
dialogue and prose, period music, and Stolen Chair's "trademark physicality," which included everything from a waltz
to the actors breaking into moments of narrative.
Co-artistic director Kiran Rikhye describes her company's work as "traditional storytelling with a twist you've
probably never seen before."
And that, after all, is what the festivals are all about.
Traditional forays into the arts become experimental and
exciting, thriving on the untraditional venues and the giveand-take atmosphere of the events.
This is Stolen Chair's third year in the festival, so the
group is no stranger to the diverse crowd the Live Arts and
Philly Fringe festivals attract.
"Our first year in the festival we drew a large audience of
Swatties," Stancato said. "Then there were the savvy, middle-aged festival goers, other artists and random walkers-by
able to see the show because of its semi-outdoor venue. Some
paid, some didn't."
"Sister Carrie" can be seen Sept. 12 at the National
Museum of American Jewish History in Independence

The Pig Iron Theatre Company's play "Hell Meets Henry Halfway" will run at the Philly Fringe Festival next week.
Stancato is by no means the only former Swattie particifestival. Be sure to check out Pig Iron
Theatre Company's offering, "Hell Meets Henry Halfway," a
black comedy about death and tennis based on Witold
Gombrowicz's "The Possessed." The company was launched
in 1995 when a group of Swarthmore grads fused their talents in the creation of a "dance-clown-theatre ensemble" that
strives to create edgy and exciting performances that defy
categorization. "Hell Meets Henry Halfway" runs Sept. 7-18
pating in this year's

at Plays and Players Theatre. Pig Iron has also performed in
the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where it received the Spirit

of the Fringe award.
The Philadelphia Live Arts Festival presented the U.S.
premiere of international ensemble Saßooge's work
"Fathom," a thought-provoking, original physical theater
piece. A dark tale set against the backdrop of colonial
Tasmania, the exploratory drama raises questions of love,
science and the meaning of humanity. Simon Harding '99, a
Swarthmore theatre studies graduate, provided design and
technical support for "Fathom," which played this week at
Mum Puppettheatre.

Mall.

"Escape!", by Green Chair Dance Group, will be performed by Melinda Lee 'O4, Jumatatu Poe 'O4, Sarah Gladwin
'O5, John Beauregard 'O5 and Hannah de Keijzer 'O6.
Imprisoned by Swarthmore's mantra of liberal eclecticism,
the group explores the meaning of freedom through movement, lifting, lunging, leaping and laughing. It is the first
time that current students are performing the Fringe

Festival.

Finally, see 2004 alums and honors theater majors Felicia
Leicht, Adrienne Mackey and Audrey Pernell perform two
self-directed pieces, "Beloved Prophet" and "Hang Tough,
Martina." "Beloved Prophet" follows a 20-year relationship
between writers Kahlil Gibran and May Ziadah, who never
met in person yet heavily impacted each other's lives
through epistolary correspondence. "Hang Tough, Martina"
follows Martina, an opera diva, as she explores her racial
identity through storytelling, song, and movement rooted in
African and European performance traditions. See these two
works of art on September 15 and 16 at 7 p.m., and on
September 17 and 18 at 8 p.m. at the Print Center on 1614
Latimer Street. Each play runs 65 minutes and costs $5.

"have a dictionary" when you read it, but
your keen instinct for true cognates made
it clear that the plot revolved around a
frisky Andalusian goatherd and the village

Menudo, you deliver a summary of the
oddly sexually explicit tale, rhapsodizing
on the symbolic role of the fife and the
heated tongs. With enyes blazing, you conclude in a Foucauldian flourish. Your
analysis, however, does not meet the appreciative "hmmms" of the newly enlightened,
but only smirks and shifty glances from
students deciding who should tell you that
the story was not titled "Pastures of

Jealous yet? Students lovin' life in spacious New Dorm

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ALYSSA WORK

aworkl@swarthmore.edu

The grass may not be greener at the New Dorm
construction workers are still in the process of landscaping and
dust is the primary groundcover at this point
but the
walls are certainly whiter, the halls cooler and the bathrooms shinier. The modern dorm opened to sophomores,
juniors and seniors last week, and already its residents have
plenty of things to say about life in the New Dorm.
"Physically, it's the nicest to live in, no question," said
Patrick Hart 'O6, who lives in a double in the dorm. "It's
new, and there are kinks to be worked out, but in general
I'm impressed with it."
The airy, L-shaped building contains 75 rooms, including big and small singles, big and small doubles, and six
loft-style doubles on the upper floors, inhabited primarily

by seniors.

Eleanor Forbes 'O5 shares a loft on the upper floor of the
dorm. "You come in on the third floor," she said, "and
there's a pretty wide staircase, and the windows make it
look like the ceiling is opened up. It's nice."
All six lofts are accessible from the third floor where a
smaller lower room leads into a flight of stairs and a larger upper living space. Full-length windows look out on the
campus from the lofts. And for those students not lucky
enough to have a loft, the third-floor lounge has large windows and a balcony.
In addition to the lofts, the dorm's cleanliness is also
one of its major selling points. "There are no mice, no ants,
and there's no puke on the floor yet," Jeff Donlea 'O5 said.
The interior of the dorm is finished, though the building currently lacks a public-sized fridge, a working television and enough sofas. The large first-floor lounge area,
which, unlike the upper two lounges, will not be dry, is

still under construction. Most students, however, are not
bothered by the resulting noise.
"It's only bad if we leave the windows open," Tara
Miller 'O7 said, "and it looks like they're doing a good job,
so I don't mind."
"I'm from New York, so noise is good," Julia Morrison
'O7 said. "It reminds me of home."
Still, the construction does create other small inconveniences, Morrison said, recalling one rainy day when
she got "really muddy" walking through the site to get
back to her room.
But when the sun is out, the New Dorm is the place to
be, due to its status as the only air-conditioned dorm on
campus. Despite rumors, there is air conditioning only in
the hallways and bathrooms. Nonetheless, students still
rave about it.
"It's awesome," Forbes said. "It's really hot in the loft,
but we leave the door open and that lets the A/C blow in."
Despite its many amenities, some residents of the New
Dorm expressed concern that the building doesn't have
much "character" yet.
Morrison coined the word 'Trotter-esque' to describe
her feeling about the dorm. "It doesn't quite seem lived in,"
she said. "Sometimes I feel like I'm walking to my office
instead of walking home."
"Every dorm has its little reputation, and we're still really new," Miller said. "But after the first hall meeting last
night maybe we're starting to create community."
The one element left in truly creating identity
a
is still up in the air. Some students proposed givname
ing the dorm a name that reflected its L-shape; others
wanted to honor 2nd floor RA Joe Raciti by dubbing it

"Racitiland."

Others looked to alumni for inspiration. "Personally, I

think it should be named after Dukakis," Hart said.

Emily Firetog Phoenix Staff

Robert Boostrom 'O5 glories from the first floor of his
coveted loft, the New Dorm's infamous "fishbowl room."
Morrison, however, expressed the more likely idea that
the dorm will remain the New Dorm until someone
donates half of the construction cost, earning him or herself the rights to the dorm's name. Not that students seem
too bothered by living in a nameless dorm: "It's new, it's
clean, and that's enough for me," Forbes said.

For the overworked Swarthmore student

Kyriakopoulos 'O5 said. "The artists and the
artworks showcased are relevant to the contemporary arts scene. It's also just a really

and Saturday and Sunday 1-4 p.m.

without leaving the confines of the college.

The List Gallery
The List Gallery is currently exhibiting
works by three artists, which will be on display until Oct. 3. The works of painter Adele
Kubel are featured in the main gallery, while
the photographs of Jessica Todd Harper and
the prints and books of Mary Phelan are on
display in the Project Room.
Kubel's paintings are simple in subject
matter: a tree trunk, a flower, the sea. Many
paintings are no bigger than the TV Guide
or a Sharpies napkin, and the pictures freely
step out of the boundaries of the paintings
barely any of the works show an entire
object. Instead, Kubel cuts off the tips of a
few flower petals so the flower can exuberantly consume as much of the available
space as possible. She emphasizes this idea
most of her
with big sections of colors

paintings utilize only two or three hues.
What makes Kubel's style distinct is her
emphasis on texture, which she achieves
through a medium of oil paints and
Masonite. Masonite is a hard composition
board made of wood fibers pressed with
heat, according to the visual arts website
noteaccess.com. Kubel works with the
Masonite surface to create ridges, valleys
and canals for the paint to fill, so the surfaces of her paintings pop out into the third

dimension. The visual effect is reminiscent
of the swirls in Van Gogh's "Starry Night"
but is achieved through physical work on
the surface rather than through brushwork.

Oct. 12. Hung on walls and enclosed in glass

urban entropy. His scenes take place in coffee shops or street corners under the glow

Kubel's painting "Single" is one of the works on display through Oct. 3.
The photographs of Jessica Todd Harper
are inspired by Northern European oil
paintings, according to her press release.
Most of Todd Harper's creations are portraits, drawing upon works by Dutch masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt. She
poses her subjects in everyday situations
"Becky with Christopher" (2003) shows two
people lounging in a living room in their
pajamas. Photographs and heirloom oil portraits are casually hung on the walls of Todd

Harper's subjects' rooms, anchoring the

family's history and recalling the very medium she is practicing.
Todd Harper's work is made relevant by
her comment on modern alienation: Many of
her subjects look away from each other. In
"Mom with Becky" (2003), Becky wears a
cold, wide-eyed stare while her mother
caresses her. The artist juxtaposes young
and old, love and separateness to reflect
Americans' dying concept of family life.

from the waiter's derriere cleft, to the doorman's harelip, to a crack in the inspector's
apartment wall. The inspector, in the end,
reverts to apathy regarding all the cracks.

Jake Beckman 'o4's famous oversized
Adirondack chair is still sitting on Parrish
Beach. Since the chair's creation in spring
2002, countless students have climbed onto
its gargantuan whitewashed panels to chat

Swarthmore's most accessible way to experience art.

i'iIIHM;IMI*V,

Jazz: On with the space caps and atomic groove
NASH ADAMSON
Runnin' the Voodoo Down
Ah, the concept: a Phoenix articleabout
a new, independent jazz release, to be followed by an afternoon broadcast of the
music on WSRN. Read on to get the word,
and tune in today to get your reward.

Burton Greene "Live at Grasland"
The line between
contemporary
exploratory jazz and modern classical
music is often blurred, sometimes even
nonexistent. Burton Greene's 2004
Drimala Records release, "Live at
Grasland," playfully jumps between the
two traditions while remaining one of the
most dense and demanding pieces of solo
piano music that has been brought to my
attention. Removing the traditional jazz

rhythm section, Greene plays in the long
tradition of solo jazz piano, largely popularized by Keith Jarrett's ECM recordings
of the mid-19705. Greene, one of the most
experimental pianists of the 1960s free jazz
boom, brings his music in and out of his
self-described "atomic energy music," mixing "classical octave pedalling]" and "ostinati" (short, oft-repeated musical patters)
with traditional jazz and Latin playing.
One of the album's standout pieces is
the first track, Greene's "Calistrophy." It is
the album's most accessible piece but certainly does not lack Greene's trademark
musical styles. The piece begins with a
moderately traditional jazz head, quietly
expanded before drifting into an extended
section of improvisation. While certainly
not in the style of classic jazz, the Latintinged playing eases the listener into the
challenges of the upcoming pieces.
"Calistrophy" ends with a quietly repeated
figure, evoking the same dreamy sound as
many of Jarrett's solo studio recordings.
The album's second cut, "In the
Footsteps of the Bratslav," explores
Greene's devotion to the classical tradition, with a lyrical introduction leading
into an improvisation that contains the
highly theoretical, yet seemingly random,
bursts of notes that characterize much of
modern classical experimentation. The
playing is sparse and hard to follow; the
notes are struck harshly and shortly.
Although this album does not stand as
the most revolutionary work in the current jazz scene, it is a fine recording. The
beauty of a piano going nuts is lost in the

translation between the live performance
and the audio recording, yet there is still
on Greene's selections from
"Grasland" to warrant further listening.

Sun Ra and his Arkestra
"Music From
Tomorrow's World: Chicago 1360"
Altavistie Record's 2002 release of Sun
Ra and his Arkestra's performances at the
Wonderland Inn and at the Majestic Hall is
part of the label's Unheard Music Series.
We'll take at look at the Wonderland set.
Jazz greats Roland Kirk and Stan Getz
would often be found sitting in with Ra's
band. The future founders of the
Association for the Advancement of
Creative Musicians and members of the
Art Ensemble of Chicago could often be
found listening at the inn while John
Coltrane stood aloofly outside.
What these future and current jazz
greats were witnessing was something far
different from the norm for the early 1960s
jazz scene. Ra's music was certainly influenced by the hard bop that was the staple
crowd pleaser of the late 19505, but his
music went far beyond, into his own realm
of space jazz. The traditional suits and ties
of the bebop musician were replaced by
Ra's own "space suits" and "space caps."

Gone was traditional instrumentation,
and, although the band played two traditional tunes, gone was any semblance 6f
the traditional interpretation.
The album's first two tracks, "Angels
and Demons at Play" and "Spontaneous
Simplicity," are two of Ra's own compositions. They're marked by quiet flute playing over clapping percussion and the chatter of the crowd. The Arkestra really gets
cooking on the set's third tune, "Space
Aura." After the cry of "play something" is
heard from a woman in the crowd, a harddriving sax introduction is followed by
John Gilmore's extended saxophone solo
in the same style.
'"S Wonderful" follows. The tune is a
wonderful characterization of traditional
jazz singing and swinging, bebop-influenced jazz soloing. The Arkestra follows
with "It Ain't Necessarily So," a glimpse
into Ra's interpretations of traditional
jazz tunes. Although Ra's albums from
the period often do not include standards,
he still uses the tunes in his live performances. "It Ain't Necessarily So"
begins with a slow, traditional jazz head.
A fierce trumpet solo follows, prompted
by the club's crowd. The Arkestra belts
out the tune, swinging as hard as any
more traditional jazz band.
This is not the best set for showcasing
Ra's Arkestra, and it would not be the first
of his albums that I would pick up. But the
album gives Sun Ra fans an incredible
glimpse into what club dates were like in
the Arkestra's earlyperiod. After listening
through the set, I wanted nothing more
than to order two bourbons and invite
Coltrane to finally take a seat.

World ends, Witherspoon goes British in Sept. flicks
BY MATTHEW TOM
mtoml@swarthmore.edu
Mixed with the blow-'em-up action flicks and cute

romantic comedies of September are some releases that
have been fueled by at least a few brain cells. After all, film
studios begin dumping Oscar contenders onto the masses
this season. Here's hoping that some of these can avoid
panning by critics and audiences alike.

"Vanity Fair" (Sept. 1)
Led by an impeccable

cast of Brits and Reese
of William Makepeace
Thackeray's scathing social satire on eighteenth century
British society is sure to look beautiful, thanks to the keen
eye of director Mira Nair ("Monsoon Wedding," "Salaam
Bombay"). Whether compressing the long, dense novel into
a faithful rendition with a running time of less than three
hours is possible is quite another thing, and reviews have
Witherspoon, this adaptation

been mixed. Some reviewers have complained that Nair and
her screenwriters have butchered Becky Sharpe

(Witherspoon) by turning her into a sympathetic feminist

rather than keeping her essence more faithful to the novel
that is, portraying her as the scheming, opportunistic
anti-heroine Thackeray created. I've liked most of Nair's
past efforts, so I feel obliged to recommend checking this
one out. I have a hunch, though, that although some liberties have been taken with the characters, "Vanity Fair" will
still deliver the goods: sumptuous visuals, flawless acting
and a zeal for bashing the decadence of aristocratic wealth.

"Paper Clips" (Sept. 8, documentary)
Students at Whitwell Middle School in rural
Tennessee are participants in an innovative exercise in
Holocaust education. As an attempt to understand the
scope of the six million Jews murdered due to bigotry
and hatred, the students at Whitwell Middle School

12

decide to collect six million paper clips, each one representing a life lost, by writing letters to people throughout
the world, including survivors of the Holocaust. The subject matter of this documentary should only lure audiences across the country to the movies.

"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (Sept. 17)
A science fiction film that's a throwback to the early
days of science fiction cinema is an interesting idea, but
it's doubtful that such a peculiar concept will draw in the
big bucks. Still, with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude
Law and Angelina Jolie leading the cast, it might just
overcome the oddball nature of its conceptual design.
The movie centers around Paltrow, Law and Jolie
attempting to stop (what else?) an evil mastermind intent
on destroying Earth. Simple plot, yes, but the fusion of
old and new visual styles will certainly make this more
than a routine, by-the-numbers action flick.
The interest factor is the movie's unique production
method. The entire film was shot in front of a blue screen
using digital film, with only the actors and a few small
props present. In addition, the sets and special effects
were painstakingly created by hand on the computer,
and the actors were then inserted into this digital world.

"Head in Clouds" (Sept. 17, limited)
A romantic epic set before and in the midst of World
War 11, "Head in Clouds" stars Charlize Theron, Penelope
Cruz, Stuart Townsend and Thomas Kretschmann.
Theron plays an ambitious fashion photographer living
in Nazi-occupied Paris who befriends a Spanish war
refugee (Cruz) and falls in love with an Irish teacher
(Townsend). No doubt, this one is hoping to achieve
something similar to the effect "The English Patient"
had on audiences, critics and Oscar voters in the mid'9os. It's a formidable task to try to recreate anything
resembling the greatness of that film, but if it comes

"Sky Captain."

close, then Theron should be Oscar bait for the second
year in a row.

"The Forgotten" (Sept. 24)
Starring Julianne Moore, "The Forgotten" tells the
story of a single mother who loses her young son and, in
the process of looking for psychiatric help to ease her emotional pain, discovers that her son may have simply been
a figment of her imagination. With Moore in the lead, this
mystery/thriller shouldn't be a complete turkey, but it
remains to be seen if the script can overcome the leaden
suspense of, say, M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village," and
deliver a sufficient payoff.

MOVIE COMMITTEE

Jy±os\ romantic comedies

do not involve
memory loss, at least not
the experimental,
science-fiction kind, and
at first this movie might
seem most similar to Bill
Murray's "Groundhog
Day." But connoisseurs of
screenwriter Charlie
Kaufman will quickly see
echoes of the wry literary
witticisms from
"Adaptation" and the
mind-in-a-mind sequence
in "Being John Malkovich."
Like these earlier films,
"Sunshine" has a melancholy atmosphere and
like most romantic comedies, the ending is a foregone conclusion. But it's
the trip, the neurotic,
Technicolor-dream trip,
that really makes the film
worth seeing.

Bridging the gap
We're all aware of the Swarthmore bubble. It's an
unavoidable part of living in a school as small as ours,
with so many of our physical and social needs provided
for right outside our dorms. But it's one thing that most
of us rarely make trips to Philadelphia or go on road
trips up and down the East Coast; it's another when the
wall of the bubble blocks out the other Swarthmore

right next to us.
For two communities who have historically been economically and socially dependent on each other in many
ways, Swarthmore College and the borough of
Swarthmore seem to only communicate on the most
superficial levels. The extent of most students' interaction with the Ville residents is ordering pizza and
Chinese food for delivery. And, to be fair, the local businesses usually don't do much to tempt students out of
their insular lifestyles, organizing their opening and closing times on a schedule that mostly ignores the typical
schedule of a college student. Then again, there's a legitimate difference between our lifestyle and theirs: We're
often not aware of the negative impact we can have on
our neighbors until the Swarthmore police department
comes around in response to residents' complaints.
It doesn't have to be that way. The sale of the
Michael's property is a unique opportunity to build a
physical bridge between the campus and the borough. A
small coffee shop that kept late hours would be a source
of far less noise and disruption than the typical campus
party, while providing students a much-needed alternative place to meet, chat and buy food and drink outside
the campus environment. Not only would the proprietors find a ready market of college students willing to
make repeat visits and spend money, but given the right
circumstances it could become a popular meeting place
for Ville residents as well, a place for citizens of the two
Swarthmores to mix and learn about each other.

Unfortunately, students have yet to think of Ville
property as space they share as a community. While
much discussion arose on campus about the closing of

Michael's Pharmacy and the inconvenience this would
cause for students, few students have sought out channels to ask for uses of that property that would benefit
them. Similarly, we students haven't heard many
inquiries from the building's new owners about our
preferences, though many Ville storeowners are quite
curious about them and eager to build a better business
relationship with the student body. There's a lot of
potential for the sale of Michael's to be the beginning of

new, successful venture that revitalizes the stagnant
campus-Ville relationship. For that to happen, though,
members of both communities have to do something we
do far too litle: Talk to each other.

Take real action: Vote John Kerry
BY SCOTT TANNER
stannerl@swarthmore.edu
The political conventions are over, Labor Day 2004 has
just passed, and the Kremlin on the Crum is all quiet.
There seems to be little energy focused on the election 54
days from now. That's not much time and begs me as an
ignorant freshman to ask these questions: Where are all
the political advertisements? Where are the students wearing Kerry-Edwards T-shirts or (to be fair) Bush-Cheney
buttons? Who actually is organizing rallies and debates on
the issues? How many Swatties are going into Chester to
register people to vote, or to phone banks to talk to unde-

cided voters?

I have been at Swarthmore for more than two weeks and
have only seen a few political signs. There are those "Beat
Bush" job advertisements around, but that's only an organization that needs workers. I do not understand why there is
not more political activism going on, especially here on this
campus, in perhaps the most crucial time of our lives.
I know that our campus is not ignorant to what's going
on. I do not need to give a summary of major news events
over the past four years. It's just that college students do
not care enough about the outcome of an election to try to
do something to affect it. Only 23 percent of college students voted in the 2000 election. And that is what makes me
nervous. It is our solemn duty as lovers of freedom, democracy and human rights to do all we can to ensure a more
perfect and just union.
It's not so much ignorance about politics that I'm worried about; it's the lack of engagement that has swallowed
many college students. It seems that those in the younger
generationhave their opinions, yet do not participate in the
political process. I am bothered by anyone who has an opin-

ion on a certain topic but never does anything about it. In

his "Essay on Civil Disobedience," Thoreau writes, "There
are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to
the war [in Mexico], who yet in effect do nothing to put an
end to them; who
sit down withtheir hands in their pockets, and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing."
...

Many of the campus groups have their opinions and
popularize their opinions around campus and elsewhere
but in effect do nothing. I will address some of the more
notable groups. SQJJ, where are you? The Republican Party
has made the proposed constitutional amendment banning
same-sex marriage part of their platform. Fight it by fighting the enactor of the agenda. Fight Bush and get John
Kerry

elected.

Amnesty

International: Meet Abu Ghraib.

Meet Guantanamo Bay. Get the abuses stopped. Get John
Kerry elected. Earthlust: Remember the Kyoto treaty. Get it
enacted by getting Kerry elected.
For the next two months, the best way to accomplish
many of the noble goals of all these organizations on camget immersed
in mainstream
pus is to get involved
politics. And I don't mean just voting. Voting is enough to
get you a D. The real work, the real cause, the real change
is to get others to vote and for the right person. Because
when enough people vote in the name of peace, of justice,
there will be a new government, one run by those who sympathize with all of Swarthmore's progressive causes.
So here is what we must all do. Let your support of
Kerry be visible. Write an op-ed piece and submit it to as
many newspapers as you can. Work on a campaign. Help
staff a phone bank. Help get out the vote. Most important-

ly, register voters. The margins in Pennsylvania are small.
Every vote counts.
So instead of just talking about issues, let us focus our
strength and time on the one goal that needs to be
achieved: to get John Kerry elected. For if we fail, the conperhaps deadly.
sequences could be dire

Swat Meets World

Feeling festive? You
should be. September is
International
Square
Dance Month, National Bed
Check Month, National
Chicken Month and my
personal favorite, Be Kind
to Editors and Writers
Month. But the best is still
in store: This September
Department
the
of
Homeland Security (DHS)
will kick off the first-ever
National
Preparedness
Month. The American Red
Cross, Starbucks and
the unbiased
hmmm
folks at the National

Association
of
Broadcasters will sponsor a series of "national safety"
events designed to whip Americans' terrorist-attack-

response skills into gear.

"Disaster preparation" teach-ins will be held across
the country, for families and businesses alike.
(Conveniently, no mention of actual disaster prevention
is made in any of the promotional materials.) Basic steps
include developing a family communication plan ("Hey
Grandma, there's a terrorist on the lawn!") and learning
the specifics of reporting suspect characters to the proper authorities ("Hey officer, there's a terrorist on the
lawn!"). Preparedness Month also launches the promotion of DHS's Ready Kit Plus, which should enable families to survive for three days under emergency circumstances. The Kit includes a poncho, an N95 Mask, several 2,400-calorie food bars (no need to abandon the diet
under threat of nuclear holocaust), a utility wrench and
a package of moist towelettes, all for only $49.95. After
the government has spent billions of taxpayer dollars on
Preparedness 101, the least you can do is shell out a fifty.
Like the highly successful "Duck and Cover" campaigns of the 19505, National Preparedness Month
includes a Ready For Kids component, ensuring that, in
case of a terrorist attack or large-scale nuclear explosion,
fourth-graders will exit the school in an orderly fashion.
According to the DHS's homepage, the Ready For Kids
project will also include a "huge campaign of television
advertisements" urging schools to develop site-specific
terrorist response plans and eliminate hazardous mate-

rials. Calling all youth of the post-DARE generation: It's
time to Just Say No to terrorism (and staple guns).
The festivities are by no means limited to kiddies.
According to DHS honcho Tom Ridge, journalists function as a crucial part of the Preparedness Plan. This past
August, I attended the "News and Terrorism:
Communicating in a Crisis" conference, hosted by Ridge.
The event kicked off a year of DHS counterterrorism
workshops for journalists in 10 major cities. Ridge promised the press a "detailed playbook," providing reporters
with the strategies and (government-affiliated) contacts
needed to deal with a terrorist scenario. "A consistent
seconds
message to the public is critical," Ridge said
after lauding the glorious freedoms for which America is
famous. The route to press Preparedness is plain: Spout
the line the feds have fed you, and you're in the clear.
But wait
once September's over, will Preparedness
fall by the wayside, like so many Square Dances, Bed
Checks and Chickens in years past? Worry not. In April,
Connecticut and New Jersey will witness the DHS's
Top Off 3 campaign, the largest-yet terrorist-attack simulation. Governmental organizations and businesses will
be called upon to respond to a series of simulated WMD
incidents described by the DHS as "round-the-clock exercise play." The DHS asserts that the simulations will help
the nation "prevent, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks." Yet the department never articulates what,
exactly, it means to be prepared for a terrorist attack,
other than complying with governmental mandate.
All this adds up to a curious conclusion: maybe "preparedness" is not the point of the September hullabaloo.
The DHS launches Preparedness Month today, Sept. 9.
Why not Sept. 1? One sneaky motive suggests itself: the
proximity to Sept. 11 News about Preparedness Month
will likely mingle with emotional anniversary coverage,
bringing positive attention to President Bush, who
counts the War Against Terror as the only area in which
most Americans approve of his efforts.
So is National Preparedness Month simply another
now-you're-scared-so-vote-for-me Bush Administration
tactic? Time will tell. But it seems that Americans might
be wise to "prepare" in a couple of ways that the DHS
doesn't suggest: Listen critically and think. Even in the
event of a National Disaster, a brain comes in more
handy than all the ponchos, food bars and moist towelettes in the world.

more than ever to stump for the candidates of their choice. For
celebrities to come out of the woodwork in an election year,
however, is an exercise in arrogance and irresponsibility.
Celebrities' fame should in no way hinder their freedom of
speech. Yet by that same accord, fame ought not be a tool for
amplifying the political ramifications of any single person's
opinions. The general public puts an irrational trust in
Hollywood celebrities. Though grounded solely in their acting
abilities, this trust can be used as a tool for the political manipulation of the movie-going voting public. Democracy is well
served by individuals' voting for candidates based on political
views, not the endorsements of A-list celebrities.
Regardless of whom they know in the political realm,
celebrities read the same newspapers as the rest of the country.
The primary difference between their livesand ours, however,
is that they live in what is essentially an isolated dream world.
It is hard to imagine that between the glamorous parties, posh
charity events and casual globetrotting that these people could
have any real sense of the issues that affect the ordinary public.
Regardless of his impressive performance as President Jeb
Bartlett on the West Wing, Martin Sheen has spent the last forty
years in this dream world. Yet his political activism influences
the opinions of ignorant voters who, based on a television show,
would like to see him make a real run for the White House.
Not only are celebrities poor political role models, but they
also come from an environment that tends to breed poor personal role models. Can we really expect a community that has
historically demonstrated questionable family values, drug use
and violence to light the way to a better political future?
Whoopi Goldberg recently took the stage at a Kerry fundraiser
and, rather than advocate Kerry's proposed policies, used her
time to draw an analogy between President Bush's name and a
certain part of the female anatomy. It is a scary thought that
voters may actually be influenced by such a lewd comic reference devoid of any substantial content.
Finally, by muddling the performing arts with politics,
celebrities have isolated certain segments of the audience that
helped them achieve such status in the first place. Bruce
Springsteen, Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam and REM are all
playing nearby concerts in the upcoming weeks. Though I am
a fan of all of these groups, I am discouraged from attending the
events because they are being marketed not as rock concerts
but as political events advocating the removal of President
Bush from the White House.
To be fair, this is not a partisan problem. Ted Nugent, Kid
Rock, Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears are among the
guilty celebrities on the other side of the aisle. Nor is this a new
problem. During the Vietnam War, Jane Fonda traveled to
North Vietnam, meeting with the United States' Communist
enemies and posing for photographs atop a gun used to kill
American pilots. Would the attention given to "Hanoi Jane"
have been so great if not for her celebrity status?
Celebrities have every right to political advocacy concerning the issues in which they are involved. But for these individuals to use their fame to manipulate voters away from making rational, educated voting decisions is unconscionable. It is
a sad thought that I might never again be able to see Bruce
Springsteen without having to make my own de facto political
statement.

Why Democrats can't be patriots in the war on terror

that U.S. Special Forces

war against terrorism: The more we Americans win it,
the more we Democrats lose. It's an infuriating paradox that
has led many a friend to tell me that they secretly hope for
more beheadings in Iraq and for elections to fail in our newly
occupied territories. They start violently at their own "antiAmericanism," and rightly so.
The logic, you see, is straightforward. If our troops do poorly, if the insurgents do well, if Osama reestablishes himself, if
the terrorists somehow demonstrate Homeland Security a
farce, then George Bush will appear inept and lose. If the
United States prevails, George Bush will look strong and win.
In other words, don't kid yourself. Any Democrat who
claims that it is possible to be anti-Bush and yet "support the
troops" is either deluded or disingenuous, insofar as those
troops' successes and failures are publicized in America. The
president cannot succeed if the armed forces fail.
This crisis of patriotism is distressing for everyone who
experiences it. It feels dirty and immoral to hope that the
worst befalls us and our compatriots. But perhaps it isn't.
Perhaps we need to begin owning our feelings, not whitewashby the

ing them.
First in the former Yugoslavia and now in Iraq, the United
States has disregarded state sovereignty, going to war for reasons beyond internationally accepted self-defense. In Iraq the
issue is hairy, but most everyone agrees that in Kosovo we
were right to intervene to stop a genocide. Respecting the
sacrosanct, nebulous concept of the state was less important
than the foul consequences of doing otherwise.
Perhaps the same is true right here at home. Perhaps patriotismis an outdated concept
an unworthy emotional vestige
of our evolutionary heritage, reinforced by the culture of a

selfish state. I am lost for an argument as to why I should support the instruments of a regime whose policies do more harm
than good
even while I say to those instruments, our troops,
that I'm sad they must die. There is more at stake this election
than our short-term success in Iraq: the growth of "Islamism,"
our alliances, our schools, our healthcare, our environment.
All of these have real consequences for real lives.
You may not like this point of view. Maybe you think patriotism is just intrinsically honorable, period, or thatBush has
done more good things than bad, in which case I bid you a
respectful good day. Maybe you think it's wrong to conflate the
Bush regime with our troops, in which case I say that mine is
not a question of one's attitude toward the soldiers because
I hold their lives and sacrifices in high regard too but rather

what one actually hopes will happen to them in the real world.

It makes no sense to hope that until Nov. 2 they succeed (for
their sakes) and fail (for the country's and the world's).
And maybe you think that it's self-apparently stupid to

hope for failure in Iraq, because we are already there and cannot get out until we make amends. For the long term I agree.
But to hope for long-term success, both in Iraq and in all the
other policy decisions that matter, is to be forced into quiet
treason right now
of which it is of no use to be ashamed.
Until the day comes when the nation's rash obsession with
patriotism in political decisions has dissipated, opposition
parties in wartime will continue to have an unduly tough
uphill slog. Perhaps that day will come a little bit faster if we
liberals can snap out of our delusion, own our paradox and

declare patriotism dead.

iunter Bandy 'O7
As the educational policy representative, I will urge the
urriculum Committee to devise a long-term plan for building
nd sustaining an Arabic language program under the modern
mguages and literatures department. The growing number of

ri-Co students who must commute to the University of
ennsylvania to take upper level Arabic classes and those who
tudy abroad in Arabic-speaking countries indicate the necesity for departmental expansion. With the recent hirings of
liddle-East specialists in the political science and history
epartments and an Andrew W. Mellon grant awarded to the
ollege to build its Islamic Studies program, the college must
scognize the immediate need to expand its current two-year
.rabic program into a fully funded four-year program,
dequate Arabic comprehension among students helps to genrate more qualified perspectives on the Middle East. The
Curriculum Committee also needs to reexamine the current
iculty review processes, and possibly even standardize these
rocesses across all departments. I would also like to devise a
lore thorough course review forum available to students
nline. Finally, since many students are unaware of departlental plans concerning future expansion and course develpments, another of my goals is to make educational policy
nd curriculum decisions more transparent to the student
ody. These were my goals when I ran for this office last
pring; I still feel that I can achieve them. Also, I will not be
oing abroad or taking the spring semester off, so a vote for me
i a vote for not having another special election before the gen-

ral election.

Why am I running for educational policy representative?
or one, I really would like to have some input on educationl policy issues. Swarthmore's intellectual environment is the
ling that makes us special, and even if there aren't any major
hanges that need to be made, I would like to give input on
nprovements to the curriculum. I have already thought
bout educational policy issues a lot on my own, since I have
ften agonized over picking my own classes. From that, I have
Dmetimes wondered whether policy changes would make it
asier to find the best courses, and I have also noticed certain
olicies that aren't necessarily the best. In addition, I have a
ariety of interests academically, primarily in biology, psyhology, and history. This means that I am familiar with the
urriculum in those and many other areas, and I think that
rould help me provide useful input on curriculum issues,
inally, I am very interested in the history of Swarthmore,
nd I think this also would help me fully understand what
hould be done to keep Swarthmore a leader in the academic

rorld.

educational policy representative would be to revive the class

recommendation book. This is really a useful and important
tool for class selection, and it should not have been allowed to
stagnate the way it has.

Alex Ginsberg 'OB

Brothers and Sisters of Swarthmore! I am Alex Ginsberg, a
candidate for the position of educational policy representative. I come to you with lots of fresh ideas and motivation to
make your Academic life a little easier.
Over the last week, I have been talking to students, asking
what I can do for them as educational policy representative.
The truth is, most students have no clue what I could do in
that position, and that is a travesty.
Once elected, I hope to bring energy to this office by
immersing myself in the needs of my fellow Swatties. As the
educational policy representative, I will fulfill my duty of
attending policy council meetings and curriculum meetings.

But I will go beyond the call of duty by trying to bring about
much needed reform. You've probably heard of the class recommendation book, but it's unlikely that you were able to use
it with much success. One of my friends used a recommendation from that book, went to his first day expecting a "5 of 5"
professor, and wound up in a hell-class. NO MORE! Over the
next year I will ensure that every professor and class in that
book is rated by at least 15 students. Furthermore, I believe
that advisors should be rated as well, for a professor can be
great in class and a bum in the office, and everyone deserves
a competent advisor. With these and many other ideas, I know
that I can add definition to the role of the Educational Policy
Representative in your minds, because I will not rest until my
goals, and yours, are achieved.
Please e-mail aginsbel@swarthmore.edu if you have any
questions to ask, issues to broach, or support to give.

1, Caitlin "Cat" Hildebrand, propose the following changes:
L A recognition system that announces outstanding stu-

dents each semester, based on a traditional Dean's List. This

is particularly important for course majors who excel in their
studies (all B+s or above for that particular semester). "Dean's
List Fall 2004," would show on transcripts.
2. New CR/NC options.
A: Departments should allow students to take classes within their major, but not required by their major, for CR/NC, to
allow them to learn more in their field withhold unnecessary

effort.

B: If a student decides to change from CR/NC to letter
should not lose that CR/NC option, but keep it for

grade, they

September 9, 2004

C: When a student has declared a course for a letter grade,
they should be able to change it to CR/NC up until three-quarters of the way through the semester. This ensures that when
a student finds themselves over-burdened by work they do not
jeopardize their academic standing.
3. Create a direct complaint form that allows students to
report a problem student to a professor in a systematic way.
For example, if a student is disturbing class-flow by monopolizing discussion time, a classmate can log a complaint with
the professor, who than can then take action if they deem it
necessary.

4. Create a course option within most majors which gives
students work-study credit or practicum credit. For example,
economics majors who are interested in banking should
receive academic credit for working in their field.
Thank you!

Rasa Petrauskaite 'OB
I would like to contribute to Swarthmore as a whole by
providing for more interaction between the students and the
student council.
I am running for the educational policy representative of
the Swarthmore student council so that I can create an interactive web-page where Swarthmore students can write comments to the student council about any campus issues and
where each month the student council posts simple multiple-

choice questions addressing each issue mentioned by the
students on the web-page.
I am really excited about helping the student council
become more organized and interactive with students. I
think that getting feedback from students is important for
the council in its mission to help students. Finding out what
is important to them and doing something about it are integral to the mission of the student government.
The education policy representative post ties in with this
initiative because this web-page would allow students to
communicate their remarks and suggestions regarding academics directly to the student council. Then, as an education
policy representative, I would communicate these concerns
and

Hood who? The history of the trophy
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Ask a Swarthmore student about the Hood Trophy
and.chances are, you will find he or she doesn'tknow what
it is. On the other hand, if you ask a Haverford student
about the Hood Trophy, you are likely to get an earful.
The Haverford student might even mention that the
Fords have won the trophy every year since 1995. Is
this why Swat fans and athletes are clueless? Or
do we just not care?
Haverford fans, in sharp contrast to
Swat fans, are not merely indifferent
to the rivalry. Just check out the
busloads of Haverford fans that
swarm our

campus

Each Haverford-Swarthmore athletic contest is given a
point value and the school with the most points at the end
of the year wins the trophy. Participating sports include
men's and women's cross country, men's and women's soccer, volleyball, field hockey, men's and women's indoor

inscription, "Given in memory of Albert L. Hood Jr., by
his friends of Swarthmore and Haverford colleges." The
names of the two colleges are engraved on the tray on
which the bowl sits. During the 1995-1996 season,
Swarthmore emerged victorious in the trophy race 9-8.
This was the last time that Swat took home the trophy.
Last year, Swarthmore lost to the Fords 10.5-7.5 in the trophy race. "Haverford has certainly gone after [the
Hood Trophy] more than we have," Sport
Information Director Mark Duzenski said. "I
don't think the Hood Trophy is something we strive for as a department."

Haverford Associate Athletic
Director John Douglas, believes
that the Hood Trophy is more
widely known at Haverford
because of Haverford's athletic
director,

Field hockey still undefeated
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

Watch out.

That's the message the Swarthmore field hockey
team has sent to fellow Centennial Conference teams
during the first week of the season. With a perfect 3-0
start, the Garnet seems intent on attaining a berth in
the conference championship game.
Saturday, the team came away with a victory over
Goucher, winning 7-1 behind a hat trick from Lindsay
Roth 'O7. Tuesday, the Garnet took on Notre Dame at
home and escaped with a closer victory of 5-3.
Notre Dame was 0-1 on the season, but the Garnet
knew it would not be an easy opponent. "We knew
that they would be physical," coach Kelly Wilcox said.
Wilcox said the team's goal was to be the first to the
ball so it could play a possession game. The plan
worked out well, as Swarthmore kept the ball on the
Notre Dame side of the field for much of the game.
Swarthmore came out strong and put pressure on
the Notre Dame goalie right away. Chelsea Ferrell 'O5
started the scoring drive for the Garnet when she tallied on a corner seven minutes into the match.
Minutes later, Roth led another attack, but after dribbling through two Gators defenders was unable to finish the play.
After a couple of close calls on the Swarthmore
end, Notre Dame scored its first goal. Shortly after,

September 9, 2004

they took a 2-1 lead on an open shot that prompted the
Garnet to call a timeoutand talk things over.
The strategy worked, as Swarthmore immediately
went on the offensive, hitting the post less than a
minute later and then tying the game on a successful
Katherine Athanasiades 'O5 penalty shot. Neema Patel
'O7 gave the Garnet the lead again at 8:28, banking the
ball into the back of the net after the Notre Dame
goalie had come out to contest the play.
Swarthmore went up 4-2 on a goal by Emily
Szydlowski 'O5 with 2:28 left before halftime, but the
Gators were able to score on the last play of the half to
come within one goal of the Garnet.

That is as close as Notre Dame would get, as
Swarthmore opened up the half with a goal by Julia
Lindenberg 'O5 four minutes in. Swat continued to
pressure the Notre Dame net for the rest of the game
while holding off a few scoring chances by the
Gators. A takeaway by Summer Spicer 'O7 on
defense and a few impressive stops by goalie Karen
Lorang 'O7 in the last minute secured the win and a
perfect record for the Garnet.
Co-captains

Athanasiades and

Szydlowski

were

happy with their team's performance and excited for
the rest of the season. "We've never looked this good
at this point in the season before," Athanasiades said.
"I think we're going to surprise a lot of people,"
Szydlowski said. If the last week is any indication, the
conference will have to start taking notice soon.

Over the past several years, this debate has intensified
as more and more collegiate basketball players have
jumped to the NBA after only one or two years in school.
More recently, the attempts of Ohio State running back
Maurice Clarett and USC wide-out Mike Williams to go
pro after their freshmen years in college has only added
fuel to the fire raging over collegiate eligibility.
These incidents have raised serious ethical issues
about NCAA athletics. People question the value of the
education received by players who jump early to the pros,
as well as the validity of the majors of serious collegiate
athletes who are rarely seen in class. All of this points to a
