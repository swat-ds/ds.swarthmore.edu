Math prof behind 'A Beautiful Mind' speaks
could have used to daunt a multivariable calculus class,
and what equations he could have created during his bouts

BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

who has seen the movie "A Beautiful Mind"
probably remembers this scene: John Nash, played by
Russell Crowe, begins scribbling in chalk on his dorm
room window upon arriving at Princeton as a graduate
student. As complicated equations and graphs begin to
emerge over the glass, the camera zooms in to give the
audience a close up look of a true mathematician's hand.
That hand is not Russell Crowe's. It belongs to David
Bayer '77, a Columbia University mathematics professor
and mathematics consultant for "A Beautiful Mind."
Tuesday afternoon, in a lecture peppered with behind-thescenes anecdotes, Bayer related how he had synthesized
his mathematical knowledge, experience and imagination
to help produce the mathematical elements in the
Anyone

Academy Award-winning movie.

"I was like the roving president's
dog. I was allowed in every office."
David Bayer '77
Bayer got the chance to join the project when director
Ron Howard read his review of "Proof," a Pulitzer Prizewinning play about a mentally ill mathematician and his
family. Bayer said Howard had invited him to join the pro-

duction team because he needed someone who would enjoy
the filmmaking process.
Howard was also looking for someone with flexibility
and creativity. In his role as mathematics consultant,
Bayer had to produce what Nash could have written on
library windows as a graduate student, what problem he

of schizophrenia.
"What Swarthmore is about is it gives you ideas from
many different points of view," he said. "I really thought
coming in from Swarthmore gave me a good preparation
for what I was about to do."
Bayer spoke about the effort he had made to produce
mathematics that would convince his most skeptical colleagues. After showing a one second-long shot of an equation-filled windowpane, Bayer proceeded to explain the
whole morning of work that had gone into filling up the
full-length window with calculations that would resemble
the three-day-long work of John Nash.
Bayer also had an explanation for the o<n<l image that
appeared in some promotional posters for the movie. The
equation came from one of Nash's papers, in which he
used all of the letters in the Greek alphabet for his variables. In doing so, he used n as just another variable,
instead of the approximate value of 3.1415926 that it is usually taken to represent.
As an integral part of the production crew, Bayer had
the chance to work closely with a variety of talented people. "I was like the roving president's dog," he joked, patting himself on the head. "I was allowed in every office."
Between cracking jokes with Russell Crowe and coaching

another actor on math lingo, Bayer said, he noticed that
everyone had different strengths and how all these talents
came together to produce the film.
Such strengths included the unexpected similarity
between Bayer's handwriting and that of Crowe. Since
their hands also resembled each other, Bayer was asked to
literally lend a hand when Crowe was not available for the

disembodied shot.
Bayer also had one line near the end of the movie, playing a professor who offers his pen to Nash as a traditional
gesture of respect and acceptance.

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

David Bayer was a mathematics consultant for the
Academy Award-winning "A Beautiful Mind."
The presentation was sponsored by the department of
mathematics and statistics as a part of the annual Arnold
Dresden lecture series. The series consists of two talks, the
first "to be accessible to the wider college community,"
according to the department's Web site, and the second "a
slightly more technical talk, though still aimed at the
undergraduate level."

Islamic cultural studies program lags
Assortment of Islam-related classes not yet a minor; Arabic language professor to teach next year
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

Six years after the college first considered adding a minor in Islamic studies,
the program's status is still indefinite.
The Phoenix in 1997 reported that the
Council on Educational Policy (CEP) had
looked into over 150 possible new majors
and minors, including Islamic studies.
The council was expected to endorse the
creation of minors in Islamic studies, cognitive science and film and media studies.
In 1998, the CEP approved a proposal
from the religion department to hire a
tenure-track professor specializing in
Islam. The college then made it a goal of
the capital campaign, which began in 1999,
to fund an Islamic studies professor.
Little progress was made until Sept. 11,
when the college pushed for the hiring of
the new position.
"Sept. 11 gave urgency to this priority,
and the board approved making an
appointment even before the funding for it
had been raised," Provost Connie
Hungerford said in an interview this
week.
Two years before this resolution, facing
the large potential expense of hiring a new
tenure-track professor, the religion
department hired Scott Kugle '9l, the second post-doctoral Mellon fellow the college
had hired to teach about Islam. Mellon fellowships go to young professors whose
presence broadens the curriculum at a liberal arts college.

Professor Kugle is now "the anchor for

THE PHOENIX

contributions from several other people in

other departments" for Islamic cultural
studies, Hungerford said.
The Islamic studies program "has been
an ongoing push for the department since
the Gulf War in 1991," Kugle told The
Phoenix in 200 L "It's kind of sad that these

efforts are always punctuated by wars, but
that's the way breakthroughs are made."
Kugle said there had been "a conversation then about how it was a lack in the
college in general and in the religion cur-

inspired her to become a history major
concentrating on the Middle East. She also
said Turner provides instruction in the
often ignored areas of Iran and its language, Farsi.

Swarthmore is hiring a new professor
next year to teach Arabic. Yaghoubi said
she was "extremely happy that they are
finally going to be hiring a professor from
Penn next year to teach Arabic, though
this step came way too late, in my opinion.
And this professor would only teach first-

riculum in particular." Ten years ago, he

explained, Islamic studies were limited to
"a couple of courses in the religion department," which visiting professors taught.
Despite
Kugle's
appointment,
Hungerford said she "wouldn't say that
there is presently a formally defined program. I don't know that there was a specific mandate to develop an Islamic concentration, although that may well happen."
Professors whose courses count toward
a minor in Islamic cultural studies
include Farha Ghannam of the sociology
and anthropology department, Stephen
Bensch and John Turner of the history
department, Kugle and five professors

from Bryn Mawr and Haverford.
There is no tenured position in the history department that could enable Turner
to teach Middle Eastern classes permanently. Still Jawaad Houssain 'O5 gave his
professor good reviews. "I'll tell you
straight off the bat: Professor John Turner
is an excellent prof," he said.
Roxanne Yaghoubi 'O5 said he'd

"I don't know that there
was a specific mandate to
develop an Islamic concentration, although that may
well happen."

Hungerford
year Arabic, which still leaves problems

for those in levels beyond."
Kugle currently teaches a class entitled
Arabic for Text Study, which functions as
an introduction to the modern Arabic language. Saed Atshan 'O6 also instructed a
group of interested students in a not-forcredit Arabic class, but the class disbanded earlier this semester.
Since the CEP review, the film and
media studies program has developed a

April 24, 2003

course and honors minor and a special
major. No such development has taken

place for the newer Islamic program.
Interdisciplinary programs are created
"when faculty are interested in establishing [them]," Connie Hungerford said in a
2001 interview.
With the help of a grant from the
William J. Cooper Foundation, professors
including Ghannam, Kugle and Turner
have organized an Islamic lecture and film
series. The Modern Iranian, Arab and

Israeli Cinema series includes five feature
films about political and social issues. The
recent Global Islams lecture series has
brought professors from several universities to talk about the varying roles Islam
plays worldwide.
Carla Humud 'O5 said the current state
of Islamic studies at Swarthmore was
"frustrating, because I wanted to study the
Middle East. I didn't realize I was going to
have to postpone it for four years. Luckily,
Professor Turner was here." She currently
supplements Swarthmore offerings with
Arabic classes at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Yaghoubi said in an interview that
there is a need for the program to grow. "If
Swat wants to continue to educate students so that they can serve the world and
encourage peace and diplomacy, then it
must continue to have lots of offerings in
Middle East studies," she said. "To expect
students interested in Islamic studies to
have to go to Penn or go abroad just to

take even the simplest introductory courses in the subject is absurd."

international dance festival.

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

The Fulbright program, designed to promote mutual
understanding between Americans and people overseas,
awards research fellowships abroad to graduating seniors. The 1,005 students nationwide who were chosen as
Fulbright fellows receive varying amounts of funding
from the United States Department of State, depending
on several factors such as round-trip transportation,
maintenance, health insurance and research allowances.
Campbell, a comparative literature major and
German minor, will study the representation of female
bodies in Polish women's magazines from 1946 to the
present. She hopes to discover how representations of
women intersect with political and social ideology
changes. She intends to determine how "the changes in
the magazines relate to women's experiences and their
changing sense of identity in communist and post-communist Poland," she said in a press release.
Campbell said she was "primarily interested in
Germany" but that, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, there
had been an intellectual movement in Germany toward
studying Eastern European countries to which they were
"intrinsically linked." Campbell's plan includes comparing the Polish and German women's magazines.
As a culmination to her study, Campbell will teach a
class as a part of a seminar offered by the head of the
UNESCO Board of Women and the Media. Campbell will
also write a scholastic paper for publication. After she
returns from Poland, Campbell will pursue a Ph.D. in
German literature at Princeton.
Cartmill is also headed to Poland, but the similarities
between her work and Campbell's end there. Cartmill is
a linguistics major with a double minor in biology and
theater, and she is using the award to further examine

Her Polish is functional enough for her to conduct all
of her interviews without a translator, she said, but she
will use editors for the papers she plans to publish in
Poland's national arts magazine.
The mixture of dance and theater appeals to Cartmill.
She described it as "part modern dance, part avant-garde
physical theater" and is planning to study it as an art
form and cultural phenomenon. "I'm interested in it as a
newly emerging national political art form and a unique
representation of Poland's culture at the moment," she
said. Her work will include creating a video archive of
performances and consolidating information from individual dance and theater companies that contributed to
the "covergent evolution" of Polish dance theater.
Smith will travel to Cachan, France, where she will
conduct experimental quantum optics physics research
at the Ecole Normale Superieure. She is familiar with
this school, since she spent last July there conducting
research on single-molecule fluorescence of organic
dyes. "It was intense," she said in a press release. "In two
weeks, I learned confocal microscopy techniques to
study dyes," at the same time learning to speak French.
Smith began her research in confocal microscopy during summer research with physics professor Carl
Grossman. While Grossman studied dyes in bulk,
Smith's was able to study single molecules in France. "It
turns out that they match," Smith said.
Next year, Smith, a physics major and mathematics
minor, will continue her study of optical detection of
individual spins in single nitrogen vacancy color centers
of diamond nanocrystals. After returning from France,
Smith hopes to study applied mathematics at Cambridge
University and eventually pursue a Ph.D. in physics.

SC candidates debate
BY ARTHUR CHU

achul@swarthmore.edu
At the debate between co-presidential candidates last
night, someone asked Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, "If you
had been organizing this event, what would you have
done differently so it wouldn't have turned out like this?"
Rodriguez replied, "It comes down to organization.
Let's say your name is Ryan Budish, and you're working
on a paper. You should be organized enough to remember
that at 5:25 you should be getting down to Sharpies."
Because of this delay and the lack of microphones in
a noisy environment, the Student Council co-presidential
debate at the Sharpies condiment bar was poorly attended. Nonetheless, an interested crowd, including former
co-presidents, gathered to questions of the two candidates, Rodriguez and Robert Berman 'O4, moderated by
current co-president Ryan Budish 'O4.
Budish began by asking what about Swarthmore the
candidates would most like to change given the chance.
Rodriguez emphasized giving SC a more active agenda
independent of the administration, "proactive, not reactive," and cited examples of his own work as student
events advisor this semester. Berman planned to make
Student Council more representative of the student body,
working more with student groups and seeing his role as
co-president as "taking and presenting students' ideas."
Afterwards, the two candidates fielded questions from
the audience. Matt Rubin 'O3 challenged Rodriguez's
assertion that his work as student events advisor had
been proactive, to which Rodriguez jokingly replied,
"Our one semester has had more success than your

whole year, Matt Rubin."
On a more serious note, both candidates described
their problems with the large-scale events committee.
Berman said, "The process needs to start earlier, in
September, if not earlier," and Rodriguez called for a
"more student-oriented committee." The candidates also
described their mutual desire to reform the funding system for club sports.

'Fighting over a piece of land'
Zionist student group brings historian to lecture on origins of Israel-Palestine conflict
ELIZABETH BUCKNER
ebucknel@swarthmore.edu
After living

in Israel, traveling
extensively in the Palestinian territories and talking to refugees and Israeli
settlers, Jonathan Schanzer came to
understand the Israel-Palestine conflict as fundamentally a territorial dispute.
"It's two sides fighting over a piece
of land," he said, as he addressed a
crowd of about 30 on Monday evening
in the Scheuer Room.
Schanzer, who was asked to speak
by Im Tirtzu Zionists for a Two State
-

Solution, offered a brief history of the
Middle East and the background
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Starting in
1256 8.C., with the settlement of Jews
in Palestine, he summarized thousands of years of history in a 40-minute
talk.
Im Tirtzu member Aviva AronDine 'O5 said the organization had
brought Schanzer to help students
understand the historical context of
the conflict. "We felt there was a lot of
interest on campus about understand-

ing the basic history of the Middle
East," she said. The group also felt it
was important to bring a politically
neutral speaker. "Some people on campus have strong opinions, but we wanted to give students without strong
opinions a chance to learn and reflect
on the issues themselves," she said.
Schanzer described the Old City of

Jerusalem as a microcosm of the land

dispute in Israel. Within the Dome of

the Rock mosque, where Muslims
believe Mohammed rose to heaven,
lies the rock on which, according to
Jewish scripture, Abraham attempted
to sacrifice his son Isaac to God. As a
result, the rock is considered the holiest site for Jews and the third holiest
site for Muslims.

Michelle Crouch 'O6 said she found
the talk "really interesting and informative. It's not a subject I have a lot of
background in, but I wanted to learn
about it because of its international
significance," she said.

Im Tirtzu is Hebrew for "if you
will it." This quote is a reference to
the work of Theodore Herzl, the
visionary behind the Zionist movement. The group believes strongly in
Israel's right to exist securely as a
nation but is also committed to peace,
which it envisions as a two-state solution. Diana Aronzon 'O5, Xan Fishman
'O5, Ryan Budish 'O4 and Aron-Dine
created the group last year. With a
current roster of six to eight active
members, Im Tirtzu has brought
speakers, former political leaders and
Israeli students to campus and hopes
to organize an Israeli movie and cultural day later this semester.
Schanzer, who is fluent in Hebrew
and Arabic, is currently at The
Washington Institute for Near East
Policy. He holds a master's degree in
Middle East studies from the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem and has studied at the Arabic Language Institute
of the American University in Cairo.

Critic Katha Pollitt spoke last Monday on what it means to
be a feminist writer.
Her talk, titled "Writing Controversies: Experiences of a
Feminist Writer," addressed how society sees feminists and the
lack of women's voices in mainstream media.
Pollitt, a columnist at The Nation and contributor to The
New Yorker and The New Republic, said that most people still
do not understand feminism. "If you are a feminist, much less
a feminist writer, people will think you hate men," Pollitt said.
Moreover, she said, these people tend to blame the movement for everything that goes wrong in their lives. For
instance, Pollitt said, men complain feminism is the reason
they cannot find dates, and women think feminism is why they
have to work full-time jobs. But Pollitt pointed out that these
people ignore the bigger picture and economic downturns that
are the real causes for their discontent.

While the commons will be opening on Monday,

Pollitt then moved to address the underrepresentation of
women in the press. For example, she said, there is only one
woman's byline to every five men's bylines in major newspapers. In the field of opinion journalism, there is a dearth of
women columnists, and in that group, few represent the feminist perspective.

Furthermore, she said, these columnists, who usually get
their start in journalism by specializing in women's issues,
cannot break out of the gendered corner to write about broader subjects such as politics.

"Identity politics helped women get a crack at their topics
but also boxed them," Pollitt said. The reason, she explained, is
that "men get from women what they can't get themselves"
in this case, insight on problems unique to women.
Pollitt added that she is fortunate to have complete freedom
to write on a column on any topic at The Nation without editorial censorship.
While Pollitt's talk is part of a new Writing Associates program tradition of bringing writers to campus to talk about
their writing process, she did not talk about the writing process
during the lecture. However, in the ensuing question-andanswer session, she discussed the editing and collaboration
processes.

According to English professor Jill Gladstein, who directs
the writing associates program, Pollitt received an honorarium
of $5,000 for her lecture. Aside from the Writing Associates program, other sponsors for Monday's talk were the women's studies program, the Women's Resource Center, the Forum for Free
Speech and the department of English literature.

Lawyer wary of policing
Lecture first event in two-week Peace Initiatives program
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ

abrownil@swarthmore.edu

Michael Steven Smith presented his lec-

ture Monday with a quotation written in
chalk on a blackboard behind him. The
words concerned the ease of manipulating
the public to support government actions,
and it was attributed to Herman Goering,
second in command to Adolf Hitler.

Smith said, describing the media's "perpetuation of lies" concerning Iraq's relation to
the Sept. 11 attacks and al-Qaida.
Smith described his history as a lawyer
protecting anti-war protestors during the
Vietnam War and said he had seen government restrictions increase since that point.
Smith concluded by expressing concern
that the government is isolating Muslims
and southeastern Asians as way to find
scapegoats.

"The system of checks and
balances that we have right
now is really out of kilter."
Michael Steven Smith
The quote set the tone for the lawyer's
speech, "The Encroaching Police State" in
which he discussed the U.S. government's
use of fear to gain public support for both
U.S. military actions abroad and the restriction offreedoms at home. "What do you need
to wear camis for at Penn Station?" he asked.
"The system of checks and balances that

we have right now is really out of kilter,"

Smith's presentation was a part of the
two-week Peace Initiatives program, which
is intended to incite communicationbetween
different communities.
Anna Perng 'O3, one of the organizers of
Peace Initiatives, said she thought it was
important to have Smith speak because of
the "complete lack of awareness about the
plight of Arabs and southeast Asians in the
United States."
Carlos Duque 'O3 said he thought that

Smith was a "gifted speaker who loosely

Students build wall to promote peace
Alex Edleson 'O4 and Chloe Le
Pichon 'O5 are building a Wall of
Peace. They began on April 19 by
making the bricks by mixing pits of
clay-rich subsoil with water and straw,
which they then put into rectangular
molds.. The wall, which will go up in
the Crum Woods behind Dana and
Hallowed, is meant to be "a place for
gathering and contemplation,"

New IDs for first-years
The new student identification cards Student Council proposed are in the
final stages of approval, according to Appointments Chair Chris Ciarleglio 'O4.
The council viewed several options for the new IDs at a meeting Tuesday
night. They chose an ID with a picture of the amphitheater along the right side
and the words Swarthmore College on the left side. The council discussed
whether the pictures on the ID should be black and white or color.
Council members also debated whether the bar code could appear on the
front of the card, which would allow the code to be printed onto the card as
opposed to pasted on as a sticker. The new IDs were initially planned with the
bar code on the front of the card, but there was some concern as to whether
the library would approve the new bar code location.
The council plans to have the IDs ready for the class of 2007.

Murphy

mixed media show emphasizing patterns and connections. Murphy says
of his project's origin, "I came to the
current style in which I'm working
through the desire to convey the consistency of structural elements found
in both natural and man-made
forms." He examines these links

through works in origami, photography and

wall reliefs.

The collection connects structures, materials and Murphy's differing artistic styles. His assembly of
origami forms focus on the "patterns
of lines found within the structures."
Other pieces identify similar repetitions through different media and
subjects.
One of his photography
installments juxtaposes magnified
onion skin cells with "strikingly similar" images of stone masonry
around campus. For Murphy, "the

familiarity and truthfulness of photography helps make the connections more easily recognized."
Murphy unites new and old artistic methods as well. The exhibit combines his first ever experience using
wall reliefs with his childhood hobby
of origami. His experimentation
with wall reliefs and his return to
origami expand upon the unity of the
underlying contrast between the
unfamiliar and familiar.

along with their connotatrying to force these fatsuits

fashion."

Fashion fascinates Wu in terms of both its aesthetic
value and people's conceptions of it. As an extension of her
obsession, the fat suit offers a response to mainstream fashion's conventionality and emphasis on utility. "My fatsuits
are all about rejecting conformity through clothing, especially the conformity that forces clothing to be designed in
such a way so as to complement culturally imposed body
ideals," Wu said. Rather than engulfing or disguising the
body, her suits "celebrate the non-ideal, and, through the
guise of art, transform it."
During the process, Wu learned how to sew and how to
deal with a reluctant audience. After frustrations with the
resistance of potential wearers, she added fat pants to her
collection of suits for a more ready-to-wear option. This matter of degree was one of the formative struggles in her
process, which she explored in a variety of pieces. Pants
offered Wii a gentler way to bring fatsuits to her audience
and another forum for the interrogation of fashion.

presents a series of drawings and paintings. She focused mostly on drawing because of
the medium's ability to convey the interaction
between the artist and the object in the moment.
"I feel that drawing helps me to represent my
interpretation of visual phenomena most honestly and with the greatest immediacy," she
says.
Damerville's choice of subjects for her pictures reflects her straightforward yet thoughtful approach. She says of her work, "I make art
about the things that people really ignore, like
the simple domestic things that surround us
every day. The things that we found powerful as
children, that we no longer have time to consider." Emphasizing the everyday, her drawings

'Bend It' strays toward success
BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu
It could easily have been a flop: the tale of an Indian
girl living in London who wants nothing more (against

her parents' more conventional desires, of course) than
to play soccer with her non-Indian counterparts. Of
course she falls in love with a white boy along the way,
of course her mother wants her to stop baring her skin,
of course she's supposed to want to don a sari and bindi
like her traditionally inclined older sister. It could easily have been trite, stuffed with stereotypes and caricatures, totally two-dimensional. But it wasn't.

the rest of the world) without falling into, and usually
winning, the informal games.
Beyond her bedroom fantasies and secret matches,
however, she doesn't take football terribly seriously. She
knows her parents don't approve, and, besides, she's
Indian and female. She can enjoy soccer, but she can
never really play it.
Until, that is, she meets Jules (Keira Knightley), a
white girl who's equally into football (against the desires
of her flighty, push-up-bra-pushing mother, who thinks
Jules should be chasing boys, not spotted balls). Jules
spies Jess's talent and approaches her with information
about her organized girls' league. She encourages Jess to
try out, telling her that the team could really use her

ball-bending skill. Jess is beyond delighted at the
prospect of playing in a proper pitch, wearing real jerseys against other real teams. And her coach, even if he
is slow to warm up, is pretty hot and very keen to add
Jess's ability to his team.

Right through the end, "Bend It Like
Beckham" strays slightly from the
beaten path. The final cut isn't just
a middling happy ending. Like the
rest of the movie, it's infused with
humor both subtle and overt.
Gurinder Chadha's sophomore film "Bend it Like
Beckham" opens with a dedication to her Indian father,
which seems odd at first, given the parent-child conflict
that is the movie's basic premise. As the film rolls and
the characters develop, it makes perfect sense. The frustrated parents are not simply the story's antagonists.
Rather, the characters serve as three-dimensional,
ambiguously concerned buffers and obstacles in the primary character's quest to fit her square peg into
London's round hole.
Jess (played convincingly by 25 year-old Parminder
Nagra) is a pretty, strong-willed Indian teenager who, to
her parents' dismay, is obsessed with white David
Beckham, England's best footballer. She's also secretly
infatuated with and adept at the game itself. She can't
pass the park where her male Indian friends play pickup
soccer (heretofore referred to as football, as it is known

Her parents, however, are less enthusiastic. Her mom
throws up her hands and exclaims at the Indian icon
hanging above their mantel. Her daughter should be
looking for a fine Indian man, learning to make flawless
chapattis, thinking about attending the university to
become a prestigious solicitor. Her dad, unlike Jules'
eager beaver football dad, is in complete agreement,
owed primarily to his own festering grudge against
English cricket players who tormented him for his turban. His daughter should not be playing football: They
laughed him off the field.
The movie evolves into an ever-thickening web of
deceit and misunderstanding between parent and child,
coach and player, player and player and, for the most
part, it all flows smoothly together. Each isolated plot
twist would seem to lend itself nicely to a terribly templated, fragmentary script, the flop "Bend It Like
Beckham" could have been.
But Chadha's incredibly well-formed characters bring
what may otherwise have been stale scenes to life, even
Jules' mom. The audience watches her agonize over her
daughter's football playing and understands her plight,
however asinine it actually is. Encounters feel genuine
and are, at times, situationally hilarious without seeming artificially selected from the cuture-clash catalogue.

Junior mints: fresh advice on staying chill

2. If you know deep down that you
need to transfer, you have my unconditional blessing to disappear. But to most
students, I'd recommend you stay the

tunities for you. It won't.
Swarthmore has created a
great environment where
people can create opportunities for themselves. America
is all about the "self-made
man/woman" thing, and
Swarthmore is a a place
where that can actually happen.
3. Quit talking about politics and philosophy. After
you quit talking about politics and philosophy, you can

start talking about politics
and philosophy again.
4. Fight with your parents. It'll make you feel like you're 16
again, and it'll make your parents happy
that you still care about them. Everybody
wins.
5. Speaking

the

physics department like the plague. I'm
certainly content with my major, but it's
an incredible workload I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy (Tim Applebee 'O3).
Isaac Newton died a virgin, and he was
consequently a bitter, angry man. It was
his goal to make every succeeding generApril

found a successful way.
6. Do not, under any circumstances,
insult your major.
7. Do stupid things. "Jackass" is the
greatest TV show I need to get around to
seeing.

We all should have gone
somewhere else. Good for
us. Too bad we're here.
"Should" is a wasted word.
8. The people in every class at
Swarthmore can be divided into three

incompatible groups: professors, sycophants and everybody else. If we went to
one of those enlightened schools where
the students never actually meet their
professors, the sycophant group would
die or disappear, but see tidbit of wisdom

number one. Outside of class, these
groups get along well, but there's something about a classroom that rubs people
the wrong way. So, the next time you're in
class, try to figure out which group you
belong in and follow this advice to smooth
24, 2003

things over:

Professors: If the weather is nice, let
class be held outside.
Sycophants: You cannot effectively
suck up with so many other students
present in class. You have to get class
to end as soon as possible so that you
can lecture the professor when nobody
else is around. Therefore, try to make
class as short as possible by saying
nothing.

Everybody else: I've always wanted
to see somebody say, "Screw you guys,
I'm goin' home," and walk out of class.
Perhaps someone could make my wish
come true.
9. Pizza.
10. Inaction trumps action, unless tidbit of wisdom number seven is involved.
11. Freshmen seem stupid, but seniors
are the biggest messes of everybody. I and
I alone am a pillar of sanity.
12. Whenever anybody tries to give
you advice, like I have in this list, they're
probably either meddling, stupid, evil or
wrong.

approached

Sharpies from four directions. One was coming
down the hill from
McCabe.
One
was
trekking up from Mullan.
One was rolling right out
of bed from Danawell.
And one was trying to get
through the rubble of the
Science Center. All had
either excruciating or
exhilarating stories to
share about the previous

evening.

Cary.
Swattie
#1:
Always ready to embrace
a new |.yp e 0 j sexua i experience, he had hooked up with a spec in the WRC. Yes,
that's two boys in the Women's Resource Center. Go figure. After carefully inspecting the young pup's ID to
make sure he was legal, Cary brought a whole new definition to the word "hosting."
Swattie #2: Miranda. Overwhelmed by honors papers
and law school paperwork, Miranda was having a hard
time finding time for her boyfriend, Steve. Steve was just
having a hard-on. Word had gotten to Miranda that Steve
was getting it on with both a rugby gal and a Frisbee guy.
Swattie #3: Charlotte. The queen of long-term relationships, Charlotte was suddenly having trouble with her
errant boyfriend, Trey. For the fifth time in two months,
Trey had decided to break up with her. The inconsistency
of it all had been affecting Charlotte's sleep schedule and

hair.

Swattie #4: Sam. Faced with the end of his college
career, Sam was dissatisfied with the number of dorms he

had conquered sexually. Willets, Mertz, Wharton, Parrish
and Danawell were easy, but damn, Woolman, ML and
PPR were just a little out of reach. So Sam grabbed his
boyfriend Richard, hopped on a shuttle, and introduced
Richard and himself to the off-campus dorms.

Over a tasty meal of chicken fingers, the four friends
dished. Exactly why did Cary end up in the WRC? Was
Miranda's boyfriend's newly discovered bisexuality
going to end their relationship? What was with
Charlotte's boyfriend, and what kind of shampoo could
help her hair out? Had Sam forgotten about Strath Haven

and Worth?
After a healthy and therapeutic lunch session, they
each left with a new perspective on the personal challenges ahead of them. Cary would learn to respect the
WRC as a safe space for the gender which he had no interest in and take his spec-hopping elsewhere. Miranda analyzed why she was more bothered by the bisexual issue
than the cheating issue. Charlotte decided enough was
enough, out with the boyfriend and out with the two-inone shampoo. Sam learned that mentally conquering his
honors exams was just a tad more important than sexually conquering the dorms.

As a sex columnist and as a
senior, I've learned that hot boys in
Calvin Klein boxer-briefs at Sager
are nice (extremely nice) but that
what is more important are the
friends that I've made here.
Now why were these four Swatties' stories important
enough to be put into print? Because as a sex columnist
and as a senior, I've learned that hot boys in Calvin Klein
boxer-briefs at Sager are nice (extremely nice) but that
what is more important are the friends that I've made
here. Forget penises, politics, professors and papers.
Whether it be on the phone, on Instant Messenger, over a
meal in Tarble or right smack in the middle of McCabe, the
conversations I've had with my friends will always overshadow that one crazy night of oral sex in the Crum. Over

these past four years, we've laughed at each other's sexual
faux pas. We've been there for each other when we've
given our hearts to the wrong people. We've offered each
other advice that no one at Psych Services possibly could.

family you can have is the family that you create.
Swarthmore is such a family. The friends I've made here
are such a family. In short, I [heart] Swat and I [heart] my

The old man
and the angel
Gripping physicality
marks theater thesis
.

An old man shambles across the floor, desperately clinging

to what bodily control he has left. He stops at the slightly
raised platform in the middle of the floor, shuffling as close to

it as he can get, lifting one stiff-jointed foot up, then the other,
bracing himself on the edge as he absorbs the impact from the
exertion. Moving forward, he slowly eases himself into an armchair that looks as old and disheveled as he does.
So begins the senior directing thesis of Kate Nelson-Lee
'O3. Her production, which goes up this weekend, comprises
two short pieces; this one, "Krapp's Last Tape," was written by
Samuel Beckett. The "old man" (Krapp) is Swat alum Lorin Lyle
'9O, who has mastered the posture and movements of a 70year-old, down to the working of his mouth, which chews and
twitches in an utterly convincing imitation of an elderly man.
"Working with Lorin forced me to reexamine my directing
methods," Nelson-Lee said of her experience with Lyle. "Lorin's
performance experience is primarily based in dance, and it
was surprising how dancers and actors use different languages within the development of performance." Lyle's dance
experience is evident in the sensuous physicality of his performance, every detail of movement executed perfectly, down
to his slow devouring of a banana.
This physicality, however, is addressed to no one, inviting
one to redefine the notions of "performance." The spare set
reinforces this effect: A dilapidated chair, a table, piles of
boxes and a suspended light bulb are here not for show but to
define the suffocating boundaries of the space n
lives. The effect is unbelievably gripping.

music with changes in his
cing, discourse content
and tone. Lights flash from one corner, perhaps the flashlight
of interrogators, and Duque is stricken, facial expression and
bodily posture responding as one. The music quickens and
changes to threatening drums, and it is at once the attacking
questions of his captors and his heartbeat. Then floating piano
music slides in, and Duque is angelic, his light arms and lifted
chest seeming to suspend him, hovering, above the ground.
"The War in Heaven" is charged with physicality, too, but with
an ethereal, otherworldly quality.
Nelson-Lee chose to combine the two works on one bill
because of their similar themes. "It started with this idea of
being trapped within a body that you have no emotional attachment with and this idea of the endless cycle of existence," she
said. It is remarkable that two very different plays can communicate this exact sentiment. While this production is not
relaxing uncomfortable is a better description it may be
some of the most thought-provoking theater you will attend.

Prioritize Arab studies
Given the war the Middle East and America's decadeslong presence in the region, Americans are starting to

show interest in Arab history and development. It's even
better that some, including many at Swarthmore, have
dedicated themselves to understanding more than just
the politics of the tumultuous region. Students nationwide are expressing interest in the background and the
languages of Middle Eastern people.
At Swarthmore, the development of a Middle Eastern
studies program has been slow going. While we applaud
efforts at building an Islamic studies program by hiring a
professor and sponsoring campus-wide events, the commitment seems lackluster, considering the circumstances
of our nation's current relationship to the Arab world.
In 1997, the Council on Education Policy suggested
three new programs: Islamic cultural studies, film and
media studies and cognitive science. Since then, film and
media studies has developed a course and honors minor
as well as a special major, while the Islamic studies program has lagged behind. It took the tragic events of Sept.
11 for the college to promise funding for a full tenuretrack position in Islamic studies without waiting for
money through the capital campaign. While this position
was promised for the fall of 2002, we face the end of the
spring semester, and no such position has materialized.
It also seems as though the program's name is a misnomer. The courses offered do not all reflect the culture of
the religion of Islam. Rather, these classes emphasize the
history, politics and culture of the Middle East and Arab
people as well as Islam itself. To call this program Islamic
cultural studies is equivalent to calling European history,
politics and culture "Christian cultural studies."
We recognize that it is expensive and time-consuming
to put together a whole new program. But if the college is
truly making a priority of a Middle Eastern program, it
should put sufficient resources toward constructing a
thoroughly developed, independent program that would
shed light on a complicated, important area of study.

Dear Editor:

While any support for a peaceful resolution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict is a noble act, it is not noble to
practice politics of exclusion in order to further the
cause ("Pro-Palestinian activists speak, pg. 4 April 17).
Micah White 'o4's meeting about the Palestinian nonviolent movement should have been a forum for both
sides to agree on denouncing violence and its negative
consequences. It is hard for both sides to agree when the
scheduling of the event minimizes the chances for an
open discussion. The talk was scheduled during the
first Passover Seder and negated the chances of Jews
being able to take part in the discussion, which, consid-

The final shout

Unless I flunk all my classes or fall into a rift in the
space-time continuum, it seems as if my time at
Swarthmore is almost at an end. I've had a lot of fun writing for The Phoenix, and, although I cringe at a few of my
old columns, on average I think I've done a pretty decent
job. Before I go, I'd like to take this opportunity to share my
experiences, so that whoever comes after me can avoid
some of the mistakes that I made.
In no particular order, here are some of the rules that I
have found helpful, for the next person who holds this position to use or disregard as he or she sees fit.
Rule number one is not to
work too hard. Everyone loves
completeness, but if you actually try to explore every implication and ward off every criticism of your argument, you'll
go so far over the word limit
that your editors will have no
choice but to send Tong assassins after you. Even worse,
you'll drive yourself nuts.
Rule number two is to treasure your hate mail. Under normal circumstances, it is an
unnerving thing to receive an eDAVID HAENDLER
mail from a total stranger
informing you that your opinTwo-Fisted Punditry ions are evil, that your thoughts
are stupid and that you engage
in intimate congress with animals of a barnyard nature.
However, if you receive such an e-mail in response to a
Phoenix column you've written, the correct response is joy.
Hate mail is a sign that your column is succeeding at getting an emotional reaction out of people and engaging the
topics that they're most passionate about. It's also a sign
that people are reading your column. The more rambling
and incoherent your attacker is, the more bonus points his
or her message is worth.
Rule number three is to be constantly aware of the fact
that, if your parents are anything like mine, they will read

A witty, entertaining column espousing
the unique political views of Attila the
Hun will get a far better reception
than a bland, tepid piece about saving
the whales.
your column religiously. Censor yourself accordingly.
Rule number four is to put no stock whatsoever in
Swarthmore's reputation as a bastion of liberalism. Sure,
Swatties are considerably more left-wing than other
Americans. Spiro Agnew, God bless his soul, was absolutely right to call this place the "Kremlin on the Crum." But
people here respond to good writing, not political orthodoxy. A witty, entertaining column espousing the unique
political views of Attila the Hun will get a far better reception than a bland, tepid piece about saving the whales.
Rule number five is not to fall under the misapprehension that op-ed columnists get all the chicks. When I first
took this position, I thought that it would be the first step
toward obtaining a wild, hedonistic lifestyle just like
George Will's. Boy, was I mistaken. Oh, well. Live and learn.
Rule number six, the most important rule of them all, is
that nobody likes to be hectored. Every week, the typical
Swattie is mercilessly bombarded with appeals from
activists, professors and the media, each one trying to belabor the urgency of some particular Pressing Social Issue. By
the time this poor soul picks up The Phoenix on Thursday,
he or she is thinking, "If I have to put up with one more
earnest, well-meaning diatribe telling me what to be concerned about, I shall bite down hard upon my cyanide-filled
fake tooth." Even if you do not give a fig for the mental
health of your peers, and there is no compelling reason why
you should, earnest, well-meaning diatribes are incredibly
tedious to write. Everyone will be better off if you don't take
yourself too seriously.

Being Christian at Swat
Over the years, many people have asked me about
my experiences being a Christian at Swarthmore
students, faculty, staff and even prospective students and

parents! It's an interesting
question and I enjoy trying
to figure out what my
answer is each time I'm
asked. So, just in case you
ever wanted to ask but

never got a chance, here
are a few ways I might
answer
the
question:
"What's it like being a

KRISTA MARSHALL
lodized Salt

Christian at Swarthmore?"
It's being constantly
challenged in your belief
and thus constantly being
given the opportunity to
either fall or to grow but
mostly to grow. I think that
I've
benefited
from
Swarthmore in a way that
with the Swarthmore main-

people who are more inline
stream are much less likely to.
It's finding that some of your peers and teachers
think that Christians are irrational, unintelligent and
responsible for most of the evil in the world today.
Moreover, it's trying to live in such a way that does not
do God the dishonor of making that true.
It's like visiting an art museum and actually knowing the artist behind every painting. Biochemistry is so
much more exciting when I remember that there really
is a designer behind the "elegant design" of each
enzyme we study. What a joy to think God's thoughts
after him, to see the fingerprints of the God all over my

studies!
It's feeling the burden of the pain and hopelessness of
those around you and knowing that you know the one
who can answer all their fears and fulfill all the true
desires of their hearts if only they would turn to him.

It's being able to recite the phrase "No matter what
they say or do to me, I am still a worthwhile person"
with integrity and consistency. I don't think that scientific materialism lets you do that. But an identity in
Christ and worth as an image-bearer of God is not
changed by the winds of grades and stress.
It's desperately wanting to crawl into a hole for

and to love God and your neighbor.
It's finding true community with a group of people
with whom you would never be united except by the
blood of Christ. And that is a beautiful thing.
It's being a very public hypocrite and being constantly humbled as you must admit and even share
your weaknesses for the sake of those around you, so
that their vision of this God who meets us where we are
and works in us and through us would not be obstructed by your sins.
It's being able to have your cake and eat it, too. So
many Swatties want so desperately to serve others, to
stand for peace and justice, to make an impact on lives
for the better, to do good and even to save the world.
But few of them have a worldview that I find to be logically consistent with their goals and desires. As a
friend of mine told me, "You can't be a Social
Darwinist and want to feed the hungry. It just doesn't
work." But God declares that he blesses his people
that they might be a blessing to all nations. And God
calls us to be suffering servants like Christ, who laid
down his life for us all
with the promise that this
suffering is not futile failure but that death is swallowed up in victory. Now there's a motivation to act,

to serve, to try even when you've failed again and
again.

It's an episode from the twilight zone, a walk on the

President Bush has begun pressuring the United

The anti-sanctions cause has held the status of a
futile left-wing battle since the sanctions were introduced by the United States, via the U.N. Security
Council, 12 years ago. In 1995, The New York Times
reported, "As many as 576,000 children have died as a
result of sanctions imposed against Iraq," noting that
"the U.S. government continues to defend a blockade
whose highest casualty rate is among those under 5

What controversy?

Dear Editor:

Randy Goldstein's and Arthur
Chu's opinion pieces about the
Pipes controversy were very amusing ("Free speech under fire" and
"Pipes controversy overblown," pg.
18-19, April 17). The controversy
about the Pipes controversy was

itself "overblown." After all, if one

to defend it. Therefore, I infer that
Jeff Rogg 'os's actions are the subject of controversy. Since these thorough columnists forgot to name

Thankfully, in his article, Arthur
Chu who is on the verge of completing his first year at Swarthmore
has shared his wonderful insight
about Swarthmore culture and
made this recommendation:
"I think it's time we realized that
this sort of attitude is why people in
the real world find the core of
Swarthmore's aggressive progressive culture annoying and don't listen to us. If we were to teach and

enforce rules of etiquette, civility

better served."

Opinions
W.E.B. Du Bois:
the arch-villain
Ever wonder why most blacks have victim mentalities?
blacks are still house

Why bourgeois and lumpen proletarian
Negroes and field Negroes? Why black

studies are generally
not Pan-African studies as described in my last column, but
rather victim studies? Why blacks have such a deep-seated
inferiority complex? The answer is quite simply W.E.B. Du
Bois.

Du Bois is our Lex Luthor. He undermined one superman
after another. First, he played nemesis to Booker T.
Washington, the Sage of Tuskegee, whom he deconstructed so
effectively that black mainstream America sees him as an
Uncle Tom. Second, Du Bois played nemesis to Marcus
Garvey. He led the "Garvey Must
Go!" movement, which got the
Provisional President of Africa
deported from the United States
in 1925. Alienated from Harlem,
his Pan-African base of operations, Garvey never quite recovered. Thus, his movement,
deconstructed by Du Bois as the
caricature we know as "Back to
Africa," faltered. Washington
and Garvey, as empire-builders,
saw blacks as agents of an upand-coming black civilization
parallel to white civilization. To
them, the Negro's challenge was
TARU TAYLOR
to build a civilization truly separate, but equal, to that of the
Superman
Caucasian. But Du Bois didn't
mm^^^^
think that the Negro was up to
the challenge. As a protester, he
saw blacks as mere victims of white civilization.
Du Bois is our Lex Luthor. His philosophy of "double-consciousness" on the one hand, "two-ness" on the other, is our
kryptonite. To Du Bois, the Negro can't help but see himself
from the white perspective. He has no "true self-consciousness," only double-consciousness. The problem is that his double-consciousness was not a diagnosis meant to provide clarity so as to make way for a home-grown solution to the "Negro
problem." Instead, it was fatalistic, for he saw the Negro as a
dependent of the white man's burden. Du Boisian schizophrenia has rendered the black man mere marginal man.
Two-ness is the other half of the Du Boisian kryptonite. It
is the idea that the North American black man is a sort of
Jekyll-and-Hyde psychic mulatto with a Negro soul and a
Caucasian soul, a black mind and a white mind. Du Bois'
schizophrenic Negro, lacking integrity, has sought integration. Caught in the netherworld between normative whiteness
and marginal blackness, Du Bois' vanguard, the talented
tenth, have desperately sought what King called "somebodiness." As the brokers between white supremacy and black
mass unrest, the talented tenth have found their niche, not as
somebodies but as tokens.
Du Bois is our Lex Luthor. As the biblical proverb says, "A
people without a vision perish." His schizophrenic philosophy
obscured Washington's circumspect vision of "Fabian
Capitalism," the vanguard of which was Washington's
National Negro Business League. It obscured the panorama of
Garveyism, the vanguard of which was the Universal Negro
Improvement Association. It has ruined the black American
psyche, for it has rendered blackness synonymous with victimhood. It is not so much white supremacy but double-consciousness and two-ness that every black man who wouldrise
to the superman must conquer.
Marcus Garvey threw down the gauntlet of black cultural
literacy when he published his "Philosophy & Opinions" in
1925. It is at once the fountainhead of Afrocentrism and the
magnum opus of Pan-Africanism. Indeed, Garveyism, as a philosophy, is the ultimate synergy of Afrocentrism and PanAfricanism. The black man as Garveyite is the superman. But
he who is of the talented tenth is mere marginal man.
Afrocentrism trumps double-consciousness. The Garveyite
synthesis of African civilization and Western civilization
trumps two-ness. Pan-African studies inspired by Garvey
trumps the victim studies inspired by Du Bois. The black man
will become the superman only when he learns to hate not the
white man but rather Du Bois and his talented tenth. Problack does not mean anti-white. It means Garveyism. It means
anti-Du Bois.

In speaking with various Swarthmore students, I have
noticed a few common concerns. I believe I can swiftly and
effectively deal with them if elected co-president.
I feel that the club sports funding dilemma has not been
sufficiently addressed. Currently, over 100 students participate in club sports without the benefit of Athletic
Department funds, meaning most expenses are paid from
your student activities fee or the athlete's own pocket.
Something about this equation does not sit well with me.
Why don't we have a cable connection in every dorm
lounge on campus? We already pay for the service; why not
take advantage of it?
SC, along with every other political organization at
Swarthmore (SBC, SAC, FFFP, etc.) should release its minutes in a single location online for convenient public viewI am thrilled about the prospect of serving as your SC
co-president and I hope to earn your vote.

Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5

If I am elected Student Council co-president, I will be
one step closer to my dream of eventual world domination.
Given the nature of my future occupation, I have experience in student government at Swarthmore. As the student
events advisor, I was part of initiatives to reform the C/NC
option, bring "Krispy Kremes" to Swat and secure a tenspeaker surround sound system for "Movie Night on the
Beach" this year.
I hope to work with Wee Chua, David Gentry and
Charlie Sussman next year on reforming the chartering
process, increasing cooperation between the athletics
department and club sports, creating a five-meal plan for
off-campus students and making council more proactive as
opposed to reactive.
In conclusion, it is time Swarthmore had a missile
defense system. I will work with the engineering, economics and political science departments to examine the
technical, economic and geopolitical feasibility of SSDI,
the Swarthmore Strategic Defense Initiative.

FINANCIAL POLICY REP.
Charlie Sussman 'O5

As financial policy representative on Student Council,
there are a few things I would like to see change. In my
past two years here at Swarthmore, there have not been
many highly successful large-scale events. I would like to
see the college sponsor more speakers and also more wellknown bands. I think that the budget committee could also
reserve more of its funds each week to the Social Affairs

Committee. SAC-funded parties are the main events each
weekend, and I feel we can give more money to groups
hosting the parties to help. These two ideas are just some
of the small steps we can take towards improving the overall quality of campus life and increase attendance for
school-sponsored events which would be my goal as financial policy representative.

STUDENT GROUPS ADVISOR
Christine Shin 'O4

I'm running for the position of student groups advisor.
I am interested in working with student groups and the
SBC because as a student active in a variety of organizations, I understand the importance of communication and
readily available resources. I would like to create a booklet for every group including information about charters,
budgeting, alternate funding sources and how to throw
parties. I believe that many groups go through similar
processes and this information would assist students
groups greatly, especially those that have not undergone
the process before. I am also eager to have dialogue with
other student group leaders so that the entire campus can
work together as our goals are not mutually exclusive. I
am currently active in groups such as the WRC, SAO,
ADVICE, SAC, as well as having five semesters' experience as a treasurer. Happy voting!

In the long run I will address the specific needs of
community service, cultural and ethnic organizations.
Leadership training will be available to all campus
groups, chartered or not, together with assistance with
recruitment, publicity and budgeting.

David Gentry 'O5

As student groups advisor, I plan on restructuring the
current charter system so that different groups can have
more individualized charters. I believe that this is better
than the current system of just one charter for all groups

CAMPUS LIFE REPRESENTATIVE
Jenna Adelberg 'O6

As campus life representative, I would ensure that the
entire campus would and could be involved in any activities
they desire. I feel that strong communication between the
students and the council which represents them is incredibly important to the well-being and social success of the
school. Working closely with SAC and the administration, it
would be my goal to make Swarthmore more fun and more
exciting than it is now (I know, it seems impossible, doesn't
it?). My goal is to establish and keep up all the potentially
interesting activities that Student Council and Swarthmore
as an institution have to offer. I can't promise miracles, but
I'm sure going to try. Thank you for your time.

Wee Jhong Chua 'O6

This is Wee Jhong Chua, and I am running for campus
life representative. In fulfilling the role of campus life representative, I will ensure that Student Council is not just a
group of students, instead a group of students intent on
helping college life. To further communication between
the administrationand the Swarthmore community, I will
ensure that student concerns be heard. College life consists of many factors: academics, parties, plays and concerts among other things. I am a man of the people, and I
will get us what Wee want. Thank you.

EDUCATIONAL POLICY REP.
Nicole Brunda 'O4

I am running for educational policy representative

rather be outside.

No gimmickry this time!
I am still a Lee of many Lees, and I still oppose the practice of student mule-hood. I am, however, more still.
Having agonized to the administration in my current role
as educational policy representative over the complexities
of our requirements, I have observed contrarily the vision
of students striving to forage a better Swarthmore community regardless by having served on the Student Groups
or Charter Committee. I believe I am now equipped to take
on the position of student groups advisor that chairs that
committee. I have learned that to invest myself in the slow
process of reforming our independent practices is just as
valuable, if not more urgent, than simply voicing fervent
ideology. It is only with an efficient and clear administration of our own organizations that we can best stress the
import of our opinions to the campus as a whole. Please
allow me, Melinda Lee 'O4, to continue helping the Charter
Committee towards that purpose.

Let me tiptoe my way throughout this campus. Let me
meet all the group leaders you have come to know. I am
sure we can talk our way to new heights. Let me ignite
visions into the hearts of all the groups you have proudly,
reluctantly, assiduously spent hours in. Passion, you see,
is more than meets the eye. And it's what comes when you
are like me and you spend your time in SQU on the board
conjuring up another idea for a meeting. Or it comes when
you are just lounging around in another one of those discussions on all the isms. Or it comes when you're running
around and you inquisitively wonder: Why does that girl
go to SWIL meetings? It's human, it's simple and I want to
dabble in it all. Let me take you to a new stage. Let me be

My name is Dave Majumdar, and I will be running for
the position of education policy representative. I have seen
how educational policy affects students through such
avenues as PDC requirements and the class recommendation book in past years. If elected, I would work to create
more educational avenues to benefit Swatties. Along with
helping to keep the class recommendation books updated,
I will put my energy into creating a hybrid exam schedule
which would give professors a much greater opportunity
to offer self-scheduled exams. This may also help alleviate
some of the stress suffered by Swatties who find themselves taking many exams over a short time. Also, I'd create stronger relations with Bryn Mawr and Haverford to
see if we can offer courses at different times, so that students who cannot take a required course here could take it
elsewhere in Tri-Co. Thank you.

Christopher Rose 'O5

I have numerous ideas to present to the council on educational policy if I were to be elected the educational policy representative. Among my ideas are possible changes to
the credit/no credit grading system which will allow students more flexibility when opting for this method of grading. I also wish to investigate the possibility of changing
the number of credits that certain courses carry, primarily language and science courses. These courses occupy

classroom time equal to that of two "normal" courses when

you count the required lab sessions. I believe that more
credit should be awarded for completion of such classes.
Although I have limited experience with a student government system, I do sit on several committees here and have
learned a great deal from them. I feel that my committee
experience will prove valuable if I were to be elected to

Women's tennis claims Centennial Conference crown
Garnet Tide drop just two games in 8-2 romp of McDaniel Green Terror
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

The women's tennis team is the 2003
Centennial Conference champion. Last
Saturday, the Tide clinched their first
place finish in impressive fashion, dropping only two games in a 9-0 sweep over
CC opponent McDaniel College to finish
10-0 in the conference.
With a conference title under their
belts, the women have set their sights on
top-ranked Emory and Washington and
Lee at the Atlantic South regional tournament in two weeks.
The Garnet Tide continued their winning ways in Maryland, easily defeating
last-place Centennial Conference rival
McDaniel last Saturday. Even without the
services of top-seeded Anjani Reddy 'O4,
the Tide dropped only two games. Firstyears Elli Suzuki, Emily Townsend, Sonia
Vallabh and Sonali Shahi all stepped up to
deliver victories in the third through
sixth singles positions.
Suzuki will join veterans Caroline

Celano 'O4 and Kristina Pao 'O4 and comin the individual Centennial
Conference tournament this weekend.
Reddy, who has won the individual title

pete

for the past two years, will be unable to
attend the tournament this year.
"Anjani can't compete this weekend
because she is taking the MCATs. It's
unfortunate, because she normally sweeps
the tournament," Pao said.
Two doubles teams, Celano and
Townsend along with Pao and Suzuki, will
represent Swarthmore at the tournament.
After the Centennial Conference tournament, the team will travel to
Washington and Lee to compete at the
Atlantic South regional tournament. The
two top-ranked teams in the nation,
Emory and Washington and Lee, are both
in the Atlantic South region. Despite the
top-rate quality of the conference, only
two teams in the region qualify for nationals. "We have one of the toughest regions
in the nation," Pao said.
"It's been a great season so far. The
girls have worked hard," Pao said. "We
keep pushing the bar higher. With the
girls playing strong and playing smart, we
can give some tough competition."
With only one member of the team
graduating

this

year,

co-captain

Katherine Voll 'O3, the team is expecting
an even better season next year. The Tide
are expecting at least two first-year play-

ers to step in and bolster the Tide's
already deep squad.
"We're going to be even stronger next
year. It gives everyone incentive to work

hard over the summer," Pao said.
Men's team loses to Washington
The men's team lost to regional rival
Washington College 4-2 last Friday. "We
had a close match. It was a tough loss,
because we probably should have beat
them," Ben Rae 'O4 said.
According to Rae, the Tide had moved
past Washington in the latest ITA regional
rankings. These rankings, however, were
not yet available as of April 23 on the ITA
Web site. In the preseason poll released on
Dec. 9, Washington was ranked third and
Swarthmore was ranked sixth in the
region.
Rae was the lone double winner for the
Tide, defeating his opponent 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 at
fifth singles and teaming up with Frank
Visciano 'O4 to win 9-8 at third doubles.
Jay son Yost 'O3 at second singles, and
Brian Park 'O6 at fifth singles also picked
up wins for the team.
Zach Rodd 'O6 nearly defeated his opponent at fourth singles, despite being
unable to serve overhand with a strained

rotator cuff.
"He played pretty well, given the circumstances," Rae said. "Everything else
is fine, I just can't do the service motion,"
Rodd said "I've been doing alright without

it."
Rodd is hoping his injury heals before
the team competes at regionals next weekend at Mary Washington. Eight teams will
be competing for only two available spots
at nationals. Although the team qualifies
almost every year to regionals, it has not
been to nationals since at least Rae's
three years at Swarthmore. "We've been
there every year I've been here," Rae
said, "but we haven't made it past the
first round."
To qualify for nationals, the team will
probably have to defeat two teams they
faced earlier in the year, Mary
Washington and Washington and Lee. The
Tide narrowly defeated Washinton and
Lee 4-3 on Mar. 29, but lost to Mary
Washington 6-1 on April 12. "We all seem
to be playing pretty well," Rae said.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to step it up in
the regional tournament."
"We definitely need to step up it at
nationals, or else we're going to be out
pretty quickly," Rodd said.

Gardner sets school record, provisionally qualifies for nationals
Melick, Golden log personal-bests; Akunyili places fourth in 400-meter run
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

The April 19 Widener Invitational provided the last
opportunity for members of the track team to qualify for
the Penn Relays, Centennial Conference Championships
and the exclusive NCAA Division 111 Championships.
Hosting over 15 college track and field programs, ranging
from Division I Villanova to Centennial Conference rival
Haverford, the invitational provided intense competition
with advancing to the aforementioned meets at stake. Such
conditions usually bring out the best in athletes, and such

was the case this weekend, as the Garnet athletes excelled
in their respective events.
Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 continued her performance in
what is shaping up to be a stellar season. On Saturday,
Gardner set a school record in the women's 800-meter run
in a time of 2:13.50 to qualify provisionally for the NCAA
Division 111 Championships.
"Going to the Nationals just really hasn't sunk in yet,"
record-setting Gardner explained. "I had to ask coach
[Carroll] three times if they were sure that the time was
correct. It is definitely more than I dreamed of. I knew I
was close to the record in the 1500[-meter run], but I
thought that the 800 record was a big reach."
"The race this weekend was a nice surprise. We all have
put in a lot of hard work this season and it is really paying
off," she said.

Another highlight for the women in the track events
was Njideka Akunyili 'O4, who placed fourth in the
women's 400-meter run in 59.84 to post the second fastest
time in the Centennial Conference this spring. Claire
Hoverman 'O3 finished seventh in the 800-meter run in
2:19.72, and Sarah Hobbs 'O6 placed 15th in the women's
1500-meter run in 5:06.33. Molly Maurer 'O6 rounded out the
Garnet women in the track events, finishing seventh in the
5,000-meter run in 18:55.5, good for the seventh best in
school history. The 4x400-meter relay team of harriers
Gardner, Akunyili, Hoverman and Emily Wistar 'O6 ran to
a third place finish in a season-best time of 4:08.09.
Pacing the Garnet women in the field events, Jessica
Zagory 'O5 and Robin Dawson 'O6 tied for 11th in the
women's high jump, reaching 4'06". In the women's polevault event, Sarah Kate Selling 'O3 finished sixth, clearing

8'06".

For the men's side, Rob Melick 'O3 led the Garnet in the
field events, finishing third in the shot put with a personal-best throw of 43'8.25" to post the Garnet's highest finish
at the Widener Invitational.
James Golden 'O5 placed 15th in the 1500-meter run in a
personal best time of 4:0211, the 10th best in Swarthmore

history.

"The fact that we practice at Widener helped me a lot,"
Golden said. "Because we don't have a track here at Swat,
we run on the Widener track a few days a week. I was really able to visualize those workouts during my race, and
April 24, 2003

that helped my confidence immensely. I think that not having a track here and having to practice at Widener was
therefore a definite, definite plus. This was a pretty big
meet with lots of Division I runners, so I was really nervous, but the quality of the competition helped me to run a
good time."

Garrett Ash 'O5 ran to a 12th place finish in the 5000meter run in 15:1192, good for sixth best in school history.
"There's no single day of training that does it," said
Ash. "It takes a lot of teammates, working together for a lot
of days, running a lot ofmiles to produce a strong cumulative effect like you saw from our team this weekend. I
think this meet really represented Swarthmore's men's
track team beginning to come into its own. Last year, we
barely had enough guys for you to justify calling us a team.
Now though, all of a sudden, we've got guys all over the
place qualifying for the conference meet and running some
damn impressive times. I'm fired up."
Zach Zaitlin 'O6 finished 17th in the 110-meter high hurdles in 18.33 seconds, while Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 finished 18th
in the 400-meter high hurdles event in 1:00.59. The 4x400meter relay team ofKier Wachterhauser 'O4, Matt Williams
'O4, Paul Thibodeau 'O6 and Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 placed sixth
in a season-best time of 3:3184.
Today marks the start of the celebrated Perm Relays,
which will be held at the University of Pennsylvania and
will last until Saturday, April 26. A handful of Swarthmore
athletes will run at Penn this weekend.

Men's lax closes season with win over Haverford
BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore.edu

Victory is theirs. They fought bravely
and left their sweat on the field and their
cleat marks deep in the turf. For the dedicated men that make up the Garnet squad,
the past few months have been filled with
long and sweaty practices, underdog triumphs and heartbreaking losses.
It was all worth it last Saturday in a
fierce battle against conference rival
Haverford. At the end of the day, the
Garnet Tide walked away with the sweet
taste of victory lingering in their mouths
as they defeated the Fords 12-10, finishing
the season 8-6 overall and 4-4 in the

Centennial Conference.
In a game that is typically filled with
distracting fans and discouraging heckling, it is even harder to maintain focus
and not get swept away in the hurrah.
"You know it's going to be hard fought
every year, and comparative scores going
in will mean nothing once you step on the

field," co-captain John Murphy 'O3 said.
But the Garnet used the energy of their
fans to propel them to victory.
"Beating Haverford was the perfect finishing touch on a great season," Ryan

Croken 'O5 said.
Leading the
Garnet offense, Joe
DeSimone 'O4 scored a career-high six goals
and added an assist on top of that. "Our
senior captains, John Murphy and Than
Court ['o3], put on a great performance in
their last game as well," Croken said.
After Haverford opened the scoring two
minutes into the game, Court countered
with a goal at 10:39 from a John Murphy
assist. Joe Mauri scored the first of his five
goals to give the Fords a 2-1 advantage. Tim
Chryssikos 'O5 tied the game with 16 seconds left in the quarter. Mauri made it 3-2 at
11:44 and DeSimone tied the game with his
first goal at 8:02 and gave the Garnet Tide a
4-3 lead with 5:29 left in the half. The Fords
tied the score just 34 seconds later to send
the game into the half deadlocked at 4-4.
The second half was full of lead changes,

SPORTS IN BRIEF
Women's Lacrosse
The Garnet lost a heartbreaker on Tuesday to
Centennial Conference rival McDaniel when Kim
Lowery broke a 9-9 tie with 25 second remaining to
lift the Green Terror.
Jackie Kahn 'O4 once again led Swarthmore,
scoring five goals and contributing an assist to the
team's effort. On the defensive side, goalie Sam
Uslan 'O3 had 22 saves for the Tide.
Next up for Swarthmore is the season finale
against Haverford on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. on
Clothier Stadium Field.

Baseball
After getting off to a 1-9 start in Centennial
Conference play, the baseball team has been on a
tear recently, winning three out of their last four
games to improve its CC record to 4-10.
On Saturday, April 19, the Garnet split two
games of a doubleheader with Dickinson, losing
the first game 8-1 and winning the second 8-3.
Jared Liederman 'O5 picked up the win in the second game, allowing only three hits and pitching a
complete game.
On Tuesday, the squad hammered Washington
for the second time in a week. This time around,
the Tide defeated the Shoremen 12-3 behind a
solid effort by co-captain Matt Goldstein 'O4, who
pitched a complete game five-hitter to earn the
victory.

The Garnet Tide wrap up their season this
week, playing two games against Ursinus before
hosting Haverford in the season finale on
Saturday at 1:00 p.m.

Softball
Like the baseball team, softball has been on a
recent tear, winning two of its last four games to
improve to 4-10 in the Centennial Conference.
Last Saturday, April 19, the Garnet split a doubleheader with the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats.
After being shut out 8-0 in the first game, the
Garnet bounced back in the back end of the doubleheader, edging the Diplomats 4-3.
After falling behind 3-1 early on, the Garnet rallied back and claimed the lead in the fifth, when Val
Marone hit a double and drove in three runs.
On Tuesday, Swarthmore split a doubleheader
with Haverford. The squad was shut out in the first
game, but won the second 6-3.
Softball hosts the Green Terror of McDaniel this
Saturday at 1:00 p.m.

THE PHOENIX

as the two teams battled to the last minute.
DeSimone scored back-to-back goals just 30
seconds apart at 10:05 and 9:35. The Fords
tied the game at 7:53 before DeSimone took
the lead back two minutes later. Murphy
scored with three minutes left to give the
Tide an 8-7 lead. Fischette and Mauri rallied to give the Fords a 9-8 lead at the end of
the third.
Going into the fourth quarter, the
Garnet had a one-goal deficit, but that did
not stop them. "Throughout the season,
every time a game was close going into the
fourth quarter, we came out with the victory," Murphy said. "The fourth quarter's
been where we play our best lacrosse."
This game proved no different.

John Cleaver tied the game with a

goal

at 13:08, and Chryssikos scored back-toback goals at 10:06 and 8:33 to give the Tide
an 11-9 advantage. DeSimone cashed in his
sixth goal with two minutes remaining. In
goal, Ryan Croken made 17 tough saves for

the Garnet.

"Croken made some big saves

in the net,

and the defense played a great game shutting down Haverford's key players and
clearing the ball perfectly," Murphy said.
Looking back on the highlights of the
season, the team remembers most "the
good showing against Gettysburg, the
Goucher upset early on, the Dickinson
game and the Elizabethtown comeback
from a 5-1 deficit at the half," Court said.
Throughout their season, time and time
again, the squad realized the major impact
their defensive players had on their success. "Our defense and especially our
goalie kept us in a lot of games," Mike
Wham 'O4 said.
It has been said that a team is only as
good as its leaders, and this proved especially true for the Garnet this past season.
"John and Than were excellent leaders and

are going to be missed next year,"
Chris Murphy 'O4 said.
The seniors looked back on their career
with fond memories. "I am so proud to be a
part of this team, and am sorry that my lax
career is over," Court said.

Ultimate men, women each
place second at sectionals
Earthworms, Warmothers hope to qualify for
nationals at the upcoming regionals tournament

With only one week remaining in
the academic year, the Warmothers
and Earthworms still have a lot of
Frisbee to play.
Both teams returned from Frisbee
sectionals this past weekend with
bragging rights, having placed second at the tournament.
In pool play on Saturday, the
Earthworms' A team got off to a lighting-quick start. Swarthmore A beat
Swat B 13-1 in its first match before
clobbering Lehigh 13-6 and shutting
out UPenn B, 13-0. The Earthworms'
3-0 Saturday record propelled them
into the semifinal round on Sunday.
Swarthmore B, however, fell to
UPenn B 13-5 and lost to Lehigh 13-6.
As a result, the squad was eliminated
from tournament play.
On Sunday, the tournament
switched to a double-eliminationformat. The Earthworms dominated
Haverford in the semifinals, 15-5, but
fell in the tournament finals to
UPenn A, 15-11. In the backdoor
finals, Swarthmore defeated Lehigh
for the second time in as many days,
15-6.
Discussing individual highlights
of the tournament, Worms co-captain

Wulfsberg 'O3 said, "Charles
Small ['o3] played a fantastic layout
defense all weekend long, and it was
really good to have Misha Horowitz
['o3] back on the sidelines inspiring
the team."

Wulfsberg added: "Rob Devoogd
['o6] was like a beast, or a man of
average or greater than average

game, getting several last-back Ds."
The Earthworms have a week off
before regionals on May 3-4 at
Princeton University. Swarthmore
will compete against 16 teams from
the mid-Atlantic region in hopes of
gaining one of two available bids to
advance to nationals for the second
year in a row.
According to
Wulfberg, the
favorites to snag the bids are perenpowerhouses
nial
Cornell and
height,

UPenn. This year, nationals will be
held in Austin, Tex., on May 23-25.
The Warmothers are also hoping
that their recent dominant play will
propel them into nationals.
In sectionals at Penn State last
weekend, the Warmothers finished in

second place.
"This was the first weekend we've
had decent weather, and the team

really gelled and played awesome,"
Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 said.
On the first day of play, the
Warmothers came out on fire, beating both Bucknell and CMU-Pitt.
Then, in a scrimmage, Swarthmore edged Penn State 13-12.
"Penn State is the number one team
in our nation by far, so it was really
exciting," Laurenza said.
The Warmothers' record qualified

them for the semifinals on the second
day of play, and Swarthmore beat
CMU-Pitt in that round to advance to
sectionals finals, where the squad fell
to Penn State, 15-1

"Marie Laurenza ['o6] had her
first layout catch and also a Callahan
score when we were playing zone
defense," Carolynn Laurenza said.
"She played great against Penn State,
too. We all stepped up in that game

Eurosport adventure
Saturday, I will play in my final collegiate contest. It's a scary
thought. Playing sports, something that I have made a priority in my
life, will be relegated to pickup games and old woman club leagues.
Perhaps I will be forced to start playing things like ice hockey and
Ultimate to find more playing opportunities. And there's always a place
for using my extra time to fully devote
myself to attempting to recreate the
sports fan experience of your average
American male. I just have to fully
devote myself to learning those stupid
video games, something I'm not so sure
I can master.
However, I was thinking that if I
ever send in that application to coach in
England (next week, Cloon, I promise), I
might just find myself in a new sporting
culture. I took a quick gander at
eurosport.com, the Web site that Google
led me to believe is Europe's answer to
espn.com. From there, I put together a
quick breakdown of Europe's top five
KATE NELSON-LEE
sports stories, as of yesterday, to broad-

en your horizons.
1. Cycling: the Fleche Wallone.
Apparently, there's a series of races
caue d the World Cup, and the Fleche
Wallone is the biggest non-World Cup race. A warm-up type of race as far
as I can tell, it's in Belgium, and it's a day-long, 199-km race between
Charleroi and Huy. No, Lance Armstrong is not riding in it. However,
this year's race featured the first Spaniard to win the race: Saeco's Igor
Astarloa.
2. Football: the Champions League playoffs. Need I say that they
mean soccer? The big quarterfinal matchup is between Real Madrid and
Manchester United. David Beckham, voted hottest football player ever
by me, is fueling all sort of unrest within the U.K. because of rumors that
he might move to Real Madrid. Or to the United States. Beckham apparently is surprised that football isn't bigger here in the U.S., and he'
wouldn't mind "making it big" in the States. He says of our prowess as
sports fans: "The American people are so patriotic about their teams and
their sports
more so than anywhere else in the world."
3. Snooker: Embassy World Championship. I think this is a billiards game like pool. I also think I played it against some random field
hockey player when we were in England two years ago. But so much of
that trip "never happened." The big lead from The London Times' story:
"Ronnie O'Sullivan became the first player to compile two 147 maximum
breaks at the Crucible Theatre last night during an otherwise uninspired first-round match against Marco Fu in the Embassy World
Championship." I have no idea what this means, do you?
4. Cricket: test matches. Apparently, cricket is a summer game, and

Up in the Skybox

we're currently in the preseason. The big story is the dilution of the traditions surrounding the game. Many are taking issue with a photograph
(of Michael Vaughan) that was placed on the cover of the 140th edition of
Wisden Cricketer's Almanack. Also, the West Indies lost to Australia.
(Don't know the score, and even if I did, I couldn't tell you what it
meant.) Is the West Indies even a country?
5. Horseracing (the jumping kind): The Heineken Gold Cup. One
of the bigger steeplechase races in the coming weeks, horses jump over
different things while running over three miles and a furlong. According
to The London Times, the event "is enticing most of the best staying
chasers." Right now, the horse Beef or Salmon is the odds-on favorite.
However, pundits note that Young Spartacus is looking good. I love
horseracing (all kinds) simply because of the horse names.
Ah, lots to learn. With legal, regulated betting everywhere, I think
this England thing could keep me amused for quite a long time. You can
find odds online, including for things likeathletics (known to us as track
and field), darts, Formula One racing and something puzzlingly called
Gaelic sport. This features hurling (seen in many a beer commercial),
which you can play in Milwaukee. Yeah, Milwaukee!
Then again, it is the season for the NBA and NHL playoffs. What time
is tip-off?
Kate Nelson-Lee, a two-sport athlete, will play in her final collegiate
game this weekend. You can reach her at knelson2@swarthmore.edu.

and Nationals aren't until mid-April."
Larson added, "I spent the last month practicing about three days a week, and last week I played
every day in preparation for this tournament."
During the day, the foursome competed in singles, doubles and mixed doubles events. Morris
failed to advance in the first round of doubles, and
Phoun also fell in the first round of doubles and

singles. "The tournament has helped me to see
what I need to work on for next year," Morris said.
"Anytime you see great badminton, you learn how
to play the game better."
Larson found success in the first round of singles
