Christensen 'll organized the event.
"The walk [was] kind of a peaceful
demonstration in now 42 cities and a
couple other countries in support [of
women's rights]," Christensen said.
Walks occurred everywhere from
Little Rock, AK to London.
Increasing legislation seeking to
deny women's rights instigated the
walk. "It started as response to H.R.3,

Currently, women on Medicaid who
are the victims of rape or incest are
eligible for government funds. Under
the H.R.3 Bill (aka "No Taxpayer
Funding for Abortion"), the G.0.P.,
however, sought to redefine rape
singly as "forcible rape," denying aid
to victims of statutory rape and incest.
Christensen was inspired to organize the walk by her interest in gender
studies and the online feminist blogging community. "I started a personal
[online blog], [and] there were a whole
bunch of groups [critiquing] conservatism, but one that was missing was
one [attacking] sexism," she said. "A
girl named Raven Geary started a
walk in Chicago. I got in contact with
her and I said I would be happy to

organize one in Philly."
Following the vote in the House of
Representatives to repeal Title X,
thereby reducing funding for Planned
Parenthood, the scope of the walk has
been extended.
"It seems like there are more and
more bills targeting women and taking
away their rights. We are actively trying to fight back and make our voices
heard," Christensen said.
Indeed, the event has been growing
at a rapid pace. It started just two
weeks ago and at one point a city or
two was being added each day.
The march is the first of its kind,
although Planned Parenthood has also
held successful rallies in the past.
"There was one down in D.C. where
women were invited to come down and
share their stories. It is estimated that
one fifth of women use Planned
Parenthood as their primary care
provider," Christensen said. "It's not
something that's gotten a ton of press,
but it's an important issue."
Over 100 people attended, including
Swarthmore student Erick Ball 'IL "I
attended the walk to try to raise
awareness of the fact that human
rights are not a done deal even in this
country
especially reproductive
rights, but really anything that
extremists in our society see as
immoral," Ball said in an e-mail.
Moreover, he considered the walk to
be successful, citing the myriad participants and high visibility in the more
heavily-trafficked parts of the city.
Christensen, too, found the walk to
be a success. "Support and happy surprises were the themes of the day in
Philadelphia," she wrote in an article
on Lawsonry, a socially progressive
online journal.
"The city was buzzing with energy,
togetherness, and exactly the kind of
love and understanding that the name
evokes," she said. She also discussed
how she was encouraged and applauded by everyone from a SEPTA worker
to a pediatrician.
Although they are passionate about
the issue, the marchers did not engage
in violent behavior or heavily interact
with opponents.
Christensen hopes to extend the
message to the Swarthmore campus in
the future, mentioning that she had
been in contact with Swat Ferns and
the Society of Women Engineers.
Additionally, she stated that there may
be a similar event on campus in the
weeks following the march.
Swat Ferns also hosted an event on
Wednesday in support of Planned
Parenthood "The event is hoping to
rally support for Planned Parenthood
after Congress ended Title.X to end
funding for the federal family planning program and funds preventative
reproductive health care for low
income women," Lisa Sendrow 'l3 said
in an e-mail.
"It should be educational, interactive, and it will also be a speak out
against Congress," Sendrow said. The
group hosted Steph Shaw, who recorded the event and sent the tape to
Senator Casey.

Students gather in the Scheuer Room Sunday night for the premier of the Oscars while
enjoying food from Margaret Kuo's, Peace-a-Pizza and Trader Joe's.

This month, the Global Health
Forum (GHF) is hosting a conference
for global health advocates from
other colleges and universities to
come together and discuss their difficulties and successes in campaigning for health related issues. Titled
The Global Health Project:
A
Student
Conference
for
Collaboration, the student-run conference will provide Swarthmore
students and guests a chance to hear
about other successful global health
initiatives, as well as to build a network of peers from several other
schools who also have an interest in
improving global health.
"We want to really foster each
group's objectives and work,"
Jessica Downing 'l2 said, who is an
executive board member of GHF and
has been helping to plan the conference.
Students attending the conference
will be invited to attend workshops,
lectures, and student presentations
about global health and advocating
policy change. Two keynote speakers, Jennifer Staples-Clark and
Danielle Butin, who each have
founded global health organizations
of their own, will give presentations
that will be open to Swarthmore's
campus as well as to those attending
the conference.
The idea arose from "[a] collective
idea of how, if we brought student
groups focusing in health, global
health specifically, together to form
a network and devise ways to contact each other, we could amplify the
impact of each of our individual
groups," Downing said,.
Melissa Frick 'l2, another executive board member for GHF, said
that the group had been frustrated
because of the difficulties of reaching out to collaborate with other
health groups in the past. "[The conference] was spurred by the difficultrying to
ties we were confronting
reach out to other schools and
groups and trying to form a network," she said.
The conference was advertised by
GHF largely through personal connections. Members tried to reach
other members of health-related
groups in other colleges and universities. Currently, around fifty students representing ten different
schools are registered to attend, a
number which could increase as the
event draws nearer. "It's big enough
to be successful and small enough to
be manageable," Frick said. Most of
the schools represented will be from
the Philadelphia area, although
there are students from Harvard and
Princeton registered to come, and
even a group of students from
Canada who have expressed interest.
"It's actually turning out so far a
lot more of the people who are interested in attending our conference
are individuals rather than groups,"
Downing said. This was also
observed by Marjani Nairne 'l3, who

is one of the GHF members in charge
of promoting the event at other
schools. "Hopefully [the attendees]
can take whatever they get from our
conference and bring it back to their
schools so, ifwe do this in the future,
we'll be able to attract more people,"
Nairne said. She added that, by aiming to attract larger organizations in
the future, logistics like transportation and housing will be easier to
manage.

GHF leaders are very excited at
the caliber of keynote speakers they
will be bringing to campus.
Staples-Clark is founder and chief
executive of Unite for Sight, which
strives to provide cost-effective eye
care to impoverished persons
throughout the world. She began

her a fitting speaker for an undergraduate global health conference; it

also received the National Jefferson
Award for Public Service, which is
considered comparable to a Nobel
Prize for public service, according to
Downing. Frick called Ms. StaplesClark a "celebrity" in the global
health field, and pre-med advisor
Gigi Simeone thinks she will be "an
inspirational role model for students
here."
Danielle Butin is the Founder of
the Afya foundation (Afya means
"good health in Swahili). "The goal
of the foundation was to collect medicine supplies and send them to
needy areas around the world,"
Nairne said, who has been in contact
with Ms. Butin for some time
through previous global health initiatives she has been a part of. She
was very excited that Ms. Butin will
be able to share her experiences as a
global health advocate as well as her
experience with Afya.
In April, four GHF members wiU
also be traveling to the Clinton
Global Initiative University in
California for a national conference
on global health issues that is targeted towards undergraduate and graduate students. Downing, who attended the conference last year, said that
some of the ideas for The Global
Health Project have come from experience of the members at the Clinton
Global Initiative conference, including the use of workshops and speakers on global health advocacy to generate dialogue among attendees.
Global Health Forum hopes that
Swarthmore will be able to host
more conferences like this one in the
future, in order to foster stronger
connections among student groups
advocating for global health. "We're
going to try to bring students together from a variety of campuses to talk
about...what role [we can] play to
influence global health as far as policies and even projects," Frick said.
"Swarthmore is an excellent place
to host this conference, because
Swatties are strongly interested in
global health issues and in service,"
Simeone said.

A 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand on Feb. 22. The death toll
has now risen to 169.

NEWS IN BRIEF

Student forum may bring different campus groups together
Student Council is actively gauging opinion on the idea of forming a student forum. The forum would provide a space for students and student
groups to voice their concerns in a collective body.
President of StuCo Simon Zhu 'll began thinking about the idea of a student forum last semester. Dean of Students Liz Braun told him of Mount
Holyoke's student senate and he thought it seemed like something that
would work well here. "Right now the basic idea is to create some sort of
forum that allows us to get in touch with students more, to have better
communication," Zhu said. "It would not be replacing surveys, but enhancing, augmenting our communication."
Then this semester Vice President of StuCo Olivia Ensign 'l2 expanded
the idea to include the RAs, SAMs and other student groups. On Sunday
night they began soliciting opinions from student groups and administrators. So far, according to Ensign and Zhu, the response has been positive.
"At this point we're just trying to do outreach," Ensign said. "... The next
stage would be discussion as to what students want this to look like. It's not
just what Student Council wants it to look like."
The goal of the forum, as Zhu sees it, is "to reach out and include as
many people as possible."
Ensign says that having a wide range of opinion in the forum is essential. She sees the forum as "another avenue of communication. The more
communication there is between groups, and between groups and the
administration, the more transparency there is."
StuCo is not limiting who this is open to at the moment. If the forum is
formed eventually decisions will be made about the make-up of the body,
but for the time being anyone can be involved in the discussions. So far
StuCo has reached out to various student organizations across campus,
RAs, SAMs, athletic groups, and others.
Zhu and Ensign specifically see the RAs as an important part of this discussion. According to Zhu, RAs "hold leadership on campus, they know
what's going on in hall lives, they're talking with their residents. They are
a focal point."
A forum also means opening up potential leadership opportunities. It
would provide groups and students with the opportunity to serve in a position with a close line of communication to the administration.
But again, nothing formal about the student forum has been created yet.
And according to Zhu, "it's such a considerable undertaking to institute a
senate as a body that meets regularly that we might explore different
avenues." For now it is being formed step by step. Discussions will continue throughout the semester.

Hospitality expert presents ideas or TCW Project

Jake Mrozewskl Phoenix Staff

In light of recent advancements on the Town Center West Project, Rick Pastorino, an expert in the hospitality industry, gives an overview of the hospitality industry and shares his
ideas for the project with members of the Swarthmore community.

BY ELI SIEGEL

esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

This past Monday, Rick Pastorino, a
hospitality industry expert who is a
principal at REVPAR International, Inc.,
came to campus to discuss the plans his
company outlined for the proposed Town
Center West Project.
Afterwards,
members
of
Swarthmore's administration joined
Pastorino for an informal Q and A session for the students, town residents,
city council members and others in
attendance. This meeting follows the
Board of Managers' recent approval of
Pastorino's proposal for the TCWP.
After conducting extensive research
on the local hotel market as well as other
comparable college and university inns,
Pastorino's company suggested that this
project be independently run by the college rather than be contracted out to a
chain company, such as Mariott that
would require a 10% revenue fee and dictate every aspect of the inn's operation.
Because the inn is mainly serving the
Swarthmore community and is not on a
main drag, Pastorino also suggested that

the inn be relatively small, with only 40
to 45 hotel rooms and some suites. A
restaurant and pub with a liquor license
and seating for about 70, and 4,750 square
feet of meeting space would also be

added to host academic conferences and
bring in customers.
In addition, Pastorino recommended
that the hotel offer a complimentary continental breakfast, a catering service,
free dedicated parking, a sundry shop in
the lobby, free Wi-Fi and a complimentary shuttle service to buildings on campus.
The bookstore would also be located
inside the inn complex. The proposed
rates for the inn are $llO $lB5 for weekday nights and $l3O $205 for weekend
nights. Visiting athletic teams and other
visitors associated with the college could
receive discounted rates.
Pastorino and his company determined that the project would be financially feasible for the college after creating a competitive set of hotels for comparison within the regional market that
allowed them to see how the local hotel
market was performing.
Based on this research, Pastorino
-

found that the local hotel market was
strong.
In 2007 there were about 55,000 available hotel room nights and about 32,000
of these nights were filled. In 2009, after
the new Best Western opened and the
Quality Inn was renovated, there were
107,675 available hotel room nights and
about 60,000 of these nights were occupied.

"The powerful data we want to show

you," Pastorino said during his presentation, "is that the market was sort of stag-

nant in 2007 and 2008 and as soon as

these hotels opened you can see that it
doubled the supply, but the demand also
doubled as well which means that there
was a slew of people out there that were
not staying here previously [that now
are]."

In addition, the recession did not have
as strong an impact in the local hotel
market as it did at the national level.
"In the worst part of the recession
here this market went downfrom 58 [percent] to 55 [percent] occupancy and on
the national trend it went down 8 [percentage] points in occupancy." Pastorino
said.

Pastorino projects about two-thirds of
the inn's business will come directly
from the college, such as visitors coming
for athletic events, scholarly conferences, theater productions and the Scott
Arboretum.
Most of these potential inn guests are
projected to be prospective students and
their families as well as Swarthmore
alumni wedding guests.
After the meeting during the Q and A,
Rebecca Chopp, the President of the college, emphasized the feasibility of the
project.

"We can make it a financially viable
project... something that is contributing
to the college's mission." In addition,
Chopp noted that several alumni donors
had approached the college to make the
project possible.

Services, said.

the project, relocating underground
facilities in Summer 2011 and opening

Version of WikiLeaks comes to college campuses
BY DORCY CHEN

dailypennsylvanian.com, Mar. 2, 2011

A version of WikiLeaks may be making its way to
college campuses.
UniLeaks, a newly launched website, announced
its aim to expose "corruption and mismanagement"
in United States colleges in an open letter to university presidents on Monday.
The website, which also operates in the United
Kingdom and Australia, is dedicated to reporting on
and publishing confidential university documents to
scrutinize university operations.
UniLeaks only accepts restricted or censored
material relating to higher education anonymously
through its website.
Careful to distinguish itself from being "just
another rumor mill," Captain Kangaroo, a UniLeaks
spokesperson, wrote that the website seeks "hard
evidence of malfeasance and corruption" and will not
"accept rumor or conjecture."
While Penn administrators were unable to comment on the launch of UniLeaks, Executive Vice
President Craig Carnaroli said the University "communicates openly, engages and consults broadly with
its varied constituencies, both internal and external"
in many ways.
He cited faculty groups, student meetings with
administrators, open forums and meetings as examples of how the University maintains transparency.

Peter Collopy, a third-year graduate student in the
Department of History and Sociology of Science, said

Travel agencies cancel trips due to crimes in Mexico

2011

Most American college students
instantly associate spring break with
the warm, sandy beaches of Mexican
seaside resorts, yet this picture may
quickly be changing.
Due to a rapid increase in drugrelated violence in Mexico, many students are choosing to forgo the tropical
weather ofMexican beaches in favor of
their colder, yet safer, homes. St. Joe's
students Andrew Prosser, 'l2, and Matt
DePietro, 'l2, are doing just this after
their trip to Acapulco, Mexico was canceled.
"We booked our trip last May," said
DePietro. "After all the recent media
and the press about how dangerous
Acapulco was a lot of people changed
their destinations to different places."
According to the BBC, over 34,000
people have been killed in Mexico over
the past four years as a result of drug
cartels' resistance to a government
crackdown on illegal drug trafficking.
Due to the dangers of the trip, as
well as the exodus of college students,
DePietro and Prosser's trip was canceled by Student City, their travel
agency.
"I found out Christmas Eve and this
was a big part of my Christmas present, so in that sense my initialreaction
was 'Oh great, this is going to be a

tourists fleeing the more dangerous

"It was disappointing for sure,
because I went to Cancun the year
before with the same people and that

Yet, many students understand that

Honors acting thesis showcases actresses' talents

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY HENRY KIETZMAN
hkietzml@swarthmore.edu

Edward Albee's "Three Tall Women," which was the

1994 Pulitzer Prize for Drama recipient, details a 92-yearold woman as she reflects on her life. Three actors portray the woman, hercaretaker and her lawyer, and in the
second act turn into time-states of her life: an optimistic
26-year old, an aging 52-year-old, and an elderly 72-yearold. Brian Ratcliffe 'll plays their son. This past weekend,
Swarthmore's Honors Theater majors Eva Amesse 'll,
Nell Bang-Jensen 'll and Isa St. Clair 'll conveyed
Albee's masterpiece as part of their Honors Acting thesis.
The three seniors started planning their thesis last
spring. They were interested in exploring a physical
approach to acting. The Swarthmore theater department
gives students doing Honors preparations the opportunity to work with a guest artist. As actresses, they wanted
to find a female director with experience in acting to lead
their endeavor. Sarah Sanford '99, a member of Pig Iron
Theatre Company since 2002, agreed to the project. With
a director on board, Amesse, Bang-Jensen and St. Clair
looked through several plays and considered doing an
original work, but found themselves returning to Albee's
work after their first reading. "We were interested in
finding a traditional script with very detailed and meaty
parts for actors
a script that was very character driven," Bang-Jensen said.
"We were drawn to it as a play that has a lot of emotional resonance, but gains this emotional resonance
through a really precise and intellectual exploration of
questions that challenge all of us, like, 'How does one live
a life? And how does it mean to live a life?'" St. Clair said.
The play encouraged the actors to embrace a very
physical approach to acting when constructing their
characters. "One thing that excited us is that because the
characters are in their 90s, 70s, 50s, and 20s, it's a production that would not really be down with college students, ordinarily
It was a great challenge. I played a
woman who was 26, so for me, it was finding a very different physicality which was character based," Bang...

Jensen said.
Sanford agreed, saying that most professional theatre
companies avoid taking huge risks, as they don't always
have the time or money for "counter-intuitive casting
choices." "Casting Isa as the 92-year old and Eva as the 52year-old inevitably demanded really focused work on the
bodies of those characters," Sanford said. "Nell, as the
young version of the protagonist, had to embody a hope,
a femininity and a youthfulness that was more germane
to the 1940s than to the youth of today."
The actresses used an "outside-in" style of acting,

Isa St. Clair, playing an elderly woman as Eva Amesse (left) watches on. St. Clair said that playing an older women was
one of the most challenging roles in her acting career.
according to St. Clair, which focused on the finding their
characters' physicalities first and then discovering how
these physicalities related to their character's psychologies. To prepare for her role as an older woman, St. Clair
observed the elderly in her own life and on the Internet
as well as researching osteoporosis. "I really wanted to
find a strong physicality for someone who has little control over her own mind or her own body," St. Clair said.
One distinct aspect of Albee's play is his omission of
names for the characters. The old woman, caretaker and
lawyer are titled A, B and C, respectively, within the
script. Bang-Jensen sees this lack of naming as an interesting way of exploring identity. "I think Albee is pushing at the universal: What does it mean for this woman to
be in her 50s? What does it mean for this woman to be in
her 20s? Instead of being names of individual characters,
we got to explore an age and a place in life instead," BangJensen said.

Albee's work allowed audience members to relate in
some way or another to the three ages represented on
stage. "As three 22 year-olds approaching this play, we all
naturally tend to think that the youngest character is
'right'
[Albee's work forces] every audience member to
project themselves to different parts of theirlives, whether
they had already lived that part or it was in the future," St.
Clair said. The final project was a wonderful culmination
of these actors' three and a half years of work at
Swarthmore. "It's been an incredible experience for me, as
an actor, to really work on precision, and detail, and handle every moment, but also wonderful to work with these
other theater majors. We've had this similar trajectory at
Swarthmore, and this was the culmination of it. And to
have the opportunity to share that is pretty amazing,"
Bang-Jensen said.
With Sanford, each student was given the opportunity
to work with a professional director and fine-tune her
skills. Sanford was impressed with the maturity and confidence each actor displayed when tackling their roles.
"They understood how to receive and interpret notes at a
surprisingly sophisticated level. When you have actors
who can meet a text at that level, it is truly a gift", Sanford
said. The actors learned how to tackle complex roles. "This
Having
was the most challenging role I've ever played
the confidence to address a role as terrifying as this and to
feel sure that I put in as much work as I possibly could to
find her physically and emotionally," St. Clair said.
Bang-Jensen and St. Clair both praised the Swarthmore
theater department for its emphasis on the artistic transformation associated with the process of making plays.
"The way that we approach acting [at Swarthmore] is
incredibly unusual. Most colleges do a very standard
repertory theater style," St. Clair said. "It's very rare for a
small liberal arts college, not a conservatory, to focus on
[all styles of acting] as well as this performance theory
side."
Bang-Jensen hoped that the audiences got the chance
"to explore the universal character in a very thorough and
detailed way beyond that I hope they enjoyed it, I hope
it was entertaining." The play was a way for these students
to share their thesis with friends and loved ones, as well as
to perpetuate a resonating message for college students.
Amelia Kidd 11 said that after the performance, she felt
"drained, but in a good way. I was impressed that they
were able to rehearse it for months because of the pure
emotional intensity." Corey Carmichael 'l4 agreed. "I left
the play enwrapped in the characters, [and] unable to function, in a way." Bang-Jenson elaborated on some of the
reactions audience members exhibited. "It causes people
to step back and thinkabout 'Are you living up to the older
version of yourself that you hope to be, and the younger
version of yourself that you hoped to be? And how have

TV's portrayal of alcohol is realistic, sometimes
Amidst the maelstrom
of controversy that has
been Charlie Sheen's personal life of late, a lot ofcritics havebeen discussing his
portrayal of booze-fueled
playboy Charlie Harper on
the popular CBS sitcom
"Two and a Half Men." A
recent blog post on
Entertainment Weekly's
questioned

whether Charlie Sheen

has "ruined"
Charlie Harper. Mandi Bierly, the author of the post, noted
that "the actor and the character have finally become separate," with Sheen's hate-fueled rants and dangerous
behavior tainting his portrayal of the lovable Charlie

Harper.

For me, the most interesting point to draw from this
article is that Charlie Sheen is basically portraying in
"Two and a Half Men" a toned-down version of his real
self. The show's Charlie Harper is rarely seen without a
drink in hand, is a compulsive gambler, and is constantly
bedding a string of gorgeous women. This portrayal of
alcohol got me thinking: does television treat excessive
consumption of alcohol too lightly? Just how is alcohol
portrayed on television, and what does that portrayal tell
viewers about the pros and cons of drinking?
I think that, in general, portrayals of alcohol on television fall into one of two categories: drinking as a nonstop fun-fest, drinking as a symptom of depression, of
rebellion, or all three. In general, comedies tend to fall into
the first category, while serious dramas and any show
aimed at teenagers fall into the second. I'm certainly not
denying that these aren't two perfectly accurate aspects of
drinking; as a college student, I've witnessed both selfdestructive drinking and fun, social drinking. However,
alcohol is much more complicated and cannot simply be
bottled in either of these two extremes. TV shows are
doing viewers (particularly the young, impressionable
ones) a disservice by ignoring the complexity of the issue.
Several shows with teenage audiences believe that
they should address the dangers of underage drinking,
which is a legitimate and even admirable impulse.

that address drinking tend to treat alcohol as a social
lubricant that makes the parties better and the girls prettier. Any number of shows that are set in or often venture
to a particular bar or pub, such as "Cheers" and "How I
Met Your Mother," as well as the Courtney Cox vehicle
"Cougartown," and of course "Two and a HalfMen" have
mentioned this. Since these shows are aimed at adult audiences who can presumably make their own judgments
about alcohol, it's not such a problem. However,

College students have been an attractive demographic to banks for a long time
because students have few financial ties.
Banks compete to provide students with
credit cards and bank accounts in hopes
that students will come back to the banks
when they need mortgages and car loans.
Companies offer free gifts such as T-shirts,
coffee mugs, pizza, and even iPods to
attract students and then, to encourage
them to fill out an application on the spot.
Each salesman who receives about $l5
for every filled-out application offers lowto-zero interest rates that later spike to
almost 24 percent once the promotional period ends. Credit card companies love to target the financially unsawy, also known as
the first-time credit card holders. According
to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group,
more than halfofAmerican college students
sign up for at least four credit cards by the
time they graduate, and the average senior
racks up more than $2,500 in credit card
debt before entering the "real world."
In the first two installments of my credit series, we learned that opening multiple
credit cards simultaneously lowers your

there are errors on your credit report that
can deny you a loan or a credit card when
you really need one? Some common errors

Ifyou find yourself in this situation, here
are some steps to take when disputing cred-

it errors. First, contact the credit bureaus

(TransUnion, Experian or Equifax) and the
company that reported the item to them.
Addresses and instructions on filing a complaint can be found on these websites.
Second, write to the creditor whoreported
the item and ask that they provide you with
written proof that the correct or corrected
information was sent to the credit bureau.
Third, explain why the item is incorrect
and attach any documentation you have
that supports your claim. If the account has
been paid, include a copy of the canceled
check. If a loan amount is listed incorrectly,
send a copy of the original agreement.

Fourth, ask that the item be removed or
corrected to reflect the correct information.
Attach copies of the credit report and the documents that support your claim and place
them in an envelope withyour letter.Be sure
to make copies of all paperwork and keep
them in a safe place.
Fifth, pay extra for return receipt service from the post office for proof that the
company received your letter.
Sixth, call the creditor and creditbureau if

federal Eair Credit Reporting Act requires
credit reporting agencies to investigate and
respond to all complaints from consumers.
Surveys show that about 80 percent of
credit reports contain errors. Even though
Swarthmore offers us the Franklin Mint
Federal Credit Union card without a credit
check, it is important for us to clear our
reports of errors for the future when faced
with deals from major card issuers. It is
imperative for vulnerable students to scrutinize the offers so that we are not trapped

Freeman said at the beginning of the presentation. He
spoke ofhis struggle to choose a major at Swarthmore and
explained that even when he finally chose English literature, he was not sure exactly what to do with it. Even
though Freeman had never considered working in publishing, after being rejected from several positions, he
finally found an assistant position at Hyperion Press, a
publishing firm in New York City. The position acted as a
catalyst for Freeman's future career in publishing. "It was
only because of failure that I ended up doing what I'm
doing now," Freeman said. He stressed the importance of
continuing to work hard despite repeated failure by sharing stories of intimidating bosses and the struggle to familiarize himself with literature he knew very little about.
Chair of the English Department, Professor Peter
Schmidt organized the event, and had Freeman as a student in his courses. "We thought John's story of what he

List Gallery artist's work expresses nature's complexities
BY STEVEN HAZEL
shazell@swarthmore.edu

Five times a year, the List Gallery
unveils exhibitions that highlight local and

nationally renowned artists. Yesterday,
March 3, the gallery debuted Andrea
Packard's exhibition "Composing Nature,"
which focuses on finding a deeper meaning

within the natural world.
The director of the List Gallery since
1995, Packard is also a Swarthmore alum.
She graduated as an English major with an
art history minor, since the college did not
yet permit students to take more than five
classes in the arts or major in art.
However, during her time at Swarthmore,
she fell in love with the studio arts and
decided to pursue her artistic passion at
the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts, later receiving a Masters in fine arts
from American University. "I felt tremendous immersion and fascination [at the
Academy]. I decided to dive into arts. I
enjoyed studying and I got good feedback,"
Packard said.
Fifteen years ago, the Swarthmore Art
Department invited Packard to serve as
the director of the new List Gallery. "[lt
has been] a wonderful place to have work
that directly informs my artistic inclination. I learn something; new with each
artist," Packard said. "I try to offer them

the textures suggest the direction that the
composition will go." Packard receives
much of the material she uses from friends
or local artists, and thus, each work carries
a meaning and sense of community. "I am
struck by her ability to balance her compositions in a way that simultaneously
captures thedenseness of memory and the
poise and harmony of the natural world.
Her pieces are mosaic like-- containing an
incredible range of colors and textures
which give them a luminous quality," said
Nina Pelaez, the List Gallery Intern.
Packard's exhibition will run until
April 3. "[The List Gallery] is one of my
favorite parts of Swarthmore. The chance
to see local artists' work in the middle of
our campus always encourages me to
reflect on the diverse nature of our community," Casey Perrara 14 said Since she
is the director of the List Gallery, Packard
is often a voice in decisions about which
exhibitions will visit Swarfhnipre and will
most inspire students and staff. "For me
making these works prompts a kind of
reflection and reverie about the nature of
memory and our relationship with
nature," Packard said. "I Would hope
[viewers] engage longer in a space and a
relationship with nature."

beyond us, it is now composed." Growing
up in the forest landscape of New England,
Packard remembers the feeling of being
surrounded by nature and the woods. "A
person's aesthetic has a lot to do with the
place where they grew up," she said. The
natural complexity of the woods permeates
Packard's work and is represented by the
complicated patterns and layering of fabrics that intermingle to create patterns
that draw the eye. "[When I look at the natural world] I don't see tidiness or simplicity. I see a rotting tree giving birth to new
seeds. Nature is complicated. Nature is
messy. I try to include both aspects of
nature in my work," Packard said.
In addition to nature, Packard believes
that the actual textures and fabrics ofher

thought, "It's a good thing everybody
took their cues from Nicolas Cage on this
one."
It doesn't hurt that the third dimension, if there has to be one, actually gets
put to use. Lussier, whose "My Bloody

art of making deadly weapons look like

much, not since Cage played his character's fictitious brother in "Adaptation"

'the body in lines' explores the sources of identity

swarthmorephoenix.com

BYSERAJEONG

sjeongX@swarthmore.edu

On March Ist, choreographer and educator Shavon
Norris presented "the body in lines," a work she choreographed as part of the Swarthmore Project, which is
administered by the department ofmusic and dance to support the creation of new works of dance. Associate in
Performance Jon Sherman explained that the department
picks young choreographers to visit campus, along with
three to five dancers, to create new work to be performed
for the Swarthmore community.
Three dancers, Mina Estrada, Les Rivera and Associate
in Performance at Swarthmore College, C. Kemal Nance,
performed Norris' work. The performance explored
whether identity is shaped by self-perceptions or external
impressions. In the beginning of the performance, Norris
addressed the audience and explored the topic by asking a
series of questions: "Who are you? What are you? Who does
the world say you are? What does the world say you are?"
This modern dance piece incorporated elements of theatre
as dangers presented short monologues, and also performed to a soundtrack of voice recording and music.
Although Norris took dance classes since the age of five,
she did not anticipate a future in dance. When her uncle,
also her first dance teacher, passed away when she was in
high school, Norris explained that she needed a break from
dancing. "I couldn't make sense of losing him and still
dancing. So I let [dancing] go for a little bit," she said.
As an undergraduate she attained her BA, majoring in
Biology at Manhattanville College. Norris considered a
career as a doctor, but after completing her undergraduate
studies, she decided to work as a legal assistant, and then
as a college academic counselor. It was not until the attack
on the World Trade Center on September 11th that Norris
consideredthe possibility of pursuing a professional career
in dance. "9/11 shook [the desire to dance] within me. It
gave me a lot of clarity," said Norris.
Once she decided to follow her passion, Norris began
her journey for a Master of Fine Arts in dance at Temple
University. Since completing her MFA, Norris has showcased her work at the 2010 Philadelphia Live Arts and
Fringe Festival and the National Constitutional Center.
Along with being a choreographer, Norris is a
Dance/Movement teacher at Independence Charter School
in Center City, Philadelphia. As an educator of children
from kindergarten to fifth grade, she believes it is important to teach children how to move their bodies. Norris
teaches about movement by building children's fine and
gross motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Also she

introduces them to other disciplines, such as yoga.
For Norris, video games and sedentary lifestyles inhibit children and prevent them from living more active lives.
"They don'tknow how to express themselves through their
bodies in an appropriate ways. They're either too aggressive or [too reserved]," Norris said. "I think [movement]
gives a chance for kids to reinvent themselves."
While Norris encourages her students to reinvent themselves within the classroom, she encourages her dancers to
convey their identities on stage. Norris explained that the
body in lines originated from "images of people contemplating who they were and what they thought the world
saw and believed." Specifically, the African-American
Baptist church tradition of testifying inspired Norris in
creating her choreography. For Norris, when a person
speaks to the rest of the congregation about an experience,
it builds connections between people. "[Sharing a testimonial] makes the person seem real, valuable, and we become
connected," said Norris.
Similar to this sharing of testimonies, her dance piece
exposed her dancers' identities on a very personal level.
Rather than dictate the choreography, Norris chose to
work collectively with her dangers. This unorthodox
method of choreography included interviewing her

dancers with questions about their identities. Then, the

dancers worked with Norris to translate their verbal
answers into physical dance form.
Dance major Jalisa Roberts 'l3, who has taken classes in
composition and history/theory of dance, attended the performance. "I loved [the body in lines]. It relates a lot to theories I'm exploring such as identity and perception," said
Roberts.
Though the study of a natural science might not seem
relevant to dance, Norris believes the two are complementary. Her background in biology served as another considerable source of inspiration of the body in lines. "[The choreography was inspired by] what the body retains, what
the body remembers, how our physical appearances interact with our history and cultures, the way we move and
sound," Norris said.
Associate in Performance at Swarthmore College Jon
Sherman believes that the appeal of "the body in lines" lies
in Norris' choreography having "substance." Also, he
believes Norris chose "really wonderful, mature dancers."
For Sherman, a successful dance piece always has good
dangers and good choreography. Putting it simply,
Sherman explained that "any work that has been well executed is always interesting."

Rumors disrupt progress of Town Center West
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MAURICE G. ELDRIDGE
meldridl@swarthmore.eclu

In the two weeks since the College's Board of

Managers approved the Town Center West project, a
number of rumors and misperceptions have arisen.
We want to take the opportunity to
correct some of these misimpressions.

ilM

west, join us for one of the public conversations listed
on- the website or email towncenterwest@swarthmore.edu
Rumor: The College has refused to meet with the student group, Swarthmore Labor Action Project (SLAP),
refused to recognize their concerns, and refused to pass
those concerns along to the Board of Managers.
President Chopp and a number of senior administrators have met with SLAP numerous times during
the course of the last year. SLAP's request that the
College sign a neutrality agreement was made clear to
the Board of Managers and they have been fully
briefed on SLAP's request. The Board, the administration and SLAP are all in agreement on the following principles: fair labor practices, providing a safe
and productive work environment, nonharrassment
of employees by those both internal and external to
the community, and the right of employees to unionize. The open question is: should the inn and restaurant employees have the right to determine via private ballot if they want a union and, if so, which union
they might wish to join? SLAP prefers a "card check"
method of organizing and a commitment to a particu-

lar union without the right to a private ballot.
Rumor: In refusing to sign a neutrality agreement,
Swarthmore clearly does not care about conditions for
workers, does not support the right of workers to unionize and does not care that our community cares deeply
about these issues.
The College has a long history of creating positive
working conditions for its employees including good
salary and benefit packages and good relationships
between management and staff. Further, the College
supports employees' right to organize and is committed to ensuring an atmosphere that is free of threats
and intimidation by any party. The College understands that there are multiple ways to create productive work environments and to protect the rights of
workers. We believe our community standards provide a healthy, safe and productive work environment
for our staff. With that said, if future employees of an
inn or restaurant were interested in forming a union,
or if any employees were interested in pursuing this
path, we will respect their right to do so. The College
remains committed to fairness for all who work on
our campus. We do not believe that the administration, students, faculty or a third party should determine the staffs destiny, but rather that the staff itself
should determine that destiny in a positive atmosphere free of coercion or undue pressure from any
party.
Rumor: The College imposed its will on the Borough
of Swarthmore in 2001 when an exception was made
allowing the College to apply for a liquor license on its
campus (and in conjunction with the development of an
inn.)

Borough residents can, will, and should determine
whether or not they want a dry or wet town, or
whether they wish to allow for an exception in the
case of the inn, or any other establishment seeking an
exception. In 2001 Borough residents determined that
making an exception to its "dry" status for this hotel
and restaurant was sensible given its desire that the
Town Center West project succeed and contribute to
the revitalization efforts underway in the Borough's
commercial district. A liquor license will make the
inn and restaurant more appealing to visitors and will
contribute to the financial viability of the project.
When the Borough voted on this measure in 2001 it did
so with the goal to control the quality and scale of the
operation. In effect it entrusted to the College the mandate to ensure that the establishment would adhere to
strict liquor law enforcement and that it would
enhance, rather than diminish the quality of life for
Borough residents. If Borough residents wish to revisit this issue, of course we respect their right to make
this determination at the ballot box.
Rumor: The College is going to spend enormous
amounts of money on this project that will come at the
expense of other College priorities.
The Board of Managers endorsed this proposal
because it is not expected that this project will be paid
from College operating funds. Individual donors have
already expressed interest in different parts of this
project and funds are not expected to be diverted from
other College priorities. Other funding will be sought
through grants from external agencies.

and community relations.

the anti-choice group Life Always took
to the streets of New York to broadcast
their fear mongering message.
The now-removed billboard read,
"The most dangerous place for an

Americans into believing a woman's

Their diatribe comes on the heels of an
aggressive effort to cut federal funding

like Planned Parenthood.
While Life Always claims to be concerned about "unborn" people of color,
from a look at their website, the conservative group does not seem too
invested in black life here on Earth.
I am skeptical of any organization
that claims to care about "the black
community" but pays no attention to
institutionalized poverty, lack of access
to effective health care and a cycle of
oppression that remands poor people of

backwards social scene. It took a few nights of such
debauchery to realize I was starting to feel a little flabby (and absurd) and since I finally had some girls feeling up and down my body I needed to get it in shape.

turned the weightroom into a monkey zone swinging
on pull up bars, jumping all over the place, contorting
our faces and gritting our teeth, as if that would somehow make it easier, all the while hooting and hollering for a brutal 26 minutes, while turning our bodies

Despite absence of Crosby, the NHL will live on
February has come
and gone without the
reemergence of a familiar
face: Sidney Crosby. After
sustaining a hit to the
head during the Winter
Classic and another in
the following
game,
Crosby has been out for
22 games with a concussion. But if Crosby has
been missing from the
Hannah Purkey
ice, he certainly has not

been missing from the
papers. Journalists have
been lamenting the loss of
Crosby almost as much as
Crosby himself, painting bleak pictures of untouched
gear left hanging in the locker room and a pale Crosby
not able to spend time in the sun. Bruce Arther of the
National Post summed up the general feelings of the
press on the subject with the headline "NHL should be
terrified of threat to Crosby."
Should the NHL feel bad for Crosby? Sure. Should
the Penguins be worried about contending for the
Stanley Cup without him? Definitely. But terrified?
That may be pushing it. Despite the National Post's
hailing of Crosby as the only player this season to be
able to "transcend the league," Crosby is still just one
player. Yes, he has been one of the best players on the
ice these past few seasons, but the NHL existed long
before Crosby graced it with his presence, and will
survive after he has stopped playing, whenever that
day may be (which, of course, we all hope is after a
long and healthy career). While I feel for Crosby and
the unfortunate situation he is in, the press has been
treating his injury like hockey Armageddon and it is
uncalled for. To prove it, here are just a few of the
many reasons why hockey will outlive Sidney Crosby.

selves and the teams they play for. It may have league
executives and agents scrambling to keep players in
check, but Twitter has done more to bring in young
fans than even Crosby has. Players keep finding new
ways to use this social medium, and not just off the ice.
In an incident that must have made league officials
cringe earlier this season, St. Louis Blues enforcer
Cam Janssen challenged Dallas Stars' Krys Barch via
Twitter to a fight the next time they met, which Barch
quickly accepted. It is unclear how this online challenge fits with the league's penalty for instigating
fights, but it is sure to sell a few tickets to the next
match between these two teams.
The best (or worst, depending on how you look at it)
use of Twitter, however, has to go to the Phoenix
Coyotes' Paul Bissonnettee, better known online as
BizNasty. BizNasty's crude and ridiculous updates are
the source of more gossip than his play will ever produce. Sometimes in the form of poetry ("packing for
Arizona. Passport, check. Money and credit cards,
check. Speeeeeeedo, never leave home without it.
Wish it had pockets"), or sometimes photography
(notably, his odd obsession with posting photos of the
homeless men he comes across), Biz Nasty's tweets are
always works of art. Unfortunately, his account was
temporarily closed after a reference to Ilya Kovalchuk
as a communist. But don't worry; Biz Nasty is back to
his usual shenanigans with BizNasty2pointO.
But even more so than their use of Twitter, hockey
players have captured the undying love of fans via
Youtube. Take, for example, the Belfast Giants, a member of the Elite Ice Hockey League in the UK. To
encourage fans to come out to their post-holiday
games, the players taped a music video to Maria
Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You," which featured the team lip syncing and performing a choreographed dance that was later posted on YouTube.
Watch it; you'U seriously consider buying a ticket to
the UK to see them in person.

They have harnessed the power of the Internet

The up and comers

More so than athletes in any other sport, hockey
players have figured out how to use the Internet to
their advantage. Players and fans alike have used
blogs, tweets and YouTube videos to promote them-

It's not just the current NHLers that are making
waves on the Internet, but also the rookies and next
generation of hockey talent. Oilers' rookie Linus
Omark stirred up some controversy this past

Courtesy of http://twitter.com/biznasty2pointO

Phoenix Coyotes Paul Bissonnettee's Twitter updates
include a variety of crude and hilarious gossip tweets.
December when in his first NHL game he scored the
winning shootout goal with a spin-o-rama that left veterans on the losing Tampa Bay team a little annoyed.
While many called it disrespectful and showy, this one
move exhilarated fans, not to mention that the sensation it caused on the Internet couldn't have hurt the
Oilers' ticket sales. Rookies that are pushing the
boundaries of conventional hockey may upset some of
the older players who are set in their ways, but it
could also bring in new fans and revive the old ones.
Canada
No, seriously. Canada will ensure that Crosby will
be able to watch hockey games from his retirement
home; I guarantee it. While the majority of the teams
in the NHL are located in the US, the majority of the
players are Canadian and I wouldn't be surprised if
the majority of the fans are too. Hockey in Canada is
just short of a religion, so there is no way that
Canadians will allow hockey to end because one player gets hurt, even if it is one of their very own (that's
right, Crosby is Canadian). In fact, Canadians only
want the league to grow larger. Quebec hockey fans
want an NHL team back in their city so bad, that they
actually went and tried to kidnap one.
Ok, maybe not kidnap, but it was close.
In December, fans calling themselves Nordiques
Nation, after the team that used to be in Quebec, gathered over 1,000 people and bused them down to a game
between the Islanders and the Thrashers, two NHL
teams with the lowest attendance records, in an
attempt to prove to the NHL Commissioner that they
were worthy of a team. On top of this show of enthusiasm, the city has raised over $3lO million dollars to
build a new arena for a team that doesn't even exist
yet.
If they are willing to go to such lengths to add
another Canadian team to the league, I can't imagine
what they would do if the entire league was actually in
danger.

Down but not out

March-3,'2011

And let's not forget that Sidney Crosby is not the
first superstar to dominate the NHL; I'm pretty sure
Wayne Gretzky would have something to say about
that. Nicknamed "the Great One," Gretzky set most of
the records Crosby is going to spend his career chasing. It takes quite the player to have your jersey number retired by every team in the NHL. When he
stopped playing, many mourned what they felt was the
end of an era. But just because he wasn't lacing up,
didn't mean that Gretzky was out of hockey altogether.
Over the years he has remained a huge part of the
NHL, as a coach and part owner of the Phoenix
Coyotes and as a mentor to up and coming players.
Just as Gretzky did, I'm sure Crosby will find a way to
stay involved in hockey long after he stops putting on
a uniform.
Hockey may be missing one of its superstars at the
moment, but that is no reason to break into the emergency supplies. It's only a matter of time before
Crosby is back on the ice, but even if that takes longer
than expected, hockey will go on. It takes more than
one player to bring down the sport Urban Dictionary
defines as, "The best and most entertaining sport out
there. Period."

BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's tennis team fell 8-1 on
Sunday when they traveled to number, eight nationally
ranked Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. The team now
holds a 1-1 record on the season.
Rosie DuÃrin 'l2 brought in the only point for the
Garnet, defeating Carnegie Mellon's Alexandra Tapak in
the number three singles match. DuÃrin fell in the first
set 6-3, but rallied in the second set with a score of 6-4 and
won the tiebreaker 10-7.
However, the Tartans kept Swarthmore from winning
more matches, dominating the rest of the singles matches and taking all of the doubles matches.
The team knew they were entering a match against a
tough team, having lost against Carnegie Mellon in the
2009-2010 season. However, the team felt it was a good
learning experience in competitive play. "We saw what
we need to work on, what we are lacking in practice,"
senior captain Luann Cignavitch said.
Cignavitch said that the team needs to work on doubles strategy, but said that the team needs to improve oncourt mentality primarily, crediting the Tartans with better on-court mentality. "We need to work on our court
awareness and fine tune our practices toward these

the season.
Head Coach Jeremy Loomis said that the team tended
to get behind by a wide margin before they really got
"into a better rhythm" in the match. "I like our resolve
and fight, especially Rosie's match, but we need to have
better focus from the outset so we can put pressure on the
teams to stay with us rather than us trying to fight and
claw back into the match," Loomis said. .
"A lot of the matches were closer than the score indicated," Kelsey Johnson 'l3 said. Johnson, who played
number four singles and number two doubles with
Cignavitch, added that the team needs to be more aggressive in future matches and bring more energy to the
court. "I think we can do better. It was a good start, but
we have work to do," she said.
"I never felt that we were outmatched, but they did
some small details better than us which made it tough for
us to execute our shots," Loomis said. Loomis expressed
his feelings of joy at having seen the team play such a
tough opponent, agreeing that it was a learning experience for the team.
In terms of the continuing matches of the season,
Loomis said that if the team learns from the loss on
Sunday and improves their play strategy, future matches

will prove to have a better outcome. He hopes the team
win, saying that is the ultimate goal, and knows it is up
to the team to take the initiative.
The team is travelling to South Carolina during
Spring Break and they will compete in matches with
teams outside of the Centennial Conference. Cignavitch
and Johnson believe the trip will be good practice for the
team, and that playing with new teams is good playing

experience.
Cignavitch said the matches would be good for the
players who have not had any court time so far this season, and to prepare to play in the Conference matches
after Spring Break. "The more you play, the better you
play in high pressure [matches]," Cignavitch said. For
the first-years, who make up half of the ten-player team,
gaining play experience is important, since they will be
the majority of the team next year and the Conference is
tough. The team is young this year, but Cignavitch
believes the team is strong with a solid lineup.
The team will need to be ready for the Conference this
year, after making it to the Championships and losing to
Johns Hopkins. Cignavitch feels confident that the trip to
South Carolina and a deep team will help the team reach
Championships for the second consecutive year. "With
the potential we have in this team we could beat Hopkins
this year," Cignavitch said.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Former Penn player youngest NCAA head coach
BY JOE SANFILIPPO
dailypennsylvanian.com, Mar. X 2011

Before 30-year-old Andy Toole was
introduced as Robert Morris University's
newest basketball coach last spring, he
had a "humbling" moment.
While showing his mother around
campus, Toole was asked by an admissions officer if he was there for the
prospective freshman tour.
His youthful looks have led to a number of humorous moments during his
coaching tenure
including being misbut he's no stranger
taken for a player
to leading teams.
As Penn's co-captain in 2002-2003, Toole
guided the Quakers to an undefeated Ivy
League record and their second consecu-

tive NCAA Tournament berth.
Just seven years later, Toole's responsibilities have grown leading not just a
team, but a program, as the youngest
NCAA Division I coach in the nation.
No one who knows Toole was surprised
he got the opportunity, though it might
have come a bit earlier than expected.
"Age didn't really factor into [his hiring]," said Craig Coleman, athletic director at RMU. "When you look at him, you
think he's 2L When you listen to him, you
think he's 40."
That wise-beyond-his-years quality is
something Toole's been honing since he
was five years old, when he started shooting hoops at the local YMCA.
As a high-school player at Christian
Brothers Academy in Lincroft, N.J., Toole
needed three years to crack the starting
rotation.
But before ever making that start, he
signed to play basketball at Elon
University. Then, after two years in North
Carolina, he wanted a change.
By chance, childhood friend and former AAU teammate Dave Klatsky was the
starting point guard for Penn. Klatsky
helped Toole get on then-coach Fran
Dunphy's radar.
After a campus visit to watch the
Quakers win the Ivy title at the Palestra,
Toole was sold.
"Coach Dunphy always said he was
getting ready to start recruiting me and I
committed [to Elon]," Toole said. "I don't
know how true that is or not, but that's

THE.PHOENIX

what he always tells me."
In two years as a Penn starter, Toole
racked up All-Ivy and All Big-5 honors
each season, while leading the Quakers to
a 6-3 Big 5 record and 47-13 overall.
Upon graduation, there was no question Toole would pursue hoops the only
uncertainty was in what capacity.
Despite an offer to play professionally
in Turkey, he stuck close to home and
helped manage facilities and organize
tournaments for companies like The Hoop
Group in New Jersey.
With such exposure to local talent,

Toole created a network ofbasketball contacts and gained real-world experience
that would pay dividends as a future
coach.
"I tell people all the time it was almost
like going to grad school for basketball,"

Toole has managed to steer the Colonials
to a 16-13 record, while starting mainly
freshmen and sophomores.
"Forget the youngest coach in Division
I, we may have the youngest team in
Division I," Coleman noted.
Coleman lauded Toole's work thus far
and is optimistic about what's to come.
He's not the only one.
"I think the future is as bright for him
as anybody that I know," said Dunphy of
his former player. "He's a good man and a
good basketball man and [he'll be] a terrific coach for a lot of years."
Toole was described as relentless by
his former colleague, Rice, who said his
preparation is unmatched when it comes

to practice or games.

With a wealth of experience at such a
tender age, there is no clear precedent to
predict how Toole will fare at the Division
I level.
But a year after Butler went to the
national championship with a 33-year-old
coach, age is just a number.
"The goal is to continue to elevate the
notoriety of Robert Morris basketball
and get to the NCAA Tournament as
many times as we can," Toole said. "I have
guys that are willing to do whatever it
takes to make our players and our program successful."
Sooner or later, people will start recognizing Andy Toole.
...

GARNET ATHLETE OF THE WEEK

Toole explained.

Maybe the most important contact he
made was Mike Rice, current coach at
Rutgers. In 2007, Rice landed the top spot
at RMU, where he didn't forget his old
friend.
"When I got to Robert Morris, [Andy]
was my first call," Rice said.
Toole had spent a year as an assistant
under Fran O'Hanlon
also a former
at Lafayette and
Dunphy assistant
jumped at the chance to work alongside
Rice. In three years as a tandem at RMU,
Toole and Rice won the Northeast conference each year, compiling 73 wins and two
NCAA bids.
After Rice left for Rutgers, the RMU
administration decided to keep the hiring
process internal, promoting Toole to head
coach.
"All those impressions that I had when
he first started had been reinforced hundreds of times in those three years [under
Rice]," Coleman said.
When Toole was introduced as coach in
May of 2010, he was still 29. Though he
was well aware of the age distinction, he
insists it's not something he thinks about,
unless prompted.
"I can't forget because every time I talk
to somebody in the media, they always
remind me," Toole said. "It's nice to have
that distinction but it doesn't help you
win any games, it doesn't help you land
