Students Should be Wary of Scholarship Search Services
Scholarship search services
swindle up to 300,000
students each year
By

Toki Rkhdkk

"Regardless of your prior grades or test
scores, you can win your share of $6.6 billion
dollars ofunclaimed scholarship money! Win
more than $5OO in aid for college, or your
money back!"
Do these promises sound too good to be
true? They probably are, according to the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has
recently launched a two-pronged program to
stop scholarship search services from making "fraudulent and deceptive claims." According to Mark Kantrowitz, a consumer
advocate who maintains "The Financial Aid

Information Page" (http://www.finaid.org/),
100to 200 scholarship search services swindle
up to 300,000 students each year.
In order to fight these scam artists who
exploit anxiety about rising college costs, the
FTC has filed charges against five scholarship services who have allegedly bilked students and families out of $lO million in the
past three years: Career Assistance Planning,
Inc., Student Assistance Services, Inc., College Assistance Services, Inc., Student Aid
Incorporated, and various search services
operated by Christopher Ebere Nwaigwe.
Currently, these companies are being run by
court-appointed receivers. The courts have
also frozen company assets in order to preserve funds for consumer redress. The FTC
hopes to eventually bring these cases to trial
or negotiate settlements with each defendant.
The second component of FTC's Project
scholarscam is a nationwide campaign to

educate consumers about how to recognize a
scam. Consumers should be wary of services
which ask for money up front, which request
checking account and credit card information, and which make money back guarantees.

Even if the organization claims to be a
member of the Better Business Bureau, consumers should know that the 888 does not
endorse or recommend any business, and
does not allow its members to advertise the

fact oftheir membership.
According to Kantrowitz, the common
claim that $6.6 billion of scholarship money
is unclaimed each year is a myth. It is based
on a misinterpretation of an old congressionalreport which calculated thetotal amount
of unclaimed scholarship funds set aside by
companies for the families of their employees. Most students are not eligible to receive
this money.

Kantrowitz' research shows thatthe amount
of private sector aidavailable is much smaller
than these scholarship services contend.Less
than 5 percent of all aid comes from private
sources and less than $1 million is unclaimed
every year.
Laura Talbot, director offinancial aid, said
that $620,000 (3.9%) ofall financial aid that
Swarthmore students receive comes from
private sources. She also emphasized that
students "don't have to pay [for scholarship
searches]...it shouldn't cost anything."
Dallas Martin, president of the National
Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, also stated that students don't
really need search services when information
is availableforfree from financial aid offices,

public libraries, and on-line services.
For example, a free search service, called
Fastweb, takes your personal profile and
matches it with scholarships from their data-

base. This on-line service can be found at
http://www.studentservices.eom//fastweb/.
The bottom line is, "If there is a guarantee
that you can get a scholarship, you can be 90
percent sure it's a scam," said Jodie Bernstein,
director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer
Protection. After these scams receive your
"application fee," they will send information
of little value, such as lists of out-of-date
scholarships for which you do not qualify. In
other instances, they require students to apply for all of these scholarships and present
40-60 rejection letters in order to receive a

refund.
If you are unsure whether a scholarship
search service is a scam, check with someone
in the Financial Aid Office or your local
Better Businessßureau. For more information, check the following webpages: http://

Coming

Being Out at Swat:
A First-Year's View
By

Julie Levin Russo

I

first encountered the Swarthmore
Queer Union (SQU), then called
LBGTA, whenI was visiting Swarthmore last April. Spec Weekend was a
bizarre experience in homecoming, celestially expansiveyet vacuous: therewere
so many dungs that I realized on sight
were already apart of me. But as a nonstudent I was fundamentally an outsider,
profoundly removed from this world that
I knew I wanted to be enveloped by. I've
heard first-year students say that adjusting to the word "queer" is difficult; when
I saw "Welcome Queer Specs" emblazoned on the side of Tarble, I understood
immediately and effortlessly its purpose
and connotation; I adopted it naturally to
fill the space I'd unconsciously had waiting for it I hadn't yet decided, then, how
aggressively I wanted to be out in college,
if at all—especially at first. I was just
starting to come out at my high school,
and it was exciting and basically uneventful, yet still fraught and intense, because
I didn't feel I could expect opinions of me
not tobeprofoundly affected. But I wanted
so badly to feel integrated into Swat that
I decided I had to make use of every
ready-made community at my disposal,
including the queer one.
When I arrived at Swarthmore, I discovered that the experience of Orientation is very differentfrom the experience
of spec-ing: it is profoundly inclusive. I
discovered that communities based on a
commonality oran interest developaround

you slowly, and it's the group of people
you live with who are your instant circle.
I think I imagined a "queer community"
to be something whole, unique, separate,
and automatic. But communities at
Swarthmore tendto be nebulous and permeable by nature, SQU being no exception. At the first SQU meetings, I discoveredthat the overwhelming mood I experienced was one of awkwardness, of reluctance to speak to people lest my inten-

tions be misconstrued, rather than one of
instant inauguration and acceptance. It
wasn't until the first SQU social function—a party at the Barn—that I began to
feel integrated intoany sort of queer community, welcomed and warmed to in a
personal sense. After that, once I had
some minimal history with people, it was
easier to speak to them, to continue the
process of wriggling my way into their
social fabric. But my sense of belonging
is still deeply conflicted. If theBarn party
was the one at which I've felt most ac-

cepted thus far, it was another SQU party
at which I felt most uncomfortable.
SQU people are some of the most wonderful, warm, amusing, interesting, and
downright adorable individuals I've met,
but I'm acutely aware that none of my
nascent bonds with them are reliable. The
queer community at Swarthmore isincestuously small,and harbors within its smallness a diverse microcosm: it's an attempt
to build a community out of people who
have nothing in common other than tile

Student Council Splits
Into Working Groups
By

Josh Kramer

Student Council voted unanimously to split
into a number of general purpose working
committees this week following a proposal
by Alyssa Ray man-Read '99. The Council
decided there would be three people in each
committee; the committees will be able to
select which tasks they will perform.
Giridhar Srinivasan '9B at one point objected to the procedure, but not the principle,
of the selectionprocess for thesecommittees.
He said he "would feel more comfortable
working with some members [of Student
Council]" because he had worked with them
in the past, although he did not object to
collaborating with other members.
Srinivasan eventually, at the behest of the

Council, retracted his objections and the council split into the following groups: Edgar Lee
'9B, William Nessly '99 and Andrew Lund
'99; Srinivasan, Sean Barney '9B and Jessica
McFarland '9B; Seth Harvey '97, Rachel
Henighan '97 and Chris Seaman '99; Josh
Alloy '9B, JudeUzonwanne'9B andßaymanRead.
Student Council also discussed using paper balloting to increase voter turnout, which
was unanimously supported.
Commenting on Student Council's relation to the press, Rayman-Read commented
that she wanted "Student Council not to be
the news, rather shape the news...l don't
want articles in The Phoenix on what hasn't
been done. I'd rather see what Student Council has done.. .what we have accomplished."

Simeone Begins Advising Students
By

For the approximately three hundred
Swarthmore students interested in a career in
the Health Sciences, Health ScienceAdvisor Dr. GigiSimeone,
is a very important person. In
her first year at Swarthmore,
Simeone replaces Barbara
Stewart, who retired last year.
As Health Science Advisor,

After the presidential debate this Sunday
in Hartford, Connecticut, most analysts
had only positive things to say about the
performances ofPresident Bill Clinton and
Bob Dole. The real surprise of the night
was Dole's presentation, because expectations for him were low. Instead of projecting a dour persona, Dole let the public see
his sense of humor which had both the
audience and Clinton laughing.
The two candidates touched upon a variety ofissues: drugs, taxes, and education to

many differences exist between his vision
of foreign policy and Clinton's. Women
were mentioned once in the context of the
newly passed health care reform bill preventing "drive-by deliveries" by requiring
a 48-hour hospital stay.
Another distinguishing feature of this
debate was the lack of questions about
personality and character. Dole only once
attempted to attack Clinton when he challenged him to explain his stance on issuing
pardons in the Whitewater case. AfterClinton responded that he would not give any-

Simeonehas spent the last twenty-one years

of her life working with college students, the
last seventeen were at the University ofPennsylvania. For the last seven years, she served
as the director of residential life for the university.
Simeone came to Swarthmore because she
was "aware of the benefits of a small, intense
liberal arts college." Also, she says that the
University of Pennsylvania was "so big. I
didn't have the opportunity to work with
students which is why I began working at
college."
Thus far, Swarthmore students have met
all ofher expectations. Said Simeone, "They
are all great. They have been so smart, accomplished, and dedicated. It's been a pleasure."
Although new to Swarthmore College,
Simeone is not new to the Swarthmore community. Both she and her husband, a faculty
member and writer at the University of Delaware, live with their two daughters in the
borough of Swarthmore.
Simeone has also taken steps to improve
communication with students interested in
careers in health sciences. She has sent out a
survey to students, asking what sort of function she should serve to them. Simeone's
office is located on the first floor of Martin.

Gay and
Graduating

A closer look at the views ofmembers of Swarthmore's
gay, lesbian and bisexual community in honor of
Coming Out Week.

Submissions coordinated by Chy Spain 'OO.

Just

a soft rustle now, graduation lurks
around the corner. For many seniors this
may be a nagging thought, but like it or
not, our class will be leaving Swarthmore in
a matter ofmonths. So what have we learned

in the past years? Maybe we have the best of

intentions but are still scared to death when
we talk about that touchy quadrilateral, race/
class/gender/sexuality. Perhaps with the utmost sensitivity, we sit quietly and watch our
capacity for understanding wither away. Born
more out of frustration than humanitarian
sentiment, here's an attempt to span that gap
of silence. If you're scared to speak for a gay
person, here's one who could speak for hours.
Just for a moment, here's one big gay senior
sharing what runs through my head when I
think of leaving Swarthmore. Maybe this'll
strike a chord with the reader of a different
sexual preference; maybe it won't. Maybe

that really isn't possible.
What will I do? A plausible question. For a
long time I wanted to be a foreign ambassador. Then one day it struck me that two men
living at a U.S. embassy isn't really an ail-

American picture. No problem—it's the Senate for me. But sadly...only a divine act of
gerrymandering (that district connecting the
Village and the Castro) would put this queer
boy in office. While we're at it, let's rule out
all those jobs in the public eye. The ones
where they comb through my private life and
happen to find the farm animals I slept with,
the 500 sex partners (and counting), and, of
course, the twelve children I recruited. So
what'll I do? I've got some ideas—but I had
some ideas, and they were pretty damn good.
I can be anything I want on this campus, but

then you leave and things change. Leaving
Swarthmore, starting my future, I think of
limits my mom never told me about. I think of
tailoring my goals and ambitions, fitting into
the possible and avoiding those fruitless battles
that help us die young. Weellll, I'm not writing this year's Commencement speech. I must
say, though, that I'm not as defeatist as I
sound. True, we all saw Generation X go
down in a blaze of glory, but I'd still like to
thinkanything's possible when we leave here.
And what about those nights when a ghostly
Barney Frank flutters up to my windowsill?
Gossamer wings and a misty whisper, he tells
me, "I did it. Who can't? It's just strength."
But what'saphantasmicpep-talk when you're
feeling overwhelmed?
Leaving Swarthmore, I think of all I can do,
the limits I'll test, the values I'll affirm and
redefine. I'll do anything I set my mind to.
Leaving Swarthmore, I think of the dreams
I've reined in, the hopes I've severed because
I try to protect myself. All this at once. Schizophrenic perhaps, but I like to think the ambivalence makes me a realist or something
gritty like that. This is not a complaint. I
wouldn't will things any other way. It's
simple: I'm gay and I love it. I rejoice in the
identity I call mine, but I feel its limits. No
one ever said constraint wouldn'tcome in the
midst of celebration.
So whaddya think? Am I whiny, annoying,

full of self-pity? Maybe I'm making a huge
deal out ofnothing. All of us haveconstraints
when we leave here. Many of us can't afford
to go to grad school. Some of us will sell our
souls on Wall Street to pay off loans. Lots of
us won't be able to find jobs. We don't
control these limits. We don't know why they
slap us. I don't know why I'm gay. All different kinds of limits. Are they all the same? I
wonder if it's comfortable for a straight person to think so. Sometimes I find it comfortable to think so...but then I know that's not
the case. So much for bridging that gap; I
tried. I wrote. You read. As for the understanding—l guess we'll see how much we

learned here.

fact that they're queer. As such, the process
of building yourself into a queer network is
just as delicate, gradual, and serendipitous as
assimilating into any other Swarthmore community it's only the imperceptible and painstaking process of developing real bonds that
can truly make me belong.
A friend from home asked me how it feels
to be able to be out like this, and I answered
that it was no big deal, that it felt normal. I
was wrong. It's such a blessing and so intoxicating. I was never shy about disclosing my
sexual orientation whenever someone
asked—most of the work ofcoming outat my
high school was done toward the end of the
year, when people started discussing the Prom
;

(my date was female), and in the last few
months of senioryear there was no one whose
continuing good opinion mattered enough to
me for me to hide. But there was always that
moment after the disclosure when I braced
myself, tensing against the inevitable reaction. Because there always was one, except
with my very close friends, whether it was
positive surprise oran uncomfortable silence.
But at Swarthmore, people don't react. It's
exhilarating to be able to answer the question
of a casual acquaintance "You have a date!
Who is he?" with "Well, actually it's a she,"
and get genuine, indiscriminate enthusiasm
instead of an issue on your hands. I know that
not every person at Swarthmore is so accepting—NO college community could be so

idyllic as to be totally free of prejudice—but
the difference is that here the standard for
responsible correct thought is one of tolerance.

I feel I have the right to expect not to be
judged by my sexual preference, that if someone has a problem with it they're the one in
the wrong, and that's what feels like such a
privilege. And being apart of SQU, having a
community of accepted, vocal, out people
around me, is integral to this feeling of security, of enfranchisement. Whatever the ways
my first queer community fell short of my
fantasies, it's still a part of the feeling of
belonging that was so much more easily obtained than I expected; it's still one of the
reasons I can now say, "I'm home."

A Personal Account of Coming Out
By

Out Week obviously means
things to different people.
By using these excerpts from mypersonal journal, Ipurposely return to what now
seems like a very young stage of my development. I wanted to share such a personal
account because it might help some of us who
are out (to whatever degree) to empathize
and remember. In the assertion of our "out"
pride this week, I'd also like to make a connection to those people at Swarthmore who
may be coming to terms with sexual identity
and coming out to friends andfamily. We all
have different processes, different uses the

piece of what coming out to my family meant
to me.

January 8, 1996
Soon after writing my last entry, my stomach tied up in a sour knot, and I fell very ill.
It seems somehow significant that when I
come home I am overcome with sickness like
a dreadful fear (when I first arrived home on
Christmas Eve, I collapsed for half a day and
a night). And it's true that each time I come
home I come closer and closer to knowing I
must tell my parents that I'm gay. Two days
ago, when I walked in the door from my trip
to see my friends, my stomach twisted, nauseous with the truth I wasn't telling my parents. After spending a week with my exboyfriend and all his gay friends, and after
spending a semester at Swarthmore, coming
home to my family provided a wrenching redivisioning of myself. Almost as if it were too
much for my fearful body, I fell tortuously
ill—puking like someone was gripping and
squeezing my insides...
Then last night I actually got out of bed for
awhile; I sat with my mom iri the family
room. I had been trying to call my friend from
school. Right in the midst ofmy head's drama
in which I tell my mom I'm gay, I hear a nearperfect segue into my liberation from this
hole. My mom: "Is she your girlfriend?" I
snapped at her, "No, she's not." And lay there
in silence hearing the words in my head,
"Mom, I'm gay. I don't like girls."

January 9, 1996
I want to feel more relieved than I do. I am
still scared, scared of who I am. It feels so
much more permanent now. Maybe before
my mom (family) knew, it was still possible
for it to remain ghostly, part of some underworld of secrets held at a distance, far from
home. Last night after I walked spookily
around the house, staring at my mother with
eyes that begged her to ask me. She did. Itfirst

Dining
Alone

The

other day I went to Sharpies
for lunch at 11 a.m. I know, it was
a bold move. The chances of me
finding someone to sit withbefore noon
werepretty slim, but I had missedbreakfast and was willing to take the chance.
Of course, there is one benefit to
getting to Sharpies early. You get your
choice of seating. So after I had navigated through the serving area, I parked
myself alone in one of those coveted
booths in the middle room.
Fifteen minutes later, since my consumption of Sharpies' offerings was not
inhibited by unnecessary chatter, I was
finished. So I sat there watching
Swarthmore's gothic element drag itselffrom the bowels of PPR and into the
unforgiving daylight of upper campus.
I had been watching this parade for
several minutes (that would make this
moment, at the latest, about 11:22 a.m.)
when a very polite young woman came
up to my tableand asked me if I would
be leaving soon. Startled, I stammered
out a yes and she and her friend put their
sweaters on my table and went to get
their food. I quickly arranged my tray,
tumblers to the left and silverware to the
right, so that I would not cause a traffic
jam at the dish belt (this is a hint,
people!), and soon afterwards left
Sharpies.
As Ibegan walking back to my room,
my shock began to wear off and was
immediately replaced by anger. Who
did this woman think she was to ask me
if I would be leaving Sharpies soon? I
mean, at 11:22 a.m., there were only
about 84 billion other seats open for her
and her little cohort to sit in. Why did
they need mine? Didn't I look pathetic
and friendless enough sitting in Sharpies
alone and staring out the window without her adding to my pain?
And that's when it hit me (probably
about 11:28 a.m.). This unfortunate incident was as much my fault as it was
that polite young woman's. I could have
told her I was notready to leave. I could
have told her that I wasn't finished yet
staring at the freaks coming up from
PPR. I could have told her to get lost.
But I didn't. And I didn't because I
was embarrassed to be found eating
alone. You see I, too, have bought into
this whole idea that if you are sitting in
Sharpies alone, you must be pathetic
and friendless. Your entire existence is
without purpose or meaning. You are a
leech on society, not worthy of other's
respect or common courtesy.
So, when that young woman came up
to me, obviously a more valuable person because she, at least, had a friend, I
gave her her due. She deserved the table
while I, pathetic and friendless, did not.
But today is a new day. Today I am
declaring to the world that just because
you are sitting alone in Sharpies, it does
not mean you are pathetic and friendless. Of course, it could mean that you
are pathetic and friendless, but it could
also mean many other things.
Perhaps you are sitting alone because
there was only cold water in the showers this morning and you didn't get a
chance to bathe so you're really, really
smelly. Perhaps you are sitting alone
because you have a big honking pimple
that you do not want to force other
people to stare at while they are eating.
Perhaps you are justfeeling gassy. There
are a billion reasons why people sit
alone in Sharpies, none of them having
to do with their worth as human beings
or their ability to make friends.
So today, if you see me sitting alone
in Sharpies, I would suggest that you
leave me alone. I might be feeling gassy.

a mailing list of over sixty members, which
does not include the many students who are
not affiliated with SQU. ASORA (Alliance
for Sexual Orientation Rights and Awareness) was formed in response to a 1993 incident as an alliance of straight and queer students fighting against homophobia together,
and as a way for students to be politically
active in the gay rights struggle without having to name their sexual identity.
General campus attitudes have not changed
as quickly as the institutional policies. A
series of hate incidents against lesbians and
gays occurred throughout the 1980s. In one

incident in the fall of 1986,anti-gay and proKKK graffiti was soaped around campus and
chalked on the Gay and Lesbian Union door.
In the spring of 1993, anonymous graffiti was
discovered on a McCabe desk naming two
students as being HIV-positive.These incidents were believed to be part of a backlash
against the increasing awareness, activism
and visibility of students around queer issues
and the issue of AIDS.
In the past few years, a community that is

increasingly tolerant and understanding of
queer rights and issues has been growing.
Gay themes appear in the curriculum, and
gay issues are addressed in the context of
many classes. Inclusive policies have helped
make Swarthmore a friendlier place for queer
students, staff and faculty. But this can be
deceiving; there's still a lot of work to be
done. Policy changes are an important step,
but even this semester incidents of
homophobic hate speech have been reported
on campus.

The condition of our nation' s cities
worsens every day. Schools receive
grossly inadequate funding, businesses and middle-class families (regardless of racial background) continue to flee for the suburbs, and little
investment takes place. At the same
time, crime, homelessness, poverty,
teenage pregnancy, and environmental degradation increase largely due
to a declining tax base, non-responsive governmental

More-

School spirit at Swarthmore.
Swarthmore has school spirit! Yes, it has been proven. Last week's
Homecoming events were well-attended, and yes, we even believe that
people had fun. Signs advertising Homecoming went up early and had
most of us scratching our heads and wondering, "Homecoming...
here!?!?!? Didn't we do that in high school?" Despite the rather
dubious beginning, we observed Swatties actually having fun in activities ranging from the pep rally in Sharpies to the pre-game tailgate party
down by the football field. Some alumni even showed up for a tag
football game with Ursinus.
Tanisha Little '97 and Aisha Moss-Koonce '97, co-coordinators of
the Social Affairs Committee (SAC) may take a deep breath and relax,
the first big event of the year has gone off well and we at The Phoenix
hope more are in the works. We've heard rumors that monthly Parrish
Parlor study breaks might be a possibility, and the SAC suggestion
board advocates some interesting options such as pudding wrestling
and The Dating Game.Social life at Swarthmore should consist of more
than the Friday and Saturday night party. And while we enjoy planning
for Screw Your Roommate about four months before it even takes
place, we should be able to raise the same energy and enthusiasm for
other yearly events. Yes, fun without studying. Do you think we can
handle this?
At Yale University, for example, the formal includes champagne
fountains and performances by the college orchestra. Wouldn't you be
more excited about the formal if it were more, well, formal? Wouldn't
it be nice if the evening was as elegant as the dresses and suits we all
reluctantly don?
We are surrounded by talented people: wonderful artists, graceful
dancers, and amazing musicians and we have access to top notch
facilities. So how about another Battle of the Bands, a Swarthmore
Takes Philly trip, a campus-wide scavenger hunt, a slumber party out
in Crum Meadow, a real formalformal shin dig... ? Watching fireworks
is a novelty, but we should also be able to produce our own.

Kohlberg deserves a little more respect.
We were all a little frightened when Kohlberg was unveiled. After all,
some wonderedwhathavoc pastel art deco windows would wreak upon
the campus's architectural continuity. And two sundials just seemed
like a bit much.
But all in all, we have to admit that Kohlberg is growing on us. The
classrooms are beautiful; the facilities amazing; and the espresso bar a
substantive contribution to the level of wakefulness of groggy students.
Even the garden, now that it's become a little more than a mud pit, is
further evidenceof why the Arboretum has been certified as a museum.
The new computing center and language lab are a welcomeaddition that
more than make up for Trotter's temporary disuse.
The most impressive part about Kohlberg is its detail. Haven't you
marvelled at the brass trim on the bathroom walls? Not to mention the
floors, which almost make you wantto swipe out some chess pieces and
invite a friend for a game.And those one-of-a-kind door handles make
coming into class a few minutes late somewhat less of a traumatic
experience. Margaret Helfand (Swarthmore alumna and architect of
Kohlberg Hall) deserves an ample amount of respect for her ingenuity.
Last spring, amidst concern about higher loan and work-study requirements forrecipients offinancial aid, the brass water fountains, the
marble Coffee Bar tables and yes, even the art glass itself, seemed to
constitute a misguided allocation of resources.
While the value of these individual aspects of Kohlberg is still open
to question, the existence of the building as a whole should not be
viewed as a waste. After all, financial aid and development of the
campus are both important. We won't be able to attract students of high
academic caliber, let alone give them financial aid, if there are not
facilities like Kohlberg Hall to make them want to come. And Kohlberg
Hall represents a good long-term investment of the College's resources,
since in all likelihood it will stand for far longer than any of us Swatties
are alive.
The building's relative opulence could also have the fringe benefit of
giving alumni areason to be excited about donating to the Annual Fund.
This year, for the firsttime in quite a while, alumni giving to the annual
exceeded the goal of $2.5 million. This additional money could be
devoted to, among other things, the portion of the budget devoted to
financial aid.

over, the
state
of

America's
urban areas
has been seldom discussed in recent
political dialogue despite the daunting problems which persist. Our beloved President Clinton has not even
outlined any plans to aide these once
thriving cultural, economic and social centers. Unfortunately, most large
city governments must contend with
too many pressing problems which
necessitate immediate action or lack
the resources to devote to finding
long-term solutions to theirproblems.
To make matters worse, the cur-

rent administrationand several states

created and expanded enterprise
zones, instead ofimproving the quality of local schools by equalizing
funding of school districts, improving buildings, and hiring more and
better-qualified teachers, or enforcing fair lending laws which would
make it more difficult to deny loans
and credit to inner-city residents,
among other desperately needed reforms.
For those of you who may be wondering what an enterprise zone (EZ)
is and how they are supposed to improve conditions in urban areas
read on. I intend to tell you exactly
what these programs entail, how they
stimulate little to no growth, and
who's truly benefiting from these
programs which the powers that be
have decided will reverse urban decay, despite the research and evidence that shows otherwise.
In theory, EZs stimulate growth in
small geographic regions by providing a unique system of tax incentives
and abatements, subsidies and other
enticements to encourage expansion,
relocation and creation ofbusinesses
within a specific area.
The idea for EZs originated in England in the early 80's and gained
popularity in America when Jack
Kemp (then Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development) advocated
the passing offederal EZ legislation.
Luckily, his efforts proved unsuccessful when held up to scrutiny by
experts ranging the full scope of the
political spectrum. Nonetheless, sev—

Taxation Is Simply
Legal Pickpocketing
By

Brian Schwartz

I have noticed a parallel in the
ways college students seek to deal
with issues in their college and in
their country. My purpose in investigating this parallel is to find why so
few people see taxation as theft.
Certainly there are similarities between colleges and countries. Colleges have students and admissions
procedures, countries have citizens
and immigration policies. Both colleges and countries have governments, laws and judicial bodies.
Students have a certain influence
on college policy, as citizens have
influence on government policy. If a
student does not like his college's
policies, he can try to change it, or he
can just leave. It's not as if the policies violate his rights. After all, he
chose to attend the college. But is the
situation the same for the citizen of a
country?
The difference between the student and the citizen is the difference
in the nature of colleges and countries. Colleges are founded by a group
of people who put effort into creating
an institution for higher learning.
People choose to become members
of the college community; they actually sign a contract agreeing to the
terms of this relationship with the
college administration. Part of this
contract is the student's option to
leave the relationship, for example,
to leave the school.
But being a citizen of a country is
different. A government is not like a
college, or any other private club.
Why? A college administration made
the existence of the student-faculty
"marketplace" possible. However, a
government providing services in a
geographic area does not create the
marketplace operating in that area.
The people working for a government do not organize the market.
Markets are not and cannot be organized by central planners.
The government cannot exist without the production and trade that produces wealth to fund it. The government may protect (and unfortunately
violate) property rights, but such protection is meaningless without the
existence of property, which is the
result of production and trade. Yet
the relationship between a government and producers of property
proves reciprocal: people will not
produce much above a bare minimum of values unless they know that
their right to keep or trade them is
protected. This does not mean that
coercive taxationis necessary to have
a government; to posit this is to say
that people's rights must be violated
in order for them to be protected.
In essence, people believe that the
government owns the country, justas
people own private colleges. Officials can decide just who enters the
country's boundaries and who does
not, acting as the country's admissions officers. Bureaucrats determine
"

who will pay theirdues to the country
to receive benefits, just as admissions officers decide who will pay

tuition.
To extend the parallel, consider
how both college administration and
government redistribute wealth. Students receive financial aid from a
college. Their aid comes partly from
tuition of the other students and their
families. Similarly, citizens of a country receive doles from the government, money raised through taxation, or "tuition" to the country.
Seen in this light, as a college, state
and federal governments in the continent of North America appear to be
legitimate. Clearly, private colleges
are legitimate. If a student does not
like the tuition redistribution practices, or how the administration
spends money, he can choose to leave
as he chose to attend the college. And
the same reasoning, people implicitly think, applies to countries and
states.

As I said before, the above reasoning when applied to states is invalid
because people must first create value
(property) in order for their property
rights to be defended. Protection of
property rights is one of the proper
functions of government, and allows
people to dispose of and trade their
property with others based on mutual
consent.e.g., therelationship between
a college and a student.
Why am I going to such great
lengths to draw parallels between
colleges and countries? Well, I attend a rather left-wing college. I do
not want to believe that most of my
classmates, or most people on this
planet, have no respect for human

rights.
Most people, left andright, do think
theft is immoral. But they do not
think that taxation is theft. On occasion I have gotten themto realize that
the initiationof force is wrong. They
just did not make the connection that
government initiates force.
One way to analyze these people
is: "These statists think other people
exist to serve their needs, and believe
that I am on this planet to serve
another's political agenda. They do
not respect my right to own my life,
and hence are despicable people and
I should have nothing to do withthem
because the implicit ideas behind their
statist beliefs are disgusting."
Well, I have thought the above
about people. And unfortunately,
some people are so evil. But my point
is that one cannot infer from another's
political (or religious, or aesthetic)
conclusions the cognitive process that
leads them to the conclusions. I can
no longer infer, for lack of evidence,
the worst possible reasons for a person advocating anything but pure
capitalism, and brand him as evil.
Perhaps the person is advocating a
capitalist system because he implicitly believes that being a citizen of a
country is like being a member of a
country club.

eral states and localities passed EZ
legislation in attempts to invigorate
deteriorating urban areas.
On the surface, it would seem as
though these programs would, in fact,
stimulate economic growth, create
jobs and draw people back into metropolitan areas. But close analysis of
EZs, their basic structure, and observations from existing programs demonstrate that property and business
owners (capitalists) and high-skilled
labor (suburbanites) from outside of
the enterprise zone area benefit from
the tax incentivesand subsidies while
local residents bear the brunt of increased rents, higher taxes, diminished social services, increased competition for jobs in addition to all of
their other preexisting problems.
Essentially, EZs employ supplyside solutions to reverse urban decay.
Insteadof directly addressing the conditions largely responsible for the
marginal conditions of urban residents, EZs provide inducements to
those who already own property and/
or businesses.
Apparently, the economic growth
enjoyed by those at the top will eventually trickle down to those struggling to make ends meet. Hmmm!
That sounds awfully similar to
Reaganomics. And we all know how
much good his "voodoo economics"
did for the country.
Nonetheless, the current administration has heralded its expansion of
EZs as its effort to fight urban blight
and improve the conditions of those
living in our nation'scities (who tend
to be Black, Latino, poor, underemployed, ill-prepared and neglected by
their elected officials). You'd think
the government would unleash the
full extent ofits might to improve the
deteriorating conditions. Besides,

Point

&

aren't they American citizens?
I don't know about you, but I believe thatit's a national problem when
unemployment for certain groups of
people (especially Black males) has
constantly been in the double digits
and grows as jobs leave urban areas
for the suburbs or other countries. Or

when thousands of children must attempt to get an education in schools
with crumbling buildings, underpaid
staff, and outdated equipment. If I'm
wrong, please point out the error in
my logic.
Given the extent of the problems
facing our nation's cities, a concerted
effort must be made to revitalize them.
Not just to benefit city residents (who
lack the political clout and economic
base to improve conditions alone)
but the nation as a whole.
In my opinion, if the United States
could rebuild Europe after a devastating war, then this great country
could easily rejuvenate American
urban areas whichhave sufferedfrom
decades of neglect, mismanagement
and periods of corruption.
Unfortunately, no one seems to be
willing to address the true problems
hindering growth in these areas. Could
this be due to the fact that mostly
Blacks, Latinos, Asians and lowerclass white people with little economic power and even less political
clout live in theseareas? I guessthat's
one of those things that make you
go...hmmmmmmmm.
Those of you living in suburban
paradises cannot ignore the problems
posed by urban decay since many of
you work, play, go to school, travel
through, or shop in these areas. Moreover, if nothing is done to improve
urban areas, the frustrations ofinnercity residents may just explode in
your backyard rather than theirs.

Stop Pouting: Construction's Goodfor the Soul
By

Joe Tucker

Have you ever been sitting in that
comfortable, well air-cpnditioned
Kohlberg lecture room (not Chem 1OH
or PS I—swear to God!)blankly staring out and wishing you had a yellow
hard hat, well-worn overalls withtools
spilling out, and massive machines
behind your control? Probably not,
but it is this vision which helps me
deal with construction on campus.
Sure, my political theory class was
almost bulldozed over and there was
a 6.7 earthquake registered in my
chemistry class. It is true that construction makes walking to DuPont
and the Rugby Field more difficult,
talking to someone three feet away in
Kohlberg nearly impossible, and enjoying theaesthetics ofnorthern campus a little rough. But two factors
make the wholeprocess easier to deal
with: the actual physical movements
involved and the promise of what
those movements will do to Swat

buildings.
Construction is intrinsically pleasing—no matter how you look at it,
big piles of dirt are flung around with
ease, jaws of plows gobble concrete,
and the workers act like nothing special is happening. How can one not be
awed by the sheer bulk of dirt and

concrete moved?The other day I day-

dreamed about jumping into a big
construction hole and helping the
crew. Simply watching the physical
movements ofthe

work is mesmeriz-

ing. In addition, the orange plastic
fences which separate campus from
construct provide fun. Try dragging a
pen lightly across it so it sort of shakes
your hand. I know it sounds childish
and base, but once you start doing it,
you will not stop.
As I was dragging my pen across
the fence yesterday, I heard a young
child ask what was being built. This
brings me to the second and most
important reason to appreciate the

constuction—something is being
built or refurbished. It was construction last year which made the comfortable air-conditioned Kohlberg
classes possible.
Sometimes it is hard to imagine
anything is going to surface, but I am
confident the workers are not just
pushing around dirt (even though it
might seem like that at times). So
even if you don't like men in hard
hats and big destructive machines,
the promise of an improved campus
ought to make you appreciate the

construction.

Swarthmore's Beauty is Eclipsed by Bulldozers
By

Fred Bush

Swarthmore' s chief attraction is its
natural beauty. People come here
because it's a pretty place. There are
several schools with academic reputations like ours. There are very few
with a campus like ours.
I came here, walked down Magill
walk, sat out on the Adirondack chairs
on Parrish Beach, sat in the Amphitheater, smelled the flowers blooming,, and fell in love.
I can't do that any more. Now,
there are often fences blocking portions of Magill Walk. There are big
concrete blocks sitting on Parrish
Beach. I have to cross the Rose Garden morass of mud to get from my
dorm to the Amphitheater. I can't
smell the flowers with the stink of
diesel in the air. This is not the campus I fell in love with.
Construction makes the campus
ugly. Simple as that. Construction
makes big piles of dirt and rocks,
construction makes mudslides when
it gets rainy, construction makes ugly
orange fences sprout up around campus. It's hard to enjoy the surroundings when they're made of plastic.
Joe Tucker says that construction
itselfis aesthetically pleasing. I don't
find large men in plastic hats with big
machines aesthetically pleasing. Is

there something beautiful in men
moving dirt and throwing big hunks
of insulation out ofTrotter windows?
I don't think so.
Is Kohlberg proof enough that we

continue building? Sure,
Kohlberg is a nifty building. I've
taken several classes in Kohlberg.
However, compared to the amount of
must

time I spend wandering around campus, the amount of time I'm in
Kohlberg is minuscule. All in all, I'd
rather have had peace and quiet and
undisturbed meanderings. Besides,
construction has a big price tag. With
the school currently cutting back on
financial aid, I think it's evil to keep
construction as a priority. We
shouldn't value buildings more than
students.
I won't say all construction is bad.
Those big plastic fences provided me
with a kickin' Halloween costume
freshman year. I cut myself a portion
of fencing, wore it around myself,
and went to the Halloween party as
"campus." Is it worth it for the College to spend millions of dollars to
provide me with a Halloween costume? I don't think so.
Give me birds over bulldozers,
charm over construction, quiet over
Kohlberg. Construction sucks.

Alston and His Chester Cantata
By

Rachel McKnight
Gabriel Cumming

If

you take a quick glance inside John
Alston's office, you will see a glossy
black piano in one corner, a small collection ofrecords on the floor, an upside-down
honey bear on the windowsill, and a Certificate of Appreciation tacked to a bulletin
board. Hanging above the computer is a blackand-white print of John Coltrane. The picture
shows a striking moment of artistic concentration, an artist perfectly attuned to his work.
This same intensity can also be seen in the
way Alston approaches his music and his

teaching.
Most people on campus know Alston because he directs the College Chorus, the
Chamber Choir, and the Jazz Ensemble. He
also teaches a course in jazz studies every
other year.

However, Alston has another group of
students off campus, fifteen boys from two
elementary schools in Chester. He has organized a Boys' Choir in Chester, which rehearses two hours a day, Tuesday through
Friday. The choir learns Bach cantatas, which
they perform in local churches. The boys in
the choir have learned about music, discipline and opportunity. In the meantime, Alston
realizes, "I'vereally fallen quite in love with
them."
Alston explained to us that he sees Chester
as "a little bit like home." Unlike the wellendowed fine arts background that exists at
Swarthmore, "there's hardly any music going on in Chester." Alston obviously cares
very much about changing that. He sees his
work as sometimes very exhausting, but important: "I don'tknow how else they'd get it."
As typical 3rd to 7th graders, the boys need
Alston to give complete attention and energy
during their practices. "There can be no dead
time. You can't have an off day," he tells us.

Alston's main concern seems to be

Night, the assured directorial debut

of actors Stanley Tucci and Campbell
f"> Scott,
M>J
is that rare beast: an honestfeel-

goodmovie. Refreshingly simple, deliciously
sly, Big Night is an almost pitch-perfect delight. And it's indubitably the best food movie
since Eat Drink Man Woman.
With remarkable grace, Big Night traces a
day or two in the lives of Primo (Tony
Shalhoub) and Segundo (Tucci), Italian immigrant brothers and proprietors of a struggling restaurant on the Jersey shore, circa
19SS. Segundo is the businessman, allrazzledazzle and easy charm. Primo is the chef,
artiste and prima donna of the kitchen, a true
maestro ofall things culinary. Unfortunately,
Primo's rigorously authentic, not to mention
aesthetic, dishes lack the mass appeal of the
spaghetti and meatballs dished out at Pascal' s
Italian Grotto, the unbearably kitschy (and
undeniably successful) restaurant down the
street. His artistic sensibilities enraged and
bis moustaches vibrating in anger, Primo
fumes: "Do you know what goes on in that
restaurant every night? Rape! The rape of
cuisine!"
Pascal (lan Holm) wants Primo and
Segundo in his own kitchen. But when
Segundo refuses his latest offer, Pascal has
another suggestion: why don't the brothers

throw a bang-up banquet and invite all of
their friends and neighbors? To top things
off, Pascal will invite his own very close
friend, crooning superstar Louis Prima. With
Prima will come a world of free publicity,
publicity which just might push the brothers
into the black.
Faced with imminent bankruptcy, Segundo
sees no choice but to go along with Pascal's
scheme. It takes rather more convincing to
win Primo over to the cause. Once Primo
concedes, the big night begins.
By the end ofthe brother's nearly orgiastic
banquet, one guest is slumped against the
table, sobbing: "My mother was such a terrible cook." In between courses, Big Night" s
various subplots collide, with consistently
comic, and often bittersweet, results.
Primo is maneuvered into
an
acknowledgement of his shy adoration for
Ann (Allison Janney), the widow who runs
the nearby flower shop. Segundo is forced to
choose between Phyllis (Minnie Driver), his
long-suffering girlfriend, and Gabriella
(Isabella Rosselini), his sometime lover and
Pascal's full-time wife.
Bob (Campbell Scott), a particularly quirky
Cadillac salesman, tries to sell a car to everyone in sight. And Pascal's motives turn out to
be considerably more complicated than anyone had expected.

nothing to do with formal writing—it's to

keep my head on straight, to figure out where
and who I am. Writing is such a powerful

mode of expression. Sometimesyou can scare
yourself by what you write, or surprise yourself. The experience of writing is what matters most to me, not the final product.
P: How did you get published?
DS: My high school writing teacher encouraged his students to submit poems to a
local literary journal called "Hanging Loose"
that had a special section for "writers of high
school age." My senior year I had three poems published there, which was really exciting. Then, last winter when I went home for
break, I got a letter saying that Adrienne Rich
had chosen one of those poems to be in the
book [The Best American Poetry: 1996]. I
had no idea it was even being considered.
P: How do you feel about being published?
DS: It is a huge honor—l still don't completely believe it. That Adrienne Rich liked
my poem...thatI'm 19 and I'm in this b00k...1
think it's one of the most exciting things that
will ever happen to me.
P: Do you work seriously On your poetry?
Is it part of your career aspirations?
DS: I don't know about careers yet—ask
me after I pick a major. But, yes, I will always
write. I can't imagine a life without it.

Windy Fun: Let's Go Fly a Kite
Glorious
Carnage
Iknow
By

Aarti Iyer

some of you saw me make
an ass of myself last Thursday on
Parrish Beach. You must have
stared and wondered, "Who is that
fool trying to fly a kite?" Well it was
me. Thanks to my lovely friend Yura
Shubin '98,1 have been introduced to

By

Right

the wonderful world of kite-flying.
Most ofus haven 'tflownkites since
we were about knee-high. But there
are many adults who have played
with kites well after their grammarschool days: Alexander Graham Bell,

the inventor of the telephone, used to
spend hours constructing colossal
kites that consisted of thousands of
small, silk-covered, triangular pyramids or tetrahedrons. And of course
we know about Ben Franklin and all
the fun he had with his kite.
All you need is some wind, a little
spare time (i.e. procrastination time),
and a kite. They can range from the
$4 paper or plastic kites found at your
local K-Mart to $lOO nylon kites
found in specialty stores.

time for naval gunnery practice.

Kites at Swat...and Beyond
A Quick History Lesson
A kite is a heavier-than-air flying
device that gets its lift from the power
of the wind, and is controlled from
the ground by one or more lines. A
properly-designed kite leans forward
into the wind, so that the wind does
not strike it flatbut acts as a 'wedge'
to push it up and back.
Historians estimate thatkites were
probably invented in China or Southeast Asia around 1000 B.C. By about
500 A.D. they had spread eastward to
the Pacific Islands and westward to
the Middle East. It was not until the
end of the Middle Ages that kites
made their appearance in Europe.
In 1752, Benjamin Franklin conducted his famous experiment in
which he sent a kite up into an approaching thunderstorm and proved,
from the electricity that ran down the
string, that lightning and electricity
were the same thing. Throughout the
19th century, kites were used for me-

teorological experiments.
In 1825, in Bristol, England, a
schoolteachernamed GeorgePocock
usedakite to lifthis daughter300 feet
into the air. Martha Pocock was thus
the first person in the West to be lifted
by a kite, although kite-lifters had
been known to exist in the Middle
East long before this (Marco Polo
mentioned them in his travel diaries).
Pocock also used kites to pull lightweight carriages along England's
country roads at speeds of up to 20
miles an hour.
By 1804, Sir George Cayley had
demonstrated that a flat kite could
serve as a glider ifproperly weighted.
In 1853, he launched his coachman in
a kite-glider across a small valley.
That (scared!) coachman thus became
the first glider pilot.
Early in World War I, kites were
used to occasionally lift military observers into the air; however, the arrival of the aeroplane soon madekites

Shubin is probably the most active
kite-flyer on campus. He owns four
functioning kites—three two-strings,
and one four-string—and he flies
them about once a week, for an hour
at a time. He tries to fly whenever
there is enough wind, and will quite
readily postpone homework for this
activity. As he puts it, "You can always do homework in the stillest and
darkest time, but you can only fly a
kite when there is wind and it's a nice

day outside."

So why does he fly kites? "It's
great to relax my mind," he explained,
"I can be a part of nature, and yet have
complete control over the kite."
But sometimes the wind does not
always cooperate, and this is when he
does the Wind Dance. "It's fun to do
and it just comes naturally," he said.
"Every kite-flyer does something dif-

ferent to make the wind blow. For
me, the Wind Dance works, but you
have to do it with passion."
The Wind Dance consists ofjumping around on one leg at a time, while
flailing your arms about as if they

definitely like to see more people out
keeping him company on windy days.
Unfortunately, most of us haven't
even thought of flying a kite since our
sand-box days. Jenny Yang 'OO remembers a fifth—grade project where
the entire class made kites out of
sticks, paper, string and glue, and
almost everyone got theirkites to fly.
But she hasn't flown a kite since,
because "as far as popular society
goes, it's not something you do in
your spare time."
But there are annual kite festivals
held in many cities in the United
States and around the world where
people gather to build and fly some of
the most magnificent kites you will
ever see. Such a festival is held in
Santiago Sacatepequez, Guatemala.

According to Sofia Sanchez 'OO, a
nativeof GuatemalaCity, the festival
has its origins in spiritual beliefs, as
the kites are said to aid communication with the dead.
People like Kelly Kong 'OO still
spend a summer afternoon flying kites
withfriends. "Itwas lastsummer. We
went to the store, and bought some
$3.99 plastic kites," she recalls, "and
we went out to a field and flew them.
We were really bored that afternoon,
and were looking for something different to do. It was a lot of fun."

were an aeroplane's wings. I must
confess that when I first did it, I felt
like a complete idiot. But Shubin
allayed my concerns: "People are so
self-centered that they are going to
look at you and laugh, and then go
back to worry about themselves." In
other words, this too shall pass.
Shubin identified the best places to
fly kites on campus as the lacrosse
and soccer fields and Parrish Beach
when the wind is blowing north. You
do have to be aware of the trees that
surround Parrish Beach, however. It
was here thatI violatedShubin's three
cardinal rules ofkite-flying: 1) Don't
get it stuck in a tree; 2) Don't get it
stuck in a tree; and 3) NEVER get it
stuck in a tree. (We did get the kite
down with no damage done.)
The only skill you really need is a
lot of practice, according to Shubin.
In fact, he believes that anyone can
pick it up fairly quickly, and would

after fall break, SWIL
hosts an 80s epic of fantasy:
Clash of the Titans. To me,
Clash was a seminal movie watching
experience thatkindled a lifelong interest in Greek myth. Others might
see the film as a poorly-acted hackand-slash fest, but phooey to them!
Bring on the Kraken!
Clash of the Titans follows the
adventures ofPerseus, a dashing lout
who must battle hideous monsters
and undertake heroic quests to save
his lady-love Andromeda, who has
been captured by the bestial Calibos.
Along the way, he encounters a
talking owl, Medusa, a giant scorpion, a giant bird, a giant sea monster,
and much, much more! Just as Perseus slashes his way through the opposition, so do thewriters butcher the
original Greek mythology: the owl,
the giant animals, and the capture of
Pegasus by Perseus are all fabricated
for the film. On the good side, that
means no matter how well you know
Greek myth, you will be surprised.
It's the nasty beasties which really
give the movie its charm. Created by
stop-motion master Ray Harry hausen
(of Jasonand the A rgonauts and The
Seventh Voyage of Sinbad fame),
these uglies are huge, fierce, and believable in their motions. They're
good for lots of pulse-pounding excitement as Perseus and his loyal
Greekfollowers/cannon fodder pound
their way through them.
Clash of the Titans is epically violent, with gods and men interacting in
one vast web of hacking and slaying.
If you like your monsters nasty, your
heroes bold and handsome, this is the
film for you!
SWIL will be showing Clash of the
Titans on Monday, October 21 at 10
p.m. in Kirby lecture hall. All are
invited; attendance is free.

Victory for Women's Soccer
Laird Hedlund

By

Team spirit, tireless effort, and tremendous heart delivered the Swarthmore women's soccer team an exciting win at Homecoming on Saturday.
On Clothier Field, the women defeated a rough Dickinson squad 4-3
in front of a multitude of parents,
students, and alumni fans.
The Red Devils scored the first
goal but it was answered quickly by a
goal by Betsy Rosenbaum '9B. The
game continued to be intense and at

half Dickinson led 2-1.
Swarthmore's halftime talk by
Coach Alex Ely was inspiring, for
shortly into the second half, Amy
Markey '99 tied the score at two. The
game remained evenly matched to

the excitement of the fans until

Dickinson scored a third goal.
The Swarthmore team suddenly
seemed lethargic and disheartened
but held together and rallied as
Rosenbaum scored her second goal
to retire the game.
Swarthmore's enthusiasm increased as the team realized that they
had answered Dickinson's every attempt at scoring. With three goals

behind them, the Swarthmore offense
delivered shot after shot with confidence. Finally, Sarah Jaquette '9B
found the net, and the Swarthmore
players erupted in celebration.
Following the game, Coach Ely
said it best when he commented that
the entire team played with all of the
heartand couragethat they possessed.

His prediction that the game would
inspire the team for the remainder of
the season was proven accurate Tuesday when Swarthmore managed a 10 win over Eastern.
In not quite as spectacular a fashion as the Dickinson game, the
Swarthmore women defeateda sloppy
but aggressive Eastern squad.
Eastern's rough play hurt them when
Kirsten Knox '99 successfully completed a penalty shot awarded after
an Eastern defender's intentional foul
in the penalty area. Swarthmore held
thelead for the remainder ofthe game
for its second victory of the week.
The Swarthmore women have another home match on Thursday at
4:00 p.m. before they begin a series
of three away games over break.

Buzzards Men's Soccer Falters
By

Saturday the intrepid men's rugby
team ventured into downtownPhila-

delphia for a competitive sojourn into
the world of rugby. In the two-team
tournament hosted by the University
of Pennsylvania, the Evil Buzzards
pulled off a stunning second place
finish, losing to the home team 17-0.
Despite being distracted by the soccer players on the field adjoining the
rugby pitch, the few remaining uninjured Buzzards took the field and
played a decently competitive game.
The cohesiveness of the Swarthmore
team has still been noticeably lacking
as more and more players are injured
in games, practices, and odd freak
accidents every week.
Even with these problems, the Buzzards held their own for most of the
game. The only noticeable trouble
was when they failed to convert on
several scoring opportunities.
In the B-side game, the Buzzards
managed to field a well-matched team
and only lost to the UPenn team by a
few points. The next men's rugby
game will be at home against Temple.
The Buzzards are still searching for
their first win of the season.

Men's Tennis
By

Shulamit Shapiro

and

Jennifer Chen

Amidst the Homecoming festivi-

ties, the men's tennis team played in
their annual Rolex Tournament this
past Friday. In this tournament,
Swarthmore did not win the championship in eitherthe singles or doubles
for the first time in a long while.
Three Swarthmore doubles teams
from a field of 32 teams reached the
quarter-finals. The doubles team of
Steve Richards '99 and John Leary
'OO advanced to the semifinal round.
The doubles team of John Derderian
'97 and Greg Emkey '99 reached the
finals on Monday but lost to the pair
from Trenton State, one of whom
(D.J. Hommefield) had also won the
singles title in this tournament.
In the singles bracket, five
Swarthmore players reached the
Sweet Six in a pool of 68 players.
Both Richards and Derderian advanced to the semifinals, where
Richards lost to a Franklin & Marshall
player and Derderian dropped to the
eventual single's champion, D.J.
Hommefield. Swarthmore will not
be sending any player to the Small
School National Championship in
Memphis this year.

For fans of the Swarthmore men's
soccer team, midterms and rainy
weather have not been the only causes
for distress this week. After two exciting wins last week, the team lost its
momentum in a 3-0 loss to Dickinson.
"The last game was a little rough,"
said co-captain Amber Thompson
'97. Thompson believes that the primary problem during this last game
was injuries. Injuries will also affect
the next few games.
"Again, the injuries are plaguing
us. We lost our main offensive [threat]
with Dave Lane's injury," he said.
Co-captain Dave Lane '97 had missed
some games at the beginning of the
season due to a sprained ankle, and
now he has sprained his other ankle.
"It will be at least another week
before he can play again," said Th-

October 10, 19%

ompson. Co-captain, Kyle Barnett
'97 will also not be playing in the
next game. His absence will be due to
an accumulation of yellow cards.
"Kyle got [his fifth cumulative]
yellow card in this game so he will
have to sit out the next game. Unfortunately, he won't be able to play on
Wednesday," said Thompson.
Thompson regrets the fact that the
injuries had such a negative impact
on the last game. Yet, he maintains
that there could have been other contributing factors to the team's loss.
"People had to contribute more to the
team than they normally have to in
this game," he said.
Wednesday the team faced Eastern. Over October break, the team
will host New York University on
Saturday, October 12 at 1:00 p.m.,
and Franklin and Marshall on Saturday, October 19 at 1:00 p.m.

Alex Lundry

Once again this past week, the
Garnet Tide experienced a huge letdown in the fourth quarter as the
Ursinus Bears rolled by with a final
score of 27-6. Recently, the Tide has
been refusing to play a four-quarter
football game, and this past week
was no exception.
The Tide started off the game extremely fired up and ready to face the
undefeated Bears. However, their
enthusiasm was soon cut short when
an Ursinus player broke out of the
backfieldfora6l yardrun. Theßears'
offense was then able to punch it in
the endzone two plays later to go up
7-0.
This score lasted into the second
quarter when Ursinus appeared to
decide to kick a field goal. The Tide
were thrown for a loop as Ursinus
faked the field goal, and the ball was
run in for a touchdown by the Bears'
holder.
Then, towards the end of the first
half, S warthmore began a drive which

ended in a similar fashion to the one
which Ursinus had just had. After
lining up in field goal formation, the
Garnet faked it, and Pat Straub '97
threw to tight end Tom Forstik 'OO in
the back of the endzone for a touchdown.
This was the second time in the last
two games that the Straub-Forstik

connection has been successful off of
the fake field goal. After an unsuccessful point after attempt, the score
going into halftime was 14-6 in favor
of the Bears.
The third quarter passed by uneventfully with no change in the score.
Yet the Tide refused to play all four
quarters and allowed two more
Ursinus scores in the fourth quarter;
one coming off a questionable
endzone call by the referees, and the
other a result of a picked off shovel
pass which was returned for a touchdown. At 27-6, the final score of the
game did little to reflect the hustle
and determination that the Tide
showed throughout the course of the
contest.

The field hockey team had a light
week. Their only game was against
Dickinson at Homecoming. The Garnet routed their opponent 2-0 to earn
another Centennial Conference victory and bring their overall record to
8-4. Undefeated (5-0) in conference

action, Swarthmore continues to hold
onto first place.
Danielle Duffy '9B, the Garnet's
top goal-scorer and a leader in the
conference, scored in the first half
with help from Ch'uya Hornberger
'97. Coach Karen Borbee said,
"Danielle's goal was during a mess in

front of the goal. To score in that
situation you need to be aggressive
and quick to the ball."
Swarthmore's other goal came in
the second half from a corner play by
Michelle Walsh '9B, assisted by Julie
Finnegan 'OO. "Michelle's goal was a
powerful shot from the top of the
circle. It came at a great time to put
the game out ofreach for Dickinson,"
said Coach Borbee.

When asked about the other team,
Duffy said, "They were a good team
with decent skills, but our passing
and skills were much better."
Dickinson was not able to counter the
Garnet's attacks, and the Garnet
outshot them 19-8 and controlled the
ball 80 percent of the time.
Goalie Kelly Wilcox '97 had a great
showing in front of the cage for her
shutout. Dominating the midfield,
Donna Griffin '99 earned herself a
spot on the conference Honor Roll.
The injuries to Lynne Steuerle '99
and Lurah Hess '99 in the Seven
Sisters Tournament, do not seem too
severe. Steuerle tore the meniscus in
her right knee and will undergo
orthroscopic surgery this Friday. Hess
had the stitches removed from her
broken finger and will return to the
playing field when she can put pressure on herfinger. Lia Ernst '97, who
picked up her stick for the first time
this season at Muhlenberg, played in
the Dickinson game and continues to
show off her exceptional skills.

Warmothers’ Difficult Weekend
By

Jill Eaton

This past weekend the Warmothers

made their way to the Sectional at
Lehigh. Overestimating the length of
the drive, the Swarthmore women
were the first team to arrive and im-

mediately felt right at home
Lehigh's field was steeper than Mertz
Lawn.
In the first game, the Warmothers
faced offagainst Haverford. It seemed
—

as if a case of nerves attacked the
players and Swarthmore lost 11-3.
Next the Warmothers battled
Drew's Bovine Intervention. As the
zone defense caused Drew to turn the

disc over, the Warmothers had a tremendous scoring streak and won the
game. Kate Walker '97 and Jill Eaton
'99 connected threetimes in the game.
In their game against Rutgers the
Warmothers weren't able to find a
rhythm and lost 11-3.
For the final two games of the day,
the Warmothers faced club team
Catshit, and their B-side, Hairball.
Besides their great breath and funky
music, Catshit had the skill to shut
out the Warmothers 11-0.
Loewenthal felt the day was a good

learningexperiencefortheteam. "The
tournament made us realize that we
need solid fundamental skills before

we can pull off the risky stunts. So
even though we got trounced by
Catshit, we looked pretty good los-

ing."
While the Warmothers ended their
day with a 2-3 record, it was good
enough to qualify them for Sunday's
double elimination. The Warmothers
had the unfortunate luck of starting
the morning off against club team
Philly Peppers and UPenn, losing

both.
The highlight of Sunday' s play had

to be the catch by Carrie Bader '99 in

the endzone with the disc between
her knees after a deflection by a UPenn
defender.

Women's Volleyball Seeks Win Swarming Worms

The Swarthmore women's volleyball team has struggled to find consistency this season. The team
dropped a hard-fought match, 12-15,
15-12, 8-15, 14-16, to Centennial
Conference rival Washington College last Thursday. Then they suffered a loss to Moravian lastSaturday
at Homecoming and another to
Wilmington on Tuesday.
The team has fallen to 2-8 overall,
0-4 in the conference, but they hope
to turn things around at the Seven
Sisters Tournament at Mt. Holyoke
over October break. Over break they
will also host their final match of the

season against Dickinson Thursday.
Against Moravian, the Garnet
struggled with their serve receipt and
passing. Connie Cheung '9B and
Holly Barton '99 anchored the defense withsix and seven digs, respectively. However, their teammates
didn't follow their lead. The Garnet
lost in three games, 6-15,2-15,4-15.
Tuesday Swarthmorefaced a strong
team from Wilmington for the second time this season. The Garnet
jumped out to early leads in both the
first and third games, but each time
Wilmington came storming back.
Again passing and serve receipt
were areas where the Garnet were
vulnerable.Furthermore the team has

yet to find a go-to hitter who can be
relied gameafter game to win important sideouts or to end long rallies. In
contrast the Wilmington squad was
offensively-oriented. The players did
not hustle on defense, but they hit the
ball real hard.
Against Wilmington, Heather
Stickney '9B stepped up to the challenge with seven kills and a .304
hitting percentage. However, the team
did not consistently send the ball her
direction, and the rest of the hitters
struggled comparatively. Stickney
also played well on defense. She had
several block assists against
Wilmington and four solo blocks
against Moravian.

Fast, Forward Women's Rugby
Well-matched game
ends in unfortunate
loss for ruggers
By

Rachel Gutman

Members of the Swarthmore
women's rugby team are proud of
their valiant performance last Saturday against the University of Delaware. Though they lost by a score of
22-5, they played "an excellent
game," according to Elin Lisska '97,
and maintained possession almost the
entire time. As Lisska said, "the fact
we even scored was huge; we didn't
expect to win, but we played really
well."

The final score does not truly reflect the nature of the game; in fact,
the game was quite an even contest.
Delaware had three break-away runs
at the beginning of the game which
gave them a big lead. If one only
looked at the second half, the score
would have been 5-5. The
Swarthmore women truly held their
ground against their bigger, taller and
faster opponents.
The one goal Swarthmore scored
was in the second half by co-captain
Hanan Hussein '97. "It was a great
team effort. The goal was off of a
whole series of really nice plays,"
said Hussein.
The B-side women also showed a
strong team effort. They tiedthe larger
Delaware B-side 5-5.

The women tried a new offensive
strategy. It involves a forward-centered offense in which the forwards
do a few plays before they pass the
ball up. This allows the team to maintain possession longer. As the opposing backs tackle the team's forwards,
Swarthmore has more mobile backs
than their opponents do and thus can
hold on to the ball for several seconds. "This strategy was quite a success; we won almost every scrum on
Saturday," said Lisska.
On October 12, Swarthmore
women's rugby will play Princeton
University, last year's nationalchampions. They will again use their new
strategy, which last week's game
proved to be an effective and successful technique.

For the Swarming Earthworms, this
season's work and effort culminated
at the Pennsylvania/Delaware
Sectionals last weekend. Twenty
teams competed to earn the five berths
to the Mid-Atlantic Regionals and
take one step closer to Nationals.

Swarthmore faced a difficult task, as
the fall is the Club season with no
restrictions on eligibility (in contrast
to the College season of the spring).
Swarthmore A entered Saturday
seeded eighth, lower than many felt
was appropriate, while the B team
was seeded 18th. Both teams faced
four games of pool play, withthe top
three (out of five) in each pool moving on to elimination games on Sunday. Swat B was 1-3 in their pool,
including a rousing 13-5 victory over
the 15th seeded Carnegie Mellon A.
The A team faced their first loss of
the season to the best team in the
section, Philly Rage. However, they
were able to keep that game close,
and dispatched their other three opponents with ease to go 3-1 on the day
and move into Sunday's games.
Sunday began with a bye, as
Haverford forfeited the game. As a
result Swarthmore moved to within
two victories of the final Regionals
seed. The top four seeds were automatically given to Saturday's pool
winners, and the final seed was up for
grabs between the second and third

spots from each pool.
Swarthmore's first opponent was
Hoover, the third club team from
Philadelphia. Swarthmore took this

spectacular game 16-14. This put
them in the final game against Delaware. Swat moved out in front early,
and kept their lead throughout to win
15-7 and earn the right to play October 19-20 at Regionals.

The women's cross-country team
will compete Saturday in the Seven
Sisters' Tournament at Vassar.
Co-captain Danielle Wall '97 feels
the team has the potential to make a
strong statement. "The amazon
women are on the war path! We've
been working hard and we're ready
for one whangdoodle of a race."
Coach Ted Dixon has high hopes for
the team as well and predicts they
will finish in the top three.
Meanwhile, the men's team will
journey to Carlisle, PA to compete in
the Dickinson Invitational. It will be
a good test not only of individual
running ability but of how well they
come together as a team. With Dixon
at Seven Sisters, the men will have
nothing to guide them but instincts,
desire, and team unity. Thirty teams
will be competing on the fairly flat
course, including Gettysburg, Allentown, Haverford, and Franklin &
Marshall. The name of the game will
be going out fast and staying furious.
Both teams will return during the
October break to prepare for competition at Allentown on October 19.
