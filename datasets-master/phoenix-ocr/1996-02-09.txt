"Nothing less than the future ofthe

blatantly unconstitutional." Lawyers
say the language is vulnerable in court.
"The constitutional problems seem
insurmountable," said Nicholas
Allard of the law firm Latham &
Watkins.
Supporters,of the Act, such as Sen.
Jim Exon, D-Neb., who sponsored
the law, expressed confidence it
would withstand the legal challenges.
"The ACLU continues to raise red
herrings that have nothing to do with
our proposal," he said. 'The legislation will not ban works of art or
medical warnings because they would
not be 'in context, patently offensive' under the Supreme Court's indecency standard used in our legislation."

Ordinary Web pages have various

Hall was skeptical of the effectiveness of this form of protest: "It's a

Despite the widespread public outcry, Swarthmore students and faculty

SC Approves Black Coffee Charter
By Thanh Hoang and

Erik Huneke

Student Council has decided to approve the charter ofBlack Coffee, an
African American a cappella group,
but has yet to decide as to whether it
will allow other organizations to restrict their membership without classifying themselves as support groups.
Vincent Jones '9B, the Budget
Committee liaison to the Student
Council who has no vote in the Council, explained that Black Coffee applied for a charter limiting its membership to African Americans, a provision which would normally apply
only to support groups.
Before this, organizations not classified as support groups had to include a non-discrimination clause in
theircharters in order to be approved.
Jones saw two ways of dealing with
Black Coffee's charter: eitherrejecting it because of the lack of this
clause, or accepting it on the condition that an exception be made for
performance groups, many of which
already discriminate, for example,
on the basis of gender.
The Council decided instead to
grant Black Coffee a special charter,
which allows it to be officially recognized withoutmodification ofits char-

ter, but the Council must still decide non-discrimination clause would be

women and men gathered at a Washington, DC hotel to fulfill literally the
promise Reddy made in her popular
1962 song, including about twentyfive Swarthmore students.
The Expo, coordinated by the Arlington, VA-based Feminist Majority Foundation, was a combination of
three distinct events. Open all weekend and always busy, the Exhibit
Hall was a place to learn about
women's organizations from all over
the country and abroad. Many of the
Expo's 299 sponsors and speakers
had their own booths, as did a number
of women-owned bookstores,
women's health programs, business
groups, public service organizations,
and artistsand musicians. Rumki Saha
'9B said, "I was impressed that they
addressed so many different aspects
of feminism, from things like policy
and economics to art and literature."
The Feminist Majority also set up
three super-booths thatexplored feminist architecture, voter registration,
and female sources on the World Wide
Web. This Expo was also the first
conference to be simultaneously
broadcast online worldwide, according to Ellie Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority and the driving
force behind the Expo.
More than 50 different symposia
were also part of the weekend's opportunities. Led by a panel of leaders
in their respective fields, these gatherings covered a huge range of topics, from "LinkingFeminist Arts and
Feminist Activism" to "Beijing and
Beyond: Bringing AboutEquality for

Women Worldwide;" from "Keeping Healthy: What Young Women
Need toKnow" to Feminist Film and
Video screenings. Kelli Tennent '9B
said,"The incredible number of powerful speakers was really impressive
to me, that so many important, worldshaking people were there in the same
place with the same goal."
Similar in format to the smaller
symposiums, the General Assemblies
covered areas of political concern,
educating all participants in the issues and choices that they will be
asked to make this election year.

Tarble Renovation Plans Underway
By Thanh Hoang and

Erik Huneke

Plans for renovation and possible
configuration of Tarble are already
underway. A committee chaired by
Larry Schall, associate vicepresident
for facilities and services,
brainstormed about making more
flexible and efficient use of the space
available last Friday.
Right now, Tarble serves more as a
campus rather than a student center.
The committee must also decide
whether the building should be devoted mainly to the needs just of
students or to those of students and
non-students alike.
It hopes to be able to guarantee a

variety of flexible meeting spaces to
suit as many .of these purposes as
possible.
In the current configuration, spaces
are isolated from one another. The
consulting architect, Daniela Voith,
has explored ways to increase accessibility between these spaces, although no specific time frame has
been established for these renovations.
Seth Harvey '97, former Student
Council member, began working on
these proposals last semester, which
then tookthe form of the replacement
orrenewal of much of the equipment
in the game room. He hopes that
further renovations will make Tarble
more appealing for student use. He

believes that the possible establishment of a Student Center would be
better suited to a different space.
In the meantime, Tarble might be
made more inviting through enhanced
lighting, easy chairs and other moveable furniture, and a centralized music system.
Longer hours for Essie Mae's and
a juke box may also serve to attract
more students. In the past, however,
Schall notes that keeping the snack
bar open longer was not cost-effective.
Although any actual renovation is
at least six months away, any refurbishments to be made will not interfere with use of the building as a
whole.

Borough Assault Raises Questions
By Abigail

Salerno

This week the College community
was alerted, via email, of an unusually violent and cruel crime which
occurred on and near the campus.
Saturday at 4:30 a.m. an elderly
woman, 84, called the Swarthmore
Police for help. Her home, just off
campus, had been burglarized, and
she herself had been assaulted. One
ofher attackers had been armed with
a gun.Police chased and apprehended
two suspects. The suspects now await
a preliminary hearing at Delaware
County Prison.
The alleged criminals, although reported in our Public Safety Awareness Bulletin to be boroughresidents,
were later described by Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave as
Philadelphia residents. One of the
suspects has been identified as being
previously acquainted with the victim, giving the police a motive for the
crime.
Police reaction was swift. Donald
H. Hill, Chief of Police for the Borough of Swarthmore, reported that
several police officers arrived within
half an hour from Media, Wharton
and Swarthmore. The Swarthmore
College Public Safety officersarrived
as well. A K-9 unit was brought by
the Ridley Township Police, and the
dogs were used to apprehend one of
the alleged criminals. Redgrave described our Public Safety officers as
"appropriately involved" in the capture.
He explained that as the emergency
was off campus and firearms were
involved, the situation was beyond
the authority of our Public Safety
officers, who assisted by relaying
communication at the scene of the
crime. Hill was on the scene and
personally saw to the ambulance

which carried the victim to CrozerChester Medical Center. Redgrave
described the effort as "good cooperation and teamwork" which brought
"a quick and peaceful resolution to a
difficult crime."
The Chief of Police said that the
preliminary trial for the two men apprehended is scheduled for the thirteenth.No Swarthmore Public Safety
Officers have been asked to testify,
explained Redgrave, as our Officers
were "not actively involved in apprehension." Swarthmore students cannot expect to be updated on the
progress of the trial, Redgrave said.
This may be the last we hear of this
for a while; follow-ups rarely occur,
and then only in outstanding cases,
where arrest has not stuck. The trial
will be covered by the Philadelphia
Inquirer and the News of Delaware
County.
At Public Safety, Redgrave reports
few reactions from the Swarthmore
campus and Sally Kline, Chairperson

of the Borough's Public Safety Committee, has described the event as "a
police matter, not a public matter."
Chief of Police Donald Hill reported
that he had heard some public concern, both fear for personal safety
and inquiries about the victim.
On campus, senior Jim MacLeod
said he considered our community
"beautiful and generally safe" and
found the violent crime"shocking in
an area this nice." Erika Krick '9B
said that the crime made her "nervous," compared to last year's crimes
which she describedas "minor." She
decided that she will be taking the
shuttle home to Woolman now. The
Chief of Police offered assurances
that in the event of an on campus
crime of a similar nature the police
would be equally quick to respond.
He affirmed that "students are very
much a part of the town" and in matters of protection

Students Voice Concern over Fairness of Work-Study
By

Scott Reents

The issue of the fairness and efficiency of Swarthmore's "workstudy" program is gaining increasing
relevance in the atmosphere ofrising
tuition costs and talks of federal cutbacks in student aid. Tuition now
runs at $28,620 per year, a sum that
would put a Swarthmore education
out of the reach ofalmost 50 percent
of the present student body, were it
not for financial aid.
In order to make Swarthmore more
affordable, the school has provided
over nine million dollars in scholarships this year alone. In comparison,
the work-studyprogram is quitesmall.
About $BOO,OOO will be spent this
year in student salaries and wages (to
around 1000 students), though only
about half of the students on the payroll are on work-study.
One potential concern is that students who need jobs will not be able

to find them. Even students who have
campus work aspart of their financial
aid package are not guaranteed a campus job.Laura Talbot, Director of the
Office ofFinancial Aid, explains that
there is a "gendeman's agreement"
by which, in the first week ofclasses,

employers will give preference to
work-studyparticipants, all otherfacbeing equal. John Freeman '96

trouble finding a job, he's noticed
that the most popular jobs, such as

abilities.
MarkKuperberg, Professor ofEconomics, believes it is relatively common for students to make campus
employment decisions based on
something other than money. In hiring teaching assistants he's found
thatthe supply ofworkers was "100%
a function of the number of Junior
and Senior Economics majors,"and
notat all a function of salary."People
do it for honorific reasons," he said.
Student employment does not follow
the rules of a market, and, in Professor Kuperberg'sopinion.itshouldn't.
"People don't marketize their families either. There's a lot of information flowing around Swarthmore,
which means that you don't need
markets" to allocate resources efficiently.

Some people and organizations
have found a way around the salary
cap. Wilber,for instance, worked offcampus for a year in order to help her
parents meet their"expected parents'
contribution." And at least one organization has found a way to pay more
than the maximum $5.68. They have
agreed to bill more hours than the
student works so that his effective
wage is eight dollars per hour.
Whether these cases are the exception or the rule is a matter of dispute.
Talbot says that a proposal to change
the way wages are set at Swarthmore
has not been brought up in recent
years, and she sees little reason to
change the system of central planning. Wilber faults the system for too
little central control rather than too
much. She thinks that students, especially freshmen, should be placed in
work-study positions, so that the
school's generousfinancial aid is accompanied by guaranteed and consistent access to jobs.

"We are fortunate to have a very

must take responsibility for his orher
own safety, for we all know it is
impossible to ensure perfect safety
and that there are many trade-offs

which at the margin might enhance
safety but which, for enjoyment of
life reasons, few of us would choose
to make."
With this in mind each ofus should

President Bloom remained undecided about what kind of dishes will
ultimately be used in the cafe. "As I
discussed with the students who initiated the petition last semester, it is a
complex empirical question as to
whether china or recyclable paper
would have a lesser negative environmental impact."
The president of the college maintains that environmental issues are
not the only ones to be considered.

In response to demands from the
environmental organization Earthlust, S warthmore President Al Bloom
has agreed to see that a dishwasher be

Near the end of the fall semester,

Study Abroad
Remains Popular
Despite Changes,
Explains Bloom
By Alastair Thompson

Although Swarthmorc students
must now pay full Swarthmore room,

board and tuition fees when studying
abroad, even if the program they select is less expensive, more students
have decided to study overseas. One
of the reasons for this is that study in
a foreign country can provide students with an alternate view of the
world, one they may not be able to
acquire on the campus.
According to Courtenay Dunn '97,
who spent last semester in St. Petersburg, "I think I'm always going to
look at America differently,knowing
that other people's lives are completely different." She notes that it
was interesting to observe a country
in transition.
Another junior who studied in Russia last term, Holly Quinn, said, "I
still felt like I learned a lot about
myself, and my Russian improved
immensely." If students have such
high opinions oftheir time spent overseas, and the College, as the '95-'96
College Bulletin says, "emphasizes
the importance of study abroad and
encourages all students to explore
possibilities for doing so," then why
is it necessary to raise the prices for
those wishing to study abroad?
Steven Piker, anthropology professor and the head of the faculty
committee on foreign study, told The
Phcenix that the primary reason is
budgetary. The change at that time
was projected to reduce the foreign
study budget by 15 to 20 percent.
However, students who are eligible
for financial aid while at Swarthmore
will now be able to retain it even if
they study in another country. This
will enable some students to consider
study abroad who otherwise could
not afford it.
President Bloom said,"As most of
you know, several years ago the College approved a new payment plan
for foreign study which was implemented last year. It helped the College to strengthen its overall foreign
study program and to ensure that financial aid students can continue to
participate fully in foreign study.
"The improvement that has taken
place in advising for foriegn study, in
the selection and oversight of programs,and in the procedure available
for granting credit as well as the
marked increase in the number of
students on study abroad this semester are all, I believe, indications ofthe
success of the greater investment in

foreign study for all of us."

Democracy and the Swarthmore education.
S warthmore College is not a democracy. For those to whom this comes as
a surprise—though we doubt there are many of you—here's why:
•No students and no professors are voting members of the Board of
Managers, which makes final decisions on everything from tenure to tuition
to campus construction.

•Most Board decisions are based on the recommendations of on-campus
groups like the College Planning Committee and the College Budget Committee, each of which includes just two students among 17 members.
•These committees also require members to keep most informationabout
their work confidential, thus severely restricting the community's ability to
share its views with the committee before decisions are made.
•As limited as students' involvement in decision-making is, many low-paid
members of the staff have an even smallerrole. For instance, no members of
the housekeeping and maintenance staffs serve on the major administrative
committees.
We're not about to ask for true and total democracy—the College's budget
should not be set by majority vote of all students, faculty and staff—but we
do think that some changes are needed. For one thing, it's hard to believe that
a process that manifestly excludes many members of the community can
consistently yield decisions that adequately serve the interests of all. But even
if, as some members of the faculty and administration have argued, more
openness and more student involvement would lead to chaos and would
produce poor decisions, Swarthmore should still move towards a more

democratic system.
The College Bulletin states that "Swarthmore seeks to help its students
realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential combined with a deep
sense of ethical and social concern." Developing this ethical and social
concernrequires courses in political science, philosophy, psychology, history
and a host of other areas, to be sure, but it also requires practical experience.
Participating more fully in College decisions will teach students to look at all
sides of an issue, to find solutions that work for as many people as possible,
and to build consensus when they can.
Even if students presently don'tknow how to be responsible and involved
members of their community—which is one reason why some people are
afraid of increased student involvement—they will learn ifgiven the opportunity. This is an institution of higher education, and education need not and
should not stop at the classroom door.
And you have to wonder about the message Swarthmore is sending to its
students, future citizens all of them, when it says that open and inclusive
decision-making is not the best process for setting policy. We don't want to
say unequivocally that democracy is the best political system. But we suspect
that if professors or administrators or Board members thought some other
system would work better, they would have spoken up by now, and not just
on this campus but in a more national forum.
We don't see anyone arguing, in public at least, that the U.S. Congress
should write the Federal budget in secret, or that some people's votes should
count more than others. If you believe such things, please say so; you'll make
an important contribution to national politics. But if you think otherwise, do
something about it: put your beliefs into practice right here, at Swarthmore.

Spring semester promises to please.
Kudos to the Social Affairs Committee on what has, so far, been an
outstanding semester for students' social lives. From the Dr. Booty concert on
January 27 in Tarble, attended by just about every student we know, to the
Game Room open house last Friday night, an imaginative idea that showed
how effective SAC can be when it plans its own events, we've been having

fun.
And the last two weeks have been quite a contrast from last semester. On
more than a few Saturday nights last fall, we found ourselves sitting in our
rooms, wondering where SAC's $BOO per weekend was going. Either there
were no SAC-funded activities or the party seemed like a repeat from the
weekend before.
Among the events we have to look forward to: Screw Your Roommate,
Movie Night, Murder Mystery Night, an indoor "beach" party, Spring
Formal, Worthstock. Even GailHand, "a comedian with a message," according to Social Affairs Committee co-director Matthew Minero, will be "on
hand," so to speak, for a performance later this semester.
This semester has also been enriched by a variety of theatrical events,
spearheaded by the production of George Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the
Man" last weekend. In subsequent weeks, we will be treated to "The Heidi

Chronicles" and "Swarthmore Follies."
As if this were not enough, the Department of Music and Dance is hosting
FebFest, a celebration of the performing arts. Orchestra 2001, the Colorado
String Quartet, choreographer David Dorfman, and world-renowned organist
David Craighead will all be performing on campus in the next few weeks.
Many student music ensembles and groups will also give the community a
sampling of their prowess on Saturday, February 17.
We look forward-to the flurry of activity in both dramatic productions and
musical and dance performances. We also applaud SAC's effort to fund a
variety of parties and other social events this semester. Keep up the good
work—we appreciate it

EDITOR

Student responds to the recent discontinuation of "Wisdom and the Healing Arts"
To the editor:
I am writing in response to Jonathan
Reed's "Healing Arts Course Funding Expired,'' from last week's issue
of The Phoenix. My intention is primarily to expand upon and clarify
some of the points made in thearticle.
But I would first like to mention
some points that article left out
The class in question, "Wisdom
and the Healing Arts" (S & Al5), has
two important attributes which were
not mentioned. First of all, this is no
normal course. Its methods and subject matter are as progressive as they
are refreshing. The material covered
is, relatively speaking, unique. You
will not find any other courses offered at S warthmore that overlap with
"Wisdom and the Healing Arts."This
is a crucial factor which the administration ignores in deciding to cut the
class.
Second of all, and shamefully omitted in last week's Phoenix article, is
the most important fact of all: this is
the Soc/Anth class people most want
to take. "Wisdom and the Healing
Arts" does not over-enroll; it doesn't
even double-enroll. It quintuple-enrolls. If this class is discontinued,
then we students must question what

trated how it would be difficult for
her to 'maintain authority over a volunteer instructor'." This seems to
imply that, asProvost, Mrs.Keith has
some sort ofeconomic leverage over
professors, that by controlling money
sheretains authority. What this somewhat unethical attitude ignores, however, is the fact that after Dr. Posner
was told money was a problem, his
response was to offer to teach for
free. Obviously, his commitment to
teaching goes a littlefarther than cash.
Mrs. Keith does not realize that she
already has the leverage. While the

weight our academic agenda carries.
Empirically speaking, the termination is clearly against our interest.
Next, I would like to make a clarification, which is not only important
in itself, but in what it implies. Mr.

To the editor
I hope to ease the unnecessary fears
some students and parents expressed
after they read the February 2 Phoenix

Reed begins one sentence thus:
"When [Provost Jennie Keith was]
asked if the course could be offered if
Dr. Posner was willing to work
gratis..." In fact, the offer was not so
conditional. You see, sympathetic
friends in the administration have

revealed that Dr. Posner has offered
to do so; in fact, in his first semester
here, Dr. Posner did teach for free.
The generosity of this offer and the
commitment to teaching it demonstrates seem especially telling in light
of Mrs. Keith's reply.
Mr. Reed summarizes Mrs. Keith's
response: "...she did express her personal thoughts on the subject. Since
the Provost is ultimately responsible
for all faculty members, Keith illus-

in his work that he should be a role
model for his peers. The perspectives
and knowledge he offers are unique
among Swarthmore professors. In

addition, his warmth, openness, and
personal dedication to his students,
are resources that the College should
not waste.

In conclusion, a few questions: first
ofall, if this really is merely an issue
ofeconomics, then why is Mrs. Keith
"hesitant" in the volunteer teaching
offer? Certainly, her reason seems
somewhat inadequate. Allowing
charitable teaching does not necessarily entail loss of authority for the
Provost. Such logic is preposterous.
Secondly, if money is truly at issue,
how can a school with the endow-

ordinaryprofessor may respond to an
economic incentive, Dr. Posner's in-

volvement in teaching evidently runs
deeper. Given his demonstrated commitment, why is Ms. Keith concerned
about retaining her leverage?
It isprecisely this commitment that
makes the decision to cut "Wisdom
and the Healing Arts" unfathomable.
To cut a class so unique and popular
is in itself ridiculous, but to remove
from this intellectual community a
man so knowledgeable and committed to teaching is unconscionable.
Howard Posner takes so much care

ment we have justify paying for a
purely decorative, non-functioning
sundial on the side of a building and
refuse to sustain such a valuable
course? Why does areporter from the
Philadelphia Inquirer consider the
course so unique, socreative, so valu-

able that he is interviewing students
and auditing the class as he prepares
an article for publication?
It seems clear that more than eco-

nomics are at issue. The real reasons
for the decision are unknown: it is

possible that the multidisciplinary
nature ofthis course discourages departments from continuing it for fear
of diluting their own academic agendas. It may also be that political issues were at stake: perhaps the course
was just a little too "progressive" for
the allegedly liberal Swarthmore elite.
In any case, the bottom line is
simple: "Wisdom and the Healing
Arts" is a unique and probing course
taughtby an extremely dedicated and
caring professor. The students themselves choose this class more than
any other class in its department, and
yet it is the first to be eliminated.
Having taken "Wisdomand the Healing Arts" myself, and having had the
pleasure and honor ofbeing taughtby
Howard Posner, I must strongly encourage students to take it upon themselves to protest the cancellation. I
honestly cannot express how disturbed I will be every time I have to
walk past that sundial and think of
what we as a College have gained in
my time here, and what we have lost.

First, although federal funding provides the majority of student financial
aid resources nationwide, only five percent of the grants Swarthmore students
receive are federal! Federal funding to
Swarthmore has stayed level or declined
since 1980. This is one reason our scholarship support to students has increased
at such a great pace. Otherreasons? This
year we are aiding many more students

continue. To help meet our families'

$19,400. That is also our average offer.
Last week's article mentioned
Amherst College for its "more gener-

generous but, according to the most recent comparable figures, not so generous as Swarthmore. In fact, the average
aid offer made to the prospective Class

College Tuition Increases Reflect Skewed Priorities
By

Jude Uzonwanne

Were those who advocated that
education be made available to all
citizens of a nation-state to appear
among us as college-age students today, they would probably be denied
education. Why? Because a top-notch
college education nowadays is absurdly expensive, and the cheaper

equivalents are simply inadequate. If

families cannot afford to spend
roughly $29,000 each year for a quality education, students must attend a
second- or third-tier school, one with
inferior facilities and a considerably
less intellectual atmosphere.
Education, especially college education, has been priced out of the
reach of what was once called the
middle class. In the last decade, tuition at colleges and universities has
been increasing at twice the rate of
inflation; last fall, for example, fees
rose by an average of six percent,
ensuring that, with each passing year,
more students are priced out of the
market for education. The result?
Their future is uncertain; this leads,

not surprisingly, to resentment, frustration, and anger towards academic
institutions, which, curiously enough,
do not consider the laws ofconsumer
sovereignty applicable to education.
Why is this? Let us move beyond the
standard economic answers about the
need to keep college revenues in line
with the rate of increase in cost of
scholarships and financial aid, and
examine the real consequences of
this trend.

Across the United States, decisions
about the increase in tuition are usually made by a coalition of adminis-

Heresy and Persecution at Swarthmore
By

Brian Schwartz

I spent the fall semester of my
junioryear at Harvey Mudd College,

where there was relatively little student political activism. I found the
lack of political discourse refreshing,
and when I thought about why, I
realized that being at Swarthmore
makes me feel like a heretic.
A heretic is one whose views differ
from an accepted belief or doctrine.
At Swarthmore, this doctrine ismodem liberal ism, whichis watered-down
socialism. It has nothing to do with
the Latin liber, meaning free, except
for the nominally "free" libraries,
education, welfare, health care, etc. I
am a liberal in the original sense of
the term: I support pure capitalism,
and hence a government protecting
people's freedom, as in their civil
and economic liberties. Since the New
Left stole the term liberalism, my
views are now classified as "libertarian." I think it is immoral for any
person or institution (including government) to wield power to redistribute wealth without the consent of
those who earned it.Coercion occurs
when one puts another in a non-consenting relationship, using or threatening to use force in order to impose
a particular set of values.
Youmay wonder: how can one feel
like a heretic here, of all places? At
Swarthmore, modern liberalism is as
popular as ethical relativism, which
states that no claims about moral issues can be true (except those made
by moral relativism). How could a
Swattie become so dogmatic about
the morality of modern liberalism?
Let me recount some Swarthmore
experiences that have made me feel
like a heretic. I am not trying to argue
for my views here.; I am merely relating my college experience as a defender of reason, individual rights,
and capitalism.
Most of the incidents I recall involve one of two types of responses
by modern liberals: arguments from

intimidation and ad hominem remarks. The former are attempts to
make me feel bad or unpopular for
holding my opinions, whilethe latter

are, translated from Latin, "at the
man," or attacks on my character or
background rather than my views.
In my freshman year, I wrote an
article for Common Sense, in which I
used a metaphor of a soccer game
involving children to describe the
market: I compared government intervention in the market to helping
some kids in the gamebut not others.
My point was that some government
policies keep people on their back in
trying to fix problems caused by previous governmentaction, thereby creating a vicious cycle of government
interference. The RA in the adjacent
hall wrote, "I like helping kids," on
his board. Gee, so do I. A hallmate
said to me disdainfully, "I know what
you were advocating." Gee, so did
I—but he achieved his goal: he distorted my point and made me feel bad
for advocating capitalism.
In the fall of my sophomore year I
responded to signs in Parrish that, to
put it mildly, spoke against theories
and advocated action on whim. When
I spoke about the importance of theo-

tuition went up and more people found

themselves in need, they had to seek
out means of paying. This generated
anger that will not soon dissipate.
Colleges seem to be dropping fees
today will be considered more student-friendly, until recently not an
especially influential notion. In fact,
some analysts now view the quiet
tuition reductions as the beginnings
of a price war. Students may soon
read internet and newspaper advertisements of colleges advertising their
latest discounts ($6,000) suchas those
being offered by St. JohnFisher Col-

lege in Rochester, NY, to transfer
students or Lebanon College,
Annville, PA, which is offering a 50
percent discount for students in the
top 10 percent of their high school.
Now, where does our own
Swarthmore fit into this picture?
Some would argue that Swarthmore
would never be reduced to bidding
for its students. Stranger things have
happened, though, and arrogance, in
any form, always blinds one to reality. Ask The New York Times, which
recently addressed falling print circulation by establishing an online
version. Higher education may be
facing a similar predicament: why
pay so much to study international

economics, when the same knowledge is available elsewhere for less?

swarthmoreis currently in tne process of determining its fees for the
coming academic year. It would be
beneficial to the entirecommunity if

Swarthmore's College Budget Committeereminds itself ofthe College's
philosophical commitment to building a community of citizens committed to serving society. With that in
mind, Swarthmore will not need to
even enter into the debate currently
raging elsewhere about the need to
revoke need-blind admissions. To
change those policies would signify a
major philosophical shift
In addition, Swarthmore should set
the agenda rather than reacting to
events. Take the recent shift of the
admissions dogfight to the internet;
why did Swarthmore not anticipate
that? Must our decisions always be
reactive? The College needs to make
its decision-making processes more
democratic and participatory: more
students should be included in college committees, such as financial
aid, that directly affect student life.
Better rapport between the student
body and administration would benefit the school immensely; guesses
about student interests cannot substitute for actual input. Nor, in the same
way, should economic decisions ignore the social consequences ofCollege policy.

fare. A few students accused me of
not caring for the poor. When I explained that I was for private voluntary charities, someone asked ifI had
given to any. Was that person trying
to argue that since people didn't do
what he wanted them to do (give to
charity), forcing them to was justified? Another student accused me of
holding my beliefs because I am a
white middle-class male, which I
found both insulting and logically
unsound. Later that day, I left the
table after hearing thefollowing from
a young woman: "Yes, I want you to
suffer [for the sake of those already
suffering]." Wow, a true egalitarian:
she wants everyone to sufferequally.
I should add, however, that the ensuing debate on swat,talk about welfare
was very peaceful.
A similar incident occurred in a
discussion on the walls of Parrish
regarding California's Proposition
187.1 took neither side of the issue,
and cited the central problem as the
very existence of the public schools
and health care. The response was an
appeal to authority—an assertion that
since theUnitedNations Bill ofRights
(modern liberal scripture, I believe)
says that a person's being born gives
him a right to what certain others
produce, wealth redistribution is
moral, and benefiting from it is a
right. There was also a Rawlsianclaim
that since I went to a private school (I
did not), of course I would not think
the government should coercively
redistribute wealth.
There were more logically unsound
responses to my ideas after my short
letter to the editor in The Phoenix,
"Are 'Liberals' Really Tolerant?" To
be intolerant, I said, was to force
someone to pursue or support an-

other person's values, and taxation
does just that. In our country, the
government forces people to support
industries, schools, art, charities, research, and wars they may not approve of. I reasoned that taxation is
intolerant, and is theft.
Among the responses in ThePhoenix was a hellfire-and-damnation
speech; I was a sinner at the hands of
an angry statist The author called my
views "silly diatribes against taxation... from an Ayn Rand worshipper," and askedreaders to "thinkBrian

I am reminded of a particularly

"I don'tknow. I just bring the food

In that light, I believe the problem

children become young adults, this
leads to a lack of interest in books as
a whole. These problems have serious ramifications in later life. My

Despite the research indicating that
healthy, low-fat diet is beneficial for
everyone, Sharpies continues to serve
high-fat hot meals. Fried food,
cheesesteaks, and chicken wings are
almost always present. The vegetarian bar for the most part provides
slightly healthier food, but, even there,

package. Many students would ben-

efitfromknowing the nutritional contents of at least one, and preferably
more than one, hot entree.
In talking with other students, I
concluded that most of them want to
see less fried foodand lighter food in
general, as I have stated above. They
feel that there should be more nonred meat choices of hot meals. Along
this comment, fish would be a good
addition (baked orbroiled, not fried).
Others complained about the fruit, as
much of it is unripe; better fruit options might encourage students to
incorporate healthier food into their
meals. Another student objected to
having a "breakfast bar" at dinner,
and others suggested that when a
certain ethnicfood is served, the other
bars should contain additional

choices.
We all know thatwhat we eat influences our lives immensely. It affects
the way we feel, think, and act The
old adage, "You are what you eat,"
still has merit Why should we settle
for unhealthy food?

These and other horrific puns are
brought to you courtesy of
S warthmore's own Pep and Funk Brass Band,
which performs at most home football and
basketball games with gusto.
Janine Sperman '95 and Josh Sperry '96
started and chartered the band last year; Rafi
Dowty '9B is now its "de facto coordinator,"
and fellow trumpeter Casey Smith '99 its
President of Public Relations. Other prominent members include the "infamous" Chip
Tilley '96 on sousaphone, Matt Coddington
'99 and Jerome Bushnell '99 on drums.
The band usually plays at home football
and basketball games, although last year it
also played at softball, volleyball, and soccer
games. Dowty said that while most of these
sports do not traditionally lend themselves to
a pep band's accompaniment, "softball was
fun . . . and the players seemed not to mind
us." He added that the band's favorite oppo-

nent to play against, in any sport, is clearly

Ursinus.
The band formerly practiced about once a
week. Now, they rarely practice. Just before
games, they all meet to rehearse the StarSpangled Banner. "We would like to practice
more, but scheduling and space are big obstacles," explained Dowty.
The band's reperetoire is fairly small, and
as Coddington pointed out, anyone who has
played on a high school pep band and most
band members have—has learned the standard songs and measures inside out.
Usually, the band numbers between seven
and ten people. Some have been there since
the beginning, others have only recently
joined. Dave Mimno '99 earned member
status by drumming at one game.
"We are always looking for people who
want to come out and play some easy music
and have some fun supporting Swarthmore
athletics," said Dowty. "Just about any normal band instrument is welcome, especially
if you play loud." Coddington said the band's
—

mailing list, which numbers about fifteen
people, is significantly larger than its core.
However, objective commentary on the
Pep Band was difficult to find. Neither Nikyia
Rogers '99 nor Cathy Wirth '99 had ever
heard the Pep Band actually play, though
both knew of its existence. Sarah Cross '99,
when questioned, replied: "What Pep Band?"
Christian Mikkelson '99 reported, "The
drummer was exceedingly talented," though
it should be noted that he lives on
Coddington's and Bushnell's hall. Bushnell
himself said that Pep Band was the "inexorable essence of effortlessly ingesting effluent egotist effrontery."
Dowty and Smith are eager to recruit new
members. Dowty voiced concern over the
looming loss ofSperry and Tilley whileSmith
said, "We don't have enough people to be as
effective as we'd like." She added, "You
don't necessarily have to play an instrument
to be in this pep band." Anyone interested in

By

Jessica Harbour

The

new drama ensemble troupe,
"Blood, Love, and Rhetoric", which
held its first set of auditions Monday and Tuesday, was born when friends
and neighbors Elizabeth Nickrenz '99,
Jenny Briggs '99, and Mary Meiklejohn
'99 discovered their common passion for
theater.
"I've always loved to perform," said
Meiklejohn, and Nickrenz agreed: "I'm
always sad when the play ends."
The idea of an independent ensemble
group grew out of Briggs, Nickrenz, and
Meiklcjohn's attempt to direct a spring
production of the Tom Stoppard play
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead".
The trio was intimidated by the logistics;
finding a place and time for the performances, appealing to the Drama Board
for funding, and so on.
In lieu of an organized production, then,
the three decided to put together a group
which will share directing and acting responsibilities and produce shows in aNight
of Scenes format. Nickrenzsaid the troupe,
which will number about ten people total
(at least for now), will perform "as often
as possible."
All three have considerable acting and
performing experience. Meiklejohn recalled memorizing and reciting poems "to
anyone who would listen" when young
and later became actively involved in
high school theater. Briggs, for years, has
specialized in "historical storytelling" for
young audiences, which means taking on

different kind of drama club

the part of a historical character and telling the tales of that era. Nickrenz has
participated in workshops and high school
productions; she directed a senior year
production of "The Heidi Chronicles".
The three plan to continue working
with "Blood, Love, and Rhetoric" (an
allusion toßosencrantzand Guildenstern)
for their entire four years at Swarthmore
and then passing it on to the next group of
performers.
What will this new group be like? First
of all, no improvisational comedy
"We
hate improv," Meiklejohn said. All of the
members will share directing and acting
responsibilities. Briggs said she wanted
the group to stay small and "intimate."
Most likely the group as a whole will
meet once a week in Palmer lounge
all
three of the co-founders live in Pittenger.
Each of the individual scenes will rehearse separately.
The scripts will be an "eclectic" and
"mostly weird" combination of scenes
from various plays; as of yet, no plans are
in the works to produce a full play. "If
there was a play that we all loved and had
the right number of parts, we'd do it,"
said Meiklejohn, but she hastened to point
out the problems inpaying royalties, since
"Blood, Love, and Rhetoric" receives no
funding.
As they looked forward to the actual
auditions, the co-founders seemed fairly
confident and excited. "This is something I've always wanted to do," said
Nickrenz, while Briggs added, "This is
what I wanted a drama club to be."

Philadelphia Blues Hall Great Place to Relax
By

Tom Fowler

and

John Freeman

The

average blues hall is little more than
a concrete slab with walls, a sinking
tile roof, a loud P.A. system, and a bar.
But Warmdaddy's near the Philadelphia waterfront is not an ordinary blues hall.
Rambling bluesmen are welcomed to the
Philadelphia blues scene by solid oak woodwork, rich but dim lighting, and a long, cozy
bar. Warmdaddy's enjoys being not only one
of Philly's only blues halls, but one of its
finest restaurants. On the menu are deep fried
everything, black beans and rice, cornbread,
a full selection of beers, and small-batch
bourbon whiskey.
As the leader of the house band, Frankie
"The Soulman" Alstin, so eloquently growled
while grinning widely and rubbing his vast
belly. "Mmmmmmmm, this food's not so
bad. huh?" We can attest to the quality and
quantity of the fried catfish and barbecued
shrimp platter, and the enveloping easy feeling experienced when sipping a glass ofKnob
Creek Kentucky bourbon.
While far too posh to be authentic, details
make Warmdaddy's an easy place to relax
and soak in deep blues tradition. From the
exterior, adorned with bright and bold stained

glass murals, to the interior where warm
greetings await, visitors easily feel at home.
We were asked if we'd been to
Warmdaddy's before, and with our response
of no, were subsequently given a briefintro to
the room. There are three seating options;
from the small tables and chairs bunched in to
the left of the stage, to the bar at the left rear
of the room, to the spacious dining area
complete with booths immediately in front of
the stage running to the back of the room.
Each night, the band plays three sets, at
around 8, 10, and midnight, through all of
which you are invited to stay. Between sets,
the band lounges near the front, willing to
talk to those bold enough to approach them,
while searing blues videos by the likes of
Koko Taylor, John Lee Hooker, and Albert
Collins blare on the TV monitors. Friendly, if
not a bit slow, waiters and waitresses are
receptive to questions and eager to suggest
favorites on the menu.
Why such a luxuriant atmosphere chosen
as a forum for a music rooted on dirt roads and
deep south shanties? Who the hell knows, but
it works because the music, like the food, is
the real thing. Nobody howls and screams
like Johnny Copeland, who played there last
month, and Koko Taylor, who is scheduled

Residential Life at Swat Rejuvenated by Resident Assistants with Creativity
First Person

A Day in the Life of Two
Willets Resident Assistants
By Jeremy Weinstein and John Todd

When

we walked into the
mailroom last March,
hands trembling and
wet with sweat, searching our
minds, struggling to remember our
combinations, we couldn't stand
the pressure— inside that dark,
dank hole lay the envelope... our
future... our ticket to grad school...
or maybe justan indicatorthat the
Deans really liked us (just kidding... wink, wink).
It was March 1995. The day
when RA appointments were announced. With a mixture of fear
and courage, we grabbed a hold of
what would inevitably be our fate.
Taking a deep breath, we ripped
open the envelope, like thatreally
big present under the Christmas
tree (or on the third day of
Hannukah), and... "Dear John and
Jeremy, We are pleased..."
Ourscreams of excitement were
heard in Mary Lyons, we think,
and we kept reading, "Your RA
assignment is in..." wait... wait...
"Willets". WILLETS!?!?!?!?
Fast forward to the first weekend of Fall semester. After jello
wrestling, canoe trips, duct-taped
group activities, and a bit of RA
training, here we were in the big
time.With 100 wild first-years
America's future Hannibal
Lechter, Charles Manson, Michael
Dukakis,KaizerSoze, Alicia Wilson, and Jerusha Klemperer—we
braced ourselves for the worst...
and it happened.
Try this for a first weekend: fire
alarms, Chester Crozier Medical
Center (if youbecome an RA, you
will know this place well), tired
arms from heavy suitcases, icebreakers over and over again, hall
themes, and some senior who

threw a table through the window
and we know who you are).
And remember, this was just the
first week.
We are writing this article at a
very reflective point in our RA
careers. With applications due
next week, all RAs have been
thinking about this past semester
and making plans for the future.
Who wouldn't love having an
excited, enthusiastic group of 1832 new best friends at the beginning of a semester? Or being told
that your efforts to support your
hallmates and make Willets life
fun are appreciated? Even more
positively, as an RA in Willets,
you can be a great resource to
your hall: waking up at 3:30 AM
to help dorm-mates cook
NOODLES in the basement
kitchen, teaching them how to
swim on a slip-n-slide on Ist
South, and providing clothing for
those who encounter public safety
in times of undress.
So sophomores and juniors, you
ask, "Is it worth it?" Upon the
announcement of this great opportunity, you will be thrust into
a position of leadership, counsel,
and friendship like no other at
Swarthmore or in the world. At
three o'clock in the morning, or
during finals week, you are oncall for your hall, your dorm, your
Deans, and your country.
So, as we all submit our reapplication forms with an incredible experience behind us, and
you are answering that long list of
questions for the very first time
(so, what are your weaknesses
anyway?), don't even think of
requesting Wharton. It's our turn,
baby.

A few
By

of this year's RA's offer some insight about the REAL job requirements...

Kirstin

Lindermayer

The

Dean's Office makes the
role of a Resident Assistant
seem relatively straightforward. Each RA is expected to be
responsible for "maintaining an atmosphere suitable for studying and
pleasant community living in theresidence hall" and is asked to be "competent in and comfortable with providing general informationand counseling on academic and personal
matters."
An RA is asked to be the keeper of
the peace, to salvage potentially lame
study breaks, and to explain the concept of a WA to first-years. However,
the real life of an RA goes far beyond
these concrete responsibilities.
Whether they reign in Mary Lyons,
Willets or Parrish, Swat RAs go far
beyond what is asked of them. They
face prank after prank, lose many
hours of sleep and privacy, and still
generally manage to have a good time
in the process.
Jon Evans '96, the RA on the first
floor of ML, has often demonstrated
his unique approach to cheering someone up. "One time someone on my
hall was depressed and after we had
cried about it for a while, I remembered that the people across the hall
had taken my tool hostage and demanded a ransom. So the two of us
dressed up as bandits and burst into
the room where my tool was. We
were wearing red bandannas and had
water guns. We were fast enough that
we didn't have to use the guns, but
later I came home and saw that the
same two people had toilet papered
my entire room. It cheered her up."
Alicia Wilson '96, the RA on
Parrish Fourth East, helped many of
the women on her hall with traumatic
events and struggled throughout the
fall to "keep everybody' s headsabove
water."
Wilson knows that many members
of her hall feel vertically isolated
from the rest of campus. This year,
she came up with a new idea to keep
spirits high: "People don't like to

climb four steep flights of stairs, so

ing with me, ye of the Chicago preference). Now, while the choices
around here are all a little too greasy
for my liking, I have ordered my
share of pizza over the last few years
at Swat.
With the beginning of this semester came the usual—a flood of fliers
slid under dorm room doors from the
local pizzerias and restaurants advertising their special deals. But, this
semester brought a new twist in local
pizzeria advertising —the Pizza Wars!
With its grand opening at the beginning of the semester, Appetito's
Pizza and Grill advertised the lowest
prices for student specials ever: $5.99
for a large cheese pizza with two
large sodas.
Shortly thereafter, Alfredo's countered by handing out fliers with special February offers for a large pizza
with two sodas for only $5.50, two
large pies for $9.99, two medium
pizzas for $8.99, and two free sodas
with a large cheese steak or hoagie .
Then, just a few days later,
Appetito's struck back withfliers for
their own February Student Special
a large one-topping pizza and two
sodas for only $5.49, a two foot
cheesesteak or hoagie and two large
sodas for $7.75, and two large cheese
pizzas and two liters of sodafor $9.99.
Other than Pizza House's "Super
Bowl Special," which gave two large
Cheese Pies for $9.99, other area
pizzerias have not offered such huge
—

Pizza House offers different deals
every day of the week including a
large cheese pizza and 10 hot wings
for $7.00 on Mondays and a large
cheese pizza on Tuesday and
Wednesday for $4.50.
Renato Pizza continues to offer its
"Renato Super Deal", which is a
"Large Cheese Pizza and Jumbo
Soda" for $6.99 or "Any Large
White, Red, or Marinara Pizza
with one topping" for $7.99.
S warthmorePizza also
continues its deals of
one large cheese
pizza and two
large sodas for
$6.60, two large
cheese pizzas and
one two-liter bottle of
soda for $13.99, and a
two-foot cheesesteak or
hoagie and two large sodas
for $8.25.
Now, you've undoubtedly heard
some stories about this guy, who
owns this pizzeria, who used to work
for this other guy, and now has his
own place. Well, the truth is even
weirder than any gossip I had heard.
In 1981, a man named Moses
opened up Swarthmore Pizza. Some
time later, Renato opened uphis own
pizzeria closer to the college. Moses
had a nephew, Alfredo, who worked
as a delivery man for his uncle.
About three years ago, Alfredo decided he wanted his own business,
and bought a pizzeria from Renato.
He began to target the Swat crowd by
offering a slightly lower price than
his uncle and remaining open slightly
later. Moses and Alfredo operated

turns out

that Sam left Alfredo on somewhat
less than joyous terms. The people at
Alfredo's see Appetito's deals as personal attacks on them. Rima, spokeswoman for Alfredo's, said "Sam is
trying to beat us knowing we have a
good reputation with the college for
having good prices and quality." She
explained thatafter Sam was fired, he
started his own place in order to go
head-to-head with his former boss.
On the other hand, Sam claimed
that he had worked hard at Alfredo's
for two years, seven days a week.
When he felt it was time to get his
own business, he gave Alfredo two
weeks notice, and then opened his
new restaurant.
While the two avoid each other's
company, they are not publicly expressing anger toward each other.
However, Sam noted that it is interesting that Alfredo was able to drop
his prices so much (Alfredo's Student
Special dropping from $6.99 to $5.50)
and that neither Swarthmore Pizza
nor Renato seems to be getting upset.
Sam claimed that his business is
booming and that he is going to have
to hire two drivers for Thursday
through Sunday evenings, with sometimes 30 to 40 pizzas being ordered in
an hour.

Swarthmore Pizza, Renato, Pizza
House, and Alfredo all reported that
after an initial trial period whenbusiness slowed, their loyal customers

returned to them. Said Rima of
Alfredo's Pizzeria: "Sam is a driver,
and not a cook, [and while] lots of
students have tried Sam's pizza, they
returned to Alfredobecause they don't
care about a small difference in price,
but rather for quality and service."
Moses, of Swat Pizza, said that
while he felt some effects of the price
wars, the majority of
Swarthmore Pizza's business
does not go to the college any
more. He also said that he
can't lower his prices without lowering the quality oi
the pizza.
Larry, from Pizza House,
said that his business wasn't
affected for a long time because Pizza House's "pizza
is better and [their] wings are
hotterand cheaper" than anywhere else.
Renato
Meanwhile,
boasted that his pizza is "obviously [the] best pizza ever
served in Swarthmore College [and that] the price is
a
maybe little higher because [he
uses the best quality ingredients, so
[he] sells at what price [he] can sell"
Student response was mixed con
cerning the arrival of Appetito's o
the scene of pizza delivery. Jac
Schecter '96, who delivers fo
Appetito's, saidhe's "pulling for Sam
and hopes he makes it". Jack also
noted that, "Sam wanted to mak
sure I pointed out that it's not jus
cheap pizza, but it's good too".
Matt Jacobson '97 and Jim Tracy
'97 liked the free topping offered by
Appetito's, and as Dana Yamate '96
pointed out, "there's not as much
grease you don't have to flip over
the slice and [rub it against the box
top]".
However, Dan Sachar '97 disagreed, stating, "I'm willing to pay a
little extra for Renato' s since it comes
quickest, hottest, and freshest."
While I think all Swatties were
excited about the new pizza deals,
and many of us do have strong loyalties, I'm sure most students support
Reuben Canada '99 in his belief that,
"When I'm hungry, its quantity, not
quality I look for in pizza." If it's
open, and they' 11deliver in the middle
of the night, that's what's going to be
ordered.

good relations.
Then Sam entered the scene. Like
Moses and Alfredo, Sam immigrated
to the United States from Lebanon.
He worked as a delivery man for
Alfredo for last two years.
Re- cently, however, Sam left

hallmates as the Sun God, and can
barely go ten minutes without a
knock on his door.
Tim Heffernan '99 sees Evans'
mainrole on the hall as the provider
of "comic relief."
Evans feels that his experience as
an RA has been incredibly fulfilling. "The reason I was happy to get
my hall is because they told me that
it would be well-bonded. It's the
people that make this hall. I love the
people. Being an RA has been the
ultimate climax to my Swarthmore
experience.'.'

"mental toughness" and ability to play

There's More Than Just Basketball
By Anne

Frankenfikld

Coach Lee Wimberly knows a lot
about basketball. He also knows a lot
about priorities and being happy in
life. He knows about these things
because experiences involving each
one have shaped his life and made
him so successful.
Wimberly grew up in Medford,
Oregon and attended Stanford University, from which he received his
undergraduate degree in psychology
in 1968. He then studied at the Columbia University law school for one
year before transferring to Berkeley
Law. His college days were influenced by the aura of the sixties era.
From 1969-1970, Wimberly commuted to school from a commune in

achieve that success," he said.
Wimberly not only is proud of his
player's academic achievements, but
their achievements on the court as
well. In 1991, his first class of recruits had reached their senior year.
That year, the team went on to win the
most games inaseason in the school's
history and also clinched the MAC
(Middle Atlantic Conference) tide
for the first time in over forty years.
Following that impressive season,
Wimberly was named the Kodak
Regional Coach of the Year and was
a finalist for the Division 111 National
Coach of the Year award.
The success of Swarthmore's basketball team has been one of positives and negatives. Last year, the
team was a co-champion in the Centennial Conference Eastern Division.
This year, the team beat Lafayette
College, a Division I school, for the
first time in fifty years. The news
madeESPN Sportscenterand the team
was featured in various national publications.
Wimberly's accomplishments at
Swarthmore have been amazing, converting a virtual walk-on team into a
recruited championship team. However, he does not want the students'
academic priorities to get confused
with their athletics.
Hebelieves that athletics are a very
important part of the college experience, especially the liberal arts education of Swarthmore, which should
promote well-rounded individuals.
However, they should not be the most
important part
"I wish in general that extra-curricular activities, whether debate,
dance, chess club, etc., were given a
little bit more importance, because a
liberal arts education promotes wellrounded students. Academics are
great, but there should be time set for
kids to be able to be involved in
activities where it doesn't interfere
with academic activities,'' he said.
Wimberly has definitely been an
asset to the Swarthmore academic
and athletic staff. Through his accomplishments on and off the court
he has shown that great academics
and great athletics can work together.

Swarthmore recorded a 28-16 win

Track Team Taking Titles
Squad Runs Away With F &M Open
By

Nevin Katz

This past weekend, Swat's Track
Field Harriers performed magnificently at the Franklin & Marshall
meet, where all the giants of the conference stepped up to show their stuff.
This was doubtless the most exciting meet yet for the Swat Team, with
more athletes than ever jumping into
the arena. Awesome performances,
combined with "Go Swats!" coming
out of every corner of the field house,
helped Swarthmore make a strong
impression on the Track and Field
community.
Graham Lucks '9B and Duncan
Kirkpatrick '99 teamed up to battle it
out in the 3000. Shoshanna Pearlman
'9B, leader of the women's distance
squad, placed second in the 5000.
Wyn Strodtbeck '9B, Swat's top
middle distance runner for the season
so far, came across in the 1500 at a
4:11, capturing an all-time 4-second
personal record.
Gordon Roble '99 had a viciously
strong performance, slicing through
competition in the 800, a race
reknowned for its grueling intensity,

Saturday carried more bad news
for the matmen as they traveled
through the fresh snow to the gently
rolling hills of Western Maryland. In
a tri-meet against Centennial Conference rivals Western Maryland and
Ursinus, there were few positives for
the squad. The Garnet suffered what
might be the

history of the

The sprinters also came together to
let loose torrents of competitive fury
in virtually every event. The men's
4x200, with SamPaschel '96,Reuben
Canada '99, Richard Okello '99, and
Eric Pakurar '97, ate up a healthy
portion ofthe competition, careening
into 3rd place. Canada flew into 2nd
in the SSm hurdles, busting through
his previous all-timebest performance
by .3 seconds.
Mike Turner '96 and Danielle
Duffy '9B ran especially inspiring
races, both of them capturing first
place one right after another in the
men'sand women's4oom. Catherine
Laine '9B set an all-time schoolrecord
in the 55m-dash, capturing third with
a time of 7.80.
Finally, the meet ended in a thrilling climax with the the men's 4x4
team of Paschel, Turner, Canada,
and Okello powering into first place.
Combined with their5 -secondbreakage of the school record last week at
Boston U, it's not hard to tell that this
relay team is going places. Despite
all die breakthroughs that the team
has seen so far, the end of the track
season lies far off in the distance, and
thus it's no doubt that the best is yet
to come.
This coming weekend, the Swat
Team will be competing on theirhome
turf, in which many of Swat's Distance Warrior Women will make their
track debuts.

Other season-best swims were recorded by Ariel Behr '9B, Shari Linden '99, Erin Fulkerson '99, Alice

Sarah Wemeck '96.
On the men's side, Kendrew Witt
