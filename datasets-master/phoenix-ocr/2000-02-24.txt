SBC recommends $45
activities fee increase
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff

!

The Student Activities Fee is
about to rise significantly.
The fee, currently $226, would
rise by $25 plus inflation for the
next academic year and an additional $2O plus inflation the following year in a proposal likely
to win Student Council approval
on TUesday. The proposal was approved by Student Budget Committee (SBC) on Sunday.
The increase in the fee is necessary to restore depleted funding in SBC's capital replacement
account, according to committee
officials.
The committee has spent much
of the reserves in that capital
replacement account over the
past year by funding new equipment for WSRN, buying two new
vans and purchasing additional
sound equipment.
"Wealso had a bunch [of equipment] that was stolen and a
bunch that was damaged," said
Student Budget CommitteeTreasurerLaura Farra 'Ol, who added
that unexpectedly high costs for
the Halcyon yearbook this year
may have to be partially paid for
from that account.
The end result of those purchases and others is that the capital replacement account has been
drained. Farra said the account
currently has a balance of about
$29,000, down from about
$lOO,OOO several years ago.
Since the committee estimates
equipment will need to be replaced every five years, that
leaves four years torestore about
$150,000 to the account, said the
committee's assistant treasurer
Marvin Barron 'O2. Otherwise, he
said, students four years from
now would be paying an even
higher Student Activities Fund
(SAF) fee to make up for a lack
of planning now.

But despite the large SAF fee
specified in the proposal, spending on student groups would not
rise faster than inflation. That
means spring budgeting may be
tougher this year, because budget
requests from student groups
have beenrising faster than inflation. In fact, while each year's student activities fee is supposed to
include money for replenishing
the capital replacement account,
there were no such funds left after spring budgeting last year.
Barron said that pressure on
the student activities budget
would
lead
to
greater
prioritization. "The consensus on
BC is to spend money more efficiently," he said.
"I think we're going to have to
start monitoring ourselves," said
Farra, who said she hoped to
avoid an across-the-board cut in
activities funding.
The committee, in tabling at
the front of Sharpies last weekend, had presented four options
to students, including no increase
at all, the approvedplan of a $25
increase followed by a $2O increase, a $4O increase next year
rather than the phased-in increase over two years, or an increase of over $4O to allow for
increased student spending as
well.
According to Farra, most students
about 130
preferred
the approved option of a $25 and
$2O increase, about 30 preferred
the first option of no increase, 50
wanted an immediate $4O increase and about 14 preferred an
increase greater than $4O.
Farra said that with the exception of students who advocated
the impossible suggestion of using the college's endowment to
replenish the account, students
were supportive of the increase.
"It feels like people have a good
understanding of what this
money goes to," she said.

Long Screw season ends; games begin
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
For those who have been in hibernationfor the
past five weeks, it's that time of year again the
time when we dust off our dog-eared Cygnets,
dish out the Sharpies gossip like mashed potatoes and learn how much our roommates love us.
The excitement surrounding Screw Your
Roommate this year is intense, and secrecy is
suffering as a result; many curious students already know who their dates are.
Then again, many of us have known since the
very beginning who the person waiting for us in
theSharpies big room Saturday night will be. Lists
of potential dates are frighteningly common, and
even without those, not-so-subtle hints abound.
Some of us stillhave a sense ofScrew decency.
Andrea Wong 'O2, who doesn't yet know the identity of her date, commented, "It [would be] just
-

embarrassing to tell my roommate straight out
exactly who I wanted." A few hints didn't hurt,
though. "I told mutual friends actual names of
people, and I was hoping that they could pass
that on to my roommate."
Not only are we stretching the rules a bit,
we're also starting the game a bit early. Many
freshmen, (who tend to be more excitable and
less jaded than the rest of campus,) have been
screwed since January.
Wong discoveredthis when she began the search
for the next love of her roommate's life a month
ago. "I thought I was ahead of everyone else, but
by the time I started calling, apparently all of the
screwable men were taken. Every guy I called had
a waiting list, and it was totally absurd."
Wong eventually found a match for her roommates, but the process has made her reluctant

Freshmen attend Free Mumia planning conference in New York
By Mara Hvistendahl

Phoenix Staff

Six freshman took part in a national

Planning conference in New York Citylast

weekend for the movement to free Pennsylvania death row inmate and political
activist Mumia Abu-Jamal.
The group hopes to now generate enfor Abu-Jamal's cause on campus.
Because of Swarthmore's proximity to
themovement's epicenter,
Philadelphia,
they hope that students here will take an
specially active role.
According to Jacob Hodes 'O3, the conference allowed the Free Mumia forces to
sfrategize for this spring, whichmarks a criti-

ergy

cal period in AbuJamal's case. A Philadelphia-based federal judge will decide
in April whether to
allow new evidence
into the case. The
inmate's supporters
know that an affirmative decision will
increase
their
chances of getting
Mumia Abu-Jamal
him freed from
death row.
The international movement to free AbuJamal sprung up over concern that the
African-American activist and radio per-

sonality was arrested for political reasons
and sentenced to death in an unfair trial.
Abu-Jamal, once active in the Black Panther Party, frequently addressed incidences of police brutality on his radio show.
Abu-Jamal was arrested in 1981 for the
murder of a police officer after intervening in a confrontation involving his
brother, another man and the officer. He
was later sentence to death by Albert
Sabo, the judge who holds the national
record for death sentences distributed.
His Swarthmore supporters emphaiszed
that, although theFree Mumia movement
centers on his individual case, it is important to view their efforts within a broader
frame. As they increase awareness ofAbu-

Jamal's situation at Swarthmore, Hodes
said, "We want to stress...that the issue

about Mumia's trial reflects a lot of larger
issues, such as the way that the deathpenalty is applied in this country and how tied
it is to race and class."
The Swarthmore group, loosely affiliated with the Swarthmore Progressive
Action Coalition and tentatively titled the
Mumia Abu-Jamal Action Group, will take
this message to the campus soon with,
among other activities, a teach-in and a
documentary screening.
OtherSwarthmore students whoattended
the conference were Rebecca Amdemariam
'O3, Ayanna Butler 'O3, Chela Delgado 'O3,
Hang Le 'O3, and Pilar Mendoza 'O3.

Bourgeois denounces SOA
By Marina Boevska

SC co-chair Brandon Silverman listens attentively Tuesday night.

SC improves student life
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Although Student Council has not recently effected any largescale changes, a series of more modest changes intended to approve student life have been enacted over the last few weeks.
The changes include adding 30 new parking spaces for students
and a comic book room in McCabe. "It's a lot of small things
that go unrecognized but add up," said Student Council member David Choe 'Ol.
An attempt to rectify the parking crisis on campus, led by
Student Council co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol, has resulted in a
potential agreement by the college to lease 30 more spots in the
Ville. The acquisition of these spaces, which are currently available for independent rental, would bring the total number of
spaces available for students up to 160. As those who currently
rent the Ville spots know, the spaces cost $2O per month. In order to cover this increase in cost, Student Council is considering
instituting a $4O yearly fee for all student parking spaces.
The dimly lit and rarely used lounge behind the stairwell on
the ground floor ofMcCabe is to be converted into a periodical
lounge. In order to make the space more habitable, renovation
plans include raising the floor and installing more lights. A
highlight of the project is the introduction of a comic book collection. The comics themselves will be donated by students,
with a large number coming from Greg Erskine 'Ol and Brandon Silverman 'O2. McCabe staff will look after the collection
and begin subscriptions to a number of comic book reviews.
Silverman, co-chair ofStudent Council, realized the project with
the assistance of librarian Peggy Seiden.
After personal difficulties last semester, Silverman has
vowed to try to improve the medical transportation system. In
the system's current incarnation, technically anyone who has
a college parking space can be called upon in an emergency to
transport someone to the hospital or a doctor's office. In addition, a small number of students are on salary as medical transporters. This setup, however, is inefficient and, Silverman believes, "really poor." The proposal currently under review suggests hiring more students as transporters and guaranteeing
them free college parking spaces in addition to their salaries.
Another system under review involves the chartering procedure for student organizations. Student Council is debating
a new rule that requires organizations to return to the charter
committee every two to three years. As Silverman explained,
to continue receiving student monies, "they would have to prove
their worthiness." Silverman hopes this would prevent basically defunct organizations from continuing to receive funds.
With Housing Committee's inability to reach a unanimous
decision about coinless laundry machines, Student Council has
picked up the discussion where it was left off. The most recent
proposal wouldretain the existing coin-fed washers but make
the dryers free. This compromise answers concerns about unnecessary use of the laundry facilities, since the process would
not be entirely free. It also addresses student frustration with
the poor quality and unpredictable nature of the dryers.

Father Roy Bourgeois, founder
and director of the School of the
Americas Watch, spoke last Monday to a filled Scheuer Room
about the history of U.S. support
ofLatin American counterinsurgency groups and the future of
the human rights organization
that grew out of it.
Bourgeois founded the School
of the Americas Watch to advocate the closing of the School of
the Americas (SOA), a U.S. military training schoolinfamous for
its history ofrecruiting and training Latin American dictators and
their followers. SOA has been
nicknamed the School of Assassins.
Bourgeois put it bluntly when
he said, "This school has brought
a lot of suffering, a lot of death
to our sisters and brothers in
Latin America."
Bourgeois opened his presentation with an emotional appeal
to his audience, reciting the work
of Otto Rene Castillo, a Guatemalan poet killed by the right-wing
regime in that country because
of his advocacy for the impoverished. Millions of Latin Americans are starving and living in
poverty, Bourgeois said. "They
need our help, and we are called
to be healers, peace makers and
compassionate to one another."
Bourgeois' social activism began during his military service
in Vietnam, where he worked at
an orphanage and came to realize the extent of American intervention in foreign countries. After studying to become a priest,
Bourgeois visitedLatin America

and was witness to grassroots
efforts there to protest dictatorships and resist American neocolonialism. He founded SOA
Watch upon his return to the
United States.
SOA Watch began small but
grew quickly, said Bourgeois.
The organization's first operation, a late-night raid of SOA
which resulted in its members'
arrests and incarceration, involved only ten protestors. But
when SOA Watch broadened its
mission to include public education and more conventional protests, its membership jumped to
150 for its second operation and
300 for its third.
Today, SOA Watch focuses on
publicity, as Bourgeois believes
that public outcry will bring
about an end to SOA most effectively. For the past two years,
Swarthmore students have attended a much-publicized annual
protest at Fort Benning, Georgia,
where SOA is located.
Bourgeois heartily thanked
Swarthmore students for their
participation in the Fort Benning
protests and encouraged more
students to take part. "This
movement is strong, our hope is
very alive, but we need more
voices, we need your voices, we
need your energy," he said.
But Bourgeois was also optimistic about his group's efforts,
expressing his certainty that
SOA will soon be closed. "I don't
feel powerless. This movement is
strong and our hope is alive.
"You inspire this movement.
Do not doubt for a minute that
what you are doing is important."
After his presentation, which
included a slide show with pho-

tographs from Latin America
Bourgeois fielded personal ques'
tions from eager students.
Asked why Congress still sup.
ports SOA and its curriculum
Bourgeois hypothesized that
their desire for an open gun market and political influence in the
region plays a large role in their
continued support of the academy
The Scheuer room was filled
with active participants in human rights movements, opponents of such movements, and
students curious about SOA
Watch. Solidaridad, a campus organization that promotes human
rights in Latin America, is already "intimately connected with
SOA
Watch," said Ben
Schweigert 'O2, the group's coordinator. Solidaridad regularly
sends representatives to the
meetings of SOA Watch in the
Northeast and works closely with
them in planning activities in
Philadelphia, including a rally
planned for March 25.
Schweigert was enthusiastic
about the event. "The man is an
inspiration to me," he said of
Bourgeois. "I thought that he astutely framed the issues in a compelling and accessible way."
Linda Panetta, director of SOA
Watch of Philadelphia, attended
the presentation and encouraged
students to support human rights
in Latin America. She asked students to write letters to their congressmen and to avoid buying
clothes manufactured in Latin
America, where exploitation of
laborers is thought to be rampant.
Dan Korobkin also contribute
to this report.

Athletic review committee to
present agenda before Board
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
The newly formed ad hoc athletic review committee, formed
in response to concerns about the
role of intercollegiate athletics at
Swarthmore, will present its
agenda before the Board ofManagers this weekend.
The committee's eventual goal,
its chairProvost JennieKeith explained, is to make recommendations for the athletic program's
future improvement based on a
thorough evaluation of the program as it exists. "Our charge is
twofold," Keith said. "First, to assess the health of the program...
as well as the health of the relationship between that program
and the mission of the college.
And, second, to make recommendations about how the college
should address those areas we
identify as needing improvement."
This process ofevaluation will
be largely student-centered.
Much of the information will be
obtained from interviews both
with athletes and those not involved in intercollegiate competition. Seniors, in particular, will

serve as a rich source of information for the committee. In addition, the committee will meet
with coaches, members of the
advisory group on admissions
and other members of the faculty.
As it touches on controversial
topics such as the role of athletics in admission decisions, the
committee's investigation may
result in heated debate. In order
to address many teams' lack of
competitiveness, the committee
will have to review fundamental aspects of the college's philosophy and could have farreaching implications in college
policy.
"I expect differences of view
about many things," Keith said,
"including the significance for
Swarthmore of a competitive intercollegiate program and the
appropriate level of reliance on
recruiting in athletics."
According to Keith, the committee has set December 2000 as
a deadline for the final report,
but will not adhere to this date
rigidly. The complexity of the
task may require more time than
has been initially alloted.
Currently, the committee is

composed of Board of Managers
representatives Neil Austrian, J.
Lawrence Shane, Barbara
Mather and Cathy Abbot, Dean
Bob Gross, Dean of Admissions
Robin Mamlet, Athletic Director
Bob Williams, and Keith. Professors Mark Jacobs (biology),
Janet Talvacchia (math), Hans
Oberdiek (philosophy) and Tom
Blackburn (English) will represent the faculty. Blackburn
chairs a related committee, the
advisory council to physical education and athletics. Student
members, who will form a separate liaison group, are now being
selected by the Student Appointments Committeeand the Dean's
Office.
In the end, Keith said, she
hopes that the ad hoc committee's
work will result in a better integration of intercollegiate athletics into life at Swarthmore. "I
hope that the committee's recommendations will contribute ...to
a stronger sense of connection
for all members of the college
community," she said.
Many other members of the
review committee declined to
reply to e-mails seeking their
comments.

to go through with Screw in the
future. "I don't think I want to do
it anymore, because it's so
nervewracking."
For many students, the hubbub
surrounding the dance stems from
an stagnant dating scene. Renee
Witlen 'O2 commented, "It's hard
to meet people
and have it become romantic. I find it hard to
meet someone random and begin
to see this as a datingrelationship."
For Witlen, the solution to this
...

problem lies in more manufactured dates (minus thebody paint).
Wong agrees that Swarthmore
dating culture is frustrating, but
she believes thatthe solution lies
in encouraging more real and
fewer blind dates. "I kind of wish
that people on this campus would
just learn to date casually."
Some day, perhaps. But come

try, lofts will make their fall 2000 debut in the smallest singles
on campus. Wharton CD residents also will gain privacy as the
section's two-room doubles are converted to true singles.
The lofts, which will look like standard dorm furniture, will be
installed in what students refer to as "closet singles," those small
rooms usually selected in the housing lottery after all the other
singles have been chosen. Until now, these rooms have had the
same furniture as other singles, with virtually no space in which
to arrange it. Rachel Adams 'OO, who lived in a closet single in
Willets last year, described her room as "small, very small." The
combination of the limited space and the window taking up her
whole wall made Adams feel as if she were "living in a television
set." Occupants of that room and others likeit in Willets, Wharton
and Worth should get some relief from the loft beds.
The lofts will be like bunk beds without the bottom bunk, according to Alice Balbierer, Assistant Director for Special Projects,
whois in charge offurniture purchasing for the college. She characterizes the smallrooms full of furniture as "just one big jumble."
The loft design will allow students to put dressers or desks underneath their beds, saving sorely needed space.
Some students have taken matters into their own hands, either
building or commissioning lofts even though their use in dorm
rooms is illegal. GeoffAnisman 'OO, a member of Housing Committee, explains that homemade lofts pose an unacceptable liability to theschool. The new lofts will be safer than homemadelofts.
Quality of student life was the most important factor in both
the decisions to convert the two-room doubles into singles and
to introduce lofts, which were brought before Housing Committee by Myrt Westphal, assistant dean of residential life.
Westphal writes that "lofts will give students more floor space
and hopefully make the room less claustrophobic."
Some of the new singles in Wharton will be among those that
receive lofts. Currently most rooms in Wharton CD are walkthrough doubles, which Westphal describes as "more difficult
living situations." By next fall, each room will have an outside
door, and the connecting door will be filled in, since retaining
all the doors wouldresult in too little wall space for furniture.
A current Wharton CD resident expects that the rooms in
that section, which usually go to juniors because they are walkthroughs, will house more seniors next year. The rooms will be
lotteried as blocks of four rooms at the end of each hall.

ETS-sponsored Poverty Awareness Week to kick off Monday
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
Empty The Shelters Fill the Homes (ETS) hopes to
burst the Swarthmore bubble next week with Poverty
Awareness Week on campus. ETS, which works with the
Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), has planned
several opportunities for students to learn about welfare
and the homeless, to meet with members ofKWRU and
to participate in the struggle against urban poverty.
ETS organizers say the week will follow the "twopronged approach" ofETS, striving both to spread awareness of poverty and to work withKWRU. On Monday at
4:30 p.m. in the Hicks Mural Room, a faculty panel on
urban poverty in the United States will discuss practical
issues of poverty. Panelists include philosophy professor Hugh Lacey, sociology and anthropology professor
Connie Gager, economics professor Robert Hollister, and
Russian professor Thompson Bradley. Political science
professor Meta Mendel-Reyes will moderate.
...

"Poverty Outlaw," a movie that will be screened on Tuesday in Kohlberg 115 at 9 p.m., is about the creation of the
KWRU in 1991. The KWRU was started by six welfare
mothers to fight against the strictness and absurdity of
welfare. The organization helps people meet daily needs
and navigate the complicated welfare system.
The studentbody will have the opportunity to meet some
of theKWRU organizers Wednesday at a fireside chat entitled "Beyond the Era of Civil Rights: Human Rights in
the Context ofEconomic Hardship in This Country." Galen
Tyler and Erica Morrison are the two KWRU members
scheduled to speak.
As the momentum of the week builds, the events aim to
increase personal involvement. Next Thursday night beginning at 9 p.m., ETS is holding a "sleep-out" on Parrish
Porch with members ofKWRU and their children. Lindsey
Newbold 'O2 explained that ETS has planned the sleep-out
"to remind people that some people sleep outside all the
time." The night will include music and informal sharing
of experiences. Newbold stresses that anyone is welcome

swarthmore crime lo:

at any time, and participants are not required to sleep over.

The week culminates in "Disappeared in America: Hid!
ing the Poor," a rally in Philadelphia on Friday, March 3
Swarthmore students can meet at the Rose Garden at 3
p.m. to join activists from across the state in a rally at the
State Office Building to protest the third anniversary of
Pennsylvania's welfare reform. The reform cuts off welfare recipients after two years if they have not obtained a
job and does not make allowances for welfare recipients
pursuing education, unlike the national guidelines.
The fifteen students who make up ETS at Swarthmore
feel passionately about their cause. Nina Schichor 'O2 joked
that working withtheKWRU, especially with Poverty Awareness Week approaching, is "pretty much all that we do."
Newbold welcomed the broader perspective that welfare rights work brings. "I don't feel like I'm in a bubble
because I'm so involved with this stuff," she said.
"We're trying to get people to think about poverty in new
ways," said Newbold. "These issues are everybody's issues."
ETS meetings are Thursday evenings at 9 in the CRC.

Raise the SAF fee
As students, we at Swarthmore live a fairly idyllic
existence. We are here by choice, our needs and wants
are provided for, and for the most part, there are no
limitations put on what we can or cannot do. And this is
the way it should be.
This is precisely why the recent Student Budget
Committee (SBC) recommendation to raise the Student
Activities Fund (SAF) fee by $25 next year and $2O the
following year is misguided. Despite the significant
jump in what we actually pay for our SAF fee, the
increase will actually result in spending on student
groups being raised only by inflation.
What does this mean? Let's put the economic mumbojumbo aside and cut straight to the heart of this issue.
At spring budgeting this year, when your support group
wants to initiate a new project, it won't be able to. When
your political group wants to bring a well-known
speaker to campus on top of its normal projects, the
funds won't be there. When you want to start a new
group, there will be no money to support you.
In other words, spending on student groups will be
frozen at its current levels. If SBC over-allocates this
instead, there
spring, it won't dip into extra funds
will be an across-the-board cut.
This is both unnecessary and unreasonable. As long
as the SAF fee is being raised by $45 over the next two
years, why not raise it another $lO and keep students
and their groups happy? What's another $lO to the
people who actually pay the SAF fee? Most students
here don't know what the SAF fee currently amounts to
and couldn't care less about SBC policies, but when it
comes to their groups and activities, they care passionately. The demands on the SAF are not simply going to
stop next year, and there is no reason SBC should act
like that will be the case.
So we urge SBC to give up its insularity and to
realize that handing over 10 bucks makes no difference to us, but the continued success of our student
groups does. Replenishing the capital replacement
fund for future generations of Swatties is a worthy
end, but it's not the only end.

All screwed up
Have you been screwed yet?
That question, of course, refers to the annual Screw
Your Roommate formal, which takes place this Saturday night. And if you didn'tknow that, you obviously
haven't been spending much time on campus this
month. This campus-wide rush to match up our roommates and friends with blind dates for a night reaches
such frenzied proportions that the whole ordeal has to
make you wonder what Screw is really all about.
Is the dating scene at Swarthmore really so dormant
that we jump at this annual chance to spend some time
with someone we don't already know? And is the
inability of one of us, or one of our roommates, to
secure a date painfully reflective of our campus-wide
social status? Regrettably, we believe that the answer
to both of these questions is yes.
Screw is so maddeningly popular because it provides
a rare opportunity to ignore the social difficulties of
dating at Swat the opportunity to meet someone you
don't know well, with relatively few inhibitions and no
expectations.

The problem, though, is that Screw subjects us to the
same sorts of problems it seems to address. With much
of the campus focused on finding Screw dates, the
unsuccesful roommates view their Screw failures as a
reflection of social desirability. There's a sinking
feeling one gets flipping through the Cygnet and
reciting, "Been there, done that." Too often, on this
campus, six degrees of separation becomes four, then

three, then two.

Screw is much-needed relief for an ailing dating

scene at Swarthmore. It is also a reminder that a night
°f blind dates just isn't good enough.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

'Purity test' unfair to badminton
lb the Editor:
I am writing in response to columnist Scott
Kushner's "purity" test last week entitled "Swat
sports: How pure are you?" (pg. 19) The aim ofScott's
column was to test how truly athletic the reader is by
asking an array of (humorous) questions. The one
question which didn't seem quite as funny (and the
one which prompts this letter) was, "Do you agree
that badminton is not a real sport?" A "yes" reply
scores athletic points for the reader, boosting his
machismo rating on Scott's scale.
Officially, badminton stands as the fastest racket
sport in existence, although one wouldn't think so
from popular (mis)conceptions and brandings of the
sport as a "backyard game" or recreational activity. Chances are, if you see badminton as purely
recreational and hardly athletic, it's because you
really haven't actually been playing it (the equivalent of playing wiffle ball and thinking baseball is
wimpy). In many countries, particularly in the East,
badminton is considered the national sport and is
taken as seriously and held as reverently as we hold
baseball or football here: a true sport, the champions of which are heroes. Badminton also has a longstanding tradition as an Olympic sport, with "birdie"
speeds in Olympic games often passing the 200 mph
mark. It seems to me, then, that the true athlete
would recognize the agility, quick reflexes, and superior hand-eye coordination necessary in badminton, making it a valuable addition to the wellrounded athlete's repertoire and most definitely
a "real" sport.
Swarthmore Badminton in particular is, ironically,
one of Swarthmore's most successful sports (and this
is not due to lack of competition out there). Players
on the team have competed at the national level consistently, at a school where few of our other teams
can make such claims. Current team members such
as Jane Ng, Siobhan Carty, and Karen Lange have excelled in particular with truly outstanding records
and, to me at least, they are no less inspiring than any
of our other top athletes.
I ask you to imagine for a moment that I had
printed an article on academic purity, and that I had
posed the question, "Do you play football?" or "Are
—

and that a positive
you a member of a fraternity?"
response would imply less intelligence. Clearly, such
a question would be in extremely poor taste. And while
I understand that Scott's test was purely meant for fun,
I also know that many people out there share the same
type of thinking: non-Western, non-muscular sports
like badminton are a joke. For the backyard, not to be
taken seriously— and certainly not something that
would ever cause you to break a sweat. Right? If you
answer yes, I suggest you come out to practice one
day and try hitting against one of us. If your bruised
ego (from the fact that you got so flat-out whooped)
doesn't teach you something, perhaps the sore muscles
in your neck, the aching pains in your back, that throbbing throughout your arm, or that thoroughly and decidedly sweaty t-shirt will be instructional. We at the
badminton team look forward to seeing you soon.

JIH-FANG "JENNY" YANG

Honoring
Malcolm X
Grace Lee Boggs
Asian American,
friend of Malcolm X and activist in the
Black Power movement
gave a radio
address Monday to observe the 35th anniversary ofMalcolm X's assassination. Listening to her remembrance of Malcolm
X, I learned something about how one can
be a real revolutionary.
Popular consciousness tends to write off
contemporary American revolutionaries
as militant. They can be characterized by
a one-time sound bite, like Malcolm's "by
all means necessary," or by a maniac willing to break the laws of the "oppressive"
system for the sake of "the struggle."
Boggs first admiredMalcolm for his powerful advocacy of Black Power. But it was
through knowing him until his death that
she understood the value of his "insistence
that individuals shouldbe held accountable
for their actions" and "his ability to keep
evolving and transforming himself personally, politically and philosophically."
Boggs learned from Malcolm that if you
are serious about being for "the struggle,"
racism should never be an excuse for "irresponsible socialbehavior." This is quite contrary to popular 1960s thinking, in which
social actions were committed spontaneously or in defiance for the sake o/defiance.
The Rosa Parks story is a perfect example of this misconception of the civil
rights struggle. Her oft-quoted remark,'!
was just tired," obscures the fact that she
had long been training for civil disobedience through her involvement in a wellorganized civil rights organization.
There should be no confusion about it.
Today's youth who aspire to enact social
change should not romanticize this legacy
and should not place distance between
themselves and the idea of the activist.
Some people do not get involved because
they incorrectly associate activism with
the anti-social actions that have come to
define activist behavior.
Such a misunderstanding will keep some
from maintaining a sustainable, long-term
and disciplined political lifestyle, or keep
others from beginning to act at all. Boggs
imagines that, had Malcolm lived longer,
we wouldknow that the core of an anti-status quo struggle was not and should never
be irresponsible behavior.
Malcolm was also a dedicated life-long
student of philosophy and self-improvement. He separated from Elijah
Muhammad and the Nation of Islam when
the black nationalism that had taken him
from the streets to political leadership became too narrow for what he saw was an
international struggle. At a black grassroots
leadership conference in 1963,heidentified
the class distinctions withinblack America
and compared the American black revolution to the Cuban revolution and anti-capitalist and -imperialist struggles in Asia.
Students of social activism as well as the
general public should carry on Malcolm X's
legacy by struggling, in Boggs's words,
"against those who deny us our right and
responsibility to govern ourselves,"
through making a life-long, disciplined
commitment to improving our own personal, intellectual and political lives.

Schulz's death like losing a loved one
By Andrea Wong
For The Phoenix
On Valentine's Day, one of my best
friends from home sent me a package. For
those of you, like me, who are thirsty for
postal expressions of affection, you can
understand how triumphant it felt to carry
this package around in the absence of
flowers or candy from a significant other.
I finally opened the package; upon seeing
its contents, I felt my breath skip, like
when you fall and get the wind knocked
out of you. It was a little plush Snoopy
hugging a sign thatread, "You're Special."
Normally, receiving this package would
have been the sole purpose of my ecstatic
existence for that day, but I could not help
but feel my heart deflate. It was only the
day before that I had heard of Charles
Schulz's passing.
Charles "Sparky" Schulz was born on
Nov. 26, 1922 in St. Paul, Minn. From a
young age, it was clear that Schulz had
artistic talent. "It seems beyond the comprehension of people that someone can be
born to draw comic strips, but I think I
was," he said. He was a student in a correspondence course in cartooning at what
is now the Art Instruction Schools, Inc.,
in Minneapolis. After graduating, his
cartooning career was postponed upon
being drafted into the military during
World War 11.
He excelled as a military figure as well
as the resident illustrator, decorating his
fellow servicemen's envelopes with cartoons of military antics.
After he returned to the States, he took
on two jobs: one for a small Catholicmagazine in which he lettered already drawn
comics and another job teaching at his
alma mater. During this time he actually
befriended someone named Charlie
Brown and had his heart broken by a redhaired girl.
Soon after several of his comics were
printed in the "Saturday Evening Post,"
he earned a weekly gig in the St. Paul PioneerPress, where Charlie Brown was first
featured in a comic entitled "L'il Folks."
United Feature Syndicate later signed
Schulz on as a full-time cartoonist. The
name of his strip was changed to "Pea-

nuts" because of controversy that the
name "L'il Folks" resembled the existing
names "Little Folks" and "L'il Abner."
When asked if he thought the strip would
last, he replied, "Sure, I thought it would
last. I never intended to draw something
that wouldn't last. In fact, when I started
out, I thought, 'l'll be drawing this the rest
of my life.'"
For fifty years, people all over the world
chuckled and cooed at the incorrigible
antics of the Peanuts gang. Children
dreamed of living Snoopy's many lives,
and girls fell in love with poor, misunderstood Charlie Brown.
Schulz died on February 12 from complications of colon cancer.
Charles Schulz's death leaves me with a
peculiar feeling I have felt before. When I
was twelve, my grandfather died from a
similar illness. This was the grandfather
who raised me from birth while my parents worked full-time, who catered to my
whims no matter how ridiculous. His youthful energy illuminated all my moments
with him in play, banter, and sleep. His loving embraces radiated rice, steamed fish,
and Chinatown all the things that defined
home to me. His deathleft me feeling abandoned, my childhood drained out of me. I
felt there was nothing more to illuminate
-

my life since the fantastic world my grandfather created for me fed on his presence.
Afterwards, I felt my outlook on life change
against my will.
Until the moment I opened up that package, I had never realized the parallels that
existed between the impressions that
Sparky's characters and my grandfather
had on me. The Peanuts kiddies brought
energy, innocence, and wisdom that
shaped the way I looked at life's idiosyncrasies. I idolized the characters as their
situations and trials often reflected mine
Lucy's impenetrable devotion for
Schroeder, Linus' attachment to his security blanket, Charlie Brown's eternal losing status on and off the field, and, of
course, Snoopy's delirium, provoked by
thoughts of an extraordinary mind amidst
the boredom of everyday life. While my
grandfather's death did not halt the continuing effect he has on my life, Sparky's
world will continue to live on in symbiosis with mine. But every time I cuddle in
my Snoopy blanket, read a Peanuts book,
or look at the myriad Snoopy and Peanuts
paraphernalia dangling from my walls, I
will remember the great man who started
it all.
Good grief, indeed. We'll miss you,
Sparky.

tETTERTOTHE EDITOR

Religion may seek truth, not agreement
To the Editor:
When I read the "religious politics"
opinion ("Religious politics create barriers," Feb. 10, pg. 9), I as a follower of Jesus
Christ was deeply disturbed. Not because
the words angered me, but because religion has caused so much painful discord.
But we should be able to separate any religion from those who grossly misapply
it. We should also be willing to respect
those who faithfully hold to their beliefs.
Christianity emphasizes that one's faith
in Christ should never be an excuse for
condemnation or needless separation.
Jesus Christ states in John 3:17 that "God

did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world
through Him." He tells everyone, "Do not
judge, and you will not be judged. Do not
condemn, and you will not be condemned."
(Luke 6:37) The Holy Bible teaches that
Christians should always act in love. When
we don't do this, we disobey God, and fail
to truly practice what we've been taught.
However, there are times when Christians are to stand firm in their faith. The
greatest commandment is "Love theLord
your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength."
(Deuteronomy 6:5) If required, we obey

God before men and take Jesus Christ's
claims of exclusivity seriously. He states,
"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life.
No one comes to the Father except
through Me." (John 14:6) Division should
never be a Christian's objective, but it may
be a result of obeying God.
Perhaps we should approach religion
not from the standpoint of how we benefit, but from the standpoint of what is
true and false. If we focused on truth, not
ourselves, we could eliminate much of the
needless conflict that arises between us.
As Christians, we do not claim to know all
the answers; we just believe we know the
Source of all the answers.
I feel that there is much validity in the
concerns raised last week. Religion has
caused much pain and grief in this world—especially by those who have claimed to
be "Christians." But we must be careful
to distinguish between true teachings of
a faith and misapplied teachings. At such
a diverse place as Swarthmore we should
all be able to learn from one another and
respect each other as human beings. We
should also realize that the answer is not
just agreeing with each other, but sometimes disagreeing to find truth.

Mugs. They're beautiful. They keep cof-

fee hot and your hands cool. They get you
discounts at Tarble.
Mugs are a hugepain. You have to carry
them. You have to wash them. You have
to remember to bring them with you.
Mugs reduce waste. Every time you create waste, there's a little voice inside you
saying "I don't care." I don't care what
the consequences are, for me, for others,
for the environment. You say, the convenience of this moment for me is the most
important thing in the world right now.
I have some things to say about this little
voice. Most obviously, it is important to
remember that it is lying to you. We live
in a complex and interconnected world.
The consequences of our actions are not
obvious, but they are important. I think
all of us have some values in common, and
we all fundamentally want to make the
world a better place.
Okay, you say, I care. But my one little
piece of trash isn't going to make that
much difference to the weight of the
world's problems, you argue. I can't tell
you how to value your convenience. You
may need your coffee now, or you're too
busy to wash out a mug; I understand the
feeling. It's very hard to make these
tradeoffs all the time.
I think everyone can understand the
concept that one piece of trash, times billions of people, times lots of time, makes
a lot of trash. Our individual ability to take
responsibility for the roles we play in this
tragedy is a highly personal issue. I could
spend a lotof time talking abouthow wonderful the world would be if everyone
made a little extra effort on some seemingly insignificant issues. I'd like to look
at the issue from another angle here.
A paper cup is a small thing. (I'll allow
you to ignore the fact that a lot of paper
cups, put together, makes a large thing.)
That little selfish voice in you is also a
small thing. It's natural. It doesn't make
you a bad person. But a lot of little voices
put together is a big thing as well. Little
voices get louder and louder. There's a lot
of hubris in that voice, and a lot of cynicism. If you hear it enough times, you start
to believe that you can do anything, that
you have no responsibility for your actions. This is dangerous. We need to become aware of these selfish thoughts, and
learn to control them, so that we can keep
them from showing their ugly faces later,
when we are in positions of power. We
wonder how the CEO's and senators of this
world can let things get into such a mess.
While "harmless" consumption and reck-

less corporate environmental endangerment can seem like very different things,
the difference is in scale, not in kind. It's
a slippery, slippery slope. Ignoring your
personal responsibility, your ability to do
good, is a habitthat becomes hard to kick.
The other point I'd like to make is this:
that other little voice inside you, the one
that tells you your actions are insignificant, can also turn against you. It can
plunge you into cynicism and despair. You
feel lost, you say. There are so many problems. Everything we do is evil, and you
don't have time to battle it all. The forces
of the bottom line are powerful, and it's
easy to feel helpless. I feel your pain. I
know how to help.

Due to thebiweekly nature of this column,
it is perhaps not always as topical as one
might hope. Thus, in the interests of the
public good that this column purports to
serve, and having been a victim of the process myself, I impart a bit of wisdom regarding that all-important (by which I mean
not important) decision: choosing your major. While I have not taken classes in all departments, nor have I repeatedly changed
my major, which would, presumably, put me
in a more learned position from which to
pontificate, I have engaged myself in sundry pursuits here, and I will, perhaps without cause, speak with the authority that
comes from gradual mental deterioration.
We'll begin with the big three, as I have
just coined them: biology, chemistry and
economics. Using the current logic ofpopular music, you should choose none of these,

Globalization
at a price
When we talk about globalization, images are conjured up: the giant sea turtles
of the Seattle protest, men in black suits
behind closed doors deciding the fate of
the world, workers in Vietnamese sweatshops churning out Harvard or
Georgetown sweatshirts at a few cents an
hour. This is certainly not an inaccurate
collage of globalization, but I'd like to
stress in the strongest possible terms that
globalization is not a process that is out
there, but ramifications of a process in
here, in our lives and our interactions, our
relationships and our hopes.
To start out, globalization is possibly
an inappropriate term. The world has
been getting smaller and more connected for a very long time now, and this
is generally a good thing. We have the
ability, if not the motivation, to reach out
and communicate with other people
from around the world, to solve differences and reach a deeper understanding
of what it means to be a member of a
worldwide group of human beings unrestricted by political boundaries. This is
the ideal, anyway, and many of the objections to the globalization process
come out of deviation.
The globalization process that was protested at Seattle is a move toward a set of
global markets as the structure of the future, not toward the ideal of the global
community. There is a vague sense that
this transformation is not right, and a
much more concrete understanding that
this represents a worldwide transformation that only a select few elite will control. Arbitrary global capital flitting
means no job security, no environmental
regulation and no labor strength.
Transnational corporations, with the blessing of the industrialWest, are taking countries and unions hostage by the threat of
relocation, because slave wages are better than no wages at all.
While all this is certainly happening, it
needs to be stressed that the logic behind
the evils of globalization comes from the
way we live our lives just as much as how
DaimlerChrysler or Amoco executives
plot to take over the world. The bare economic forces that economists shudder at
are turning our world and our lives into a
marketplace where the idea of inherent
value is absent, where everything is functional and we are alone. We are willing
accomplices, though, in our acceptance of
this model of who we are and how are lives
work.
Harsh neo-liberal economists provide
the best models of what the world should
be, where we are consumers and the world
exists as a market. We are willing to perpetuate Hobbesian war in Angola and suffering in Nigeria because we need gas in
our cars and diamonds around our necks.
That's not what I think we're about,
though. We generally do care about ourselves, each other and the rest of the
world. And this means that we've got the
strongest and the most enduring response
to global marketization within us. Come
talk to me about it even that would be a
step in the right direction.

I'm not always hip to the new slang, yo.
It was only last week that I learned how
pronouncing the last "t" in "Target" is a bit
of a faux pas. No matter what you hear on
television, the word actually rhymes with
resume. I am also excited to pass on the
news that "ghetto" has been liberated from
nerdy nounhood and now sits in the back
of the bus with the popular adjectives. Its
new meaning seems to be an ironical giggle
between "poor" and "undesirable." If I had
an Ambercrombie and Fitch rugby shirt,
for example, and it had a big hole on the
elbow, my shirt would be so ghetto. This is
because in the ghetto, presumably, all the
shirts have holes. Q.E.D., O.G.
All this (mostly) harmless wordplay
strikes yours truly as dope, yo. We all like
to play with things. Dumb kids play with
blocks. Smart kids play with words. No
worries, home-skillet.
I wish I could say the same for one of the
nastier slurs that's I've heard rolling off the
lips of some ofSwarthmore's top trendoids.
This self-selecting cognoscenti express
theirdissent by flipping one consonant ever
so slightly, and in so doing turn an entire
concept, nay, an entire institution, on its
head. Under the cover ofcool anonymity, a
bilabial oral stop assumes the nefarious
guise of a voiced lip-teeth fricative. I grant
thatthis petty act of subversion may appear
to be of no consequence. I mean, how much
harm can one consonant actually do, right?
It's just one letter, right? Wrong.

It would cost a lot ofmoney to subscribe

GUEST COLUMN

Affirmative action still needed
By LuisViera
The Oracle (Univ. South Florida)
(U-WIRE)
The widespread opposition to Gov. Jeb Bush's flawed anti-affirmative action plan is a sign that, despite
conservative opposition, democratic
grass roots organizations can still put up
a good fight.
The governor's plan shows his party's
cynical view. Scared at the prospect that
an anti-affirmative action ballot proposition would bring more minorities, the vast
majority of whomwould vote Democratic,
to the polls, the governor instead decided
to eliminatethe system through his office.
The result has been an even more militant community.
Defining what affirmativeaction is and
is not is vital. Republicans have increased
racial polarization by denouncing, inaccurately defining and calling for an end to
affirmativeaction. This is not a system of
'quotas.' Quotas were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court Bakke decision.
Affirmative action aims not to remedy
past wrongs, but to override the past's effects and enrich the future, make equal

opportunity a result and not simply a
promise, and prevent further discrimination by widening the net of opportunity
to qualified minorities and women. No
real affirmative action system will result
in "reverse discrimination."Affirmative
action is a constitutional and non-discriminatory means to a color-blind society. It is not an end in itself, nor is it "charity," for it empowers qualified individuals.
Perhaps President Lyndon Johnsonbest
defined why affirmative action is necessary, in regard to African Americans,
when he said, "You do not take a person
who, for years, has been hobbled by chains
and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race, and then say, 'You are
free to compete with all the others,' and
still justly believe that you have been completely fair. Thus it is not enough just to
open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through
those gates." Empowerment was the civil
rights vision of 1965 and, despite some
improvements, should still be our focus
today.
Why is affirmative action necessary?
Conservatives would have us believe ei-

therthat equal opportunity is a realization
or that minorities do not seize opportunity.
The fact is that African Americans earn
60 percent of what white persons earn.
The same goes for Latinos. Women earn
74 percent of what a male earns for the
same job and 97 percent of the top government and corporate jobs go to white
males.Local funding for education and the
Reagan/Bush social neglect legacy have
left us with an education, training and labor system which represents de facto discrimination and segregation against minorities.
In fact, given these grim statistics, we
should do more than simply widen the net
for the qualified. A systematic change
must occur in every area which roadblocks equality. I speak not only of race
and gender but ofrich and poor. The poor,
whether in impoverished rural or ghetto
areas or living in a family trailer park,
need empowerment so they can fully realize our nation's promise of opportunity
Affirmative action, in regard to women
and minorities, is only a first step. It is
sad to see Gov. Bush and his party crush
this first step toward the noble journey to
equality.

When Beth Tsai 'O2 first arrived at Swarthmore as a
first-year student, computer science had not occurred
to her as a possible major. On the contrary, she considered majoring in areas outside the natural sciences, including Latin and political science. Then she took an introductory computer science course in order to fulfill a
distribution requirement. Tsai enjoyed the course and
"fell in love" with computer science. During her first
year, she was hired as one of the eight student assistant
administrators who fix and maintain the college computer network. Now she plans to major in computer science and ultimately to embark on a career in that field.
"I want to continue in computer science because it's
my passion," Tsai said. "There's so much I don't know
and so much I want to learn."
But not only did Tsai find a new academic passion after she enrolled in her first computer science course,
she also discovered a department that encouraged her
as a woman in science.
"The computer science department is very supportive of women," Tsai asserted.

Supportive professors
Like Tsai, many of the female students, faculty, and
graduates of Swarthmore interviewed for this article
agreed that their experience in the natural sciences at
Swarthmore has been (or was) overwhelmingly positive.
They emphasized the ways in which the college has supported them both as students ofmath and science, and
though often indirectly—as women in what have traditionally been male-dominated fields.
The majority of he current and former students interviewed stressed hat the female mentors they encountered among the S warthmore natural sciences faculty
played a pivotal roie in their decision to pursue the natural sciences at the college level and beyond.
Biochemistry major Tamara Brenner '9B named Biology Professor Liz Vallen as a role model who instilled in
her a passion for science and helped her realize that she
wanted to have a career as a scientific researcher and
teacher. Brenner took Vallen's intermediate level cell
biology class andadvanced cell seminar, and during her

When it comes to gender balance in the sciences,
Swarthmore is ahead of the pack. The Phoenix
takes a look inside the sciences to find out what
makes Swarthmore a leader.
By Sonia Scherr Phoenix Staff

senior year did independent research in Vallen's lab.
"Liz was one of the first people to introduce me to the
excitement of science, to teach me that science is about
asking interesting questions and seeking ways to answer
them—as opposed to learning a set of facts found in a
textbook," said Brenner, who is currently in a molecular
biology Ph.D. program at the University of California,
San Francisco.
Although biology major Helen Fu 'Ol had some excellent science teachers in high school, most of them were
male. "Swarthmore is the first time I've had contact with
female professors who are very competent," explained
Fu. "[These professors] show that women can be successful in what otherwise tends to be a male environment."
Both Tinsley Davis '9B and Shirin Ali 'OO, also biology
majors, suggested that many of the female professors in
the biology department serve as role models because of
their ability to balance both the professional and personal
aspects of their lives. "There are multiple examples of
women in the biology department who are respected in
their field, revered by their students, and still make time
for their personal lives," Davis said.

Many female faculty
At Swarthmore, which has an unusually low ratio of
female to male professors in many natural science departments, female faculty are not hard to find. In computer science, for instance, two of the three tenured faculty are female. Similarly, the biology department faculty consists of five women and six men, while the math
department includes five female professors, two of whom
are tenured, among its fifteen faculty members.
Professor and chair of mathematics and statistics Janet
Talvacchia called the strong presence of women in her
department "an anomaly." Visitors to the department are
often struck by the number of women math professors
at Swarthmore, according to Talvacchia, who noted an
absence of tenured women faculty in the math departments of many other prominent institutions, including
Harvard, Yale and MIT When Talvacchia went to graduate school at a large research university, she found no

tenured women faculty members and an attitude that
the female candidates for jobs were always "lacking."
She attributed Swarthmore's unusual position among
mathematics departments to its "open[ness] to the best
candidate independent of gender issues."
The mentors of students interviewed were not limited
to women, however. Astrophysics major Amy Reighard
'Ol works with Physics Professor Michael Brown, conducting research on liquid sodium dynamos thatrelates
to why the earth and sun have magnetic fields.
As a student at a high school that specialized in science, Reighard studied astronomy during a mentorship
at a local museum and discovered that the subject fascinated her. At Swarthmore, Reighard finds that her research with Brown is shaping her future plans in science. She currently hopes to attend graduate school in
experimental astrophysics.
"I've been really lucky," asserted Reighard. "Most
women in science don't receive as much
individual
mentoring [and] positive reinforcement, ... which have
encouraged me to stick around [in science] and has made
a positive difference in how I view my future [in astrophysics.]
Several women interviewed cited encouragement from,
faculty as crucial to their decision to continue in science.
As a four year old, Beth Biller 'OO asked for a book on
astronomy. In high school, however, Biller had little interest in science in part because she did not see herself
as someone who was good at the subject. Then, as a firstyear student at Swarthmore, Biller rediscovered her love
for astronomy. Now an astrophysics major, Biller said
that encouragement from faculty members has enabled
her to persist even when she has experienced difficulty.
After Biller did poorly on a test in one of her physics
classes, the professor called her into his office.
"He said thatit was a temporary thing [and] that I could
do physics," Biller recalled. "It was important that I had
someone to help me [at that time]."
Senior engineering majors Adrienne Aiona and Laura
Brown both said that Lynne Molter 79, the only female
professor in the engineering department, has provided support for many female engineering majors. "[She] has tried

to keep a lot women involved [in engineering]," Brown said.

In the past decade, discrimination against women in
the larger world of sciences has received increased attention. A recent report compiled by a committee of
women scientists at MIT found that female faculty members at that institution earned lower salaries, received
less laboratory space, and had fewer opportunities to
serve on college committees than their male colleagues.
MIT has taken action to correct these inequities, according to a follow-up report on the Nature web site.
At Swarthmore, however, equal treatment of men and
women in the natural sciences seems to be the norm in
all departments. The six female faculty interviewed
unanimously agreed that Swarthmore was a supportive
and equitable environment in which to work.
Vollmer and chemistry professor and chair Judith Voet
said the college is particularly understanding of family
issues. Vollmer admitted that she has not always encountered a similar level of openness at other schools where
she has worked and studied. "We didn'tknow the faculty
had a life," said Vollmer, referring to one of these schools.
"There's an attitude at some institutions that marriage
and children can compromise your career."

Gender not an issue
The large majority of women students and graduates
also said that gender has not (or was not) an issue in their
work in science at the college.
"I don't feel that because I'm female the professors
expect less of me or have not given me an opportunity to
show my worth in lab or in class," Fu said.
Barbara Searle '52, a zoology major and math minor,
graduated from Swarthmore with high honors and went
on to receive a Ph.D. in biology and pharmacology at
Harvard. She worked on math and education at Stanford
and then accepted a job at the World Bank as an education specialist.
[Swarthmore] was the most gender-blind place I've
ever been, intellectually," Searle said. "I've talked to
many women friends from college and we all agreed that
we felt no difference in the way we were treated.
But as her classmate and honors chemistry major
Maxine Frank Singer stated in a 1997 alumni address that
was adapted for the March 1998 Swarthmore Bulletin,
"The invisible walls around this place shielded us from a
fact that most people knew and we were to learn: that there
was little space in theoutside world for women scientists."
Indeed, Searle said her graduate school experience was
"demeaning and demoralizing." Though she studied at
Harvard, Searle was officially considered a student at
Radcliffe. She cited the inscription on her diploma as an
example of the prevailing attitude toward women at
Harvard. "I have been told that the English translation
of my
diploma is "T have fulfilled all those requirements I would have filled had I been a student at
Harvard,'" Searle said.
A more recent graduate of the college, biology major
and women's studies concentrator ErikaKrick '9B, agreed
that her experience in the natural sciences at Swarthmore
did not differ from that of her male peers. As a secondyear veterinary student at the University of Pennsylvania, however, she has encountered a couple professors
who treat male andfemale students differently.".. .It becomes obvious when 80 percent of the class is female,"
said Krick, who noted that more women than men choose
to become veterinarians.
But Swarthmore has not been completely immune to
traditional views regarding appropriate career paths for
women. Astronomy major Nancy Grace Roman '46 recalled that when she was at the college the dean of women
strongly disapproved of female students majoring in the
natural sciences. "If she could not talk a woman out of
being a science major, she had nothing more to do with
her for the full four years," Roman said.
Nevertheless, Roman's decision to become a scientist
"was made long before college," and she did not allow
the dean's advice to change it. She attended graduate
school at the University of Chicago but did not try to
pursue an academic career because of the lack of opportunities for women astronomers to receive tenure. Roman became chief of the Astronomy and Relativity Program at NASA and continues to work part-time at NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center.

Swarthmore made me feel that
one was a person, not a gender.
This is a very powerful feeling.

Problematic classroom dynamics
Despite the lack of gender bias that has characterized
the natural sciences at the college since Searle and
Nachmias attended in the fifties, several of the current and
former students who were interviewed maintained that
even here it is not always easy to be a woman in science.
Many of their concerns focused on classroom dynamics.
Nicole Bouttenot 'Ol, a math and education double
major, said her experience in the math department has
at times been "frustrating" and "disheartening." "It's
very male oriented," said Bouttenot. "Everybody knows
what to do, and if not they make it up as they go along."
Many women students in chemistry and biology agreed
that some male students tend to act "macho" in the classroom and lab by pretending to understand concepts even
when they do not.
Although Bouttenot said her math professors were
"well-intentioned," she is not sure if they always realized that this situation was uncomfortable for her. Moreover, she sometimes found it difficult to ask questions
without feeling as if others perceived her as a failure. "I
felt that I couldn lt admit having difficulties because that
would mean I couldn't do it."
Nevertheless, Bouttenot mentioned Professor
Talvacchia as a professor who was "absolutely wonderful," in giving her confidence that she could be successful in math.
Biller said that a few male students have unintentionally dominated the discussion in some ofher classes and
seminars. She noted that many of the professors in the
physics department are aware of this situation and try
to ensure that everybody is able to participate.
Not all problems related to classroom dynamics, however. One chemistry major who asked to remain anonymous wished she had more female professors, especially
in her lower-level chemistry courses. The college has
recently hired another female chemistry professor who
will teach more introductory courses, according to biochemistry major Margaret Parker 'OO.
The anonymous student also described an incident
which involved male students in her class making jokes
about women in science. When the faculty were alerted
to the problem, they responded quickly and the jokes
stopped, according to the student.
Carol Ouellette '96, an engineering and math double major, said she also received some unwanted attention from
otherstudents because of her gender. "Maybe this was just
peculiar to my particular class at Swat," Ouellete said, "but
therewere some students ([in] engineering, not math) who
made remarks and acted in ways towards me I'd rather
they hadn't." Ouellette earned a master's degree in electrical engineering at MIT and currently works as a research
engineer for a company that designs software.

...

Fewer female majors
Although Tsai finds her professors supportive of

women, she admitted that she is "very aware ofhow few
female students are in computer science," and believes

that the lack of women computer science majors causes
her to "miss out on a sense of community."
Indeed, fewer women than men major in the natural sciences at Swarthmore, which is consistent with national
trends. According to data provided by Registrar Martin
Warner, 24 percent of Swarthmore women majored in the
natural sciences between 1994 and 1999, as opposed to 31
percent of men. Although specific departmental data were
unavailable, most faculty and students interviewed agreed
that women comprise shghtly more than 50 percent of all
biology majors and close to 50 percent of all chemistry majors. The proportion of women majors tends to be smaller in
physics, math, engineering and computer science.
Biller and Laura Pomerance 'OO, a physics and biology
doublemajor, believe that the gender gap in physics may
relate to the different ways in which men and women
handle setbacks. For instance, a male student who gets a
poor grade on test will tend to blame his performance on
external factors such as the professor or his lack of preparation, whereas a female student may conclude that she
is naturally bad at the subject. "The root of the problem
is that women are socialized to be more critical of themselves," Pomerance asserted.
Physics professor Andrea Stout said the numbers of
male and female students tend to be fairly even in intro-

ductory classes, though attrition is higher for women than
men. The department is trying to retain more women in
physics by providing informal encouragement, according to Stout.
Both Talvacchia and Molter
as well as many of the
students interviewed
partly attributed the low numbers of women in their fields to gender stereotypes that
begin prior to high school. "[The sciences] are not what
girls are told they should aspire to; they're not considered a cool thing to do," Molter said.
Indeed, a 1998 study published by the American Association of University Women revealed that girls tend to
take fewer advanced math, computer science, and physics classes than their male peers.
Talvacchia hopes to attract more women to math by
challenging those stereotypes. "Students who want to
study math should have that chance," she said. "We try
to keep the avenues of inquiry open for all students who
want to explore [math at Swarthmore]."
In computer science, Professor and chairLisa Meeden
suggested that boys tend to use computers more than
girls. The latter may consequently feel more intimidated
by computers and computer lingo when they reach college. Meeden's department has worked to increase the
number of women involved in computer science by trying to ensure that at least one of the two assistant administrators hired from each class is female. This year, in
addition to a general announcement, the department sent
out a special letter to female students encouraging them
to apply for the position, according to Meeden.
Moreover, female students themselves try to provide
support for their peers who are interested in science.
Both the Swarthmore chapter of the Society of Women
Engineers and women students in other science disciplines have big sister/little sister programs that pair
upperclass female science majors with first and second
year prospective majors.
Those women who do choose to major in science generally pursue careers in related fields, according to faculty members in the science departments. Of the 16 current Swarthmore students interviewed for this article,
14 wanted to attend graduate school in science, one
planned to find a job in industry or consulting, and one
hoped to become a high school math teacher.

Swarthmore provides confidence

The majority of the alumnae interviewed felt that their
experience at Swarthmore has strongly influenced their
subsequent work in the sciences. They emphasized that
the general knowledge they gained in their Swarthmore
science classes, rather than specific facts, has been most
helpful in their careers and lives.
Looking back on half a century in the field of astronomy, Roman said her Swarthmore education "gave
me a broad viewpoint that allowed me to cover a wide
range of specialties that proved useful, both in adapting
to the changes in my career and in handling the broad
program at NASA."
Davis, a second year student in a Ph.D program in microbiology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said
both the depth and breadth of her undergraduate biology education—which included a widerange of subjects
as well extensive research with biology professors Tim
Williams, Scott Gilbert, and Amy Vollmer—have become
"invaluable" in graduate school.
Most importantly, perhaps, many of the alumnae said
their undergraduate science education gave them the
confidence to pursue their intellectual passions. Chemistry major Dr. Frances Brokaw 76, now chief of general internal medicine at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
Center in New Hampshire, said Swarthmore taught her
that "you can do anything you want to do, if you put your
heart and mind to it."
For Vivianne Nachmias '52, an honors zoology major
who now teaches cell biology at the University of Pennsylvania, the Swarthmore experience that fostered this
attitude remains integral to her perspective as a woman
in science. "It made me feel that one was a person, not a
gender," Nachmias said. "This," she added, "is a very
powerful feeling."

I have a confession to make. The other day
I went into a comic book store and couldn't
find a thing to buy. I mean, it wasn't like there
wasn't anything worth my money, but rather
that I was just inundated by breasts and
books I'd vaguely heard of, and couldn't differentiate between what I had been told was
good and what I had been told was good by
stupid people.
So I figure for most occasional comic readers things are even more difficult. I imagine
most of you read X-Men when you were little,
maybe even avidly, and could hum the Spider-Man theme song and name three Batman
villians. Which is pretty good. Go you. But
then you go to a comic book store to relive
your youth and pick up this month's issue of
your former favorite book. Not only do you
not understand what the hell is going on, but
your staple heroes look a bit skewy. And forget about concerning yourself with who the
hot new penciler for this issue is
you're
just busy trying to understand the connections between the seemingly arbitrarily introduced new characters. Well, I have a solution.
It's called "Wizard," and Twill proceed to
sound overly gushy and give this guide to
comics one of the biggest compliments I
could give anything. In fact, I figure that the
number of people on this campus who I can
honestly say deserve similar flattery is
roughly equal to the number of satisfying
meals I've eaten in the last month. One,
maybe two.
Yes, "Wizard" doesn't take itself seriously.
I doubt I could say the same for you.
Inside "Wizard" are artist/writer interviews, price guides, plot twist detanglers,
pictures of balding fat men, and random features such as Keep Spanking Them Monkeys
Boy, the "Wizard" mascot, who was soon replaced by a man in a bunny suit. "Wizard" is
a place where an interview with Todd
MacFarlane, creator of "Spawn" and owner
of some $3.5 million balls, is just as newsworthy as the results of a staff sushi eating
competition.
"Wizard" is such an absolute authority on
comic books, but at the same time laughs at
itself constantly; it is the quintessential respected authority that looks good, reads well,
knows a damn lot, but at the same time is not
really respected. I often find myself laughing at the sheer absurdity and immaturity of
this magazine that nonetheless can commission cover art by the top artists in the field
and wrangle interviews with notoriously misanthropic writers.
"Wizard's" 100th issue came out recently,
and included in the nice plastic wrapper was
a poster of all the covers of the past (poorly
designed, but that's a spiel foranother time).
I realized, by squinting at the teeny thumbnail images, that I have been reading "Wizard" since issue 33. Nothing in my life is that
consistent. Nothing. This magazine has been
with me from cheerleader to punk rock to
wherever I am now. I could damn near landmark the terrain of my life these last four
years by looking at old covers.

nose piercing incident. Women of the X-Men
crashing the car into the side of the garage. And yes, even this far back, Alex Ross

visiting Teatr "Provisorium'VKompania "Teatr" is here to perform their current production, "Ferdydurke," an adaptation
of the novel by Witold Gombrowicz. They arrived last Friday
and will be at Swarthmore through the weekend to kick off
their first North American tour.
An interview with the group, with translation by theater
department chair Allen Kuharski, revealed their history, artistic vision and method. This session, combined with a video
screening of "Ferdydurke" in its original Polish version, served
to prove that both the company and the performance are unlike any theater seen before.
Upon first meeting, the company seemed a stoic group,
mostly reserved and very serious. A few were more disposed
to talking about the group's work, particularly the directors,
Janusz Oprynski and Witek Mazurkiewicz. These two fielded
questions contemplatively and responded with decisive passion.
As with all ensemble work, the qualities that the members
bring to the work vary from one member to the next. The Teatr
"Provisorium'VKompania "Teatr" cooperative is a union of two
very distinct companies; this divide accounts for much of the
variation that is manifest in the ensemble's work. The union
occurred in 1996, and though the members maintain that they
are now a single company, both their names and their work
reflect the fact that they were once separate companies.

Foundations in alternative theater

The older of the two companies, the Teatr "Provisorium,"
was founded in 1975 during the student alternative theater
movement in Lublin, Poland. The students who created experimental theater during this movement did not go to competitive, state-run drama schools, where actors traditionally
get their training in Poland. Instead, these students were graduates of universities, with no training in theater, and they produced shows on budgets made possible by university grants.
After years ofperseverance and some successful shows, critics began to legitimize the alternative theater.
The Teatr "Provisorium" was one major player in this success. The artistic goals of the Teatr "Provisorium" were both
political and philosophical. Oprynski spoke reverentially about
the company's vision. It intended to challenge authority and
the prevailing social order of Poland in the 70s.
The company members

mental, collaborative enm,semble process. Thus, the
Teatr "Provisorium" never worked with pre-written scripts;
the productions were always based on some text, but were
created by the ensemble through improvisation and experimentation.
When martial law was declared in Poland in 1981,the Teatr
"Provisorium" had seven members. Within the year, five of
those members were arrested and imprisoned by the martial
law regime for various charges of agitation and subversion.
Throughout the rest of the 'Bos and early '9os, even as members were released from prison, the Teatr "Provisorium" lost
most of its company for political and personal reasons. By
1996, only two members, director Oprynski and actor Jacek
Brzezinski remained. The Teatr "Provisorium" was essentially
paralyzed.
The other half of thepresent-day company consists of three
professionally trained actors, Mazurkiewucz, Jarek Tomica
and Michal Zgiet. These men, unlike the Teatr "Provisorium"
members, took the traditional route to becoming actors in
Polish theater. They received four years of strict, Stanislavskibased theatrical training at a state-run drama school in Lublin.
After graduation, thethree actors participated in professional
theater for 10 years.

process of developing productions. He wanted to work on a
level playing field with directors and other actors. These desires were not fulfilled in the Polish professional theater.
All three actors quit their professional jobs in the early '9os
and began looking for work in the alternative theater. Though
they were struggling to make a living, they firmly decided to
have nothing to do with the professional theater ever again. In
1995 the actors came together to form the Kompania "Teatr"
and put together a couple of quirky, well-received productions.
A year later the Kompania "Teatr" encountered the "Teatr"
Pro visorium.

A marriage of both companies

Though the two companies have been working together now
for over three years, Oprynski insisted that only "Ferdydurke"
successfully marries the theatrical styles of Teatr
"Provisorium" and Kompania "Teatr." The show was developed
over a total of ten months. The company did not even approach
a stage for the first six months of the process. Instead, these
months were spent in table meetings, mulling over the text and
making sure that they all understood every element ofits meaning, which is unusual for a theater company.
The script that the company brought to the stage at the end
of six months remained almost entirely unchanged through the
rehearsal period. For four months, the company searched for
the primary impulse to carry out the text's message. The first
breakthrough was the use of space. The company pared the
stage down to a box, approximately eight by eight feet square,
in which all of the action would occur. This confinement,
Oprynski explained, transformed the literary meaning of text
into theatrical representation.
The second breakthrough that the company believes their
work demonstrates is in the acting style. Here, the political
and philosophical vision of the Teatr "Provisorium" is expressed
through the tight, proficient use of the trained actors' bodies.
The company believes that this precise, body-based style of
acting, used to address the text's fundamental philosophical
questions, has broken barriers emotionally in the realm of acting.
The result of the company's intensivecollaborationis a spare,
essential production that concentrates explosive energy into
an airtight display of precision. While most performances tend
to mostly wander through valleys of action and climax at one
or two peak moments, "Ferdydurke" spends most of its time in
full power and instead is marked by the few intentional lulls.
While the profundity of the text may not be immediately accessible the first time around, the performance itself rivets
the bewildered spectator.
What does it mean, "Ferdydurke?" That was the last question on my mind as I wrapped up my interview with the company. Excited at last, they all began talking at once. They had
been waiting for me to ask. "Ha, ha, ha, ha, nothing!" The word
means nothing. It is a nonsensical, dadaistic provocation that
has tied critics up in knots trying to decipher its meaning.
Kuharski suggested, "If I had to translate the title, I would call
it 'Fiddle-Faddle," or 'Higgelty-Piggelty.'"

the frat and my off campus friends all had a good time,
but most people arrived at the front door, saw the movie
screen, had a puzzled expression for a few seconds, said,
"huh
films?" and rapidly proceeded to the basement
where the keg was, never to return. So I guess I have an
image of typical college audiences not being audiences
at all! But I know there are exceptions. And I've seen
some great concerts at Swarthmore over the years, including the recent, packed show with Magnetic Fields,
so I know it's a campus with pretty good taste.
SW: Ifyou weren't bringing cinema to the masses, what
would you be doing?
JS: Well, they are pretty small "masses" so far. I don't
know what else I would be doing without this, but I already "do" other things. Secret Cinema is somewhere
between a hobby and a job. It's close to a job because of
the enormous amount of time it takes up. The reason it's
gone as far as it has is because I've been willing to do
everything needed to "grow a business," to use current
jargon, without the business being profitable. That's probably why I have no competition. Most of the money I
earn from it goes right back into it, and if I had to pay
myself a salary it would have gone bankrupt years ago.
SW: Tell me a bit about your obsessive collecting.
JS: Like what? I collect films, books, magazines,
records, videos, posters and almost anything. At least, I
have a lot of all these things. I'm not sure what defines a
collector, let alone an obsessive one. They're just all
things I find interesting. I guess I'm a pack rat. But everything I collect, I know people who have more of them.
SW: How do you feel about fame?
JS: I'll tell you if and when I ever become famous. Actually, after eight years of doing this, I am just reaching
the point that some people who are not my regular audience have heard of me. But even still, these are Center
City people who regularly read the alternative weeklies,

don't live in Center City, and my neighbors have no idea
what I do or why I am always carrying equipment up
and down the stairs. Channel 29 News did a brief story
on Secret Cinema last year, and I thought, "well, now the
neighbors will be on to me." It turns out that... virtually
nobody told me they saw it. So I'm still pretty anonymous, which is mostly good. I'm now just famous enough,
or Secret Cinema is, that I have no shortage of places
where I can show films, which was not always the case.

admit that even I, a fairly diehard sailor,
didn't tune in to watch the big event—I
don't especially enjoy staying up until 3
a.m. to watch a really, really long, boring
race on ESPN2 any more than you.
So, what's the big deal? Well, for one
thing, we put a hell of a lot of effort into
winning the Cup back. Yes, back. We first
relinquished it in 'B3, but Dennis Connor
triumphed over Australia in 'B7 to bring
the Cup home. If you want a romanticized

partially filmed in my hometown. So along
comes 1995, and Dennis Conner, our savior in 'B7, loses the Cup to New Zealand,

to the present disaster: the failure of the
U.S. to even qualify for the Cup.
This year there were 11 challengers,
with five from the U.S. We obviously
wanted to regain our title, as we had five
times as many boats working for the win.

The United States has a history of be-

to win every gold medal at the Olympics,

or win the World Cup or World Championships? Though we seldom meet every
one of our expectations, we still have a
definite superiority complex when it
comes to both amateur and professional
sports. Granted, we do win more contests
than, say, Bolivia, but we are not the be all

Guess what? This time, we really lost.
We didn't even make the finals, which are
still going on as I write. Considering that

Last weekend, it seemed like virtually
every athletic team on campus was trying desperately to subdue Haverford. One
more attempt will be made this coming
weekend when the track and field team
closes its indoor season at the Centennial
Conference championships at Haverford.
Unfortunately for the men, the odds are
stacked highly in favor of the Fords, who
have about five times as many runners.
Still, individual victories could occur in
numerous events.
In the sprints, Kerwin Valcin 'OO, Matt
Steele 'O3 and Abram Lipman 'O3 will
sprint the 55-meter dash, and Kwaku
Ntoso 'O3 will jump the 55 hurdles. Valcin,
Steele and Ariss Derhovanessian 'OO will
give their all in the 200. Finally, Keith
Gilmore 'Ol, Ntoso and Derhovanessian
will attack the competition in the 400.
Gilmore and Jeff Doyon 'OO will also perform in the 800-meter run, the men's distance medley relay (with Derhovanessian
and Marc Jeuland '01) and the 4x400 relay (with Ntoso and Derhovanessian).
Jeuland will try to outlast the other masochistic individuals in the grueling 5000.
Doug Kneeland 'O2 and Matt Rapoza 'O3
will heave the shot, and Steve Dawson 'OO
will try to defend his numerous conference championships in the high jump de-

lenger races. But even the Hawaiian syndicate, Abracadabra, the least successful
American boat, had $lO million to spend.
Yes, that's 10 million dollars.
Of the otherAmerican syndicates, Young
America (based in S. Portland, Maine) had
$4O million, America One (San Francisco)
had $32 million, America True (San Francisco) had $2l million and Team Dennis
Conner (San Diego) had $l2-15 million.
Together, the U.S. syndicates spent around
$ll5 million. And we didn't win the Cup.
We didn't even win the challenger cup.
The Italian syndicate, Prada, which has
been named the challenger—which means
that they will race against the current
Cup-holder (New Zealand) —had a budget
of $5O million. What did the Italians do to
overcome the sheer quantity of opposition
from the U.S.? Two things: first, one syndicate had the whole country's effort behind them, unlike the five separate U.S.
teams. Second, they have a different attitude. They were the underdogs. If they
lost, no big deal. They didn't have 145
years of history on their backs. Yes, it

would be nice to win, they must have
thought, but if they don't, they will know
they fought the good fight. When Prada
eliminated the last American syndicate,
the U.S. sailing world was left in shock.
The ultimate travesty—an America's Cup
without the Americans!
The modernAmerica's Cup has been, up
until now, more of a contest among Americans: whichAmerican syndicate could triumph over all the other American syndicates? The challengers were almost irrelevant. But the defeat of the Americans
seems to have refocused the Cup back to
its roots. Is this the end of U.S. domination in this particular realm of sports?
Who knows?
One thing is for sure: sailors the world
over can now expect the America's Cup
to be a fairer, more international contest.
I know that all those who follow the sailing scene will be watching the remaining
races between Prada and Team New
Zealand closely (as of Tuesday, Team New
Zealand was up 2-0 in the best-of-nine series). But the American layperson's opinion? I can't believe we lost!

A step in the
right direction
I know most of you were at last
Saturday's basketball double-header
against Haverford, but lest the significance
of the evening escape you, let me recount
the night's events. For the first time in my
two years here, a Swarthmore athletic contest actually felt like a legitimate sporting
event.

During the second game, people were
standing by the entrance to watch the
game, not because they wanted to, but because they had to; the bleachers were
packed full of rabid fans from both teams.
The last time I saw so many Swatties together, Bob Gross was assuring me that "no
matter what you say or do to me, I am still
a worthwhile person."
It was so crowded that the space behind
the Swarthmore bench, which is usually
void of anything but a water cooler and ball
bin, was filled with folding chairs for the
extra fans. Painted chests, homemadesigns
and jeers of "safety school" and "rec specs"
filled Tarble Pavilion. From my courtside
seat behind the scorer's table, I could feel
the floor quake with every cheer, I could
see the passion in
the eyes of each

game drew to an
end (three times),
the intensity grew on both sides. I could
see the gritting teeth and the clenched fists
of the nervous fans on the Swarthmore
side. I was treatedto curses at players and
referees from the equally tense Haverford
side. The game, which lasted upwards of 2
1/2 hours, took just as much out of the fans
as it did the players. When the final buzzer
sounded, a feeling ofexhaustion swept over
the Swarthmore crowd. I felt like I had
been socked in the gut. I could tell by the
looks on the other fans' faces that they felt
the same.
Despite the outcome of the game, I was
proud of everyone that was in Tarble Pavilion that night. There was a sense of community, a sense of pride in our school, in
our teams and in our athletes. I know that
sounds corny, but pride is something that
seems to be lacking from our sports program. My only question is, why did we have
to wait until the last game of the basketball season to show our support to the team?
Granted, it was senior/alumni night against
our archrivals, but that shouldn't make it
the only game fans attend. I would love to
see Saturday night's crowd attend every
home game and an even bigger showing
for the rivalry game.
Even though Saturday's match-up had no
bearing on the non-existent post season for
either team, the game meant something. It
meant something because the entire student body was taking part. Every game
should carry some sort of significance and
meaning, not just a season finale.

Women make splash at conferences
By Becca Howes-Mischel
Phoenix Staff
The Centennial Conference's best swimmers fought it out in
the water during three long days of competition hosted by Franklin
and MarshallCollege last weekend. Seventeen Swat women competed in 13 events against swimmers from the eight other schools
in the conference.
Only those who returned to the evening finals by placing in the
top 16 during trials scored points. After Sunday night, the final
scores revealed Swarthmore as the second place finisher for the
seventh year in a row. However, this year's score was the closest
the team has ever come to the first place score. Gettysburg won
the conference championship for the seventh year with 697 points
to Swat's 628. F&M came in third with 501. Over the course of the
three day meet, Swarthmore women set four college records, two
conference records, made eight national consideration standards
and set 15 personal records. In addition, almost every swimmer
swam a season best time.
Coach Sue Davis commented, "While it wasn't the meet that
each individual dreamed of for herself and [her] personal successes, it was a meet where the collective efforts of everyone
brought us within 57 points of the perennial conference champions. Whereas, in the past, perfect meets. . have not gotten us
closer than 200 points to Gettysburg. I'm extremely proud of the
accomplishments of everyone at the Conference meet and
throughout the dual meet season. We look forward to national
championships in two weeks for those individuals that will be
selected."
Friday's events were the 200 free relay, 500 free, 200 IM, 50
free and 400 medley relay. Three women made it to finals in the
500 free, including Mari McCrann 'OO who did it with a personal
best time. In the 200 IM Swarthmore had three swimmers in the
top eight, all with season bests. ClaireArbour 'OO, Natalie Briones
'O3 and Laura Fox 'O3 all had personal bests in the 50 free as they
represented Swarthmore in the finals. Arbour also set the college record in that event.
The last event of the evening was the 400 medley relay ofBecca
Howes-Mischel 'Ol, Alice Bonarou 'O2, Briones and Arbour who
came in first with the college record, conference record, and
qualified for national consideration.
Saturday is known as "100 day" because the events are the 200
medley relay, 400 IM (requiring a 100 of every stroke), 100 but.

Wrestling finishes last
at championships
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
At the Centennial Conference championships last
Saturday, Dan Jacobs 'O3 was the loneplacewinner, finishing third overall in the 125-pound weight class. Several other wrestlers made noble efforts but fell short
of their goals. The Garnet ended up scoring just 12 team
points, whichearned them last place in the tournament
standings.
Jacobs defeated Johns Hopkins senior Alok Moharir
by an impressive 14-3 score in the consolation finals to
claim third place. In doing so, he avenged an 8-7 loss
earlier in the season that was marred by questionable
officiating. Jacobs finished the year with a solid 13-6
record.
Senior captain Jesse Bean earned a technical fall in
his first match at 174 pounds. Bean displayed nearly
perfect technique in that match.
Hobbled by nagging injuries, Ted Chan 'O2 dropped
a disappointing double overtime match to two-time defending champion Scott Taylor from Western Maryland.
His weight class, 165pounds, was won by Jose Gonzalez
from Johns Hopkins, whom Chan had defeated 13-5
earlier in the season.
Les Fox and Sam Picard also participated in the
tournament. On a team where injuries and discouragement were so frequent, simply making it to the
end of the season can be regarded as a kind of moral
victory.
However, things are expected to change next year.
Chan and Jacobs will return, as will Keith McManimen
'O2 and Justin Paglei 'O2. All four have the ability to
contend for a conference title and to qualify for nationals next season. Swarthmore will have a strong
nucleus with these four, in addition to other potential
returnees and a potentially strong incoming freshman
class.
"Things will be very, very different next year," predicted head coach Ron Tirpak.

terfly, 200 free, 100 breast, 100 back and 800 free relay. Five
women qualified for finals in the 400 IM, including Denise
Finley 'O3 who swam a personal best. The race was won overall by Bonarou, who also qualified for national consideration.
Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO was Swat's sole representative to finals in the 100 fly. She qualified with a personal best time.
Four women made it to finals in the 200 free, with one of these
being Howes-Mischel, who broke her own personal record.
Two women swam in the finals of the 100 breast: Briones
and Fox, both of whom obtained personal bests. Briones swam
a national qualifying time as she placed first. Three women
scored points in 100 back.
The relays were not to be upstaged by the individual events
as both teams made national consideration standards. The 800
relay of Briones, Auerbach, Burkhead-Weiner and Arbour also
set the college record and conference record with their first
place finish.
By the last day of championships, the swimmers were tired
but they held together for the mile, 200 back, 100 free, 200
breast, 200 fly and 400 free relay. McCrann and Emily Marks
'O3 both set personal bests in their long mile swims. Four women
represented Swat in the 200 back as Parmelee and Rosenthal
set personal bests.
The 100 free was an exciting race with two women in the
finals as Arbour, Burkhead-Weiner and Almberg all swam personal bests. Two women swam for Swat in the 200 breast as
Briones pulled off both a personal best and national qualifying time. In the last individual event of the meet, the 200 fly,
four women represented Swarthmore and Bonarou qualified
for national consideration. Then, as the teams lined the pool
to cheer for the last event, the 400 free relay of Briones,
Auerbach, Burkhead-Weiner and Arbour broke the college
record.
Every swimmer put all her energy and talent on the line,
because they knew that even though most competed individually, they were swimming for the victory of a larger team. Everyone came home hoarse from screaming her lungs out to
encourage her teammates. While many swimmers are happy
to have free time after a five-month season, many will feel a
bit of nostalgia for the camaraderie and adrenaline they felt
last weekend. The swimmers who made national consideration
must now wait until Friday to find out whether they made it
into the meet.

Kile named Player of the Year
First women's b-ballplayer to top Centennial
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

HeatherKile 'O2 has been named
the women's basketball Centennial
Conference Player of the Year for
the 1999-2000 season. The hardworking forward led the women's
basketball team to their first-ever
Centennial Conference playoff
berth.
Kile, a 5'10" sophomore from
Holy Cross in Marlton, N.J., led the
conference in scoring and rebounding this season, averaging 18.9
points per game and 13.8rebounds
per game. She shot 52.5 percent
from the floor and posted 2.21
steals per game, 10th in the conference. Known for being a power
player with a sweet touch inside fifteen feet, Kile also piled up points

Kile led the conference in
scoring and rebounding this
season, averaging 18.9 points
per game and 13.8 rebounds
pounding the offensive glass.
While Kile contributed steadily
throughout the year, there were
stretches where she was simply
spectacular. In one three-game
stretch against Farleigh-Dickinson,
Apprentice and Ursinius, Kile averaged a remarkable 33.5 ppg and 20
rpg. Last night she scored 22 points
and managed 11 rebounds against
Johns Hopkins. Perhaps the most important thing Kile showed this season was her ability on any given
night to adjust her game to give her

Conference

team thebest chance of winning. On
some nights, Kile had to be the fo-

cus of the offense. On others, she
would recede into the background,
distribute the ball and crash the
boards. Kile could always be
counted on to shut down her opponent defensively using a combination of intensity and athleticism.
The award was voted on by a
panel of ten Centennial Conference
head coaches. She is the first
Swarthmore women's basketball
player ever and only the second
sophomore to recieve this prestigious award. Kile was Centennial
Conference First Team as a freshman last year. Those who are familiar with Kile's intense work ethic
have to believe that she will have
two more in her back pocket before
all is said and done.

the second place team of the Western Division in the semi-finals. Also, because of
the humiliation suffered at the hands of
the Mules in their earlier game this season, the Garnet Tide was set to seek second-round revenge. With unrelenting defense, Swarthmore led at the half 22-16.
Again, poor free throw shooting (42 percent) and a poor field goal percentage (35
percent) cost Swarthmore the game down
the line. The women did, however, prove
that they can play with any team in the
conference and fell by only a slight margin, 46-43. Heather Marandola 'Ol
achieved a game high 12 points. Allison
Furman 'O3 contributed a standout performance with several key baskets in the second half of the barn-burner. She ended the
night with 9 points (3-6 treys).
A teary-eyed farewell opened the
Haverford game on Saturday evening as
the coaching staff, teammates and fans
honored the two senior members of the

squad, Kira Cochran-Bond and Thalia
Mills. As the opening buzzer sounded,
however, Swat was ready to attack, and
did so, winning 57-44.
Heather Kile's achievements were nothing short of spectacular. She amassed 19
points and 15 boards. Marandola chipped
in 9 points and managed to shut down the
Fords' go-to offensive player to limit her
to only 9 points. Furman, Kristen English
'Ol, Sarah Tufano 'O3, and Emily Gray 'O2
all contributed key plays on the offensive
and defensive end to seal the victory.
Last night the Garnet lost in Baltimore,
64-49, to Johns Hopkins in the first playoff game ever for the Swarthmore

women.
Kile led the scoring with 22 points.
Marandola scored 4, English got 5,
Furman managed 9 and Tufano scored 8.
Johns Hopkins will play the winner of
the Muhlenberg-Franklin & Marshall
game on Saturday evening for the Centennial Conference Championship and an
NCAA tournament bid.

left in the game, the Fords got the ball
back, and Matt Duffy made two free

throws to take a 78-76 lead with 2:18 remaining.
After several defensive stands by both
teams, Haverford scored to extend its lead
to 4 with 1:10 left. As time vanished, and
after two misses by Swarthmore, guard
David Pearce 'O3 nailed a three-pointer
with 25 seconds remaining. The clock
worked its way down to 9 seconds left
before Pearce and Brubaker forced a
jumpball, giving the ball back to
Swarthmore. On the inbounds play, Culley
blew by his defender and attacked the
basket with what might have been the
game winning layup, but Haverford's interior defense was too thick and too tall,
and Culley's shot curled off the rim as the
final horn sounded.
Culley finished the game with 12 points
and 17 key rebounds, of which 15 prevented second chance possessions for
Haverford. Holtmeier would finish with
8 rebounds and 4 three-pointers. Three of
Holtmeier's baskets came one after another, the final one capping a 23-6 run

which spanned most of the first half.
Sorely missed in both overtimes was the
presence of the Garnet's only center,
David Gammill 'O2, who dominated the
Fords on offense with 18 points, including
a key three-pointer to put Swarthmore up
61-58 with 1:56 left in regulation.
Both Culley and Holtmeier and their
families received a warm ovation in front
of a crowd of almost 1400 spectators before the game started. Coach Lee
Wimberly opened the night by publicly
thanking Joe and Gregg for their four
years ofhard work. "Neverfor one minute
did they not give their most," said
Wimberly at center court. Holtmeier and
Culley began their careers at Swarthmore
by advancing to the Centennial Conference championship game. While Culley's
four years as a member of the Garnet Tide
have been plagued by knee problems, he
completed his final season as the team's
rebounding leader, finishing fourth in the
conference and leading the team as a
steady anchor on an extremely young
team. Holtmeier paced the team in three
statistical categories in which he was
among the league leaders: steals, assists,
and three-point field goal percentage.
