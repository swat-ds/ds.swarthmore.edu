The Board of Managers .will decide whether construction on
the new dorm, depicted above, will proceed on schedule.

Funding problems
may delay new
dorm, renovations
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
Because no one has yet made a donation specifically dedicated to funding a new college dormitory, the Board of
Managers is considering a delay in construction plans for
that building. The plans to renovate Parrish Hall would
then be pushed back to coincide with the completion of the

new dormitory.

The decision, which the board will make during its meeting in September, would most likely result in a delay of a
few months to a year.
"The general consensus is that the projects need to wait
until a substantial amount of money comes in," Vice
President for Facilities and Services Larry Schall '75 said. "I
wouldn't be surprised if the board asked us to wait until the
money started flowing in."
Both the new dormitory and the Parrish renovations are
being funded through the current capital campaign, called
"The Meaning of Swarthmore." According to John Malcolm,
director of development, the campaign is on target. The
problem with going forward with construction on the two
sites stems from a lack of "lead donations," or large grants
specifically designated for one of the upcoming projects.
According Malcolm, the lack of lead donors does not
reflect the overall state of the capital campaign. The college
has raised $lO9 million out of a total target of $230 million.
"We're just ahead of where we want to be," Malcolm said.
"We need to be very attentive to working in a forward and

thoughtful way."

Despite the success of the fundraising, no single donor
has yet offered to assume the financing of the new dormitory with a lead donation. Without this money, the college will
not be able to begin construction.
"No one has come forward and said they wanted to give
money for Parrish and the new dorm," Assistant Dean and
Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal said. "You can't
do things like this without money."
All involved say that the board will likely put off construction plans for an undetermined length of time. "I
couldn't imagine a delay lasting more than a year, but it
could be fluid," Vice President for College and Community
Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "If something
bountiful happens, we might be able to cut our waiting time
in half."
Westphal said a delay would not affect the quality of

either new dorm construction or renovation of Parrish, nor
would it change what is already planned for the projects. All
construction and renovation would follow the same schedule
in the event of a delay, but would simply be set back by a few
Months. "The delay is more timing than content," she said.
"It might be postponed, but that won't change what we do."

THE PHOENIX

The policy allows victims to choose whether they
want to press charges against their assailants and
respects a victim's decision if he or she decides not to go
to the police.

Criticism first came from Swarthmore Police Chief
Brian Craig, whose concerns stem from the physical evidence police lost during the two months between the
alleged rape and when the victim reported it.
Craig told the Delaware County Daily Times in an
April 19 article that his concern was "losing details and
evidence," and that his department did not have the used
condom the victim allegedly found in her bed the morning following the incident. Though he told The Phoenix
there was probably enough additional evidence to convict Ramsayer, he said not having the condom "is certainly going to make it more difficult.

adversarial system. For some women, it's empowering to
enter that system and confront their assailant, but for
some it's terrifying to relive their experience."

Procedures for when it happens
Worth nurses have strict guidelines for when a student comes to them and reports that they have been
raped or sexually assaulted. The health center's policy
states that the care given must be "in accordance with
victim's wishes without charge and regardless of
whether [the] victim reports to police or Public Safety."
They are, however, instructed to call Public Safety immediately if the student reports that the assailant was
unknown to the victim, "to increase the chance of apprehending the attacker."
Other instructions to the nurse on duty are to remain
calm, focus on the victim's needs, give him or her control, and convey unconditional acceptance, making it
clear that the nurse believes the assault happened and
that the assailant is at fault.
Additionally, nurses receive special instructions if the
assault occurred within the past 72 hours. Among these
is to "Refrain from disturbing any potential

"The more time that elapses from the time the event
occurs to the time you start your investigation makes the
case more difficult," Craig said. "I don't know anybody
who would contradict that point of view. People's memories deteriorate; physical evidence is lost."

Evidence issues, according to Dean of the College Bob
Gross '62, are rarely pertinent to the college, "because it's
not a question of how, or whether, but if there was consent," he said.
The Daily Times followed Craig's comments with an
editorial April 22, calling the college's policy "bizarre"
and "criminal," implying that its actual intent might be
to hide sexual assault that occurs on campus so that students' parents wouldn't question their children's safety
while at Swarthmore.

Empowerment and options

See POLICY,

pg. 15

Naval officer

student's rape

Karen Henry, dean of gender education, refuted that
view, saying she'd much rather give victims options so
they can make their own choice.
"I think the police are our friends," she said. "But I
think that, for survivors, going to the police is a difficult
issue." In general, she said, people can have trouble
telling their story to more than one person.
"Her approach is to empower the victim," Gross said
of Henry, who handles all sexual assault and rape cases
at the college. "Rape is an experience that leaves the victim powerless

He was released after posting 10 percent of $25,000
bail. A preliminary hearing is set for May 13.
Ramysayer's arrest followed a police investigation
initiated by the victim coming forward to police Jan.
24, nearly two months after the rape took place.
College policy states that sexual assault and rape victims are given the option of whether they want to
report incidents to police, and if they choose to report

Henry added that, in all cases, as with the Dec. 3 incident, she encourages victims to report the incident to the
police.
Gross agreed, since those who come forward to report
an incident aren't obliged to press charges later. "[The
victim] doesn't have to follow it through completely," he

said.
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie also supported the
policy. "Our normal practice is to encourage a person to
report it
but we would never force it," he said.
or any
Pennsylvania law, in fact, prohibits the college
institution
from bringing rape charges to the police
without a victim's consent.
"Normally the victim is feeling hurt, traumatized and
confused, and it just takes time for them to sort out how
they want to handle this particular incident," Goundie
said. Allowing this time produces lapses, like the
52 days separating the Dec. 3 incident and when it was

reported.
Craig emphasized that his comments to the Daily
Times and his desire for victims to always report their
experiences right away are based on his instincts as a
law enforcer. Goundie even admitted that, "in [Craig's]
shoes, I would want the same thing."
Gross also agreed with Craig but felt that the victim
"has to be aware of the system she is getting into. It is an

The 20-year-old naval officer was on campus as the

After a night of dancing and drinking, during
which the victim consumed a "significant amount of

helped her back to her room. Later that night, she discovered Ramsayer standing pantless next to her bed,
making sexual advances.
After various attempts to refuse and resist, the victim lost consciousness.

College won't host
award ceremony
for Palestinian poet
BY BRENDAN KARCH
bkarchl@swarthmore.edu

Acclaimed Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish will read
from his poetry this Sunday as part of a presentation of
Arab literature and music.
Internationally known Lebanese singer Marcel Khalife,
who uses Darwish's poetry in his lyrics, will open the event
with an hour-long performance. Darwish will take the stage
after an introduction by Columbia University professor
Edward Said, literature scholar and expert on Middle East
politics. Darwish will read his poetry in its original Arabic,
while on-stage translators will present the work in English.
Darwish has been widely recognized as Palestine's
national poet. He has been called a "savior of the Arab language," and is known for his complex portrayals of political
and cultural life in the Middle East.
As a young child Darwish and his family were forced to
flee their home village during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. He

was been jailed multiple times in the 1960s for reading his
poetry in Israel.
From the 1970s until his resignation in 1993, Darwish

Spec weekend alcohol policy may change

ssiasl@swarthmore.edu
Public Safety stopped two parties

this weekend, one because it did not
have a party permit and another
because it was in a dorm, which is not
allowed during admitted students
weekend.
Prospective students on campus
during the weekend were among
those attending the parties. The fact
that "specs" could have been at these
other parties and may have consumed alcohol raises questions for
the deans about the college's policy
on specs and drinking.
Associate Dean for Student Life
Tedd Goundie sends out an e-mail
every year telling all students to keep
specs from drinking during spec

weekend. Admissions also reserves
the right to revoke its offer of admission of specs caught drinking during
admitted student weekend.
"We're obviously concerned that
these are high school students.
They're not Swarthmore students,"
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62
said.
"Liability
is always there,"
Goundie said. "We do have a certain
obligation to them and to their parents."
The deans are aware of at least two
specs who drank in past years. One of
these was on spec weekend, and the
student eventually enrolled at the college "after talking with admissions
and the student's parents," Gross
said.
It was this incident, in 1999, that

prompted the development of the

cur-

rent policy. The 2000 admitted students weekend was dry, "but it just
made for a very artificial environment," Goundie said. "Specs were

wondering 'Why aren't there parties
going on?'
"

This year's weekend was similar

to last year's in format, although "we
always go back and revisit the policy," Goundie said.
Though there is a chance that policy will change for next year, the ability of the administration to keep
specs from drinking relies on the students, Goundie said. "What we really
need is for the students here to buy
into what we're trying to accomplish."

Gross maintained that specs and
alcohol are "a bad mixture."

Phi Psi first-years face hearing in May

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

The six Phi Psi first-years arrested at the end of
last semester during a fraternity-sponsored scavenger
hunt on the Haverford campus face a preliminary
hearing May 9 at 9 a.m.
Charges against first-years Timothy Chryssikos,
Paul Chung, Keith Hernandez, Brendan J. Moriarty,
Terence Rooney and Troy Smith include burglary, criminal trespassing, institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, theft by unlawful taking, criminal conspiracy,
disorderly conduct and loitering and prowling at night.
Moriarty faces a drug possession charge for a small
amount of marijuana police found in his pocket the
night of the hunt.

served as a top official in the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (P.L.0.). He resigned from the P.L.O. executive

The hearing has been pushed back several times
from its original date of March 14. Sergeant Jack
Walsh, of the Haverford Township Police Department,
said the delays were unusual but that the likelihood
that charges would be dropped is low. "Our policy is
to prosecute our arrests," he said.
Items the six stole include a Haverford alumni soccer ball and basketball, pictures from the college's
wall of fame, a sculpture and two paintings, a fire
extinguisher, a wallet, six videotapes and an athletic
trophy. To obtain the trophy, Chung and
Chryssikos allegedly smashed a glass case in the

escalation in violence.
Although Darwish often finds harsh words for Israel, he
has also upset the Palestinian government with his usually
acerbic assessment of both sides' behavior in the longstanding Middle East conflict.
Darwish is virtually unknown in the United States,
where only a few of his more than 25 collections of poetry
have been translated.
It was only last November that Darwish first gained
widespread recognition when he was awarded the Lannan
Foundation's third annual Prize for Cultural Freedom. He
will receive $350,000 from the foundation, which is also
funding a new book of translated poetry to be published this
Fall. The foundation will present Darwish with the award
Sunday in Philadelphia.

The college had planned to host the Lannan
Foundation's award presentation to Darwish this Sunday,
but the administrationdecided it would bebetter to hold the
event in Philadelphia. According to vice president for college and community relations Maurice Eldridge '6l, the
administration did not want to give the appearance that
Swarthmore was giving the award. He said the college was
afraid that hosting the event on campus would blur the line
between the college and the Lannan Foundation.
"If it looked like the college was awarding $350,000 to
some poet... and the idea had never been vetted on campus,
that would not have been a good thing," Eldridge said.
He added that the decision to relocate the ceremony was
not influencedby Darwish's political views nor by any pressure from campus groups.
Jewish religious adviser Rachel Kobrin expressed concern that this event, as part of an ongoing college effort to
promote Islamic studies, is only presenting one side of the
debate over Middle East political issues. Kobrin is working
with Im Titzu, the Zionist group on campus, to bring speakers with "alternative viewpoints" to campus before the end
of the semester.
"Clearly one event is not going to give all sides of a complex story," Kobrin said. "But with events like this I always
hope for the possibility that multiple voices can be heard."
The concert and reading begins at 4 p.m. Sunday in the
Lang Performing Arts Center. The show is sold out, but a
live Webcast will be available through the Lannan
Foundation's Web site at www.lannan.org.

Student Advisory Group to CRC resigns

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Wemeal@swarthmore.edu
Following a long effort to gain student representation
on a committee that has repeatedly said no, all five members of the Student Advisory Group (SAG) to the

Compensation Review Committee have resigned (see letter, pg. 8).
"We have been absolutely frustrated with trying to
make change," SAG member Mariah Montgomery 'O4 said.
But Melanie Young, Human Resources director and
CRC member, said the students "had a view of their role

which was different from
the role we invited them to

play."

The CRC comprises 11
staff members. Five adjunct
advisory groups
the president's staff, two staff governance committees, a faculty

The current members of the CRC are "already in a position to hear from staff," according to LaMar.
Despite resigning SAG members' involvement with the
living wage campaign, Montgomery said the group's effort
to gain a student seat on the committee did not mean they
intended to use this spot to represent low-wage staff.
"We're not questioning the members' ability to represent
their own concerns," she said. "We do question the CRC's
ability to represent campus-wide concerns." Still, SAG did
hope a student representative could "create a space for
staff voice."
Wessler said he believed that students could afford to
bring to attention the concerns of staff who have themselves stayed quiet out of a fear of risking their jobs.
SAG also maintains that choosing staff wages is not a
staff-only issue. "Staff wages are a community concern,

and we are members of the community," Rubin said. "We
wanted a student observer or member on the CRC apart
from a concern for a living wage."
When the CRC was formed last summer, President Al
Bloom asked its members to consider the goals of the
Living Wage and Democracy Campaign as part of their

advisory group and SAG

bers believe their group has

decision-making process.

')

Nate Wessler

there were two reasons behind the group's push for a student representative on the CRC: a desire to improve communication with the committee and the knowledge that
"staff we're friends with don't feel adequately represented."
According to Young, the CRC never intended for SAG
to be anything more than a group to "bounce ideas offof."
But resigning SAG members believe that students should
play a direct role in discussions of staff wages.
Resigning SAG member Cathy Meals 'O4 pointed out
that the group would not have pushed for a student representative if the current system had allowed SAG sufficient
input. "We're not doing it just to have a student on the
committee," she said.
Equal Opportunity Officer and CRC member
Sharmaine LaMar described her reaction to the letter of
resignation as "disappointment and hurt." She hopes that
Student Council will appoint "a new group, one that will
be more balanced and not composed of students with one
agenda in mind."
Four out of five SAG members are part of the Living
Wage and Democracy Campaign. The fifth, Matt Rubin 'O3,
is the SC representative.
As a result, CRC member and Director of Community
Service Learning Pat James said, "One of the difficulties

CRC

members main-

tained that staff they had
spoken to were not comfortable with having a student on the committee. "It
felt strange to our staff to
have students involved,"
Young said.
According to Bloom, the
CRC "is a duly representative committee of the staff,
and they don't want" a student sitting on the committee. He did not express a
personal view on the matFile Photo
ter: "I think we have to

Melanie Young
Another major factor in
denying students a place on the committee was the general decision "not to expand the membership of the group
after we had all done so much work," including building
trust and learning about compensation theories and systems together, James said. She added that the president's
office had asked that a member of its staff join the committee and that the CRC hadsaid no.
A major point of concern for SAG has been the extent
and nature of the CRC's record-keeping. Although many

campus committees keep detailed minutes of their meetings, which describe who says what, the CRC keeps only
"group memories," or general records of what topics were

discussed and what decisions were made.

"We're not questioning the members' ability to represent their own
concerns. We do question the
CRC's ability to represent
campus-wide concerns."
Mariah Montgomery 'O4
However, "we fell down in our job of writing our group
memories," Young said. She claimed the lapse totaled only
two or three months, but Meals said no memories were
kept between July and April.
Rubin described an incident in which he and Wessler
requested group memories from the CRC and were told to
look at the minutes from Staff Advisory Council (SAC)
meetings instead. When they requested the minutes, a
SAC member told them, "These are not for kids."
Young said there were "good reasons" for the record-'
keeping lapse, but that the CRC began keeping memories
again at SAG's request. James and LaMar added that no
student has ever come to them to ask about the committee's proceedings.
Young said group memories were "the same thing" as
minutes because they "record what was talked about at
the meeting." She later defended group memories as a different and more appropriate means of record-keeping for
the CRC because "we're not formal like that in our conversation." James said that "most of the committees [she
is] on don't keep detailed minutes."
SAG found that the group memories did not adequately reveal the content of the CRC's discussions. "It's more
like an agenda from before the meetings started,"
Montgomery said
None of the other advisory groups to the CRC have
asked for the group memories. "They've given us feedback
when asked," Young said.
The CRC formed as a result of a Board of Managers
committee recommendation during a long-term planning
process in 1997 to 1999. It officially began work in the
spring of 2001, two years later.
In the end, the CRC makes its recommendation to

Swatties protest war in Washington
BY CATHY DANH

cdanhl@swarthmore.edu

About 45 Swarthmore students attended a national antiwar march in Washington, D.C. last Saturday. The
Swarthmore group was organized jointly by Why War? and
the Swarthmore Progressive Action Committee (SPAC).
Student participants marched along with more than 75,000
other protesters in the name of peace.

"Personally, I think that the anti-war movement is
important, because it is coming out of the anti-globalization
movement that began so strongly in Seattle," Why War?
founder Micah White 'O3 said. "That movement was work-

ing on developing an intellectual theory that I personally
find very interesting and on target."
"SPAC has historically gone to protests," SPAC co-coordinator Cathy Meals 'O4 said. "When we saw the issues that
were going to be addressed, there was no question as to
whether or not we would go."
A2O, as the march was named, called for a re-orientation of United States foreign policy according to what
organizers consider the requirements of social and economic justice. In addition, its leaders condemned racial
profiling and military recruitment of non-white youth, supported government funding for non-military-based financial aid for education, and backed full disclosure of military contracts with universities. They also marched
against the "degrading secret imprisonment of immi-

grants."

At the beginning of the march, the Swarthmore contingent attended a rally at the Washington Monument. This
event was coordinated by the Stop the War Coalition,
which is an umbrella organization composed of "a lot of
anti-war groups and a lot of student groups," SPAC co-coordinator Matt Armstrong 'O5 said. "The rally was probably
the largest that I have been a part of. The atmosphere was
very positive and non-violent.

Child porn
investigation
continues
There have been no further developments in the child pornography
investigation focusing on a
Swarthmore student.
Lt. David Peifer of the Delaware
County Criminal Investigation
Division (CID) said that although the
investigation was ongoing, no
charges have been filed against the
student.
However, he anticipated that the
case would move forward in the next
two weeks.
Peifer is the leader of the ClD's
Internet Crimes Against Children
Task Force.
On April 11 members of the CID
and Swarthmore Police were on campus armed with a search warrant for
the entire college network. They
searched the network for files

belonging to the student.
According to the search warrant
affidavit, the student admitted to
possessing and sending child
pornography images, having phone
sex with a 17-year-old boy and having

a sexual conversation with an officer
posing as a 15-year-old boy.
According to the affidavit, Peifer
and Swarthmore Police Officer
William Thomas seized the student's
personal computer over spring break
after the number he gave to the
undercover officer was traced to his

roommate's phone.

"We saw some speakers [at the rally], including Martin
Luther King III," Armstrong said. "The speakers discussed
the ways in which a non-violent movement could be successful," and "described ways we could work in conjunction [with other organizations] and what to do when we

went home."

After the monument rally, the group began to march
toward the U.S. Capitol building, past the White House and
down Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the Department of

Justice.
There were no arrests in conjunction with the events on
Saturday, which were all permitted marches, though other
arrests did occur at related rallies throughout the weekend.
"The police presence was very low, which surprised me,"
Meals said.
"I thought it was a great [event] and much larger than I
expected," White said. "On the whole, I was pleased that it
was so large and that there were so many individuals who
were middle-aged."
As Meals was marching, she "turned around to see all
these people. It was pretty great. The vibe was good. High

sprits and peaceful."
"There is really no way to describe what it felt like to
look forward and back in the march and see so many people," White said.
There were "four different rallies in the city that day,"
said Meals, all four of which "came together to march to the
Capitol." In addition to the anti-war march, an explicitly
pro-Palestinian event, an anti-IMF and World Bank rally,
and calls to end U.S. support for a military dictatorship in
Colombia took place on Saturday.
For Meals, it was "interesting to see the different people
marching [for] different issues. You had anti-corporate peo-

ple marching next to pro-Palestinian people."
Some members of the Swarthmore contingent were
taken aback by the strong presence of some pro-Palestinian
marchers.

surprise," White said.
Toward the end of the march, "the feeling was more militant than a lot of us were comfortable with the proPalestinians marchers," Meals said.
Despite these sentiments toward the march's end, those
who attended found it a worthwhile experience. It is impor-

tant to "show visibly how many people support the [antiwar] cause," said Meals, "and are marching for peace."

Movie Committee wins partial budgeting appeal
intent was for the two groups to host

BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

After an extended debate over spring
budgeting appeals, Student Council supported the Movie Committee's appeal and
rejected
CIVIC's. Misunderstandings
lengthened debate at the Student Council
meeting Monday night. The two groups,
Cooperative Involvement and Volunteers
in Communities (CIVIC) and Movie

Committee, came before SC to appeal the
decisions made at the Student Budget
Committee (SBC) meeting Sunday.
At Sunday's meeting, SBC entertained
an appeal from the Film Society to have
the $l,OOO that was cut from its budget reinstated. The $l,OOO budget cut represented
one-fourth of Film Society's budget, and
SBC decided that it would be too detrimental to the survival of the already struggling
group for it to lose that much money.
As a solution, SBC took $l,OOO from
Movie Committee, whose budget is five
times larger, in the hopes that the move
would open up LPAC for one weekend during the year, since the Movie Committee
would not have enough funds to show
movies every weekend. As a result, the
Film Society could show one of its films,
giving the group greater visibility on campus.
The Movie Committee took this move to
mean that SBC wanted it to host a joint
event with the Film Society using that
$l,OOO. Kai Xu 'O3, speaking for the Movie
Committee, complained that it was
improper for SBC to move money from one
group to another so that they could work
jointly. "We don't understand why we need
to remove money from our account in
order to co-sponsor a joint event," he said.
Xu's appeal confused SC, and for the
next three hours the council remained
under the false impression that SBC's

a

campus event together. Only toward the
end of the debate was Christine Smallwood
'O3, the treasurer of the Film Society, able
to explain that SBC's original intent was
just to return the money it had cut from
the Film Society while opening up LPAC.
This would enable the Film Society to have
a large venue to show the films they would
rent with the additional money. A joint
event wasn't even discussed, Smallwood
said.
By this point, however, SC had become
focused on the idea of a joint event.
Student Council Co-President Liane Rice
'O3 had suggested that, since SC has a closer relationship with the Movie Committee
than with the Film Society, the $l,OOO
should be given to the former group. Her
reasoning was that this way SC would be
able to control the joint event, since SC
appoints
members
of the Movie
Committee. Rice even suggested that SC
dissolve the Movie Committee if it failed to
meet requirements for the joint event.
Rice stated her belief that Film Society
has not done enough to advertise and
improve its visibility and that because of
this failure it should not be rewarded with
a larger budget. "I don't like what SBC did.
I don't feel that they made the right decision," Rice said.

SC ultimately decided to let the Film
Society keep $5OO and returned the other
$5OO to the Movie Committee.
The second appeal came from CIVIC.
Members were unhappy with SBC's decision to fund them for only one semester
instead of the entire year, pending a complete review of their charter, bylaws and
operating procedures. CIVIC representatives were angry that the a review had
been forced upon them.
Marvin Barron 'O2, SBC treasurer,
explained that CIYlC's lack of transparency

April 25, 2002

made developing a budget for them difficult.
"There are questions that we want to ask
and we don't have the information to ask
them," Barron said.
SBC does not want to see a group as
large as CIVIC fail, and it fears that if
CIVIC follows its current course it is in
danger of doing so. SBC has $6,000 set aside
for CIVIC's second-semester budget in a
special allocations reserve. The money is
available, and SBC will give it to CIVIC as
soon as it becomes better organized.
CIVIC is concerned about the uncer-

tainty of such an arrangement, however,
and feels that it would add to instability in
an organization where stability is very
important.

CIVIC members argued that they need
to commit to help outside organizations for
a full year and do not like being unable to
guarantee these services for both semes-

ters.

Barron argued that this concern about
the future is the only means SBC has to
ensure that CIVIC will communicate more
effectively and clarify its structure.
Seeta Sistla 'O4, a CIVIC intern, argued
that SBC's actions were punitive. She was
upset by the resulting uncertainty. '"We
promise you the money, but we don't
promise you the money' is what we hear
over and over again," she said.
Sistla insisted that CIVIC had done
everything it was asked to do and was not
even aware that there was anything wrong
until very recently. She believes that SBC
did not pay adequate attention to the group
in making its decision. "We had everything there, if anyone cared to look," Sistla

said.
After

listening to CIVIC's emotional
appeal, SC supported SBC's decision in
this case, and unanimously voted to
uphold it.

Students of color
question U.S. war
BY REIKO TESHIBA

rteshibl@swarthmore.edu
As the war on terrorism continues, one student group cannot
help but wonder about the implications of American foreign policy
on the already disadvantaged.

Radical African Dissent (RAD) sponsored an open educational
night in honor of People of Color Against the War
National Day of Truth, established by INCITE!, a national radical
organization for feminists of color working to end violence against
women.
The event featured presentations by RAD members who
addressed different aspects of the war on terrorism. RAD, a
Swarthmore group that formed in early February, is an anti-racist
activist group open to anyone of African descent. According to
Jessica Pope 'O5, one of RAD's core members, the group seeks to look
into Swarthmore's policies and make them "proactively anti-racist."
"We wanted to examine how the war on terrorism is another
example ofracism cloaked in a desire to protect Americans and help
underdeveloped nations," she said. "Whose war is it? Who is it helping? Who's being harmed? What's not being talked about in the
name of patriotism?" These were all among the questions Pope

event Thursday

posed to open the meeting.
Chela Delgado 'O3 talked about the various definitions of terrorism and American foreign policy. According to a Library of
Congress report written prior to Sept. 11 and revised Sept. 12, she
said, "terrorism is broadly defined as politically motivated violence
perpetuated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or
clandestine agents."
"We're talking about the killing of civilians for political means,"

she added.

Delgado noted that the United States has been involved in supporting subnational governments in countries like Chile and

Nicaragua to protect American interests.
A resident of New York City, Tsha Pascal 'O4 recalled how she
was in French class when she first heard of the attacks on the Twin
Towers. She thought it was a joke, but when her professor called for
a moment of silence, Pascal realized it was not.
She asked of the war, "What's the goal? When do we know when
we've won?" Pascal added that the president's goals were to destroy
Osama bin Laden's training camps, to destabilize the Taliban and to
hunt down bin Laden. While the first two goals have been accomplished, the third could take years.
"Can we take an honest look at American foreign policy without
considering human rights?" Pascal said. "The United States should
step back as a global partner as opposed to a global hegemon." She

also thinks that the media coverage was biased as a result of governmental control.
According to Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2, the Pentagon used $4OO billion to finance the war on terrorism. This amount represented a $4B
billion increase in military spending before the war. The extra funding came from money usually available to job training programs,
the Department of Education, social security and Medicare.
Existing social programs were sacrificed to fund the war, she said.
Shreya Mahajan 'O5 and Nicola Wells 'O5 talked about racial profiling and hate crimes using stories and interviews of victims, particularly those of Arab, Muslim or South Asian background.
Mahajan and Wells said many of these crimes are against immigrants who cannot report the incidents for fear of INS deportation.
"It's a war on immigrants," Mahajan said. "We call ourselves the
country of immigrants, but the immigrants are seen as a threat to
national security."
Student reactions were mostly positive about the well-attended
event. "RAD put up a very compelling presentation," Raghu Karnad
05 said. "I'm glad they're trying to remind us that [the war] is still a
live issue, as much as we think that it's over and done with. I strongly support their positions on the racial profiling, racial hate and civil
liberty restrictions that are occurring right here in the U.S."
"I definitely appreciated the information about where the
Pentagon funding is coming from," Jessica Salvatore 'O2 said. "I was
disturbed but not really surprised that the money was coming out of
social programs."
Hang Le 'O3 thought Wells' and Mahajan's presentation about
hate crimes was "extremely effective."
"It showed a reality of the war that is not reflected on mainstream media," she said. "I would have liked to have seen more
about what could be done, given their stance as people of color."
Sam Blair 'O2 also thought the hate crimes discussion was "excel-

"I think the presentation gave a valuable perspective linking the

and poor people," he said. "There's a tendency for the white progressive activist community to ignore how changes in policy affect

Where's the
outrage?
Swatties are famous for activism, community service
and civic involvement of all kinds. We hold sit-ins, days of
silence, candlelit vigils, protests, marches, educationals
and speak-outs on Parrish Beach. We care about everything from the homeless in Philadelphia to the discrimination policy at Fortune 500 company Lockheed Martin.
With this in mind, the relative indifference in response to
the recently reported rape right here on campus is more
than disturbing it's Swarthmore's dirty little secret.

It is clear that safety whistles alone
won't cut it few instances of rape
happen in a place where a whistle
would do much good.

That's not to say that many are not concerned about the
recent news of a rape perpetrated by a naval officer in
December. But few seem bothered by the fact that rape
happens here every single semester, perpetrated by students against students, not by some outside stranger. In
fact, given Swatties' constant concern for oppressed
women worldwide, the attitude toward campus rape in

general belies a troublesome complacency.

Last year, four forcible sexual offenses were reported to
deans or Public Safety at Swarthmore, and these incidents,
as everywhere, are underreported. In fact, it seems likely
that sexual assault here is even more underreported,
because this community is so small, and victims usually
don't want their identity known. The stigma of the rape
victim is very much alive, and it keeps the perpetrators

free from prosecution.

Like racism and sexism, rape is an issue at Swarthmore
as it is anyplace else. However, this fact is hardly as publicized as other pressing issues. Swarthmore students
recently held a day of silence to honor the victims of hate
crimes. What about victims of rape?
Many students do not even think seriously about the
Acquaintance Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP) workshop held during orientation. Though we would hardly
draw any kind of direct connection between ASAP's effectiveness and rape on campus, the program is an important
measure of deterrence. It's also a measure of how lightly
campus culture takes the issue of sexual assault.
One factor that seems to automatically decrease ASAP's

effectiveness is its placement during orientation. First-year
orientation is prime time for "yeah, right" rules and regulations. It is the time of RAs' half-hearted exhortations not
to smoke, drink and pee in the Willets hallway, of Myrt
Westphal's orders against plastic trash cans and wall-painting, of CAs' warnings against the evils of procrastination.
These are all things that are good to avoid. Grouping ASAP
with the "yeah, right" rules sends a very mixed message
about sexual assault. Perhaps removing it from the chaos of
orientation and placing it slightly later in the year would
encourage a more serious attitude toward the workshop
and toward sexual assault in general.
It is clear that safety whistles alone won't cut it
few
instances of rape happen in a place where a whistle would
do much good. Rape awareness and prevention must have
a greater presence on campus, and these efforts should not
target only potential victims. Education can, in fact, help
prevent students from perpetrating rape, or from putting
themselves in situations that could be dangerous. Whether
this means candlelit vigils, educationals, speakouts or simply reforming ASAP, students and the adminstration must
consciously take some steps to recognize the seriousness of
sexual assault. If we can do all these things to raise awareness about staff wages, the war in Afghanistan or
Pennsylvania schools, why can't we get mad about something that hits closer to home? Where's the outrage,

Swarthmore?

Student Advisory Group members resign
Dear Editor:
We, the members of the Student Advisory Group to
the Staff Compensation Review Steering Committee,
hereby submit our collective resignation. We resign both
because as students we have been excluded from substantive participation in the review process, and because
as members of this community we see broader flaws in
the committee's workings.
When we applied for the Student Advisory Group

we understood our role would be to serve as educated liaisons to the student body; after a year's effort, we
have found it impossible to do so. Though we provided
input for a compensation philosophy survey to be distributed by email to the College community last May, students never received the survey. The condensed survey

(SAG),

results, posted during the summer, explicitly stated "0
students responded." No SAG member was questioned
about the lack of student response prior to dissemination
of this misleading statement.
Upon returning to Swarthmore, we found the committee's binder of "memories"
general sketches of topics
discussed, in lieu of detailed meeting minutes had not
been updated since July. We formally requested then that
the filing of memories resume, to no effect. Only recently, after further requests, have the memories resumed.
Given our continuing difficulty keeping informed of
Compensation Review Committee's (CRC) progress, we
proposed to the committee in February that a student
observer could bridge this communication gap. We
thought this a reasonable request; for comparison,
Harvard's recent wage review committee included three
students and also professors as voting members. The
CRC initially disagreed, but in a series of one-on-one
meetings over some weeks we were led to believe that
more direct student participation would be forthcoming.
Then, on April 16 we received the committee's final decision that there would be no greater student involvement.
While the CRC maintained that student input would "still
be welcome through the channels already established,"
we must conclude that in reality our participation as stu-

-

dents is neither wanted nor effective

As members of this community, we are equally concerned with other serious flaws in the review process.
Those of us who have worked with hourly wage staff
through the Swarthmore Living Wage & Democracy
Campaign know that many of the workers we interact
with feel they have not been well represented. The initial
nomination process was poorly communicated to all
employees and a significant number of workers in

Dining Services and Environmental Services were never
made aware of process or deadline, and hence do not feel
their priorities have been fairly represented.
Communication with certain staff departments about
the CRC's process has been similarly limited. For example, on the day before the committee's first presentations
in October 2001, there was still no notification posted in
the Sharpies break room; we eventually posted one ourselves. Further, the presenters' refusal to distribute hard
copies of their draft recommendations made it virtually
impossible for the low turnout of staff from
Environmental Services to accurately share the substance of the presentations with co-workers not present.
Throughout these presentations, there was no time for

substantive discussion of difficult issues. It has been
exceedingly difficult for workers in certain departments
to keep informed and give meaningful input.
The obstacles we have encountered as students and
the pattern of under-representation for certain staff
groups call into question this institution's rhetoric of
community. Whether attempting to represent student
perspectives or to participate as concerned members of a
community, we have repeatedly received the message
that our substantive input is neither appreciated nor
desired. For the above reasons we feel there is no other
appropriate action but to resign, effective immediately.

Zero tolerance for child porn
thing to be shrugged

Dear Editor:

of the recent child
pornography incident and investigation, I feel it is important to
emphasize the seriousness of this
student's offense and elucidate that
this matter should be considered a
threat to our community and
should, therefore, not be taken
In light

lightly.
In conversation with other students, I have more than once been
taken aback by their aloofness and
insistence that the culprit should
not be punished by the college
because he poses no real threat to

the community.
As a parent, I am appalled by
the fact that people actually think
that someone who solicits sex, of
any kind, from a child is not a
threat. I cannot imagine a more
petrifying fear than that someone
among my classmates may be prey-

ing on, or even thinking about

preying on, my child. Few

offenses

have ramifications for their victims that parallel the traumatic
effects of the sexual abuse of a

child.
The matter is serious, not some-

off or laughed
at. The matter is also pertinent to

the Swarthmore community for the
following reasons:
L Swarthmore students are not
necessarily "adults" when they

matriculate or visit the campus.
There are minors, chronological
children, among us. Should these
students, or their parents, be
forced to consider the possibility
that a child pornography buff who
has admittedly solicited phone sex
from minors might take a liking to
and try to solicit sex from them, as
they're deciding whether to come
to Swarthmore?

Deans should speak
out about porn case
Dear Editor:
I commend The Phoenix for its effort in trying to
get to the bottom of Porngate ("Student Investigated
for Child Pornography") at the college.
As all of us who are or were active in campus
journalism know, it is hard to handle stories of this
type, and I think the article, on the whole, was balanced and fair.
I do have one observation. Perhaps it's just the
quotes the reporter chose or the structure of the
story, but both the deans and the article (and the
Daily Gazette article, for that matter) seem more

concerned with electronic privacy than with the fact
that a student had a bunch of kiddie porn on his
computer and was soliciting phone sex with minors.
Even though Dean Gross wants to keep "the
process"

confidential, wouldn't it be a good idea to

mention that the college doesn't tolerate kiddie
porn, or perhaps that the administration was
shocked and saddened by the turn of events?
Instead, what we get are the deans saying that
they're going to look into making sure all the college's computers are protected and secure, that they
don't want to obstruct justice, and that it's a bad
idea to use Swarthmore equipment in a way that
violates federal law.
Not to be sensational, but it seems there's another side to the story
privileged student from
nation's top liberal arts college caught soliciting sex
with boys
that has barely been touched.
In addition, considering The Delco Daily Times
broke the story and it has been known to the administration for more than a month, why didn't the
deans take it upon themselves to preemptively talk
to the college community about a search warrant
and investigation going on at the college?
An electronic search warrant for SCCS is the
same as a bunch of cops running around campus
searching everyone's computers, a situation which I
hope would provoke an explanation from the deans.

Striving for dialogue
and understanding
I remember the moment I stepped onto Swarthmore's cam
pus and was greeted with a word: "understanding." I had
entered both a space and a project in which other individual
would strive to understand me as long as I tried to understand

them.

Implicit in this project was the recognition of difference, o
the diversity that had become the watchword of the multicul
tural politics of the 1980s and 19905. Sometimes the recognition
of these differences overshadowed the need for understanding

intent of having a day to honor victims of hate is commendable, but honoring by shutting up at random
times is ridiculous. The way to help people who have
no means of speaking up for themselves is to be their
voice, by writing letters to people in power, lobbying

F shirts no big deal

Dear Editor:

Regarding the Abercrombie shirts with potentially
offensive Chinese slogans, Asian-Americans shouldn't
overreact to T-shirts. They're pretty funny, if you ask

me.

Maybe in California, where there is actually discrimination against Asians, they should be up in
arms. But Asians are pretty much granted the same
rights as everyone else in the Northeast, and there's
no need to be up in arms about something that's just
meant to inject levity. I can't remember one time I've
been discriminated against in five years, and I don't
see the need to raise a cry of discrimination if people
crack an ethnic joke every once in awhile.
But maybe I just have too much faith in people.

to actively talk about it with one another and try to impres
upon one another why their side feels this way. This is no
about writing point-counterpoint articles in The Phoenix, o
even hosting opposing speaker events. It's a matter of bein
able to appreciate a* viewpoint even when it is not your own
and to see what it is that makes individuals do what they do
Do I understand what makes some people feel the need to join
the Israeli or American armies? I don't think I do. I also don'
truly understand what makes other people volunteer to figh
in the Occupied Territories. I feel like I need to, though.
The main difference I feel about the need for understandin
right now is that it has an end point, a reason for being: t
come up with nuanced policies, based on nuanced understanc
ings, which might actually lead to a return of some stability
structure and peace to this world. A lot of the conflicts that ar
destabilizing the world right now are incredibly complex, bot]
in terms of the actual politics and the emotional perception
tied to them: the epitome of this is the escalating Israeli

Palestinian conflict.
What should happen is a kind of common approach tha
comes out of a quest for understanding and a process of dia
logue, an approach that can win out against extremists on
either side.
I fully realize that is probably the most idealistic thing tha
has appeared in this column. And yet, I don't know what els
can be done, other than sitting helplessly by as the slaughte
and the chaos increase in size and intensity. I know tha
Swarthmore is populated by intelligent individuals, and if w
finally find a way to talk to one another and try and under
stand one another, there are few limits that we would face on
a local level. And if this approach can grow and get replicatec
in local communities all over, then I think we might stand a
chance.

France and facism
Why a two-party system works
By almost every account, Jean-Marie Le Pen is a bad, bad
man. He is a French politician who heads the National Front
party. Le Pen blames most of France's problems on its immigrant population, wants to construct a "jail 'em all" justice system of the sort which has done so little to stem crime in
America, and has referred to the Holocaust as "a detail of history." Basically, he's a French version of Pat Buchanan. If that
concept doesn't shock you, then read on for more horror.
Le Pen has just come in second in France's first round of
presidential elections, beating Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and winning himself a shot agaiast incumbent Jacques Chirac.
Le Pen will almost certainly be beaten like a rented mule in the
general election, but just the fact that he has been able to get
this far shows that European
politics have been developing
in a rather distasteful direction. All the European papers

have broken out their natural
disaster metaphors, and
French college students have

set their indignation meters to
full blast, taking to the streets
to denounce Le Pen as a fascist. It's good that they're
protesting against the guy, but
given the French track record
on fighting fascism, we may

want to keep an eye on the sit-

uation.

This isn't an isolated incident, either. AH across
Europe, hard right parties are
The Price of Liberty
gaining influence. It already
happened in Austria with the
rise of Jorg Haider, and the
Italy
and
Netherlands,
Denmark are all experiencing comparable movements. And
although they generally aren't subjected to the sort of scrutiny
that right-wingers face, hard left political parties are all over
the place, as well. Jospin is a former Trotskyite, and the municipal government of Berlin is partially under Communist rule
again. If you add all of the fringe and extremist parties in
France together, a group which includes two right-wing parties, two modern Trotskyites, a Communist, assorted Green
parties, and the comically named Hunting-Fishing-NatureTradition party, they got almost halfof the vote.
This all goes to show the underappreciated strength of the
American two-party system. Yes, the two parties are becoming
more and more similar. Yes, there is ridiculously little competition for most congressional seats. And yes, there are a lot of
interesting policy innovations which will never be attempted
because neither major party is willing to advocate them. But at
least when I go to bed on election night, I do not have to worry
that by the time I have woken up, some weird little fringe party
with less than 20 percent of the electorate's support will have
wormed its way into office and made itself an indispensable
element of a coalition government. The likes of John Hagelin,
Lyndon LaÃouche and Pat Buchanan will never be more than
sideshow oddities in the three-ring circus of American politics,
and that's all right by me.
Furthermore, let's take a look at some of the claims that
third party supporters make and see how they stack up to the
reality. Having a bunch of parties hasn't increased voter satisfaction. Voter turnout was at a historic low, and some people
were worried that the process of EU-ization was making their
ballots increasingly irrelevant. The multi-party system hasn't
increased interest in the political process. Before Le Pen's surprise victory, most people were commenting on how dull and
uninspiring the presidential race was. And it hasn't even
allowed the most popular candidate to win! As a result of the
multi-party system, Lionel Jospin, the only candidate who
could have beaten Chirac
who, in fact, probably would have
beaten him is not permitted to run. I never thought that anything could make the Florida balloting process look fair and
efficient, but here we are.
Although I imagine that the French system makes politics
much livelier, I would rather put up with boring, predictable
politics than evil ultra-nationalists and zany left-wingers. All
in all, it is not necessarily a bad thing to have a government
that is moderate, sluggish and resistant to change.
As a final note, I want to admit that it is a bit hypocritical
for me to write this. I am a card-carrying member of the
Libertarian Party who voted for Harry Browne. Despite my
changed opinion on third parties, I still have not changed my
registration, partially because I still have issues with both the
Republicans and Democrats, and partially because it is pretty
cool to be a "card-carrying member" of something.

Award ceremony should take place
Dear Editor:
At Swarthmore this Sunday, world-renowned poet
Mahmoud Darwish will read from his poetry for the
first time ever in the United States. Although little
known in this country, Darwish is widely considered
"the poetic voice of the Palestinian people," and his
work has been translated into over 20 languages. Born
in a Palestinian town which was destroyed and
replaced by a Jewish settlement in 1948, Darwish has
been engaged in the Palestinian struggle for self-determination since the 19605. He has been jailed several
times for reading his poetry and for traveling without a
permit within Israel.
Darwish is this year's recipient of the Lannan
Foundation's Prize for Cultural Freedom in recognition
of "his courage in speaking out against injustice and
oppression, while eloquently arguing for a peaceful and
equitable co-existence between Palestinian Arabs and

Israeli Jews." Darwish was initially to receive this
Swarthmore. But for reasons which are not
clear to us, the plan was changed. Darwish will still
read on campus, but will no longer receive the Lannan
Foundation award here.
Why did the plan change? Why did the administration decide it had to distance itself from the presentation
of this award and the controversy it would no doubt create? As Jews, we are saddened that Swarthmore has not
been courageous enough to honor a Palestinian poet
unequivocally. It is surely a missed opportunity.
This letter, though written by five students, reflects
the sentiments of twelve students and a professor.

Middle East discussion requires careful thought
Dear Editor:
It is admirable to see The Phoenix examine
American policies critically, but one would hope to see
Swarthmoreans writing with careful thought and
analysis. To state that "the FBl's definition of terrorism
should be applied to state militaries just as much as
religious extremists" ("U.S supports Israeli Terror," by
Kent Basset et al, April 4) is to misunderstand the
basics of international law.
Every nation has the right to defend itself, and to
maintain a "state military" to do so. Any government
exercising this right takes on a serious responsibility,
and may be held accountable by the international community and its citizens.
This is fundamentally different from terrorism.
Terrorist acts can be undertaken by anyone with any
...

cause, with no public accountability.
This difference is essential when considering violent
acts, but it is even more crucial in pursuing peace. A
real peace treaty can only be achieved if the parties are
in control of their militaries. Jordan's King Hussein
controlled his combatants, and so negotiated a workable peace treaty with Israel. Yasser Arafat has, at the
April

25, 2002

least, tolerated the existence of semi-independent terrorist groups; so it is hardly clear that he could negotiate peace even if that were his goal.
The op-ed goes on to a vastly one-sided view of
Middle East history. For example, while it is true that
the West Bank and the
"in 1967, Israel conquered
Gaza Strip," the authors fail to mention that this "conquering" was in response to an attack from multiple
Arab countries determined to destroy the State of
Israel. Also unmentioned is the fact that Arabs controlled this territory from 1948 to 1967 without ever concluding that there was a "Palestinian people" with a
right to an independent state. Nor do the authors mention that it was 10 years, and another bloody war later,
before Anwar Sadat became the first Arab leader to recognize that Israel had a right to exist.
Basset and the other authors are rightly proud to
demand their right to issue "critical discussion of
United States/Israeli policies." I hope in the future,
however, that without losing their passion for justice
they can generate discussion with more logic and
more information.

Philly cheesesteak war:
GENO'S VS. PAT'S
Humor columnist briefly turns food critic for a
culinary investigation of the Philadelphia classic
BY JOEY SPADOLA

Vegetarian and expert off-campus
navigator samples fries and drinks

"Comer carne," declares Mario Vargas
Llosa, in one of his more controversial novels, "es una prerrogativa de los dioses": it is
a prerogative of the gods to eat meat. We
may well dispute whether the Peruvian
meant to subsume, under the lofty appellation of "carne," that renowned dish upon
which presently rests the culinary (not
more than the cultural) reputation of our
lovely Philadelphia, and which, by dint of
its peculiar savor, has for decades convulsed the streets of the City of Brotherly
Love
not more than the stomachs of her
inhabitants. Here, naturally, I refer to the
Cheesesteak. We may as reasonably dispute, moreover, whether the winds of fate
have even so much as diffused the concept
of this extraordinary food as far as Peru, or
any country, for that matter, outside of our

own.

It is any rate certain that when, for
who were, except
during religious ceremonies, "eaters of
grain," as Homer has it
made special
sacrifices of meat to the gods, there were
no cheesesteaks adorning their altars.
Dionysus, for all the other things in which
he indulged, knew not the sordid pleasure
of a cheesesteak. By the same the same
token, the Romans, the Egyptians, the
ancient Chinese, the natives of the
Americas none of them, it is quite safe to
say, ever saw fit
or ever thought
to
reverence their deities with that strange
fruit of modernity, the cheesesteak.
It is on this account that I did not consider myself a usurper of godly prerogative
upon making the infamous trip, this weekend, into the heart of South Philadelphiaâto the very lieu de naissance of the
Cheesesteak
with the object of consumand, happily for my
ing no less than
two specimens of
health, no more than
the infamous cuisine. And never in my life
have I felt so poignantly the frailty of my
mortal condition as I have done in the days
following upon that audacious deed. But in

instance, the Greeks

BY RASHELLE ISIP
I met up with Joey and our photographer Michael at the
Swarthmore train station to travel to the concrete jungle of South

Philadelphia, ready to experience the legendary, tasty, fattening
cheesesteak. I, for one, have never had a real Philadelphia cheesesteak. I don't even think I've had a noteworthy imitation. In fact,
I'm a vegetarian, and I guess it may seem futile for me to have
tagged along on this trip, but what the heck I thought of the idea,
and I knew where we were going. My role in this challenge was
secondary food taster, which meant a day of sampling french fries

and soda.

Geno's Steaks (since 1966) and Pat's King of Steaks (since 1930)

are two South Philadelphia cheesesteak legends. They are located
directly across the street from one another, which adds to the warring atmosphere of giant bright orange sign versus giant pasty
white sign, both proclaiming themselves the best. We spotted
Geno's first, while walking down 10th Street. Signs screaming the
name of the legend "GENO'S STEAKS" loomed over customers
munching away at curbside picnic tables. Since Geno's was the
first we came upon, Geno's was the first we tried.
Joey got on line and placed his order. After some minor confusion, we realized that there are two separate windows, one for
cheesesteaks and the other for drinks and fries. After realizing
that a cheesesteak does not come with an order of fries, I placed an
order for a small fries and a birch beer/Swift service is the key to
such businesses as these
it's probably faster than any fast food
chain restaurant you can think of. The fries came in a cup with a
fork stuck in them and the birch beer looked a rather unappealing
shade of red, almost crimson.
With goods in hand I approached the condiment counter. A litaha!
tle bit of ketchup, and
some intriguing sauce with a sign
proclaiming, "VERY HOT!" I usually find that things labeled "very
hot" don't seem too spicy to me, so I loaded my fries up with the
thick, rich sauce. As I dug in, I noticed that the fries were golden
yellow and had a nice crispness to them. Not too salty
a bit on
the sweet side actually. After dabbling in the ketchup, it was time
to move onto the hot sauce. Was I in for a surprise! To make a long
story short, this silly, cocky columnist got her comeuppance. At
least I had a drink to save me from the ravages of spiciness.

between the appellations which represent
them. They are competitors. They glare at
one another menacingly across 9th Street.
They blazon, upon large billboards, contradicting claims of superiority. And we may
well suppose that if Geno died in his sleep
this very night, not a single tear would
sully Pat's rejoicing countenance.
If, therefore, one wishes to form an
appropriate notion of the Philly cheesesteak, one cannot eat from one of these
shops while neglecting the other. One cannot judge Pat without trying Geno; one
cannot truly know Geno while ignorant of
Pat. Such is the binary opposition of this
trade. And such was the motive for my
inanely attempting, in the ardor of ignorance and youth, what veterans of the business have nominated the double header.
Veni, vidi, edi: I came, I saw, I ate. I did
not, however, despite a vigorous attempt
and a manly resolution, conquer. Rather it
was I who, in the last analysis, was conquered
vanquished by the cheesesteak.
For although, after enduring the best blows
both of Geno and of Pat, I passed the rest of
that day and much of that night in relatively good health and high spirits, in spite
of a unpleasant sensation of satiet.
It is only today that I can once again eat
more than bananas and Rice Krispies; and
it is only today that I can once again pronounce the word "cheesesteak" and maintain my face's natural hue.
But from my infirmity comes this sole
benefit: I can here, for one and for all, put to
rest the rivalry between Pat's and Geno's

See CHEESESTEAK, pg. 13

explained.
I said two cheesesteaks. And that the
reader may understand the cause of such
gluttony on my part, a word is in order.
The true patron of Philadelphia can scarcely pronounce the words Philly cheesesteak
without evoking in his mind the image of
the two shops by which the very prestige of
the cuisine is buttressed. To the cheesesteak, they are as the marble pillars to the
Senate House of Rome; as the right and left
eye to the radiant visage of Aphrodite; as
Adam and Eve to the garden of Eden; as the
scepter and crown to the trappings of
monarchy. They are Pat's and Geno's. How
triumphantly, how euphoniously ring
their names! There is between these stores,
however, none of the harmony that obtains

'Murder By Numbers' is systematically surprising
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu

The premise amused and scared me at
once: two rich kids, one outcast for his
incredible brilliance, the other revered for
his cool charisma; both from wealthy homes
with too little supervision; each looking to
make his mark, to be noticed, to prove his
superior intellectual abilities; both sort of
bored. Stumblingupon a philosophical treatise that declares guiltless crime true freedom, the boys, Richard Haywood (the
charming smooth talker in his sleek

leather jacket)
Justin Pendleton (the distraught
genius, head-to-toe in black and disturbingly off-putting) join forces to experiment with
their own freedom. The two don't mingle in
school or socially. Instead, they meet in a
rundown hovel on some remote cliffs just
stingray and fashionable red

and

outside San Diego.

In their dank and dreary hideout, decorated by an oddly rendered portrait, which
we later, in one of a series of interludes into
the insidious power grapple of the boys'
"friendship," discover is the combination of
their two faces, they scheme and plot. It's
eerie to watch completely dichotomous
manifestations of similar psycho-emotional
ailments interact.

Justin, a character more rightly suited to
Toby Maguire than to wannabe Michael
Pitt, is shown repeatedly with his nose
buried in various thick volumes, reading
about murder, the philosophy of crime,
forensic procedures. He knows everything
he needs to know about murder investigation
most importantly, how to get off scot-

free.
Richard, on the other hand, doesn't. He
doesn't have the technological know-how
and, mostly, he doesn't care. He has Justin's
admiration. And he has the balls, the necessary pathological lack of a conscience, With
Richard's derelict instinct and Justin's aptitude combined, they've discovered the anarchist's recipe to the perfect crime, which is
decidedly murder. Totally random murder,
the ultimate test of their personal freedom.
From the outset, "Murder By Numbers"
gives the audience all the information the
characters desire. In broken bits and pieces,
we're told everything we need to know to fit
the whole thing together. The boys, in their
brilliance, cover (almost) all of their bases,
systematically and artfully planning and
enacting the perfect murder, convinced of
the infallible nature of their killing strategy: They select a random victim to whom
they have no traceable connections, leave a
false trail of clues, then sit back and watch
the fun. Driving through a grocery store
parking lot, their youth resonates as the two
quibble over the definition of "random" and
finally settle for a middle-aged mother, a
blonde, a woman they'd never seen before.
She would be the one, the means to their
end, demonstrating the freedom of their
spirits.
Sandra Bullock's Cassie Mayweather is
an excellent detective. Called "the hyena"
for her metaphorical mock penis, she cuts to
the chase, knows bullshit when she sees it
and has no qualms flaunting her expertise
or trusting her own well-trained instincts.

Haunted by a past that resurfaces post-traumatically and necessarily at the worst possible moments, she detaches herself from
people, hermits herself in her houseboat,
where she watches Matlock and eats
Pepperidge Farm SuperChunk cookies

straight from the bag. She answers to no
one, obeys no one.
And she's assigned to the case. Her new
partner, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is a
by-the-book kind of guy. Her powerful assertion overwhelms him as they stalk through
the woods and stumble onto the victim. A
rookie detective, Sam feeds directly into the
obvious answers, the line of bait the high
school students dangled behind them. But
Cassie is not so easily lured. She has a hard
time believing things could possibly be so
cut and dry. The boys sit back to reel the
San Diego police department in, to watch
their artful work unfold and laugh, confident in having outsmarted the cops.
When Richard's $7OO boots are traced
back to his line ofcredit and Cassie and Sam
show up to question him, he is surprisingly
calm, trying to sweet-talk Cassie, who he
doesn't yet know is not nearly as gullible as
the high school girls who let him tape their
intercourse.
"Something's wrong with that kid," she
says later, knowing in her heart and gut
how very right she is but lacking the tangible evidence to pin the murder on him.
And he's the son of an influential town
figure. His father has a lot of pull and even
more money. Everyone squirms when she
suggests it's him, but, her suspicions reinforced by irksome inconsistencies in Justin
and Richard's respective stories and a personal delve into Richard's sociopathological, ultra-entitled behavior, she's unwavering. She knows he did it, she says. She
knows his type. And she's determined, like
a good Nancy Drew, to get to the bottom of
things.

The jigsaw puzzle nature of the movie is

tiresome at first, because the action lags so
far behind the broken pieces, and the
wannabe-ness of so many of the no-name
actors leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.
The dialogue, at first, is stale and contrived;
the parallels between the Columbine killers
and Justin Pendleton are almost too much
to stomach.

Photos courtesy Warner Bros.

But it gets progressively better. As we're
drawn into the intensity of the detectives'

unraveling plot, we become more intimatethe surprising degree of
Richard's total self-absorption and
unscrupulous lifestyle and Justin's remarkably childlike, rather pathetic innocence
ly acquainted with

about the world. The story line flows more
smoothly and the twists and turns grow
increasingly more palatable.
Though I complained and groaned and
got hung up on technical fallacies at first, I

was caught up in the action as the end
approached: hating Richard and pitying

Justin, applauding Cassie for making the
necessary connections, for not taking the
easy route and listening to everyone else,
just because it didn't sit right. Her gut gave
her the key to the case, something I found
myself wishing I'd managed to keep more
immediately in mind: Things are not always
as they seem.

Ellington scholar hides in the past of jazz
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

A few weeks ago, I saw the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. I noticed
that I was by far one of the youngest members of the audience.
Then a few days ago, I saw Gunther Schuller lecture on
campus, and eerily enough, I noticed the exact same thing.
Most of the audience members were the same age as
Schuller, who is 75. It seemed as though me and the other
Swatties there were the youngest people there by half a
century.
This is exactly the problem with new jazz today. There
is no drive to bring new music and artists into the musical
field. The majority of recording artists today merely
mimic old techniques and re-record old standards. But the
other problem is that the people involved with jazz do not
do anything within their power to correct this.
During his talk, entitled "Duke Ellington and Jazz in
America," Schuller touched upon some of the more technical aspects of Ellington's compositions from the 1930s and
'4os. He only mentioned the shape of the current state of
jazz when facing a question from an audience member.
At one point, Schuller stated the obvious: "Jazz is now
a very neglected music, as opposed to rap, rock, hip-hop, or
any other pop music in our culture."
Well, of course that's true. Take our nearest city.
Philadelphia has no commercial jazz radio stations and a
public radio station that broadcasts jazz from 6 p.m. to 6
a.m. during the week and only six hours a night on the
weekends. You could count on one hand the number of jazz

DJs on WSRN.

But people tend to ignore that. In his talk, Schuller
almost made it a point not to mention the lack of popularity

12

or direction in jazz today. The most he said was one comment on the length of songs. "Musicians were able to say
so much in three minutes," he said. "Nowadays, we have a
lot of jazz pieces that just go on and on."
And Schuller did exactly that. He just went on and on.

He talked about the musical colors of Duke Ellington.
He discussed all of the technical aspects of Ellington's
work. He mentioned the originality in composition and the
attention the Duke paid to each ofhis musicians and their

own special abilities.
"Ellington created tone-pictures," Schuller explained.
"He was a composer who was a painter at heart and painted colors with notes."
Schuller used four Ellington compositions â"Mood
Indigo," "Daybreak Express," "Azure" and "Cottontail"
to illustrate Ellington's use of tones to paint pictures. What
Ellington did, according to Schuller, no one has done since.
"Ain't nobody doing that in jazz," he said. "He wasn't about
selling records; he was about making great music."
But it wasn't until the last question of the question-andâ

answer session that Schuller addressed concerns about the
state of jazz. In fact, he pretty much side-stepped the issue.
"There will be another Charlie Parker, another Miles
Davis, another Ornette Coleman," he said. "Jazz is now in
a holding pattern. There are technically fantastic jazz players, but they all sound as if they have been homogenized."
That was the extent of Schuller's comments on the present and future of jazz.
It was great seeing a master in the musical field come
to speak about the past of jazz. Obviously, Schuller knew
all of the technical ins and outs of Ellington's music. But
he revealed more about the present of jazz than the past.
By analyzing and hiding in the past of jazz, Schuller indirectly showed the problems facing jazz today. Anything
Schuller says could easily shape the future of jazz. But

April 25, 2002

Ellington and his orchestra perform at the Palladium

instead of trying to lead jazz in a new direction and give
form to something that many consider shapeless, Schuller
and his fellow jazz scholars tend to hide behind analysis
and recreation of old jazz standards.
In 1959, Ornette Coleman led jazz in a new direction
with his album "The Shape of Jazz to Come." Over 40 years
later, everyone
even those deeply involved with the
music
is still waiting for another groundbreaking step
that will return jazz to the youth and bring it back into the
focus of American popular culture. We still don't know the
shape of jazz to come.

That it was Pat, who, either by negligence or by conscious vicious intent, produced the cheesesteak which to
my body was no less noxious than poison, I am morally
certain. As my companion on the trip, Rashelle, can confirm who saw the meat, but did not, by a sagacious personal choice, eat it
the beef of which Pat's cheesesteak
was composed was, even to the mere sight, offensive. And
it confirms nothing but my own persistence, and perhaps
the inexplicable perversity of our species, that, without
thinking twice, d'un seul coup, I finished all of the
wretched thing.

Happy the vegetarians! Happy they

who never bothered their heads,
and still less their stomachs, with
the issue of who is the alpha
among the cheesesteak producers!
Happy the vegetarians! Happy they who never bothered
their heads, and still less their stomachs, with the issue of
who is the alpha among the cheesesteak producers! Pat,
you, I now know, do not merit that distinction. But I would
to heaven that I had never had the occasion to find out.

Fries and birch beer
From FRIES, pg. 11
I've heard stories about birch beer since I was little: "Is
it like root beer?" I'd ask my parents. "Sort of," they'd say,

"but better." Above the excruciatingly spicy taste of the
sauce, I managed to sense a rather syrupy-sweet drink
with little carbonation.
While crying and squinting through these hot sauceladen fries, I watched Joey eat. His expression really said
it all
it was a good cheesesteak. Battling down my killer
fries (if I only had gotten cheese fries!) and slurping soda
furiously, I finished. It was time to cross the street to tack-

le Pat's.
The clientele for both restaurants seemed just about
even for this lunchtime affair tourists and natives alike.
Now with some ordering experience, we went our separate
ways: Joey to the cheesesteak line and I to the fry-anddrink line.
Waiting on line was a bit uncomfortable; my lips were
literally still burning, and looking at a tray of hot chili peppers and sweet peppers on the counter next to me didn't

help matters.
The man ahead of me in line attempted to order a birch
beer, but alas, they were out! So I, too, settled for Barq's
Root Beer. I must say this skewed the results of the challenge: Geno's birch beer was a unique experience, but I
can get Barq's any time at Sharpies.
I went, ever so cautiously this time, to the condiment
table. I almost thought a jar of hot sauce would jump me
but I was saved! No hot
oh, the nightmares I'll have
sauce in sight. Just ketchup. Pat's fries also came in a
handy cup, and the drink was a bit larger. However, the
fries were a pale yellow color, salt-laden, somewhat soggy
and not as crispy as Geno's.
The ketchup almost tasted like cocktail sauce, probably
as a result of my hot sauce encounter, but without the
sauce these fries went down a lot easier. Service here was
swift, as well. If you don't know what you want by the time
you get to the head of the line, you're in trouble. A "How
to Order a Cheesesteak" sign above the ordering counters
promotes proper ordering procedures.
And finally, our story comes to an end. Host your own

Lottery shows changing housing trends
More going abroad bring Strath Haven into spring lottery; ML basement finally desirable
JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu
Mary Lyon basement renovations, the availability of Strath
Haven rooms, and the large number of students going abroad in
the fall left fewer people than
usual with a sour taste in their
mouths as they underwent the
traditionally stressful spring
housing lottery.
"I'm pretty happy with my
room,"
Rodgers
Jerusha
'O4, who pulled a single in
Hallowell, said. "But, then again,
I really would have been happy
anywhere."
Rooms Strath Haven, often
used for overflow housing, were
included in the lottery this
semester.
"We really 'want students to
have more of a choice of where
they're going to live, and that's
why we opened up
Strath
Haven," Director of Residential
Life Myrt Westphal said. "We're
certainly
to
be
going
needing that extra housing, so we
decided to open it up in the
beginning."
While many Swarthmore students put Strath Haven at the
bottom of their housing wish list,
some actually preferred it to
other housing options.
"We certainly have students
who choose Strath Haven over
other dorms," Westphal said.
Mary Lyon basement, formerly considered one of the worst
housing spots on campus, will be
completely renovated and will be
composed mostly of singles.
"ML basement will now be
mostly juniors," Westphal said.
"Those rooms will go far higher
in the lottery."
An unusually large number of
students going abroad in the fall
meant that fewer juniors and
seniors entered the lottery.
"My unscientific explanation
is that, because of world events, a
number of students who were
planning on going abroad in the
spring [of 2002] are now going
abroad in the fall," Westphal
said.
Normally, about 60 students
go abroad in the fall and 90 go in
the spring. This trend was

whenever there's a delay reporting a crime, it creates a
problem for the investigators," he said. "Not having the
physical evidence that was available is certainly going to
make it more difficult. The good thing is we've gotten cooperation on the part of people who witnessed certain seg-

ments of what happened. So that's a plus."
The Delaware County Daily Times, in an editorial published Monday, called the college's sexual assault and rape
policy "bizarre" and "criminal," saying that it could be
interpreted as an attempt "to deep-six reports of crime on

But Henry refuted this interpretation. "That is not my
goal at all," she said. "If that were true, I wouldn't have
gone to the police station with the survivor to give the
report, to support her through the process."
Henry said she advised the victim in this case, as she
does in all cases, to go to the police and report the incident.
"At some point, she decided that's what she wanted to do
and I went with her," Henry said. "Any student making a
decision to go to the police is making a hard decision,"
because it means "having someone question you about
your experience, and

Late-reported rape calls
college policy into question
From POLICY, pg. 3
evidence. This means that the clothing on the student should not be disturbed,
nor should any foreign objects such as leaves or debris be removed unless medically indicated. Advise not to shower, bathe, or go to the bathroom, wash
mouth, eat or drink or wash clothing until the student has been examined and
the forensic exam done."
The nurse on duty is also required to inform the student of her options to file
criminal charges and to inform her of "the internal college disciplinary process
if the assailant is a student." Nurses also refer students to Henry, inform them
that they may go to the hospital, and offer a host of follow-up care, including
psychological services, pregnancy testing and treatment for sexually transmittable diseases.
Unlike hospitals and some other medical centers, Worth cannot offer victims
a rape kit, a series of medical examinations to ensure a victim's safety. Victims
may choose to travel to Crozer Chester Medical Center, but requesting a kit
there means that hospital staff are automatically required to notify police. This,
Gross said, has caused reluctance in the past.
"We had one woman who went to the hospital, was informed of that there,
and chose not to go ahead with it," he said. So the administration makes it "a
point to fully inform women of their options and what every step in the process
is going to involve."
How often, how bad
Four separate incidents of forcible sexual offense were reported to Public
Safety last year, a jump from the one offense reported in 1998 and one in 1999.
Some are worried that the college's policy means those who have raped once
can go on to rape again.
"Do I feel uncomfortable about that? Yes, absolutely," Henry said.
"That's why we have ASAP [Acquaintance Sexual Assault Prevention] and
workshops," Gross said. More awareness programs aren't offered, he added,
because, "We take our instructions from students about what kind of warning
they need to hear, when.
"You've got to modulate the message, and cast it a time when it'll be heard,"
he said. "You can't keep beating people over the head."
But rape prevention is not always, or even usually, the problem.
"Most of the things that Karen Henry encounters are ambiguous circumstances," Gross said. "They're issues of consent," including disagreements over
whether a certain incident is rape, sodomy or sexual assault. Rape, according
to Public Safety, is distinguished as non-oral or anal sexual intercourse carried
out against a person's consent. Many times, though, incidents are "murky,"
according to Gross, and not easily defined.
Unique to this case, he added, is that the assailant was from outside the college. If the assailant is a Swarthmore student, he or she is at least suspended
during the victims' remaining years at Swarthmore, if not expelled.

The rule, not the exception

Henry, Goundie and Gross all emphasized that the college's policy was not

outside the norm, and that "our practice is in keeping with rape crisis centers
all over," according to Henry.
In a yet unpublished letter responding to the Daily Times' April 19 editorial,
Tom Krattenmaker, the college's director of news and information, said calling
Swarthmore's policy "criminal" was to "criminalize the standard practice at
rape counseling centers across the country and to prosecute all rape victims
who elect not to go immediately to the police."
Henry said that "a lot of people wouldn't come forward if they thought the
first thing I was going to do was call the police."
This would add to the contingent that already avoid coming forward,
"because the perpetrator is a friend of theirs who they care about or have mixed
feelings about," she said.
The policy, at times, bothers Henry, especially the prospect that a person
who has raped once could rape again. "Obviously, I don't want anybody to be
victimized by someone I know is a perpetrator," she said. "But I'm bound to confidentiality."

Exam pressure can
cause panic attacks
BY SCOTT MARTINDALE
Daily Trojan (U. Southern California)
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES
A student
feels a sudden surge of overwhelming fear
and anxiety. The feeling comes out of the blue
and without reason.
Chest pain, shortness of breath, out-ofall are symptoms of a
body experiences
very serious condition known as a panic
attack.
Characterized by an extremely intense but
brief surge of anxiety, panic attacks strike
one in 75 people at some point in their lives.
"It's a feeling of impending doom," said
Bradford King, director of Student

Counseling Services at the University of
Southern California. "It's pretty scary."
Twenty students were treated at the counseling center for panic disorder last year, and
331 were treated for some form of anxiety,
King said.
"The actual panic attack is the fear and
anticipation of having another one," he
added.
The stress of final examinations at this
time of year tends to push students beyond
manageable stress levels, leading to panic
attacks, said Gerald Davison, chair of the psychology department.

In addition to the stress of final examinations, many students are preparing to leave
friends and romantic partners for the summer a second major source of anxiety, said
Dr. Stanley Harris, clinical psychiatrist for
Student Counseling Services.

covered, King said.
Stressful life events, emotional overreaction, heredity and other biological factors
may all contribute to panic and anxiety disorders, but researchers have been unable to pinpoint specific factors.
"The disorders don't imply a cause,"
Harris said. "They just describe a state of
function that people want help changing."
About 30 percent of people with panic disorder abuse alcohol and 17 percent abuse
drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana, in
unsuccessful attempts to alleviate the
anguish and distress caused by their condition, according to the NIMH. Effective treatment for panic disorder includes a form of
psychotherapy known as cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches individuals how
to view panic attacks differently and demonstrates ways to reduce anxiety.

Minor tranquilizers, mood stabilizers and

antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety
disorders, although such medications are not
necessarily part of the treatment, Harris said.
Appropriate treatment by an experienced
professional reduces or prevents panic
attacks in 70 percent to 90 percent of patients,
according to the NIMH.
Harris estimated that he treats 2 percent to
5 percent of the campus population each year
for anxiety problems, although he said that
many other students seek help for anxiety
from private doctors. Students should seek
treatment for anxiety if they are distressed
about the way they are feeling and functioning,

Harris said.

Alcohol withdrawal and caffeine intoxication are the most common triggers that put
stressed students over the top, leading to
panic attacks, Harris said. In both cases, the

"If you feel you are unique and the only
one in a situation, you are much more likely
to get stressed," Mitchell said.
Mitchell also emphasized the importance
of avoiding procrastination, a habit that students tend to fall into as classes wind down.
"The more you procrastinate, the higher
the stress level builds up," he said. "Pace
yourself, have a strategy and save celebrations for after the finals."
Cramming for final examinations interferes with the learning process, Mitchell said,

"We will proceed with the construction
drawing phase scheduled to be completed
in October," said Dean of the College Bob
Gross '62.
The Board of Managers in September

will decide whether to take bids from con-

tractors or to delay the project by a few

months or more. Some schematics for
Parrish will be developed, but the board
will make final timetable decisions about
that in September as well.
The construction plans have also been
complicated by the college's fund-raising
efforts.

The college, Malcolm explain, took out
a bond to pay for the construction of the
science center and the new dorm. Because
the bond grants the college tax-exempt
status, it goes against the legal terms of
the bond to fundraise aggressively with
the express purpose of financing the
building projects. This creates the need
for a donor to give to the endowment in an

effort to offset the spending on the new
dorm.

While no donor has set the new dorm
as a "main philanthropic goal," Malcolm
said he does not believe this lack of secure
funding will cause a long delay in con-

struction plans.
"Our hope is that we'll find donors out
there that will give us realistic, unrestricted money for the endowment that
we'll use to offset the debt service of the
bond," Malcolm said.

While the, college looks to secure a
large donation, it would be in its best
interest to avoid a long delay due to the
demands of the market, Westphal said.
"I have confidence that the fund raisers will come up with the money and that

somebody will come forward with a big
donation," she said. "But the longer you
wait, the more expensive the project is."

Tide hold on to down Fords 9-8

Garnet men ward off lastminute Fords comeback
BY JUSTIN KANE
jkanel@swarthmore. edu

The time in the fourth quarter, and in the season, was
winding down, and the Garnet Tide were protecting a precarious two-goal lead over their archrivals, Haverford
College, in front of a boisterous crowd at Clothier Field
Saturday.
Haverford's coach screamed frantically at his defenders, urging them to switch to a pressure defense.
Swarthmore had possession of the ball, and as long as it
stayed that way, the clock would slowly strangle
Haverford's comeback hopes.
With just over two minutes remaining, Haverford finally made the switch. Two long-stick defenders flew at
Swarthmore's Joseph DeSimone 'O4. He was trapped along
the sideline with no help. A wild, desperate pass eluded its
intended recipient, and Haverford was on the offensive.

The Swarthmore defense had held the Fords scoreless
for the previous 13 minutes, but this possession, Haverford
attacked with relentless ferocity. Soon enough, the ball
found Haverford freshman attacker David Henry and,
moments later, the back of the net. With 1:29 remaining,
Swarthmore's 9-8 advantage suddenly seemed paper-thin.
These were the final make-or-break minutes in the
make-or-break game of the season, and they were not looking good. The Haverford attack retained its ferocity, and
each chance Swarthmore had to seal the victory was
squandered by a turnover. Thirty seconds remained, and
the Fords were moving the ball around the perimeter, just
waiting for the inevitable opening to appear.
It did not. Swarthmore midfielder Tom Coughlin 'O5
snagged a takeaway and made sure of it, sprinting down
the field as the final seconds ticked away. He was mobbed
by his teammates at midfield.
The 9-8 victory, Swarthmore's first this season in the
Centennial Conference, showcased a determined team that
captain Blake Atkins 'O2 said "is one of the tightest knit
squads I have ever played on." Though the Garnet Tide's
record (6-8,1-5 Centennial Conference) was not what many
had hoped and there were losses that should have been
otherwise, Atkins declared the season a success.
Swarthmore's strengths were on display Saturday: a
defense that dug in its heels and withstood constant pressure, a young but skilled goalkeeper and a potent coterie of
scorers. Most of all, however, the team's unfaltering determination won the game.
"I just wanted to win," Atkins said. "It didn't even matter how we did it."

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Clearing the ball from Swarthmore's defensive third, freshman midfielder Tim Chryssikos sprints past the check of
Haverford midfielder Tom Cassidy. Chryssikos and the Tide won a dogged battle against the Fords, 9-8.
Throughout the game, scoring from the Garnet Tide's

talented midfielders kept the team in competition. Goals
from John Murphy 'O3, John Cleaver 'O2, Coughlin and
Than Court 'O3 all helped the Tide stay on top, and attacker Jeff Donlea's ['os] second goal gave Swarthmore its margin of victory.
"We were confident in the final quarter," Cleaver said.
"We knew we were controlling the game, and as long as we
continued to play as we knew how to play, we would hold
on for the win."
The victory capped the season and pointed toward a
successful future for the Tide.
"The win completed more than the season, it completed
my career," Atkins said. "Everybody was asking me how I
thought the game was going to go and how I was going to

Evil Buzzards pull out 22-21
win over visiting Lafayette
BY ED SHELDON

esheldol@swarthmore.edu

After five lead changes and outstanding performances from several players, the men's rugby
club won in dramatic fashion Saturday, beating
Lafayette 22-2
L
The Buzzards got off to a strong start, with
Erik Munroe 'O4 outrunning the Lafayette
defense for a try in the first five minutes.
However, the lead would be short lived, as several Swarthmore penalties allowed Lafayette to
close in on the try line. Despite some tough
defensive play by the Buzzards, Lafayette was
able to score a try and the conversion, which
gave it a 7-5 lead.
Swarthmore came back quickly, as Manu
Pradha 'O3 barreled through the Lafayette line to
score his first try of the season. But Lafayette
would not give up and quickly capitalized on several Swarthmore penalties to score on a drop
kick and a penalty kick, taking the lead at 13-10.
Lafayette then increased its lead to 18-10 with a
second try.

The Buzzards would not concede defeat as
Munroe scored his second try of the day on a
beautiful 50-meter run. Sloppy play on the
Swarthmore side, however, gave Lafayette another penalty, which increased its lead to 21-15.
Brian Kasch 'O2, though, was not about to
watch his final home game slip through his fingers. In the final seconds, Kasch picked up a loose
ball and took off for the try line. After breaking
several tackles, he was able to dish the ball to
Pablo Montagnes 'O2, who then moved it to Axel
Neff 'O2. Neff, whose speed and size have been an
asset to the Buzzards all season, was able to beat
the Lafayette defense for the try, making the
score 21-20 Lafayette.
All eyes then fell on Jon Fombonne 'O5, whose
conversion attempt would mean the difference

between a dramatic win and a heartbreaking
loss. Fombonne, however, had no trouble putting
the ball through the uprights, earning two points
and the win for Swarthmore.
The Buzzards have won their last two games
and hope to continue their streak as they travel
to Albright this weekend.

do, and all I could think about was ending on a win, regardless of how I played personally. I went out beating the team
I cared most about beating."

Despite losing Atkins and defenders Jason Choi 'O2 and
Matt Trakimas 'O2 to graduation, this young team should
improve on this season's performance next year. "The
team is in the best shape is has been in a while," Atkins
said. "With an entire underclass attack, defense and goalie
this year, and numerous freshmen midfielders, those players will have a chance to mature."
Cleaver, who will be expected to take up a larger part of
the scoring load upon Atkins' departure, agreed. "Though
there were the inevitable bumps in the road during the
season, we are extremely confident going into the off-season," Cleaver said. "The team is riding high now."

Pro rugby league to hold
sevens tournament May 11
The American National Rugby League will hold its second annual
Day Sevens Tournament, on Saturday, May 1L with the first
match scheduled for noon on Cunningham Field.
The Mother's Day Sevens Tournament will feature professional players
from the AMNRL teams in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and
Delaware. The local favorites are the Media Mantarays, who will feature
U.S. National Team player and Swarthmore men's rugby coach Fred
Gruhler, British professional Ryan Blake from the Halifax Blue Sox and
Australian hooker Warren Heilig from Brisbane.
Making their debuts at the pro club level will be Swarthmore fullback
Ted Chan 'O2 and inside center Axel Neff 'O3, who will dress as reserves for
Media.
Gruhler is excited for the tournament and thinks it is something the
Swarthmore community should come out and see. "There are teams coming from all over the U.S. to play in this event," he said.
Rugby league sevens is designed to be hard hitting, fast-paced and
crowd friendly.
"There are seven men on each team, and the game is two seven-minute
halves," the 6'5", 245-lb. Gruhler said. "There are no pads, no hard helmets,
no stoppages and nowhere to hide. So come to the rugby field on May 11
and see what all the talk is about. You won't be disappointed."
The Swarthmore College Men's Rugby team will be selling food, drinks
and t-shirts at the event.

Baseball clobbers Neumann to Women's ultimate
capture third straight victory
headed to Regionals
BY MARK JANOFF

mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu

Losing was contagious for the
Garnet Tide earlier this season. But
winning has been infectious this past
week, as the squad strung together
three victories in a row. According to
'O2,
tri-captain Scott Kushner
improved offensive play has been a
key to the Tide's recent success.
â 'What happened is that we just started scoring runs, which keeps you in
games," Kushner said. "When you
put runs on the board and are always
threatening to score, you always
think you can battle back."
Offensive confidence certainly
paved the way for two Garnet victories in the doubleheader versus
Gettysburg. In the first game, the
team responded to a first-inning
Gettysburg run with two first-inning
runs of its own. Swarthmore went on
to win the game 5-3 behind a 3-for-3
effort by Ryan Pannorfi 'O4 and a
complete game five-hitter by Jared
Leiderman 'O5.
In the second game, Matt
Goldstein 'O4 pitched a shutout in a
3-0 Garnet victory. The earned
Goldstein Centennial Conference
Player of the Week status for the second time this season. Earlier in the
year, Goldstein received offensive
POW honors. "I was definitely excited, especially because it was my first
conference win of the season,"
Goldstein said of the honor. He was

quick to thank the Garnet bats as
well. "In the Gettysburg games, we
were stringing hits together better
than we have all season," he said.
The Garnet have also improved
their defensive play in recent games.
In the first game of the doubleheader,
the team committed no errors and
benefited from four Gettysburg fielding mishaps. "Now we know what it's
like for other teams to watch us
play," Kushner said, referring to the
Garnet's propensity to commit crucial errors earlier in the season. He
added that the team has also turned
several double plays in recent games.
Swarthmore benefitted from balanced play in Monday's 13-5 victory
over Neumann. The Garnet scored
their 13 runs on 14 hits and committed only two errors. The offense was
powered by Brandon King 'O5, who
went 3-for-4 with three runs, two
RBIs and two walks. Goldstein
showed his offensive skills, chipping
in with a 3-for-5, two RBI effort of his
own. On the mound, Carlton Davis
'O4 pitched six and two-thirds innings
and gave up only four earned runs.
Despite the team's recent success,
the players think they should have
played better all season. "It's been a
very disappointing season all
around," Davis said. "We've had guys
not having the kind of season they're
capable of. But we have the kind of
momentum we need going into next
season."
Davis cited the April 2 game

against Ursinus as the turning point
of the season. The Garnet were 2-2 in
the Centennial Conference going into

the game, but blowing a five-run lead
to Ursinus sent Swarthmore into a 10game skid.
But the team got going against
Johns Hopkins and Franklin &
Marshall, the two top-ranked teams
in the Centennial Conference,.
Although the Garnet lost all four
games against those teams, they held
leads at various times and showed
'they could play with elite squads.

"We're just starting to turn the
corner," Davis said. "It could have
been this year."
"Last season we ended on a high
note," Kushner added. "I hope the
guys are able to carry this one over to
next year. With every year, the experience factor is going up."
The Garnet close their season this
Saturday with a doubleheader at
Haverford at 1 p.m. The game also
has Hood Trophy implications. The
trophy is the award given to the
school
the
most
that wins
Swarthmore-Haverford athletic contests. The schools are currently tied
at 7.5 points apiece with only baseball
and men's and women's outdoor
track titles to be decided. "I'm really
excited," Kushner said about the
tight trophy race. "This year, we
havÂ£ a tie. I'm confident we're getting
our point."
"I think we're gonna just crush
them," Leiderman added.

Softball snaps 24-game losing streak

From WOMEN'S FRISBEE, pg. 20
Bucknell and Haverford/Bryn Mawr. The Warmothers
won 13-2 against UPenn and lost 13-9 against Bucknell in
two "very well played games," Alison Landrey 'O4 said.
Against Bucknell, one of the top seeds in the region,
the women easily overshot their goal of scoring four
points and scored more against Bucknell than anyone else
all weekend. Captains Sarah Kates-Chinoy 'O2 and Alyssa
Bell 'O3 played particularly strong games with good teamwork and passing. Saturday's starting lineup was Bell,
Kates-Chinoy, Carolyn Laurenza 'O3, Anna Stratton 'O4,
Courtney Caughey 'O4, Landrey and Marah Gotcsik 'O2.
The Haverford/Bryn Mawr game found the women
tired and overheated, causing a 13-8 loss. "The starting
players were extremely tired and the game looked sloppier," Landrey said. The Sneetches had the advantage with
15 to 20 players on their roster against eleven Swatties.
On Sunday, the Warmothers fought the Carnegie
Mellon/Pitt Pansies (13-5), Penn State Isis (8-13) and had a
rematch against the Sneetches (13-1). Carnegie Mellon was
an easier opponent, which allowed a lot of the rookies to
get more playing time. Abby Lowther 'O2, an important
sub throughout the weekend, played most of the game
against the Pansies. Genevieve DeMessieres 'O4 made
some good grabs in the end zone, and Erin Dwyer-Frazier
'O5 was consistently able to fake out her defender with her
cuts.
The Isis, another team ranked highly in Regionals,
gave the women a chance to play zone defense against
zone offense. According to Landrey, "Our zone offense
totally worked, and that frustrated them, so they changed
their defense later in the game."
The rematch against the Sneetches was a startling
change from the previous game. The Haverford loss could
be partially attributed to the absence of star player Sarah
Hoser 'O2. Stratton played particularly aggressively.
According to Sierra Curtis-McLane 'O2, "She was perpetually diving and hitting the ground."
The weekend showed the team's improvement in oneon-one defense and gave the women a chance to experiment with some new offensive sets.
"The team played the best that it has played this spring
at sectionals; we feel like we are peaking," Curtis-McLane
said. "We have come together as a team."
And just in time, too, as the Warmothers get psyched
for this weekend's Regionals. If they place in the top two,
they will move on to nationals.

'Worms down UPenn
to win Sectionals title
From EARTHWORMS, pg. 20

looked

grim for the 'Worms. After the pull, they worked
the disc up the field and tied the game at 16. With the previously established hardcap next point would win, and
the Void had possession.
The Void made the wise decision to get the disc to
superstar Jared Inselmann, who had been breaking up
Earthworms' plays all day. The Void sent up a long huck to
Inselmann, who was marked by Slezak. The two jump for
the disc, and instead of swatting the disc down, Slezak
grabbed the disc to give Swarthmore possession. The
'Worms then set up their "ho-stack" offensive play, and
Slezak passed the disc to Hagan, who sent it up to Andrew
Rosskamm 'O4 for the game winner.
"This may well have been the most exciting and greatest
victory in Swat ultimate history. It definitely was for my
short career here," Horowitz said. "People were just so
incredibly fired up to play. Every throw UPenn put up was
contested, every offender cutting in had to deal with an
Earthworm laying out past him, flailing limbs to get the D."
Both Slezak and Silverman credited the support from
the sidelines as a key factor in the win. "I'm proud to be an
Earthworm right now," Silverman said.
With the 17-16 finals win, the Earthworms expect either
the No. 2 or No. 3 seed in this weekend's Metro-East
Regional. The top two finishers will receive bids to the UPA
College Championships in Spokane, Wash., on May 24-26.

The Garnet avoided a winless season Tuesday when they swept Haverford in their final games of the sea-

son. In the first game, Maryann Chambers limited Haverford's offensive production to two runs on three
hits. The Garnet needed just three runs, including Mary Mintel's game-winning RBI single in the fifth, to top
Haverford. In the second game, Mintel also led Swarthmore, going 2-for-3 and scoring three runs in the 6-5
victory. Sam Brody pitched in with two hits and two runs, and Valerie Marone picked up her first win.

Ultimate teams advance to Regionals
Earthworms go undefeated
at tourney to win section,
secure top seed in Regionals
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
knelson2@swarthmore.edu
For the second time in three years, the Earthworms have been crowned
East Penn Sectionals champions. Held at Haverford college this past weekend, the tournament is the precursor to the Metro-East Regional, and the
first step toward a bid to nationals. By winning sectionals, the Earthworms
secured a top bid in the regional tournament to be held at Princeton this
weekend.
On Saturday, the Earthworms went undefeated in pool play, beating
Scranton 13-4, Drexel 11-3 and Lehigh 11-7 before facing the Earthworms B

team.
Holding the top seed heading into Sunday's elimination rounds, the
Earthworms opened up the day with an ugly game against the B team of the
University of Pennsylvania Void.
"The game was just not pretty, on both sides," Misha Horowitz 'O3 said.
"We threw a lot away, and were pretty much just looking forward to the
finals already and not thinking about what we were doing."
Swat pulled it together in the second half to finish UPenn B off 15-7. Next up
was Haverford in the semifinals.
The local rivals had played each other twice this season, and both were
close games, with the "Worms winning 13-8 on March 2, and 10-7 on April 6.
After an unusual alternative to the opening Frisbee flip that featured the

"We fired up our [defense] another notch, and

"Big Gay Mules" of each team, the game opened up with the two teams trading points to bring the score to an even 2-2. It looked like the usual Cobra
Kai-Earthworm game until Swarthmore went on a 13-0 scoring run to take
the game 15-2.
"We were just shutting down all their options and making them throw
it away at high stall counts," Horowitz said. "Our [offense] was pretty
always open with lots of good deep looks."
The sectional final was a repeat grudge match between Swarthmore and
UPenn. After facing each other in the semi-finalround of the Layout Pigout
tourney in late March, the previously victorious Earthworms looked for a
repeat win, while the Void, last year's national qualifier from the region,

The "Worms opened up the points with a Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 grab off a
Brandon Silverman 'O2 doughnut. The Void responded with four quick
points to take the lead 4-1 before the 'Worms fought back to knot the score
at 4-4. The teams traded points until the half, when the Void led with a
slight edge 8-7.
Swarthmore came out of the intermission fired up and took the lead at 108. After an even trade, the score was 11-9 when the Void took control of some
unlucky turnovers and mistimed passes to get within game point, 14-11
"We scored and realized our backs were to the wall," Horowitz said. "We
fired up our [defense] another notch, and came up with some huge plays.''
With UPenn pushing for the game point, the intense defense of
Wulfsberg, Jeremy Slezak 'O2, Dan Schwartz 'O2 and Pat Hagan 'O2 kept the
Void from scoring. After Swarthmore slowly cut the UPenn lead to one.
Horowitz laid out on the disc in a huge defensive play. The team continuesd
