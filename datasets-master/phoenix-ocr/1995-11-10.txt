College Democrats and Conservative
Union Debate Affirmative Action
By Erik Huneke

The College Democrats and Swarthmore Conservative Union hosted a debate over affirmative action on Wednesday evening, with Michael Scott '97,
president of the Amos Peaslee Debate
Society, introducing the speakers.
Janice Gallagher '99, a member of the
College Democrats, began the debate by
noting why affirmative action is still necessary in contemporary society, even

though it was originally instituted by
former President Lyndon B. Johnson to
address racial inequalities in the 19605.
She noted that since the unemployment
rate for African-Americans is twice that
of whites, seventy-five percent of upper
management consists of white males, and
women receive only fifty to seventy-five
percent of the pay men receive for equal
work, being a person of color or a woman
is "not societally neutral".
Gallaghernotes that while affirmative
action is neither intended or able to end
racism, it has and will continue to "expand opportunities for women and minorities." She cited as an example that
the number of African-American craft
workers doubledand thenumber of African-American mangers at AT&T tripled
from 1973 to 1983, largely because of
successful affirmative action programs.
These gains were not as great in the
1980s, whenaffirmative actionprograms
were not implemented as extensively as
before.
The first member of the Swarthmore

Conservative Union to speak was Christian Mikkelson "99, who maintained that
affirmative action offers "no opportunity for justice to be done" because it
applies to groups rather than individuals.
Affirmative action tends to make individual whites pay for the collective past
wrongs of slavery. He could not condone
the creationof an "equitable society even
if we have to be unjust." Mikkelson further criticized affirmativeaction as "only
a change in statistical equity...[which]
does not fix racism and sexism." Instead,
it unnecessarily highlights issues of race
and gender by "preventing a race-blind
society" from existing.
Mikkelson also views affirmative action as something which "takes away
from oppressed groups the ability to
achieve by themselves." Furthermore, it
even hurts other groups such as AsianAmericans, who form thirty-five percent
of the student body at the University of
California but would comprise fifty percent if supposedly lesser-qualified African-Americans and Latinos were not admitted. Mikkelson recommended doing
"nothing" to achieve equity other than
have people be judgedby their own merits.
Vincent Jones '9B of the College
Democrats said, "My opponents are under the impression that racism does not
exist," but he believed that "in our
society...white men have [always] been
given preference." Jones said affirmative action does not mean "you're not
allowedinto jobs because you're white,"
...

but works toward attaining equal opportunities. Jones felt federally mandated
programs were necessary to enhance participation by firms in the private sector.
DamonTaaffe '99 of the Swarthmore
Conservative Union refuted Jones' contention that "blackness" necessarily has
negative connotations in society which
are oftenconnected to people of African
descent. He said that images ofblackness
as evil instead stem from images ofnighttime darkness. He went on to say, "You
don't need affirmative action to ensure
equality" because anti-discrimination
laws allow those whose rights have been
violated to sue.
Taaffe added that programs forcing
firms to hire qualified members of minority groups are not necessary because a
business that refuses to hire them will
hurt itself competitively in the marketplace. He noted the disadvantages of admitting lesser qualified people into
schools and jobs, citing that while 6575% of whites and Asians graduate in
four years, and 40-50% percent ofblacks
admitted "on their own merits" do so,
only eighteen percent of blacks admitted
through affirmative action programs
graduate within five years of matriculating. "Setting[such students] up to fail. ..is
[not] doing them a favor."
Ben Fritz '99 of the College Democrats spoke next, saying the "philosophy
of affirmative action [was that] if injustice addresses groups, justice must also

Feminist Leader Ellie Smeal Speaks on Tough Issues
By Mandara Meyers

Standing behind a, "Feminists are the
majority sign, Ellie Smeal presented a
lecture on Tuesday night entitled, "Visualizing Our Feminist Future."
A leader in women's activism for over
twenty-five years, Ms. Smeal, a former
president of the NationalOrganization of
Women (NOW), is currentlypresident as
well as co-founder of the Feminist Majority, a project which began in 1987.
"Her eyes are constantly on the future
of feminism," Swarthmore's Feminist
Majority PresidentKristinSostowski '97
said.
Smeal began her speech summarizing
some issues currently being debated in
Congress and around the country. According to Smeal, conditions for women's
rights but also human rights have reached
an incredibly deplorable state.
Inparticular, Smeal discussed the legislative bills regarding Medicaid, Medicare, and welfare programs.
If thebill to reform welfare passes, aid
from thefederal government will be completely eliminated. Block grants will be
given tostate governments who will then
control all monetary power, according to
Smeal.
"Not one dimehas to go to poor people
since there are no standards or regulations," Smeal said.
The recommended budget cuts for
Medicaid are potentially an even larger
issue. The proposed thirty percent reduction in Medicaidwould lead to an elimination of $lB2 billion dollars by 2002,
"

according to Smeal. The most obvious
problem is thatpoor people will basically
be denied access to health care. What
many people in this counrtry are not
considering is thatroughly two-thirds of
all current nursing home residents are
also supported by Medicaid, according
to Smeal.
Smeal sees medicare as a similar problem. The bill that Congress is reviewing
supports a $270 billion reduction, twenty
percent of the current budget. In addition, patients' premiums and deductibles
would both double.
"This is what's happening in Washington and it's horrendous," Smeal said.
Smeal next moved on to affirmative
action. "Affirmative action will affect
every woman and every minority," Smeal
said. While there is less of an emphasis
on gender-based affirmativeaction in the
current debate, the largest group aided by
its principles is white women. Although
politicians choose to look more at the
unfair advantages given to minorities,
they neglect to look at the positive influence affirmative action has been for many
white women.
Smeal sees proposals against affirmativeaction as a rationalization tocut back
sex discriminationlaws. If thebill passes,
any excuse whatsoevercould serve as the
basis to discriminate against women. All
of the advances women have made in the
twentieth century due to laws like Title
IX which guarantees girls equality in
school-related activities like athletics
could vanish.
Smeal went on to point out that em-

O'Donnell also hopes to have the automated balance system tellstudents when
the last payment was received; she expects to see this service in operation
within the next forty-five days. To furtherincrease payment convenience, STC
is working hard to make credit cardbilling available. O'Donnell reminded students that STC makes no commission on
long-distance bills; STC is simply paid a
fee at thebeginning of the school yearfor
their services.
Another concern raised at the meeting
included how a student could make tollfree 800 number calls when his or her
PIN has been turned-off. Dumic agreed
to see if it wouldbe possible to allow 800
number calls to be completed without
requiring an authorization code.
Finally, some students inquired
whether or not the College was in compliance with theFederal Communication
Commission's Equal Access Order. Particularly, students questioned accessibility to long-distance rates, information
about the long-distance carrier, and lastly
to where students could complain if they
were unhappy with the College's telecommunication service.Dumic statedthat
it was his understanding that the College
was in compliance with all applicable
laws regarding telecommunications.

ployment has become a sad game and
some politicians are playing therace card
as a scapegoat. Similar to children playing a game of musical chairs, the unemployed are forced to push and shove and
"run around like maniacs" searching for
ways to support themselves as well as
their families.
We need to stop having an unemployment system that makes losers out ofreal
humans, according to Smeal, and start
learning to share. She suggested that
America take a serious look at alternative
solutions to unemployment like turning
to a four-day work week or a six-hour

male and above the age of fifty-five.
Smeal proposed the idea that decisionmakers should be representative of the
UnitedStates on thebasis ofage, sex, and

She insisted that, "We must dream,

to make our political democracy more of

last two years, students were underbilled
for long-distance telephone service. Several students complained about the lack
of access to telephone rate information;
Dumic and Mr. O'Donnell both agreed
that rate information would be more
readily available in the near future. One
student commented that shehad "experienced long-distance rate increases of
approximately 50-75 percent"
Next, Carolyn O'Donnell responded
to many concerns regarding billing. She
explained that when a student reaches
75% of his or her preset long-distance
limit, STC sends out a letter informing
the student that he or she is approaching
the limit. When a student goes over the
limit, a second letter is sent urging the
student to send a check to reduce the
account balance. If, however, no payment is received within six days, STC
will most often turn off the student's
long-distance PIN.
Several students raised the point that
there may be too few days allowed by
STC between the time the billing notification letters are mailed from STC's
Allentown office to the time it takes for
students to be able torespond. O'Donnell
stated that she hopes to be able to send
such notification letters via e-mail by

Administrators Weigh Pros
and Cons of New Software

CEP Ponders Future of

Astronomy Department
By Tony Sturm
The Council on Educational Policy
(CEP) is currently determining the fate
of the Astronomy program at Swarthmore.

The impending retirement of Professor WulffHeintz has made this a particularly pertinent issue this semester. The
CEP is closely examining what to do
with Heintz's vacated position, as well as
the future of the Astronomy department
itself.
When a professor retires or leaves his
or her position, the CEP evaluates what
should be done to fill that spot Usually,
the department in which the professor
worked is allowed to hire a replacement.
Occasionally, the position is transferred
to another department.
Heintz's anticipated retirement leaves
the CEP to decidehow to fill his position.
The Astronomy program has found itself
under particular scrutiny for a number of
reasons. Most glaringly, there are cur-

Astronomy to form one department.
Regarding the merger, "Astronomy is a
scientific field distinct from the other
sciences. The fact that it is in the same
department as physics is more an administrative convenience then a disciplinary
connection, although its links to physics

rently only two Astronomy professors,
and after Professor Heintz departs, only

on

Professor John Gaustad will remain.
Furthermore, the Astronomy program
itself is not large, offering only five
courses. Forty-three students are taking
Introduction to Astronomy, but few stay
on to take higher level classes. In fact, in
thepast ten years, there has beenonly one
student who majored in Astronomy.

In addition, graduate schools in

as-

tronomy throughout the country do not

require their students to have a background in the subject, so the loss of an
astronomy major wouldnot limit a S warthmore student's ability to pursue astronomy after Swarthmore.
Another factor that weighs against
Astronomy is the problem of equipment
becoming obsolete, as well as the expense of updating it. The overall cost,
however, is not prohibitive. Taking into
consideration the number of students
enrolled and the number of astronomy
faculty, "the costs [of the astronomy program] are in proportion to those of the
othernatural science programs," according to Professor of Physics Peter Collings.
There are also arguments for keeping
the program intact and strong. 'lt is an
area which intellectually, some of the
most exciting questions are being asked,"
Provost Jennie Keith said. "Some people
findit theideal science to have at a liberal
arts college."

Collings said, "Astronomy, at this
point, is a science that is in fact tackling
such questions as the origin of the
universe...lt has good connections to other
sciences; besides the apparent connection with physics, it has significant ties to
mathematics and chemistry."
Astronomy has had a distinguished
history as a program at Swarthmore.The
first Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy was Dr. Susan J. Cunningham,
who taught at Swarthmore from 1869
until 1906. She established a small observatory in What is now called the
Cunningham house. Sproul Observatory

are strong," Collings said.
There is some degree of affinity between the two disciplines. Two juniors

have recently declared themselves Astrophysics special majors.
The CEP, made up of students and
faculty, has been listening to different
viewpoints on the topic. The review is in
its early stages, as different possibilities
have been presented, but no decisions
have been reached.

Frank Yu '97, one of the two students
the committee, said, "Because of divergent views, we feel that we need to
listen to all differentperspectives before
we make a decision that would be the
most beneficial to the entireSwarthmore
community...People we have listened to
include the two astronomy professors
and the department chair. In addition, the
division chairs are also invited to come to
the meeting."
Future possibilities range from the
outright disintegration of the program to
making no changes at all, and refilling
Heintz's position with a new astronomy
professor. Both Collings and Gaustad
prefer the latter option.
Other options include simply reducing
the professorial staff to a lone professor,
or "hiring a physics teacher who can
teach Introduction to Astronomy" noted
Omar Mencin '97, the other student on
CEP.
Gaustad said, "It would make no sense
to maintain an entire department with
only one faculty member." Yu said having one professor in a department "could
beharmful. There would be no colleagues
to confer with, and no collaboration would
be possible" within the program.
In the near future, there is no danger of
the Astronomy program dissolving. This
process of reevaluation is campus-wide,
as every department will be looked at in
terms of long range plans over the next
two years. "I don't feel that we're under
attack in any way," said Gaustad. "It's
just part of the normalreview process."
Said Keith, "I'm starting with CEP to
look ahead to see where we are going to
be as a college ten years from now." The
Astronomy/Physics department and the
Modem Languages department are the
first two to come under scrutiny, since
both departments are requesting additional positions.
"It's part of a long process that is going
to go on, we expect, for two years,"Keith
said of the evaluations. "We don'tknow
what the outcome is going to be at this
time."

Swatties Participated in
Japanese Tea Ceremony
By Erica Turner

Students who attended the Japanese
Tea Ceremony Thursday, November 2,
learned more than just how to pour tea;
they experienced a cultural philosophy.
The tea ceremony is guided by the
philosophy that, "people can or should
find beauty out of simplicity," organizer
and Chair of the Cultural Grants Committee of the Swarthmore Asian Organization Tsuyoshi Mitarai '9B said.
Approximately one hundred people
showedup to see JapaneseTea Ceremony
teacher Taeko Sharvin perform the ceremony at 7 PM and at 8 PM in Parrish
Parlours.
The tea ceremony served as a real-life
learning experience. "I wanted theSwarthmore community to experience actual
Asian cultures," Mitarai said.
"People in the United States communicate by talking, but in Japan we talk by
silence. You don't say too much, but you
feel it, you get lots from silence," Mitarai
said.
SpectatorThomas Ta '96 also noticed
a contrast between the emphasis of Japanese culture of the tea ceremony and
Western culture.
"[The tea ceremony] focuses a lot on
the need for community over individuality in the sense of politeness, as opposed
to Western culture," Ta said.
"It was kind of unfathomable to me
that people would delve into such deep
detail of the ceremony," spectator Frank

Yu '97 said. "I questioned my own perspective of looking at the world in a
macro sense. It showed me the beauty of
the details."
There are some similarities the audience may havenoticed between the Japanese philosophy and Quaker philosophy.
"Its [tea ceremony is] very similar to
[the] Quaker ceremony in that it has
some of the same philosophy that we can
find beauty in simplicity.," Mitarai said.
"Wa,""kei,""sei," and "jaku" are other
elementsof Japanesephilosophy that are
reflected in the tea ceremony.
"Wa" means harmony. The tea ceremony emphasizesharmony between the
people in the ceremony and the season,
according to Mitarai. "For example, we
will have something simple representing
fall in theroom, like leaves," Mitari said.
"Ku" means respect Participants in
the ceremony give respect to the host,
themselves, and the tea equipment.
Part of givingrespect involves cleanliness, which is the meaning of the word
"sei." When they wipe off their equipment, they wipe off the dirty part of
themselves," Mitarai said.
Finally, "jaku" is the attempt to achieve
a state of calmness. Participants try to
"have a spiritual moment" and not to
have "any negative feelings," Mitarai
said.
"We talk about Japan, about trading
policy, all the time, but we don't really
understand the culture," Ta said. The tea
ceremony helped bridge this cultural gap.

"As with any implementation of any
new software, there have been bugs that
have to be worked out," Warner said.
Difficulty getting Banner to produce adequate output, such as statistical summaries, appeared to be the most serious
problem. However, Robin Jacobsen, User
Services Manager at Swarthmore's computing center, said a planning group here
is already seeking solutions. "We have
known that the report-writing functionality is not working," she said.

Under the supervision of Franklin
Rubinstein '97 and Joe Goodman '97,
the term "book sale" will take a new
twist Flipping through a used textbook
to decide whether or not to buy it will be
a thing of yesterday.
Instead of having table after table filled
with books, and student after student
lining up to look at them, the book sale
will be conducted from the shopper's
own computer. Students who wish to sell
their textbooks will contact Rubinstein
and Goodman and have their names, email addresses and numbers placed on a
list.
The list will be posted in the library
where students can see which books are
available. "People will e-mail us the books

apply to groups." This is particularly

in a society which Fritz believed was anything but a meritocracy,
since there can be no "culturally neutral
standard of merit" in a system "set up
only to take into account [the needs of]
white males."
Fritz said "society wouldnot be colorblind without affirmative action," and
that affirmative action must remain in
place because of the different educational and other opportunities which society continues to deny to some of its
members. He concluded by nothing that
whiletoday's "white men arenotresponsible for past discrimination,...they benefit from it" nevertheless.
Justin Herring '97 of the Swarthmore
Conservative Union made the last presentation, refuting Fritz's claim that
Asians were not being discriminated
against by affirmativeactionpolicies such
as those at Berkeley. He refuted the nonecessary

tion that white males benefit to such a
great extent from our present society by
noting that Japanese Americans are the
wealthiest and most highly educated
group in the country. While admitting the
existence of a long legacy of discrimination against groups, affirmative action
"destroys theindividualdistinctionsupon
which justice rests."
Herring called into question the real
effect of companies hiring more minorities simply for the sake of increasing
their representation, maintaining that
many of them were stuck in "dead-end
jobs." Realizing that it is not a person's
"fault" for being less qualified, the person still does not benefit by being elevated to positions beyond his/her ability. Herring closed by saying the government should not mandate affirmative action because "there is no such thing as
[the] group debt" which its programs
ostensibly aim to address.
The debate concluded with a lively
question and-answer session.

they would like to sell," Rubinstein said.
"Joe and I will compile a master list of all
the books that are to be sold, and group
them by subject."
If someone needs a certain book, they
will be able to look at the list and then
contact the student who is selling what
they want. However, as neat as it sounds,
the plan is not without its share of snags.
At the top of the list of problems is how
to keep the list updated so that students
will know which books have been sold
and which are still available. "I'm not too
sure how we are going to keep the list
current," Rubinstein admitted.
But the problem is not without a possible solution. "Maybe we'llhave people
e-mail us once they've sold their books
so that we can cross them off the list.
Perhaps people can just cross themselves
off the list They'll have an incentive to
cross themselves off to avoid getting
phone calls they don't want."

College Hosts North Korean
Delegation in Kirby
A delegation of three North Korean
diplomats spoke about their desire for
Korean reunification in Kirby Lecture
Hall yesterday afternoon, in the first stop
of a rare visit to the US.
The North Koreans represented The
Korean Committee for Solidarity with
the World's People (KCSWP) of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
"technically a non-governmental organization, but highly connected with the
party," said Professor of History Lillian
Li, who moderatedthe Kirby discussion.
Ho Sop, head of the delegation and the
Vice-Chairof the KCSWP, Dong Kyong
Choi, his translator, and Ryu Kil Ung,
were "visiting in a semi-official capacity," said Li, "but the decision to authorize this visit and the composition of the

Debate...from page 1

Students and faculty at Bryn Mawr felt
disconnected from the world Wednesday when the school's eletronic mail
system temporarily stoppped working.
The outage resulted from an offensive
message allegedly originating from
four students at Cornell.
The message, emitted "75 reasons why
women (bitches)should be denied freedom of speech," was received by several Bryn Mawr students who then
forwarded it to other members of the
community. As the mail circulated
from students to students, it reached
larger audiences with each successive
generation. The college's mail spool
was increasing exponentially by the
time Academic Computing was notified of the message by a student. The
office decided to halt allmail service at
about II AM.

to make sure that only tri-college students enter parties, to make sure thatfood

them, and to maintain general order and

Responsibility for observance of rules

with the hosts of the party.
Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie, who is

over the years is that our party guidelines
have gotten very lax in terms of their

careful about it and they really would

So the PAs are a way of ensuring awareness of what the policy is and why the

Ho also said that reunification of Korea must be combined with the establishment of relations between North Korea
and the US because a "moderator should
be in a fair position. It is a pressure to ask
two sides for a dialogue while supporting
one and opposing the other."
Ho said that talks between North and
South Korea were made more difficultby
the fact that "[w]hen our great leader
Kim II Sung passed away, ...SouthKorea
didn't even send condolence
messages...and they prevented South
Koreans from coming to the North to
express their condolences."He said that
an apology for this would be necessary
before reunification would be possible.
This speech was followed by remarks
fromProfessorof Political Science James
Kurth and Professor ofEconomics Larry
Westphal. Kurth asked whether it would,
be possible for one country to have two
armies, and whether people, capital, and
goods would be allowed to move freely
within the proposed Korean confedera-

tion.

Westphal spoke about the "economic
miracles" of both North and South Korea, and asked about the current situation
of the NorthKorean economy, after the
disruption in its trade with other formerly
Communist countries.
Ho responded that"We should have a
house first and then we will sit together
and solve these problems one by one."
Rapproachment between China and
the US began with visiting groups similar to this one, Li said in an interview on
Tuesday. In the early history of thatrelationship, the American Friends Service
Committee played a similar role to the
role they played in arranging this visit
and discussion, and every such event was
considered very important. "At that time,
China was almost as isolated as North
Korea is today," Li said.
"The very fact of this visit is extremely significant. There have been very
few contacts between NorthKoreans and
Americans at any level, particularly in
the US. NorthKoreans at the UN mission
are restricted in travel to 25 miles ofNew
York City. Travel to other parts of the US
is very significant" Li said.
This delegation will visit Washington
DC and Seattle before its return to North
Korea.
At the Kirby discussion, Giridhar
Srinivasan '9B asked about the possibility of voting on an ideology to govern a
unified Korea, rather than having a country with two separate governments. The
delegation replied that the elected leaders of South Korean have admitted to
corruption, and raised doubts about
whether such an election could "take
place in a proper way." Furthermore,
they said, "We can solve this election

Another student asked, "Is it possible
thatreunification is no longer possible?"
The delegation replied that those who
oppose reunification focus more on the
differences between the Koreas than on
their commonalities, and that tens of
millions of Koreans care less about ideology than about nationality.
The delegation was asked if the North
Korean view ofreunification with South
Korea has changed at all since the death
of Kim II Sung. "Nothing will change,"
they replied. "We celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of theKorean Workers Party
on October tenth. Our great Leader Kim
Jung II presented a paper which said that
our party will foreverbe theparty of Kim
II Sung. Its essence is that we will follow
exactly the same road."
Jude Uzonwanne '9B asked if there
was any possibility of internal political
change in North Korea which might
weaken the power of the Communist
party. "Any idealike that is a distortion,"
replied Ho. "Such distortions are created
by those who oppose us. It's nonsense."

The Phoenix

OPINIONS
Column Induced by PC Brainwashing

Phoenix Editorial

By Chuck Stevens

The Phoenix Acted Responsibly by Printing Young America's Opinion
There's no question that the flavor of this week's
letter drop is last week's article by the Young
America's Foundation on multicultural curriculums. While we generally disagreed with the
article's content, we felt it was neither appropriate
nor necessary to print an editorial expressing our
view. We thought it better to allow the Swarthmore community torespond with its own reaction
to the article, as it clearly did in this issue.
Since thepiece directly attacked the content of
Swarthmore courses, we anticipated that a tender
spot with professors would be touched. Not surprisingly, the majority of the response we've
received have been from faculty. We are a bit
taken aback, however, by the tone of some of the
responses.
Professor Timothy Burke begins his attack on
Young America by firing a torpedo at The Phoenix. "What I found most troubling about thepiece,"
he writes, "was that the editorsof theThe Phoenix
chose to run an anonymous article under the
byline of"The Young America's Foundation'... It
strikes me as somewhat irresponsible of the Phoenix editors to run an article whichis so vague in its
authorship and so gaseous in providing support
for its claims."
First Professor Burke criticizes us for running
an article that does not list an individual author or
authors. We did not do this in an effort to avoid
controversy or protect someone's identity. The
Young America's Foundation contacted us and
asked us to run their article about course curriculums in America's colleges. Their article did not
include the name of one author, so we simply
credited the article "By the Young America's
Foundation." What is thedifference?Would ProfessorBurke have preferred that we demanded the
actual names of the authors from the group so the
article could read "By John Q. Conservative and
Mary D. Republican?" Professor Pieter Judson
writes, "I can only hope that the anonymous
article was not actually written by a Swarthmore
student." Don't worry, Prof, it wasn't. It was
written, as we clearly indicated, by an off-campus
organization.
Perhaps Professor Burke is concerned because
we printed a submission from someone outside
the college community. It has never been our
policy, however, to deny publication to material
writtenby outside authors, particularly when that
material has to do with Swarthmore. The article
directly mentioned Swarthmore, clearand simple.
Wefelt this was relevant, therefore we printed the
piece.
Professor Burke's other complaint is that we
printed an article that is "gaseous in providing
support for its claims" which are based on "alleged sentiments of unnamed Swarthmore students."
Our commitment to facts and accuracy remains
strong as ever in our news and sports articles, our
feature stories, and our Editorial (which repre-

Phoenix Opinion Poll

a consensus of the Phoenix editors). Submissions in our Opinions sections, however, express the views of individualauthors only, and if
inaccuracies and misrepresentations exist, they
are to be attributed to those authors, and not the
Phoenix. We will not make it our policy to water
down Opinions submissions, no matter how "gaseous" we may find them, in order to make them
conform to our views. We can express our own
voice in the Editorial. The rest of the space is for
everyone in the Swarthmore community to say
what they want. And unless we are specifically
singled out, we will leave it to the Swarthmore
community to respond.
In his satirical, and largely on-target letter.
Professor Peter Schmidt of the English Department quips "I would like to thank the Phoenix for
doing the public service of printing a critique by
the" Young America's Foundation'... It shouldbe
particularly useful for students who believe that
you can evaluate the intellectual content of a
course by examining a list of its readings or
whether or not certain bad words like "race' or
"gender' appear in the course description."
At the risk of sounding immodest, we do believethat we were doing, in some sense "a public
service" by printing the article. Sure, we could
have looked at the arguments and discarded them
along with the article, but then no one would ever
know about the criticism out there. Whether or not
we like it, the fact is that our name was used an
example by the Young America's Foundation of
what's wrong in America's colleges. If we hadn't
printed the article, how many of our readers would
know that theFoundation was sending out information poking fun at our curriculum? The entire
purpose of our Opinions section is to promote an
exchange of ideas. If we did not run last week's
article, the disgruntled professors would not have
had a forum in which to defend themselves.
We are happy to see thatmembers of the faculty
are reading The Phoenix and that they feel involved enough to respond at times. However, we
sorely wish that their level ofinterest was higher.
All semester we've been advertising a feature
entitled "Faculty/Staff Viewpoint" in which faculty, staff, deans and members of the administration are welcome to express their views to the
Swarthmore community.
After nine issues, despite solicitation through
all-faculty and personal e-mails, we've only received three submissions. We really had wished
that some other professors in addition to Dean
Fernando Chang-Muy and Professors Carr
Everbach and Tim Williams were interested
enough to take some time out and write in their
students' newspaper. After all, when we run into
a surplus of material we have to start cutting
articles. If Professor Judson had done us the public service of writing an eloquent piece on his
memories of Swarthmore and Professor Burke
had collected his sentiments in a bold piece oh
race relations. Young America's article might not
have made the cut last week.

Which class should not be
guaranteed housing?

Your columnist, in all honesty, feels a little silly
for writing this column. It isn't that he thinks the
topic is silly (although Lord knows it can be in
hands more skilled than your columnist's), or that
the Young America's Foundation is by its very
nature silly (although he does sometimes think
that its time might be better spent, oh, raking
leaves or something); it's just that this column
resembles some intrepid soul getting up at an
Earth First meeting and observing that, "Gee,
fellas, I kinda think we oughta try to preserve the
environment." Your columnist likes to feel that,
justpossibly, something he writes might upset the
proverbial apple cart in one way or another, and
let's just say that a column defending
multiculturalism at Swarthmore does not quite
qualify as a boat-rocker. Nevertheless, the November 3rd Phoenix article entitled "PC Courses
Reflect Decay in Education" drawshis fire, partly
for its argument and partly for the assumptions it
makes about what constitutes quality education.
(Okay, okay, you're right—it also gives him a
chance to be sarcastic and make fun of some
conservatives. He shan't elaborate as to which
factor influenced him the most)
Though the article purports to demonstrate(in
less than a thousand words; your columnist is
impressed) the takeover of higher education by
the politically motivated, its message is impeded
by the tone, which evokes second-grade taunts.
Calling a course a "three-month belly-aching session" may make the YAF feel cool, but it does
little to advance their argument and irritates the
academicians it supposedly seeks to educate.
Whatever validity the argument might have is
well-nigh forfeited by the sneer implicit in the
tone, and whatever good it might have done as a
message to educators is undone by the self-righteousness of its dismissal of "what masquerades
as scholarship in academia."
Where to start? Take the first sentence: "With
the average annual cost of college hovering above
$ 16,000,parents and students may be interested in
what kind of education their money is buying."
Let's see now. Presumably, students nowadays
can figure out what kind ofeducation theirmoney
is buying, since they actually takeclasses (though
it sure is nice of the Young America'sFoundation
to offer to inform them.) Parents may well be
interested in learning what tuition money buys
nowadays, but then again, they can probably find
out by simply asking their child what courses
they 're taking. ("Gosh, Marge. Wonder what little
Johnny's studying at college." "I don't know,
Homer. Let's ask the Young America's Foundation.") Since when is that group, by dint of flipping through college catalogs and smacking its
collective forehead, an instant expert on higher
education?
The premise of the article seems to be that
innocent students are subjected against their will
to a battery of courses that force them to think
about race, gender, class, and sexual orienta-

tion—the "regime" of political

correctness

I would like to thank thePhoenix for doing the
public service of printing a critique by the "Young
America's Foundation" of the curriculum in various American institutions of higher learning, including Swarthmore (The Phoenix, Nov. 3,1995,
p. 3). It should be particularly useful for students
who believe that you can evaluate the intellectual
content of a course by examining a list of its

One of the reasons I'm so dubious about the
article is its treatment of History 1: The Historical
Construction of Identity, which I have taught the
last two years. I can't help butfeel that the author

tary academies ("Johnson! You worthless essen-

tialist!"), but apparently the folks at the YAF feel
it's quite a problem that history majors have to

"examine the perspectives of historical identity
based on ethnicity, race, nation, gender, and sexu-

ality." (Your columnist can just hear it: "Dang it,
in my day we memorized dates and treaties, and
they should be doing it too.") Might this stuff—understanding history as it was actually lived—be
even the tiniest bit relevant? Not according to the
YAF—and remember, these are some knowledgeable folks. That "every Ivy League college"
except dear old Princeton "offers more undergraduate courses in women's studies than in economics" is taken as the final nail in academia's
coffin. That, presumably, more students are studying women's studies than economics (supply and
demand, you know—wink wink, nudge nudge)
does not seem to have made the YAFradar screen.
The argument is reinforced by a listing of a few of
the especially shocking Swarthmore courses, including—your columnist's favorite—"Women
and Peace." Whoa.There goes the neighborhood.
The English major in your columnist was especially amused by the revelation that 40% of the
description of Swarthmore English lit courses
"show a preoccupation" with race, gender, class,
and sexual orientation, which made him wonder if
the folks at the YAF have ever read any—what do
they call them? Oh, yes—books.
Your columnist will do the Young Americans
one better; he'll bet thatdarn near every course in
the English department at Swarthmore (and elsewhere) deals in some fashion with one or more of
these issues. Once literature gets past the Dickand-Jane level (draw your own conclusions about
the YAF), those things tend to come up a lot.
Hence the sobering truth that, at Washington &
Lee, "even courses which appear to be traditional
are also dominated by racial, sexual, and gender
issues"; your columnist can just imagine the subversive stuff they had to read. Things like Othello,
JaneEyre, Anna Karenina. Those multiculturalists
are out of control.
Why is this so important? Because "education
is used...as a means for altering students' fundamental beliefs about society." That assumes both
that students come in with "fundamentalbeliefs"
that differ significantly from those of academia
("you know, Cindy, I took this women's studies
course because I care so much about the traditional family, but now my beliefs are changing")
and thatprofessors expect students to tamely buy
every word they read. Neither assumption is even
remotely valid. Students may be forced to think
about these issues, but your columnist defies any
student at Swarthmore to say that she has been
forced into one particular view of them. All this
babble leads to the assertion that degrees from
elite schools are not "always tantamount to the
best in education"; what "best in education" is
supposed to mean is less than clear to your columnist, but clearly it's something other than

mult icultural ism. This melancholy state ofaffairs

is true at "nearly all schools," and somehow graduates of these benighted institutions are shortchanged on the job market—turns out that "employers are not knocking downtheir doors." So no
one wants to hire college graduates, so they hire,

urn, people with less education. Question: do
employers really prefer to hire folks with only a
high school diploma, or is the wholearticle simply
vacuous rhetoric?

Furthermore, who on earth does the Young
America's Foundation think it is? What fountain
of wisdom enables it to decide that some schools
"have maintained their commitment to quality
instruction" while theresthave abandoned education for political indoctrination? What surpassing
knowledge allows it to determine that hearing
about race or gender in the classroom is incompatible with real learning? Your columnist resents
the implication that reading twenty-six course
catalogs makes one an expert ineducational theory,
and suggests that education, properly assessed,
grants a student experience in reading material
and forrmulating arguments, a capacity for rea-

"Who on earth does the
Young America's Foundation think it is?.. .What

learning?"
soning, rather than some arbitrary string of facts.
Measured on the latter scale, most major universities may wellbe deficient, but here in the twentieth century (come visit us sometime!), these
other abilities matter more than any particular bit
of knowledge.
There are assuredly numerous absurdities in
academia today; your columnist encounters them
daily. He wouldn't feel so silly writing this column if the general college mindset weren't overwhelmingly politically correct. But it seems less
than intelligent to forgo a college education because there are courses like "Lesbian Representation". If you don't want to take it, you don't, and
if the school you're thinking of attending has core
requirements including it, you don't go there. Is
that so hard? The arrogance of dismissing the
bulk of higher education in one airy wave of the
hand leaves your columnist less than persuaded.
The Young America's Foundation is hereby advised to confine itself to funding conservative
speakers, rather than pontificating on the state of
institutions of which it has little knowledge and
less understanding.

Faculty Responses to the Young Americas Foundation
I had some problems with the article "PC
Courses Reflect Decay in Education", which appeared on page 3 of the November 3 issue of The
Phoenix This is perhaps not surprising since I
teach one of the classes mentioned as objectionable by the article. First things first, however:
what I found most troubling about the piece was
that the editors of the Phoenix chose to run an
anonymous article under thebyline of"The Young
America's Foundation". Nor does the anonymity
end at the byline: the article bases many of its
claims on the alleged sentiments of unnamed
Swarthmore students. There's no way of telling
from the article how (or if) the authors collected
such sentiments or how representative these feelings are. When the anonymous authors say "stu-

Sorry guys, but the joke
"Young America's Foundation." Anyone who
can read a syllabus, (and that might just be their
problem!), knows that History 1 holds up the
modern concept of identity to rigorous critique,
based on a close reading of texts from a variety of
historical periods.
Far from becoming an orgy of "PC" (and I'm
not entirely clear from the article just what that
means), the course teaches students precisely to
AVOID reading back contemporary appear to be
its opposite. The author made utterly unverified
claims about students who have taken the course.
(We've had studentsofall political persuasions in

bitually fantasize about, because their shoddy
research methods and half-baked rhetoric probably would earn them big fat F's from the stern
John Houseman-type White Males who supposedly would be upholding standards at such institutions.
I really hope there isn't a student who saw
History 1 as nothing more than a "belly-aching"
session in which "victim groups led by the professor lament their historical treatment at the hands
of white Christian civilization". If there is, I really
would like to hear from that student, because
we've fallen really short of our goals for the
course. We'd honestly like to know if that's the
case. This description is about as far away from
our hopes and aspirations for the course as I could
possibly imagine. Indeed, one of our basic goals is
to get students to use history to critically re-think
the very idea of "identity politics". We want to
underline how complex identity actually is, to
confound any idea that there is any simple historical calculus to be done of winners and losers,
victimizers and victimized.
For example, in studying the interaction of
Puritans and Native Americans in early colonial
New England in this year's version of History 1,
we deliberately chose to emphasize captivity narratives. These narratives make it clear that you
cannot understand this particular historical moment as a simple instance of evil whites versus
noble Indians, that power flowed in many directions in early colonial society, that identity was
profoundly mutable and ambivalent in this place
and time. So as far as I can tell, whoever wrote the
article doesn't really have much sense of the class
he or she sets out to criticize.
Nor am I clear on what the author really wants
from a liberal arts curriculum. On one hand, the

author seems to have a fundamentalproblem with
any course that deals with race, class, gender,

sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality or any
other form of identity. At least as far as the History
Department goes, I confess I'm utterly puzzled as
to what would be left if we were not dealing with
such issues.
Moreover, given that all of these issues have
informed a massive preponderance of the writing
and teaching of history in the United States for
most of the last century, I suppose I am rather
confused about what the author takes to be a
model past curriculum in need of resurrection.
In the author's ideal curriculum, an American
history class, I assume, would have to avoid
inconveniently "multicultural" topics that touch
on race, gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity and
nationality like theCivil War, immigration. Western expansion, American foreign policy, and the
civil rights movement, while world history courses
would of course need to avoid therise of theWest,
the Adantic slave trade, the Crusades, World War
11, and the histories of Asia, Latin America and
Africa.
What I find even more interesting is that the
writer finds the proposition thatthe use of education as a "tool to enlighten young minds" is
somehow diametrically opposed to education "altering students' fundamental beliefs about society." Let me get this straight The author favors
enlightenment as long as "enlightenment" doesn't
change anyone's mind about anything. Kind of a
weird sort of liberal arts education, isn't it?
It isn't just the author's name and facts that
seem fuzzy in this article, it's his or her entire

That way students can receive instant answers

things are not as stagnant as you migh

to dig deeper these days to find the
true talent This past week I have
been to two shows andfound some of
thattalent.One has already blossomed
into a fine musical group, while the
other has great potential, but has not

quite reached the point of accomplishment. The former is the "country-grunge" group, The GeraldineFibbers, while the latter is up-and-coming artist Ben Harper.
The Geraldine Fibbers have accomplished what so many other bands
have attempted unsuccessfully: they
have created music in a style truly
their own. This five-piece out of Los
Angeles started out as a club band
doing country covers. While there is
some country influence discernible in
the songs found on the new album.
Lost Somewhere Between the Earth
and My Home (Virgin), countryphobes have nothing to worry about.
The soundofThe GeraldineFibbers is on
the cutting edge of modemrock.
Saturday night, in an interviewbefore
the show with the band's lead singer,
Carlaßozulich, and their drummer, Kevin
Fitzgerald, I got to ask a few questions.
Of course, before I could continue I had
to ask about the name. The Geraldine
Fibbers. "Well, we tried to come up with
the stupidest possible name we could
think of," said Kevin. Ah, deep. I then
asked Car]a how they changed from doing straight country to this louder, hardedged music. Her response: "Well, after
a while I realized there just was not
enough screaming in country music."
This down-to-earth attitude was very
refreshing. They even told some funny
stories. "We once played this morning
talk show. The host talkedabout the way
we used to get together and play on Tuesday nights. He then said, 'I assume, then,
that one ofyour big influences is Sheryl
Crow?' He was referring only to the
name ofher album, TuesdayNight Music

power I hadn't seen in some time.
As for the album. Lost Somewhere

Between the Earth and My Home (pictured above), it is an impressive feat. As
I listened carefully, I found myself humming some of the melodies later in the
day and almost being hauntedby some of
its odder songs. It is a fine, fine album
and one of the best releases I have heard
from a new band in quite some time.
After spending a long time opening for
PJ Harvey, Ben Harper is now on a tour
of his own. Scheduled to promote his
second album. Fight For YourMind (also
Virgin), this tour brought Harper to The
Middle East club Tuesday night for an
entertaining, yet ultimately unfulfilling
show.
Ben Harper has made a name for himself by playing a terrific slide-acoustic
guitar, having a wonderful band, and
putting on some terrific shows complete
with off-the-wall guitar solos and extended percussion montages. It is for
these reasons that I enjoyed the show.

If it weren't for bad luck
The most disturbing part was when
one of Rabin's aides pulled out the piece
ofpaper that had been in Rabin's pocket
when he was shot. It was covered in
blood and contained the lyrics to the
peace song he sang right before he was
assassinated. Tough to see... we watched
him sing that and joked about how bad
his voice was... we left right after he
finished. Thank God we left when we
did... I can't even imagine if we had

stayed.

supposedly being more used to violence.
I don'tknow if that's true...yes, I grew up
learning about the assassinations of
American political figures and I
remember when Reagan was shot. As I
told my apartment-mate, however, that
doesn't mean that this couldever become
routine... she was an officer in the army,
and from an American perspective it
seems that she would be the one more
accustomed to violence. I think we both
realized thatthisis shocking and sickening
for everyone... Nothing could have ever
prepared me for what I heard Saturday
night. I am not a citizen of this country,
but at this point I am a member of the
Israeli community, and, as an Israeli friend
described it, this is apunch in thestomach.
Regardless, I am very glad to be in Israel
for this. I wonder how it would be to hear
this in the states and how I would have
reacted. My father said he cried as he
read the paper yesterday morning, it's
exactly what I was talking to my
roommate about and exactly why
everyone was crying during Noa' s speech.

Later on in the evening came the show
itself. The GeraldineFibbers' live sound
was truly impressive. The band, in addition to a lead guitar. Carta's guitar work,
and drums, has a violinist and a stand-up
double-bass player. Not a typical mosh
band, the Geraldine Fibbers exuded a

Like a cop on the last doughnut,

can break your deep
concentration. You don't even
fear what the future has to offer.
At the same time, you can't
seem to let go of what has
passed. Do yourself a favor:
realize that what is done
is done. Gearing your
mind of things gone by
will keep you from
becoming socially inept.

Yet, in the end I found myself let
down. A large part of this has to do with
the dichotomy between Ben Harper live,
and Ben Harper on disc. His album.
Fight For Your Mind, has a couple of
good songs, but for the most part operates more as uneventful background
music. Trying to listen carefully to this
album honestly left me bored at times.
This is now even more frustrating
since he puts on a good live show and
is truly talented.
Why is his album so disappointing? Well, the songs do not stand out
as strong, well-crafted works. They
are often all in the same key and
consist of the same chords repeated
over and over again. Lyrically, Harper
also has problems. Rather than explaining this problem, I will show it
by comparing Harper's lyrics to those
of the Geraldine Fibbers. Here are
some lyrics by the GeraldineFibbers:
"I emptied out your bag of toys, and
let them spin their web, but oddly as I
watch them turn, my love begins to
ebb." Now, here are some lyrics by
Ben Harper: "If you're gonna live
than live it up and if you're gonna
give then give it up."
When I played the Ben Harper album for my roommates and friends,
their reaction was always, "It's 0.K., but
it's nothing special." Ultimately, this is
where I stand. Ben Harper is a very
talented man. He has soul, he has the
technical talent, and hehas the ambition.
As of yet, however, he has yet to prove
himself as a strong songwriter and this
will prove to be a big obstacle to his
success.
The Geraldine Fibbers, however, are a
different story. Lyrically strong,
musically varied, and, most importantly,
original, the GeraldineFibbers are one of
the most important bands to emerge in
recent memory. Their music is not the
stuff ofnumber-onepop hits, but it is too
passionate for that to matter. Lost SomewhereBetween the Earth and My Home
is honest, strong, unique, and excellent
music. Even if you do not enjoy it, at the
very least thisalbum will makeyou think,
and that is rare these days. It deserves a
very careful listen by all thosewho look
for originality that does not compromise
quality.

realistic eye to the material, managing to

yet another bravura performance.
Monahan is both tough-as-nails and

In a genre full of misogynistic violence
{Copycat is no exception), it is both
heartening and refreshing to see two such
powerful female protagonists, played by
two such terrific actors.
This variation on familiar themes is
what makes Copycat more than just
another serial killer flick (it's certainly
better than the execrable Seven). At face
value, it's a carefully-crafted and nailbitingly suspenseful thriller, but, despite
its flaws, it's also a pointed rejoinder to
Hollywood business as usual.

Are you sick of counterproductive inyour-face activism? Tired of giving Swat
the ol' college try? Do you just want to
get out into the woods and play? Everyone is welcomeand encouraged to take a
break from the unrelenting Swarthmore
grind and check out the new Outsiders
group on campus.
The Outsiders (no, it's not that junior
high flick with Matt Dillon) is
Swarthmore's outdoors club, started last
year by Lauren Jacobi '97, Dave
Sturtevent '96 and Tim Sibley "98. The
club is for anyone who enjoys outdoor
recreation, including camping, hiking,
backpacking, rafting and horseback
riding.
Braving all weather, an intrepid group
of Outsiders led by West Coastnaturalist
Tim Sibley sleeps out in the Cram every
Thursday night 'lt's a nice change of
pace, to be out in the woods whenthe sun
rises and have the birds all around you
whenyou wake up Fridaymorning," said
Sibley. Everyone who wantsto run around
and have a good time in the Cram is
welcome to go. Sibley departs from

equipment is available.

escape campus life, the Outsiders go on
weekend hikes. Over fall break, a small

group went to Dolly SodsWoods in Virginia on a camping trip. "The trip was
cold, wet, miserable and delightfully
wonderful!"Sibley said. A canoe trip to
Pine Bends State Park in New Jersey is in
the works, as well as plans to go skiing
later on in the season. Students interested
in upcoming events should check the
flashy Outsiders bulletin board on the far
West end of Parrish.
Encouraging newcomers, the Outsiders is a loosely organized group of people
open to any suggestions for outdoor
events. So all of you who have ever
dreamed of kayaking the Schuylkill,
hiking to New York or treading across
Africa can now do it through the Outsiders.

Carl: My initial summary this week is
as follows: two films which I wouldhave
probably never seen had we not had to
review them... and most swear words per
minute of film for any two films shown at
Swat. Kate and I are willing to award a
prize to theperson who correctly sends in
the correct number of times the F-word
was said in both films. (Prize and winner
will be announced next week.)
Kate: Sounds exciting. I have some
extremely mixed feelings about Friday
night's Menace II Society. On one hand,
the filming is extremely well done. Great
camera angles, nice framing of shots,
fantastic use of all those other film studies terms.... You can tell that these guys
know their stuff. Kudos also go to the
structural makeup of thefilm. TheHughes
brothers (the 21-year-old Detroit-native
writers and directors of the film) offer an
extremely disturbing demonstration of
the cyclical nature of society. Perhaps a
little too straight-out-of-film -school, but
effective nonetheless.
Unfortunately, I can't get off of that
whole "disturbing" thing. This film is
incredibly hard to watch. It follows a
young man named Caine (Tyrin Turner)
living in theWatts projects districtofLot
Angeles as he becomes more and more a
part of the drug and crime street culture
that surrounds him. The intense violence
(all graphically shown on-screenX combined with the general sense of hopelessness, make this a really difficult 97 minutes. There are a few characters that you
know will be okay, but very few. Maybe
this makes the film more realistic, but it
also makes it much harder to handle the
unending gunplay.
I suppose my problem withMenace II
Society is that after such a horrifying
string of events, I want there to be some
message at the end, and there isn't. The
Hughes twins claim to have set out to
make a movie that entertains, and to let us
take from it what we like. Personally, I
couldn't possibly use the wordentertaining to describe this film; it's far too
disturbing. I can say, however, that the
societal critiques and comments offered
by the film are fascinating. Views of
Caine set against the backdrop ofIt's A
Wonderful Life on television and the
"blue-eyed Jesus" on the wall are extremely effective, as is a scene in which
a hospital-ridden Caine watches a gangster movie shootout with strong parallels
to his own life. In fact, the Hughes broth-

ers comment that they created a "gangster movie" and not a "gang" movie, and
pay tribute to Goodfellas rather than to
Colors.
I can't recommend Menace II Society
as a fun way to spend the evening, but it
is an extremely well filmed look at the
development of the street criminal, and
the endless cycle of city violence. See it,
but do so with a strong stomach.
Carl: Yeah well, I agree. Menace II
Society isn't exactly what I'd call a hilarious spoof on gangs in LA. The Hughes
brothers said the only message they re-

Quaker
Oats
by
Carl Heiberg and
Kate Zyla
ally wanted to get out was how a kid
could be transformed into a gang criminal, and so they did. I too, found it disturbing, and at times difficult to relate
since the Hughes brothers went out of
their way to makeCaine seem like a real
bad apple. To make Caine seem a little
more sympathetic, the Hughes brothers
added a group of other gangsters as his
friends. These include O-Dog (Larenz
Tate), a character with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. O-Dog
kills people at will, and even gets off
watching himself do it on video. I also
want to agree with Kate that both the
camera and the directing were, in general, quite good, and add that the acting
(by a rather new cast) was also pretty
decent. Watch for short cameos from
both Charles S. Dutton (T.V.'s Roc) and

moved to Australiaandbecame a woman,
because he comes back here as the transsexual Bernadette/Ralph in Priscilla.
JoiningBernadette in this Australian production are two transvestites, Tick/Mitzi
(Hugo Weaving) and Adam/Felicia (Guy
Pearce). The three are in the profession
of dressing up in flashy women's clothes
and then lip synching the words to great
songs by female performers of the past
and present. Hoping to leave all their
troublesbehind them, they leaveSydney's
Red Light district on a bus they name
Priscilla, and head for Alice Springs. In
Alice Springs they've been invited to
perform a four-week cabaret engagement.
The film definitely has some fun scenes
which made me laugh, and like Menace
II Society, Priscilla has some really nice
camera work. The amount of time spent

shooting in the desert also provides a lot
of really attractive scenery. I have to say
I thought the film was definitely interesting, but the whole thing was, well, odd. I
didn't quite see the art form. Guys dress
up in women's clothes, and lip synch, but
don't really have amazing dance moves.
Definitely not an occupation I'll be pursuing next year.
Kate: Now, Priscilla I can give a definite thumbs-up. Granted, it's an odd
movie, but pure fun. Anyone who has
enjoyedrecent Australian releases Strictly
Ballroom and Muriel'sWedding will also
get a kick out of The Adventures of
Priscilla. In fact. Bill Hunter, who plays
Bob in this film, actually stars in all three
of these movies. Once you accept the
idea of two transvestites and a transsexual wandering through the deserts of
Australia in a giant pink bus, wearing
dresses made entirely out of neon-colored flip-flops and lip synching to "I Will
Survive," just sit back and enjoy. If that
doesn't convince you, I offer one wordof
persuasion (well, one acronym): ABBA.
Carl: Our wrap-up this week goes like
this: Menace II Society gets a bowl of
oats from both of us, for the excellent
direction and development of thematic
ideas in the film. Still can't get over the
blood and guts, though. Kate gives
Priscilla several large bowls ofoats with
amajor overdose ofmulti-colored, sugarcoated toppings, whereas I'm giving it a
few very wild-fruit-flavored oats. If you
get to see both films this weekend, don't
forget about our contest

Jane Wagner's Play Searches for
Cosmic Krazy Glue in the LPAC
By Anja Landis
This weekend in the Pearson-Hall Thein LPAC come see Jane Wagner's
"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life
in the Universe." Although this play was
originally written as a one-woman play
for Lily Tomlin by herlover Jane Wagner,
it will be performed at S warthmore as an
ensemble cast of six actors. The deviation from the script's original intention
does not significantly affect the actions
as the inherent ironies have been maintained by cross-casting.
The play follows the hallucinations/
visions of Trudy, thebag lady, played by
Mary Meiklejohn. In each of Trudy's
visions, we are introduced to new characters, played by Cameron McPhee, Hillary
Thompson, Ahsiya Posner, Neal Cohen,
and Laureen Laglagaron, all of whom
appear to be related in some way to each
other thus proving Trudyright whenshe
says that"...there's some kind of cosmic
Krazy Glueconnecting everything to everything." Don't be surprised if, by the
ater

endof theplay, you're wondering whether
Trudy isn't more sane than you.
"Search" is directed by Anja Landis
and Nina Paynter. Lights and set were
designed by JennKoermer. KaraHerzog

Theater of LP AC on Friday, November

Wrestlers to Hit Mats Next Weekend

By Kendrew Witt
The wettest team on campus, a.k.a. the
swim team, began its dual meet season on
Wednesday with unparalleled success.
Victims numbers one and two were
Rutgers-Camden and Beaver College,
respectively.
The men's team status as "juggernaut"
preceded itself. As a result, Beaver failed
even to field a men's team. RutgersCamden, meanwhile, presented little
more of a challenge by offering a men's
team comprised of only two lambs (male

After supping with the Garnet grapplers, it is clear that this team is poised for
greatness. Practices have been particularly strenuous as of late.
Between gasps for air, super-sophomore PeteBalvanz described the Menof
Sparta's preseason workouts: "Besides
being run through the necessary 'precompetition' drills and 'Russian' aerobic
workouts of Potov (Ron) Tirpakski, the

Artingstall. So, in addition to the bodythrashingpractices, the SwarthmoreCollege wrestling team has been exposed to

swimmers).

Although Rutgers-Camden and Beaswimmers
on the women's side, the outcome was
unaffected. Theresults ofboth the men's
and women's meets were most aptly summarized by Gerry Kaufman '99, who
commented, "It [the score] was a whole
lot to not a whole lot, the guys' score
wasn't so close."
Frequently, the first meet of the season provides a chance for swimmers to
get re accustomed to racing after the offseason. On this night, though, many swimmers served up some first class performances. The freshmen, as a group, raced
to some astounding times. Junior Kim
Killeen exclaimed, "the frosh... they are
speedy!" Captain Maria Kaufman '96,
ver College arrived with more

enough culture to make our own Alfred
Bloom proud."
Anyone who frequents Tarble Pavilion has been exposed to the rigor of the
wrestler's workouts, as the atmosphere
has taken on the blood, sweat, and tears
so familiar to the Swarthmore wrestling
team. The team has welcomed many new
arrivals as the rugby players joined the
team for the first time this week.
Of special note is the much-awaited
arrival ofupper weights Elijah Porter '99
and Bryce Walker '9B. Matt Miller '95
has yet to tip the scales and it is unknown
where he will crack the line-up. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of the coaching
staff can hardly be contained with the
prospect of fielding a full line-up for the
first time in a number of years.

Women's Rugby Falls to Tough Bucknell Squad
By Jen Philpott

Swarthmore's dedicated rugby team,
the one that is still practicing out there in
the cold, traveled to Bucknell University
on Saturday to play a tough gameagainst
a top-ranked team. The final score was
disappointing for Swat, 5-17, but the
team felt good about their level of play.
The deck was stacked against
Swarthmore from the minute they took
the field. The team was playing without
forward captain Kelly Shannon '96 who
was back at school doing important
Swattie things. Her leadership was definitely missed, but the forwards rallied
around the alternate captain-for-a-day,
Margaret Cohen '96. The rest of the forward pack was intact and senior Alicia
Wilson stepped in to fill the void left by
Shannon at wing forward.
The back line also down a key player,
Liza Bonilla '9B, due to a mysterious and
painful injury. Courtney Clark '9B filled
in for Bonilla to complete the back lineof

Becca Cole '96, KT Laird *96, Karli
Watson '97, Morgan Kelly '9B, and Alicia Pierce '97 at full back.
Swarthmore arrived at Bucknell with
high hopes of a win despite the fact that
Bucknell played in the Divisional playoffs and placed second to Princeton (last
year's National Champion) in a 10-0
game.The team practiced hard the week
before and had a lot of momentum going
into the game. On Friday night. Cole
confided to scrum half Jen Philpott '97,
"I have a really good feeling about this
game. I think that we are going to play a
great game!"

The weather, which has been a huge
factor in Swarthmore's season (rain, mud,
etc.), again contributed an element of
challenge to the intrepid ruggers. It was
sunny but bitter cold last Saturday, and
the team shuddered at the thought of
stripping down, to shorts, that is. But
strip they did, and after a very brief warmup, they bravely took their positions for
the first kick-off.

The first half was entirely dominated
by Bucknell and their massive forward
pack. Bucknell was tackling better, hitting harder, and getting the balls out of
rucks more consistently than Swarthmore.
Bucknell had Swat on the defensive for
35 minutes, and scored twice during the
first half.
At half time, though, Swarthmore
psyched themselves up and quickly made
some adjustments in their game plan.
Sophomore Andrea Johnson, who is always an inspiration to her teammates on
the field, made a great comment, "Come
on you guys, we didn't drive threehours
andfreeze our butts off to play this badly!"
Bucknell was taken by surprise in the
secondhalf as Swarthmore demonstrated
their tenacity of spirit and true ability to
play rugby. Bucknell continued to drive
Swarthmore to their try zone, but despite
having theirbacks to the wall for much of
the half. Swat only allowed Bucknell to
addfive more points to their score. Pierce
had some great clutch kicks from deep in

the try zone.
Swarthmore struggled inrucks and the
back linehad a hard time getting the ball
up-field, butSwat's scrum drove Bucknell
all over the place. Bucknell seemed
stunned and complained to the referee
that they kept collapsing in the scrum
because they could not keep their footing
in the mud. Wilson astutely pointed out,
HA, they don'tknow mud!" In fact, the
playing surface was nearly idealfor rugby.
The shining moment of the game for
Swarthmore came late in the first half.
Philpott got the ball cleanly out of a ruck
near Swarthmore's try line and made the
pass to Cole, which set up a great line.
Then Cole, after looping to the far sideof
the field, kicked the ball across the field
and about 40 yards down field to land one
yard outside of the try zone and bounce
out of bounds.
This set up a line-out for Bucknell.
Hanan Hussein '97 made an amazing
steal and held on to the ball as she dove
into the try zone, supported by the forward pack, for herfirst A side score. The
entire series of play was an example of
how well Swarthmore can play when
they pull it altogether.
Immediately following the awesome
try by Hussein, the referee blew his
whistle and the game was over. Bucknell
was pleased with their win, but
Swarthmore was the team jumping up

many weeks.
The B -side played a few moments later.
Bucknell fielded an entirely new squad,
but Swat's tired A-side filled in many
gaps to complete their B-side. B-side
forward captain, Anita Pedraza '96 said,
"We are few, but we are proud."
Swat's B-side played a determined
game and allowed Bucknell only 10
points. Cole scored a try for Swarthmore
and, in addition to her amazing kick in
the A-side game, could easily have been
named player of the game for Swat. The
final score was 5-10, inßucknell's favor.
This Saturday, Swarthmore will play
their long-time rival, Bryn Mawr. Their
last game promises to be a great one as
the whole team is healthy and able to
play. Unfortunately, their last game of
the season is notat home. Oh well, maybe
next season the team's new match secretary will provide a better schedule for the
team, one with more than one home game.

Last Saturday afternoon, the Garnet
Tide concludedtheir homeschedule looking to secure a winning record and exact
a measure ofrevenge fromWestern Maryland, a team that had beaten them two
consecutive years. On a day that should
have beenfilledwith emotion, the Garnet
Tide succumbed like a beaten dog to the
GreenTerrors, 39-6. With one more game
remaining, the Garnet Tide still has a
host of unanswered questions.
To those who have followed the Garnet Tide all season, it must have seemed
like years since this very same Garnet
Tide team defeated Dickinson two weeks
ago. Inreality, this isn't the same Garnet
Tide football team that took the field on
opening day, and it certainly isn't the
same one that beat Dickinson. Those
teams played with confidence, pride, and
emotion, ingredients that have been sorely
lacking in three of the past four weeks.
For the fifth consecutive game, the
Garnet Tide offense failed to score in the
first half. That's not to say they didn't
have any good scoring opportunities. The
Garnet Tide's opening drive reached the
Green Terror 29 yard line, but a failed
fourth down attempt ended the drive.
After three more unsuccessful drives, the
GarnetTide had one more chance before
the half ended.
Starting from their own 30-yard line,
the Garnet Tide used a steady balance of
runs and passes to advance toward the
Green Terror goal line. With the ball at
the Green Terror 11-yard line and with
seven secondsremaining in the half. Head
Coach Karl Miran decided to take one
more shot at the end zone. However,
quarterback Pat Straub's '97 pass into
the endzone was intercepted, ending the
half.
Western Maryland, on the other hand,
had no problem finding the endzone.
After coming up empty on their first
drive, the Green Terrors got to work.
Using the arm and legs of quarterback
Brian Van Deusen, the Green Terror
marched 48 yards into the end zone, a
drive capped by a three-yard touchdown
run by Van Deusen.
Midway through the second quarter,
the GreenTerrors struck again. Starting

from their own nine yard line. Western
Maryland caught the Garnet Tide defense off guardby mixing in the run with
the pass. Van Deusen hit a streaking
Donte Abron for a 26-yard touchdown
pass, making the score 13-0,which would
stand until halftime.
If you were expecting second halfheroics from the Garnet Tide, you showed
up on the wrong weekend. What little
chance the Garnet Tide had of seizing the
momentum was smashed by the Green
Terrors, as they scorched the GarnetTide
defense for 87 yards on four plays, highlighted once again by a Van Deusen to
Abron touchdown pass, this one covering 52 yards.
Several drives later, on fourth down
and goal from the 16 yard line. Van
Deusen(2l-30\270yardsV3TDS\36yards
rushingM TD) found a "wide-open Tod
Carberry who walkedinto the endzone to
make the score 26-0.
The GarnetTide offense was as inept
as the GreenTerror offense was efficient.
The Garnet Tide managed only 88 net
yards rushing, 18 of which came in the
second half. The passing game was marginally better, netting 110 yards, 25 in the
second half.
Straub (14-31U03 yardsM TDMINT)
completed only 2 of 9 passes in the second half, due in large part to the relentlessness of Western Maryland's front
fourand a sieve-like offensive line.When
Straub wasn't being sacked or knocked
to the grass, he was forced out of the
pocket where he was even more vulnerable.
Straub wouldhit his brother Jason '96
for a 10 yard touchdown late in the fourth
quarter, but coming after two more Green
Terror touchdowns, it only served to
soften the blow of an embarrasing 39-6
loss.
This weekend, the Garnet Tide will
conclude their season and look to reach
.500 as they travel to Lexington,Virginia
to take on die Generals of Washington &
Lee University. The 5-2-1 Generals defeated the Garnet Tide 14-11 on Clothier
Field last season.
This week, in attempt to shake things
up, several players will be playing both
ways, as Coach Karl Mir an tries to see
who can play where for next year.

Conference

Hoops
By David Lischer
This—jason will be 'fi fan's dream.
Many oflast year's strongest conference
teams graduatedkey players while some
of theweaker teams had strong recruiting
seasons. As a result, teams will be more
evenly matched than last season. It is
nearly impossible to predict preseason
standings. Both the Eastern and the
Western conference DivisionTitles could
be up for grabs.
Swarthmore shared the Eastern Division Title with Muhlenberg College last
season. Returning only one starter and
three lettermen, Muhlenberg is unlikely
to do as well this year.
Washington College, whose win over
Swarthmore at the end of last season
prevented the team from getting sole
possession of the title, is the preseason
favorite to win the title.
Ursinus College, with only one conference win last year, had a phenomenal
recruiting year, and is not expected to be
the division doormat any longer.
Meanwhile, Haverford College is an
experienced team overall, and is led by
one of the best backcourts in the confer-

ence.
Swarthmore returns four starters and
seven lettermen. The Garnet swept
Haverford and Ursinus last season in
hard fought games en route to a 9-4
conferencerecord. With the leveling process thathas struck the conference, it will
be even more important for the Garnet to
win these key divisionalcontests.
Franklin and Marshall College swept
all 13 games with conference opponents
last year, winning the Western Division
Title, but was upset by Muhlenberg in the
conference championship game. Although F&M lost three strong players, it
is still a favorite to repeat.
Western Maryland College is a solid
team that returns nine lettermen. Likewise Johns Hopkins returns ten lettermen
and will be buoyed by forward Wed
Unseld who has returned after an injury
last year. Dickinson graduated its top two
players and will look to new members to
improve on its 2-11 conference record.
Four Centennial Conference players
havebeennamed to preseason Ail-American honor rolls. Haverford's top guard
Chris Guiton, wholed the conference in
scoring, was the only player namedFirst
Team.
Two F&M players, Mike Mehaffy and
Jeremiah Henry, earnedHonorable Mention. Washington's Ben Harris, second in
conference scoring last year, also earned
Honorable Mention.
Swarthmore will take the court for
their first game on November 17 and 18
for the Equinox Classic, co-hosted by
Swarthmore and Haverford. The final
games will be held at Swarthmore on
Saturday, November 18 and 1:00 and

Scrimmages
By Rachel Gutman

The Swarthmore Lady Garnet team is
off to a wonderful start this season. The
team scrimmaged on Monday and
Wednesday, and won both games. These
preseason victories are encouragingsigns
and will help to inspire the Tide to train
faithfully in the next few weeks before
the season opener at Johns Hopkins on
November 21st. These two wins also
show the team how much hard workpays
off. After three weeks of 20-hour practices per week, the team's improvement
is evident.
One of thenotable aspects ofthis year's
Garnet Tide is the positive support that
the team members offer each other. The
women, after these two scrimmages, are
beginning to play together as a unit
On the court, the women helped each
other out, communicated well, and prodded each other on. In fact, one of this
year's cheers at the huddle during timeouts is 'Together."
Monday's scrimmage was at Beaver
College. The GarnetTidebegan the game
somewhat shakily. Shooting under 10%
from the field and getting out-rebounded
by Beaver were some of the team's main
problems. However, the determined
women picked their game up a notch in
the second halfand played more aggressively, outrebounding and outscoring
Beaver, as well as improved their shooting percentage. Swat emerged with a 14
point victory.
Wednesday night's scrimmage was
played in the Tarble gym in full uniform
against Widener College. The Garnet
Tide took an early lead, sparked by Senior co-captain Nancy Rosenbaum '96,
scoring six of the first eightpoints. Early
in the second half, Widener caught up to
Swat and tied the game at 36. The Tide
stayedtough, however, even with Nancy
Rosenbaum and Michelle Walsh '9B on
the bench with foul trouble for over ten
minutes, squelching Widener's offense
with their aggressive defense.
Tljp game continued with Swarthmore
ahead by a few points, and they were able
to hold out until the very end emerging
with a 53-49 win.

No Swarthmore team this season has

Swarthmore women's badminton team
sent a representative to the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC) of the

Centennial Conference last Sunday at
Franklin and Marshall, with the hope of
encouraging other conference members
to initiate varsity badminton teams at
their colleges.
Thanh Hoang '97, of the Swarthmore
varsity badminton team, represented
Swarthmore at the conference. Hoang
initiated a discussion about the implementationof varsity badmintonprograms
at the other Centennial Conference
schools.
Currently, though Swarthmore participates in the Centennial Conference, bad-

minton is not a Centennial Conference
sport Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore are

the only members of theconference with
badminton teams. Badminton, a recognized varsity sport at Swarthmore and
Bryn Mawr, participates in competitions
with a separate league of schools.
The number of competitor schools for
Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is dwindling, despite increasing interest in the
sport at Swarthmore, nationally, and internationally. Recently, Swarthmore's
competition has been reduced to Bryn
Mawr, Albright, Harcum, the Academy
of the New Church and various tournaments.

According to Hoang and Swarthmore
badminton coach Dan Sears, badminton
is an inexpensive sport for a college to

had as much success as field hockey.
Kentwell obviously was doing something
right Fetter said, "He just knows ho w to
bring out the best in people.He knows
how to use their strengths to the fullest
advantage."
The team feels betrayed by the Athletic Department, and more broadly, the
school. A player explained. The fact
they got rid of the most successful coach
here, makes me question the motives of
the Athletic Department, and even the
college,when it comes to atheltics.More
excellent athletes are coming to Swat
every year, and then once they get here,
they are supposed to change their philosophies about succeeding in athletics
and passively go along with losing."
The decision to axe Kentwell reeks of
an odious sentiment at Swarthmore: that
Athletics are simply not important
That's right, there is a prevailing sentiment at this school mat athletics are
purely recreational pursuits. Not everybody feels this way, but too many people
complicitly accept the losing nature fostered by our Athletic Department.
Kentwell was one of the few exceptions
to this rule; he pushed his players to reach
their potential and obviously, the Athletic Department didn't approve.
There is nothing to be ashamed of
about wanting to have successful sports
teams at Swarthmore. Williams College,
(tied withSwarthmore in U.S. News and
World Report college rankings) consistently fieldswinning sports teams, obviously without compromising their academic excellence. Placing more emphasis on athletics would not impair
Swarthmore's academic and admissions
standards; in fact, it may accomplish the
reverse.

position.lt was not until Thursday, November 2, at 4:30 pm on the day of the
final field hockey team meeting, that
Kentwell was notified thathe would not
be retained for another season. He was
told that Karen Borbee, head women's
lacrosse and basketball coach, will replace him.
The team membersreceived word from
Kentwell on the 2nd that he could not
make the meeting and that he would not
be returning next year.
Despite conflicts with players past and
present, the majority of the players were
upset about the decision.The team sentiment is that if they had been consulted by
the Athletic Department,they wouldhave
opposed the ideaofdismissing Kentwell.
The hockey team seemed to lack this
kind of cohesion at the start of their
season-several players, including a captain, quit the team. Fetter explained, "In
the past, there have been disagreements
with the players as tohow the team should
be run and how he (Kentwell) should

maintain. Hoang, Sears and the
Swarthmore team hope thatthis fact and
an increasing interest in badminton will
persuade the Centennial Conference
schools to think about forming badminton teams in the near future. Hoang notes
that Gettysburg expressed a significant
interest instarting a program at the SAAC
meeting.

At Swarthmore, the badminton pro-

gram is thriving and the team is predicting a successful season, due in part to an
overwhelming response to badmintonthis

year. With about 25 women on theroster,
new recruits trying out the team almost
every day, and a small but enthusiastic
group of men's club team players, the
Lamb Miller fieldhouse's four courts are
filled to capacity every day.

"I think the freshmen have a lot of
potential," Hoang notes cheerfully, indicating that the talent and enthusiasm of
the group of new players is exciting for
this year's team. "We don'thave enough
courts to satisfy all of them."
But the lack of court space has not
dampened the badminton team's spirit.
Using space around and between courts,
over basketball nets and behind basketball nets, players drill the basics of the
sport Clears, smashes, and drops are
practiced in smallgroups on courts available, and doubles games are played over
and over again. After a break in the
middle of practice for sprints and footwork drills, the workout continues as
Swarthmore women's badminton prepares for the '95-'96 season.

Women's team in rare form after weeks's taper
By Danielle Wall

This coming Saturday, the dream becomes reality for the Swarthmore
women's cross country team. The Lady
Amazons will compete in the world famous Mid-East Regional Championships
sponsored by Dickinson College in
Carlisle, PA.
The teams and individuals that survive this killer race compete in theNCAA
Div. EI Nationals in La Crosse, WI on
November 18.
So, fans, keep your fingers crossed

andknock on wood...the GarnetTide has
the talent, determination, and strength to
pull off a big win.
The Amazon women were able to
endulge in a little rest and relaxation this
past weekend, since no races were held.
This brief break in the season provided
the team with the perfect opportunity to
focus on the upcoming challenge of
Regionals and to delve into Coach Ted
Dixon's wondrous world of taper. The
top seven Swat runners are feeling excited and full of energy, raring to hit the
course at full speed.

played her last soccer match, Rosenbaum is demonstrating the determination that makes her such a great athlete in whatever sport she plays.
Rosenbaum's teammate and captain Emily Walker '96 said, "I am so
impressed by the way that she gives so much ofherself to the teams she
is on. For example, soccer and basketball overlapped by a week, and
several days during that time, she went to soccer practice and then
basketabll practice after that— four hours of practice! She would probably just say it is becasue she has so much fun playing sports; that is
obvious from her energy and big grin all the time.But I also know that she
is a very dedicated teammate."

Kerry Boeye '97

Court**? of th* Bo*y* Family

Kerry Boeye '97, one of the amazing group of Swat cross country
runners, had a "break -through" race three weeks ago in a home meet
against Haverford, Liconoln, and Widener University. He finished within
seconds of nationally ranked (#6) Haverford's top four runners.
Boeye is a thirdyear varsity runner, yet he was unknown to coach Dixon
his first whenhe walked onto the team his freshman year. That year he ran
an impressive 26:55 in a hail storm at the conference meet Since then
Boeye has been a steady contributor as one of the men's top threefinishers.
This year, Boeye came up with another impressive race at conferences,
finishing 9th overall and first for Swarthmore. Coach Dixon is eager for
Boeye to run this Saturday at the Division HI regional meet: "I think he's
going to have the race of his life judging by his health and fitness."
