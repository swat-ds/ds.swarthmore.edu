Parlor parties offer dry alternative for campus life
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

In the spring oflast year, an anonymous donor set up a
substantial fund to support non-alcoholic social programming at Swarthmore. Since then, the Parrish Parlor programs have become a fixture of campus life. So far,
Parrish Parlor Parties has hosted a number of non-alcoholic events, including a chocolate night featuring a fountain.
According to Assistant Director of Student Life Kelly
Wilcox '97, the pilot program was launched to accommodate the needs of students who prefer to socialize in nonalcoholic settings. "People wanted to meet people, make
friends, not feel isolated and feel that there were other
individuals who wanted a [non-alcoholic] social scene,"
Wilcox said.
Assistant Dean for Residential Life Rachel Head also
noted the trend toward increasing the number of dry
events on campus. "There's definitely an emphasis on
identifying alternatives to alcohol programming on the
weeknights and the weekends," Head said, adding that the
administration relies heavily on RAs to inform students
about the different social venues both wet and dry that
exist on campus. "The RAs play a critical role as serving
as the mentors and the advisors to students, to help the
attendees at [dry] programs, to help facilitate those programs, and to help show that there are alternatives to
going to a party where there is alcohol every single day of
the week," Head said.
The Parrish Parlor Parties are "a. response to students'
desires, some of which are expressed by parents,"
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal said. "We
are able to have [the parties] because a generous donor
gave us a chunk of money to help support the alcohol-free
-

-

scene."

The Parlor Parties take place on Fridays and Saturdays
as an alternative to the many alcohol-related events that
are typically sponsored on those nights. Student groups
and individual students can volunteer to host Parlor
Parties and receive funding to do so by proposing a theme
to Kelly Wilcox. Each party requires two attendant baristas who are paid to oversee the event, much like Party
Associates. Last year, Wilcox created the Social Scene

Advisory Committee after a conference on alcohol and its
place in campus life. The committee consists of roughly
thirty student representatives from a variety of student
social, religious and athletic groups. "The first couple of
meetings
centered around the need for spaces and
events that weren't centered around alcohol," Wilcox said.
The SSAC ran a Parlor Parties pilot program last spring to
...

address these issues. The program consisted of free
themed events on Friday nights including make-yourown-sushi night, Mexican night and an open mike night.
"We decided to expand it to Thursday and Saturday, and
to be respectful to different religious or cultural obligations [we decided] to stagger the nights, so Friday nights
changed to Thursday and Saturday," Wilcox said.

"People wanted to meet people,
make friends, not feel Isolated and
feel that there were other Individuals
who wanted a [non-alcoholic] social

scene."
Kelly Wilcox
Assistant Director of Student Life
The role of the SSAC is to advise the college on "what's
right and wrong about the social scene," Westphal said.
"That doesn't mean they wouldn't actively jump in and be
baristas [for Parrish Parlor Parties]... It's sort of a way to
have student input into things that the Student Life Team
is interested in doing," she said. This year's committee is
comprised of RAs, students who served on the committee
last year and Student Council-appointed individuals,"
Westphal said.
Wilcox stressed that the administration is not seeking
to replace all events featuring alcohol with dry parties.
"It's not a mandate by any stretch," Wilcox said. "The
money was there
we asked the questions and the stu-

events," she said. "I think it's an indication of campus sentiment and desire. I think the fact that it's been so studentdriven adds merit and weight to it," Wilcox said.
The college alcohol policy has at times been the subject
of intense debate. In recent years, the administration has
clarified its stance on alcohol consumption, affirmed
Worth Health Center's policy of providing more comprehensive care for dangerously intoxicated students and
expanded the presence of non-alcohol-related activities
and spaces on campus. All of these developments have
intensified the debate over what is and what should be the
role of alcohol on campus.
Compared with the policies of peer institutions, the
administration's stance on alcohol consumption is objectively relaxed, although the administration does not officially condone alcohol use. In recent years, it enforced
stricter regulations on budgetary appropriations to

ensure that funds allocated for student-run social activities are not utilized to purchase alcoholic beverages.
The administration is particularly concerned with
underage drinking because of the legal ramifications that
students could face if detained by local authorities.
Because of the difficulty of monitoring the expenditures of
every student group, the deans count on students to exercise discretion in their use of college funding and avoid
"putting the school in a liability bind" by using the money
to purchase alcohol, Westphal said.
Trusting students' judgment in this matter is consistent with the college's general philosophy of treating its
students like adults. "We want you to understand that if
you drink alcohol, it's on you: funding, consequences and
all," Westphal said.
The Parlor Parties, however, are not the product of concrete policy changes but rather, an experiment in social
programming on campus. The Women's Resource denter
board members' recent decision to convert the WRC into
a dry space constitutes the only explicit policy change
regarding alcohol so far this year. Neither the college
administration nor Worth Health Center has enacted significant policy changes. "If there was one policy change, it
was that incoming freshman had to do AlcoholEdu last
year," Dean of Student Life Myrt Westphal said.

Casino's proposal to relocate in Chinatown angers residents
BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Featuring chain clothing stores, fast
food restaurants and vendors, the Gallery
at Market East is designed to attract all
kinds of shoppers and generate substantial
revenue for the city of Philadelphia. But
apparently, it hasn't generated enough.
Originally planning to build a casino on

the Delaware waterfront, Foxwoods
Casino is now considering other locations
and has its sights set on the Gallery.
However, several organizations have
been vocal in their opposition to the relocation of the casino. SAO, Swarthmore
Asian Organization, has been in contact
with one of those groups
Asian
Americans United in Philadelphia
to
offer support. "At the minimum, we are
committed to collecting signatures for
their petition and we are thinking about
doing some tabling in Chinatown to talk to
folks in the community about it," Toby Wu
'O9, member of SAO, said.
AAU, an advocacy group that aims to
promote the interests of Philadelphia's
Chinatown residents (most of whom are
non-English-speaking immigrants) has
taken a staunch anti-casino stance. The
group argues that the casino will not
increase commerce or tourism in
Chinatown and that a culture of gambling
could potentially exacerbate social ills
including divorce, child abuse and domestic violence. In addition, philly.com has

released data from a UCLA study showing
that Pacific Islanders and Asian
Americans are five times more likely to
become gambling addicts than Caucasians.
According to Helen Gym, a member of
AAU, the city of Philadelphia has not made
enough of an effort to publicize its policy
initiatives in immigrant communities like
Chinatown. "This is a primarily immigrantcommunity, and the city hasn't provided information to people who speak
English, much less people who do not
speak English. How the city treats its
immigrant populations is very negative.
So our main [objective] is to inform people.
There is a disturbing trend about who's in
control of dialogue [and] this is an opportunity to engage in it," Gym said.
Although the Supreme Court ruled that
Foxwoods is not legally obligated to relocate the casino from the previously designated waterfront location, the casino's
management
began
working
with
Governor Edward Rendell and Mayor
Michael Nutter to explore alternative sites
after neighborhood groups along the
shoreline mobilized in opposition to the
original proposal. "There's been tremendous activism from neighborhoods to say

This has struck a chord with another

reads, "Our elected officials are now trying to place a casino in a neighborhood

no relationship to citizens who will be
affected. It is a great betrayal of our movement's principles: transparency, good government and development guided by smart

AAU has already taken action to oppose
the development plants. The group recently drafted a petition protesting the construction of a casino and is now circulating the petition among local business owners in an effort torally support. According
to Gym, the city government has yielded to

the demands of the casino's developers out

the move to the Gallery because it is near
public transport and tourist attractions.

But a substantial coalition of residents is
outraged that the casino is being relocatedwithout their input.
"We praise moving the casino off the
waterfront, but to move it to the heart of
the city just shows how ridiculous this is.
It was a complete surprise that they would

choose a place downtown. [The decision is
being made] by people who will financially
benefit from this," Gym said.
Indeed, the Gallery is owned by the
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment
Trust, chaired by Ron Rubin, who according to Gym has miserable track record."

"[Rubin] is getting to double-dip
This is
just a quest for money in the midst of an
economic crisis," Gym said.
For now, city officials insist that nothing is set in stone. And with groups like
AAU, Chinatown residents are optimistic
that grassroots activism can force public
officials to respond to the community's
outcry over the proposed casino.
As part of its grassroots strategy, AAU
has embraced the efforts of younger
activists.
"We welcome college students and
young people who care about the city and
believe the public have a right to voice
their opinions to get involved. It's a struggle about whose voices are going to count
and what the city will do to respond," Gym

The day ofaction in Chester was headed
by the Power Vote campaign, a non-partisan
group that aims to demonstrate the popular
demand, especially among young voters,
for responsible and sustainable environmental practices. Currently the PowerVote
campaign is collecting signatures on a
pledge that promisOes environmental
awareness, makes elected officials account-

able and demonstrates a desire for viable
solutions to global warming.
The event aimed to inform the citizens
of Chester not only about the possibility of
green jobs but also of green careers as
architects and developers. Desire Grover, a
Chester resident, worked with PowerVote
to organize the event and raise some awareness throughout Chester.
"We need more leaders to come to the
table in Chester. Pastors, union leaders,
other landowners need to come together
and talk about Chester's green potential.
Chester has a history of industry, of burning materials, but it has the potential to
become something more positive," Grover
said.
Ladule Lako LoSarah 'O9 and Evan
Nesterak 'O9 attended this weekend's
events
as representatives
of the
Swarthmore community. "The day of
action was a step forward in bridging the
campus with the community of Chester in
terms of environmental issued," Lako
LoSarah said.
Both Nesterak and Lako LoSarah are
members of Earthlust and active in the
club's environmental justice campaign.
Last year, they and other members of the
campaign began the DelCo AUiance, a
group that focuses on the environmental
issues facing Delaware County. Through
the DelCo Alliance Nesterak met Groves,
one of the organizers of this weekend's
events, and became more involved in the
Power Vote campaign.
The day of action included a screening
of a speech given by Van Jones, a frontrunner in the movement for an increase in
green jobs in urban areas. The tagline for
the film is, "we can fight poverty and pollution at the same time," and delineates the
ways in which green jobs can benefit the
environment. "Unemployed workers can
receive training in solar panel installation,
as well as other construction techniques
and then be employed to install these environmentally friendly measures. So not only
are people put to work, but their work

Nesterak said.

Grover was heartened by both the

of the local architects and developers. "A lot
of time there is apathy shown in Chester
because the people feel disempowered. But
when they heard about a job, people
showed up," Grover said.
Despite the encouragement, the theme
of disenfranchisement rang throughout the
day. Chester is full of trash incinerators
that were built in the city because its residents did not have enough political leverage to oppose their construction. These
incinerators cause a huge amount of pollution, which increases the instances of asthma in Chester's youth.
Similarly, until the Chester Co-op's creation this past year, there hadn't been a
grocery store in the city of Chester for seventeen years. It was difficult to buy fresh
produce in the city, which some believe
may have contributed to an increased frequency of diabetes.
These are just two examples of what
Jones calls "Eco-apartheid," the concept
that only a small segment of the population
has the financial stability to consistently
make environmentally friendly decisions.
While a middle class family may have the
means to buy local organic food, drive to a
recycling center, or move to a clean, unpolluted neighborhood, many people below the
poverty line cannot make these adjustments.

"The day of action was
also about bringing
awareness to the fact that
everyone should
benefit
from environmentally
conscious measures."

"The day of action was also about bringing awareness to the fact that everyone
should have the opportunity to benefit from
environmentally conscious measures, not
just those who can afford it. It also brought
awareness to how far-reaching environmental issues are.

Environmental issues

Nesterak said.
Chester's past disenfranchisement creates an even greater push for the green job

for the unsightly aspects of Delaware

trash incinerators, chemical
spills, poverty and corruption. The commonly held belief by proponents of the environmental justice movement is that the citizens of Chester can break from the past by
creating a labor force to confront the past
environmental practices.
"There are a lot of forces that oppress
people [in Chester] from the outside from
state to county to city. So when help comes
in from the outside and tries to fix the problem, they're just putting a band aid on it.
It's a band aid, not a solution," Grover said.
To spread the message, Nesterak and
Lako LoSarah screened the documentary

"American Blackout," the story of urban
voter disenfranchisement in the 2004 presidential election.
Both Swarthmore students and members of the Chester community attended the
screening, which was followed by a panel
discussion. "There are definitely shady politics behind the reason why Chester is
home to so many polluting factories. So promoting knowledge of the political power
structure leads to knowledge of why the
environment is not being protected in
Chester the way it should," Nesterak said.
"There are corrupt officials raping the
city. People need to fight harder, to get up

and take a stand, but a lot of times people
can't fight with what they don't have,"
Grover said.

"When help comes in
from the outside and tries

Grover hopes to use "American
Blackout" as an education tool in Chester
by showing it to new voters and youth to
teach about voter disenfranchisement.
Lako LoSarah and Nesterak hope to screen
"American Blackout" at least three more
times in and around Chester.
They and other members of the
Earthlust environmental justice campaign
are also planning on collecting signatures

NEWS IN BRIEF
Environmental Justice group to document the state
of affairs in the barren iot of Chester brownlands
Along the riverbank in a onceindustrial area of Chester is a barren
three-acre lot called Wade Dump, also
referred to as the Chester brownlands.
Thirty years ago, the lot was a cesspool
including carcinoof toxic wastes
gens such as arsenic, benzene and
chromium
that accumulated over
years of illegal dumping.
Now, plans to build a stadium on the
site are nearly underway.
Although the lot has been cleaned,
activists are questioning how clean the
lot is. In response, Swarthmore's
Environmental Justice group, working
with the DelCo Alliance of Delaware
County, plans to make a documentary
about the dump and the disenfranchisement of Chester residents.
Majandra Rodriguez 12 and transfer student Jenny Akchin *O9 are heading up plans to make the documentary.
"Ideally, the video will be a combination of history and contemporary
issues related to the brownlands. We
want to increase awareness within the
community about what exactly took
place at the brownlands and why but
we also want to connect it to the contemporary political situation in
Chester, and specifically the plans to
erect a stadium on the brownlands
site," Akchin said in an e-mail.
Another issue that they plan for the
video to address is whether or not the
area is clean enough for the stadium.
According
to
the Philadelphia
Inquirer, three million gallons of toxic
waste were dumped at the Chester
Brownlands.
At least twenty chemicals were
found there. Although the area was
cleaned, the Philadelphia Inquirer
describes the cleaning as, "crews
demolished seven buildings and four
storage tanks, filled in a deep pit, and

October 2, 2008

carted away 11 mountains of debris.

They scraped away as much as five feet
of topsoil, spread fresh dirt, planted
grass, and walked away."
"People will go to the stadium
often," Rodriguez says. "Families will
go watch games and children will play

there."
In light of this, she notes, the cleanliness of the site is vital.
According to Rodriguez, the documentary will have a humanitarian
focus and will be "people-oriented." She
notes that in the past, the residents of
the area were low-income and 'didn't
have information or power to protest"
about the dump.
Now, Rodriguez says that one of the
main goals ofthe video is to "keep companies accountable" by continuing to
spread awareness of what happened
before.
Rodriguez and Akchin plan to
interview the Chester residents and
companies in order to illuminate the
past.
Some of the planned interviewees
for the documentary include firefighters that answered a call for an explosion at the site in 1978.
Approximately a fifth of them have
been diagnosed with a variety of afflictions caused by exposure to chemicals
at the warehouse, such as "cancer, vascular and neuromuscular disorders,
kidney failure" according to the
Philadelphia Inquirer.
Twenty-eight of the firefighters

have died.
Rodriguez hopes that the documentary, which should be released in early
December, will help the future of
Chester by "preventing the past from
repeating itself."

Discovery Weekend welcomes
diversity, students on campus

On Sunday, Earthlust members constructed paper windmills to be used in their windpower rally this Friday.

Science majors displayed summer research posters for Sigma Xi in the Science Center
this past Friday.

Last Saturday, the Parrish parlors
were packed with approximately 175
high school seniors waiting to be
assigned to student hosts. Every year,
the
admissions office organizes
Discovery Weekend to give high school
seniors of color a preview of what may
very well be the college they choose to
attend. High school students from
around the country participated in thee
days of programming designed to introduce prospective students to the college's
social and academic environments
through faculty panels, social events and
classroom participation.
Swarthmore's admissions office is
one of many across the United States that
organize annual programs for high
school seniors of color in an effort to
increase the diversity of the applicant
pool and ultimately of the matriculating
class. According to Calvin Ho 'll, a multicultural recruitment intern for
Admissions, "We're trying to get more
students of color on campus." Reed
College, Grinnell, Tufts and Washington
University in St. Louis are among the
institutions that offer students a weekend on campus at no cost. Swarthmore
covered the transportation and dining
expenses of all Discovery Weekend participants, many of whom flew great distances to visit the college.
The Admissions Office and various
student organizations on campus wanted
visitors to receive an authentic feel of
what life at Swarthmore is like, both academically and socially—in other words,
according to Ho, to inform visiting students "what Swarthmore's all about."

"I enjoyed the whole
experience and learned
a lot about a college I
barely knew about

before."

The weekend was packed with a variety of social events sponsored by different campus organizations. These events

included an ice cream social organized
by MULTi, a screening of new Latin
American music videos by ENLACE and

a teahouse hour hosted the Swarthmore
Asian Organization. There was also an
open house hosted by the Swarthmore
African American Student Society, a
"Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream Social," and
"Mehndi Night with DESHI." Through
these events, visitors were introduced to
the range of campus organizations that
cater to students of color.

Swarthmore's academic culture and liberal arts curriculum through a faculty
panel and an alumni panel. The alumni
panel, called "The Value of Liberal Arts
at Swat," discussed the virtues and the
practical applications of a liberal arts
education. The alumni presentation was
followed up by a panel of six professors

who guided a discussion moderated by
Professor Vollmer. The panelists
addressed student questions concerning
academics at Swarthmore and tried to
give participants a feel for the tempo of
academic life on campus. Discovery
Weekend also featured a faculty and staff
lunch, during which visiting students
were encouraged to ask questions in an
informal setting. Harry Wang, a high
school senior from Hartfield, PA, said
that the lunch was particularly beneficial. "The professors gave a lot of interesting insight into academics and the
courses available," Wang said.

Discovery Weekend also featured an
informational session on the college's
financial aid policies. On Sunday morning, Director of Financial Aid Laura
Talbot gave a briefoverview of the financial aid program and the procedure for
securing aid packages.
Visiting high school seniors also had
the opportunity to hear the perspectives
of current students in a panel on student
life that was closed to administrators and
faculty members so that current and
prospective students would feel comfortable engaging in a candid discussion of
the campus social scene.
The closed panel made a strong
impression on many of the prospective
students. "My favorite event was probably the student life," Alyson Chu, a high
school senior from Mechanicville, NY,
said. "You totally got an honest response
about the school. You could see the discrepancies between what students said
and what professors and admissions staff
said," she said.
Nevertheless, in a weekend teaming
with structured activities, some students
preferred to define their own agendas
and spend the weekend exploring the
campus independently "I liked the time
[without] required events," Poojith
Padmaraj, from Aurora, IL, said.
In the final hours of the busy threeday weekend, students visited Monday
morning classes to get a firsthand
impression of the classroom environment. Many courses were offered to visiting students, ranging from large classes
like Introduction to Economics and
Introduction to Biology, to first-year seminars such as Religion and the Meaning
of Life and the Linear Algebra Honors

Seminar.

Students took away different experiences from Discovery Weekend.
"I didn't learn that much new information about the school," Chu said at
breakfast on Monday, the last day of
Discovery Weekend. Padmaraj, who was
sitting across from Chu at the breakfast
table, had a very different response. "I
enjoyed the whole experience and
learned a lot about a college I barely
knew about before," he said.

aklausel@swarthmore.edu
Last Saturday, Sept. 27, the Lang
Center for Civic and Social Responsibility

hosted a Debating for Democracy (D4D)
on the Road Workshop to teach students
about socially responsible citizenship.
Representatives from several schools,
including St. Mary's College of Maryland,
Ursinus College and Widener University,
were present for the workshop. There
were 65 attendees, about 12 of whom were
from Swarthmore.
The visitors brought diverse experiences and ideas to the workshop that
might otherwise go unheard on campus.
"Having those students there was really great. I liked the new perspective on
activism from students on other campuses. It was also nice to meet new people,"
Elizabeth Crampton 'O9 said.
The workshop was coordinated by
Project Pericles, a national nonprofit
company founded by Eugene Lang '3B dedicated to educating students about the
responsibilities of citizenship.
The workshop was led by Christopher
Kush, a member of Washington D.C.'s
Soapbox Consulting.
"The workshop was designed to help

Students learned how to write political letters, how to analyze a bill in preparation for rebuttal arguments and how to
persuade the media to cover an issue satisfactorily.
"One segment of the workshop covered how to get the attention of the news
media for one's cause," Magee said. "The

Magee was also impressed with the
scope of the workshop." We moved beyond
talking about activism. We engaged in
practical, experiential learning
what
you learn here can be applied to the world

outside, be it in a student group, an
activist cause, or just being a motivated
citizen," Magee said.
Student participants appreciated the
opportunity to learn how to become
engaged citizens.
"I thought the workshop was really
good. I picked up valuable skills in talking to our Congressmen. I like the idea
that it's not good enough to be a participant in democracy, but that you have to
be a thoughtful participant in democracy.
You need to take the time and effort to
make yourself a real person to these people," Crampton said.
Magee felt that the skills emphasized
in the workshop would be helpful in real
situations where one would be interacting
with legislators.

"The goal of this workshop was to
teach concrete skills that can help students be involved effectively in social
change.

For example, Mark Dlugash 'OB is
going to speak to legislators on behalf of

Although Crampton was pleased with
her experience, she would have liked to

see more participation from Swarthmore
students.
"I know it's really easy to get consumed by our community here because
we're doing such wonderful and exciting
things, but the skills we learned at the

SSAC explores non- AROUND
alcoholic activities Yale dean reclaims rankings
swarthmorephoenix.com

From ALCOHOL, p. 3
The Worth Health Center, under director Beth
Kotarski, has been refining its internal policies regarding overnight care for students. "Technically, [the policy] hasn't changed
It was looser before. It still [complied with] Pennsylvania standards, but it wasn't as
well-defined as I am comfortable with. Being an
overnight healthcare facility that sees patients 24
hours a day, we have to adhere to certain standards
and policies," Kotarski said, adding that she has made
an effort to enforce more rigorous compliance with
these standards since her appointment as director last
...

September.
In particular, Kotarski stressed the need for Worth
to maintain a reasonable nurse-to-patient ratio, taking
into account the particular conditions of patients and
the comfort level of the Resident Nurse on duty at
night, when intoxicated students are most commonly
admitted for overnight supervision. "It is ultimately up
to the RN who is caring for patients. We have seven
beds, but we never are able to have seven students over
night with just one nurse. That ratio would be an unacceptable ratio, so we would have to bring in another
nurse if that was the case," Kotarski said.

We're hoping people are making
better decisions, but it may be
because we had a lot of activities
planned."
Myrt Westphal
Associate Dean for Student Life
Student Body President Yongjun Heo 'O9 said that he
supported Kotarski's efforts to increase the nurse-topatient ratio. "I think that's naturally a safer option
it's not safe for one nurse to be overseeing
because
more than two or three student at a time. Sending them
to the hospital if there's a need is the best option, so
they have the best care," Heo said, adding that it is
never the college's intention to "get students into any
sort of trouble." "We just want to make sure people are
safe," Heo said.
However, several students have expressed concern
that neither the college nor Worth Health Center has
responded appropriately to particular instances of
intoxication. Relating her negative impressions of the
college's response to a friend's intoxication earlier this
year, Amelia Sizemore 'O9 said, "I have no qualms
about going to the health center for other reasons, but
it is not a resource that students feel they can turn to
in a time when their health is at risk because they do
not feel respected."
Others find the college's response to situations to be
better than the alternative. "Receiving medical treatment is never particularly pleasant, but I'm glad that
the college provides these resources because the consequences [of seeking help from Worth] are certainly
preferable to those one would have to face outside of
the Swarthmore College setting," Michelle Walters 'l2
said.
Unlike the social calendars of previous semesters,
Pub Nite was postponed for the first few weeks of the
school year. According to Heo, Pub Nite's conspicuous
absence was probably deliberate. "I think the reason
was to make sure that there's a period of adjustment,
especially for incoming students, so that [they] especially don't get bombarded with this culture or environment where there is alcohol," Heo said.
Whatever the cause may be, the administration
noted fewer alcohol-related incidents in the first few
weeks of school than were reported last year. "We're
hoping people are making better decisions, but it may
be because we had a lot of activities planned. We had

YALE DAILY NEWS (YALE U.)
(U-WIRE)
Dean of Admissions JeffBrenzel wants to
find a new way of ranking Yale against its peers
whether or not the College is number one.
Harvard Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons
may have stolen the show at last week's annual meeting of
the National Association for College Admission
Counseling in Seattle with his presentation of now-famous
findings criticizing the SAT, but Brenzel's pet project
could prove just as newsworthy.
In a presentation with the anti-rankings organization,
the Education Conservancy, the dean delivered a critique
of the U.S. News & World Report rankings and called for a
more educational alternative.
The characterization of his presentation as a "lengthy
Higher
attack on U.S. News" by news organization
Ed, though, was not accurate, Brenzel said.
"I see no point in attacking the U.S. News rankings or
other commercially driven attempts to put a consumer
spin on the college search process," Brenzel said in an email. "Rankings aren't going to go away because educators or counselors see them as misleading and harmful.
The only question is whether educators can collaborate to
produce a better alternative."
At the event, Education Conservancy founder Lloyd
a
Thacker presented the prototype for this alternative
Web site called "College Speaks." Though still under
development, the site would feature questions to help students determine what types of colleges they are interested
in and which specific colleges are appropriate for them. It
would also contain information about colleges beyond the
basic data typically availably in databases and an "ask the
experts" interactive section. Thacker is currently solicit-

ing funds from colleges, foundations and other partners to
build the site. Yale has already donated $30,000 to the project, which went toward sponsoring a "Beyond the
Rankings" conference on campus last fall to foster discussion on the project.
"This will be a big task and require many actors, but
education deserves a college selection process that is educationally appropriate," he wrote in an e-mail.
But Andrew McNeill, director of college counseling at
the Taft School in Connecticut, said he is unsure the project is viable.
"I love the idea of getting past the numbers in evaluating candidates," said McNeill, who attended the NACAC
conference but was not at the Education Conservancy session. "But it's not going to happen. There's too much market pressure now to do admissions by the numbers."
The conclusions of the Fitzsimmons commission
which recommended that colleges examine their use of
the SAT and ACT and consider whether the benefits outwere mostly received with
weigh the disadvantages
praise at the panel Saturday, according to news outlets.
Brenzel called the report' cin excellent piece of work,"
saying he agrees with its principal conclusions and that
Yale will continue to review its own use of standardized
tests.

Tom Walsh, director of college guidance at the Roxbury

Latin School in Massachusetts, commended the commission for validating the decisions of those colleges that
have already decided to become test-optional.

But McNeill said he didn't think the report's conclu-

sions were "earth-shattering." "They are not going to
change the admissions landscape," he said.
Other features of the NACAC conference included discussions on trends in early decision programs and a coun-

selors' college fair.

Finance crisis hits home with student loans

University students are finding out

be concerned about the nation's
recent economic woes.
The financial crisis, which started
in the housing and mortgage industry, could potentially spread to the
student loan industry and other
areas impacting students.
"Imagine a world where nobody
can get a loan," said J. Kevin Quinn,
an associate professor in the
University's economics department.
"Businesses would shut down, students would not be able to get loans
for school."
It may be hard for some students
to understand how people buying
homes with loans they could not possibly pay back, could possibly effect
their ability to get a student loan. But
University economics professor Tim
.Fuerst explained how the two are
linked.
The crisis began when housing
prices skyrocketed and crashed,
Fuerst said, leaving bad mortgages
and loans that couldn't be paid off.
Now the banks that gave out those
bad loans are in trouble. And
because those banks also provide student loans, those students who
depend on student loans for their
tuition may be taking a hit.
"If the bank doesn't get money
coming in, they can't lend money
out," Fuerst said, explaining banks
aren't getting the money from the
housing loans that they expected.
Banks don't keep all the money

their customers have. Most is lent
out to people, to businesses and to
students. Now the banks and businesses are suffering from the lack of
lending, and the government is looking for a bailout proposal that will
succeed.

All the news of the recent crisis
has started to cause concern among
students. Sophomore Lauren Schaff
said it was scary to think about getting a loan or a job after graduation.
Even those who depend on their parents to pay for school are affected
because their parents are affected,
Schaff said. She has student loans
from her bank, Key Bank, but pointed out that a lot of students are turning to Sallie Mae, a student loan company, instead of private banks.

"I'm confident enough
there are... resources
...

we've withstood

worse over the past
hundred years."
Aaron Mranca
"If the economy's doing bad, the
banks are thinking 'How are we
going to get our money back?"' Schaff
said.

Sophomore Kevin Gressley heard
his bank, Merril Lynch, might go
under. But he's not too worried yet.
“Over the summer when I'm wondering if I can come back to BG or
not, I'm going to be worried,” he said.
“Next year, if it gets worse, I'm going

to be in trouble." He thinks there
needs to be consequences for whoever started this. "If we bail them out,
it's going to repeat," he said. Gressley

is also concerned with how this will
play out on a global scale.

Other countries that depend on
the U.S. economy for stability are
having to bailout their own
economies.
"I'm worried about the economy
for more political reasons," senior
Aaron Mranca said. "Because it's
affecting the world a lot more than it
did in the past."
He thinks the economy will be
okay and the stock market will come
back up. "It will rebound," he said. "It
will come back."
Mranca used to have a few stocks,
but gave them up when his family
accountant advised him to.
That was a while ago, though.
Right now, he doesn't think it's a
good idea to take money out of the
stock market. But people are.
"People pull back from stocks
because they want something safer,"
Quinn said. "In trying, we bring
down the stock market." It's this kind
of fear, he said, that is partly behind
the crisis as well. People are withdrawing money and exchanging
stocks for safer enterprises.
"It's like rushing out of the theater
when someone calls fire," he said.
And as far as fixing the economy
goes, most believe it depends on who
is elected.
But Mranca still thinks it will
eventually even out. "I'm confident
enough there are enough resources
to bounce back," Mranca said.
"We've withstood worse over the past
hundred years."

Gonzo wizard journalism: battling against Voldemort
I'd have to tell him in advance, which I couldn't do without entering Kohlberg. Although I thought of tossing a
rock up at the classroom window to get his attention, and
then telling him I was ditching for political reasons but
if he opened the window and promised to lecture very
very loudly I'd try to contribute, this all seemed illadvised for a number of reasons. I considered a number
of other options; hunger strike? petitions? boycott MTV
itself, and leave my insatiable hunger for outrageous sixteenth-birthday party exposes and close-up confessionals

forever unsated?

So I went to class, dismayed, silenced by the youth-

oriented-music-entertainment establishment. Dejected, I
asked my assembled classmates if any of them knew the
reason for the filming. I was informed that they were

By way of background: MTV was founded in 198 L The
first video broadcast was "Video Killed the Radio Star"
by The Buggies; the first words spoken on air were
"ladies and gentlemen: rock and roll". It was a declaration of purpose, then, an alternative lifestyle option for
the garish dispossessed young suburbanites of the day.
When I came of age, in the early aught-aughts, the network had modified its format to focus on Hot Tub
Elimination Challenges and the music video for Sisqo's
"Thong Song". Today, apparently, the network visits prominent liberal arts colleges and videotapes seminars on the
supposed literary subtext of popular
British children's books about a
boarding school of a most wizardly
inclination, and the magical
adventures that occur herein.

On Thursday, Sept. 18, 2008, I noticed an 8 1/2 by 11

authorized MTV productions to make use of their name

Placing such a flagrant, unapologetic violation of our
Constitutional rights, perpetuated by a massive multimedia multinational no less, in the center of the
Swarthmore campus takes a kind of genius. It is equivalent to, say, placing a handful of progressive college
students wearing shockingly blue t-shirts in
the middle of a campaign rally for a populist conservative, or shooting a blast of
citronella directly into a cloud of angry
gnats; it is like an angry tapeworm, a little malevolent tumor of injustice. From a

their shenanigans. She agreed to speak to me, provided
I swore that I was up to good and only good and she
received explicit legal permission from MTV's promotional department. It was not clear why she, a legitimate
associate of an admittedly dubious news organization,
was not allowed to speak to me, a highly dubious associate of a fairly legitimate one, but presumably there was
enough legal Devil's Snare involved to choke out any possibility of communication.
I subsequently spent forty-five minutes attempting to
contact someone who had, as I eventually learned, left
her job at MTV immediately after this year's Video
Music Awards; the show had featured a minor controversy involving the aggressive endorsement of abstinence by several artists, as well as a segment in which
Cristina Aguilera, clad in a pleather straitjacket, rubbed
her business all up on a pane of glass while intoning
"Genie in a Bottle 2008." This is enough to break the
brain of any sane person, so I was not unsympathetic to
the ex-publicist. Nonetheless, my hopes of penning a
searing, venomous indictment of the hypocrisies of the
American entertainment industry were tragically
crushed.

There was only one sane reaction to
this horrible goddamn situation. I
filled my heart with hatred and my
gut with firewhiskey.
I can offer you little by way of closure. In a brief,
terse exchange the MTV people informed me that the
instigating paper was a "cablecast sign," apparently standard procedure while filming in public. The video segment has been posted on the MTV news website, and features suspiciously attractive freshmen discussing centaurs or something, as a fatherly voice helpfully informs
viewers that the course indeed "fulfills a writing requirement for all majors since it combines literature, composition and theory" (Ladies and gentlemen: rock and roll).
And our heroic maverick reporter, sadly lacking in actual content on which to report, was forced to conjure up
an incoherent retrospective from press releases and
dubious Wikipedia articles; regardless, he was able to
complete his column by deadlineand so escape the righteous judgment of the Board of the Phoenix.
So hey, abracadabra! All is well.

and nothing else." Using the
database established by the

Music Genome Project, Pandora
generates playlists referred to as
"radio
stations" comprised of

songs that have similar musical

traits. If you pick "Raw Power"
by the Stooges as your starting

point, for example, as I did,

/
Pandora will analyze the key elements of "Raw Power" and then play
you "Throw Aggi Off the Bridge" by
Black Tambourine. Why? Because both
songs feature "electric rock instrumentation, mild rhythmic syncopation, extensive
vamping, major key tonality and
a vocal-centric aesthetic."

But,
what happens when

Does Pandora
run the risk of

Is music sort of
akin to desserts
in that it seems
like it would be
nice to eat chocolate cake all day

long but really, when it comes down to it, a plate of
broccoli will do the trick? I attempted to answer these
questions by gorging myself for 24 hours straight on
my favorite music (according to Pandora). No skipping
of tracks, no pausing. Here's how I held up.

Sept. 28, 6 p.m.
I select Andrew Bird as the main influence for my
station. His intelligent lyrics and delicate instrumentals will hopefully spawn some good sound-a-likes.
Pandora plays me a track from Weather Systems and
we're off!
Sept. 29,12 a.m.
I have not heard a woman's voice in six hours. For
some reason, Pandora has assumed that my love for
Andrew Bird's "mellow rock instrumentation" and
"repetitive melodic phrasing" means that I enjoy all
male artists with sensitive voices and twee rawness.
Also, I have heard the same Decemberists song twice.
I will now go to sleep listening to something plucky by
Damien Rice.
Sept. 29, 2 a.m.
Can't sleep. Another song by Wilco.
Sept. 29, 9 a.m.
I wake up to silence and not to the soft voices of
men bemoaning their miserable lives. Pandora gives
me this message: "It looks like you're not listening
anymore. If I'm wrong, I apologize." This first-person
note seems a bit creepy to me in my morning haze but
I click on the "keep playing" button anyway. I am
greeted by Elliott Smith's "Alphabet Town." Smith's
use of a harmonica is refreshing but then Pandora follows with another track that features a harmonica. I
begin to hate harmonicas.
Sept. 29, 6 p.m.
Pandora plays me my last song, "The Recluse" by
Cursive. At this point, unless I have heard the song
before, I am unable to differentiate between Sufjan
Stevens, Elliott Smith, Iron and Wine etc. I feel like listening to a radio station geared towards a specific genre
of music should make me more attentive to stylistic
quirks and mutations. Instead, everything has started
to blur into the fuzz of guitar, piano and gentle vocals.
After the song ends, I click the pause button and enjoy
the sound of silence. I then make a new radio station.

So, after an entire day of Pandora as my own personal DJ, what have I learned? Despite my growing
hatred for folk-inspired indie music, I still maintain
that Pandora is a wonderful musical resource and a
great way to explore genres and artists. Although I did
hear a few songs more than once over the course of 24
hours, Pandora does a relatively good job of playing a
large number of artists that share similar traits.
On the other hand, I have discovered that there is
more to musical taste than breaking down songs into
hundreds of pseudo-scientific parts such as 'extensive
vamping" and "subtle usage of vocal harmony."
Removing the human element from musical exploration
takes most of the fun out of listening to new songs.
Having a list of similar-sounding artists may be convenient but it also forces musical taste to be homogenized. Pandora assumes that because I like Andrew
Bird, I will also like all of his clones. Pandora cannot
pick up on the fact that I might listen to Andrew Bird
for his clever lyrics, which then make me think of The
Smiths' witty turns of phrase. And, quite frankly, I don't
think that I am ready for such technological advances.
That first-person message I received at 9 a.m. was
freaky enough.
Liana is a junior.

IM-PRESS-IVE
COLLECTION
OF
PRINTS
ANThe David
and Susan Goode Collection at the/Artur Ross Gallerr

Arts in the Area
The Arthur Ross Gallery at the
University of Pennsylvania may be small,
but its current exhibition presents museumquality works by internationally renowned
artists. "The Process in Print: The David
and Susan Goode Collection" provides an
opportunity to learn about printmaking
processes through the works of20th century
masters.

The show opens with a prominent figure
Andy Warhol.
in modern printmaking
The famous artist greets the viewer with a
cold, quiet stare, gazing out from "The
Shadow," a self-portrait. The silkscreen is
part of Warhol's "Myth" series, which
includes the likes of Mickey Mouse and
Superman. By 1981, the year Warhol created
this print, he had become a legend himself,
casting an enormous shadow upon the art
world.
Susan Goode's interest in Pop Art also
lead her toward Roy Lichtenstein's
"Industry and the Arts II." The painter is
famous for his exploitation of Benday dots, a
printing technique used in comic book illustrations. Lichtenstein further pursued his
interest in dots through screen prints. To
create a screen print, an artist squeezes
paint through a mesh, blocking areas that
should remain negative. The paint comes
through the mesh to form small circles or
squares on the paper beneath. Lichtenstein
enlarges the sizes of the dots in "Industry
and the Arts II" beyond the size of the mesh
holes. In other words, every large dot in the
print is actually made from many smaller
dots. The print plays with and exaggerates
the qualities of screen prints.

ELENA SMITH

Another famous Pop artist represented
in the Goode collection is Claes Oldenburg.
He is best known for creating sculptures of
everyday objects on a monumental scale.
He designed the 45 ft. tall clothespin that
stands at 15th & Market Streets in Center
City Philadelphia. Oldenburg formed
"Study for Standing Mitt," a lithograph, to
prepare the design of a new sculpture. The
artist primarily uses flat fields of color in
the print. Instead of conceiving the sculpture in three-dimensional terms and thinking about shadow and space, Oldenburg
focuses on form.
Lithography is a particularly suitable
medium for studies like Oldenburg's. While
some printmaking techniques are tedious
and complicated, lithographs call upon the
basic skill of all artists
drawing.
Oldenburg drew directly onto a lithographic stone with a special crayon, letting his
ideas flow freely from his hand. An example
of a lithographic stone is on view at the

7\&FT

As an Abstract Expressionist, Robert
Motherwell also sought printmaking mediums that would enable him to quickly and
freely release his impulses. "Red Sea I," a
color aquatint and lift-ground etching, captures the energy found in Motherwell's canvases. Black calligraphic strokes run across
a red backdrop, ending in explosive dabs
and dots. Motherwell mimics the expressive
potential of the paintbrush in theprint, creating forms thatresemble splattered paint.
Neil Welliver's "Stump' is one of my
favorite works in the show. The stunning
woodblock print contains thirty unique colors. Prints rarely contain this many colors
because the artist must carve a separate
woodblock for each color. Welliver was able
to print more than one color from some
blocks, but he created 27 separate woodblocks. A tremendous amount of work went
into the creation of this print and Welliver
received help from a Japanese woodblock
master.

"The Process in Print" provides an intimate window into the works ofthe 20th century's most famous artists. Most of the

artists featured are best known for their
paintings and sculptures. They are not dedicated printmakers. The exhibitionprovides
arare opportunity to see the artists' masterful experimentations in new media.
Through November 2. 220 South 34th
Street, Philadelphia. Inside the Fisher Pine
Arts Library at the University of

Pennsylvania.

Pub Nite through the ages The crash culture
BY EMILY CRAWFORD

ecrawfol@swarthmore.edu
The decision not to allow sports teams to host Pub
a decision that subsequently pushed
Nite this year
the date of the first Pub Nite back until after the senior
class officers were elected was a tremendously devastating blow to the booming social lives of many
Swarthmore students. For the first few Thursday nights
of the semester, flocks of displaced Pub Nite enthusiasts
could be seen wandering campus, at a loss for what to do
without their weekly dose of Natty Light. When the
newly elected senior class officers hosted the first official Pub Nite last week, joyous yells of Semisonic lyrics
filled the air; it was as though the Pub Niters had finally found their way home again. This weekly night of
debauchery has become an essential institution of
Swarthmore, so much so that some people feel downright uneasy if they go a Thursday night without playing flip-cup or dancing on tables to the hits of the 90s,
red Solo cup in hand. While Pub Nite has become thor-

oughly ingrained in the culture of Swarthmore, however, there is a surprising lack of information about its
origins.
Pub Nite is not the result of five kegs mysteriously
materializing in Paces one day. In 1995, the senior class
officers hosted the first Pub Nite as a fundraiser to help
pay for their senior week, the same purpose that it
serves today. Although several sources have confirmed
that it began in '95, there is no mention of Pub Nite in
any school publications until 1997, suggesting that it
may have been a somewhat private affair. In February
of 1997, a short-lived variation was introduced, called
"Tavern Night," that was also funded by the senior class
and was hosted in place of Pub Nite once a month.
Tavern Night was meant to be a classier alternative to
Pub Nite and featured expensive, high quality beer,
waiters and waitresses and a live band. The party permit that the senior class officers received in order to
host the event came with the conditions that it was to be
both privately funded and not advertised publicly,
which supports the idea that Pub Nites were originally
a bit of an undercover operation. "The first Pub Nites
were very different; students would sit down and talk
and usually only have three or four beers," Assistant
Director of Student Life and Academic Advisor Kelly
Wilcox '97 said. "It was about learning to appreciate
good beer and a response to the Beirut and cheap beer
you would find at the frats." Wilcox was a sophomore
when the first Pub Nite was held.
It seems that as time progressed, Pub Nite evolved
into a more and more boisterous event. Former senior
class officer Alice Hershey 'O2 said that by the turn of
the millennium, it was both "crazy" and "festive," in
contrast to a relaxed conversation held over a few beers.
However, the crowd was still different from that of
today. "Pub Nite was predominantly juniors and seniors
when I was younger," Hershey said. "I don't think I ever
would have gone as an underclassmen. Thursday was
the new Friday, so you could go crazy. By the time you
were a junior, you started to realize you had fewer early
classes and fewer classes on Fridays, so you wentto Pub
Nite." While the crowd was still older, the atmosphere
was evolving into something similar to current Pub
Nites. "I would describe the atmosphere as more like a
bar than a Paces party," Hershey said. "People would
play quarters, hang out." When asked where the beer of

THE PHOENIX

her time fell on the spectrum between classy and Natty,
Hershey said, "It varied a lot. There was always at least
a keg of Yuengling, and then we would mix it up due to
finances or taste. Every once in a while we would stoop

as low as Natty Light." The music selection, which is so
essential to Pub Nite today, was usually a mix of alternative and classic rock.
Since the early 'oos, Pub Nite culture has simply
become a more ritualized and complex tradition.
Somewhere along the way, flip-cup appeared as the most
popular drinking game, although the quarters and card
games of the middle years still remain as well.
Somewhere along the line the quality of beers seems to
have downgraded, due to demand and financial reasons,
to a consistent 4-6 kegs of Natty Light. The music of Pub
Nite has become a phenomenon of its own, most likely
starting around 2006 when the role of DJ was opened up
to volunteers from the student body, a right previously
reserved for senior class officers.
Peter Gardner 'OB and Andrew Fieldhouse 'OB claim
credit for being the first ones to play "Closing Time" as
the last song during their junior year, a tradition that
has already come to be a symbol of Pub Nite in itself.
"American Pie" has become another staple song, played
usually sometime towards the end of Pub Nite, and
always faithfully accompanied by chants of "Die, die,
die!" each time before the refrain. Gardner, a legendary
Pub Nite enthusiast, said of the spirit of recent Pub
Nites, "The joy of pub night lies in its cathartic influence; it is a release from the regularity of Swarthmore
and the occasional mental and academic claustrophobia
of the campus. Yes, it is still on campus (in Paces), and
yes, it is still with the same people you see around all
the time, but Pub Nite is something different altogether.
It is a place of unadulterated release. And that is a good
thing."
Clearly, Pub Nite has evolved greatly through the

ages, but certain elements remain the same: the presence of beer, its location in Paces, the strange misspelling of the word night, but most of all its therapeutic nature. Whether through a peaceful conversation
held over beers or a rousing verse sung from a tabletop,

Pub Nite has always provided an outlet for students to
release their academic stress and celebrate the coming
weekend. And that is a good thing.

On September 16, the Federal Reserve bailed out insurance giant AIG. The Crash Bash Party fell upon
Swarthmore society September 20. Could there be a connection? "We felt that the Crash Bash served as a warning
sign for times ahead and for their probable effect on campus social life," co-organizer of the bash Blaine O'Neill 11
said. In the midst of what most are now calling the greatest economic turmoil since the Great Depression, what is
Swarthmore doing to cope?

Whether or not this is a Depression yet, I feel something definitively Depressive in the air. Conversations
about the future have grown darker, less optimistic.
Before we investigate further, let us take a look back at
how Swarthmore dealt with the last Great Depression. I

did some research in the Phoenix archive room about the
health of the school and found it to be pretty strong. In
January 1931, Swarthmore had "The Largest Enrollment
in History," according to one headline
390 students
crammed into a much smaller school. As for the campus
culture, no surprises there; left-leaning journalist Paul
Blanchard spoke here in 1933, and according to Phoenix

headlines, "Socialism is Necessary." Yet peppered
throughout older issues of The Phoenix are the same
Swarthmore concerns, notices for lectures, sororities,
package vacations, honors exams and Prohibition raids.
Ah, Prohibition.
But back to the future. Some feel the same chill I do,
but some do not. Elizabeth Crampton 'O9 said, "I think that
I haven't exactly observed anything like that at
I haven't heard anyone say, 'I can't buy
Swarthmore
this thing right now,' mostly because I don't see people
using cash on campus very often." On the other hand,
Glenn Stott 'l2 said that "[the crisis] is on the tip of everyone's tongues, and yes, I think it will affect the way I do
things." Martha Townsend at the bookstore has not yet
observed a change in consumption habits. "What people
buy here is necessary, you know, books. I hope students
find soap and toothpaste necessary." Charlie Decker 'O9,
co-host of a program on WSRN "R3 to Center City" that
encourages Swatties to attend performances said, "I think
if anything, people will go to Philly less. Swarthmore
could be even more insular." But most Swatties I talked to
seemed uncannily reticent about this topic.
I spoke with Laura Talbot at the financial aid office,
who assured me that there will be no campus job lay-offs.
She also said, "If families need more help there will be
more help. Swarthmore has always been there if a family's
financial situation changes." It is good to know that for the
immediate future, not much will change.
Obviously, not everyone agrees this is a crisis. I spoke
with Matthew Tilghman 'O9, an economics major and my
freshman year roommate. He assured me that "U.S. GDP
growth is going to be positive for this year. It's not even a
depression, I'm not going to call it that. Yes. There may be
a recession." But of course, for those looking to work in
finance, "people's hopes are not so high." Matthew may
even be off to London next year, which might offer more
...

jobs.

So, has anything changed? I think back to the Crash
Bash. In a slightly portentous move, O'Neill and company
have already made (tentative) plans for a sequel, the
"Brother, Can You Spare Me A Dime?" party. However
inevitable this party may be, let's hope for the "Good
Times Are Here Again" equivalent.

Breaking rules, changing seasons
spoke of Hacker's confessional poetry with

BY ADRIANA POPA

apopal@swarthmore.edu

On Monday night, Swarthmore College
hosted a poetry reading by American poet,
critic and reviewer Marilyn Hacker. Known
to the literary world for a technique that
both respects and fractures the constraints
of form, Hacker has garnered praise for her
socially oriented and introspective art.
Recipient of the National Book Award, the

Bernard F. Conners Prize from the Paris
Review, the John Masefield Memorial
Award of the Poetry Society of America,
honored by the Guggenheim Foundation
and the Ingram Merrill Foundation, Hacker
has penned such esteemed works as
"Winter Numbers" (1994.

"Marilyn Hacker's artfully
embodies how sticking to
rules In one way allows you
to break rules in another."

Nathalie Anderson
Professor of English
Literature
The Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize and a
Lambda Literary Award), "Selected Poems,
1965-1990" (1994. The Poets' Prize), "Love,
Death and the Changing of the Seasons"
(1986), "Squares and Courtyards" (2000),
"Desesperanto: Poems 1999-2002" (2003) and
"Essays on Departure: New and Selected
Poems."

Alternating passionate readings with
witty remarks and humor, Hacker conveyed
themes of sexuality, religion, politics and
personal experience in a voice that borrowed the strange melody of Parisian
streets. As Professor of English Literature
Nathalie Anderson so eloquently explained
in her introduction, Hacker's work is a
charming combination of "audacity and vulnerability, of sensuality and wit." Anderson

great admiration: "Hacker is interested in
form not to write neat, but to see how far
she can push it, to explore its expressive
resources. Marilyn Hacker's art fully
embodies how sticking to rules in one way
allows you to break rules in another. There
is a certain unpredictability within predictability: predictability enables the surprise." Discussing Hacker's rule-breaking
life as a source of inspiration and her focus
on controversial issues, Anderson added,
"For Marilyn Hacker, breaking rules has a
profound meaning. It is not used to shock,
but as a topic submitted to the readers'
analysis
under which circumstances is it
good to break rules and what is the difference in significance if the rules we break
are those set by society or those set by ourselves? She writes about the details of her
life to help people identify and create a feeling of solidarity, of a systemic problem; not
our problem, but caused by the circum-

stances."

Hacker's poetry explores the importance
of friendship, ordinary life as an active
affirmation, the debt of social disconnection, sorrow for and of the 21st century,
death beyond our control, and social solidarity. On the question of why Hacker chose
ordinary life as one of her main sources of
inspiration
themes,
and recurrent
Anderson explained that "she chose snapshots of reality because it grounds us, it
makes us enjoy the moment and see the

beauty of everyday life."

"There isn't a more intimate
way of reading a poem than
by translating it."
Marilyn Hacker
American poet
The poet considers her first source of inspiration to have been her relationship with language, the passion for reading that she has
kept throughout her entire existence: "As a
so
child, I loved songs and nursery rhymes
I started to play and to try to create stanzas
like the ones I remembered. I think my first
literary attempts were in early adolescence
I read a lot, I enjoyed T. S. Eliot, Auden and
Lowell." When asked about her diverse literary activity, Hacker took a moment to reflect
on her work as a translator. "Translation," she
explained, "is a good way to work with your
ego somewhere else
There isn't a more intimate way of reading a poem than by translating it."
My last question to Marilyn Hacker was
about her advice to young writers. She immediately answered: "Read. A lot. And, if possible, in other languages."

Swarthmore alum Jumatatu Poe will return to campus this Sunday to share an
upcoming dance-theater murder mystery piece with the community.

BY SHAWN DOHERTY

sdohertl@swarthmore.edu

This Sunday, Oct. 5, Swarthmore
alum and Rhythm-N-Motion founder
Jumatatu Poe 'O4 will come to campus to
share some of his upcoming work with
the campus community. His performance will be part of the Windows on the
Work series hosted by the Music and
Dance Department to showcase last summer's Swarthmore Project Residency

recipients.

Poe will perform from his upcoming
work "Alibi," which he describes as a
dance-theater piece and a murder mystery. The piece focuses on the guilt of the
narrator and how he experiences images

of himself through the viewpoints of
other people and deals with being
accused of a crime he says he didn't commit. Poe compares the tone ofAlibi to an
old Hitchcock movie: sarcastic, ironic,

playful and mysterious.
The performance will take place in
the Troy Dance Studio and will be followed by an audience question and
answer session. Poe believes this informal setting is extremely appropriate,
because Alibi is not yet a finished product. He says, "This will be a good opportunity to receive feedback and get some
performance practice."
Much of Alibi was developed during
Poe's time with the Swarthmore Project
summer.
Residency
this
Art
Administration Intern Liza Clark
described this program as an opportunity for two or three dancers or companies,
usually with some prior connection to
the college, to live on campus and use the
performance space for a week or two
over the summer. Then, during the academic year these dancers or companies
return to campus and share some of
their work with the students. The two
weeks thatPoe spent working on Alibi in

October 2, 2008

July allowed the project to evolve from a
trio to a quintet comprised of Poe,
Lindsay Browning, Karama Butler,
Krystle Henry and John Luna.
Poe's interest in dance first became
serious when he took African dance as

a Swarthmore student. Out of this
interest, student dance group RhythmN-Motion emerged. Poe says the group
grew out of the desire of a group of
friends to have an outlet for performing the dances they grew up with. At
first, the group performed mostly hiphop, dancehall (a Caribbean version of
hip-hop), and Latin dances like salsa.
The group soon diversified, however,
and it started to incorporate contemporary African dance and other dances of
the African Diaspora to its performances. Poe says, "My experience with
Rhythm-N-Motion was really great. It
is one of the reasons I developed a
strong interest in performing and it
gave me an outlet to do so."
Now Poe is back on campus not only
as part of the Swarthmore Project

Residency

but also as a visiting
instructor for Modern Repertory and
Modern 111. He describes being back on
campus and teaching dance classes as a
little surreal. However, he says his students have been working really hard,
and says, "It's nice to have that Swattie
work ethic in class." Poe tries to take a
new approach to teaching dance and
believes it is a good experience both for
himself and for his students.
Besides focusing on "Alibi" and
teaching at Swarthmore, Poe is currently teaching dance classes at Rowan
University and the University of the
Arts as well as performing for a few
companies in Philadelphia. When
asked about his packed schedule, Poe
replies, "I guess that's just what
Swarthmore prepares you to do, to
have a life of being busy."

Titus Andronicus' airing of grievances at Olde Club
BY EMILY CRAWFORD

ecrawfol@swarthmore.edu
Earlier this year, New Jersey indie-rockers Titus
Andronicus were bestowed with Pitchfork Media's coveted title of "Best New Music." Especially lauded for
their raucous live shows, the acrimonious Glen Rock
quintet fully lived up to its reputation at Olde Club last
Friday. Though their set was relatively short it accelerated like a shot of adrenaline propelled by racing guitar
and frontman Patrick Stickles' impassioned screams.
Moshing and crowd-surfing prevailed throughout the
show, reaching a peak when at one point Stickles himself
leaned off the stage into the arms of the crowd, all the
while screeching into his microphone. The best part
about Titus Andronicus is that their extreme energy
doesn't detract from the intellectualism of their music;
their lyrics are full to the brim with literary references
songs like "Albert Camus" and "Fear and Loathing in
Mahwah, NJ" are prime examples. Right down to the
name Titus Andronicus, which the band shares with the
not-so-obscure Shakespeare play, they have perfected the
strange yet powerful combination of punk-rock and academia that makes them ideal for college listeners. I was
able to sit down with band members Patrick Stickles, lan
Graetzer, Eric Harm, Andrew Cedermark, and lan
Patrick O'neill before the show last Friday to discuss
everything from New Jersey to existentialism; here's
what they had to say.

Emily Crawford: So, what do you think of
Swarthmore so far?
Patrick Stickles: Yeah, it's pretty rad here.
Eric Harm: Lots of cool buildings.
PS: Yeah, it's got a touch of "old world charm."
EC: There are a lot of literary references in your work.
Are you especially inspired by literature? Did anything
particularly provoke this focus?
PS: Yeah, I mean, it was the thing to do. College, you
know how it is, you have a lot of reading to do—lt's all
you do. And then you write about it.
Lan Graetzer: It would probably be good to mention
that you wrote all the songs in college...
PS: Yeah, that's right, I did write almost all the songs

while we were in college. There are a few high school
ones in there too.
EC: So did you guys first start playing music together

in college?

PS: Yeah, but we went to different colleges. Some are
college friends. That's definitely when we got our start,
at least and when I wrote the songs.
EC: There are particularly a lot ofAlbert Camus references in your lyrics and obviously the song called "Albert
Camus." Are any ofyou big fans of his? Was he a particular influence in college while you were writing the songs?
PS: Yeah, I love him. I read him more in high school,

Questioning the conception of gender in 'The Graduate'

JOEL SWANSON
They're Watching
When I signed up to write this column
film this semester, I expected to
devote most of my columns to reviewing
specific movies. When I wrote my first column about "The Graduate," I intended to
raise valid questions about the merits ofits
status as Swarthmore's unofficial movie,
but I never for a second expected my column to occasion the kind of response that
it did. Ever since I wrote it, people have
been responding to me with their own
opinions about the movie and about my
critique, both supportive and critical of
me, both casually and through columns
and letters in The Phoenix. Perhaps I will
about

THE PHOENIX

go down in Swarthmore history as the
annoying guy who made everyone question the value of a relatively insignificant
movie. I suppose there are worse things to
be known for and I am both pleased and
humbled that anything I write is worthy of
this kind of discussion. Nevertheless, I feel
I must take this opportunity to respond to
some of the criticisms leveled against my
column, and lay out my vision of the role of
popular culture criticism in a broader
social context.
One of the most cogent criticisms made
of my column on "The Graduate" is that I
assumed that the film is unambiguously
of Benjamin
Braddock's
supportive
actions, while he is actually portrayed as a
frightened, unsure man on the verge of
adulthood who is not yet ready to take full
responsibility for his actions. That is all
very true. But nevertheless,
"The
Graduate" still views the relationship
between Benjamin and Elaine Robinson
purely through Benjamin's lens. We don't
get to see many of Elaine's feelings about

their interactions and thus the film denies
her agency as a character. A more balanced take on their relationship would let
us see both perspectives.
Yes, the final shot of the movie, where
Elaine and Benjamin stare at each other
nervously on the bus, unsure whether or
not they have made the right decision, does
suggest that maybe Benjamin has not
behaved in the most appropriate manner.
But if he has behaved inappropriately, it is
primarily because he has not considered
the implications of his actions for himself

and his future. There is little indication
that the film is critiquing him for inappropriately impinging upon Elaine's wedding
without her consent. It is certainly possible to speculate that Elaine may not want
to be married at all, but we do not have any
basis for making that claim, which is pre-

cisely the problem. "The Graduate" does
not permit us to consider Elaine's side of
the story at all, which limits it to being a
film about a privileged white male's view
on relationships.

"The Graduate" does not
permit us to consider
Elaine's side of the story
at ail
And yes, I understand that I am writing
this column as a privileged white male,
which brings me to a larger point about
popular culture criticism. Popular culture
does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, it is a
reflection or critique of the prevailing values of the society in which it emerges.
Unfortunately, we live in a patriarchal,
racist, heterosexist, economically divided
society and the movies that our society
makes reflect this reality, whether critically or uncritically. Popular culture, be it
film, music, television, literature, or any
other medium, privileges certain individuals and subgroups by offering them a voice.

October 2, 2008

It can either offer this voice to those who
already have power, or it can attempt to
provide a medium for those who have been
disenfranchised. "The Graduate" chooses
to provide a voice to the sort of patrician
white males who rarely have trouble having their views heard through more official channels, such as the political process.
Just look at most members of Congress.
If I, as someone who belongs to many

privileged subgroups within our society,
were to simply watch movies and consume
other forms of popular culture and not
question the ways in which they fit into a
larger social context, I would merely be
acquiescing to the unequal and unjust
state of society today. I wrote my column
about "The Graduate" mainly because it
concerned me that people were simply
watching the movie the night before classes and accepting it as it is. If I got people to
question the film's conceptions of gender,
then I accomplished my goal. I am certainly not saying that everyone or anyone has
to come to the same conclusions that I did
about the movie; I am not even sure if I did
come to the proper conclusions. But thinking about the ways in which our culture
supports or undercuts our assumptions is
usually a worthwhile endeavor.

I like film; I wouldn't write this column
if I didn't. But what I really like is questioning the ways in which our culture contributes to or struggles against our culture
of oppression and in some small way, that's
what I hope to do.

Understanding the financial crisis: A primer in economic disaster
Almost 80 years later, it is still embarrassing to admit that this newspaper
entirely failed to cover the most significant economic crisis that has ever faced
this country: the Great Depression.
According to The Phoenix of the day, a bitter power struggle between a local chicken farm and the Arboretum, the planting
of some trees on campus, and a six week
feature on the debate regarding wearing
blazers at meals in Sharpies were all more
news-worthy than the complete collapse
of the American economy.
Rest assured we will not make that
mistake again.
What, exactly, is going on?
In the days following the collapse of
A.1.G.,
Lehman
Brothers
and
Freakonomics author Steven Levitt
wrote, on his New York Times blog, "To be
honest, I haven't got the foggiest idea
what this all means." Mr. Levitt was not
alone. While Monday's 700-point slide in
the Dow Jones industrial average makes
for frightening infographics (such as
Tuesday morning's New York Times
cover, which featured a line graph seemingly pointing only downwards, there's a
lot more at work than just a stock slump.
This present fiasco went public on
Sept. 8, when the federal government

nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, two long-ailing financial services
companies. The problem with Fannie and
Freddie was their lack of liquidity: essentially, both firms had complicated balance
sheets of assets and liabilities, but no real,
immediate ability to generate cash. In the
same sense that a student with an empty
wallet who loaned money to friends can't
use those loans to pay for groceries,
Fannie and Freddie were unable to meet
their short-term obligations. With combined assets of over $5 trillion, the tendrils of the two firms reached all ends of
the economy, and the impact of their failure would have been of an unimaginable
scale. Intending to avert disaster, the government stepped in, with their nationalization essentially making the government a guarantor of their loans.
The next phase was the Sept. 15 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, a massive
investment bank. Clocking in at over $6OO
billion in assets, Lehman Brothers handily shattered the previous record for the
world's largest bankruptcy, set in 2002 by
WorldCom. The very next day, insurance
and financial services giant A.1.G., suffering from the same sort of liquidity problems faced by Fannie and Freddie, was
thrown an $B5 billion lifeline by the Fed,
keeping the $1 trillion company and its
100,000 employees from going under.
In subsequent weeks, a series of other
big names in banking and finance collapsed. Merril Lynch, unable to escape
from $52 billion worth of bad decisions,
was sold to Bank of America. Washington
Mutual, the largest savings and loan association (the technical term for what we'd
call a bank) in the United States, filed for
Chapter 11 on Sept. 26, the day after the
119th anniversary of its founding, following a bank run of a scale not seen since
1929. Many smaller banks have also felt
the pinch.
What caused Lehman Brothers, a firm
which was founded in 1850, A.1.G., the 18th
largest company in the world, and

16

Washington Mutual, America's largest

thrift (again, a term which boils down to

what people commonly think of as a bank)
to collapse? Arguably, many of their problems can be traced back to the billions of
dollars in defaulted subprime loans they
had to accept as losses earlier this year.
And what, exactly, is a subprime loan?
That's a longer story.
What caused all this madness?
The great villain of our story is The
Subprime Loan, a spectre that has been
haunting the world's economy since the
late 19905. The general idea is: banks give
out extremely risky loans to people with
bad credit on terms that are very favorable to the banks, on the assumption that
the money they stand to make from those
loans outweighs their inherent risks.
When their model works, everyone wins:
individuals with poor credit histories can
buy things (consumption, obviously, is
good for everyone), and banks reap massive profits.
Starting in 2006, though, the spiral
started to unwind. Instead of playing by
the rules and repaying their loans, individuals with bad credit did what individuals with bad credit do best: they defaulted on their loans, essentially sticking
banks with worthless properties (remember, the housing bubble "popped" around
this time) and massive losses. Over 100
subprime lenders went under around this
time.
But the subprime catastrophe didn't
end with the bankruptcy of the subprime
lenders themselves. Bad loans had embedded themselves throughout the rest of the
financial system, with big securities companies (such as, interestingly enough,
Merril Lynch and Lehman Brothers)
dressing up subprime loans to make them
more appealing to other investment banks
and hedge funds. Within a few months,
the ripple effects of the uptick in subprime defaults was affecting even relatively distant sectors of the economy.
Wall Street wasn't quite done digging
its own grave, though. A whole collection
of diabolical new ways to make money
emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s:
just one example is the fiendish creditdefault swap, or CDS. Considering that

The Economist valued the market for
CDSs at $62 trillion on Sept. 18, one might
expect that most people would have at
least a vague understanding of what a
credit-default swap actually is.
As best we've been able to divine, a
CDS resembles an insurance policy on
loans, in that lenders can use them to
insure against defaults. But unlike every

other insurance policy on the planet, a
CDS doesn't actually have to refer to any
loan in particular: brokerages can trade
in "debt" as an abstract idea, with the
value of such trades increasing or
decreasing in value as theriskiness of the
"debt" changes. Practically, when loan

defaults increase, banks involved in CDSs
lose massively. The fact that there is $62
trillion worth of this nonsense in the
economy is rightfully horrifying.
And CDSs aren't the only factors leading to the recent demise of banks. Wall
Street has created, over a period of
decades, an impenetrable web of arcane
policies, procedures, and ways to make
exorbitant amounts of money. In short,
the present financial crisis is the product
of years of poor choices finally returning
home to Wall Street.
What's the deal with this bailout, anyway?
Enter the supposed savior of our economy, The Bailout. Attempting to address
criticisms of the government's seemingly
inconsistent handling of Fannie and
Freddie (save), Lehman Brothers (allow to
fail), and A.I.G. (save), Ben Bernanke (the
chairman of the Federal Reserve), Hank
Paulson (the treasury secretary), and
leaders of Congress have worked on hammering out a more systematic way to give
the economy a life preserver.
The plan, fleshed out this weekend,
would create the Troubled Asset Relief
Program, designed to relieve banks of
their most problematic investments.
Here's the basic idea: the government
would be able to purchase up to $7OO billion worth of risky mortgages and mortgage-related assets (remember those
CDSs?), sticking taxpayers with the bur-

den of what The Economist calls "toxic
debt." The end result, Messrs. Paulson
and Bernanke contend, would be the
restoration ofa more normal lending market in the United States: consumers would
still be able to obtain home, car, and student loans, albeit at higher interest rates,
and a depression caused by an abrupt
decline in consumer spending would be
averted. The details of the plan, of course,
are more complicated and ill-understood,
a problem in and of itself, but economists
have, largely, found the Troubled Asset
Relief Program to be a sound solution.
But the bailout package, passed by the
Senate, failed in the House on Monday,
triggering the aforementioned 700-point
drop in the Dow Jones. Whatever its economic merits, it gained a reputation
amongst a befuddled public as a "taxpayer-financed parachute for high-flying Wall

Street tycoons," as The New York Times
colorfully described it on Tuesday. But the
rhetoric of the Times is disingenuous: voters miss the point of the legislation
(ensuring that they are still able to borrow money, thereby keeping the economy
afloat) and only get the secondary point
that, as a consequence of keeping the
economy running, the government is also
keeping risk-taking banks solvent.
With a new vote scheduled in the
Senate for Wednesday night, hope
remains that a more comprehensive solution will still emerge before the end of the
week.

Okay, I get it. But what should the government actually be doing?
The government, or more specifically,
the House of Representatives, should be
passing whatever form of the Troubled
Asset Relief Program next comes up for a
vote. The confluence of electoral politics,
misguided populism, and ignorance about
economics led to the proposal failing the
first time. The House cannot allow this to
happen again. If a successful vote comes
by attaching popular riders, such as tax
breaks for companies implementing green
policies or an increase in the FDIC guarantee of bank deposits to $250,000 (a measure both Barack Obama and John McCain

have endorsed), so be it.
In the longer term, extensive regulatory changes need to take place so that such
a problem can never emerge again. The
Kiplinger Business Resource Center suggests two such categories of changes:
oversight and simplification. The first is a
refraction of the strategy implemented
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after Enron
collapsed in 2001: when companies misbehave, make the government party to more
of their intimate details. Increased disclosure ofbalance sheets only serves to make
companies more accountable to their
shareholders, and to the American public.
The second, simplification, means
changing how financial markets operate
on a very basic level. The reason subprime loans became so problematic was
because banks spread them throughout
the economy in an attempt to diffuse their
risk, a practice which is only moderately
dangerous and unlikely to go away.
Rather, regulators need to crack down on
the exotic ways in which banks go about
diffusing that risk. (Herein, the CDS once
more rears its ugly head.) It can't be
expected that every American understand
everything about how financial markets
work, but making things a little less
opaque is certainly a step in the right
direction.

Venezuela and Russia

In May of 2001, during his
first visit to Moscow, Chavez
announced the birth of a

Cam-bur-pin-ton

"future strategic alliance"
between Russia and Venezuela.
At the time, his statement was
not taken very seriously (to
say the least). Political analysts
and intellectuals laughed at
Chavez's overzealous claims to
have become an important
political actor on a global scale.
It turns out, however, that
Chavez's mention of a new
"strategic alliance" was by no
means a joke. In fact, RussoVenezuelan relations are get-

more.edu.

THE PHOENIX

A
dressing

ting stronger every day.

Chavez has visited Russia

twice in the past three months.
After the first visit two
Russian bomber planes landed
on Venezuelan soil to conduct the so-called "test flights" that I
mentioned in my last column. If this was cause for controversy,
then the result of Chavez's most recent trip to Moscow is even
more worrisome: Venezuela has agreed to purchase one billion
dollars worth of military equipment from the Russian government. Reliable sources mentionedthat on Chavez's shopping list
planes, various other models of
are several
fighter jets, and bullet-proof vehicles for transporting ground
troops.
The reasons behind Chavez's focus on strengthening
Venezuela's military power are not entirely clear. One reason
might be that Venezuela's current military arsenal is mainly
comprised of North American machinery, and the functioning of
this machinery is dependent on replacement parts that are only
produced in the USA. Since the USA has placed an embargo on
these parts, Chavez has chosen to do business elsewhere in an
attempt to reduce Venezuela's dependency on the United States.
The question that remains, however, is why now?
On the one hand, domestically speaking, Chavez has more
than enough reasons to divert the public's attention. The latest
polls indicate that Chavez's candidates are bound to lose in the
upcoming regional elections in November. Additionally, the
Human Rights Watch report entitled A Decade Under Chavez has
fueled many discussions concerning Human Rights violations in
Venezuela. The author of this report was expelled from
Venezuelan territory shortly after it was published. On top of
this, Guido Antonini's trial concerning the illegal trafficking of
Venezuelan funds to finance Cristina Kirshner's presidential
campaign has brought the corrupt tendencies of the Chavez
administration to the forefront of Venezuelan politics.
Given this context, Chavez's recent political moves are rather
transparent. It is clear that he wants the country to be thinking
about how to protect itself from the threat of an American military offensive against Venezuela. Although the plausibility of an
offensive of this sort is highly questionable, Chavez's current
political rhetoric centers on it. On the other hand, the political
partnership between Russia and Venezuela is partly based on the
premise that the United States is losing prominence in the global arena. In the US's "back yard" the heads of state in Nicaragua,
Bolivia and Ecuador espouse strong anti-American political
views. The recent conflict in Georgia (perhaps the first military
show-down between Russia and USA since the days of the USSR)
has heightened tensions between the White House and the
Kremlin. Some sources point to the fact that as a result of these
tensions, Russia's foreign policy sees the leftist regimes in Latin
America as fertile ground for the extension of its sphere of influence. The military negotiations between Russia and Venezuela
could very well be the start of the return of Russian influence in
Latin America. As it stands, the stage is set for the comeback of
Cold War politics and Venezuela is right in the middle of it.
That said, the results of the presidential race between Obama
and McCcain will undoubtedly impact the political dynamics of
our hemisphere. What is at stake in these upcoming elections is
more than improvement of healthcare in the United States and
an "effective" exit strategy from Iraq. Up to now, Chavez has
based his rhetoric on the negative track record of US involvement inLatin American politics. History is his best ally in claiming that the US does not respect the sovereignty of Latin
American countries and is planning to take him out of power.
What will happen if the next American president is willing to
meet and negotiate with Chavez? Would Chavez's theories seem
plausible if the White House improved its relations with Latin
America?

The Margo Channing
what is it about
Report
[;■' the act of male

cross-dressing
that intrigues
the masses? Just the very notion of a man performing
female gender seems so transgressive, so taboo and yet
films such as Some Like It Hot (Wilder, 1959) and Tootsie
(Pollack, 1982) are often viewed as innocuous, feel good
fare. It is precisely because these films veil important
and often controversial issues of gender and sexuality
that they are such integral cultural artifacts.
Some Like It Hot is the story of two good-for-nothing
1920s jazzbos who find themselves on the run from the
Chicago mob. And what better way to avoid getting lead
in your navel than joining a female band and heading to
Florida? Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis play the two
blokes in question and, while the story provides obvious
comedy, things get... we 11... complicated once our protagonists get on that train to Florida, in full drag and all.
For it represents not only a mode of transportation, but
a mode of transformation. This new setting marks the
audiences' first glimpse at a truly feminine homosocial
space. Women outnumber men in the diegesis. And all
the women in the scene are jazz musicians, nonetheless!
But the train ride also marks the entrance of Sugar
Kane (played with aplomb by Marilyn Monroe), the ditsy
bombshell whose voluptuous figure and sultry purr
threaten to blow Joe/Josephine (Curtis) and
Jerry/Daphne (Lemmon) right out of the water. From
that point on, there seems to be a suggestion that the best
way for a man to get with a woman is to become a
woman. Take Joe/Josephine's first amorous encounter
with Sugar, when she pulls him/her aside into a bathroom where they have a conversation about Sugar's
complicated past with men. She admits to being a
masochist, a sucker for saxophone players with abusive
tendencies. Sugar's vulnerability and the ease with
which she sets up an intimate rapport with
Joe/Josephine all hinge on his/her presumed femaleness. And Joe/Josephine's attraction to Sugar is relayed
by a medium shot ofhis/her faqe gazing in awe and wonder at his/her love object. It is important to note that
Joe/Josephine's gaze is not one of lascivious possession,
but rather one of recognition. Ironically enough, Sugar's
description of the men in her life reflects Joe to a tee.
This brings about a change in Joe/Josephine's conception of his/her male self. Whereas before he viewed
women with a casual indifference to their emotional
states of being, Joe/Josephine becomes consumed in the
quest for one woman's affection. And as the narrative
progresses he/she becomes less concerned with getting

October 2, 2008

he/she wants and more concerned with making
sure that Sugar finds happiness, or as she puts it, "the
sweet end of the lollipop." In one of the most bizarre,
hilarious but ultimately controversial subplots of the
film dandy millionaire Osgood Fielding HI (Joe E.
Brown) openly courts Jerry/Daphne much to his/her dismay. But as Osgood persists, strangely enough
Jerry/Daphne warms up to the idea of being with a man.
During a date at a Floridian nightclub, Jerry/Daphne
and Osgood progress from awkward miscommunication
to full on tango revelry. Jerry/Daphne spends the morning after lying in bed reliving the night, vivaciously
humming a sensuous tango theme over and over.
He/she even accepts Osgood's marriage proposal. When
Joe/Josephine points out the problems the relationship
presents Jerry/Daphne sighs, "I'm never gonna find
another man who's so good to me!" Obviously this scenario brings up notions of homosexuality. But more than
that, there runs throughout the film, an assertion that
man can reach his human potential by changing gender.
Tootsie is a bit more explicit in its interrogation of
man's role in feminist discourse, as Michael Dorsey
(Dustin Hoffman) is a two-bit actor who dresses in drag
to illicitly appear as a female character on a soap only to
adlib and improvise his/her own feminist interpretations of the script. Dorothy Michaels, as Michael calls
his alter ego, becomes a phenomenon.
The film is convoluted with various subplots and
comedic mishaps, most notably John Van Horn's
(George Gaynes) misogynistic attempts to earn
Michael/Dorothy's affection. Nevertheless, it is again
female homosociality that sheds light on the protagonist's growth as a character. In a scene that mirrors the
what

exchange between Joe/Josephine and Sugar in Some
Like It Hot, Michael/Dorothy sits down to a sip of champagne with Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), his/her badly
type-casted, yet exceedingly attractive co-star. While
they sip idly Julie illustrates her dream scenario: meeting a man who is truly honest, who doesn't purport to
have all the answers. She expresses disgust at the 'Bos
"macho man" archetype. Michael/Dorothy not only realizes the depths of his/her attraction to Julie but is also
exposed to an unglamorous flip side of Julie's "hot
nurse" TV persona. Julie is a single mother who floats
through a series of loveless relationships, burying her
sorrows in alcohol. But men are not privy to this facet of
her life. They are only shown her commodified, hypersexual iconography via the entertainment industry.
Again, it is because of an exchange predicated on female
intimacy that male desire is developed. Not that this is
entirely unproblematic. For there is an obvious air of
deception here. But it does present new possibilities for
male/female interaction. As Michael exclaims at the end,
he and Dorothy are the same person; he just needs "to
learn to do it without the dress."
Despite their box office appeal, movies featuring men
who cross-dress are ... deep! Although, it seems that the
popularity of such films prevents further analysis,
because the main draw of such movies has been the
opportunity to see men look funny in dresses. (I mean,
do you honestly think that if John McCain read this
analysis, Some Like It Hot would still be under his
Facebook "Favorite Movies" section?) But a truly good
cross-dressing movie goes beyond that initial gimmick
into oft-unexplored terrain. It remains to be seen if the
movie industry can really be co-opted for truly cultural
purposes if the ed in edutainment isn't more heavily
emphasized.

face a whole host of
issues that will not be
able to be explained
away or swept under
the rug, specifically
one which the Bush
administration and

Congress recently handled better than expected.
The issue at hand: the AIDS epidemic. Over the summer,
Congress passed H.R. 5501, thus reauthorizing PEPFAR, the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The bill, also
known as the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States
Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, was then signed into law
on July 30,2008, by President George W. Bush. Thebill expands
efforts by the United States to lead the global fight against
HTV/AEDS, and provides $4B billion (triple current funding levels) to 15 countries most affected by HTV/AIDS, the largest contribution by any individual nation to the global fight. The goal
of the legislation is to prevent 7 million news cases of HTV, treat
2 million people infected with HTV, and provide care for 10 million people infected with HTV/AIDS and affected by those infected with HTV/AIDS. The bill also repeals the HTV travel ban,
which disallowed HIV-positive immigrants and visitors to the

United States.
Though the passage of H.R. 5501 is a great move for the current leadership in continuing the fight against HTV/AIDS,
much more must stillbe done. New cases in developing nations
are still cropping up at alarming rates, especially in subSaharan Africa, and numbers of new HTV infections in the U.S
continue to rise. For the fight to end in victory, more nations
must make a combinedpledge to contribute funding to slow the

HIV/AIDS

spread of the AIDS epidemic beyond its current levels. Citizens
of the developed countries have a moral obligation to ease the
suffering of those affected by this epidemic, resulting from
their historical and economic relationships to those developing
nations. And although the United States can do much to lead
the fight against the spread of HTV/AIDS, other developed
nations cannot deny that they also have a moral duty to contribute more to the fight.
Another essential step in combating the spread of HTV/AIDS
is addressing social factors thatcontribute to alarming increases in rates of infection in certain demographics. According to
UNATDS, some of these factors include gender inequality, marginalization of LGBT people, drug use, the sex industry,
extreme poverty coupled with lack of information or education,
and conflict in unstable regions. The marginalization of these
populations by other segments of society perpetuates the conditions that have thus far allowed for the rampant spread of
HTV across the globe and stigmatized those living with the disease. Any solution to the ADDS epidemic must include responses to these factors, which is why PEPFAR solutions must be
sensitive to the cultural contexts in which the epidemic is
occurring. This is true whether the context is local or interna-

tional.
While PEPFAR only applies to other nations, the factors listed by UNABDS are similarly at play in the United States.
Among the 2006 results from the CDC's HTV incidence surveillance system are estimates that 46 percent of new HTV infections occurred among African Americans, 36 percent occurred
among Whites and 18 percent occurred among Latinos.
Furthermore, 73 percent of new HTV infections occurred among
males, and 72 percent of new HTV infections among males were
among men who have sex with men. The increase in HTV infections, as measured by the CDC, is unacceptable in our nation,
and is intertwined with issues of identity along with economic
ones. We must take a stand now against the injustice that is the
AIDS epidemic, and battle the racism, homophobia, classism,
stigmatization of those infected with HTV, and marginalization
of communities in order to effectively campaign against HTV.
The people being infected every day are our neighbors, our
loved ones, our friends, and our community members. While
most in our generation have, for the most part, not had to deal
with losing someone they cared about to HTV/AIDS, rising rates
of infection will change this fact for many of you.
If you are serious about battling the HTV/AIDS epidemic,
take your first step on Sunday, October 19 by participating in
AIDS Walk Philly 2008.

Clothesline may also alienate
To the Editor:
I would first of all like to commend the work
of all those who organized and participated in
the Clothesline Project. I recognize that the
Project, along with the Handprint Project and
the White Ribbon Project, has helped empower
many survivors and enabled them to give voice
to their experiences.
I, however, am a survivor, and as a survivor
felt pressured and alienated during the ten days
of this project and preceding days of publicity.
Everywhere I turned every dorm, every bathroom, Sharpies, in front of Parrish, on a student's shirt during seminar
I was forced to
confront my assault. I feel that the barrage of
flyers and ribbons removed my safe space to not
think about my assault, to cope with it (or not)
in my own way, in my own time, and in my own
space (as opposed to in public, at every class,
and at every meal).
I also felt that as one choosing not to be part
of the survivor community that I was somehow
doing something wrong
that those involved
in the Project were handling their experiences
the way one should and since I wasn't doing it
that way I was clearly not doing the right thing.
Though I'm sure that wasn't the purpose, the
intended advocacy of the Project felt normative
to me. It certainly made me feel more alone.
I understand the intent and the largely positive effects of the Project and again commend
those involved. I, however, can on them to
understand and respect that there are those of
us out there who have experienced sexual misconduct and do not feel that this Project is how
we wish to express or confront those experiences. I would ask for the committee to think of
ways to make the Project less pervasive in
every corner of campus life. I understand the
worthy goal of raising awareness, but I ask the
committee to consider at what cost it comes.

A tale of two bracelets: Iraq views manifested in metal

WILL GLOVINSKY

The Commotion
Bracelets haven't gotten this much play
since middle school.
When McCain introduced the "Don't let
my son die in vain" bracelet in the first
presidential debate, I was truly moved by its
poignancy. I fully expected Obama to give a
characteristically erudite and wordy
response. But instead of that potential bungle, lo! another bangle. This one bore the
message, "Don't let another mother feel my
pain."
In a way/it's fitting that the candidates
both represented America's contrasting
views on the ever-mounting casualties of

18

the War in Iraq through the same piece of
jewelry. The bracelets represent a point of
fundamental disagreement between the candidates: McCain believes that the loss of
lives in Iraq is further reason to stay the
course there, and Obama that it is proof that
our strategy is unsustainable.
Obama's bracelet, although centered on
pain, actually reflects a very rationalist attitude. It says we should not be influenced
by—as callous as it sounds—sunk costs, but
rather should think about the future and
how to best prevent further unnecessary
suffering. It says that one bereaved family
is less awful than two, and you have to defy
number theory to get around that.
But when you can't beat a statement
with logic, there's a good chance you can
challenge it with emotional appeal and a
dose of rhetoric about honor. And that's
precisely what McCain's bracelet does.
What meaning does the death of an
American soldier have if the mission is
declared unworthy? That a soldier dies
fighting for a good cause is one of the few
solaces for the soldier's family. Take that
away, the bracelet argues, and the death
loses its meaning.
We could leave the issue there—just as
Obama and McCain chose to leave the two
views as distinct pieces of metal in the
minds of viewers. After all, any attempt to
see this matter as anything other than two
inherently opposing viewpoints would

require concessions from both camps. So
perhaps we should not press the issue.
Or should we? At the risk of sounding
proverbial, we have two wrists, and can

wear both bracelets. Can we reconcile the
seemingly contradictory views?
Let's begin by analyzing McCain's
bracelet. What does it want? That's easy
enough: it wants to preserve the honor of a
soldier's death. Americans have always
been proud of military service because we
see ourselves as a democratizing, liberating
force of good, and therefore a soldier's life is
never lost in vain. If the righteousness of
the mission is called into question, so is the
price that is paid to accomplish it. This formula used to serve Americans well even
when we provoked unjustified wars because
during our first hundred and seventy or so
years as a nation we always won, and, as the
victors, we could celebrate wars and write
their histories as we pleased. Then, after
World War 11, we hit a losing streak.
As a POW, McCain was profoundly
affected by America's withdrawal from
Vietnam, and last week's debate showed
just how raw those wounds remain. When
Jim Lehrer asked about the lessons of Iraq,
McCain, who has often said we could have
won in Vietnam with more troops, said, "We
are winning in Iraq. And we will come
home with victory and with honor." In
McCain's world, and that of his bracelet,
victory and honor conspicuously go hand in

Qctpber 2, 2008

hand. Even in a war that should not have

been waged in the first place, victory, rather
than justification, determines the honor of

the day.

As long as this attitude is pervasive in
America, we will continue to chase the
honor of our fallen soldiers to all the wrong
places. By pegging the honor of soldiers to
the conflicts in question, we conflate the soldiers with the politicians who send them in
harm's way. For the soldier, honor is inherent in his or her personal sacrifice, while it
is politicians whose reputations rest on the
perceived necessity of a war. That is why we
can honor soldiers killed in action without
perpetuating a misguided war.
And Obama's bracelet? It argues its point
cogently, but itrubs many people the wrong
way because it neglects the topic just covered. And what of the dead soldier's honor?'
detractors fairly ask. Rather than simply
presenting the need to minimize further
casualties, Obama should have directly
addressed this question of honor, as it is of
crucial importance to military families.
Imagine how Obama would have
upstaged McCain if he had worn two
bracelets, and then proceeded to unite
Americans around the promise of their
shared meaning. Or maybe that would be a
little too gimmicky, and hardly feasible in
two minutes.

Media: flattery overblown
Yankees fans may think that

they're disappointed with the
2008 season. After watching
their team reach the postseason
every year since 1995, they saw
the Yanks fall behind early in
2008 and finish six games out of
the Wild Card and eight out of

the AL East's top slot. But it's
the FOX network that's truly
shedding tears this October.
October baseball in the Bronx
is such an easy story to promote: Show some daunting
JOSH ABEL
images of Yankee Stadium, pay
Called Third
homage to Ruth, DiMaggio and
m Mantle and replay a few Derek
Jeter playoff highlights. People
will watch not only the Yankees' loyal fan base, but also casual
sports viewers, because they've been taught that Yankees baseball.
And Red Sox vs. Yankees? Too easy. FOX doesn't even have to dig deep
into the archive for video of Aaron Boone's pennant-winner, David
Ortiz' heroics and Pedro Martinez' assault of the old, bald and spherical Don Zimmer to garner interest. These were great moments. They
were a lot offun to watch and definitely did the sport good. The 2003
and 2004 American League Championships Series between the
Yankees and Red Sox were phenomenally dramatic fights between
two deep, balanced teams.
But there will be no Yanks-Sox this October, because there will be
no Yankees at all. And so now FOX and ESPN and all the flapping
heads are reeling. In the wake of those great ALCSs, these media outlets commenced to turn Major League Baseball, and the playoffs in
particular, into Yanks-Sox. They relegated the rest of the sport to second billing. In some sense, it's understandable because it's just so
easy. As long as they put Red Sox vs. Yankees front and center, they
can just recycle all the old storylines from a few years ago, and all of
that rehashed hype will bring viewers. So Yanks-Sox always gets
national billing on FOX Saturday Baseball and ESPN Sunday Night
Baseball. Series after series we are told of the tremendous magnitude
of the-matchup. With this AL East rivalry so prominent, the rest of
the sport and its other great stories are underexposed. That's what's
so beautiful about the Tampa Bay Rays. The team that blew up this
readymade AL East storyline and won the division has been the definition of an afterthought. Certainly, they've earned their spot on the
back page of the sports section with too many losing seasons. But all
along, they've been stockpiling #1 draft picks and it was very clear
that some sort of explosion would soon be coming from Tampa Bay.
This story was unable to break through Yankees and Red Sox, however, and received very little preseason play.
This is excusable, because the Rays had not yet earned top billing
on the field they were all potential. What's inexcusableis that as the
Rays embarked on their 97-win season and took control of the division, the shoddy coverage persisted. Over the course of the season,
ESPN Sunday Night Baseball, which picks the game it will show only
a few weeks in advance, did not once elect to show the Rays. And as
the Rays put the finishing touches on their worst-to-first 2008 season
and clinched the highly competitive AL East, the baseball world's
focus turned to the sendoff to Yankee Stadium, hyping up the last few
weeks of games there. (The Yankees are moving across the street into
an almost exact replica of the soon-to-demolished venue it's not like
they're leaving New York.) The story of the Rays, who were winning
the division with a payroll 1/5 that of the Yankees and less than 1/3
that of the Red Sox, still could not take center stage.
It's as if it were predetermined that the Yankee Stadium sendoff
would be the new thread of the 2008 season in general and Yanks-Sox
in particular. But when the Rays arrived and created a real story,
"analysts" on Baseball Tonight and SportsCenter could not turn the
ship around to cover it because they had spent years reducing the
game down to the two traditional powerhouses. The Red Sox vs.
Yankees rivalry was something very special at its peak and continues to be a great subplot to a Major League season. But all these
mainstream sports outlets were so overcome by the excitement of
those series and the enthusiasm they generated that they have tried
make that subplot the centerpiece of MLB in the years since. They
spent so much time and hype convincing people that Yanks-Sox was
the truly interesting story in baseball that they were handcuffed

Women's soccer falls to Conference nemesis
BY JARED NOLAN

inolanl@swarthmore.edu

Women's soccer lost to John Hopkins 1-0 last
Saturday in a soggy, rain-filled affair. Swarthmore's
overall record fell to 5-2 and the loss marked their first
Centennial Conference defeat of the season. The Blue
Jays, ranked 7th nationally, improved upon their
already undefeated record to 6-0-2 (2-0 CC).
The only goal of the match came in the 76th minute
when John Hopkins sophomore Rhiannon Desideri
crossed the ball to freshman Paulina Goodman.
Goodman split the Garnet defense and finished the
pass, kicking the ball by Swarthmore keeper Lauren
Walker 'O9. Walker finished the day with six saves. The
rain was undoubtedly a major factor in the outcome of
the game. Head Coach Todd Anckaitis and midfielders
Maggie DeLorme 'lO and Elizabeth Mills 11 all thought
that the Garnet should have come away with a victory.
Anckaitis noted that "[Johns Hopkins] had to feel
lucky getting out of there with a win." DeLorme said
that Swarthmore 'nominated the game."
According to Anckaitis, the Garnet "possessed
about 80 percent of the play" while besting John
Hopkins in the total shots category 17 to 1L "We played
a great brand of soccer," he said, "connecting on passes, working the ball through the midfield, lots of one
touch, two touch." Mills summed up her team's play
similarly. "We played really well in the middle of the
field and controlled the center," she said. So why,
therefore, did Swarthmore leave Maryland with a loss
recorded on their schedule?
Mills placed the blame on the inclement weather
conditions. She strongly felt that "the game should
have been cancelled." "The rain definitely affected the
play even though we controlled the ball," she said.
"The turf made our style of play completely ineffective." She noted that the field had a dome shape, and
this meant the center remained relatively puddle-free,
which is why the Garnet were able to control the play

when the Rays emerged.

Coverage of a team they had never talked about or hyped up
would not hold viewers' attention. So the Rays remainedoff the front
page, though they took over first place. FOX and ESPN, by grabbing
after the immediate viewers and pandering to the craze over the one
great rivalry, hurt themselves in the long run by flattening the sport
to this one dimension, so that coverage of other compelling stories
can no longer sell like the top-notch sports stories they truly are.
There may be a great series between AL East rivals this October, but
not the ones we were told to care about, so viewer interest will suffer.

THE PHOENIX

she said.
Swarthmore was able to maintain possession but
many of their attacks fizzled out due to the wet conditions. Johns Hopkins was not able to retain control of
the ball, so they were forced to implement a different
strategy. "Hopkins resorted to the long ball because
they couldn't seem to possess," Anckaitis said.
The tough loss was expounded by the fact that the
Blue Jays have become the rival of Garnet soccer. Last
year's matchup also ended in a 1-0 victory by Johns
Hopkins. "There is a rivalry with Haverford because
of the school rivalry but our true rival is with
Hopkins," Anckaitis said. DeLorme agreed. "It was a
hard loss because Hopkins is one of our greatest competitors," she said, "but we have to take it in stride."
The Garnet has now finished a challenging first
half of the season, in which they have had success
against many teams that went to the NCAA tournament last year. "We've been tested early and often and
I'm excited about how our team has responded,"
Anckaitis said. The rest of the matches are mostly
against Centennial Conference opponents, and
Swarthmore should continue its success: "we're poised
to make a great run," Ankaitis said. He noted that the
team has performed well in the first halfof the season
and he is proud of them, but he added a caveat in the
words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: "Great is the
art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending." See
if the women's soccer team is up for the challenge
when they kick off the second halfof the regular season with a home match against Centennial Conference
foe McDaniel on Saturday, Oct. 4 at 7 p.m.

acco-

lades for their terrific ability to perform
their position better
than everyone else,
there are some athletes who show a
mastery of the game.

Consider that in his entire four-year career Twins
Catcher Joe Mauer struck out only once. Regardless, in
my opinion, the Cincinnati Reds are the most fortunate
team for having, who I believe, is the most "well rounded player in the game, Micah Owings. You may not
have heard of him, but this kid probably has more
potential in than anyone else in the sport of baseball.
I first heard of Micah Owings my senior year of
high school when he was playing at the University of
Tulane. My buddy was playing a college baseball video
game one day and I noticed that there was some pitcher on Tulane who was crushing home runs. No way, no
pitcher does that, that's why they pitch and hope to
play American League baseball. Three years later, in a

moment of nostalgia, I find myself wondering what
happened to that kid? Surely a weapon that can both
pitch and hit would be high on somebody's draft board?
Sure enough, over summer break this year I asked my
buddy what happened to that dude in the video game,
and found out that he was (then) Diamondbacks pitcher Micah Owings.
Well enough about me, let's get to Owings. He is a
big dude, standing 6'5" and weighing 225 pounds. You
already know that he is a pitcher who can hit but let me
break this down for you. In 2007 with the Arizona

October 2, 2008

Diamondbacks (his first year in the show) he registered an 8-8 record as a pitcher striking out 107 in 29
games played. That same year he had 60 at-bats and hit
.333. There are guys in the league who hit for a living
and can't even get over .300. Of Owings twenty hits that
year, twelve were for extra bases and four were home
runs. A pitcher who can hit like that radically changes
the game plan of any team involved since it is basically like having a designated hitter in the National
League. Listen to this: on Aug. 13, 2007, Owings started
an away game against the Atlanta Braves (his home
state). In said game he pitched 7 innings allowing 3
earned runs. Nothing special? Consider this: in that

game Owings went 4-5 at the dish knocking two
dingers, six RBl's and scoring four runs. Are you kidding me? That would be a wicked good night for Papi
let alone some 22-year-old kid pitcher. Still not
impressed? Later that same season Owings made a fillin start for Brandon Webb and pitched almost seven
shutout innings while hitting a perfect 4-4 at the plate
with three triples and three RBl's. That is insane; it's
like a little league game where the best athlete is the
pitcher and the best hitter. I would love to have Owings
on my team; he is such a versatile weapon.
Want some poetic justice? Earlier this month the DBacks dealt Owings to the Cincinnati Reds for strikeout King left fielder Adam Dunn. The very next day,
Owings smacked in the game winning run against the
Diamondbacks with a pinch-hit double in the tenth
inning. The pinch-hit specialist on the Reds might want
to start updating his resume. A kid like this is too good
to keep on the bench. In fact, there was a rumor circulated that Owings might start getting some reps at first
base on his off days so that he could keep his hitting
skills in the lineup. Did I mention that as a pitcher he
holds Georgia's high school home run record? He does,
and Georgia is not a state to take lightly in terms of
baseball prospects. To me the feats that Owings has
performed on the field are incredibly impressive.
Though his statistical numbers are not incredibly dominant, and the Reds are probably going nowhere in a
real hurry, Owings is the truth. Remember the name.

Fencing team trains for tough competition at Temple
Philadelphia.

BY NOLAN GEAR

ngearl@swarthmore.edu

In only their second year as an officially recognized club sport, the Swarthmore
fencing team is prepared to demonstrate
its versatility and skill this season.
Although their season hasn't officially
started, training is already in full swing.
This weekend the team had its first
event of the year, Camp Capin, a strategy
and technique-based clinic taught by
University of Florida fencing coach Bruce
Capin twice a year at Swarthmore. This is
the third time that Capin has come to
Swarthmore to give his workshop.
"It's an opportunity for the team to
train intensively for a weekend with a top

coach," Marshal Davis, who serves as
Head Coach of the Swat Fencing team,
said. "[Capin] was a member of the US
National Squad 9 or 10 years in a row. He
was the one who held the American flag
in the Moscow Olympic festival."
The clinic serves the needs of both
freshmen members and upperclassmen
desiring to push their technique to the
limit. Being coached by such an illustrious fencing expert allows students to
focus very intensely on strategy, and
allows the freshmen members, most of
whom are first-time fencers, an opportunity to truly develop their skills.
The fencing team is now poised to
begin its season. With the help of Coach
Davis and his wife, Assistant Coach Helen
Kaplan, the team is getting ready for its
first competition on November 15th: the
Temple Open at Temple University

in

"It's a great first tournament because
it's late enough in the school year," Saber
Captain Robert Mohr 'O9 said. "This way,
new fencers have already gained some
experience. And it's also good because it's
individually scored; it's a good diagnostic."
"There will be a lot of good fencers at
Temple," Foil Captain Fletcher Coleman
'O9 said. "It's mostly Division 1 athletes."
Still, Swarthmore is expected to do well at
their first tournament.
"It's individually scored, so it's an
opportunity for our stars to do well,"
Davis said. "Hopefully, we'll get some
finalists in the tournament."
The Temple Open is the second largest
collegiate fencing tournament in the
world, second only to the championships
for the US Association of Collegiate
Fencing Clubs, or USACFC, which
Swarthmore College will host in 2010.
Although it is less than two years old
as an official club sport, the Swarthmore
Fencing team has already made a name
for itself. Doug Woos, now a sophomore,
medaled at both USACFC and SAC championships last year, while sophomores
Jing Yi Ng and Natasha Tonge medaled at
SAC. At SAC, The Women's Epee and
Men's Foil teams got silver and bronze

medals, respectively.
With these recent successes in mind,
the Swat fencing team enters its second
season with understandably high expectations. The season will be marked by tournaments such as the Temple Open and the
Collegiate Invitational

New Mexico in Albuquerque. Notably,
Swarthmore is actually hosting the SAC
championships February Bth-9th, 2009.
Despite its immense success, the fencing team remains open to all newcomers.
Freshmen fencers, generally with no past
experience, vouch that the team is sup-

portive and receptive.
"Most of the practices are more like
lessons for the beginners," Tayarisha Poe

Coach Davis has extended an open
invitation to any members of the
Swarthmore community interested in
joining the fencing team.

Garnet field hockey suffers loss to fourth-ranked Johns Hopkins
BY DENNIS FAN
dfanl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Field Hockey

Team (3-6) tested their mettle against

Hopkins
fourth-ranked
Johns
University in a Centennial Conference
match-up this past weekend. The
Garnet's 7-0 loss to the Blue Jays put an
end to a two-game winning streak and
brought the team to 1-2 in Centennial
Conference play.
The women had come off of two
decisive victories over conference
rival Bryn Mawr College, 4-0, and
Arcadia University, 6-1, and hoped to
ride those victories into the game
against Johns Hopkins. Though the
Johns Hopkins game was not the
team's best performance, the women
were able to compete effectively and
make improvements.

Midfielder Joslyn Young 'lO put the
team's performance in perspective. "I
think our defensive marking got better
in the second halfand our communication across the field was improving,"
You said. "Most importantly, I think
that in comparison to our first
Centennial Conference game against
Ursinus, our team mentality was much
better. I could tell thatregardless of the
score no one ever gave up." Young also
led the team in scoring with four goals
during

Thursday's

match

against

Arcadia.

The Swarthmore women stayed
competitive throughout the entire
game. Seniors Ashley Gunter, Anna
Baeth were especially complimented

on their strong defensive presence.

October 2, 2008

Young commented that she "was
always confident that something good
would happen when they had the ball."
Jordan Schmidt 'O9 added that, "We
have a great passing game. We played
well against Hopkins and stayed with
them for most of the game." One of the
struggles facing this year's team is

their lack of numbers.
This weekend, the women had one
substitute for the entire 70-minute
match, though the situation against
Johns Hopkins may serve as a severe
example. The squad's small size has
been a handicap in previous matches.
"We've faced some teams with benches
bigger than our entire team," Hadley
Roach 'll said, adding that, "But we go
into every game ready to fight."
Though the lack of numbers comes
with adjustments and hardships for
individual players, when approached
about the team's size, the general attitude is very positive. Schmidt said,
"Well, we definitely have to be fitter
and play smart, team hockey, but I feel
we've been able to keep up with most
other teams this season."
However, with only 14 players on
the team, it is impossible to have 11-on-11 full field scrimmages and difficult to
engage in some drills. Furthermore, fitness and health become a top priority
to ensure that the team has the
endurance to play an entire game.
Goalie Gina Grubb 'lO remarks on
the team size, "Because we have very
few substitutes, everyone pretty much
has to play the entire game and also
often play through injuries. Having a
small team eliminates any room for

slacking, so everyone has to be on their
game at all times. We have been really
working to overcome this challenge by
focusing on fitness and intensity
throughout the game."
The team's only freshman, Lara
Hasychak, has played a large role in
stepping up amidst the team's size
struggles. Schmidt was full of compliments for Hasychak, saying, "It feels as
though she's always been there. Also,
she scored an awesome goal against
Bryn Mawr last weekend!" Young also
joked that Hasychak, though her participation in sometimes "ridiculous"
team activities has come to really

become part of the Swarthmore Field
Hockey Team.

The new coaching staff has also
a significant role in the
women's successes so far. Coach
Lauren Fuchs has replaced Kelly
Wilcox as the latter took the role of
Assistant Dean of Student Life. Roach
states that, "Lauren is an amazing tactician. She knows exactly what we
need to do to play to our potential."
The women look to improve on
their play for the rest of the season.
Young hopes that the team can break
down some its mental barriers, "When
we realize how long we've [been] playing and how few subs we have, we
mentally make ourselves more tired
than we actually are."
All the while, the team looks to keep
pushing itself, listening to their coaches, and have fun playing the game.
Their next game will be a Centennial
Conference match-up at Washington
College this Tuesday at 7 P.M.
