Psych Services Welcomes Ramirez
By Andrew Brown
Concluding

a

hurried national job search

prompted by an untimely and highly publicized
resignation, the College has hired Dr. David E.

Ramirez as the new Director of Psychological
Services. On July 1, Ramirez, former Staff
Psychologist and Director ofClinical Training
at Haverford College, initiated an attempt to
wipe clean the tarnished reputation of Psychological Services by replacing Dr. Leighton
Whitaker, Swarthmore alumnus and director
for fourteen years.
According to Associate Dean Bob Gross,
chair of the search committee for the new
director, the search committee's goal was to
make a decision by graduation last May. "We
wanted to have a director on board before we
started the next year. We were able to come up
with a reasonable but very tight schedule," said
Gross. The four interviews were held shortly
after the end of Spring semester. "We tried to
make sure that those who were most interested
in this position were notified and I think they
were represented. There were some people
who were unhappy but understood why [the
interviews were scheduled after finals]."
"We would have liked to have had more
students in on the interviews," said senior Darin
Friess, one of two students on the search committee. Friess recalls that there were at least

five students at each of the interviews he attended, and CIPS members attending at least

"The committee was not trying to shield To the contrary, Gross says, "We tried to get as

Senior Melanie Wertz founded the student campus."
The problems surfaced most clearly with a

Students, Officers Discuss Security
By Erik Huneke
Student Council held an open meeting in
Parrish Parlors on Thursday, September 15 at
8:30 pm to discuss ways in which torespond to
the two recent mugging incidents. Approximately fifty students and two Security officers
were in attendance.
At the beginning of the meeting, Maggie
Gold '95 remarked, "We have the Security
guys in cars, but we don't have many roads on
campus." She proposed the creation of a "Garnet Patrol," which would consist of a group of
four students in highly visible garb to augment
the patrols already conducted by Public Safety.
According to patrol officer Fred Martino, there
are typically five people on duty for patrols at

any particular shift. This would also enhance
the efforts of Safe Walkers, who are for the
most part equipped with two-wayradios and do
monitor darker parts of the campus, but who
travel along only threeprescribed routes. Gold,
however, believed that "Oneperson on a golf
cart isn't all that intimidating."
Another concern raised was the absence of
telephones outside of dormitory entrances. Although Wharton does have phones on the inside of some doors, they are not in working
order. Rohit Malhotra '95 said that Assistant
Dean Tedd Goundie recently had a meeting
with the RAs, in which it was decided to institute a pilot program which would place telephones at the entrances to Willets and Mary

students with similar problems. According to
Wertz, about fifty students responded with their

pretty terrifying," said Wertz.

SAC Presides
over Parties
By Alice Stillman and Chris Ciunci
Hello, all you fellow Swarthmore party animals! This is Chris Ciunci and Alice Stillman,
your new social gurus for the upcoming year.
Before the stress of academia overwhelms you,
we'dlike to update you on the new social policies
for this year.
The Social Affairs Committee (SAC) coordinates all-campus events and parties. In order to
throw a party or plan an event, students must bring
a brief, one-page budget proposal to one of the
weekly SAC meetings. The meetings are held
every Wednesday night from 6:15 to 6:45pm in
the downstairs meeting room ofSharpies (behind
the toasters). Students should present their budgets at 6:15, thenreturn at 6:45 for the final SAC
decision regarding allocation of funds. Students
should also come to theWednesday SAC meetings to pick up party and alcohol permits. Two 21
year-old signatures are required for an alcohol
permit. To increase the likelihood of funding, we
recommend that students submit their budget
proposals 10 days prior to the party or event
We are very excited about the upcoming
school year since we now have the funding to
gain access to some great outside entertainment. So far, upcoming events include anawardwinning a capella group, a virtual reality night,
a dinner comedy, and a hypnotist Tonight
impressionist-comedian Rob Magnotti will kick
off the year's events by performing in the
LPAC at Bpm tonight Come early for free
pizza at 7:15!
One of the new student jobs this year has
been dubbed Party Associates, or PA's— not
unlike your friendly CA's, RA's, and WA's.
Welcome to Swarthmore lingo, all you firstyears ! This position has beencreated in order to
allow students to self-monitor their parties.
Generalduties include checking ID's to ensure
that only Swat students are admitted to on-campus parties, and helping to see that party guidelines are followed
We hope that you will feel free tocontact us if
you have any ideas or questions.

When Lunch Revolves Around More Than Food

beyond.
"AWOL was designed to demonstrate to
women students that the faculty and the staff
women are interested in theirlives and supportive
of the concerns they have," said JuliaWelbon of
the Department of Psychology, and member of
theWomen's Concerns
Committee (WCC).
Welbon also said,
"AWOL is a way to
bring women together"
who otherwise "might
not encounter each other

in their professional or
student lives."
Discussion at AWOL
begins informally, and
then focuses on a
planned topic. Topics
covered last year included classroom dynamics, techniques for
addressing sexual ha-

survey ofSwarthmore students and employees be
conducted to discover the frequency and extent of
sexual harassment and intimidation on this campus. Thisrecommendation was made inresponse
to a discussion in AWOL of the need for such
information.
AWOL has much in the works for this semester. AWOL plans to encourage Swarthmore
women to use the new Women's Resource
Center, and plans to discuss women's health
issues. Myrt Westphal, Director of Residential
Life, remarked, "We want to bring in speakers
from Admissions, Psyc Services, and Public
Safety to address
women's concerns. Instead of just talking
among ourselves, we
want to bring in people
who make decisions and
affect policy."
The current AWOL
organization was started
in January, 1993, by
Women'sStudiesand the
WCC. An AWOL group
was present on campus
in the eighties, but it was
less structured and had
less studentinvolvement
According to Welbon,
"We picked up the name and redesigned the
concept." Margaret Patterson '95 has belonged to
the group since its comeback and said that the
interest level in AWOL has been steady since
then.
Patterson said, "It's great to have a safe, comfortable environment" in which she feels comfortable bringing up issues that she would like to
discuss. However, she considers AWOL gatherings to be a lot more than just an opportunity to
discuss issues. "It's so great to have a forum for
students, faculty, and staff to just talk. We have
the bond of women's issues, but I would go
anyway [even if there were no issues to discuss.]"
Wendy Cadge '97 has attended AWOL since

rassment or intimidation, and the planning of the
new Women's Resource Center. Planned subjects may be superseded at meetings by current
events or other topics of interest
However, AWOL is not simply a discussion
group. Welbon says that AWOL gatherings often
provide the women with the impetus "to go after
fixing" an injustice or a concern. Eva Travers of
theDepartment ofEducation and the WCC said,
"After we talk about [issues] we often try to do
something to follow up which is more public so
the whole community can benefit from our discussions."
Last year, AWOL successfully attractedgreater
attention to two areas of concern. After extensive
discussion about classroom dynamics and how
females can make their voices heard in the classroom, "AWOL's observations were shared with
faculty members through E-mail," Welbon said.

In light of the recent interest in addressing
sexual intimidation, the WCC and the Equal Qgt
portunity Committee made a joint recommendation last June to the Deans' office that a proper

concerns but tomeet some professors," she said.
Cadgementioned that as she went to more meet-

ings, she became informed ofissues ofinterest to
women of which she was not aware. She was
surprised Ip fc«xn that uwe is no day-care providedfor the college's faculty and staff. "I[would
think] day-care [would be] so basic," said Cadge.

AWOL meets Mondays from 12:15 pm to. 1:15
pm inPaces, but people arrive as they are able and
leave as they need. Participants in AWOL are free
to come as frequently or as occasionally as they
prefer. AWOL regularly sends out E-mail messages to those interested in the organization to
inform them of upcoming discussion topics. If

Maxine A. Proctor, new directoroftheBlack
Cultural Center (BCC), has been described as
witty, high energy, friendly, dynamic, easy to
get along with. She embarks upon her position
with the aim of leading theBCC in the spirit of
"Building Bridges," the SASS motto for the
year.
Proctor has years of experience and a firsthand, working knowledge of student affairs.
She has a graduate degree in inner city studies
and has worked in the Deans' office in the
University of Illinois and at the University of
Chicago. She has been working in student affairs since 1972
longer than many
Swarthmore students have been alive. Most
importantly. Proctor enjoys what she does. As
director of the BCC, she follows in the footsteps of Joan Eldridge, Joe Mason, Vernon
Savage, and Pat Darrel —individuals whom
she holds in high esteem.
Proctor accepted this position because she
believed thatSwarthmoreheld a certain charm,
mystique and warmth that other places lack.
While she is impressed by Ngina Lythcott and
the faculty, it was the student body that convinced her to come to Swarthmore. "Never
before have I encountered a body of such self
motivated, determined students," she remarks.
Proctor intends to "work in
conjunc
tion with SASS and with the community at
large." This year will mark the 25th anniversary of the BCC, and she plans to cooperate
with SASS to celebrate the 25th year of "the
House's" existence. Moreover, she will upgrade the BCC, its library and other compartments, and improve it as a cultural center.
Although Proctor's background is in thesciences, she also appreciates art. Her office walls
are covered with selections of black artists. She
intends to extend this display throughout the
BCC, and to have a monthly showcase ofblack
art She is open to ideas and suggestions to
assist her in achieving these goals.

be formed in the latter half of May to

distributed the pamphlet before the

On May 5, President Al Bloom
issued a public response in the Weekly
News to the pamphlet, stating that
"the publication of unjudged and

unproven allegations was hurtful to
respected and devoted members of
our community and damaging to a

service which provides student's essential support." Bloom argued that
"the public rendering of [the allegations) at this point violates a respect
for due process and fair treatment
that must be at the core of our community life." Wertz claims that the

Later in May, the external review

staff from Psychological Services.
The questions concerned the policies
of Psychological Services, particularly regarding medication, as well
as the level of service available to
students. The findings of the external

strongly emphasized Ramirez's experience with college mental health

"We were looking for someone
who was quite a people person, who
was very outgoing, someone who was
willing to do education outreach including onc-on-one therapy and
groups, someone who interacted well
with students and had experience in a

Friess. "In the interview session with
students, [Ramirez] really gained the
confidence of the students that were
there. I think that he will overcome
the problems of the past."
According to Ramirez, his first job
in July was to examine the report of
the external review committee and
make changes to Psychological Services based on its content. "One of

Opinions
In Defense of the Muse
Artists have had a bad rap since the beginning of time. In ancient
Greece, Aristotle took the lead in condemning poets from the ideal citystate. Today Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms launch and relaunch
polemics against the National Endowmentfor the Arts. Amidst the ebb
and flow of debate, art—poetry in particular—has been thought of as
disposable. Weekend warriors and travelers trample through public
museums with the "I'm on a safari," mentality, perpetuating the viewof
art as a mystic reality not relevant to everyday life. Like the impression
of a dream upon waking, the worldof art seems nonsensical, and difficult
to relate to our waking life. When we need to escape from forty hour
weeks in a jungle gym of concrete and paper, art has become the
medicinal herb with which we anoint our frayed sensibilities.
Yet, art deserves a more essential role in the national consciousness
than whatit has been given. Poetry and visual art are more than raisins
with which one decorates a house or an inaugural address. Art helps to
round out the parameters of community by giving voice to the individual, and reaffirming the humanity of its members. Hardly a separate
reality, art emerges from the struggles and triumphs of individuals.
When public servants confront the task of assessing the voice of the
public behind voting blocs and interest groups, art puts voices and lives to faceless numbers. For example, urban
arts centers, through their power to stimulate dialogue, have the potential to bring about a rebirth for strugglin
communities.
At Swarthmore, the small size of our college gives us the opportunity to bring the artistic voice into th
community with a relative lack of obstruction. Therefore, this week, if you choose, you can read the poetry o
Swarthmore students in The Phoenix on page seven. The decision to publish this section was not an attempt to
rival literary publications or to mimic the journals of Paris intelligentsia. Rather, it was a move which we though

But I was more interested in the

the movie argue that director Oliver
Stone wanted to make a movie that
shows how the media glorifies violence. Stone uses MTV techniques to
show audiences are fascinated by festivals of ultraviolence that television makes accessible.
But if this is movie's message, I think Stone is hypocritical because he lingers on this selfsame violence. A friendof
mine whois also amovie insiderof sorts tells me that Stone

Moreover, "Killers" is being promoted to an audience that does not watch movies to hear this or any
message. Advertisments for the movie highlight the
"action", rather than the message or even the cinematography. In the New York Times, a flashy advertisement hailed the movie as "explosive," "brilliantly
I nightmarish," and, in an accurately gory description,
"eye-popping." On theradio last week, a rock station

If a movie aims to challenge its viewers to examine their own obssession with violence, then it should
not use that violence excessively or as a marketing

really interested in sending a message or was he simply
concerned with making a successful movie? One thing
is certain: Stone succeeded in making me want to watch

By David McGrai
As my father perused the 1994
Fall Semester Schedule of Courses
and Seminars, his brow furrowed
slightly at the sight of the History
offerings, and he winced when the
English courses caught his eye.
Granted, my father is a very traditional guy who has yet to figure out
the volume switch on the T.V., so
his complaints failed to probe beyond the titles of such courses as
"MulticulturalLiterature,"'The Play
of Gender," "Romanticism and the
Performance of Gender," "Whiteness and Racial Difference," and
"Afro-American Writers". Nevertheless, his concerns about the postmoderndirectionof the Swarthmore
curriculum are not withoutmerit. In
his own distorted way, he touched
upon some of the pitfalls of
Swarthmore's "cutting edge" curriculum.
PresidentBloom spoke to the parents last spring about the "cutting
edge" of the
college's courses.
He even explained
how authors like
Faulkner and Joyce
were scorned by the
academic "traditionalists" during
the 1930'5, but
eventually proved to
be rich and rewarding reading. However, there are three
reasons why this
post-modernist fervor has sent the
Swarthmore curriculum down a disastrous path.
The firstproblem with this policy,
which for the most part plagues the
History and English departments, is
that it teaches "cutting edge" subjects without examining the "blunt
edge" first, if you will. Without first
understanding the basics of trigonometry, the mathematician finds
integration impossible. There is an
immense differencebetween a "feel"
and a strong understanding of a subject. Few are knowledgeable enough
to dive right into "cutting edge"
classes at Swarthmore without first
developing a substantial basis for
understanding the respective fields.
This brings me to my secondpoint
One might argue that the Swattie is
not forced to enter the academic
post-modern realm. This is simply
untrue. I find courses like "Friars,
Heretics, and Feminine Mystics"
intriguing and exciting, but I would
like the option of taking a history
course about something as "tradi-

tional" as the U.S. Civil War, Great
Presidents in World History, or World
War 11. These options are just not
available. Take a look at the sixteen
non-seminar English Literature
courses offeredthis fall and judge for
yourself how many may be deemed
"traditional." Three, maybe four or
five, in my opinion. This is not to say
thatpost-modernism and traditionalism can't coexist peacefully; they
can, as is evident in Professor
Schmidt's brilliant AmericanFiction
Writers class. I'mnot asking for radical change. I just think that, in being
so adamantly "open-minded," the administration has nurtured a restrictive curriculum.
The final danger in integrating
"cutting edge" material into the curriculum is that we never know what
"cutting edge" is until we are looking
at it in hindsight.Perhaps thirty years
from now "Buddhism in American
Literature" will fade into the academic background. On the other hand,
onecan be certain thatShakespearean
works shall forever stand the test
of time. President
Bloom

at least hope that
the student is afforded the opportunity to escape the role of guinea pig.
Unfortunately, with limited traditional course offerings and busy
schedules, many students cannot help
but end up as pawns.
My arguments carry little clout if
they represent the sentiments of only
a very small portion of the college.
Who am I to gripe if most of
Swarthmore favors an almost overwhelmingly post-modern curriculum? Although I can offer no empirical evidence, I have found that a
broad range of students, from biologists to philosophers, tend to agree
with at least parts of my aforementioned arguments. The problem is
that this contingency is not one of the
more vocal "interest groups" on campus. But this is an different issue
entirely, namely, a political one. I
wish this "silent majority" would take
a more active role in combating the
Swarthmore curriculum's "obstructive open-mindedness" Maybe this
article will help precipitate such ac-

Who's Afraid of the "New"
Swarthmore Curriculum?

copy

Is Swarthmore's campus gradually turning into a land of moles?
Does it seem thatthe fenced off area
between Parrish and Parrish Annex
is a sandbox for grown-ups with big
toys? When you see the dust and dirt
blowing out ofthis fenced in area, do
you expect to see a tumbleweedbush
roll by, as in an old west ghost town?
If you've asked yourself these questions or answered yes to any ofthem,
chances are you'll agree that the
promise of renovation is often sullied by inconvenience.This constructionsite threatensthe geometric principle that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
Here is thesituation: you have just
finished a class in Trotter, and your
next class is on the thirdfloor of the
PAC. What is your best bet for
arriving to class in enough time to
catch your breath from the stair
climb? Coming out ofTrotter west,
do you go right, around Beardsley,
past Martin and down the stairs to

the PAC? Or, do you go left, around

Beardsley, through the Parrish ad-

missions office alcove, and up the
narrow path to the PAC? Would we
wonder what to do if it weren't for
the construction? What are they doing?, you ask yourself as you walk
along one of the aforementioned
paths and stagger from left to right
and back again, against the flow of
students who all seemed to take the
opposite way thanthe one you chose.
Such path overcrowding has also
caused a war of sorts between the
pedestrians and the bicyclists.
Or assume that you have again
finished a class in Trotter and have
the mere task of getting to Dupont
for Chem 10 in time to get a decent
seat. You walk along the path
(Beardsley is to your left), and a
biker is approaches you. You think,
"I'll moveright.Right of way, yeah."
But then you think, "This unfortunate biker is going to get tangled in
the low ceiling of the bushes against
the walls of Beardsley." This is a
moralconundrum—whatdo you do?

Inevitably, you wind up playing
chicken with the biker who almost
losesher balance. You smile, shrug it
off and move on, only to be faced
with the larger dilemma of hearing
bike gears behind you and a person
saying, inaudibly, "passing." Let
there be a tacit understanding that
such path etiquette faux-pas are acceptable with the excuse, "if it weren't
for this construction..."
Amidst the uproarious power of
positive thinking, itis easy to say that
all this inconvenience is for the best,
and that we must suffer now in order
to later thrive. While I look forward
to the day when all of the ditches are
filled therubble clears, I still face the
diurnal task of getting to class and
avoiding collisions.
I will attempt to emulate Robert
Frost in mypath-taking philosophy—
I took the one less traveled by—and,
although it took a bit longer, I walked
fromTrotter, through Parrish, diagonally across Clothier circle, into and
through the PAC to the staircase, and
up to the third floor.

The Big Health Care Sell Out
By Mohan Ambikanipaker

A little baby in diapers rushes towards the water. His young, thin, and
attractive mother skips after him as
blurred waves roll carelessly in a vast
ocean. Mother and baby are all smiles.
This advertisement for a leading
HMOcompany declares: A HEALTH
PLAN FOR LIVING.
I had to wonder why the advertising firms came up with
this ad, which, if you're curious, is at the bottom of the
Swarthmore train station's
steps. An ad usually contains
something people lack in their
lives but need, or at least are
made to believe they need. This
scene, ifyou look closely, promises security and comfort like
that provided by a watchful
mother. And with thebig ocean
up front it taps into our deep
rooted desire to return to the
oblivious comfortof the womb.
Let's consider the facts. It is
widely-known that 15 percent
of the population has no insurance, and many of those who
have insurace are covered by lowquality, bureaucratic HMOs.
After Harris Wofford, a former
presidentof BrynMawr College, won
a United States Senate seat with a
campaign focusing on health care,
the insurance needs of Americans
became a national issue. An obscure
governor from Arkansas noticed the
success of Wofford's campaign and
put health care reform on his presidential campaign platform. Bill
Clinton became president, and in his
State of the Union address issued a
bold challenge to Congress: "If you
send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health
that can never be taken
away, you will force me to take this
pen, veto the legislation and we'll
come right back here and start all
insurance

over again." According to a poll pub-

lished by the New York Times last
month, 80% of Americans wanted
what Clinton wanted: universalhealth
coverage.

Clinton's plan failed. Then Sen.
George Mitchell proposed a plan
which promised 95% coverage by
2000. Clinton said that this was the
last compromise he'd be willing to
make.TheMitchell plan failed. A coalition of conservative congressman
and senators called the "Mainstream
Coalition" announced another plan
that would cover perhaps 92% of the

Conversely, many Juniors have
good reasons for needed a parking
space on campus. For example, I
have a job in Wilmington and am
doing research at U. Perm, both of
which involve significant commuting time at unconventional hours. I
don'tbelieve thatthe College has any
place in regulating these extracurricular activities by withholding parking permits to non-Seniors.
What do I suggest? First, scrap the
policy of parking as a Senior privi-

I spoke to students about the unfairness inherent in an allocation system whichis privilege-based. I identified three groups on the parking
issue. Some don't have a car and
therefore aren't interested. The other
two groups are those who have per-

up the feelings of many

in his position when he said "...it's a hierarchy

not a meritocracy—we got screwed

last year so we get places this year.
That's just how Swat works." Many
Seniors need cars here at Swarthmore,
but some brought cars even though
they don't need them. As another
Senior said, "I guess I don't really

as the block system was unfair to
Seniors, so the permit system is to
Juniors. The question is: does the
college feel that the non-Seniors warrant the same degree of justice that is
afforded to their Seniors? Finally,
the threatsof towing students's cars—inappropriate at best—should be postponed until an intensive, college-wide
decision making forum can be called
to solve this problem fairly for all
students.

Back and Bared: Swarthmore and the Other
Hey! For those of you who have been begging us to continue "the article"—all two of
you—thanks. We feel loved. We figured that
we had some time to kill, and
we'd like to alienate the rest

For those of you who have

But more importantly, will Swarthmore help

Invitation to a couch-warming
I have been reluctant to mention my current
living accommodations in my Phoenix column
because I know some people are still a wee bit
bitter about the way the housing lottery came
to

fruition last year.

I understand those of you living for a second
or maybe third year in someone's Budweiser
Party Ball box on Willets Ist south might not
want to hear that the ceilings in my Roberts
quad are so high my nose bleeds when I look
at them.
You probably are not interested in our plans
to turn the larger room of the quad into a roller

skating rink.
You might not even care to know about the
storage cupboard we have that is so enormous
it doubles as a study niche/love closet
depending on what discipline you are, uh, boning up on at the time.
So, being the sensitive woman I am, I'm not
going to write about the stunning Roberts quad
this week. Instead, I'm going to tell the story
of the stunning couch that now resides in the
stunning Roberts quad.
My narrative begins as any good story
should, with a conflict, a crisis, an obstacle to
-

Namely, the stunning women of the
stunning Roberts quad needed a stunning
overcome.

couch to seat their stunning butts while watching that stunning actor David Hasselhoff (he's
very popular in Turkey, you know) on that
stunning, drama television series, Baywatch.
So, we were confronted by our first problem: we have no car. This was, however, no
problem at all. For, with the use of my stunning Texan feminine wiles, I convinced my
friend Ben he WANTED to take me out in his
car to the Salvation Army in Chester to pick up
some furniture so he too could sit in the comfort of the Roberts quad and watch Mr.
Hasselhoff rescue scantily-clad blonde women
from premature and watery graves.
However, because Ben is suffering from a
severe chroma deficiency (i.e. he's really, really color blind) and I just plain have bad taste,
we were faced with our second dilemma:
should two esthetically-challengcd people go
to the Salvation Army together as a united
front in order to buy an unwieldy and important piece of furniture? I thought it might be a
good idea to bring a few more discriminating
people along to aid us on the quest.

Thus Becky, one of the stunning inhabitants
of the stunning Roberts quad entered the picture. She isn't color blind. She has good taste.
Second dilemma solved.
Onto the third and last problem: shipping and handling.
Hmm...as an independent, feminist woman of the '9os, there is,
in fact, no real problem here
either. I could have carried a 9459
pound couch with only my left
hand from Chester to Swarlhmorc
while dancing all parts of Swan
Lake, reciting the complete
Canterbury Tales in the original
Old English (just like Craig
Williamson), and chewing gum.
But, let's face it, men are good
for two things: carrying large

objects and killing bugs. We
might as well exploit their limited
capabilities, such as they are.
So we brought along Gabe, a farmer boy
with biceps larger than a small European
country (Luxembourg, I'd say), Mr. Spatial
Geometry, and a pretty nice guy to boot.

So, the cast of characters was complete.

Ben, Becky, Gabe, and I went off to the
Salvation Army on a three hour cruise to buy
ourselves a really nice couch.
Okay, maybe "really nice"
is a little too strong of a term to
describe the couch we eventually

acquired. Perhaps just "nice." Or
maybe "formerly nice." Okay,
okay. Eukaryotic and possibly
diploic
Actually, it's really not
thai bac It's brown. It's velour. It
has embroidered Chevron-esque
stripes. It's very heavy (or, at
least, that what Ben and Gabe
tell me). And it doesn't even
smell bad Really.
So I extend an open invitation to come to the stunning
Roberts quad, to sit on the brown
velour couch, and to watch the
rippling muscles of David Hasselhoff as he
eradicates all evil from our corrupt world
while developing a pretty good tan. I won't
even point out our ceilings.

his work on the Committee.
As director of the Intercultural Center,
Chang-Muy oversees the activities of the
Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual Association (LBGA),
the Swarlhmore Asian Organization (SAO),
and the Hispanic Organization for Latino
Awareness (HOLA). He has helped bring several cultural events to the Intercultural Center,
which last year included the San Francisco
Mime Troupe and the Nicaraguan minister of
Culture, Ernesto Cardenal. He is also involved
with other groups around campus, such as
Amnesty International and Earthlust.
As Swarthmore's equal opportunity officer,

On campus movie:

Chang-Muy is responsible for enforcement of
Federal regulations involving discrimination
on this campus. If a student or acuity member
feels they have not received an >qual opportunity as a result of race, religion, physical challenge, or nationality, that person can file a
grievance with Chang-Muy.
But while his work with the Jnited Nations
is necessary and affects social change on a
larger scale, he obviously still sees his work
here as important. When he looks at
Swarthmore, especially at the popularity of
such groups as Amnesty International and
CIVIC, Chang-Muy sees the activists of the
future: "I strongly, strongly believe in the
power of education to change he world."

Dangerous Liasons' plot is sufficiently convoluted that any decent attempt at summary

stopped me yet.
The film centers on the relationship between the Marquise
de Merteuil (Glenn Close) and
the Vicomte de Valmont (John
Malkovich), two aristocrats in
pre-revolutionary France who
respect the dignity of other
human beings in much the same
way small children respect the wings of flies.
Being aristocrats, they've got a lot of time
on their hands, and their chosen method of
whiling away the hours is the manipulation
and degradation of other human beings, which
they've elevated to the level of an art.
Merteuil and Valmont are rivals, but they
also have a certain respect, even admiration,
for each other. They were once even lovers,
but their profession demands that they continue to make new conquests. The thrill of the
hunt moves them.
Go sec

They enjoy the thought of forcing people to
give up that which they hold most precious. "I
thought betrayal was your favorite word,"
Valmont says. "No, no," Merteuil protests.
"Cruelty—l always think that has a nicer ring
to

it."

After logging about three-hundred miles
in travel along the East Coast this past weekend, the Garnet men's soccer team finally got
to play some soccer, defeating Eastern College 2-1 and Albright 7-0.
Although playing a scheduled opponent
may seem like a routine occurrence for most
teams, it had become a veritable luxury for
Swarthmore'sclub afterSaturday's scheduling debacle. Much to the dismay of most of
the team members that day, the Garnetjourneyed all the way to Stoneybrook,New York,
only to be informed that the Stoneybrook
team was already playing in a game at
Haverford College, back in Pennsylvania.
On Monday, the Tide packed up their gear
and hit the road for Eastern, this time finding
their opponent there and ready to play. In
what was described plainly as "just an ugly
game"bykeeper Shawn Bundy "97, the men's
team came back in the second half to erase a
1-0 deficit, scoring two goals and stilling the
Eastern attack to hold on for a 2-1 victory.
Finally returning home and playing with
all their starters, the Garnet promptly destroyed Albright 7-0 with a two goal performance by Kyle Bamett '97 on Wednesday,
racking up a combined shutout for keepers
Bundy and Will Delaney'97. Said Bundy of
the dizzying week of soccer, "At least I
finally got to see the Statue of Liberty."

Swarthmore's Women's Soccer team suffered a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Division II
opponent West Chester University on

Wednesday. West Chester struck twice in
the fust half, finding the back of the net on
two corner kicks.
In the second half,
Swarthmore's play was strong, but without
key players Rachel Johnson, Jill Maybee,
and Heather Maloney, who are out with injuries, the team was unable to come back. At
the conclusion of the game, right fullback
Sarah Guroffwas voted player of the game
for her outstanding defensive play. This
weekend, the Garnet will travel to Mt.
Holyoke College to compete in the annual
Seven Sisters Tournament.

Swarthmore's women's volleyball team
crushed a young Widener team 15-4,15-10,

row against Widener. Nancy Rosenbaum '95
led the team with 10 kills in each match and
has been the biggest force on the team so far.
Tuesday against Western Maryland, however, Swarthmore lacked a consistentrhythm

Recent Salary Cap Confuses NFL Season Outlook
By Matthew Halpern
Itis safe to say thatthe NFL is not the most
popular spectator sport at Swarthmore. In
fact some students probably view professional football as a completely senseless
game, in which hulking brutes inflict bodily

harm on each other and are paid great sums
of money. While this assessment is for the
most part accurate, there is still a sizable
group of students, both male and female,
who crowd around dormitoryTV sets every
Sunday afternoon to root for their home
teams. But with the new salary cap rule in
effect this year, Swarthmore fans will have
to do without some of their favorite players,
many of whom have been released as free
agents. Team rosters will be full of new and
unfamiliar players.
In the AFC East, the Indianapolis Colts
will look to make a fresh start behind free
agent quarterback Jim Harbaugh androokie
running back Marshall Faulk. New England
Patriots coach Bill Parcells has a lotof talent

talented but disappointing players like quarterback Vinnie Testaverde and running back
Eric.Metcalf. The Pittsburgh Steelers, led by
quarterback NeilO'Donnell and running back
Barry Foster, will more than likely win the
division. Having lost a number of stars like
WarrenMoon and Lorenzo White, the Houston Oilers will depend on quarterback Cody
Carlson and widereceiver Webster Slaughter
to salvage their season. The CincinnatiBengals
will more than likely be rebuilding their team

Seattle Seahawks will rely on quarterback
Rick Mirer and an impressive defensive line
including Cortez Kennedy and Sam Adams,
but will need to battle San Diego to avoid
being "worst in the west."
In the other half of the league, the Dallas
Cowboys should once again dominate the
NFC East Coach Barry Switzer will have no
problem leading this team to another division championship behind the play of quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmit

this season. Rookiepass-rusher DanWilkinson
and shaky quarterback David Klingler are this

Smithand a number of the league' s other best
players. The Philadelphia Eagles will be led
by quarterback Randall Cunningham, linebacker Byron Evans, and pass rusher William Fuller. Despite new management, the
Eagles are somewhat lacking on the field,
and will settle for a sub-par record. New
coach Buddy Ryan should rejuvenate the
Phoenix Cardinals from a defensive standpoint and his loyal defensive followers Seth
Joyner and Clyde Simmons, but the team's
offense will be somewhat lacking. The New
York Giants can look forward to a good
season from quarterback Dave Brown, running back Rodney Hampton and all-purpose
player Dave Meggett. In Washington, the

iii second-year quarterback Drew Bledsoe

androokie linebacker Willie McGinest, and
the Patriots should enjoy their first respectable season in a few years. The Miami
Dolphins shouldbe strong contendersfor the
division title thanks to veteran quarterback
Dan Marino, who will lead a powerful Dolphin offense. The New York Jets are loaded
with formerNFL standouts including Ronnie
Lott and widereceiver Art Monk, who will
assist quarterback Boomer Esiason and talented tight end Johnny Mitchell. The Buffalo Bulls led by talented, but aging players
quarterback Jim Kelly and running back
ThurmanThomas might have just enough to
lose the Super Bowl again.
In theAFC Central, the ClevelandBrowns
should get a .500 season from their pool of

teams top players.

In the AFC West, the L. A. Raiders contend
for the division title led by quarterback Jeff
Hostetler and speedy receivers Tim Brown
and Rocket Ismail. Kansas City will also vie
for first place with rejuvenated superstars including quarterback Joe Montanaand running
back Marcus Allen. Denver quarterback John
Elway leads a talented crew of Broncos: tightend Shannon Sharpe, widereceiver Anthony
Miller, and running back Rod Bemstine, and
can expect a respectable winning season. The
San Diego Chargers will be led by quarterback
Stan Humphries and receiver Mark Seay. The

young Redskins will depend on the play of
rookie quarterback Heath Shuler and receiver
Desmond Howard and Tydus Winans.
In the NFC Central, the Minnesota Vikings
willrely on quarterback Warren Moonandpass
rusher Chris Doleman for a strong run at the
division championship. The Green Bay Packers led by quarterback Brett Favre and all-star
pass rusher Reggie White should be close at
their heals. In Detroit, the Lions should also
enjoy a strong season behind the play of running back Barry Sanders, wideout Anthony
Carter, and quarterback Scott Mitchell. The
ChicagoBears should salvage a mediocre season with the help of quarterback Erik Kramer
and running backs Lewis Tillman and Merril
Hoge. Tampa Bay fans will have little to cheer
about, as theirBuccaneers struggle behind the
play of tight-end JackieHarris and rookie quarterback Trent Dilfer.
In the NFC West, San Franciso, whichrelies
on the play of quarterback Steve Young, linebacker Ricky Jackson, and defensive end Richard Dent, is likely toreign. The AtlantaFalcons
should deliver a respectable performance behind the strong arm of quarterback Jeff George
and the able hands of wide receiver Andre
Rison. The New Orleans Saints will be led by
quarterback Jim Everett and linebacker Sam
Mills. The L. A. Rams will look to quarterback
Chris Miller and running back Jerome Bettis
for big plays but will probably suffer a disappointing season.
All in all, the 1994season shouldprove to be
quite exciting, with the outcome difficult to
predict The salary cap has definitely caused a
great stir throughout the league, resulting in
many teams relying on an unprecedented number of younger players. Watch out Swarthmore,
here comes the NFL and a perfect opportunity
to apply your academic knowledge of economics, psychology, and sociology.

The women'srace proceeded first.
The current team beat the Alumna
by a score of 22 to 39, which was
actually quite respectable for the
alums. Blazing into first place for
Swat was Allison Schirmer '97, with
the record-breaking time of 20:09.
Alumna Pam Balcke finished a
strong second, with super-frosh
Danielle Wall '9B not far behind for
third place. Another studly alum.
Ginger Lewis, placed fourth overall. The remainder of Swat's top
sevenrunners finished in places five
through 10. Those women included
Amy Klosterman '97, Daniela
Learner '96, Ingrid Spies '96 (returning from a sorely-missed absence last semester), captain Kate
Dempsey '95, Shosharmah Pearlman
'9B, andDebra Junnila '97. What an
awesome pack! Then along came
the third alumna, Amanda Feine.
The incredible burst of power that
was the rest of the team included
Stacy Nakell '96, Amy Dalton '9B,
Sara Howard '9B, Rachel Brakke
'9B, Claire Farel '97, andKateßeard

and Nanette Destaut, finished out
the women's results. Much is expected of this '94-'95 team, considering its strength and numbers.

Football Frustrated in Indiana
By Nathan Hegedus

On Friday, September 9th, the
Swarthmore College football team
traveled to Richmond, Indiana to
play the Earlham Quakers in the
"Quaker Classic," which will be
played annually for the next three
years.

The team practiced on Friday and
then took a late flight to Cincinnati,
Ohio. Many of the team's members
expressed gratitude at not having to
endure an elevenhourbusride. This
was the first time several players
had flown. In the morning, the team
drove to Richmond, Indiana, the
home of Earlham College, after a
hearty breakfast. Upon arrival, the
handful of horses in the adjoining
pasture suggested the area's rural
atmosphere, which the locker room's
appearance only reinforced.
In the end, theGarnetTide walked
off theEarlham College fieldknowing that they could have won, but
the thought only made the 31-25
defeat harder to swallow. Down 247 at half-time, the team batded back
in the second half only to fall short
in the end.
Earlham won the opening coin
toss and elected to receive the ball.
The S warthmore defense held strong
on the first series and the offense
followed by marching down the
field. The offense moved theball all

day, due to the outstanding perfor-

mance of the offensive line. From
the outset, the Garnet set the tempo
for an offensive dominance that
would produce over 400 yards of
total offenseand 310 yards rushing.
However, the offense couldn't convert yards into points, as it turnedthe
ball over five times in the first half
and suffered a blocked field goal.
Unfortunately, the Earlham quarterback had an impressive day, and
the Swarthmore defense gave up a
seriesof big plays and lost control on
key drives. The defensestiffenedup

eleven carries. The defense also
toughened up as Swarthmore pulled
to within five points, bringing the
score at 24-19.
Earlham scored only once in the
second half, bringing the score to
31-19. Eric Williams made the Centennial Conference Honor Roll with
six tackles, two interceptions, and a
broken uppass. Brian Leutke led the
team with eleven tackles, followed
by Brian Hall with eight.
The Garnet immediately matched
the touchdown, scoring on theirnext
possession. Although Swarthmore

of a long second half.
Though the first half was shaky,
the second half belonged to the Garnet Tide.
Running backs Pat

much strength of form, sprinted to

the women's race, an alumnus, Tom

Men's Tennis Opens Season Strong at Bloomsburg

in the last couple of years." In
singles, the Bandits had three semifinalists in
the tournament—ChrisPearson '95 and Chris

Paul Wachter '97 were both quarterfinalists in
the "C" flight. Swat doubles also did wellwith
Chris Pearson and ChrisCiunci paired in "B"
team results

This past weekend the men's tennis team
made their annual fall voyage North to the
beautiful, scenic mountains of Pennsylvania
wherein lies Bloomsburg University. This autumnal warm-up tournament is an important
stop for the Bandits; it reacquaints the team
with the challenge and intensity of match play,
seasoning them for the all important Spring
schedule. For all you freshmen, Swarthmore
has long been a powerhouse of Division 111
Men's tennis, winning the national championship as recently as 1990. Unfortunately, Swat
has not done as well since the illustrious championship at the dawn of the '9o's. However,
they managed to inflict some damage at the
national tournament from 1991 to 1993. This
year's team appears stronger than those of the
past three years, so look for a good bid for the
national tournament come spring. Digressing
back to Bloomsburg...
Swarthmore has generally done well at
Bloomsburg, and this year's tournamentproved
to be no exception. In fact, theBandits had one
of their best showings in recent years. Says
senior Hunter Gehlbach, "This year's trek to

doublesreaching the semifinals. The strongest
Swarthmore doubles section was the "D" flight
with Hunter Gehlbach and Paul Wachter being
narrowly edged out in the final. To the team's
credit, no member experienced a "zero-win"
weekend.

The Bloomsburg tournament is a tough one,
for the players are required to play at least three

matches in the span of
the two days; as I'm
sure you all know, playing competitive tennis
when you can drink the
air is not easy. When
asked to comment on
the tournament,his first
ever, freshmen Eddy
Ernst replied, 'Tough
man, tough." Barry
Mook *96 answered the
same question with,

least there's consensus). Tiring, tough, or

Athletes of the Week

Nancy Rosenbaum is a third
year starter for the women's volleyball team.
She plays for the team as an outside hitter
and in the back row. Her strengths in the
game are in spiking and in her defense:
"digging" balls. Rosenbaumrecently helped
lead the team to victory over Widener three
sets to zero. A fellow teammate said
Rosenbaum is one of the bestathletes on the
team, and has the ability to get theball when
other people don't. In addition, Rosenbaum
has recently movedfrom weak side to strong
side in hitting.
Rosenbaum is a year round varsity athlete, and has led the basketball team in
rebounding for the past two years.

Eric Williams, a senior Football
Co-Captain and third-year starting outside
linebacker, was named to the CentennialConference Honor Role this week, after
Swarthmore's 25-31 loss to Earlham College.
Although the team came up short, Williams
had an impressive six tackles, two interceptions, and a broken-up pass. As Nathan
Hegedus, a teammate of Williams, noted,
"Eric is one of the most intense defensive
players on the team and always manages to
make the big plays."
When asked about the outlook for the season, Williams said of the Garnet Tide and his
teammates, "We have what it takes. Now
we're going to put it together."
