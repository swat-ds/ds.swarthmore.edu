Confusion lingers

As the presidency hangs in the balance, campus speculation and analysis abound
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Even the television lies some-

times.

Shortly before 2 a.m. Wednesday
morning, most television networks
declared Texas Governor George
Walker Bush president-elect of the

United States of America. He was

beating his opponent, Vice President
Al Gore, by more than 50,000 votes in
the state of Florida, a win that assured Bush the presidency. At 1:45,
Gore called the governor to congratulate him on his victory. Gore then
proceeded in a motorcade to War
Memorial Plaza in Nashville, where
he planned to give his concession
speech to a dedicated crowd of supporters. By the time he reached downtown Nashville, however, Bush's lead
to
in Florida had been narrowed
just over 1,000 votes.
At 2:30 in the morning, Gore called

BY MARA HVISTENDAHL

Bush back, retracting his concession.
As of press time, Florida's votes are
still up in the air. By state law, the
votes will be carefully re-counted,
with representatives from the local
county government and staff from
both the Bush and Gore campaigns
looking on. Although votes from the
67 counties in Florida should be released by this afternoon, a crucial
number of absentee ballots
over
150,000 of them
may take up to 10
days to tally.
Oregon, as well, has not yet been
definitively predicted for either candidate. Its seven electoral votes, however, will not be enough to take either candidate over the required 270
electoral votes. At this time, Gore has
260 votes, while Bush has 246. While
many expect Florida's 25 electoral
votes to go to Bush, Gore is leading
in the national popular vote, by approximately 167,000 votes, slightly

more than one-tenth of one percent.
In real numbers, this works out to
about 54 people per county across the
country. Recounts are also being tentatively scheduled for lowa and Wisconsin, both awarded to Gore.
Numerous issues remain in
Florida, where a suit will be filed by
Democrats over an ambiguous ballot
form in the Palm Beach district in
which some 3,000 voters may have
mistakenly voted for Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan instead of
Gore.
Because of all the confusion
around the country, no matter which
candidate is ultimately declared the
winner, a mandate by either will be
tough to claim.
The issue of Ralph Nader, on the
college campus especially, has been
hotly debated. Nader received three
percent of the national popular vote.
But after exit polls were released
showing that four-fifths of the people
who voted for Nader would have
voted for Gore, many Democratic supporters were quick to point fingers at

Nader.

"His presence absolutely made a difference," political science professor
Keith Reeves said. "I think he had a divisive tone during the campaign He
...

was a spoiler."

Raymond Hopkins, another political
science professor, agreed. "Gore would
have been elected president," he said. "I
think it was an ego trip for Nader."
Hopkins noted Nader's focus on getting five percent of the popular vote. If
that had happened, the Green Party
would be awarded federal matching
funds in the 2004 presidential election.
"I always wondered why that was so
important," Hopkins said. "Why was it
more important than bringing together
a national activist movement... which I
think would probably represent 10 to 15
percent of the American electorate."
Hopkins said that if the Green Party
had endorsed Gore, withdrawnfrom the
presidential race, and focused on state

and localelections in Green-friendly areas like New York and California, it
would have gone much further in building a national political party. A cam-

paign across the country, electing candidates to local and state offices, he said,
would have been an "unambiguous national campaign
one that the media
would not ignore." In addition, he said,
the Greens "could claim they got Gore
elected president and thathe owed them
something."
Both Reeves and Hopkins thought
that the possible electoral-popular vote
dichotomy could create a national dis...

cussion on the issue of the Electoral College. "I think there will be a real national
conversation," Reeves said, "possibly
about abolishing the Electoral College."
Hopkins was skeptical of outright
abolition but said that the Electoral College could be tweaked without requiring
See ELECTION, pg. 4

Three voters in Palm Beach County, Fla. petitioned for a new election in a lawsuit filed yesterday, claiming that a misleading ballot led them to
cast incorrect votes, the Associated Press reported
last night.
The claimants are three of many in the precinct
who yesterday expressed concern that a confusing
ballot had led them to vote for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan rather than Vice President Al
Gore.
The suit is the latest development in an extended
election result frenzy that has focused on Florida,
whose 25 uncommitted electoral votes will likely determine the next president. After Governor of Texas
George W. Bush won the popular vote Tuesday by
under 1,800 votes, Florida precincts yesterday began
a recount, which is required by law when the margin of victory is less than one-half of one percent.
The recount, originally slated to be completed by
this afternoon, has been complicated by the possibility that as many as 3,000 Gore supporters may
have mistakenly voted for Buchanan. The Reform
Party candidate received 3,407 votes in the county,
which is reported to be largely Democratic.
In comparison, two larger counties south of Palm
Beach reported much lower returns for Buchanan.
Broward County counted 789 votes for Buchanan and
Miami-Dade County reported 561, the AP reported.
The ballots used in the Palm Beach County elections were punch-cards on which Gore's name appeared on the page opposite Buchanan's. Though the
names directly opposed each other, however, the
holes to punch for the two were lined up vertically.
The claimants alleged that it was difficult to determine which hole matched with which candidate.
Florida law states that voters must indicate their
votes by marking an X to the right of the name of
the candidate they wish to vote for, but voters in
Palm Beach County wishing to vote for Buchanan
would have had to place a mark to the left of his

name.

As emotions in Palm Beach County heated up,

however, election tensions elsewhere in Florida
settled down slightly. The initial excitement provoked by the discovery of a locked ballot box in Miami Wednesday morning dissipated after the box was
revealed to contain only supplies, CNN News reported last night.
Meanwhile, recount results from the 19 Florida
counties that had reported results at press time
showed little change, with Bush in the lead and Gore
gaining only 23 additional votes, according to CNN.
But 48 counties will report their recount results to-

morrow.

Even then, it may not all be over. Elections officials also stressed that the state's large amount of
overseas voters may mean that they will have to wait
10 days before the election results can be determined
for certain. The AP reported that the state received
2,300 votes from abroad in the 1996 presidential election. And with vote tallies so close, that number of
votes could determine the fate of the entire country.

Students anxiously
anticipate results
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
You may not like Gore. You may not like Nader. You
probably dislike Bush. You may even hate politics. But
in your heart of hearts, Tuesday you doubtlessly felt a
tinge of excitement and left your door cracked open so
you could hear the guy in the lounge yell. Perhaps, you
even sneaked a peak at the poll results. Most likely, you
were one of the faces in the screaming crowd cheering
while Gore won Pennsylvania and booing thefolksfrom
Tennessee in Upper Tarble.
Someone once said that Upper Tarble was a hard space
to fill. Apparently, it's easier than it seems. All it takes is
an extremely close presidential electionbetween two allAmerican boys: Al and W. Add to that the Sunshine state
oscillating between the candidates and a dead guy winning in Missouri, and what you have is good television.

You also get a very excited campus.
"I am really anxious about it, but I'm largely amused,"
commented Ross Hoffman 'O4.
"It's a closer race that I thought it was going to be,"
said Tim Lang 'O4.
The miniscule difference in votes between Bush and
Goreadded to theanimation. Some people who were completely apathetic in regards to the presidential race were
transformed overnight into diehardDemocratic supporters upon arrival to Swarthmore. Especially after they
were satiated withBush jokes and saw the college Democrats anti-Nader propaganda posters around campus.
One of them is Liz Leininger 'O4, who found herself
continuously coming back to the MS-NBC Internet site to
check on theFlorida re-count results all day Wednesday.
"Nader is ticking me off," said Leininger. "This election is too close to have that uncertainty factor."
"Nader cost Gore the election," agreed Mike Hopper 'Ol
"I don't even know who he is," shrugged Emma Benn
'O4 in dissent to the emotional responses of the other two.
OtherSwarthmore studentsfelt exhilaratedabout the
election for completely different reasons.
"It just feels like we are in history books," said
Hoffman.
"It's really theelectionthatpeople will be talking about
for a long time," agreed Hopper.
From the bizarre to the serious, from the rumors ofa
conspiracy to lower the flag over Parrish to half-mast, to
thefrustration over theFlorida re-count, the student body
seems to feel very passionate, regardless ofwhich candidate they support. And while the disappointment over
the outcome seems tobring on apathy as timeprogresses
for the Democratic majority at the college, the Election
Day elicited some fairly strongresponses.
"IfBush wins, I am defecting," Ayanna Butler 'O3 said
only half-jokingly.
"I have a perverse desire for Bush to win, just because it wouldinfuriate so many people on this campus,"
said Elliot Reed 'O3, who voted for Browne, the libertar-

ian candidate on the ballot.
The very fact that a non-Republican would call a desire to vote for the GOPcandidate perverse highlights the
political leaning ofthe campus. Only one of thepeople who
votedfor Bush or Nader agreed to comment The rest would
at the most concede tobeing quoted anonymously.
"I think it's good for the country," said Payal Shah 'O3
in regard to the prospect of Bush presidency.
Shah was in fact hesitant tobe publicly known to stand
by her candidate, the same candidate that close to halfof
this country thought would make a good President. The
dialogue on campus thus seems to encourage only the complaints lodged in the direction of the GOP and in the defense of the Democrats. To be a Republican at this college
at an exciting timelike this is an act ofcourage for anyone
other than a person who revels the negative attention.
"People at this school are very close-minded. Last
night I realized that," Shah, who attended the Upper
Tarble event, explained. "It was very disillusioning."
Some studentsdid not at all partake in the excitement.
Most of those who admitted this once again refused to go
on the record in fear of being ostracized by the college
community.
Erik Elwood 'O4 did not suffer from this particular
complex. He was working on theSwarthmore version of
fuzzy math, comprised of vector spaces and five-dimensional problems for his Math 16H class.
At least he was impartial to the Republicans.

a constitutional amendment. Since it is
left up to the states to decidehow to award
votes, more might opt to go the way of
Maine and Nebraska, which assign electoral votes based on candidates' victories
in individual districts. "Without 'winner
take all'," Hopkins said, "the big pot
wouldn't be California, it would be voter

turnout."
Both professors also agreed that because the election shows no clear voter
mandate, the next four years may not see
many bold moves coming from the White
House. "Irrespective of who's elected,"
Reeves said, "the president won't be able
to do anything."

"You haven't seen stalemate get as bad
as it's going to get," Hopkins said. "I think
all of Washington may be like the Beltway

at nine in the morning."
Bill Clinton will also have an impact
on the next president. If, as the odds are
showing, Bush is elected president,
Clinton may well try to pass bills and fill
presidential appointments quickly before

the Republican president-elect is sworn
in.
Hopkins expressed concern about
the state of the international economy
during the next four years under a
Bush administration. "I don't know if
Bush people are smart enough competent enough
to handle it. [Bush
foreign policy advisor] Condoleezza
Rice was a Sovietologist. They still
don't trust the Russians." Hopkins
noted that the world economic crisis
two years ago involving Southeast
Asia, South America and Russia was
remedied only by aggressive action by
the United States. A Bush administration, he says, "may not have the capacities to take us through a real troubled
international economy."
As of press time, the next leader of
the nation is still unknown. The fate of
the legislative branch, however, has
nearly been determined. Although one
Senate race from Washington state remains undetermined, the Republicans
currently have 50 seats under control,
with the Democrats controlling 49. Even

if the last seat in the Senate goes to a
Democrat, the Senate will ultimately
still have a Republican majority. If
George Bush wins the presidency, Vice
President Cheney will cast tie-breaking
votes in the Senate. IfAl Gorebecomes
the next president, Vice President
Lieberman will have to resign his Senate seat in Connecticut allowing the
Republican governor to appoint a twoyear senator, and returning the balance
of power to the Republican Party.
More than likely, the next president
will be known within the next couple
of days. But the counting of absentee
ballots in Florida, the re-counting of
votes in Wisconsin and lowa, the fate
of Oregon and possible court litigation
over ballot fraud could drag the presidential election on for weeks before
exact results are known. There will be
many unhappy people in this country
no matter who is elected, but there is
one thing that they can take comfort
in: this year, more than ever before in
the history of the country, one vote can
make all the difference.

Botched registrations incense Swatties
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL AND IVAN BOOTHE
About a dozen Swarthmore students were turned away from
the polls Tuesday after their registration forms were apparently
misplaced at some point during the registration process.
College Democrats President Delonte Gholston 'O2 had overseen
registration for those students as well as for several dozen other
students whohad no problem voting. Gholston maintained that the

College Democrats had meticulously followed procedure in delivering the registration applications to the county office in Media.
"My registration was part of those forms... So when I got my
registration form in the mail, I figured everything was fine," he
said. "Why should I second-guess the registration process?"
The problem, Gholston hypothesized, lay withthe county government. The predicament was "either a government mix-up or
partisan fraud," he said.
Gholston drove Tuesday night with Erica Cartmill 'O3 and
another student to the courthouse in Media. Court-appointed at-

torney Ralph Jacobs assisted them in the matter and ultimately obtained the right to vote for the two students. The
other students with registration problems did not receive
the opportunity to vote.
"The judge found that we had done everything to be
reasonably assured that the courthouse had received

them," Gholston said.
But he added that the way the case was handled him
left him with doubts about the county's intentions. "Maybe
it's just my partisanship, but the judge was Republican and
the court-appointed attorney was Republican, and it seemed
to me like they were stalling and asking a bunch of questions at 7:so[p.m.] when we needed to get back to the polls
before 8:00," he said.
"The folks in Media were definitely not very efficient.. .1
have a lot of question marks," Gholston said.
Attempts to contact Cartmill and Jacobs were unsuccessful.

Runoff to determine winning

gameroom space proposal

SCCS proposal narrowly falls short of winning majority, to be
pitted against Swa-Wa proposal in next week's runoff
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

There will be a runoff next week between the Swarthmore College Computing
Society's media lounge proposal and the
SWa-Wa convenience store plan for the use
of the former gameroom space in Tarble
basement.
The voting will begin Wednesday and
end Friday, Student Council announced

Monday night.
After voting during last week's referendum, the tally was 370 votes for SCCS, 203
for SWa-Wa and 170 for the Center for Activism and Public Service, plus five invalid
votes.
Because of questions about petitioning
by SCCS during the referendum, the council held off revealing the referendum results until early Tuesday morning, when
it informed students of the runoff through
a campus-wide e-mail.
Student Council had decided one of the
groups would have had to garner the majority of the votes that is, 50 percent plus
one vote
to be declared the winner. Because SCCS earned only 49.5 percent, the
student body will vote again on the top two

proposals.
During its meeting Monday night, the
council voted down a proposal that SCCS
be disqualified from the contest because it
had circulated a "misleading petition." The
council began discussion on this topic last
Wednesday, when it received a student
complaint that SCCS had distributed inaccurate informationabout student space op-

tions.
Students who cast their votes for the
basement space last Wednesday through
Friday may have noticed the SCCS table
outside the main entrance of Sharpies.
SCCS members stationed there were seeking to gain signatures for their petition,
which proposed what they considered an
"optimal distributionofspace" for all three
groups, said SCCS member Tom Stepleton
'O2.
SCCS had hung large posters explaining their proposed arrangement and proclaiming "We Can All Get Along" in
Parrish and Sharpies early last week. In
addition, the group placed small signs on
tables in the dining hall. The signs' implied
purpose was not directly to garner votes
for the SCCS's own proposal but to gain
support for a proposal that would later be
presented to Student Council about accommodating the interests ofall three groups.
Their proposed distribution would
place the SCCS media lounge in the
gameroom space and the activism and public service space in the Wharton CD basement. SCCS professed to need the Tarble

basement because of videos, games, and other
noisy activities that would take place there.
SWa-Wa, according the proposal, would not
need space of its own because its purposes in
providing a late-night dining option would be
met by extending the hours of Essie Mae's, a
proposition which is currently before Student
Council.
Proponents of the other two bids for the

gameroom space did not embrace SCCS's suggestion. This may have been in part because
SCCS consulted neither the council nor representatives of CAPS and SWa-Wa before making signs and circulating the petition. But
Stepleton said he had explored the Wharton
space with Delonte Gholston 'O2 and Jonah
Eaton 'O2 of the CAPS group, and the representatives of both groups decided they could
make some use of the Wharton space if one or
both of them were to lose the Tarble referendum.
But after the "We Can All Get Along" signs

were posted, complaints began to arise.
The CAPS space, said its supporters, could
not make use of the Wharton basement in accordance with the layout and budget they had
planned for the gameroom. A campus-wide email sent by Student Council pointed out that
the Wharton basement space already includes
a dorm lounge and is intended to open itself
as a meeting place for all student groups by
the end of this semester.
Jared Solomon 'Ol, one of the minds behind
the SWa-Wa bid, claimed that Essie Mae's
would not fillall the same niches that the convenience store would, such as the sale offrozen foods and the availability of periodicals
and toiletry items.
Horatiu Stefan 'Ol, the other advocate for
the convenience store, also mentioned that
keeping Essie Mae's open late at night was
not a definite plan.
This issue was also discussed at the
council's Monday night meeting and is nearing the approval of Linda McDougall, director of dining services. However, were this
proposition to go into effect, it would be contingent on two factors: the willingness of students to work from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m. on
weeknights and the economic viability of the
arrangement. In other words, customers
would have to spend enough at Essie Mae's to
cover the costs ofboth food and wages; essentially, it would become privatized during that
time. "[SCCS] can't promise to do [all of this]
in their proposal," Stefan said.
Before the council voted not to disqualify
the SCCS proposal, Peter Holm 'Ol, Council on
Educational Policy representative, said, "I
proposed SCCS not be disqualified because
their advertising was not directly contradictory to the rules laid down on how the referendum should be run. I don't think SCCS's
advertising was misleading to the extent that

to Ani Silwal during thereferendum last week.
they should be disqualified."

Student Council then voted unanimously
with two abstentions in support of Holm's proposal to allow SCCS to remain a candidate in
the referendum.
In the meantime, Solomon, who has undertaken both the SWa-Wa proposal and the effort to lengthen the hours of Essie Mae's, said
that, were SWa-Wa to win the space, he would
continue to push for longer Essie Mae's hours
as well. He said that was because it would take
several months for SWa-Wa to get up and running, and late-night Essie Mae's hours could
fulfill some of the same purposes in the interim.
As for SCCS bringing up its far-reaching
proposal earlier in the process or discussing
it with the other two groups, "we just didn't
think about it," said Stepleton. He said that
his group's plan for accommodating SWa-Wa
and CAPS didn't occur to SCCS officials until
after the referendum had begun, although

Stepleton had mentioned his ideas unofficially
at a Student Council meeting two weeks ago.
In spite of unrest among the gameroom proposal groups and the official student complaint about SCCS's proceedings, the leaders
of the three groups approved of the council's
methods for choosing what to do with the
space.
"I think it's a very good system," said

Solomon.
Stefan said, "[Student Council] certainly
did a very good job organizing it and putting

up signs to get people to vote."
Sarah Drescher 'O3, a proponent of the

CAPS proposal, saw things a little differently. "It was kind of a confused process...
the standards thatthe various groups were
held to in terms of negative campaigning
and accuracy weren't clear. Even during
the initial process of checking for feasibility, it was haphazard.
"That said," she added, "I think it's a
good way to go about deciding how to use
the space, by leaving it up to the students."
Stepleton, who has been lobbying on behalfof the SCCS proposal and its "We Can
All Get Along" petition, emphasized in a
lengthy e-mail to Student Council that he
wanted to "discount any implicit message
in our campaign that accuses Student
Council of taking an irresponsible or in-

correct approach."
In a telephone interview, Stepleton asserted that "we think they did everything
right" and that "turning it over to student

referendum is pretty noble." Still, he was
not without his reservations regarding the
drawn-out and somewhat confused process
of allocating the space in Tarble.
"SCCS has been putting stuff off in anticipation of the referendum all year," he
said. "Despite the fact that referenda are
wonderful ways to diwy up space, they are
mighty inconvenient."

Authority on adolescent girls to address body image in talks this week
BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD
Renowned author Joan Jacobs Brumberg will be giving two presentations today on "body projects," acts by
which girls modify their bodily images.
The first is a lunch discussion, to be held at noon in the
Black Cultural Center, addressing the topic of how body
projects affect communities of color. The other is a slide
show lecture at 8 p.m. in the Lang Performing Arts Center,
in which Brumberg will analyze the past 250 years of body

projects in adolescent girls.
Drawn primarily from diaries and advertisements throughout history, Brumberg's slide show will attempt to answer the
question of why girls' body image changes. The diaries that
she uses are culled from a diverse mix of ethnic, religious,
geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Talia Young 'Ol, who arranged for Brumberg to speak at
Swarthmore, said that body projects in communities ofcolor
was "a topic that I proposed partly to counter the common
charge that body image as it's discussed in women's studies

is sometimes described as 'a white issue'."
Some of the body projects that Brumberg's work discusses include corsets, piercing, breast and body size,
sexual experience and identity, and the rituals of menstruation.
Brumberg is considered to be among the leading authorities on the history ofadolescent girls in America. She is a
professor of history, human development, and women's
studies at Cornell University and is nationally recognized
and awarded for her work.

Election daze

fcy

£uWu

Folks, it's official: it's never really over 'til it's over.
And in this case, the too-close-to-call contest between
Al Gore and George W. Bush won't be finished until long
after the multiple recounts and the ensuing legal and
political battles.
After a series of election night twists and turns,
mainly centering around Florida and a few other key
states, it looks as if Bush will win the election. But appearances can be deceiving. Even after all the recounts,
this country may end up with a president who won the
Electoral College but lost the popular vote. That's right,
Al Gore has a comfortable (if historically close) lead of

NIGHT

DEAD

approximately 250,000 votes nationally.
Obviously, the historical legacy of this election will be
bizarre, but the immediate implications are more pressing. Though no winner has been declared, calls to re-examine the role ofthe Electoral College in presidential elections are already coming from around the country.
People are going to be upset if Gore is the 'people's
choice' (ah, poetic justice), but Bush goes to the White
House. Which begs the question, does this antiquated system belong in today's sophisticated political environment?
Once we get past the issue of who is actually going to
be president, a whole host of other problems arise. Will
the next four years be spent arguing about who should
have won, as in the case of John Quincy Adams? The last
time the son of a former president won an election, his
term was squandered squabbling over a close race.

Even if the country can get past an administration

not even favored by half the electorate, will either candidate be even remotely effective? Only time will tell.
With what looks like an even split between Republicans
and Democrats in the Senate and a narrow margin of
control for the House Republicans, it's possible thatthe
federal government will remain in a partisan deadlock
for at least the next two years.
Remember the budget wars a few years ago? And you
thought you hated politics now.

Space woes
They've called a runoff! (No, not in that election.)
The Swarthmore College Computing Society's proposal to turn the former gameroom space in Tarble basement into a "media lounge" won the most votes (slightly
under 50 percent) in Student Council's recent referendum. It and the "SWa-Wa" convenience store proposal
but not the third proposal for an activist and public
service space
will be put to the student body in a
runoff beginning next Wednesday.
The council made the right procedural decision in
allowing for a "general election" round of the referendum after no proposal won a majority it makes sense

that the allocation of student space should be decided
directly by students. But surely there is a way to improve the fairness of the referenda for all the competing proposals and to avoid burdening the student body
with repeated ballot questions on the same issue.
The SCCS created controversy last week when it suggested that SC and the deans might be able to find other
student space for the competing proposals. While the goal
of obtaining space for all groups is laudable, it would have
been nice for the SCCS to work with the council and the
other groups to present such a proposal before the referendum began. This might have averted the need for a
referendum in the first place, let alone a runoff. Since
the council placed no advance restrictions on advertising or activity of the groups sponsoring proposals during the election itself, however, it correctly decided it had
no jurisdiction over complaints about SCCS's tactics.
Regardless, students still have to make a decision
between the SCCS media lounge and the SWa-Wa convenience store. But poor timing is to blame for the fact
that a proposal to keep Essie Mae's open late is also on
the table. The later hours would serve many, but not
all, of the purposes of the SWa-Wa. There are compelling arguments in support of both of the proposals. Students should carefully consider which one would benefit them more, and then be sure to vote.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Copyrighted music exchange unacceptable
Dear Editor:
I thank you for the mostly accurate reporting in last week's
news article "Music industry forces shutdown of 2 servers"
(Nov. 2). However, it is not correct that I think "use of Napster,
for example, is most likely not a problem." To use Napster is
to give and receive music files for free. When, as is usually

the case, the music is copyrighted, and the copyright holders have not authorized such free exchange, then that use
is most definitely a problem.

Columnist clarifies ambiguity
about gay marriage position
Dear Editor:
It has come to my attention that
some people on campus have interpreted from my column last week,
"Here are 10 things I'll do when W.
wins the election" (Nov. 2), that I
wanted to vote for Al Gore because he
is opposed to gay marriage. I noted in
the piece that "Gore, too, is opposed to
gay marriages," and then said, "He
would have won my vote on this issue
alone if only he weren't such a hypocrite."

What I meant by this statement was
that had he been in favor of gay marriage, then I would have voted for him.
I apologize if anyone took offense to
my statement due to the ambiguous nature of my writing and hope that my
true, intended view will be accepted
with no hard feelings. Ironically, that
statement was included in the piece
specifically to differentiate myself
from George W. Bush's anti-gay mar-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Theater: a drain on resources
Dear Editor:

"Educational?" [Swarthmore classics professor Gil] Rose
wondered out loud when asked about the educational purpose of athletic competition. "Give me a break! I'm having
a good experience, but educational?"
"Finding the right balance: Making athletics and academics work together," The Phoenix, April 27, 2000
—

I am writing to address the monstrous burden that the
Swarthmore theater program places on our college community, and to recommend that the college dismantle it.
Think: no current student remembers construction of
LPAC, but can you hazard a guess at its cost? Could you
enjoy some decent meals at Sharpies using a fraction of
the time, money and effort spent by Al Bloom to dig that
hole, outfit millions of dollars' worth of audio-visual equipment and power it? How does a decent filet mignon or
stuffed shrimp once a week sound? Twice? (OK, I'll resist

the absurd.)
Swarthmore's theater program is also a serious threat
to our U.S. News and World Report standings. I'm positive
statistics would support my contention that the average
theater student's SAT score sits well below the combined
averages of, say, mathematics, physics, engineering and
pre-med students. Furthermore, such alumni can hardly
be expected to contribute from their "starving artist" incomes the kind of endowment money that counts toward
the ratings (James Michener examples aside).

And surely the admissions office spends disproportionate time and effort evaluating theatrically inclined candidates who would not otherwise fit the prototypical
Swarthmore "profile." It's time to remove such obstacles
to recruiting a "superior" student body and focus on pur-

suit of our mission, which is to rank consistently atop a
second-rate tabloid's commercially prostituted evaluation
of the American higher education system. That is our mission, right, Mr. President?
Obviously, you students must recognize the detrimental effects Swarthmore theater has on your community's

growth and development. These are the most segregated,
reclusive, alienated members of the college! Closeted in
LPAC for six or more hours a day, rehearsing, building sets,
wiring lights, creating costumes
emerging only for brief
sojourns to a quick meal or an intense session of McCabe
catch-up. When did you last spot a senior theater major
out on a Friday night? I thought so. Does their schedule
allow support of cherished Swarthmore institutions like
an HOLA party or a home basketball game?
And what do you students receive in exchange for the
College's enormous theater investment? An educational experience? Give me a break! Sure, you may have a good time
attending a show, but what could you possibly learn by
watching performers measure tempo, control rhythm, choreograph movement, fulfill assigned roles, conquer adversity, channel an audience's energy, communicate, anticipate and coordinate to achieve a common goal? Hell, Gil
Rose can answer that one: absolutely nothing!
Does this sound ridiculous? Good. It should. I was a
Swarthmore athlete, one who dragged my aching student
body to every theater, dance and music production I could.
How can Al Bloom's administration consider abdicating
its fundamental responsibility to produce society's best
actors, athletes, dancers, engineers and teachers, all for
sake of the antithesis of Swarthmorean values
mity?

Article misrepresents queer community
Dear Editor:
We are writing this in response to the article covering
Coming Out Week ("Closets
can cause claustrophobia,"
Nov. 2). While we respect the
angle and the attempts to give
voice to opinions that are less
often expressed, we strongly
feel that there are some problematic elements in the article
that must be addressed.
We were troubledby many
of the comments made by
Casey Schroeder 'O4, though
he has told us that his words
were taken out of context.
Schroeder stated that, because
Swarthmore is very accepting, then we should not insist
that students come out. But
the open atmosphere at
Swarthmore should allow
people to feel comfortable
enough to come out.
A main purpose of Coming Out Week is to show that
there is a large queer and
queer-friendly community to
support people if they choose
to come out, but SQU does not
wish to force anyone to do so
if they are not ready. We were
also confused by the statement that the Week can be
"conducive to the construction and application ofhomosexual labels, which are potentially 'coercive and disgusting.'" When asked for
clarification, Casey told us
that he meant that chalkings
like "10% is not enough; Recruit, recruit, recruit" may

not be taken as jokes, as they

were intended, and may
cause people to be turned off
to the whole week.
However, while we acknowledge that such conclusions may be drawn, we also
feel like we should not have
to completely censor ourselves in order to appease
people who may take offense.
As for labels, they can indeed
be empowering, but SQU

would never expect someone

to choose a specific label for

themselves.

In the article, Adrian Daub
'O3 suggested that SQU open
its meetings to all students.
The SQU board examines this
issue each year and always decides that in order for SQU to
serve as a safe space for queer
and questioning students, the
meetings should remain
closed, with the exception of

monthly open meetings.
This does not mean, as
Schroeder seemed to suggest,

s

that at closed meetings, members "wallow together in their
self-pity"; rather, we have fun

together at our meetings, and
while we may share our problems and hardships with each
other in more serious discussions, we hardly wallow in
self-pity. Also, SQU's primary
responsibility is to our members and questioning students
who may want to join, not to
make the straight community
feel better about SQU's
'agenda".
Finally, we were con-

cerned about the article's understatement of homophobia
at Swat. Scant attention was
given to the homophobia that
does exist, as the article portrayed Swat as nearly ideal.
However, it is important to
recognize that homophobia is
more present and active than
was acknowledged in the article.

This year alone, Coming

Out Week fliers have been re-

peatedly torn down, people
have made openly homopho-

bic remarks in the presence of
queer people who they assumed were straight, and
some athletes have expressed
fear of coming out because of

intolerance on their team.
When we, a lesbian couple,
openly showed affection at
Sharpies, a group of men
turned toward us, began to
snicker and loudly said things
like "Ew," and "I think those
girls are lesbians." Similar
comments were also directed
at us at a party last year.
Obviously, public intolerance is not as non-existent as
the article would make as
think. Though these incidents
may have gone unnoticed by
much ofthe Swarfhmore com-

munity, they certainly made
a negative impact on the lives
of the queer people at whom
they were directed.

College: the only
place to do many
very stupid things
So, two weeks ago we dealt with the reasons for
hating college, or, more specifically, the detrimental effects of college on someone of even purblind

moral character. Since, however, this is election
week, in the interests of equal time, this week we
will be talking about things that are good about
college, or, rather, things that we have done at college that we would not have done anywhere else.
Following the maxim that we regret only what is
left undone, presented here are a few reflections
concerning what could be done nowhere else, or
at least as long as one is not in Holland.
I would not have drunken arguments where two
people try to convince each other of the self-same
proposition, all the while believing that the other
is disagreeing. What follows is the actual text, as
far as I remember, of an argument I once had:
"You know, we should sleep out here tonight.
It's cool a lot cooler than it is in my dorm."
"No, man, we should stay out here. You know
how hot it is inside? It's like 65 degrees out here
right now."
"No, it's like 65 out here. We should stay here
for the night."

I WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID TO A
PROFESSOR THAT, IF GOD CAME
DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD HER
THAT SHE WAS WRONG, IT WOULDN'T
MATTER A DAMN TO HER BECAUSE
THAT WASN'T THE POINT OF RELIGION.
I'm not sure who ended up winning, but we were
woken at about 2 a.m. by other students who, unbeknownst to us, held a nightly roundtable discussion on women's issues in East Timor on Parrish
Beach. I believe they were then accepting new
members.
I would have never admitted to having a nonsexual male crush on Val Kilmer.
On the same note, I would have never found ten
other reasonably sane people to agree to, before
drinking, watch "Real Genius," and who, after

drinking, were so inspired by the scene at Purgatory, Home of the Limbo Burger, that they went to
Wendy's at 1:30, whereas I watched the less-entertaining ASAP video
the one that is just a series
of slides and voiceover work.
I would never have been able to use a silly 500-

word column to become a social pariah sophomore
year in chez Willets, nee Willets.
I would never have said to a professor that, if
God came down from heaven and told her that she
was wrong, it wouldn't matter a damn to her be-

cause that wasn't the point of religion.
I would never have the most extensive collection of comic rap on campus, including "The
Hotstepper," "I Wish," "The Humpty Dance," and
"I Got Your Money" (sing it, white women).
I would never have gotten a concussion that
caused me literally to fall out of my car outside a
Don Pablo's restaurant in suburban Pittsburgh,
while two kids on those damn silver scooters
laughed at me.
And finally, because I need a big finish, I would
never have heard someone say, upon viewing a
somewhat-attractive female character in a "Street
Fighter"-esque video game, and I do indeed quote,
"Quick! Somebody press the 'rape' button." Let he
who is without sin administer the beat-down.

PUBLIC
These are the times that try men's souls.
You know, about ten years ago, a little
birdie landed on my shoulder. It began to
tell me a very silly story about the future
of American politics. It went a bit like
this.

President Bush may have 90 percent
approval ratings now that the US has won
the Gulf War, but the economy will soon

head south and he will lose his reelection
campaign to a virtually unknown governor ofArkansas named Bill Clinton.
Clinton's national health care plan
will be a dead-on-arrival disaster in Congress, and the public will turn against
him in 1994 and give control of Congress
to the Republicans for the first time in
about forty years. Yet somehow, Clinton's
approval ratings will go back up in time

for him to win reelection in 1996
the
first Democratic president twice elected
since FDR.

During Clinton's second term, a sex
scandal will erupt in his administration
and will evolve into a national soap opera
starring the president, the first lady, Ken
Starr, Monica Lewinsky andLinda Tripp.
Ken Starr will write a pornographic report
describing the president's sexual exploits
in detail, and Congress will release it to
the public, who will read it widely through

In 2000, Clinton's vice president, Al Gore,
will run for the presidency against the eldest
son of George Bush, whose name is also
George Bush. Also that year, the first lady will

run for the United States Senate in New York.
Yes, this all seems a bit incredible, said the
talking birdie. But it gets even stranger.
On Election Day, 2000, the first lady will
actually win her Senate campaign. Also winning a Senate campaign that year will be the
dead governor of Missouri, who will beat the
very-much-alive incumbent.
In the presidential race, the electoral college will be split so evenly that victory for each
candidate will rely ultimately on the state of
Florida which will be declared won for each
candidate at some point during the evening
before Bush's lead narrows to 200 votes at 3:30
in the morning and a recount is ordered. It
will be the closest presidential election in
American history.
Of course, I laughed that little bird off my

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Free alcohol necessary
to Swarthmore social life
Dear Editor:
While I don't think that fraud is necessarily the best
way to finance parties at Swarthmore, I disagree with much
of what Professor Timothy Burke said in his letter in the
Nov. 2 issue of The Phoenix, and some of it was downright
offensive.
The way I see it, there are two goals in planning social
gatherings at Swarthmore, specifically ones that involve
alcohol. The first is to provide a safeenvironment in which
students can drink. Because it is acknowledged that students are going to drink, whether it is allowed or not, the
most sensible solution is to make sure that they do it safely.
The second goal, one that applies to every event at
Swarthmore, is that parties should be available to all students, regardless of group affiliation or financial status.
It is desirable to have all-campus parties regularly to

achieve that first goal. In my time at Swarthmore, the vast
majority of people who I have seen get really sick from
alcohol consumption did it at small private parties. It is
much easier to control the amount of alcohol a person consumes when there are a lot of people around who know
that person, and if that person should get sick, there are
people whose job it is to make sure that they are safe.
The second goal, keeping parties open to all, is necessary for the first goal to be realized, but it is also important for its own sake, as it is part of the Quaker ideal. In
order for Swarthmore parties to truly include the entire
campus, they need to be free. Most students, myself included, will simply not attend parties that cost money.
This is not because we are, in Prof. Burke's words, "cheapskates," but because we simply cannot afford to pay
money to attend parties every weekend, and would choose
the alternative, sitting home and watching TV. This would
cause the campus social scene to die a slow death, and
once again bring people back to drinking alone or with
two or three friends in their room. I found myself actually laughing at Prof. Burke's idea of putting ten dollars
into a pot each week to finance booze. Not only is drinking with small groups of people in private rooms exactly
what we should not be doing, but it also seems like about
ten more dollars than most Swatties can spend. I guess
that one person's underprivileged is another person's
"cheapskate."

Nobody. It's a tie. The voting public
couldn't decide which would be worse, President Gore or President Bush. One of those will
come true (and he will be worse), but don't
call it popular sovereignty.

Why don't we have a co-presidency, like
in high school, with Gore president one
day and Bush president the next?
They only do that in countries ravaged by
ethnic separatism and then saved by Richard
Holbrooke. Besides, Nader would want to be
president once a month, and Tom Tomorrow
would keep drawing those stupid cartoons
until the Green Party got its way.

Isn't Gore humiliated by his inability to
carry his own state, knowing that, if he
did, we wouldn't be in this mess?
He's probably more humiliated by his inability to articulate a decent campaign theme,
message or vision throughout his candidacy.
Doesn't Nader feel bad about all this,
seeing that, if only a tenth of his Florida

supporters had switched to Gore, we
wouldn't be in this mess?
No.

It was such a stressful election night.
How did the candidates handle
themselves?
Al Gore was obnoxious enough to call
Bush twice first to concede defeat, then
to take it back. George W. Bush went to bed.
So it looks like they pretty much stayed in
character the entire evening.

What will a Bush presidency look like?
With Dick Cheney presiding over a
split Senate, Bush will have to learn to
read from someone other than his
father's rich old crony from the oil business. Gore will have plenty of free time,
though, so he will teach Hillary how to
filibuster. May many phone books be
read into the Congressional Record.

What will a Gore presidency look like?
Joe Lieberman will resign from the vice
presidency so he can fill the critical tying
Senate seat, and Gore will appoint a new
but familiar-looking vice president to preside over the Senate and cast the tie-breaking votes. And you thought Bill Clinton

was retiring!

Falun Gong flyer misleading, exaggerated
Dear Editor,
I recently received a flyer in my mailbox asking for my
support for Falun Gong, a "spiritual practice" allegedly
based on "Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance"
whose members have recently been victims of some appalling atrocities in China. The flyer implies comparisons
between Nazi Germany and today's China and asks its audience to take seven steps, two of which involve complaining to powerless officials and the rest of which involve
spreading information about Falun Gong. This is a clever
move on the part of Falun Gong's leaders to gain recognition, sympathy, validity and, ultimately, more members.
After someresearch, it became clear to me that Falun Gong
is a cult with the exact intention of using China's unfair
and brutal practices to increase its following in the US.
Falun Gong claims 60 million members, or about 6 percent of China's population. This frightens the government
for two reasons, one good and one bad. The first, as evidenced by Falun Gong's own literature, is the public heath
hazard of a significant minority who refuse even antiboitics
(or deny that they are ill at all). The second is the threat of
a large organized group thatis opposed to some of the Communist Party's views and has an influential constituency
ofretired military leaders. Clearly, this is already a more
complicated issue than the flyer states, but if this was all I
knew, I might still be in support of Falun Gong. The facts

are as follows:

The government's claims about the health risks to the
members and non-members of Falun Gong are correct and
well founded. The group strictly advocates its breed of traditional medicine as a replacement for "Western" medicine.
In a highly populated country with already poor health
resources this is dangerous to all citizens, especially if the
group's claim that 6 percent of China are a part of Falun
Gong is true.
The group has seized this opportunity to prey on liberal-minded folk and the new age movement in the US,
which has pushed membership in other cults such as the

Church Universal and Triumphant to heights of dangerous and destructive power here. Falun Gong's leaders' hope
is that people will read their literature and see their practices as an alternative to many things liberals (myself included) routinely criticize.
The group employs psychological manipulation. Their
methods of psychological manipulation, which are sometimes (inaccurately, I feel) called mind control, use tech-

niques well founded in psychology to alter a person's beliefs, actions, thoughts and even desires. Many groups that
are not cults employ similar techniques, and it is often difficult to obtain direct information about the techniques a
group uses just from reading the group's literature. Often
only membersthemselves see the techniques in action, and
any ex-member will be able to tell about them. In the case
ofFalun Gong, however, we need look no further than the
literature they put out. In this case, we simply need to understand the ridiculousness of their beliefs. For example,
Li Hongzhi, the group's New York-based leader, makes the
following claim in his introductory book on Falun Gong:
"There is a magician named David Copperfield in the US.
As a matter of fact, he is a master of supernormal capabilities, which has enabled him to perform walking through

the GreatWall of China."
How can anyone who is intelligent and rational believe
this when David Copperfield himself surely does not? Psychological manipulation can make people believe justabout
anything. This book contains many such examples. As evidenced by the several intelligent Swatties and ex-Swatties
who belong to this group, people believe the claims not because they are crazy or stupid but because they are not in
full command of their own thoughts.
I am clearly not asking anyone to stand behind China.
Rather, everyone should think twice before supporting a
mysterious group that does not state its beliefs or intentions clearly on its flyers. People should obtain information about a group before going to one of its sessions where
drugs, psychological manipulation and altered consciousness states may be used to deny them their right to think
for themselves. China may be Nazi Germany, but followers of Falun Gong cannot be compared to the Jews.
I realize my words may sound inflammatory and offensive, and space prevents me from justifying all my points
properly. I encourage everyone
especially if he or she is
worried about a group being cultic to contact me or read
some of the Web pages I cited and come to a decision on his
or her own time, away from the group. Cults come in many
forms: political, racist and, most commonly, religious, and
there are many perfectly valid "alternative" religions and
religious groups that do not employ psychological manipulation. As long as Swarthmore students are informed about
cults, they should take the issue seriously and come to a
decision about the group on their own time.

A self-defeating peace vigil Asian subcultures

BY DAVID ELLIS

punished by being
lumped with others

Last week's vigil on Parrish Beach for peace in
the Middle East appealed to the best ideals that humanity can strive for. Unfortunately, while we in
sunny and safe Swarthmore can afford to hold our
heads high and express our idealism, the ideas implicit in this vigil are not only unrelated to the reality of the Middle East but actually serve to hinder
outside understanding of the peace process. This
outside misunderstanding of the peace process would
only be unfortunate, but not disastrous, except that
the Clinton administration's policies are based on
the false premises embodied in Parrish beach's peace
vigil. As a result, Israel's existence today is in more
peril than it has been since Al Nachba.
Implicit in the peace vigil is a common perception among the left wing that war is a result ofmisunderstanding. For the left, we will achieve peace
if we all just hope and pray for it enough. This misunderstanding can be cultural (if we just had summer immersion camps between the warring sides),
economic (if only they could realize how mutually
dependent they are on each other), political (if only
the leaders of the warring parties weren't exploiting age old hatreds for their own political gain) or
psychological (if only they'd set aside their hatred
and just go kiss and make up). For the relativist-

BY TED CHAN
In the United States, Asians are one of the most successful ethnic
groups in terms of wealth, prosperity and education. After a wave of
heavy immigration over the last forty years, Chinese, Japanese and
Korean people have earned a reputation for hard work and for second- and third-generation success in education and the job world.

Forgotten is that those were not the only Asians who made it to
America. And also forgotten is that not all of them are thriving.
While the Chinese and Japanese have very high per-capita incomes ($14,876 and $19,373 per year respectively), groups such as the
Vietnamese ($9,120), the Cambodians ($5,120, with a 42 percent poverty rate) and the Hmong ($2,692, with a 63.6 percent poverty rate)
stagger along, their plight receiving little attention and their bare
cupboards receiving barely a modicum of assistance. The Hmong
are a small but horrifically impoverished group in the United States,
while the other two are representative of the larger, less-fortunate
Asian American minority groups.
These groups represent a problem that should give us pause. They
are in dire need ofassistance to feed themselves, gain job skills and
educate their future generations. Part of this task is to avoid lumping their plight in with the general success of the other AsianAmeri-

dominated left, if there is war, then both sides must

be at fault, and we must pray for both sides to stop
the violence.
What the left never acknowledges is that war can
be a valid battle for resources, legitimacy, land, power,
and recognition. Israel and Palestine are so thoroughly
intertwined that they understand each other's cultures
astoundingly well. Arab-Israelites speak Hebrew, and
Israeli Jews eat falafel. Both sides are aware that Israel is dependent on Palestinian labor. And at factories across Israel, Jewish and non-Jewish workers go
out for drinks with each other afterwards. It's only
when people start talking in generalities that we hear
that Jews are all greedy or that Palestinians are all

terrorists.
The reason there isn't peace is that both sides legitimately value some issues above peace. For Israel,
the people value the concept that Israel should exist,
an idea that the Arab media and people continue to
deny. Israel also values the right of all peoples to visit
the holy sites of Jerusalem, a right that was denied
before 1967, an era when Israel did not have sovereignty over Jerusalem.
The Palestinians value Arab sovereignty over holy
Jerusalem as a right more important thanpeace. Many

Palestinians value the destruction of an Israeli state
that allows torture, limits Palestinian economic de-

velopment and destroys entire housing city blocks for
the fault of one person as more important than peace.
The peace vigil is fundamentally an assertion that
peace is the most important consideration. While this
is easy for us at Swarthmore to maintain, it is inapplicable to Israel.
Clinton's peace-keeping strategy ofpressuring both
sides to make concessions has not taken these concerns into account. At Camp David, Clinton pressured
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to the point that
Barak made astounding concessions to Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat without
reciprocation. Barak caved in on every Palestinian
demand (compensation for right of return, virtually
full sovereignty over the West Bank) except one: full
Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem. What was
Arafat's response to Barak's incredible concessions?
First, he literally told Barak to "go to hell." Then, he
closed down Palestinian schools, broadcast over all
media that Israel was evil and that an uprising was
occurring and then delivered rocks to the specified

intifada locations, where kids had been trained for
weeks to throw rocks. Furthermore, Arafat hid machine gun-toting soldiers amidst his sacrificial young
rock-throwing pawns, guaranteeing Palestinian casualties for the sympathetic world media. After all this,
Arafat had the audacity to blame Sharon for the violence, because he had the gall to visit the Temple
Mount, a site holy to, at a bare minimum, ten different world religions.

Where does this leave Israel? In negotiations, Israel has already shown that it is willing to cave in on

cans.

virtually all its negotiation points. The left's insistence
thatpeace is inevitableand optimal has left the Palestinians emboldened, violent and sensing that Israel is
mortal. Meanwhile, Israel is weak and uncertain, not
to mention fearing casualties, which are Arafat's best
friend. (When Israel decided to bomb the Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters, Barak gave Arafat
three hours' notice to clear the building). Because of
the values embodied in the peace-at-all-costs vigil, we
are now farther from peace than we have been in
years. Clinton's commitment to legacy at all costs resulted in his sending his top lieutenant, James
Carville, over to Israel in order to successfully run
Barak's election campaign. But what Clinton failed to
realize is that the two sides in conflict have values
that they think are greater than peace, and these values are antithetical to one another. A long-run timetable, and not just two weeks at Camp David, were
needed to work out these differences so that both sides
could reasonably compromise, as opposed to just
Barak compromising and Arafat smiling and plotting
his latest intifada.
The latest disaster in the Middle East has disproved two assumptions that the left and the ignorant continue to hold dear. Contrary to what the left
assumes, war can be legitimate, and in some cases
one side may actually be at fault for violence more
than the other. In this last month, it is abundantly
clear that Arafat and other top Palestinian leaders
have organized a campaign of violence and martyrdom for their own political gain and the victims are
the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. We will continue
to witness disaster after disaster until the left stops
its silly peace vigils, gets rid of its requisite assumptions and recognizes that these only serve to heighten
outside misunderstanding of the complex Israel/Pal-

estine relationship.
Praying for peace is overly simplistic and therefore meaningless. If you want the long-term violence
to end, pray that Israel ceases to exist and the Palestinians are no longer oppressed. Or pray that the Palestinians are disempowered and Jerusalem remains
undivided. If you want the short-term violence to end,
pray that the Palestinian leadership stops its aggressive tactics. But don't just pray and have vigils for
peace. Praying for peace is great, but understanding
reality is more important.

SHOULD WE IGNORE THE PLIGHT OF A NATIONALITY
OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF AN
OVERARCHING GROUPING?

A Cambodian or Hmong childhas to bust his ass to graduate from
high school. This kid gets to the college application process and the
appropriate choice for race is "Asian/Pacific Islander," which is an
overrepresented group due to the general success of other Asian subgroups in the United States. It is unlikely that this candidate will get
any help, despite coming from an extremely challenging background.
A hispanic or black student would, and deservedly so.
Affirmative action in the workplace and in the college admissions
office doesn't help say, the Japanese or Chinese, which is fine. As
groups, they are doing okay. But should we ignore the plight of a
nationality of people in our country because of an overarching grouping? These underrepresented groups need well-educated leaders.
People don't like fuzzy math, but here's some anyhow. To me, real
diversity is not X percent white, Y percent black and Z percent Asian.
It runs much deeper than that. The richest diversity within the Asian
subculture includes, among others, Cambodians, Hmong and Laotians. The groups exist in large numbers in the United States, but
few have made it into the job market or higher educational space.
These three groups in America all have fewer than 40 percent of
their youth graduate from high school and fewer than 6 percent from
college. Compare that with an 88 percent high school graduation rate
for the Japanese or an 11 percent graduation rate from college for
blacks. You can see that these Asian minority groups are
underrepresented in higher education and in skilled labor. I think it
would enrich everyone's experience if the system helped these people

more.
Is it true at Swarthmore, a college consistently ranking as one of
the most diverse in America? Overall, I've been ecstatic with the
experiences I've shared here with people of wildly different backgrounds and ethnicities. I don't have the exact numbers on it, but
my sense is that the Asians I know are mostly from ethnic backgrounds originating in China, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I also
have a couple of Vietnamese friends. Meanwhile, I haven't met a
soul with a Cambodian, Hmong or Laotian background.

Yeah, I know not too many of them make it to higher education,
but those who do from their culture should be considered as top can-

didates, students who have overcome tremendous odds and can contribute greatly to the diversity of students here. Swarthmore goes
out of its way to find underrepresented groups so we can all share
this rich experience. Here's one direction they could consider going
in to further that goal.
For a number of reasons
sociological, statistical, cultural, just
to name a few grouping peoples can be useful. But it is only useful
if it is applied at the right level. If the circles we draw are too large,
then we will fail to recognize the imbalances within them. Indeed,
the present system has done just this with a number of
underrepresented Asian groups, and we should consider amending
our structures and perceptions to remedy this problem.

A little robot in all of us
A chat about the future of robot combat with Battleßots co-founder Trey Roski
BY JONAH GOLD

Trey Roski has something close to a dream job. As president and co-founder of Battleßots,
Inc., the group responsible for organizing the robot combat tournaments televised on Comedy
Central's awe-inspiring nerd-culture-meets-pro-wrestling show "Battleßots," he spends a great
deal of his time in the company of big, dangerous machines of destruction. He sometimes even
makes his own robots, including the undefeated and now out-of-circulation bot "La Machine"
and his current project, the saw-bladed monstrosity "Ginsu," one or both of which may incidentally get the opportunity to administer an exhibition trashing to Jay Leno's personal Battleßot
"Chin-Killa" at the upcoming tournament, which will be N0v.16-19 in Las Vegas.
And on top of breaking big, cool, dangerous machines for a living and being the guy with the
chance to metaphorically slice Leno's giant evil bot to bits, Roski is a darn nice guy. A guy so nice
that, even though he's currently organizing a very large robot beat-down, working on Ginsu, and
dealing with bizarre requests from late-night talk show hosts, he was willing to take a good halfhour to talk to a nervous, amateur reporter from a college he'd never heard oT.
Not only is he darn nice, Roski is also darn hip. He says things like "It's so radical, it's cool" in
such a way that you believe it. And yes, the conversation did actually end with his telling me
"Call anytime." I may have to take him up on that.

So, how did this whole Battleßots thing get started? How did you get into this?
Well, I think there's a little robot in all of us. I played with my friends with R.C. cars and boats
and stuff like that all my life, and, you know
we've grown up with a lot of our friends who've
ended up becoming special effects engineers and mechanical artists We played with our toys,
our robots from R.C. car races, to actually running the cars into each other in the street, to
taking model rockets and trying to make them hit each other in the air. We got into destroying
things and building things I think the destroying part is kind of a reward, if you can rebuild it.
It's fun to break stuff that you made and can remake and create and build. It's kind of like building a sandcastle and jumping on it in the end
because then you get to make something else.
And it evolved... It just so happens thatthere are other people in the worldwho felt the same way
we did. Basically we make very dangerous machines that beat the living crap out ofeach other...
Battleßots gives you what [World Wide Wrestling Federation] gives you without the people getting hurt... The best part ofBattleßots is the creation. You build it and it's, uh it's radical. It's
so radical, it's cool. And people aren't getting hurt here.

How does what you guys are doing relate to what Comedy Central made out of it with
their show?
Basically Comedy Central has hired some talent... Those people that you see, like Dwyer and
Salisbury— do you know that they've never ever seen a robot or been to an event?
They've [Dwyer and Salisbury] never been to an event?
We host the events, we film it, we hand them [Sean Salisbury and Bil Dwyer] tape. When we're
done, they take it, add all the funny people in, and they air it. It's pretty simple. It's TV. It has a lot
of trickery. And while the event is 100% real, Comedy Central does add light to it. In general, the
event is hilarious. To think of a bunch of people spending a lot of time building things to get
fucked up is funny It's like nothing you've ever been to, when you're there The Super Bowl
doesn't compare to what you get from these events. It's just match after match after match. We
have 144 robots we are allowing in Vegas. That's twice as many as we've ever had before. We're

Did you take engineering at all in college? [Roski was a financial real estate major.]
Actually, no. No engineering at all. I probably would have loved to take engineering. I don't
consider myself an engineer. I come up with an idea, then I talk to a bunch of people, and they
either tell me how to cut the holes, or they go out and cut it.
What is the future of robot combat looking like?
We're looking at a thousand pounds
ten thousand a little bit after that. I'll take it to the
desert first. Then we'll do it on closed circuit TV. I'll take it to Mars. We'll fight on the moon; it's
closer than Mars. We'll just turn the moon into a giant Battleßox.

step three: FIGHT!

Has the phrase "robot army" ever crossed your minds?
It's crossed more than ours. That's all I can say about that. You'll have to tell me your classi-

fications.

Do you have any advice for a liberal arts student aspiring to enter the robot combat
arena?
Be yourself. That's pretty much what these are. These are extensions of people. It's kind of
like dressing up at Halloween. You build a robot. It dresses up for you. Ifyou're bad-ass, you have
a kick-ass robot. You can even be a wimpy bad-ass. I still wouldn't fuck with you in person. It's
funny ... once you build a scary robot... people are nicer to you.
Any final message to the Swarthmore College newspaper-reading public?
Build a Battleßot. Help your school. Help your engineering department. Have your department call us, make sure you're on the list to get this shit. Be yourself. This is a place to show your
art, and it's a place to tell how good your art really is.

'Requiem' more depressing

their expensive cosmetics or dislodging a single item of sexually suggestive

TWO-

Forces of destruction
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
We Swatties like robots.
We grew up watching them interact with humans in "Star Wars" and ill-premised sitcoms like "A Small Wonder" (remember how Vicki's "brother" would so
deftly undo the back of her dress and re-adjust her chips just in time to avoid discovery by others ofher mechanical origins?). We played with Transformers and
later enforced the marketing wisdom that a toy wasn't cool unless it could talk to
you, walk around, and pee in its pants, all at key intervals. Yes, the impetus for the
Furby, the toy that demands your lovin' and sasses back to you, began with us.
Being the generation of the future, the children who would later work technological miracles, we found special significance in those robotic characters. Someday, we believed, we would all have robots like the Jetsons' Rosie to do our dishes
and clean our sky-dwellings. Or maybe they would grow big and hulking and shun
their human creators and take over the world, sparking a Terminator-esque battle
ofdoom. But, whatever the case, we knew that robots would be a significant part of
our future.
Now we buildrobots. Or at least some of us do. As the reception held last month
for the three award-winning robots built by an engineering class showed, Swatties

have theknow-how to build well-crafted mechanicalbeings—robots that can search
out disaster victims, serve hors d'oeuvres, and identify colors.
But, sadly, we seem to have lost the child-like wonder once associated with the
creatures. The practical, personality-less search-bots Swatties build admittedly do
good work, but, uh, they just aren't fun. Where are the robots that perform no
legitimate function, or that, better, destroy everything in their sight?
As the New York Times announced this fall in a review of a gallery opening,
robots are Art. And Art is rarely functional, but it's beautiful and true, so we like it.
Sometimes it is nihilistic, but that's OK, too. In less serious robot-building circles,
for example, the spinning wheel of death is considered an essential component of
the ideal robot form.
In the recent upsurge of revenge-of-the-nerds shows like "Robot Wars" and
"Battleßots," pallid emaciated males compete to see whoserobot can destroy whose
while withstanding attacks from buff house-bots. For such shows, aspiring competitors will spend months making robots that they know will probably get totaled.
Why? Because, aside from the fact that an appearance on the show presents the
contestants with the only opportunity they'll ever get to interact with a buxom
blonde woman (the hostess), robots can be fun.
Inspired by these shows, I recently took it upon myself to build a perfectly impractical robot. When I was through with it, the flip of a switch would make my
robot's head and eyes light up and his heart spin around. By pressing another
button, I could make him let out a screeching inhuman noise. I christened him
Love Robot and sent him off to my boyfriend, hoping that his bomb-like appearance wouldn't cause suspicion among postal workers.
I highly recommend that more Swatties, especially those who (unlike myself)
have not taken exclusively humanities courses, pursue construction of such useless beings. Because if robots are our future, we had better make sure that it's
going to be a fun one.

designer clothing.
Or do you prefer downers? If the ennui and despair of this futile
existence make you scowl like a disgruntled Frenchman standing in front of
the new "MacDoh," then you should check out "Requiem For A Dream," the
new film by phenom director Darren Aronfsky, whose innovative, low-budget
debut "k" vaulted him to national recognition. But beware, viewer:
"Requiem" and "n" share little more than high quality and director. This film
is pure and uncut; no baking soda was added and no scene was edited out
to shield viewers from the potential of overdose.
If you hadn't guessed by the references in the preceding paragraph,
"Requiem" is about junkies and addiction. I'm an addict. So are you,
whether your required fix be alcohol, cigarettes, shopping, coffee, moviegoing (the nearest "Requiem" dealer is the Ritz East in central Philly on
Second Street between Chestnut and Hazelnut), music piracy, sex, beanie
babies or even (gasp!) studying.
"Requiem For A Dream," adapted from the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr.,
traces the downfall of four addicts' lives and their inability to control their
destructive urges. The film begins in the summer, as Harry Goldfarb (Jared
Leto) and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans, in his impressive departure from
playing stereotypical ghetto clowns) pursue their mild and transparently

EXISTENCE MAKE YOU SCOWL LIKE A
DISGRUNTLED FRENCHMAN STANDING IN FRONT OF

benevolent smack habits with Harry's ravishing girlfriend, Marion Silver
(Jennifer Connelly). The three addicts seem oddly responsible in their
addictions and no harm comes from their drug use as they glide from one
score to the next. They're having a good time, but they're not junkies. Really,
it's all completely harmless. As harmless as breaking onto the roof of an
apartment complex just to throw paper airplanes off into the distance, as
harmless as dealing a little bit on the side and pulling in some easy money.
Meanwhile, Harry's widowed mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn), lives in
isolation. She is enamored by and addicted to her television, but carries on
an innocuous, harmless existence. When she gets a call telling her she has
been selected to appear on TV, she is ecstatic and rushes to dye her hair
bright red and put on her favorite red dress. When she can't zip it up, she
commits herself to dieting her weight away until she can squeeze herself
into the dress, which is rife with nostalgic meaning. She is unable, however,
to deny herself the rich foods she has become addicted to eating; so she
visits a doctor to help her lose the weight. The doctor gives her multicolored
pills to take, which she finds suppress her appetite and make her peppier
and more energized.
From this point, the season changes to fall and, eventually, to winter
(note the metaphorical significance of the change in seasons). And things
begin to go bad, as they inevitably must in a junkie flick, but they go bad in
such a charged mix of unlucky downward spurts and agonizingly slow minor
mistakes that it almost makes you desperate yourself. Not desperate for
the next fix, perhaps, but nearly. You become desperate for any glimmer of
hope; you rationalize with the characters that things can get better if I just
do, if I just watch, one more achingly degrading thing.
Any further synopsis or analysis of these characters' downfalls would
marginalize the film's astonishing and ineffable communication of the
emotions of desperation and fear. Watching "Requiem for a Dream" is the
psychological equivalent to having your chest plate pried open and your stillbeating heart sand-blasted by anonymous men in white sterile suits and gas
masks. You don't even cry. You just wonder where the hell these anonymous
men with sand-blasters came from and stare down at your own chest and
try to remember what it looked like before. This movie will make you feel
guilty for your narcissistic self-pity over unfinished schoolwork, because
these characters' lives are so incomparably horrible. Shame on you.

Deltron 3030 wants
you to join the fight
for the human race
BY JONAH GOLD
The dark future of mankind is fast approaching,
and it is not at all funky. Ignorance, evil
corporations, overcrowded cities and whack MCs
abound. Welcome to the year three thousand
thirty. Rap super-group Deltron 3030 wants you to
join the fight for the future of the human race.
Their self-titled debut is a sci-fi-hop concept album
that is quite possibly the best piece of music ever
to successfully rhyme "ionic bonding" with
"moronic pondering."
The three members of the collective, who are
on relatively-new hip-hop label 75 Ark
entertainment, are all formidable in their own
right. Rapper Del tha Funkee Homosapien, alias
Deltron Zero, is one of the best in his generation
of smart, underground MCs. Combine that with
amazingly textured production from Dan "The
Automator" Nakamura, billed here as the
Cantankerous Captain Aptos, and scratching from
turntable-master Kid Koala, who in 3030 is known
as Skiznod the Boy Wonder, and the net product is
a true hip-hop force to be reckoned with.
The album is, first and foremost, the best rap
concept album since, well, The Automator's last
two such efforts, Prince Paul's "Handsome Boy
Modeling School" and Kool Keith's medical-outerspace-porn masterpiece "Dr. Octogonycologist."
Due to the shared science fiction motifs and
correspondingly spacey beats and samples,
"Deltron 3030" is particularly reminiscent of "Dr.
Octogonycologist," but Keith's strange obsessions
are missing. They are replaced by a more tightly
portrayed future world and something resembling
an actual story line. What this story line consists
of, exactly, is a little hard to discern; the plot
involves the heroic trio fighting evil corporations
and no-good rappers for the good of the common
man, if that helps. But most great rock concept
albums lack a coherent plot (think "Tommy"
without the movie), and so, in this respect,
"Deltron 3030"'s plot problem really isn't a
problem. All but the most anal should be able to
easily sit back and enjoy the story regardless of
whether they could retell it in simple, unrhymed
English.

The "feel" of the album is really what makes it
work, though. The Automator's slow beats and
backing tracks combine excellently with Kid
Koala's turntable work and interlaced samples
from old sci-fi movies and other Del songs.
Massive amounts of backup talent are also
displayed in the album (e.g.: Prince Paul, Bjork
producer Mark Bell, Damon Albarn of Blur and
Sean Lennon, John's kid). A particularly

Mustard: making the cut
BY JOEY SPADOLA
According to an Ann Landers article
that I recently happened upon, human be-

ings share 30 to 40 percent of their genetic
makeup with, of all things, the mustard
plant. This greatly surprised me. Mostly
because I had no idea thatmustard comes
from a plant. But of course this quaint statistic has many other stunning and farreaching implications and led to me to ask
various questions of undeniable importance, such as: Does catsup also come from
a plant? And: Why is catsup, contrary to
the sensible advertising of Heinz, spelled
"catsup"?
Initially, I could only wonder about
such things, because, as you will have
noted, biology is not my forte. In fact,
about the only thing I can recall of the
subject, besides that without it countless
important species of butterfly would go
unidentified and unnamed, is a particular moment in my junior high biology
class in which I was tragically unsettled
in pondering
how Anton von
Leeuwenhoek managed to obtain sperm
for the purposes of microscopic investigation. My fragile pre-pubescent mind was
not prepared to admit the obvious truth
ofthe matter, but nonetheless my thoughts
were continually haunted by exchanges

such as this:

ANTON VON LEEUWENHOEK'S

MOTHER: Anton, vhat are you doing in
there??
ANTON VON LEEUWENHOEK: Science! Go avay!
What I also remember of my experi-

ence with biology is having to attend the

county science fair, at which I presented

a project evidencing the highest degree of
original thought and unadulterated scientific curiosity. It was entitled, "The Effects
of Electricity on Amoebas and Other
Things That Appeared at One Point to Be
Living in My Pond Water Samples." In this
experiment, I poured pond water into a
soup bowl and (I swear I actually did this)
ran a sizeable current of electricity
through the water with the help of a 28volt battery, in order to observe the effects
on the various organisms. I'm not sure
what I expected to happen, but the results,
as I now see with stark clarity, were not
such as to startle most folks whom we
would classify as sane. The judge at the
fair who evaluated the quality of my scientific efforts did not seem overly impressed. In fact, I recall his saying, "While
you were at it, did you also test the effects

of petroleum oil on the digestive tracts
of field mice?" I said that I hadn't, responding in all honesty. It occurred to
me only later that we weren't even permitted to use vertebrates in our experi-

ment and that this fellow wasn't being
entirely sincere.
In any event, my competence in biological reasoning being what it is, I decided to investigate "the mustard plant
paradox" further by consulting one of
Swarthmore's eminent biology majors,
whom one can attract easily just by walking around the campus with a sign reading "How to cheat successfully on the
MCAT exam." After finding a particularly well-versed bio major, I proceeded
to explain my unresolved difficulties to
her and asked that she divulge any biological facts that might shed light on the
matter.
She was very obliging and attempted
for a number of hours to explain things
to me. Sadly, however, her efforts were
in vain, because I just couldn't get it. She
tried everything: straight-forward lecturing, diagrams, role-playing (in which I
acted out the part of a DNA molecule) and
even a story involving, among other

characters, "Minnie the Mitochondria."

About the only thing I managed to determine was that catsup, to my considerable
disappointment, does not come from a

plant, apparently for the same reason
that money does not grow on trees.
But I could not rest until I resolved
the matter of our kinship with the mustard plant. And so I turned to a source of
scientific information more my speed,
namely Bill Nye the Science Guy. My
only grievance with this great show is
that I never have the required materials for the "do-it-at-home" experiments.
For instance, on this particular occasion,
you ONLY needed the following items,
which are supposedly lying around most
ordinary homes: three Mongolian mustard plants, preferably aged no more than
two weeks, half a barrel of crude oil, a
phonograph, baking powder and several
paper clips. And we all know how slim
the chances are of just having baking
powder around somewhere. Luckily,
even without doing the home experiment, one can still learn a tremendous
amount from Bill Nye's show; I know
that what I learned about the mustard
plant paradox was absolutely startling.
According to the Science Guy, the
theory of evolution, as proposed by Darwin, is way off the mark. It was merely

Mary Campbell Phoenix Staff

the psychedelic delusion of a man
who, so to speak, did more with the
herbs on his little islands than just
make note of their genera and species.
It turns out, we aren't the descendants
of monkeys or apes at all; rather, we
are the direct and traceable descendants of, you guessed it, the mustard
plant. Mustardicus Erectus now replaces Homo Habilis on our line of evolution. Even as I write this, "Scopes
mustard plant trials" are being litigated in a few of the less progressive
states.
In light of this discovery, I would
like to take the opportunity to ask animal rights activists to reconsider their
priorities. It is the mustard plant,
more than any stupid cows or pigs,
that deserves our watchful care our
protection from injustice; for they are
all but our brothers. And this warning applies especially to vegans. Isn't
it strange that the very same people
who will not eat a particular food if a
bumble bee at some point landed on
one of its ingredients will happily condone the merciless slaughter of poor
defenseless mustard plants
our very
own kin! To them I say, stick to such
foods as peaches, because at least they
come from a can.

memorable 32-second cameo track comes from
geek-rap savant MC Paul Barman, who plays a guy
named Cleofis Randolph the Patriarch, and gets
away with rhyming "apocalypse" and "chocolate
chips" in the amount of time it would take most
rappers to get started. "Deltron 3030" has
moments this good, and it has them in
abundance. That alone should be enough to sell it.
Regrettably, this is not the case. The sad fact is
that a rap album like this one, completely devoid
of gangster swagger or party jams, has limited
appeal. Don't look for "Deltron 3030" on the
Billboard Charts anytime soon. The one place
where this album is practically bound to succeed
is online, where the nerd community will eat up
songs like the soon-to-be hacker anthem "Virus,"
which contains lines like "I want it so file
replication is a chore / Lights out shut down entire
White House." In the year 2000 Deltron 3030
won't outsell Puffy. Luckily, we've got a good one

Slightly off-kilter
How having a symmetrical face could help you get some
So my slightly off-kilter, quirky friend,
fromwhom I've come to expect such things,
was recently showing me this new Web site
she ran
across the other day,

www.amihotornot.com. When the screen

began to fill with shot after sickening shot
of old glamour poses and horrible snapshots,
I couldn't stifle my laugh. It's hard to believe there's an entire Web site centered on

people's submission of self-portraits to be
harshly judged as "Hot or Not" by Internet
users everywhere.
My first response was astonishment, at
both the semi-pornographic nature of some
of the displayed photos and the fact that
people are actually self-absorbed enough to
submit pictures of themselves. In spite of
my disgust, I have to admit, it was pretty
funny, though I doubt intentionally so. As
we clicked, rating submissions on a scale of
1-10 to determine whether the pictured person was "hot or not," then comparing our
decision with the cumulated average, I began to wonder why there was such a variances in scores. Why is it that someone we
didn'tfind really repulsive had gotten an average score of 11? Or why had someone we
didn'tfind stunningly spectacular weighed
in with a 9.8 average?
Then, tiring of this site, my buddy showed
me something else: Suzanne Wu's masterpiece-of-distortion photographs, which were
really just theresult of too muchidle time, a
reasonably sophisticated computer program
and Suzanne's electrically-charged imagination.

standards?
In purely psychological terms, humans are
naturally attracted to symmetrical faces. Recent
studies ofphysical traits responsible for sexual
attraction have found that, as a whole, humans
prefer "regular" facial structures. We aren't in
searchof anything extraordinary;we just want
average-looking faces.
Evolutionary psychologists go further, explaining thehuman symmetry hang-up in terms
of thebest interest ofour genes. Apparently, the
more regular his mug, the less likely it is for his
genes to combine with mine and produce some
dangerous mutations that could lead to seriously
hideous or defective offspring.
That's all well and good. And, for the most
part, I buy the theory. Still, I think there's a lot
more room for individual taste thanevolutionary psychology allows. This is why the scores
on the "Am I Hot or Not" site vary so widely
and why, though few and far between and in
spite of the generally pessimistic attitude expressed by Forum users, relationships do seem
to pop up occasionally on our infamously ugly
campus. Freedom ofindividual preference, not
completely constrained by symmetrical stipulations, also explains why, despite symmetrical features, the guys on the Daily Jolt maintain Swat's absence of good-looking girls and
why I would contend, having spent a humiliating amount of time ranking "Hot or Not" photos, some ofSuzanne's asymmetrical creations
wouldn't fare so badly.
Perhaps the dissimilarity ofattraction criteria is the result of differing degrees of desperation, or perhaps it's merely proof that our tastes
are indeed divergent; I'm not sure. In either case,
somebody's attracted (even if marginally) to
someone else, somebody's admired or overlooked the quirkiness ofsomeone else's features

OF

FAITH

IN DEPTH

Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman Phoenix Staff

Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman Phoenix Staff

The three members of the Muslim Student Association, Rajaa Shakir, AN Hamoudi and
Phil Hoefs, say there isn't much institutional support for the minority religions at
Swarthmore. "You feel a little isolated," Hoefs said.

On Friday nights, Swarthmore Christian Fellowship, a group that draws an average of
40 students a week to its services, holds a meeting in one of the Kohlberg classrooms
for lack of a better space.

A leap of faith: Religion at Swat
The

varied religious communities and many individuals committed to religion on this campus show that,
far from being mutually exclusive, faith and intellect

can complement each other quite nicely. But the communities would like to move toward a point where the campus as
a whole can accept the synthesis of the two.
As religious advisors and activists push generally for
increased institutional support for spirituality and specifically for the creation of an interfaith center, they are slowly
but steadily making their voices heard.

Ambivalent attitudes toward religion

When

Mike Camilleri 'O3 tells others about his involvement with groups like Swarthmore Christian
Fellowship (SCF) and Swarthmore Protestant Community (SPC), he comes up against a lot of preconceived
ideas about his faith and character. "There's a quote on our
quote board in Willets that says 'Ugh, Christians.' That's
the whole quote," he said.
"People just have this stereotype of religious people,"
Camilleri continued. "I'm not an NRA member, I don'thate
gay people, and there are a lot of other things that aren't

me."

other religious students on campus share
Camilleri's experiences in encountering stereotypes about
their values. Sara Posey 'O4, a participant in SPC, said that
in a diversity workshop during freshman orientation "at
least two people said they had run into Christians who were
tolerant anyway. The thing I run into most is not exactly
wanting to tell people I'm Christian because they'll think
right-wing, intolerant."
that we're
"I sense that there's a lot of apprehension
out there converting people," said Aisha Talib 'Ol, a steward
for SPC.
On a campus dominated by academic life, many also find
that believing in a faith leads to doubts about their intellectual integrity.
Emily Tancredi-Brice 'O4, who participates in an informal Baha'i group with two other students, said, "I think
many people have the perception that with people who are
religious, there's some lack of reason."
Protestant Student Advisor Pauline Allen said that in
the eight years she has been at Swarthmore, she has heard
many students complain of this prevailing attitude. "In addition to there being an assumption that you're religious
right, there's also an assumption that you're not intellectually first-rate if you're a believer. You're intellectually immature, weak-minded," she said.
In an environment where impassioned conversation
reigns holy, many students find that their religions quickly
become subjects of discussion.
Some find that Swatties are more curious than contenMany

tious. Malika Krasik-Geiger 'O2, whois active in Ruach, said,
"A lot of people like to ask questions.
I remember freshman year answering all these questions about Jewish music and what the rules are and what the holidays are.
I
really love to talk about it."
But when questions extend into matters ofbelief, others
find the answers don't come as easily. "They want it broken
down into a philosophy more than a faith," Sabrina Boyer
'Ol, who identifies as Catholic, saidof the students who challenge her.
"You can't intellectualize it, and this place loves to intellectualize," agreed Jesse Hartigan 'O4, also Catholic.
"I don't think faith should really be about arguing, but it
often comes down to that," Emily Schrader 'O4 said.
In the end, most students in the position of defending
their faith find that while others are tolerant, discussions
don't always reach a point of mutual understanding. Phil
Hoefs 'O2, who is one of only three students active in the
Muslim Student Association, said, "A lot of times it just gets
left to you're religious and this person is not. You leave it at
...

...

that."

Turning to their community

Because

understanding is not always found in the general college community, support by others who share

their faith is critical for religious students.
The Muslim Student Association organizes weekly trips
to a mosque in Philadelphia, and on campus the three members meet socially, Hoefs said.
"You feel a little isolated," Hoefs said. "The fact that you
walk around campus and there's only three or five people
that you have the possibility of even seeing can be really
disheartening, so it's nice to meet up occasionally withthem
and just talk."
"Some friends are surprised that I have time to go to
[but] coming to Mass relieves the stress a little bit
Mass
and gives me strength to go on for the new week," Yee Lin
Tan 'O3 said.
Ruach facilitator Ann Finkelstein 'Ol said that involvement in Jewish activities has been a defining experience
for her. "For me what's been most helpful in terms of dealing with Swat is the sense of community I get from [Ruach]."
Finkelstein added that in her first years of college, Friday services were extremely important to her. "It was nice
to have one meal that was cooked by students and eaten
with my family other students," she said.
It seems that many other students share this desire for
community religious events on campus are routinely wellattended. In a typical week approximately 30 students attend Mass, about 30 go to Shabbat services for Ruach, 40
attend SCF's Friday meeting, and 20 attend SPC-led Protestant services. Smaller discussion groups like SPC's Pizza
...

and Parable and Ruach's Wednesday discussion group often draw 15 to 20 students.
Father John Ames, Catholic advisor to students at
Swarthmore, Haverford and Bryn Mawr, stressed that such
gatherings and worships services are critical for students
of faith. "It's good that students can come together as a group

and see that there are other students who share their belief," he said. "When they come together on a Sunday, they
don'tfeel insulated or isolated. We all need that mutual
...

support."

Outside the religious communities, that support isn't so
strong. "There's definitely a push to privatize your religion
as something that can't be fully shared with other people,"

Boyer said.

The number of students who identify as religious but
primarily live a private faith is relatively large. SPC has a
mailing list of 175, the Catholic NewmanAssociation counts
140 students in its membership, and Ruach has some 250
subscribers. Dean of Students Bob Gross said that in one
recent year about 700 students participated in some aspect
of religious life.
An unscientific Phoenix poll conducted Monday night
in Sharpies revealed that 63 percent of the 201 students surveyed affiliate with a religious faith. Of the total surveyed,
42 percent said they actively practice their faith while on
campus. Half of those students said they worship regularly.
"There's a lot more religious fervor out there than it
might seem on the surface," Ames said.

Toward a new multiculturalism

If

so many students are religious on campus, why, then,
is faith often a closeted matter? Professor Mark Wallace,

chairof the religion department, suggested that the
college's institutional culture pushes students to privatize
a very significant part of their lives.
"The college seems conflicted and confused about its
Quaker heritage," he said. "It sends a message to students
that religion is a private affair and that the college will take
a hands-off approach to encouraging in a public way students' religious identity."
For religious students, that identity often impacts many
other aspects of their lives, and is not so easily compartmentalized.

"My faith is what I try to make the fuel for any activity
that I do," Tancredi-Brice said.
Yet many feel that the college-sponsored discussion and
questioning about intellectual matters largely do not extend
into areas of faith. "There really is no religious culture on
this campus," said Rajaa Shakir 'O4, an observant Muslim.
The idea that religion is culture, indeed, is on the tip of

Issues of faith often neglected at Swat

many people's tongues.
"We're starting to understand faith as a part of culture,"
Allen said. "We're talking about multiculturalism, and religion is a part of that."

"Judaism isn't only this traditional idea of faith," said
Rachel Kobrin, the Jewish advisor. "Judaism is at its core
being a part of the people.... Judaism is a culture, it's a religion, there's a language connected to it, there are foods connected to it, there's an ethnicity connected to it, there's a land
connected to it. It's really in many ways a civilization."
For many students, in fact, religion is entirely culture. "More
students on this campus are connected to the cultural aspect of
being Jewish and the social aspect of being Jewish .. .more so
than theactual God aspect ofbeing religious," Kobrin said.
And with the current offerings in religious programming,
students like Emily Zackin 'O2, who identifies strongly with

Jewish culture but does not believe in God, feel like services

that address their needs are lacking.
"I'm so affected by this culture and it's not something I

want to give up," Zackin said. "I'd like to be a part of the
Jewish community and feel good about that, but I don'tthink
I can if it still centers around that belief," she said.
To be sure, the campus ministries try to cater to a wide
variety of religious beliefs, but in the end, resources are limited, and the groups end up focusing most on those students
who are most active in their faiths.
"Bond is like an incubator to nurture the faith identities
ofindividual students, and that's a wonderful thing," Wallace
said, pointing out that it was a struggle for the groups to get
the facility in the first place. He added, however, that it is
time for the college "to go the next step" and move toward
making the college as a whole embracing of religion.
"I think [the college has] made a half-turn toward a
multicultural education, not a full turn," Wallace said, applauding the concern now given toward issues of sexual orientation
and race but noting that it should be extended to religion.
And doing that redefining multiculturalism to include
religion
means bringing discussion of religion to the public
level. "I think we miss the boat if we only talk about religion
privately.... There are ways that the college could address both
the private and the public dimensions ofreligion," Wallace said.
Ames agreed. "If we're going to advocate as a college community that we want to be open to search and we want to be
open to questioning and we want to be respectful of individuals in their beliefs, I would hope that religion is afforded that
same status," he said.

Possibility of an interfaith center

For

religion to stand on par with other components of
diversity and for faith to become a public matter on
this campus, many say that the college will have to make
some institutional changes and show students of faith that it
stands behind them financially as well as philosophically.
For several years, campus religious advisors and activists
have fueled much of theireffort into the expansion ofinterfaith
resources. The Bond groups currently hold a number of interfaith events, like last week's silent prayer vigil for peace in the
Middle East or the upcoming interfaith Thanksgiving service.
"We have the belief in God, we have that connection in
that sense. I think in this kind ofenvironment that brings us
together," Camilleri, a participant in SCF and SPC, said.
Religious advisors and activists say that such activity has

laid a firm foundation in interfaithaction and the college is
now at a point where it should create an interfaith center

modeled on the Intercultural Center.
Importantly, they say, such a center should have a salaried interfaith director. The current advisors are entirely paid

Allen by Partners in Ministry,
by outside organizations
Kobrin by Hillel and Ames by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. An interfaith director who would be part of the college
administration could more easily bring concerns ofstudents
offaith to the attention of the college.
But the most common concern cited by proponents of an
interfaith center is that under the current system, members
of non-Judeo-Christian religions are often overlooked.
"I wouldlike there to be more support for the minority religions," Allen said. Allen tries to provide some of that support
herself, but the need forit is often more than she alone can handle.

"We're so busy taking care of the needs of our own students that it's difficult to give the proper time and attention
to other issues involving religious life," Ames said. "We have
students ofall other kinds of denominations on this campus,
and we don't have the luxury of time to be able to deal with
those students and some of their needs."
For students like Shakir, belonging to an underrepresented
religion can be a very lonely experience. Though her roommate is a devout Christianand identifies with Shakir's experience as a religious student, Shakir misses the support of a
strong Muslim community. Without that, she said,
Swarthmore is "distracting" for her, and its intensely secular culture makes it difficult for her to live her faith.
"I go home every weekend, which I don't think I'll stop
any time soon," she said. "It serves a need."
Both the Baha'i and Muslim student groups remain active through affiliation with outside communities. Asidefrom
the smallBaha'i and Muslim student groups, Swarthmore is
also home to students of Hindu, Buddhist, Native American,
Pacific Islander and a variety of other faiths. The Phoenix
poll indicates that perhaps as much as 7 percent of the campus identifies with non-Judeo-Christian faiths.
Dean ofStudentsBob Gross saidthatthe college has included
plans for an interfaith center in its long-range planning efforts,
but that serious consideration of such a center will not begin
until the campus community showsbroader support for it.
"We've talked about it, and we're really waiting for a little
more energy to get behind it," Gross said. "We're waiting to see
the demandbuilding, as it did for the IC throughout the 1980s."
The IC was established in 1991 after "much lobbying for
some years," Gross said.
For the time being, Gross pointed out thatthe college has
sponsored an Interfaith Council in recent years and salaried
a student interfaith intern.
According to Gross, interfaith centers have been more easily integrated into colleges with long histories of paid chaplain positions. "Swarthmore was founded by Quakers who
basically don't do thatkind of thing," Gross added.
Quakers do have a history of seeing religion as a "private,
inward affair," Wallace said, but he added that the college
has often ignored its Quaker legacy. "I would like the college
to self-consciously think about how to articulate its Quaker
heritage in relation to its current mission," he said. "I don't
think there's been given much thought to that."
Articulating values, it seems, is expensive. Endowing an
interfaith center would cost severalmillion dollars, Gross said.
"[An interfaith center] had to compete with a bunch ofother
good ideas, and in the absence of strongly voiced demand for

it, it was hard to say that it was [the best idea]," he said.
For Wallace, however, that sum of money shouldn't be a
defining reason not to construct an interfaith center. "The
college has spectacular academic resources," he said. "Having taught here for ten years and having taught other places,
I'm stunned at how lavish and thoughtful and committed the
college is to students' intellectual lives, but students are more
than big giant heads."

Finding the future in the past

Within

the college's religious communities and even
outside them, momentum for such a center is building. The growing religion department is proof that
interest in matters of faith is not restricted to those who
practice a religion.
Recent classes have each had about 20-30 religion majors,
according to Wallace, and many of those students are motivated by an interest in spirituality rather than a background
of religion.
An interfaith center would be an ideal place to discuss
many world issues, Wallace said, citing the recent turmoil in
the Middle East as example. "At the core of the conflict are
deep-seeded religious practices, and an interfaith center
wouldbe the right forumfor getting at one dimension, if not
the most important dimension, of this topic."
Indeed, Kobrin has already begun organizing an interfaith
panel discussion on the situation in the Middle East. But a
center with a greater campus presence would make such a
discussion more accessible to those not directly involved in

religious communities. Though he said the religious groups
are pleased to have facilities in Bond, Ames added that it would
be nice to have an interfaith center more centrally located.
Such a center should be readily available to all the campus
community because, the religious advisors emphasized, spirituality encompasses issues that transcend formal religion.
The advisors have consistently been a voice for a more

balanced student existence on this campus. Ames cited a proposal raised last semester to hold final exams on Sundays.
The advisors objected, he said, less because of explicit religious concerns than because "that's one more day that's been
intruded upon for academic endeavors."
He cited the "24-7" mentality under which the college operates. "I don't think that's healthy," he said.

Wallace agreed. That was a "human moral issue," he said.
"I don't think Sunday should be a sancrosanct day because
religious groups think it should be a sacrosanct day, but I
think we should have one or two days in the week where we
pull away from academic production towards a more, quiet
meditative kind of lifestyle."
In the end, such reasoning won out, and it was decided
thatfinal exams would not be held on Sundays.
But for each advance, many more spiritual concerns are
not given a voice. Students like Hoefs, Shakir and Tancredi-

Brice find themselves without an advocate in the administration. Others, like Zackin, seek more attention to the cultural aspects of religion. And the many who hold a general
spiritual curiosity and interest in religious affairs find their
questions unanswered outside the academic setting.
The solution to these needs lies, perhaps, in our roots.
"I think now we've gone too far in the direction ofthe secular, critical side of things and I'd like to see us strike a balance
between that and the Quaker contemplative life," Wallace said.
"The college talks about intellectual excellence and ethical intelligence... . I would also like us to be spiritually self-aware."

Seminar highlights past

BY GERRIT HALL

BY NICOLE BRUNDA

The newly formed progressive group Ignite! sponsored a well-attended political education session on
campus last Friday. The education seminar was student-run and focused on historical activist movements among various minority groups.
The evening began with all the lights out; speakers illuminated themselves with a lighter as they
recited quotes from famous political activists from
history. The rest of the evening featured student lec-

Student Council discussed a possible
February collection honoring Martin
Luther King, Jr. at its meeting Monday
night. Council members also discussed
a proposal to the Curriculum Committee to extend the pass/fail deadline until

after midterms.
Members of Student Council met
with vice president Maurice Eldridge to
discuss a possible collection in the beginning of February honoring Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr. According to Delonte
Gholston 'O2, Student Council represen-

tures about activist groups throughout history.
Ignite! grew out of meetings by activists from sev-

eral groups on campus so that groups could share
information and support each other.
"There's been growing momentum to form a uni-

fied progressive left community at Swarthmore," said
Nina Schichor 'O2, one of the key organizers of the
group. "[lgnite!] provides a forum for all the activists who would like to share what's going on with
their respective groups."
The group also hopes to provide internal education to its members. Ignite! intends to sponsor six
more seminars in months to come, according to
Mattie Weiss 'Ol, one of the students who organized
the seminar.
Overall, participants felt that the seminar was a
success. "Getting eighty people in the room to sit for
so long and be interested is quite a feat," Schichor
said.

tative to the Board of Managers and one
of the students present at the meeting,
Eldridge was very supportive of the idea
and promised to work with Student
Council to make the collection come
about.

Of the choice of honoree, Gholston
said, "We want someone who will appeal
and unify the entire student body." He
also commented that the council is looking for a speaker concerned with civil
rights to honor of Martin Luther King.
Some of the names of possible speak-

and Odetta, a folk band. Whether the
college can persuade one of these speakers to come speak will depend largely on

alumni connections, according to
Gholston.
Student Council also discussed
changing the time of the collection,

Morello brought up the pass/fail procedure at Brown University, which al-

night before the final exam to choose the
pass/fail option. Morello said he would
research how smaller liberal arts schools
similar to Swarthmore deal with pass/
fail options before the Student Council
writes its proposal.

on a Tuesday or Wednesday night. The

council hopes that changing the time
will draw a larger student attendance to

the event.
Co-chair JordanBrackett 'Ol said that
the council hopes to sponsor several
similar collections in future semesters.
Later in the meeting, Curriculum
Committee representative Chris Morello
'O3 discussed the possibility of extending the time available for a student to
choose the pass/fail option for a class,
one of the issues brought up at the last
Curriculum Committee meeting. Student Council agreed to pursue writing a
proposal asking the faculty to push back

Football faces Washington
and Lee Saturday to close
successful season
BY JUSTIN KANE

The Garnet Tide closes out what is already their most successful
season since 1995 Saturday against Washington and Lee at 1 p.m. at
Clothier Field.
Despite losing 41-21 to Western Maryland last Saturday,
Swarthmore will end the season with at least three wins, including
two Centennial Conference victories. The Garnet Tide's 3-5 record
is Swarthmore's best mark since its 5-5 1995 season.
Washington and Lee comes into the contest with a 5-4 record, including a 32-19 victory over Johns Hopkins, who beat Swarthmore
35-0 earlier this season. However, the Generals are trying to recover
from a late-season slide that has seen them drop four of their last
five games.

The Generals will lean heavily on their rushing game after losing their first-string quarterback to injury two weeks ago. Last week,
their No. 2 quarterback was knocked out for the season with a fractured jaw, leaving only one true quarterback to fill the position. But
Swarthmore will still have to contend with versatile running back
Marc Watson, who has already piled up 1,224 rushing yards this season, a Washington and Lee record.
The Garnet Tide will once again rely on running back Ken Clark
'O3 and a defense that has seemed porous in recent weeks. Clark has
already set single-season Swarthmore records for carries (219) and
rushing yards (902), and with 98 yards against Washington and Lee,
would become the first Swarthmore player to gain 1,000 rushing yards
in a season.
Last week against Western Maryland also saw the emergence of
quarterback Chris Loeffler 'O4, who filled in for starting quarterback Scott Murray 'Ol in the fourth quarter. Loeffler completed 6-of-6 passes for 100 yards and two touchdowns, including a 47-yard strike
to wide receiver Keith McManimen 'O2 and a four-yard pass to tight
end Robert Melick 'O3.
The Garnet Tide had trouble containing the Green Terror of Western Maryland, giving up 411 yards on the ground and 34 points in
the first half. By the end of the third quarter, the No. 16 Green Terror had built an insurmountable 41-7 lead and put its second- and
third-string teams in to mop up.

Soccer ends season in six-game slide
BY TED CHAN

Despite dropping their season
finale against Haverford and finishing the season on a six-game
slide, the Garnet men's soccer
team had reason to smile. After
all, records don't show everything. This team played well together and had a good time this

season.

The Garnet put forth an impressive effort against archrival
Haverford, but in the end they
were simply overmatched by the
Fords, whose record improved to
10-7with their win. The final score
was 2-0.
The team appreciated the opportunity to play in front of a large
home crowd. "I would like to

it really does
thank all the fans
make a difference when we have a
big rowdy crowd to support us," said
defender Charles Withers 'O2.
Swarthmore loses three seniors
but should return a strong squad

next year. Among the players returning will be their leading scorer, forwardKevin Pastor 'O4, a quick strike
scorer, and field general midfielder
Frank Sersale di Cerisano 'O2. They
will also have most of a strong defensive contingent, including captain
Cam MacDearmid 'O3, backed by
Milla 'O3, one of the
conference's top goalkeepers.
This season will allow some of the
members of the team to look back
fondly on their season. Frank Yeo
'Ol, a four-year striker, said, "This
year has been the first time that I've
Chris

had a lot of fun playing for Swat
and I've developed closer rela-

tionships with the players."
Yeo made the season's most
spectacular play when he scored
on a bicycle kick against Ursinus.
"I should have just retired right
then," said Yeo with a smile.
Outgoing captain Ryan

Neiheiser 'Ol thinks head coach
Don Norton's young team has a
bright future, "During these past
two years, team morale and confidence has increased," he said,
"Something that sets the freshman class apart is their excitement the game and building up
the program. We should be seeing results soon."

Winter sports preview
BY TED CHAN

Men's Basketball
Last year: 3-21 (2-11 in the Centennial Conference)
Outlook: After struggling last season, this season

could be another rebuilding one for the Garnet unless
its younger players step it up quickly. The bright side
for head coach Lee Wimberly is that this is a two-year
plan all of his major contributors will be underclassmen. They'll be led by gunning swingman David Pearce
'O3 (10.0 points per game), last year's leading scorer; 6'7"
pivot man David Gammill 'O2 (8.6 points per game, 5.0
rebounds per game) and slashing forward Kyle Lewis
'O2 (9.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg). Pearce and Lewis can put points on
the board in bunches.
The key for this team, though, may be the contributions of Eran Ganot 'O3 and Joey Armstead 'O3, who are
expected to step it up big time this season after showing
flashes of brilliance during the second half of last season. This team played better last year than its record
indicated and so should double or triple its win total this
season.
-

Men's Swimming
Last year: 7-4 (4-2,3rd

in the Centennial Conference)
Outlook: All-American Ted Sherer 'Ol tops the list of
returnees for the Garnet, who perennially finish in the top
three in the conference. Sherer is the conference record
holder in the 100 and 200 breaststroke.
John Lillvis, Jason Kerensky, Mike Dudley and David
Whitehead are the core of a strong returning sophomore
class that gives the rest of the lineup strength. The team
finished with only nine swimmers last season, but the
majority of them are conference placers. They'll be short
on numbers again this year, but that won't prevent them
from racking up strong team performances and individual
accolades.

Men's Indoor Track
Last Year: Fourth place

Badminton
in the Centennial Conference Cham-

pionship
Last year: 3-10 (0-6 in the Centennial Conference)
Outlook: Twelfth-year head coach Ron Tirpak hopes that
quality, not quantity, will be a formula for success. A trio of
juniors with conference championship aspirations will lead
the Garnet. 197Keith McManimen 'O2 (197 lb. weight class)
and Justin Pagliei 'O2 (heavyweight) were abroad last season but are among the conference's top pound-for-pound
wrestlers. McManimen will be the favorite as his weight,
while Pagliei, second in the conference as a freshman, will
need to overcome two-time conference champion Tyler
Cafhey of Muhlenberg. Ted Chan 'O2 (174 lb. weight class)
defeated last year's conference champions at 165 lbs. and 174
lbs. and is another top contender.
Around those three, the Garnet will try to fill in the
lineup with younger, less experienced wrestlers. They
won't win many dual meets, but Tirpak hasn't scheduled many; he's shifted the focus toward tournament
wrestling by adding three new tourneys to the schedule.
There is the possibility of a tremendous amount of indi-

vidual success for this squad.

Women's Indoor Track
Last Season: Fifth place in the Centennial Conference
Championships
Outlook: Here's the long and short of it for the women
in winter track: Jokotade Agunloye 'Ol and Imo Akpan
'O2. Agunloye is arguably the best distance runner in
conference history and Akpan is arguably the best
sprinter. While Agunloye's biggest exploits have mainly
been achieved in cross country, Akpan has excelled in
the winter, breaking the conference and school records
in the 55-meter dash last season. Sarah Jay 'Ol also excels in middle distance.
In the field, the team has lost All-American long and
triple jumper Desiree Peterkin to graduation. However,
they will have two strong athletes back: shot-putter
Clara Fuchsman 'Ol and high-jumper Jessica

Rickabaugh 'O2.

Outlook: With the exception ofMark Jeuland 'OL who'sbeen
one of the conference's best distance runners over the lastfour
years, this is a young team that is looking to establish itself.
Jeuland was second in the conference last season in the 5000meter run. Keith Gilmore 'Ol is a contender at the conference
level at the middle distance events. If he can shave a second or
two off his times from last season in the 400-meter, he could
win the conference. Supporting those two are a number of talented athletes, many of whom aren't track andfield specialists.
There's a fairly good amount of athleticism on this team and
there couldbe a numberof surprise performers this year. Look
for the team to improve on its finishes from last season.

Women's Basketball
Last year: 14-11 (9-4 in the Centennial Conference)
Outlook: Here is a team everyone should be excited about.
After surprising everyone last year, the Garnet is one of this
year's favorites in the Centennial Conference. Leading the way
will be HeatherKile 'O2 (19.0 ppg, 13.7 rpg, 52.4% field goal percentage), a hardworking forward who may justembody doubledouble; she may break every Garnetrecord before her career
is done. Playing alongside her to form the conference's best
low-post tandem will be center Sarah Tufano 'O3 (IL6 ppg, 6.0
rpg, 50.2% FG, 84.7% free throw). Both are consistent players
who crash the boards, pass the ball well and have a soft touch
around the hoop. How deep this team can go will depend on
how much their guards have improved from last season, es-

pecially in theirperimeter shooting.
Heather Marandola '01(8.6 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.8 assists per game)
is a seasoned veteran at point guard who rarely ever leaves
the floor. Katie Tarr 'O2 and Kristen English 'Ol are athletic
defenders who will probably round out the starting lineup.
The team should also have a deep bench and excellent chemistry, having played together a lot in the offseason.
How far can they go? If their jump shooting has improved,
they could win the conference despite fairly stiff competition.
Make sure you get down and see these girlsplay at least once.
They're fun to watch.

Last season: 3-3

Outlook: One of the best teams nobody knows exists on
women's badminton team ranks as one of the
favorites to take the PAIAW badminton conference. Head
coach Dan Sears is very enthusiastic about the prospects
for this team, and justifiably so.
Top players Siobhan Carty 'Ol, Jane Ng 'Ol and Karen
Lange 'O2 will lead a strong lineup augmented by four
new prospects. The doubles team consisting of Carty and
Lange was second in the region last season and were
invited to nationals. Both Carty/Lange and Ng won
matches in their respective divisions at nationals last
season.
campus, the

Women's Swimming
Last Season: 9-3, 5-2 in the Centennial Conference,
third in the regular season, second at championship

meet.
Outlook: The Garnet is among the top teams in the
conference and could unseat perennial powerhouse
Gettysburg from its throne at the end of the season. Yet
another team that is fairly light on numbers but high on
quality, this team will excel in championship format
meets. Don't be too shocked if this team finishes second
or third in the dual meet season but then cleans house
at the Centennial Conference Championships.
Last year, they did very much the same thing, finish-

ing third in duals but blowing past second-place Washington by almost 150 points at the championships and
throwing a bit of a scare into overwhelming favorite
Gettysburg.
The team is led by the returning conference swim-

mer of the year, the tireless Alice Bonarou 'O2. Her best
event is probably the 400IM medley, where she won the
conference last year, but she also contributes in a number of relays. Natalie Briones 'O3, Amy Auerbach 'O2
and Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol are also among the tops in
the league in their respective events. They also have a
strong supporting cast that allows the team to excel in

relays.

THE SWEET

Soccer's season ends with loss to Fords

Some completely
unrelated topics
When the NCAA adopted Bowl Championship
Series (BCS) Rankings a few years ago, I was under
the impression that the BCS system was supposed to
solve the arbitrary nature of rankings in college
football. However, the most recent BCS poll ranks
Florida State University (FSU) ahead of Miami, even
though both teams have just one loss and Miami
defeated FSU. (And you thought only George W. Bush
is capable of such ingenious logic.)
According to ESPN, the BCS system is an addition
of a “poll average...computer average...” blah, blah,
blah. The bottom line is this: the team of monkeys
trying to solve the problems of college football
replaced a bad ranking system with another one
which is just as bad. I wouldn’t be the first to suggest
that college football adopt a playoff I don’t see
March Madness doing too poorly. Of course, colleges
might lose money if they stopped playing in New
Year’s Day bowls. Why would they wantto take a hit
for the fans, though? Don’t ask me; just send the
Green Party in to clean things up. (I promise this is
the last time I’ll resort to a lame political analogy.)
Now I’d like to move on to a completely unrelated
topic. (Nothing too exciting is going on in sports, I’m
sorry to say, but making fun of Joe Smith is always

fair game for a sports column). The first-pick-of-thedraft bust/moron is certainly garnering a lot of
attention for being a 10-point-per-game (ppg), 6
rebound-per-game (rpg) guy who’s too lanky to play
power forward and too slow to be a small forward.
Sorry, New York: Smith can’t exactly solve your
rebounding problems. And to the Miami Heat: I don’t
see Smith filling Mourning’s shoes anytime soon; he
wouldn’t even be able to bang with Vitaly Potapenko.
The bottom line: if David Stern really wanted to
punish the Timberwolves for league contract

Vikings having finally lost a game, the excitement of
this football season has waned. No game this year
may be as bad as this weekend’s matchup of New

New England to be victorious, considering that they

Rugby loses to Delaware, shuts out Millersville
BY JOANNE JACOBSEN AND PAYAL SHAH
Last weekend marked another amazing victory for the
Swarthmore women's rugby team as it secured a much-coveted spot in the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union Champi-

onships.
Bright and early Saturday morning, the ruggers piled into
vans and headed to Princeton for their biggest tournament
yet: the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union Championships.
The team competed in Division I against powerhouses such
as University of Delaware, Princeton and Millersville.
The first day of competition pit the Swarthmore women
against the University of Delaware. Injuries and scheduling
conflicts rendered more thana fifth of the starting A-side team
unable to play, but the B-side players eagerly stepped up to fill
in, matching their level ofplay with that of the Delaware team.
Swarthmore played hard and rough, but the score of 15-3
did not reflect its efforts. The back line played as one, integrating forward-turned-back Phil Meehan 'Ol and B-side vet
Joanne Jacobson 'O3 into the line effortlessly. Although the
teams were evenly matched, the referee's controversial calls
caused the team to lose much ground. In true Swat style, the
team took one penalty called in its favor to score points on a
beautiful penalty kick by Nancy Craig 'OL
The forwards displayed team spirit and stamina on Saturday. Jumpers Maya Peterson 'O2 and Adrienne Fowler 'O3 consistently maintained possession of the ball, feeding it to the
back line quickly. During the second half, due to an injury to
another A-side starter, freshman rookie phenomenon Nicole
Brunda 'O4 subbed in and used her aggressive style to gain
valuable ground for Swat.
Although they pushed it out down to the final minutes of

the game, the team suffered a heartbreaking loss. But they
used Saturday's mistakes to return with a vengeance on
Sunday, resulting in a 19-0 shutout of D-I team Millersville.
Swat started out strong with winger Emily Wilkins 'Ol
scoring the first try with a forty-yard run into the try
zone. Wilkins was unstoppable as she booted the ball
across the field and then chased it with unbelievable speed
again and again. Other winger Katie Harper 'O2 and fly
half Cathy Vaughan 'Ol had well placed kicks, that she
strategically fed right to Millersville's butterfingered fullback. Swat's fullback, Rabi Whittaker 'O3, on the other
hand, had no problem fielding Millersville's kicks or handling several illegal high tackles from their frustrated fly
half.

Harper and Elizabeth Meehan 'Ol scored the other two
tries of the game, both of which resulted from the combined efforts of the forwards and the backs. The forwards
dominated therucks and mauls, delivering the ball quickly
and cleanly to the backs. Then they joined the back line to
overload Millersville and score two tries.
"It all came together on Sunday," said Vaughan. "The
backs and the forwards really played together." After the
second two tries, scrum half Craig added to the team's score
with her successful conversion kicks.
Although injured, players Fowler and Sarah Nusser 'O2
on Sunday. They played through
the pain and were instrumental to the team's victory.
Despite the odds, Swarthmore women's rugby had an
unforgettable weekend. They went to the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union Championships. They came back strong
on Sunday to massacre Millersville. And now they're getting ready blow Navy away in MARFUs next spring.
