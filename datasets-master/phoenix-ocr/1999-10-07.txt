Student Council Tuesday
night had very different proposals for renovating the
shabby student space in
Sharpies 111 and creating facilities for student organizations.
ThePhoto Club and Student
Art Association both suggested that the building near
Sharpies Dining Hall and
Olde Club be converted into a
student art gallery, complete
with darkroomand workshop
space.
But members of the College
Democrats and College Republicans, who rarely agree
on much else, stood together
this week to support a plan for
turning the old building into
a "political resource center."
Student Council, after hearing both proposals, decided to
postpone any decision until
several weeks after October

would have a chance to suggestions. After the final vote,

Student suspended for two years
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
After adjudication on Saturday, October 2, the
College Judiciary Committee (CJC) found Javier
Hidalgo 'O2 guilty of violence and assaultand sanctioned him with a two-year suspension to begin
immediately. The judicial hearing followed an incident between Hidalgo and his roommate, Yanni
Kisoki 'O2, which ended in Hidalgo's arrest and
Kisoki's hospitalization. Hidalgo, who had been
barred from campus from the time of the incident,
September 24, returned to the College for
Saturday's hearing.
The committee met in response to a report
against Hidalgo filed by Kisoki. This report consisted of two charges, which were considered separately by the CJC: 1) violence and assault and 2)

intimidation. Hidalgo was found guilty only of the
first. According to the public statement of the results of the hearing, Hidalgo was guilty of "striking [Kisoki] in the head with a five-pound weight."
Of the second charge, intimidation, the CJC determined Hidalgo not guilty. This charge was
based upon Kisoki's allegations that Hidalgo had
threatened him with further violence. Although
conceding that statements made during the incident were perceivable as threatening at the time,
the CJC found the charge unfounded. Based on
Kisoki's own testimony at the hearing, the committee concluded that he "does not fear and need
not fear for his physical safety."
The CJC based the severity of its sanction upon
the violent nature of the incident. Hidalgo's

Plenary marked by controversy
Alcohol policy changes, speakers committee, dissection policy
hot topics at Haverford's annual fall decision-making event
By Matt Shapr
Bi-Co News

HHUMriMnmbNMMMJR^

Amid the familiar jugglers, kazoos, floating
soap bubbles, flying frisbees and rolls of toilet
paper, Haverford's 1999 Fall Plenary included
a wide gamut of hotly-debated issues.
Quorum was reached by 7:50 p.m., and following an expert rendition of the national anthem by the Bi-College Loony Tunes, Fall Plenary '99 was underway.
Controversy sprang up before the planned
agenda could even get under way. After the
rules of order were approved by voice vote,
Students' Council Secretary Andrew Prazar
'OO read a statement concerning item five on
the agenda, a resolution entitled "Executive
Council Election Cycle" and authored by Scott
Bureau 'O2, Maura Purcell 'OO, Jessie
Ehrenfeld 'OO, and Judson Redmond 'Ol, that
would have changed the timing of the election of members of SC's executive council.
SC members had been in disagreement over
whether or not this was a legitimate issue for
discussion at Fall Plenary when the SC Constitution specifically states, "The Plenary session
of the fall semester will be limited to discussion on non-Honor Code and non-Constitutional
issues."
The Student Association, with Prazar acting
as chair because the resolution concerned
Chairs Ehrenfeld and Redmond, proceeded to
debate the issue. Three people spoke on the
"con" side, expressing the opinion that the issue should not be discussed at this plenary.
Said Ellie Brown 'OO, "The constitution is clear
that discussion [of constitutional issues] cannot
take place in the fall, and this is a constitutional
issue."
This issue was not freeof suspicions ofabuse
of power, echoing Fall Plenaries of years past.
Brown felt that Ehrenfeld and Redmond were
using their position as Co-Chairs to allow their
own resolution to be discussed against the prescriptions of the Constitution, while the same
rule might have kept many other resolutions
off the floor in the past.
Purcell vehemently challenged the idea that
abuse of power was an issue.
"Let's talk about the constitutional part of it,
not about power and privilege," he said.
The Student Association voted not to discuss
the resolution, after which it was announced
that after Plenary had closed, there would be
an optional discussion and vote on the issue. This
action was immediately opposed by Eric
McCafferty 'Ol, who contended that discussion
of the resolution among the assembled Plenary
and use of the Plenary ballots would still constitute discussion of a constitutionalissue at Fall
Plenary.
At the end of Plenary, the discussionand vote
did not take place. Ehrenfeldand Redmondlater
explained that they did not hold such discussion because they felt that the student body had
voted not to.
Next on the agenda was theresolution entitled
"Speakers CommitteeVersion 2.0," authored by
Ehrenfeld and Redmond. Redmond stated its
goal as "to reform speakers committee as we
know it today."
Said Ehrenfeld of their motivations, "We've
been unable to fill the slots on speakers committee, which has made it pretty hard for clubs
to get money." The solution, he felt, was to
"streamline the process."
Redmond stated that such a system was already in use by SC for the current semester,
because SC felt that it had to take some action

because clubs were finding it difficult to get
money because of the lack of student representatives on the committee. There was no procon debate, and the resolution passed with 427
in favor, 93 opposed, and 66 abstentions.
The next resolution to be presented was entitled "Student Choice Policy for Classroom
Animal Use." Both the original resolution and
the amendment which replaced it called for a
policy in the biology and psychology departments which universally provided other options
for those who were opposed to dissection and
animal experimentation.
The original resolution was authored by
Bernie Fischlowitz-Roberts 'OO, Erika StrausBowers 'Ol, Kate Conway 'O2, Chris Blount 'O2
and Christy Stockard 'O2. The entire text of the
resolution had already been replaced by a
friendly amendment, authored by Nathaniel
Rounds 'O2 and Peter Ingebretson 'Ol, which
had been posted on the comment board and
which changed the tone of the resolution so as
to make clearer that its intent was to foster dialogue between the student body and the faculty.
Said Conway, "I hoped that it would spark a
dialogue between faculty and concerned students about an issue that I thought needed to
be discussed."
However, the resolution was apparently
taken by the faculty of the psychology department to be a demandfor immediate change of
policy, and the department posted a letter on
the comment board stating that, if the resolution were passed, it would not adopt the policy.
Conway stressed that this represented a misinterpretation and miscommunication, when
the intent of the resolution was to allow a cooperative effort. Ingebretson opened his statement with the explanation that he does not hold
the moral beliefs expressed in the resolution,
but believes that such a belief should not limit
one's education.
He said that the resolution's intentions were
threefold: to open a panel that allowed dialogue
between students and faculty; to cause affected
departments to enumerate their policies on student choice; and to give students more freedom to make choices.
Pro-con debate was extensive and polarized.
Several students believed that such communication is necessary to ensure that students are
given choices as to what courses they can take
given their moral beliefs. Equally strong was
the suspicion that such a policy would stifle possibilities for a high-quality education in many
fields.
An unfriendly amendment introduced by
Jeremy Pober 'O3, which attempted to add
wording that stressed that the committee's decisions were not binding, failed to pass. In the
end, theresolution passed with 264 in favor, 200
against, and 40 abstentions.
Last, JSAAPP Co-Heads Brady McCartney
'O2 and Melissa Atwood 'Ol presented the alcohol policy. As expected, debate over its effectiveness was extensive.
Jared Tankel 'O2 expressed the belief that,
since the policy does not always achieve its
goals, it causes the Honor Code itself to be violated. Also expressed was the opinion that
policy itself cannot be found to be in error simply because it is violated; this is a problem in
the way people treat it and not in the policy
itself.
Said Atwood afterward, "It will only be effective if everybody makes a conscious effort."

New science facility to
be named for donor
By Sasha Rieders
Bi-Co News
On Friday, Oct. 1, Haverford
College announced further plans
for its Integrated Natural ScienceFacility in an unveiling ceremony that announced the name
for the proposed $5O million science complex.
College president Thomas
Tritton's major announcement at
the ceremony was that the formerly anonymous $l5 million
donors to the Integrated Natural
Science Facility were Haverford
parents Daniel and Marian
Koshland of Berkeley, Calif.
Both Koshlands had careers
as distinguished scientists.
Marian was an immunologist,
and Daniel was a biochemist
who served as the editor of the
journal Science. Both taught
and conducted scientific research at the University of
California at Berkeley.
At the ceremony, Tritton announced that as of this week,
the Koshland's $l5 million challenge had been met, as supporters of Haverford College had
raised an additional $l5 million.
However, fundraisers still need
to raise an additional $l5 to $2O
million to finance the project.
President Tritton announced
that, in honor of this donation,
the complex of buildings comprising the new science facility would be called the "Marian
Elliott Koshland Integrated
Natural Science Facility," in
honor of the distinguished career and memory of Marian
Koshland, who died in 1997.
The plaque dedicating the science center, which will be
placed on the completed complex, was also unveiled during
the ceremony.
During the unveiling ceremony, President Tritton also
spoke of Haverford's commitment to integration of the natural sciences and the research
opportunities that this would
present. The ceremony was followed by a reception and a symposium with Pulitzer Prize winning writer and evolutionary
biologist Edward O. Wilson, a
distinguished professor at
Harvard University. Additional
speakers at Friday's event included biology professor Judy
Owen and Catherine Koshland
'72, the daughter-in-law of Dan
and Marian Koshland.
Tritton announced the unveiling of the formerly anonymous
donor and the science project by
stating, "Great projects always
begin with a twinkle in the
eye....Big ideas also have big
costs and as the vision expanded,
the cost expanded likewise."
He said that the $l5 million
donation was the largest single
gift in Haverford's history. In
addition, the gift was the largest gift ever to any liberal arts
college from a parent.

HAVERFORD
Tritton said to Dan Koshland,
in attendance at Friday's ceremony, "Words cannot express
our appreciation, but the
proper words are, 'thank you,'
from all of us."
Haverford biology professor
Judy Owen, an immunologist
herself, spoke about the distinguished career of Marian
Koshland. Known as "Bunny,"
Marian Koshland was the parent of two Haverford students
and was a longtime member of
the Board of Managers of the
college.
A distinguished immunologist, Marian Koshland helped
develop a vaccine for Asiatic
cholera early in her career for
the troops in World War 11. In
addition, Owen spoke of her
important paper, which demonstrated the basis for antibody
diversity, explaining how variations in the amino acid composition of antibodies account for
their ability to recognize foreign pathogens.
In an interview with the BiCollege News, Daniel Koshland
spoke of his wife as a pioneer
woman in the sciences.
"She was a real pioneer in
terms of being a woman in science, but in also having a big
family. The idea [before] had
been that in order to be a
woman in science, you had to
be like a man," Koshland said.
Owen said that Marian
Koshland always had emphasized the importance of creativity in science, and the need
for creative strategies in scientific research. Likewise, Owen
said that Koshland had "envisioned for Haverford a cutting
edge, creative environment for
faculty and students alike."
Owen referred to Marian
Koshland's retrospective paper
published in the Journal of Immunology entitled, "Sheer luck
made me an Immunologist,"
and said that it was "luck for
immunology and for Haverford
that led her in our direction."
In addition to their donation,
President Tritton expressed excitement that the building received such generous funding
and would be named in the
honor of two extremely distinguished, prominent scientists.
Friday's events also focused
on Haverford's commitment to
integration of the sciences. The
ceremony was originally
planned as a groundbreaking
ceremony. However, this was
not possible since the college is
still awaiting official approval
from the township before the
old physical plant building can
be removed to make way for
the INSF construction. President Tritton expects that the
actual construction of the science facility will begin shortly
after this year's graduation.

Administration forms
committee to fund
large-budget events
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
In the wake of what Dean Bob
Gross termed the "George
Clinton fall-out," the administration is forming a new committee
to oversee such large-budget
events. The committee, only in
the planning stage at the present,
will have a budget in the ballpark
of $lO,OOO-$15,000 and is expected to go into operation next

semester.

The tentative plan for the committee calls for a fairly small
group composed of staff, faculty
members and students charged
with communicating student
opinion to the administration.
Davirah Timm-Dinkins, Coordinator of Student Activities,
would convene its meetings. She
would be joined by the Vice
President for College and Community Relations andExecutive
Assistant to the President,
Maurice Eldridge; the Treasurer
of Student Budget Committee,
Josh Bess 'OO for this academic
year; a faculty member; and student representatives from Student Affairs Committee, Student
Council, and the Forum for Free
Speech.
In procedure, the committee
will bear a resemblance to the
Cooper Committee; it will request proposals from students,
which the committee will then
evaluate. Bess outlinedthe functioning of the committee as such:
"Based on the Cooper committee
idea, this group of people will
discuss different proposals and
will fund whichever one(s) they
think are the most deserving of
a piece of a pot of money."
Gross, however, repeatedly
stressed the differences between the project of this new
committee and that of the Cooper Series. "[The committee] is
not duplicating the Cooper," he
said, emphasizing the new
committee's exclusive focus on

College

entertainment. He described its
mandate as more restricted, as
it will not be an avenue for the
funding of lectures and other
academic events. In addition,
proposals submittedto this committee will work within a shorter
time frame. The committee will
be calling for proposals for
events to occur next semester
sometime before winter break.
These events will, however, resemble the Cooper Series in that
they will be free to students.
A number of related events,
culminating in the George
Clinton fiasco of last semester,
spurred the formation of this
new committee. After extending
an invitation to Clinton to perform at Swarthmore, the students involved could not raise
the $30,000 fee he requested. No
channel dedicated to such
projects existed. This followed
on the tail of a talk that Hugh
Weber 'OO gave to the administration on the subject 'How
Come No One Anyone's Ever
Heard of Comes to Swarthmore?' Gross attributes the germination of the idea for the new
committee to such student initiative.
Gross hopes that the committee will bridge the generation
gap between the administration
and the students. He wants a forum for the voicing of student
opinion, as the administration
does not have insight into student interest when it comes to
entertainment. Gross admitted,
with some embarrassment, that
he hadn't known who George
Clinton was when students had
approached him about funding
for the concert. He then wryly
recalled a similar incident a few
years ago when he hadn't understood the uproar over the scheduling of a Dave Matthews concert on Rosh Hashanah. Confessing that he hadn't heard ofDave
Matthews either, Gross concluded, "I'm so out of it."

Yearbook still lacks editors,
BC has not budgeted it yet

The Halcyon office on Parrish sth is still trashed from producing last year's yearbook
From HALCYON, pg.

I

Bess said that once the funding and salary issues are resolved, Student Budget Committee will openup the editors'
positions for applications.
"They [the editors] will be
behind —some fall sports are
already winding down," Bess
said. "But The Halcyon's not
going to die. It's going to get
jump started this year."
In addition to producing
this year's yearbook, the editors will be responsible for
distributing last year's Hal-

cyon, which usually arrives in
November or December. Without editors, said Bess, The Halcyon will not be distributed.
Although plans are still in the
preliminary stages, Bess and the
class officers havebeen discussing some possible plans for funding The Halcyon. Options include eliminating the free yearbooks traditionally given to seniors in favor of subsidies, raising the price of the yearbook to
$7O-80 or seeking substantial
funds from the college administration.
The cost of producing The

Halcyon has run around
$35,000 in the past, according
to Bess.
Although the senior class
officers are primarily concerned with getting this
year's Halcyon off the
ground, Bess said this year's
arrangement will also atto remedy the
tempt
yearbook's long-term problems, which include a perenniallack of interest in joining
the staff.
"Whatever we do will become a model for future
Halcyon's," said Bess.

Justice Committee finds Hidalgo guilty, suspends him

From SUSPENSION, pg. I

suspension, effective upon announcement, lasts
until the beginning of fall semester 2001. It prohibits him from being on campus or other college
property at any time prior to the aforementioned
date, even over the summer or other vacation
periods. A single violation of this suspension is
"grounds for immediate and permanent expulsion."
The sanction has an additional permanent aspect. As a notational sanction, it will be entered
on Hidalgo's record card, obligating a college official to disclose this incident if asked about misconduct. Hidalgo's transcript, however, will contain no mention of his suspension.
The Committee involved in Hidalgo's hearing,
convened by Dean Bob Gross, comprised Assistant Professor of Psychology Frank Durgin, Assistant Professor of Biology Sara Hiebert, Director of Facilities Management Stuart Hain, Associate Dean Joy Charlton, and Jason Caldwell 'Ol.
Although College Justice Committees typically
call for two students, only one was available; following procedure, Charlton, a member of the
Dean's staff, filled the vacant spot. Associate
Dean Tedd Goundie served as Observer to the
hearing and composed the public statement of the
results.
Although the College judicial procedure is complete for Hidalgo, he still must undergo criminal
prosecution by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. According to Brian Craig, Swarthmore's Chief
of Police, Hidalgo's trial will be held on October
18 at the Media District Courthouse.

Responsible journalism
In light of the response to the article "Sophomore arrested on assault
charges" (Oct. 1, News), we find it necessary to clarify The Phoenix's policy
regarding crime reporting and the right to privacy.
It is our duty to inform the public of criminal incidents to the fullest
extent of the law and of our reporting. We publish only facts confirmed by
reliable sources—we intend not to spread but to dispel rumors.
In doing so, we fulfill the raison d'etre of The Phoenix: to provide Swarthmore with trustworthy, complete information concerning campus events.
Occasionally this necessitates reporting information some people would
rather see kept under wraps.
Publishing names and details is not an invasion of privacy in most cases.
"Covering Campus Crime," a handbook for student journalists published by
the Student Press Law Center, states, "Material that can be obtained
lawfully from public records will rarely be considered private. Generally
speaking, if something would be considered 'newsworthy,' it would not be
considered 'private.' In almost all cases when the police arrest or criminally
charge someone with a crime, or someone accuses another of criminal
behavior, that information will be considered newsworthy, no matter how
embarrassing it might be."
There are exceptions to this, of course, including sensitive or intimate
details about a person's medical conditions, sex life or personal finances.
Almost all students here are adults, so withholding names because a person
is underage is generally not a concern. We make every attempt to contact
the concerned party or parties (in this particular case, we received no
response from the victim), but ultimately, the discretion is ours.
The details obtained in the article were culled from public police records
(open in compliance with 24 Pennsylvania State Annotated Code section
2502-3) and interviews with Swarthmore Police ChiefBrian Craig and
Associate Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie. Any individual could have
visited the police station or the dean's office and received the same information we printed.
Swarthmore is a small community, and the concern expressed over the
possible invasion of privacy is understandable. However, withholding
public information is not only irresponsible journalism but also shows
disrespect for the intelligence of our readership. Although past Phoenix
staffs may have felt otherwise, we believe firmly in the fundamental
journalistic ideal of revealing the truth in full.

A sound proposal
Thirty thousand dollars is a lot of money, so much so that the second

sentence of the expensive proposal now before Student Budget Committee

reads, "Please regain your composure."
But when it's not compared to a slice of pizza or a game of pinball, $30,000
isn't much. A little more than that amount, $31,690, will buy you two semesters of education at Swarthmore College. Printing the paper you're reading
right now requires over $20,000 each year, and it takes the Social Affairs
Committee tens of thousands of dollars to fund a year's worth of all-campus
parties. Using this year's figures, one person's room and board for eight
semesters here come to $30,000 exactly.
And the costs of tangible things like food and housing
which you'd never
realize were so expensive until you actually do the addition pale in comparison to the college's upcoming $60.5 million renovation of DuPont. Against
that figure, $30,000 weighs in at a measly 0.05 percent. We leave unstated the
fraction of Swarthmore's endowment, now spiraling toward $1 billion.
So although the estimate of costs to repair the audio system used for
student events seems high at first, we think on balance it is a sound proposal.
After theft and damage, our campus sound system needs continual jerryrigging to perform to even our most minimal expectations. It takes the
experience, generosity and personal equipment of a college staff member to
satisfy routine sound demands. The situation has grown critical precisely
because for years no one has taken action. Now is the time.
The capital expenditure of $30,000 is music to no one's ears, but compared
to the costs of other parts of the Swarthmore experience it seems reasonable.
If the college plans to spend $60.5 million on a necessary upgrade for the
weekdays of natural science majors, what seems so expensive about students
spending less than one-two-thousandthof that upgrading our weekends? We
urge Student Budget Committee to approve the sound system plan.
The reverberations of that decision are, of course, the costs. Maintaining
the current high and growing level of student spending may require another
increase in the student activities fee. But the college is building a new
DuPont, committing itself to a capital campaign to reach that goal. If it takes
large amounts of money to build DuPonts and maintain Swarthmore's
academics, so be it. And if it takes commitment to expensive audio upgrades
to maintain Swarthmore's fun, we like the sound of that.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Publication of names unethical
To the Editor:
I am writing this to express concern over
a major detail mentioned in the story "Sophomore arrested on assault charges" (Oct. 1,
News). First and foremost, Hidalgo and
Kisoki deserved a right to anonymity by journalistic standards, although it must be made
clear that I in no way condone Mr. Hidalgo's
behavior. I have worked in journalism in and
out of Swarthmore long enough to know that
the mention of the names of two underage
students in this article was unethical and
makes the writer as well as her editors an
object of scrutiny for doing so. The appearance of their names removes all objectivity
from the article, especially when one notices
that the only person interviewedis the Chief
of Swarthmore Police and no other perspective speaking on the behalf of either Mr.
Hidalgo or Mr. Kisoki is presented. Since my
freshman year here I have read stories de-

tailing various student-perpetrated assaults,
drunken misdemeanors and otheranti-social
behavior but never knew the names of either
assailant or victim. In every single one of
those cases, the perpetrators and victims
managed to remain nameless in the stories
written about them in The Phoenix, so why
should Mr. Hidalgo's and Mr. Kisoki's case
be any different? It seems so irrelevant and
only serves to make Hidalgo look bad and
Kisoki completely victimized. Swarthmore is
a small campus; if people did not know from
gossip, they would have eventually found out
who was involved in this case withoutthe help
of The Phoenix. The mention of their names
was simply not relevant to the story, and I
believe these young men both deserve a written apology, as their reputations at the college have been tainted by the poor judgment
demonstrated in the running of this article.

Article exhibits disregard for privacy
To the Editor:
As a Swarthmore student, I was deeply
concerned by the article published by The
Phoenix entitled "Sophomore arrested on
assault charges" (Oct. 1, News). Besides the
event described in the article, what really
distressed me was the blatant disregard for
privacy demonstrated by this article. The
campus community does have a right to
know the happenings around campus, but
not at the expense of individuals being

pointed at and rumored about. By printing
the names of the individuals involved in the
event discussed in the above mentioned article, The Phoenix demonstrated both a lack
of judgment and naivete about the consequences of executing such an action. The
individuals mentioned in the article have a
right to move on with their lives. Printing
their names in the paper does not make this
process any easier.

Controversy for sale at Brooklyn museum
By Andy Karr
For The Phoenix

NATIONAL

Quick, take cover! A new skirmish has
broken out in the CultureWars. This time,
the battleground is Brooklyn. Mayor
Giuliani has launched an all-out attack on
the Brooklyn Museum of Art's latest exhibition, "Sensation: Young British Artists
from the Saatchi Collection," a political
move calculated to win approval with religious voters in the upcoming New York
Senate race.
Clearly, Giuliani has violated the First
Amendment in the many ways he has attempted to stop the show. First, he didn't
want the city's taxpayers to fund potentially offensive art, so he cut off city funds
to the museum, even though 60 percent
ofNew Yorkers think the museum should
be allowed to go on with the show. Next,
he tried to take over the museum through
loopholes in the lease agreement, and
threatened to fire the museum's board of
directors ifthey went on with the exhibition. When the museum changed its policy
to accommodate the lease, and promised
to continue without city money, but not
without a legal battle, what was left for
Giuliani to do? Send the offenders to the
Gulag?
No, he (or, more likely, someone on his
staff) actually did some research into the
exhibition. Giuliani judged that the show
was full of "sick stuff and should be shut
down after just seeing its catalog. Who
knew the good mayor was so well-versed
in art that he could judge an exhibition
just by reading the names and descriptions of the works, and seeing tiny photographs? After a week of flailing blindly
at the museum, someone at the mayor's
office discovered that the show was also
controversial within the art world and
made the facts of that dispute part of
Giuliani administration's case against the
museum.
The really interesting questions regarding the Brooklyn exhibition have to

do not with censorship and standards of
decency, but with commercialism and the
arts in public museums. The title of the
exhibition refers to the only common
theme among the works in the show: that
Charles Saatchi owns them. Although
museums commonly display private collections, most public museums try not to
display works that are known to be for
sale, as Saatchi's collection is believed to
be.
Saatchi, a London advertising executive, is known for using his advertising
savvy to increase the resale value of the
art he collects. A widespread rumor has
it that Christie's, a prominent London auction house as well as the main sponsor of
"Sensation," will auction off much of

use financial leverage and influence to
decide what is popular.
At some point, the state may decide that
viewing art is worth something more to
the people as a whole than what people
are willing to pay individually. That's
when the government uses tax money to
make expensive art accessible to the public for the low cost of admission to a museum. People go to the museum to see
the art they like, and museums with high
attendance are successful. In this way, the
people decide which art they want to be
publicly funded, just as they decide with
their own dollars in the free market. (Attendance at the Brooklyn Museum of Art
is at a record high after the opening of
"Sensation.")

Swat needs late-night delivery joint
By Daniel Jacobs
For The Phoenix

SWARTHMORE

Its 1:05 a.m., you've got work piled
higher than your head on the desk.
You've been hard at work since your unsubstantial fifteen-minute nomadic meandering though Sharpies, the land of
eyer-unspectacular food. You now realize that a spelunking in Sharpies seven
hours ago just isn't going to hold you over
therest of the night. Two hours ago, your
stomach was grumbling containably like
a hibernating bear, but now it is roaring
like a sex-starved lion. You consider your
options.
I note benignly, yet secretly filled with
much spite, that some of us have the ultimate option. These lucky few have those
parents who haven't quite gotten over
their separation anxiety and are constantly sending scrumptious care packages. If you are one of the lucky ones,
please, please share, and if not... this article might just pertain to you.
Our late night options to quiet the roar
of the lion within us are very small indeed. We've got vending machines in
some dorms, but many times chips or
cookies just won't hit the spot. If we are
going to perform up to the stringent Swarthmore standards of education, we need

Voters too frequently confuse their political party with the one true form of
American government. Parties are not
magical organisms. Neither one has all
the right answers to society's problems
and if voters insist on considering their
party the only source of answers they will
miss out on half a world of opportunity.
Political parties are not mystical organizations thatdeserve unquestioning obedience. Maintaining a party affiliation
because of one's parents, or because everyone else belongs to the party, or (even
worse) because no one else does, degrades the political process into a popular association. Political participation is
about supporting a set of beliefs. As it is
too complicated to vote for beliefs by
themselves, it is convenient to vote for
individuals who represent those beliefs,
and more convenient to support groups
that support those individuals. However,
when political groups are supported for
reasons other than promoting the ideals
they represent, the political process loses
all meaning as a democratic institution.
Supporting a particular political party

Rolls, you're not going to fill it with the

cheap stuff. Oh no. You might glance at
the 87-octane pump before picking up the
premium to feed to your engine, but
glance is about all you'll do.
Swarthmore students, like Rolls
Royces, also need the premium stuff.
Vending machines just aren't enough to
keep our engines moving smoothly as the
sun starts to peek out over the horizon.
We need the premium stuff all night long.
I make a direct appeal to the college:
HELP US HELP YOU, by filling us with
premium 91-octane food. We need a 24hour grease joint on campus that can cater to us in times of need so that we can
perform for you.
How tough can it possibly be to make
this work? What kind of resources do we
need to set this plan into action? My argument is that we have all the resources
we need right now, and making this work
is just a matter ofprocess and implementation of a plan so simple that one might
wonder why it wasn't implemented years
ago.
It's time to eliminate the two years the
college isbound to spend "developing" the
plan and set this process in motion. Paces
is already open until midnight Sunday
through Thursday. It probably closes then
because the college knows that after
about 12:30 on weekday nights, people
aren't going to have the time or incentive
to walk up to Paces for a chat over coffee, bread and cheese. Instead of 12:30
being the time when Paces nods off and
goes to sleep, we need to recognize that
all the business approach has to do after
that is change a little.

night time slot, and revolutionize its dimensions by metamorphosing into a latenight delivery 91-octane foodpump. This
joint does well as a cool cat coffee bar up
until closing time at 12:30, and I hypothesize that it will do just as well once it
starts to deliver the stuff that keeps us
running into the wee morning hours.
To make this work, the business needs
a late-night cook, two late-night employees to switch off taking and making deliveries and maybe a golf cart or two if
these two employees are really lazy. The
money that would eitherbe gained or lost
is a secondary issue; the primary issue
is that the school would be allowing its
students to fill themselves with the premium food that they need and deserve,
keeping their engines roaring late into
the night.
Swarthmore students need the high
quality 91-octane premium stuff late at
night, and we can't continue to ignore our
needs forever. We've got the plan, now it's
all about convincing whomever we need
to convince in the school to implement it.
This is where I appeal to my fellow
Swarthmoreans for help. Let's start the
pendulum moving and see if we can persuade this school to respond to our not
entirely dire, but still mightily important
needs.

Political party poopers
Voting your conscience never wrong
intelligently is a difficult task. The parties are composed ofindividual members
who have widely different beliefs. Supporting a particular party is only a way
of supporting a group of individuals that
has a better chance of representing your
beliefs than another group ofindividuals.
Just because a local party affiliate supports a voter's positions does not mean
that the party as a whole necessarily represents that voter's beliefs.
Needless to say, the inverse argument
applies as well. A voter may support a
political party, but if a local election involves a member of her party that holds
widely different beliefs than the party
norm running against a more agreeable
member of another party, that voter
would be both foolish and irresponsible
to vote based purely on party preference.
The voter is foolish for voting someone
into office with whom they do not agree,
and irresponsible because she is supporting the transition of her party in the direction of the candidate she supported.
To make the process even more difficult, the beliefs of a party change from
time to time, as they must if they are to
actually represent people. Just because
a party is changing its beliefs, however,
does not mean that a voter must change
her beliefs to go along with the party. A
truly involved voter should reexamine

A truly involved voter should

her party affiliation every few years to
make sure that the views of her party
have not strayed too far from her personalbeliefs. If aparty has deviatedfrom
a voter's beliefs, the voter has two
choices: try to convince her party that it
is headed in the wrong direction, and must
reform itself; or switch party affiliation.
That's right, just change. Party names are
meaningless; a person's political party is
the one that most accurately represents
his or her views, and it is quite possible
that the views of aparty can change over
a person's lifetime.
Yes, parties are an important method
of political contribution, but on their own
they are worthless. Emphasis on the role
of parties can hide thereal issues behind
an election. If people want to make political progress rather than argue for the
sake of arguing, it is essential to keep the
issues rather than the parties in mind.

Supreme Court kicks off influential year this week
By the Daily Nebraskan
U. of Nebraska
Nine of the most powerful
people in this country convened last Monday morning to adjudicate the law. In what
is expected to be an influential year, the
U.S. Supreme Court faces many controversial issues, such as tobacco regulation,
abortion protests and religion in schools.
Many sweeping changes to our social
landscape have been handed down by the
Supreme Court. They are in position to do
it again.
Those nine justices serve for life, handing down their own words as the supreme
law of the land.
This year, the court will decide whether

regulate tobacco. Joe Camel could soon

have a nutritionfacts label tattooed on his
hide.
The court will also examine the separation of church and school with a half dozen
different cases.
Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
the court will again rule on the division of
power between state and federal governments. Rehnquist has worked to give more
power to the states using the principles of
federalism.
There is little that can be done once the
court has ruled. Even presidents have
bowed before the whims of this bunch.
Now that's power.
The next president is expected to ap-

point as many as three justices to the court,
which could skew its ideological balance.
Conservatives lead the current panel,
but the most contentious issues slide by
on only a 5-4 vote. The balance of power
could shift either way in the next few
years.
Both justices John Paul Stevens, a liberal, and Rehnquist, a conservative, have
said they might not resign until a president with their beliefs takes office.
A change in the court could clear the
way for more sweeping rulings in controversial issues such as abortion, the separation of church and state and police
searches and seizures.
When choosing a president next year,
remember the legacy that could be left behind.

he was here for
an alumni event. The silver-haired gentleman was talking to his wife, a fellowSwat
graduate, who was equally disgruntled
that there is no inn yet located conveniently on campus. The couple talked
about how the construction of an inn has
been an ongoing, if sometimes untouched,
project for years. What they could not understand was why it has never materialized, and I began to wonder: if ever I return to Swarthmore for an alumni event,
will I be asking that same question?
There is certainly enough demand to
warrant an inn on campus, and with such
demand I am surprised that an inn was
not built decades ago. Hordes of people
visit Swarthmore each year—parents accompanying their children to campus in
the beginning of the year, returning to
fetch them at the end, or visiting the college during the academic year for parents' weekend, athletic games, concerts,
and other performances or events. Every
year there are alumni events on campus.
Guest lecturers, Cooper performers, the
Board of Managers, and other guests of
the college visit Swarthmore each year.
Prospective students and their parents
would no doubt appreciate an inn located
on campus—it would eliminate the hassle
of trying to find a nearby hotel and the
subsequent vexation of trying to find the
college when they are in a mad dash to
get a son or daughter to the admissions
office in time for a scheduled interview.
I'd vouchsafe a guess that with some
long-term planning, Swarthmore could
afford to construct a campus inn. The
college is in good financial health—the
1997-98 treasurer's report stated that in
that academic year the endowment grew
to $833.7 million. The Swarthmore web
site currently states that its endowment
is over $9OO million. We do not attend a
school with an anemic endowment; I'd
venture to say that Swarthmore is glowing with financial health, even robust.
How is it that a school with such financial stability does not have a campus inn?
The campus inn need not be some sixstory monstrosity. Swarthmore boasts
that its campus features over 330 acres
of land; surely there is a plot of land, if
not some buildings, on the fringes of campus that could be converted into a 30-room
inn. A campus inn on the edge of campus
would enjoy the commerce that is now
being lost to various hotels, motels, and
bedbreakfasts that are in Philadelphia or
are scattered around the area.
The project to construct a campus inn
has been in the works for a while, but
unfortunately the projects seems to be
slow in coming to fruition. Construction
being delayed is nothing new, particularly
at Swarthmore. The recent construction
snafus (Mullan Tennis Center will be at
the earliest 18 months behind schedule,
and the American with Disabilities Actrelated construction is still going on, over
four weeks behind schedule) lead me to
believe that we cannot expect the college
to complete construction on schedule. The
delay in the construction of an inn should
probably be expected, but the greater
shame would be if this project were to
never be completed.

bound to make some group un-

happy.
SC Outreach Chair Rodney
Morris 'Ol believes that Sharpies
111 should be renovated, but said
it must not become the new property of only a fraction of the student body. "My personal feeling
is that it needs to stay an all-student space," Morris said. "I'm
not big into limiting it to five or
10 or 12j3tudent groups."

Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2, SC
representative to the Council on
Educational Policy, said she believedStudent Council should not
make a decision about the space
itself but rather present it to the
student body as a referendum.
For whatever proposal is cho-

"My personal feeling is
that it needs to stay an
all-student space. I'm not
big into limiting it to five
or 10 or 12 student

Rodney Morris
sen, Whitfield-Smith said, "I just
want to have a feeling that
there's a student mandate behind

it."
Backers of the political resource center and the student art
space present at the council

meeting Tuesday all supported
the idea of a referendum.
In other business Tuesday
night, council approved the new
Social Affairs Committee guidelines, which specify in writing
new criteria for the allocation of
money to student-sponsored parties.
Council also voted to allow
Morris to write a letter to Public
Safety expressing dismay at the
recent rash of "bootings" of student cars parked on campus
without a permit.
Co-chair Matt Schwartz 'Ol reported that the two pinball machines installed so far in Tarble
Social Center had raised $9O in
quarters in about a week.
Schwartz had been the major
backer of buying the four machines, which cost a total of
$6,000.
Council is also planning a fireside chat with Schall for Thursday, October 20 at 8 p.m. in
Kohlberg Coffee Bar. Potential
discussion topics will include
student space and the Borough
of Swarthmore's plans for revitalization.

Last weekend (Oct. 1 and 2) a
debate tournament for novices
took place on Swarthmore College grounds. This was the second annual tournament for novices in the field of parliamentary
debate, a tradition set up by last
year's Peaslee Debate Society
President, Damon Taaffe '99.
This year, sixty students from
Yale, Princeton, the University
of Virginia, Lehigh, Bryn Mawr,
Fairfield, Franklinand Marshall,
Haverf ord, and the University of
Maryland at College Park joined
their Swarthmore colleagues to
continue this tradition. "There is
a similar competition held each
year at Columbia University, but
many schools now prefer to attend the tournament that Swarthmore College organizes," explained Darius Ornstein 'OO, current president of the Debate Society.
The theme of the competition
was "third world dictators" and
each team debated under the
name of a different dictator.
Some interesting debates took
place between Yeltsin and
Hussein and between The Shah
and Pinochet. Moreover, each
round of the competition had a
resolution
a quote by a dictator. The teams had to connect
their cases to this resolution.

Swarthmore participated with
six teams, the same number as
Princeton. Yale participated with
four teams. Three rounds of the
competition took place on Friday
and were followed by a party for
all the participants in Paces. The
last two rounds were held on Saturday morning and were followed by the finals. The competition was won by one of the Yale
teams.

Two Swarthmore teams made
it to the quarterfinals. Xiao
Chang 'O3 and Sarah Drescher
'O3 took fifth place as a team and
Rob Peterson 'O3 and Jeremy
Schifeling 'O3 won eighth. All six
Swarthmore teams finished in
the top two-thirds and three
teams made the top ten.
Swarthmore debaters were
successful on the individual level
as well. Drescher became the top
speaker of the competition, and
Chang and Peterson took fourth
and fifth places respectively.
For Xiao, the tournament was
a success. "The great thing about
the weekend was thatI had genuine fun through this intense intellectual pursuit, a kind of a personal rarity on this extraordinary campus of ours," he said.
The Debate Society is starting
to attend competitions at other
schools on the East Coast and
with such successful novices it
will surely strike a great season
again.

martin warner: trucker, registrar, great american
martin earner: a man for all seasons
martin warner: a look at the guy who keeps
track of your grades
By Min Lee
Phoenix Staff
As a teenager at Newton High School, in Newton, Massachusetts, College Registrar Martin Warner was not unlike
your typical Swarthmore-bound student. He was juggling
multiple AP courses. Since age 8, he had wanted to become

a doctor.Before heading out west to Oberlin College, Warner
already was a pre-med at heart.
But after spending a semester at Oberlin, Warner had a
major revelation. Medicine, he decided, was not his calling
after all. For Warner, an aspiring doctor most of his conscious life, the revelation posed an identity crisis of sorts.
And College life proved not to be what it was made out to
be. "The excitement of Camp Oberlin—school, [living in]
dorms, partying—just didn't grab me," he says.
Warner was also being financially supported by a close
family friend, a doctor, who agreed to pay for his education
with the understanding that he would eventually become a
doctor as well. But now that he had chosen to abandon the
pre-medical route, all bets were off, Warner felt. "When I
didn't want to become a doctor," Warner recalls, "I couldn't
take his money."
So in 1974, at age 18, Warner followed in the footsteps of
Bill Gates, Michael Dell and Steve Jobs—he dropped out of

college.
But unlike Gates, Dell or Jobs, Warner harbored no aspirations to conquer the world. He became a hippie, complete
with "gorgeous, long strawberry hair," according to Paula
Dale, the College's space coordinatorand Warner's current
wife. He married his high school sweetheart, and the two
settled down in a 9' x 15' cabin in the woods of Northern
Wisconsin. The nearest town was eleven miles away. Warner
built an outhouse from scratch. There was no electricity,
no telephone, no running tap water. Over time, he and his
wife developed the ability to bathe and wash their hair with
exactly 5 gallons of water, which they pumped from a well.
During the winter, when staying in Wisconsin was like "flirting with death," as Warner put it, they spent their time in a
commune in Massachusetts.
The road to hippiedom
The journey from precocious student to hippie to registrar was indeed convoluted and unconventional.But a threehour interview at his house reveals that the ultimate outcome of this colorful journey is a registrar who, despite the
requirements of his job, doesn't really give a damn about
grades. (Students' grades don't even register in his shortterm memory, Warner says.) Swarthmore's registrar is one
who realizes that the ivory tower is not the only tower in
life, and who, barring a few caveats, would give an unequivocal thumbs-up to any Swarthmore student who wants to drop
out ("Be cautious," he warns, but "it wouldbe great").
Warner's mother, a single mother and elementary school
teacher, very early on encouraged Warner and his two older
siblings to be creative and follow their dreams. For her,
Warner's life choices later on did not come as a total surprise. While she had expectations for her children, she allowed them to accomplish their goals "in their own time,"
says Warner—which they did, with flying colors. (Both of
his siblings dropped out of high school but both now hold
advanced degrees.)
Mrs. Warner was a civil rights worker, as were many of
the family's friends, and Warner's upbringing took place in
a politically and socially liberal environmentwhich undoubtedly sowed the seeds for his counter-cultural tendencies.
As he was growing up, the Vietnam War lurked constantly
in the background—a war that he opposed, but as a young,
healthy male, was intimately intertwined with. Warner
would see cousin after cousin get drafted and come home
injured, or not come home at all. Up until 1973, when the
draft finally ended, he spent every moment awake worrying about the prospect of getting drafted. "It was like living
under a cloud," he recalled.
This underlying resentment for the political status quo,
coupled with his own personal crisis at Oberlin, provoked
him to pursue the counter-cultural dream of the 70s. Above
all, he and his contemporaries wanted to get away from the
capitalist rat race. "If you could find the right farm in the
woods," Warner recounts, "you could make a living and not
get caught up in the money-making culture we found so
abhorrent."
Thus, at age 19, Warner found himself married, and living frugally in the middle of nowhere, but, he still believes,
having the time of his life.
He would work "occasionally," Warner says, speaking
over the blaring music of Will Smith and Backstreet Boys,
as his son Teddy and his wife picked selections for a musical event at an upcoming church retreat. He would work
until he had earned around a couple of hundred dollars, and
then live off of it.

During his short stint as a hippie, Warner's blue-collar
jobs included working as a factory worker, a short-order
cook, and a laborer assembling trusses for pre-fabricated
houses.
Warner's cabin was intentionally far from even the nearest dirtroad. He and his wife were cut off from the rest of
the world, except for occasionalvisits to neighboring families who lived in regular homes, where they listened to the
radio or watched the latest sitcoms. The visits were a source
of amusement for the hosts, who often gawked at Warner
and his wife as if they were Hippie Culture Exhibit A.
The commune in Massachusetts where the couple spent
their winters was an idealistic community. "It was a dream,
an image, a myth," Warner recalled of his time in the commune, "[that] we were going to create a harmonious society in our tiny communal living situation."
The time wasn't entirely a bed of roses. "Living together
as if you were a family when you're not a family is tough,"
Warner quips. But apart from the usual problems associated with young people living in a cooperative situation,
Warner and his wife felt they were in heaven.
In those days, they made several cross-country trips, once
to drive Warner's grandmother's trailer to California, with
no valid car insurance (or health insurance, for that matter). Others thought they were crazy, but "we didn't care,"
Warner remembers. "We just went."
Shattering the myth
Warner's penchant for carefree living gradually but
steadily became compromised by more practical considerations. The bi-annual move to and from Massachusetts and
Wisconsin proved to be too inconvenient, and the winters in
Massachusetts were simply too harsh. Little by little, Warner
and his wife found themselves gravitating back towards
the society that they had left behind. First, they moved to
the mountains of North Carolina. And they eventually
worked their way to Ashville, North Carolina, which was
not quite the natural Utopia Warner had envisioned. In
Ashville they lived in a low-income apartment complex, a
further step away from their dream community. A depressed job market forced another move to Durham, North
Carolina, the site of Duke University. The home of theBlue
Devils was not exactly hippie central, either.
As Warner traces his journey away from his hippie roots
today, he is plainly aware of the hypocrisies that began to
generate over time. "[The rental apartment in Ashville] was
not a lot of the things we hoped for," he recalls, "andDurham
wasn't really 'back to nature' either, but we had better employment opportunities."
While visiting with the more modern families in his
"neighborhood," they realized, Warner remembers, that the
trappings of a material culture were not that unattractive
after all.
Soon enough he began to hold a regular job, with the
American Red Cross Blood Services in Durham. "That's
when I first connected to the idea of going to work every
day and earning a paycheck," Warner recalled.
By 1979, Warner was divorced from his first wife, and
while disillusioned, was still desperately clinging onto the
ideals that prompted his journey in the first place. After
quitting his job at the Red Cross and getting rid of all his
identification (his draft card, of course, had long ago been
burnt), he embarked on a trek on the Appalachian trail, to
try to rediscover himself. "I was still trying to achieve the
'back to nature' ideal," he recalls, "trying to live a simple
life."
But instead of recapitulating his life goals, Warner
reached a suddenrevelation one night that told him to give
up the battle. "I had this visionary understanding of myself," Warner recalls, "that I should join up, I should stop
trying to fight being a regular citizen."
And he promptly did exactly just that. As Warner himself had predicted, "it wasn't hard to get back." He returned
to the Red Cross, where he met his current wife, Paula Dale,
who was then a graduate student at UNC-Chapel Hill. He
credits her with having a "stabilizing and collegiate influence" on him. For Warner, their relationship was love at
first sight; he asked Dale to marry him after their first date.
And although she declined, they were married within a year.
Almost before he knew it, Warner was married, had a son,
and was back in school at UNC himself. By the time he got
his college degree, he was just like any other career climber.
"I wanted a job that required a college degree," Warner
remembers ofhis aspirations after graduation. "I was proud
of my degree and I wanted to use it."
Soon after, he landed a job as a cataloguer at the Duke
University library and quickly moved up the ladder there.
But the poor pay (he had earned more driving a truck for
the Red Cross) led him to seek work elsewhere. His opportunity came in the form of a job opening for Assistant Registrar at Duke. Arguing that his "behind-the-scenes," tech-

nical experience at the library had equipped him for his
new line of work, Warner successfully landed the job.
As a full-time employee at Duke, Warner was entitled to
almost-free tuition. Looking to further advance himself,
Warner earned a Master's in Liberal Studies at night while
working as Assistant Registrar during the day.
"Six months before I graduated," Warner recalls, "I knew
I would be marketable nationally." He proceeded to enter
several national searches for registrars, including
Swarthmore's. "I wanted to get into the best schools I could
get into," he said, sounding oddly like an ambitious high
school senior, "and that typically included the best paycheck."
Now and then
Twenty years after making that fateful decision to leave
Oberlin, Warner has come full-circle—he is registrar at "one
of the best schools in the world," happily married to "the
wife of my life," and blessed with a brainy kid who already
knows the differencebetween .jpg and .gif.
But his tumultous road to the normalcy he takes for
granted today has given him a nuanced view of life. Despite his return to American upper-middle class suburbia,
he is not your generic career-obsessed professional.
Even though he has "no regrets" about his decision to quit
Oberlin and the ensuing journey, he has no illusions about
his current line of work either. "No one [says], 'I want to be
a registrar when I grow up,'" Warner says, "unless they're
crazy. ...In many ways it's unattractive work, unfortunately."
He realizes that he is not exactly living out his most cherished boyhood dreams. "In a way, a reason why I'm a registrar is because I haven't got a vision of myself being a doctor [or] lawyer or doing some piece of work that is a dream
I could pursue," he says. "So, in a way, the absence of such
a vision means I'm more a generalist and opportunist."
Yet Warner is perfectly content with the direction his life
has taken. "[Living out your dreams] may be a myth, too,"
Warner philosophizes, "like the 'back to nature' myth for
me.... That may not be the way life works for most people."
"I think it's fine to just be an intelligent opportunist and I
don't mean that in a class way," he continues. "You explore
windows of opportunities open to you and you pick from
among your best choices and you go down that path and
that ends up defining you."
"I've been a registrar for ten years, so I'm pretty much
defined that way," he says. "Why switch? I do this well and
there's nothing wrong with it; there's nothing offensive [to
my soul] really."
And while he has ended his rebellion against the establishment, Warner has more than a few ideas about how the
status quo can be improved. Back in his younger days, he
thought that "the whole educationsystem was complicit with
the military-industrial complex." Today, while he thinks it
is still complicit, "it is also the salvation."
But hebelieves that a two-year break between high school
and college should be institutionalized.Under this plan, students would work for several years before starting college
at twenty.
According to Warner, "there's nothing like working, earning your own paycheck and actually having to pay your own
bill."
Such a program "would teach you the value of how to
organize your time and appreciate when to play and when
to work and what the point of work is," he says. The final
result would be an enhanced academic experience. "When
all you're thinking about is how to get laid," he opined, "that's
really hard to tie in the with the political theory you could
otherwise get excited about."
Part of the experience is also growing by "suffering a
little bit," living through "the slings and arrows of a bluecollar job." And as Warner learned the hard way, it's useful
to be "confronted by the fact that you don't get good jobs
without a degree so that you actually value your degree
better." He believes those two years would be a lesson in
empathy, as well: "You'd also appreciate what the people
that don't have [a college degree] put up with, a whole lot
better."
While from time to time he itches to "find something that
is more harmonious to his soul," Warner is happy with his
current job and plans to work here untilretirement.
In fact, his occasional lack of contentment, he reckons,
"is a good thing for me and the college, because it keeps me
interested in improving the way I and my office do things.
...It's almost an obsession, and I think this is linked with my
idealistic dreams of work."
His wife tends to agree. Lately, she said, Warner, who often has to adapt commercial database software to
Swarthmore conditions by writing additionalprogramming
scripts, hasbeen fascinated by this type of work. "He wakes
up at night with thoughts about how to do it better," Dale
says. "It really engages him."

Judd radiates rage in 'Double Jeopardy'

By Morghan Holt
For The Phoenix

tfi^uDe
Inventive writing
makes campy
'Buffy' best of TV
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is the best
show on television and has been for a
while now. A lot of people when I say that
thinkI'm slumming or just full of it. Those
people are idiots.
The show is a revised take on the low
"USA: Up All Night" camp of the 1992
Luke Perry-Kristy Swanson flick of the
same name and while in synopsis it sometimesreads like a mix between the monster mash antics of old "Scooby Doo" cartoons and the weird doings in the suburbs
of good David Lynch, the show is in fact
just so much more sublime than all that.
Joss Whedon (the screenwriter of the
original film) has given the show an intelligently rendered protagonist who
cross-pollinates the plucky heroines of
slasher films with a smidge of
Shakespeare's best girls and a whole great
dash of Wonder Woman; a complex tone
that holds steady between fantasy and
realism, violence and slapstick, scariness
and silliness, sarcasm and sincerity; an
endless resource of pop culture references and some of the most consistently
splendid and inventive writing in
primetime. What the show's also done—now that we've gotten its quality assurances out of the way—is given us this
wacked-out allegory of the teenage inferno where the horrors of high school
are rendered literally and growing up is
given back to us creature feature. Its escapism has granted it an unprecedented
access to the funniness and fearfulness
of our sometimes too-deeply felt adolescence, a permanent Halloween that
makes actual demons and vampires and
Incan mummies out of our adolescent
anxieties. This week's season premiere
saw Buffy off to college and it felt true
without resorting to any of the my socalled melodrama that hokey-ass "Felicity" has built a fanbase on; this new season promises more of the best from this
pop masterpiece.
Also premiering was "Angel," the
"Buffy" spin-off starring Angel, the
Buffster's 240- year-old Sartre-reading
guilt-ridden Gypsy-cursed ex-boyfriend,
and Cordelia Chase, Sunnydale's acidic
head cheerleader here fallen from grace.
Angel gets offered in the plot the opportunity to redeem himself after, oh, a
couple of centuries of eating people by
saving a few lost souls. Apparently, all the
souls that need saving are housed in the
bodies of superhot women. It seems like
an okay way to earn atonement, if that's
your thing for time eternal. "Angel" borrows from all the best sources: "Buffy,"
of course, film noir, Batman comics, "The
Devil's Advocate," and a wee bit of "Highlander: The Series," all to give us a city
of Angels that is, duh, anything but. It
treads awfully close to "G vs. E," the USA
deadxploitation series about a couple of
hipster-morons in God's own army trying
to earn a spot in Heaven by combating
demoninfestation in Hollywood, but let's
face it, folks, the supernatural detective
agency is an inexhaustible premise. The
show owes it greatest invisible debt, I
think, to the 1970's "The Incredible Hulk"
starring Bill Bixby. That show, like "Angel," was a surprisingly tender and melancholy treatment of the Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde myth in which man coexists
terribly in one body with monsters.
Angel and Cordelia were always the
worst parts of "Buffy." They were the
characters who in their conception lent
themselves too readily to carictature; his
existential angst, her shallow self-absorption always threatened to consume them
into cartoons, just one note a piece. But

MOVIE REVIEW

The air is still, sailboat rocking gently in the wind. The clear
blue water soothes, not a glimpse of land for miles. Following
an ultra-graphic sex scene, Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) sighs,
satisfied and completely convinced of her husband's love, and,
turning on her side, lets the rolling ocean and the smooth movement of the boat lull her to sleep. Suddenly roused, she reaches
for her husband, Nick, to find him goneand herself covered in
his blood.
Libby's reaction to this horrifying situation and its rotten
ramifications makes this movie worth watching. Her unique
take on vengeance and pain save an otherwise questionable plot.
What gives "Double Jeopardy" the intriguing twist it needs to
top the box office (which it did earlier this week)? Judd's portrayal of Libby's horror at being separated from her child and
betrayed by her husband, the way she deals with her seemingly-perfect world falling apart, and the poignancy ofher delicate features as she determines her revenge.
Somehow, Judd's performance, with the help of Tommy Lee
Jones' sympathetic and excellently-playedparole officer, keeps
the plot suprisingly fresh. The story is an amalgamation of a

revenge-filled thriller, a mama's tale of the heart-wrenching
desire to be reunited with her child, and a Fugitive-esque story
of a spouse wrongly accused.
Back on land, Libby learns that she is charged with her
husband's murder; when tried, she hasn't a glimmer of a chance.
The motive is there: Nick's life had been insuredfor $2 million,
and she was the beneficiary. They had some financial setbacks
and she could have desperately used the money. Convicted by
her peers, some her closest friends, sweet little Libby Parsons
goes directly to prison, detached from her son and the happiness she once knew. While imprisoned, Libby loses trackof her
child and the friend she had trusted to care for him. The anguish she feels for the lost contact is visible on her soft face as
she performs her grueling chores and tries to find her son. When
she finally discovers his location and calls him, she learns that
her husband isn't really dead in fact, he has run off with the
babysitter, their son, and the $2 million prize.

'My Year of Meats': novel a cross-cultural
journey into industry filmmaking
By Samira Mehta
For The Phoenix

BOOK REVIEW

Ruth Ozeki's first novel "My Year of
Meats" traces a year in the life of Jane
Tagaki Little as she makes a series of TV
shows featuring American wives and
their meat recipes for a Japanese audience.
The sponsor of the show, an American
company called Beef-EX, is trying to
boost sales in Japan by promoting meat
as healthy and American, stressing its
wholesome family qualities. Jane Little,
who goes by Tagaki, half-Japanese herself, accepts the job, partly out of desperation and partly out of a desire to
clarify Japanese misconceptions of
American culture.
Instead, Ueno, the Beef-EX liason,
sends her on a search for Mrs. Cleaver,
the perfect, white, middle-class wife with

p

elaborate beef recipes. (The production
motto is "Pork is possible, but beef is better.")

Tagaki and her production crew (who
have an affinity for JackDaniels and porn
in the motel rooms at night) quickly get
frustrated with therestrictions placed on
them by Beef-EX and decided to branch
out and portray a wider variety of the
American family: recent Mexian immigrants, a Lousiana couple with 12 children, 10 of whom were adopted from East
Asia and an interracial lesbian couple
from Northampton, Mass. Featuring each
of these families strains Tagaki's relationship with Ueno but please Ueno's wife
Akiko, who watches from her Tokyo
apartment.
Over the course of the year, Tagaki acquires a lover named Sloan and learns

Theband Luna sings a song about"looking lost in Chinatown." After my friend

it was uncannily descriptive of my excurChinatown

Callowhill and Filbert Streets and on the
other two by 11thand Bth Streets

a natural destinationbecause of its proximity the Market East Station. Once there,
however, I had little idea where to go.
Through much trialand error, I discovered enough to make my way around the
area and have a reasonably good time doling so. Along the way I met a few interesting people: the elderly owner of a small

the sake of simplicity, I offer you my im-

perfect

guide.

The hub of Chinatown business is the

restaurant district, which centers around
the three blocks running along 10thStreet
between Arch and Vine Streets and offers
!

a palatable alternative to the culinarilyirustrated Ville. The different types of
restaurants reflect the nature of the im-

Chinatown also offers a number of alternatives to Cantonese food. At least two
of the restaurants on 10thStreet specialize in Peking duck, a dish from northern
China that is eaten in flat pancakes with
plum paste. The area is also home to a
variety of Vietnamese, Thai, and Malaysian restaurants. Penang, a successful
Malaysian restaurant located at 117 N.
10th Street, is frequented by many
Swatties. Its extremely chic decor, an outgrowth of the restaurant's chain origin,
sets it apart from most of the other restaurants.

In addition to eateries, the restaurant
district is home to many small businesses, craft stores, grocery stores and
bakeries. Chung May Food Market, located at 1017-1021 Race Street, is the
largest grocery store and sells a variety
of foods not available at the Co-op. A craft
store on 10th Street between Arch and
Race streets sells a number of interesting plants.
Chinatown hosts a number of celebrations each year to commemorate annual
holidays, two of which are especially notable. The New Year Festival, usually
held in late January or early February, is
marked by parades, fireworks, and a banquet. The Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated during a full moon in fall, this
year on Sept. 24. The celebration includes
a parade and the consumption of
mooncakes (pastries filled with bean
paste and imprinted with designs).

migrant community.
Since Cantonese people comprise the
largest and best-established group in the
community, most of the restaurants offer Cantonese or other southern Chinese
tare. Of these, Lee How Fook, located at
219 N. llth Street, is one of the best values (money is not wasted on decor).
Charles Plaza, located at 234 N. 10th
street, is another favorite. Its owners

Many restaurants serve dim sum (a
meal of special dishes brought around on
carts) daily, but it is most popular on
weekend mornings. The Imperial Inn, at

146 N. 10th Street, offers one of the bet-

ter dim sum services.

A small group of Swarthmore students adopted a new neighborhood for
the summer
one far from the labeled shrubbery and groomed paths
of this collegiate paradise. Led by Susan Lin 'OO, the students served as
mentors for high school students in
Chinatown. For several hours every
afternoon, they helped the students,
aged 15-21, study topics such as their
neighborhood history, English languageand the immigrant experience.
Lin developed theprogram with the
assistance of a Lang Opportunity
Grant from Swarthmore. The idea
came to her last semester while she
was volunteering for the Chinatown
Tutorial, a Swarthmore group that
makes weekly trips to Chinatown to tutor elementary school students at local churches. She originally hoped to
bring the high school students to
Swarthmore for an overnight camp
but realized that this was unrealistic
on a $lO,OOO budget.
Instead, she and the other volunteers worked out of a church in
Chinatown. One day, a Swarthmore
graduate who grew up in Chinatown
and is now working at a management
consulting firm came to speak to the
students. In addition to continuing
their studies, Lin encouraged the students to keep daily journals.
Through working there daily for
weeks, Lin came to know the people,
organizations, and businesses of
Chinatown closely. She was quick to
emphasize that Chinatown is not just
a business district but a community as
well. But the city of Philadelphia
doesn't necessarily see it that way; the
area has no school and no library, and
a few years ago, residents had to petition for bus service to a middle school
that offered ESL.
The community also suffers from
sharply delineated boundaries; being
bordered on three sides by the Convention Center, Market East Station,
and the Vine Street Expressway, it has
little opportunity for expansion. New
immigrants to the area have trouble
finding housing as property prices
soar.
A positive outgrowth of the
neighborhood's problems is the increased effort to foster a stronger
community. Asian Americans United
is a prominent neighborhood group
that organizes social as well as political functions. The Philadelphia
Chinatown Development Corporation
solicits the help of businesses in improving conditions in the area.
Through these efforts, the organiza-*
tion successfully secured subsidized
housing for senior citizens.
The average tourist to the neighborhood doesn't consider its unique problems. Most stay within the restaurant
district and focus on spending rather
than observing. For Lin and the other
volunteers, however, the summer was
made rich through human contact, not
material gain. "When I went back last
weekend and saw some of the kids I'd
worked with this summer," she said
excitedly, "they told me they were still
writing in their journals."

On the whole, "Double Jeopardy" is a

it is, for the most part, a quite absorbing

Double Jeopardy

Rated R.
StarringAshley judd,Tommy Lee Jones,

Directed by Bruce Beresford.
Written by David Weisberg
and Douglas Cook.

From BUFFY, pg.
here Cordelia's riches-to-rags tale of woe gives her what will pass right now for substance and Whedon has done a really interesting rethinking of Angel. Angel's murderous instincts and meat-slab tall, dark, and handsome good looks are counterbalanced by a kind of awkward fish-out-of-water quality, and that mix of brutality and
naivete makes him appealing. He is not,| as he tells us, a people-person, lame in all
things societal, and in that he has what one Salon magazine columnists calls "the
potential to become one of pop culture's hiost intriguing dark innocents."
"Angel" is not all good all the time.The show does not always do such a good job as
its predecessor of incorporating disparate elements and tones. The comedy and drama
here both feel very delicate whereas the action sequences tend more towards the
high-octane action blockbuster variety arid that makes for a kind of bad fit. It'll be a
better show when it starts to feel more like one whole show. In lieu of a spin-off that
features the zany antics of Giles living in a walk-up with a beautiful incubus and a
wicca witch, it'll do for now.

Ozeki said that she did not intend to

wanted to write an autobiographicallybased, though by no means strictly autobiographical, account of her time making

She did indeed make a similar series of

experiences led to "My Year of Meats."
It was in researching the novel that she
discovered some of the less savory aspects of the meat industry. Ruth Ozeki,

like her main character, Jane Tagaki
Little, has a Japanese mother and an

American father (Ozeki is a psuedonym),
but she does not see herself as part of that
Asian-American tradition which includes
Amy Tan and David Henry Huang.
Though she finds their work interesting

concerns of ethnicity and bi-racial identity, they are not a dominant theme in her

One of Robin William's best performances, this true account of the Nazi occupation in

hard-edged, completely un-sugarcoated tale of one man's quest to re-instill hope in the

a combination of the most shallow, petty aspects of your high school experience.

"Three Kings"

7:40,10:15

Small-town gossip, scandalous sex that could never have remained a secret, nosy neighbors, and an extraordinarily talented hockey team are the fundamental elements of the

This movie could be promising....assuming that, this time, it was shot in its actual setting.

"Blue Streak"
PG-13.93 minutes.

Picking 'em: baseball playoff predictions
By Patty Barrientos

It took 163 days to decide the postseason teams, but now it is final. Eight teams begin the quest for that piece of jewelry on their
fingers. The American League boasts the usual suspects: the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the New York Yankees, and the
Texas Rangers. The NationalLeague offers two debuts: the Arizona
Diamonbacks, making the playoffs for the first time in only its second year of existence, and the New York Mets, who could be considered missing in action under the shadow of the other New York
team and had an eleven-year postseason draught. The perennial

a game that covered every inch of the
field many times over, Swathmore's back
line gave it all they had against that of
Delaware. Danielle D'Olivera 'OO went
down with an ankle injury while she was
bursting down the field with the ball, but
luckily D'Olivera had already pounded
into the ground Delaware's All-American
outside center before she had time to join
the other injured gimps Meghan Brennan
'OO and Noelle Goodin'OO on the sideline.
Swat's B-side put up a good fight
against the Delaware team but UDel triumphed 15-0. Nonetheless, many rookies
gained from the experience. Laurie
Smith 'Ol surprised Delaware with various outstanding tackles, as didKateFama
'Ol, who showed her new skills in the
scrum. Lisa Jenkins 'O2 switched from
the back line to flanker for the first time,
a position that gave her ample use of her
tackling and strength talent. In the back
line, flyhalf Emiliana Bean 'O2, inside center Joan Javier 'O3, and outside center
Esther Kim 'O3 found their rhythm toward the end of the match, getting numerous good runs. Jessica Lee 'O3 saved
Swathmore from Delaware's breakaways
with her superb tackles and good thinking.
The Swat women ruggers play this Saturday at West Chester University, their
last of three divisional games. This game
will determine their presence at Championships. In the meantime, Swathmore
has been working hard to compensate for
their weaknesses, which Delaware revealed in the past game.

Muhlenberg, the team was completely
exhausted and mentally drained, but
they still had to meet up with Johns
Hopkins. The first two games of the
match were quick losses as Hopkins
pounded the ball at Swat.
In the third game, however, the tone
changed a bit. Buoyed by a desire to
have fun on the court, the women came
out more confident and energetic than
previously. The third game resulted in
a loss, but the score of 18-20 reflected
the team's renewed energy. "I don't
know how we did it," said Chan, "but
by the third match we really surprised
Hopkins. We actually pulled together
the energy to put up a good fight."
"I had so much fun during this
game," Chan added. "We really dug
deep."
French commented, "It's too bad that
we didn't win, but that disappointment
is only second to my pride at having
played so well against a tough opponent."
The next two weeks promise to be intense for the women as they face
Wilmington a second time, participate
in the Seven Sisters and Goucher tournaments, and face conference foe
Dickinson.

First NHL season without Gretzky opens
By Rachael Schultz and LynnTrieu

For The Phoenix

The highlights of the start of this NHL season, which opened last Friday
night, are the loss of Wayne Gretzky, one of the league's premier players,
and the addition of a new team, the Atlanta Thrashers.
At a dedication ceremony in Edmonton, Canada, Gretzky officially hung
up his skates after a 21-year career. Following the retirement of his number 99, the first team and the last team that he played for, the Oilers and the
New York Rangers, skated to a 1-1 tie. The Atlanta Thrashers, the league's
newest franchise, opened in front of a sold-out crowd, but victory was
claimed by the New Jersey Devils, who triumphed 4-1.
The Dallas Stars, the 1998-99 Stanley Cup Champions, successfully defended their title in a 6-4 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins.
The Buffalo Sabres, Dallas Stars, and Detroit Red Wings are the top three
picks likely to claim the cup this year, with the Philadelphia Flyers and,
somewhat surprisingly, San Jose Sharks rounding out the top five. However, the predicted top teams already have some obstacles to overcome.
Buffalo has Jay McKee and Rhett Warrener unsigned as well as restricted
free agents holding out for more money. Although Dallas has looked strong
in their first two games, they are already beset by injuries to their three top
players, Mike Modano, Joe Niewendyk, and Darryl Sydor.
Detroit takes it a 11
With the break-up of the Russian Five last season, the Red Wings needed
to infuse some new talent into their roster. The recent addition of veteran
defense men Chris Chelios and Steve Duschene supplied Detroit's defense
with some of the experience and strength that it lacked in the 1998-99 season. In addition, Larry Murphy and Norris Trophy runner-up Nicklas
Lidstrom are returning for yet another season on the blue line. Detroit's
offense remains strong with Steve Yzerman as captain, but one of the keys
to the franchise's success this season will be the improved performance of
Russians Sergei Fedorov and Slava Kozlov. The Red Wings' weak link will
be goalie Chris Osgood, but as long as he remains healthy and confident, he
will carry his team to their third Stanley Cup in four years.
...

Buffalo takes it a 11
Although the Sabres are one of the youngest teams in the NHL, they are
also one of the most dedicatedand hard working teams, with an extremely
high level of confidence that can take them as far as they want to go.
Buffalo's coach, Lindy Ruff, is one of the top young coaches in the league,
being one of the few NHL coaches to have reached the conference finals in
his first year and the Stanley Cup finals his second year. The Sabres are led
by the fearless Michael Peca, who is one of the top defensive forwards in
the gameand excels on power plays, short-handed situations, and quite possibly is the best open ice hitter in the league. Last but not least, Buffalo has
Dominik "the Dominator" Hasek, an MVP in the NHL twice in the past three
years and best goalie five times in the last six years. Hasek, who singlehandedly won the gold medal for the Czech Republic during the 1998 Winter Olympics, will undoubtedly carry the Sabres to the franchise's first ever
Stanley Cup victory during his last year in the league.
