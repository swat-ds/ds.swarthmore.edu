Two Student-Run Courses in the Works
By

Jessica Harbour

Despite the faculty's unwillingness

to

grant creditfor student-run courses, Jus-

tin Hall '97 is offering a course drawing
upon his experience with the WorldWide
Web and his theories on the relation of
computers to society. Other student-run
courses, such as one about race and
ethnicity offered by Amy Albert '9B and
Maurisa Thompson '9B, will soon follow.
Hall's class, officially titled "WebEthics: Publishing Problems and Prospects,"
draws from a number of print and electronic texts. "We will consider inclusion,
voice, politics, economics, ethics, [and]
education through the study of existing
web sites, as well as relevant print texts,"
he wrote in the course description. "By
the end of the term, students will have a
sense of the current state and future potentialofonlinemedia."Kenneth Gergen,
professor of psychology, has agreed to
sponsor the course, which meets on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 8:30 to
9:45 inDupont 138, a computer-equipped
classroom. "I picked a bitch of a time on
purpose," Hall said. "I want folks who
are dedicated, and I want them to be
fresh. Yeah, you gotta wake up early,
yeah, you might not get credit Now that
we have that out of the way, you must
care about what you're learning. Let's

go."
During the first week of the course,
students will learn how to create their

own Web pages and search the Web for
pages relating to a specific topic or area
of interest. In subsequent weeks, students will explore specific areas of Web
ethics such as educational potential,
online narratives, the validity and integrity of transmitting visual art over the
Web, and the possibility of a "digital
democracy."
Hall has chosen to focus on many of
his own Web writings, especially from
his home page. Links from the Underground, as well as works by Donald
Barthelme, Julie Petersen, Howard

Rheingold, and Scott McCloud. "I have plaining her reasons for starting the

Public Safety Still An Issue on Campus

others in mind," he said. "And when the
school fails to do stuff, it makes me
scared and angry."
Khafilat Abiola '99 said that she became more cautious after the incidents.
"I stopped going out alone after 11
p.m. or 11:30p.m.; whenever I saw someone I didn't recognize, I would walk
faster or go into a building," she recalled.
"It's comforting to me to see the Garnet
Patrol jackets, or to see Public Safety
driving around. I think that it's quite
effective."
Yonnie Kim '9B, however, sees the
student security force as "mostly symbolic," since there are very few incidents
that have to be dealt with on campus. In
fact, Kim said that Swarthmore is "one of
the safest campuses I've ever seen," and
added that she felt that students, especially female students, are most likely to

Swarthmore. Lastmonth's flashing incident again raised student consciousness
of public safety on campus, but discussion of the incident—and others of its
type—can lead to speculation of the actual safety level on campus, the quality of
protection provided by both student-run
and departmental Public Safety, and the
College's awareness of the safety needs
of certain students.
This is the first in a series of articles
that will explore these and other issues
regarding public safety on campus. Here,
we let students have their say:.
Of the eleven students interviewed for

She agreed with many students that "Security is kind of lax, but then," she added,

Kristin Sostowski '97 agreed that more
safety measures need to be takenon campus. Her biggest concernwas the locking
of Willets and Mary Lyon dormitories.
"I think it's very bad to lock the doors,
because what if a student desperately
needs to get in," she said. "If the doors
are going to be locked, students should
have master keys or scanner cards so that
they can get inside in emergencies."
Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave talked last week about his
department'sresponse to safety incidents,
specifically the flashing that occurred
two weeks ago.
'This incident will factor into what
parts of the campus wepatrol," Redgrave
said. "We always amend the way we
configure patrols, contingent on the current campus situation."
The Swarthmore borough police have
also been notified, part of the effort to
disseminate information about the suspect and to heighten awareness, said
Redgrave.

The film tells the story of both African

opens in West Africa, where an AfricanAmerican model is basking in the sunlight on the beach for a photo shoot near
a large castle or fort where newly captured slaves were taken to be held before
their forced journey to the NewWorld. A
stream of tourists passes before the camera along with the smiling model. Suddenly an African man appears, a selfappointed guardian of the memory of the

it as "a special class that represents the

combination ofintellectual curiosity and
empathic concern that Swarthmore is all
about."
Rodner met this week with President
Al Bloom to express his concerns regarding the decision not to offer this class.
Rodner commentedthat PresidentBloom
"was very receptive" and said "he would
do his best" to continue the course.
Marcie Pullman '96 characterized the
class as a means "to step out of the
Western paradigm of thebody as a purely
physical entity" and thus allow"the possibility that there is a more metaphysical
reality that can affect the healing process."
However, Pullman notes that "Dr.
Posner has tried to work with the administration so that everyone that wants to
take the class can" but she felt it was
obvious "from the response of the administration that they really don't want
the class."

ProvostKeith explained that themoney
used to fund the course came from the
faculty salary budget, which has a certain
amount set aside for faculty replacement
classes. It costs the College between
$4OOO to $6OOO for each course that is
offered in addition to the normal academic program. Wisdom and Healing
Arts was offered as an "enhancement"
course because regular faculty members
from the Sociology and Anthropology
Department were on leave.
When asked if the course could be
offered ifDr. Posner was willing to work
gratis, Keith noted that she would be
"hesitant" with such an arrangement yet
was unaware of any official College
policy.
Nonetheless, she did express her personal thoughts on the subject. Since the
Provost is ultimately responsible for all
faculty members, Keith illustrated how it
could be difficult for her to maintain
authority over a volunteer instructor.

the present to the era of slave trading and
back again, calling into question some of
our conceptions of the slave trade, and
focusing on the interpersonal relationships and the resistance of Africans to

Many students were visibly moved by
the picture. "I think it was completely
amazing," said JoanneWeill-Greenburg
'96. Gabi Kruks-Wisner '99, commenting on the complicated issue of slavery as
presented in Sankofa, said "We've all

Hollywood and the established film industry is like a "command center of cultural dictatorship" thatcontrols and colonizes all of our minds. "There is no cultural democracy," he declared, but

He explained that when Hollywood

the passivity that comes from paying

Increase in Early Decision Acceptances
By Wendy Kemp

Recent changes to the Early Decision
policy have resulted in a stronger pool of
applicants. With the elimination of the
second round of Early Decision, last
year's class of 1999 the first to have
only one Early Decision deadline turned
in fewer Early Decision applications than
expected. "We had fewer applicants in
Early Decision -137 and admitted only
84," said Susan Untereker, the Director
of Admissions. "Last year the deadline
was changed to January 1 and Winter
Early Decision was eliminated. Perhaps
that was why there was a dip."
In contrast, there were 173 Early Decision applicants for the class of 2000, and
110 were accepted, an acceptance rate
three percent higher thanlast year' There
were other differences.
"We were pleased to see a better balance of men and women 50 and 60
respectively [among accepted Early Decision applicants] because, traditionally, men are underrepresented in the
pool," said Untereker. The SAT scores of
this year's Early Decision applicants,
before recentering, were slightly higher
than those of last year's Early Decision
applicants. Other factors, such as class
rank and GPA, all compared favorably to
those of previous years.
There are usually few students ofcolor
and foreign nationals in the Early Decision pool, but this year brought a change.
Three African American students, two
Latinos, two foreign nationals and one
American abroad have been accepted
through Early Decision.
One more surprise has come out of the
Early Decision students of the class of
2000. Despite the fact that the deposit to

position in the class has risen from $lOO
to $250, every one of the 110 accepted
applicants sent in the deposit, with the
exception of one student who asked to
defer admission to the fall of 1997. "This
is a 100% yield rate, which makes us
think that the financial aid packages are
very acceptable to the families involved,"
said Untereker. "It also makes me think
that the students who decided to apply
Early Decision were great matches with
the College and very much wanted to
come here."
Untereker credits this improvement to
the Admissions Office, especially the
recent additions to its staff. "I think out
Admissions staff, including our four
'new' deans, did a terrific job of getting

the Swarthmore message out there this
fall," she said. "I know of several applicants who switched from Regular to Early
Decision after the Open House, and several who Fed-Exed their applications in
to make the November 15th deadline
because of the Open House, so present
Swatties, the faculty and the campus itself continue to be extremely important

in attracting great applicants."
The first class of the new millennia
could prove to be Swarthmore's finest
yet, at least judging from the applications processed so far. "We're very excited about the class of2000, because it's
so strong and so big. Our current applications for the class are 3960 the highest
in the history ofSwarthmore and up 14%
from last year," said Untereker.

Intercultural Center Unveils a Full
Program for the Upcoming Semester
By Stacey

A. Kalovidouris

Feb. 2—Spurred by theinterconnected
issues ofrace, gender, sexuality and class,
the Intercultural Center is presenting a
seriesof movies, lectures and parties that
promises to be enlightening and fun.
Nestled in the southeastern comer of
Tarble Social Center, the Intercultural
Center (IC) is a homey setting that provides a forum for multiculturalism at
Swarthmore. The IC is a coalition of
student-run organizations for Asian
Americans (SAO), Latino and Hispanics
(HOLA), and Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay
(LBGA) students. Programming and
administration of IC events are managed
by the director, Fernando Chang-Muy,
and the student interns. Tarn Doan '9B,
Anna Corrales '97, and Beck
Feibelman'96.
Reflecting its affiliations with theBlack
Cultural Center (BCC), the IC is focusing this February on many of the themes
important to Black History Month. For
example, on February 9, Dr. Kenneth
Manning, the author of the nationally
known Black Apollo ofScience, will be
discussing people of color in the sciences. "The aim of the faculty lecture
series is to allow students and faculty to
get toknow each other in a context different from the classroom and discuss is-

sues ofinterestand concern," saidChangMuy. This lecture is sponsored by the
Cooperfoundation and refreshments will
be provided afterwards. It appears that
even the federal government is concerned
with Manning's work: the headliner of
Mr. Manning's book, Mr. Everett Just,
the first black man to graduate from
Harvard, will be commemorated this
week with his own U.S. government
stamp.

Besides lectures such as Manning's,
the IC sponsors a speech given by an
activist Swarthmore alum, and a movie
on the first Wednesday and Friday of
eachmonth. The last Wednesday of each
month will showcase faculty talks. For
instance, in February French Professor
Micheline Rice-Maximin will speak on
African American Diaspora.
March and April will be jam-packed
withlC events. Notably, on March 6, Pat
Egan '92 of the AIDS law center will be
giving a lecture. Egan represents people
with HIV-AIDS and files lawsuits on
their behalf. Chang-Muy points out that
the activist alum series is a good opportunity for alums and current students to
reconnect." Such connections could
translate into internships and projects for
current students.
The Puerto Rican film maker/poet and
recipient of the Pew Charitable Trust,
"

Frances Negron, will be the Cooperfundedlecturer in March. Looking closer
to home, Professor of Religion Don
Swearer will speak on Buddhism in
America and Professor of Sociology
Braulio Mufioz will talk on Latino issues
in the U.S.
Of particular interest in April will be
Hyen Ju Rho '95, an activist alum who
now is in the Education law center and
works with kids of special needs, and the
Cooper-funded speaker, Mari Matsuda,
authorofWords that Wound who will be
discussing hate speech.
At the end of each month there is a
coffee house event, a non-alcoholic gettogether with music. "Last year there
were two and they were crowded and
everyone talked and had food, tea and
coffee..." says Feibelman '96.
All the fanfare will end dancingly with
a special performance by Dunye, a West
African Dance Troupe. In the Quaker
spirit, IC events are free and open to all.
This Friday night theIC will be showing "My neighbor Totoro," a movie
that discusses issues relating to Asian,
Latino, African-American, and gay affairs. This month and every month, the
IC offersalternatives to other social events
thattake place on campus, and it brings a
diverse crowd of people together in a
welcoming atmosphere.

SC Talks about Efficacy, Democracy

New agenda includes election reform and leadership training
By

Laura Smid

At last Sunday's meeting, the Student
Council discussed how to make itself a
more effective representative of the student body. The meeting began with an
informal vote to keep council meetings
open (except in special cases of confidential issues) and concludedwith abrainstorming session in which several members offered their views on how to make
thegroup more effective and more democratic. Ideas included election reform
and leadership training.
Central to the discussion was the issue
ofhow to increase thecouncil's credibility with both students and administrators. "If we don'thave credibility," said
member and CPC Rep. Giridhar
Srinvasan, pointing to a list of Student
Council goals for the spring semester,
"we can't do any of these things."
The problem, Srinvasan points out, is
"acatch-22." Without the support of the
students, the council cannot gain credibility with the administration, and therefore cannot accomplish what would give
it more credibility with the students.
Furthermore, on controversial issues, the
councilcould potentially be caught in the
difficultposition of trying toremain loyal
to the interests of the students while maintaining constructive communication with
the administration.
Although the Student Council is a

democratically-electedbody designed to

represent the interests of the students,

Alyssa Rayman-Read, Member at Large,
sees "a gap between thestudentbody and
the Student Council" and Jude
Uzonwanne notes that "a lotof students
don't even know who the Student Council members are." According to Uzonwanne, only about 500 students—fewer
than half—voted in thelastStudent Council election.
In order to make the council more
representative of the students, Tony
Cheesebrough suggested that council
members be elected by dorm. This way,
each member would represent a specific
group of students with whom he or she
could easily communicate. The proposal
has not yet been put tovote, but, if implemented, Uzonwanne feels it would make
representation more "tangible." Students
living off-campus would, presumably,
elect their own representative^).
Besides credibility, another issue in
the council's effectiveness is its ability to
function well internally. Discussing Student Council meetings, Rayman-Read
said, "People come in almost ready to be
frustrated with each other." RaymanRead hopes to hire an outside consultant
to train members of Student Council to
work together effectively, even when they
disagree on issues. She also hopes to
encourage council members to "bond
more as people," perhaps by organizing

or social events apart from the
actual meetings.
Despite Student Council's problems,
Srinvasan is optimistic about theupcoming semester. He sees the council as a
group of "excellent people" who have
the "professionalism" to work as a team
retreats

to accomplish change, and he hopes that
an issue of great student interest—such

as the meal plan or financial aid—will
motivate more students to get involved.

Members of the Student Council for

What You're Missing by Being at Swat
To Fund or Not to Fund Student
Groups
By Jessica Burke
The Minnesota Daily (U. of Minnesota)

(U-WIRE) Students who disagree with
the ideologies of certain organizations
on campus may soon be able to stop
funding them.

Budget Cte.
Recommends
Large Increase
in Student
Activities Fee
By

Desiree Joseph

In the past, efforts had been made to
limit the annual increases of the Student
Activities Fee to $1- $3. For the next
academic year, however, this increase
will be between $5 and $B, the largest
increase in recent history.
Each year, the Budget Committee recommends to the Student Council the
amount of the fee that Swarthmore students must pay to fund activities, events
and chartered groups on campus. Students are paying $194 towards the Student Activities Fund for this academic
year. Last semester, the Budget Committee proposed a sharp increase of $l4. The
budget Committee Treasurer, Tanisha
Little' 97 believed that this was necessary. She said that the small increases of
the past had not reflected the increasing
demands on the Fund. "Things are more
expensive now," she explained, "groups
have asked for about $15,000 more than
we had to give."
Thelargenumberofnew school groups
was identified as another reason for the
significant increase. Both Little and Anthony Cheesebrough'97, Student Council Member, pointed out that many new
groups have been recently chartered in
the school and many more are in the
process of doing so.
The school's Board of Managers must
,

now finalize the increase.

Sen. Cal Larson, R-Fergus Falls, and
Sen. Roy Terwilliger, R-Edina, introduced a bill in the Legislature that would
alter the way the University collects student services fees.
The bill would stop the Board of Regents from forcing students to fund organizations to which they do not voluntarily belong or with whose ideologies they
do not agree. This description includes
every organization at the University.
Larson said he has heard from a number of non-traditional students who oppose the fee, and if he was a student he
wouldn't want to fund some of the organizations here either.
But Chad Reichwald, chairman of the
Student Services Fees Committee,
doesn't agree with the senators' reasoning for supporting the bill.
"Paying your fees is somewhat like
paying your taxes," Reichwald said. The
people of Minnesota don't use everything their taxes fund, Reichwald said,
and neither do students at the University.
However, the services and organizations
are here for students to use, and they are
encouraged to do so, he added.
Day-school students carrying six or
more credits pay $146.45 per quarter in
student services fees. That money goes to
fund thecultural centers,Boynton Health
Service, the student unions and other
groups. In all, there are 37 fee-receiving
groups at the University.
Students are not automatically members of an organization just because they
pay a fee to support it, said June Nobbe,
adviser for the fees committee. Nobbe
said the legislation would change the
entire concept of the University's student-fee system.
The University's position is that as a
land-grant institution, it is the school's
responsibility to expose students to a
variety of differentgroups and organizations, Nobbe said.
This is not the first time the issue of
student organization funding has come
up. The idea was mostrecently proposed
in last spring's All-Campus Elections.
Phillip Schweitzer and Ben Powers
were candidates for Minnesota Student
Association president and vice president,
respectively. They advocated a change in
the way fees are now collected.
The pair proposed a check-off system
in which students would pick the groups
they wish to fund.
Other students, including former members of the fees committee, also agree
with the positive check-off.
But Reichwald said any sort of check-

off system would drastically alter the
state of student organizations. "Every
single unit that receives fees right now
would cease to exist," Reichwald said.
The University of Virginia made a
similar policy late lastyear. The decision
was in response to a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that forced the university to fund a
Christian student magazine.
Under the policy, students can get one
quarter of their fees back if they do not
agree with a group's ideology or speech.
However, the university decided that
only one fourth of the organizations can
be classified as having ideologies or publications with which the students can
disagree.

Program helps grads land Jobs

(U-WIRE) While some graduates hj s»v..
difficult time trying to find a job, students in the Center for Advanced Electronic Materials Processing (AEMP) often find themselves wondering which job
to accept rather thanwhere to start looking.
Companies such as Texas Instruments,
IBM, Intel and LSI Logic have been
recruiting young talent actively for the
past few years. They often turn to AEMP
Director Nino Masnari for what they see
as some of the best, brightest and most
well-prepared students in the country.
Recent graduates who have participated in AEMP now work for companies
such as NASAand DuPont, Masnarisaid.
Masnari said approximately 130 graduates who have beeninvolved with AEMP
have found employment with starting
salaries that range from $60,000 to
a

$70,000.

The program, whichbegan at NCS U in
1988 with the help of the National Science Foundation, is one of the nation's
most competitive.
Twenty-one centers have been established in the United States since the program started in 1985. Each center is
granted funding for eleven years and is
reviewed every year, including an intense review every three years.
With roughly 25 faculty members, 90
graduate students, 50 undergraduates and
15 post-doctoral researchers working
there, the center is one of the most highly
regarded programs in the nation because
the students learn to work on problems as
a team.

Coup D'etat in Niger
On Saturday, January 27th, the Republic of Niger's army Chief ofStaff led
a successful military insurrection against
the democratically elected civilian government. All day long, stateradio broadcast martial music, telephone links were
severed and tanks, assisted by infantry,
patrolled the streets. Arguing that his
actions were taken to ward off a civil war,
the rebel leader appealed to the international community for understanding in a
post-coup speech. Meanwhile, deposed
President Mahamane Ousmane has not
been sighted since his arrest by rifletoting troops on Saturday.
Oneof the poorest nations in the world,
Niger is located north of Nigeria, and
ekes out a living by exporting uranium.
Reacting swiftly to the coup, the European Union and the United States froze
most aid and assistance programs.
The coup in Niger comes barely a
week after a similarcoup in Sierra Leone.
West Africa has been plagued recently
by military unrest, such as the 1995 coup
in Gambia and the ruthless clampdown
on environmentaland pro-democracy activists in Nigeria.

Financial Woes Hit Apple
CUPERTINO, Calif. (Jan 30) —Apple
Computer Inc. shares fell to their lowest
in 18 months amid waning speculation
that an acquisition by Sun Microsystems
Inc. is imminent. The thinking on Wall
Street is aptly captured by The Nando
Times in an interview with analyst Daniel
Kunstier of J.P. Morgan Securities, who
remarked, "As the clock keeps ticking
and there's no offer, the market is making an assumption that there will be no
offer."
Apple's stock fell 1 7/8 to 27 1/4 in
early afternoon trading of 3.8 million
shares, making it the eighth-most active
stock in U.S. markets. Earlier, the stock
fell as low as 26 55/64, its lowest level
since July 20, 1994. In later developments, merger talks between Apple and
Sun Microsystems were confirmed as
having broken down because Sun's offer
price was too low. In the wake of the
breakdown, Apple debt was downgraded
to junk bond status.

Harris is accused of offering an acquaintance $20,000 to stage the robbery

Monday and charged with first-degree

were both jailed pending a hearing. Authorities believe Harris' motive was financial, but they did not elaborate. He
has refused to answer police questions

The case bears similarities to a 1989

wife. He committed suicide hours after
police learnedfromhisbrother thatStuart

California

WASHINGTON (Jan 30)
During
his tenure as chairman of the government
board that oversaw U.S. radio broadcasts
to Communist Europe during the 1980s
and early 19905, GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes allowed excessive
salaries, golden parachutes and a costly
renovation of the living quarters of a
government-paid official, reports reveal.
One report by the inspector general of
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found
that the after-tax pay of its top executives
had ballooned to $20,000 to $40,000
more than their counterparts in the federal government. Anotherauditreviewed
by The Associated Press found the
operation's president, Eugene E. Pell,
had spent $250,000 in taxpayer funds
between 1989 and 1991 to renovate the
two apartments in Germany where he
lived. The decorations, auditors found,
included brass lanterns imported from
England and four handwoven Afghan
rugs. Cleaning and gardening cost an
additional $1,750 per month.
At a campaign appearance Monday in
New Hampshire, Forbes said the amount
of money the auditors "talked about over
a seven-year period was infinitesimal"
and thatcorrectiveactions were taken for
each problem. "We should have great
pride in the achievement of Radio Free
Europe and Radio Free Liberty." he said.
"They played a critical part in bringing

Situation Tense as Warships face off around Islet
in Greek-Turkish Standoff
LONDON (Jan 30) Warships from
Turkey and Greece on Tuesday warily
circled a rocky, east Aegean island, which
the two NATO membersboth claim. Each
side demanded the other pull back from
the area, but with no sign ofeither doing
so. The island, uninhabited except for
goats and rabbits, lies between the Turkish coast and the Greek island of
Kalymnos.
"We cannot help butbe worried about
the situation in such a delicateand explosive region as the eastern Mediterranean,"
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Grigory Karasin told a news briefing.
Early Wednesday morning. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke
announced that war was averted only
through American intervention led by
President Clinton.
The conflict began last week after the
captain of a Turkish ship thatran aground
on the rock refused to let a Greek tug
assist it, saying the territory belonged to
Turkey. Since then, Turks and Greeks
have planted their own country's flag
there, ripping down those of theirrivals.
Greece'sblue and white striped standard
now flies over the outcropping and officials said Greek soldiers were on the
island guarding the flag.
This dispute is only the latestof many
between the two countries. They are also
in almost constant conflict over the Mediterranean islandofCyprus, dividedsince
1974 when Turkish troops occupied the
north during a Greek-backed coup.

Trust, the College Budget Committee, and us.
For the record:
Rumors havebeen circulating this semester that theCollegeBudget Committee
is considering significant changes in the amount of financial aid available to
students.
This week, The Phoenix attempted to confirm those rumors. Our staff spoke
with various CBC members to find out what the committee is considering and
when its decision would be announced to the student body.
CBC proposals have traditionally remainedconfidential until being presented
to the Board of Managers. While most committee members said they would
respect that policy, and no one actually gave budget data to our staff, some
indicated a willingness to share specific information with The Phoenix.
We decided to give President Al Bloom the opportunity to convince us that it
would be wrong to obtain and publish information that the CBC intended to hold
in confidence, and informed him that some committee members had indicated
they were willing to share confidential information with us. We did not say that
committee members had already given us information.
During a meeting between our editors-in-chief, our publisher, President Bloom,
and Paul Aslanian, vice-president for finance and planning, Bloom made statements that suggested thathe thought we had already learned specific numbers. He
did not directly ask us what we knew, and we felt no obligation to tell him.
Newspapers, we thought, can need secrets as much as budget committees.
President Bloom and Mr. Aslanian convinced us that the publication of
confidential CBC information would severely hinder the committee's ability to
do good work by lessening themembers' trust in eachother's confidence, and we
agreed not to pursue the matter. However, Bloom and Aslanian agreed that
Swarthmore's students and faculty should know the full details of the CBC's
proposals before those proposals are presented to the Board of Managers, and
agreed to ask the committee to release its entire proposal to the public before
sending it to the Board.
We were later informed that the committee had decided to release a general
outline of its plans, but to withhold specific numerical data until the Board
approves the budget. The studentbody will thushave no chance tocontest specific
numbers until after the Board makes a final decision.
We were also toldthat significant time was spent during yesterday's committee
meeting discussing a potential breach of confidentiality involving committee
members and The Phoenix. President Bloom told our publisher Thursday night
that he was no longer sure ofhow much we knew. He had apparently interpreted,
or misinterpreted, our statements to mean that confidentiality had in fact been
broken.
This miscommunicationhad unfortunate consequences. Had we made it clear
to President Bloom that confidentiality had never been broken, students might
have learned the full facts of the CBC's plan, whatever it may be, in advance of
theBoard's meeting to discuss thatplan. But they won't. Meanwhile, CBC wasted
valuabletime worrying about a breach of confidentiality that never happened, and
some committee members may not trust us or each other for a long time.
For these consequences, we are sincerely sorry.

Give course credit for career-oriented work.

The notion of a liberal arts curriculum has roots in some ancient traditions of
higher education, traditions once explicitly defined against more vocational or
career-oriented paths and grounded in the assumption that learning on the
undergraduate level can be separated from grubby practical considerations.
Traces of that assumption are evident in the College policyregarding internships
and other applied study: students' "practical" work may be given credit only if
supervised by Swarthmore instructors and directly linked to their academic
programs, a restriction that considerably limits the scope of potential careeroriented undergraduate work.
While there may be compelling philosophical objections to expanding the
College's horizons in this respect, administrators need to take into account
students' employmentpotential as well. Requiring that outside workbe "likely to
contribute to a student's progress in regular course work," as stated in theCollege
Bulletin, eliminates vast fieldsof study that theCollege is not equipped to handle.
Limiting potential for applied academic credit to one credit per career further
impedes students' efforts to prepare for future employment by combining the
useful with theacademic. We feel that Collegepolicy shouldreflect the changing
times by allowing for a broader range of work outside the parameters of a liberal
arts curriculum.
Granted, there is a class inaccounting offered by the economics department, as
well as many courses in theeducation department which combine practical and
theoretical applications of knowledge. Yet the existence of such opportunities
indicatethe lack of similar options in other parts of theCollege'sprogram. Those
students interested in pursuing a career in law will find only one course, American
Constitutional Law, which directlyrelates to the subject matter they will encounter in law school. Although the study of English literature is certainly a worthwhile pursuit, there is little opportunity to explore other types of writing of which
an English major might be expected to have some knowledge.
Journalistic writing, for example, has only appeared in thecurriculum offering
once, as a student-runcourse which was offered in theSpring 1995 semester. The
College did grant the right for this course to exist, but only under the purview of
a faculty advisor. This indicates that, at least in theory, the College was willing
to meet the interestedstudents half-way in theircommitment to studying journalism. Yet the first part of thetitle "faculty advisor" is indeed "faculty," even though
there were—and still are—no faculty members who claim journalism as a field
of expertise. Non-faculty members within the College community who do have
such experience, however, were not allowed to occupy the position of advisor.
The advisor who was selected did help class members with elements of writing
style, and helped to coordinate visits by journalists from the "outside world."Yet
the College itself was not willing to commit resources to attracting someone who
would perpetuate this experience beyond a single semester.
In the case ofAssistant DeanFernando Chang-Muy's course this semester on
humanrights, international law, and refugees, the Collegeshowed its willingness
to allow a non-faculty member to teach a course. Yet he had to revise his syllabus
on multiple occasions because it apparently did not contain enough emphasis
upon theoretical knowledge. Chang-Muy seems to have achieved a happy
balance, though, between teaching about the underpinnings of human rights
theories and the procedure for filing complaints about actual human rights
violations.
This approach shows that a balance between the "practical" and the "academic"
can and should be achieved. Although students are not knocking down the
Registrar's door to beg for more opportunities for career-oriented work, they
might be more inclined to do so if theCollege's policy were more comprehensive
in this regard.

Words are strange things.They "re powerful; the words we hear shape us, and

I don't think that behavior greatly
helped my popularity. A few people listened, but most just said, "What, are you
a fag?"
Then I came to Swarthmore, land of
the liberal and enlightened. The word
"fag" isn't used as an insult anymore—for the most part. It's rarely used at all,
and when it is, it's usuallyby queers. And
there's another one—"queer," a word
that was also generally used as an insult
in my high school. Here, it's used rather
casually, with no malice, to mean lesbian, gay, and bisexual. I use it all the
time myself, actually. The word "queer"
has been co-opted pretty effectively. It
no longer carries any negative connotations for me; "queer" has come to be a
positive word for a positive thing.
But I still don't feel that way about
"fag." Or "nigger." Or "spic."Why have
I reconciled myself to some words and
not to others?
At least part of it is that more people
have co-opted "queer." I became comfortable with it only because I heard
others using it with such ease. That's not

our own words shape the world.
Back in my hometown, theword "faggot" was pretty common. It was also
pretty powerful. It was more than an
insult; it was a weapon.
"You're too tired to play basketball?
What's your problem, are you a faggot?"
"No, no, I'm not a fag, I'll play."
I was amazed by the things that the
mere mention of that little word caused.
It was the worst thing you could be.
People could view you as anything—but
not that. The fear of being unmanly was
paralyzing. I don'tknow why the idea
was so frightening. It seems to me to be
a pretty silly thing to be frightened of. A
lotof Swat students and professors would
probably explain the fear as a social construct. Well, it's amazing what one ittybitty social construct can do.
I hated the word "fag." Every time I
heard it, I hated it, and I still do. To me,
the word represents everything painful
and hurtful and wrong. So I battled it
whereverI encountered it. I told people I

done as often with the other words.
They're used occasionally in jest,or perhaps in other ways by a few people, but
for the most part those words aren't said
at all.
But "queer" was never as loaded as
those other words, at least for me. It
wasn't used too often in my town, and
when it was, it didn'thave the oomph that
"fag" did.You couldn't get a freshman to
bungee jump off a cliff by calling him
queer, but you probably could if you
called him a fag.
So maybe "queer" could be co-opted
because it wasn't thatpowerful to begin
with. Maybe we should be happy that
we've made one word ofhate into a word
ofpeace and stop there, and just try to get
people to stop saying "fag," "nigger,"

"spic," and all the other lovely hateful
words the English language has to offer.
But if we never use those words, we're

just adding to their power. You only run
from that which threatens you, and if we
run from words, it shows that we're threatened by them.
At the same time, though, we must

admit that they

are

threatening. These

words have hundreds of years of hatred

packed into them, and they are powerful.
They can make people hurt and kill and
fear and feel shame. Perhaps by trying to
empower them, we merely perpetuate the
hatred they carry. I don'tknow ifwe have
the power to wipe all that hatred away
and make these terms nice ol' happy
words. Idon'tknow if we have the power
to forget every time those words have
been said with disgust.
We can't forget. It's not even an option. We couldn't if we tried. The past is
here, and it's part of the present. And so
are these words. This stuff isn't going
away. We've got to deal with it. I don't
pretend to have a solution.But I will say
this: these words can only be used to
demean us as long as we allow them to.
"No onecan make you feel inferior without your permission," someone once told
me. And it's true.
Ifwe'regoing to "deconstruct," if we're
going to "empower," if we're going to
"reappropriate," we have tostart the process within our own hearts and minds. It
is not a matter of academic theory to be
left to the sociologists. Itis very personal
and very real—and never easy.
Watch your words.

Response to Schwartz: Don't Romanticize Capitalism
By

Chuck Stevens

Taking a course about rationality last

taught your columnist, among
other things, that there are many widely
varying notions of ethics in the world,
some of which he finds less than palatable. Reading (and editing) Brian
Schwartz's column about rational behavior in the January 26 Phoenix reminded him of some of the notions that
he particularly relished bashing, specifically utilitarianismand the notion of "rationalself-interest."Mr. Schwartz's tastes
run more toward Objectivist fare than
utilitarian, true, but his support of the
notionof best serving the worldby serving oneself recommends him to your
columnist's attention: disparaging altruistic behavior as a "sacrificial relationship" ignores the necessity of said behaviorboth for moral growth and for a functional society. In taking the essential
good-heartedness of capitalist relations
as a premise for his argument, Mr.
Schwartz assumes what he sets out to
prove, undermining his claims, and
chooses some peculiar definitionsto make
his points.
Altruism, as most people know it, involves sacrificing an immediatepersonal
goal for the welfare ofothers.The classic
example is life-endangering action—
I people who dash into burning buildings
to fmd children, mother birds that make
sounds to attract predators to themselves
(and keep them away from the nest),
prisoners who refuse to betray their
friends or confederates—although risks
to one's financial and social status for
others should also be considered. Mr.
Schwartz's exaggeratedregard for capitalism leaves your columnist wondering
what,precisely, Mr. Schwartz must think
of such actions: as they have no basis in
the free market, and as, more often than
not, they impede rather than advance
one's interests, they clearly have no place
in his scheme. Mr. Schwartz endorses
"benevolence" on grounds that "most
people do have values to offer," a
tremblingly reductionist approach that
disregards the inherent worth of people

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS
To the editor:
I am intrigued by the new editorial
policy ofThe Phoenix. The editors state
that they "will no longer list the names of
editors who support our editorials" because while "the institution's voice must
be expressed through the work of individuals, this voiceis not merely the voice
of a large number of specific individuals."
Just what does the concept
"institution's voice" refer to in reality?
The term is metaphorical, and implies
that an institution has not only a voice,
but some sort of "collective consciousness," or set of values. Is this institution
alive? I thought that only individualshad
the capacity to think and voicetheir own
views. Am I naive in thinking this way?
The new editorial policy continues:
"While editorials will not necessarily
reflect the views of any individual staff
member, they do (and should) reflect
views with which the staff as a whole is
not at odds." I take the above to mean
that nobody on The Phoenix staff will
agree with the main idea of future
editorials—nor will they disagree.
How can this be? Assuming the statements in the editorials are semantically
sound, i.e., they have meaning, then in
order for a contributor to neither agree
nor disagree with them, he must hold no
opinions. The other possibility is that the
writers do have opinions, but they do not
write them, and instead write editorials
containing absolutely meaningless combinations of words that make no claim
about reality.

I wouldlike the editors to answer these
questions, preferably insigned missives.
I would think they would not agree with
anything they write in an unsigned reply
to this letter. Or wouid they?

Will Swarthmore Maintain Its Commitment To Need-Blind Financial Aid?
By

Student Council

The current crisis of student financial
aid is the most serious issue to confront
students since the draft. Tuition at colleges and universities has been increasing at twice the rate of inflation, and is
expected to increase at a similarrate this
year. As tuition soars and federal aid
dwindles, a growing proportion of students must rely on loans to pay for college.

Based on present trends, it is estimated
thatstudentborrowing, having tripled in
the past decade alone, will double in the
next five years to $5O billion in the year
2000.
Nevertheless, there is now a proposal
in Congress to cut the federal student aid
program almost in half. That program
accounts for 74 percent of the financial
aid now available to help studentspay for
college.
Such a move, if it were to happen,
would have a profound effect on the
ability ofmillions of students to pay for
college, and might well fundamentally

alter the character and missionofinstitutions like Swarthmore.
Derided as "apathetic" and dubbed
"X," this generation is living down to the
reputation given it by its elders—but
national policy, controlled by that same
older generation, has played a part In
1949 the federal government spent more

money in present dollars on one financial
aid program, the G.I. Bill, thanit spent in
1993 on the Peace Corps, VISTA, student loans, and federal scholarship aid
combined.
Federal aid has not just shrunk in recent years; ithas qualitatively changed as
well.As recently as the 19705,two-thirds
of all federal aid came in the form of
outright grants, on the theory that education was a socially beneficial investment.
Today, more than two-thirds of all aid
comes in the form ofloans. Educating the
present generation of young people is
evidently not a social priority.
The social contract that assumes the
older generation will provide for the education of the younger has been abandoned—in an era in which, over the past
decade and a half, the income of noncollege graduates has fallen 30 percent.
Collegestudents now must, increasingly,
take responsibility for the costs of their
educations.
As the president of the American
Council on Education reported to U.S.
News <fe World Report lastyear, "the shift
in emphasis of federal student aid from
grants to loans threatens to create a generation of debtors." The average loan
debtrose from $6,488 in 1985 to $ 16,417
in 1991,and it has continued to grow for
the last five years.

Bill Clinton's Speech:
Political Maneuvering
for Moderates' Votes
By

Neena Shenai

On Tuesday, January 23, an embattled President Clinton
entered the Congressional Chamber; the day had seen Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the first lady, subpoenaed to appear before a
grand jury to testify about her Whitewater involvement He
may well havebeen worried about the affair's possible effects
on his presidential campaign.
Facing a hostile majority and also a supportive cheering
section, the President began the State of the Unionaddress. He
first extended thanks to the American troops in Bosnia. Given
the relative uncertainty of the Bosnian situation at the time,
beginning in this manner was a gutsy move. Once again,
Clinton was trying to sellhis decision to the American people.
He also spoke of the current Americaneconomy as the "healthiest in three decades." I don'tbelieve this is the case; there have
been many recent reports of a possible recession in the near
future. Basically, the President's statement was just propa-

The road to opportunity

ganda.

Clintonmoved far to the right in discussing the down-sizing
of the federal government, usually a strictly Republican position. He thensaid thatwith less government, individuals could
be more successful and the country could prosper. It's odd that
the President would make such a comment; possibly he made
it just to please the Republican legislative majority. On the
other hand, where does this philosophy leave his colleagues on
the left? When congressional Democrats are desperately fighting to maneuver government into more portions of our lives,
Clinton will have to choose between doing the right thing,
which he has promised, or keeping allegiance with his party.
In the main body of his speech. President Clinton stressed
"teamwork," stressing his continuing willingness to work with
the Republicans-clearly an election year strategy.
President Clinton stated that he would sign a bill that would
not undermine our social programs such as "Medicare, Medicaid, education, or theenvironment." By making this injection,
the President suggested thatthe Republicans do not care about
these issues. Note that balancing the budget was a part of the
Contract with America and that the Republicans have pushed
for a balanced budget amendment. The Republicans have
offered bill after bill to balance the budget in seven years, yet
thePresident wants to take the credit for the program. Depending on your media source, you have probably heard a variety
of Clintonproposals, projected for seven to twelve years, for
balancing the budget. He says that his main goal is to work
together, but herefuses to sign thebills simply because they are
Republican-sponsored. The President concluded his remarks
on the budget with "When we work together, we never fail."
Sounds cheesy, but it's what America wants to hear.
The President then moved on to stress strengthening families by endorsing tough welfare reform and calling on fathers
to pay child support. Both these plans are excellent. Need I
mention their conservative origins?
Next, the President presented his goals for the American
educational system. He explicitly called on schools to teach
"good values," also a long-standing Republican idea. The
highlight of the educational proposals was the $l,OOO merit
scholarship to the top five percent of every high school graduating class. But we never heard from where the money was
going to come. In the "effort" to make government smaller, the
President is using thepretense of the cuts (if any) to spend more
money. Under the "economic security" section of the speech,
Clinton once again spoke of a large scale spending measure, GI
Bill for America's Workers. It wouldprovide $2,600 to be used
by the unemployed or under-skilled for higher education. I
must ask again: where is the money coming from?
Next, Clinton outlined his crime policy. Some appealing
prospects include involving the FBI in stopping gangs in inner
cities. He compared this "war" on gangs to that against theMob
in the 19305. For government housing areas, the President
hopes to implement "one strike and you're out" policies for
those who commit crimes or peddle drugs. Both policies will
be beneficialfor the country, and the President deserves credit
for backing them.
President Clinton challenged Washington once again to "be
smaller and less bureaucratic," again affirming the shift to the
right The next challenge will be campaign finance reform,
also from the Contract with America. Both parties will benefit
from passing this bill, as it has broad bipartisan support.
Citing Richard Dean, a rescuer from the Oklahoma City
bombing, as an American hero was, believe it or not, a furtive
political move. Dean is certainly a hero for putting his own life
in jeopardy in order to save the lives of others. However, he
also works for the Social Security Office in OklahomaCity and
worked unpaid during the December government shutdown.
Mr. Dean's example was used to blame the Republicans for
supposedly causing the shutdown.
President Clinton concludedhis speechby again emphasizing cooperation, but he failed to elaborate further on any
details. We should thereforebe cautious about his new agenda,
since we cannot genuinely assess the viability of the new
programs until we examine the logistics. Many proposals that
sound effective in theory are not as successful in practice.
The finalramifications of Clinton's shift to theright remain
unclear. He may be hoping to gain the votes of moderates in
November, but this shift could cost him votes on the left. The
unfolding of the Whitewater and Travelgate episodes may yet
prove a stumbling block to a president still struggling to win
the public's trust. Campaign '96 will be a long, difficult
journey for all the candidates, and the State of the Union
address has commenced the struggle.

John Freeman

In

many ways, the Whitney Mu
seum of American Art has cap
hired the spirit of being Beat. Its
exhibition "BeatCulture and theNew
America, 1950-1965" presents its
visions of what is and was Beat in art
in the same way Jack Kerouac pursued the West on foot and through
blues poetry—spontaneous, idealistic and iconoclastic. Like Keroauc,

the Whitney shuns rigid divisions
between art and artifact, high art and
low art, and ultimately brandishes its
brilliantly eclectic celebration ofthis
highly contested era in culture.
The question of defining the Beat
Generation has been haggled over by
scholars. In his wildly successful
novel, On the Road, Jack Kerouac
describes his generation as "BEAT—the root, the soul of beatific," as well
as beaten down. One year ago when
poet Allen Ginsberg visited the
Swarthmore campus he affirmed this,
saying Kerouac came up with the
idea of Beat meaning both beaten
down by society, and by oppressive
globalization of consumer culture,
and yet also beat in the sense of
beatitude—full of beauty.
A beauty which many art critics
have found contestable. Do paintings
by writers and poems by painters
constitute great art? Where should an
exhibit draw the line between art and
artifact? How does an exhibit define
which artists are outside its focus—theme? nationality? influence on
majorartists? All these questions and
t'rfcre are relevant to this show.
Rather than try to control its schizophrenia, this exhibit seems to revel in
it. The exhibit brings together over
200 objects in a medium, painting,
sculpture, film, installation, audio
recordings ofmusic and poetry, and a
variety of manuscripts and illustrated
journals to give a real feel for the
living creation of these artists. One
object surrounded by legend and myth
is the enormous teletype roll ofpaper
on which Kerouac wrote Onthe Road
during a three week benzedrine binge.
Everything imaginable can be
found here; as organizer and curator
Lisa Phillips says, "Neo-Dada art,
Abstract Expressionism, American
independent film, California Assemblage, Fluxus, and Happenings.... Art
and life were inseparable, which
brought a new kind of realism to art,
and a new type of freedom and self
expression to living." This intermingling of art and artifact allows the
exhibit to explore the ways in which
modern American culture has been
forged by the convergence of social,
intellectual, and spiritual forces.
Some parts of this exhibition are
nihilistic and depressing. In addition
torebellion for its own sake, the Beats
targeted militarism, blatant
McCarthyism, and the complacent
affluence of the post-nuclear
Eisenhower era. Collages by Corso
and William S. Burroughs point to
unnoticed suffering in the world, and
the persistence of death and famine
while America puffed up its global
chest to Communism.
Yet given beat literature's crosspolinization with Buddhism, these
collages and murals reveal the central aspect of Beatness —suffering.
And they uncover suffering as a way
to remind viewers of their humanity.

Charles Brittin's photo "Stone Brothers Printing with Wallace
Berman in Window," 1957, is from the artist's private collection
and currently part of the "Beat Culture and the New America:
1950-1965" exhibit at New York City's Whitney Museum of
American Art. The exhibit runs till February 4.
Ginsberg's poem "Howl" is a testament to this suffering: "I saw the best
minds ofmy generation destroyed by
madness, starving hysterical naked."
The Beats also celebrated the marginsof American culture, embracing
African-American culture, the poor
and homeless, and Eastern philosophy to infuse America with a new
vibrancy. In On the Road, Kerouac
lives for several months with an iunerant family of field workers. While
the rest of the country fought to ignore America's diversity, in many
ways the Beats celebrated it.
Many critics of beat literature point
to the comfortable white middle class
backgrounds of the Beats as a way to
discount their subversive acts as the
growingpangs of late-blooming ado-

lescents. And in many ways their
university educations and reverence
for art and literature made it hard for
them to remain bohemians. Today
Ginsbergand Kerouac have been featured in GAP ads, Burroughs has
done Nike advertisements, and the
pop culture machine has churned out
an image of an era ofhipsters in black
turtlenecks gussling espresso to the
tune of Charlie Parker solos.
But like the 60s, the 50s have suffered from a revisionist trend which
alternately accepts and rejects
America's prodigal offspring. History submerged these voices over
time, painting the portrait of a Ward
Cleaver era in the electronic consciousness of thosewho weren't there
and those who were. Life magazine
often described them as hoodlums or
"hairy irreverent" pranksters. Yet
Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Gregory

Corso (the holy trinity of beatness)
developed a huge audience through
their cultural transgressions. Like the
famous SDS movement of the mid60s, Beats were "born and bred in
modestcomfort" looking uncomfortably at the world they had inherited.
Today commodification ofthe Beat
image has traveled so far and wide
that this exhibit suffers from its
shadow. The Beats would certainly
find it ironic and unfortunate that
stores like Urban Outfittersappropriate the image of poverty by marketing deliberately beat-up blue collar
work clothes to be sold at designer
prices. For if there is anything worth
gleaning from Beat art and literature
it ought not be a hip image, but perhaps its energetic explosion of illusionand image for the truth, the madness, the suffering, and also the transcendental beauty which lay in humanity.
Unfortunately, this weekend will
be the Beat exhibit's last. For the
price of a few Renato's pizzas or an
extra book from the bookstore, you

can hitch the train to New York and

revel in the multitudeofpassing faces,
street vendors, and wind whipping
around and between ghostbuster like

Cure for Swat Stress
By

Climbing

the hill towards
Tarble around 11:00 last Sat
urday night.lcouldhear some
sort of deafening, but indubitably
funky, rumbling emanating from
within. I had no idea whether the
source of this noise was an overloaded PA system or the sound of
1300 groove-things being shaken simultaneously. In either case, Tarble
sounded crowded, more crowded than
any Swat occasion in recent memory.
I stepped through the doors of
Tarble and discovered that the ceiling above me, the floor of Upper
Tarble, was shaking, bouncing up
and down to a good, old-fashioned
funk beat. People were everywhere:
Swatties, Martyrs, Haverfordians,
under-age Ville Rats, and a small
clump of drunken and rather over-

whelmed Villanovans. The crowd
was enormous, the heat intense.
Dr. Booty was in full swing ripping
through an old R&B chestnut with
ease. The pace was fast, the rhythm
tight, the playing flashy, and the vocals right-on. That first song was a
tough act to follow, but the good
doctor managed to keep it up until
2:00 a.m. taking only one forty-five

minute break after midnight.
Dusty Springfield, Wilson Pickett,
and James Brown were chewed up
and spit out, and the band sounded
damn good with the help of master
sound engineer NickKourticles. The
audience danced and shouted and
clapped and cheered. With the rest of
them, I stumbled home, soaking wet
and grinning. Following the first week
of the semester, Dr. Booty was a
perfect tonic: sweet, soulful, and
funky—just what this school needs

more of. Thanks to the members of
Dr. Booty for sharing their prescription with the rest of us.

By Thanh Hoang

"The most interesting study
break I've attended was hosted
by Kendra Liddicoat '99 and
Lyndy Yankaskas '99. It was
organized around the theme of
a camp fire. They started a fire
in the fire place (which caused
a small problem because the
dampers weren't open and so
the room filled with smoke).
But the most interesting thing
was that we sang girl scout
songs, and Kendra and Lyndy
brought snacks that could be
arranged to resemble a campfire (specifically pretzels, representing logs, and M&M's,
representing stones, and red
gumdrops as smoldering embers). It was very creative."

—Jason Albright '99
"It was my freshman year
and we didn't even know what
the purity test was. So we
showed up at a study breakand
they had donuts and popsicles.
We were eating the food when
they handed out the test, and
then we realized that the donuts and popsicles had specific
meanings, obviously. A bunch
of us were gnawing on the
popsicles. We looked at the

questions, and we looked at the
popsicles, we looked at each

other and we all said,
'Eeeewww!!!! YUCK!' and
threw away the popsicles. It
was really silly and funny because we hadn't known what
was going on. Of course the
guys reached for more donuts
anyway!"
—Michelle Maraffi '97

Men's B-ball defeated by Haverford
By David

Lischer

With two important Centennial Conference losses this week, the playoff aspirations of the men's basketball team
have dimmed. The losses to Gettysburg
and Haverford drop the Garnet's record
to 2-6 in the conference and 6-12 overall.
If the Garnet were to win its last five
conference games to finish with a 7-6
record, it could theoretically squeak into
the playoffs, but the chances are slim.
But the season isn't over in anyone's
eyes. "If you play basketballfor theright
reasons, you simply love the game.We
have to try to win the rest of our league
games and see where the chips fall," said
Coach Lee Wimberly.
Tim Schofield '99 added a player's
perspective, "Honestly, that glimmering
hope of the playoffs and team pride will
keep us going. I know this team doesn't
have quit in its character."
The two losses provide a remarkable
contrast and reveal a bewildering trend
that lacks an adequate explanation.
Against Gettysburg, the Garnet played
on the same level as it played in its
convincing victories over Western Maryland and Philadelphia Pharmacy theweek
before.
With great passing and its domination
of the boards, Swarthmore jumped to an
early lead, whichreached as many as 14
points, but wilted later in the game, losing in overtime 88-81.
However, against Haverford, the Garnet shooters hit a cold streak, and were
unable to break SO points, losing 54-44.
There is no satisfying explanation for
thestreakiness ofSwarthmore's shooters
this season. Ondefenseand on theboards,

Swarthmoreand Haverfordboth played
a miserable first half, and although the
Fords led 22-21 at halftime, both teams
couldbe thankful the other had not taken

teams remained cold from the perimeter,
and the game was decided on the inside.
Haverford was able to convert its easy
baskets while the Garnet found themselves missing their easy putbacks.
Because of the Haverford pressure on
inbound plays, the Garnet expected to be
able to take advantage of the overextended Ford defenders and create easy
baskets. Yet it proved difficult to move
theball upcourt and theFord defense was
very stingy and prevented the Garnet
from exploiting its weakness inside.
Against Gettysburg, Swarthmore hit

on 46% of its first half shot attempts. A
strong Bullet counterattack with just over
two minutes left in the half whittled the
Garnet lead from seven to two as the
teams headed into the locker rooms. At
the start of the second half, an interesting

dynamic evolvedbetween brothers Terry
and Tim Schofield.
Gettysburg's Terry Schofield tied the
game at 31 and then answered a Colin
Convey '97 three-pointer toretie the game
at 34. His teammates then took advantage of a steal and a Garnet turnover to
seize a 40-34 lead. Swarthmore's Tim
Schofield '99 soon quieted the Bullet
streak by netting his first of three threepointers in the game. Not to be outdone,
Terryreplied with a basket of his own to
stretch Bullet lead to five. Tim quickly
answered backwith another three-pointer
to cut the lead to two points.
"It was kind of strange [to play against
Terry]. There was a lot of trash talking in
the months leading up to the game, but
we had a phone conversation the week
before where we basically agreed to have
fun on the court and treat it like every
other game," said Schofield. Tim finished with 11 points, three rebounds, and
two steals while brother Terry scored 13
points and grabbed five rebounds.
With sixteen seconds left in the
Gettysburg game,the game tiedat 77, the
Garnet had possession of the ball. Convey was unable to get off a shot and the
teams were forced to play a five minute
overtime.
The Bullets elevated theirlevel ofplay,
and the Garnet could not keep up. Garnet
shooters managed to take seven threepoint shots but didn't connect on any of
them. The Bullets ate up the clock effectively and clinched the victory on free
throws.

Students come to Swarthmore as students first, athletes second. Athletes do
not come here with dreams of playing
professional sports; if a player hopes to
get noticed by a pro team, he goes to a
Division I school, where heis much more
likely to get nationalcoverage while possibly earning a scholarship for his athletic endeavors. Each year, out of the
hundredsof college football, soccer, basketball, baseball, and hockeyplayers that
go on to play professional sports, only a
tiny fraction of those went to a Division
HI school.
That is why it is so surprising when a
Swarthmore player gets noticed by a pro
team. This is what has happened to Len
Cuello '96. Cuello has been invited to try
out with a professional soccer team. The
Philadelphia Kixx, a fledgling team slated
to compete in the National Professional
Soccer League (NPSL) starting this year,
has asked Cuello to attend their summer
tryouts.

The NPSL is currently the premiere
U.S. soccer league. The Kixx join the
TorontoShooting Stars as expansion franchises for the 1996-1997 season.
Cuello had a stellar career at Swarthmore, leading the team in scoring his
junioryear after not even making varsity
as a freshman. Although he broke his
fibulaand tibia in an October gameagainst
Franklin and Marshall and had to sit out
the final seven gamesof the season, Cuello
still was one of the top scorers on the
team. "[Cuello] really developed in college," said teammate Dave Lane '97.
The Kixx are attempting to fill much

of their roster with local soccer players.
Select college players from Villanova, St
John's, Haverford, and Rowan have also
been asked to tryout for the Kixx. "We
definitely wanta local flavor," saidDavid
Jones, general manager for the Kixx.
"We want to give the local players a
shot... Since we are starting out a brand
new team, this is an excellent opportu-

nity for many players to make theirmark."
Though the schedule has not yet been
set, the Kixx will play at the CoreStates
Spectrum, and will play a 40 game season against teams like the Cleveland
Crunch, the Harrisburg Heat, and the
Chicago Power starting in November.
Cuello, however, downplayed thepossibilities. "This is really still in theroughest stages ofthe rough," he said. "I think
people are getting a little too excited. It is
a little premature for me to go on talking
about a pro career when I don't know
whether they want me, or I want them, or

In a tough game against Haverford
College on Wednesday night, the Swarth-

more Garnet Tide emerged victorious.
The first half was a seesaw of the two
teams matching each other'sbaskets and
never pulling ahead by more than one or
two baskets. Swarthmore was poised and
focused as they contained the Black Squirrels, and entered the locker room at halftime with only a one point deficit.
In the second half they turned their
game up a notch in an attempt to pull
ahead and sustain thelead.But the heavily
favored Fords kept time with
Swarthmore's fast pace and the game
remained a close one withthe win seemingly up for grabs.
As the game came to a close the intensity and heartof the Garnet Tide paid off
as they held a 5 point lead with only
minutes to play. The Squirrels hit a few

baskets at the very end but could not
overcome the Swat women who refused
to let down their guard. In last minute
desperation, Haverford was forced to foul
in an attempt to get back the ball, putting
Holly Barton '99 on theline severaltimes
where she managed to keep the gameout
of reach with her foul shots. As the clock
ran out, Haverford desperately threw up
some 3 -point shots but tono avail; S warthmore held fast to victory and ended with
the 53-48 win.
Swarthmore was led by Holly Barton,
who had 24 points, including three 3pointers; and 9 rebounds. Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 had 9 points and 9 rebounds and Michelle Walsh '9B and Pia
Houseal '97 each scored 8 points.
This gamewas an important milestone
for the Swarthmore GarnetTide, breaking their 8 game losing streak that had
been plaguing the team since their
Whittier College game on January 7. As

members had become more and
more displeased and coaches increasingly disappointed with each successive
loss, this game raised team spirits and
brought a new sense of hope and confidence to all participants.
In addition, the win proved to be a
major step in Swarthmore's drive to the
coveted Hood trophy. Before
Wednesday's games, Haverford hadbeen
ahead in the running with a 4-2 record,
but after the men's and women's recent
games, thecurrentrecordis4.s-2.s.There
is still another season of varsity competition before this trophy will be awarded to

to be

true."
It should be noted that he has been
offered no sort of contract, and that the
only contactbetween Cuello and the team
has been Cuello's invitation to tryouts.
Cuello has proven his aptitude on the
indoor circuit, as he was named the MVP
of the 1995 Elizabethtown Spring Indoor
Tournament
"Len is a hard worker and he definitely
has a chance [to make the team]. The
bottom line is going to be how he comes
back from his injury," noted Jones.
Indoor soccer plays by the same generalrules as outdoor, with a few changes.
There are walls instead of sidelines, and
throw-ins are therefore nonexistent Indoor soccer is played on smaller field and
artificial turf playing surface.The games
are played at a much faster pace, and are
typically higher scoring than in outdoor
soccer.

In the NPSL, there are other rules that
are similarto various sports. For instance,
like basketball, there is an over-and-back
rule and a team has ten seconds to bring
the ball past midfield. Like hockey, the
teams changeplayers on thefly andpower
plays are awarded after certain penalties.
The fast paced games should be to
Cuello's benefit."He's really quick, very
explosive as a player," said Lane. "His
ball handling skills are excellent—he can
take on defenders one-on-one and beat
them. Lenny was also a really good leader.
He's very passionate about the game."
"Len is a once in a blue moon player,"
said Don Norton, an assistant coach for
Swarthmore's men's soccer team.

The Super Bowl was Actually Pretty Good
By

Frank Amar

The eyes of the football world were
focused on Tempe, Arizona last Sunday
afternoon and evening as the world's
greatest sports spectacle, theSuper Bowl,
took place in the Valley of the Sun. And
after all the perfunctory interviews, self
promotions, and bold predictions were
made, the fans, the advertisers, and the
NFL got what it wanted most: a very
good football game.
If anything, last Sunday's Super Bowl
was what most of the so-called experts
said it wouldn't be—competitive. The
Dallas Cowboys, simultaneously the most
loved and hatedfootball team in America,
with its behemoth offensive line, frighteningly efficient offense, and lightning
quick defense, would be way too much
for the emotional, workmanlike, less than
spectacularPittsburgh Steelers. Well, the
experts were right—Dallas won, 27-17.
But it wasn't as easy as some people
expected it to be.
Super Bowl XXX was a tale of two
halves. In the first half, the Cowboy offense was efficient Whether it was to
Emmitt Smith on the ground, or to Jay
Novacek or Michael Irvin in the air, the
Cowboys kept the Steelers off balance.
Their front five of Mark Tuinei, Ron
Stone, Derek Kennard, Larry Allen, and
Erik Williams turned in their usual performance, allowing Troy Aikman to
throw with hardly any pressure.

The Steelers, on theother hand, looked
lost. Neil O'Donnell looked nervous
throughout the first half. It really wasn't
until late in the second quarter, when
O'Donnell capped a 13 play, 54-yard
drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to
Yancy Thigpen, did it seem that
O'Donnell had settled in.

And after all the perfunctory interviews,
selfpromotions, and
boldpredictions were
made, the fans, the
advertisers, and the
NFL got what it
wanted most: a very
goodfootball game.
The second half was a different story.
The Steelers completely outplayed the
Cowboys in the second half. The Pittsburgh running game, which critics
thought Bill Cowher should have abandoned for more 4 and 5 wide receiver
sets, finally began to click with the bull
rushes of Bam Morris. Coupled with
O'Donnell's precision passing and Dallas' sudden inability to move the foot-

ball, Pittsburgh had pulled to within three,

and itlooked like they had a good chance
of breaking the NFC's 11 year vise grip
on the Super Bowl.
But thedifference was turnovers. Pittsburgh made them, Dallas didn't And
when Pittsburgh made them, Dallas, like
a true champion, made them pay dearly.
Two Emmitt Smith touchdownruns followed Larry Brown (SuperBowl MVP)
interception returns, the secondof which
sealed the Steelers fate.
With their unprecedented third Super
Bowl win in four years, can the Cowboys
doit again? Who knows? They will probably lose several players to free agency,
but the core will remain intact It should
be interesting to see who the Cowboys
choose to resign and where the ones the
ydon't will end up.
As for the Steelers, theirbig concern is
Neil O'Donnell. He is a free agent (although until this year, some people
weren't sold on him) and the Jets are
rumored to be the front runer in the free
agent bidding.
Should he depart, I think this would
seriously retard their growth. Their offense made some impressive strides this
year, leading the AFC in scoring and
adding jack-of-all-tradesKordell "Slash"
Stewart, whose role might revolutionize
football. O'Donnell's back-ups, Mike
Tomczak, Pun Miller, and Stewart, aren't
going to bring this team back to theSuper
Bowl.

Once again, the Swarthmore Swim
Team boarded'"Da Johnson"last Saturday to travel to Carlisle, Pennsylvania to
take on Dickinson College. However,
Dickinson proved to be no threat to the
Swarthmore juggernaut, as our swimmers easily triumphed. Although a large
number of swimmers competed in events
which were not their specialties, many
still recorded exceptional times.
On the men's side, Mark Friedberg '9B

opened the meet with fantastic swims in
the 1000 Freestyle and 200 Freestyle,
respectively.
Carl "Peaches" Sanders '9B, Marco

respectively, in the 50 Freestyle. Ryan

Jenny Harvey had a good seaon, and with her best swim of the season
at the Hopkins meet, gave herself a shot to go to Nationals. She made the
B cut for nationals in the 200 Breasts troke. Harvey, who was apart of relay
teams that hold two school records, has been consistently improving this
year.
"Jenny's very dedicated and is always putting in extra time after
practise," noted team captain Maria Kaufman '96. Harvey's specialty is
the breaststroke, but she has been a solid contributer to the team in the
freestyle events, also. "She's having an awesome season,"noted teammate
Cathy Polinsky
