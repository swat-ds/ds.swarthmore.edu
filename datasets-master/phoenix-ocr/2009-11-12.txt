over 40 alumni,

The Networking Dinner, which start

ing skills and obtaining information,'
said Laura Sibson, the assistant director
of alumni relations for Career Services.
"This year we focused on inviting

learned some tricks of the trade. "The
first rule of journalism: if there's free

the news director for a radio station.

the more experienced alums would talk
about their own career paths and
achievements.
"I found the information that the

older alums provided to be very interesting and potentially inspiring to other
students, but that offered by younger
alumns to be more immediately applica-

The alumni talked about the different
ways the Swarthmore network helped
them after graduation. When physician
Roger Short '6O was applying to medical
school, there was an 80 percent chance
that a Swarthmore graduate would be in
the top 20 percent of his or her class at
medical school. The secretary at
University of Virgina looked at his recommendation letter and told him in a
Southern drawl, "Those are the most
impressive statistics we have ever seen."
"I got hired for my TV job by an
alum," White said. "I also got tickets to a
DNC [Democratic National Committee]
function in Denver last year thanks to

one."

T,he alums are

eager to help.

"The least I can do is come here, talk
to students, say something that can
jump-start them.
I encourage people
to think of cliches, such as this one: 'Life
is a journey,'" Wright said. "You don't
have to have your life mapped out.
Things get sorted out after Swat."
The dinner was popular among students, and Sibson said that this year it
was bigger than usual, with approximatley 100 students at the dinner. The most
crowded areas included the healthcare,
consulting and public policy tables.
Students find the conversations helpful and interesting.
"You can see that [the alumni] are not
just here for the food," said John
McMinn 'l3, a pre-med student who sat
at the healthcare table.
The conversations weren't limited to
career experiences.
"I've been married to the same
woman for 47 years. I met her here. They
don't call it a Quaker matchboxfor nothing," Short said.

'The Nation' publisher, alum, explores political art

Amidst all the ensuing turmoil, including a suggestion that sophomores did not
have the maturity to serve as editors of the
newspaper, one of his professors commended him on his work and taught him
an invaluable lesson. "It is the job of the
student newspaper to be a thorn in the side

Victor Navasky '54 is proud of the time
he spent as editor of The Nation, the
NationalBook Award he won for "Naming
Names" and the current post he holds as
the George Delacorte Professor of
Journalism at Columbia
Magazine
University. But he is most proud of being
included in David Horowitz's list of the 101
most dangerous academics in America, a
recognition that he wishes hadn't been left
out ofhis introduction.
Navasky, a humorous as well as dangerous academic, gave the annual McCabe
Memorial lecture on Monday night. His
talk, titled "The Art of Controversy, or

of the administration," he said.
"My topic this evening has a similar
function," Navasky said. Despite the perception that caricatures are gimmicky and
inconsequential, they have produced heated debateand public outcry at the personal
and global level. Navasky related an anecdote from his time as editor ofThe Nation.
Thirty-four
members
"of
what
[Navasky] thought was a staffof 32" signed
a petition to not publish a caricature by

vehement backlash.
Chenge Mahomva 1L a McCabe scholar,
described him in her introduction as 'a fel-

on top of the world as a woman with a
United States flag covering the act. People
cited the cartoon as sexist, asking why it
didn't depict the world as a man. But
Navasky held his line, stating, "You can't
take a vote on aesthetic matters." The car-

theories as to why seemingly inconsequential political caricatures often create such

low Swattie whose curiosity about the

toon has since been included in exhibits
chronicling political art.
How does this "seemingly inconsequential art form" make so many people
squirm? Navasky first turned to neuroscience to answer his question. Authorities
have suggested that the emotional right
brain is triggered by visual stimulus more
than by words. "When I heard neuroscientists explain
it reminds me of the old
spiritual about how the hip bone is connected to the thigh bone," he said. Navasky
is not swayed by psychology, in part
because it reminds him of his" fellow

good laugh have led to an extraordinary

Navasky both alarmed and amused his
readers during his early years as a
reporter for The Phoenix. During his sophomore year he shared the position of coeditor and wrote a story about the admin-

istration's open-door policy for malefemale visitation. Navasky also ran an
accompanying illustration dramatizing an
incident of an administrator walking in on
a couple in a locked room.

eager to be paid $125 an hour to walk
around with shaved patches on their head
to have their brain waves measured.
"The cause of the agitated discontent is
not so much in our right brain or in the
images themselves as in their context."
This shift in perspective led Navasky to
look at the messages of the cartoons as the
source of "agitated discontent."
For example, the Kissinger and world
cartoon alarmed his staff because it rein-

forces active male and passive female
stereotypes that already exist in our society. Yet this argument is undermined by the

fact that words fail to ignite the same
anger.
To account for this aspect of the car-

toon, Navasky posited that cartoons derive

their power from the "totemic power of

images."
"Maybe these heathens, these savages,
these cave painters were right after all," he
said, referring to idolatry of images. But he
found this theory ultimately unsatisfying

as well.
He looked back to the art form itself and
the unique opportunity it provides to link
the recognizable with the distorted, the
real with the myth. "It's like you were
framed for a crime you didn't commit," he
said. And even worse, it's difficult to
respond to the joke a caricature creates
with such instantaneous impact. "There's
no such thing as a cartoon to the editor," he
said.

"Always say finally when you have five
minutes to go. It puts the audience at ease,"
Navasky said as the lecture wound down.
He concluded by suggesting that despite
the debates and controversies they have

sparked, cartoons and caricatures are here
to stay.

The lecture assured Mahomva that her
initial perceptions of Navasky were correct. "He has a good way of mixing intelligent observations about the world with
humor," she said. Other students,
Swarthmore Borough community members, alumni, and campus community
members from Rebecca Chopp to Maurice
Eldridge '6l shared in the laughter.
Mahomva and the other McCabe scholars, whp receive the McCabe scholarship
for "ability, character, personality, leadership, and service to school and community," are responsible for the selection of the
speaker. The annual McCabe Memorial lecture brings to campus individuals selected
by the McCabe scholars for their distinguished careers. The McCabe scholars ate
dinner with Navasky before the lecture.
The scholars picked Navasky in part
because of the prevalence and importance
of caricature in the 2008 presidential elections. The lecture also held more personal
relevance for Mahomva. A native of South
Africa, she has noticed that as democracy
has grown there so has the amount of caricature. "In South Africa, caricature is
becoming really popular. It was really nice
to hear an American perspective."
Other McCabe scholars enjoyed their
choice. "A lot of the older alums are more
conservative," said Emily Bryant 'l2, a
McCabe scholar. "He offers a fresh viewpoint."
Finally, Maddie Williams 'l2, also a
McCabe scholar, echoed this perspective.
"I thought he was really human

Alum supports abortion option, even in a Utopia
BY MINH-DUYEN NGUYEN
mnguyen4@swarthmore.edu

Adrienne Asche '69 began her
lecture "Will We Need Abortion
in Utopia?" this Monday with a
few forewarnings and caveats
that showed a recognition of the
sensitive nature of abortion.
"You can see how divisive the
issue can be," Asche said. "I
understand why a lot of prochoice people don't want to give
any ground at all to the enemy
the opposition
that might be
given by having certain conversations. . But since I'm in the
realm of philosophy and ethics
and not exclusively ki the realm
of policy, I may be able to say
things that cannot be said politically. I think that politics would
thrive better from more openness and more conversation and
not hiding things."

Asche studies the social, political, ethical, and psychological
ramifications of human reproduction and the family. She
received her doctorate in social
psychology
from Columbia
University. Within her policy
work, Asche participated in the
Board of the American Society
for Bioethics & Humanities, the
Clinton Task Force on Health
Care Reform, and the Ethical,
Legal,
Social Implications
&

Policy Planning Group of the
National
Human
Genome
Research Institute. Among other
works, she is a board member of
the Society of Jewish Ethics and
THE PHOENIX

the American Civil Liberties
Union, a fellow at the Hastings
Center and a member of the New
York State Task Force on Life
and the Law.
Taking a unique angle on
abortion, Asche frames all of her
arguments in a Utopian world. In
talking of her Utopia, Asche
described a world free of sexual
inequality, but further asserts
that even in such conditions,
abortion is necessary.
"Even in a world where
coerced sex was rare, where
women did not face economic
discrimination where employers structured their expectations
in line with familial responsibilities, where women and men took
on equal share of those responsibilities, we would need birth control and abortion," Asche said.
Chloe Browne 'l2 expressed
her views on the effectiveness of
Asche's Utopian framework and
the reasons why she thinks this
framework is necessary.
"By setting her story in this
place where gender inequality
doesn't exist and where child
support isn't needed and where
violent inter-gender relationships aren't a problem, she
helped us look at why abortion
isn't just a women's issue, but
why abortion is humanity's
issue," Browne said.
Asche also spoke about a few
arguments that dominate prochoice arguments. She argued
that the pro-choice argument
that references fetuses as
...

"clumps of cells" with no moral
status doesn't solve any prob-

lems.
"I actually think that it would
be very good for supporters and
opponents to agree that a fetus
implanted in a woman's body is a
genetically different entity from
the woman who gestates it,"
Asche said. "It has the potential
for a separate biological and
social life. It doesn't have that
while implanted. This is a comment that says I think we shouldn't be talking about fetuses or
even embryos as clumps of
cells."

Furthermore, she contended
that arguments that a woman's
child-bearing role has delegated
her to an inferior role in society
is not enough to justify abortion.
"Abortion is not merely a
remedy for social reconstructive
gender inequalities," Asche said.
"It allows people to maintain
deeply felt attitudes toward sexual relationships, parenthood, and
familial obligations. And for that
reason, even in a world without

sex discriminations and even
with vastly improved societal
arrangements for children with
adults, I think we need abortion
even in a social Utopia that we
don't have."
Josh Glickenhaus 'l2, a philosophy major attending the lecture, said he was in agreement
with Asche on both her views
regarding abortion and her
rationale behind it.
"In general, I agree with the

November 12, 2009

point

making,"
she was
Glickenhaus said. "I thought it
was an interesting argument
that I hadn't heard articulated
before in terms of the need to
consent to be a biological parent
that it is the right of adults to
consent to parenthood even more
so than it is the right of the
unborn fetus to be born."
In order to frame her argument, Asche discussed three
claims that she said must be
accepted to accept her argument
for abortion.
Browne saw these three interdependent claims as a way of
helping her to understand a new
rationale behind Asche's prochoice arguments.
First, Asche spoke about how
not all sexual relationships need
to have pro-creative intent. Often
people engage in sexual activities for reasons other than procreation
"for fun, or for affection, or for comfort, for all sorts
of reasons," Asche said.
Next, Asche discussed how
both biologically and socially
coerced parenthood are harmful
socially and psychologically. She
explained that biological parenthood implies the necessity of a
genetic rather than a social relationship between parent and
child.
"The cultural significance of
parenthood is the very thing that
makes the prospect of having a
child that one does not desire so
psychologically distressing and
socially offensive," Asche said.

"So rather, as some abortion
opponents would say, abortion
makes parenthood a less significant occurrence or demeans the
parent-child or mother-child
relationship, a lot of people
would say that abortion protects
the significance of voluntary parenthood."
To conclude, Asche argued
that there are social and legal
limits to society's expectations of
what parents must do for their
children.
"Even when an adult consents
to become a parent, there are
moral and legal limits to what we
expect parents to do for already
born children," Asche said. "We
should not demand that one sex
makes sacrifices of their body to
gestate new life, if we don't
demand that both sexes make
comparable sacrifices, donating
their blood for example, to meet
the needs of the children whom
they already have a relationship
with."
The lecture affected many on
a personal level. Glickenhaus
spoke of the benefits of the lecture for himself, more as a person than a philosophy major.
"It was beneficial to me as a
person because I have a greater
arsenal in order to argue on the
issue, I have a fuller picture on
the issue," Glickenhaus said. "I
am pro-choice. That's justkind of
how I was raised. That's the
background I came from. Now I
feel like have a better rationale
behind that."

New initiative to address racism in Phila. schools
For the first two years of its existence,
White Women Confronting Racism concentrated its efforts on discussing the
feelings of privilege and guilt that white
females may experience when considering racism. Now they are moving to take
action against oppression by establishing
a workshop for white women who work
as teachers in Philadelphia.
Tentatively called the Michelle Fine
Anti-Racist Teachers Workshop, the project aims to "provide a space for white
teachers to critically reflect on how
racism functions in their classrooms and
schools, as well as build an analysis of
the role of the educational system in
reproducing power structures based in
white supremacy," according to its mission statement.
The workshop will not take place until
the spring semester and is still in its
planning stages, but the members of the
group have clear ideas about what they
hope to achieve.
"We have a long way to go in getting
all the logistical details determined, such
as space and transportation," Mai
Schwartz 'lO said.
As group members continue to develop their plans, the group is open to help
from any interested Swarthmore students, especially suggestions about
potential contacts, models they can follow and examples of similar efforts.
Training will be provided for those

who want to run the workshops. There is
no educational background required, and
students should feel welcome to contribute even if they do not want to be
workshop leaders. Though students from
all backgrounds are invited to contribute, the group wants only white
women to run the workshops in the interest of creating a comfortable environment for the

said.
The most important tool they can
impart to the teachers, according to Apt,
is a sense of "critical awareness" of
racism, which is a "personal, institutional and cultural" problem. They will discuss and consider how to respond to bigoted comments, the fairness of testing for

"Having the group be open to women
only allows the group members to analyze racism not just as white people, but
as white women who have specific rela-

such as a relationship to racism's role in

co-ed groups, men tend to dominate the
conversation," Warrington said. The
group has sponsored events that are open
to white men as well.
The group is currently in the process
of forming partnerships with other
groups that focus on issues of race and

the book series, which contributed to
their desire to found the team. The idea
for the team first came up for them
while participating in an online chat
with fellow accepted students before
school began in the fall. Then O'Bryan
began talking about it in her cross
country practice and decided to take the
first step in forming the team with
Barber, her roommate, when no one
else took the intiative. She also discovered that Maldonado was on a
Quidditch team in high school, which
gave her and Barber help in setting up
the team.
"I think this stems from my desire to
be Harry Potter," Barber said.
Many prospective team members
were also interested in the team due to
their love of the book series.
"I think I'm interested in the

Quidditch team for the same reason we
all are: to actualize our childhood

of the Bell Tower and the mascot) and
playing the most magical sport ever

hope we get serious enough that we

Motion and moonwalk await in Saturday concert
BY CAMILA RYDER
cryderl@swarthmore. edu

With a talented group of

original members and 15 "newbies," Rhythm N' Motion's
upcoming concert on Saturday,
Nov. 14 will be a high-energy

mixture of African-influenced
dance styles and fresh perspectives on modern dance.
Rhythm N' Motion, or RnM,
is a Swarthmore dance company that hopes to, as said in
statement,
their
online
"increase campus awareness of
contemporary genres of dance
within the African Diaspora
such as hip-hop, jazz and dancehall." With a concert each
semester, student dancers have
the opportunity to showcase
both their choreographing
skills and dance moves. While
most of the concerts do not
have a theme, in 2005 there was
a charity show for Hurricane
Katrina and this year's show
will be a tribute to Michael

Jackson.

"He was a great dancer and
choreographer and he has all
these relations to what our

THE PHOENIX

theme is," Tanya Rosenblut 'l2,
co-director of RnM's executive
committee, said, "We definitely
want to give some respect to
him and tribute it [to him]."
Taleah Kennedy 'lO, who has
been in RnM since her freshman year, choreographed one
of the three Michael Jackson
pieces in the show. "As dancers,
we really felt his influence in
our everyday lives," Kennedy
said. "We want to make sure
this concert is really focused on
Michael Jackson and his influence on the dancing world."
Along
with the three
Michael Jackson dances, the
show will also feature flamenco, hip-hop, African dance, a
"newbie" dance (a mix of hiphop, African and Latin), and
hip-hop and swing fusion.
While some of the other dances'
styles are not specific to a
genre, the hip-hop and swing
combination is an interesting
mix.
"We're trying to show more
than just the styles that we usually have as a representation of
the African Diaspora by having
swing," Rosenblut said, men-

tioning that while swing has a

lot of influence from the
African Diaspora dances, it is
not often seen on stage or in an
RnM concert.

the semester

soon after.
The first step
was to choreograph the
different
pieces, and
each dancer
had a different approach.
"Some people start the
semester with a concept, so
they need to choreograph as
the year goes by," Rosenblut
said, "Some people come to
[school] with a piece entirely
choreographed; they just have
to teach it."
Kennedy likes to choreograph before classes start, usu-

ing
her
choreographing process for
this concert a bit different from
those in the past. Along with
her MJ piece, Kennedy wil
also be performing in a few
other dances.
Practices started two weeks
into the semester and everyone
worked more diligently since
this year's show is earlier than
in previous years. "People have

come together really well actually," Margot Adams 'lO, codirector of the RnM executive
committee said. "We had to
really enforce deadlines and
enforce how much time people
spent working on each piece,
but people have really dedicated themselves to RnM this
semester in order to make sure
that we're ready for next weekend."
With all the work each
dancer has put into the choreography and into perfecting the
moves, Adams and others were
"really impressed with the
group" and she hopes the audience wiH appreciate "how
much work goes into it and
how much we actually care
about pleasing our audience
and making sure that we get
certain messages out to them
and that they have a good
time."
The fall semester Rhythm N'
Motion concert will be this
Saturday, Nov. 14, at 8:30 p.m.
in the Lang Performing Arts
Center and will be followed by
an RnM after-party at Olde
Club from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

HEFLO R BEGINS TO
Name: Jacob Phillips
Class Year: 2013
From: Fort Wayne, Indiana
Current Residence: Willets

What He's Wearing:
"I got these jeans from a boutique in
Canada." His socks are his dad's from
the '9os. He wears a J.Crew buttondown shirt, a Burberry sweater, a vintage tie, and TOMS with laces. Phillips
epitomizes the perfectly dressed
J.Crew man by combining the formal
aspects of a shirt and tie with the fun,
eclectic nature of the mustard yellow
sweater, rolled-up jeans and TOMS
with socks.
The yellow V-neck is a bold choice
since it is a color that few can pull off,
but Phillips wears it well, especially
with its contrast with the dark rinse
jeans. While the rolled-up jean look is
reminiscent of summer and spring,
Phillips transitions the look into fall
weather with cool, printed socks and
the TOMS. His style is similar to the
looks on the runways of Paul Smith,
Michael Bastian and John Varvatos.
All three designers combine the professional look with the eclectic, allowing
for men to look equally Don Draper
(Mad Men) and Urban Outfitters.
How He Describes His Style:

"I like to mix different styles,"
Phillips said, but he considers his style
to be "trendy preppy." He likes to have
a balance of both, so as not to go the
extreme with "all the way preppy [or]

Testing Facebook's promotional potential for theater

swarthmorephoenix.com

arguably specializes in more accessible
content like musicals and comedies, has
only 589.

BY ANNE COLEMAN
acolemal@swarthmore.edu

Viral videos and social networking
sites have been advertising destinations
for years. Multi-million dollar international corporations have tried to create
video advertisements that are clever
enough to collect a viral (and free) following. But new to the scene are theater companies, the small, struggling artist groups
who can't dedicate a part of their funds to

publicity.
In preparation for their newest play,
which opened last Wednesday, InterAct
Theatre uploaded a video to YouTube that
compiled footage from stage fighting
rehearsals, including elaborate professional wrestling moves and an amusing
cameo of the show's very petite dramaturg getting "power bombed," set to the
Black Eyed Peas' "I Gotta Feeling." The
video was entertaining and appealing, but
with just over 500 views, it doesn't exactly
qualify as "viral."
In addition to testing out the YouTube

vehicle, Philadelphia area theater artists
and collectives are trying out Facebook
pages. The Theatre Alliance of Greater
Philadelphia, which promotes and supports local theater in addition to hosting
the annual Barrymore Awards, is a fan of
37 pages on Facebook. Among those pages
are groups like the Philadelphia Live Arts
&
Fringe Festival and individual

The fans on Facebook are fellow the-

Philadelphia area theater companies, who
have jumped on the opportunity to open
more lines of communication with their
audiences. Naturally, the "wall" of
Theatre Alliance page is all publicity, consisting of a steady stream of status
updates, event promotions, photo albums
and videos.
What is surprising is the number of
"fans" (as Facebook labels them)
1,313
people as of 6 p.m. on Nov. 1 The comparable page for the New Jersey Theatre
Alliance had only 737. As for individual
theatre companies, the Arden Theatre
seems to be doing better than its peers in
the business, with 938 fans, while the page
for Theatre Exile is just as frequently
updated and informative as the Arden's, if
not more so, but has a mere 647 followers.
The Walnut Street Theatre, which

ater artists, theater students, subscribers
and politicians. Ages vary, but for the
most part, the fans are people who already
have some connection to the organization.
One cannot help but wonder if the pages
are actually doing anything to boost the
companies' visibility.
The answer is likely "yes." One of the
Facebook features that accompanied the

reinvention of the News Feed awhile back
was the advent of the "Suggestions" box.
Now, whenever a member decides to
become a fan of a page, the site can suggest that same page to all of that member's
friends. For lesser-known groups,.the suggestion means increased visibility, and
about getting their name out there, even if
they don't get "fans" right away.
Terry Nolen, the artistic director of the
Arden, often concludes his pre-show
speech at the premiere of a new show by
saying something along the lines of,
"Word of mouth is our best form of publicity, so if you like the show, please tell
your friends. If you don't like the show,
please tell your enemies." Facebook's suggestion feature is like an accidental wordof-mouth recommendation. However easy
it is to ignore, it is better than nothing and
delightfully free.
Some groups have tried to take this one

step further, making pages and videos specific to individual productions, or even
characters in a play. New Paradise
Laboratories used Facebook to an extreme
degree in the months prior to the Live
Arts festival this Fall, when their production "Fatebook: Avoiding Catastrophe
One Party At A Time" hit the stage. Each
character had their own Facebook page,
which they updated regularly. In the end,
the "Fatebook" cast and crew had
uploaded 65 videos and had friend lists
that rivaled those of the actual performers. Part of the goal of the production was
to incorporate Internet culture into the
live performance, so "Fatebook" is, understandably, an extreme example, but it represents am increasing trend in theater.
More and more, the live arts are hoping that Internet buzz will translate into
bodies in the seats. The Internet presents
a golden opportunity for the theater company that masters its alchemy. Once a person is a fan of a page or a subscriber to a
YouTube channel, they can be contacted
through messages or new video alerts.
This opens up a direct line of communication between the audience members and
the director of public relations.
A new era in theater could begin if
someone found the right formula for turning an Internet following into a subscribing audience. For the time being, it's a just
pipe dream, fed by the already loyal followers and friends of local theaters.

Alien entertainment: The new invaders among us

Alex Israel
Pencils Down,
Pass the Remote
The other day, while watching
the pilot episode of ABC's "V:
The Reimagined Series," a.k.a.
the network's second attempt to
find an appropriate replacement
for "Lost" (after the excellent
"FlashForward"), I learned two
things: Elizabeth Mitchell can
say anything at all in her soothing-yet-steely voice and I will be
instantly reassured, and two, seeing the flesh of someone's face
peeled back to reveal scaly reptilian skin is unbelievably disgusting, particularly when the individual whose face is getting
peeled is best known as Pastor
Veal
from
"Arrested
Development." (For those of you
who are too lame to watch
"Arrested," the actor's name is
Alan Tudyk, and he played Steve
the Pirate in "Dodgeball" as well
as starring in "Firefly").
The emergence of the true,
reptilian form of the Visitors
the alien race whose spectacular
arrival and promises that they

are "of peace" set off the series'
central conflict
is another in
the long line of revolting transformations in alien movies.
These transformations began
with the emergence of the pod
people in "Invasion of the Body
Snatchers," and they continued
with the chest-bursting aliens in
"Alien" and its various sequels.
Just this summer, "District 9"
added another indelible transformation image: the poignant and
disturbing
site of Sharlto
Copley's hapless Wikus Van de
Merwe slowly and painfully
turning into an alien as a result
of a tragic accident.
I bring up "District 9"
because, while watching the stylish and effects-laden "V" pilot, I
was haunted by the dirt, pain
and gritty realism that suffused
the former and which was, with
the exception of the aforementioned face peeling, conspicuously absent from the new series.
The ships that deliver the
Visitors in "V" are curved and
elegant, designed with the steeland-glass aesthetic common in
the early, optimistic sci-fi of the
1950s and 60s. The spaceship that
delivers the derogatively named,
degraded Prawns (no one wants
to call these creatures, with their
inhuman appearance and incomprehensible language of guttural
clicks, anything as nice as
Visitors) is far from elegant; its

sharp angles and protruding
engines are a stark contrast to
the sinuous curves and freshly
polished chrome of the Visitors'
ship. Think about the way that

the dank interior of the Romulan
ship in the new "Star Trek" con-

trasts with that ultimate symbol
of sci-fi Utopia, the Enterprise,
and you'll get the idea.

The clever conceit of the
Visitors' technology is that it
draws parallels, consciously or
otherwise, with the Enterprise.
It's hard not to; the imagery of
Star Trek is so embedded in pop
culture that almost any shiny,
white spaceship will call up an
association with the crew of the
Enterprise and their humanitarian mission. "V" has the opportunity to draw on this capital and
subvert it, making the technologically advanced, impossibly
good-looking Visitors the villains
despite their message of peace
and the cleanliness of their ship.
It's the mirror image of what
Neill Blomkamp, the director of
"District 9," did by presenting
his Prawns, whose reptilian
form and gritty ship recalled the
aliens of "Alien," as a persecuted
minority who, like themuch cuddlier E.T., just wanted to go
home.

If the creators of "V" can pull
off this subversion of sci-fi
norms, the show will be elevated
from merely a well-made, serviceable remake to a compelling
series in its own right. The series
already has one advantage going
for it, and that is the presence of
Mitchell in the lead role of FBI
agent Erica Evans. (The fact that
she shares her name with a
member of the class of 2011 is, I
assume, just a fun coincidence).
Mitchell, who was phenomenal
as Juliet on "Lost," brings her

son
Tyler
(Logan
Huffman). In the hands of a lesser actress the moment would
have come across as grating, but
Mitchell lets you see the pain in
her eyes even as her words turn
nasty. Plus, Tyler is an annoying
little shit, although his entrance

It is lucky that Mitchell's
understated delivery and soothing voice make almost anything

is forced to utter some unfortu-

nately heavy-handed expository
dialogue. It appears that the writ-

ers of "V" don't think their audience can make inferences by
themselves, and therefore choose

to write connections explicitly
into the script when an implica-

tion would have sufficed. This

style works when Mitchell is
talking, but becomes difficult to
listen to when articulated by Joel

I have never seen a

For college students, it is patently
easy to remain detached from the discussion. So even though it is practically impossible to provide a comprehensive yet brief summation of the various viewpoints (the House bill that just

after all), there are certainly salient
points that warrant further elucidation.

THE PHOENIX

Though estimates of how much
plan could save range from
$175 billion to $l.B trillion over ten
years, the fact of the matter is that in
the short-term, the states would find it
difficult to create enough budget space
to accommodate the new plan.
The most pressing objection to the
bill, on top of all these concerns, is its
incomplete
nature.
apparently
Representative Dennis Kucinich (DOh.) bemoans the fact that the House
bill is far too diluted a reform and "[i]n
the end, this is the insurance companies getting carte blanche and the
Congress giving up its power to insurance companies."
In fact, nobody suggests that the bill
is perfect.
If anything, the Democrats are tripping over themselves in emphasizing
that this bill is simply one step forward; America should pass the bill
now and smooth over the rough edges
later, as we did with Social Security
and Medicare.
"Our plan is not perfect, but it is a

here [at this juncture]." The mentality
is that the reform movement needs a
strong push to sustain momentum
before the revising, as it were, of the
law commences. Whether that sentiment is valid is, clearly, still very
much up for debate. It is now up to the

care, and a palatable compromise
between the two houses of Congress
must be reached before Obama can

Leader Harry Reid (D- Nev.) hopes to
bring a version of the health care bill
to the floor next week; expect the
Senate's version to differ from the
House's current bill.
What this means for us as college students
A thousand words in, and the health
care bill still may seem very separate
from the daily grind of college life. The
and whatever incarnaHouse bill
tion the Senate ends up debating
does have, however, very real implications for our demographic.
Given that the health care reform
will end up fining those who are uninsured (whether the amount is exactly
as written in the House bill is doubtful) and that about 71 percent of fouryear private nonprofit institutions
require health insurance of all students (Swarthmore is one of them), the
effects of a public option will be very
direct.
Currently college students have
fewer problems getting health insurance because they are generally
healthy and private insurance companies make money on them.
Once we get out of college we have
the option of not buying health insurance, which has a good chance of being
cheaper than paying premiums every
month.
But under the new plan, we would
be required to have health insurance.
For society, it is important that young
people have health insurance to level
the playing field and keep costs down.
While we may dislike this now, in the
long run we will feel the positive
effects of everyone being required to
have health insurance.

In 2007, the

Gini coefficient, which is used to measure equality
with 0 representing perfect equality
was 0.475. To get some
perspective, this means America is
slightly
more unequal than the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

I suppose I'm being disingenuous. My
calculations of inequality are actually
from AFL-CIO data on the 100 top paid
CEOs in America, though the Gini coefficient for the entire U.S. actually stood
at 0.463 in 2007. It appears that inequality, as measured by the Gini index, is
more iniquitous among rich CEOs than
it is among all Americans.
800 hoo.
No one cares that, in 2009, Ralph
Lauren made over ten times more than
Michael Dell. But what about everybody
else? Do we even care?
But these aren't questions CAM is
asking. Last week, organizers scrawled
"CAPITALISM IS COLONIAL" on the
path to McCabe. And last Tuesday, CAM
invited community organizer Tyrone
Boucher to lead a student discussion on
"resisting capitalism" and fighting
"wealth inequality." One Swarthmore
student admitted he was embarrassed to
be an economics major.
If CAM organizers are to make such
chalkings and invite "anti-capitalists" to
campus, then they had better have some
good alternatives to capitalism in mind
and have more to offer than ruminations
from the theoretical socialist wonderland.
Such discussions aren't enlightening;

v

they're distracting.
Instead of lamenting about studying

op-art

economics, we should ask the following
questions: Should we worry primarily
about inequality, or is inequality a symptom of more important problems? Will
reducing inequality make society better
off? These are questions I'll try to
answer.
Suppose we're interested in defeating
inequality because we believe it's intrinsically bad. In this case, we should consider some causes of wealth inequality.
Let's also (momentarily) assume our
metrics of inequality hold.
It turns out that progressive social
policy and technological innovation are
partly responsible for increased inequality. For example, one consequence of
removing institutionalized discrimination during the Civil Rights Movement
was the liberalization of immigration
policy. This radically increased the number of less-skilled workers in the labor
market, which increased competition for
low-paying jobs. Harvard economist
George Borjas estimates that the immigration influx between 1980 and 2000
reduced high school dropouts' wages by
8.9 percent and college graduates' wages
by 4.9 percent. Ostensibly, immigration
reform made us worse off!
Additionally, society's changing attitudes about women in the workforce also
increased inequality among households.
Brookings Institution economist Gary
Burtless calculates that, because highly
skilled women typically marry highly
skilled men, the increasing prevalence of
dual-income households has increased
inequality by 13 percent.
Given this evidence, if we believe
wealth inequality is essentially wrong,
and progressive social policy is a sufficient cause of inequality, do we then
deduce that progressive policy of the
Civil Rights Movement was fundamentally bad as well?
Perhaps you are not persuaded by this
evidence and believe that evil conglomerates propagate inequality. After all,
Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman makes
this point in his book, "The Conscience
of a Liberal." Krugman
writes:
"Movement conservatism is financed by
a handful of extremely wealthy individuals and a number of major corporations,
all of whom stand to gain from increased
inequality." Progressive policy may have

by

carey

contributed to inequality, but self-interested and well-connected corporations
are the main instigators of inequality.
But if there were anything that the
election of Barack Obama showed, it
would be that wealth is not correlated
with voting. According to Pew 2008 exit
polling data, 52 percent of Americans
making $200,000 or more voted for
Obama, despite Obama's pledges to
"spread the wealth around" and media
campaigns that painted him as a "socialist." If rich people voted according to liberals' cynical view of American society,
then the wealthy would have wholeheartedly rejected Obama at the ballot
gasp!
they didn't.
box. But
So who cares about inequality anyway?
Europeans definitely do. European
taxation is more progressive and its governments are more involved in redistribution than the United States. In 1996,
while theratio of transfers (welfare, etc.)
to GDP in the U.S. was 14 percent, in
Europe the ratio was 22 percent. But

more government transfers must be
financed by higher taxes (hard to
believe, isn't it?), which decreases
investment and growth. Clearly, some
influential constituents must benefit
from transfers to rationalize sacrificing
growth, which makes everyone worse
off. So who are these constituents?
Alesina et al. (2001) attempt to answer
this question. In Europe, preferences for
inequality are as expected: all poor people and liberal rich people are very concerned about inequality.
But in the United States, researchers
find that the only people who are negatively affected by inequality are rich leftists! Poor people in America, it seems,
aren't so concerned about income
inequality (even at the 20 percent level!)
because people believe they might
become wealthier in the future, and
higher taxation to finance welfare programs diminishes their positive outlook.
It seems that poor people in Europe
worry more about inequality than the
American poor because, perhaps as a
result of more progressive taxation and
heftier regulation, social mobility isn't
as prevalent in Europe as it is in the U.S.
And, according to a 2007 Treasury
Department report, poor Americans

pietsch

have good reason to be optimistic about
social mobility. Between 1996 and 2005,
about half of those in the bottom quintile
of the income distribution in 1996 moved
to a higher group by 2005. Only 17 percent of Americans fell.
CAM organizers hurt their cause
when they chalked, "NOTHING TRICKLES DOWN!" Because, really, who cares?
Nearly all of us know (or pray nightly
for) the truth of the old adage, "Money
doesn't buy happiness." Really
lots of
psychology research supports this.
happier.
winners aren't
Lottery
Psychology texts routinely cite the fact
that the income people say will make
them happiest is actually a moving target, or about forty percent higher than
current income. If government doubles a
poor household's income from $30,000 to
$60,000, then they'll feel they need $84,000
to be happy.
And to top it off, some counterintuitive microeconomic theory published in
the prestigious American Economic
Review by Hopkins and Kornienko (2004)
suggests that increasing equality may
actually make poor people worse off!
Classic microeconomic theory suggests people only derive utility from net
consumption, but as early as 1899 economists began to consider how consumers
could also get utility from conspicuously
consuming more than others. Relative
consumption increases utility more than
absolute consumption.
Intuitively, we know conspicuous consumption is wasteful and makes society
worse off. But when we decrease inequality, the new "middle" class must conspicuously consume more to maintain utility
from consumption while the rich can
conspicuously consume less. So the rich
are better off at the expense of everyone
else.
This is reasonable because wealth
redistribution thins the ranks of the
wealthy, so the affluent have less competition to motivate their conspicuous consumption. Although the rich may still
conspicuously consume pricy Maseratis,
the newly equal middle class devotes
proportionately more income to conspicuous consumption in order to differentiate itself in a society where everyone is
the same. So the middle class is worse off
than before.
And since redistribution cannot take
all people out of poverty, some people
remain poor. Sadly, the notion that "misery loves company" suggests that with
fewer poor people, the poor who remain
are worse off than before.
While the authors don't favor regressive taxation, they seek to challenge
today's popular belief that an additional
dollar is worth less to a rich CEO than to
a union worker because a rich CEO
already has millions more dollars
he
doesn't need that extra dollar.
So if we don't really care about
inequality, what do we care about?
Structurally intransigent social problems. If social mobility doesn't exist for
some Americans (as is well documented)
because our educational system is dysfunctional, labor laws leave migrant
workers vulnerable to abuse, crime
afflicts neighborhoods, and workers are
constantly preoccupied by economic
insecurity, then these are the problems
that require solutions. But denouncing
inequality distracts us from the real
issues. These are the problems on which
CAM needs to focus.

The Swarthmore volleyball team's
historic conference campaign came to
an end Saturday, as the Garnet fell to
No. 25 Haverford in four sets in the
Centennial Conference semifinals.
Haverford (28-3, 10-0 CC) took control of the match early in front of a
home crowd, quickly taking the first
two sets, including a 25-7 blowout in
the second set. Suddenly, Swarthmore
(19-10, 6-4) was looking at two-sets-tonone deficit in front of an increasingly
frenzied Haverford crowd. All margin
for error had vanished as quickly as
the second set.
Swarthmore, however, wasn't quite
ready for the match to end. Digging in,
the Garnet held off the Fords in the
third set and carved out a 25-22 victory,
putting up 16 kills in the third set
alone.
Head coach Harleigh Chwastyk
made sure to cite the unprecedented
turnout of Swarthmore fans for a visiting match as a boost for the team.
"[On] Saturday, the Swarthmore
fans were awesome," she said, "I know
we played in the Haverford gym, but it
was a home match for Swarthmore."
"We just kept at it," senior Johanna
Bond 'lO said. "Coach [Chwastyk] said
'Don't look at the scoreboard. Just keep
going.' We're a team that likes to come
back, and volleyball is so much a game
[of] momentum shift. Unfortunately,
when you let the other team get on
runs, it can be pretty hard to stop it."
The fourth set saw four lead
changes, and a late run by the Garnet
to cut the deficit to 23-21 four points
from evening the semifinal match.
But it was not to be, as Haverford
bagged the next two points to secure a
spot in the conference finals for the
third year in a row.
For a program that has long been
relegated to looking up at perennial
contenders such as Haverford and
Gettysburg, this year's finish represents a new best. Chwastyk, for her
part, believes that it signals a new era
for Swarthmore volleyball.

"We're reaching the next plateau
now. We're right in the middle of it," she
said. "And with our recruiting as strong
as it is right now, we're looking forward."
"We're disappointed, obviously,
because it was such a big game, and
we'd had such a good run," Bond sand.
"But after a day it became easier to
have some perspective on what we
accomplished [this season]. It's hard, of
course, because we came so close, but
it's also important to look at all the good
things that happened this year."
In what has become a familiar storyline all year, outside hitter Genny
Pezzola 'l2 set the tone for the Garnet
offensive. Pezzola, selected as Most
Valuable Player of the Garnet Classic
Tournament all the way back in
September, and who was twice-named
the Centennial Conference Player of the
Week, had 16 kills and 19 digs Saturday.
Haverford's Kelsey Cantwell led both
teams with 20 kills, while Caitlyn
Tranquillo led defensively with 16 digs.
Bond and Kearney Bangs 10, in the
last conference match of their
Swarthmore careers, played games they
could be proud of. Bangs racked up a
team-leading 26 assists, while Bond
posted 11 kills.
"This has been a really special season for Kearney and me," said Bond.
"We feel very lucky to have played on
such a special team, where all of us
were playing 'for' the team the whole
time."
Haverford, meanwhile, advanced to
Sunday's championship match against
Gettysburg and won in straight sets for
its third title in as many years.
On Monday, Chwastyk received the
news that the Garnet volleyball team
had been selected to participate in the
Volleyball

Tournament as the sixth seed.
"I'm over the moon about this,"
Chwastyk said. "And so are the girls."
Swarthmore drew 320 rival Widener

women have a lot to be proud of, having
gone where no Swarthmore volleyball

was headed to the back of the net to tie the

But the ball struck the crossbar over the

and Johns Hopkins held off Swarthmore by

In the loss, the Garnet was only able to
put two shots on goal, with a swarming
Hopkins defense and the metalwork keeping Swarthmore at bay. "They blocked a

they defended very well, and I give them a

The Blue Jays would go on to win the
Conference Championship, defeating fourthseeded Dickinson in the finals 2-1, the Red
Devils having upset the host Muhlenberg
the day before. With the win, the Blue Jays
secured an automatic berth in the NCAA
Division 111 men's soccer tournament.
Even after the loss, the Garnet finished
ranked third in the Mid-Atlantic Region and
18th overall in the NSCAA Division 111
Soccer Poll. When the NCAA released the
field for the 2009 Division 111 tournament
last Sunday, the Garnet learned that it
would be in its second straight NCAA tour-

nament.
Muhlenberg, who won the regular season
Centennial Conference championship with
a record of 7-1-1, and Dickinson, who beat
Swarthmore head-to-head in penalty kicks
on Sept. 26 and made the Centennial

Conference finals, were left on the outside
looking in.

The Garnet, now with a record of 14-2-2,

will open the tournament on Saturday

against Merchant Marine, an at-large bid
from the Landmark Conference who finished the year at 15-3-0. The match will be
played at Clothier Field, as will the opening

round match between Hobart (14-3-2) and St.
Joseph's of Long Island (13-8-0). The win-

ners of these two matches will return to
Clothier Field on Sunday with a spot in the
Sweet 16 on the line.

But Swarthmore enters the NCAA tournament having won only one of its last four
matches. After a 1-1 tie on the road at
McDaniel and a 0-0 draw in front of the
Garnet faithful at Clothier Field,
Swarthmore defeated Haverford 4-2 in the

regular season finale before Saturday's loss

to Hopkins.

Langley and midfielder Micah Rose 'l2

"[We've had] a lack of creativity, and a

shut out just three times this year, but twice
in the final three matches.
"At this time of the year, we are playing

Women search for third ECAC South title in a row

It's the worst way to lose in soc-

cer.

In one of the game's crudest
tricks, the Swarthmore women's
soccer team (13-4-1, 7-3-1 CC) found
itself in a bind against Dickinson
(15-4-1, 7-3-1 CC) in a play-in game
for a berth in the Centennial

Conference semifinals.
The score was tied at 1-1 after 90

minutes of regulationplay and two
10-minute overtime periods.
Swarthmore got on the board
first when Kelsey Cline 'll blasted
a ball from Hannah Purkey 11 into
the corner of the net at 28:12. The
Garnet held the 1-0 lead for over
thirty

minutes.

It looked like it might be a
repeat result of an earlier meeting
between the two squads this season. In what was the first ever
match between two ranked opponents in Centennial Conference
history, the No. 15 Garnet beat the
No. 25 Red Devils by a score of 1-0
at Clothier Field on Sept. 19.
But it was not to be. Dickinson
junior Ashley Kunkle finally broke
through in the 81st minute to tie
the score.
Marie Mutryn 'l2 tallied 12
saves for Swarthmore in the net,
keeping the Garnet in the game
despite being outshot 26-19.

took to the field eager for a decisive
win, the game moved into penalty
kicks to decide who would move
on to face top-seed and regular season champion Muhlenberg in the
semifinals of the conference tournament on Saturday.

And the year before that,
Swarthmore left the playoffs at the

Centennial Conference playoffs
have not been kind to the Garnet.
The early exit also killed

to for Swarthmore in a season that
saw an impressive 5-0 start and a
national ranking of 16 on Oct. 13.
Five shots from 12 yards out, and a
lot of crossed fingers.
Both teams were perfect
through the first four shots, with
neither goaltender able to deflect
any of the close range blasts.
Dickinson's sophomore First-Team
All-Centennial selection Sarah
Montminy made it five-for-five for
the Red Devils, leaving fellow
First-Teamer Julia Luongo 10 to
seal the deal for the Garnet.
Her shot was just like all the
others.
But this time, Dickinson's senior goalkeeper Kailyn Hartmann
was in the right place at the right
time, blocking the shot in an
impressive effort and sending her
team through to the semis.
It was a painfully familiar
result for Swarthmore, who had
been ousted by Dickinson in the
semis in the 2008 conference tournament. Fittingly, it was Cline who
vaulted Swarthmore to a 1-0 lead in
the first period, but the Devils
responded with two goals to send
the Garnet home empty-handed.

Swarthmore's chances at finally
receiving a bid to the NCAA tournament. Johns Hopkins defeated
Dickinson 1-0 to win the conference championship and secure the
Centennial's only automatic bid.
Top-seed Muhlenberg was the
only other Centennial Conference

team to receive a bid one of 21 atlarge invites, no doubt by virtue of
-

their mid-season wins over powerful Hopkins and Swarthmore, two
teams that were nationally ranked.
Dickinson, too, was left off the
list despite scoring two wins over
the Mules this season (a 2-0 victory on Oct. 3 and a 4-2 decision in
the conference semifinals after
beating Swarthmore). Small consolation.
For good measure, though,
Swarthmore landed six women on

the All-Centennial Conference
teams announced Monday, the
most of any team in the conference, along with Muhlenberg.
Luongo joined Megan Colombo 11
on the First Team, who made her
third appearance on the list after

and the Second Team in her first
two seasons.
Newcomer Alexa Ross 13 was
one of only four first-years in the
conference to get a nod.
Ross and Laura Bolger 11 were
named to the Second Team, a notch
up for Bolger after an Honorable
Mention last year. Mutryn and
Maggie DeLorme 10 were also recognized, receiving
Honorable

Mentions this year.
For now, the Garnet sets its
sights on making the most of its
berth in the ECAC South Region
Championship tournament.
Swarthmore nabbed the third
seed in the tournament and
blanked sixth seed Centenary
(16-5-1) last night in a 3-0 blowout.

The Garnet cruised ahead of the
Cyclones on the strength of firstperiod goals by DeLorme, Kirsten
Peterson 11 and Taylor Rhodes 10.
But even though the Garnet
outshot their opponents 32-6, the
tournament will be no cakewalk.
"These are good teams we're
playing, with good records," head
coach Todd Anckaitis said after
the game.
