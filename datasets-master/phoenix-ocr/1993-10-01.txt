October 1,1993

Mason works to redefine, encourage multiculturalism
'Multiculturalism...should be as inclusive a process as possible.'
By Elizabeth Bramson
Stepping into the position of

Associate Dean for Multicultural

Affairs, Joe Mason finds himself in
the midst of an ongoing struggle to
definemulticulturalismand take the
necessary measures to incorporate
this definition into the philosophy
of the college. Mason oversees the
activities of the IC, the BCC, the
Gender Concerns Advocate, and international students.
Mason, however, is quick to
eliminate terms like 'oversee,' 'supervise' and 'chain of command' in
describing his position. "I prefer to
call it a team effort, a collaborative
process, towards developing shortand long-term
plans for
multiculturalism at Swarthmore."
Regardless, the task ahead is
clearly one of the most pressing
and pressured
assignments facing academia today.

Joe Mason, Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs: 1 ask

In discussing multiculturalism,
Mason points to the three-part definition of culture that last spring's
CEP task force created.
By their standards, culture operates: "1) as a reservoir of values
and a body ofnormative practice—operative through the groups' languages, rituals, modes of governance, forms of work and play, etc.;

College News Briefs
Compiled from the College Press Service
PHILADELPHIA The University of
Pennsylvania has decided not to punish nine
students who swiped all the copies of a campus newspaper April 15 to protest a conservative columnist's writing.
Claire Fagin, interim president of the
university, andMarvin Lazerson, interimprovost, decided this fall to accept the recommendationof a special faculty judicial officer
who said no further disciplinary action should
be taken against the students.
However, both administrators warned
that Perm would move quickly to punish any
future confiscations of campus publications.
"Free expression ofideas is essential to
the university and to American society," Fagin
andLazerson said in a joint statement. "The
confiscation of any publication on campus is
wrong and will not be tolerated."
The Daily Pennsylvanian is distributed
free across campus, including residence halls,
classrooms and administrative buildings.
Last spring, African-American students
threw the full press run
into trash bins.
After learning of the incident, the newspaper
staff moved quickly to print and distribute an
additional 6,000 copies.
Disciplinary charges were filed against
nine of some 60 students who took copies of
the newspaper from distribution sites. The
Black Student League, a student group, organized and sanctioned the protest in response
to the newspaper's policies and editorial columns by a conservative writer who questionedMartinLuther King Jr. as a black hero,
andhis comments regarding whathe said was
blacks' preferential treatment in admissions
and disciplinary procedures.
Officials said Perm was one of 15 U.S.
institutionswhere newspapers were seized in
recent months. Protesters defended the actions as political demonstrationsbecause they
charged that the papers were biased in news
coverage or were promoting racism and sexism.
Howard Arnold, the faculty judicial officer, also recommended that the staff and
management of7?t£ Daily Pennsylvanian and
the Black Student League meet to work out
differences.
"Communication, dialogue and meditationneed to become the norm on this campus,
not the exception," Fagin and Lazerson said
in the statement.
After talking withthe students, advisors,
faculty and administrators, Arnold said he
concluded that the newspaper theft resulted
from long-standing disagreements between
black students, the student editors and the
university.
Arnold said he found students on both
sides of the dispute were genuinely open to
discussions to find common ground, so there
was no further need for disciplinary action.
"Mistakes by students must be seen more
as opportunities for education than as occasions for punishment," he said.

Former Perm President Sheldon Hackney, who is now chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, has been
criticized for his handling of racial tensions
and free speech issues that arose last year
when he whenhe was still head ofthe university.
Last spring, five black students dropped
charges ofracial harassment against a white
student who called them "water buffalo,"
saying they did not believe they could get a
fair hearing on the issue. The white student
said he did not consider "water buffalo" to be
araci al slur, and he simply wanted thewomen
to stop making noise outside his dorm room.
The incident received extensive media
coverage because of the free speech issues
involved.

BOONE, N.C.
More than 650 students and faculty members silently marched
across the Appalachian StateUniversity campus in memory of a student who lost her life
to violence four years ago.
The silentmarchhasbeen heldeveryfall
since Jeni Gray, an Appalachian student, was
abducted and murdered in the fall of 1989.
The crowd, which included a student
who was abducted and sexually assaulted by
the man who murdered Gray, converged on
the student center in early September, where
they listened to speeches they hope will raise
awareness and dispel fears.
The Boone, N.C. campus has a history of
violence. Gray's abductiontook place a block
from the campus, and last year, a highly
publicized rape took place in a central part of
the campus.
While Gray's murderer is on death row,
the perpetrator of the rape remains free.
"These events really shook up the community," said William Purcell, a senior who
is advertising director of The Appalachian,
the school newspaper. "There is a problem
with women feeling safe on this campus," he
said.
The silent walk, Purcell said, is a wayof
dealing with the anxieties.
"Tonight a bell will ring everyfour minutes as a reminder to us that a woman is raped
every four minutes," Barbara Daye, associate
vice chancellor of student development, told
the crowd, most of whom wore white ribbons.
Chancellor Francis T. Borkowski addressed the crowd, and introduced a new
program thathecalled "Tell Someone." "This
is a campaign to rise over the fear that so
many have who have been victimized to
speak to someone, anyone about it," he told
the students.
One of the speeches was byLeigh Cooper Wallace, another Appalachian student
who was abducted andraped by the same man
whomurdered Grayfive days before. Wallace
is now married and the mother of a two-yearold boy.

Conservative paper
twists diversity goals
'to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable'
News Commentary
By Andy Perrin
"Common sense itself is ideologically...
constructed. The 'obvious' and the 'natural'
are not given but produced in a specific
society by the ways in which that society talks
and thinks about self." -Catherine Belsey
The latest move in the saga of the
SwarthmoreConservative Union was theproduction last week of a shamelesspropaganda
rag, euphemistically entitled "Common
Sense."
Intended as a devastating critique of
what our campus's beloved Conservative
Union believes is a stilling, overwhelmingly
"liberal" political climate, the paper's logic
stumbles over itself, ultimately amounting to
little more than wallowing in conservative
self-pity.
Both amusing and chilling is the way the
paper's editors latch onto the concept of
"diversity," claiming that Common Sense is
aimed at "Swarthmore College's ideologically diverse."
That claim is belied by the next page,
though, where editor Matt Schenk '95 sets a
strict limit on diversity, ideological and otherwise. In a bizarreand convoluted argument
in which homosexuality is implicitly compared to drug abuse, Schenk warns against
"normaliz[ing] deviant behavior."
So much for appreciation of difference.
Clearly celebrating diversity, for these editors, ends at the first opportunity for bigotry.
Thefirst article announces thesecond in
a series of conservative lectures, funded
heavily by both the College and the rightwing Young America's Foundation. Apparently this "'radical' economist" will complain that taxation is an illegitimate use of
government force. According to Common
Sense, Walter Williams argues that Americans are enslaved by a government that taxes
them less heavily than essentially any other
industrialized nation.
Fascinating—for these folks it is appropriate to govern whompeople may love in the
privacy of their homes, but inappropriate to
legislate care for the needy.
Moving down the page, yet another article by Mr. Schenk (who is so marginalized
by his conservative views that his work has
graced the pages of The Phoenix for years,
and who currently holds an Opinion coeditorship) decries Swarthmore's slippage to
#3 in the U.S. News and World Report
rankings. Never mind that no slippage occurred, since Swarthmore was in the same
position last year.
Schenkargues, with no evidence to support his claim, that alumni donations to the
College have dropped significantly because
Swarthmore has "shift[ed] away from the
things that they [alumni] remembered
Swarthmore... for." Nevermind that right—wingers have claimed for nearly a century
that Swarthmore was a liberal beachhead in
conservative America (see, for example, the
appendix to Digby Baltzell's Puritan Boston
and Quaker Philadelphia, where he makes
that claim at least as far back as the interwar
years). For Schenk, a drastic change has
occurred on campus in the past couple of

years.
Which brings us to page 4, where a
simplistic diatribe against everyone to the left
ofEd Meese by James B. Taylor '72 lets us
know that this feeling ofconservative victimization has existed for a quarter-century at
least. So muchfor theclaim ofalum political
disenchantment; maybe thePACand therenovation of Trotter have left their pockets dry.
Rounding out the front page, we have a
truly shameless appropriation of the language
of rape-prevention groups, where "reporter"
Thomas R. Makin claims that "Safer sex
[was] forced on Frosh." Only below do we
find that it was education
not sex
to
which the first-year students were subjected.
Heaven help us when an educational institution requires education.
Makinrolls out student after student all
unnamed, of course
who were shocked at
"graphic" depictions of sexual scenes. Last I
heard, Swarthmore students were adults capable of dealing with such images without
upset stomachs; does the ConservativeUnion
really think we are so sheltered?
That article also leads one to distrust
Ram Lee's solemn plea not to trivializerape
and sexual assault. Makin's articleunmistakably uses the buzzword of"force" and the oftrepeated rape victim's feeling that "[l] felt so
dirty, [l] wanted to take a shower." So much
for taking sexual assault seriously.
I won'tkeep going withpointing out the
contradictions, closed-mindedness, and plain
bigotry that pervades the college's newest
student publication. Ifyou'd like more, drop
a note in college mail to me or The Phoenix,
and if enough people are interested more
discussion can be arranged.
But it is clear that the problems with
Common Sense are the same ones conservatives have struggled with at least ever since
I've been here. This is my fifth year on
campus, and every year they've come together to try to break the "P.C. Orthodoxy"
that bothers them. And every year they come
out with something like Common Sense, generating more heat than light.
There is no lack ofconservatives on this
campus. There is, however, a lack ofthoughtful conservative argument. If one were to
remove the bigotry, unwarranted attacks, and
P.C. backlash paranoia from Common Sense,
it would have little besides photographs and
white space. How the Conservative Union
expects to attract converts with such drivel is
a mystery.
There is nomerit to theclaimthat conservative opinion is repressed on this campus.
Much of the editorial staff of the new paper
hasheld high editorialpositions on The Phoenix, the college's official student newspaper.
The writing of Messrs. Schenk and Lee has
dominated the opinion section for at least a
year. And the Conservative Union's lecture
last year was funded more heavily by the
College than most other lectures.
No, conservatives are not marginal to
campus life because they're shut out of debates. They're marginal because they've
consistently failed to make an argument that
appeals to most Swarthmore students. Common Sense is anotherelement in that unfortunate tradition.

Dean outlines priorities
By Andy Perrin
Dean Ngina Lythcott has drawnup a farreaching list of priorities for the Dean's Office this year. Three of the priorities are
reviews of the way the College administration and faculty relate to students.
Associate Dean Tedd Goundie is heading a committee to revise the college's judicial procedures and the student code of conduct. That committee's recommendations
shouldbe discussed by the student body and
the faculty this year.
Another committee, headed by Associate Dean Bob Gross '62, will update the
college's alcohol policy. Thatcommitteehas
been meeting since April; its recommendations should also be released this year.
Gross will also head a new review of
faculty advising and other support programs
for students. Lythcott said the project was

part of an effort to "pay more attention to
student's lives outside the classroom."
According to Lythcott, many of the new
priorities in the Dean's Office are intended to
help studentsachieve "balance"between academic pursuits and other parts of their lives.
Another priority will be "to initiate a renewed
thrust in multiculturalism..., to help create a
climate on campus that supports students with
cultural and other lifestyle differences while
at the same time promoting interaction and
constructive relationships."
When Lythcott first visitedS warthmore,
she said she was "amazed at the prevalence of
students of different nationalities and different cultures spending time together outside
the classroom." The goal of the Dean's focus
on multiculturalism, she said, is to form College institutions that encourage and support
that trend.

Topics attracts record numbers Phoning for funding
By Ligeia Jennis
According to Jacob Mattison
'94, a long-time worker with the
Topics in Human Sexuality workshop, this year's program will be
similar to previous ones. "The most
unusual thing about this year's Topics is that it is much larger than in
previous years. We signed up about
150 people, of whom it looks like
about 80 will be able to participate
in the full program. Last year we

Wolves to
be shot
By Cameron Geddes
The AlaskaBoard ofGamehas
decided to start killing wolves and
grizzly bears from aircraft, hoping
that when the populations of the
main predators are reduced, populations of moose and caribou will
drastically increase, providing a
bounty for hunters and tourists. The
Board tried to implement this policy
lastyear at this time, but opposition
to the idea stopped it from going
into effect.
"We are going to create a wildlife spectacle on par with the major
migrations in East Africa," said
Dav< Kellyhouse of the Alaska Depart! lent ofWildlife Conservation.
Hunters' groups have applauded the
decision. They believe the animals
should be managed for the benefit
of hunters, and say they feel shortchangedby the low natural populations ofcaribou and moose.
Many biologists and environmentalists, however, contend that
the policy will upset the natural balance and actually lead to a decline in
the populations of all four animals.
Letting nature take its course would
gradually increase caribou and
moose populations, they argue, but
killing off too many predators will
lead to explosive growth, then mass
starvation and disease, reducing
numbers. This was the case at
Yellowstone National Park, where
wolves were wiped out and much of
the elk population is dying of starvation and disease. There is also
considerable opposition to thepolicy
from many Alaskans who do not
hunt, both for these reasons and
because they feel the policy sacrifices the state's general interestsfor
the minority who hunt.
The 4,000square mile area affectedby thepolicy is home to about
150-200 wolves. Until this year,
hunting the wolves required a special, restricted permit. Under the
gameboard's plan, however, all but
35 of the wolves will be killed.
They will be shot from airplanes by
state officials or by private individuals who can track the wolves by
air but must land to shoot, in midwinter when the snow is deepest
and the animals are weakest. Wolves
are already extinct or endangered in
all states but Minnesota and Alaska,
and the Alaskan wolf population
numbers at most 7,000 animals.
Information on the policy, and
a petition to the Alaskan wildlife
officials, will be available at the
Earthlust letter writing table on
October 6 and 7 in Parrish Parlors
from 10-5. Interested students can
come to an informationmeeting on
Monday or Tuesday at 10:00 in the
Community Resource Center.

Over a hundred students have taken an evening off to support the
annual Alumni Phonathon, which began on Monday and will end next
Thursday. This year's Annual Fund shouldbe over $2 million, according to Annual Funds Director Alida Zweidler-McKay '92. This year's
goal is $2.2 million.
Donations from alumni are collected in the Alumni Fund, which is
merged with theParents Fund and theFriends Fund to form the Annual
Fund. Although theendowment is invested and only the interestis used,
the Annual Fund is spent in full every year.
Annual Funds is still inviting volunteers for next week; in fact,
volunteers may have a chance to participate the same day they sign up
in Parrish. Every night, volunteers arrive for dinnerat 6:00, go through
training, and thencall alumni until 10:00.Every volunteer gets a T-shirt
and a free long-distance call, and there are prizes for thevolunteers who
pull in the most contributions and the most dollars. The top volunteer
overall will win a clock-radio donated by Michael's Pharmacy.
Zweidler-McKay is hoping for at least 160 volunteers; 139 have
signed up so far. A group with 20 volunteers may reserve the calling
room for an evening; Delta Upsilon has taken up the offer, and the
Engineering Department may do so soon.
Although most of Swarthmore's $54 millionannual budget comes
from tuition, fees, and the endowment, thebenefits of thePhonathon go
beyond the bankroll; it helps draw alumni closer to the college. "Wefeel
it's really important that our alumni get a chance to hear from the
college, and phonathons are a great chance for students to hear what
alumni are doing," said Zweidler-McKay.
Volunteers this year are starting with younger alumni, while
avoiding parents and "the major,major donors," who are already being
reached by quarterly mailrequests. Alumni who makecontributions are
not bothered again for a year; this allows Alumni Funds to cut mailing
costs and focus on drawing in new donors.
"I really appreciate all the support that others on campus have
shownfor the Annual Fund this year. I appreciate all the students who
have donated an evening of their time," said Zweidler-McKay.

liberalism—a valiant effort indeed. But instead of diversifying the paper, Mr. Schenk simply
increased the length ofthe Opinionsectionand solicited individuals to write more conservatively.
This was not theproper remedy. What resulted was a paper practicing that against which it
admonished.
Common Sense has given a bad name to the conservative movement and inevitably to all
conservatives. Listenup, conservatives, and decide ifyou realty want yourpositionsarticulated in
such a publication. The mission statementrequests that "ideological tolerance" be "cultivated"
atSwarthmore. Cultivationis a tender and carefulprocess which shouldresult in growth ofsome
sort. The publication is not interested in cultivating such growth. Frankly, it is offensive and
confrontational. Itis not offensive became ofwhatU reveals,but howitproceeds to reveal. Itdoes

importantly, support.

Sense is a space very much like theIntercukural Center whichhouses minority groups on campus
or the Black Cultural Center which houses African Americans centers which conservative
ideology implicitly disapproves. While these centers house people, Common Sensefiguratively
housescertain individuals and literally shelters their ideas as well.
Conservatives oftenpreach thedoctrine of equalopportunity, but seldomembrace measures
directed at maintaining such opportunity—measures like those included in Affirmative Action
policies. However, onsome level, itseems thatSwarthmore'sconservative coalitionhas requested

"Legend

of PC

on college campuses is greatly overrated

By Chuck Stevens
The legend has well surpassed the reality by now. High school graduates everywhere are warned of its pitfalls as they venture off to college, conservative politicians
declaimits omnipresence on university campuses,and generally rational observers shrilly
decry its nefarious purposes from many an
op-ed soapbox. The demon? Political correctness, that supposed bane ofacademic life,
the force that, according to George Will, has
superseded and driven out rational thought.
Neat trick, if you can do it, but why all the
posturing? And why is the PC doctrine so
prevalent, if all these supposedly rational
people shudder at the thought?
The case against political correctness,
apparently, consists primarily of the notion
that it somehow inhibits free expression.
We're being stripped of our individuality,

goes the refrain. We can't say what we want
anymore! The obvious one-liner response
aside, that critics of political correctness certainly seemto be expressing themselvesfreely
in denouncing the concept, and therefore that
the supposed suppression of individuality
doesn't seem to be working well, this argument paints an interesting picture of thosethat
might defend it. Political correctness, after
all, is based on that once-sacred notion of not
deliberately offending anyone, of expressing
oneself in terms that everyone can accept;
evidently, those who feel it restricts their
range of expression feel a need to deliberately
offendpeople. How, precisely, does having to
write "womyn" a few times, or say
"freshperson" instead of "freshman," limit
your free expression?
But it's gone too far, they say. It's become a plague, a menace. Very possibly—everything can be carried too far, including

theintrusion bypolitical correctness into most

examples and a few more—when was the last
time anyone’s legitimate message (meaning
that your Ku Klux Klan rally doesn’t count,

but the message, even when PCness intervenes, usually still makes it through.

There's a religion in town

Kar-yee: To break from tradition, Ligeia and I have decided to
argue the same side this week and
hope that someone responds. You
see, I have faith; I believe that someone out there reads us and that they
have something to say about what
we write each week.
Ligeia: Speaking of beliefs,
this week we thought we would
argue that science is nothing more
than humanity's attempts to understand the universe. In other words,
science is a religion.
K: Before we can make this
argument, we have to define religion. The Webster's definitions
above are a good starting point. The
key definition in each one is the
detailing of religion as a system of
beliefs. Most people will agree that
science and religion are systems of
thought. What we must prove is
that the same faith that goes
into accepting religious thought
is used in accepting scientific
thought.
L: What exactly is belief? If
you will accept my handy definition, I would suggest that belief is

Congress has, to my knowledge,
passed no law inhibiting freedom

learning, however, have instituted
this concept in one form or another, institutions that are free to
set their own guidelines for the

the harm done by such inclusions.
When, precisely, did learning a
little more about a lot more people
(and any social history cannotoverlook these factors) become a burden? Certainly, textbooksthat have
not gotten around to streamlining
the inclusions may seem a tad
clumsy, but as political correctness
remains a fact of life, with any
luck, we can learn to incorporate
such inclusions into the general
run of historical learning, and all
might benefitfrom the widerscope
of learning.
Again, like many a wellintentioned idea, political correctness can and does overstep its
bounds. Students supposedly
blackballed for inappropriate references or phrasing have a right to
complain; a reprimand, some sort
of "We find this offensive; please
modify it" from the powers thatbe,
might fit the bill better than hysteria. Fundamentally, however, political correctness has its purpose,
and a place here among the intellectuals ofthe world. In an increasingly diverse world, we can no
longer advocate language that
knowingly excludes larger and
larger portions of the populace it
purports to represent; calling one
group or another as they wish to be
called, and modifying terminology to guard against deliberate offense, could hardly be called oppressive. Intellectual curiosity, after all, must aufond be an inclusive
pursuit, and one that changes with
changing times; not to make a
message clear and palatable to all
would be foolish in the extreme.

The toilet theory on smoking in public
By Brian Schwartz

Having spent four years at a
public high school, I have used its
lavatory facilities more than once.
And unfortunately, more than once,
an unpleasant odor welcomed me
when I crossed the threshold from
the hallway. I feel I maybe crossing
otherboundaries in writing this. But
as they say, "We are what weread,"

and I was reading Chaucer last spring
when this Grand Theory ofHushing dawned on me. Anyway, in my
usual way of trying to right every
wrong I see in the world, I would
handle the situation and wonder if
flushing is not passive-aggressive.
Afterwards I wouldalso askmyself,
"Do I have a right to flush someone
else's toilet?" My answer to this
question came when I thought of

other current issues of debate.
In solving my dilemma, I thought
of more important issues where my
question applies. The first example is
cigarette smoking. Do people have the
right to smoke in public? This issue
adapts well to my toilettheory.
The question for non-smokers
is: Do you have to be in an unhealthy area? Is the choice of sustaining yourlife (not a potential life,

not get away from the smoke. Second-hand smoke is a link to lung

Let's plug the abortion issue
into the toilet theory, here and in
Congress. Some people thinkabortion is morally wrong. The question
for those against abortion (I will not

use the group term, since Pro-Life
principles are not pro-life) is: do
you feel pain when an abortion is
performed on someone? Do you
know every time one occurs? Do
you know how many there were
yesterday? Or, in other words, can
you smell it? The answer is no. If
someone is against abortion, then if
the situation arises for him (Oh,
grammar!), do not have one.
I haveestablished a theory from
a few observed particulars. I shall
present it to the scientific community as follows: For anyone's toilet,
you may flush it if and only if you
have to smell it.

I am writing regarding last

that an article libeling Al Bloom

anonymously. If individuals are
going to insult membersof the community, they should not be permitted to hide behind a pseudonym.

out to "Charred Dutch Screamer"

Will Buttram remembers CLF
By Kar-yee Wu
Will Buttram '94 had something to say. "This is to thebest of
my knowledge," he qualified. No
worries. I didnot expect a clairvoyant, just his take on the Croatian
Liberation Front (CLF), a project
which spawned a # 1 song in Croatia,
"Croatia's Gotta Be Free".
According to Buttram, Mario
Vuksan '93 decided during 1991
that he wanted to raise awareness
about the situation in Croatia and
raise funds for Croatian refugees.
He decided that a musical project
would be best. Not being a musician, Vuksan enlisted the help of
Van Curtis '94 (currently on leave)
and Rob Greenawalt (who transferred to NYU), both of whom had
extensive experience in music and
were eager to be involved.
The project quickly escalated
when they decided to make the CLF
CD as a fund-raiser. This move
brought in Buttram, Alex Cole '94
(both of whom were in a band with
Curtis), and vocalist Maya Newton
'94 (currently on leave). Curtis was
in charge of writing the music and
Vuksan and Greenwald wrote the
raps. Vuksan contacted various
Croatian groups andaccrued enough
money to cover studio time, a cost
whichButtram estimates at $ 14,000.
"At this point, things got very
chaotic. I got flown in to live with
these guys [Curtis, Greenwald and
Vuksan] for a week. It was interesting,"Buttrammused Theyrecorded
for 10 straight days. "It was Mario's
will that kept the project together.
There were some financial difficulties that were theresult of mismanagement by Mario. He wasn't a
professional manager so there were
things he didn't know about. Everyone was very on edge."
How on edge were they? "Van
is a genius and an ass...The two
[Curtis and Vuksan] together were a
very explosive combination," he
explained. "Van had to write an
albumof music on paid time, which
caused a lot of stress...[but] Van's
sense of humor kept things fresh.
He added as much stress as he took
away." Buttram's involvement revolved around "coming upfor parts
for me to play. I was also trying to
alleviate the tensions between
[Curtis and Vuksan]. I triedto make
the communications lines efficient,
but [it was] pretty much a losing
battle."

Ultimately, the producer of the

CD, Dbazz, and Vuksan got a "hiphop/dance feel" on the songs. Despite their satisfaction, Buttram felt
the songs were consequently "antiguitar, which I wasn't particularly
happy about. [However,] Van and I
accepted it and made creative adjustments accordingly."
To produce the CD, Curtis and
Eliot Ingram '94 incorporated
Headßecords. A friend of Curtis'
from Stanford, Chris Otto, made a
re-mix as a final step in the CD's
production. 1,000 copies were made
and sold to students and various
Croatian organizations. To promote
the CD's, CLF played gigs in Chicago and Cleveland. Organizations
paid for expenses and CLF played
for free.
"Chicago was cool. It was basically like being rock stars for a
weekend," Buttram said. "People
actually knew the songs. Mario had
given someone at the organization a
rough mix, the original version of
'Croatia's Gotta Be Free.' A lot of
people sang... with Rob."
A copy of the CD was sent to
Croatia and it started climbing the
charts. "That's when we were over
Michael Jackson and U2 in the first
couple of weeks of their [new] releases," Buttram said. "That was
very cool [to have a number one
song], albeit in Croatia."
Cleveland didn't run as
smoothly as Chicago. At theirfirst
gig, an accident happened. "The
bass was thumping and the amplifier we were using to drive the PA
system was on top of one of the PA
speakers and vibrated off," Buttram
described. "It almost crushed the
computer (Van's Mac) and Van's
violin, but did crush thepower line.
Right in the middle of the song,
everything went dead."
The second gig was at a "new
kind of yuppie bar," Buttram said.
"It went better except Rob kept forgetting his lines. We added 3-4 new
songs/raps...that he had just
learnt...[They were] a lot harder
hitting, which was fine because
Mario wasn't coming to the gigs
and didn't care if we lost our dance
feel.. .It was all right."
Soon afterwards the T-shirts
came out. Buttram smiled at the
memory. "Big CLF's on the front
and across the back, over the butt,
was CROATION LIBERATION

'T-I-A-N', like a nationality. So we

draw what they envision as thestories' meaning, completing the tapestries.
Hall-Brooks' enjoyment ofher work on
the tapestries is evident in the love with which
she speaks of them. She became involved in
the project in 1988, upon attending WynnWilson's tapestry workshop in Pendle Hill,
NJ. "I didn'tcome home for six weeks. [The
tapestries] seemed to leap up at me, it was a
spiritual healing."
Francis Smith, who was busy working
on a tapestry as we spoke, explained to me that
the act of creating the tapestries is part of their
spiritual fulfillment. "There is something
about putting the needle in and pulling it

Women's rugby defeats arch-rival
By Scott Williams
Swarthmore women's rugby
shut out Bryn Mawr/Haverford 50 in thepouring rain two weeks ago,
defeating their traditional rival for
the first time in years. The combined team of Bryn Mawr/Haverford
has traditionally been a powerhouse
in women'srugby, and hashad little
trouble in dispatching smaller teams
like Swarthmore in the past. Going
into the game, the Swat captains,
Jen Romich '94 and Delta
Ruscheinsky '95, thought that they
could challenge Bryn Mawr/
Haverford, but were not confident
of victory. Swarthmore dominated
the entire game.
Swarthmore started off strong

half, keeping the ball near Bryn

the entire time. The back line and
the forward back worked together
to keep their opponents always on
thedefensive. Back Becca Cole' 96
tackled aggressively, bringing her
target down with every attempt,
while Paula Garrett '95 excelled at
getting the ball off quickly from
back to front.
"The back line played well,"
says Garrett "Theconnections were
there, and we kept the ball forward
most of the game."

Ruscheinsky agrees: "Theback line
did a great job of gaining yardage.
From there the forward pack was
able to take it in and score."

Thomas recovered several crucial
line-outs, andDeb Cunningham '94
scored the only try of the gameoff a
penalty play in the first half.
"The forward pack is our biggest asset. Against Bryn Mawr/
Haverford they were very consistent, which is what keeps us in
games," said Ruscheinsky.
Swat maintained a slightly
more defensive position in the second half. Though not always as
close to scoring as they had been at
first, they were able to hold the
opposing team's offense to around
midfield. Bryn Mawr/Haverford
came close to scoring once off a
penalty play, but were denied.
Swarthmore closed the game without allowing a single try, and defeated a rival team they cannot remember ever having beaten in at
least the last six seasons.
Last Saturday, fueled by the
victory over their long-time rival, Swarthmore women'srugby
devastated a lesser Scranton
team, 29-0. Although Scranton
was not as powerful a team as
Bryn Mawr/Haverford, the lopsided score gaveboth confidence
and more experience to theSwat
ruggers.
With the win against such a
former powerhouse as Bryn
Mawr/Haverford, the women's
ruggers are confident of their
chancesfor tournament play this
season. "We're respected a lot
more as a team this year. I'm
happy with the way things are
going. In my opinion, we have
a very strong team, and we could
go a long way. Both the backs
and the forwards prove themselves time and again to be strong
and
experienced," said
Ruscheinsky.
Team members look to this
Saturday's match against
Princeton to be the key game of
the season. Ranked fifth in
U.S.A.East,Princetonhasa traditionally stronger rugby program, and will force Swarthmore to exhibit the type of consistency and skill they've shown
in thelast two weeks. A victory
against Princeton would move
Swarthmore much closer to
claiming a championship this
season. "The game againstPrinceton will probably be the climax of the season. We'll have
to give it everything we've got.
With the level of play I've seen
so far this fall, I am confident
that we can really compete this
weekend."
Swarthmore

record to 3-0 against a powerful

off-again rushing performances of
Redskin RB's Brian Mitchell and
Reggie Brooks should be a concern
for the Redskins. Their opponents,
the Dolphins, are coming off a big
win against Buffalo in Rich Stadium last week. QB Dan Marino is
in fine form and there is no reason
why Miami won't continue their
winning ways this week. Still, this

Soccer Breaks Streak

Women beat Western Maryland after 4 losses
By Amy-Ellen Duke
After breaking a four-game losing streak at Western Maryland on
Sunday, the women's soccer team is
more optimistic about its season.
The optimism is not only the result
of a win, but also due to a change in
attitude.
"The game... got usback on the
winning track.We just weren't playing as a team. They've started to
cometogethernow, though. We have
a new attitude. We got back that
aggressive, competitivehunger," said
Coach Cheri Goetcheus.
CaptainDanicaßloomquist '94
agreed: "It was a great game. We
pulled together and played pretty
soccer."
The Garnet's 2-0 win on Sunday broke a slump which included
losses to the University of Detroit,
St. Mary's, Wellesley and Mt.
Holyoke. It was the Garnet's first
Centennial Conference game. The
team is currently in a three-way tie
with Gettysburg and Dickinson for
first place in the conference.
Madeline Fraser '95 scored 8
minutes into thegame on an assist by
Jennifer Ekert '94. Miriam Marx
'94 then scored 5 minutes later. In
the second half, a Western Maryland
player was injured so play was suspended for 15 minutes. Because it
was raining, the women were forced
to wait inside.
"It could've brought us down
emotionally. Western Maryland got
pumped up, but we were able to hold
them off, especially with the stellar
play of Mara Willard '96 and Mary
Catherine Arbour '95," said
Goetcheus.
Arbour played goalie for the

second consecutivegame, a position

to broaden her horizon, so she experimented playing otherpositions.
Theteam was forced to turn to Arbour
after the rough stretch.
"A key to the last two games
has been having M.C. in the goal.
The team has a lot ofconfidence in
her goalkeeping experience," said
Goetcheus.

Swarthmore usually plays. Even
though Swarthmore lost, the positive attitude remains.
No one felt let down. It was one
of those games that will bring our
level of play up. We frustrated them
offensively," said Goetcheus.
The Garnettravel to Dickinson
Saturday for anotherCentennialConference matchup. Swat lost 4-3 last
year in an emotional game.The Garnet trailed 4-0 at the half, but came
back in the second and scored three
goals.

"It is definitely a revenge for
us," said Goetcheus.
"We're looking to maintain
consistency in our play and play 90
minutes ofsoccer," said Goetcheus.
On Tuesday the women travel
to East Stroudsburg, another Division II team. Goetcheus is unsure of
what to expect because East
Stroudsburg's program is relatively
young, but she expects the game to
be challenging.

The Garnet Tide surges forward as Chuck Hudson '96 (77) blocks for teammate Dave Reeser '95 (13). Swarthmore edged Ursinusls-14.
