Expanding the team: SMART to
increase student membership

STUDENT
Campus safety larger
concern among women

BY HOFAN CHAU

BY ELIZABETH HANSEN

When sexual health counselor
Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol received a
call about sexual assault, she came
to understand the need for students
to be trained in dealing with sexual
misconduct.
Together with Siobhan Carty 'Ol,
Howes-Mischel went to talk with Assistant Dean and Gender Education
Advisor Karen Henry about the possibility of training students. As a result of the conversation, it was suggested that students could be involved with the existing Sexual Misconduct Advisor and Resource Team
(SMART), which so far is composed
of only faculty and staff members.
The SMART Team came into existence in 1995, when public safety
and Worth Health Center trained a
group of eight faculty to support students who have experienced sexual
misconduct.
Throughout the years, however,
students have not used this resource
very frequently. Howes-Mischel
hopes that the involvement of students will draw more awareness to it
as well as offer more people for students to talk to.

Three Resident Advisors have put together a survey to gather information about the student body's
perception of safety on campus. The results will be
used to write an informed letter from the RAs to the
administration expressing the safety concerns of students.
At this point, few students have responded to the
survey. Among the ones that have, however, "the answers are all across the board," said Bonnie French
'Ol, an RA in Mertz.
For example, one question asks how frequently
the student feels unsafe on campus. All the responses
from men that French has seen have read "never."
But many women answered that they have felt frightened "frequently" after last month's assault, although they did report being frightened "infre-

quently" before the assault.
French also noticed that, so far, the men's answers to the open-ended questions have been briefer
than the women's answers. "I think people really
don't enjoy filling out surveys," she said. "I'm worried that if people don't feel strongly [about campus
safety], then they won't respond."
Abigail Stewart-Teitelbaum 'Ol, an RA in
Wharton, said she got a "good response" to the sur-

"I think sometimes people who

have been sexually assaulted feel
more comfortable talking to someone
their own age... [this initiative] gives
a wider range of people [for them] to
talk to," said Carty.
In the beginning, Henry said she
had "mixed reactions" about having
students in the SMART team, since
"students often become burdened
with other student's problems."
While there are not so many incidents that Henry cannot handle
them by herself, the SMART team
would ideally offer more individuals
with whom the survivor could identify.

Howes-Mischel also said they
were considering the possibility of a
hotline for which different people of
the SMART team would be on call
every night. Two students from the
team would also be responsible for revitalizing the survivor support

Maxman loses state senate race
BY IVAN

BOOTH E

Unofficial election results available yesterday indicate
that Republican Edwin Bacau "Ted" Erickson will be the
next state senator from Congressional District 26. Erickson
bested his Democratic opponent, Melissa H. Maxman of
the borough of Swarthmore, by a 20 percent margin.
The special election was called in January, when the
current state senator, F. Joseph Loeper, a Republican, resigned his position as Senate majority leader after he was
|ndicted for tax evasion and obstruction of a federal tax
investigation. He is currently serving a six-month prison

sentence.

According to the unofficial results, Maxman won the
towns of Lansdowne and Swarthmore but failed to take
traditionally conservative Springfield and Upper Darby.
Erickson received 26,887 votes, while Maxman received
°nly 17,816. The votes for a write-in candidate, Tom Paschos,

have not yet been released.
A Republican has occupied the Delaware County seat since
1975. State Democrats, hoping to regain the seat, had poured a
significant amount of funding into Maxman's campaign. As
of last Friday, Maxman had raised $393,658 in funds to
Erickson's $254,787. She also benefited from a team of volunteers supplied by the Democratic National Committee.
Erickson, however, received significant funds from
Loeper's campaign committee, as well as money and volunteer support from state and county GOP organizations.
"In terms ofparty-building, I'm very proud of what we did,"
said Maxman, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a lawyer
for a Center City firm. Voter turnout was higher than expected,
estimated at 31 percent of registered voters in the district.
Erickson, who holds an advanced degree from Bryn Mawr
College, is the current executive director ofDelaware County.
He will take his place in the Pennsylvania Senate in the coming days.

veys from her hall. She noted that there were several suggestions for better lighting and call boxes.
Also, the survey responses suggested that many
of her hallmates did not know the severity of the
"aggravated indecent assault" committed two weeks
when an unknown male assaulted and tried
ago
to rape a student
until a few days after the incident. Aggravated indecent assault is defined as penetration of the genitals or anus with some part of
the body.
Jen Kidwell 'Ol, Sujatha Srinivasan 'Ol and
French will do more extensive analysis of the results once they collect all of the surveys. Kidwell
said they are looking for "qualitative as well as quantitative results." The differences in responses from
men and women and from students of different class
years will all be analyzed.
French expects that upperclassmen will know
more about the college's resources for dealing with
assault, but surveys so far have shown that "some

people think they are aware [of the resources], but
really don't know what's going on."
This week, French said, the surveys will be mailed
to students who live off campus. She is sending an
e-mail to the RAs reminding them to distribute the
surveys to their halls. The small number of responses is probably due to spring break.
"I don't think either side had a good sense of
where the other was coming from," said Srinivasan
about the fireside chat held on campus safety a week
before spring break. She hopes the surveys will help
this situation.
The letter, which the RAs will write based on the
results of the survey, will be addressed to Dean of
the College Bob Gross and
Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, among others, Kidwell said. There
has been no talk yet about giving the letter to students, but "there's no reason not to," she said.
Assistant Bean Myrt Westphal is eager to see the results. "Having a poll helps individual students to become
aware" of safety issues on campus, she said. She is happy
that "students are taking responsibility for their own
safety," adding that "the downside is that it takes something bad to get something going."
"Things have already started happening," said
Westphal. There was a "high-level meeting" over
break, she reported, where Gross, Redgrave, Tedd
Goundie and Larry Schall formulated "a five-point
plan addressing the safety concerns that have been

Within nanodegrees of absolute zero

just physics
There was no magic involved
as Nobel
Prize laureate William Phillips demonstrated the principles
behind his laser cooling and trapping technique to a mystified crowd of students, professors and college alumni, and offered observers a taste of just how cold atoms cooled by the
technique are.
Phillips, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize for Physics with
collaborators Steven Chu and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, incorporated these scientific wonders and a light-hearted humor
into his Tuesday evening lecture. In "Almost Absolute Zero:
The Story of Laser Cooling and Trapping," he related to a general audience a simplified summary of the work to date in the

laser cooling field.
Phillips first defined the sensations ofhot and cold in terms
of atoms. A hot temperature, he said, means atoms are moving quickly, while cold temperatures indicate slow-moving atoms. A temperature of absolute zero, which is measured as
zero degrees Kelvin and represents the coldest possible temperature, indicates atoms that are completely motionless.
To give comparisons, Phillips told the audience that room
temperature is approximately 300 degrees Kelvin. The coldest
temperature ever naturally recorded on Earth is 185 degrees
Kelvin, observed in Antarctica during the winter. Liquid nitrogen, the coldest substance ever observed by most people,
is the medium that made Phillips' pre-lecture "magic" possible, measuring in at 77 degrees Kelvin.
Laser cooling and trapping can cool atoms to 10 nanodegrees Kelvin, and researchers expect to reach a temperature
that is a thousand times cooler through experiments conducted
in the new space station via a partnership with NASA, Phillips
said.
The development of the atomic clock, he explained, gave
rise to research into the possibility of laser cooling and trapping. Individual atoms of a gas are like tiny clocks, all identical to each other and all keeping the same time. If one could
synchronize the atomic ticking to the ticking of a clock,
Phillips said, one would get the same time everywhere.
In order to measure this time, one allows a stream of gas
atoms to diffuse from a pressurized container. As the atoms
stream from the hole in the container, their time is compared
to that of a quartz clock, then compared again after the atom

has moved about a meter.

But because these atoms move at a speed of about 200 meters
per second, there is little timebetween the initialand second

reading for scientists to measure and record atomic data. Thus,
explained Phillips, a method was needed to cool atoms so that
they would slow down and allow time for measurements to
take place. More time to measure and record atomic time
would lead to more accurate atomic clocks.
In order to slow atoms down for use with the atomic clock,
a method needed to be developed to cool atoms while they
maintain their form. Phillips explained that refrigeration
would not work, because, as the nitrogen atoms in an air filled
balloon condense when put into a vat of liquid nitrogen, the
cesium atoms used in atomic clocks would condense and become immeasurable. Thus, an alternative needed to be developed.
The alternative discovered was laser cooling. This technique uses lasers to slow atoms much like a strong blast of
water would slow a rapidly moving ball. It relies on the Doppler shift, which causes light to appear at a higher frequency
while moving towards you and a lower frequency while moving away from you, and the fact that atoms are exquisitely
sensitive to alterations in light.
When lasers of a frequency slightly below resonance are
arranged in a three-dimensional structure around the atom,
the atom will read the light as a higher frequency due to the
Doppler shift and absorb the light. This results in what physicist Steve Chu termed "optical molasses." Phillips described
this phenomenon, saying, "The atom feels very much like it
is in a viscous fluid, and thus it slows down."
However, these processes slowed atoms to only half of their
original speed. "I haven't been in this business for 22 years to
make half-fast atoms," Phillips joked. The slower-moving atoms attained by these procedures needed to be made even
slower, and physicists focused their attention on "trapping"
the atoms within magnetic fields.
Phillips explained, "Before laser cooling, the atoms were
moving too fast to be held by magnetic fields. Now, thanks to

William Phillips explained the principles behind laser cooling and trapping atoms in order to slow them. In 1997, he
and his collaborators won the Nobel Prize for Physics in acknowledgement of their efforts to reach absolute zero.
laser cooling, we can make atoms move slowly enough to
be trapped within these magnetic fields."
The entire community was excited by the measurements
attained by this process, which in 1985 and 1987 measured
the temperature of an atom at 240 nanodegrees Kelvin. But
the large margin of error was too much for Phillips and
his colleagues, and they developed a new way to measure
temperature that produced a reading of 40 nanodegrees, a

reading which challenged the previously accepted minimum limit of 240 nanodegrees.
Additional tests revealed that the temperature of the
isolated atoms was indeedbelow the 240 nanodegrees limit,
and thus a new theory on how laser cooling works was
developed to explain the inconsistencies.
The new theory, which focuses on "Sisyphus cooling,"
claims that atoms continually move upwards, as if they
were climbing hills. When an atom reaches the top of a
"hill," it absorbs light and moves to an excited state. However, new to the Sisyphus cooling theory is the fact that
atoms have different energy states. When atoms fall back
down from the excited state, they do not necessarily land
in the place they started—they often land in the bottom of

a different hill.
This continual uphill battle causes the atom to "tire" and
slow down more than expected, thus lowering the temperature to levels below previous mathematical calculations.
Using this technology to laser-cool and trap atoms,
physicists have been able to slow cesium atoms to speeds
of about seven millimeters per second, which is very slow
compared to the approximately 200 meters per second a
cesium atom moves at room temperature. What's even more
amazing, according to Phillips, is that all this can be done

in room-temperature surroundings.

This new laser cooling technology has been used in conjunction with a newly designed 'atom fountain" clock, which
shoots atoms upward, slows them and then allows gravity to
pull the atoms down, significantly increasing the amount of
time available to take atomic time measurement. This records
time that is correct to one part in one quadrillion.
These clocks, however, can only measure time this accurately for a period of a few years—they then need to be
dismantled and have the cesium gas replaced. Phillips said
a project is being undertaken to develop a new atomic clock
that will remain accurate for a longer period.
Atomic clocks can also be used to improve navigation
and communication systems. In addition, laser cooling and
trapping has led to the first recorded Bose-Einstein condensate, Phillips said.
Physics major Kevin Setter 'O2 explained, "In 1925,
Einstein predicted that if you cooled a gas to a certain degree, all the atoms wouldpile up into a clump called a BoseEinstein condensate."Before laser cooling and trapping, it
was impossible to make atoms cold enough to do this.
But, in 1995, using the laser cooling and trapping methods developed by Dr. Phillips and his colleagues, physicists
were able to create the first ever Bose-Einstein condensate,
at a temperature of about 20 billionths of a degree above
absolute zero.

Though Phillips discussed the many advances in
the field of laser cooling and trapping, he stressed
what is known now is just the tip of the iceberg. He
hoped the future would unveil new and important uses
for laser cooling and trapping.
"If you were to ask me what's the most exciting
time in laser cooling and trapping, I would say right
now," he said.

RAs hope for raised safety awareness

brought forward,"
French, Kidwell and Srinivasan
created the survey after an RA meeting was called to discuss the assault.
"The [survey] questions were inspired by the RAs' discussion," said

French.
The three RAs formulated questions "not targeted only towards

women," said Srinivasan.
The survey is only a page with a few
yes/no and short-answer questions and
room for comments.
Srinivasan and French acknowledged that Kidwell's experience at
Women Organized Against Rape this semester also helped them construct good
questions.
The three are also doing other research about national security and

safety standards and about the safety

practices at other institutions.

Stewart-Teitelbaum thinks that
the survey "came out of seniors being shaken and very confused as to
what has been going on on campus
We were scared and we still are," she
adds.
"I hope concern for [campus
safety] doesn't go away," said French.

At the Student Council meeting on Monday, campus life representative Lauren Tobias 'O2 reported on the council's recent
inquiry into the possibility of installing more computers around
campus for student use. Student groups advisor Marvin Barron
'O2 also announced a plan by the Student Budget Committee to
allow new student groups to apply for "seed money" before they
are officially chartered,
CAMPUS COMPUTER USAGE
Tobias said she had recently discussed ideas for enhancing
computer usage throughout campus with Director of Information Technologies Judy Downing and Manager of User Services
Robin Jacobson.
"There are the long-term, buying-new-equipment solutions,
and the short-term, dealing-with-what-we-have-now solutions,"

Council tackles computer issues, group funding

Tobias explained, summarizing the meeting's conclusions.
Currently, there are four computer classrooms on campus,
located in Trotter, DuPont, Kohlberg and the fourth floor of
McCabe. Although various classes frequently use the Trotter and
Kohlberg labs, the others are more often vacant, and the council
is looking into moving a few computers from these rooms to computer kiosks around campus.

Additionally, Student Council is examining the possibility of
installing computers and printers in dorms throughout campus.
"Dorm computers are a great idea," council co-president Colin
Moore 'O2 said. Pittenger, in which Moore lives, shares two computers and a printer with Palmer, and he said "the two computers there are constantly being used."
However, according to Tobias, the installation of computers in
every dorm must be considered a long-term goal, because there
are not currently enough computers on campus to allow for this.
Downing and Jacobson will look into receiving funding for the

kiosks and dorm computers from the alumni office, as alumni visitors often use campus computers to check e-mail, Tobias said. Other
possibilities for funding include the admissions office, because
computer stations could improve the image that the college presents to prospective students, and President Al Bloom, whorecently
donated funds for two new computers to be used by staff.
Tobias said the college recently ordered twenty new laptop computers, complete with a central access point station that allows for
wireless ethernet access within a defined radius. Tobias said the
school hopes to become a completely wireless campus at some point.
"You would eventually be able to sit on Parrish Beach and do
your work while connected to the Internet, whichwould be pretty
cool," Tobias said.
Although the computers were purchased primarily for use as
a technologically advanced mobile classroom, Tobias said the
council was looking into the logistics of moving the station to
McCabe at night to allow students to "check out" a laptop to work
on in the library.
"We still have to look into the obvious theft problems that may
be associated with this, but it is still a possibility for increasing
the numberof computers available on campus," Tobias said.

Lauren Tobias, campus life representative, reports Monday to
Student Council on her meeting with campus computer
administrators. They hope to increase computer stations.
SEED FUNDS PROPOSED FOR GROUPS
In other council business, Barron, the SBC treasurer, relayed to
the council the SBC's plan to introduce seed funding for student
groups in their infant stages. Under the current structure, a group
must be chartered in order to receive funds from SBC. Seed funding,
however, would allow new groups to receive funding for meetings
and events before they were officially chartered as a student group.
"Under the new system, a group can come to us with a request
for money to make photocopies to publicize their first meeting. If
they get sixty people, they may decide they want to throw a campus-wide event; seed funding will enable them to get the funds to
do this," Barron explained.
"The idea is that seed fundingwill enable us to get better student
groups at Swarthmore," Barron said. According to Barron, there
are currently seven groups in the startup stages on campus. Of these
groups, five have expressed strong interest in taking advantage of
seed funding. That system, which may be in place by the end of this
semester, would have a time limit of two semesters for the group.
"After two semesters of seed funding, the group must become
chartered if they want to continue to receive budget committee
funds," Barron explained to the council.

Poet shares 'certain peculiar words'
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Galway Kinnell shared vivid words with a packed and captive
audience Monday night, only a fraction of which was students. As
he launched into each poem, prefacing it with a story, a few explanatory words or nothing at all, the Scheuer room remained attentively
silent, save a few contented murmurs of approval or an occasional
collective spell of laughter. The reading, sponsored by the literary
magazine Small Craft Warnings, was funded in large part by a grant
from the William J. Cooper Foundation.
Kinnell's pieces included a compelling portrayal of what he
expressed as "the love of a woman toward her stricken father"
who needs his daughter's help in eating, communicating, even
walking across the carpet where the two used to dance together.
Most of Kinnell's pieces were tidy amalgams of poignancy and
humor, including "Oatmeal," a description of eating hot cereal
at a New Hampshire artists' colony alone yet accompanied by
the imaginary presence of his favorite poets.
"Blackberry Eating" is a 14-line sentence Kinnell read from his
1980collection "Mortal Acts, Mortal Words." Rambling and enjambed,
it is about the luscious experience offruit-eating in September. "The
ripest berries fall almost unbidden to my tongue, as words sometimes do," he read, "certain peculiar words, like strengths or
squinched..." Such unbidden words have touched the hearts and
takenthe breathofhis readers, whomKinnell calls "unmet friends."
The poet began to compose in high school but described his
work "drivel, drivel." He did not begin to publish until his twenties and put out his first book in his thirties.Kinnell received the

Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1983 for "Selected Poems." He has
also shared the American Book Award and been a MacArthur

fellow.
Kinnell's most recent publication, "A New Selected Poems,"
came out in 2000 and includes writing, some revised, from eight
other collections. The poet has been known to rework poems for
years, revising some hundreds of times or never truly finishing.
Besides is own work, Kinnell has published selections of Francois
Villon and Walt Whitmanand has investedhimself in translating the
words of German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, a task he has described as
'one of the most difficult labors I've ever—innocently—undertaken."
He read two such translations on Monday: "Sonnet to Orpheus n,"
which draws on Rilke's upbringing as a girl, and "Swan," which was
recited at the funeral ofaviator Anne Morrow Lindbergh this year.
Kinnell, who is presently Erich Maria Remarque Professor of
Creative Writing at New York University, has instructed students
in creative writing at SUNY-Binghamton and universities in
France, Australia and Iran. He has said he tries to instruct his
students on "special problems" inherent in creating poetry, such
as writing "musically without using meter and rhyme." This goal
comes from the poet's own experiences. In the past he had always turned to structured verse, but felt that "something was
holding me back.
"I began to write in free verse," he said, "and was much happier."
Kinnell believes "you can't teach writing poetry. You can help

an atmosphere in which they want to
write." And if anything can be said for teaching by example, he
certainly did a lot of it Monday night.

Diversity week

Expert discusses intelligence community role
BY JON EHRENFELD
Jennifer Sims, the Deputy Coordinator for Intelligence
Planning in the State Department, spoke on campus yesterday on the topic of United States intelligence. She described
the structure and function of the U.S. intelligence system
and its role in past and present policymaking.
The U.S. intelligence system is composed of a number of
agencies that gather and interpret various types of information. These agencies work both independently and in tandem
to provide intelligence for their customers within the government.
Sims, who has ten years of experience in classified and
unclassified intelligence, spoke about the cycle ofintelligence
between the customers and the agencies and about the types
and uses of the information. She defined intelligence as "the
ability to get something that is critical and get it to the right
place at the right time."
The ultimate goal of all intelligence, she said, is to help
formulatepolicy, and it "improves the decisions ofthe people
you're giving it to."
The intelligence system focuses mostly on the policies
made by the president, the National Security Advisor, and
the Departments of State and Defense. Intelligence is used
not only to inform current policy but also to prepare for future considerations.
The three integral functions of the intelligence system
are timeliness, analysis and dissemination. Thus, Sims said,
information must be gathered when it is still relevant, interpreted correctly, and passed on to the appropriate people
or departments.

A week of performances, parties and poetry is
scheduled for the first annual all-campus Diversity
Week. The programming begins tomorrow at 12:30
in the LPAC cinema with a lecture by Dr. Fernando
Reimer on Latin American poverty and education
issues. The events conclude with a poetry slam on
the night of March 3L
The Intercultural Center has been the biggest
sponsor and organizer of the events, which are designed to be accessible to all students and to reflect
diversity in gender, religion, ethnicity, ideology,
sexual orientation and economic situation.
IC Director and Assistant Dean Anna Maria Cobo
said the IC "prides itself on building a multicultural
environment" and that "Diversity Week is an example of the IC's many programs to enhance
multiculturalism on campus."
The event will officially commence at 4:15 p.m. on
March 25, when Dean of the College Bob Gross will
deliver a keynote address. President Al Bloom and
Alana Price 'O4 will also present speeches on diversity at Swarthmore. During the rest of the week, the
IC and fifteen co-sponsors will present a mix of programs, including a Temple University improvisational group, an alumni "talk show" on the history
of Swarthmore diversity, several lecturers from other
institutions, and a party in Paces next Friday night.

The institution most commonly associated with U.S. intelligence is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The
CIA works abroad, using American case officers to recruit
foreign agents, who provide the CIA with information.
Other sources of intelligence include the National Security Agency, which monitors communications and signals;
the Department of Imagery and Mapping, which works with
satellites; theDefense Intelligence Agency; and open source
intelligence, which deals with unclassified information.
The Federal Bureau of Information protects the information cycle and intelligence agencies and monitors counterintelligence. This is the agency of Robert Hanssen, Sims's
colleague of six years, who was recently arrested for espionage for Russia.
Sims spoke on the history and uses of U.S. intelligence,
which have changed greatly since the Cold War. With many
more nations and groups requiring intelligence monitoring,
she said, the glut of incoming information is at times hard
to keep up with. "It's hard to know who the bad guys are;
they change all the time," she joked.
She described how the intelligence network was restructured after some notable failures during the Gulf War, and
how it has since improved in several areas, including communications with the military.

JenniferSims is the Deputy Coordinator for Intelligence Planning
in the State Department.
Sizing up the role of intelligence today, Sims concluded that,
while intelligence remains crucial for U.S. security and the ideals
of democracy, it must be maintained in such a way that does not
harm the United States or other nations. Citing extra-national
threats such as terrorist Osama Bin Laden, she emphasized the
role of intelligence in protecting the ideals of America.

Administrators meet over break to plan improvements to campus safety
BY IVAN BOOTH E
The college administration has developed a set of plans
to address the growing concerns expressed by students
about campus safety. Over spring break, administrators
came up with six ideas to help increase safety at the college. Dean of the College Bob Gross has met with Student
Council already, and he is planning to meet again next week
in order to present the plan and discuss the specifics.

Vice Presidentfor Facilities and Services Larry Schall,
Associate Dean of the College for Student Life Tedd
Goundie, Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave and
Director of Facilities Management C. Stuart Hain met last
week to discuss the plan.

Existing lighting will be updated and new lights installed. According to Goundie, approximately $25,000 per
year is allocated for campus lighting. Goundie said the

administration was considering putting more lighting
near the train station, the PPR dorms and the fieldhouse
and athletic fields.
Administrators arc also planning to install new tele-

phones on the outside of some buildings. Goundie said the college would forgo the more expensive and intrusive "blue light
phones" for this plan, at least initially. Two definite locations

for the phones include the bottom end of Sharpies and near the
field house. Goundie said other possibilities were the heating
plant near the train tracks, the academic quad near Beardsley,
and on Sharpies 111 next to the fraternity houses.
The administration had also considered installing a phone
at the train station, but Goundie said he was unsure of the
issues between the college and SEPTA. "That one would probably be vandalized once a week," Goundie said wryly.
The college already plans to add improved signs to campus. "One of the signs would be on Magill walk, on [the north
side] of the train station," he said, "and that seems like it would
be a good place for a phone."
An idea already discussed with student council was extending Garnet Patrol hours. Goundie also expressed the
administration's increasing enthusiasm for hiring non-student employees for the patrol. The outside security force would
supplement or even replace the patrol. Twenty-four-hour escorts have been mentioned, as well.

"There's probably not going to be very many people need-

ing an escort at four in the morning," he said, "so they could
be patrolling, too." Shuttle hours may also be extended.

Finally, administrators are looking into installing video
cameras in the area around the SEPTA tunnel and on top

of campus buildings.
"We wouldn't want to waste someone always monitoring that," Goundie said, "but there could be a periodic
checkup on it." In addition, he said, "there would be a
record if something did happen."
Bill Cumby, mayor of the borough, told Student Council in a recent meeting that Swarthmore was also looking
into placing mirrors in the SEPTA tunnel as well as installing increased lighting of their own.
Goundie said most of the campus improvements, when
finally decided upon, would probably take place over the

summer.

So far, the council is pleased with the administration's
response. "They have lots of ideas and are taking this very
seriously," co-president Anna Woodiwiss 'O2 said.

Yearly borough police report indicates slight
increase in crime, improvement in reporting
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
The police department in the borough of Swarthmore
released its Annual Report for 2000 last week, announcing that both traffic and parking violations have decreased from 1999 to 2000.
Although crime rates showed a slight increase, the
report suggested that this was a result of better police

REPORTED
1999

reporting procedures.

The report cited several reasons for the drop in traffic violations. One was the construction of the SEPTA
underpass in 1999, which brought more officers to the
area. This led to more citations, even though the officers' increased presence was not for the sole purpose of
seeking traffic violators.
The other factor in the traffic violation drop was a
new computerized system, ALERT, which is used to better track crime. Warnings and citations are now tracked
separately, with warnings no longer counted as violations.
The drop in parking violations is believed to result
from higher rates of compliance with parking laws,
which the department sees as "encouraging."
For non-traffic violations, such as underage drinking and disorderly conduct, there was a decrease in the
borough of Swarthmore, but an increase in the borough
ofßutledge, which the department also serves.
There was an apparent increase in the crime rate
for Swarthmore, but the report notes that this was not
necessarily due to an actual increase in crime.
The combination of the improved ALERT reporting
system and increased reporting of incidents at the college is a possible reason for the seeming increase in
crime.
The report also noted that Swarthmore continues to

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

SAGER

Decisions demystified
Mistakes are easy to make and hard to fix. Just ask the editors
ofThe Daily Californian and The Harvard Crimson, the college
newspapers of UC-Berkeley and Harvard University.
The Daily Cal's Daniel Hernandez and The Crimson's C.
Matthew Maclnnis recently found themselves apologizing in
their own pages after students protested an ad entitled "10
and Racist
Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery is a Bad Idea
Too," and an inflammatory story about ethnic homogeneity
called "The Invasian" by a "self-hating Asian," respectively. First
attacked by liberals alleging racism, the editors were then
skewered by media critics and conservatives for their apologies.
Here at The Phoenix, a recent column by Lane Oatey (";Dios
mio!", March 1) reimagining the athletics cut as a cut ofanother
oft-stereotyped minority was received with a wave of flyers
alleging racial insensitivity and heated discussion on the Daily
Jolt and in Sharpies. Many students were disappointed by what
they saw as The Phoenix's lack of editorial oversight and later by
the absence of the apology for which many were calling.
Similar incidents have occurred at Brown, University of
Wisconsin, Arizona State and many other college newspapers.
Once again, college campuses and college newspapers have
emerged as the firing line for the ongoing debate about where
free speech ends and hate speech begins.
Simultaneous with this debate, it seems, is a misunderstanding of what the role of a college newspaper should be and what
editorial freedom college editors have. Although college newspapers are not always the most professional media outlets, they do
practice journalism, complete with the standards, ethics and
independence of the professionals.
In their apologies, both Hernandez and Maclnnis cited a
breakdown in the processes by which the paper edits and decides
to publish articles and ads, thereby allowing the ad and the
article to slip through their editorial fingers. Had the lapse not
occurred, they said, the controversial material would not have
been published.
At The Phoenix, as well as at Brown and Wisconsin, there was
no breakdown in the decision-making process. Upon receiving
Oatey's column three weeks ago, an impromptu editorial board
meeting was called to discuss both whether to publish the column
and how to edit it. After over an hour of discussion, the decision
was made to publish the column with minimal editing. The
Phoenix stands by its decision to publish the column, just as the
Brown Daily Heraldand the Badger Herald have stood by thendecisions to publish the anti-reparations ad.
Readers might wonder, how do college newspapers come to
such disparate decisions? Each editorial board is composed of
different people, with differing ideas on how to treat these
situations. Some boards may be more community-minded and
defer (some might say kowtow) to community standards. Others,
like The Phoenix's current board, prefer to heed the call offree

speech.
Although it often seems opaque and rigid, this editorial
decision-making process is far fuzzier than most editors and
journalists would have their readers believe. But what never
changes about the process is the fact that in the end, the decisions
are made not by some abstract principle but by a group offallible
people trying to do the right thing.
Like any paper, the college paper is inextricable from its
community and its readership. Part of the difficulty of editing a

Community papers must print criminals' names
Dear Editor:
Students who commit crimes should have their
names in the paper. Matt Rubin's clear misunderstanding of the basic principles of journalism lead me to think
that perhaps he should not be a member ofThe Phoenix's
editorialstaff. Community papers have a responsibility
to let the members of a community know what's going
on in that community and the fullest way to do so is
to print names.
More than the damage it will do to a student's reputation, the newspaper has an obligation to consider the
seriousness of the crime. It's not like Than Court pulled
a hapless prank like mooning a police officer; he hit a

police officer.

If students, faculty and staff at Swarthmore want
to forgive Court, that's up to each member of the community. But it's ludicrous that we should protect someone who has committed a crime simply because it
would hurt his reputation.

I'm sure that all of those whocommit crimes would

really prefer that their names not be made public. However, journalists believe that those who do newsworthy things should be subject to public scrutiny.

nity, which often inform standards for advertising and editorial
content, with a willingness to challenge its readers at the same
time.

This balancing act is made especially difficult when communication channels between a newspaper and its readers are not
functioning properly. During the discussion of Oatey's column,
The Phoenix received no letters to the editor, and nobody
contacted an editor to voice their concerns. The Phoenix is in
favor of free speech and is happy to publish material critical of
both The Phoenix and views contained within.
To the end of clearing those channels and making the
decision-making process more transparent, The Phoenix will be
hosting a fireside chat next Thursday evening at 8:30, with the
location to be announced. All the top editors will be present to
answer any questions and to address any concerns you may have.
The Phoenix hopes this meeting will help demystify its decisionmaking process and prevent the kind of violent, negative reaction
that marred what should have been an engaging discussion on
the Brown and Berkeley campuses.

Maxman's loss instructive
BY MATT RUBIN
Melissa Maxman won me the easiest
nickel of my life Tuesday night. I made a
bet with a friend that Maxman would lose
her State Senate race to County Executive Ted Erickson and, indeed, she did.
Maxman, not Erickson, made me this
money. In most Delaware County elections like this one, there is no excitement:
the Republicans always win. This time,

however, Maxman gave county Democrats whatlooked like would be their first
close contest in years. Because ofmy new
friend Melissa, I was able to get a hopeful Democrat to bet me that nickel.
Maxman, though, deserves a compliment. She did a really great job misleading her party that she had a chance in the
first place. Never mindthat the county has
about two registered Republican for every
one Democrat; never mind that Democrats
were advertising their nomination at the
polls in November to anyone who would
listen; never mind that she littered all our
mailboxes with countless fliers that just
couldn't have been good for the environment. All Maxman had to do to inspire her
Democratic brethren was to steal Republican issues, constantly presenting herself
as tough on crime and a fiscal conservative. Amazing.
And yet, despite the emotional and financial burden that must have followed
the nadir of her ill-fated candidacy, Melissa Maxman did us all at Swarthmore
College a huge favor. She reminded us
that outside of the borough, we live in a
county that couldn't be more diametrically opposed to this campus politically.
Like any Democrat running for office
here, she lost. It didn't matter that she was
running against Ted Erickson; it could
have been Newt Gingrich, Ronald Reagan,
or even George P. Bush, the sellout
nephew. And yet, despite this reality, we
at Swarthmore rarely stop to think about
where we live and what our environment

is like. Ironically, the conservative
Republican ideology we often shunand
dismiss actually governs us each day.
I don't mean at all to discourage

the Democrats on campus. Indeed,
their efforts on Maxman's behalf were
valiant and impassioned. To see so
many Swarthmore students working
on and excited about a local campaign
was, I thought, really impressive. And
let me tell you, they really did their
job well. Case and point: when I told
my friends that Erickson had won,
most of themsaid, "won what?" I said,
"You know, the election." Blank
stares, all. "With Maxman, you knew
her, she lost?" This, they understood.
One mark of a good campaign is
high name recognition and visibility,
and on this count, the Maxman campaign, especially on campus, was extremely successful. However, the failure of students to even know her
challenger's name was disappointing.
Having been at the polls on Tuesday, I can tell you that quite a few
Swarthmore students are registered to
vote in the borough. So when so many
Swarthmore students are voting in an
election and don't even recognize the
name of the winner of it, I get scared.
And let me tell you, I don't get less
scared when the only things they do
know about him come from distorted,
negative statements and portrayals in
Maxman's campaign literature.
I'm not saying that many of these
students would have even considered
voting for Erickson. It just seems to
me that, considering we are governed

on a daily basis by local Republicans,
maybe we can look justa littlebit into
their affairs, even if it is just another
form of knowing one's enemy. And
maybe this newfound interest and
willingness to acknowledge and listen to conservatives can extend to
campus as well.

Sager a personally enlightening experience
BY TED CHAN
Playing sports in high school, there was always that
rival town that you had to bash. They had absolutely nothing in common with you and they were maybe just a little
bit intimidating. But then one day, you meet someone you
think is cool, really worth making an effort to hang out
with. You sit down, you have some brews, maybe party a
bit with them.And then you ask them where they're from
and they say, "Wayland." Or whatever your rival school
was. At first, you're not sure whether to gag or throw a
roundhouse. But then you start to think of them as a person, a worthwhile one, and you even begin to appreciate
that aspect of their identity.
Of course, this is supposed to be an article about Sager.
Let me disclaim for a moment I'm writing about a very
sensitive topic, one I don't profess to fully understand. So
if I am wrong about something, please let me know gently. I want to learn.
I don't lie very often, but I have lied about going to
Sager my freshman year. I tell people that I did. But I
didn't. I didn't because I was scared, because I was intimidated, and because I really didn't think I liked queer
identity at the time.
There's a lot of people I know, fellas I see every day
and play ball or shoot pool with that could benefit from
going to Sager, although it might take quite a bit of convincing. It's amazing how many inhibitions you can get
over in one night by getting a little tipsy and putting on a
dress. I hope I see some of those guys there, and not just
to stand around and be assholes like a bunch of guys did

Before Sager last year, I never knew much about queer

But afterwards, I wanted to be exposed to more of it, I
Wanted to learn more about it. To be honest, I spent most

of the night standing there nervously while my friends acted
wild.
It wasn't until close to the end that I began to let loose,
feeling less like an outsider, feeling more like the things I'd
hidden away could come out. I allowed myself to be immersed
in what I found different, just for one moment, to feel insecure and try to overcome that, to check out a hottie and find
out it was a guy hey, you grow with that.
Transgress, just for one night, letting go of your boundaries and what your friends tell you to like, and liking what
you like. You start to shed some of those social constructions that hold you back. Sager really helped me as a straight
guy (or so they say) become more comfortable with all things
queer.
I still find it hard. I suppose for me, it's a state of mind,
not an open declaration. I didn't start dressing differently or
hanging out with different people. I wish that in the course
of a day and the things I do, I could encounter more alternative lifestyles. I find myself reading Savage Love and being
actually willing to rate guys in magazines, which I'd never
done before.
This curiosity and openness comes in steps. Who knows

il's
ictionary

where this Sager will take me? This year I want to go to
the symposium, too, in addition to just enjoying the party.
I'm open to suggestions on all of this, whether you know

me or not.
I came to Swarthmore wanting an open mind, not with
one. In the town I grew up in, the parents I grew up with
and the locker rooms I spent half of high school in, it was
hard not to be scared of anyone not straight as an arrow.
It was easy to fear that rival town and not be willing to
take anything from its culture. As for opening my mind,
Sager has been a large step. For those of you who weren't
planning to go, I hope you reconsider. Let down those facades for a night and take on a new character. It could
open a whole new world for you.
I've heard that the people who throw this wonderful
party felt frustration last year. I hear that they were frustrated by male athletes making homophobic comments. I
hear that their efforts were underappreciated. From a
male athlete (among other things), I want to thank Richard Sager '74, the Sager Committeeand SQU from the bottom of my heart for opening my mind and heart, at least a
sliver, to all the richness in your community.

How I learned to stop worrying and love SUV emissions
BY DAVID HAENDLER
Here's a valuable piece of career advice for all you senior Swatties who are just about to leave our beloved ivory
tower. Some of you are planning to go into fields like medicine or law, which are both fine and good, but the real
money is in making gruesome predictions about the imminent destruction of the human race. It doesn't matter what
you say will kill us, or how compelling your data is. You
don't have to have any real data at all. If you go on TV or

publish a book saying that we're all about to be massacred
because of our sins, you are guaranteed to become rich

and famous.
Don't believe me, eh? Just take a look at human history
and you'll see that I'm right. The history books are
crammed to bursting with men who won the hearts and
minds of the mob by claiming that God's wrath was at hand.
Nowadays, science and nature are held up as the engines
ofhumanity's imminent annihilation. In the twentieth century alone, prophets have gotten rich and fat by disseminating fears of genetic degradation, global cooling, overpopulation, underpopulation, biotechnology, asteroid

strikes, water fluoridation and the Y2K bug. The details
vary from year to year, but the underlying message is always the same. Humanity is doing something that is wrong,
and our wrongdoing is going to come back and bite us in
the collective ass.
The really beautiful thing about this line of work is that
you don't have to worry about whether you're right or not.
If you're right, it doesn't matter because we're all dead anyway. And if you're wrong, you can just shrug and say "Bet-

ter safe than sorry" or, even better, say that disaster was narrowly averted because people heeded your all-important message.

Take Paul Ehrlich, for example. According to his alarmist
manifesto, "The Population Bomb" (a seminal work, which
should be studied closely by anyone who fancies a career in
professional scaremongering), global famine should have
transformedAmerica into a Mad Max-esque wasteland years
ago.
The fact that nothing remotely like this has come to pass
does not seem to have slowed him down a bit. Ehrlich, now a
tenured faculty member at Stanford, and is routinely showered with praise and high honors despite the fact that he is no
more accurate than a Magic 8-Ball. To gain fame and fortune
without hard work or accountability is the secret dream of
every Swarthmore student, and Ehrlich has accomplished it
quite nicely. He is a fine role model for anyone interested in
making a good living by scaring people.
Although Ehrlich's anti-overpopulation movement has
fallen on hard times as of late, there's plenty of opportunity
for would-be doomsayers in the exciting new field of global
warming. There is evidence that global warming is taking
place, but the exact causes and consequences ofit are tremendously hard to predict. Science isn't very good at predicting
long-term weather patterns (or short-term ones, for that matanyone else remember how the biggest blizzard in 30
ter
years was supposed to have dumped one to three feet of snow
on us a few weeks back?).
According to Reason magazine, current climate models are
not capable of reproducing the last decade's weather patterns
if you plug in data from 10 years ago. But you'd never know
...

that from the breathless pronouncements of environmental groups or almost-President Al Gore, who do their very
best to give the impression that predicting the long-term
environmental consequences of industrial activity is as
easy as making toast. According to these luminaries, we're
all deader than disco unless we repent from our carbonbelching, SUV-driving ways and embrace the wondrous
new world of wind and solar power (oddly enough, nobody
ever mentions nuclear power as a way to generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases). The man on
the street, not wanting to live in the dystopian future of
"Waterworld" yet not having the time to personally research climate change, tries to learn about the upcoming
catastrophe by buying the books and listening to the advice of the global warming gurus. He doesn't realize that
selling books and appearing on CNN may be the goal of

their movement.
There is a possibility that the activists are right. The
causes and consequences of global warming are worthy
subjects of research, and legislation may be required if it
turns out that industrial activity is creating a serious problem. But there's no reason why we should treat environmental advocates with any more reverence than we hold
for tobacco company spokesmen, corporate lobbyists, or
any other group which profits by its own advocacy. The
next time some self-proclaimed expert shows up on TV
nattering about the latest and greatest way for homo sapiens to destroy themselves, try to keep in mind that these
nattering nabobs have a vested interest in scaring the public and a truly awful track record.

Ad controversy sparks reparations debate
BY LANE OATEY
On the last day of February's Black History Month,
David Horowitz, a conservative author and public speaker,
sent a one page ad entitled "10 Reasons Why Reparations
For Slavery is A Bad Idea and Racist Too" to several major
college newspapers. In the advertisement Horowitz outlined the 10 most common arguments against paying African Americans reparations for slavery. Several of his statements were highly controversial, including those which
claimed African Americans owed the United States for
ending slavery, and those which contrasted average incomes in the United States to those in Africa as proof of
relative economic success by blacks in this country.
Most college papers rejected the ad, calling it politically
unacceptable. Papers that denied the ad include Harvard,
Columbia, Notre Dame and the University of Washington.
As you might imagine, a few schools did end up running the ad. The Daily Californian of the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley printed the ad, as did the Badger Herald
of the University ofWisconsin-Madison.
As soon as the Feb. 28 issue of The Daily Californian
was off the presses, the newspaper headquarters was beset
by protest from a group of Berkley students, with 40 or so
storming into the paper's offices. When shown the ad, the
editors decided to pull the papers featuring it from the
racks. E-mails poured in from angry readers.
The editors of the Daily Californian were embarrassed.
They apparently hadn't followed their standard procedure
in review of advertisements. The next day there was a note
on the front page, with a formal apology for the ad, leading
to a full personal statement regarding the ad written by
the paper's editor in chief, Daniel Hernandez. In the apology The Daily Cal lamented that it had become "an inadvertent vehicle for bigotry." Hernandez attempted, in his
piece, to explain why his paper maintains a general policy
-

against printing such advertisements.
The Badger Herald also printed the ad on the final day
of Black History Month. Protestors held a demonstration
there as well, calling the newspaper racist.
But the editor in chief of the Badger Herald, Julie
Bosman, reacted differently to the protesters. Her staff issued no apology for running the ad. They claimed that it
was their duty as "ethical journalists" to protect free speech,
even when they disagreed with what was being said. In
lieu of an apology for the ad, the Badger staff printed a
statement criticizing The Daily Californianfor its apology.
Subsequently, Hernandez has received a hail ofcriticism.
He's been labeled as just another member of the liberal-leaning press, as racist, spineless and gutless. He's had to defend

MARCH 22, 2001

THE PHOENIX

his apology on the slippery slope that seems to be in opposition
to free speech. An unforgiving national media has showered
all the attention that he never wanted upon him.
Julie Bosman, on the other hand, is sitting pretty atop her
crystal palace of the first amendment, because, after all, how
can anyone argue against the Bill of Rights? Right, Mr. Heston?
The ad that Horowitz sent to the college newspapers contains some very controversial ideas that attempt to contradict
the concept of African Americans being victims of slavery. In
most cases the arguments are unconvincing at best, laughable
at worst. But within the "10 Reasons" are viewpoints that are
commonly held by many Americans. Those who went to the
talk on reparations given by Marcus Alexis last semester, and
who stayed for the question and answer period, will recall that

YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE

POLITICAL LEFT ARE
INDOCTRINATED WITH THE IDEA
THAT OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS
REGARDING RACE CAN BE
DISCREDITED SIMPLY BY LABELING
THE AUTHOR AS RACIST
the question ofcomparing incomebetween actual Africans and
African Americans was raised. It's apparent theviews expressed
in the ad aren't uncommon, even at Swarthmore.

Which leads me to another important point.
True political debate is consistently becoming more and more
difficult to produce on most college campuses these days. Con-

servatives aren't wrong when they say that the political left dominates most colleges to the exclusion of any opposing views.
Swarthmore is a fine example. Young members of the political
left have been indoctrinated with the idea that opposing viewpoints regarding race can be discredited simply by labeling the
author as racist, without actually engaging the opposing viewpoint in rational counter-argument. Caseand point, thereaction
at the Alexis talk to the previously mentioned question.
What has occurred on the Berkeley campus, and the decision
by other large university newspapers, including the University of
Washington, not to run the ad, exposes a weakness within the political left of colleges in this country.
I think that if The Phoenix staff were to receive the Horowitz
ad it should definitely run it. We as a community should have
nothing to fear from political viewpoints we do not agree with.

Horowitz provides in his advertisement the mainstream arguments against reparations for African Americans. Why should
we be afraid of conservative viewpoints?
What we should want to do, if we believe that reparations are indeed justified, is allow men like Horowitz to
lay their cards on the table. There's no need to call anyone's
bluff here. Horowitz laid his ideas on the line. We should
lay down our own views, not try to flip up the table.
Julie Bosman calls the placement of an ad with controversial viewpoints free speech, but the issue is more complicated than that. Receiving money for printing the ad
problematizes her claim. Certainly Horowitz was speaking freely, but it's not like he was a guest editorialist. Access to the forum for free speech was dependent on money,
and accepting money to print an add that a paper could
hypothetically ignore, immediately suggests that the paper condones such viewpoints.
Unless it actively attempts to prove that assumption
wrong, as Hernandez and the Daily Cal tried to do. Unfortunately for them, every step he and his staff took was,
with 20-20 hindsight, the wrong step. Hernandez was trying to backpedal so fast he stumbled and fell.
It was a wrong decision to apologize for printing thead.
He should have said, we printed the ad before we were ready
to provide counter arguments, and for our lack of preparation, we apologize.
I would hope The Phoenix editors would print the ad if
it were sent to them. I would hope that The Phoenix staff
would take the time to break down what parts of the ad we
considered based on racist ideas. I would also hope that
The Phoenix would provide some opinion pieces on the
validity of reparations to accompany the ad.
In my opinion, I don't think that reparations, in the form
of huge grants to be divided up among African Americans,

are ever going to be made. My hope would be that

new and

vigorous investment in African American communities
will be made in the near future. And there's a good chance
that such investment will come from the African American middle and upper class that comes into and out of
schools like Swarthmore. We need to create catalysts for
inner-city investment that will provide the possibility of
economic success for lower income African Americans.
Africans were the victims of slavery. African Americans
are victims of modern problems like poverty, single parent
families, teen pregnancy, urban decay, crime, drugs, violence
and a million other social afflictions. Governmentreparations
are not the answer to current racial economic disparity. The
call for government reparations, simply as a political tool to
extort money from the government, does absolutely nothing
good for the average low-income African American family.

Allow local schools to teach virtue

PAVID ELLIS

OUTSIDE
THE BOX
Like the clones of "A Brave New World," we can all recite that there is a separation of church and state. Despite
this proclaimed truth, a careful examination ofAmerican
history reveals a starkly different story.
The tradition of teaching character and virtue to
America's youth was strong when the Constitution was
written. In fact, five states had official religions. Prayer in
school was common in all states. Did the states ratify a Bill
of Rights in 1791 which was antithetical to their demonstrated value in cultivating virtue in their youth? Certainly
Jefferson (who was ambassador to France when the Constitution was written) was a deistwho strongly believed in
a secular government, but look closely at the composition
of the constitutional convention and you'll see a starkly
religious crowd. The most obvious evidence for this fact is
that a chaplain was appointed for the convention. Would a
body interested in the complete division between church
and state appoint a religious figure to bless its governmentalproceedings?
Not once in any state's debate over the ratification of
theBill of Rights or the Constitution did anyone so much
as mention how the separation of church and state would
alter life in a society where five states had official religions.

Surely, at the very least, the chaplain of the constitutional
convention would have objected when faced with his pending
removal from public life. How could no one object to this massive upheaval of American public life?
The reason, of course, is that the establishment clause in
the First Amendment merely reads: "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion." This clause was
originally intended to limit federal power to control state religions. Recall for a moment the main debate over ratification. Anti-federalists were afraid that the federal government
would assume tyrannical powers over the functionally sovereign states. "No!" the federalists shot back. "The federal government is a body with very limited powers. It can collect
taxes, run the military, and regulate only interstate com-

merce."
My, how the federalists would be shocked by the monster
in Washington now, with its greedy tentacles stretching into

all aspects of states' rights. If the establishment clause had
instead read, "the federal congress shall not interfere with
the states' right to cultivate virtue in the public sphere," no
one in 1791 would have known the difference. The original

intent of the establishment clause was unmistakable: to ensure that the states could continue their religious practices
without federal interference.
So why are local communities prohibited from teaching
their youth virtue? For this we have to thank the Warren court,
an unelected, temporal anomaly that abrogated power from

the national legislature in a startling manner never before
seen in American history. The Warren court successfully
reversed what the founding fathers had in mind with the
establishment clause by incorporating the due process
clause of the 14th Amendment to decide that the establishment clause applied on the state level too. Never mind that
the due process clause of the 14th Amendment was merely
meant to ensure African-American civil rights
never in
its writers' wildest dreams could they have imagined that
this amendment would be used to force the federal Bill of
Rights on the states. It is abundantly clear that in 1791 the
states ratified the idea that the federal government should
not interfere with the states' right to conduct religion. The
Warren court outrageously turned this idea directly on its
head when it decided that the court, with the vested power
of the federal government, had the constitutional power to
stamp out the states' basic right to conduct religion, a right
the people had been taken for granted ever since the first
colonists landed at Jamestown.
Since government is the sole agent in society with the
legitimate power to use force in making people do things
against their will, the founding fathers wisely believed that
political power should be vested as close to the people as
possible. It is the local communities' right, and not
Washington's, to decide what our children are taught, and
with the Constitution as our guide, we can only hope that
a basic tenet of our country will be restored.

of the land and creek.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CRUM WOODS
confronting the issue ofland management, Swarthmore
is not alone among institutions of higher education nationwide. Altogether, land owned by colleges and universities
totals several million acres, including 400,000 acres of forest,
according to estimates in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Richard Evans, superintendent ofthe forestry-experiment stationfor the University ofTennessee System, found that '&t least
61 colleges and universities own and manage forests," the
Chronicle reported in a recent article. Some ofthis land is protected in nature reserves; most of it is logged for timber.
Compared to tracts belonging to other institutions,
Swarthmore's land is relatively unique in its "quality, diversity and proximity to campus," according to a paper authored
by Roger Latham, a former professor ofbiology at Swarthmore.
Latham knows of only two other small liberal arts institutions
Carleton and Connecticut Colleges
whose campuses include nature reserves considerably larger than the Crum
Woods. Williams, Vassar and several other colleges own reserves that are not located near their campuses.
With its varied topography ranging from steep, rocky inclines to flood planes, the woods contains a variety of ecological communities, Latham said in an interview. In addition, parts
ofthe Crum remain mostly undisturbed by introduced species
that have proliferated in forests locally. Latham pointed to a
stand ofRed Oaks, a rare species, south of Crum Creek as an
example of an area that is "inexplicably pristine and diverse,"
with no invasive species and abundant natural vegetation.
"That's unheardofaround the suburbs of Philadelphia," he
said. "To me that makes [the woods] a treasure not just for the
college but for the entire community of Delaware County."
While unusual for any institution to own a tract of landlike
the Crum, Latham said it is "quite rare for a suburban campus." In Delaware County, where major highways cleave the
land into a patchwork of suburban development, the Crum
Woods is one of only a few relatively natural areas remaining.
Claire Sawyer, director of the Scott Arboretum, said the
importance of caring for the Crum can be justified on a number of different levels. But because Swarthmore's mission is
educational, emphasizing the teaching significance of the
woods is key topromoting responsible stewardship of the Crum.
"The way to reach the Swarthmore community is to put
[the value of the Crum] in academic terms," Sawyer said. "If
you have a lab valued at $lO million, you don't leave milliondollar pieces of equipment lying around. That's what we've
said here in terms of the Crum Woods."
As a laboratory, the Crum is worth millionsof dollars. Calculating the dollar value of the woods from the selling price of
similar land purchased nearby, Latham came up with the "conservative" figure of $9.2 million.

In

THE CRUM IN THE CURRICULUM
theSwarthmore professors who use thewoods in their
teaching and research, about half are in the biology department. Both Latham, who was a student at
Swarthmore in the early 1980s, and biology professor Tim Williams said they have seen the Crum used more frequently for
educational purposes over the past 20 years. Latham attributes
this change in part to the growing importance of ecology as a
discipline and the increasing emphasis placed on undergraduate research, particularly for those planning to attend gradu-

a short walk from Parrish, stone buildings and carefully mowed expanses of green lawn abruptly give way to
a forest that hugs the western perimeter of campus from
the athletic fields on one end to DuPont on the other. Follow
one of thedirt paths into the Crum Woods, and the glare of day
is softened by the oaks and maples that form a canopy overhead. Here, the sounds of suburban southeastern Pennsylvania, with its highways and shopping malls, fade into an occasional muted hum. Here, the Crum Creek cuts a meandering
swath through a deciduous forest that is home to a variety of
animals: snakes, rabbits, frogs, deer and great horned owls.
And it is here, too
in the creek that contributes to the
study of pollution control, in the relatively undisturbed areas
of the forest where hundreds of native species thrive, and in
the rippling surface of the water that students seek to render
on paper that the college has an invaluable educational resource, faculty members say.
But this resource, which is used by approximately 12 professors in several departments, faces multiple threats, including invasive species, erosion, and, at least in the past, facilities
development. And despite the importance of the woods to research and teaching, past management plans have not taken
into account the educationalvalue of the land and creek, according to professors. The college also lacks a system that would
allow faculty members toparticipate in management decisions
involving the woods.
To address these matters, a recently formed college committee aims to create a new stewardship plan for the 170 acres
ofcollege-owned landthat comprise the woods. Their task will
involve finding a balance among the sometimes conflicting

in the past 20 years because the passage of the Clean Water
Act led to the reduction of point pollution, or major flows of
waste water into rivers and streams. However, McGarity said
the Crum may in fact be in worse condition than in the past
because it is impacted by non-point pollution, which enters
the creek in runoff from lawns, roofs, parking lots and highways such as the blue route. Non-point pollution can be difficult to eliminatebecause it does not come from an easily identifiable sources. As a result of non-point pollution, the main
goals of Clean Water Act
to make the nation's streams
swimmable and fishable have not been met, McGarity said.
With funding from a state grant, McGarity is working with
four students on projects directly related to non-point pollution in the creek; three students are working on senior engineering design projects to increase water quality and a biochemistry major is studying non-point pollution in the sediment of the Crum. One project, conducted by Marc Jeuland
'Ol, examines the effect of planting bulrushes on reducing
pollution in the stream behind the Mullan Tennis Center. This
experiment, to take place over the next five years, will be

incorporated into the Engineering 63 curriculum, according
to McGarity.
In addition, students in the environmental studies
capstone helped organize last year's Crum Creek Watershed
Conference, which focused on problems in the watershed.
This year's conference, to be held this Saturday in theScheuer
Room, will emphasize potential solutions to these problems.
Students are welcome to attend the conference free of charge,
McGarity said, although they should register in advance.
A related project is McGarity's work withthe Crum Creek
Watershed Partnership, which bring together 12 municipalities in an effort to improve the watershed. The group is currently seeking funding from the state for three projects relating to wetlandrestoration and pollution reduction, McGarity
said. McGarity believes that the partnership will lead to improvement in the condition of the watershed in 10 to 15 years
as municipalities share information with each otherand replicate successful projects.
The involvement of Swarthmore students and faulty in
the project is a "win-win" situation, according to McGarity.
The college will be able to contribute to the health of the creek
and to the larger field of environmental studies by determining how well different restoration systems work; at the same
time, students have the opportunity to study non-point pollution, which "is right on the cutting edge of where water
quality research is in this country," McGarity said.
McGarity also sees the opportunity for cross-disciplinary
involvement in the project, including studying the political
and sociological aspects of municipalities working together.
The use of the Crum for educational purposes extends

beyond the natural sciences, however, to humanities disciplines such as studio art. Randall Exon, professor of studio
art, said introductory classes rely heavily on Crum in their
emphasis on working from experience. "We try to get students out in the world, learning how to draw responsively to
observation," Exon said. Although the area offers many opportunities to work in urban settings, "there is only on the
Crum for observation of nature."
For instance, in drawing and introductory painting
courses, Exon asks his students to paint the reflections in
the water of the Crum, compelling them to grapple with technical issues such as quality of light, color, and perspective.
"It's one thing to draw a city street in perspective," he said.
"It's another to draw the Crum Creek in perspective. The latter is so much more challenging.
"There's theory and then there's nature," he added. "An
awful lot we can learn in the studio, but it's really tested in
places like the Crum."
According to Exon and Merz, the curriculums of the art
history and biology curriculums also enable students who
may be used to urban settings to learn about the Crum and

feel more comfortable there.
Sometimes learning takes place outside the curriculum,
as when Emily Almberg 'O3, co-president of the bios club,
helped organize a night walk in the Crum. The group waded
into the Crum with head flashlights and observed two-footlong eels. When they are young, the eels swim from the Atlantic Ocean to freshwater streams such as the Crum, making Almberg "realize how connected we are to something
larger."

The significance of the Crum also goes beyond education,
students and faculty say. "It's important to have a quiet less
populated place on campus that we can all use when we need

to get away," Valente said. Unlike the Crum, he said, other beautiful spots on campus "almost always have people around."
"My favorite thing is just to walk in the woods," he added.
"I don't think I'm alone in using the woods this way."

And several of those interviewed felt that the Crum should
be preserved simply for its biological significance. "Natural
lands are valuable to me without serving a practical function
to humans," Merz said.

A FOREST IN DANGER

But

the health of the Crum Woods' natural lands
and
thus the area's ability to sustain the its educational and
recreational values faces a variety of threats, accord-

ing to Latham and other faculty members.
These threats are linked to human activities in the area over
the past four hundred years. Once blanketed primarily by mature forest, the area was stripped of trees through logging and
farming that occurred from the late 17th century to the mid-18th
century. The Crum escaped development because its steep slopes
made it difficultto build on, but it has not been immune to other

environmental threats.
A plush mill factory upstream used to dump waste into the
creek that caused the water to run different colors. In the late
1980s, theconstruction of 1-476, also known as the blue route, permanently detracted from the "wild feeling" of the Crum by creating more noise and cutting into part of the forest, according to
Williams. Merz believes that the building of the blue route also
led to the loss of some species from the creek, including fresh
water sponges, probably because ofincreased sediment load.
Currently, invasive species have created a "huge problem" in
the* Crum, Latham said. Settlers brought these species from
Eurasia and introduced them to the area by planting them in
gardens. Removed from their natural predators, some of the introduced species became rampant invaders, changing ecological
conditions and making it difficult for other plants to succeed.
For instance, Norway Maples are killing native plant species
as they infiltrate the woods. "Areas with Norway Maple are
deserts," Latham said. "All they have is Norway Maples." Four
patches in the Crum contain nothing but Norway Maples where
there used to be hundreds of species, and one-third to one-half
the Crum has some maples. A study conducted by students several years ago shows that Norway Maples are spreading by a
couple of yards per year; at this rate they could cover the Crum
Woods in approximately 100 years. The fact that Philadelphia is
an old port city only worsens the problem ofintroduced species,
since non-native plants have had more time to take hold in the
area. Latham said he has noticed increases in some invasive species since he was a student at the college 21 years ago.
.The Crum also suffers from soil erosion, which has created
gaping gullies behind Lang and Cornell, Latham said. Erosion
has been caused by increases in the amount of impervious surface from facilities development. Unable to seep into the ground,
the water gushed down through the Crum, eroding the soil and
dumping sediment into streams. Finally, the development of facilities along the edge of the Crum including the Mullan Tennis Center, Dana and Hallowell and the Lang Music Building
has trimmedabout 10acres from the Crum, according to Latham.
Beyond shrinking the Crum, this development destroys parts
of the forest's "edge," the area along the perimeter of the woods
that preserves the forest environment oflow light and temperature and high humidity while also serving as a buffer against
such outside influences as invasive species. Without this protective edge, the ecologically effective area ofthe woods shrinks.
But Latham said that these problems can be managed in order to ensure that the teaching value of the forest remains intact. In the case of introduced species, the key is to "carefully
target efforts," Latham said, by concentrating on the removal of
harmful invasive such as Norway Maples. Erosion can be prevented by building retention areas to allow waterto drain slowly
rather thanrush down the slopes of the Crum Woods, and existing gullies may be repaired by regrading their steep sides and
planting natural species to hold the soil in place. To prevent detrimental effects caused by the lack of forest edge, Latham advocates the reforestation of the currently open area between a
composting facility west of the Creek and one of the least disturbed areas in the Crum. The college has already adopted some
of these strategies, such as the removal of Norway Maples and
erosion prevention, according to Latham and administrators.
MANAGEMENT ISSUES
the Crum provides important educational benefits, past management plans did not address the teaching significance of the woods, professors say, and there
was no systematic means by which faculty could provide input on management issues relating to the Crum. The Crum is
officially managed by the arboretum, which seeks to main-

Although

tain it as a natural area even though it is highly disturbed in
many areas.
The arboretum staff and a volunteer corps also work together once per week during the winter to do trail maintenance, build barriers against erosion and remove invasive
species, primarily Norway Maples, according to Sawyers.
Nevertheless, there is "very little true stewardship of the
Crum," Sawyers said, because of limited staff and funding resources. There is no full-time manager of the woods and no
funds earmarked specifically for the maintenance of the Crum.
The woods receives lower priority based on the arboretum's
mission, which is to grow and display vegetation "suitable for
planting by the average gardener," according to information
on the arboretum's Web site.
"Having the manpower to protect the woods is something
that... we would like to see happen," Sawyers said.
Society today is more knowledgeable about the need to protect natural resources. "Times have changed, values have
changed, and responsibilities should change," Sawyers said.
Although the college is not in the business of conservation,
Sawyers said, it owns a piece of land, which brings with it

certain stewardship obligations.
The Crum's first management plan, developed by John
Wister in the 19205, focused mainly on the esthetic goal ofbeautifying the forest as well as on providing opportunities for the
study of botany. In the 19705, foresterRonald Langford drafted
a plan that proposed turning the Crum into a money-making
venture through the sale of timber. This plan does not appear
to have been implemented, according to Latham. The current
management plan focuses on erosion control with some attention to the problem of invasive species.
Larry Schall, vice president for facilities and development,
said the college has followed the principles outlined in the
most recent management plan. "There's been a fairly steady
amount of attention to these issues," he said.
For instance, when Kohlberg was built in the mid-19905,
the college created a biostream to slow down the flow of water

rushing to Creek. And the planning of the new science center
involves a "green team" that is looking at two major environmental issues related to the Crum: erosion and birds deaths.
low,
Storm water will be channeled into recharge plazas
depressed areas where it can evaporate and gradually be absorbed into the ground rather than create erosion problem by
flowing down the slopes of the Crum. Rachel Merz, chair of
the science center committee, said the building will be designed to prevent additional runoff problems and to ameliorate existing ones.
The green team is also seeking to prevent bird deathsfrom
the building's large number of glass windows. Birds fly into
these windows because they glimpse their reflections or see
the window as transparent. The team is investigating strategies
such as installing smaller panes or using patterned
glass
to show the birds that the window is a solid surface.
Following recommendations in the 1988 management plan,
the arboretum also began to eradicate the invasive Norway
Maples and has "made visible progress," according to Latham.
Because the woods are a critical teaching resource, "faculty
should be in on the management of the Crum in the planning
and implementation phase," he said. "That is, forever."
But in the 1980s, when the plan was prepared, the importance of Crum for teaching was not as obvious as it is now,
and the firm's contract with the college did not ask it to address the pedagogical value of forest, Latham said. Poor communication between faculty and arboretum and grounds staff
has meant that teaching values are "uncoordinated, and sometimes at cross-purposes with, teaching aims," Latham wrote
in his paper.
Merz said that at times "different elements [have been] operating obliviously to each other, without knowing and understanding what other might prefer about a situation." As
an example, Merz cites an incident that Latham recounts in
his paper. Walking near the Crum one day, Latham encountered Arboretum staff cutting down a liana, or poison ivy plant.
However, the particular characteristics of the plant made it
ideal to refer to during ecology lectures. Although the Arboretum staff is trained in forest management, Latham said their
"goals are not always the same as people who use the woods
for teaching." Focusing on visitor safety, erosion control, and
trail maintenance, the arboretum staff"don't necessarily think
in terms of biological or pedagogical values. I think those both
need to be added to the mix."

TOWARD A NEW STEWARDSHIP OF THE CRUM
considerations may indeed figure prominently in
future management planning. For the first time, faculty
are officially involved in the management of the woods
through theCrum Stewardship Committee, whose goal is to create a stewardship plan for the woods in collaboration with out-

These

side consultants and with input from the college community.
Comprised offaculty, administrators, staffand two students

creek and woods. Formed last year in response to Latham's
paper, the committee is currently in the process of hiring a
consultant from among the four or five firms that have submitted proposals.
an inventory of the Crum to
The committee's first task
determine which areas of the woods are most precious from a
teaching and biological standpoint
will allow the college to
preserve and improve these valuable areas. At the same time,
the study will identify other places in the woods that are of
lower quality in terms ofeducation and science uses, and thus
might be used for development purposes without significant
losses.
For instance, if the college leases land near Chester Road
for a hotel, then the athletic fields may be relocated across
Crum Creek. A path to the other side of Crum Creek could
create major or minimal environmental disturbance, depending on its location in the woods.
Although the future location of the athletic fields hinges
on whether or not the borough and college push forward with

the hotel project, Schall said eventual development on the
other side of the creek is likely to occur. The inventory will
also be useful for those looking for specific species for research
projects. Currently, the only way to locate needed subjects is
through word of mouth or searching in the Crum. The committee will also conduct interviews to determine how people
use the Crum.
"Having a more formal and developed sense of different
values is important," Merz said. "Otherwise, people valuing
it for different things can be working at cross-purposes to one
another unintentionally."
Asked how the committee's work will affect the way development occurs at the college, Schall said, "It will add a step to
the process. It will address considerations we haven't ignored,
but will bring them in a more sophisticated way."
According to committee chair McGarity, the stewardship
committee will examine administrative structures for coordinating uses of the woods and promoting better stewardship
of the area. The committee will seeking funding from the college to support the study, which will last about one and a half
years, according to Schall.
A PROPER BALANCE
of the major challenges facing the committee will be
to achieve a balance between different uses of the

One

Crum.
"We've got to find the right mix of uses that enables us to
make use of property but also preserve it," McGarity said,
while also acknowledging that there are "significant education uses of the Crum we need to recognize" and that "education will be weighted more heavily than in past."
Latham said he believes that the education and biological
uses of the are intrinsically linked to the college's pedagogical mission and its commitment to social responsibility.
"Teaching and environmental quality come first and other
uses in my mind come second," said Latham, who feels
strongly that the college must have a full-time Crum steward
with a background in biology "to coordinate all management,
volunteer, and teaching activities" in the Crum Woods. The
feasibility of such a position would depend on college funding
priorities, Schall said.
Merz wants to find out if people think the Crum is valuable because of possibilities for development. "I'm more interested in how people value Crum for its potential than I'm
concerned about any one development plan."
She added, "Natural lands once developed don't go the other
way. Any change we make along those lines should be done
with forethought and pretty open discussion"
Asked how he sees thebalance of different uses, Schall said
that while building creates some environmental problems, he
believes that "there's a potential for confluence at some level."
For instance, a bridge across the Crum, located so as to create
minimal environmental impact, "can be positive for how
people use the woods for teaching and ecological reasons."
Schall said the college would not build in an area deemed "absolutely precious" for teaching and scientific reasons.
"Obviously, we can't stop building, but I think we can do
so in sensible ways," he said.
Meanwhile, faculty and administrators say that the work
of the committee is an important step toward improved stewardship of the Crum, and Latham said he was pleased with
the support of Schall and the administration.
And there will be a chance for others to express their views
on how they feel the Crum should be used. "There will be an
opportunity for anyone who values the woods to be involved,"
McGarity said.

This year's Oscars: lots of misses,
but you'll probably watch anyway
BY DANIEL MARRIN
Ah, the Oscars, that time when Hollywood spends a gazillion
bucks on parties, outfits and limousines, all to give itself a pat on
the back. This year, the nominations are even predictable, based
on the films' profits. At the same time, in smaller categories, some
films that have hardly been available to be seen are being honored.
For Best Picture, we have Lasse Halstrom's "Chocolat," Ridley Scott's "Gladiator," Steven Soderbergh's "Erin Brockovich"
and "Traffic," and Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
I was surprised by "Brockovich" and "Chocolat," but both have
been crowd-pleasers. Philip Kaufman's "Quills" and Cameron
Crowe's "Almost Famous" would have been preferable in these

spots, neither being blockbusters, but both with strong responses
from audiences and critics.
The Best Director category is filled with small absurdities.
Besides the strangeness of Soderbergh being nominated twicefor
Best Director, Stephen Daldry has been nominated in this category for "Billy Elliott," a film aBHHBHH^
denieda Best Picture nomination, while Lasse
Halstrom is denied a Best Director nomination
for "Chocolat." Given the current situation, I'd
give the awards for Directing and Best Picture
to Soderbergh for "Traffic," but I also wouldn't
be surprised if "Gladiator" wins Best Picture.
For Best Actor, we have old pros Tom
Hanks, Geoffrey Rush and Ed Harris nominated, along with younger entries Javier
Bardem for "Before Night Falls" and Russell
Crowe for "Gladiator." Strangely, Harris' "Pollock" will only begin to be available now, after
the Oscar "season" has already ended. Performances that could have been honored with nominations
instead of, for example, Hanks and Rush, who have already won
include Ralph Fiennes' heartbreaking work in "Sunshine" and
Ben Stiller for "Meet the Parents." Having only seen "Quills" and
"Gladiator" out of the nominations in this category, I would give
the award to Russell Crowe, to recognize his range.
As for Best Actress, the two most acclaimed and raging female
performances this year were that of Julia Roberts in "Erin
Brockovich" and Bjork in "Dancer in the Dark." With Bjork
snubbed in favor of Juliette Binoche, who has done work far superior to "Chocolat" in the past, Julia Roberts is the obvious
choice, unless Laura Linney pulls a dark horse victory for "You
Can Count On Me."
For Best Supporting Actor, nominations went to Benicio del
Toro in "Traffic," Willem Dafoe as a vampire-cum-actor in
"Shadow of the Vampire," AlbertFinney for "Erin Brockovich,"
Jeff Bridges as the president in "The Contender" and Joaquin
Phoenix for the emperor in "Gladiator." I admired the rapport
between Finney and Roberts, but more than that, I liked the sheer
range of Joaquin Phoenix this year, playing one minute an evil
emperor and the next, the earnest priest of "Quills." I might
give it to Phoenix rather than Benicio del Toro, because "Traffic" is such an ensemble picture that it doesn't really belong to
any one actor.
"Billy Elliott" and "Almost Famous" scored with Best Support-

ing Actress nominations, yet neither nomination signals what
truly made the films great. Jamie Bell, the young dancer of "Billy
Elliott," was the actor that made the film work, not Julie Walters.
Likewise, whileFrances McDormand performed admirably in "Almost Famous," her role was marginal compared to those ofPatrick
Fugit, Billy Crudup and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Instead of
Walters and McDormand, I would have nominated Kate Winslet

for "Quills" or the brave Erika Christensen of "Traffic." Given
the current competition, the obvious choice is Kate Hudson for
"Almost Famous."
Sheer originality, an idea outside of cliches or real-life stories,
is what defines a great Original Screenplay. The best original
screenplay of the year, totally ignored by awards, was Jim
Jarmusch's "Ghost Dog," the tale of an black Mafia hit man who
follows the code of the ancient Samurai. Given the current competitors, the winner should be Cameron Crowe for "Almost Famous."
A great adapted screenplay takes original material beyond expectations, and this is a truly neglected category this year. "0 Brother, Where Art Thou,"
one of the most overrated films of the year,
should have been replaced here by "Quills."
In addition, if the dialogue from "Crouching
Tiger" had been in English, it would have
been one of the year's corniest movies. This
place should go to David Selfs dynamic Cuban missile crisis drama "Thirteen Days."
With the current competition, the award
should go to Stephen Gaghan for "Traffic."
Finally, the most inconsistency and handicapping comes in foreign and documentary
films, with obvious choices surrounded by nonames. Besides the acclaimed Holocaust documentary "Into the Arms of Strangers," there is a nearly unseen
tale of post-apartheid South Africa, a history of Scottsboro, Ariz.,
a film about a controversial technology that ends deafness and a
tale of a family coming apart called "Legacy." I think that the Academy should require all of its nominees to be given at least a twoweek run in major theaters, if they really do merit an Oscar nomi-

nation.
In foreign films, "Crouching Tiger" is surrounded by nonames. Conspicuously missing is Giuseppe Tornatore's
"Malena," an Italian film nominated for Best Cinematography
and Best Score. The other three places could have gone to the
year's acclaimed foreign films, like the Dogme romantic comedy
"Mifune," Chinese critical favorite "Yi Yi," and Wong Kar Wai's
romance "In the Mood for Love." Everyone knows "Crouching
Tiger" will win, but we could have sustained the suspense by
putting it among equals.
The year 2000 was not an awful year for films. It was an awful
year for faith in films. Films with major talent, but more complex or less sensational themes, were moved to the art house,
while mediocre films guaranteed to draw a teen crowd got immediate national distribution and widespread advertising. (Anybody remember "Dude, Where's My Car?"?!) The Oscars are nominating mostly big hits, but they could have been a little less predictable. Still, only one thing's for sure. The stars will be out
this March 25.

Frank Martinez, who knows some people on Student Council, calculates the height of Clothier Bell Tower using only a protractor, high school trigonometry and his sheer intellect.

TOWER POWER
BYTraNK MARTINEZ

By now, you've all seen the Student Council's signs
around. "How can Student Council improve your life at
Swarthmore?" the signs ask. "Open the Tarble bell tower,"
I say.
This one simple change would improve life at Swat so
much. Hey, this is the Living and Arts section of the paper,
and an open bell tower will affect both of those aspects positively. Students will certainly live better as a direct result
of the relaxation and pleasure derived from the great view
way up top. And the arts will be better
every drawing or
photography student will now have the opportunity to
sketch or snapshot our lovely landscape from a bird's eye
view.
Why is the bell tower closed anyway? Lots of stupid
reasons, I bet. In the last Student Council meeting, it was
brought up that there may be a lot of bat dung up there.
That's lame
I'll gladly scrub some flying-rodent turds
in exchange for the fantastic view of downtown Philadel-

phia.

There is also the suicide rumor. As the myth goes, a
female student in the sixties was so distraught after not
getting into a sorority that she killed herself by jumping
from the bell tower. Ended it all, thus ensuring that every
future Swarthmore student wouldn't have the chance to
do the same. Ifthe administration does not let people up in
the Tower because it fears that we will take our lives, that

is just absurd. If somebody really wants to kill himself, he's
going to find a way. If I end my miserable life by jumping off
the roof of Hicks, are all of the engin students simply out of
luck? No, that would be silly. Just as keeping the bell tower
closed is silly.
Going up the tower would be so great. The view would be
amazing. You could see everything on campus; it would give
everyone a different perspective. I'll bet you could see three
states, at least: New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. The
Philly skyscrapers would be nothing short of magnificent.
Downtown's Liberty One is 945 feet tall.
The Bell Tower is tall, too. I have done some crude calculations involving a protractor and some simple high school trigonometry. The Bell Tower, by my estimation, is between 83.9
and 19.2 feet tall. That's high! Who doesn't love going up the
tallest thing in sight? Open the Bell Tower, and we can do it.
I am not suggesting that the Tower be simply opened to
anyone at any time. Probably nighttime is a bad idea. Maybe
just a few days a month or something. We could even have the
Public Safety guys present to provide proper supervision. That
seems reasonable to me.
The Tarble bell tower must be opened. As keenly and succinctly scribbled on that blue three-by-five card in the upper
corner of the Sharpies bulletin board, it would improve the
quality of student life more than anything. I have already begun a campaign to implement this proposition. We need to let

Student Council know that the student body really cares
about this cause.
Does Student Council really care about us? Are they
really students, or just politicians who don't deal withreal
day-to-day issues? Does anybody even really know our representatives? And how prepared are they to deal withthis
pressing, life-affecting bell tower issue?
Co-president Anna Woodiwiss was on my hall freshman year. And I talked with Poulami at a party once
(but she has since betrayed me, by going to Screw with
my friend and teammate, Scott Kushner). With the exception of these few representatives with whom I am
loosely acquainted, the council is just a bunch of people.
And those people claim in colorful construction paper
letters to actually care about my views, and have even
provided me with cheerful index cards on which I can
freely voice them. We should take advantage of this opportunity.

So e-mail our Student Council. Tell whomever you know
on the council that you want the bell tower opened. They
have already heard from at least a dozen students, in addition to the original dude who paused long enough before
dinner to express his burning desire. Our student cry cannot go unnoticed. But if we want to enact change to get
what we want, we can't let up. Make it heard: open the
Tarble Tower.

Irish landscapes more
intoxicating than NYC
on St. Patrick's Day
BY KATEY O'DONNELL
There is something about Ireland that seems to inspire poetry whether that inspiration be the Hallmarkkind or the Van
Morrison kind or the truly spiritual kind. And that poetry isn't
necessarily expressed through written word. It can be about music and stories and memories and landscapes. Such poetry lives
within the Irish landscape features in the current List Gallery
show, "Passages from Ballinglen."
You may be wondering why it took me so long to get around to
reviewing the show, but with St. Paddy's Day having just passed
and all ofAmerica still feeling a little bit Irish, I figured now was
the perfect time to discuss it.
The show features the work of a dozen artists who come from

all over Europe and America. They are linked by a common reverence for the County Mayo landscape, which they have distilled

and expressed in a variety of mediums and styles. From black
and white photographs to jewel-toned watercolors, from murky
opaque greens to highly varnishedmuted oil palettes to charcoal
drawings and intaglio prints, all of the art portrays the elemental power in the observed patterns of nature. The pieces engage
more senses than sight, encouraging total immersion in the awesome forces they express.
All of these works have in common artists who have noticed,
explored and discovered both the natural grandeur and the subtleties of the wind, rain, sunshine, earth and rock of this pocket of
Ireland. These works exist because the artists noticed the subtletiesof the space, the light, the weather, and discovered the magic

of utter awe at having noticed and explored the natural the
taken for granted, the basic, the primordial. This has been siphoned and personalized on two-dimensional surfaces that, for
all their differences, are drenched with a natural energy that is
untamable even on canvas.
An appreciation of the energy of these works comes to the
observer the same way these artists learned to appreciate their
natural surroundings. Keith Wilson, one of the featured artists,
says the observer is "encouraged to stop, listen, and watch the
world. A healthy kind of daydreaming. It's good to sit and think,
though often I feel it may be more rewarding to just sit and absorb."
Don't think. Don't use your head. Release your senses. Allow
these works to speak to you. To draw you in. To bring you the
magic of Ireland. To completely immerse you in their poetry. To
intoxicate you, not in that post-Guinness sort of way, but in that
spiritual, high-on-life's-grandeur, humbling sort of way.

Pitt's photogenic 'Mexican'
BY ESTER BLOOM
At the heart of "The Mexican" is a much-sought-after firearm whose history is as colorful as the gun itself is gorgeous.
Despite the fact that it's composed of the finest, most beautiful materials available and is pieced together with care, it
does not work. That's a plot device; but it's also a convenient
metaphor for the movie as a whole.
Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts star in this action-comedy as
Jerry and Samantha, a couple on the rocks. They've already
broken up by the opening credits, and Jerry is frisking
through Mexico while Samantha is on her way to Vegas. Jerry
has been hired to locate and retrieve the pistol. Samantha
wants to pursue her dream of being a card dealer.
Naturally, there are problems. First of all, Jerry can barely
speak English, let alone Spanish. Plus, he has bad luck. A
stray bullet kills his Mexican contact, and then his car gets
stolen. So he trades his watch for a filthy pick-up truck, complete with a rabid dog, and races after the thieves.
Meanwhile, Samantha is accosted in a women's room by a
hitman. Apparently some of the men in charge don't have complete faith in Jerry's ability, so Leroy (James Gandolfini) has
been hired to use her as a hostage to make sure that everything goes as planned.
Samantha is made to look as annoying as Jerry is dim, so
why she earns Leroy's sympathy is unclear. But before long,
the two have bonded and are sharing intimate details of past

relationships. One of the most interesting and noteworthy
twists in the film, which Samantha discovers gleefully, is that
Leroy is queer. It thrills her because it explains why, when
she asked whether he was going to rape her, he showed no
interest at all.

He's a much cooler character than Samantha and a near-

novelty in American cinema, as he has no typical "gay" mannerisms and isn't asexual. Unfortunately, he isn't the focus of
the film. The spotlight continually returns to Jerry's misadventures in Mexico as he finds the gun, loses it and finds it
again, ad nauseam. Along the way, he learns more of the story
behind the gun's creation, which unspools in nifty sepia-toned
flashbacks.
For the most part, "The Mexican" isn't bad, and sometimes,
when it gets rolling, it's fun. Pitt makes Jerry bearable, which
is a real credit to him because he's given almost no good lines
to work with. He and Roberts spend relatively little time tofor some reason, though, they make such
gether onscreen
a passionless, implausible couple that this isn't a problem.
Possibly their lack of chemistry stems from the fact that whenever they're together, they're squabbling over petty things.
But the movie's message, as first stoutly delivered by

Leroy and subsequently ground into their (our) heads, is that
when two photogenic people love each other, they must never
stop trying to make it work. Even, it seems, at the expense

"Down in the Delta," a touching family drama, stars Alfre Woodard as a
drug addict and inept mother who is shipped off the streets by her own
mother to get straight in the heart of the South. In Mississippi, with her
distant relatives, she begins to turn over a new leaf, letting go of her big
city, drug-ridden ways. Loretta eventually gets clean and simultaneously
reconnects with her relatives, her roots and, most importantly, herself.

TO
DO

Mike Judge, creator of the infamous
duo, Beavis and Butthead and "King
of the Hill," brings his hilarious wit
to the big screen in a surprisingly
intelligent, riotous commentary on
office life. "Office Space" details the
dull, dull days of Ron Livingston's
office drone, who dreads going
to work and is miserable in every aspect of his life. Miser
able, that is, until a certain encounter with a hypnotist that

leaves him apathetic about his job
and work, in a perpetual state of
JackAss. When the office consultants find out, they interpret his new
blase attitude as exactly what they
need to revamp their workspace
management, not as ample reason to
can him, as he had been hopefully
anticipating. For a few pre-Sager, or
mid-Sager, laughs, catch this funny
flick Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. and
10:00 p.m. in LPAC Cinema.

Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso meet in Steve Martin's comedy "Picasso at
the Lapin Agile" appearing on the Arden Theatre's F. Otto Haas Stage. Set in
1904, the play presents Picasso and Einstein on the brink of greatness. Einstein
is a year away from publishing his "Special Theory of Relativity," and Picasso
is just three years from painting "Les Demoiselles D'Avignon." The men meet
in a bar; hilarious antics and entertaining conversation ensue. The "discussion of the century" plays at the Arden Theatre (940 N. 2nd St, Philly) until
April 1 Evening and matinee showtimes vary by date. Tickets run from $22-34
with a whopping $2 student discount. For more information or to purchase

Ultimate men prove skill with comebacks
RECENT

BY JEREMY SLEZAK
The Swarthmore men's ultimate
frisbee team recently completed a 10-day
spring break training session that included weekend stopovers in Atlanta
and Savannah, Ga., for high-octane competitive play and a week of practice on
the sunny, sandy shores of the Gulf of
Mexico near Panama City, Fla.
On March 10, playing on minimal
sleep after a 13-hour van ride to Savannah, the Earthworms showed a combination of intensity, skill and the occasional rust to notch a 3-1 record after

Saturday play. The team shut out
Windsor, a beginning high school team,
13-0 to begin the day strong.
The next game came against one of
the country's top 10 teams, Winona State.
After starting slowly, the Earthworms
trailed at halftime by a score of 7-1. However, both the heart of the team and the
intensity began to shine through as the
Worms stormed back to bring the game
to 11-10 and the Winona State sideline
nervously to its feet. Unfortunately, the

comeback ended there when Winona
State scored on successive points to put
the game away.
The third and fourth games of the day
against College of Charleston and
S.U.D.S. again showed Swarthmore's
ability to come from behind. After trail-

ing 4-1 early in the Charleston contest,

the Earthworms ran off a run of five

points in a row, then closed the game
fairly easily.
In the S.U.D.S. match, Swarthmore
had its backs against the wall, trailing
by a score of 12-8 in the game to 13. With
its never-say-die demeanor, the Worms
continued to claw and fight their way
back, amazingly scoring the last six
points of the game, capped by a connection from Brandon Silverman 'O2 to
Galen O'Toole 'O2 in the near corner of
the end zone to take the match 14-12.
Other highlights of the day included
several huge layout defensive blocks by
Silverman and Paul Wulfsberg's 'O3
usual jaw-dropping grabs as he once
again "muled" an opponent.
In the single-elimination bracket on
Sunday, Swarthmore played a confident,
fast, athletic University ofVirginia team
that also got off to a fast startagainst the

Earthworms. Swarthmore put in great
efforts, stabilized by the handling abilities of James Muspratt 'Ol and Daniel

Schwartz 'O2 and hot defense from Matt
Davis 'Ol to once again bring the game
back within reach before falling 13-10.
In a consolation game against Colum-

bia University, Swarthmore's primarily

rookie line put in a great showing that

featured inspired play from Tim
Applebee 'O2 and Daniel Marrin 'Ol.
Jared Lenow 'O3 also recorded an unequaled feat, being called for an offensive foul three times over the course of
a 10-second period.
The week of practice and sun was a
combination ofhard work and fun bonding time with the men's and women's

ultimate teams in an attempt to prep
Swarthmore for one more weekend tournament. Terminus, one of the most competitive tournaments of the year, featured most of the top teams in the nation, and despite a losing record, the
Earthworms played competitively
against this competition. Highlights of
the Terminus tournament included outstanding grabs by the "Twin Towers,"
Wulfsberg and Collin Peng-Sue 'O3, on
successive points, and more hot defense
from Al Bui 'O2 and Ben "Ben Ben"
Hamilton 'O3.
Upcoming tournaments for the Earthworms include a two-day tournament at
Lehigh University this weekend and a
tournament at Haverford on Parent's
Weekend.

From BASEBALL, pg. 24
In the bottom of the sixth, with two runners on,
the score still tied at three apiece, and the time limit
expired, Lane Oatey 'O3 launched a double to the
fence to score Francisco Martinez 'O2 and John Konits
'O4 for the game winning runs. The team rushed the
field and tackled the heroic Oatey in celebration of
the dramatic win.
The home opener against Neumann college was
not quite as fruitful. Shaky defense in the early innings gave Neumann an early 8-0 lead. A strong relief effort from James Zvokel 'O4 allowed the Garnet
close the gap a little, but not nearly enough as the
final score was 10-4. Kushner singled and scored in
the game to stretch his hitting streak to 11 games
(dating back to last season). Sconce, who has hit
safely in each of his first five collegiate games, went
l-for-2 with two RBIs, bringing his season batting line
to 8-for-14 (.571).

Men's lax stumbles during break
BY MIKE LLOYD
The Swarthmore

men's lacrosse

team dropped two games against tough
opponents over spring break. On Saturday, March 10, the Garnet Tide lost
to Goucher College 11-7, and a weeklater
Swat fell to Skidmore 12-9 in a muddy

see-saw battle.
On the first day of spring break, the
Goucher Gophers traveled to Clothier
Field intent on avenging last year's 109 triple overtime loss at the hands of
the Garnet. Unfortunately, this year's
game was not the thriller that last
year's game turned out to be.
Swarthmore came out flat against a
feisty Goucher team. The Gophers controlled the momentum throughout the
game and theiroffense was able to take
high percentage shots that left all but
the final score in doubt going into the
fourth quarter.
Co-captain Blake Atkins 'O2 won 15
out of 16 faceoffs and tallied two goals
and an assist to help the Swarthmore
cause. Also lighting up the scoreboard
for the Garnet was Joseph DeSimone 'O4
with two, while Mark Dingfield 'Ol contributed one goal and three assists.
The men's team was defeated by the
Skidmore Thoroughbreds in a home
contest March 17. On a muddy Clothier
field, the Swarthmore offense struggled
to get quality shots against a stingy
Skidmore defense. Coming off a twogame team suspension, Than Court 'O3
managed to net three goals to lead the
Tide. Both Atkins and Murphy contributed two goals and one assist.
However, nine penalties by
Swarthmore kept the ball in their defensive end for most of the game. Goalie
C.J. Riley 'Ol had a standout game with
a career-high 16 saves, stopping several
one-on-one opportunities by the Thoroughbred attackers. With two assists

against Skidmore, Dingfield brings his
season total to six, and his career total
now rests at 50.
This week the Garnet Tide travels to
Connecticut to take on Wesleyan University in an non-conference matchup. Currently Wesleyan's record stands at 3-0

Track teams travel to FSU to
prepare for outdoor season
Distance runner Joko Agunloye finishes 5000 meter with NCAA
provisional qualifying time of 17:4616 at Snowbird Invitational
The outdoor track team spent its spring break at Florida State University preparing for the spring sports
season.
The team always enjoys heading south to train. "The warm weather means conditions are more conducive
to running good times and workouts," noted Marc Jeuland 'OL
The effects of the warm weather were certainly evident in the team performances at Florida State's Snowbird Invitational, which followed the week of training. Jeuland placed fourth in the men's 1500-meter with a
time just below four minutes. In the women's 1500-meter, Claire Hoverman 'O3 finished at an impressive time
of 4:59.30, and in the men's 110-meterhigh hurdles, Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 notched a time of 16.36. Ambrose Dieringer
'Ol ran one of his fastes times since freshman year in the 800 meters in 2:04.09.
The most remarkable performer of the weekend was Joko Agunloye 'Ol, who finished third in the women's
5000-meter with an NCAA provisional qualifier mark of 17:4616. The time was also a Swarthmore school
record.
Head coach Peter Carroll said, "It's very unusual to get a provisional qualifying time so early in the season." With her outstanding performance at the Snowbird Invitational, Agunloye has become an exciting athlete to watch in women's long-distance running this season.
Jeuland, Hoverman and Ntoso also hope to duplicate last weekend's performances at future tournaments.
Sarah Jay 'Ol, who, with a time of 4:55.97, finished 14th in the women's 1500-meter at the NCAA Division 111
Indoor Nationals over spring break, promises to run to those standards in the coming outdoor season. Athletes to watch in the field events include Randy Keim 'O2, Mat Rapoza 'O3, Justin Pagliei 'O2 and Clara Fuchsman
'OL Sprinter Erik Munroe 'Ol is among the promising newcomers.

SOFTBALL

After a tough, hardworking ten days, the Swarthmore
women's tennis team emerged from spring break with a
hard-earned 3-2 record.
Of the four games the team played in California,
Swarthmore won two by decisive margins, beating Occidental College 7-2 and Cal-Lutheran University 8-L The two
losses were much closer, with Swarthmore falling 4-5 to
both Chapman University and Washington University.
Upon returning home, the women bounced back and started
their regular season on a strong note, defeating Washington College 7-2 in an away match.
Swarthmore was led by captain Jennifer Pao 'Ol and
Anjani Reddy 'O4, who finished 4-1 and 5-0 overall in singles
play, respectively. Also finishing undefeated at 5-0 was the
doubles team of Reddy and Caroline Celano 'O4.
The 7-2 conference demolition of Washington College on

The Devil went down to Georgia
Warmothers take home trophy at First Wave tourney, finish fifth at intense Terminus Invitational
BY CAROLYNN LAURENZA

Early Monday morning the women's ultimate frisbee team returned tired
but happy after a very successful spring break. The Warmothers started out
the week by winning the First Wave tournament in Savannah, Georgia. Swat
beat Yale twice, double-avenged a fall season loss to UVA, shut down Rochester
and Winona and easily defeated Columbia University on the way to the title.
To prepare for the next weekend's more intense tournament the prestigious Terminus invitational in Atlanta, the team drove down to Florida for

five days of double session practices in Port Saint Joe. Amidst hurricane
warnings, thunderstorms and "SUCK IT!" calls, the team came together: the
hard work paid off in Georgia. The Warmothers made a strong showing on
Saturday: Despite breaking her pinky finger in the first game, Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol led the team to big wins against University of Illinois and Duke.
The all- star veteran starting line of Goldsmith, Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol, Ashley
Demello 'O2, Sara Gravelin 'O2, Sarah Kates-Chinoy 'O2, Julia Trippel 'Ol and
Sierra Curtis-McLaine 'O2 astounded onlookers with their flow and cohesion.
They then played their hearts out against UNC-W, the number two ranked
team in the country, with highlights in Hoedeman's numerous near impossible lay-out catches and Demello's toe-only-in-bounds-three-feet-off-theground layout catch in the end zone. They ended up losing by three, then lost
to Tufts, but came back to beat Duke soundly. Second year vets Alyssa Bell
'O3, liana Luft 'O3, Carolynn Laurenza 'O3, Sarah Stanton 'O3, and Marah
Gotscik 'O2 came off the bench to contribute hot play this weekend as they
stepped up to sacrifice their beautiful bodies for the sake of the disc.
In the semi-finals on Sunday the Warmothers faced the famed Carleton
College, winners of last year's National Championship. It was an intense,
hard-fought game that Swarthmore lost 14-11, but the Warmothers' play gained
them the respect of the other teams, the tournament directors and the spectators. With their patented unstoppable zone offense, the game featured the
scoring highlights of Trippers hammer throw to Curtis-McLaine in the zone,
Hoedeman's flying overhead grab and Laurenza's big layout score early in
the game. The team went from there to beat Michigan and come in fifth overall in the tournament.
Also deserving mention is David Paideia's 'O4 mother, for whom both the
men's and women's teams hold a great love, as she housed and fed all 46
frisbee Swatties over the weekend. The Warmothers will travel again this

weekend to Wilmington, North Carolina for the acclaimed and competitive
Easterns tournament.

Sun, beach and sand, but no lacrosse
After a play day in Panama City, Fla., the Garnet women
returned home to rainy days and game cancellations
BY KATIE CLOONAN

Expectations were as high as the temperature when
the women's lacrosse team arrived in sunny Pensacola,
Fla., for their week of spring break training. After a short
plane ride and van trek, the women settled in for a week
of serious spring training at the fine establishment suitably named the Flamingo Motel in Panama City, Fla. As
tempting as the beach and surf were, the Garnet spent
much time at not-always-nearby practice complexes perfecting their game.
On Monday, March 13, the Garnet took on a variety of
opponents in a palm-tree-surrounded roundrobin "play day."
Valuable experience was gained after playing teams such
as Oneonta State, St. Lawrence, RPI, Salve Regina and New
Haven. Additionally, the team bonded through skit performances, beach runs, van rides and team dinners.
The Pennsylvania weather that greeted the team upon
arrival back in Philadelphia fell short of Florida's balmy
high 70s. Unfortunately, the inclement weather forced the
postponement of the March 17 game versus Messiah College and yesterday's game at the College of Notre Dame
of Maryland. With the postponements of the two games,
the Seven Sisters Tournament at Haverford this weekend
will be the first true test for the Garnet. After finishing
third last year with a quadruple overtime loss to crosstown rival Haverford in the second round, Swarthmore
has been seeded third. The Tide will face unseeded Mt.
Holyoke College Saturday, March 24. Depending on the
outcome, the Lady Laxers will face either the winner or
the loser of the Haverford/Trinity (Ct.) game at 3 p.m. The
tournament wraps up on Sunday, where the Garnet will
have one contest, the time and opponent to be determined
by Saturday's action.
Led by captains Natania Kremer 'Ol, Kristen English
'Ol and Katie Tarr 'O2, the team looks to prove itself both
regionally and within the Centennial Conference, which
includes three teams currently ranked in the top 20 in this
week's IWCLA Division 111 Women's Lacrosse poll. The
women's lacrosse team takes the field for the first time at
home Wed., March 28, in their home and conference opener
against Washington College. Game time is 4 p.m.

Men's tennis all business in California
BY FRANK VISCIANO
Spring Break! Spring Break? Break? Not really. For the
men's tennis team, there were no lusty late-night makeout sessions with beer bottles, no drunken haze, no lazy
hours at the beach. In search of tough competition and a
little sunshine, the team headed for northern California,
where they matched up against teams from UC-Berkeley,
UC-Davis, Foothill College and Sonoma State.
With no time to sip wine or frolic with the hippies, a
mildly jetlagged Swarthmore team headed for Berkeley
prepared to play. With no more than five minutes to acclimate and readjust to the nuances of outdoor tennis, Swat
grabbed a surprisingly quick lead, taking the doubles match
with two out of three doubles wins over UC-Berkeley's second varsity team. Despite losing two third-set heartbreakers at No. 3 and No. 5 singles, wins from captains Pete
Schilla 'Ol and Scott Grant 'Ol along with help from John
Thomas 'O2 helped Swat to edge ahead with a final score of
4-3. Exhibition players Ben Keys 'Ol and Ben Rae 'O4 also
pulled out wins against Cal.
Following a day off, the team braved an always-perilous car trip with coach Mike Mullan and headed for UCDavis. Swat faced intensely competitive matches at every
position before ultimately succumbing to a stronger Davis
team, 9-0.
Putting the lopsided loss to UC-Davis behind them, the
team hoped to turn things around against Foothill College,
a top nationally ranked junior college. Chaperoned by the
M & M coaching team of Mike and Marsha Mullan and
fueled by innumerable bagels, Swat tore through an unsuspecting Foothill team. The Garnet jumped out to a quick
lead, with wins at all three doubles positions, and never
looked back. After Jayson Yost 'O3 and Frank Visciano 'O4
dispensed of their opponents in a timely fashion, they
watched as teammates Schilla, Thomas, Justin Singer 'O3

and Grant battled through tight matches to come out victorious. Exhibition singles went no differently, as Rae and
Aaron Rubin 'O4 cruised through their outmatched opponents. At the end of the day, Swat walked away with an
impressive 9-0 win.
On the final day of the trip, Swat headed to wine country to face Sonoma State. Fatigue from a long and draining week, combined with a formidable Sonoma State
team, together proved too much to overcome for the Garnet as they fell to Sonoma 6-1. The lone win of the day
for the top six came from Grant, who outplayed and
outlasted his opponent in a 7-5, 7-5 marathon win. Keys
also shocked the world with his second win of the trip
at No. 9 singles, 8-4.
The team returned to Swarthmore slightly tanner and
significantly sorer than they left, with a final record of
two wins and two losses for the trip. Coach Mike Mullan
said he was impressed with the week. "I got lost several
times and drove in circles for a good deal of the trip, but
overall the trip was a success," Mullan said. After proving
that they can hang with and occasionally beat up on Division I teams, the Swarthmore men's tennis team looks to
flex its muscles against the Division 111 field starting this
weekend. With important back-to-back home matches
against Mary Washington on Saturday, March 24 and
Washington College on Sunday, March 25, the Garnet squad
looks to continue its trek toward nationals. Matches begin at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday and 1 p.m. on Sunday at the
Faulkner Courts.

BEING THE BALL
with Joe Gerlitz

All is well with my Joe
I'm going to miss the rapture.
I don't know what that means, but Joe Gerlitz said it
once, so it must be true.
Actually, I have to admit I haven't been in contact with
my Joe until recently.
One example: My hitting was atrocious down in Florida.
I was swinging the bat like Ricky Ledee and striking out
like Ruben Rivera.
There's something that just never seems to translate
right away from the skills involved in pretending like you
can hit during batting cage action to actually hitting in a
game. In a game not only do you have to look better than
the pitcher, you actually have to hit the ball too.
Sports fans all know that sport is about looking good.
Scott Kushner likes to put batting gloves in both his back
pockets with the fingers out. Teddy Ballgame chews seeds
'cause that's what ballplayers do. Plus he's addicted to them
like I'm addicted to chewable vitamin C.
And we all know about women looking good in sports.
But looking pretty isn't everything. Ugly men like JohnKruk
and Otis Nixon can play great baseball. Just think about it.
When I got down to Florida, the long weeks of indoor
practice were showing in my swing. Sure, in the cage I might
swing with the graceful arc of Griffey, but I can only do
that because hitters don't need bat speed in a cage. In the
cage the ball comes at you straight and slow, like Boris toward Donny's grill.
So I stepped into the box for the first time down in Florida
filling the cleanup spot, carrying the rep of a home run crushing machine. I got plunked and walked in my only two atbats. The pitcher was obviously intimidated by just how good
I looked with my Griffey swing in the on-deck circle.
The next day, after spending a restful night sharing a
double bed with my good buddy Clifford, I came up against
a guy who could really pitch. He was throwing his curveball
for strikes. And to make things worse, my swing was slower
than ever. He started putting fastballs by me that I should
have express-mailed to the cheap seats. But I fouled out and
struck out twice.
Thursday afternoon, and still no hits. I walked, grounded
out, and reached on an error. I was miserable. I couldn't
eat. I wouldn't touch the Powerade on my tray. The only
thing on my mind was the extremely hot softball blonde in
red who kept glancing at me across the cafeteria, and the
thought that I might go hitless in Florida.
We played a night game under the lights later that same
day. I was focused on getting a hit. With the blonde long gone,
it was the only thing left for me to worry about. I took some
cuts with my weighted bat. I changed my batting gloves. And
I struck out again, on a fastball after two sweet curves.
That was a low point for me, but I wasn't ready to throw
in the towel. We were only down 3-0 and had a chance to get
our first win. The team rallied to 3-2 in the fourth inning
and I came up with two outs and Konits on second base.
Game-tying run. The count was at 1-L I thought to myself,
Lane, he's coming with that damn curveball, that cocky
bastard. 'Twas the last thought that entered my head before I hit a nice line drive into left off a hanging curve. Tied
ballgame. Felt good.
Two innings later, after some solid pitching by our big
lefty Mr. Drew, I got another chance to hit. Another big
rally. Still tied at three. Franco was on second, pinch running for Chambo, and Konits was on first, nobody down.
Coach called me over. He asked me to sacrifice bunt. It's a
good baseball strategy, but I suck at bunting. Four pitches
later I've fouled off two bunts and the count is 2-2.1 asked
the umpire for time.
I took a deep breath. I tried to visualize my last hit, but
I could barely remember it. Which was strange because I
could remember each of my strikeouts in vivid detail, pitch
by excruciating pitch.
And then all at once I understood. I couldn't remember
my last at-bat because when I cracked that line drive I didn't
hit the ball. I was the ball.
In a state of pure knowledge, I relaxed my mind and suddenly the Joe flooded back into me. Be the ball, he said, and
I listened. The next thing I knew I was crushing a fastball
deep into left center. A two-run double to the wall to win
the game.
Welcome back from spring break, sports fans.
Love life. Laugh a lot. Enjoy the company offriends.
Go harness your Joe. Be the ball.

Baseball slow to warm up

Parity and Lady Luck,
Ted vs. the Big Dance
I figured after picking three out of the last four remaining teams, the finalists, and the winners on my
March Madness pool last year, Lady Luck would come
back this year and give me a good old-fashionedbeating, and then some. Boy, has she busted out the whooping stick on me. Being a gambling man, I picked North
Carolina and lowa State for the Final Four, and both
have already sufferedridiculous upsets. lowa Statelost
to fifteenth-seeded Hampton in a ridiculous upset, and
North Carolina fell to Penn State, which usually isn't
very good at sports played with a round object. It may
be over for me, but that hardly means I'm tuning out.
So there it is: the mere beginnings of another wild
NCAA tournament. What it goes to show is just how
much the game of basketball has grown in the United
States, and the tremendous depth of talent. Though most
of the schools in the Sweet Sixteen are large institutions with strong athletic traditions, there is a team like
Gonzaga remaining, along with squads like Hampton,
Butler and Georgia State, all of which pulled upsets that
illustrate the trend. While ACC and Pac-10 schools are
grabbing McDonald's All-American's, there is clearly
enough talent seeping through the cracks so that small
schools can compete at such a high level.

A WIDE RANGE OF TEAMS IS
FANTASTIC FOR YOUR HAND-INHIS-PANTS SPORTS STALWART
WHO ALWAYS ROOTS FOR THE
UNDERDOG.
This is fantastic for your hand-in-his-pants sports
stalwart who always roots for the underdog (read: team
that eventually loses). It's great to see a team I can't
stand like Virginia get knocked off and all their gungho fans get shot down. If the women's tournament were
like that, more people would watch, but as it is, the gap
in the quality of talent in the women's game hasn't narrowed enough for that to be the case. You see Tennessee's
top two women players dunking and nailing NBA-range
three-pointers, while anyone seededbelow 12's best two
players can scarcely bring the ball up the court.
After all, March Madness is great because you never
know who the heck might win. The women's tourney
might as well be the top eight teams in the country, because the rest don't have much of a chance against the
best. Even though my hometown team, Boston College,
got knocked out, and my pool tanked worse than the
stock market, there's always the underdog to root for.
And you never know. In 1985, Georgetown was a

The Swarthmore baseball team began its 2001 campaign in
Cocoa Beach, Fla. over spring break. Despite a "light drizzle"

early in the week, the weather was a pleasantly warm change
from the chill of Philly. For a team marked by youth, the squad
was able to hold its own against some of the nation's top teams.
Unfortunately, a dearth of hits and some costly errors led to
losses in the first three contests against Virginia Wesleyan,
Simpson College and Mount Saint Mary's.
The fourth and final game, against Ohio Valley, was the
nightcap of a double header. The game time was scheduled
for 10 pm on an absolutely gorgeous night for baseball. Matt

Justene Hill 'O4 started to play lacrosse her sophomore
year in high school, and as soon as she did, she was crazy
about it. She didn't care that her coach at Midland School,
men's Lacrosse Hall of Fame member John Valestra, had
never coached women's lacrosse before and was learning
about the sport along with her. She was not perturbed by
the fact that she was in California and that most lacrosse
players lived across the country on the East Coast. She
would not be bothered by the fact that she and her two
closest friends were three of the four black faces she ever
saw on the field and that none ofher friends at public high
school had ever heard of her newfound passion. Hill was
just glad that her stint playing baseball on a team where
she was the only woman was over. When her friends suggested lacrosse, she was ready to step off the plate and into

Ewing. They were a No. 1 seed as well as the No. 1-ranked
team in the nation. In the finals, they faced unranked
major mismatch. And it was.
But sometimesa player just gets unconscious. You see it
all the time. Guys few people have heard of who can barely
beat you get in as a sub and starting hitting threes like
nobody's business. That happened to Villanova that day. It
happened to Villanova's entire team. They shot 78.6 percent
from the floor that day 78.6 percent!—and won 6fr64. The
chances of this percentage against a team with a seven-foot
center in theNCAA finals are the same as going five for five
with five home runs off Pedro Martinez in the World Series,
or a QB throwing for 700 yards in the SuperBowl.
But it must be possible, right? Because it happened.
And if you watch closely, and root hard enough, it just
might happen again.

Goldstein 'O4 made the start for the Garnet and pitched
in his second outing of the week. Goldstein
had the Ohio Valley batters offbalance as he held them to
three runs in three innings. Ohio Valley's pitcher was also
making a stellarperformance, shutting down Swat's lineup
in order over the first three innings.
Down 3-0 in the fourth, center fielder Scott Kushner 'O2
and Wes Sconce 'O4 led off with consecutive singles to continue their fine hitting and begin a three-run rally. Drew
Adams 'O3 relieved Goldstein of the pitching duties and
held Ohio Valley scoreless over the next three innings.

Hill moved up from JV to varsity status in a matter of
weeks. She ran and trained and even started to play soccer
in order to improve in lacrosse. By the end of her high
school career, she was captain of her team. Her quick ascent was noted not only by Coach Valestra, with whom she
developed a close relationship, but also by many alumni at
her boarding school, who often asked her about her experience. When it came time to choose colleges, she headed
east, because she was serious about playing on a competitive level. She decided on Swarthmore, thus moving from
