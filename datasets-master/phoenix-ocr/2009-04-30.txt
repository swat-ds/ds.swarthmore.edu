Corrections
FROM THE APR. 23, 2009 ISSUE:
The article entitled “Alum connects law theory to faith and reason” originally stated that Princeton Professor Robert George 77 is a member
of President Obama’s Bioethics Council. Although George currently
does serve on the President’s Council on Bioethics, the Council is not
Obama’s. George was appointed to the Council by George W. Bush.
This article also incorrectly stated that Rev. Eugene Rivers’s last name
was Riches.

SDS explores definition of anti-war movement
"Perspectives on Anti-War," which aimed
at expanding the definition of anti-war. "A
lot of people, even if they oppose the war,

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
afK>ssanl@swarthmore.edu

Students for a Democratic Society held
an Anti-War Conference from April 23-25
that addressed the ways in which the antiwar movement can extend beyond pacifism. According to Maurice Weeks 'O9, a
member of SDS, this semester the group
took on a stronger anti-war focus. "Antiwar issues were sort of moving further and
further offof people's radar, especially with
the economic crisis," Weeks said.
The conference began on Thursday
"Dismantling
afternoon
with
Monoculture," a presentation by the
Beehive Design Collective. "They create
these incredibly intricate murals that
include nature-based metaphors for global
trade, capitalism and other forms of oppression," said Dan Symonds 'IL a member of
SDS. The group's work deals primarily
with the economic relations between the
U.S. and South America. Rather than using
human figures, they use animal species to
represent different populations. While on
campus, the Beehive Design Collective
spoke about their mission and shared photos of their work. "They tried to make it an
interactive presentation, which was great,"
said Majandra Rodriguez 'l2, another member of SDS.
"They had really insightful comments
about the importance of anti-copyright and
spreading information and ways to resist
without having to be a non-governmental
organization," Symonds said.
On Friday, Rodriguez and Andrew
Petzinger 'O9 facilitated the discussion

don't consider themselves as anti-war
activists," Rodriguez said. "They consider
themselves environmental activists or for
education."
The conversation explored the ways in
which these other issues intersect with the
anti-war movement. "If you work on race
issues, if you work on sexism, if you work
on classism, if you work on all these things
you're also addressing the issue of war,"
Rodriguez said. For example, participants
discussed that the military promotes heterosexual norms through policies such as
"Don't ask, don't tell," bringing together the
gay rights and anti-war movements.
About ten students attended the event,
including about five members of SDS. "It
was a good conversation to have, I just feel
like there weren't enough people,"
Rodriguez said. Other members of the
group didn'tfeel that attendance hadbeen a
problem for the conference. "I was happy to
see relatively high attendance, especially
for this time of year, at all these events,"
...

Weeks said.
SDS brought two war veterans to campus on Saturday for the panel "From the
Front Lines." John Grant, a Vietnam War
veteran and member of Veterans for Peace,
and. James Gilligan, who has served in both
Afghanistan and Iraq, shared their generationally divided experiences with a group

of around twenty students and other members of the Swarthmore community.
Grant's war experience altered his
views regarding armed conflict. He joined

the army seven days after graduating from
high school. "I was raised to think there
would be a war and here it was," he said.
"When I got home I started to read a lot

and I started to question. What I learned
was that the Vietnam War didn't have to
happen, shouldn't have happened," he said.
Gilligan's testimony, often in conversation with Grant, dealt with the psychological consequences of war. In addition to suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,
Gilligan has trouble removing himselffrom
the psychological mindset of war. "I couldn't hold down anything," he said, referring
to jobs and relationships. "We were just on
completely different pages, civilians and

me."

During the presentation Gilligan nervously walked around the room, agitated by
the florescent lighting and any loud noises.
He also directly interacted with audience
members. "People usually go to lectures
thinking they're watching a movie, and so
for James to just be pointing at the audience, forcing opinions out of people, and
basically getting attention at the cost of a
relaxed environment
it dramatically
changed the physical space," Symonds said.
Weeks found that these personalities
made the war more real. "It was really eyeopening to hear some of their experiences
It's not just x number of veterans; it's
like this guy right in front of me telling me
what he's experiencing every day."
When asked about being anti-war by
moderator Symonds, Grant responded,
"I'm not a pacifist. I'm a gun owner. I would
defend myself. We unfortunately need a
military, but we need a smart military." He
...

concluded, "I'm not against the military,
I'm against militarism."
Gilligan took a different stance. "We
cannot work within the system of the institution If you want change, you're going
to have to destroy the system." His ideal
...

world system involves breaking up larger
states in order to reduce conflict.

"It was something that didn't occur to
me as a way to change things," Jon Miller
'l2 said. Yet he found himself more aligned
with Grant's ideas. "It's unfortunate that
we need a military, but we do need it."
The three-day conference closed with a
dinner discussion hosted by Lang visiting
professor George Lakey. The event drew
around twenty guests, including members
of SDS and some Delaware county residents. As Lakey discussed foreign examples
of successful activism, these guests were
able to add examples from their own lives.
"I really like the way he used personal
anecdotes to reinforce ideas that we could
then translate into our lives," Naomi
Glassman 'l2 said. Weeks echoed the sentiment. "A lot of people look at the issue of
anti-war and say, 'Well this is impossible.
How can we accomplish this?'" he said.
"Where that talk and dinner was coming
from is that this isn't impossible. A position
of anti-war doesn't have to be one of

despair."
Rodriguez came away from the conference with a better understanding of what
can be an anti-war position. "It was a good
diversity of events," she said. "Going to all
of these events provided a pretty wellrounded picture of being anti-war and the
complexities ofanti-war."

Student Council collects possible uses for rollover

meeting

of
Student Council, the Council discussed possible uses of rollover
funds and Council President
Yongjun Heo 'O9 presented a list of
potential college budget cuts that
could be paid for by the Council's
funds. Many of these options will
be included in a referendum
aimed at gauging the student
At

Sunday's

body's priorities.
On April 6, Heo sent an e-mail
to the student body from the
Council explaining the nature of
the rollover funds and the possibility of those funds being used to
avoid the loss of services that students currently enjoy. According
to the letter, "Each year, there has
been significant rollover from

unspent money from the student

activities fund, which is typically

put in a capital replacement
fund." This year the capital
replacement fund, which provides
for the replacement of student
equipment, "is large enough to
cover all foreseeable costs.
Therefore it is not imperative that
we transfer more money to it."
This means that the money
could be put to a variety of uses,
including covering the cost of current services that the college is
considering cutting due to budget

shortfalls.
On April 29, Heo sent another
email to the student body with

possible uses

ofthe rollover funds.

THE PHOENIX

Though the list of spending
options that will appear on the
ballot has not yet been finalized,
at the meeting Heo presented six
current services or events that the

administration has indicated will
be cut next year, which could be
carried on if funded by the
Council's rollover funds. These
were the funding of Parlor
Parties, which costs $lO,OOO a year;
the free distribution of the New
York Times, which costs $13,000 a
year; the Spring Large Scale
Event, which is being cut to save
$40,000; the annual trip to Penn's
Landing, which costs $3,000; free
loans of ITS equipment to students, which costs $l,OOO to $2,000;
and possible budget cuts to
Physical Education classes, which
could vary in amount. According
to Heo, this list was compiled after
meeting with the administration,
talking to students and reading
through e-mails that had been
sent to Student Council.
More options could be added to
the ballot in the coming days as

members of Student Council discuss other possible uses for the

rollover

money. Because the
Council is hoping to conduct the

referendum
using
online,
Blackboard, they hope to get student input on as many ideas as
possible. "I think that we are
deciding to include as many studentrelevant items as possible [on
the ballot]. This will be a great
opportunity for us to learn directly from students which activities

are priorities and which are not
as important," Heo said by e-mail.
"Hopefully the vote will start
this weekend... but that is tentative," Nate Erskine 'lO, VicePresident ofStudent Council, said
in an e-mail.
A few students who attended
the meeting proposed uses for the
rollover funds that don't involve
filling budget shortfalls, including
college funding of seminar break
snacks and an effort to make textbooks more available. According
to Dermot Delude-Dix 'O9 and
Maurice Weeks 'O9, these ideas
came out of Class Awareness
Month and reflect an effort to

make sure that the Swarthmore
experience doesn't differ based on
a student's socioeconomic class.
Delude-Dix and Weeks argued
that the current system of students providing food for seminar
breaks often becomes a competition that some students are more
equipped to participate in than
others and that college funding of
these refreshments could ease the
pressure on students with less
spending money. They also said
that the money allotted for books

within a student's financial aid

package is often insufficient, especially when that student has to
travel to get to Swarthmore, as
money for books is put in the
same category as money for travel. At the meeting, both subsidiza-

While this was not discussed as a
ballot option, Student Council
agreed to write a letter expressing
its support for employee benefits
and urging the college not to make
any cuts in that area.
Though the format and content
of the referendum have not been
finalized, members of Student
Council discussed a system in
which students would rank the
possible uses of the rollover
money in order of preference, as
well as being able to designate
some options as non-priorities.

is taken seriously, so Student
Council is open to new suggestions from students," Heo said in
an e-mail. The revolving fund,
which was suggested by Camille
Rogine 'll, would provide funds
for sustainable initiatives that
save money in the long run.

Treasurer, the administration

StuCo amendment ratified
through unanimous vote

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY SARAH POZGAY
slong6@swarthmore.edu

A new amendment to the Student Council
Constitution was ratified at this Sunday's
Council meeting. The amendment, which concerns Article III: Section 5 of the constitution
"Appeals of Budgeting Decisions," provides that
appeals ofStudent Budget Committee decisions
may be heard by Student Council through an
emergency e-mail process. The e-mail process is
to be used only with time-sensitive appeals
when Student Council is not able to draw quorum for an actual hearing. The amendment was
passed unanimously.

Under the normal appeals process, a student
or group may appeal an SBC decision to
Student Council at which point an appeals hearing is scheduled by the Student Groups
Advisor, a non-voting member of both Student
Council and the SBC.
The SBC Manager is present and gives an
account of the SBC's original decision and the
student or group concerned presents their case
to Student Council. Quorum for the hearing is
six members, not including the Student Groups
Advisor, and the appeal requires a 50 percent
majority to be granted.
The new amendment, however, allows for an
alternative e-mail route for certain cases of
appeals. Under the new constitution, when a
student or group appeals an SBC decision, the
Student Groups Advisor along with the SBC
Manager may deem it appropriate for an emergency e-mail appeal to take place if the appeal is
especially time-sensitive and if Student Council
is not able to meet quorum for an actual hearing within those time constraints. Once the email process is approved, both the SBC
Manager and the student or group involved
submit statements to Council members via email, and council votes via e-mail. For the
appeal to be granted, however, a two-thirds
majority of Council (or six of the nine voting
members) is required.
The emergency appeal process is currently
the only Student Council voting procedure that
may take place via e-mail.
Student Council first recognized the need for
the amendment after one student's appeal
almost failed because Council was having trouble reaching quorum for the hearing. "We were
having a tremendous amount of difficulty getting all of Council together for a physical meeting, and he was actually about an hour away
from a deadline of when he had to place an
order," said Nate Erskine 'O9, Student Council
Vice President,
The student was Michael Bernasek 'O9, who
appealed the SBC's decision denying his
buy
to
t-shirts
for
the
request
Amherst/Swarthmore NCAA soccer game in
November of last semester. Because Bernasek
only had a few days' notice that the game was
actually going to take place, time was running
short when he appealed the decision to Student
Council.
In the end the appeal was granted, but
according to everyone involved, this was a close
call. Bernasek said that at the last minute, it
was really just a game to get Student Council
members together for the vote. "It became very
clear that [the appeal] was going to pass, so definitely, the amendment would have made that
easier and probably saved a lot of the members
two hours of their time just waiting around,"
Bernasek said. He added that at the time, "It
just seemed fairly ridiculous given that they
could have simply voted via e-mail or even over
the phone."
According-to Erskine, "The consensus from
Council that came out of that meeting was that
we should have some sort of alternative in place
for a situation like that" Council discussed the

April 30, 2009

problem in the following weeks, and Erskine

drafted the amendment.
While most agreed that an alternative appeal
system should be made available, there were a
number of different concerns over the amendment in its earliest form. The strongest of these,
Erskine said, was that the emergency appeal
process would replace the regular process. "We
didn't want to worry about a situation where
council members a couple generations from
now would just feel kind of lazy and just decide
to do everything by e-mail and you wouldn't
have that chance to have that discussion," he
said.
The SBC had similar concerns over the
amendment. "We wanted to be sure that this
wasn't an excuse to not draw quorum," SBC
Manager Fletcher Coleman 'O9 said. Coleman
stressed that the SBC felt it would be fairer to
all the parties involved for the hearing to take
place in person when at all possible.
In trying to reach a compromise between the
two groups, the SBC originally asked that the
emergency e-mail appeal require a unanimous
vote of council to be passed, rather than a twothirds majority. Council was reluctant to comply with this suggestion because of the possibility that certain members might be unreachable
and would then hold up the process yet again.
The two groups finally settled the issue by
deciding to require the SBC Manager, in addition to the Student Groups Advisor, to approve
the emergency process.
"That seemed like a reasonable way of dealing with that," Coleman said, adding that in the
end, "Student Council and SBC were both on
the same page with this one."
"I think that covers [the SBC's] base pretty
well," agreed Benjamin Francis 'l2, Student
Groups Advisor-elect. "If they don'tfeel like it's
necessary, the SBC Manager could turn it down
so then there would be no emergency appeal."
Still though, Erskine said an apparent note
of concern among some students was that the
two members alone should have control over
approving the emergency process. "I think the
important thing to clarify is that if [they]
deemed that an emergency appeal was inappropriate in that case
that Student Council could
probably get together in enough time
then
the student would automatically have a regular
appeal hearing," Erskine said.
Francis added that because the regular
process only requires a simple majority, the
two-thirds consensus requirement should sufficiently discourage those who would seek to
abuse the emergency appeal process. "People
will only use it when they know it's actually an
emergency, otherwise it makes sense for them
to wait," he said.
While most agree that the emergency
process will not be implemented with much frequency, there has been more than one appeal in
which Council was worried that quorum could
not be reached in the given time. "We heard an
appeal the other week for funding for the comedy week, and for a while we were kind of scrambling to get everyone; we were short and didn't
have quorum for a while," said Rachel Bell 'lO,
Student Groups Advisor and Student Council
President-elect. "If some appeals are particularly more urgent, time sensitive, then [the amendment] is important and streamlines a process."
"I don't imagine it having an extraordinary
amount of effect; it's supposed to be just for
exceptional cases. But if there is an exceptional
case, like the Amherst soccer game that happened last semester, then it's useful. And it's
nice that we know it's there," Francis said.
The full amendment is available to read
online under Article in, Section 5, Clause 5 of
the Student Council Constitution at

ance came from alums for whom
football had been a very significant part of their Swarthmore
experience. It took a while for
many to understand that rather
than being "anti-athletic," the
decision sprang from a concern to
strengthen our intercollegiate
athletic program. The idea was
that spreading recruitment that
had been dedicated to football
across all sports would enable a
marked increase in the overall
excellence of our athletic program. And I think that there is no

question that has been the result.

Al Bloom will be taking over as Vice Chancellor of NYU-Abu Dhabi.

Al Bloom is stepping down as
President of Swarthmore College
after 18years. This summer Bloom
will take over as Vice Chancellor of
the New York University Abu
Dhabi campus. The Phoenix's Jeff
Davidson sat down with Bloom
last Thursday.
Jeff Davidson: What is it
about Swarthmore that drove you
to stay here twice as long as the
average college president?
Al Bloom: I think it's not only

a remarkable college, but one distinct in American education, for
the vision it defines and delivers.
JD: What was the most resisted
proposition you brought up to the
student body?

AB: Proposals are often
brought forward by students that

reflect a very committed ethical
stand and seek to create a better
community and world. But complex implications of the proposals
often suggest to me that a somewhat different approach is
required. Understandably, I generally receive serious initial
pushback on my view. We then
embark on a process of dialogue

and mutual education that almost
invariably produces a mutually
satisfying result. One such issue
was the Living Wage, which in its
first iteration I believe would
have had seriously negative consequences for the institution.
More than a year of dialogue,
research and thoughtful consideration across students, faculty,
staff and the Board produced an
approach of which the community was proud, which was broadly
viewed as responsible and
humane.
A current such issue centers
on the right of workers to organize using the method known as
Card-Check-Neutrality. We all
believe that workers should have
the right to unionize in a way
they feel respects their interests
and sense of justice. But I pushed
back on the students' original

proposal
that would have
required the College to guarantee
that any developer we might hire

through dialogue we have come
to a better place, with students
and the Board set to work together this coming weekend. This
community's astounding capacity
for transforming pushback on
both sides into commitment to
further analysis, to taking others'
perspectives and to investing the
imagination required to reach a
mutually satisfying result makes
it a terrific breeding ground for
leaders, who through cooperative
dialogue will shape a more productive, just, inclusive and peace-

ful world.

impressive feats was cutting the
football program. Today we see it
as a great thing, but I'm sure at
that time there was a lot of opposition.
AB: There was opposition for

sure. The students who were
directly affected suffered from the
loss of football; for many of them
it was one of the great delights
and a source of important value
in their educational experience. It

would have been ideal if the
College could have exited gradually from the program so that students could have continued to
play over their remaining years
at Swarthmore. However, simply
not recruiting new freshmen
would have resulted in our team
quickly becoming too small to be
safe or to have any chance of victory.
Most students quickly came to
understand and accept the reasons for the decision. A few members of the team transferred to
other colleges, but many came
back out of appreciation for

Swarthmore's academic strength
and the remarkable nature of its
community. The deepest resist-

convincing people, what were the
methods you used? Because I think
they can be used today when we
have all ofthese problems with the
financial crisis in convincing all of
the cuts.
AB: On campus, the approach
was conversation bringing people together, listening carefully
and sensitively to others' perspectives, explaining the reasons for
the decision, working to develop
alternative options for those
affected. Among alumni, it was
more difficult. It's harder to talk
to 18,000 people around the coun-

try in a way that allows a sensitive exchange of perspectives and
a reaching for common goals. The
approach necessarily depended
on correspondence, publications,
and, to whatever extent possible,
on direct dialogue, which was
invariably more effective.

JD: So there are all of thesefantastic aspects of Swarthmore, but
we are always looking for ways to
improve. Where do you see that, in
either the short or long term, we
are going to need to focus our
effortsfor the future?
AB: Given current financial
challenges, our primary concern
must be to sustain the distinctive
qualities of the College: the rigor
and richness of its academic program; its ability to continue to
attract and retain extraordinary
faculty, students and staff; its ability to empower students to
become their best selves, to hone
theirethical intelligence, to develop their own sense of the priorities for the society and the world
and begin to define their own
paths towards helping to realize
those priorities.
Projecting beyond the current
financial climate, the planning
processes we have used as a community have proven themselves
excellent means for shaping
future direction. Among the pri-

orities that emerged is to move
towards a four-course load for faculty. I believe it is vital. Building
better facilities for engineering,
psychology, philosophy and biolo-

gy, among others; creating better
student space; expanding student
and
internships
summer
research opportunities are very
important as well. Continuing to

attract great diversity in the student body and to build bonds of
colleagueship, respect and trust
across the College community are
central to our mission.
JD: In terms of continuing to
bring in great students, one of the
things that I am interested in is

how many more students we are

April 30, 2009

taking in the future classes. To
what extent can we continue to
accept more people and what problems will this pose for the campus?
AB: This is a question
Swarthmore's been debating for a
very long time. I think there is
room to increase the student
body, particularly if we increase
the faculty at the same rate so as
not to dilute the quality of student-faculty interaction, which is
at the core of the Swarthmore
educational experience.
An

increase in the number of both

faculty and students would allow
a curriculum more able to
respond to new intellectual directions as they emerge. But there is
a point at which growth in size
might begin to undermine the
sense that each student and each
member of the faculty engages,
feels responsibility towards and
can influence the whole, a point
at which the community might no
longer be as united as it is today
in respect, care, and common purpose.
We've decided to add approximately 40 students over the next
several years. One thousand four
hundred twenty is not too big;
and over time, I think, we could
add another 200 students. With
appropriate planning and proportionate increase in faculty,
Swarthmore would be, if anything, even more excellent.
JD: So you feel comfortable

until 1600?
AB: I doubt we want to reach
that goal for another 10 years, if
not more. We can then take a look
at how things have developed.

After all, the more students that
graduate from Swarthmore the
better for the world.
JD: So if you could give
President-designate Chopp one
piece ofadvice, what would it be?
AB: To continue what she has
already begun
getting to know
Swarthmore, because there is no
greater satisfaction than recognizing the distinctive nature of
the community and the education
that it delivers.
JD: So talking about Abu
Dhabi, your presidency has been
institutional
defined about
change. You cut the football program, you increased minority rep-

resentation in the student body by
more than 100percent. How do you
plan on staying true to that when
you move to a place that is much
more restrictive in its framework?
AB: I don't think it's going to

be more restrictive. I will seek to
build, as I have here, but in a
world context. We will recruit students from around the world, perhaps 40 percent from the United
States, Canada and Britain, 15
percent from the Arab world, and

the remaining from Africa,
Southeast Asia, East Asia, Latin
America. We will likewise recruit
faculty from across the globe and
I am committed to establishing at
NYU-Abu Dhabi the same bonds
of common respect and purpose
that I've tried to foster here. The
Abu Dhabi government is deeply
committed to supporting the creation of a distinguished liberal
arts college and a world-class
research institute that draw on

faculty, students and ideas from
around the world.
JD: So do you think the expansion of liberal arts colleges and
what you mentioned about Abu
Dhabi indicate a growing acceptance of intellectualfreedom?
AB: Absolutely. I'd say that
liberal arts colleges are emerging
in astounding numbers around
the world, very much because
'

they not only promise greater

breadth in undergraduate curriculum, but because they also
promise training in critical thinking and environments of open
and informed discussion.
JD: What do you see as the
biggest opportunities in Abu

Dhabi?
AB: To create a truly distinguished liberal arts college and a
world-class research institute,
both linked to NYU-New York,

which together will become the
most significant educational

institution in the Middle East.
Moreover, I envision NYU-Abu
Dhabi as an institution which has
important effects not only on the
spread of fine education but on
history, through introducing a
context of responsible examination of ideas, of cooperative discussion across perspectives and

of constructive resolution.
JD: What is the timelinefor getting the campus going?
AB: We'll be ready for the
opening class in September 2010.
-

We've already begun to recruit
students and faculty. A downtown
campus is currently under construction that will be in operation
at least through 2013, when a permanent campus is due to open on
Saadiyat Island, 500 meters off the
coast of Abu Dhabi city.
JD: So one final question
since coming here, what have you

seen as the biggest growth and
expansion at Swarthmore?
AB: I wouldn't say there was
one biggest. There has been substantial growth in the breadth of
our academic program and in the
number of faculty positions; in
the student body in both number
and diversity; in the contributions faculty make to intellectual
and artistic advance; in the
broader educational opportunities available to students on- and
off-campus; in alumni engagement with the College; in the
College's success and potential
for fundraising; in the transformation from a vehicular to a
pedestrian campus, and the emergence of new spectacular facilities, including Kohlberg Hall, renovated Trotter Hall, the Science
Center, Alice Paul and David
Kemp residence halls and the
Mullan Tennis Center.
And I'm very gratified that
that growth includes as well

heightened
recognition
of
Swarthmore's distinctive qualities and leadership position in
American education, as reflected
in recent rankings which place
Swarthmore at the top of the
nation's colleges and universities.
That recognition is very affirming both for the College and for
what it implies about how excellence in higher education is coming to be defined.

College requests ADA code delay Student housing
on steadier track
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

In response

to the current eco-

nomic recession, the college has
asked the Department of Justice for
an extension in completing expected
facility changes that would bring the
college into compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines.
The Department of Justice
approached the college in 2006 for
preliminary inquiries into the state
of ADA compliance. Their survey
visit, which the college's ADA
Program Manager Susan Smythe
said didn't cover all of the facilities,
was in the summer of 2007. According
to the public online settlement
between the college and the
Department of Justice, violations

included, among other problems,
doors that were too high, ramps that
were too steep, inaccessible dorm

rooms, inaccessible bathrooms, toilet
seats that were too high and fire
alarms that were not easily visible.
Part of the settlement required
that the college have a "complete"
survey of all campus facilities like

parking lots, buildings and pathways.
In order to develop a plan for ADA
compliance, the college hired the out-

side firm Kessler McGuinness and
Associates to do the survey, which
went from March to June of last year.
Passed almost two decades ago,
the ADA is national legislation that
aims to ensure facilities provide
equality and accessibility for people
who are disabled.
Smythe said that the request for a
longer timeline doesn't mean "that
[the college is] planning on doing anything less," though.

Vice President for Facilities and
Services Stu Hain agreed.
"We haven't said anything about
changing our plan. We're only
extending the plan," Hain said.
"We're not sitting doing nothing In
the next couple of years we have
some other projects, but certainly
nowhere near as big as what we
would have [had without the reces...

sion]."

The college is planning on
installing accessible bathrooms in
Willets' Mephistos Lounge and the
Robinson House, marking "safe wait
areas," correcting signage issues and
doing some work on pathways.
"Safe wait areas" are places for
people to wait if they cannot use
stairs in case of an evacuation; these
areas, many of which are starting to

be marked around campus, do not
block other evacuees' pathways in
the case of an emergency. ADA guidelines require that a room or building's signage, which has information
such as the room number in both
numerals and Braille, be placed on
the same side of the door as the doorknob. This streamlined nuance is
meant to help people with vision
impairment, so they can always be
sure that the signage and doorknob

are on the same side.
Vice President for Finance and
Treasurer Suzanne Welsh said that
the college's board has convehed an
ad-hoc financial planning group that
is made up of board members, members of the administration, faculty
and staff. By December of 2009 this
group is expected to propose a spend-

6

ing plan, detailing how the college
can annually reduce endowment
spending by 10 to 15 million dollars.
Welsh said that though these plans
aren't final, the delay of facility
changes is part of this initiative.
"The deferring of the facility capital budget is part of an overall effort
to reduce our endowment spending,
which has been necessitated by the

downturn of the endowment," she
said.
The college is currently waiting to
hear back from a survey that will
assess whether it is feasible to make
accessibility changes to the bookstore, a place Smythe said is particularly out of compliance. This feasibility survey is twofold: first it is meant
to see if it is physically plausible to
make changes for compliance given
the space and the age of the building
and also to see if the economic climate would allow the college to do so.
Violations include the steepness of
the ramp and the narrow pathways at
the upper book level and the lower
store level.
A feasibility study was requested
by the Department of Justice after the
college expressed its concern that it
wouldn't be able to make the bookstore fully compliant as of now.
According to Smythe, the college
should receive results in about a
month.
Only then will we know the appropriate level of action to take, she
added.

Hain said that other largely noncompliant places on campus include
the road around the fieldhouse, the
fieldhouse itself and access to the
swimming pool and tennis courts.

Last August, the college began discussing when it would be feasible to
complete all the proposed facility
changes. While the college submitted
a plan in December that would have
made all changes by 2013, Smythe
said that the drastic change in the
economic landscape from August to
December forced the college to ask if
it was possible to delay plans.
"[The Department of Justice was]
open and willing to talk to us about
extending the time to do the work,"

Hain said.
The college went back to file what
they thought they could do within
two years, but the Department of
Justice has yet to determine whether
these measures are sufficient.
Hain said that he isn't too concerned because of the rapport the college and the Department of Justice
have built.
"I don't think there'll be a problem," he said. "Nobody's unhappy
with anybody. They're willing to

cooperate about this, and we are too."
Smythe agreed, adding that the
college believes it has "pretty good
reasons" for submitting this plan. She
added that starting this October the
college has to send the Department of
Justice an annual report tracking the

college's progress.
If the college were to refuse or fail
to make changes, the Department of
Justice would take it to federal court.
Hain said that the college would then
be legally forced to make the changes,
and the judge would determine
appropriate consequences. No college
has ever gone through this process,
though.

The

Department

of Justice has

gone through this type of auditing
process with other colleges recently,

however, such as the University of
Chicago,

Duke

University

and

Colorado College. Colgate University,
where Swarthmore's president-designate Rebecca Chopp is finishing her
presidential tenure, has just started
going through the process.
While all ADA violations are
important, Smythe said that there are
some that are more minor than others.
"I'd venture to say that there are
some things that we're probably taking a much closer look at because of
the economy," she said. "Our sort of
guiding principle through this has
been, 'Do the areas of strict noncompliance rise to the level of discrimination?' If something is off by an
inch, which we have in some
instances, does that truly affect the
ability of someone to use that facility?
And in some cases it might."
For example, a toilet seat that's an
inch above or below ADA guidelines
could potentially make a whole bathroom inaccessible, she said.
Since state and local guidelines
often clash with the ADA guidelines,
there often are problems. National
guidelines may seem more important
than state or local building codes, but

Smythe said that satisfying local
guidelines is essential.
"If you don't satisfy [their guidelines] then you're not going to be able
to occupy your building," she said.
Smythe gave the example of a
ramp outside of the Science Center.
ADA guidelines specify that the distance between the railing and a wall
can be no more than an inch and half
so someone's elbow doesn't get stuck.

When the Science Center was built,
however, there was a local building
code that required railings to be two
and a half inches away from the wall
so firemen could fit their gloves in
the space.
"That's a perfect example where
the architects did what they thought
was the right thing," she said.
Recently, however, it's been helpful that the borough of Swarthmore
has become more vigilant in mirroring their building guidelines off of
ADAAG, Smythe said.
Though it's "fair to say that [the
architects] don't always" comply with
ADA guidelines in their plans,
Smythe said that it's "obviously not
[the guideout of maliciousness
lines] just may not be at the top of
their radar."

Recently, however, Smythe has

worked closely with consultants in
the construction of the dorm David
Kemp, which barely had any ADAAG
violations. With this close connection, Smythe said that she and others
tried "to catch everything as it came
up." As a result, "we ended up with a
building with almost no issues." The
few violations the building did end up
having, such as the amount of time
an elevator door remains open, were
easy to fix and were fixed, she said.
When asked if it's feasible for a
facility to be fully compliant, Smythe
said that consultants have told her
no.
"They'll tell you there's always
something," she said. But, she added,
it is very possible during construction to make sure that there are no
major ADAAG

In contrast to the fluctuations in housing policy of

recent years, no major changes to the housing situation are taking place this year.

According to Myrt Westphal, former housing coordinator and current assistant dean of student life, the
recent expansion of on campus housing options has
eliminated some of the more unpopular housing
options.

"With the advent of David Kemp, we were able to
close down Mary Lyons basement, and we were able to
assure that each of the Dana and Hallowell floors have
a lounge," Westphal said.
"In the past, those lounges have often had to be converted into rooms. This year, those are only a couple of
the commitments that we are particularly making to
Dana and Hallowell, and for good residential life experience in general."
Further, the transition from the cohort system to
the computerized average lottery system will come to
completion this year, as the last class under the old sysgraduates.
tem
the class of'O9
"We've not really made any changes for the upcoming year because it's a student-developed system," said
Rachel Head, Assistant Dean of Residential Life and
new housing coordinator this year. "We've gotten a
couple of students who given a little pushback about
things like joint tenancy rules, but those are policies
that have always been in place but people said they
were not held to in the past," she said.
The cohort system was designed so that each studentwas in the top third ofhis or her class either sophomore, junior or senior year; in the middle third another year; and in the bottom third a different year. This
resulted in some students being at the bottom of the
third each of their three years, leaving them with poor
housing choices for their Swarthmore career.
Maggie Ladlow 'O9 and George Dahl 'OB designed the
average lottery number logarithm three years ago, a
project they took on to rectify the woes of their own
housing experiences under the cohort system.
A potential source of future complications in housing is the planned increase in the number of students
on campus, a decision made in part due to the economic crisis. According to Westphal, the college does
intend to increase the number of students on campus
next year by a total of 10-15 students.
Specifically, the increases that Head foresees in
upcoming years are primarily in the number of transfer students being accepted for the 2009-2010 school
approximately 27, up from last year's 15 and
year
a slight augmentation in the size of upcoming classes
to compensate for the departure of the unusually large
class of 'O9.
The college is accommodating their housing needs
by converting some Parrish doubles into triples, opening up some rooms in Strath Haven, and adding a fifth
person to each of the remaining Lodges.
However, no major changes, overflow, or building
projects are expected to be necessary in the near
future.
There are also no projected changes in special needs
-

housing policies.
According to Head, a certain number of rooms are
set aside each year based upon a "number of factors,
including how many special needs beds we used in the
previous two to three years, trends that we are seeing
within the classes, and size of the incoming class,"

Head said in an e-mail.
Students who require special needs housing are not
included in the lottery; rather, they provide the school
with medical documentation of their needs and the
school finds appropriate accommodations based on
that need. The housing coordinator typically makes
sure to provide special needs accommodations that are
similar to the regular accommodations of other students in the same year while still addressing that student's condition.
Generally these rooms are not included in the lottery because they cater to specific needs, such as tile,

Fulbright Scholars announced Students react to the
intricacies of housing

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Eight Swarthmore students have been named
Fulbright Scholars in recent weeks, while a few
finalists are still awaiting notification, according
to Fellowships and Prizes Advisor Melissa

Mandos. Madeleine Case 'O9, Latavia Elmore 'O9,
Alison Flamm 'O9, Laura Rainey 'O9, Sofia
Rivkin-Haas 'O9, Lauren Stadler 'O6, Lauren
Stokes 'O9 and Miranda Weinberg 'O9 will spend
the next year studying or teaching abroad as part
of a federally funded exchange program aimed at
promoting international cooperation. Each year,
approximately 7,500 grants are awarded for
teaching and research projects in 155 participating countries.

Madeleine Case: A History Major and Latin
American Studies Minor, Case will be working
for a feminist peace organization in Colombia
and has been granted an assistantship teaching
English at a university. "I wanted to get to
Colombia to take part in the social justice campaigns going on there," she said in an e-mail.
Latavia Elmore: A Double Major in
Sociology and Anthropology and Russian,
Elmore will be traveling to Kazakhstan to complete a project called "In the Imagination of a
Nation: Kazakhstan Connecting Diversity to
Unity." Elmore said that her junior year abroad,
which she spent in Georgia and Turkey, influenced her to study delve deeper into the ideas of
ethnicity, religion, and imagined communities.
"I decided to continue studying imagined nationhood from a different angle in Kazakhstan,
which proclaims itself to be both a Kazakh
nation and a multinational state simultaneously," she said in an e-mail. "There is a significant
Russian population in Kazakhstan and a substantialRussified Kazakh population as well, so I
was interested in what Kazakhstan's 'peace'
looks like and how ethnicity has been shaped in

Kazakhstan." Elmore also received the State
Department's Critical Language Scholarship to
study Russian in Kazan, Tatarstan prior to her
trip to Kazakhstan.
Alison Flamm:

A Double Chinese and
Economics Major, Flamm is headed to China to

conduct economic research on the health hazards of water pollution. Last summer, Flamm
worked as a research assistant for an economist
doing work around water pollution and digestive
cancers in China, which inspired her project
plans. "I have spent parts of two summers in
China and knew that I enjoyed living there, and
felt like there would be a lot of opportunities for
learning and personal growth (and fun!) if I were
to return for a longer period of time," she said in
an e-mail. "Once I became intrigued by the water
pollution topic, a Fulbright seemed a natural
way to spend more time in China."
Laura

A Psychology
Rainey:
Educational Studies Special Major and Spanish

Minor, Rainey will be teaching English at a public elementary school in Madrid. "I had studied
abroad in Madrid my junior year and loved the
city. So when I learned that Madrid was the only
city in Europe to offer Fulbright ETAs in elementary schools, it just seemed like the perfect
option for me to pursue," she said. Rainey will
mix her teaching experience with volunteer
opportunities throughout the city.
Sofia Rivkin-Haas: An Honors English
Major and Honors History Minor, Rivkin-Haas
has been granted an assistantship to teach
English to Vietnamese college students. RivkinHaas said that after living in Vietnam for a brief
period, this trip has personal significance to her
and her family. "It's important [to me and my
family] to participate in this educational
exchange," she said. "It is a well-established program, I knew I wanted to be in one place [for an
extended period], and I'm excited to be an ambassador for learning." Rivkin-Haas will also be
studying Vietnamese water puppetry, a performance tradition that is centuries old.
Lauren Stadler: An Engineering Major,
Stadler has been awarded a grant to do research

THE PHOENIX

on wastewater treatment in India. Currently she
works for GO2 Water, Inc., which treats wastewater in an environmentally friendly and natural way. "Working at GO2 Water introduced me
to the potential of algae to be a fuel, food and fertilizer," she said in an e-mail. "The focus of my
research is peripherally related to the work I do
now, and is an area that I am very interested in
learning more about. The combination of wastewater treatment technology, and nutrient reclamation in the form of algae has the potential to
do a lot of good, particularly in India where pond
systems are common, fertilizers are heavily
used, and malnutrition is a problem." Realizing
that she wanted more opportunities to delve
deeper into this subject, Stadler tailored her project idea to be appropriate for India. "I need to
start designing a research work plan with my
advisor at the Indian Agricultural Research
Institute in New Delhi, and I am in the process of
collecting background research while I am still
in the States," she said.

Honors German Studies Minor and German

in

project. Affiliated with the Free University of
Berlin, Stokes will be studying the way the
Holocaust is taught to high school students in an
increasingly diverse and multicultural setting.
"The curriculum is based on [the idea that their]
forefathers were Nazis. But there's a big population of immigrants
how do you engage them
and what does that mean for Holocaust remembrance?" Stokes said. "There's a big problem of

Committee.
"We've had some really interesting ideas, like maybe we could
make it so that one time in your
freshman, sophomore or junior
year you would live off-campus,
but you'd know it would be only
once, and it wouldn't be in your
senior year. Those are things for
the [Housing] Committee to consider," Head said. "[TJhey'll poll
the students and see what the students want," she said.
In the meantime, Westphal
encourages students to "make
their housing choices based on
human interactions, who you
want to live near, and things like
that, rather than try to pull in
somebody who has a better num-

air conditioning, first-floor, private bathrooms and single gender
housing. Head said that more
housing is held for special needs
than they think is required so
that all specific needs can be met.
Once all accommodations have
been filled, the extra rooms are
opened to waitlist-housing stu-

dents.
One student, who requested
anonymity, is going through the
special needs housing process
and pointed to some of the side
effects of the process.
"Pretty much everyone would
say it'd be taken care of, but once
it came time to actually receive
our housing, everyone on campus
knew where they were living, and
I know at least three or four of us
didn't actually know where we
were going to be, and our accommodations weren't doable," the
student said.
"After an extra week of investigating 'What could have gone
wrong if you had all of my medical records?'
they finally came
around and gave us accommodations that were fitting Overall,
they were helpful. It just took a
lot of visits, a lot of questions, a
lot ofemails to get it done."
While Head has received students' requests for specific policy
changes, the ultimate decision
lies in the hands of the Housing

ber."

However, not all of the students are complaining about a
housing system in which benefits
are conferred upon upperclassmen in general and seniors in

particular.

Refugees reconsider Iraq
For Iraqi refugees, making it to the
United States can be a long and difficult
process. Often, refugees waitfor years in
Syria and Jordan before they arefinally
approved to come to the States. Once they
arrive in the U.S., most support programs for refugees only last for the first
few months. Now with the economy
going downhill, some Iraqis in the U.S.
are considering going back to Iraq. This
piece shares the stories of two Iraqi
refugees: one man whose two-year dream
of coming to America may finally be
coming true, and another who made it to
the U.S. this January, but is struggling
to build a life here. This piece was
reported for War News Radio by Hansi
Lo Wang 'O9, Emily Hager 'lO and

Abdulla Mizead, and written up for The
Phoenix by Jenna Zhu 'l2.
John Muftah, a member of the small

Iraqi Mandaean religious community,

worked as a translatorfor the U.S. military in Iraq for three years, starting
when he was sixteen years old. In 2007,
when his father was shot and killed in
Baghdad, Muftah fled the country with
his mother and two older brothers.
Since then, they've been living in Syria,
unable to work and surviving in part
on money sent by Muftah's three sisters, who live in Sweden and New York.
Just this week, he got a call scheduling the last interview in his application process to come to the U.S. He's
hopeful that soon, he and his mother
and brothers will be able to join his sister and her husband in New York City.
Despite the current state of the U.S.
economy, Muftah is not worried about
finding a job. The International
Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental group which is helping
him with the application process to
come to the United States, gives
refugees financial assistance, provides
English classes and helps them with
the job search for the first eight months
after they arrive in the U.S. Recalling
his interview with the lOM, Muftah
recounts, "If you tell us what your jobs
were in Iraq, the guys in America will
try and get you the same job in the U.S.
For me, it's very easy, because I speak
English it's no problem." He says he
wants to go to medical school, and in
the meantime, he believes that he has
many job options in New York. "I'd be
happy to work at any place. My sister
said that New York City is different
it's the city that
than other states
never sleeps. So there are many opportunities to work there."
For Muftah and his mother and
brothers, there will be a support network even if they can't find work; they
-

-

will be able to live with his sister, who
has been in the city since 2003. The
prospects of finding a job in New York
are better than in Syria, where most
Iraqi refugees are not legally allowed to
work at all.
But most Iraqi refugees coming to
the United States don't have much support, and aid from international organizations and the State Department lasts
only for a few months. Late last year,
the U.S. State Department implemented
a program to help bring to the United
States Iraqis who are in danger because
they worked for American companies
in Iraq. Sajad Mohammad, who worked
for an American news organization,
arrived in the U.S. in January
but
they're about to run out of aid and he

Mohammed recalls. "But I think we

came in a very bad time; we came in the
very wrong time. The U.S. economy is
falling apart, and I think the people in
charge of this program should stop it
during this hard economic time. As you
know, here in America, it is very hard
if you don't have a job."
Mohammad had trouble finding a
job, and his old bosses did nothing to
help him. "After that, we began to feel
homesick and we became depressed.
We stayed at home, feeling choked and

said
Less than four months after

arriving in lowa, Mohammad
bought tickets to go back to Iraq
despite the danger he would face
-

there. Before he left the country,
he was targeted with a bomb
placed inside his car while he was
working. He still remembers the
trauma: "For about a month and a
half after the explosion, I tried to
hide my feelings from my family,
but I was exhausted. I wanted to
sit with them, I wanted them to
talk to me, and I wanted them to
express their sympathy for me. I
wanted them to give me a hug."
For Iraqis who have come to
the United States, going back to
Iraq is a difficult choice. They
face the possibility of more
threats and violence, because
they are more strongly associated
with the Americans. The wait for
refugees to get permission to
come to the United States at all
can be years.
Here, Mohammad feels that he
and his family have been left out
in the cold. He's had to give up on
a lot of his old dreams. "I have no
more ambitions for myself,"
Mohammed says. "It's true that I
am only 26 years old and still
young, and the road is still open
for me; but my only concern now
is to look after my children. I
want to work and struggle for
their sake, so that I can secure
their future. But for me, I have
put a stop on all my ambitions."

Worthstock trades in big names for bigger line-up

Having won the Battle of the Bands, The Horticulture will open the
night time line-up for Worthstock.

BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.edu
There is no better way to
indulge in temporary amnesia
about the academic stress of
finals season than a whole day
and night of listening to live
music. On Saturday, May 2, the
yearly Worthstock music festival
will provide plenty of opportunity for students to engage in
simultaneous distraction,

de-

stressing and/or discombobulation through campus-wide musical entertainment. Organized by
the Large-Scale Event committee, Worthstock will be a defining

musical event that will wrap up
the noteworthy list of artists that
have performed during the
school year such as Estelle,
Broken Social Scene and RJD2.
"It will be the most physically
demanding show we've ever
done," LSE Committee Head

Reid Wilkening 'lO said.
year's
However,
this
Worthstock will not feature a
major buzz worthy headliner
compared to the ones that have
played in previous years, such as
2008's Yo La Tengo and 2006's The
Rosebuds. Instead, the LSE has
opted for a more low-key but
comparatively bigger artist lineup which will include eight
bands, four of which have been
scheduled to play during the day
and the other four during the
night.

Unconventionally,

the

venue has also changed for the
night-time performances, all of
which will now be held at Olde
Club as opposed to Worth courtyard. This movement in venue is
largely due to "budget constraints," as Wilkening confirmed. The daytime performances will proceed in Worth courtyard as per usual.
"There's a really diverse line-

The bands and artists that
have been chosen to perform
during the day are Blue Light
Vinegar
Special,
Creek
Constituency, Dawn Landes and
Takka Takka. Collectively speaking, their music caters to a
lighter, more easygoing sound
and genre that befits the daytime
atmosphere, like classic blues,
American bluegrass and indie
pop/rock. Based in Central
Pennsylvania and "100 percent
American-made" Blue Light
Special classifies itself as a wellestablished blues cover band
whose wide repertoire includes
Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf,
Stevie Ray, Etta James, Muddy
and Junior Wells, along with several of their own songs. Vinegar
Creek Constituency, a folk bluegrass/rockabilly group from
Lancaster with a tendency
towards fun punk rock ditties,
comes complete with a classically trained double bassist and a
rock 'n' roll singer-songwriter.

endearing hybrid of melodic
anti-folk, country and folk
music, often tinged with unusual
instrumentation like the accor-

dion, the glockenspiel and the
Optigan, has enjoyed much
recent critical success. Landes'
warm, simple melodies and honest lyrics should appeal to indie
pop lovers, cynical music elites

and mainstream listeners alike.
Takka Takka, a currently rising
Brooklynite band, aims for
"something occasionally otherworldly" as Pitchfork Magazine
points out, by incorporating
world music elements of Afropop
and poly'rhythm in their essentially undie folk rock sound.
Takka Takka has been considered a hidden gem of the

Brooklyn indie scene, with their
dreamy, unobtrusive yet oddly
foreboding music.
"I only listened to their songs
on Myspace, and [Takka Takka]

was pretty sick," said Michael
Xu 'll, who had suggested the
band to the LSE Committee. "I
hope they will be as good live and
I can't wait to see them!"
During the evening, at Olde
Club, the artist line-up abruptly
switches to a more hardcore and
rousingly rockish, hip-hop and
danceable sensibility in musical
content. First off, the winning
student band The Horticulture
from last week's Battle of the
Bands is set to open the night's
festivities.

that have stirred audiences.

from the indie electronica band
Lemonade follow up U.S.
Royalty's brand of rock with a
straight up dish of delirious and
post-punkish dance music that
channels Euro techno with a
harder edge. According to
Pitchfork Magazine, Lemonade's
self-titled debut album "vividly
replicates that first sensation of
losing yourself in a peak-hour,
strobe-lit reverie, where the communal act of-dancing teeters
between liberation and disorientation."
Not to be missed is the outrageous local Philly rap crew
Plastic Little, prone to pop-culture pastiches and risque one-liners like "Why date her, if I can

rape her?"

in their music, who
have been described as the
"purest, most unaffected fun
available in hip-hop right now"
by The Guardian in the U.K. For
all of their polemic hoo-ha
Plastic Little continues to gain
mainstream momentum in the
r

scene, having performed alongside Mark Ronson, Jay-Z and
Santogold, while having remixed

Hot Chip and Just Jack and also
collaborated with British DJ/producer Herve on the party electronica staple Cheap Thrills. For
Worthstock's evening schedule,
Plastic Little may be the big, stupendous name that will blow
everyone's minds.

used communal bathrooms. And,
let me tell
youasaveteran of this

it's
place,
not always easy to find a special little
nook when you really need that private
bathroom time. This leads to many awkward moments, and, speaking for us
ladies, lots of strategizing of how best to
execute a quick release or an invisible
exit. Girls, I know you've been there. As a
fan of bathrooms myself, I made it a goal
to find that one special bathroom for those

emergency moments. In order to get there,
I'd like to "x-nay" a few contenders.
McCabe: Now, I know many people
who love to sneak away to McCabe for a
quick rip. Worst idea ever. For one, the
stalls are so tiny, you're practically sitting
on top of the person next to you. Worse,
there is no way to avoid the colorful
footwear of your neighbor, which means

THE PHOENIX

they too can identify you when you patter
past them later (and you will). Last, the
fact that all of the McCabe bathrooms are
on quiet floors means that the poor, unfortunate soul at the computer next to the
bathroom is bound to hear everything.
Can I get a lil' upside down turtle?
Parrish: Lots of lovin' tends to go out
to the Parrish Ist toilets, but, really? Not
only are those bathrooms a hub for students, they're a hub for faculty. The last
thing I want my favorite Dean to know is
that I am the one responsible for the overflow in the ladies room.
Trotter: Some like Trotter because of
its individual bathrooms, but the bathrooms in Trotter echo like valleys and
anyone walking by or studying in the
adjacent lounge is sure to hear you.
Worse, your professor is probably the one
waiting in line behind you.
Hicks: If you're a woman, the individual bathroom in Hicks is a nightmare.
Located right next to the lobby where all
of the students study at night, any blows
from you are sure to topple over their latest scaffold and call for a rosy cheekful of
embarrassment when you exit. The basement of Hicks is sure to provide a quiet,
more private space for bathroom goers;
however, at night, it's a little too creepy
squatting in a basement full of machinery,
surrounded by knife-cutting silence.
Beware of creepsters.
Beardsley: The quaintly tiled floor
...

and framed paintings might be nice, but
you still know who your neighbor is, especially in Departments as intimate as
Studio Arts, CS or Media Services.
Science Center: Many fanatics of the
Science Center will stick to their belief
that it's the place to be when you need to
get that load off. My input: While the 2nd
floor bathroom of Cornell is entertaining
for us ladies who get to write messages to
one another on the papered stalls, it's a
tad awkward when two people are in
there, and any noises are sure to have a
ripple effect. The basement of the Science
Center also has some appeal; however,
have you experienced the static on the
stalls? Hair is always stuck to the stall
doors, and your clothing is sure to inch its
way there as well.
Sharpies: Need I say more? Let's not
ruin appetites.
Tarble: Many like Tarble, but it's a little too creepy at night.
My ultimate favorite: Have you ever
explored Lang Music Hall? I must apologize to the music and theater majors for
letting this one out, but as a graduating
senior, I no longer worry about the fact
that this might cause a mad horde of students heading to this oh-so-sacred spot. In
the basementof Lang Music Hall, you will
find a door. This door will lead you to a
dressing room that consists of one very
large make-up mirror, surrounded by
very bright light bulbs. Lock that door

April 30, 2009

behind you. Then, you will find another
door inside this beauty parlor. Open it and
behold the most sacred of all toilets. Shut
it, lock it, and take a seat. You will find
yourself inside of a little cubicle, large
enough for you to sit and put your backpack down. In front of you, you'll find a little shower. Here, your sounds are forever
secret, your smells forever confined, and
your identity forever concealed. You can
take as long as you'd like; heck, for those
who like to do a little work while on the
100, whip out that laptop of yours and get
typing. Some of my most ingenious pieces
have come from this very same spot (truth
or lie? I'll leave that to you).
Although this is my last column, I have
a few more bucket list items yet to conquer. And, have no fear, by the time I step
across that sacred Amphitheatre stage to
claim that diploma, I will have met all 71
of the 'o9ers I have never met, I will have
worn the Phoenix outfit at least once, I
will have swum in the Crum one last time,
and I will have finally completed that
looming cloud-of-a-thesis. Thank you for
reading along in this final journey. Some
of my greatest memories at Swat have
been a direct result of this biweekly
adventure. Forever indebted to this amazing place, I end with a little OH NIIINE!
'lO, 'll, 'l2, please carry on the torch and
make me proud.

'Macbeth' meets body art, The Kinks and the Cram

of the project, Shahidi and Aarons
responded in unison, "two words: Jackie
Vitale." Perelstein and Compton's responses were of the same tenor.
Perhaps it is Vitale's sense of fun that
keep people coming back. While she is certainly innovative enough to be called an
experimental theater director, Vitale
rejects some of the notions that come along

Parrish Beach and through Parrish Hall.
Vitale is determined, as she was with
"Merma," to make "Macbeth" an event,

something more than just a play. "I chose a
team of people that I thought would make
great collaborators, who would bring a lot

of cool ideas and generate a lot of material
who wouldn't be afraid," Vitale said.
Dan Perelstein 'O9, who is the musical
...

director and sound designer for the play in
the place of a senior recital for his Honors
Music major, has worked with Vitale on
many projects in the past, including "The
Last Five Years," in which Vitale costarred with Colin Aarons 'O9, the lead in
"Macbeth" and "The Wild Party," which
Perelstein and Vitale co-directed. Sasha

If you've noticed a sudden increase in
the populationof tattooed students on campus, do not be alarmed; facial tattoos are
not the new "it" thing this season. Rather,
these sudden tattoo sightings are the first
hint of the things to come with the Honors
Directing Thesis of Jacqueline Vitale 'O9,
William Shakespeare's "Macbeth."
The cast and crew have been very tightlipped about the production, so every
detail that has slipped out, from the names
of the people involved to the location of the
production, generates buzz. "Macbeth"
will be performed outdoors, in Crum
Henge, the designated site for campus bonfires. For those familiar with Vitale's al
fresco work (her Directing II production of
"Merma" in the Spring of 2007), the choice
seems like a promise of adventures to
come. Add to this the fact that the performers include multiple jazz musicians

and dancers, and most people will draw
even stronger links to "Merma," which

Dance concert ranges from tap dance to Taiko
BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu
The Department of Music and
Dance once again delivered a
diverse set of performances during its Spring Student Dance
Concert. This semester's pieces
ranged through many different
traditions of dance and music,
from Flamenco to Taiko to West
African drumming. The energy
at the concert was amazing, and
each piece was executed with a
grace and skill that helped spec-

tators to feel and experience the
different cultures surrounding
each performance.
Friday's show included a special guest performance frbm a
group out of Philadelphia: Alokli
West African Dance. Alok||, led
by Dan Gorlin, performed pieces
from the West African tradition
that rocked the beginning of the
concert. The featured beats held
a great power and intensity that

which reflected the sense of cultural unity displayed in the performance.

What followed Alokli (and

was the reflection of the great

Additionally, Genise Choy
will exhibit a series of painted
portraits, an ambitious project

considering that her only exposure to painting comes in the
form of a semester-long landscape
painting class. The focus of her
work, however, is not landscape,
but human portraits presented in

an unconventional manner. Her

paintings often mix black-andwhitewith color, and subjects are
usually positioned amid unrealis-

tic scenery. When asked

why

she

chose to pursue portraiture, Choy
responded, "the likelihood that 1

something that every great artist

together; it is Pub Nite.

For those who don't know, I like Pub Nite. It is a weekly debacle taking place each Thursday, involving tables,
students, five or six kegs and loud music, and it is
absolutely the highlight of my week. Why I like Pub Nite
is not because it is a rowdy good time, although that is
very true. I like Pub Nite because on the spectrum of
party-like events on this campus, it is the great equalizer. Some may be skeptical of this statement, but I hope
that I can convince you and bring you around to see the
light. Because when the founding Quakers referred to
the inner light, they were clearly talking about the glorious halo of drunken revelry that surrounds Pub Nite.
If you position yourself in the middle of Paces around
10:30 p.m. on a Thursday night and look around yourself,
you will see a surprisingly accurate cross-section of
Swarthmore's student body. The athletes are there, the
alternative crowd is there, the frat boys, the LaSS girls,
even a few science nerds can all be seen, as well as a
whole mass of people who fit into none of these categories. It is a space where the multitude of social groups
comes together, more so than any other party space on
campus, I would argue. The only noticeable exception is
the substance-free crowd, and while .that is a sizeable
portion of Swarthmore's student body, I don't think it is
realistic to expect a party to be so inclusive that it
attracts the people who don't party. But seriously, where
else could you find such a mix? The athletes rarely go to
Olde Club, the alternative kids rarely go to Paces parties,
the Paces regulars are too scared to go to the frats, the
Barn kids don't feel like trekking over to campus to do

embrace of Pub Nite.
Forgive my use of labels, because I dislike these generalizations as much as the next person, but let's face it:
people develop close groups of friends, and these groups
often have unifying factors, which are useful in studies
of social behavior such as this. If Swarthmore were the
African savannah, and one was studying social behavior
in grassland ecosystems, Pub Nite would totally be the
communal watering hole.
Additionally, for anyone who may feel that Pub Nite is
not the bastion of inclusion that I am arguing here, there
are a number of ways in which it is open to newcomers
and potential changes. One of these ways is, surprisingly, the admission fee of $3 for seniors, $2 for non-drinkers
and $4 for everyone else. In the relatively cost-free environment of Swarthmore (once you pay the arm and a leg
it takes to get here, that is), a party with an admission fee
seems exclusionary at first glance. But take the time to
think about it: the funds go to the senior class, which
everyone who graduates from here will one day be a part
of and therefore reap the benefits of. The fee is otherwise
universal, with the exception of seniors, which the above
reasoning also applies to, and non-drinkers, which is
really only fair, considering the principle cost is the
beer. The admission fee is also ridiculously affordable,
especially when compared with the cost of a beer at your
average bar.
The music is also more welcoming than one might initially think; true, the traditional songs like "American
Pie" and "Closing Time" are pretty set in stone, but the
rest of the average playlist is extremely variant. Artists
typically played range from The Roots to Of Montreal,
The Beatles to TLC, and everything (sometimes literally)

Internet serials: big talent in very small packages
swarthmorephoenix.com

I discovered something
wonderful today.
As I was working in my
swelteringly hot room (and
by working I mean staring
at a notebook full of scribblings about my upcoming
seminar paper, attempting
to summon the energy
needed to shape them into
some coherent form), I
decided that I needed a
break from all the notAlex Israel

curled up on my bed, and
started thinking about T.V.
shows that I could watch.
"Lost"? Seen every episode, some multiple times.
"Gossip Girl"? Completely caught up. "Kings"? Banished
to finish its run over the summer. (Apparently, the executives of NBC don'tread this column, which I find shocking.) What's a T.V. fanatic to do?
After I had run through the list of shows that I actually follow (and realized that it is entirely too long), I started thinking about shows that I should watch but don't,
the long since ended cultural touchstones and cult classics that I've never caught up on. At this point, a memory of something my friend and my roommate have been
repeating recently ran through my head. "Watch a Joss
Whedon show," their voices chime in unison. "Howabout
"Buffy," or "Firefly"? They're awesome..."
Now, I don't have time to watch an entire television
series straight through. (Well, unless it's "Arrested
Development" or "Freaks and Geeks" or the first season
of "Gossip Girl," but those don't count. I don't know why,
but they don't). I certainly don't have time to plow
through seven seasons of "Buffy," one season plus a
movie of "Firefly," or 10 episodes of Whedon's newest
show, "Dollhouse." What I do have, however, is forty-five
minutes, which is just enough time to watch the entirety
of Whedon's three-part web series, "Dr. Horrible's SingAlong Blog."

"Dr. Horrible," for those who haven't heard of it, was
shown entirely on the Internet and can currently be
found in its entirety on Hulu.com. The series stars Neil
Patrick Harris (of "How I Met Your Mother" and, spectacularly, both "Harold and Kumar" movies) as Dr.
Horrible, an aspiring super villain "with a Ph.D. in horribleness" who posts a video blog in which he discusses
his plans for world domination, dreams about being
admitted to the Evil League of Evil (ELE), and occasion-

when viewers discover that Bad Horse's name is very,
very literal.

ally answers reader mail. Dr. Horrible's goal in life
besides getting admitted to the ELE
is to win the affection of Penny (Felicia Day), the cute girl he sees at the
Laundromat every week but can't get up the nerve to talk
to, as well as to vanquish his nemesis, Captain Hammer
(Nathan Fillion of "Firefly").
The show is weird and quirky in the best possible way,
with the characters commonly breaking into song and
Dr. Horrible and Captain Hammer outfitted in clothes
that appear to have cost about twenty cents per outfit
(which is probably because they did). The show also contains several entertaining supporting characters, such as
Moist (Simon Helberg of "The Big Bang Theory"), a
minor villain who, "at [his] most badass, makes people
want to take a shower." Other entertainment comes in
the form of Bad Horse Chorus, a group of three singing
cowboys who pass along the messages of Bad Horse,
leader of the ELE, in the form of singing telegrams.
"Dr. Horrible" is funny and witty, but by the end of the
third part, it has taken a turn towards tragedy (albeit
tragedy with a healthy dose of absurdism thrown in).
This is apparently par for the course with Joss Whedon
shows, but I certainly wasn't prepared for the ease with
which the transition was made. The darkness of the end
of the show, however, is leavened in the final scene, in
which Dr. Horrible is finally allowed into the ELE, and

One reason that "Dr. Horrible" works so well is that
the short format of fifteen-minute episodes ensures that
none of the absurdity suffers from being dragged out for
too long. The entire story arc takes place in just 45 minutes, and the episode length is perfect for a brief study
break or, if you're me, a brief study break that leads to
watching the whole 45 minutes in one sitting, and then
scouring the internet for other web-based series, at which
time I realized that the short, web-based format works for
genres other than the musical sci-fi comedy.
One of the best of the current crop of Internet serials
besides, obviously, "Dr. Horrible"
is "Angel of
Death," one of many serials available on Crackle.com.
"Angel" is a violent, stylized serial, created by Ed
Brubaker, who is (according to my sources) a comic-book
legend; it stars Zoe Bell (who was Uma Thurman's stunt
double in "Kill Bill," so you know she's a badass) as Eve,
a sexy assassin who works for a shadowy organization
and goes around killing people. The show's episodes are
even shorter than those of "Dr. Horrible," generally
clocking in at about seven minutes, but they manage to
pack a hell of a lot of gore, mayhem and general awesome
into those seven minutes. The first episode alone features
both a schoolgirl getting shot in an elevator and Eve getting a four-inch knife stuck in her head.
Just like "Dr. Horrible," "Angel of Death" works
because the short time frame keeps the story moving
quickly. The aforementioned moments of extreme vioparticularly the death of the schoolgirl
lence
are
shocking because, unlike in movies like "Sin City" or
"300" that share a similar visual style, they come quickly, without the kind of overlong buildup that makes violence predictable. Also, the length of the episodes keeps
the style from becoming too grating, as happens in all but
the very best hyper-stylized comic-book films.
"Dr. Horrible" and "Angel of Death" are only two of the
many available web-only shows. These series abound
because they are available for free anywhere with an
Internet connection, and because some of them are quite
well made and contain many big names. Internet serials
certainly aren't going to replace television anytime soon,
because there is still a demand for high-quality TV., and
because so much good work is being done on television
now (if you can sift past innumerable episodes of
"According to Jim" and "Rock ofLove Bus" to find it), but
serials like "Dr. Horrible" and "Angel ofDeath" show the
potential of the Internet as a new medium for storytelling.

THE PHOENIX

I'm still figuring that one out
For those of you who have been following my gloriously gluttonous time here,
it's pretty obvious that I am having a really hard time saying hasta luego to my
adopted country. Along with the big
tourist draws like Puerta de Sol or the
Prado, Madrid is so full of little tiny
streets, cave-like bars and little plazas that
I feel that this semester has been hardly
enough time to get a glimpse of madrileno
culture, let alone Spanish culture.
There are so many certain specifically
Spanish experiences that I am going to
really miss. Like hearing the rolling r's
and subtle lisp of my poetry professor as
he reads Neruda only a few blocks away
from where the poet lived in Madrid. Or
screaming my head off at a Real Madrid
game as my camera records what I later
find out to be 20 minutes of my own hand
jumping up and down. Or sipping a
cerveza clara at an intimate flamenco
show and watching the male dancer sweat
completely through two shirts. I'm serious; the beads of sweat flying off of him
and onto some unfortunates seated in the
front row were epic. Hot.
That's not to say I'm not excited to
head back over the Atlantic. Of course I

miss the big things like my family and
friends, and I also miss the little things
like peanut butter, affordable books and
oh, racial sensitivity. And you know
what? I really, really miss Swarthmore.
When I visited a university here, I actually was hit by such a wave of simultaneous
longing and self-loathing at my own geekiness that I cracked open the door of a random empty classroom. Only to see roughly 100 students turn around and stare at
me. Instead of shutting the door calmly, I
turned and ran down the stairs. Because I
am a jerk.
However, I've come to realize that the
things I will miss the most aren't things
that are particularly Spanish or
American. I will miss my professors, the
Hamilton College staff and my friends in
the program, of course. But also things
like how my Senora inexplicably irons my
underwear (there are now pleats in my
ratty Limited Too undies from sixth
grade) and uses her vacuum cleaner on
my walls. Or the bookshop owner who
makes me coffee and lets me sit in his
squishy armchair and read all afternoon.
Or how the family dog Bendita tries to lick
my face with a tongue that I am fairly certain he recently used to lick himself. Or

April 30, 2009

perhaps even the weird kid who is always
practicing his bagpipes two floors down
and who I refuse to give dos besos to in the
elevator after I once saw him picking his
nose and eating his findings. Well, probably not. That was pretty inexcusable.
This realization (See what I did there?
With the development arc?) has been enormously reassuring to me since this means
that essentially what I'm going to miss
most are the human and/or canine connections that I've forged here. It seems
that in spite of the best efforts of the
Swawk, I have somehow managed to have

some pretty worthwhile interactions in
Madrid, many of which I am almost
entirely certain are not driven by pity. I'd
like to think that means there is hope for
all of us Swawkward people. Hopefully
that's enough revelation for you or I'll
have to dip into my emergency backup
material. Something about how I learned
the secrets of happiness from Bendita the
dog. You know, life being good as long as
you have someone to feed table scraps to
you or to scratch your ears. Yeah, I didn't
think so. So for the last time, ta luego y
nos vemos en el otono!

that each of you helped to save a life. For
this I am forever in your debt.
To my friends, for your kindness, your
sympathy and your tolerance not only of
my erratic condition but also of my repetitive, inside jokes. I will not bore my readers with these: many involved a JAWS
screen reader for Microsoft Windows,
intended to help the blind but put to horrible misuse, or a surprisingly articulate
velociraptor puppet.
And finally to my family. To my sister,
for probably being the most important
person in the world to me. Also to my
mother and father who, throughout 22
years of illness, never once wavered

in
their care and support. Mom, Dad: I love

you.

Tip: To defeat the cyber-demon, shoot
at it until it dies.
Tip: Laugh when you can. Stop making
yourself suffer so teacher will give you a
gold star. Recognize when you are afraid,
and learn when you cannot protect yourself. Learn to accept horrible and
inevitable things. Learn to be heartbroken, to be hopeless, and then to get better.
Understand that, although it will be
painful, you can never not profit when
you learn something about yourself.
Never limit yourself to what you can control. Do terrifying things. Live. Fucking
live. I mean that.
Game over, man. Press start. Continue.

A case against frivolous
Specter's
spectacle
activism at Swarthmore
StaffEditorial

BY SOREN LARSON

slarsonl@swarthmore.edu

A politically engaged student population
is perhaps one of Swarthmore's most prized
features.
Following
Swarthmore's long history of
student activism, students
today collaborate in various
groups to advance their nearest and dearest causes. But too often this
activism finds reason in cursory research
and secures positive receptions among the
campus community not by cogency and
intensive study, but rather by a pervasive
perfunctory liberal bias among the members of our community. In our rush to participate in some kind of activism, we forget
to thoroughly research the issues that concern us, leaving us with a meager understanding of the problems we strive to confront. And when we confront these issues by
holding a Sharpies takeover, handing out
flyers, or whatever, we misinform our trusting peers, who expect we've scrutinized the
issues about which we seem to be so passionate.
There are many examples. Two weeks
ago, members of the Swarthmore Labor
Action Project (SLAP) handed out flyers
urging students to support the Employee
Free Choice Act (EFCA), which aims to stop
employers from routinely intimidating and
firing workers who try to unionize. [These
claims are flawed.] The flyers that the
activists distributed were compelling
you'd have to be crazy to oppose the bill.
What the flyers failed to address is that the
bill would deny workers the right to secret
ballot elections in unionization authorization campaigns. When I pointed this out to
one of the student activists, they incredulously listened and, in fact, admitted they
didn't even know about this crucial provision. As our conversation proceeded, students passing through Shane Lounge picked
up the misleading flyers, while others, persuaded by the potent pamphlets, chatted
with activists about how they could get
involved. It seemed no one knew about this
issue, or any of EFCA's other provisions
that harm workers and the firms that
employ them.
In an ideologically balanced campus community, no one could blame SLAP for supporting EFCA with its most convincing
arguments. But at Swarthmore, with a leftleaning community that doesn't always
have time to remain fully informed, SLAP's
work is dangerous because its unchallenged

existence purports an analytical supremacy
that liberal students have little trouble
accepting, especially when it involves standing up to "evil corporations." Few of us have
enough time or the disposition to research
issues student activists propose, so the conversation we're so keen on fostering never
happens.

The NOTA campaign also comes to mind.
Although only apparent after The Phoenix
published a front-page feature of the strange
campaign, proponents were concerned

about Student Council's lack of vision and
its detachment from the student body, especially the IC/BCC groups. In last week's article, StuCo President Yongjun Heo 'O9 tried to
positively spin NOTA, but his colleague Vice
President Nate Erskine 'lO responded objectively, asking NOTA supporters to actively
resolve their concerns. If members of
activist groups were so upset about Student
Council's ostensible indifference to their
respective organizations, why didn't some
memberrun? In the activists' rush to stand
up to the system, NOTA advocates forgot to
productively address their concerns. And as
NOTA activists relished in their achievement of becoming radical activists, the community wondered who in the student body
failed the fifth grade.
This trend isn't unique to Swarthmore.
In March, as a part of Power Shift 2009, over
twelve thousand students descended onto
the hill to demand progressive climate
change policy. Laudable their goals may
have been, some Swarthmore students who
attended the conference said many students
who attended knew little beyond the ever-sopopular green buzzwords. I can't blame these
Power Shift participants for striving to learn
more about climate change policy, but their
radical appearance disserved their cause.
As the many uninformed students vociferated their largely unconsidered concerns,
Power Shift's legitimate cause became just
another stunt by the radical left. Climate
change is real, but Bill O'Reilly of Fox would
have little trouble marginalizing the cause,
and viewers ofcable's most popular network
would probably agree.
It might seem like I'm discouraging
activism because the campus' politics aren't
congruent with mine. I'm not. But I am saying that frivolous activism for the sake of
being politically active and the community's
passive acceptance of student activists'
ideas without any kind of discussion can
jeopardize the very causes that students support. Instead of focusing on activism, let's
concentrate on the conversation.

On Tuesday morning, Pennsylvania
Republican Senator Arlen Spector
announced he was switching his party
affiliation to Democrat. Spector had
served as a Republican in the Senate
since 1980 and, as recently as March,
was heard saying "To eliminate any
doubt, I am a Republican and I am running for re-election in 2010 as a
Republican on the Republican ticket."
Spector insists that his shift is an
ideological one. In a statement
released Tuesday morning, Spector
said, "Since my election in 1980, as
part of the Reagan Big Tent, the
Republican Party has moved far to the
right... I now find my political philosophy more in line with Democrats
than Republicans." Fair enough. But
before Democratic voters embrace
Spector, as Barack Obama and Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid have
already done, they should examine
Spector's record to determine how
much of a Democrat Mr. Spector, in
fact, is.
Specter's voting record is a relatively moderate one. Spector voted for
the confirmation of nearly every controversial Bush appointee, approved
all of Bush's major tax cuts, was a
staunch supporter of the Iraq War
until at least 2006, and voted for the
renewal of the Patriot Act. He also
made clear that his opposition to the
pro-union "Employee Free Choice
Act" would continue regardless of his
party affiliation. On the other hand,
Specter has long been a proponent of
stricter environmental legislation, has
been consistently pro-choice and proimmigration, and, more recently, was
one of only three Republicans to vote
for Obama's bailout plan. In balance, it

is difficult to see which party Specter
is more closely aligned with. Specter
concluded his press statement: "I will
continue my independent voting and
follow my conscience." And if he feels
his views are better represented by the
Democratic Party, then, of course, he
has every right to switch affiliations.
The worry, then, is that Specter
switched parties for strictly political
reasons. Myriad polls showed that
Specter's likely challenger in the
Republican Primary, conservative
Republican Pat Toomey, would easily
defeats Specter. It's easy to understand
then, why Specter would say, "I am
unwilling to have my twenty-nine year
Senate record judged by the

Pennsylvania

Republican

primary

electorate."
If Specter refuses to have his record
judged by the Republicans, then it is
extremely important that Specter's
record is judged by the Democrats.
The most worrisome aspect of this
entire process
is that many
Democratic Primary challengers have
already withdrawnfrom the contest as
soon as they learned of Specter's party
change. Barack Obama has pledged
his support for Specter, and the
Democratic
establishment
in
Washington has thus far welcomed
him with open arms. It is critical that
prospective Democratic challengers
do not follow Representative Josh
Shapiro's lead, and decide to pull out
of the race because, in Shapiro's
words, "Spector is now the incumbent
Democratic Senator." Specter's political views are conservative enough
that
Democratic
voters
in
Pennsylvania should be given a real
choice in the 2010 primaries.

Seize the referendum
Next week, Swarthmore students will have a real opportunity to participate in the governance of our school. The Student Council has authorized a
referendum to allow students to determine how the SBC rollover funds will
be spent. While some of the specifics remain up in the air, it is expected that
students will have an opportunity, via Blackboard election, to order their
preferences for how the funds will be used. Furthermore, students can submit their own suggestions as to how the money could be allocated, and
President Yongjun Heo has eagerly accepted many of these recommendations. Credit the Student Council for giving the student body this opportunity. This referendum is an important first step in the overall goal of allowing
the student body a greater say in the administration of our college. We should
take advantage.

MEET the candidates
Vote online through Blackboard this Friday through Sunday, or by paper ballot in Sharpies on Monday or Tuesday
Angela Meng 'l2

Hi fellow Swatties,
My name is Angela Meng 'l2 and I would like to be your
Student Events Advisor. From my experience on SAC, SAO
and a Gazette reporter for StuCo meetings, I understand the
multiple and diverse needs of the student body. My unique
perspectives and involvement in these pertinent student
groups has helped me gain insight on how Student Council
can be more effective, more responsive and more proactive
in fulfilling Swatties' needs and interests.
The Student Events Advisor's duties on StuCo are essentially two-fold: One, to serve as a liaison between SAC and
StuCo and two, to serve as a member of StuCo and propose
innovative ideas to improve Swarthmore.
For the first duty, here are my following ideas:
SAC Office hours: As SEA, I would work to institute SAC office hours where a
1;
SAC member would be in the SAC office for two hours each week and students can drop
by for any SAC-related questions, inquiries, or concerns.
SAC Closet: I will publish an inventory list outlining the contents of the SAC clos2.
et so that students would know what kind of decorations they can borrow from the closet
beforehand and write their proposals accordingly. This list will be updated monthly.
3.
Liaison System: I will promote a more structured SAC liaison system and advocate for each SAC liaison to send a personal e-mail right after the proposals' budgets are
finalized, a week before the event, and the night before the event. I believe this process will
make events run more smoothly, iron out details that the event's organizer may have
missed, etc.
4.
Party Themes: As SEA, I will advise, encourage and work with students to brainstorm more interactive and fun event ideas so we can invigorate and revitalize the Swat
social life. Annual party traditions are important, but I also think it's important to spice
up the social life here with fun, interesting party themes.
As a member of StuCo, I am primarily interested in making the connection between
StuCo and the student body stronger and closer. For this goal, I believe interaction
between the two is key to accomplishing this goal. Here are several of my proposals to do
:

-

so:

Events: Organize a StuCo social event twice each semester to encourage students
L
to stop by and talk with their StuCo representatives. Ideas include fun Parlor Parties, a
monthly off-campus dinner with StuCo members, a luncheon every semester with StuCo
members and important school deans and administration members where students can
drop by for good catered food and chat with their representatives, etc.
2.
Newsletter: A monthly newsletter on current initiatives and StuCo action to
reach out to the student body and keep them up-to-date with what is currently going on in
Student Council meetings. I would work closely with the StuCo secretary to make this hap-

Hilary Pomerantz 'l2
My name is Hilary Pomerantz and I am excited to run

for Students Events Advisor. This year I have been
deeply committed to a number of student organizations,
and through planning parties and academic events, I
have learned how to navigate the funding process.
Because of my experience as a student applying for funding, I can sympathize with the difficulties of securing
money for events. This year I proposed to FFS, Drama
Board and SAC to secure funding for events such as the
Sager Symposium, Drag Ball, Fierce Party and
Valentine's Gay.
I am especially interested in the recent campus dialogue that has centered on two major issues related to
Student Council: budget cuts and the accountability of student government.
As Students Events Advisor, I will work to reimagine the structure of Student
Council in response to student dialogue and bring greater attention to the diverse
needs of the Swarthmore community. In this position, I will also advocate for more
equitable budget funding in light of the imminent budget cuts. As Students Events
Advisor, I will advocate for students seeking funding for a full calendar of events. For
example, I would like to make it possible for student groups to get money for events
before they occur so that we don't have to front money out of our own pockets.
Furthermore, it is important to me to not just help with funding but to make sure that
events play out smoothly by discussing improvements to Rattech services and making
an inventory of the supplies that are available and functional in the SAC closet.
As a member of the White Women Confronting Racism planning committee, I have
worked to maintain an institutional memory for the group. Having an institutional
memory provides our group with a foundation for our long-term visions. I believe
Student Council must have long-term goals, which necessitates the need for a longstanding institutional memory. Additionally, on SQU Board, I have been a part of
many conversations about how to make the group more inclusive and accessible. This
is a conversation I will bring to Student Council.
If elected, I look forward to supporting new and exciting events on campus and
engaging Student Council in difficult conversations, so vote Hilary Pomerantz for
Students Events Advisor.
Joan Kim 'lO
Hello, I'm Joan Kim 10, and I am running to be your
Student Events Advisor.
Serving last year as Campus Life Representative, I was
able to learn how the Student Council functions and works
with other student groups on campus as well as about their
ties to the administration. I sincerely believe that one
semester is not enough for a student to learn about all the
possibilities about being on Council and to successfully see
through long-term projects. For this position in particular,
it is essential to have someone well versed in campus
events as well as Student Council. As someone very
involved in student events and with an open-mind, I am
eager to finish what feels like an unfinished term with the

pen.

3.
Student Groups: I would advocate for StuCo members to continue to invite student groups and follow up with these groups with personal emails and have at least one
StuCo member attend their next event. We would particularly focus on student groups that
have major upcoming events the following week. I have noticed that StuCo reaches out to
student groups and invites their representatives to talk about their groups; however, I
believe that StuCo should continue this interaction by following up with these groups.
4. ' Board of Managers: I advocate inviting student groups to these board meetings,
but with different types of groups each meeting. I have observed that StuCo has started
inviting student group reps to Swarthmore board meetings and I believe that we should
continue in this tradition while specifically inviting representatives of groups that currently have important events or issues on campus.

Qualifications:

L SAC: My experience as a Social Affairs Committee member this past semester will
help my transition as a Student Events Advisor. As a SAC member, I understandthe inside
everything from the SAC proposal to
processes ofhow student events occur on campus
publicity to the actual management of the event.
2. SAO: As co-publicity chair on the Swarthmore Asian Organization board, I have a
first-hand perspective on what it actually takes to put events together and have successful
turnouts, including personally planning and throwing the SAO Traffic Light Paces party.
Concerns about attendance, publicity, and other important details are important, and as
Students Events Advisor, I would do my best to address these needs on Student Council.
3. Daily Gazette: As a Daily Gazette reporter specially assigned to report on Student
Council, I have attended more than ten Student Council meetings and written the StuCo
reports, (http://daily.swarthmore.edu /news/stuco/). I can and do comfortably interact
with sitting StuCo members, grasp how StuCo meetings are run, and appreciate what
StuCo actually does in service to the student body. I am up-to-date on the current business
ofStuCo and feel completely comfortable with jumping right into StuCo. lam ready from
the very first meeting, which is crucial to serving the student body's interests.
If elected as your Student Events Advisor, I promise to make StuCo a more responsive
and interactive body of representatives. Through my experience in different types of student groups on campus, I have the adequate experience and understanding of what and
how to improve the Swarthmore community.
As a Swattie, I can relate to all our shared experiences and needs, especially the social
life; my SAC membership and Gazette involvement on StuCo has taught me the tools on
how to improve it. With my initiative, creativity and experience, I am the most qualified
candidate for the job.
It would be a pleasure to serve my fellow Swatties on Student Council so please vote for
Angela Meng for Student Events Advisor. Thank you.

THE PHOENIX

Student Council.
For the past two years, I have been attending campus events and have helped prepare
for events such as the Halloween party while I was on Student Council last year and
Most imporplanned SAC-funded events such as a Paces party and campus
tantly, I have been a loyal attendee of campus events and believe I have a strong notion of
what students want to see on campus. While being abroad, I recognized that although I participated in many IC/BCC events and occasional meetings, I never committed as much as
I wish I had. Especially from this semester abroad and encountering the position of being
seen as the 'other" in many ways, I feel more of a need and a great interest in participating in the IC/BCC and supporting more events that spark dialogue about particular issues
among individuals. With that said, I also understand that as all of our interests become
more and more focused as we progress here at Swarthmore and as time grows more limited, that not everyone is able to participate in regular meetings of all student groups they
still find to be respectable, important and interesting, so I will ensure that the student
events are representative of student groups on campus, both in and out of the IC/BCC
groups, and also try to consider all views when issues arise at Student Council meetings.
Despite studying abroad this semester, I have done my best to keep up with campus
issues through Facebook-ing friends, reading The Phoenix and Daily Gazette, and referring to the Student Council minutes. I support delving into recent changes in the college
such as employee benefits and student pay scale changes so that the college is accountable
for providing adequate explanations to students concerned about the well-being of
Swarthmore College, which includes both its student workers and employees. I also love
how students on campus wish to help make decisions along with the college and provide
fresh, new ideas. To support this cause, there needs to be a continuation of open communication.

Most of all, I truly believe that I would truly enjoy holding this position and working
hard with the rest of the StudentCouncil and at a greater scale, withother members of the
student body to serve the campus. I understand the topic ofStudent Council elections as
of late has grown to be a potentially intense issue. Please send any questions or comments
to jkim3 as I am willing to address all concerns or issues and give my opinion on any
issues.

Opinions
Remembering the Armenian Genocide, 94 years later

swarthmorephoenix.com

So the tagline for this
column is "Pragmatism
Not Idealism," but with my
final contribution for the
year I may stray from this
tidy dictum. Pragmatism
is useful when it means
engaging world leaders,
broadening the discourse
on policy and its implementation, or stoically assessing our changing status
and power in the world.
David Sterngold
But there is a darker
Pragmatism Not Idealism
side to pragmatism
when it degenerates into
the outright immorality of
Machiavelli, or the cold, inhuman calculations of realpolitik. These dangers are born when pragmatism itself
becomes an ideology. Before blithe adherence to this type
of pragmatism, truth itself is sacrificed. After all, sometimes the truth is annoyingly impractical.
This past Friday, April 24, marked the 94th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, a campaign in which
approximately L 5 million Armenians were murdered at
the hands of Ottoman Turks, just after the inception of the
First World War. The facts about the genocide are relatively straightforward, as is the international academic
consensus that it was indeed a systematic "cleansing" of
an unwanted ethnic group. But for an alarming number
of leaders in the United States, Israel and the rest of the
world, the Armenian Genocide is an issue where truth
takes a back seat to the self-interested and disingenuous
tidings of pragmatism. They argue that "genocide" is perhaps too strong a word seeing as Turkey (which objects
vociferously to the term) is a strategic, secular ally in the
Middle East. This is pragmatism, sure, but it's also fear.
With Turkey casting not-so-veiled threats on anyone daring to so much as mouth the word, lawmakers, administrators and lobbyists have been quick to take their side
(and their money) on fear of reprisal.
The story of the genocide begins during WWI. With
over a million Armenians living within the bounds of the
then-Ottoman Empire, the freshly empowered New Turk
government grew restless, and for good reason. The
harshly oppressed Armenian community (they were

Christians in a Muslim state) had already established a
strong autonomy movement, and had known ties to the
Russian Empire, with whom the Turks were at war.
Indeed, an entire regiment of Armenian volunteers sided
with the Russians. Government suspicion of Armenian
loyalty quickly crescendoed into outright violence.
On April 24, 1915, hundreds of the most prominent
Armenian leaders in Constantinople were arrested and
deported to supervised rural camps, where many perished. Though this day is used as the standard to commemorate the massacres, the bulk of the violence was yet
to come. Turkish military outfits, along with nationalist
gangs, spread from village to village throughout the
Armenian homeland province of Anatolia, initially seizing weapons and instigating anti-Armenian pogroms.
Once rendered defenseless and thoroughly terrified, the
Armenians were rounded up and expelled from their
homes, their property seized by governmental decree.
They were marched brutally and circuitously, some to
unprovisioned Ottoman refugee camps, others directly
out of the country via the Persian desert (modern day
Syria), dying by the hundreds of thousands alternately
of starvation, dehydration, fatigue or execution. Those
deported by boat were often tossed overboard into the
Black Sea. It was the most deadly forced march of the
modern world, a walking concentration camp which was
thoroughly condemned at the time by the Allied Powers,
the United States included. "Policy of Extermination"
reads the headline for a 1915 New York Times article about
the genocide. "More Atrocities Detailed In Support of
Charge That Turkey Is Acting Deliberately."
But uttering such an accusation in the hallowed chambers of the United States Congress, even 94 years after the
fact, is sure to spark controversy. In 2007, the seemingly
innocuous House Resolution 106, "Calling upon the
President to ensure that the foreign policy of the United
States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity
concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing and genocide documented in the United States record
relating to the Armenian Genocide, and for other purposes," sparked impassioned criticism from Turkey (where
acknowledging the Armenian Genocide is illegal), which
was spending $300,000 a month "on communications specialists and high-powered lobbyists" to prevent the passage of such a bill.
At issue in that case was the Bush Administration's

claim that damaging relations with Turkey meant hampering U.S. operations in Iraq
operations facilitated by
the use of important Turkish airbases. Turkey played a
proactive role in hinting at this type of retaliation; even if
the bill did pass, the Turks demanded a "goodwill gesture," from the Bush administration to make things right.
House members deciding on the initiative, allegedly 'agonizing over the decision," often chose to vote it down
despite fully recognizing that the historical facts of 1915
correspond with the modern definition of genocide. They
were swayed, it seems, in spite of truth, by threats tantamount to state-sponsored blackmail
and the bill, which
initially looked golden, was effectively shoved under the
table.
As a senator, Barack Obama was an outspoken supporter of this and similar initiatives, and consistently
stressed the importance of recognizing the "widely documented fact" of the Armenian Genocide.So it was a crushing blow to the American Armenian community whenthe
President's commemoration speech last week dodged any
use of the disputed word. This is the worst kind of pragmatism
the kind the American public knows all too
well capable of subordinating truth, reason and morality to the rules of a stale political game.
Why should the United States government take priority in recognizing a bygone historical event? Moreover,
why does this recognition need to be formally inscribed
by law? In one sense, the efficacy of using the word "genocide" is nothing.
In another sense, to the Armenian diaspora whose century was defined by the Genocide, the word is everything.
Above all, it entails a concrete, binding recognition of the
attempted destruction of an entire people
and an equally binding responsibility, on those who recognize this,
never to let it happen again.
Decades after WWI, the Armenian Genocide was recognized by Hitler as a precedent for the way in which his
brutality would meet the hindsight of history. "Who, after
all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"
he remarked, assuming that the atrocities of the past
would be pasted over, obscured,and forgotten in the
tumultuous sweep of history.
With our recognition and remembrance, we prove him
wrong.

exterminate the virus. There must be no

adapting to the human body.
I dare to speak for us all when I say I
would prefer 30-day delays in summer loving to death by pig flu. Until that vaccine is
developed, we face a race against the virus
to see who can hold out longer. When something like SARS recedes into the backs of
our mind as a mere footnote now, yet still

I think caution is the name of the game

Three is greater than one: Softball ends on high

A friend

"Division

Based on a
short film of the same name (available
on Hulu), this film will most likely not
be the epitome of cinematic excellence,
and I am pretty sure the best part about
it is going to be the tagline: "It's college
technically." However, it is
football
rare enough to see attention given to DIII athletes that I felt the need to watch
the short that gave rise to the feature

film.
The story (if it can actually be called
a story, since it lacks any sort of plot or
real character development) centers on
an interview with a supposed D-111 football player at a small liberal arts college.

One of my favorite moments came
from a part of the interview when the
football player is describing his coach
(played by Andy Dick): "A coach who
gets wins is like a tiger who gets the

ideas to take
away
from
this film, but
one that is
hard to miss
is the representation of
D-111 athletes as just as stupid as other
athletes are believed to be.
It could be a generalization that football players aren't the brightest bunch,
or perhaps that slapstick comedies rely
on portraying everyone as dim-witted,
but it is hard to deny that there is a
belief in our culture that jocks are stu~~

pid.

It can be seen in the dumb-jock character present in almost every high
school movie or television show and
even in the personas of professional
athletes perpetuated in ad campaigns
exemplified by the attitude of "they
might not be smart, but at least they are
real good at sports."
But applying these stereotypes to DIII athletes, as this short film does, misrepresents the complexities of D-111 programs and those who participate in
them.
The film touches on the two ways
people seem to view D-111 athletes.
Popular representations either dismiss
them as not-actual-college-athletes or
lump them into a category with D-I and
professional athletes.
However, neither of these encapsulates D-111 athletes. Yet, as much as we
might not want to admit it, these mis-

Swarthmore.
Even at a school like Swarthmore,
where the athletic program is not a
huge part of the school's reputation,
there seems to be a stereotype of athletes as not being as qualified or as
being somehow apart from the rest of
the student body.
I have been in numerous conversations in which after it is revealed that I
am on a varsity sports team here,
whomever I am speaking to acts like
some big piece of my personality has
been revealed or the way that they see
me has suddenly changed.
This response is different than when
you tell people that you work for one of
the college's publications or that you
play an instrument.
This prompts me to ask: when did
being good at a sport come to be considered as something more than just having another skill?
It's just like learning to play an
instrument to play a sport, there are
techniques to learn and time that needs
to be spent practicing.
Yet there is a perception that somehow playing sports takes away IQ
points, whereas learning an instrument
adds them.
I don't think athletes should be
viewed this way anywhere, especially
at D-111 schools like Swarthmore.
Athletes here and at other D-111 programs do not play because they have
scholarships paying their way through
school or because they are hoping to get

The seniors of the Swarthmore softball team (15-22, 5-11 CC) certainly
ended their collegiate softball careers
on a memorable note at last Sunday's
double header
against McDaniel
College (3-13 CC).

.

The victories vaulted the Garnet
from last place in the nine-team conference to sixth, pushing them past
Washington, Franklin & Marshall, and
the visiting Green Terror.

.

Despite
blistering
heat,
the
Swarthmore finished up the season
nicely with two victories, with scores
of 8-0 and 4-1, respectively.
Despite failing to earn a spot on the
conference playoff tournament after
receiving a bid in each of the last three
seasons, the results of the Garnet's last
few outings are a valuable consolation
for a shaky start to conference play
this year.
In Game L Swarthmore wasted no
time making a mark on the scoreboard,
scoring four runs in the first inning.
Over the course of the game, a wide
range of Garnet players contributed to
hits and runs, with Kira Kern 'll and
Kathryn Riley 'lO both securing two
runs apiece.
Co-captain Alexandra Zelaski 'O9
also pitched an outstanding game,
allowing only three hits and surpassing the 200-strikeout mark for her
career.
Seniors Kristin Caspar 'O9 and
Lauren Walker 'O9 also shined, picking
up a run each.
Co-captain Christine Sendelsky 'O9
also got the chance to see the field one
last time despite being sidelined earlier this season with a broken bone.
She symbolically took her position
at second base to cheers and applause
before being subbed out.
Last season, Sendelsky was named
to

Eastern College Athletic
Conference (ECAC) All-Star team, the
the

first Swarthmore softball player to
accomplish such a feat.

She was also named an AllConference player for the Centennial
Conference for the third time and was
selected to the All-Region team for the
second time.
In a memorable play on Saturday,
Riley made a spectacular hit to right
field, which would have cleared the
fence.
However, the McDaniel outfielder
dove over the fence for the catch,
knocking over the fence and some senior appreciation signs along the way.
In the second game, Riley took over
as pitcher, also posting a stellar performance.
'l2,
Cushing
Elizabeth
Zoe
Hendrickson 'll, Melissa Emmerson
'll, and Michele Perch 'lO all posted
runs for the Garnet. Perch also had
three hits.
"It was an incredible way to end the
season," co-captain Walker said.
Indeed, it was an impressive final
run. In addition -to the McDaniel
sweep on Sunday, the Garnet had
defeated Haverford (11-5 CC) in the
second contest of a doubleheader on
Saturday.

But the positive ending to the 2009
campaign is bittersweet. "I'm still sad
it's over," Walker continued. .
"Our seniors have been great leaders and have made a huge
during their four years here," said'
Kern. "They will really be missed next
year."

Between games, Caspar, Sendelsky,
Walker and Zelaski were honored in a
small ceremony attended by parents
and friends.
The underclassmen also included a
surprise in the form of an entertaining
and intricately choreographed dance
routine.
Swarthmore's final outing, a nonconference home game against King's
College scheduled for April 28 was

cancelled.
The Garnet will return Riley, Kern,
and 10 other athletes in 2010 to make
another run at a return ticket to the
Centennial Conference playoffs.

Tennis blanks F&M, has second seed in CC tourney
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore Men's Tennis secured the #2 seed in the
Centennial Conference tournament over the weekend
with a dominant performance at home against Franklin
&

Marshall.

The Garnet (10-6, 8-1 CC) easily handled the Diplomats
(8-6, 5-4 CC) on Senior Day, recording a 9-0 sweep in their
last regular season match.
Swarthmore did not anticipate such a lopsided victory, however. After all, the Diplomats' record places them
in the top half of the conference, and they entered the
match on a four-game winning streak. "[The sweep] was
a little unexpected," Zak Kelm 'l2 said. "We knew
Franklin & Marshall was a good team this year. We were
a little worried about the match."

With the victory, the Garnet extended its own winning streak to five games and made a strong case to move
up from the ninth spot in the Atlantic South regional
rankings.

The team's last defeat (and the Garnet's only conference loss) came at the hands of the Johns Hopkins Blue
Jays (13-3, 9-0 CC), who remained undefeated in the conference on Saturday and clinched the top seed in this
weekend's conference tournament.
The Blue Jays are ranked second in the region and
12th in the nation.
In Saturday's match against the Diplomats, the
Garnet honored their five seniors: Kevin Shaughnessy,
JJ England, Mark Greenburg, Dan Wulc and Suneal
Bedi. Shaughnessy teamed up with Kelm at No. 1 doubles
and won comfortably by a score of 8-5.
First-years Max Bressman and Eric Legunn also won
8-5 at No. 3 doubles. The No. 2 doubles pair of Stephen
Youngblood 'l2 and Mark Wee 'll produced a little more
excitement.
With the count knotted at eight games apiece, the doubles partners faced a tiebreaker for the point and ultimately pulled it out by a score of 7-2 to win the match.
After that slight bump in the road, the Garnet coasted
for the rest of the match. None of the six singles players

dropped a set.
The seniors, Shaughnessy, England and Greenburg, at
No. 2, 5 and 6 singles, respectively, each tallied a win in
their final regular season appearance. Youngblood, Kelm
and Wee picked up the other three singles points. It was
the fourth time this season that Swarthmore had swept a
conference opponent.

Doubles partners Stephen Youngblood (left) and Mark Wee came out on top of a high-stakes tiebreaker to complete
a 9-0 sweep of Franklin & Marshall on Saturday.
With the regular season over, the Garnet now has its
focus on the postseason. Swarthmore will face off against
No. 3 seed Haverford (12-4, 7-2 CC) in the first round of
the conference tournament, to be played at Swarthmore
tomorrow at 3 p.m.
In the regular season-match last week against the
Fords, Swarthmore prevailed 6-3, sweeping all three doubles points and took three of the six singles points.
Kelm emphasized two keys to success in this year's
tournament.
First, in the off week before the conference tournament this weekend, the team has spent most of its practice time on conditioning, mainly because the forecasts
predict warm weather. The emphasis on conditioning
should give the team an edge in the heat.

Additionally, the team will continue to rely on the
doubles teams for success. "I would right now say doubles [is our strength] because lately we've been doing
well compared to the beginning of the season," Kelm
said.
Kelm, who usually plays at No. 3 singles and at No. 1
doubles, elaborated on the importance of strong doubles
teams. "We play doubles first, so if we can get up 3-0 in
doubles, that's a huge mental advantage," he said. "It's so
tough [for our opponent] to come back from."
If the Garnet defeat Haverford on Friday, they will
play in the conference championship against the winner
of the other semifinal, in which fourth-seeded
Washington will take on defending champions Johns
Hopkins.

Flat third period thwarts lacrosse upset
BY ANDREW GREENBLATT
agreen3@swarthmore.edu

four conference victories in the past three
seasons combined, the Garnet significantly improved in the 2009 season.

In a heartbreaker last Saturday, the

Swarthmore men's lacrosse team fell to
Haverford in its final game of the season.

With the 9-7 loss, Haverford dashed
Swarthmore's playoff hopes and kept the
Garnet from making their first
Centennial Conference playoff appear-

ance.
Swarthmore jumped out to a 4-1 lead
on the strength of two goals by Stelios
Wilson 'O9 (his 16th and 17th tallies of the
season), but soon succumbed to a
Haverford team that finished undefeated
in the Centennial Conference, surrendering five straight goals in the third period.
After trading scores to end the period,
Swarthmore played the Fords even 2-2 in

the final quarter, but it wasn't enough.
Haverford came away with the victory.
Despite missing the conference playoffs, Swarthmore posted some impressive
numbers that signify unprecedented suc-

cess:

The total number of goals surrendered
this season by the Garnet, the lowest in
the Centennial Conference. Swarthmore's
miniscule 7.05 goals against average landed them in the top spot among Centennial

Conference teams.
"We had an up and down season
some high points, some low points," captain David DeSimone 'O9 said. He went on
to describe the season as "awesome, but at
the same time frustrating that we weren't
...

able to make the playoffs."

Despite their relative success and
defensive prowess (anchored by a 0.625

save percentage by Kevin Friedenberg 10,
the llth-highest nationally) this team still
feels like something was left incomplete.
"There was definitely an attitude difference this year. There was incredible
energy and passion not just to be in
games, but to win them," co-captain Ben
Young 'O9 said.

DeSimone describes that attitude as
different." It was an attitude
that had players coming in hours before
practice to lift and hone their skills, especially before the Haverford game that
Young considers more intense and meaningful than "a lot of the years that I've
"definitely

been here."
It's an attitude that has the Garnet
excited about their prospects for next season, an attitude that has Young "really
excited to come back and watch these
guys play."
"Our team's going to get better every
single year," he continued. "We have awesome guys and great leaders in the
younger classes, hopefully they'll continue the attitude we had this year."
We can be sure that the Garnet men
will be working hard towards making
their conference playoff hopes a reality in
2010.
