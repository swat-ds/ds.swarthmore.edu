Housing Shortage Strands 51
Westphal hopes all will have rooms by start offall semester
By Michael Tomko
Fifty-one students were without
housing after Monday night's room
draw for rising sophomores. The
room draw ended a tumultuous housing lottery in which some rising
sophomores manipulated the system
to obtain housing that in the past had
gone to rising juniors.
As a result of the abuses, the Housing Committee, Resident Assistants,
and Dean of Housing Myrt Westphal
had postponed sophomore room
draw, which was originally scheduled for Thursday, April 20. They
also implemented a policy that at-

tempted to correct the abuses.
The policy came in response to
widespread cheating that occurred
during the rising junior room draw.
Rising juniorspicked rooms for rising sophomores even though the rising juniors had no intention of living
there. By switching out of the rooms
later in the year, the upper-class students would obtain rooms for their
younger friends.
Westphal said something had to
be donebecause the abuses were "so
large and so blatant." While the exact
number of room switches was not
known, students gave back four
rooms this week in an amnesty that
was part of the housing committee
plan.
The amnesty plan permitted cheat-

ers to come forward and give up their
rooms. Upper-class students were not

punished and rising sophomores returned to the lottery. Four groups
came forward; two of those rooms
wentback into the rising sophomore
draw while two remain for a special
mini-lottery to be held Sunday.
Housing Committeemember Matthew Sosland '97 said, "We were
trying to restore the equity and seniority that was gone after people did
notact within the spirit of the system.
At the same time, we didn't want to
complicate things by holding another
lottery. That would just kill people."

Westphal said she had anticipated
more confessions .There were 30
rooms picked by mixed groups of
rising sophomores and rising juniors.
Many of those, however, might be
legitimate. "We have many multiage dorms and multi-class friendships," said Westphal.
Westphal was especially concerned
about bribes paid to at least two upper-class students to pick rooms. She
saidshe hopes students will not abuse
therules in future lotteries."The community has to police itself.... I think
that community is very important.
We need to speak to each other, not
new rules. My hope is in moral suasion. We also need to be clearer about
the spirit of the housing lottery."
The confusion over the housing
policy only served to increase the

tension at the rising sophomore's
room draw. Looking at the anxious
first year student in the field house,
John Todd '97, "I'm glad thatI'm an
RA and don't have to go through this.
I bet that there will be a lot of RA
applications from this class."
People scrambled around the gym
as room after room was picked. At
8:25 Willets and Woolman closed,
resulting in a few hugs and a few
books thrown down in anger. At 8:30,
only ninety minutes after the lottery
started, disappointed first-year students began to sign up for the housing waiting list. Number 722, the
hundredth number among the rising

sophomores, was the first number on
the waiting list.
Westphal hopes to have these studentshousedbefore August 1st. Eight
will get rooms in Sunday's minilottery. Others will find housing in
the"melt," the opening of rooms that
occurs when housed students decide
to leave because of foreign study,
semesters off, or academic problems.
Last year, there were 19 rising
sophomores without housing at the
end of the year. By the time this year
started, all were housed and there
were 30 empty spots on campus.
Rahul Sakhuja '9B,who didnot get
aroom, summed up his thoughts about
the housing draw: "It'sadog-eat-dog
world. There are no friends when it
comes to room choosing."

Columbia's A team on a 17-8 decision from the judges and audience in
the final round at Johns Hopkins
University Sunday. Potischman and
Mallory opposed the nationally topranked Columbia team's case that
Yad Vashem, theHolocaust museum
in Israel, should not display photographs ofnaked Jewish prisoners being led to gas chambers due to the
religious objections of some Orthodox Jews whose family members
were depicted in the photos.
After giving background information about the case, Arlo DevlinBrown, the first speaker from Columbia, turned to Potischman and
asked him whichside he thought was
counter-intuitive. Potischman answered, 'Take down the photos," not
realizing that the government team
had actually prepared to debate either side of the case and would argue
whichever side Swarthmore thought
harder. As the opposition, Mallory
and Potischman argued that the photos should be displayed for the sake

Wednesday, Devlin-Brown wrote,
"Despite losing to Swarthmore for

of last year's national tournament.
For the past three years, a defending national champion has lost in the
final round. "Neal and I joked
throughout Nats that we had a date

he was in it for "the

Potischman and Mallory compiled

a 4-2 record during preliminary
rounds of competition Friday and

Saturday. Typically, only teams with
a 5-1 record or better qualify for
quarterfinals, but fewer teams than
usual had such good records, so they
managed to advance.
In quarter-finals the duo beat
Princeton's then-undefeated A team,
and went on to beat Harvard's last
remaining team in semi-finals.
"Before the tournament I was worried that we wouldn't get a fair shake,"
said Potischman. After the final
round, one audience member remarked, "They [Swarthmore] debated
better, but no one repeats." He then
voted for the Columbia team.
Other Swarthmore teams at the

Parrish Evacuation
By Phoenix Staff

Parrish Hall was evacuated around
10:15 yesterday morning after an
anonymous telephone caller threatened death to innocent people and
damage to College property. Local
police andfire departmentsresponded
to the incident; the building was reopened at about 1:30 p.m.
President Al Bloom said the caller,
probably a man, phoned from offcampus and told a secretary in the
Admissions Office that "there will be
damage done to the building [Parrish]
and innocent life loss."
In response to the threat, Owen
Redgrave, Director of Public Safety,
called thelocal police force as well as
Maurice Eldridge, Assistant to the
President, and ordered the evacuation of the building.
Swarthmorepolicecalled inoneof
thePhiladelphia Police Department's
two specially trained bomb-sniffing
dogs to make sure there were no
explosives in the building.
Redgrave said public safety officers along with police and fire officials set offfire alarms to warn of the
threat, then went through the building telling everyone to leave.
Not all students were evacuated
from the building. At least one student told The Phoenix that she was
sleeping in her room through the entire incident.
Eldridge was alarmed that the studenthad hot been awakened, but said
the threat did not disturb him overall
because hehad handled many similar
incidents when he served as a high
schoolprincipal. But the "current climate means that you have to take
such calls seriously," he said.
Redgrave said the threat may have
been made by a "copy-cat" trying to

capitalize on public fear in the wake
of last week's bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, an
explosion that killed hundreds.
Making threatening phone calls
with intent to cause evacuation of a
public building is a first-degree misdemeanorand carries penalties ofup
to five years imprisonment and a
$lO,OOO fine, Redgrave said.
The evacuation interrupted classes
and administrative work, but some
activities went on despite the scare.
Campus tours continued to commence fromoutsideParrish. Students
from Ruach continued to read the
names ofHolocaust victims in honor
ofHolocaust Remembrance Day. One
student, remembering the fire that
broke out in Parrish at 1:30 a.m. on
February 10, said, "At least this time
we have clothes."

Rising Intro-Class Enrollments Hit Natural Sciences
Pre-med requirements and the quest for PDCs are increasing class sizes in chemistry, biology and physics
By Jon Francis

poses a problem, since classroom and lab space
is limited. "It feels pretty crowded," Merz
said.
In the chemistry department, 49% of the class
of '9B will take Chem 10 in their first two years
at Swarthmore, a figure Stephensonfinds "rather
startling." He said that number is 50% higher
than it was five years ago. The increase is
largely driven by high numbers of pre-med and
biology students, he speculated.
In addition to increasing Chem 10 enrollment, the chemistry department has experienced anincrease inmajors in the last two years.
Stephenson says it is too early to call it a trend,
but the high enrollments in Chem 10 this year
and next suggest a trend may have begun.
According to Stephenson, the number of
chemistry majors is very near to the maximum
the department can handle comfortably. On the
other hand, Stephenson said biology is under
"much more pres-

Enrollment in several introductory science
courses was significantly higher this year than
a few years ago. According to biology department chair Rachel Merz, Bio 2, Organismal
and Population Biology, was filled to capacity
and nearly required a lottery this spring. Tom
Stephenson, chair of the chemistry department, said General Chemistry, Chem 10, has
experienced increasing enrollments over the
last several years. Physics department chair
Peter Collings said there was a sudden jump in
enrollment this spring in Physics 7, Introductory Mechanics, which is the beginning of the
physics major track.
The greatest pressure is on the biology department where five courses for next fall are
over-enrolled and will be lotteried. For example, 72 students pre-enrolled for Marine
Biology next fall,
though there are only
25 spaces in the class.

Merz said therehas
been a steady increase
in the number of biology majors over the

Last year 48 biology majors graduated
from Swarthmore; 54
are expected to do so
this year, and 60 are
projected for next
year.
Bio 1 and 2 are popular as natural science
Primary Distribution Courses and also serve as
the introductory courses for biology majors.
Merz said the courses' role as PDCs has not
changed significantly, but the increasing number of majors has enlarged them.
"I hope we see a plateauing of numbers [in
biology]," Merz said. "All of us [faculty members] love biology so we can understand [the

Nearly all the seats in Kirby Lecture Hall were hill during a recent Biology 2 lecture. The class, like

Physics 8 enrollment

in the fall is

higher than normal enrollment of around 15 or
20.
Enrollment in Physics 3 and 4, the introductory classes for non-majors, has remained relatively constant. Collings saidthat the increasing
enrollment in the major track (Physics 7 and 8)
may indicate that the number of prospective
physics majors is rising, or that other departments have been more effective in promoting
the major track to students interested in experiencing a more rigorous exposure to physics.
In contrast to biology and chemistry, the
physics department is prepared to support a
significant number of additional students. "I
think we [faculty] wouldall welcome [anything
up to a 50% increase inmajors]," Collings said.
More than that would overload the present staff
of the department, and as in other departments,
extra hiring is not a likely option.

But there is a flip side, Merz said. If more
students take biology courses, professors will
be forced to choose lab activities which involve less student-faculty interaction.
Any extra hiring is also difficult, especially
for biology. Expanding the staff means some
courses, especially Bio 1 and 2, will be taught
by faculty with less specialization in certain
fields. Adding courses and lab sections also

Buchanan: Family is "Key to Society" Briefly
Former United States Treasurer says government policies have
By Eugene

Sonn

Describing it as a "war for the
hearts and souls of America" Angela
"Bay" Buchanan gave a speech on
culture wars and the religious right
Tuesday night to a mostly unreceptive audience.
Buchanan, formerTreasurer of the
UnitedStates underPresident Reagan
and now chief strategist for her
brotherPat's Presidential campaign,
railed against various federal government programs, claiming "what
we've done in the past has failed
miserably."
In the bulk of her talk, Buchanan
explained how conservative Americans grew to feel that current American culture was at odds with their
own values. Major changes in public
attitudes toward schooling, sex and
family formation have lead conservatives to feel lost in anew and strange
culture, she said. "As a single mom
I'mfighting every single thing which
used to reinforce the family unit" she
said, referring to values taught in
schools, in the community and on

television.

"The key to a society is the family," said Buchanan, "the nation is a
family, we have to have ties to each
other."
Buchanan gave several examples
of how the culture wars are impinging on conservative values. She said
the welfare system was started with
thebest of intentions, but "it became
a crutch; it took away a sense of
community. With the welfare system
you replace the community and family with government. You can give
them money, but not the hugs and
kisses and caring a child needs."
Asserting that "it's universally understood welfare has failed this nation," Buchanan suggested the federal government should get out of
welfare and let the state and local
governments fix the problem.

Finally, Buchanan directly addressed the rise of the religious right
in national politics. After tracing the
failed attempt by the Moral Majority
to organize on the national level, she
described how the Christian Coalition created a network of local activists by running for schoolboard positions. She said the Christian Coali-

SAC Takes Council
Control of
Worthstock
This Sunday, students will once
again pack Worth lawn for music,
food, and fun at the annual
Worthstock concert. This year, however, the festivities will be run by
SAC rather than WSRN, due to a
series of miscommunications and
budgetary problems which caused
tensions between the two groups.
For the last two years, SAC has
obtained funding for Worthstock and
WSRN has run it, booking bands,
organizing the barbeque, reserving
space, getting drinks, and making tshirts. However, this year SAC didn't
have the usual $2OOO to $2500 put
asidefor the event, and in fact thought
WSRN had its own Worthstock budget, SAC Co-Director Chris Ciunci
said.
WSRN tried to get funding early in
the year, but was given the "runaround," according to Graham Richmond, WSRN Co-Rock Director.
Ciunci assured WSRN that they
would find the money somehow, but
urged them to first go to theDeans for
funding. "I told him to go to the
President's fund and get some money
there, and if that was not enough to
come back to the SAC and we would
find the money necessary. I also believe that I guaranteed him that the
remaining $2OOO would be funded by
SAC," said Ciunci.
WSRN got $4OO from the Administration, and said that in early April,
they were told by SAC to go back to
studentbudgeting to get further funding for the event. "This was a ridiculous suggestion," said Richmond, "as

time was running out, and we felt that

it was not WSRN's responsibility to
use its funds for the event." When
SAC told WSRN three weeks ago
that it could only provide $l5OO,
WSRN dropped the joboforganizing
the event because it"could not put

together a high quality event with

such litde time remaining."
SAC contends that it had guaranteed WSRN $2OOO, and that it had
told Richmond two days before the
resignation of WSRN guaranteeing
the full amount. WSRN countered
that without actual funds in hand, it
could not sign contracts with bands.
SAC took up the job, and the bands

should move to one which matches
their view.
In a post-speech interview,
Buchanan described more fully her
brother's and her own political outlook. She explained how their antifree trade viewpoint—economic nationalism in her words—is crucial to
rebuilding communities by providing good jobs to uneducated Americans. She advocated bringing jobs to
depressedrural communities so they
can remain communities rather than
suggesting workers relocated to cities to find jobs.
"Huge government has caused the
community to disintegrate, by bringing life back with jobs, churches and
an environmentwhich is vibrant economically you'll see they can make a
difference," Buchanan said.
Similarly,Buchanan supports pulling United States troops out of nonhumanitarian foreign operations and
eliminating federal aid to allow the
government to focus on domestic issues. "We can't solve their [other
countries'] problems and we have an

obligation

tion gained popularity because
"people wantamoral nationbut don't
want someone to teach them morality." By running for local positions,
Christian Coalition members were
not seen as imposing their viewsfrom
above, she said.
Attributing much of the persecution of national religious conservative viewpoints to an all-encompassing "them" which she later explained
to mean the media and liberals,
Buchanan talked of "the politics of
intimidation.""They use terms which
no one wants to be called, like racist
and homophobe," she said. Since no
one wants to be called that, conservatives had stopped voicing their opinions on certain issues, she said.
While answering questions,
Buchanan supported cutting out the
Department of Education and eliminating any federal role in education
other than college loan programs.
She also spoke in favor of studentlead school prayers in communities
where
the
"prayer reflects
community's values." She said that

Last Sunday, the new Student
Council constitution, after going
through a week of student input, was
passed by a unanimous vote. The
constitution will not greatly change
the existing workings of Student
Council, but will rather codify existing policies, according to members.
In other business, the moratorium
on chartering student groups was
lifted. The moratorium was imposed
April 2nd after concerns were raised
about overloading the Student ActivitiesFunds by chartering too many
groups.The Council decided to study
the issue and to resume chartering
when a new policy was put in place.

On Sunday, SC lifted the moratorium withoutproducing anew policy.
Some members were upset that the
issue was notresolved. Student Council "really made a...mistake," said
member Seth Harvey '97. He said the
moratorium was lifted prematurely
"because some members were impatient andbecause some wanted to get
[a] specific charter [for Women in
the Right] passed."
The charter for Women in the
Right, which had been under consideration when the moratorium was
imposed, was granted. The group was
chartered as an "inclusionary" group,
meaning that they will be able to
"reserve membership to women who
have beliefs that are moderate to con-

servative," according to Harvey. This
clause caused controversy, as membership decisions will be subjective,

whereas other inclusionary groups

Students Try to Create Dialogue
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

CurtisTrimble '96 was only mildly
disappointed when just nine students
showed up Sunday night at an allcampus meeting he and Chris Marin
'96 had called to formulate a plan for
convincing the College to change
policies that some students dislike.
"I wasn't expecting many people
to show up," he said."Ouroveral goal
for the moment was to see if there
was any interest to make the administrationandßoardof Managers more
accountable to student interests."
The next day, students who had
attended the meeting began collecting signatures on a petition calling
for "better lines of communication

between students and staff and those
affiliates of the College that set
policy." At press time, 252 students
had signed the petition.
They also posted signs outside the

Admissions Office asking, among
other things, why students who live
on campus must subsribe to a 20meals-a-week dining plan, why some
rising sophomores did not get housing for next year, why credit at the

snackbar in Tarble is lower than the
cash cost of a meal in Sharpies, and
why laundry machines in some dorms
are frequently broken.
Responding to those concerns in
an interview, Associate Vice President for Facilities and Services Larry
Schall said he can explain some of
the policies to students and resolve
other problems they have, but only if
they contact him. "It's my experience that issues don't get resolved
unless the people who have the problem come to talk to the people who
fix the problem," he said.
For example, Schall hadn't known
that many laundry machines were
broken. "No one's ever told me they
were broken," he said. "I don'thave
laundry facilities in my house, so
I've used the machines in Willets for
a year. I've been in there [many]

times and never seen one broken.
That's not a hard one to fix—if I
knew where the machines were."
Trimble and Marin had not contacted Schall, but had discussed their
problems with President Al Bloom
duringBloom's office hour Monday.

Sharples Changes
Food, Lights, Rules
By JuliaKernochan

The Student Dining Services Committee, facilitated by Sharpies manager Susan Bell, said it is frustrated
that only 80 students completed a
survey it distributed to all students
earlier this semester.
The committee also noted recent
improvements at Sharpies. Brighter
lights have been installed in the
servery; the rest of the building will

follow soon. The falafel and sandwich bars now serve pita bread that
opens, and pasta is available at almost every meal.

Unpopular changes have occurred
as well. Students must now leave
their ID cards with a checker while
eating outside, because so many trays
were being left on the lawn. The
"take a faculty member to lunch"
program was cancelled when Budget
Committee funds ran short.

ings and services—everything from

maintenance to food service.
At an open Student Council meeting last night, Trimble said this miscommunication demonstrates what
he believes is the root of the specific
questions he and Marin raised: students do not know who to contact
when they want to change a policy or
propose a new idea.
"I think that the current administrative process is kind of foreboding
to students. For the most part, they
don'tknow who to turn to." He proposed compiling a list of responsibilit
of each administrator and College
committee, as well as guide to getting funding for events, and distributing both to students.
Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie re-

sponded, "A lot of the things you're
talking about are in the Guide to
Student Life, which we spend a lot of
time and money publishing. You all
have to read it.

"I think we 're a small enough community, or we're still in the Dark
Ages—l don'tknow which—but we
[the community] think a lot of it will
be by word of mouth."

to base her speech on the theme of
Plato's Allegory of the Cave.

Golubfrom among seven candidates
who spoke at the senior class speakoff on April 15. About 100 students
attended, according to Maggie Gold,
Co-President of the class.

chance to select our faculty speaker,"
Gold said. Students picked Associate

Ando Receives
Wallenberg Prize
Nami Ando '95 recently received
a Wallenberg Scholarship for 11
months' graduate study at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. Each year,
the Raoul Wallenberg Committee

gives the award to approximately 10
alumni or graduating seniors from
American colleges and universities
who demonstrate leadership potential. Recipients represent all national,
ethnic, racial and religious backgrounds and "show intiative in per-

petuating democratic ideals."
Wallenberg Scholars receive full
tuition at Hebrew University, plus
funding for group travel in Israel, an
intensive Hebrew language course,

As members of the Children's Literacy Project, we have not been able

To the Editor:

I would like to comment on Eugene Sonn's viewof tolerance in the

true, but tolerance goes further than
that: it means allowing for people to

Yet, I value having my views
judged. An ideal intellectual discussion consists of people of differing
opinions sharing the same goal of
discovering the truth. I seek judgment
of my views because I value having

I agree with Sonn that people's
"interfering at will" is not good. Yet,
this interference is not tolerance, but
intolerance. Tolerance is not only
agreeing to disagree, but allowing for
people to act on what is disagreed
upon—as long is it involves only
consentual relationships with others.
It is tolerant for non-Libertarians
to say, "Brian, thoughI disagree with
you, I respect your position that one' s

and that force should be banned in all

To be intolerant is to force someone to pursue one's values, to impose

On Making a Celebrated Culture: The Web and You
By Justin Hall
We worship popular culture. We
enjoy self-reflection—weren't we
crazy in the seventies, when we all
wore goofy clothes, and danced to
vapid music? Weren't the eighties
vain and greedy? What are thesenineties we're living in? How do we describe ourselves? What are we doing?
I grew up a voracious reader. As I
read, I burned to be a writer. I didn't
realize that to be a writer, I only had
to write. I sought the seal of approval
before I, myself, was willing to create. Somehow, I thought an agent and
a book publisher came first. A contract with Time magazine— sanction
from the big boys. I thought that
everyone who had anything to say
was published, simply because I'd
never been told otherwise. When I
was 19, I began publishing on the
Web. Because it was fun, because I
could, because I wanted to. I sought
after a job with the self-appointed
"voice of the Digital Revolution"
because I believed their hype. Today,
I am as much—if not more—of a
voice of the digital revolution than
they.

The technology doesn't just support that personal development, it
encourages it. HotWired's publishing a Web site with 45 people and
hundreds of thousands of dollars is
laughable, because they fail! Because,

with all that capital momentum, they
still don't reflect net.culture! They
wantto turn this technology Zeitgeist
into a marketable concept—to
commodity it. They want a $5 million investments and "content providers." Why anyone would sell their
souls into profit margin slavery is a
mystery to me. What more could you

want than your own Web page? Your
own Web page at www.hotwired.

com?
What matters more is the quality
of the art, and that is all up to you.
HotWired and Wired draw upon the
idea that there is a digital elite, who
talk to the folks at the magazine so
they can sell you $5 worth every
month.
Forget it. I'm telling you now that
the digital elite, if they are elite, have
their own Web pages. Howard
Rheingold, Jonathan Steuer, Joi Ito,

Nick Phillips. These are the people
we buy Wired to hear about—but
they'll tell you themselves, without
approval from Stolichnaya.
What is that exclusive quality of
digital elitism? The digital vanguard
are making art with new tools! They
have vision! What do you have when
you compose your e-mail? YourWeb
page? Your own graphics? You are a
digital artist. You are among the digital elite. Send your stuff to the magazine and await publication, sanction—and a $5O check!
Forget that. Publish yourself. Publish your friends. Digital culture is
meaningless when everyone's hanging around looking for the latest pop
culture trend before it hits, so they
can put their name on it, invest, and
cash in. Invest in yourself instead.
Tell your own stories, and worry about
the next trend when you're on the
toilet.
Good stories, good art—these
make Webpages. Not money, no t hot
systems, not big hired guns. People
are naturally funny. Give them a
chance to be so, and they will.
Go out into your neighborhood
and do a video documentary. Stage a
play on a streetcorner. Strike up a
conversation. Read a poem ona train.
Then, write about it on your Web
page.
Remember the first time you had
sex? How strange that was? Write
about it. Put it online.

Remember the first time you were
dumped? How bad that was? Write
about it. Put it online.
I'd sooner read that than Barry
Diller's five means of media ascension. Culture doesn't come from
Warner Brothers and Sony. Culture
is that woman friend of yours who
tells the most outrageous stories.
Culture doesn't cost big bucks and
hang in a gallery ofmodern art.
Culture is your friend who likes to
draw.
What is among the most popular
newsgroups? Alt.sex.stories—because people likereading stories about
other people's sex! So, tell your own.
You'll have readers, I guarantee!
People responding to your work is
the highest form of praise. You can
get that on the net for $2O a month—you don't need a donation from Silicon Graphics.
I've been looking into publishing
a book. Basically, the way it seems to
work out, I slave for a few months for
a couple thousand bucks advance,
and less than ten percent of the money

made by selling the book. Any book
I write is going to cost over $lO. The
book is prohibitively expensive, but
not for my benefit. It is to cover the
huge bureaucracy of the book company (probably owned by an even
larger bureaucracies).

All this hassle for a $25 hardcover
of the month at Waldenbooks. How
many of the next generation of poets

and artists is that going to reach? I
may still do the book deal, because I
need to pay my bills. But you can bet
thatbook is going to be available for
free over the Net. If I want to share
my work, I'm not going to rely on the
existing structure to help me get there.
I've already gotten so much farther
on my own—if I waited for the authorities to recognize my talent and
appreciate my voice, I would probably be forty and strung out on heroin
by the time they did.
So too with you. If you don'twrite
or create something, you should. It's
human. After a while, getting by isn't
enough. If you write or create something, please share. How will you be
paid? I'll send you a story in return.
This is culture, people—unbound,
unabridged, unedited, unpackaged,
unfiltered.This is a people culture—fresh, alive, hype-free and not selfconscious.
Beware of anything that tells you
whatit is: "rational geographic" "way
new journalism" "live, twitching
cyberstation to the planet." That is

marketing.
Things should just be. Critics can
talk about them. If you are talking
about what you are doing, you aren't
doing it. Let's not try to remember
what we do before we do anything.
And, let's not pay other people to tell
us what's the best we can do.
Do it and share. We'll make a
culture to be celebrated.

SAC Responds to Earthlust, Challenges of "Bullying"
To the Editor:
I would like to take the opportunity to respond to the article written by Josh Sperry on
behalf of Earthlust in the April 21st issue of
ThePhoenix.As a co-Director of SAC, I would
like to make it clear that SAC in no way, shape
or form "bullied" Earthlust.
The article starts off by saying that SAC
completely disregarded Earthlust's plans to
hold an Earth Day celebrationlast Friday. This
is absolutely false. Earthlust's first proposal to
SAC came three weeks ago, not in January as
they claim. Earthlust might have spoken individually with members of SAC concerning
theirplans for Earth Day, but they never brought
forth a proposal. In fact, every SAC member I
have spoken with does not remember ever
hearing from Earthlust until three weeks ago.
In the meantime, SAC went ahead with its
plans, which originated in November, to bring
Widespread Panic to campus. Also, I would
like to add that the first SAC ever heard of
Earthlust's proposed reggae concert was last
week in theirarticle. Never did Earthlust come
to SAC looking for funding for a concert. They
did request funding for an hour's worth offolk
singers, but to say SAC carelessly planned the
Spring Formal over Earthlust's event is absurd. Outside of thefew members of Earthlust,
most students are more interested in the Spring
Formal than the twenty-fifth celebration of
Earth Day. Earthlust had to cancel its events
because the group failed to plan effectively,
not because SAC "bullied" them.

Secondly, I am personally offended by
Sperry's statementsconcerning SAC's alleged
sudden reduction in "promised" funding to
Earthlust. That is simply not the case. Earthlust,
like any other group on campus who petitions
SAC for money, had their proposal reviewed
by SAC. And, like most other groups who come
before SAC, they saw their proposal receive
only partial funding. This is common practice
and Earthlust has no right to cry foul. I would

Logistical considerations made it impossible
for the stage to be constructed anywhere else.
Noise would have also been a problem. This
was all told to the Earthlust members by SAC
weeks in advance of their event. They easily
could have held their event on Mertz lawn on
Friday, but rather chose to be stubborn about
using Parrish beach instead of actually holding

because of Earth Day or any other event. SAC
is responsible to Student Council and to the
administration, not to a political group who
wants nothing more than to promote their own
political agenda. Earthlust or any other group
on this campus has no right to tell SAC when or
when not to hold its events. We don'ttell other
groups when to hold events and we expect and
deserve the same consideration.
If anyone has behaved poorly in this episode

itisEarthlust. SAC rightfully feels disrespected

The Social Affairs Committee is supposed to bring
entertainment to Swarthmore students. It is not our
responsibility nor our desire to raise the level of consciousness on this campus.
like to challenge Josh Sperry and Earthlust to
produce the names of the people who allegedly
promised them a certain amount of SAC funding. If they can not produce these names, I
expect a full apology by Earthlust to SAC
concerning this issue.
I would also like tomakeit clear thatEarthlust
was not forced to move off of Parrishbeach by
SAC, but rather advised to do so because if it
had not rained last Friday, the concert would
have been outdoors on Parrish beach (as plans
from November called for) and it took all day to
set up for the show. SAC was actually doing
Earthlust a favor. If Earthlust was considered

its event on Earth Day itself. SAC didnot cause
Earthlust to fail in celebrating Earth Day on
Friday, Earthlust's pig-headed attitude did.
Finally, I would like to answer Sperry's
charge that SAC is more interested inproviding
entertainment than inconsciousness-raising and
political action. Josh, you are 100% correct.
The Social Affairs Committee is supposed to
bring entertainment to Swarthmore students. It
is neither our responsibility nor our desire to
raise the level of consciousness on this campus.
There are plenty of other groups on this campus
determined to do just that. SAC has no obligation to refrain from planning our own events

by Earthlust who, despite receiving funds from

SAC, failed to acknowledge SAC

one of

if no one seems interested in Earth Day it is not
the fault of SAC, but Earthlust's own fault for
not promoting an agenda they are supposedly
so interested in. Attempting to cover up your
group's mistakes inplanning by placing blame
on SAC is childish and is no way to gain
support for your cause. SAC does not have the
responsibility of funding every group's proposal, but goes out of its way to try to do so. We
easily could have said, "No" to Earthlust, considering we had already spent $15,000 last
weekend, but we felt thatit was a worthy cause.
SAC considers the article written last week
to have been in bothpoor taste and judgmenton
the part of Josh Sperry and Earthlust. We hope
that in the future Earthlust will refrain from
resorting to such infantile behavior and will
work with SAC and not against it.

Play Me that Funky
Music, Vanilla Ice

Caruso Saves
Kiss of Death

By Krister Olsson

By David Rich
If it does nothing else, Kiss of Death, further convinces me that I want nothing to do with crime families
or the federal government. This new film, directed by
Bar bet Schroeder, shows how easy it is to get screwed
by everybody.
It's the story of Jimmy Kilmartin (David Caruso in
his first headlining role), a recovering alcoholic, a onetime prison inmate, and a new father. He gets drawn
back into the world of crime that he has foresworn, in
order to help his slimy cousin, Ronnie (Michael
Rapaport). Ronnie assures Jimmie that it's a slick deal,
but the police bust in and Jimmie gets arrested after a
cop, (Samuel L. Jackson) is shot.
Jimmie turns state's evidence after his wife is killed
in a car accident that Ronnie was, in a way, responsible
for. He serves three years and gets out to go undercover in the organization in order to get the leader, Little
Junior (Nicolas Cage). The movie follows Jimmy as he
gets in deeper and deeper until he is abandoned by the
feds and the state. He survives and gets the bad guys
with only the help of Jackson's character, with whom
he develops a strong friendship.

Kiss shows how easy it is to
get screwed by everybody.
; was really excited about this movie when I first
heard about it. I wanted to see David Caruso in something other than a supporing role and I was just durn
excited about a gangster movie with Nick Cage and
Samuel Jackson. I have to admit to being partially let
do*.i. The movie progressed, and I did find myself
identifying with Jimmy and the helplessness of his situation. As he got in deeper with Junior, he never knew
whether Junior knew he was working for the cops or
not. The writers of the movie did a good job setting up
scenes where that was especially ambiguous. He was
always living as if he could be killed any minute.
However, the ending of the film blows. (Something it
has in common with Highlander III.) It seemed as if the
director got bored and said, "Oh hell, let's just finish
this thing and go home." That is, the ending is really
abrupt; it doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie
and looks like it has just been tacked on.
However, the rest of the film is okay. There's a fantastic twist in the middle about one of the men involved
with Little Junior's car theft scheme. And it was a neat
trick to make Cage's character an asthmatic. Plus, the
performances are really quite good. Caruso proves he
can handle a leading role; at first, he seemed to be
falling into the mono-emotion type of acting he showed
on NYPD Blue, but he relaxes as the film goes on and
shows a wider range of emotions. Look for more from
him in the future; at only a million dollars per movie,
he's still a bargain.
Cage is so over the top as the asthmatic crimelord
that it is mesmerising. Jackson is excellent in a role that
doesn't get much development At all. Rapaport finally
gets to play somebody truly evil. He goes so far past the
nasty racist he played in Higher Learning to become
really hateworthy. Overall, the casting was really great;
all of the actors fit theroles they were given.
Kiss ofDeath is one of those movies that never delivers everything it seemed to promise in the trailers.
However, it never becomes truly horrible until the ending. Strictly a middle of the road kind of flick, a (3):
"He's torn between good and evil."

Classics is not an incredibly new release, but in light of the fact that the
new Twin album will be released on the 25th (domestically, no less), it is
one which merits review at the very least so that Aphexophiles can get
their hands on some material to tide them over. Classics is only available
on import from R&S records in Europe, but one can find it quite easily
at such stores as Repo Records in Bryn Mawr or through stores on the
internet. (Careful readers will note that I rallied against buying stuff over
the internet in an article written last semester-oh, the hipocrisy of it all).
Classics brings together many out-of-print works-such as "Digeridoo,"
the song which started a rash of copycat music employing samples of
the instrument-and works previously only available on 12 inch records
such as the Xylem Tube EP. Unfortunately, the collection only
includes works released under the Aphex Twin name, and not under
any ofRichard James' other aliases (Polygon Window, Powerpill, QChastic, GAK, Caustic Window, et al.), but thankfully Aphex Twin

Kim Crusey will get the chance to
play at Nationals individually, and
their is still hope that the #1 doubles
team of Kolasky and Nteta will be
invited. Crusey, Kolasky, Katz, and
the team of Gehlbach and Shankar
will play in the conference tournament this weekend, independent of
the title Swat has already secured.
Congratulations to the Conference

Alright, alright, I won'tkeep you
in suspense: the earthworms beat
Haverford lastweekend! Yes, finally.
Said co-captain Robin Mandel'97,
"We knew it would happen as soon as
they were forced to face us." This
took some time, however. The first
day of Sectionals was a grueling Saturday at Princeton, where the Swarm
encountered everything from dust
storms to heavy rain, but somehow
managed to come out 2-2, with victories against Laffeyette and Rutgers.
Once again, Dave "Big Country"
Lewis '97 had an outstandingperformance, often seen in the end zone,
snatching thedisc over an opponent's
head. Benßutter '97 also drew "oohs"
and "ahs" from the sidelines, withhis
infamous Huge D. Co-captain Matt
"Ugly" Robison made his presence
known on the defense as well, never
tiring in the face of the adversary.
The second day was as tense as it
was rewarding. First, theEarthworms
faced a tough Perm State team. Relying upon the sheer talent of sophomores like Ali Momeni, who accumulated nine points, five assists and
3 D-blocks throughout the day, the
Earthworms trailed 8-7 at half. However, Perm State came out strong in
the second half to beat Swarthmore
by the score of 15-11.
Not at all swayed by the loss, the
Swarming Earthworms went on to
play Haverford. At stake was fifth
place in the conference. In a game
that showed terrific spirit and a very
high level of intensity, the Earthworms came out on top 15-9. It was
the first time Swarthmore had beat
Haverford in anyone's memory.
This qualifies the 'worms for atrip
to Wilmington, NC for Regionals next
weekend.

This week, Swarthmore's women's lacrosse team broke even, overpowering Widener in a blowout last
Thursday, but suffering a loss to an
extremely talented squad from Johns
Hopkins on Saturday. In Thursday's
19-8 victory over Widener, the
Garnet's offensive unit was hot.
Kris ten Osborne '97 led the team in
scoring,netting an impressive 7 goals.
Co-captain Julie Noyes '95 tallied
four goals and one assist, while Lara
Ewens '96 contributedfouradditional
goals. Also scoring for Swarthmore
was Nancy Rosenbaum '96 with two
goals,Bess O'Neill '95 with one goal
and two assists, and Laura Starita '96
with one goal and one assist. The
Garnet were stong defensively as
well, led by the play of co-captain
Heather Maloney '95, Rosenbaum
and O'Neill.
InSaturday's 12-6 loss at Hopkins,
however, things did not go
Swarthmore's way in the first half.
Asst. coach Rose Smithnoted that"It
took us a while to adjust to the turf,"
and the Garnet endedthe first halfof
play trailing by a score of 8-2.Things

with the team matching Hopkins goal

"We were just down by a little bit too

wereOsborne with two goals and one
assist, Ewens with two goals, Noyes
with 1 goal, and Ch'uya Hornberger

Evil Buzzards Take Third
at Temple Tourney Over
Scranton and LaSalle
by

Justin McLean
and Jen Philpott

The Evil Buzzards finished the
seasonon a great note capturing third
place in theprestigious TempleTournament. They finished the semester
with a record of 5-1-1. This record
and their performance thispast weekend at Temple should secure a ranking among the top 5 in the Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union. It is a
huge credit to the coaching skills of
the senior captains, Mike Madden
'95 and Darin Friess '95, in addition
to. the leadership ability of Justin
McLean '95 that the team has managed such a successful season. There
have certainly been Swarthmore
teams in the past composed of more
individual talents, but it has been a
long time since we have seen a team
with such heart and dedication.
The tournament brought the best
teams in the region together (except
for Kutztown which backed out at
the last minute upon hearing that
Swarthmore would be playing)
Swarthmore faced the EPRU champion, the University of Delaware, in
the first round. Swarthmore and
Delaware exchanged the lead several times during the game and, with
one minute remaining, Swarthmore
led 12-6. The Buzzard trys were
scored by McLean on al5 meter run,
and Jason Dougal '96 who rumbled
in from 30 meters out. But because
of a knock-on and two penalties,
Delaware was able to score with no
timeremaining. A questionable conversion gave theBlue Hens the edge:
13-12. It was the only loss of the
season for the 'Zards.

Week in Rugby

In the second game, Swarthmore
dominated Scranton University, and
won 12-0. Unable to penetrate the
Buzzard line of defense, Scranton
became frustrated quickly. McLean
scored early in the first half giving
the 'Zards a 5-0 lead. With the first
try of his career, Dan Barrick '9B
added a secondhalf score, and Charles
Teplin '96 made the two point conversion to seal the victory. The domination of the forward pack and a
superior mauling offense throughout
the game drove Scranton into the
ground.

The last gamere-pitted theLaS alle
Jesuits, who had lost to Swat 17-10
the week before, against the 'Zards.
The LaSalle coach complained to the
head of the EPRU that poor officiating had determined that game's outcome— "With a good official,
Swarthmore would have had no
chance." Because of this gripe, the
headof theEPRU officiatedthematch
at Temple. Swarthmore jumped out
to a 7-0 lead on a 50 meter breakaway
run by McLeanwho made theLaSalle
fullback look as effective as the Garnet Patrol. A few minutes later
McLean broke though again and
dished to Madden who setup Dougal
for another try. Then, on the last play
in the half, a mis-direction penalty
play was called. Mike Maddenpassed
the ball to the loose forwards, who
dished to McLean who scored the
third try of the half. Halftime score:
21-0.
In the secondperiod, LaSalle took
advantage of strong wind (and a lot
of luck), and managed to score their
first try. But soon after, MarkPletcher
'96 took any hopes away from the

Men's Tennis Wins to Keep Hope Alive for Nationals
By Jeremy Shweder
Somehow, some way, the Garnet
men may still be able to sneak in the
back door and earn a berth at the
year-ending National Tournament.
Completing a 2-0 week with victories over Skidmore College and
HaverfordCollege, the Garnet are in
a position to earn one offour at-large
bids to the twelve-team tourney.
A weekago, the tennismen thought
that their devastating loss to SUNY
B ingh am ton would deny thema berth.
Hopes lingered, though, after Coach

MikeMullan was informedby a member of thenational committee on Monday that a win over rival Haverford
on Tuesday would give them a shot at
going to Kalamazoo, the site of this

year's tournament.

The Garnet entered Tuesday's
showdownat Haverfordknowing that
a win would leave the door open for
a berth and that a loss would mean
humiliationand the end of a season's
aspirations. No Garnet squad has lost
to Haverford since 1952, but this
year's Fords boasted one of their
strongest teams since that era. In their

first close match of the season,
Swarthmore prevailed 4-3 behind
some clutch doubles play and savvy
singles efforts.The match was not as
close as the score indicates.
Swarthmore won the lone doubles
point in a winner-take-all tie-breaker
at number one doubles.
that
Following
triumph,
Swarthmore had the momentum and
coasted to wins in three of the next
four matches, sealing the victory before Haverford finally won the final
two contests. Winning against
Haverford in singles were Chris
Ciunci '95, George Khalaf '96 and
BrandtLincoln '95. In doubles, Chris
Pearson '95 and Barry Mook '96

won the tie-breaker, while Ciunci
and Eddy Ernst '9B continued to
dominate their opponents at number
three doubles.
Last Saturday, the Garnetwarmed
up for Haverford by tattooing
Skidmore 5-2. The Garnet's strength
this year has been the depth of their
lineup, evidenced on Saturday as
number three through number six
singles all won their matches. The
tennismenfinish their regular season
this Tuesday at Princeton. If the Garnet donot make the NationalTournament Tuesday's match will be the
final one for the five seniors, Pearson,
Ciunci, Lincoln, Jeremy Shwederand
Hunter Gehlbach. Next year's Gar-

net squad will be hard pressed to
replace "The Fearsome Five".
"They've been a model of consistency and leadership for all of us,"
revealed JV star Roger Werner '9B.
"Each of those seniors has taught me
something about tennis or about life.
I only hope that I can do the same
when I'm a senior."
The Garnet must now play the
waiting game, as the national committee will not choose its twelve qualifying teams till early May.
"We've done the best that we can
do," explained Mook. "For now, we
just have to keep our fingers crossed
and hope that we haven't used up all
of our nine lives."

Prudente loves football so much that when
only 17 players showed up to the first day of
practice at Haverford one season, he became
disenchanted with the school. His high school
coach and mutual friends convinced him to
take a position at Swarthmore.

Fieldhouse for the last time next winter,

Prudente's sense of humor, wealth of knowledge, and assortment of stories will be missed.

Prudente serves as head baseball coach, intramural director, and instructor in the required
physical education program. In the past he has
coached in the football and basketball programs.

"It's going to break my heart because I love
what I'm doing. I'd hate to do half a job. I'm

been slowed by the loss of an anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee, the result of a very
athletic life. He's also scheduled to have hip

replacement surgery over the summer.
Prudente began his coaching career in 1951
at Haverford College where he stayed for 17
years before coming to Swarthmore in 1968.In
his 27 years at Swarthmore, hehas been known
for his dedication, hands-on approach, and willingness to make time for anyone.
His parents were immigrants from Italy, and
his mother lived until the age of 101 without
ever learning to speak English. As a child, he
loved all sports, but he could not play high
school baseball because in the spring he had to
spend his afternoons cutting grass for his father's
landscape business. It did not keep him from

playing. He and his friends would do anything
for a game.
"In those days, everyone would show up at
the playground or a field and we used to play
pick-up baseball. We'd have to walk ten miles
there and ten miles back, because it was just
after the war and hardly anyone had a car," he
says.

Football was perhaps his favorite sport. His
high school coach was an Ail-American at
Swarthmore and convinced Prudente to take
classes and play football at Friends Central, a
local prep school, after his one year of military
service in World War 11.
"If it weren't for football, I'd never have
gone to college,"he recounts, "I love the game."
After Friends Central, Prudente attended the
University of Pennsylvania where he earned a

a balanced school. If you have all musicians,
it's no good, and if you have all Einsteins, it's
no good," he says.
Prudente has no real plans for his time after
Swarthmore. He will stay in the area and join a
growing crowd of regulars at the spring baseball games. Although he will miss the games
and the competition, he's happy with his career. "I've coached and taught at two of the best
colleges in the country, Haverford and
Swarthmore. It could only have happened in
the United States," he says.
He will be honored in a hand-shaking ceremony Friday at 3:20 before the last home
baseball game of his coaching career. More
formal recognition will take place after the
alumni baseball game on June 3 and at the
homecoming football game against Muhlenberg
next fall.

Kristen Osborne '97 had an outstanding week
for the Swarthmore women's lacrosse team.
From her starting position at second home on
the attack line, this converted high school defenderled the team in overall points in the last
two games, scoring a remarkable seven goals in
the team's victory over Widener and netting
two goals and one assist in Saturday's loss to
Hopkins. Osborne also managed to lead the
team in ground balls as well, combining for a
total of 12 between the two games. Assistant
coach Rose Smith commented that,"Kristen
has really improved a lot this season. Although
she was originally a defensive player, she's
really coming into her own on offense."
"She's also an exceptional team leader in

This yearmarked the debut of the S warthmore
Water Polo Club. After a remarkably successful season, undefeated on the intercollegiate
level, this accomplishment can be directly attributedto the fiery Rich Choe '96. Playing the
pivotal but grueling "hole" position, Choe immediately asserted his dominance in games.
"Doggy (as he is known to his teammates) is a
natural at the hole position, but he contributes
tremendously with his leadership abilities and
drive to succeed as well," opines teammate
Skye Fulkerson'96.
"He's always the first one to practice and the
last one to leave; it's no secret why hehas such
"skillz," adds Alex Huk'96. A superior talent
in a very demanding sport, Rich is theplayer on
which Swat Polo is basing its future.
