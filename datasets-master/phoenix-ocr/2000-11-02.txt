Deans ban alcohol at Delta Upsilon frat Staff want respect,
BY IVAN BOOTHE

internal change in ES

In response to an incident last
week in which a Delta Upsilon member was rushed to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, DU will be held to
an alcohol ban until the end of next

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

In an often thankless job, this year so far has
been an uncertain and confusing one for many
Environmental Services (ES) employees. Some said
they feel a lack of direction in the department due to
recent changes in leadership and policies.
The department's director left the college at the
end of September and no one has been hired to
replace her yet. The four department supervisors are
currently assuming her responsibilities.
According to an ES worker in Dupont, this has led
to problems with uneven distribution of workloads.
She said she and others are often asked to do more
than one full job. She said she is also concerned that
individual supervisors have their own sets of rules.
"We're one department; we should have one set of
rules to go by," she said.
"We know what we have to do as workers, but as
far as the management goes, we don't know what
sort of twists we'll be in for," another ES worker in

semester.

"The rumors are correct," Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd
Goundie said Monday. "DU will not
have alcohol in the house or serve
alcohol at their functions for the remainder of the year."
According to Goundie, the alcohol
ban was accepted without protest by
DU leadership. At the end of next semester, Goundie will decide upon a
DU alcohol policy for the 2001-02 aca-

demic year.
The incident involved a first-year
DU pledge attending a fraternity
meeting last week. He and several DU
members decided to have a few

drinks after the meeting.
"Two brothers, when they saw
that he was fairly drunk, took him
back to his room," said Jay Schembs
'Ol, DU vice president. "It wasn't like
anyone had to drink," he stressed.

The two brothers and JeffLoesel
'Ol, the pledge's residential assistant,
decided to call an ambulance.
Due to confidentiality issues,
Loesel could not provide any details
about the incident. "I have my responsibility to him," he said.
Goundie was notified by Public
Safety when the ambulance was
called but did not go to the hospital

Following an alcohol poisoning at the Delta Upsilon fraternity house last week,
the cleans have banned alcohol from the frat for the rest of the academic year.

Committee may decide to cut some sports
BY BRENDAN KARCH
TheAthletic Review Committee (ARC), formed last year

by the Board of Managers to address concerns about
Swarthmore athletics, is still considering eliminating varsity teams from NCAA competition, according to commit-

tee members.

With a report due to the Board Dec. X pressure is mounting for the ARC to suggest a course of action. After ten
months of information gathering, the committee has just
one more meeting, scheduled for Nov. 14, before it files its
report. Thefate ofSwarthmore's athletic teams will almost
definitely not be decided until at least May, but the report
will nonetheless be "substantial," according to ARC Chair

and Provost Jennie Keith.
"The possibility that we would havefewer sports is still
very actively on the table," said Keith. Committee member and Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 agreed, stating
that eliminating teams is "a real possibility" and that "all
of them have been mentioned" for possible elimination.
The possible change in the number of varsity teams is
only one of three main facets of the committee's work. According to Keith, coaching resources and admissions policy
are also on the table.
The wide scope of the committee comes from dual concerns. On the one hand, the committee has heard fromathletes, coaches and outside experts about the changing nature of intercollegiate sports. Confronted with a more competitive environment and limited resources, many
Swarthmore teams have slowly sunk to the bottom of the
Centennial Conference standings in the last decade.
Citing national studies, Keith explained that if
Swarthmore is to stay in the Centennial Conference, which
it will, there must be serious rethinking in order to main-

tain viable sports competition. "The committee believes that
the current system is not sustainable," said Keith.
The other concern, tied in to the issue of resources, is that
the athletic program places a large burden on the Admissions
Office. Nearly 10 percent of the school's male freshman are
devoted to one sport football and with 22 varsity sports,
-

-

the percentage of student athletes is extremely high. With the
exception ofHaverford and Ursinus, Swarthmore boasts the

lowest student-to-team ratio in the Centennial Conference.
Under the slotting system, the Admissions Office is now explicitly expected to take athletic ability into account for a large
portion of admitted students. According to Keith, this translates into a "heavy weight being placed on athletics" in the
admissions process.
A less tangible concern, but one that the committee has

focused on, said Keith, is the role ofathletics in the mission of
the college. The committee has heard extensively from athletes and coaches and will soon incorporate non-athletes and
faculty into the discussion.
Keith plans to send out a student survey for both student
athletes and non-athletes. The committee hopes the survey
will provide more varied perspectives and open up discussion
about the issues the committee faces. Along with the survey,
the committee will hold focus groups with students. The committee will also make a presentation at the next faculty meeting, scheduled for Nov. 10.
Then, on Nov. 14, the committee will meet for the final time

before making a presentation to the Board. "There's a lot of
consensus about the problems," said Keith, but she suggested
that consensus on solutions is many months away. With time
running short, the committee's December report may not cover
as much ground as hoped for by some committee members.
"I honestly don't know how much progress we will have
made," said Gross.

Dupont said.
Policy changes have also been an issue in the
department. Early in September, a memorandum was
sent to the ES department describing a new way to
handle the accrual of vacation hours. The apparently
condescending tone of the memo offended several
ES workers. Towards the end, the memo read, "This
policy is not likely to change back to the old way so
get used to it and pay attention to your time."
The policy change was "to our advantage,"
according to ES worker Hamsa Wali. But, he added,
"It could have been expressed in a way that showed

more cordial[ity]."
An ES worker who wished to be identified as Blair
said the memo "didn't upset people as much as it got
people confused." For him, the change described in
the memo is a small example of a larger problem of
consistency in the policies set by the upper
management of ES. "The main issue in my
department is that a lot of things are not consistent.
If you are going to go by a rule, then go by that rule.
Stop switching it back and forth."

Call for respect
A vein of dissatisfaction among ES workers is not
unique to this year. Ongoing problems have been a
lack of communication between management and
employees in the department, combined with a lack
of trust.
The most prevalent concern, however, is the
general lack of understanding and respect
throughout the campus for the work ES does.
Wali explained that the work he and other ES
employees do is essential for the college to continue
to function and that this should not be forgotten.
One ES worker in Dupont asked for more respect
and consideration. "Each player has a part that is
equally important," she said. "Our place is not on the
bottom. I think because we wear uniforms people
sometimes feel they can walk all over us."
For the campus in general, Blair said, "I want
them to know we are human too. We have families;
we are trying to make a living. This is what we've
chosen to do. Respect what we do."
Positive Changes
Blair said he has seen a lot of changes in the
department during his 11 years there, and many of
them have been positive. ES workers now have a
stronger voice through committees formed during
that time, such as the Staff Advisory Council (SAC).

COMP

Music industry forces shutdown of 2 servers
BY GERRIT HALL

The Recording Industry Association of America's crusade
against online music trading hit
Swarthmore twice in the last
month.
The
RIAA
told
Swarthmore's Information Tech-

nology Services (ITS) that they
suspected two students of copyright violation. The legal skirmish has forced the ITS, the two

affected students and the campus
at large to evaluate the problem
of copyright infringement.
When ITS received the complaint from the RIAA, it warned
the offending students that they
had three days to either remove
the questionable material or to
claim that the usage of the material was "fair use," according to
Stephen Maurer, Associate Provost of Information Technology.
"We're committed to taking

these steps" to eliminate legal responsibility, said Maurer. As ITS
has now warned the students of
their rights, the college is no
longer liable, and the responsibility falls to the students.
This placed Andy Alderete 'O2,

one of the offending students, in
a sticky situation. He had used a
program called Hotline, which is
an advanced file-sharing application, to provide people who knew
the proper login password with

access to copyrighted music files.
Hotline recently listed Alderete's
server as among the most used

Napster is no more. And Metallica,
the band that filed a high-profile
copyright suit against the
company, had nothing to do with
it. In fact, Napster —the Internet-

a guest, which allowed it to read
the list of files but not to gain access to them.
"This site...offers approximately 500 sound files for other
users to download," wrote the
RIAA in a memo to the ITS.
Alderete considered claiming
fair use, maintaining that he did
not violate copyright law since he
did not distribute the music publicly and did not operate the
server for profit. In the end,
though, he eliminated the mate-

to swap music files for free

But the honeymoon is over.
In a cyberspace-shattering
announcement Tuesday, Napster
officials announced a partnership

rial.

"They gave me the option of
going in front of the copyright
committee...but I didn't have the
time so I took [the files] down,"

Alderete said.

According to Maurer, the
other offending student also removed the materials to avoid legal action.
With copyright violations getting so much attention, Maurer

thought it wise to inform the student body, so last week he sent out
a reserved-students e-mail to all
students informing them of the
school's policy on copyright infringement.

Andy Alderete shut down his Hotline file-sharing server last month
after a music industry lobbying group complained to the college,
claiming copyright infringement. He said others should be careful.
"It

will save Swarthmore Col-

inspect their sites and remove
materials which they see to be in
violation of copyrights," he wrote
in the e-mail. "We aren't required
to search for infringement," he
added in an interview.

at the moment, it is the best they can do,"

Student Budget Committee began investigating an allegation of receipt fraud in Student Affairs Committee-funded events this
week.
The charge was made in last week's edition ofThe Phoenix, in which an anonymous
source admitted to submitting false receipts
for a SAC-funded party. While the source
maintained that the funds were not used for
the purchase of alcohol, complaints raised
before the Dean's Advisory Council last fall

Barron plans to report to Student Council
on his findings by the end of this week.
As it stands now, the college's official
policy is organizations sponsoring events
must submit receipts for party-related purchases to be scrutinized by the SBC. This review process is the only safeguard in the system. The Dean's Advisory Council, however,
would like to see more done to prevent fraud.
In a report released this month, the council
suggested the solutions of opening direct accounts at stores for party purchases, submitting receipts for outside audits and compar-

purchases.

"Some action has to be taken," said Marvin
Barron 'O2, the Student Budget Committee
Treasurer, at the SBC meeting Sunday in response to the article. This action will take the
form of a close reexamination of all existing
receipts by Barron, who originally oversaw
the distribution of funds. The committee saw
no need for an external investigation.
This decision is partially due to SBC's opinion that the allegation of fraud presented is
very light. "The Phoenix refused to comment
on the veracity of [its] sources," Barron explained at the meeting.
The Phoenix's co-editors in chief told SBC,
in response to a request, that they could not
comment on whether the statements the
source made were truthful.
"The article faithfully represents statements made by anonymous sources. The Phoenix makes no further claims about the intentions or accuracy of the contents of the statements of the anonymous sources," the editors
said in an e-mail to SBC last Friday.

Napster plans to
make users pay

ing actual purchases to receipts.
One of the problems SBC found with the
DAC proposals is the difficulty of their implementation. The committee members argued
that direct accounts would be ineffectual at
curbing fraud, and the other two proposed
resolutions would require an institution of
party police. In theory, this group of people
could be effective. In practice, however, SBC
argued that it would fail since those implementing the policy would become very unpopular very fast, thus making it next to impossible to find the people for the job.
SBC discussed the DAC proposal last Sunday and concluded that the recommended
measures would be ineffectual if implemented.
The two sides have a long way to go before
a compromise can be reached, but they agree
in one respect: while more forbidding rules

may decrease the incidents of fraud, no measures can completely eliminate its possibility.

someone really wants to get around the system, they will," Goundie commented. "It really bothers me that we have to set up a stringent policy based on cheaters."

At least students will have time

State Senate approves bill
needed to build college hotel
Provision must pass House by Nov. 29 to make May 2001
referendum on alcohol possible for Swarthmore Borough
BY JUSTIN KANE
A bill that would allow a hotel located on college property to serve alcohol passed
the Pennsylvania State Senate 41-5 on Oct. 11 and is now in the State House Liquor
Control Committee.
The Swarthmore provision, as Harrisburg legislators have dubbed the passage in
Senate Bill 1531, wouldallow borough residents to vote on a local referendum to grant
liquor licenses to hotels on property owned by an accredited college or university.
The provision and the referendum which would follow it are of interest to
Swarthmore administrators, who have been pushing for a hotel on college-owned
land for years. Unless the provision and the referendum pass at the state and local
levels, respectively, the prospective developer of the hotel will not be interested.
Deliberation of the bill will continue when the House returns to session Nov.
13. The House will have until Nov. 29 to pass the legislation.
The House is now in a "sine die" period, which marks the end of the current
legislative session. If the House and the Senate do not concur and pass legislation
to the governor during the "sine die" period, the legislation will have to start anew
next legislative session, which begins in January.
According to Jim Mann, executive director of the House Liquor Control Committee, the borough could place a referendum on the May 2001 ballot if the bill
passes before Nov. 29. If, however, the bill fails to passes before the deadline, the
borough won't be able to hold the referendum until at least November 200 L
Mann, who handles all the bills that pass through the Liquor Control Committee, said the bill containing the Swarthmore provision is an important revision of
the state liquor code.
"The bill takes 11 different sections of the liquor code and collapses them into
two," Mann said. "This is a big deal, and we want to be deliberate and do it right
the first time."
The Swarthmore provision will likely not be an obstacle to the bill's passage,
Mann said.
"I haven't heard anything bad about the provision," Mann said. "There may be
some issues unrelated to the provision, but lots of people have high hopes for this
bill and are eager to see it pass."
If the bill passes the House, the decision to allow a hotel on college-owned land
to serve liquor will rest with borough residents.

Signs proposed to guide visitors around campus
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
A fireside chat Monday night allowed students to discuss the college's plan to introduce better signage to the
Swarthmore campus. Larry Schall, vice president offacilities and services, and Janet Semler, director of planning
and construction, presented the college's plans to construct
signs to aid visitors to the campus.
"During the course of the year, we get about 10,000 visitors, and for years those people have complained that we
need a way to show themhow to get around campus," Schall
said.
The first phase of the project, which Semler said would
probably be completed by the end of January, will involve
better road signs for drivers coming to the college.
It will also allowfor new signs marking the south, north
and main entrances to the college and new directory signs
that will include a campus map and a list of important offices in each of the buildings.
One of the primary purposes of this phase of the project
is to replace the often-varying names of parking lots with
signs that clearly identify the name of the lot and list nearby

college structures.

One of the clearest examples of this problem is the Ben
West parking lot, which is just as frequently referred to
around campus as the Bond parking lot.
According to Semler, the committee hopes that clearer
labeling of parking lots will aid visitors with directions to
campus.

If these signs are well-received, the committee plans to
introduce signs to each building that provide the name of
the building as well as a short architectural history.
A third phase may include the addition of signs marking certain important arboretum features around campus.
The committee, which began working with the Douglas
Group, a Washington, D.C.-based design firm, about a year
ago, has come up with a possible design for the signs.
According to Semler, the signs will most likely be verti-

cal rectangles with what she referred to as a "Parrish tophat" design a sign whose top is designed to mirror the silhouette of Parrish. The signs will most likely have a dark gray
background with a cream-colored trim and be supported by a
single post attached to the middle of the base or, in the case of
larger signs, a set of double posts supporting the base.
All signs will share the Swarthmore College emblem as a
way of unifying the project and campus.
One concern Semler said the committee had was the reaction of students to the signs, citing an incident from a few

years ago when the arboretum spent a $4,500 grant introducing new signs to campus and a majority of the signs

were vandalized or stolen.
She said the committee decided to spend the money on
expensive signs because it felt a high-quality aesthetic appeal was worth the price.
Brandon Silverman 'O2, Student Council College Planning Committee representative, said that he thought the
quality of the new signs would deter acts of theft. Each of
the seven new directory signs will cost about $l,OOO.

Voting on Tarble referendum continues

Jen Pao discusses revisions to the new constitution at Monday's SC meeting.

BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD
Student Councilreviewed its new
constitution at its meeting Monday,
announcing that co-chairs may soon
be elected by the student body rather
than by other council members.
The council is now nearing
completion of the process of revising
its constitution, which will likely be
put up for student referendum in
November.
The changes came after the council decided last year that the existing
constitution was too ambiguous
about council responsibilities and allowed for unnecessary positions that
overlapped the duties of other positions.
"We felt that there was imprecise
and vague language throughout the
constitution," said Jordan Brackett
'Ol, Student Council co-chair.

A significant change under the new
constitution is that the council co-chairs
are elected by the student body.
Under the old constitution, the cochairs were elected by existing council
members.
In the new constitution, council positions are also more clearly defined.
The constitution lays out the term
lengths for each office, when officers are
elected, on what other committees they
must sit, and what thejr general responsibilities are.
The nine different positions are designed not only to represent all the facets of campus, academic, administrative,
and financial affairs, but also to ensure
a competent, orderly and effective council, according to Brackett.
Because the process of editing and
double-checking the wording is a timeconsuming one, the constitution is not
yet in its final form.

SCCS circulates a petition outside of Sharpies to provide an alternative location for an activist
meeting space like the one detailed in a rival proposal.

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
The gameroom space in the basement of
Tarble will be transformed into either a media
lounge, an activist space or a late night convenience store following the results of the current student referendum. The campaign intensified yesterday, the first day of voting on the
measure, as the Swarthmore College Computer
Society, the group that proposed the media
lounge, set up a table outside of Sharpies with

a petition to allow activist groups to use the space
in the basement of Wharton. The intent behind
the petition is apparently to free up the
gameroom for the society's own use.
Voting continues today from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m. in Parrish, from 5 to 7 p.m. in Sharpies
and from 7 to 8 p.m. in Tarble; and from

Increasing number of students use WA program

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

WA Shira Kost-Grant, left, works on a paper in the writing center, pictured above. The revamped
WA program has experienced a jump in the number of students using it this semester.
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Chances are you've heard the word "WA" a lot on campus in recent years, whether as a noun ("I'm training to be
a WA"), a verb ("Can someone WA my religion paper?") or
an adjective ("This is just my WA copy").
According to its proponents, the Writing Associates
program at Swarthmore is mushrooming, and several
changes are in tow for this year. But some students doubt
the effectiveness of the WA program and wonder if such

changes will really address the issue of how useful WAs
are to students.
"We're expanding our resources," said Writing Intern
Matt Kutolowski '99, who credits English professor Betsy
Bolton, the new director of the program, with initiating
the changes. "There are major changes the WA program is
implementing this year."
Kutolowski has the new job of "overseeing the developments" which promise to make the program more accessible and helpful for students. This year has brought the
addition of an online writing lab and an extended writing
mentor program.
The WA program is designed primarily for use by students who bring their papers to the writing center of their
own accord. Other students are required to meet with assigned WAs for certain classes, especially for primary dis-

tribution courses.
Many students find that having their work checked by WAs
is effective. "It's been helpful for bio, especially, because I'd
never written a lab report before this year," said Heather
Sternshein 'O4. Adrienne Mackey 'O4 commented, "It takes
the pressure off writing the first draft."
Not all students, however, take advantage ofWAs on a regular basis or even at all. "I haven't seen a WA in two years,"
said Phil Hoefs 'O2. Nadav Tanners 'O2 agreed. "I use them for
PDCs. That's pretty much it," he said.
But the number of students dropping by Trotter 120 to have
their papers revised recently topped 90 in one week. Last
semester's high was only 30. "We've been trying to promote

awareness," said Kutolowski, "and it's working."
While the selection process for WAs is demanding, thirdsemester WA Dan Korobkin 'O2 conceded that sometimes their
skills can prove inadequate.
This year, Bolton revised the WA training program with
the intention to change that. "It's getting intense," said
Kutolowski of the new semester-long writing associates course
that Professor Bolton teaches. "There's a lot more quality
control."
The current mandatory WA training course varies in content from those in years past. When Korobkin learned to be a
WA last year, his professor taught the class about how to structure essays, identify grammatical errors and write for spe-

A tour of speakers attempting to
convey the universal problem ofpoverty will speak at Swarthmore next
Thursday.
The tour is part of an effort to raise
student awareness of the roots ofpoverty both at home and abroad. Organizations supporting the event in-

clude United States Students Against
Sweatshops, the Kensington Welfare
Rights Union, the Thai Krieng Durable Union, the Thai Assembly ofthe
Poor and E.R.I.C, a Jesuit organization in Honduras that attempts to
unite sweatshop workers there.
The tour defines its purpose as not
only to raise student awareness about
this universal problem but also to
help student groups in the United
States understand what groups
around the world are doing to fight
this problem and what they can do to
support international efforts.
The tour also hopes to demonstrate the solidarity of their cause

and pledge long-term commitment to

"The tour isn't just about sharing
individual stories; it's about showing
what the groups from whatever different places have in common," said Sarah

cific academic disciplines. Bolton has emphasized collaborative learning theory and WA-to-student dynamics, as well
as specific stages of revision.

With the new online writing lab, students can e-mail

their papers to WAs during the normal WA office hours,
Sunday through Thursday from seven to eleven p.m.

WAMs (Writing Associate Mentors), work one-on-one
with a specific student throughout a semester on his or
her writing skills. WAMs are "further trained in more specific ways that will enable them to offer more long-term
skills to students," says Kutolowski.
Students meet with WAMs once or twice a week and
complete additional handouts and exercises to facilitate
long-term improvement of their language abilities. Most
ofthe students participating in the WAM program are freshmen, and many are students for whom English is a second
language, but any student may use the program.
The final goal of this year's WA program is to increase
reference materials available to students who use the Writing Center. The Writing Center staff is looking to obtain
more literature about various elements of writing, especially in different disciplines.
Yet all of these changes won't solve one problem. "It
sometimes means that people don't take their first draft
seriously. Then the WA gets a really bad paper and can't
do her job," Mackey said.

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

A public review
For a decision that will irrevocably alter the face of
Swarthmore College, there has been surprisingly little
public discussion of the information turned up by the
Athletic Review Committee's investigation of the state
of Swarthmore athletics.
There's a simple reason for this seeming incongruity
it's hard to discuss an issue if nobody has the
informationneeded to discuss it. The review committee
has only recently released the results ofits preliminary
discussions (see pg. 3), and the information on which
theseresults are based still has not been released.
In the next week and a half, the committee has plans
to conduct a student survey and a number of student
"focus groups". These are solid steps toward creating a
public discussion about the fate of Swarthmore
athletics, but students need to ensure that the survey
and the focus groups allow information to flow in both
directions. The committee certainly needs more
student input, but students also need the committee to
open up and to provide information that will help them
come to informed opinions on the issues.
At this point in the public discussion, there's not
enough information out there for The Phoenix to offer
an opinion on the numerous issues being discussed by
the review committee. However, we can offer advice to
the similarly undecided: beware the spin.
What the changes are actually going to do to the
college and what they are being sold as are two very
different things. As The Phoenix reported last spring
("Finding the right balance," April 27,2000), advocates
on both sides of the issues fully realize this and are
prepared to wage "a carefully orchestrated political
campaign" to persuade the college community that
their proposals are best for the college.
No matter what decision the review committee
makes, people are going to be angry, and people are
going to feel hurt. Making as much information public
as possible will minimize the injuries in the coming
spin wars. With issues this important, a consensus that
reflects actual opinion is far more desirable than one
held together with tenuous political glue.

Honorable intentions
Swarthmore students may soon be asked whether
they favor an honor code for academic affairs. Jared
Solomon 'Ol, a former Student Council member, has
asked the council to consider creating an honor code

here. The council decided the issue was worth discussing but rightly felt that the issue is too important to be
decided without substantial student input.
Solomon feels that having an honor code would make
academic honesty more important, a concern oflate
with a relatively high number of plagiarism cases
decided before the College Judiciary Committee. There
should be more detailed discussion on campus of exactly
what policies an honor code would change and how that
would affect students' everyday academic lives.
Still, the current system seems to work reasonably
well, and so there may not be much reason to change it.
Some of the benefits that Solomon has mentioned
include self-scheduled exams similar to those at Bryn
Mawr and Haverford. But such an arrangement could
likely be created without an entire honor code.
If this is the case, the red tape that often accompanies such a code might not be desirable if the code only
puts into writing the current campus sentiment. In
any event, Solomon is right to propose a less "invasive"
system than the all-encompassing one at Haverford.
Because the proposal is new, there has been little
discussion of it, which makes taking a position unwise.
If the idea continues to fly, Student Council is right to
plan to decide the issue in a referendum. The provisions of the honor code would also, presumably, have
to be approved by the faculty and administration.
As the honor code proposal develops, students need
to be aware of the ramifications, both intended and
unintended, of the code. Any code will have a significant
effect on our prized academic life, and students should
be sure they don't get more than they bargained for.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Institutional fraud is wrong
Dear Editor:

This is strictly my personal opinion, but I could care less if
students drink as long as they don't hurt themselves or others.
Underage drinking, dancing naked on Parrish Beach at 2 a.m.,
making loud noises that vaguely simulate live music, cohabiting with iguanas, whatever: it allfalls into the category of "Things
I Don't Need to Know About and Don't Care About If I Do."
I know that we live in a town that has a sub-moronic stance
on alcohol in a state that has one of the stupidest public policy
stances towards drinking in a nation whose general policy on
the subject is rather useless. Ifstudents circumvent some ofthese
dumb legal restrictions on their responsible drinking—and keep
in mind that the possible consequences of that circumvention
are strictly their own responsibility
then all power to them.
I also recognize that because the town of Swarthmore is
ostensibly dry, the easiest and sanest ways to handle financing alcohol at student parties, namely, a fee paid at the door
or a cash bar, are not possible.
The alternative is not legitimating fraud. It is one thing to
quietly and strategically disobey laws that reasonable people
can judge to be unjust or just plain idiotic. In contrast, there
are actually good ethical reasons, not just legal ones, why the
documentation of financial affairs within institutions should
always be treated seriously and honestly. Yes, sometimes institutions need to break their own financialrules if those rules
are preventing intelligent spending decisions from happening. But a creative response to changing fiscal circumstances

LETTERS

is quite different from active deception or fraud.
If you elect to drink and you're underage, that's your
own individual decision of conscience. If you elect to buy
liquor for underage friends, that is also your own individual
decision and individual risk. If you submit fraudulent receipts for liquor expenses, you are asking the institution to
lie on your behalf, making it an involuntary party to your
individual decision. That's not conscience, it's gutlessness.
Forget liability concerns
though those aren't unimportant. I am really kind of astonished and disturbed at the
ease with which many students seem to countenance the
submission of fraudulent financial information in order to
get what they want. This strikes me as a truly crappy lesson for life, a sneering contempt for a form ofethical practice which really matters.
It is also one thing to believe that you have the right to
drink responsibly and another thing to believe you have the
right to drink for free. Swatties seem to be cheapskates. In
many colleges, here's what students do when they want to
throw a party and have booze available at it: they pass the hat
a couple of nights before and collect money from people. Yeah,
sometimes people freeload that way, but then at leastfreeloading is an individual sin rather than a collective right. Why not
toss ten bucks into a pot each week along with your friends
and neighbors in order to help finance booze at a party?

OPINIONS

LETTERS

Letter not based on facts
Dear Editor:

Morghan Holt's letter to the editor, "Lives of the Home-

less no weekend vacation" (Oct. 26), was neither based on
facts nor accurate in the assumptions it made about the
motives or actions of the people involved. I know this because I was one of those three people.
The letter claims that what we did in spending three days
on the streets of Philadelphia was "a worthless attempt to
understand the plight of the city's homeless." She is wrong
in her assumption that this is what we were actually trying
to do. She made no attempt to talk to us about our intentions, nor ask us our motivations. Actually, each of us had

his or her own principal personal reason for spending three
days in Philly, none of which were to understand the plight
of thehomeless. We neither expected to accomplish this, nor
do we claim to have done so.
Holt also claimed that our actions were mocking and
offensive to the homeless, yet presented in her letter several stereotypical images of the homeless which are themselves a mockery and misrepresentation of the homeless.
These images not only stereotype but also romanticize the

situation of the homeless.
The assumption that all Swattiesadhere to a certain standard ofidealistic lives is also a generalization is perhaps misrepresentative of the Swarthmore student body. Holt stated,
"These students probably without realizing it, made a complete mockery of the homeless folks they joined on the streets
for those two nights." Actually, we slept alone. We did not
have sleeping bags. We did not giggle. We did not do this for
entertainment. We were not expecting to understand the
plight of the homeless.
We realize that the issue is a serious and sensitive one.
Criticizing our actions by assuming we should be more
"socially sensitive," yet supporting those criticisms with
factual and specific flaws will not help us to correct our
"mistakes."
It is more degrading to the Swarthmore community to
have a letter to the editor printed in the Phoenix which is
based on nothing but hearsay and assumptions than to
have three "kids" go out on their own and make a personal attempt to gain a better perspective on life.

Missile defense designed for 'rogue states'
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Dann
Naseemullah's article, "Missile defense a poor choice in shrinking
world" (Oct. 26), regarding the American National Missile Defense (NMD)
Plan. Naseemullah's well-established
respect for our country notwithstanding, his arguments for abandoning
NMD on the basis of its supposed
technological unfeasibility and its
strategic ramifications are both unconvincing and ill-advised.
I disagree with the assertion that
NMD is doomed to technological failure. With all due respect to
Naseemullah's "Swarthmore engi-

neering sources," I must express
doubtin their third-hand opinions on
a system that they have never worked
on nor been privy too (unless there
happens to be a Wen Ho Lee loose

within BMDO, the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization).
It is true that the Pentagon's NMD
test record is less than perfect; of the
19 scheduled tests, only a few interceptor missiles have successfully
struck their targets. Alas, experimental setbacks do not warrant aborting
the project altogether
under that
flawed reasoning, smallpox would not
have been cured, the Wright brothers would never have left the ground,
and a certain Senator from Tennessee, sitting alone in his office, would

not have created the Internet. The timehonored practice oftrial-and-error is the
very foundation upon which science is

built.

It is expected that in time, the United
States will be able to perfect its missile
defense technology. The question is how

long? Owing to the current test record, I
concede that it would be prudent to delay deployment of the system until that
happens. And the greater effort that is
put forth now, the sooner that day will

come.
Naseemullah's second argument
stems from his fears of what NMD could
mean for the global strategic balance,
specifically citing Russian and Chinese
fears of American ability to launch "offensive nuclear attack without the fear
of retaliation."
Perhaps this stems from a misunderstanding as to what NMD is designed for.
The system is not intended nor will be
capable of countering a massive, all-out
nuclear assault. The radar upon which
NMD relies would quite simply be overwhelmedby the thousands ofmissiles we
could expect in a hypothetical Russian
attack. Russian and Chinese experts are
undoubtedly as aware of this fact as we
are and must realize that the system
gives the U.S. no overall strategic advantage (besides, as the article claims, the
technology won't work anyway, so
what's the big deal?).
Of greater concern is the principal

reason for building NMD
the increasing proliferation of one, two, a
half-dozen nuclear weapons among
"rogue states." Naseemullah belittles the threat posed by such nations as Iraq, Iran and North Korea,
citing their lack of missile technology.

The Japanese might take issue
with that, as North Korea test-fired
a ballistic missile over their nation
only last year. Furthermore, it is confirmed that North Korea is working
on a missile with the capability of
reaching the western United States.
The problem only gets worst as more
unstable nations (such as India and
Pakistan) join the "nuclear club" and
prove all too willing to trade the technology with the aforementioned

Council hard at work
Dear Editor:

From the time we were elected, Student Council mem-

bers have been hard at work to gain the trust, respect and
confidence of the students, faculty and administration. We
have worked to improve the lives of every student on campus and we want you to know what we have accomplished

and where we are heading.
We have dramatically improved our communication
with administrators, students and the outside world. Student Council currently serves as the liaison between the
student body and the Athletic Review and GlobalStudies
Committees. We have met with Borough Police ChiefBrian
Craig and will soon meet with Borough Mayor William S.
Cumby to discuss ways to improve town-gown relations.
Communication channels have been prospering between
the council and ADVICE (Advocating Diversity and a Variety of Ideologies in a College Environment). We have
also pioneered a Student-Board of Managers luncheon,
which allows students to directly interact with the Board.
Student Council is also working to improve the everyday lives of students. We spearheaded the initiative to
make Tarble Basement a student space, leading to this
week's referendum. We are in the process of having coin
machines installed in all dorms, and have already installed
three this semester. We have established a system of
school-funded medical transportation through Worth, have
recently approved of a measure to keep Tarble open for
late night food, and are working to have lockers installed
in Parrish for the convenience of students living off-camWe

rogues.
As the missile threat against this
country is most certainly real, it is
only prudent for the United States to

dent input on topics ranging from a new hotel on campus
to an academic honor code. We are also working to improve Collection so that the Swarthmore community will
come together and enjoy great speakers and performances.
Internally, Student Councilhas spent literally hundreds
of hours over the past three semesters rewriting our constitution. We are attempting to create a document that will

take appropriate counter-measures.
As part of his argument,
Naseemullah cited among his many
credible sources an old Hollywood

Perhaps he had a point there. Just

Now apply that, if you can, to an

Alternative fall break not just community service
Dear Editor:
Over October break, nine Swarthmore students participated in Empty the Shelters' Alternative Fall Break under
the guidance of theKensington Welfare Rights Union. In response to a letter in last week's Phoenix referring to another
group of students'efforts to understand homelessness ("Lives
of the homeless no weekend vacation," Oct. 26), as well as
reactions we have received on campus to our program, we
would like to clarify the purpose of ETS and discuss our
understanding of community service and activism.
The KWRU is a group of North Philadelphia residents
who have organized themselves to improve the condition
of the poor in Kensington, the poorest district in Pennsylvania, and worldwide. During our time in Kensington, we
Participated in workshops on the intricacies and problems
of welfare and globalization. We also met with a family
whose only solution to homelessness is to live illegally in
an abandoned house. In addition, we spoke with welfare
recipients themselves, as well as former students now work-

ing with the KWRU.

understood the Alternative Fall Break to be a
community service project, while in fact this was not our primary purpose. Community service is a natural response to
Some have

the many problems apparent in society. It satisfies one's desire to make a tangible, immediate difference in the world.
While community service has positively affected the lives
of many, it will never be as effective as broader institutional
changes. Soup kitchens are band-aid solutions; people will
be working in soup kitchens forever if there is no accompanying political action to end poverty. The best approach to
ending poverty is to employ both community service and

political activism, which is the philosophy espoused by
KWRU.

Others Swatties asked us if we felt our week in Philadelphia had really made a difference. One of our most important
realizations from the week was that our presence in fact
changed nothing in North Philadelphia. The only significant
change took place in our minds. We came to understand that

poverty is a complex, often misunderstood problem. The
week helped us begin to understand poverty and forced

us to question our role in its solution.
We observed a movement in North Philadelphia in
which poor people are uniting and organizing themselves
to meet their basic needs, educate each other and others
about poverty and make their voices heard in society and
government. Just as the women's movement was led primarily by women, it is important that this movement be
led by poor people, since they have the greatest understanding of what it means to be poor.
But it is also necessary that they receive the support of
others, including students. ETS is working to establish
its place in this movement. We plan to continue educating
each other and the Swarthmore community and also to
aid the KWRU in any way we can.

All monkeys useless
Look. This is getting ridiculous. You have got to stop
whining about the Love Monkey. Here, I'll make it easy.
Nobody has a crush on you. You were just a victim of a
big spam; one student got a Love Monkey e-mail and
decided to find out who sent the e-mail by sending out a
reserved-students list e-mail to the Love Monkey in return. I don'tknow very much about economics, but the
Love Monkey strikes me as the simplest pyramid

scheme ever.
And given our student body, perhaps the most virulent. Admit it: you're hooked. As a Swattie, you are naturally obsessive-compulsive about... well, everything.
You'd even degrade yourself to the point of writing a
letter to the editor asking the secret admirer to identify
him- or herself.
So get ready for an even more addictive drug that will
make you abandon the Love Monkey. Ready? It's the new
Hate Monkey. Oh yes, I'm serious. There's a Hate Monkey at Swarthmore. I know this because, not surprisingly,
I got one of the first Hate Monkey e-mails. The form is
exactly the same as Love Monkey, but instead of showing love, you secretly reveal your hate. So instead ofhaving a theoretically good end justify bad means in the form
of the Love Monkey, we now have a bad end that glorifies bad means in the form of the Hate Monkey.
I say that I "not surprisingly" got a Hate Monkey
because I've always known someone at Swarthmore is
out to get me. Last year, I was walking though the halls
of Parrish when I stopped by a billboard. Being a shallow, self-absorbed person, I looked over an article that
had a few photos of me. As I looked over the article, I
noticed a hole the size of a thumbtack right in the center of my forehead in the picture.
"Gee," I thought, "that's kind ofodd. Who would put
a thumbtack in the middle of a picture to hold up a paper?" Ready to accept this anomaly, I glanced over the
other photo of me. There was another hole in the center
of my forehead the size of a thumbtack.
"Gee," I thought, "that's pretty messed up. Somebody
must get pleasure out of some voodoo practice. I wonder who else got a thumbtack." So, with fiendish glee, I
perused the other pictures on the board.
Except none of the other photos were punctured.
Even the presidential candidates were left intact. That's
right, to someone at Swarthmore, I am a greater evil
than Al Gore and George W. Bush combined.
"I've got to transfer immediately," I thought. So after freaking out, I thought of everyone in the past week
that I had criticized, offended, joked about or outraged
with the endearing sassiness that you've come to know
and love.
But after hitting number seventeen, I realized hadn't
even finished thinking of professors and administrators.
And as I prepared to send out a massive apology to everyone and repent my forthright ways, I had an epiphany.
Repentance is bad. Yep, that's right, repentance does
more harm than good. Repentance means you grin and
bear it while you bottle up your feelings so that they come
out in cowardly ways. Repentance means not pointing
out that the reason we had to cut 20 per cent of our activities funding was in part because of idiotic spending on
things like pinball machines that satiate the desire of a
few powerful Swatties. Repentance means that we ignore
the fact that it doesn't matter how diverse the student
body is if we don't attract and grant tenure to more minority professors. By the way, Swarthmore, whatever
happened to THAT committee report? A "yeah, us!"
alumni magazine article on the hiring of a black professor in the 1970s (who only got her rightful tenure by winning a lawsuit against the college) doesn't absolve of us
of this urgent imperative of today.
If you use the Love Monkey or the Hate Monkey, if
you pretend to be the friend of someone that you can't
stand, if you avoid the truth that must be said, then you
are too repentant. The next time you want to say something, don't send a secret e-mail or stick a thumbtack in
theirforehead in the hopes that they will see it (not everyone is as narcissistic as I). Tell them to their face.
Who knows? Insteadof starting a pyramid scheme, you
might just get a date.

Staff wages deserve scrutiny
BY SAM BLAIR, JACOB HODES AND VANI NATARAJAN
Swarthmore College is no sweatshop. Health care and
other employee benefits are generally good here, and staff
members have told us that the work environment is relatively good as well.
But over the past months, we've come to find that not all
staff are paid well at Swarthmore. The college's pay scale
reveals something that is a serious problem, something that
continues to startle us at a school with a statedcommitment
to social justice: not all Swarthmore employees are paid a
wage that meets their basic needs.
The math we're doing is simple, and we encourage students, faculty, staffand administrators to examine the nonsalaried staff pay scale (which is public information, available on the college's Web site) and to start looking critically
at these numbers as well.
Hiring wages for the lowest pay grade of non-exempt,
hourly work at Swarthmore start at $5.36 an hour. The next
two pay grades both begin under $7.00 an hour, and the following four all start under $lO.OO an hour. If these figures
seem low, it's because they are.
Consider that $5.36 an hour means a yearly income of
SIUSO, and that $7.00 an hour translates to $14,560 yearly. It's
our guess that few students hope or plan to live on $ll,OOO or
$14,000 or $15,000 a year after graduation. We certainly don't,
and for good reason: in many cases, it simply isn't possible
to live on these wages.
The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Pennsylvania, developed by the Women's Association for Women's Alternatives
(based here in Swarthmore), calculates that a single person
living in Delaware County needs to make a minimum hourly
wage of $7.33 in order to meet basic needs such as housing,
food, child care and other expenses. This standard reflects
the actual cost of living for this area, and unlike the federal

poverty guidelines, is adjusted for local variations in living expenses, various familyconfigurations andfor the ages
as well as the number of children in a family. According to
the standard, two adults need to each earn $9.92 an hour to
adequately support themselves and two children. A single
parent with one preschool-aged child needs a minimum
wage of $1315 to survive.
We stress that these self-sufficiency standards include

no luxuries and allow for no accumulationof savings. They
reflect only what is needed for basic subsistence. But not
all ofSwarthmore's staff wages meet even these basic selfsufficiency requirements. Assuming a family of four with
two working parents, Swarthmore's lowest six pay grades
set hiring minimums which don't meet self-sufficiency standards. And even at "full market rate," which employees
can expect to earn after five years of service, the lowest
four pay grades still don't meet the standard. Halfof Dining Services employees fall into this category.
Earning below a self-sufficiency wage means staff members have to struggle to make ends meet, and many must
work second jobs to do so. It means staff have to make
choices between good dental care and good child care, and
a thousand other choices no one ever wants to make. And
it means that achieving long-term financial security is vir-

tually impossible.
We think the people who serve our food in Sharpies and
scrub the stalls in our bathrooms
the people who take
care of our basic needs on a daily basis deserve to have
their basic needs met as well. As Swarthmore begins to
revise a 20-year-old compensation system, we hope this revision takes seriously the college's responsibility to treat
all members of our community with respect.
No Swarthmore employees should be paid wages that
put them in poverty. No one should have to live paycheck
by paycheck. A Swarthmore wage should be a living wage.

A faithful free thinker protests
BY DAN MARRIN
Walking up to Tarble one morning, I
noticed a sidewalk ad for Freethinker
Radio that read, "Are you an atheist, agnostic, skeptic, or freethinker?" As a
Christian, I've had plenty of doubts and
differences, but I wouldn't call myself a

skeptic.
Suddenly it hit me that according to
this ad, as a believer in one God, I was
supposedly no longer independent in my
thoughts and actions. To truly believe in
a God, specifically associated with Christianity, meant that religion must have

brainwashed me and removed my capacity for independent thought.
I am not an atheist. I believe there is
something out there beyond us. Though
I accept Judaism, Hinduism, Zen Buddhism and Islam as valid religions, I am
a Christian, not an agnostic. Though

faith and methods of pastors to gain converts, even some of the 12 apostles
doubted the work of Christ and managed
to maintain their faith
their doubt
added to their integrity.
Disqualified from the first three categories listed in the ad, it sounds like one
can't be both a free thinker and a believer
in a religious creed. To believe, the Christians must have had to shut down a part
of their brain, as conceived in that Marxist credo, "Religion is the opiate of the
masses," or one of those coffee mugs on
world religions for which under Christianity the advice reads: "Don't think:
have faith."
When I began singing for the Christian a cappella group Psalters in my second semester at Swarthmore, I had the
fear that I had joined something I wasn't
ready for. I know the word"fanatic" went
off with alarm bells in my head the first
time I visited an Evangelical church.

MATT RUBIN

FIRST
NTACT LENS

Being one of the few George W. Bush supporters at
Swarthmore, I fully realize that when this god of a man, this
savior of theUnited States, triumphs over that dirty, lying crook
Al Gore, there will be few opportunities on campus for celebration. There will be no wild parties, unless by wild parties you
mean the College Republicans, all four of them, sitting around
listening to Dave Thomas. So I thought I would share with all
those closet Republicans on campus (I know you're out there)
ten ways in which I will be both celebrating our coronation and
dealing with its impacts on the Swarthmore campus.
10. Hide from any member of the Feminist Majority for fear
that he/she might implode and spill a bleeding heart all over me.
9. Lock myself in my room and hide from everyone on campus, come to think of it, for the same reason as 10.
8. Remind everyone in SQU and everywhere else on campus

I know the first time I saw people
shaking and crying as theyprayed to
God I was frightened and thought
them to be losing themselves. I know
that when I saw them raising their
hands and shouting out "Yes, Jesus!"
at church, as opposed to the more solemn Catholic mood I grew up with, I
had to leave the church with a suffocating feeling inside, no longer able
to be reserved in my worship but instead encouraged to give it all up. I
thought the more committed should

have been committed.

However, something inside has
changed over these years. Despite
dating and falling hard for two atheists, I have become more and more
hungry for God. Now nearing the end
of my college years, I found the radio
ad offensive. I hold onto my religion
as a rock to fall on in doubt, and not

as a shield from the truth.

Here are 10 things I'll do
when W. wins the election
that Al Gore, too, is opposed to gay marriage. He would have
won my vote on this issue alone if only he weren't such a

hypocrite.
7. Admit that George is certainly not the most qualified
man for the job and start making Cheney 2004 signs.
6. Pray that Dick Cheney is still alive in 2004.
5. Thank God that our next president will never say he
was uninformed of campaign finance laws because he often
drank iced tea at informational meetings and so most likely
was in the bathroom when they were explained.
4. Thank Ralph Nader, and encourage him to run in 2004.
3. Thank George Sr. for making this all possible.
2. Buy stock in every oil company in America, particularly Halliburton.
1 Buy stock in Air Canada, laugh in Alec Baldwin's
face, and sit back with my profits to enjoy the newfound
paradise he's missing out on.

As Nov. 7 rapidly approaches, many

possible effects on the Supreme Court.

The Nader campaign
is right to demand reform P|*
in the political system, for it
is much needed and long overdue. To this end, they have proposed publicly financed campaigns, free television airtime for
candidates, same-day voter registra
tion, proportional representation an
opening the presidential debates.
Notwithstanding his bold refor
ideas, Nader's suggestion that a Gore-

Lieberman administration and a BushCheney administration would yield the
same or similarpolicy outcomes is patently
false. There are sharp and important contrasts between the two major candidates'
visions for the role of government in education, the environment, social security,
taxes, health care, racial justice and campaign finance reform. Voters know that
these and other distinctions are certain to
impact their lives and American governance in vastly different ways.

I certainly commend Nader and his supporters for their long-term commitment to

THE FOREIGN ELECTION 2000
NON-VOTE
HOW THE 2000 ELECTIONS

IMPACT SWARTHMORE
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
AND THEIR HOME COUNTRIES
For Kwabena Adu 'Ol, a citizen of Ghana, America is

not just electing the next president of a nation next
week. It is electing "the president of the world."
Approximately seven percent of the student
population is made up of international students, most of
whom cannot vote in the upcoming election.
"People piss me off who say they are not going to
vote, when I can't vote and wish I could because [the
United States] is electing the president of the world,"

Adu said.
Since the American has a substantial impact on
policy throughout much of the world, Adu feels that the
outcome of the upcoming election could have farreaching implications for Africa.
"I strongly support Al Gore because I feel that he will
be the best president for African interests," Adu said.
Adu said he has followed the campaign very closely,
both because of a personal interest in politics and
because of the election's international ramifications.
Compared to the relatively dismal participation in
American elections, Adu said that the past two
elections in Ghana had voter turnouts of around 70
percent. "People there are far more into the elections
than they are here," he said. According to Adu, the
reason lies in the fact that democracy is so new in
Ghana. The country became a democratic republic once
again in 1992 after a 12-year military dictatorship.
Like Adu, Polina Kehayova 'Ol, a citizen of Bulgaria,
feels that American students do not seem politically
involved compared to those in her native country. When
she left Bulgaria to come to Swarthmore in 1997,
Bulgaria was facing "its biggest crisis ever," Kehayova
said. Living conditions were bad and inflation had
skyrocketed. Students went to daily political
demonstrations after class.
But since most people here have their immediate
needs met, people tend to be less involved, Kehayova
said. "People here are not passionate about it; back
home people were passionate. At 15 degrees below
people would walk three hours each day for a
demonstration."
Kehayova has been following the election "semiclosely" but doesn't feel that the "candidates are saying
much new." The candidates seem focused on reaching
American voters and have not substantially addressed
issues that would affect her native country, according to
Kehayova.

Jon Winskill 'O2, who is a British citizen but has lived
in the United States since he was three, said he has not
been following the campaign and feels somewhat
detached from the process. "I think if I were a citizen, I
would feel a responsibility to seek out information," he
said. Winskill said he does plan to vote when he
becomes a United States citizen.
Michael Seifert 'Ol, who has dual American and
Canadian citizenship but lived in Canada before coming
to Swarthmore, said, "I feel like it affects me less
because I consider myself Canadian."
Seifert said that he did not register to vote in
America because he does not feel attached to a
particular state and does not know the local issues well
enough. But Seifert, who said he has been following the
election fairly closely, prefers that Gore win because of
his knowledge of foreign policy issues that could affect
Canada.

PRESIDErfIKftIMII
Like

most Swarthmore students, Lindsay Goldsmith'Ol
falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum when
it comes to involvement in the upcoming presidential
election.
Social issues are most important in determining her vote,
and shehas clear views on those shefeels most strongly about.
"We need to reform public schools and make them a realistic
option for education," she said.
While saying she has done a "minimal amount" of reading about the campaign and watched the debates, she admits
that this involvement has not been enough. Since she is not

enthusiastic about either candidate, Goldsmith said she has
been "somewhat lazy" about following the elections.
"I wouldn'tlet myself make an uninformed decision," she
said. "But I don't go out of my way to understand the technicalities of the issues."
Nevertheless, like most of the students interviewed, Goldsmith is adamant about the importance of voting. "I think
that expressing your vote is part of living in a democracy,"
she says. "Even if people have no other resource, [the vote] is
one resource they do have and it can make a difference."

Nationally,

fewer young adults are going to the polls
than ever before. In a poll conducted by Medill News
Service, 85 percent of respondents ages 18 to 24 said
they would definitely or probably vote, and 71 percent were registered to vote. But only 32 percent of 18 to 24year-olds cast theirballot in 1996 a decline of20 percentage
points since 1972, when those under 21 were first given the
right to vote following the Vietnam War.
According to interviews and a non-scientific survey conducted Monday night in Sharpies, most Swarthmore students
do plan to vote and feel that exercising this right is impor-

tant. But the majority of students have not been following tl
campaign closely and are not highly involved politically.

(

All but one of the American students interviewed is a reg ■
tered voter and plans to vote or has already done so. In the Ph(
nix poll, which surveyed 163 students, or about 12 percent of tl i
student body, 79 percent of respondents said they are register
to vote and plan to do so. Fifteen percent are neither register* 1 1
nor plan to vote.
Of those who plan to vote, all have well-developed views ( i
issues important to them in the election, though no single issi e
emerged as being critical for a majority of students.
For C.J. Riley 'Ol, abortion is one of the most important i isues in determining his vote. "A lot of friends have impress*
on me a women's right to choose, and I've always felt real y
strongly about that... there's a huge possibility of Bush puttii g.
judges into the Supreme Court thatcould overturn Roe vs. Wad;,
and that would affect half the population."
a
Jeff Loesel 'Ol said that social security is one of the most s ilientissues for him, in part because the way government handli s
this issue is indicative of its role in people's lives. "Bush seems
more active because he wants to reform it, rather than
more money at it," Loesel said.
Chris Murphy 'O4 is voting for Bush because he wants to sfte
a smaller, less active government.
J
Student interviews reflect the results of The Phoenix p<«C
which shows that no single issue was mentioned by a majority
of respondents as determining their vote. Nevertheless, social
issues including education, abortion, civil rights and the environment
were each mentioned by about ten percent of respon-'
dents.

lthough Swarthmore students seem to have strong opin
ions on the issues and to feel that participation in de
mocracy is important, for the most part this attitude
does not seem to lead to substantial involvement in the
campaign.

a

Most students interviewed said they do not actively seek
out informationabout the candidates, but pay at least some
attention to the campaign news they happen to come across.
"I get [campaign news] on the way to the sports page, or
when I walk by and someone's watching the news," Chris
Murphy 'O4 said.
The Phoenix poll reveals that fewer than half of respondent can correctly identify whetherBush opposes or favors
gun registration. Although this may not be surprising given
that the campus is heavily democratic, students do not fare
much better when asked Gore's stance on China traderestrictions. Forty-two percent of students said they are not sure
whether Gore favors or opposes placing significant restrictions on trade with China, and 12 percent answered incorrectly. The questions were taken from a national survey conducted by The John F. Kennedy School of Government.
Students said they get information about the campaign
from online publications, print journalism, National Public
Radio, and TV news. Almost all students interviewed said
they watched at least one of the presidential debates. Many
said the debates were a main source of information, though
they did not influence candidate preference.
"I would love it if there were really easy access to both
biased and unbiased informationabout the issues," Goldsmith
said. She said it would be most helpful if there was a packet

that contained concise information about each candidate's
stand on the issues.
Students generally conceded that they do not know the
detail ofcandidates' positions on most of the issues. But while
admitting that they do not understand the issues as well as
they should, students planning to vote said theyknow enough

say.
Almost all of the left-leaning students interviewed
said they considered voting for Nader because they
agree with him on some of the issues and want to have
the option of a third party. For the Green Party to
appear on the national ballot in 2004, Nader must
receive five percent of the national vote in this
election.
Gabe Hetland 'O2 said that the Green Party
movement has attracted people frustrated with the
corporate politics that characterize the two major
parties and prevent people without money from having
a voice. "Nader offers both a change in terms of
addressing new issues and the hope of bringing in a
new politics that includes people from all walks of life,"
he said.

Hetland said 25 to 30 students had attended his
group's first meeting and that students had responded
enthusiastically to tabling in Sharpies.

"NADER OFFERS BOTH A CHANGE
IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING NEW
ISSUES AND THE HOPE OF
BRINGING IN A NEW POLITICS
THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE FROM
ALL WALKS OF LIFE."

According to Hetland, some people are using
strategic voting tactics, meaning that they plan to vote
for Nader only in states where either of the main
candidates has a clear win so as not to jeopardize the
Gore's chances of winning the election.
Nevertheless, most students, even those who were
not from swing states, said they ultimately decided to
vote for Gore rather than Nader. "I feel that with such a
close race, it's important to vote where the vote will
have some pull," Riley said.
Delonte Gholston 'O2, president of College

Democrats, called Nader "a bit of a thorn" for the
Democratic party. He said he finds it "problematic" that
Nader is "willing to sacrifice thirty years of his life's
work by electing George Bush as president."
In the Phoenix poll, Nader received approximately
13 percent of the vote, while 74 percent of respondents
voted for Gore and five percent for Bush.

PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS AT SWARTHMORE

to make an informed decision.
In the Phoenix poll, about 29 percent
of respondents said they had followed
the campaign a great deal or quite a bit
within the last week. By contrast, sixtyone percent said they paid just some or
not much attention to the election.

This level of involvement reflects a
broader trend among young adults.
About 37 percent of all respondents in a
poll conducted by the John F. Kennedy
School of Government said they had
been a great deal or quite a bit of attention, while 42 percent said just some or
only a little. As the age of the respondents decreases, however, so does the
percentage of those who said they were
following the campaign closely.
Most students interviewed said that

the main issues being discussed in this
campaign do not seem directly relevant
to their own lives.
"So many of the issues, such as prescription drugs and social security, are
not ones that [people our age] tend to
feel as strongly about," Marie Becker 'O4

said. "These issues don't feel as real;
[we] don't have as much of an emotional
reaction to them."
Political Science professor David
Boatwright feels that this is a widespread sentiment. "People know [the
election's] important," he said. "But the
issues are beyond the frame of reference
for the average college student ...The
politicians could do a better job of explaining why the issues they're fighting
for matter."
Loesel said that the candidates are
not addressing issues that immediately
impact younger voters because this demographic is not key to the election's
outcome. "This makes me feel that I
don't have a personal stake in the election, that policies will be implemented
upon me and not because of me," he said.

don't have the in-your-face conflicts they
were dealing with. There's a false sense of
security."
Many students did not feel that the out-

come of the election would have a drastic
impact on their lives or the country's future. "I don'tfeel any great impending danger," Emily Shrader 'O4 said. "If Al Gore's
president, I'm sure I'll be okay; if George
Bush is president, I'm sure the world will
keep running."

Other students said that the legislative

branch of government would provide a
check to the executive branch and would
thus prevent major changes.
"Nobody's really angry," said Dave Thomas 'O2, president of the College Republi-

cans. "Students are more or less happy
with the way things are going, which
doesn't drive interest in the elections in the
same way."
According to those interviewed, the decline of party loyalty in America and the
fact that Swarthmore students tend to be
relatively well-off might also help create a
feeling of complacency.
Moreover, many students said they are
not paying close attention to the election
because of a lack of enthusiasm about the
candidates. "I don't think either of the candidates is anyone's ideal," Brackett said.

"NOBODY'S REALLY
ANGRY. STUDENTS ARE
MORE OR LESS HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS
ARE GOING, WHICH
DOESN'T DRIVE INTEREST IN THE ELECTIONS
IN THE SAME WAY."

Loesel said that two years ago the lack

of relevant issues would have been im-

portant in determining whether he
voted, since at that time absentee bal-

lots from his home state were harder to

obtain.
Both Student Council co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol and College Democrats
President Delonte Gholston 'Ol said that
the candidates' failure to engage the
younger generation may have diminished students' interest in the campaign.
For instance, when asked how to involve
young voters at the third debate, Gore

did not address the question.
"It's shameful, but not surprising
given the low voter turnout, that politicians don't have a forceful and persuasive youth message," Gholston said.
But several students, particularly
those who are more politically involved,
say that issues such as abortion and the
economy do effect our generation. "If we
elect someone who doesn't know what
they're doing, we might be waiting
tables instead of trading stocks,"
Brackett said.
However, Loesel, like other students,
feels that there is no single issue to drive
people's interest in the election.
"There's nothing that makes me think
that the nation's future is at stake,"
Loesel said. "In four years nothing's

going to be that different."
Comparing students' involvement today with that of the sixties and seventies, Kristin Sharpless 'Ol said, "We

"They both seem pretty flat. The unfortunate thing is that there's no candidate to
make us proud to be Americans."
The candidates' uninspiring (and even
annoying) personalities, as well as their
similar stances on many of the issues, has
made the election relatively uninteresting,
students say.
For instance, Murphy said he followed
the campaign closely while McCain was in
the race because he liked not only his stance
on the issues, but also his personality and

background. His interest waned substantially after McCain dropped out, however,
and since then he has not made an effort to
keep up with election news.
"I'm not involved in the campaign [now]
because there's so much other stuff to do,"
Murphy said. "It's not interesting enough
to put aside those other things."
Shrader is not a registered voter and does
not plan to vote next week. Her decision was
influenced by both her lack of political interest and the candidates themselves.
"I did not get terribly interested in the
process," Shrader said. "I'm not a very politically minded person." Shrader said she
is not particularly excited about either candidate, both of whom seem fairly similar in

their views.
Moreover, she said she could not make
an informed decision because she had not
been following the election. "I don't think
[the election] is an urgent thing, and we
should leave it to people who do think it's
an urgent thing to vote one way or the

THE PHOENIX

other."
The lack of strong interest in the campaign may be indicative of the general lack
of political involvement among Swarthmore
students.
Brackett

said

he does

not think

Swarthmore students in general are as politically active as their parents and grandparents, though perhaps more so than at
other college campuses. Nevertheless,
Brackett said he was impressed that around
200 students showed up for the first debate.
"As politically apathetic as sometimes it
seems that students are, it was nice to see
that might not be the case," he said.
Gholston said that most students on
campus have a good grasp of the issues and
strong political views. Nevertheless, he said
it is a challenge to get students to translate
their convictions into "meaningful political
action," primarily because many students

are focused on academic interests.
Expressing a similar viewpoint, Thomas
said, "A lot of students are politically aware
but very few are politically involved
...They're not willing to give up a Sunday
to go and pass out fliers for Gore."
Most students interviewed share this
perception that while a small group of students are very politically active, and most
students care about politics, political involvement does not characterize the campus as a whole.
Murphy said that most of the people with
whom he interacts are not politically involved at all. "I expected more political involvement than what I've seen," Murphy
said. "It doesn't jump out at you."
Students interviewed tend to agree that
non-political community service is much
more prevalent on campus than participation in political organizations, though most
feel that both volunteerism and political activism could make a difference.
Luft said, "It seems like people are very
excited to do volunteer work but are constantly being begged to do stuff for the
Democrats and Republicans."
The Phoenix poll reveals that about fortythree percent of students are currently active in community service, while 15 percent
participate in a political organization

These results are consistent with national trends. A survey conducted by the
Kennedy School of Government shows that
60 percent of students participated in community service within the past year, but 16
percent joined a political organization.
Shrader said she felt as if she could make
a greater impact through community service than through political activities. "Sending in a ballot doesn't feel like making a difference, whereas volunteering, you're getting your hands dirty; it feels like you [have]

something to show."

All of those interviewed agreed that their
parents' level of political involvement has
at least some influence on their own inclination to participate in politics.
Shrader, for instance, said that her
mother is apathetic about politics and probably influenced her attitude.
Describing her family as "middle-of-the
line" in terms of political involvement, Goldsmith said, "I probably would have more
motivation to be very knowledgeable if my
parents were more involved."
Loesel said that the fact that his parents
voted consistently had a greater influence
on him than their political views. "That
demonstrated to me the importance of being there and expressing your voice. It said:
this is your government, and you have a
role in it and a responsibility to it."

Does Swat
stifle a
diversity of
views with its
liberalism?
The Phoenix poll found that
nearly 80 percent of respondents
are Democrats, while about six
percent are Republicans. But

while liberal atmosphere is a fact
of life here, not all students are
happy about it.
"To an extent, the campus is
bordering on close-minded
liberal," said Lindsay Goldsmith
'Ol "There's a lot of pressure to
be liberal and that ends up not
letting people have the space to
not be liberal." According to

Goldsmith, those who came here
undecided about their political
views are much more likely to
develop a liberal outlook because
of the left-leaning climate on
campus. "You get a lot of
information from on side and not a
lot from the other," she said.
According to Goldsmith, the
lack of diverse viewpoints also
precludes more wide-ranging
debate. "There's more likely to be
a debate of technicalities within
one mind-set rather than a debate
of different views," she said. "You
come to Swarthmore to learn how
to think. Part of learning how to
think is dealing with different
points of views."

"TO AN EXTENT, THE
CAMPUS IS BORDERING ON CLOSEMINDED LIBERAL"
Indeed, Dave Thomas 'O2, who
is president of the College
Republicans, said some students
dismiss candidates because of
their party affiliation rather than
their views on the issues.
"It would be fun to have more
Republicans on campus," said
Brackett, who felt that greater
representation of a conservative
viewpoint could make campus
discussion more exciting while at
the same time allow for greater
learning. "Arguing with someone
else's position helps you
understand your own," he said.
But some students did not mind
the predominately liberal
atmosphere on campus. "I think
it's nice to have people around
who share your views," said C.J.

Closets can cause claustrophobia
BY JONAH GOLD AND
MORGHAN HOLT
He spent his high school years

skirting the issue, creeping
around it, going out of his way
to make sure people didn't know,
or even suspect, that he might be
different, thathe might be queer.
And it was hard. In the locker
room with his classmates, he'd
laugh nervously and agree when
they said some chick was hot,
nervous not because he didn't
think she was hot, but because
he'd never noticed. He'd just
never looked. It sucked his energy, simply going to school, so
much thathe'd wake each morning and psych himself up for another day of hiding, another day
ofkeeping careful watch over his
mannerisms, of avoiding any and
all stereotypes, for fear that
someone might catch on, someone might start to wonder and,
eventually, think that he was
queer. What it did do for him,
this horrible, taxing process of
hiding his true self, of masking
his identity and specifically
straining to stifle his natural inclinations, was fine-tune his
"gaydar," so that he could pick
out his closeted compatriots,
which made things worse, because they all knew they were in
the same boat, but could do nothing about it. Finally, he got so
fed up with the day-in and dayout deception that he cracked.
He just had to tell someone. So
he did. He broke down and told
his friends. Three of them. Then,
he knew that they knew, and that
he had nothing to hide.
When he left for college, he
swore things would be different;
he'd start off on a different foot,
and let everyone know from the
outset, so that he wouldn't have
to rehash his charade, he
wouldn't have to hide himself.
He wanted to be out, he wanted
to be known, and he thought,
probably, he'd be accepted. Only
he wasn't sure how to do it. No
one on his hall was overtly queer,

and no one he knew had talked
openly about it. And how, exactly, does a person come out to

everyone at once? He didn't
know because he'd never had to
do it. So he took the high school
tactic. Only once he got to know
people, really got to know people,
he'd drop subtle hints that got

increasingly less subtle until

they guessed or he simply told
them. One group at a time, he
was opening himself to the
world, letting himself experience

the real world, unafraid of how
it would react, the awful things
it'd say. And he was happy with
the process; though slow, it was
working well. Coming out was
getting easier.
So why weren't people catching on? He was no longer painfully aware of his every gesture

and what it might suggest. He just
let loose. So why hadn't his idiot
roommate gotten the picture? Why
couldn'the tell? And why, for God's
sake, did he persist in trying to set
him up with female dates for Screw?
No longer seriously concerned

about individual reactions and feeling supported by both the queer
community and the general
Swarthmore atmosphere, he decided to come out, once and for all
to end any deception to which
he'd been clinging. He was queer,
and he was proud. And he wanted
the world to know.
He's glad that he had his coming
out experience at Swarthmore as a
basis to help him deal with his parents' unexpected discovery of his
sexuality. The only weird response
he's had to revealing his sexuality
has been the expected quasi-homophobic "I hope you're not attracted to me," which he just thinks
is funny. Laughing, he winks and
says, "you know, just because I'm
queer and you're maledoesn't mean
I want you."
As you may have noticed, the
sidewalks, apart from their usual
colorful chalkings for the latest
sporting events and concerts, are
saying some interesting things of
late. "Kiss your roommate." "No
guilt." "How could anyone ever tell
you you were anything less than
beautiful?" And so on. The slogans
are idealistic, the art is of above-average stick-figure quality, and the
big idea is Swarthmore's version,
albeit a couple weeks later than the
national occasion, of Coming Out
Week. The Swarthmore Queer
Union (SQU) wants to know: How
sure ARE you?
But some students have some
reservations SQU's approach to
reaching out to questioning students. Students such as Casey
Schroeder 'O4 are adamantly not in
support of Coming Out Week, they
don'tneed "a. week to identify [themselves]." These students view the
week as being conducive to the construction and application of homo-

sexual labels, which are potentially

"coercive

and

disgusting."

Schroeder believes that SQJJ-sponsored Coming Out Week potentially
discourages questioning students,
who may be confused about their
sexuality but not necessarily ready
or secure enough to take it to that
next level, from coming out of the
closet. It makes people desperate for
labels. Besides, he says, there's really no reason to insist that people
come out in the Swarthmore community since it is, after all, "very
accepting, more so than the real

world."
The organizers ofSwat's Coming
Out Week, however, directly state
that it is not intended, for the most
part, to beabout "coming out" per se.
"The main purpose is awareness," says William Tran 'O3, one of
the organizers ofthe events. "It's not
necessarily to get people to come
0ut...0f course, it would be great if

Suzanne Wu Phoenix Staff

we could get people to come out."
Adrian Daub 'O3, who planned the
widely attended Eyes Wide Shut
party that kicked off the week last
Friday, elaborates, explaining the
connectionbetween the name "Coming Out Week" and what the event
is designed to do in the way of education, activism and fun: "It's supposed to provide the kind of situation in which queer students who
might feel closeted would feel comfortable coming out. Not justfor this
week, but in general—it's supposed
to get people on the path to tolerance."

But how tolerant, exactly, is our

campus as a whole? The simple answer seems to be, as Schroeder

pointed out, that Swarthmore is indeed a culture that is amazingly accepting with regards to sexual ori-

entation. And Adrian agrees: "No
one treats you differently...people
don't treat you withrubber gloves.
I think it's the best climate to [come
out] in." For most of the campus,
this appears to hold true. If nothing else, the proliferation of buttons
and stickers throughout our population is evidence of the straight
community's support of both Coming Out Week and queer life at
Swat.
It seems that compared to the
virulenthomophobia in much of the
outside world and on many other
college campuses, Swat is in many
ways a safe haven for its bisexual,
lesbian, transgendered and gay students. Daub says it's "crazy how ac-

cepting people here are," and that
he "probably wouldn't have been

if he'd gone to
another school." Further, Emily
Chavez 'O3 describes Swatties' responses to students coming out as
able to [come out]

"generally very positive,"
But, as Jackie Aponte 'O2 points
out, appearances can be deceptive.

"This may seem like a 'liberal haven,' it's not all that liberal, it's not
all that queer-friendly."
Obviously, something's gone
askew if, in the face of the large proportion of queer students who feel
there's no place like Swat to be open
and free about one's sexuality some
are still feeling unaccepted.
Homophobia may not be a part
of the Swat mainstream by any
stretch, but that doesn't mean it isn't

there. While public intolerance on

campus is virtually non-existent,

when no one is looking things are a
little different. Flyers for Coming
Out Week have been torn down by
students, to varying degrees, in this
and other years. Last year, the rainbow flag that graces Tarble during
Coming Out Week was stolenby unidentified parties, though an anonymous apology was later received.
This is fairly indicative of the type
of homophobia that appears in a
small, diverse environment like
Swat.
"As long as you don't act on it, or
it's nothing major or hateful," Daub
says it can be reasonably dealt with.
"Individual homophobia is one
thing. Institutional homophobia is
another. That's when we'd have a
problem."

Schroeder agrees, stating that homophobia is expected and, to a deTHE PHOENIX

gree, natural, but that it's slowly
being remedied with the reinstatement of the Queer-Straight
Alliance, which he believes "allows openness for the entire
group, so that people aren't just
wallow together in their selfpity." Still, in spite of these ob-

servances, and the concession
that homophobia remains and
will likely continue to remain a
social problem, the majority of

Swattie intolerance of the queer
student body occurs out of the
public eye or from hidden
sources, where the queerfriendly majority cannot negatively judge or reprimand the
people responsible.
Like so many related social
misunderstandings, the answer
to this problem is, of course, edu-

cation. And that's where Coming Out Week starts to really
matter. For first-years in particular, many of whom come
from environments in which
open homosexuality is far less
common, Coming Out Week is an
opportunity to show people that
SQU, and the broader queer community, is an active presence,
and one that can't hurt them. By
opening the SQU doors, events
which are frequently, and semicontroversially, closed to nonqueer students, Coming Out
Week is in many ways a demonstration, on a large scale, of what
the queer community on campus
is all about.

BOOK

'Brooklyn': Great literature from ingredients of pulp
BY CATHERINE OSBORNE
There are five books by
Jonathan Lethem listed on the

inside cover of "Motherless

Brooklyn," and if they are even
half as good, I want to own them
all. Lethem won the 1999 National Book Critics Circleaward
for his novel, recently released as
a paperback. It's his unforgettable and twisted tribute to a
wide-ranging pantheon ofAmerican classics: Brooklyn, the detective novel, orphan stories, and
The Artist Formerly Known as
Prince.
"Brooklyn," in short, has it
all. There's even icing on a cake,
which probably would have been
delicious anyway: the sheer joy,
which Lethem takes in his skill
with words, is enchanting, and
addictive. He gets a great chance
to show it off with his narrator.
To serve this function, Lethem
snatches a hard-boiled preTechnicolor private eye from

Raymond Chandler, spins him
until dizzy and stands him on his
head, then dumps him into 1990s
Brooklyn to make his way as best
he can. Poor Lionel!

Lionel Essrog is a man with problems: his beloved boss is dead, his
partners (one or all) may be selling
him out, there's a murderous Polish
giant on his trail, and he is totally
incapable of lying low. Lionel, you
see, has Tourette's Syndrome (a
mental affliction which inspires obsessive-compulsive behavior and inappropriate outbursts). Every person with Tourette's is unique,

Lethem and Lionel tell us. Each has
his or her own variation on the basic formula. Lionel's own version is
composed of obsessive touching and
linguistic gymnastics, what he calls
"echolalia salad," in which words
cascade through endless sideways
repetition. For instance, "Yorkville
Zendo" is successively transformed:
"Don't know from Zendo, Ken-like
Zung Fu, Feng Shui master, Fungo

bastard, Zen masturbation." The
first-person narration means we live
inside Lionel's head, struggling with

his tics and enjoying them at the
same time.
The affliction doesn't make him
stupid, however. When not obsessively expelling language from his
brain, he is intelligent and funny, at
times even aphoristic ("Coney was
occasionally a master of the intimi-

dating non sequitur"). He was a

great reader as a child. And he

wants desperately to be Philip
Marlowe, to navigate effortlessly
through a worldof tough broads, alcohol, and small-time Mafiosi. In a
way, he gets lucky. Lionel, who is an
orphan, and three other hard-luck
residents of St. Vincent's Home for
Boys are pulled out in their early
teens to work for Frank Minna, a
glad-handing petty criminal with a
few shady Italianconnections. Once
grown up, the boys become "Minna
Men," working as "private eyes."
Lionel doesn't have long to bask in
the comfort of his relatively safe
world and family, though; Frank
Minna is stabbed to death in the first
chapter. Lionel grieves desperately.

Because of his affliction, he had always been Minna's pet, "as if he
were an idol and I his public, a mass
audience devoted to puzzling him
out." Now he is cast adrift. And the
other Minna Men are little help.
Big, dumb Gilbertalmost immediately gets himself locked up—unjustly—for the murder of the man
believed to have killed Minna. Tony,
long blinded by dreams of his Italian heritage, seems to be trying to
get Lionel out of the way so he can

step into Minna's shoes without op-

position (and without closely investigating Minna's death, in which he
may have been involved). Inhumanly cool Danny hardly seems to
give a damn either way, but Lionel
suspects he may be on Tony's side.
And Julia, Minna's cold, unhappy,

bleached-blonde wife, who doesn't
seem very sorry that he's dead,
leaves Brooklyn first thing for parts
unknown. Then there's the mysterious Yorkville Zendo, a Zen meditation center in Manhattan where
Minna went to meet the men who
killed him. Could Buddhist monks
be the murderers?

"Brooklyn" has all the ingredients for a riveting detective story, a
half-tragic, half-comic Chandler/
Hammett pastiche. What catapults
it from the cheap-paperback category to capital-L Literature is
Lionel's illness. In a recent inter-

view Lethem noted that Chandler
and Hammett "were excavating material that had been treated only contemptuously, in pulp terms, and
making something literary out of
it." What they did for the mean
streets of American cities, Lethem
is doing for the unexplored reaches
of the brain. He seeks out the hu-

manity in an affliction generally
regarded as dehumanizing, since
it interferes so drastically with
the ability to interact with others in a socially acceptable way.
And he makes us laugh.

What more could we ask?
Jonathan Lethem will read and
sign books at the Philadelphia
Borders on Monday, Nov. 13, at
7:30 pm.

RESTAURANT

The pastry of the proletariat
BY HILLARY DRESSER
I went home to Boston for my sorelyneeded October break. Curling up on the
couch each morning with a cat, a crossword, and a cup ofDunkin' Donuts coffee,
I settled deeply into my comfort zone.
The autumn leaves were just past their
peak. They wavered precariously against
a bold blue sky. My dad clomped around
the yard in boots, planting bushes and raking leaves. The air outside smelled likefall
in New England, crisp and burnt. Inside,
the kitchen smelled like Dunkin' Donuts
coffee and muffins; I knew I was home.
We New England folk are known for a
local loyalty that borders on being irrational. Just ask my dad how the New England
Patriots are doing this season. He'll give
you a confident wink and assure you that
their year is coming. The Boston Celtics?
He'll promise you that Rick Pitino is going to come through any season now. It is
this same loyalty that keeps a Dunkin'
Donuts standing strong on every neighborhood corner in Boston.
There are Dunkin' Donuts stores in all of
the subway stations in Boston. There's one
in every roadside service area on every interstate highway in all of New England. In
my suburban hometown of30,000,1 can think
of five different franchise locations.
My parents stop at a Dunkin' Donuts
every morning en route to work. My sister, who moved out of New England three
years ago, has me bring her a few pounds
of Dunkin' Donuts coffee beans whenever
I visit her on the West Coast. A friend of
mine from Boston swears by the Dunkin'
Donuts egg and cheese sandwich and eats
one every morning for breakfast. I love
New England, particularly Boston; therefore, I love Dunkin' Donuts.

Ah, Dunkin' Donuts. The coffee: an inoffensive, unspecified blend with a light to
medium body, goes down easy, wakes you

16

NOVEMBER 02, 2000

up, and tastes about as interesting as hot,
muddy water. The donuts: sweet, heavy, and
room temperature never hot, which makes
-

me question that "Time to Make the Donuts"
campaign. The "hey, we're hip" menu additions, like CoffeeCoolatta and Dunkaccino are
unsurprisingly mediocre.
Someone might think that the recent phenomenon of specialty coffee chains would
have wiped Dunkin' Donuts out long ago with
their superior products and trendy appeal. But
in New England, drinking Starbucks would
be like becoming a Cheesehead. It's just not
honest. A true New Englander will truck out
in below-freezing weather to the crumbling
Foxboro Stadium and stand behind Drew
Bledsoe as he sets the record for Most Sacked
New England Quarterback. A true New Englander will look you dead in the eye and tell
you that Dunkin' Donuts coffee is the best
coffee in the world.

The Starbucks infiltration poses no threat

to Dunkin' Donuts in New England. For every
single Starbucks, there are easily five Dunkin'

Donuts franchises. The market is cornered.
Why? Because New Englanders know that
when they go into Dunkin' Donuts and order a
"regular" coffee, they're going to get the same
coffee with cream and sugar that they have
gotten every day since they were fifteen years
old. Dunkin' Donuts provides New Englanders
with comfort food, and as long as it always delivers, New Englanders will remain loyal.
I partook of Dunkin' Donuts comfort food
during my break, but it wasn't until the last
Sunday morning ofbreak that Dunkin' Donuts
truly came through for me. I got up early, intending to plow through my so-far-untouched
work. My dad had picked up some muffins at
Dunkin' Donuts, and he, my stepmom, and I
sat down together to enjoy our usual Sunday
breakfast routine.
Thefirst bite ofmuffin hit my stomach like
a ton of bricks, the corners of my mouth
turned down, and before I knew it, my head
was spinning with nausea. Had Dunkin' Do-

THE PHOENIX

Suzanne Wu Phoenix Staff

nuts failed me? Had my tried-and-true comfort food struck me with food poisoning? I
braced myself to heave, but instead of vomiting, I started crying.
It wasn't the food thathad made me sick. I
was sick with anxiety. I wept to my parents
about the five-credit, multi-extracurricular
hell of my life at Swat. I sniveled about how
much the knots in my back hurt, and how they
would not go away. I whined pitifully to my
parents about how much I hated Swarthmore
and begged them not to make me go back.
Before break, I thought I had solved my
academic problems by going to Java Joe's
every morning for breakfast and doing homework there. I was determined to milk every
possible hour in the day. But at the end of
break, when the inevitable Sunday of my return had arrived, I broke. My dad helped me
calculate the number ofhours I usually spent
on my various responsibilities, and we found
thatI was working almost 65 hours each week.

It was ridiculous. I had to drop a credit.
After making this decision, my muffin
went down smoothly. The coffee cheered
me. I realized that my Dunkin' Donuts

muffin had acted like a barometer, predicting an approaching storm. When Dunkin'
Donuts failed to comfort me, it was because
something in my life was seriously out of
whack.
In the Philly area, there is not a Dunkin'
Donuts on every corner. The Dunkin' Do-

nuts are spread out by five or ten miles
along the Baltimore Pike. It is not quite as
accessible as at home, but there is one very
close to Swarthmore, on Fairview and
MacDade Blvd. Swept up in the whirlwind
of our lives here, it's important to reach
for those things that bring you closer to
home and closer to safety. If you're a New
Englander, a visit to Dunkin' Donuts has
a way of reminding you who you are and
what really matters.

PRINCESS SLUG
FOR A BUTT
Look, you can lie to me and tell me otherwise, but I am
simply not very good in social situations. Oh please, that
comment was not meant to elicit pity. Give me some credit
that is such an obvious cheap ploy. I can do much better.
And awkwardness is an 'in' thing, in case you haven't noticed. Besides, my particular brand of ineptitude seems to
draw out latent motherly instincts in the type of person
who fancies himself the sensitive-confidante-type with a
particular ability to understand brooding misanthropes.
He flatters me and hugs me because he feels somehowobligated to caress my self-image and hold my hand on this
side ofemotional chaos, because after all, only he, withhis
acute perception, can even begin to understand the nuances
of people's tortured souls. I could even, ifI was feeling grandiose, call myself a pet cause, but most of the time I can
take care of myself just fine thank you very much, though
I may appear and act otherwise. So there.
In any case, I have found that my instant reaction to
any nerve-wracking social situation in which I feel pressure to talk is to immediately begin to complain. I walked
into class early the other day, a rare occurrence, and some
guy I know vaguely and dislike irrationally was already
there, so I was forced to make small-talk with him for the
15 or so minutes until more people began showing up. If
my actions during the ensuing rant had matched the way
my words sort of bitch-slapped into unconsciousness any
semblance of self-control, then I would have, without hesitation, been laying on the ground kicking my legs into the
air in some cinematic toddler's temper tantrum.
In a desire not to tell this guy anything, I somehow
started telling him everything. Goddammit, I really hate
that guy, now that I think about it. He looks like a troll and
has one of those 'my-fingers-are-up-my-nose' voices. And
he wears mismatching shades ofkhaki. In the first place,
no one should really wear more than one article of khaki
clothing at a time, regardless of whether or not you bought
the entire outfit at the Gap and it all matches perfectly.
The character of khaki is dependent on what it is worn
with, and therefore itis meant to be mixed with more domineering shades. Khaki and black, khaki and lavender, khaki
-

and navy and red, khaki and duct tape each outfit carries a distinctconnotation. Black muscle tee and khaki cargoes, strappy lavender tank and khaki capris (cringe,
capris. cringe), skinny khaki pencil skirt with boatneck
navy and white striped tee, red sneakers and those new
'not-socks', party boy artist's old fisherman's hat with the
duct tape embellishment. Hoo-boy. As my brother would
say, "Give her a diving board, cause she's going off again."
Shit. Usually, the phrase "Now what was I talking
about?" is a device I use when I'm too lazy to think of a
good transitional phrase, but in this case, I honestly can't
remember what the hell I was talking about. Um, I'll just
-

Back and ready to bitch
On why awkward stuttering is infinitely more attractive than big boobies
keep typing until I snap out of this premature memory haze
oooh, haha. I just thought of what the hell I was supposed to
be writing about. Comic books. And being socially inept. I
once compared a friend's affinity for big, buff guys, who she
says makes her feel smaller to my affinity for guys who are
more awkward than I am, who I say make me feel hipper.
Who needs big breasts when you've got a stutterer, or better
yet, a mute? So, I'm countering my boyfriend's comic book
girl fantasies with one of my own. (He says he can't help it
because they are such exaggerated, idealized icons of beauty)
And my awkward two-dimensional jealousy ploy goes by the
-

name of Madman.
Killed in a car accident, Mike Allred's title character, Madman, is brought back to life by crazy genius Dr. Boiffard, who
is trying to discover the secret to life. Boiffard sews up the
newly undead body and names him Frank Einstein, after the
"two greatest men of the 20th century," Frank Sinatra and
Albert Einstein. Frank has no social skills because he can't
remember anything about himself, and he has these random
panic attacks where he suddenly reads people's minds or eats
their eyes, though Allred explained in a Wizard interview that
the eye-eating situation was an incidence of his bowing to a
perceived reader desire for "dark, gritty fare." I don't think I
could ever eat anyone's eye, but I hate a lot of people enough
to at least think about it.
Immediately after Frank eats the bad guy's eye, he coughs
it up, sort of a metaphor for the direction the comic takes after the unnecessarily grotesque scene. The book gets kitschy
and ironic and almost sappily romantic, when Frank finds an
object of desire to pine away for, be too nervous to talk to, and
ultimately perform macho feats of heroism for. He's also really self-conscious about the lingering scars on his face (just
like me! See, we were meant for each other), and the Madman
persona is borne out of the double benefit of being a superhero: he gets to wear a mask that hides his scars and gets egoboosts from defeating such baddies as the Street Beatniks, who
shoot at him with more deadly versions of those hipster kitsch
Wham-0 disc guns.
And then there are these misunderstood degenerating
clones, one of whom moans "I just want to be nnoooormaaal,"
before he accidentally decapitates himself on a popcorn machine. Even to this day, and Madman has been around since
1994,1 have difficulty saying the word "normal' without drawling, which I'm sure can be misinterpreted as offensive. I'm
sorry. But for some stupid, inexplicable reason my brother
and I thought that scene was the funniest thing ever and acted
it out all the time. Wow, we must have been annoyingly repetitive. But I suppose karma has worked itself out, because
I'm going to kick the next person who says, "whaazzzup" to

me.
And while Madman is occasionally a little too absurd

and the occasional banality of the situation. Like in issue
no. 3, when this crazy murder plot involving the mayor of
a small town is stymied, and Madman asks the mayor what
he wants to do with his new-found appreciation for life.
"Well, I'm not going to dawdle anymore," the mayor says.
"The middle school needs some new basketball hoops."

And while most agree that there
is need for something like SQU's
closed meetings, the whole point of
Coming Out Week is openness, not
just about one's own sexuality, but
about the ideas and preferences of
others as well. This is a notion
Adrian thinks may be better facilitated by keeping small discussion
groups "safe" but opening large
group meetings to the public,
thereby eliminating any mystique or
wonder or fear that surrounds SQU,

the queer community and its
agenda. Because Coming Out Week
is not simply about actually coming

and self-expression and acceptance,
it serves to broaden Swattie horiNathan Ashby-Kuhlman Phoenix Staff

As a community far more tolerthan the outside world,
Swarthmore has the opportunity to
represent a model for the future of
inter-sexual relations. But before
that can happen, change must occur
not just in the public facade of tolerance, but in the way individuals really think about differing lifestyles
when they're alone or with a select
ant

group of friends and the ways in

which they choose to respond to such
notions. Coming Out .Week is for the
queer population, obviously, but it's

for the rest of us, too.

Ultimately, SQU wants us to see
that, as the slogan goes, 'even if

you're straight, you don't have to be

narrow.' And Adrian says that it's

worth a shot, because broadening
your horizons and opening yourself

is "terribly liberating."

DU'S Staff say ES
Deans ban alcohol
at DU fraternity
From FRATERNITY, pg. 3
that night. Monday morning, DU leaders called him, he
said, and he set up a meeting. The alcohol ban was decided upon "because [the alcohol poisoning] was specifically at the organization and it was a very serious

situation," he said.
In other cases where students have had to be taken
to the hospital, Goundie said, it has been due to drinking in dorm rooms or at multiple parties. When alcohol
abuse occurs within the context of an organization, he
said, action must be taken. If alcohol poisoning were to
occur in another organization, Goundie said, "they could
expect similar sanctions."
The student was released from the hospital but declined to comment on the incident.
According to Goundie, "the college has a policy that
we will not adjudicate someone that was seeking medical treatment." The student, however, was cited by borough police for underage consumption.
The ban will be primarily based upon honor, according to Goundie. "I feel DU agreed with it," he said. "They
recognized that it was a serious situation... they don't
want to be in that situation again." If, however, it becomes apparent thatthe fraternity is violating the agreement, "there would be a real possibility of closing the
house down," Goundie said. He pointed out that the alcohol ban could be an opportunity for DU to prove that
"it's not just about hanging out and drinking."
Fraternity brothers, however, do not seem as optimistic. Four of the fraternity's officers declined to comment, including members of the social committee and
DU Risk Manager Ken Kim 'Ol Doug Kneeland 'O2, DU
treasurer, said, "I have no comment, and neither does
anybody else in the fraternity." Five other members of
the DU leadership, including president Scott Murray
'Ol, did not respond to e-mail or voicemail requests for
comment.
Schembs, virtually the only fraternity member who
was willing to discuss the incident, said, "People get
alcohol poisoning regardless ofwhere they're drinking.
It's just unfortunate that something like this happened
at DU." He said that the fraternity would "have to accept the consequences."

I CHEST COLUMNIST

Agunloye wins second title

NBA up for grabs this year
BY FRANK MARTINEZ
The 2000-2001 NBA season
started on Tuesday with a few assumptions that most people are
taking for granted. The most obvious one is that the West is very
dominant whichever team wins
the West wins the NBA Champi-

onship. The other assumption is
thatthe West has three elite teams:
the champions from two years ago,
the San Antonio Spurs; the reigning champion L.A. Lakers; and the
sometime-in-the-future champion

the Portland Trailblazers. While
I'd take a bet saying that one of
these teams will win it all, the NBA
is a lot more of a free-for-all this
year than most people think.
First ofall, there are only three
elite teams, and each one is vulnerable. We can start with the defending champs, who bring back
Shaq and Kobe, but also have two
new starters. Can the new Lakers
execute the triangle offense like
they did last year, and will the new
guys especially problem child
Isaiah Rider be as defenseminded as last year's squad?
It is easy to doubt the Blazers
after their fourth-quarter Game 7
collapse against L.A. last year.
-

-

They have so much talent, two
teams of five starters, but nobody
to step up in crunch time. Rasheed
Wallace was the only one scoring
in that final period last year, but

everyone needs to pitch in, not just
watch. Portland also has new players
in the mix, giving Coach Dunleavy
another hard job of keeping every-

body happy and maintaining team
chemistry. They didn't doit last year.

Will the Blazers show Paul Allen that
the NBA isn't baseball? That you can't
buy a title?
San Antonio is theeasiest top team
to dismiss. Tim Duncan and David
Robinson form a front court that has
no equal, but look at last year: Duncan
sat out the endof the season, making
the Spurs an average team and guaranteeing them a first-round playoff
exit. Will he come back as strong this
year? And what about the stereotypical soft seven-footer of 35 years, Mr.
Robinson? All this team ever did was
beat an out-of-their-minds Knicks
team in the finals of a lockout-shortened season.
All of the so-called elite teams are
vulnerable they aren't as high up
on the pedestal as people believe. One
injuryto Shaq or Kobe or either of the
Twin Towers would kill any hopes for
L.A. or San Antonio. Portland could
survive injury, but there are serious
doubts about their dedication to play-

ing together and doing it when it
counts. Everybody assumes that the

West is best, but take away the three
powerhouses and there are a lot of
competitive teams. The Jazz will win
50 games until Malone and Stockton

decide that the spark just isn't there
anymore. Seattle finally got a big man

BY CATHERINE CLARK AND DONALD NGUYEN

in Ewing

an old one, but a big man
nonetheless.
That brings us to the Eastern Conference, destined to be an also-ran. I
must say, though, no matter how
much better theBlazers are than, say,
the Heat, a team from the East will be
in thefinals. Once you get there, anything can happen, especially against
an over-confident, worn-out-from-getting-there West team. There are a lot
ofEast teams that could be a lot better than expected. Orlando hit the
free-agent jackpot this summer, while
downstate rival Miami, despite no
Mourning, will still be the team to
beat. Milwaukee has so many offensive weapons that someone is always
hot, and the Sixers play an almost
college defense, and after all, defense
wins championships. The Knicks

have experience.
The NBA isn't football, with teams
like the Rams going from last to Super Bowl, and the salary cap prevents
big markets from buying champion-

ships like the Yankees do. There is
true competition in the NBA now. The
last almost 20 years have produced
subsequent dynasties of Lakers,
Celtics, Pistons, Rockets, and Jordan's
Bulls. For the first time, the defending champs did not repeat last year.
Look for that to continue as some 20
teams have legitimate hopes of making some serious post-season noise.
Even the Clippers are optimistic and
if that is not a sign of league competitiveness, I don't know what is.

Both cross-country teams traveled to Westminster, Md. last weekend to compete in the eighth annual Centennial Conference Championships. The weather was brisk and a windy 55 degrees on the hilliest
course to date, a golf course to boot. "I was looking forward to this
course because it was going to hurt a lot," said Joe Makin 'O3.
Coach Pete Carroll called the day an "A-minus/A performance by
both teams," especially for the women, who finished fourth out of 10
teams. Leading the pack was winner Joko Agunloye 'Ol, who nipped a
Dickinson runner at the finish line to capture the title by three-tenths
of a second. Her time of 18:56.20 broke the old course record by 14 seconds. She is the only cross-country runner in Centennial Conference
history to be on thefirst team all four years and second to ever repeat
as the winner. Maria-Elena Young 'O4 finished 10th in a time of 20:06,
making second team All-Conference. Close behind her was Christen
Lungren 'O2, finishing 17thwith a time of20:34. In herfinal Centennial
Conference Championship race, co-captain Alissa Parmelee 'Ol finished
60th with a time 21:45. Rounding out the top five was Loring Pfeiffer 'O2,
who finished 62nd with a time of 21:49. "[The] women moved up two
places in conference," said Carroll, 'Wen though we graduated four of
the top seven last year." The team's future looks good.
The men's A-minUs performance earned them sixth place out of
nine teams. Leading the way was co-captain Marc Jeuland 'Ol, who
finished second with a course-record-breaking time of 26:28. This second-place finish earned him first team All-Conference for the first time
in his illustrious career. "[Jeuland] battled well against the top five
Haverford runners," said Carroll. Sam Evans 'Ol ran superbly, finishing 13th with a time of 27:26, which earned him second team All-Conference for the first time. Evans missed All Conference by one place
his freshman year. Finishing next for the team was Joe Makin 03, in
40th place, with a timeof29:22. Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol and Keith Gilmore
'Ol finished 63rd and 64th with times of 31:02 and 31:04, respectively,
rounding out the top five.
Both teams have the weekend off as they prepare for the Mideast
Regional race on the Nov. 11 at Dickinson College. The top seven runners will represent Swarthmore.

Sports part of campus diversity
From NELSON-LEE, pg. 24
firmly believe that if the football program ends at Swarthmore,
whether in the near or distant future, a valuable part of the community will be lost. Yes, valuable.
Whether you like it or not, athletics are not going to disappear at
Swat. Yes, we will not always post the best records in many sports,
but there are always a number of teams that make it to the postseason. We've even made it to a few NCAA tournaments, surprise,
surprise. Men's tennis has gone how many consecutive years? Look
it up, it's pretty impressive.
With the Athletic Review Committee moving into the next stage
of its mission to assess the health ofathletics at Swat, it is vital that
we re-examine our biases against athletes and support teams like
football, women's volleyball, softball and baseball, for a number of
reasons.
First, they are rebuilding, and are working their way up to be
more than just competitive. Second, the diversity that they, and all
other athletic teams whether intramural, club, or intercollegiate
bring to campus is part of what makes Swarthmore what it is.
Instead of writing off that athlete who sits next to you in class as a
"dumb jock," try to recognize that we are all here because of our
intelligence and scholarship, and that just because he or she spends
upwards of 12 hours a week with a certain group of students doesn't
make him or her stupid. Look beyond labels.

NO HOLDS
BARRED

As the basketball bounces
Here are my predictions for the upcoming NBA season.
They are accompanied by comments that provide absolutely no insight into anything. This NBA season is just an
appetizer before

the Chinese take over the NBA in a year
or two. Don't believe it? Wait until you see 20-year-old 7'5
center Yao Ming. If he played this season, he'd be the second-best center in the NBA.
Eastern Conference
1) Milwaukee Bucks: [deleted beer nuts and deer nuts
joke] In any case, after great deliberation, Frank Martinez
won me over. I think it will be close, but the Bucks will
have better team chemistry and outside shooting than the
Magic, and I think that will put them over the top.
2) Orlando Magic: Money can't buy you love. Or can it?
3) Philadelphia 76ers: Allen Iverson's creating as much
offense with his rapping as he is with his crossover. And
that's a lot of offense.
4) Indiana Pacers: No one thinks they'll be this good,
but wait until you see how good Jermaine O'Neal and
Jonathan Bender are. Can these guys even drink yet?
5) New York Knicks: What the hell did they get Glen
Rice for?
6) Toronto Raptors: Other than Vince Carter, no one in
their starting lineup can score. Why does Vince Carter play
in Canada, where nobody gives a damn about basketball?
7) Miami Heat: No 'Zo, but they have a coach who could
get a hockey team to the playoffs.
8) New Jersey Nets: On paper, a good team. Team, however, is made of paper and will probably disintegrate due
to injuries in by midseason.
9) Boston Celtics: Best player gets stabbed 11 times for
no apparent reason. Isn't it great to be a Boston sports fan?
More predictions: Celtics win lottery, draft Yao Ming. For
two weeks, I am extremely excited. Then I shoot myself
because my mom won't ever stop talking about a 7'5 Chinese guy in Boston and won't stop complaining about how
she married a short guy.
Western Conference
1) Portland Trailblazers: Most obnoxious thing to say
while playing any NBA video game: "Not your vidas, not
my vidas, but Arvydas."
2) Los Angeles Lakers: Why in God's name did they sign
J.R. Rider? It's kind of like grabbing a syringe and injecting yourself with carcinogens.
3) San Antonio Spurs: Twin Towers in a city I actually
don't despise.
4) Utah Jazz: Their stars are older than dirt, but unlike
most of the youngsters in today's game, Karl Malone and

John Stockton understand basketball. And in the case of
Stockton at least, English.
5) Phoenix Suns: I've always liked the Suns. They are
always a playoff-caliber team, and they're always fun to
watch, but they are never quite good enough to really be a
serious title contender.
6) Seattle Supersonics: If some of their players bounce
back, they could be right up there with the elite. As long as
they don't have Patrick Ewing taking the last shot in games.
7) Sacramento Kings: Kind oflike Heather Graham. You
see 'em at first and you're like, "Daaaaaang, man, that's
some good stuff." Then you realize they play defense about
as well as Graham acts.
8) Minnesota Timberwolves: That secret agreement with
Joe Smith was like selling your soul to the devil to go to
prom with your ugly sister.
Eastern Conference Finals: Knicks versus Magic
(Knicks in 7) It's a major crapshoot in the East and I believe that come playoff time, the Knicks will have things
sorted out and play their typical physical game and excel
in the playoffs. They have a tremendous edge in experience over a team like the Bucks. Plus, goddamn New York
teams always win.
Western Conference Finals: Blazers versus Lakers (Blazers in 7) It's a toss-up here. The Blazers are loaded, and I
think they've got the stuff to beat the Lakers this year.
Finals: Trailblazers versus Knicks (Blazers in 5) This
is the Blazers' year. They've got the best personnel, coaching and depth.

-sive backfield. Throughout the
game, Swarthmore's offensive line
Matt Rapoza 'O3, Ed Albers 'O2,
Chris Morello 'O3, Dan Burke 'O3,
Doug Kneeland 'O2 and Pagliei
opened holes that fit Clark's s'B",
180-lb. frame quite comfortably.
Fullback Lane Oatey 'O3 shut down
Franklin & Marshall's linebacking
corps, allowing Clark to break free
for seven runs over 15 yards.
"Lane and the guys up front did
an unbelievable job," Clark said.
"We were able to keep exploiting
[Franklin & Marshall's] weaknesses."

But the game was not won as easily as Clark's statistics suggest.
Swarthmore drove 46 yards on 13
plays on its first possession of the
game, only to lose the ball on downs
and watch the Diplomats take the
ball 90 yards in three minutes for a
touchdown. Although Swarthmore
bounced back from the score, the
Tide defense had trouble keeping a
lackluster Franklin Marshall offense out of the end zone, giving up
15 points in the first half.
On the strength of Clark's legs
and his early third-quarter touchdown, Swarthmore ground its way
back into the game. The Garnet
Tide went on top for good when
widereceiver Keith McManimen 'O2
caught a short pass from quarterback Scott Murray 'OL then faked
out a handful of defenders on the
right sideline on his way toward a
68-yard touchdown. But the outcome was still in doubt until midway through the fourth quarter,
when Clark cemented the Tide's
lead with his third touchdown run.

in preparation for the snap.

Clark's 52 carries were the result
of a change in Swarthmore's game
plan, one that seemed to work for the
normally balanced offense. Clark and
his blockers carried the majority of
the offensive load and softened the
Diplomats' secondary, allowing
Murray and the Tide receivers to pick
up six first downs on play-action
passes.

"The coaches had enough faith to

keep running the ball, and the line just
stepped it up," Pagliei said. "We consider Kenny's yards just as much-ours
as his, and as the game went on, we
wanted the ball more and more."

Alvanos saw the Tide's four touchdowns as a big leap forward offensively
for the team.
"We've had success on offense in
past weeks, but we just haven't been
able to hang on," Alvanos said. "This
week we scored when we needed to. We
gave up more points than we would
have liked, but when we had to make
a stop, we made it."
The victory gave the Garnet Tide
tremendous momentum and a practicefree Sunday heading into this week's
Centennial Conference matchup

against Western Maryland. Unfortunately, the team will need every
bit of that momentum to compete
with the Green Terror, the 14thranked team in the nation and the

owner of a 26-game conference win-

ning streak.
Playing on the road at 1 p.m., the
Garnet Tide will have to contain
double-threat quarterback 800 Harris, who in his last game against formerly unbeaten Widener ran for
three touchdowns and threw for two
more. Swarthmore will also be depending on a repeat performance
from Clark against a Terror defense
that is giving up an average of 13.5
points.
Despite the long odds, the Tide
isn't prepared to give up the ground
it gained last week.
"We've rallied and fought, rallied and fought, and we've never

lost faith in ourselves," Alvanos
said. "When our back is against the
wall, we can surprise people. We
didn't throw in the towel last week,
and we don't plan to this week."

Men take third place
Washington to OT
Things could have been very different for the
Garnetmen's soccer team this year with a little luck.
Unfortunately, the team suffered yet another close,
but no cigar loss at the hands of the Washington
Shoremen in their season finally. The 2-1 overtime
loss was the team's 4th overtime loss of the season
and dropped their record to 3-11, 0-8 in the Centennial Conference. The team plays its final game of
the season against Haverford on Saturday.
On the bright side, the Garnet did break a scoreless string that spanned more than three games
against Washington. Justin Stanisky 'O3 scored with
an assist from Kent Bassett 'O4 to put the Garnet on
the board first. Unfortunately, Washington rallied
for a goal in the 87th minutes by Jose Lejarraga to
send the game to overtime. Six minutes into overtime, Geoff Foltyn scored for the Shoremen to hand
the Garnet yet another heartbreaking golden goal
loss. The Garnet should take solace in the fact they
gave a team that is currently 3 rd in the conference at
5-3 just about everything they could handle.

BY MAUREEN VERNON

Although they weren't named Centennial Conference
champions, the Swarthmore field hockey team came away
from last weekend's conference tournament at Johns Hopkins
with a bid to the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championships. Johns Hopkins, which won the tournament, received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
The second-seeded Garnet faced Washington College, the
third seed, in their first game at the tournament. The Garnet
had beaten Washington during the regular season 2-0, and
mirrored this result in the Conference semi-final game. Kim
Cariello 'O2 tallied the game-winning goal, her 12thof the season, off a breakaway. Cariello dribbled down the right side of
the field and beat her defenderand the goalie to score.
Washington continued to pressure offensively, but the
strong Garnet defense, led by three saves from goalie Kate
Nelson-Lee, kept Washington from scoring. Washington had
an opportunity to score after earning a penalty stroke with
1:29 remaining in the contest, but Nelson-Lee was able to deflect the goal attempt and preserve the shutout.
Meg Woodworth 'O3 recorded the insurance goal for
Swarthmore during the second half. Cariello assisted with a
cross-pass to Woodworth, who was positioned in front of the
Washington goal. Cariello ended the season as the team's leading scorer, ranked fourth in the conference with twelve goals
and five assists.
The Garnet next faced the top-seeded Johns Hopkins, undefeated in the Conference during the regular season. Earlier in the year, the Garnet had fallen 6-0 to the Blue Jays.

However, the team was determined to play to their potential

against the favorites, and they did not disappoint.
Swarthmore dominated Johns Hopkins, out-shooting the
Blue Jays 7-2 and holding a 6-1 penalty corner advantage in
the first half. But the Garnet was unable to convert any scoring opportunities in the first half, which ended deadlocked
at 0-0.
The defensive battle continued into the second half, until

Hopkins tallied the only goal of the game off a penalty corner
with 26:23 remaining in the second period.
Despite the Hopkins goal, Swarthmorehad several chances
throughout the second half to tie the game. The team caused
four penalty corners in the final minute and a half, but could
not convert any of them. One shot got past the Hopkins goalie,
but the Hopkins defense posted a defensive save with 1:10
remaining in the contest. Despite the tough loss, the team
members were extremely proud of their performance. The
game statistics illustrate how well the team played:

Swarthmorehad 13 shots and 12penalty corners, while Hopkins
registered only eight shots and five penalty corners.
Cariello described the game as "the best of the season." She
also said that the lack of a goal was not indicative of who won
on the field. "Although we didn't score, we dominated and
showed them how we can really play," she said. "We showed
them that we are at least equal, and in my opinion, better, than
every single one of them, in that we have class and skill, and
we are just good, fun people."
Erika Williams 'Ol had a similar reaction. "I don't think
I've ever played on a team that came together as we did against
Hopkins," she said. "It was the most amazing experience, the
excitement on all of our faces knowing that we were beating
this team by how well we were playing on the field. Even though
we did not come up with the win, it still felt like a win. That's
a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
The loss dropped the team's record to 14-6, but the Garnet
received a bid to the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championships, which begin this week. The team will play Frostburg
State University at home on Wednesday in the first round of
the tournament. The winner will travel to Montclair State to
play in the semi-finals against Montclair State. Swarthmore
was the only team in the Centennial Conference to receive a
bid to the ECAC championships. The team's spirits and motivation are high going into the tournament. Lindsay VanSciver
'O3 described the team as "an incredible group ofathletes peaking at the perfect time to finish off this season with a championship."
The third-seeded Garnet plays on Wednesday; the top two
seeds received a bye. According to Nelson-Lee, this position
allows the team a week of improvement. "We are in a good
position because of our third seed," she said. "Traditionally,
we don't do well with a week off, such as our poor showing
against Johns Hopkins the first time we played them, and the
first-round game gives us a chance to work on our game." However, Nelson-Lee cautioned, Frostburg should not be taken
lightly. "FSU is not a bad team; the game on Wednesday won't
be a walk-over," she said. "They've beaten some other Centennial Conference teams, such as Dickinson, but also lost to
Western Maryland."
Nelson-Lee said the tournament will be exciting for a number of reasons, and the Garnet could come away with an impressive showing. It "will be an interesting one to watch, simply because of the diversity of teams," she said. "Looking at
the field, it's a well-matched tournament and we have the
potential to take it all, but not without some work. If we focus
on retaining the level we played at last weekend, there's no
doubt in my mind that we will take it all."
,

The women's soccer team concluded their season
with a 1-0 homecoming loss against archrival
Haverford. Anna Filip scored for the Fords, who won
despite being outshot 9-7. Goalkeeper Sari Atschuler
"01 concluded her fine career by making six saves in
the loss. At 6-3-1 in the Centennial Conference, the
Fords were one of the tougher teams in the conference, so the team played well in defeat.
The Garnet finished the season 4-12, 1-9 in the
Centennial Conference. Watch out next year though,
almost all of the key positional players will be back
the for the Garnet.

Puckers welcome
hockey players of all
skill levels
Not having enough wet, slippery, hard-hitting

action in your life? Are you getting less exercise than
King Tut? We may have your solution. Perhaps there
is no greater picture of diversity than Swarthmore's
ice hockey club, Mother Puckers. This group of the

good, the bad and the ugly meets every Thursday
night at 9:45 p.m. at the Parrish Rose Garden circle
and travels to a nearby hockey rink for a couple
hours of pucking it up.

Don't have a stick or skates? No worries, all the

equipment you'll need is provided for you gratis. And
don't worry if you skate worse than a hippo. That's
why they have C-line. The C occasionally stands for
comedy, but as someone who's done the C-line thing,
I can tell you that you'll be the one with the smile on
your face.

Football stereotypes
need to be shed
Tolerance is one of many abstract ideas that are
thrown around on campus. We fight for tolerance, for
understanding, for comprehension perhaps
through a large activist group, perhaps through a
small support group. Many of the larger debates on
the social aspect of campus (no, not in the getting
booty sense) emphasize tolerance.
Though we are repeatedly bombarded by
propaganda to support this or believe that, the
instant an unsavory (sometimes, but not always
conservative) idea is expressed, a backlash ensues,
embroiling the letters section ofThe Phoenix for
weeks. It is quite clear that many groups on campus
feel that they are "right" and any other idea is
"wrong" and "offensive." It has been said many a
timebefore that too often tolerance on this campus
does not include the opposition.

With last week's alcohol poisoning at a DU pledge
event comes the continuation of a negative
stereotype of the fraternity, and no doubt there are
Swatties discussing the value of such organizations
on campus. I mean, they're just stupid elitist white
men who play football why must we include them,

right?
Intolerance is founded on stereotypes, and
unfortunately, we, as a community, do not try to
break down this particular one enough. Yes, a
student came very close to death last week, and DU
has accepted the consequences. Nary a drop of
alcohol until the end of the academic year. The point
of this particular decision (call it a punishment if you
will) is to provide an opportunity for the fraternity to
show the rest of us that their activity is not
proportional to the number of kegs down at the
house. This is the perfect time to start to chip away
at the DU-football stereotype that consistently
pervades campus.
It is important to stress that although football
players are members of the fraternity, DU and
football are not synonyms. It would be as absurd to
associate the Ultimate teams with Student Council,
or SWIL with Folk Dancing. Yes, there are overlapping
members, but what does that mean? That I go to one
meeting to talk about the other?
But even as examples, these are poor
representations of the magnitude of the "revenge-ofthe-nerds" vendetta (sorry Ted!) that many people on
campus have against the sport of football. I could be
crass enough to compare such an extreme hatred of
the group to racism or homophobia, but that is going
a bit too far. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that
these guys are perfect, but as a campus, we need to
attempt to re-examine our biases and opinions to
break down the negative stereotypes that we hold.
With the recent Homecoming win over Franklin &
Marshall, our total Centennial Conference wins come
to two. This is our best conference showing since
God knows when, and it is a credit to the hard work
of both the coaching staff and the players. (The
length of the typical football season is eight games.)
These guys have worked their asses off for over
four years to get this far, and this is not the best the
team can do. If we continue at the rate we're going,
Swarthmore will again be a threat for first place. But
how long are they going to have this opportunity?
As a community, if we continue to rag on the
program, the tide will turn (bad pun, I know)! And I

Homecoming kings: Tide bests F&M
Clark sets school rushing records with 317 yards, 3 touchdowns on 52 carries
BY JUSTIN KANE
His eyes welling with tears,
Swarthmore head football coach Pete
Alvanos stood in front of his team in
the end zone after Saturday's Homecoming win overFranklin & Marshall.
Alvanos lowered his head, and his
team kneeled in front of him. Nobody
said anything. Nothing. And just as the
silence became overwhelming, he
turned his face toward his team, tears
streaming down his cheeks. "I am so
proud of you," he said, his voice
wrought with paternal emotion.
"After all we've been through this
week
after Dickinson, after Sunday,
I'm just
after this week's practices
so proud of you." Although Alvanos
continued speaking, praising the players' effort in their 29-21 victory, what
really mattered had been said, and everybody understood.
A disappointing 30-13 loss to
Dickinson a week earlier had sent the

Garnet Tide into a downward spiral.
Three consecutive losses were weighing heavily on team morale, and infighting among teammates was worsening.
On the Sunday after the loss to
Dickinson, Alvanos and his coaching
staff tore into the team, running a fullcontact, full-pads practice.

"We got after them Sunday,"
Alvanos said. "I've never held a full
practice the day after a game. It was
about as radical as I've ever been."
But the team didn't respond well to
the tough-love approach. The squabbling continued until Alvanos sat the
team down for a "heart-to-heart" talk
after a rough practice Tuesday afternoon. After the players and coaches put
their grievances out in the open,
Alvanos challenged the team to show
some real grit.
"I told them that we had a tough loss,
and thatthe week wasn't going well, but
this is the week our character is going
to show," Alvanos said. "This is the

week to prove ourselves."
And so the recovery began. "After
that speech, we really pulled together
as a team," offensive lineman Justin
Pagliei 'O2 said. "The team leftwith one
heartbeat."
The best medicine, however, was a
record-setting performance against
Franklin & Marshall Saturday that se-

cured the Garnet Tide's best finish in
the Centennial Conference since 1995.
Behind a dominating offensive line,
Swarthmore running back Ken Clark

'O3 set school records for carries and
rushing yards, picking up 317 yards on
52 carries. Clark also broke the Centennial Conference record for carries and

tied the school record for rushing
touchdowns, scoring three times on
runs of one, seven and 48 yards.
Play after play, Clark took the
handoff and burst through the Diplomats' defensive line and into the defen-
