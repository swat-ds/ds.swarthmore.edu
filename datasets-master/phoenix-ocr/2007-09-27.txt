Possibility of later hours at McCabe under investigation
BY MARIA KHIM

mkhiml@swarthmore.edu

Student Council is investigating the
possibility of establishing later operating
hours for McCabe Library. Presently, the
library closes at 1 a.m. Sunday through
Thursday, at 10 p.m. on Friday and at 6 p.m.
on Saturday. Council is working on a survey to gauge student interest and is engaging in active conversation with librarians
and administrators to determine the feasibility of later hours, especially with regard
to any negative effects the change could
have on students' well-being as well as the
monetary costs involved in staffing the
library for additional hours.

Student Council members began lookinto the issue after several unrelated
students approached them about extended
library hours and suggested that it be
brought up within Student Council meeting

ings.

"Later hours would definitely be good,"
Kevin Kim 'll said. "Last Saturday, I
stayed until 6 and I almost got locked in. I
like to do my research using books so it
would be nice if McCabe would be open
later for times like when I'm writing a history paper at three o'clock in the morn-

ing."
According to College Librarian Peggy
Seiden, a similar case was looked at a few
years ago, when students were asked in a
survey during what hours they wanted the
library open.

Although the majority of responses
were split between wanting McCabe to stay
open until 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., there were

some concerns raised about the effects that
would have on the students' sleep.
"There has to be a recognition of the
fact that students are able and often do stay
up late and that they have different sleep
schedules and work schedules. The school

should be responsive and accommodate for
the different student needs," said Student
Peter
President
Gardner
Council
'oB.However, this still remains an issue of
some concern amongst college administrators.
"I am aware of the typical Swarthmore
student behavior of staying up late but I'm

concerned about the health deficits,"
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal said. "If the college institution
supports the library staying open later at
night, then are we sending the message
that students should be staying up later?"
"We always worry about whether students are getting enough sleep. From my
experience, people who have more studying to do or are on a different sleeping
schedule simply move to a different place

to study when the library closes. We will
look at those two issues as potentially
related issues, but mainly separate ones,"
Dean Jim Larimore said.

Student Council has been having discussions with various members of the faculty who have been supportive, but who
have also raised several issues that need to
be considered.
"Nobody is saying that this is a bad
idea, and everyone has been very receptive. We have been met with nothing but

optimism and positivity from the administration," Gardner said. "But the issue is
basically cost and student life: what are the
trade-offs and benefits, and ultimately, if

this would be useful or beneficial."
The student survey that will be conducted within the next few weeks will be

intended not only to determine whether a
majority of the student body wants McCabe
to be open later, but also, more specifically,
with what resources and for what reasons.

"One of the more important things to
know is who would be using the library at
these later hours and for what purpose,"

Elisa Lopez Phoenix Staff

The Student Council plans to host a study break in McCabe soon to survey students
about the use of library resources, and the potential need for extended hours.
Westphal said. "I'm curious about what
problems are going to be solved by keeping
the library open and whether there are other
better solutions to those problems."

Cost is also an issue that has been

brought up, but according to Seiden, is a
lesser concern. Seidan said that it could cost
anywhere from $l5OO to $5OOO in terms of
costs per year. "The cost for us to do this is
not prohibitive, it's not a huge amount of
but
money in the scheme of our budget,
the question remains about what the
demand for this is, why students want the
library open for extended hours, if they do,
and if it is ultimately worth the additional
costs," Seiden said.
"With any thing that has a budget
...

impact, there is always a question that people will ask-if for the same dollars, are there
other things that are higher priority that we
should attend to? This is something that will
be part of the conversation in the future,"

Larimore said.
At this point, Student Council has just
started the process of looking into this issue,

and, according to Gardner, this will probably be part of an ongoing discussion
throughout the semester. "As of yet, it is far
too early to say how or when we would
implement it
anything specific is far too
early to say. We will continue investigating

this further and there should be more news
forthcoming in the next few months,"
Gardner said.

School commits to its own environmental agenda
BY SARAH PETERSON

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

As of Tuesday evening, 406 college and university presidents had signed the American College and University
Presidents Climate Commitment. Swarthmore, however, is
currently not on the list of signatories.
According to the official Web site, the environmental
commitment is "a high-visibility effort to address global
warming by garnering institutional commitments to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions, and to accelerate the
research and educational efforts of higher education to
equip society to re-stabilize the earth's climate."
Local institutions such as Haverford College, Bryn Mawr
College, Villanova University and
University of
Pennsylvania have signed the Commitment, as well as other
elite liberal arts colleges such as Middlebury College,
Oberlin College, Macalester College, Bowdoin College,

Pomona College and Carleton College.
Both administrators and environmental student activists
were aware of the Commitment as early as last spring.
According to Earthlust member Elizabeth Crampton 'O9, the
environmental group decided to make the Commitment
their next focal point following last spring's successful campaign for an increased purchase of wind energy.
Representatives from Earthlust brought the agreement to
the administration on a number of occasions, Earthlust
member Marc Engel 'O9 said.
"[The administration] said that they already knew about
it, and that they weren't very comfortable with having
Swarthmore sign onto an agreement that would bind them
to a series of actions," Crampton said.
Vice President of Facilities and Management Stu Hain,
who has been involved in considering the agreement,
emphasized that the current

decision not to sign on immediately is by no means a definitive one.
The Commitment is a symbolic gesture of dedication and
solidarity among climate-conscious institutions, but also

THE PHOENIX

involves specific and long-reaching requirements for its signatories to put into practice on their campuses, necessitating close consideration. The agreement "has requirements
that have implications across the institution—across the
curriculum," Hain said.
"When we got the first communication about it, it seemed
premature for us to sign on because we didn't want to make
a commitment that we couldn't live up to instantly," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
Since the agreement involves generating and committing
to a long-term timetable towards achieving climate neutrality, Hain, Eldridge and President Al Bloom have discussed
addressing the agreement within the context of the new
"Swarthmore 2025" long-term planning campaign begun earlier this year."We just thought it should be part of the planning process, instead of taking it on by itself," Hain said.
Eldridge said that sustainability will likely receive spe-

cial and focused attention in the planning process. "We
might, in fact, create a subcommittee to work exactly on this,
because it's a pretty big topic and if any one of the planning
groups were to take it on that would displace other topics
that we're taking on," Eldridge said.
The Commitment includes three categories of conditions.
According to the Web site, in the first category the college or
university must "Initiate the development of a comprehensive plan to achieve climate neutrality as soon as possible."
This includes developing organizational infrastructure, taking inventory of the college's emissions, and setting a target
date for achieving climate neutrality, meaning the minimization of greenhouse gas emissions along with interim
targets leading up to the final date. For example, Crampton
said that Middlebury's target date is the year 2016.
The second category asks that the institution engage in
two out of seven "tangible actions" listed to reduce greenhouse emissions while the larger plan is being put into
place. These include offsetting the impact of air travel paid
for by the college, greening new building construction and
purchasing a certain amount of renewable energy—among
September 27, 2007

other possible actions. Finally, the third requirement is that
the institution "Make the action plan, inventory and periodic progress reports publicly available by providing them to
the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in
Higher Education (AASHE) for posting and dissemination."
While the structure and long-term scope of the commitment coincide with Swarthmore's current phase of planning, the specificity of the agreement in some places raised
concerns. "I think it's the same that comes up in a lot of
other arenas, especially—but not exclusively—in higher ed,
that this sort of one-size-can-fit-all mentality doesn't work ...
To imagine that what will work for us ... would be the same
as for Caltech or Arizona State is illusionary," Eldridge said.
Pursuant to these concerns, one of Earthlust's current
goals is to develop a similar plan that considers
Swarthmore's specific needs and resources, while still basing their model on the specificity and structure of the original agreement.
"We decided that we are going to use the President's commitment as a base, but ultimately come up with a tailored-toSwarthmore commitment that would get us to carbon neutrality by 2025," Crampton said.
A structured agreement would also ensures that organizers' current plans would be carried out into the future.
Crampton said an example would be focusing on the issue of
purchasing "green" appliances and vehicles.
"You have to wait until the next purchasing cycle comes

around, and the people who are involved in Earthlust now
might not be here because it will be four years later. But if
you have this structure in place, then it allows the administration and the purchasers to go to that," Crampton said.
Crampton views purchases and on-campus conservation
as crucial components of the school's commitment.
"Conservation should be a mentality for the school... not a
luxury or something that we choose to put on, but something
integral," Crampton said.

Students demand justice at Jena 6 protest
Demonstrators around country rally together, students and faculty join the cause here at the college
tion to Amadou Diallo's murder, which
began his belief in the effect of rallies,
Almustafa commented on the situation concerning the Jena 6.
"We will not get used to this. We will not
get used to the injustice, no matter how
many times it's repeated. We will not get
used to it and this is a declaration of our
humanity," Almustafa said.
In their speeches during the rally, Paul
and Davis explained that the reason for the
gathering was to raise awareness on campus and to send a message of support to the
Jena 6 in Louisiana. At the end of the
speeches, a petition was made available for
those present to sign. The people involved
with the organization of the march had also
tabled at Sharpies with the petition. Paul
said that they had received over 300 signatures. "At Sharpies we got the sense that
people were really interested in this. They
would walk by, stop, pick up a pamphlet and

Last Thursday Sept. 20, Swarthmore students gathered at the train station at the
foot of campus and marched together along
Magill Walk to Parrish, wearing black
shirts and chanting, "Stop the injustice.
Free Jena 6." Several local television news
channels covered the event and later inter-

viewed students.
The rally follows events in Jena,
Louisiana where, after months ofracial tension, six black students from Jena High
School, Robert Bailey Jr., Mychael Bell,
Carwin Jones, Bryant Purvis, Theo Shaw
and Jesse Ray Beard, were convicted for
assaulting a white student, Justin Barker,

from the same high school. Barker was
assaulted on Dec. 4, 2006. Bell, one of the
"Jena 6," was charged with and convicted of
assault. Though his conviction has been
nullified as a result of his being tried as an
adult at 16 years of age, he remains imprisoned pending a new trial as a juvenile. Prior
to the assault, on Aug. 31, 2006, a black student had asked to sit under a "white tree"
where only white students had sat. The next
day, three nooses hung from the tree.

"[The rally] was just very
moving. Just marching up

Swarthmore's rally itself was organized
within days. After receiving an e-mail from
a member of the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society (SASS) suggesting a college response to what happened in
Jena, a meeting was held on Tuesday.
There, Marsha-Gail Davis 10 and Romane
Paul 10 decided to organize a march. "I
know our campus is really small, and [we
asked ourselves] what can we try to do to
help? We couldn't really do a protest
because it wouldn't be effective. We'd have
to be in Louisiana to do that," Davis said.
The next day Paul and Davis met with

Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs
Darryl Smaw, who helped the organizers
acquire resources. Paury Flowers provided
the speaker equipment.
At 5:15 p.m. on Thursday, over 100 students assembled to protest against what
they believed to be an unjust and raciallymotivated conviction. "I thought it was a
very strong presence, the march up to
Parrish. You could see all the students playing Frisbee, eating dinner, everyone just
turned and they saw us and it was just very
moving. Just marching up alone, I got goose
bumps on my arm," Cathy Ng 10 said.
After a moment of silence in front of
Parrish, Davis, Paul, Dean Smaw, President

ing," Paul said. Paul said that the soccer
team had eagerly expressed their desire to
attend the rally and had asked the coach to
pause their practice for the rally and then
continue it afterwards, staying later. "I was
proud of everybody that was there," Paul

said.

Eldridge said that the true bearers of the
responsibility of what took place in Jena

are the educators that allowed such racial
attentions to exist at the school in the first
place. "I'm really disturbed by a failure on

the part of educators at that school for
example, in Jena, to fulfill their responsibilities ... Everything that stems from that is a
result of that failed responsibility to educate," Eldridge said.
"The charge of attempted murder
should be dropped completely with the bail
as well. What needs to happen is that they
need to assess what really happened in the
situation from the first incident, all of that
leading up to the fights," Davis said. "What
should happen is that they should be
expelled and the kids that beat them up at
the party should be, since it's not in school
and it's an outside event, charged of
assault, battery. If you're going to charge
someone, charge them for what they really should be charged."
Paul said another event may be organ-

ized, depending on the development of the
Jena 6 situation.
"The response on this campus and on
lots of other campuses was a nice place to
begin to work on these issues, but certainly not the end of what needs to be
done," said Eldridge.
At the rally, Davis stood on the steps of
Parrish, emphasizing the significance of
support from the Swarthmore community.
"In coming together, we have provided
much needed support for these six young
men and their afflicted families
through our monetary resources, our
...

political convictions and most importantly, our hearts," Davis said.

of SASS RandaU Keith Benjamin 'O9, Vice

President Maurice Eldridge '6l and six additional speakers, who were spontaneously
invited to the microphone, addressed the
crowd. "We thought this case was symbolic
in a sense. It's just one that we caught wind
of. If we didn't say anything about this, we
might as well just not say anything about
anything else," Paul said.
The speakers said that Jena 6 is an indicator of the continued existence of racism
in the United States. "Here we are in 2007 in
America, finding ourselves raising banners
to prevent another Scottsboro, an event in
our history, looking for equal justice [to be]
fairly applied to six black kids," Eldridge
said.
There were also many appeals for action
against prejudice during the rally. "It does
not make sense for you to see something, to
see injustice, to see something that's wrong
and stand idly by
You have to take steps
to make change. You can't just sit there and
let these things happen. If you see it and
have the ability to contribute, make that
contribution and encourage others to do so.
That's our charge; we're supposed to do
that," Benjamin said. Many speakers
expressed outrage at the way the justice system handled the case of the six young men's
conviction, "It should never have happened
because the law is meant to protect people
but instead you find some people that are
racist and they want to use it to hurt people," Maurice Stewart 10 said.

Stem cell lab pushes conventional boundaries
BY

ROSA KIM
rkiml@swarthmore.edu

Cloning. Stem cells. Regenerative medicine. These are
terms you may have heard or read about in the news

over the last decade.
For students in Stem Cells and Cloning taught by
Visiting Professor of Biology Bill Anderson, these are
literally. They
topics they will be examining first hand
will perform experiments most undergraduates just read
about. Some of the laboratory exercises include splitting
flatworms to observe re-growth of entire body parts and
instructing mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to develop
into specialized tissue.
This type of laboratory work is rarely done in undergraduate biology courses. In fact, according to Anderson
and Biology Professor Scott Gilbert, Stem Cells and
Cloning is the first course of its kind to be offered with a
laboratory component involving hands on work with ES
cells at the undergraduate level.
The moral, ethical and political implications of
cloning and stem cell research have received a substantial amount of media attention, continuing to be subjects
of heated debate. The actual science of stem cells and
cloning, which is the focus of this new course, has not
been a prominent topic in public discourse.
"It's important to have students get an understanding
of what is currently known in the field, separating the
science from the hype, and have a true understanding of
what the potential for this type of work is," said
Anderson.

"Students should
be taught the
ethical implications of this work
This is not an either/or proposition,
nor an easy answer, but a balancing
act, searching for the greater good."

...

which cells in the embryo are able to form into any type
of tissue in the body. This creates the potential for growing cells genetically identical to a patient's original cells
that are affected by disease or injury.
Therapeutic cloning might also be able to aid in the
development of models of a certain diseases in order to
take steps toward preventing it. "By the time the patient
is diagnosed, many of the cells that are affected are gone.
You can't really study what is happening in the initial
stages of the disease, the middle stage and the
end stage," said Anderson. He said that therapeutic
cloning not only entails growing replacement cells, but it
might be able to generate a cell-based model to help
understand how certain diseases progress. "I think this
will be a really powerful way to attack some of these diseases."
ES cell research is, however, still in its infancy, and is
also surrounded by many ethical controversies.
The potential to treat many people is a compelling reason for supporting human ES cell research, but it is also
highly controversial because it involves the destruction
of human embryos. This raises questions such as when
human life begins. Scientific, theological and philosophical perspectives present many different viewpoints on
this ancient question.
"I think the probability with [ES cell research] is that
you're inevitably going to make an industry out of creating human embryos through cloning in order to get the
stem cells," said Patrick Tiedemann 'OB, a member of the
Swarthmore Students Supporting Life group. "There's
definitely going to be a price on them because of the scientific research and the money that goes into that. I
think it trivializes and puts in danger the value of life."
"When you start to realize that embryos are going to
have a cash value on them, there's inevitably going to be
women who will want to sell embryos for money.
That would have to be something that has to be watched
out for. It's an exploitation of the ability of women to
harbor these embryos," he said. "I think that what's
really cool is that there are adult stem cells which have
yielded therapeutic results. In that sense, you're
not cloning human embryos, something that can potentially become human. You're just using stem cells that
are naturally in humans, in umbilical cords and other
parts of the adult body
You're not artificially creating
...

them."

According to Anderson, adult stem (AS) cells, otherAnderson is replacing Gilbert who is currently onleave. He recently completed his doctorate in biochemistry from the department of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University.

Anderson previously helped create a class on stem

cells and cloning at Harvard in 2004, which was, to his

knowledge, one of the first undergraduate courses on
stem cell research. However, it did not include a laboratory component. Gilbert said that other institutions in
the country have offered similar courses involving laboratory work with other types of stem cells such as from

the bone, but none include ES cells.
"It excited me that there isn't a textbook for this subject yet because the research is so new; all we read is primary literature. I just thought that was really intriguing," said Macy Kozar 'lO, a student in the course.
Anderson is currently writing a textbook on stem cells
and cloning for use in undergraduate and graduate
courses.
"Plus, you hear about it all the time and I felt embarrassed as a biology person to not understand what people
were talking about," Kozar said.
"It's a topic of great current scientific and ethical
interest. And we feel like it's important to educate ourselves and our students about the biology behind what's
going on," said Biology Department Chair Sara Hiebert
Burch.
Many within the scientific community have expressed
their objection to reproductive cloning. Therapeutic
cloning, however, which involves cloning cells, and not
entire organisms, is another matter.
Scientists continue to look to stem cells in the hopes
that they might one day be used to treat diseases such as
Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Type 1
Diabetes and conditions such as spinal cord injuries.
According to Anderson, ES cells are obtained from
embryos at the blastocyst stage, roughly five and a half
days after fertilization in humans and three and a half
days after fertilization in mice. This is a critical time in

wise referred to as tissue-specific stem cells, are found
throughout the adult body, such as the skin and in blood.
While these cells do not have the ability to form all of the
different cell types present in the body, they do play
important roles in maintaining tissues in the adult. The
course will evaluate, among other topics, the advantages
and disadvantages of ES versus AS cells.

"It's a topic of great current
scientific and ethical interest... it's
important to educate ourselves and
our students about the biology
behind what's going on."
Sarah Hiebert Burch
Biology Department Chair
In the lab, students will work hands-on with mice ES
cells that have been isolated from early stage mice
embryos. They will see how the mice ES cells grow and
differentiate on their own to observe how they generate
special cell types. Later, they will allow the ES cells to
differentiate into specialized tissue in the presence of
certain signals.
Studying functions

in simpler organisms might contribute to a better understanding of human biology. They
will also work with planaria, a species of non-parasitic
flatworms with a strong regenerating capacity.
According to Anderson, students will conduct Thomas
Hunt Morgan's historical experiment splitting the planaria and observing the phenomenon in which they
regenerate entire missing body parts. Anderson said
they will delve into questions such as what types of sigSeptember 27, 2007

and Cloning laboratory class.
nals are responsible for instructing the worm to do this
and why planaria have this regenerating capacity that
humans, except for the ability to regenerate parts of the
liver, do not have.
Burch said, "In [the biology department], we never
ask a student to do anything that they are uncomfortable
with. And if they are taking a class and a part of it is
uncomfortable for them, they are more than free to say,
'this is not something that I feel I can participate in' and
we're happy to provide an alternative activity or something else. As long as they learn the intellectual content
then that's considered fine."
Given the ethical and political ramifications surrounding stem cell research, the course includes an
ethics and public policy lecture later in the semester to
open up the discussion about various ethical perspectives and to help students form their own informed opinions.
"So far, it's been historical studies that have been
done in the field. Thus far, I haven't gotten the chance to
delve into the issues that really question my ethical val-

ues. But I really hope that the class does because that is
a really pertinent issue," said Mark Mai 'O9, a biology
major in the course. I think eventually there is going to
come a point when I'll probably have to take a stance on
whether or not all this stem cell controversy really bothers me."
For Anderson, given that this is such a publicly contested issue, the main goal for the course is for students
to be able to explain the science and then come to their
own conclusions.
Reverend Joyce Tompkins, Swarthmore's Protestant
Religious Advisor said she supports the goals of the
course. "Stem cell research and cloning offer great promise for future healing and should definitely be taught to
Swarthmore students preparing for careers in the biological sciences," she said in an e-mail.
"But students should always be taught to think deeply
about the ethical implications of this work. Ethical or
moral intelligence is just as important to a Swarthmore
education as is factual knowledge. This is not an
either/or proposition, nor an easy answer, but a balancing act, searching for the greatest good."

Clothesline Project draws widespread response
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
The multi-colored t-shirts hanging in
the wind in front of Parrish Hall contrasted starkly with the idyllic weather on
Tuesday afternoon, and time seemed to
stop for those who paused along their
way. Whether sipping coffee, keeping a
hesitant pace with friends or strolling
alone, Swarthmore students examining
the t-shirts wore mixed expressions of
curiosity and solemnity.
The Clothesline Project is an opportunity for survivors of sexual violence and
their friends and family to express themselves by decorating t-shirts.
The t-shirts are coded in different colors to signify different kinds of violence,
which include sexual assault, rape, violence because of perceived queer or trans
identity, domestic violence, child abuse,
incest and murder.

"[Sexual violence is] kind of
a dirty little secret... one
we accept when we ought
to be screaming."
Rhiannan Thomas 'll
Reactions varied across campus, as
one would expect for such an emotionally
charged event.
"I mostly feel really sad
[sexual violence] is much more visible than most
people are willing to [acknowlege]. We
...

don't want to talk about it, it's kind of a
dirty little secret, but it's one that we
accept when we ought to be screaming,"
Rhiannan Thomas 'll said.
"It's definitely hard to deal with. I've
definitely walked by it a few times and
made a point of not looking at it at that
moment," Jesse Marshall 'll said. "I think
it's one of those things that you're drawn
to, that kind of pulls you, which is why
making it a visual thing like this is effective."
Nevertheless, not everyone, even those
set to graduate in the spring, have
attuned themselves to the existence of the

project.
"I haven't looked at it," Jesse Robbins
'OB said. "I've just not [been] familiar with
the project."
Organizers and participants have felt
strong emotions for the project, which
also holds powerful meanings for them.
"A lot of the people I've talked to have
thanked us for putting it on, they think
it's a really important project and are
glad that it's going up again, and I've
talked to a lot of people who saw it last
year and are glad
that another group of
people are getting educated about the
issues," said Patrick Rock 'O9, one of the
organizers of the Project.
In addition to displaying the t-shirts,
the Clothesline Project sponsored an
Open mic Wednesday evening.
"I think people were deeply moved and
inspired by the courage of survivors on
this campus," Urooj Khan 'OB, another
organizer, said in an e-mail. "I felt a definite sense of strength and community last
night, of people caring and looking out for
...

each other."

Yimei Zou 'Phoenix Staff

Celia Caust-Ellenbogen pauses to look at a t-shirt in the Clothesline Project. The shirts
will be displayed for the last time today in Upper Tarble.
Nicole Belanger 'OB, another of the

Project's primary organizers, said the

opening event drew a large crowd of supporters.
"Last night we had about a hundred
people coming to the opening, and that
was honestly more than I ever expected
would come," Belanger said. "I think
we're getting a pretty positive response. I

think that the Open Mic tends to be really
powerful for people."
Thomas said the Clothesline Project
rightly calls attention to uncomfortable
issues that some Swarthmore students
deal with. "It's not a fun thing. Not a comfortable thing. It makes me rather
depressed, but it's good," Thomas said.
"Somebody has to scream."

Kick Coke to present their case to Board of Managers
The group will meet with the Board on Friday; students wrote letters to show support for the campaign

Last Thursday, Kick Coke held an informational meeting for students interested in the campaign's most recent

decision from the Board of Managers.
At the meeting; members presented the facts and a
timeline of the Kick Coke campaign to attendees before
disbanding to allow for questions and letter-writing to

well-informed nor well-researched. "Some Board members think all the information comes from theKillerCoke
Web site, which just isn't true," Roberts said.

Kick Coke organizers also expressed frustration with

the communication between their cause and administration even during their original bid to boycott Coca-Cola.

"It was hard to know what the administration wanted
us to do," Roberts said.
Roberts said that administration was not consistent
with their requests, sometimes referring to money as an
obstacle, other times referring to student support as an
issue.

"[The Board] work[s] hard to make
the campus a great place. They
have a different idea of the campus
than the students."
Sarah Roberts 'OB
Member of Kick Coke
In the meeting, the Kick Coke campaign expressed
feelings that there was a disconnect between campaign
organizers and the Board of Managers. "The Board seems
to have little awareness of what our campaign has been
about," Kick Coke organizer Andrew Petzinger 'O9 said.
"[The Board] work[s] hard to make the campus a great
place. They have a different idea of the campus than the
students," said Sarah Roberts 'OB, another key member of
the campaign.
Roberts said that the Board of Managers did not feel
as though they were amply involved in the decision-making process when the administration agreed to remove
Coca-Cola products from campus. Additionally, some
board members believed that the decision was neither

"It was like pulling teeth to find out how much [the
change] would cost," Roberts said. In the beginning,
according to Roberts, the administration predicted the
cost of removing and replacing Coca-Cola products to be
$1,500 during the first two years of the change.
A few students asked Kick Coke organizers about
Pepsi's corporate accountability abroad, wondering
whether Pepsi, another large enterprise, truly presents a
socially responsible alternative to Coca-Cola.
"We did think about this a lot," Kick Coke organizer
Zoe Bridges-Curry 'O9 said. "We were excited by the
prospects of a local company or bottler, but administration said that Pepsi was going to be the cheapest choice."
Bridges-Curry said that Pepsi, like Coca-Cola,

depletes water supplies overseas, but that the allegations
against Pepsi are less serious.
"One of the best ways to get to all of [the companies]
is to target the industry leader," Bridges-Curry said, citing the exposure of Nike's lack of corporate social
responsibility as an example. Bridges-Curry and Roberts
also pointed to the practical reality in targeting one company rather than another. "You can't ask everyone to
boycott every single bad company," Roberts said.
Kick Coke organizers expect to have 5-10 minutes to
present their case to the Board at the meeting this
upcoming Friday during the meeting. "The Board wants
to see that the potential for change is worth the cost.
September 27, 2007

They want to see that we have done our research,"
Bridges-Curry said.
According to member Ruth Schultz 'O9, Kick Coke will
meet this Friday with Board Members Jed Rakoff '64,
David Gelber '63 and Pam Wetzels '52 to discuss the CocaCola ban before the meeting on Saturday.

"I think it is really disheartening that
the Board may try to make a decision
without the opinions of the students
It is important that we try to
engage in things in the world."

"We hope to discuss our continued conviction that
Coke should not be brought back to campus, that Coke
has not significantly improved and that the investigations are not complete. Hopefully we will hear from
them their reactions to our written response that we sent
them two weeks ago and come to a better understanding
...of where the Social Responsibility Committee is on
this issue," Schultz said.
Using talking points as a guide, students wrote letters
to the Board of Managers to show their support for the
Kick Coke campaign and voice their desires for
increased transparency in the Board's decision-making
process. Kick Coke will present these letters to the Social
Responsibility Committee during their meeting this

Saturday.
"I think it is really disheartening that the Board may

Students invited to campus for Discovery Weekend
Swarthmore plans a weekend for 130 diverse applicants, different club events and forums to be held

BY KATE WALTON

kwaltonl@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, 130 prospective students will arrive on
campus to participate in Discovery Weekend, an event in

which various students of color from high schools across
the country have been invited to explore issues of race and
student life at Swarthmore.
The weekend serves as a chance for students of color to
ask questions about the racial dynamic at Swarthmore in
a comfortable environment with a variety of people. It also
exposes the prospective students to the importance of
diversity and issues of diversity on campus.

"[Discovery Weekend] was a really

good opportunity to see what
Swarthmore academics were really
about... it helped me formulate a
full opinion of the college."
Mary Klap 'll
Prospective students who have shown interest in
Swarthmore, and who have self-identified as students of
color, are encouraged to apply for the chance to partake in
this weekend. This year, 360 students applied for the event,
a process that required an application with two short
essay questions about why they want to attend
Swarthmore and Discovery Weekend in addition to the signature of an educator and the student's GPA.
This procedure differs greatly from the actual admission process for admitting first-year students. "It's not
about putting them under a microscope," said Associate
Dean of Admissions and Director of Multicultural

Recruitment Ryan Keaton. "We're trying to assess students who are going to be a match to the community." The
Admissions Office does not view the weekend as a chance
to judge prospective students on their merit, but instead as
a way to get to know the students better. "What it gives is
one more time to interact with people face-to-face,"
Keaton said. Director of the Intercultural Center Rafael
Zapata was unable to comment in time for publication.
Additionally, the Admissions Office hosts the weekend
to help prospective students become better acquainted
with the Swarthmore campus, student life and faculty.
From the moment they arrive on Saturday to the
moment they depart on Monday, students are given the
option of attending a myriad of different club events and
forums, sponsored by groups like the Swarthmore African
Asian
American Student Society, Swarthmore
Organization and the Queer-Straight Alliance among others. Fumiko Egawa 'll, who attended the event last year,
described the weekend as "jam-packed."
"Everything that happens on this campus [was]
crammed into two days," Egawa said. In essence, students
are given brief introductions to nearly every sort of group
and interest on campus in order to give them a fair representation of everything Swarthmore has to offer.
Events for this year include an Open-Mic night sponsored by the Black Cultural Center and the Intercultural
Center, an ice cream social hosted by MULTI, a Teahouse
Hour hosted by SAO and Han and much more. Many of
these events are optional, but some mandatory ones
include a discussion panel with faculty and another with

students.
The tightly packed schedule, in which something is
scheduled for every hour of the day, ends around eleven
o'clock on Saturday and Sunday nights, leaving the rest of
the evening for the prospective students to enjoy.
Mary Klap 'll, who also attended the event last year
,enjoyed the events but found the classes most memorable.
"It was a really godd opportunity to see what Swarthmore
academics were really about." She adds that she enjoyed

the focus on diversity during the weekend, feeling it provided a comfortable environment for discussion. "I liked
meeting people who were honest about their Swarthmore
experiences because it helped me formulate a full opinion
of the college," Klap said.
While the majority of students who attend Discovery
Weekend apply to Swarthmore, many of whom apply Early
Decision, some use the two days as an opportunity to learn
that they do not like the school. "I think this community
can be a big leap for people," Keaton said regarding the
progressive atmosphere at Swarthmore. "I want them to be
open to learning and to stepping outside their comfort
zones."

"The Admissions Office does not
view the weekend as a chance to
judge prospective students on their
merit, but instead as a way to get to
know the students better."
Ryan Keaton
Associate Dean of Admissions
However, the weekend does not focus on advertising the
school, but concentrates instead on helping prospective
students find a good fit for them, whether it be at
Swarthmore or elsewhere.
The Admissions Office holds workshops that give an
overview life at liberal arts colleges and help students
learn about the application process. They alsb try to educate the students on the Quaker traditions of promoting
fairness and equality, all in an attempt to expose them to
life at Swarthmore College.

Revived ARC campaigns to educate campus
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

"Oct. 2 [is] Gandhi's birthday and
International Day of Nonviolence,"

BY MELISSA CRUZ
mcruzl@swarthmore. edu

this semester, the
revived Animal Rights Coalition
will be coordinating several differStarting

ent campaigns, including the cage-

free egg campaign, which began in
the spring of 2005 and aims to eliminate all eggs produced by caged
hens from Sharpies. In the past,
Animal Rights Coalition efforts led

to the successful removal of veal
from Sharpies Dining Hall in March
2004, but the group has been less
active in past months.
The ARC is making it clear that
Swarthmore students don't need to
be permanent vegetarians to support animal rights. Starting this
year, the group will be urging students to sign "veg pledges," which
will allow students to pledge to be
vegetarian for a limited period of
time, according to ARC president

Claudia Seixas 'lO.

On Oct. 2, the group will have

catered foods and hold a screening
of the film "Earthlings," after which
interested students will be able to
sign a "veg pledge." The chosen date
is significant for several reasons.

Seixas said. "The ARC will also be
celebrating World Farm Animals
Day." Seixas also said that the
ARCwill be focusing on educational
campaigns "to raise awareness on
campus of the impact of issues pertaining to animal rights."
The cage-free egg campaign,
started in spring of 2006, joined the
Swarthmore's ARC
with the
Humane Society of the United
States in an effort to rid the campus
of eggs produced by caged hens.
Josh Balk, Outreach Director for
the Humane Society of the United
States' Factory Farming Campaign,
described the living conditions for a
hen living in a cage in a factory
farm. "Each hen is given a cage that
is smaller than a sheet of paper," he
said. "They are unable to engage in
many of their most important natural behaviors including dust

bathing, perching, scratching, laying eggs in a nest, and they are
unable to do something as simple as
stand on ground." Members of the
ARC in the past have worked with
Balk to promote the switch to cagefree eggs in Sharpies. In April 2006,

Swarthmore's Student Council
passed a resolution of support for
the use of cage-free eggs in
Sharpies, according to ARC member Brian Tomasik 'o9."More than
160 colleges and universities across
the country have drastically
reduced or eliminated the use of
eggs from caged hens," Balk said.
After the ARC met with Dining
Services
Coordinator
Linda
McDougall and Student Council last
year, the cost of switching Sharpies
to cage-free eggs was calculated.
"[lt] would cost about $lO,OOO more
than
the eggs they use now,"

Tomasik 'O9 said. He also said that
this year, the ARC is also working
on establishing an alternative committee to the Student Council for
student groups to approach when
seeking support for initiatives
regarding social responsibility on
campus. This body would be called
the Institutional Responsibility
Committee and would help activist
groups on campus in taking the
steps to make change happen.

Now, even in the future it is bad publicity for Swatties to kill each

as such things go. Now we conclude that Al and a solar yacht passed b
each other before George and Joe began the duel, and that George and Jo
ended the duel at the same time that Al met the yacht. If we recognize tha
time order cannot be an aspect of reality because it is not universal, then
we must recognize that the temporal location of an event can't be used t
determine its reality. This places all times on equal footing with respec

Campus Philly Kicks Off
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu
Is the Swarthmore bubble making you feel
claustrophobic? Have you been meaning to break
out and explore Philadelphia but haven't had the
time or money? This weekend, forget your excuses of homework and laundry and head into the
city.

This Saturday is Campus Philly's Kick-Off
Weekend, marking the beginning of this year's
efforts to familiarize Philadelphia area undergraduates with local museums, artists and businesses.
From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., a variety of museums
will be free of charge to all students with a college
ID. For those who want to visit more than one
museum, there will be free shuttles running
between locales. Some highlights include:
The Philadelphia Museum of Art, currently
exhibiting works by Ellsworth Kelly and home to
ten expansive permanent collections.
The Eastern State Penitentiary, offering guided
tours through "America's most historic prison."
The Rodin Museum, dedicated to 124 works by
the French sculptor Auguste Rodin.
If you're ready for something more visceral
after a morning of touring museums, wander over
to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. From 2 p.m. to
7 p.m. two stages will host both high-profile and
local acts. The main attraction will be rap veteran
Talib Kweli, riding high after the recent release of

his latest album "Eardrum."
"I am pretty stoked to see Talib Kweli for free,"
Bevan Gerber-Siff 'lO said, "It sure beats the 90
dollars they were asking [for a ticket] over the

summer."
Pop-punkers The Ataris and Florida rockers
Against Me! will also perform alongside Kweli.
Local Philadelphia musicians of a less mainstream persuasion will occupy another stage. Acts
include Philadelphia Slick, a 10-piece hip-hop
ensemble, Jealousy Curve, an indulgently indie
outfit, and Trouble Everyday, a powerpunk quartet.
Throughout the day, there will also be what
Campus Philly's web site describes as an "involvement fair." The fair is intended to encourage students to become directly connected with their sur-

THE PHOENIX

September 27, 2007

roundings through volunteer work. Local and
national nonprofit organizations such as Planned
Parenthood and the Philadelphia Special
Olympics will assemble on Benjamin Franklin
Parkway to promote their assorted causes.
Campus Philly, the driving force behind KickOff Weekend, is a nonprofit organization that
serves as a liaison between undergraduates and
Philadelphia's public institutions and businesses.
According to its website, "Campus Philly promotes the [greater Philadelphia] region as 'one big
campus,' full of opportunities for personal and
professional exploration."
Despite Campus Philly's claims of promoting
local businesses and artists, there is a subtle focus
on corporate sponsors. For example, the Kick-Off s
freestyle motocross exhibition will be, as it has
been in the past, sponsored by Red Bull, the
omnipresent energy drink. The entire Kick-Off is
co-sponsored not only by local universities but
also by global corporations such as IKEA and
Pizza Hut.

Pop-punkers The Ataris and
Florida rockers Against Me! will
perform alongside Talib Kweli.
Corporate malaise aside, there is no reason to
miss out on Kick-Off Weekend. Getting off campus
is always a challenge for busy Swarthmore students. When asked if she planned to attend any of
the Kick-Off events, Margaret Cosgriff 'O9
responded with a simple, "No," and Eleanor
McSherry 'lO with "I hadn't even thought of going
[to the Kick-Off]."
Conscious of the confines of the bubble,
Swarthmore is making it extremely easy to get to
the Kick-Off. Vans will be running starting at 9:30
a.m. from Ben West to ferry students to and from

Philadelphia. The last van will leave Philadelphia
at 7:15 p.m.. So, wrench yourself away from that
problem set, hop on a van and get out.

same breadth and depth as any collection
of multi-student art at the Kitao Gallery.
Kate Goertzen 'O9, a member of the Kitao
Gallery Board, said, "I'm excited about
having one person doing an entire show
that's showing work of all different kinds
that conveys a sense of movement over a
period of time."

Davalos showed his art as part of his
printmaking class last year in the Kitao
Gallery, but since he spent the semester
abroad in London studying fine art, he has
many new pieces to display.
"The contemporary art scene [in
London] is really amazing," Davalos said.
The variety of art and the emphasis on its
conceptual rather than its technical side
influenced Davalos to venture into different types of art, such as installations and
site-based art pieces that are not limited

to a canvas but rather take advantage of

the space in which it is shown.
Devalos' influences include Londonbased installations by Alex Bee and
Brazilian artist 'assume vivid astro focus,"
who uses a pseudonym for his installation
art. According to Davalos, 'assume vivid
astro focus" likes "making the atmosphere
a work of art itself. He'll take a room and
fill it with designs."
Students can see an example of installation art in the exhibit in Davalos' untitled piece depicting vines growing against
a wall, which will be included in the exhibit.
One of the most well received works is
"Fitzroy & Maple," which has already
been shown at an art auction in San
Antonio alongside works of other local
contemporary artists. This print brilliantly alludes to Jacques-Louis David's "The
Death of Marat," which depicts the stabbing of a Jacobin in his bathtub during the
French Revolution
"I'm interested in the appeal of something that you look at, but you want to look
away, and finding the beauty in something
you consider ugly," Davalos said. The contradictions conveyed in "Fitzroy & Maple"
will force the audience to linger in front of
this piece.
According to Davalos, some of the big
themes of the show are the "ideas of integration into a society, figuring out your
place in society and self-identity."
Although Davalos started out focusing his
art aroundLondon's architecture and the
people, his focus evolved into "self-reflection and dealing with personal issues."
"A lot of [his artwork] has touches of

urban London and sociological comments
in general that are very interesting,"
Goertzen said.

to speak for itself. "I want [observers] to

Swarthmore students respond to politically conscious Rebel Diaz
BY SUNNY COWELL

scowelll@swarthmore.edu

Last Friday, Sept. 22, Enlace brought in
the politically active hip-hop group Rebel
Diaz to perform at Olde Club for Latino
Heritage Month. The venue was decorated
with large signs reading "Latino Power"
and other empowering messages. Following
the performance, students joined the group
for an after-party.
Rebel Diaz is made up of Chilean brothers RodStarz and GL as well as the AfroBoricua singer/rapper Lah Tere. For over a
year, Rebel Diaz has been performing in
New York City and can be seen making
music anywhere from a local immigration
protest to a community park. The group
most recently opened for Mos Def, Talib
Kweli, Dead Prez and DJ Evil Dee at Black

August Hip-Hop's 10th Anniversary.
Before Rebel Diaz performed, students
had the pleasure of hearing Eva McKend 'll
open for the group with three powerful spoken word pieces entitled "Independent:
Keep It Moving," "Freedom Is Long Gone"

and "Beautiful."
"This was really exciting for me as a
freshman to be part of such a major event. I
also heard Rebel Diaz perform for the first
time in New York, my hometown, about a
month ago at...Black August. I so much

enjoyed their performance...[that] when I
heard they were coming to Swat, I was really excited," McKend said.
McKend thoroughly enjoyed being part
of the Rebel Diaz performance and felt that
it was amazing that she could open for the
performers as a freshman.
"It just highlights that Swarthmore is a
place where you can be valued for your
meaningful contributions," McKend said.
Enlace members Grace Kaissal 'lO,
Isabel Rivera 'lO and Camila Leiva 'O9
played a major role in bringing Rebel Diaz
to perform at Swarthmore. As co-presidents
of Enlace, Kaissal and Rivera were responsible for heading Latino Heritage month
this year. They both wanted to plan a
month that both expressed Latino heritage
and pride and attracted different groups of
people on campus. Enlace brought in lectures for the intellectual, panels for the
curious, a play for the drama crowd, and a
Salsa workshop for aspiring and interested

dancers.
Rivera said, "Rebel Diaz was Enlace's
way of getting at Swatties who love hip hop,
politics, and those who were simply looking
for a good time on a Friday night. It was an
event that we hoped would attract a wide
array of people."

Enlace was initially introduced to Rebel
Diaz through Leiva, who had entertained

the idea of bringing them to Swarthmore at
Enlace meetings.
"Quite frankly, I don't know of many
other groups like Rebel Diaz that integrate
their Latino heritage and pride with hip
hop and at the same time convey political

consciousness," Kaissal said. "The nature
of the group attracted us to them and made

September 27, 2007

us interested in bringing them here. Their
music is very deep and has a lot of meanings; it raises a lot of questions and points
out a lot of injustices in our communities...
I think it was only natural for us to bring
Rebel Diaz to Swarthmore, a campus filled
with many students who are invested in
creating social change."

JULIAN CHENDER
The Spiritual Scene

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

When members of
Philadelphia
the
Yearly Meeting of the
Religious Society of
Friends
founded
Swarthmore College
in 1864, they established it as a Quaker
institution.
The
College retained its
Quaker affiliation
well into the twentieth century (the first
non-Quaker board
member joined in
1938), and now the
College is officially

secular.

However, while the College itself does not have any religious affiliation, it houses many students who do. Though
the admissions department does not ask for religious or spiritual commitment on the application, Swarthmore has created or rather attracted a diverse religious community.
The College has 11 religious groups— four Christian groups
(Newman Catholic Campus Ministry, Swarthmore Christian
Christians,
Fellowship,
Progressive
Swarthmore
Ecumenical Liturgical Ministry), two Jewish groups
(Ruach, Chabad), a Muslim Students Association, a Hindu
Club, a Unitarian Universalists group, a meditation group
(Swarthmore Sitting Group) and a Baha'i organization.
Such a vibrant religious and spiritual community exists
on campus "because students bring that to the campus as
part of their identity," noted Associate Dean for
Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw, an ordained American
Baptist Minister. People bring religion to campus just as
they bring any other experience. When they arrive, they
may find that there exists a group of people who share their
views, beliefsand traditions, or ifnot, they may start a group
and hope to attract these people.
In this sense, the formation and growth of religious
groups shares many similarities with thatof other groups on
campus. For instance, if you like knitting, you join Knitwits,
and if you like building model ships but there is no model
ship-building club, you can start one.
The difference between something like Knitwits and one
of the religious or spiritual groups is that religious and spiritual commitments usually have a certain outlook on life
associated with them, whereas people with myriad world
views can all enjoy knitting.
It is important to note, however, that for many, if not all,
of the religious and spiritual groups at Swarthmore, one
needn't ascribe to their official beliefs, if in fact they have
any at all. Thus, people with differing worldviews, but who
share some sort of basic view slightly more profound than a
hobby, join together to engage one another in religious and
spiritual traditions and discussion.
What Knitwits and religious groups at Swarthmore share
is that anybody can join. One can come to campus with
absolutely no interest in knitting, and then decide later that
it is actually quite enjoyable. Similarly, one can arrive on
campus with no interest in religion, and then later decide
that he or she likes a certain religious or spiritual group and
join that group.
Religion and spirituality can serve a very important role
during the college years, which explains why these groups
are so popular and numerous. College, for the majority of
students, is the first instance in which one lives alone for
any extended period. Unlike summer camp, this is the big
separation
the jump into adulthood and it is very disconcerting to look down and see that the umbilical cord is no
longer attached. The college years circle around the formation and understanding of the self. Who am I? What do I represent? What do I think, feel, believe? Religion and spirituality can be wonderful avenues through which to explore
these questions.
This is "a time oflife when it's very common for people to
be asking the so-called big questions," remarked Reverend
Joyce Tompkins, Protestant Religious Advisor and
"Interfaith Lady." "It's important to have places where the
students can go and explore those questions and hear from
others who are also seeking answers to the same things."
In this sense, the role of religion and spirituality at
Swarthmore is that of personal exploration and growth.

As rock concerts go, the Earl Greyhound show at Olde
Club on Saturday night was pretty basic: three musicians,
a good-size crowd and music so loud that my ears were still
ringing three hours later. Basic is not always bad and, in
the case of Earl Greyhound, basic was most excellent. The
show was good, solid, heavy metal, great to dance to or just
to stomp your feet along with. It was a perfect way to spend
a couple hours on a Saturday night.
The show got off to a slow start with a lackluster set by
Pora! Pora!, which was mostly notable for its technical difficulties. The lead singer's voice was completely drowned
out by the band, and painful microphone feedback was a
constant threat. Live music is always a give-and-take experience, and the audience responded to the lethargic set in
kind, barely reacting to the music until, during the last
song, the singer jumped into the crowd and literally sang
into several audiencemembers' faces.
The opening set left me primed for disappointment, and
the nearly 40-minute break between Pora! Pora!'s closing
number and Earl Greyhound's appearance only exacerbated the feeling. It is to the band's credit that the trio from
Brooklyn managed not only to not disappoint, but to get me
excited and on my feet, dancing to the music and headbanging along with the rest of the crowd.
Earl Greyhound was billed as a "melt-your-face-off'
rock band, and they lived up to the expectation. From the
opening guitar chord that signaled the beginning of thenset through to the drum, guitar and bass jam session that
closed it, the music was indeed face-meltingly awesome. It

helped that by the time the main act took the stage, the
sound problems that had plagued the first set had been
worked out; it also helped that the crowd was considerably
larger and rowdier. Mostly, however, it was good music,
tight playing and amps turned up to maximum volume

that rescued the show.
The band was described to me as Led Zeppelin-esque,
high praise indeed when directed to someone who owns
every album that Zeppelin ever recorded. Earl Greyhound
didn't quite live up to the comparison really, who could?
but their brand of good old-fashioned, floor-shaking,
eardrum-splitting rock was reliably good. There wasn't a
sub-par number in the whole set. Special kudos go to Matt
Whyte, whose guitar solos provided an excellent counterpoint to the thudding beats, as well as to singer Kamara
Thomas, whose voice managed to be heard loud and clear
by everyone in the audience. It was clear that the crowd
responded to the music; from the balcony it could be seen
that everyone even those who had remained stony-faced
during Pora! Poral's set was getting into the music, dancing or at least moving to the beat. A few audiencemembers
even made a valiant attempt at creating a mosh pit; they
kept it going for a good while despite the fact that only
about six people were involved.
The only major problem with Earl Greyhound's set was
that it was too short; after less than an hour the band
unplugged their amps, thanked the audience and left. It is
always a good sign when the musicians leave the audience
wanting more. To me, the chants of "Encore! Encore!" that
followed me as I left the venue were an undeniable indication that Earl Greyhound was really as face-meltingly
amazing as promised.

Conserve water, just let it mellow
At a party in
Worth last weekend, I
had to use the washroom. Of course,
being an environ-

mentalist, I did not
elect to flush my
urine with two gallons
of drinking
water. As I was washing my hands, someone else entered the
stall and flushed the
toilet, making a frustrated sigh thereby
MARSHALL MORALES
removing my enviGreenery
ronmentally
conscious
action. I
m^^^m^^^^^^^^^^^^^m
thought I would take
this chance to explain
environmentally-smart water choices with toilets, showers
and laundry by starting with the mantra: "If it's yellow, let
it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down."
I remember living in Willets where many men adopted
there are some problems though: smell and
this idea
splash. When an entire line of toilets without lids have
urine and the bathroom is poorly ventilated, the smell can
get pretty rank. (I assume that people are not flushing out
of water conservation concerns, rather than laziness. Let's
hope that's a valid assumption) But in my experience, if
you're drinking enough water, your urine won't smell as
bad. If you just need to pee, don't flush, just add it to the
pot. If you just urinate, it is not worth flushing two gallons
of water. The average American flushes five times a day
if you reduce to two flushes a day for a year, you will save
over 1,000 gallons.
The American shower lasts an average of 12 minutes,
using 48 gallons of water. Most of this time, the water is
simply cascading down our bodies and not being used to
actually wash ourselves. Since all of the water saved is
drinkable, we need to conserve our shower usage! I offer
up my shower ritual as an example of how to reduce water
usage drastically: 1) turn water on to wetbody and turn off,
2) lather up with soap and shampoo, 3) rinse off and turn
the water off, 4) turn water off and apply conditioner, face
scrub, etc., 6) final rinse. Showers in this format usually
take about two minutes of the water running, reducing
water usage by 40 gallons per shower. If you shower each
day, you save over 14,000 gallons per year; if you shower
every other day, you save a lot more.
September 27, 2007

Our other big water usage is with laundry. Up to 50 gallons of water can be used with each load of laundry. It's
best not to reduce load washer size, since it still takes the
same electricity to wash a small load as a big load. The
machine should be full (but not too full), even if you have
to mix with a friend/roommate. Also, we know not every
article of clothing needs to be washed after one wearing
put it back in the dresse. If you can reduce laundry from
every week to every other week, you'll save another 1,000
gallons. That brings our grand total up to over 16,000 gallons of water
think of all the water bottles, dirty dishes
and dried up gardens that are yearning for that water!

The average American flushes five
times a day if you reduce to two
flushes a day for a year, you will
save over 1000 gallons.
Hot water in showers and laundry is actually one of our
biggest energy consuming habits. I encourage you to
experiment with cool showers and washing clothes in cold
water. I think you'll find that your hair and clothes actually feel better without coursing scalding water over them.
In your life after Swarthmore, please use composting
toilets. Feces are fertility, and sending our most accessible
source of fertility down pipes full of water is entirely passe.
Organic agriculture takes heavy advantage of extremely
fertile cow, chicken, llama and especially humanure
(human feces) to boost plant production. Soil microbes and
plants love it! One of the most wasteful things we do is to
put gallons of DRINKABLE WATER into toilets to flush
away our refuse.

This makes no sense, especially in arid climates.
Alternatives consist of catching rainwater to use in toilets,
or not using water toilets at all. Composting toilets are
excellent ways to turn our feces into fertile ground. One
example I saw in Washington state was a once barren field
where a family had moved around a composting toilet that
deposited directly into 6-8' holes. When one hole was full,
theyplanted a tree in it and moved the outhouse to the next
hole. The field is now covered by delicious fruit and nut
trees that feed the family all year. Now each time I flush a
toilet, I can only think of all the food that water and fertility could have produced.

Self-mockery is the latest in luxury fashion
the names "Marc" and "Jacobs" cover its surface about five
times over.
The more I saw the bags, the more I began wondering
what Marc Jacobs was thinking when he designed them.
Maybe he's showing us how easy it is to create an object of
desire out of something as mundane as a tote bag. Or perhaps it is a commentary on brand erosion. Increasingly,
designer brands have been branching out, making less
expensive, entry-level lines to appeal to a wider consumer
base and to appease investors. As more people outside the
upper crust of society get access to designer goods, whether
through greater purchasing power or because of changing
lifestyles and ideals among the middle class, there comes a
point when the brand name begins to lose its appeal.
A year before these bags appeared, Marc Jacobs (the
man, not the brand) had done some even more cheeky work
for his other label, Louis Vuitton. Models for his Spring 2007

MEAGAN HU

It's a Scientific Lifestlye
I rarely find products with designer labels plastered on
them appealing. This summer, however, a certain bag
caught my fancy on the streets of New York City several
times. It was nothing more than a plain canvas tote, but silkscreened onto the front were the words "Jacobs by Marc
Jacobs for Marc by Marc Jacobs in collaboration with Marc
Jacobs for Marc by Marc Jacobs."
The bag, only $l2, was introduced in conjunction with a
wave of canvas tote bags from other designers to encourage
people to stop using plastic shopping bags. Unfortunately,
the bag's environmental purpose has been overshadowed, if
not completely forgotten, by the tongue-twister-like way that

ready-to-wear line swaggered down the runway holding
checkered, woven leather shopping bags. These bags looked
like trompe l'oeil replicas of the plastic, checkered industrial bags one often finds dotting the streets of Chinatowns and
low-income neighborhoods, the ones used to carry groceries
home or to store clothes for the winter. The only visual difference between the two was that the woven leather bags had
a big, circular Louis Vuitton mark stamped onto the surface.
Perhaps Jacobs was reacting to all those people that sell
knockoffs of his bags in Chinatown. "Think you can make
copies of my bags and sell them for hundreds less? Watch me
make replicas of your bags and sell themfor hundreds more.
Suckas." In another sense, the bag also raises questions
about the function of luxury in a new age. Traditionally, luxury goods were used as a distinct class marker, a way for the

upper crust to set itself apart from everyone else. They were
an ideal that people used to aspire to. While

some labels and products still serve that
role, the increasing egalitarianism in the
luxury market has created a marked sensf
of disorientation in people's relationship?
to these brands. By looking toward'
these designer goods to set oneselJ
higher, do the products now make
people appear even more common?
Will others recognize your social
standing when they see you with an
insanely overpriced bag emblazoned with a Louis Vuitton stamp
or will they merely see another
plebe doing her groceries?
In my opinion, these bags are
brilliant for their satirical qualities. These days, ersatz luxury
can too often pass for the real
thing, and designers seem to be
responding with that tried and
true tactic of irony. In an age
when the idea of luxury seems
to have lost its meaning, the
only way to wear a brand
name without looking tawdry
is to wear it with a sense of
humor. Self-mockery is the
new luxury.

shirts and slacks, while the women are
almost exclusively in brightly colored
skirts and dresses, made up with touches
of jewelry. There's a slight air of formality, as if there still remains a bit of "pretend" about the dressing-up, although less
so with those couples more clearly in their

tiated seating and wander the galleries and
to make small talk amongst the images.
Elderly and Elegant: These are the couples that you can imagine having come to
the PMA for ages. They're always impeccably dressed (scarves and discreet glasses, simple earrings and the occasional

knew why they choose the PMA in particular for their early night out did or does

matching. Blacks, greys and whites domiperhaps as a

some sit on the stairs and delicately sip

Oh, to be elderly and to
maintain that ritual of going
out, of appreciating the
multiply layered aesthetics
of sight and sound.
These couples have a tendency to wanmill around the ground floor,
perhaps pick up a drink. Then they'll
ascend the stairs, picking their way
through other people, searching hesitantly
for a spot to sit that's midway between the
bottom and top. It's at this point that an
observer can best tell how comfortable the
pair is as a pair: how soon do they find a
place to sit and with what sort of communication? One clumsy couple in particular
exemplified "the awkward date" when the
man half-sat in one space as the woman
kept walking the stairs, taking her more
than a moment to notice the absence of her
partner. I felt for them. And almost
inevitably, this younger crowd is unable to
sit for more than ten minutes
either the
performance bores them or the silence
between them becomes too much to bear
without something more active with
which to occupy themselves at which
point they rise from their difficultly negoder. They

coordinated without

ing of spots. Unlike the younger

crowd,

they treat the music as more than just
background noise, quietly listening and
clapping (politely, never raucously) at only
the most appropriate of moments.
There's an economy to all they do
sparse movements, and if they do choose to
interrupt the music with the occasional
comment, it's always done by leaning into
the other's ear, a soft whisper responded to
only by locked eyes and a single nod. It is
this form of relationship, these couples,
whom I secretly aspire to one day join
ranks with. There's such a classed sensi-

tivity to it all, and as much as it sparks a

small note of discomfort, I can't help but be
visually enthralled by their self-possessed
manner. Such gentility! Such refinement!
Oh, to be elderly and maintain that ritual
of going out, of appreciating the multiply
layered aesthetics of sight and sound.
And so perhaps the disdainfully scoffed
reply to my roommate's teasing about my
major of choice and its social utility contains a tiny element of self-conscious

desire mixed with chagrin. There's something to be said for that sophisticated

ideal, after all.

Greg Albright 'lO had quite a different experience

with the Parrish tunnel; one that somewhat rekindled
the dreams of secrecy and mystique that, despite
Ralph Thayer and Chris Caruso's disappointing
accounts of the tunnel, I refuse to abandon. While it
seems that it's easy enough to go to the Physical Plant
and ask for a tour of the utility tunnel, it's a lot more
difficult to access it through the Parrish entrance.
Albright came close last Halloween, when, following
through with "the mundane task of retrieving [his]
laundry from the dryer in Parrish basement," he
noticed that "one of the huge, metal doors, usually
locked, was standing open."
"When I lived in Parrish," Albright said, "we liked
to explore the place. Regularly, we would play sardines, so we knew the place pretty well, but I had
never seen this door open. Needless to say, it was an
access to the steam tunnel, but alas, I had no flashI put it
light and no footwear better than flip-flops
off for another day. I try that door often, and it's
always locked." Greg Albright, you simultaneously
disappoint and revitalize my spirit with that story.

from, has a similar system of underground tunnels
that first-year students always made a mission of
breaking into and navigating during midnight hours
tunneling was patented as one of the 50 things to do
before graduating
and I thought that the Parrish
tunnel might be something just as elusively exciting.
Envisioning something akin to a dusky labyrinth
with curious looking doors and ancient pipes, and
neglecting the obvious Harry Potter reference, I imagined Swarthmore students jingling locks, manipulating doors and exploring the underground passage out
of Parrish on spooky nights, inching forward with
flashlights to find favorite spots, forgotten relics and
a convoluted network of ancient pipes. What I found,
instead, was that the Parrish tunnel is a lot less exciting than it might seem. Director of Maintenance
Ralph Thayer said it best in an e-mail: "There's not
too much to tell."
Built around 1932, the tunnel extends about 1,000
feet and runs from the Heat Plant at the bottom of the

hill tip to Parrish Hall. Although it was initially
intended to convey steam lines, electric and communication cables run through it as well. According to
Thayer, "All the steam which heats most of the buildings on the main campus comes from the heat plant
up the tunnel so it's a pretty important link."
Important, maybe, but mysterious and interesting?
No so much. The stuffof myths, this, unfortunately, is
not. I'm afraid the most exciting thing that can be said
about the Parrish tunnel is that walking through it
entails a minor, momentary risk of getting burned;
Thayer told me that the tunnel can "be walked
upright except for one short section at the Heat Plant
which has to be walked hunched over [with elbows in
to keep from being burned by a hot pipe]."
Chris Caruso 'OB, went through the tunnel on a
tour of the Physical Plant during the spring of his
sophomore year and described it as "pretty anticlimactic." Not knowing what to expect, he went in, as I
had, with a romanticized vision of an ancient passage,
imagining an intricate system of entangled pipes with
twists and bends and curves. The reality, however,
was far less exciting
the pipes were small, and the
tunnel was hot, damp and "tall people unfriendly."
Rather than the medieval flame torches my mind had
conceptualized, he described ordinary industrial

Foreign film screenings offer a variety of perspectives
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

With choices in our movie theaters stateside as bleak as
they are these days, it's a great time to be a Swarthmore student. This semester, several language departments are holding film series open to the campus community, showcasing
their distinct national and cultural narratives that have

.found their way onto celluloid.
Russian Film Series:

Having spearheaded the Russian department's film

series this semester, Professor Michael Pesenson hopes that
the film screenings will "attract interest in the Russian section [of the Modern Languages department]." The film series
kicked off Sept. 20 with "Russian Ark," the world's first single-shot movie. The film, which takes place entirely in the
Winter Palace of St. Petersberg's Hermitage Museum, was a
fitting way to start the film series. Through the kino-eye of
the film's Steadicam, which itself is a character, we anachronistically bump into various important Russian historical
figures like Catherine the Great, Tsar Nicholas II and a man

building his own coffin during the siege of Leningrad.
Pesenson saw the film as a great way for students to "get a
sense of 300 years of Russian history."
The next films in the series Pesenson promised will be
"much more straightforward and less avant-garde than
Ark"]" but "they'll still be on the profound side."
All made in 2002 to 2006, the films deal much more with
issues in contemporary Russian society. Pesenson said,
"[There's] not any particular unifying theme. It's more a sur
vey of the kind of post-Perestroika cinema."
Film screenings will be every other Thursday at 8:00 pm
in SCI 101 The next showing will be Thursday, Oct. 4 of the
film "The Return (Vozvrashchenie)" Zvyagintsev, 2003.
Cine contemperaneo espanol:

Pedros said that Almodovar's films mark a chasm
between two approaches to the problem of"how to deal with
the trauma of the dictatorship." Many films have attempted
to dissect the history and the memory of the nation's warravaged past by immersing themselves in what Pedros
describes as "some kind of social realism and some very
social concern and very leftist ideology."
On the other hand, there are filmmakers like Almodovar
who, Pedros said, "decided to say, '4O years of our history is
enough, and they took enough from us, and I do not want to
deal my cinema with Franco. I want to make a cinema like
he has never existed
to look to the future.'"
Film screenings will be Mondays and Wednesdays at 7:30
pm in Kohlberg 334. The next showing will be Wednesday,
Sept. 27 of the film "Ay, Carmela!" Carlos Saura (1990).
Cinema de la ville:
Professor Carina Yervasi teaches this French class that is

of scholarship out there about the rise of the modern urban

and the development of cinema...l thought I'd tap into some
of the work in French that talks about cities and their cinematic representations from early cinema to the present."
French cinema has had a close connection to American
cinema, from to the poetic realism that spurred film noir and
gave the genre its namesake to the French New Wave that

devoted entirely to "city films." As to what brings "cinema"
and "cities" together, Yervasi said in an email, "There's a lot

was highly influential to films from the New Hollywood
Movement like "Easy Rider." French films have also shown
themselves to be equally smitten with American cinema.
Cervasi said, "When we saw 'Les demoiselles de Rochefort,'
which is a musical, we looked at a series of Gene Kelly films
from the U.S. to talk about the ways in which Jacques Demy
was influenced by the musical of Stanley Donen and Gene
Kelly, particularly how they represent the city."
Film screenings will be on Wednesdays at 6:00 pm in the
McCabe Video Room and SCI 199. The next showing will be
on Wednesday, Oct. 3 of the films "Borom Sarret" (1962) and

focus
is more on the issues of identity as portrayed in
movies...be that either national identity, gender identity or
sexual identity and how issues of identity as a group are
questioned or ignored."
The class's screenings will include some of the country's
most seminal landmarks. Of them, "Viridiana" by Luis
Bunuel, considered blasphemous in its time for the cruelty
inflicted on its saintly title character merely because of her
gender, was banned by Franco's government but nonethe-

Senorita," which touches upon issues of transgenderism and
was made during Spain's transition to democracy, and "La
Ley del Deseo" by Pedro Almodovar.

German Cinema:

Professor Sunka Simon teaches the course that surveys
Germany's hundred plus years of film history. Simon said, "I
pick one more avant-garde or experimental piece against

one popular box-office success because I find that Americans
know less about the box-office successes than they do about
the avant-garde films."
Of the film screenings, Simon made mention of a socialist musical called "Hot Summer." "It's really hilarious,"
Simon said. "If you have an idea of socialism, it's definitely
one. It's something to check out." The screenings will end
with last year's best foreign film Oscar winner, "The Lives
of Others."
Film screenings will be every Wednesday at 7:00 pm in
SCI 199. The next showing will be on Wednesday, Oct. 1 of the
film "Irgendwo in Berlin/Somewhere in Berlin" (Gerhard
Lamprecht, 1946).

in Little Rock,
Arkansas, following several tense weeks during which staunch segregationist Governor Orval Faubus used the
Arkansas National Guard to block Supreme
Court-ordered integration. Ultimately,
President Dwight Eisenhower was forced to
federalize the entire Arkansas National
Guard in order to permit the students to
enter the school safely.
You would hope that, fifty years later,
things would have changed dramatically.
Unfortunately, you would be wrong.
A few months ago, the city of Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, announced a plan to rezone the
city's school districts, largely due to complaints by Caucasian parents that certain
schools were becoming overcrowded. This
rezoning plan, which took effect for the
school year beginning this fall, resulted in
almost exclusively African-American students being forced to change schools. Many
of them were sent to significantly lower-perAfricanforming and predominantly
American schools. The parents of these students, who have been fighting this move,
have called it by its proper term: resegregation.
Although it ruled in 1954 in Brown v.
Board of Board of Education of Topeka that
separate schools for different races are fundamentally unequal and illegal, the
Supreme Court has had a disturbing trend
of issuing rulings that effectively permit
segregation. In 1974, in Milliken v. Bradley,
the Supreme Court ruled that attempts to
desegregate the Detroit public school system by busing students to different districts
within the city are unconstitutional. The
majority opinion in the case held that such
a plan is only permissible if there is evidence that every single district involved
has engaged in a recognizable pattern of
racial discrimination. This was not only a
retreat from Brown v. Board of Education,
but a retreat from the 1896 decision Plessy v.
Ferguson, which found that racially segregated facilities are constitutional as long as
they are of comparable quality. That decision, deplorable as it was, at least held that
separate facilities should be equal. Milliken
v. Bradley essentially legitimized a doctrine
of "separate and unequal."
The result of Milliken is that school districts are forbidden from taking steps to
integrate and send minority students to
higher-performing schools. Thus, according
to the Supreme Court, it is constitutionally
acceptable to have racially homogeneous
schools that are not equal in quality. Justice
William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in the case, stated as much: "Today's
decision... means that there is no violation
of the Equal Protection Clause though the
schools are segregated by race and though
the black schools are not only 'separate' but
'inferior.' So far as equal protection is con-

cerned, we are now in a dramatic retreat
from the 7-to-l decision in 1896 that blacks
could be segregated in public facilities, provided they received equal treatment."

The Supreme Court has had
a disturbing trend of issuing
rulings that effectively
permit segregation.
Milliken v. Bradley essentially provided
a legal justification for the phenomenon of
"white flight," whereby affluent Caucasians
move from cities to racially homogenous
suburbs. According to the Supreme Court,
as long as these suburbs had not directly

discriminated against anyone actually living within their boundaries, they would be
protected from having to accept AfricanAmerican students who could not afford to
live in the towns themselves. Economic segregation replaced legal segregation. The
result of this is that, according to many
studies, schools are nearly as racially-segregated today as they were in the 1950'5.
More than thirty years after Milliken,
Detroit has the most segregated school system in the country. According to a study
conducted by the Detroit News in 2004, just
five out of the Detroit area's seventy-one
school districts educate 81% of the area's
African-American students. Eight out of 10
Caucasian

students attend schools that are

approximately 3% African-American, while
eight out of 10 African-American students
attend schools that are approximately 4%
Caucasian. These numbers are, to put it
bluntly, appalling.
Sadly, it does not appear that the
Supreme Court is likely to overrule any of
these decisions anytime soon. Earlier this
year, in Parents Involved in Community
Schools v. Seattle School District No. X the
Court ruled against plans to reorganize the
school districts of Seattle, WA and
Louisville, KY, in order to achieve greater

racial integration. In a dissenting opinion,
Justice Stephen Breyer said that "to invalidate the plans under review is to threaten
the promise of Brown." Justice John Paul
Stevens declared that "it is my firm conviction that no member of the Court that I
joined in 1975 would have agreed with
today's decision."
On the bright side, parents and students
affected by the Tuscaloosa rezoning appear
to have found a partial solution to their
problem. Under the No Child Left Behind
Act, it is illegal to move students from higher to lower-performing schools, so students
affected by the rezoning are entitled to
request to be moved back to their original
schools. It would be a great irony if these
students were able to utilize an education
bill passed by a right-wing Congress in
order to overcome the effects of heinous
decisions by a right-wing Supreme Court.
But Supreme Court decisions have made it
clear that part of the American right would
like nothing more than to resegregate
schools and to overturn all of the progress
that we've made towards racially-integrated
education in the fifty years since the Little

Congress needs to strive for balanced government

dent and his administration told Congress his plan
to invade another country. Then, Congress agreed to support
the attack. As of yet, the U.S. government has not improved
the world or increased the safety of American civilians
both initial grounds for declaring war in the first place.
The Iraq war seems unjustified. The main goal of the war
was to revoke nuclear weapons from Saddam Hussein (with-

out leaving Iraq destabilized), which could not possibly be
accomplished because Hussein did not have the weapons.
Thus, the U.S. failed to accomplish their military objective.
The total death toll there as of last weekend is 135,353, and
the Department of Defense confirmed that 3,792 of those
deaths were Americans. The war has cost, to date, about $454

billion.

Congress supported the Iraq war because most of its
members feared being blamed for the inevitablefailure that
the war would have been without Congressional support. On
Aug. 26,2Q03, White House lawyers stated that, in their opinion, the Bush administration could attack Iraq without congressional approval. The same day, several Congressmen
voiced their support for the attack. Yes, the Bush administration believed that Saddam Hussein planned to assail the
U.S. and that he had nuclear weapons. However, one would
like to think that the majority of those in Congress did not
want to start a war in Iraq without substantial evidence of a
nuclear threat.

There was also another reason why Congress sanctioned
the war. The laws thatdivide jurisdiction over wars between
the legislative and executive branch added confusion to the
situation that Congress faced in 2003. The War Powers Act of
1973 states that the president may not deploy U.S. troops in
combat for more than two months without congressional
approval. So, if the Bush administrationattacked Iraq without congressional support, then the U.S. troops would have
to enter Iraq, overthrow Hussein, and then return to
America in two months. At that point, the U.S. Army would
leave Iraq without a government or stability to its fate of a
civil war. Then the Bush administration would blame the
Iraq fiasco on Congress.
The current argument addressing Iran is reminiscent of
the debates over Iraq when Congress agreed to fund the
Operation Iraqi Freedom. For instance, some fear that
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran plans to attack Israel or the
U.S. with nuclear weapons. According to the Congressional
record from last May, the Bush administration authorized
the CIA "to mount a covert 'black' operation to destabilize
the Iranian government." The Ahmadinejad administration
has cause to despise the U.S. for this reason. It similarly has
cause to despise Israel for historical reasons because of the
warfare between ethnic groups in the Middle East.
Furthermore, Ahmadinejad is actually building nuclear
power plants. Many fear that his administration poses a
threat to the West.
Some say that their fears of Ahmadinejad are strong
enough for their countries to invade Iran and to overthrow
Ahmadinejad's government. For instance, French Foreign
Minister Bernard Kouchner now warns that France will
attack Iran if Ahmadinejad does not abandon building
nuclear energy plants.
While it seems reasonable of Kouchner to fear the man
who allegedly wants to burn Israel, it is unreasonable to fear
him to such an extent as to sacrificecivilians in his country
for the sake of uncertain war aims. It is questionable
whether the Ahmadinejad administration plans to attack
Israel or the U.S. with nuclear weapons. It is difficult for

It is encouraging to hear

U.S. Admiral William
Fallon say that he does not
foresee a war with Iran. At
the same time, it would be
better to have, in addition
to this, an assurance from
the U.S. Congress that it
will not fund another
unnecessary war. I am saying 'another" because wars
in Korea, Vietnam, and
Iraq fall under my definition of unnecessary wars.
They also followed a similar pattern. First, the presi-

U.S. Congressmen to distance themselves from their fears
thatAhmadinejad may invade another country. It is also difficult for them to overcome their fears that if the Bush
administration decides to invade Iran, then Congress would

goodman

have to either sanction the invasion or take the blame for a
possible future failed war strategy. The U.S. Congress should
not be willing to approve the funding for any war that the
executive proposes just because the president can present
the invasion as fait accompli. Congress should take a more
proactive role in controlling what wars the U.S. starts.

The current argument addressing
Iran is reminiscent of the debates

over Iraq.
Congress can take action to limit the powers of the executive branch by passing legislature that would include a list
of reasonable causes for starting wars. Some wars clearly
should be sanctioned. If a country strikes a U.S. territory,
then Congress should approve funding for the war. Also, if a
member of NATO gets attacked by another country and
requests that the U.S. also declare war on the offender, then
the Congress should also support the war. If Congress takes
a more proactive role in thinking about which wars it
should fund, then those in our legislature will be more successful at distancing themselves from their irrational feel-

ings of fears.

On the other hand, the list of approved wars should not
include those based on mere suspicion. For example, if
Iranian government chooses to build nuclear energy plants
against the requests of the West, this should not cause the
West to invade Iran..
It would be truly unfortunate if the majority ofU.S. congressmen genuinely wanted to invade Iran. That would
demonstrate that they do not consider the wars in Korea,
Vietnam and Iraq as unnecessary. It would also show that
they are willing to pay with American lives and taxpayers’
money for nebulous objectives. It would be as if they said
that it’s okay to kill Americans and Iranians and to bring
more suffering, hatred and destruction to the world in

Plea for democratic press
To the editor:

We write you today as students for a

democratic media.
A democratic media does not privilege
voices of certain identities over others.
A democratic media allows organizations to choose their own spokespeople.
A democratic media interviews to understand, not to corner or to frame.

As members of various political and/or
cultural groups on campus, we have all
noticed and personally experienced violations of the above tenets. While we under-

stand the time constraints that are consis-

tently cited to excuse misrepresentation in
the press, democratic practice should not be
sacrificed to accommodate a crowded schedule or an impending deadline.
A democratic media should strive above
all to clarify, explicate and to accurately
represent its subjects. Media at its best is
informing to the public, interesting to its
readers and fair to the voices it claims to

cover.

than any other time in my three-plus
years here.

The entire week of events was a portrayal of strength and resolve that will
never be given its full justice. The hours
that the organizers put into each event,
on top of the incredibly emotional toll
that the project took, are a true display
of the hope
that each of us seems to
that a few dedicated indihold on to
viduals really can make a difference.
Because they do. All of the individuals
who had the courage to put their experience on a shirt for the world to see or
who had the awe-inspiring guts to stand
up in front of a crowd of 100 people and
tell their story make a difference. The
Clothesline Project should incite outrage in all of us that sexual violence still
occurs in our society and at such a high
rate, much less on a campus that so

September 27, 2007

many of us consider as a safe, welcoming place. It is only from the stories of
the resilient men and women who are
able to stand up and tell the world that
this happened to them, it is still happening and it is not okay, that we can ever

hope to create a community that is completely intolerant of sexual violence of
any kind.
But the stories told by survivors are,

more than anything, stories that show
us just what we as individuals can withstand and still go on living and, even,
thriving. The individuals I know who
are survivors are, and always will be,
some of the people that I look up to most
in my life. They are the ones who get up
every morning when they once thought
they could not, who are forced to pass
people on the street who make them
think of their attackers and keep on
walking, who have had to fight to feel
whole again and overcome a physical
and emotional trauma that goes beyond
what the rest of society will ever be able
to imagine. And they still go on living in

a society that has let them down, that
has taken something from them that
they will never get back. Because of that,
because you shared your story with me
and with the rest of your peers, because
you are still here fighting to make things
better for yourself and for all individuals
who may ever find themselves in your
place, thank you. Your strength may be
the reason someone else is able to get

themselves out of bed in the morning,
and hopefully with enough voices we
can change the way our culture views
sexual violence once and for all.

Congratulations,

concerned citizens! The
Jena 6 are now definitively on the national
radar. I can just see the
Leno monologue now.
Well, almost —I'm no
Leno, and I don't think
it's the best comedic
material anyways, so

YOSHI JOHNSON

Yo, It's Not That Deep

my imagination is a bit
fuzzy on how the jokes
would go. The point is,
though, that the controversy surrounding the
Jena 6 has captured the
nation's attention and,
even on this campus,
we've seen some action

around the case. It is after all the newest craze, and hence
the latest cause to gain a "Buy" rating on the activist marketplace. Or so suggests the proliferation of the phrase
"Free the Jena 6" on my Facebook Newsfeed in the past
week.
But let me rein in the sarcasm, since all of this attention
is definitely not a bad thing. For many people, the facts of
the case hint that racism is at play, and without delving too
much into details
that's what Wikipedia is for
more
comprehensive investigation of the situation does suggest
that racism figured into, if nothing else, at least the juridical
execution of this case. The plight of the Jena 6 warrants the
type of critical examination it is now getting, and with the

intensity of national scrutiny and assured reality, we can
now thankfully rule out the possibility of further egregious
miscarriages of justice. (Knock on wood.)
I get a little more cynical, though, when I think about this
case within the context of the larger anti-racism work. Sure,
at first I marvel at how readily we've all received this newest
rallying cry around the issue of racism at Swarthmore and
around the country. We take the futures of these six young
men very seriously, not only out of sympathy for them, but

more generally, with a larger understanding of what their
case says about this country's progress in race relations.

Thinking about the events after Hurricane Katrina and
the Gulf Coast devastation that occurred just two years
ago, however, I begin to see that as individuals and as a
society, we tend to respond predictably when persistent
and systemic racism manifests itself. I recall, for
instance, the deluge of headlines over the past two years,
dare I
which trumpets the stupendous incompetence
say, apathy
demonstrated at all levels of government in
their reconstruction efforts. I remind myself that the devastation continues, with more than 226,000 people still in
temporary housing or otherwise displaced. And then I
remember the anger and helplessness we felt while viewing all of the images we couldn't believe were of an
American city.

A collective amnesia, born of
necessity, took hold of our national
consciousness, that we might
successfully avoid the unpleasant
contradictions in our daily lives.
I remember these things, and then I realize how we
have gradually proceeded to forget them. Sure, we
responded at first. Here at Swat, for instance, we held vigils and days of solidarity, organized fundraisers and trips
and opened our doors to displaced students. (There are
those who are active still in important efforts to remedy
the situation, let it be noted.) But in the midst of a violent
rupture of the status quo and faced with deep and insidious problems we'd come to normalize and institutionalize,
we found ourselves ill-disposed to the moral task at hand.
There was no fashion accessory we could affix to our backpack, no rally or vigil we could hold and no amount of
money we could mail off to the Red Cross that would make
things get better quickly.
When a question weighs heavily upon us, we must
assuage our conscience; in this rat race of a world, to be
paralyzed by moral crises is decidedly inconvenient. What

we need when faced with these sorts of dilemmas is a
band-aid solution, something to ease our hearts and minds
so we can get back to going about our business. But in the
aftermath of Katrina, unlike in the Jena 6 situation, there
was no neatly framed, easily addressable problem, and
neither did it lend itself to a straightforward quick fix.
Faced with such a predicament, what did we do to ease
our troubled hearts? We did as we always do, reconciling
our moral paralysis the only way we could with any sort
of expediency: we collectively forgot.
Tracing the progression of our collective consciousness
after Katrina, though, I know I'd be doing myself a favor if
I checked my self-congratulatory optimism at the door. If
ever we were to be incited to a chorus of solidarity in the
hopes of meaningful change, it was at that time, and yet
where there should have been crescendo there was only
silence. A collective amnesia, born of necessity, took hold
of our national consciousness, that we might successfully
avoid the unpleasant contradictions in our daily lives.
While this piece is not a moral indictment, it is a qualification of sorts. Regardless of your interpretations of the
Jena 6 story's nuances
it is not, after all, a completely
cut and dry case there is racism at play. It is significant,
however, that the anti-racist rallying cry this timearound
only requires us to rectify the injustices of a single court
case. For a proverbial scratch we have the proverbial
band-aid. In another recent iteration of the cause, we were
required to demand that CBS remove a well-known bigot

from their payroll. Again, neat problems, neat solutions.
In the case of Katrina, however, we found ourselves in
a moral crisis that we have buried and tried to forget, but
failed to resolve. To be sure, the disappointment of that
sea-change unrealized is still too bitter for some of us to
stomach. Before hoisting the banner for anti-racist social

change, we would do well to distinguish between the limited scope of cases like that of the Jena 6 and the deep-rooted structural problems that plague our soqiety. Indeed,
when wrestling with issues of racism, we would all do well
to remind ourselves of how quickly moral imperatives dissipate after they have been shown to be inconvenient for
our lifestyle choices.

stolen the network's primetime slots represent not just a dangerous assault on
healthy debate, but a disturbing slide
toward a false ideal of "real talk" that is all
too close to eclipsing news journalism
(that is, factual and thoughtful reporting)
as we know it.
"Real talk," or at least the brand of it
promoted on Headline News and its many
counterparts, is not the truth. It's not even

Grace joined CNN Headline News in 2005,

rivals on MSNBC and FOX News (equally
demagogic blowhards who, it is prudent to
note, might as well be lumped together
with Grace and Beck), but they all remain
on the air, endangering basic journalistic
integrity with each show.

Neither Grace nor Beck is a journalist,
or claims to be. The former is a legal analyst with experience as a (Supreme Court
reprimanded) violent crimes prosecutor;
the latter is a radio deejay and commentator. Both draw on tough backgrounds—
Grace's fiancee was murdered when she
was 19; Beck was a substance abuser and
alcoholic—to reinforce their "real talk"
personas.
In just two years, their histories of onair behavior have already become unconscionable, due in large part to the free rein

they afford themselves as "commentators"

Jimmy Carter as a "waste of skin," loudly
suspected of an allegiance between Barack

extolled the despicable tasering of a
University of Florida student as "Shock

Grace, for her part, famously drove an
interviewee to suicide and proclaimed the
Duke lacrosse team (not to mention dozens
of other defendants) guilty before trial proceedings even began. They're loud, obnoxious, and singularly reliant on how offensive they can be. But their appearance on a
self-described news network gives them an
undeserved air of legitimacy.
Much is made of "real talk" these
days—supposedly, that quintessential
American gift that blessed our forefathers
from Patrick Henry to Andrew Jackson to
Teddy Roosevelt, that noble breach of political correctness that only the bravest dare
make. Speaking out is a rightly admired
thing, particularly in an admittedly sensitive time like today. But those who prefer

the news networks' definition of "real talk"
to civil discourse most likely confuse formality with complexity. Political correctness—something wicked in its own right—impedes and aggravates discourse with its
emphases on neutrality and formality.
Valuable discussion, however, respects
(even worships) the complexity of issues,
not for want of boldness, but out of a desire
to know the truth.

"Real talk," or at least the
brand of it promoted on

is not
the truth. It's not even a

That desire sets today's "commentators" apart from journalists, and the disproportionate number of the former versus

with CNN Headline News. Television news
is in desperate need of a hard-searching—-

Wells leads volleyball turnaround
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

What a difference a weekend can make. After

losing four straight matches, including most
recently in its conference opener against
Dickinson, the volleyball team got a boost of energy
at the Blue Jay Classic, finishing 2-2 and showing
considerable improvement in its level of play.
At the Classic, hosted by Elizabethtown College,
the Garnet lost to top-notch programs from the host
school (21-30, 23-30, 23-30) and St. Mary's CoUege of
Maryland (18-30, 23-30, 30-22, 30-17, 10-15), but gave
the previously 12-1 Seahawks a run for their money.
Swarthmore took St. Mary's to five games behind
solid hitting from Vanessa Wells 'OB, Jen Wang 'O9

and Katherine Gold 'OB.
"We were really ready to play," Coach Harleigh
Leach said of the match against the Seahawks. "We
really stepped it up. It's unfortunate we didn't win
that match, but it was a great effort." Wang and
Johanna Bond 'lO each had three service aces for
the Garnet in the match, and Erin Heaney 'O9 and
Monica Joshi 10 anchored the defensive effort,

with 25 and 16 digs, respectively. Karen Berk 'OB
assumed her usual dominating presence at the net,
registering eight blocks.
"For the first time this season, I felt like everything was clicking," Wells said of the tournament.
"We played four matches and there was never a
point where I felt like we had taken a dive."
The team effort was evident both in the play of
the squad and in its emotional presence. And
unlike in previous tournaments where the Garnet
has shown glimpses of its full capability but struggled to finish games, Swarthmore silenced doubters
with wins over Wilkes College (30-16, 30-20, 30-26)
and Neumann College (30-20, 28-30, 30-24,19-30,15-8)
to finish both Friday and Saturday play on a high
note. The win against the Knights was especially
sweet, serving as revenge for the loss that
Neumann inflicted on the Garnet at theirlast meeting in Tarble Pavilion on Sept. 8. It was all the more

impressive considering that Swarthmore had to do
without Gold, one of the team's two captains, who
left Elizabethtown early. In her place, Wells stepped
up with 15 kills, and Wang provided a strong contribution with 13 ofher own. Bond had five service
aces against Neumann, and was second in digs on
the team with 19 to Heaney's 26.
According to Wells, part of the key to the
Garnet's success was just learning to relax. Leach
told the team during the tournament to "just go out
there and stop thinking," and that message really
seemed to resonate with her players. "It's refreshing," Wells said. "What a lot of Swat athletics teams
deal with is that fact that Swatties think too much."
The victory over the Knights was the first match
that has gone to four or five games that
Swarthmore has won this season, and the Garnet
will need to continue finishing well if it hopes to be
successful in a string of upcoming matches against
conference foes.

"This weekend was a huge turning point for our
team," Berk said. "We really started playing more
consistently
People are a lot more positive."
"We're at the halfway point of our season,"
Leach said. "We're physically and mentally and volwe just now need to
leyball-skilled prepared
approach every game as it comes. If we have our
mental game there our physical game follows and
we'll be where we want to be."
Last night, Swarthmore hosted its annual faculty and staff appreciation night with a home game
against Washington College. The Garnet will continue its conference schedule with away matches at
McDaniel College on Sept. 29 and Bryn Mawr
College on Oct. 4 before hosting Johns Hopkins on
Oct. 6, a day that the Swat women hope will go
down in history for their team as they attempt to

break the Tarble Pavilion attendance record for a
volleyball match. That day, the Garnet will be raising money as part of the "Digging For A Cure" campaign to raise money for the fight against breast

the Herculean figure, the "toughest out in

greatest, purest right-handed hitters in the

BEN CRONIN

Station To Station
Four score and seven months ago,
Anthony Nomar Garciaparra held the baseball world in the palm of his TPX-gloved
hand. As the 2000 MLB season's third
month drew to a close, the newly-branded
New England folk hero had just completed
his season's 31st multi-hit game, vaulting
his already league-leading average into a
stratosphere rarely visited in modern baseball. He was hitting .396, with an OPS (onbase plus slugging) of L062 and a bat that
seemed virtually incapable of missing the
ball (league-fewest 24 strikeouts going into
the All-Star break). In late July, his average
wouldreach yet loftier heights (.403) before

a less eye-popping, though
decisively league-leading, .372 by the year's
end. At that point, he was a career .333 hitter, and the monotonic season-by-season

returning to

history of the game. Five years after his
eventual retirement, Red Sox Nation would
surely toast to his unanimous induction
into Cooperstown.
But something went wrong. As said
cover of Sports Illustrated attests, Nomar
had undergone a physical transformation

over the winter of 2000-OL Be it a result of

his unabashed obsessive-compulsive, per-

fectionist tendencies (like the immutable
batting-glove at-bat routine) or a
Bondsian, "Me too!" impulse to hop on the
all-consuming turn-of-the-century home-

run bandwagon, he reported to spring
training with some 30+ additional pounds
of muscle. Whether or not steroids were
involved is hardly debatable (if the circumstantial evidence isn't convincing
enough, one need only hear his self-consciously enraged replies to the suggestion).

Before long, Nomar's fascial system,
more than capable of catering to the
demands of a once slender, 155-pound frame,
began to crumble beneath its new, unnaturally produced 'enhancements." The very

same month he was enshrined on the front
of America's most widely-read sports periodical, he awoke one morning to find an
unusually nagging discomfort in his right

wrist. A series ofmedical evaluations quickly concluded that the condition
whatever
it was
required invasive surgery, and the

laborious rehabilitation that ensued limited
him to a mere 21 games of the season. While
he was supposed be taking home his third
straight batting title, while he was expected
to be leading a retooled Red Sox offense to

long-awaited glory, Nomar languished helplessly in the clubhouse, in the dugout and in
physical therapy. He enjoyed a fleetingly
successful cameo in mid-season (2-for-4 with
a homerun and 3 RBl's in his first game
back), but the good times were painfully
short-lived. The wrist forced him to the sideline again in late August, and kept him there

for the remainder of the year.
As it turned out, this was the beginning

of the end for Nomar. True, he only missed
12 games total of the 2002 and 2003 seasons,

and his
numbers were actually
respectable, but, visibly in pain at the
plate, he was nowhere near the same hitter as before. In 2004, a mysterious

Achilles' tendon ailment left him on the
shelf until mid-June. After being dismissed to Chicago's north side at the trade
deadline that season, the wrist discomfort
of old visited him once again. And his
groin muscle tore away from his femur in
April 2005. Along the way, Nomar's numbers plummeted (for example, an OBP of
.320 in 62 games for the Cubs that season),
and although he enjoyed a excitingly productive first half of 2006 as first baseman
for the Dodgers (.358 BA), oblique strains
and knee injuries down the stretch killed
hopes of a full return to his former self.
This season, miscellaneous
similar
injuries have turned him into a number

seven hitter in a mediocre lineup, into
what one online sports commentator
dubbed a "$5 player at best." Cooperstown
is but a distant memory.
By virtue of timing and common sense,
it seems safe to assume that Nomar's protracted collapse has stemmed from the
muscular fortification of 2000-01, and in
particular from consumption of some performance enhancing drug(s). If this is
indeed the case, one may argue that he has
only himself to blame. Like most steroid
users, he should'veknown the risks beforehand and made the opposite, more intelligent decision. But also like most steroid
users, he probably assumed that shortterm performance benefits would outweigh
long-term costs. Unfortunately for Nomar,
no benefits ever quite materialized on the
field; unlike Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, etc.,
Garciaparra enjoyed no spike in production (as if he needed one!), no world
records, with his new, "enhanced" body.
In the end, then (apologies for mundane
preachiness), his story should serve as an
example for the sports community. For in
fact, many if not most indulgers in HGH,
"The Clear" and their ilk, have shared
Nomar's categorically disastrous fate. The
purported immediate returns of steroids
remain anything but certain; the long-term
price is unavoidable. Hopefully, as this
becomes increasingly apparent, steroids
will autonomously recede into obsolescence. But in the meantime, Bud Selig and
his cronies should more strictly protect the
future Nomar Garciaparras from themselves.

Last Thursday, the men's and women's cross country teams ran their first competitive races of the season
at Haverford College. Both teams ran separate races,
competing against close competitors such as Villanova
University, Haverford College, The College of New
Widener University.
A tight-knit pack of runners on the men's team ran
the race with their strides seemingly in-sync. The group
was led by Ross Weller 'OB, who completed the four-mile
race in 21:2010, coming in 38th place out of 100 runners.
Following less than a second behind Weller was
Jonathan Tompkins 'lO at -21:20.60, placing 40th in the
men's race. Still in the tight pack of Swatties and placing 43rd, was Erik Saka 'O9, who finished with a time of
21:26.20. Other top runners included Jon Shoop 'OB and
Micky Katz 'OB, who placed 45th and 50th with times of

Worms play through injuries
BY ZHENG ZHENG

zzhengl@swarthmore.edu

This past weekend's tournament, held at Rutgers
University, was a signature event for the Swarthmore
men's Ultimate Frisbee Team. The event fostered team
chemistry and provided an excellent opportunity for new
members of the team to acquire invaluable game experiences. The Earthworms placed 11th out of 16 teams, losing
four games to the University of Maryland, Messiah
College, Columbia University and Rutgers University on
Saturday, but winning two of three on Sunday, hanging
close with New York University before falling 10-9.
Despite the team's less-than-stellar win-loss record of 25, the tournament was a triumph in many other important
aspects. Since an alarming number of the veteran players
were injured, including two of the three Earthworms captains, the competing team at this particular tournament
consisted mostly of rookies, who were able to learn a great

deal.
"We have a super team this year, including a group of
younger players that give our team the heart that complements the wisdom of the veterans," Seth Donoughe said.
Patrick Lindsey 'OB agreed. "Everyone showed noticeable improvement through the course of the weekend," he
said. "Although the immediate results were perhaps not
as satisfying as we would have liked, the experience
gained will have many long-term benefits." Of course, the
score cannot account for everything. The good times team
members share off the field are equally essential to the
overall well-being of the squad. "Really, there's nothing
that brings people together more than playing ultimate all
day, overwhelming a tiny corner fried chicken restaurant
at midnight and then hanging out in an overcrowded motel
room," Lindsey said.

THE PHOENIX

Ultimate Frisbee practices are held three days a week
and are led by "the three Matts," captains Matt Kaminski
all
'OB, Matt Fisher 'OB and Matt Conan 'OB. That's right
three captains are named Matt.
The size of the Earthworms squad fluctuates from time
to time. On the first day of practice, approximately forty
enthused Frisbee players showed up. However, only about
fifteen players went to the tournament this past weekend.
Practices often entail a systemic series of drills. Usually,
the players start off by throwing Frisbees in pairs. This is
an especially suitable way for new players to become
acquainted with the fundamentals of the sport. Next, the
players would jog to warm up, and the team will be divided into different groups in order to perfect specific strategies such as offense, defense and zone defense strategies.
Fall season practices tend to be more relaxed. Players
focus primarily on acquiring fundamental skills of the
sport. During the second semester however, things will
undoubtedly intensify as the team starts to prepare for
the championship season, especially the Division 111
National Ultimate Frisbee Tournament in May. The team
garnered an impressive second place two years ago at the
National competition. Last year, the team proceeded to
National once again, and placed fifth in the country.
According to Kaminski, the team is currently gearing up
for the upcoming Snakefarm Classic Tournament at
Virginia Commonwealth University, which will take
place this weekend. Other prospective tournaments
include Haverween at Haverford and Padamosh in
Philadelphia. Of course, as with any competitive sport,
there's always the pressure to win, but for the
Earthworms, winning is not the sole purpose. "What really drew me to the sport was not the competition, but the
prospect of playing with a group of really interesting and

Leading the Swarthmore women's team was Emma
Stanley 'O9, who finished sixth out of sixty-five runners
over the three-mile course in 18:42.60. Following her
lead from the women's team was Ashley Davies 'lO, who
a 13th
finished with a time of 19:05.90, landing her
place finish. The third Swat woman to finish the race,
and finishing 17th overall was first-year Caitlin Russell,
who crossed the line at 19:1510. More top Swat women
runners, who placed 28th and 29th, were Kathy Feeney
'O9 (19:34.90) and Lauren DeLuca 'lO (19:37.50).
Having much familiarity with the Haverford cross
country course, this was a great place to officially open
the 2007 season.
"The weather was nice, not too hot or humid,"
Tompkins said. "We went out controlled and ran the
race that we wanted to." Having been training all summer, and beginning team practices at the end of August,
there is no doubt that the runners are in top condition

for an excellent season.
"It's pretty early in the season, so we haven't had
any major injuries, just the common soreness and
fatigue that come with hard work," Stanley said. "It's
still better to treat injuries early rather than waiting
until they get worse."
This Friday, the squads will have the opportunity to
see how they measure-up against more teams from
other schools in the Paul Short Invite, hosted by Lehigh
University.

"The course at Lehigh has more hills than
Haverford, which we can work to our advantage since
we've been doing lots of hill workouts," Stanley said.
"It's better than a flat course like Haverford, which may
seem like an all-out sprint race."
"Lehigh is a good place to get a personal record,"
Tompkins said. "We've been training hard, running
about 70 to 80 miles per week. Hopefully our hard work
will pay off."

board gleams with two Premier

titles, not to mention the additional FA cup, Community
Shield and League Cup titles. Mourinho, hate him or love him, is
a born champion. So why did he leave?
Enter Roman Abramovich. Roman Abramovich, Russian oil billionaire with a net worth of over $lB billion, purchased Chelsea FC
in June, 2003. He set the stage for Mourinho's arrival, investing 440
million quid in the club, most of which was spent on transfer fees
luring players to West London. With such unprecedented financial
backing, Mourinho began purchasing a host of players, including
Didier Drogba, Mateja Kezman, "Cashley" Cole and Ricardo
Carvalho, starting a new chapter in the Chelsea history books.
With a touch of Portuguese tactical expertise, Chelsea quickly
began to dominate the English Premier League, winning back-toback titles in 2005 and 2006. All roads were leading towards Rome.
Only one prize eluded Abramovich's grasp, the Champions League
title. With it, he could forever claim in a place in the hearts of
Chelsea fans worldwide.
Problems arose in the 2006-2007 campaign, first in the form of
injuries to key players such as Captain John Terry and talismanic goalkeeper Petr Cech, and later due to friction caused by superstar egos, cough Shevchenko, Ballack, cough. Abramovich's
unquenchable thirst for success led him to purchase Ukrainian
phenomenon Andrei Shevchenko and German captain Michael
Ballack in the previous summer transfer window, a move that
Mourinho never initially requested. The two superstars grossly
underperformed in their debut season, much to the frustration Of
Mourinho. It is no secret that "The Special One" is keen on players with big hearts, embodied in the lung-busting runs made by
Didier Drogba, or the all-action defensive displays given by John
Terry. Neither Shevchenko nor Ballack have displayed such
heart, yet reports emerging from West London claimed that
Abramovich demanded a starting place for the former. The
Mourinho-Abramovich feud begins.

Danielle Tocchet dribbles upfield during Swarthmore's win over Washington College on Tuesday night.

Garnet continues to roll
BY CONOR CASEY
ccasey2@swarthmore.edu
In a one-sided offensive onslaught Tuesday night
at home, the women's soccer team (6-0, 2-0 CC)
destroyed the Washington College Shorewomen (09, 0-3 CC) 4-0, out-shooting them in the game by a
margin of 42-L
The Garnet struck early and often Tuesday night.
Barely three minutes into the game, midfielder Julia
Luongo 'lO found co-captain forward Danielle
Tocchet 'OB in front of the Washington goal, and
Tocchet headed in Luongo's lob to get Swarthmore on
the board. Swarthmore would get off another 26 shots
in the first half, none of which, however, found the
back of the net. Washington goalie Megan Russell
made an astounding 11 saves in the half, despite not

offensive support from her fellow
Shorewomen, who didn't manage to get off a single
shot in the first 45 minutes.
Although the scoreboard may not have reflected
it, the Garnet women came into the second half with
the clear advantage, having so thoroughly dominated
the ball in the game's first half. Once again, it did not
take long for the Garnet to hit its stride, as forward
Katie Kanuka 'lO, who along with defender Eileen
Earl 'lO returned last night from an injury, headed in
a cross from teammate Kirsten Peterson 'll seven
and a half minutes into the second half. Three minutes later, Kanuka again found the back of the net,
this time off an assist from Megan Colombo 'll, the
Garnet's points leader. Then, barely five minutes
later, Colombo notched her own goal, dribbling
around a Washington defender after a corner kick.
The shutout, which was the fifth for the Garnet
this year, was never really challenged. Garnet goalie
Lauren Walker 'O9 did not have to make a single save
on the night, which might explain the fact that while
Swarthmore has the best goals-against average in the
conference, and Walker's save percentage is the second best in the conference (she has only given up one
getting any

20

goal all year), Swarthmore is last in saves in the conference. Opponents simply do not get many shots on
goal, thanks to the Garnet's stellar defense.
Prior to the game, the Garnet's national Division
111ranking, according to the National Soccer Coaches
of America poll, improved from 23rd to 19th. In the
Mid-Atlantic region, Swarthmore is ranked behind
only Messiah College and College of New Jersey, who
have national rankings of two and three, respectively. With last night's shutout victory of Washington
College, the Garnet probably improved their ranking
further.
"Hopefully it will mean a better ranking in the
national poll," co-captain Kristen Traband 'OB said.
She added that another benefit of Tuesday night's
win was that it "boosted our defense's rep around the
league."
Head coach Todd Anckaitis was particularly
pleased with the victory Tuesday night.
"We played really well as a team," he said. "We
have a tendency to play to the level of our opponents,
but yesterday we played to our level. We dictated the
flow of the game."
Midfielder Amy Vachal 11 also thought the team
did a good job of playing to its full potential against
Washington.
"I think we did well at keeping the intensity up,"

she said.

Anckaitis is happy with the progress the team has
made over the course of the season thus far, commending them on its improved ability to find open
players on offense.
"We're hitting a good stride," he said. "It's a good
way to enter conference."
The women's soccer team look to continue its success this Saturday on the road at McDaniel College,
but return home for an 8 p.m. game next Wednesday
against what will very likely be its greatest challenge
this season, Johns Hopkins University, a team that
was picked to win the conference in this year's preseason coaches poll (centennial.org).

starting players. How do you say that in Russian? Why is it that

Abramovich assumes the authority to pressure his manager into
starting certain players? Chelsea Football Club has never been a
dictatorship, and it will remain that way for the rest of its existence. Abramovich needs to learn to take a seat on the bench; he
should let the manager do the selecting. If he feels otherwise,
maybe he should try taking a "decent" side like FC Porto to the
Champions League final.
The epilogue, or what little of it we have now, hints at troubles
to come. Avram Grant, Mourinho's Israeli successor, lacks the
necessary coaching qualifications to manage a Premier League
club. To make matters worse, Chelsea got mauled two to nil by
archrival Manchester United at Old Trafford, albeit partially
thanks to some absurd refereeing. Michael Essien drew the wrath
of Petr Cech via some uncharacteristically lax defending, foreshadowing a major exodus to come in the January transfer window. Mourinho may have left Chelsea Football Club by "mutual
consent," but, in reality, he delivered the ultimate parting blow to
Abramovich, to be paid in separate installments. Game, set and
match, Portugal.
