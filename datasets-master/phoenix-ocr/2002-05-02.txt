Student charged in child pornography case
BY BENJAMIN KABAK AND ELIZABETH WRIGHT
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu and ewrightl@swarthmore.edu
Delaware County police arrested Ivan Boothe 'O4 on
Monday on charges of possessing and disseminating child
pornography after police discovered 500 illegal images on
his personal computer.
He appeared that day with his mother and his attorney
at a preliminary hearing in the district courthouse in
Media.
He was released after posting 10 percent of the $lOO,OOO
bail set by District Judge Stephanie Klein, according to
arresting officer Lieutenant David Peifer of the Delaware
County Criminal Investigation Division.
Charges against Boothe include one count of criminal
attempt to corrupt minors, one count of criminal attempt
to unlawfully contact or communicate with a minor, six
counts of sexual abuse of children through the dissemination of child pornography, 500 counts of sexual abuse of
children through the possession ofchild pornography and
506 counts of criminal use of a communication facility,

according to the arrest warrant.
A preliminary hearing is set for May 6 before Judge
Klein in Media District Court.

Boothe, a writer and editor for The Phoenix since the
fall 2000 semester, has been on leave from his duties at the
paper since April 16, the day after Editor in Chief Deirdre
Conner 'O3 learned he was under investigation. Boothe
has had no involvement with The Phoenix or its editorial
decisions since then.
According to Peifer, pictures found on Boothe's computer contained images of both pre-pubescent and postpubescent children. Peifer, who received special training
through the national Internet Crimes Against Children
task force, said that the large number of images found on
Boothe's computer will have an effect on his prosecution.
"[The charges are] similar to having cocaine," he said.
"It's illegal having even one picture. Each time a picture
is viewed or sent out that child is reoffended again."
Until Boothe enters a plea, determining what penalties

he might face if found guilty of any of the charges is difficult. Because the possession charge is a second degree
felony and the dissemination charge is a third degree
felony, maximum jail time could be as high as 45 years.
In a statement to The Phoenix, Boothe said, "I am currently in counseling and have been for more than a month
for this problem that I have. I hope that in time, I am able
to correct this part of me that I am not, nor have I ever
been, happy about."
College officials said Boothe is now living off campus
and will finish out the semester. Boothe said he has
received approval from the deans to take a leave of
absence during the coming fall semester and he plans to
return for the spring 2003 semester.

Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie did not want to
speculate about whether Boothe would be asked to leave
the college.
While describing the alleged behavior as "reprehensible," Goundieand Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 noted
that they as yet have no direct evidence concerning the
nature of the crimes.
Goundie said Swarthmore will not take any action
until the legal system decides Boothe's case, and that the
college will take its cue from the courts as to the severity
of the offenses.
"The behavior, as it is described, is certainly reprehen-

Lockheed may take up college proposal next year
Company board votes against motion barring discrimination based on sexual orientation
BY BRENDAN KARCH

bkarchl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's shareholder resolution

demanding that Lockheed Martin bar dis-

crimination on the basis of sexual orientation earned a victory last week when
shareholders at the defense giant's annual
meeting gave the bid enough votes to
ensure the college's right to renew the proposal next year.
The college's resolution, the first of its

kind initiated by an educational institution since the anti-apartheid movement of
the 1980s, received five percent of the vote
at the meeting. But the company's board of
directors voted unanimously to oppose
Swarthmore's resolution.
For a shareholder bid to be reintroduced a second year, it must earn at least
three percent of the vote. The number of
votes each shareholder receives is determined by the number of shares it owns.
According to Diane Bratcher, president

of the shareholder advocacy group
Equality Project, corporations may or may
not be forced to adopt shareholder resolutions depending on individual state laws.
Resolutions rarely, if ever, receive a
majority vote, but the publicity the resolution creates is often strong enough to convince corporations to change their policies.
"The message can be very effective,"
Bratcher said. "Shareholder resolutions

have persuaded a large number of companies that they should end their policies"
that do not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.
"What's so good about shareholder resolution is that it takes the issues to the top
people in the company," Bratcher added.

putting the resolution forward
through the proxy statement, the top people in the company have to address it."
According to Jim Fetig, spokesman for
Lockheed-Martin, the stance of the company's board of directors has not changed as
a result of the shareholder vote. "It is our
contention that [a change] is not needed,
that gay rights are indeed in both our
ethics and our nondiscrimination policies," he said.
Lockheed's current policy does not,
however, formally bar discrimination
based on sexual preference. According to
the company's corporate Web site, it bars
discrimination with regard to "race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age,
United States military or veteran's status,
and/or mental or physical disability."
Lockheed Martin is the only major U.S.
defense contractor that does not have a
sexual nondiscrimination clause in its
equal opportunity policy, according to

Search for new IC director nears finish
BY CATHY DANH
cdanhl@swarthmore.edu

The three candidates for
Intercultural Center director met
with students over the past two
weeks in the final stage of a
semester-long search.
Candidates Jose Rodriguez,
Rafael Zapata and Meghna Bhagat
participated in day-long interviews with
students and IC organizations,"
according to Associate Dean of
Multicultural Affairs Darryl
Smaw, who chairs the IC director
search committee. The committee
plans to submit a recommendation before the end of the semester
supporting one of the candidates.
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62
will make the final decision about
whom to hire.
"I'm pretty positive that we
will know by the end of the year,"
said William Tran 'O3, a member
of the search committee.
The first candidate, Jose
Rodriguez, came to campus last
Wednesday. Rodriguez is currently the director of intercultural
affairs and assistant director of
student affairs at Pennsylvania
University—Abington
State
College. His experiences at Penn
State include counseling and
advising student organizations.
"He was friendly and personable," said Michelle Lo 'O4,
Swarthmore Asian Organization
(SAO) president. But, she added,
"when it came to the issue of
whether [IC] meetings should be
open or closed, he was [insistent]

on having them be closed. He
doesn't understand the situation
at Swat, and that reflected negatively on him."
"[Rodriguez] never gave any
real answers," said Nelson Flores
'O3, Swarthmore Queer Union
representative.

"I don't think he understood
how support groups work," SAO
and Deshi member Jyothi
Natarajan 'O5 said. "I also felt he
was trying to please us with his
answers [and was] not assertive

enough."
But Tran was "satisfied" with

Rodriguez's

work experience,
includes working with
members of all the cultural groups
the IC serves, with the exception
of Native Americans.
The second candidate, Rafael
Zapata, came to campus Monday.
Zapata is currently assistant
director of the office for African,
which

Latino and Asian American student services at New York
University. He developed ongoing
programming in various areas
such as leadership, social justice,
and cultural affairs while at NYU.

"[Zapata] was really great,"
said Arpita Parikh 'O4, SAO mem-

ber and IC Intern. "His ideas
always included a component of
student initiative and student
input. As director, you have to
understand that it is about what
the students want; it's for the students."
"I was extremely impressed

with [Zapata's] ability to answer
questions articulately and with*
concrete examples to back his

statements up," Tran said. "I
thought he could have had a lot
more experience with queer students and non-Latino/black stu-

dents in general. When asked
about non-Latino/black groups, he
mainly gave examples of occasions where he collaborated
Latino efforts with another
groups' efforts, which is good, but
we also want someone who has
direct experience with each

group."

The final candidate, Meghna
Bhagat, interviewed on Tuesday.
Bhagat currently serves as the
director. After Anna
Maria Cobo resigned as IC director last year, Bhagat, who was the
IC's evening coordinator at the
time, stepped in to fulfill the director's duties. Bhagat is currently
completing a master's degree at
the University of Pennsylvania.
"Among people who like
[Bhagat], it is because she acts
towards students as peers, rather
than an administrator type," Jon
Elmer 'O4 said. "The politics of the
culture of the IC needs someone
who is experienced, someone who
hasjbeen here for a year and has
been successful for a year."
Tran said, "I felt that the fact
that she has already been here for
IC's interim

two years made the interview
process slightly difficult. So many
students already had preconceptions. I hope that everyone will
try their best to be objective when
choosing someone for the position."
The search committee meets
Monday and, according to Tran,

will most likely meet once more
before submitting a recommendation to the Office of the Dean.
"The IC has just celebrated its
tenth year anniversary," Smaw

said. "The next step is how to
chart the next five years for the
IC, developing a vision and plan
for the IC to grow and expand

beyond its current services."

College commits to 2.5 percent wind power
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
The college made a commitment to cleaner energy on
April 18, when it arranged for 2.5 percent of its electricity
to come from wind power. The move was the culmination

of five years of student effort.
In 1997, members of Earthlust issued a formal proposal
for college adherence to a plan for environmental preservation. Three students, Sanya Carley 'O3, Sierra CurtisMcLane 'O2 and Galen O'Toole 'O3, amended this proposal
in the spring of 2001 with the suggestion that the college
purchase energy produced by wind turbines. The students
invited John Hanger, head of the environmental advocacy
group Penn Future, to speak to college faculty, administration and students in May 200

After this presentation, many people still had questions
about the importance of wind power, so engineering professor Carr Everbach spent the summer investigating its
benefits. In September, he gave a faculty lunch presentation describing his findings.
Everbach argued that using "dirty" sources like coal,
oil and nuclear energy indirectly harms both people and
the environment. As such, Everbach claimed it is against
college policy to use of these kinds of energy, and the college should be a leader in the movement toward renewable
energy. This trend couldn't come soon enough, he said,
since Pennsylvania has the most acidic rainfall and the
fourth smoggiest air of any state. In fact, Everbach calculated that the college's energy usage causes one death
every other year from pollution.
After his presentation, Everbach issued a formal
request to the College Budget Committee through a letter
to Larry Schall '75, vice president of facilities and CBC cochair. He proposed the college purchase some fraction of
its electrical energy from wind turbine sources through
Community Energy in 2003. He recommended starting
with five percent of the college's total projected energy use,
explaining that the additional cost would be only $15,000.
The college did not want to make such a large investment, and the budget committee decided in early April on
2.5 percent, at an additional cost of $7,500. Everbach is content with this percentage, for now. "It is my hope that in
future years we can increase this percentage," he said.
"My personal goal would be to have a substantial fraction
of the college's power be wind by 2010."
Schall agrees that wind power is a good idea. "Clearly,
energy from a renewable source is a more sustainable
approach and something the college would want to support," he said.
But due to budget constraints, Schall said he was forced to
think strategically about future plans. "Because there is a
price up charge for wind power now and our budget is limitMay 2, 2002

Ed, we wanted to make a change where that price differential
could be recovered through conservation measures," he said.
Everbach agrees that conservation is very important.
"It doesn't make sense to purchase clean, wind-generated
electricity if you're wasting it," he said.
Because of the need for conservation, Earthlust's energy efficiency campaign is closely tied to the wind power
proposal. "We've worked hard to find ways we can be more

"If you increase the demand of wind
energy, you increase the supply."
Earthlust member Joe Florence 'O4
efficient in our behavior," he said.
Earthlust member Joe Florence 'O4 explained that, in
integrating energy conservation with the wind power proposal, the college wants to show that students actually
value this change. The college wants the conservation
effort to save at least $7,500, the amount it is spending for
wind energy. "We would be offsetting the price of renewable energy," Florence said.
Earthlust is hopeful that showing a commitment to conservation will encourage the college to show more of a
commitment to clean energy. "We think it would be great
to announce withthe science center opening that it will get
all of its energy from wind power," Florence said.
He also noted a greater commitment to clean energy
would have other benefits, like providing positive publicity
"Since we are buying wind energy, we are going to be highlighted by an energy provider as a model school," he said.
This would, in turn, advance the evolution of wind
energy. "We feel that being at the head of the pack is very
important, because if you increase the demand of wind
energy, you increase the supply," he said.

Student Council establishes vans to Philly, 17-meal plan
BY JAR ED LENOW

jlenowl@swarthmore.edu

After a contested election, five newly elected Student
Council members will join the remainder of one of the
most productive councils in recent memory.
In two uncontested races, Ryan Budish 'O4 was elected
co-president and Joseph Dickerson 'O4 was elected

Campus Life Representative. Youssef Soliman 'O3 won
narrowly in the race for Financial Policy Representative,
edging out his closest competitor by only 33 votes.
Neil Cavanaugh 'O3 won in his bid to be Student
Groups Adviser, and Lester Tran 'O3 was elected
Educational Policy Representative.
"I came out of [my first council meeting] with a heightened confidence in the abilities of my colleagues and of
council," Tran said. "Each of us has made certain promises in our platforms, and I now have the fullest conviction that with our tenacity and diligence, the council will
not fall short of fulfilling the student body's expecta-

tions."
The increased interest in Student Council positions
encouraged current council members. In sharp contrast
to last semester's election, in which the majority of candidates ran unopposed, this contest saw only two one-candidate races. Council members attributed this interest
increase to the group's recent greater visibility.
"The Student Council has really done a lot this semes-

Kids develop robotics with Swat professor
Engineering professor leads class of homeschooled children in efforts to construct robots
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

A group of adolescent boys invades Hicks basement
every Tuesday afternoon. They crowd around a computer
in Hicks 101, waiting eagerly to see if the programs they
just developed will work as intended and enable a robot to
perform.
At a recent meeting, the boys were experimenting with
a light sensor. Engineering professor Carr Everbach was
dictating the program the boys had written to Jess Unger,
age 11, who was inputting it into the computer. The commands, such as "fsensor[num]=(float)sensor[num]" are
meaningless to most, but the boys seemed to understand
perfectly. They watched attentively as Unger finished typing and nodded as Everbach explained how the light sensor would work. The professor had the full attention of his

students, save one.
One boy had left the group and was typing commands
into another computer. Suddenly a robot sprang to life and
began circling the table, much to his enjoyment. Everbach

let him experiment for awhile, only stopping him when he
tried to attach two computers together with cables. Even
then, he merely glanced up and said, "Nathaniel, that's not
good for the computers," and then returned his attention
to the other boys, who were struggling with the logistics of
the robot's light sensor.
This adolescent invasion is a new addition to Hicks this
semester. It began when Everbach took a French class at
Swarthmore while on leave in fall 2000. At 40 years old, he
was the oldest member of the class, and he soon became
acquainted with Unger, who, at the other extreme of 10,
was the youngest French scholar on campus.
Everbach eventually stopped taking French, but one
year later Unger contacted him and asked if he would help
him and his friends with their Lego Mindstorm robotics

Cuts remove internship program from summer options
Summer of Service Program on one-year hiatus due to status of capital campaign finances
BY REIKO TESHIBA
rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

As a result of the college's overall budget cutbacks, the Summer of Service internship program, sponsored by the Office of
Community Service Learning, wiU not be

available this summer.
The capital campaign funds the
Summer of Service internship, which ran
as a pilot project the past two summers.
According to Pat James, director of community service learning programs, the
internship was designed to provide students
with career-oriented experience in non-profit organizations. It was also a chance for students to work in generally unpaid service
who might otherwise have had to forgo
service opportunities in order to meet their
summer earning obligations. James said
that the application process was need-blind,
with a slight preference for rising seniors
and a lottery for the remaining slots.
Summer of Service, funded by the
Foundation
and
the
Swarthmore
President's Office, provided 25 students
each summer with $125 a week for living
expenses and a stipend of $1,890, which
matches the college's expected summer
earnings for students on financial aid.
But this summer, the program will be
temporarily suspended due to a decline in
the value of the college's, endowment,
which has reduced the amount of funds

available. James said that although the
campaign had funded about $3,200 for each
participating student, it did not cover any
of the costs of supervising the program.
"This doesn't mean that Summer of
Service will never be offered again," James
said. The Swarthmore Foundation, which
has been funded primarily by alumni for
the past 15 years, is still providing 26 students with community service internships.
These fellowships also provide $125 a week
for living expenses but do not cover summer earnings. What happens, James said,
is that students who are also eligible for
federal work-study funding can receive
additional funds for living expenses from
the federal government.
James said both the capital campaign
and the college are "totally committed" to
having a service-focused summer program.
She is confident that Summer ofService will
again be available for the summer of 2003.
Jon Ehrenfeld 'O4 is one of the students

who received a Swarthmore Foundation

fellowship for this summer. He will be
working full-time at the Swarthmore
Volunteer Fire Department, which entails
90 hours of on-call time per week, Monday
through Saturday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
However, since the grant only provides for
living expenses, Ehrenfeld is looking for a
night job to earn money over the summer.
Ehrenfeld, who volunteers at the fire
department during the school year, says

that he is looking forward to the opportunity to work full-time.
"There's a lot to maintaining the fire
department," he said. Apart from the daily
upkeep, he said, the fire department

going to museums, since the program was
both academic and recreational.
"I want to go into teaching, so the

internship gave me experience working
with children and communicating effectively in a classroom," Flores said.
Rachel Nafziger 'O2 interned with the
Latina Domestic Program last summer. She
spent divided her time between the program
office and the Philadelphia Family Court.
Nafziger helped design brochures in
Spanish that took into account some of the
issues that the Latina population faces. At
the Philadelphia Family Court, she provided crisis counseling for people who had
filed for protection from abuse orders. The
internship also provided specific training
in dealing with clients, which included
shadowing legal counselors for a few weeks
at the beginning of the summer.
"The counseling depended on the client
and their needs," Nafziger said. "It was a
really great experience, even though it was
difficult at times. I was impressed with the
amount of responsibility I got at my
internship and how much the organization
welcomed me."
She also said the Summer of Service program allows students to do serious social
work regardless of their financial situation.
"I think the internship had a really big
impact on me," Nafziger said. She is now
looking into social work opportunities
after graduation. "The program can change
people's career plans, and it's a way to
focus, engage and build relationships with
people working in the field."

SCCS changes policy after
arrest in child porn case
NICOLE BRUNDA

BY

The recent search warrant related to the child
pornography case served to the college April 11 has
led to a small but important policy change for the
Swarthmore College Computing Society (SCCS).

warrant to enact a new measure to ensure ITS
access to the SCCS server in the case of an unforeseen emergency, such as a search warrant or system failure, Salmon said. The new measure, which
Salmon described as an "escrow system with ITS,"
entails the installment of a locked box in the SCCS
server room in which there will be a sealed envelope containing the server's root password.
"This way, if ITS had to get into the server in the
case of an emergency they can, but they leave a
record both with Public Safety [who would be
required to open the server room's door] and with
us through breaking the seal on the envelope,"
Salmon explained. "The solution strikes a nice balance between autonomous administration and
pragmatism."

autonomous entity, but, within the legal world, the

On April 11, law enforcement officials delivered
a warrant to the college that, according to ITS Unix
system administrator Adam Preset, required immediate access to all files on the Swarthmore computer network owned by the stipulated student, including those on the studentadministered SCCS server.

EPC reviews college's
right to access server
Members of the Electronic Privacy Committee (EPC) teleconferenced with two lawyers last week, one advising the college
and one representing one of the college's insurance organizations, to obtain a clear, legal understanding of the rights of
ownership the college has over its electronic information systems.

Though the meeting with the lawyers offered little advance
in terms of the path EPC should follow to develop a policy, it
solidified the legal rights the college has as the owner of the
network and voice mail machinery. According to EPC chair and
math professor Steven Maurer, an understanding of the legal
rights of the college will form the stepping stone for EPC's formulation of a more complicated set of college guidelines governing the electronic privacy of its faculty, staff and students.

"There is no difference as far as the law
is concerned between faculty, staff and
students."
Steven Maurer, EPC member
"Under the law, the college owns the network and the college owns the faculty computers, so they can do whatever the
hell they want with them," said Branen Salmon 'O3, EPC student representative, summarizing the legal aspects of ownership discussed with the lawyers. But both he and Maurer said
that formulating a set of guidelines of exactly when the college
should exercise these rights, most notably when not required
to do so through a warrant or subpoena, is a much more interesting issue.
"The college has the legal right to look at the network
because it owns it," Maurer said. "But whether the college
should is another, far more difficult question." For the
remainder of the semester and in the fall, the EPC aims to
formulate a set of recommended guidelines for when the college should use its ownership rights.
"Essentially, we're looking at when the college should
choose to use its rights when it doesn't have to," Maurer
said.
Another key issue is deciding if and when to differentiate
among faculty, staff and students, Maurer said. "There is no
difference as far as the law is concerned between faculty,
staff and students," he added, citing legal knowledge from
last week's teleconference. But he noted that, legally, college
ownership of faculty computers does give the college the
legal right to examine their contents. In contrast, the college
does not have the legal right to access information on private
student computers in the same way.

UNC first to eliminate early decision option
BY ALEX GARINGER
THE CHRONICLE (DUKE U.)
(U-WIRE) DURHAM,

N.C.

Less than

six months after Yale University President
Richard Levin proposed a nationwide elimof early-decision admissions,
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
last week became the first highly selective
university to abolish the practice.
Duke University officials, in response to
their Tobacco Road neighbors' decision,
said the move will add fuel to the growing
debate on the issue, but Duke will retain its
early-decision process.
"At Duke, we have decided to continue
to limit the number of students we take by
early admission, rather than dropping the
process," President Nan Keohane wrote in
an e-mail. "We will continue to concentrate
on recruiting and admitting most of our
students in the regular decision pool."

THE PHOENIX

Duke currently limits the number of
students it admits early to about a third of
each class, Director of Undergraduate
Admissions Christoph Guttentag said.

In his December statements to The New
York Times, Levin said the process forces
high school students to decide too early on
their colleges of choice and also limits
diversity by favoring students from private
or affluent public schools, who are not as
dependent on financial aid offers.
UNC-CH and its chancellor, James
Moeser, agreed. "We want to encourage
students to approach their education seriously, not by using strategy, and we hope to
contribute to a national climate that
encourages thoughtful choice," Moeser
said in a statement.
According to the statement, an internal
review conducted over the past several
months showed that 82 percent of those
admitted early decision to UNC-CH were

white, as opposed to 72 percent from the
later pool
statistics that UNC-CH
Director of Admissions Jerome Lucido said
were a major factor in the decision.
"No matter how responsibly you run an
early-decision program, it still tends to be a
group of students who are more financially
able and less diverse," Lucido said.
Twenty-four percent of early decision
applicants to Duke this year listed themselves as minorities, compared to 34 percent of all applicants, regular and early.
Keohane said she was not surprised by
UNC-CH's decision, as Moeser previously
had told her the university was considering it. She added she thought some other
universities may follow their lead.
"Since this was an institution making a
decision it perceived to be in its best interest, I think any other institutions following
suit would do so only for the same reasons," Guttentag wrote in an e-mail. "I'd be

May 2, 2002

surprised if any institution that has a wellestablished early decision program followed suit."
Early decision was re-instituted at UNCCH in 2000, after more than a 30-year hiatus. The university also has an early action
process, which will remain. Guttentag said
early action is not a likely alternative for
Duke and cited as rationale Brown

University, which switched from early
action to early decision effective next year
because of lack of resources and time to
evaluate all applications fairly.
Keohane said Duke will continue to

evaluate its admissions process.

number of students every year, I do worry
that too many students may feel compelled

Keeping the faith
Over the years, it's become Phoenix tradition to reserve
this space for a message from the outgoing leader of the
paper, a letter from the editor, whose personal voice
remains silent despite countless hours of devotion to covering this community's sorrows and successes. I always
thought the practice a bit self-indulgent and had even
planned to buck the trend and run our normal editorials
there's obviously plenty to write about right now. In the
end, I thought it would come down to this: One hour left
before deadline. A moment of inspiration. A thoughtful,
heartfelt letter that would illuminate my passion for journalism, my experience at Swarthmore, the affection I feel
for my staffers.
That letter can never happen now.
Assuming you haven't skipped immediately to the editorials column, you probably know that a member of our editorial board is facing charges of possessing child pornography, sending it to minors, and having suggestive conversations with minors, including phone sex. The story was
shocking enough when we first started our investigation
the day after the college network was searched. Finding out
that the person under investigation was Ivan Boothe 'O4, a
friend and colleague, has been a challenge far beyond what
I expected for the end of my tenure as editor of The
Phoenix.
It's important for me to tell you that Ivan has been on
leave from his duties at The Phoenix since I learned he was
the subject of the investigation. The only involvement he
had in this story was to issue a statement to us about the

charges filed against him.
Over the past few weeks, everything that The Phoenix
stands for as the voice of the student body has been questioned. It has been a struggle for me, but even more so for
my staff, most of whom did not learn who the student
under investigation was until the arrest on Monday. It
breaks my heart to know that every person who picks up
this week's Phoenix will be reading our coverage with a
skeptical eye. We have examined and re-examined ourselves at every step in the story, but now I feel confident
that we did all we could to be fair and accurate in the story.
We owe a great debt to our friend and adviser from The
Philadelphia Inquirer, Dale Mezzacappa. She has been an
invaluable resource every week of this semester.
Some really bad things have happened this year, events
here and beyond our campus that have caused us all to
question ourselves and each other. But quite a few good
things have happened, too. Call that statement simplistic if
you like, but perhaps you don't see it quite like I do.
Journalists become intimately acquainted with the details
of every story to produce the digestible piece that you read.
That means the gritty and tedious, but it also means the
joys and accomplishments. And I want this letter to end
with the faith that we've learned a great deal I know I
have.
I consider it a privilege to have pored over photos and
stories about the perfected expression on an actor's face, or
the torrent of emotion after Sept. 11, or even the light
switch comically affixed to McCabe. And so I want to invite
all of you to come and take home a photo or two for your
scrapbook (or your parents'). I've watched all of you do the
things you love, from sports to activism and beyond. It

gives me faith.

We agree with the editor and

would like to take this opportunity
to
mention another campus
resource: AWARE women's self-

defense classes and workshops.
AWARE, an organization that we
are a part of, brings trainers from
Women's Anti-Violence Education
in Philly, to teach classes and
workshops at Swarthmore.

Half the time in classes and

workshops is spent discussing
street smarts, stranger assault and
physical techniques, and another
half is spent specifically discussing acquaintance assault, the

situations where such assault
might occur at Swarthmore and
verbal assertiveness and physical
skills that will help women prevent, resist and heal from acquaintance assault.
On different note, as the editorial discusses, the issue of sexual

assault on this campus doesn't get
the attention it deserves; AWARE
feels the repercussions of that. Our
classes and workshops, though
always appreciated by those who
participate, are often small, we
didn't get requested budget funding, and even with the latest outburst of concern, few people recognize that women's self-defense
classes not only combat stranger

assault but are also a means to
empower women in acquaintance
assault situations.
We hope more women will take
advantage of this campus resource
in the future.

Swarthmore profits from war

While ending discrimination against sexual orientation is a worthy goal, I am nevertheless extremely

college seems to be overlooking the issue of defense
contracting and arms manufacture.

the

arms manufacture?

The articles ignore this overriding issue of supporting and profiting from weapons of war and
destruction. By broadcasting Swarthmore's ownership of Lockheed Martin stock, the headlines appear
to condone investment in such militaristic activities.

According to the Phoenix, Suzanne Welsh, the college treasurer, states that ownership of stock is based
on economic reasons, economic return. Was there no
consideration of socially responsible investing before
the issue of discrimination against sexual orientation
arose? Claiming now to be involved in socially
responsible investing rings hollow when that investing has already been done in the field of arms manufacture.
I hope that Swarthmore College will extend the
realm of its social responsibility to include reconsideration of ownership in any companies which manu-

facture arms.

It is both beautiful and tragic, and I fell in love with it,

PHOENIX

Survivors' wishes come first
BY MAYA SCHENWAR

mschenwl@swarthmore.edu

In the week since The Phoenix's
article on the campus sexual assault
policy appeared, the topic has been
all over the news. In particular, the
United States' lack of standard procedures for processing DNA evidence has been getting a lot of press.
The Debbie Smith bill, now in
Congress, is a measure designed to
support standardized evidence collection through the use of "rape
kits," provide funds to speed up
forensic analysis of DNA cases, and
fund the training of personnel in
collecting and managing DNA evidence. The bill is a good idea.
Letting thousands of evidence kits
sit on shelves in laboratories for
years, while the criminals connected with them remain free, is a bad
idea. However, the implications of
the bill's emphasis on "systematiza-

tion" concern

me.
Reading about the

Debbie Smith
bill, I was reminded of an April 22
Delaware County Daily Times editorial
entitled,
"Swarthmore's

'options' policy seems criminal."

The editorial accuses Swarthmore

of "encouraging" survivors to "do
nothing about it," "aiding and abetting criminal behavior." It berates
Swarthmore's administration for
allowing the recent sexual assault
case to go unreported for a month
and a half. Basically, the Daily
Times was arguing for "systematization" and "standardization." In
plainer words, it was urging the
administration to take autonomy
out of survivors' hands.
Swarthmore's "options" policy is
a great thing. It means that students
who report sexual assault are presented with all the routes they can
take: reporting the attack to the
police, handling the case within the
college's judicial system, waiting,
doing nothing. Survivors are not
coerced into choosing one route or
another. (Under the Daily Times'
preferred policy, assaulted students
would be dragged from the scene of
the attack directly to the police
department.) There is currently no
"standard"; Swarthmore's policy

in survivors' hands,

puts the power
allowing

decisions.

It is just this process of individual decision-making that the Debbie

letters

to

the

Smith bill seems to contradict.
Speeding up "evidence collection"
and "processing" is all well and
good; survivors who wish to press
charges immediately should have
the resources to do so. However,
amid all the technical talk about
"systematization,"
"standardization" and trials, humans have disappeared from the scene.
For every step in the process of
evidence collection and processing,
sexual assault survivors must have
choices.

Before evidence is taken,
processed and used in pre-court and
court proceedings, the nurses, doctors and lawyers involved must
present all possible options to the

survivor. Swarthmore's sexual
assault policy is right on track. No
evidence-obtaining process should
become so quick, systematized and
efficient that it erases the people
involved.
This is the trap that both the
Daily and the Debbie Smith bill fall
into. Of course, apprehending sexual offenders is important. But in
placing so much emphasis on
offenders, we must not lose sight of
survivors' concerns.

editor

Phoenix overlooks survivors' concerns
Dear Editor:
In last week's article about Swarthmore's sexual
assault policy, The Phoenix suggested that law enforcement has a right to information about sexual assault
that should take precedence over survivors' wishes.
Survivors of sexual assault have no obligations to the
college or to the law. The community's first responsibility is to protect survivors and to offer them choices
and support. While some survivors find pressing
charges to be empowering or necessary, many do not
wish to engage with the law, or even to talk about their
experiences. Neither the college nor law enforcement
has any right to force survivors to do that.
Forcing survivors to press charges or to talk to
police would undermine survivors' rights to exercise

control over their own lives. It would also discourage
the many survivors who do not wish to or have not yet
decided to press charges from reporting sexual assault
at all and from seeking counseling and medical care.
The college should create an environment that is
unfriendly not to survivors but to sexual assault and
sexual assailants. College administration and the
Swarthmore community can do this by improving prevention programs and counseling services. With permission from survivors, the college should aggressively
pursue disciplinary action against sexual assailants
while respecting their accusers' privacy. The burden of

pursuing and confronting assailants should not be on

the shoulders of survivors. The dean's office should

proactively investigate and punish assailants without
putting survivors through a grueling and unnecessary
process.
I also object to the article's terminology, specifically,
its use of the words "victim" and "rape." Most people
who have experienced sexual assault choose the word
"survivor." The word "victim" perpetuates and reinforces the experiences of and stereotypes about power-

lessness and

vulnerability against which survivors
fight every day.
The word 'Vape" carries associations of sensational-

ism and eroticism, as well as of a complete loss of control and dignity on the part of the survivor. These characteristics are not intrinsic to the experience of rape. In

addition, rape does not include all forms of sexual
assault and abuse. While some survivors of sexual
assault call their experience rape, many do not feel
comfortable with that word.
This is not a trivial issue of political correctness.
The experience of sexual assault belongs to the survivors, and it is as much their right to name it as it is
their right to seek legal redress for it if and how they
choose. Neither The Phoenix nor the college should
attempt to legislate those choices.

Prerequisites for PDCs restrict options
Dear Editor:
While searching for an interesting Primary
Distribution Course (PDC) to take next fall, it has come
to my attention that the majority of modern language

"introduction to culture" classes are offered only in
their respective foreign language. I don't understand
this. Why would an introductory level class be restricted by a language prerequisite? There are surely students who want to learn about a culture without having
to learn the language. Prerequisites for introductory
courses prevent students with diverse interests from
taking classes outside their specialization: for example,

different cultures. This program is not in the liberal
arts spirit of Swarthmore College, which attempts to
provide as diverse a learning environment as possible.
I bring this up because I found a fascinating humanities PDC: Introduction to Russian Culture. I looked it
up on the Russian department Web page and pre-

May 2, 2002

enrolled. A few days later, I got an e-mail saying that
this class was only being offered in Russian. Now, I
know for a fact that there is a very small number of students at this college that speak Russian. At the same
time, I would suspect that there is a greater number of
students that have an interest in Russian culture.
If a class is offered as a PDC, it should be available
to all students on an equal basis. The spirit of the PDC
program is to enrich students' college experience by
making them step "outside their box." College should be
a place where students take classes that expose them to
new subjects that they might not have had the opportunity to learn about in high school and may not have the
chance to explore in the future. Of course, upper-level
language classes must have prerequisites. Introductory
PDC classes, on the other hand, should be available to

all interested students, without exception.

Council will not appoint new SAG members
Dear Editor:
In last week's story "Student Advisory Group to CRC
resigns," Compensation Review Committee member
Sharmaine LaMar, reacting to the Student Advisory
Group's resignation, asked that Student Council appoint
a new SAG that "will be more balanced and not composed
of students with one agenda in mind."
After careful deliberation, we have decided not to
appoint a new slate of SAG members. We have faith that
the original members did the best that they could given
that they were not provided with hard copies of the CRC's
formal recommendations and that the CRC did not conduct the promised survey of student opinion.
In CRC chairperson Melanie Young's initial description of the SAG, which she wrote to inform students considering applying to it, its role is "reviewing recommendations, gathering input, assisting the committee in communicating with the community, or any other number of
tasks." This role is inconsistent with Young's statement
last week that the SAG was nothing more than a group to
"bounce ideas off of." Some of the SAG members' commitments to the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
are irrelevant here; any community member would find
it impossible to fulfill the tasks laid out for the SAG given

the lack of cooperation on the part of the CRC that is evidenced by Young's comments and the committee's behavior. The current SAG has been trying since September to

address what we believe are objectively valid concerns,
and we stand by its decision to resign and our initial deci-

sion to appoint its members.
We cannot in good conscience continue to appoint
members to a group that is not being allowed to fulfill its
role simply in order to satisfy administrators' desire for a
semblance of student participation. The CRC addresses a
community concern, and students, as integral members
of the school community, need to be meaningfully
involved. Student Council spends countless hours choosing the most qualified students for groups such as the
SAG, but we hope that by not appointing new members to
the SAG that we can begin a dialogue about how to better
integrate students into this process. We cannot ignore the
CRC's devaluation of student participation, but we do
think that this problem can be amicably addressed, and
we hope to work with them to fix it.

Don't forget 'innocent until proven guilty'
Dear Editor:
In last week's issue of The Phoenix, Patrick Runkle
and Morghan Holt referred to the child porn investigation
as though there were a student on campus who had been
distributing child porn and having phone sex with
minors. We should not make this assumption without
more direct evidence. At press time, all The Phoenix had

reported was that Lt. David Peifer had filed an affidavit
claiming that a student had admitted to these acts.
Discussions on the morality of child porn and phone
sex with minors are fine, but assumptions of guilt before
charges have been filed could contribute to a persecutory
and paranoid atmosphere on campus.

Two weeks ago, the popular

Some ask why so

„

Racism is

Americans are
so offended by the T-shirts.
First of all, I would like to clarify that I speak as an AsianAmerican female student and do
not

necessarily

caricatures of AsianAmericans as restaurant owners
and laundrymen on three of the Tshirts represent exploitation of the
historical and current economic situation of many Asian-Americans
for profit. Asian-Americans who
have come to the
United States, from
the 1800s until now,
did not choose to be
alive and laundrymen
or

represent

the

Swarthmore Asian Organization or
any other formal groups on campus. I, like many other Americans,
Asian and non-Asian, am upset
with these T-shirts because they are

but worked in these

that

has

been and continues
to limit the job

opportunities for

ing people. The fourth T-shirt in
question mocks Buddhism, telling
readers to "Get their Buddha on the
dance floor" as if Buddha is comparable to someone's booty.
Profiting from the exploitation
of the history and religions of

Asian-Americans is offensive and
needs to be stopped.
Some say that racism doesn't

exist on the East Coast and that
Asian-Americans should not take
this situation so seriously.
I would argue that racism is alive
and well everywhere in the United
States, making these T-shirts
extremely dangerous, especially if
the gravity of the situation is
excused as being funny.
Stereotypes, reinforced by these
T-shirts, create hatred and can be
used to justify the violation of civil
liberties. Let's not forget the profiling of Arab- and South AsianAmericans after Sept. 1L
The four T-shirts mentioned
above have been "recalled." Yet

Abercrombie's definitionof a recall
means the T-shirts were not
destroyed. They ended up at discount
stores such as the San Francisco
Market Street Store.
Abercrombie is still successfully
selling a children's line and a
women's line of offensive Asian caricature T-shirts. Organizers of this
campaign are demanding that
Abercrombie issue a public apology
and that it recall and destroy all of
the offensive T-shirts.

Abercrombie tees not worth the protest
BY TED CHAN
tchanl@swarthmore.edu
I am a very strong believer in practical activism.
Raising a brouhaha in this instance does not contribute practically to advancing the cause of Asians in
this country. Perhaps my initial opinion of just how
many people were offended was skewed by the fact that
the majority of my Asian friends are male and well-

assimilated.

My opinion became decisive when a black friend of
mine said, "You guys protest this?! Ha ha, you must be

kidding me."

These are T-shirts, not cops aiming guns at Asians
or anyone limiting their social mobility. This is not
racial profiling. I hate to say it, but it's a good sign in
your neck of the woods when some T-shirts made by
corporate morons effectively distanced from reality are
all you have to raise a fuss about.
Here's my personal background. I'm a history
major, studying Chinese and Asian-American history.
My parents are immigrants. They opened a restaurant
called The Wok and worked hundred-hour weeks to get
me here. Look, I know it hasn't been smooth sailing.
Discrimination was once horrendous against the

letter

to

Chinese, and I would never want to forget that it happened and that it could happen again. But these shirts
were a muffed attempt at levity, not an attempt to trivialize Asian-Americans and their history, which is one
filled with discrimination and struggle.
While they protest trivial issues like this one,
Asian-American activists fail to attack real issues in
the community. For example, the fate of Hmong,
Cambodian and Laotian immigrants (among others)
who are lumped as Asian but suffer from horrendous
poverty is largely ignored. But here, here is a chance
to seize the spotlight and take a stab at a big corporation. I'm disappointed that Asian-Americans would
allow their activism to mirror the glory-grab activism
that pervades college campuses in this day and age,
instead of working for real change in real social dilemmas. Many other Asians feel similarly about this issue.
"The people who are protesting this are overreacting. It's almost as if some Asians are so desperate to get
in on this 'l'm a victimized minority!' craze," said Joon
Suk Choi 'O2.

A Swarthmore Asian Organization flyer I saw in
Sharpies asked, "Abercrombie: Racist or idiots?"
I say idiots.
Idiots who are not worthy of us lifting a finger.

Avoiding fear, uncertainty and doubt
Dear Editor:
In his letter last week, Patrick Runkle '9B asks why,
thus far, coverage of the child pornography investigation
has leaned more toward electronic privacy issues than
toward the investigation itself. I'm surprised that
Runkle, as a journalist, cannot answer his own question.
With an issue as sensitive as this one, the press
must function as a reliable source of information for
the community and not sink into speculation. We talk
about electronic privacy because it is one thing about
which we do have information. Discussion of the investigation will undoubtedly come in time, but only once
we have knowledge sufficient enough to ground that
discussion in truth rather than in rumor.
How ironic it is, then, that, calling upon journalistic
tradition and denouncing sensationalism, Runkle ends
his letter with gross hyperbole. At no point were "a
bunch of cops running around campus searching
everyone's computers." There was no blanket warrant
opening the files of every student, nor were there men
with guns snooping around the college network.
The warrant specified that the files of one student

THE PHOENIX

would be copied from college servers for later review
by authorities. The search itself (this copying of files)
was conducted not by the police but by a Swarthmore

employee, ITS Unix system administrator Adam
Preset. The police were present merely to ensure that it
happened. Rumors suggesting that other students' files
were compromised or that police had free rein over the
network are just that: rumors. At no point was student
privacy violated, and at no point was anyone granted
special access to any portion of the Swarthmore network. The bounds of the warrant were not exceeded,
and the college network remained in the complete control of the college throughout the entire process.
Though this reality is certainly less colorful than
the full-blown "raid" Runkle refers to, it is still important that community members know exactly how it
may have an impact on them. The answer: not at all.
In times like these, the responsibility of the press is
paramount. The Phoenix has done well not to promote
the fear, uncertainty and doubt that Runkle would cast
upon the situation.

Classes should
move toward
lecture format
BY RENEE WITLEN

rwitlenl@swarthmore.edu

I have never been convinced by the notion that student-led
and -generated discussion could and should form the basis of
Swarthmore's seminars and courses. As much in my academic as in my non-academic life, I place a special value on
what those who have invested the most time, energy and passion in exploring any given subject have to say about said
subject. Swarthmore prides itself on its small classes and low
student-teacher ratio. Swatties have an amazing level of
access to world class professors. Why not take advantage of
the talent and experience that we pay a lot to access by listening to those who possess that talent and experience
instead of spending the majority of our class time listening to
each other? We can always talk to each other after class.
I believe the Swarthmore education would improve
immeasurably from an infusion oflecture-based courses and
a serious, critical evaluation of what is achieved by our particular balance of discussion-centered vs. lecture-based
learning models.
A discussion-based approach was the norm in the many
social science and humanities courses I took here. My best
professors directly challenged the established wisdom of
Swarthmore, which tends toward the idea of "let the kids
talk." My best classes included discussions but did not lean
too heavily upon this pedagogical approach. I learned best
from a well-balanced mix of lecture and discussion led by
professors who, without apology, imparted what they knew
by speaking for longer than any other member of the classroom. Dominating? Unfair? Ineffective? I don't think so. The
profs have Ph.D.s, and we don't. We don't even have B.A.s!
In general, professors do not receive training in educational theory and practice; Swarthmore hires faculty who
...

Dominating? Unfair? Ineffective?

know their disciplines and have practiced teaching in graduate school but have never been formally schooled in the art of
imparting knowledge. Teaching by leading discussion is a
complex, difficult task with many possibilities for failure in
the form of uninspired, undirected or simply uninformed
pronouncements by alternatively underconfident and cocky
young adults. Teaching via lecture seems easier. Given that
professors receive little to no instruction on how to lead discussion, I believe that encouraging lecture-based teaching
would play to the faculty's strength (their academic knowledge) rather than emphasizing a weakness in professor training.
I recently visited Dean Bob Gross to discuss my opinion
on this issue. He seemed to feel that lecture-based learning
was a passive process, more akin to entertainment than education, and certainly less rigorous than the engaging, dynamic discussion-based learning that (he believes) happens regularly here at Swat. I agree that lectures can seem more passive than discussions from the student perspective. I also
believe that discussions, when led poorly (as they often are),
teach a great deal less than any "passive" lectures do. Dean
Gross asked me if I thought my opinions were popular among
Swat students, or whether I considered myself a lone voice in
the wilderness. I told him that I didn't know. I'm curious
about what others think and would like to know whether I
am truly alone in my feeling that Swarthmore would do well
to evaluate critically, and revise, its educational strategies
and emphases.
I would love to hear from anyone with an opinion on this
topic; please e-mail rwitlenl@swarthmore.edu with your two
cents on the effectiveness of lectures and discussions at
Swarthmore.

The thesis I
never wrote
I always told myself that when I went to college, I'd write
a thesis entitled "Everybody Wants to Be Zack Morris." I
never wrote that thesis, but now, as I write my last column,
I will say what I have to say.
"Saved by the Bell" always amazed me. It wasn't well
done, nor was it particularly funny. Yet those who are close
to my age watched the show every day after school for a few
years of our lives. Perhaps more than any other show, we all
know "Saved by the Bell." Why?

FRANK MARTINEZ

Street Performer

Because everybody wants to
be Zack Morris. He is everything that is young and
American and fun and, as we
learn at the end of most
episodes, good. It starts with his
looks. Mark-Paul Gosselaar's
Californiablond hair and pretty
face are the Platonic form of the
self-assured, American teenager. This translates into his confidence, which we see with girls
but also in his nonchalant attitude toward everything from
school to dealing with those
pesky adults.
We love Zack because he is

always loved and he always
wins. Despite any moral lapses
he might initially have, he
always does the right thing. After dreaming of riches, he
eventually pushes the oil prospectors out of Bayside. After
being star struck by the actor Johnny Dakota, he confronts
him and his pot smoking ways. And after almost quitting
the Corps, he leads his team of misfits to victory over the
jocks. "The Corps doesn't like quitters," he reminded us all.
And perhaps most importantly, in a supreme act of friend-

We love Zack because he is always
loved and he always wins.

Caffeine cravings
must be conspiracy
Dear Editor:
I am writing to express my deep concern about
the apparent plunging potency of the campus coffee supplies. Over the course of this semester, I
have noticed that the caffeine content of the beverages in Kohlberg, Tarble, Sharpies and McCabe
seems to be decreasing at a steady yet alarming

rate.
ship, he made Jessie admit to her drug problem in the
famous "I'm so excited I'm so excited I'm so
scared"
...

confrontation.

There is all the great stuff that Zack did. He sang in the
glee club and got a 1502 on his SATs. He constantly outwitted rival A.C. Slater. He solved a murder mystery and practically adopted a homeless family at the mall one Christmas.
Zack even led the band "The Zack Attack" to rock fame,
even if it was a fantasy. When he became too big for his
britches, he returned for the "Friends Forever" reunion
tour.
Zack had many zany pursuits and wacky adventures. But
more important that any of that was Kelly Kapowski. Was
there a more perfect girlfriend? I can't imagine there was.
She was sweet as could be, from a big, loving family, and an
honest-to-goodness knockout. Zack Morris had her. I
remember thinking, truly, that Zack and Kelly would
always be together. Zack and Kelly. That just sounds right.
Like the JFK and Jackie of our generation
I don't think I
embellish when I say, to me, they were Camelot. As a young
high schooler who could only image what it would be like to
kiss a girl, Zack showed me how to land the very best.
But then devastation. Kelly's new manager at The Max
was college guy Jeff. (Oh, how he made me hate "college
guys.") He seduced her and stole her from Zack. They ultimately broke up at the costume ball, ironically and tauntingly dressed as-Romeo and Juliet. I have said it before and
I lost my innoI'll say it again. My cherry was popped
cence when my eyes were forced to witness Jeff and Kelly
kiss as she sat on the table at "their" booth at The Max.
But Zack Morris was resilient. There would be other
girls, a lesson we all need to learn. There Were teen advice
lines to operate, scams to pull and classes to cut. That summer at Malibu Sands was a blast. He always remembered, in
the end, how good of a friend Screech really was. Zack did it
his way and never half-assed.
Zack showed us how life could be a ball, and that's something I never want to forget.

Whereas in January, a single small coffee
would have sufficed for the day, I now find myself

chugging double espressos, boilermakers, triple
lattes, and chai in an increasingly fruitless effort
to stay awake. I call upon the college president, the
Board of Managers, and Public Safety to investigate this distressing situation posthaste. I would
do so myself, but I have to go take a nap.

Spadola's tongue faulty: Pat's is best
Dear Editor:

Normally, I find reading The Phoenix about as
exciting as watching grass grow. It manages to capture the essence of Swarthmore completely, because it
is both self-righteous and uninteresting at the same
time. This said, there is one issue addressed last week
that is of extreme importance.
Joey Spadola took it upon himself to "rate" the
cheesesteak establishments in South Philly. This is in
and of itself a ludicrous task. Everybody in the country is well aware that Pat's is the superior establishment, so I don't see why Mr. Spadola felt he needed to
waste his time going into Philadelphia to judge for
himself. Laughably, Mr. Spadola concluded that
Geno's in fact had the superior steak. This is, of
course, dead wrong, for the following reasons:
1. A cheesesteak run is not truly valid unless it is
done under the influence of intoxicating beverages at
four in the morning (with a sober driver, of course).
2. Commissioning your friends to eat your fries for
you is simply unacceptable. The rules clearly state
that you have to eat fries with your cheesesteak.
Furthermore, the fact that cheese fries were not
ordered leads me to question the validity of this whole
operation. If Mr. Spadola were truly big time, he
May 2, 2002

would have ordered cheese fries first, then snacked on
them while in line to get his cheesesteak (credit to
Josh Loeffler 'O3 for making me aware of this incredible policy).
3. As previously mentioned, everybody knows that
Pat's tastes better.
I might suggest that Mr. Spadola felt ill after eating
simply because he wasn't "man" enough to finish two

cheesesteaks himself. The fact that he referred to

Pat's meat as "wretched" seems to suggest that he
enjoys nothing in the world that is tasty and delicious. It amuses me that his conclusion about said

establishments

managed

to

accurately

reflect

Swarthmore's penchant for taking an easy decision
and inexplicably making the wrong choice. It has
been a trend that has been prevalent during my miserable stay at this awful, awful place. Mr. Spadola's
article made me happy that my time at Swarthmore is
coming rapidly to an end. So, in conclusion, I say
don't let Swarthmore mislead you once more! Just
because this is a miserable place, that doesn't mean
that you personally have to be miserable! Pat's

Cheesesteaks is clearly superior. Anyone who says
otherwise is simply dead wrong and worthless.

Infectious Organisms, who enlivened first-year orientation last semester, will return to campus for Worthstock
2002. The band is known for its soulful blend of hip-hop and instrumentals.

WORTH-WHILE
BY KATE DUFFY
kduffyl@swarthmore.edu

Guitar-strummer Don McLean once asked, "Do you
believe in rock *n' roll? Can music save your mortal
soul?" If in fact it can, hitherto hell-bound Swarthmore
students would do well to attend Worthstock 2002 this
weekend.
Sponsored by Crunkadelia Productions, WSRN and
Social Affairs Committee (SAC), the outdoor music festival occurs Saturday from noon until 7:15 p.m. The
event features Sister Blue, Infectious Organisms, Jim's
Big Ego, Inflight Rock Band and Mayfly. Though previ-

ous Worthstocks have been held in Worth courtyard,
this weekend's affair will take place on the Olde Club

Upsilon's
conjunction with
Delta
in
MargaritaviUe cookout.
The concert should prove a delightful afternoon of
repose from academics, suitably sandwiched between
lawn

the last week of classes and the beginning of final
exams. "Worthstock is going to be [freaking] awesome,"
said Dave McCandlish 'O5, who will handle sound
equipment.
"Hopefully there'll be nice

weather, and people can
sit in the grass with their friends," said Ross Hoffman
'O4, organizer of this year's show. In the event of rain,
the festival will be moved inside Olde Club proper.
Hoffman waxed enthusiastic over Worthstock's singular value. "This is an unusual event for Swat," he
said. "It's not an atmosphere we get a lot
an outdoor
music festival. It's also unusual to have such a variety
of music in one event. We'll have blues, hip-hop, folk,
rock *n' roll and jazzy jamming all on the same bill.
Also, there'll be a mixture of student and alumni bands,
plus legit bands from the outside world that already

have followings on campus."

Hoffman cited Infectious Organisms' rousing Olde
Club show last semester. "They're excited about coming back."
Hoffman considered including an indie-pop act as
well, but decided against it. "I tried to book a diverse
group of bands which would appeal to a wider audience
than a typical Olde Club show," he said.

THE

PHOENIX

According to WSRN Rock Director Drew Adams 'O3,
Worthstock started out as a folk music festival in the
ville many a year ago. "Apparently Woody Guthrie
played there in the 'sos," he said. The connection
between WSRN and the folk festival was natural.
"Worthstock was originally blues and folk, as opposed
to Olde Club rock. WSRN specializes in Americana, so
we ended up sponsoring it."
Eventually the concert moved from the ville to
Worth courtyard, and the musical focus shifted away
from folk; bands on previous rosters include the

Mountain Goats, Dalek and Le Tigre, though Le Tigre
ultimately canceled.
"We have a Worthstock shirt from 1995 up in the station," Adams said. "So we know [the event] has been
held here for at least that long. Maybe about ten years."
Indeed, the campus rock incarnation of Worthstock
has a checkered, nearly mythological past. For a few
months it also had a questionable future.
"Historically, members of the WSRN board have
handled Worthstock. This year it just seemed like
nobody was interested in doing it, so it was in danger of
not happening," Hoffman said. Worthstock 2002 is primarily Hoffman's brainchild; he booked the bands,
obtained SAC and WSRN funding, and gathered a crew
of students to help with publicity, food and equipment.
"For the past few years, Worthstock hasn't been very
certain. It's hard to get funding, but apparently Ross
was able to overcome that," Adams said. "He's been the
impetus for the whole shebang. Hats off."
Hoffman is also the drummer for Inflight Rock Band,
one of two student groups on the bill. The remainder of
Inflight's lineup comprises Joel Blecher 'O4 on guitar,
keyboard, cello and vocals, Aaron Goldman 'O3 on bass
and saxophone, and Matthew Stark Rubin 'O3 on guitar,
trumpet and vocals.
Mayfly will highlight both current students and
alumni: Joel Price 'OO on violin and mandolin, Marie
Abe 'Ol on keyboard, Corey Mark 'O2 on drums and
Ranmal Samarasinghe 'O3 on bass. Guest performers
for Mayfly include Mike Duffy 'Ol and Sam Dingman 'O4
on horns, and Wayne Miller 'OO and John Thomas 'O2 on
guitars.

lap around the pool.
Oh dear, dahling. You, too, have your sensible cotton
undies in a twist, don't you? Because: well, hmph, they call

themselves feminists!
Now, doll, we are talking about a collegiate culture in
which many women, eager to observe the paganistic,
nature-revering rituals of May Day but offended by the
phallocentric thrust of the May pole, prance around a
"May hole." Yes, dear, not only do they call themselves
feminists; they are feminists.
Then why the bikinis, you say? So impractical! So

objectifying! So oppressive!
Doll, these women have discovered what the brightest
minds of this world have been arguing for years, or at least
since the late '9os. That is: The postmodern body demands
to be made the site of fashion crossings.
Yes, dahling, to dismiss exhibitions of decorative attire
as frivolous and demeaning is to subscribe to patriarchal
notions of aesthetics. "The feminist challenge to a gendered aesthetic value system has been a powerful component" of the re-evaluation of long-derided arenas of pop
culture such as fashion, writes Elizabeth Wilson in "Chic
Thrills: A Fashion Reader."
"We can now see much more clearly how some aesthetic forms have come to be stereotyped as 'feminine' and

how they are then almost automatically judged
as less important, less worthy, less 'great' than
more 'masculine' kinds of art."
That's right, doll. It's time to reclaim Cosmo

for what it is: high art.
Applause to those who have been part of this
"feminist challenge," bravely claiming fashion as
legitimate fodder for cultural criticism. In "The
Fashion System," a semiological "structural
analysis of women's clothing as described by
Fashion magazines," Roland Barthes defines crucial components of the "vestimentary system." I
quote from this fine work:
"L ACCESSORY We have seen that this genus
contains varieties (handbag, gloves, coin purse,
etc.), but that these varieties are not species. The
accessory is a genus without species; its varieties
are part of other genera; it is, of course, implicitly opposed to the piece."

Could it be said any better? Now, doll, let's get
down to vestimentary business.

Dear Style Queen:
I've seen a lot of women around campus
wearing skirts and dresses over pants. What do
you think of this?
Trend-Spotting in Tarble
Dear Trend Spotting,
Now, doll, let's approach this conceptually.
The combination of skirts and pants represents a
rejection of gender binaries. Our cultural critics
would agree that a foray into interstitial space is

always a plus.
But do not take this as a cue to blindly mix
and match, dahling. If you are going to pair a
dress with pants, keep the hemline of the dress
high
at least above the knee. While a long,
flowing skirt surely provides a delicate cradle for
your dog-eared journal, and while its gentle folds
nicely billow in the breeze that blesses your
peace vigils, it is, when paired with pants, downright
frumpy. Excuse my frankness, doll, but I dare not risk
leading you astray in this matter.
Now, doll, be bold! Be colorful! Go into the world and

produce stylish offspring! With these last
words I relinquish the style throne. I depart, dahling, with
tears but also with joy, for I know that you will continue
the royal tradition.

For the rest of you, if you're going to watch TV, I suggest that you do yourself and all of us a favor and watch
"The Osbournes" instead of whatever other crap you
were planning to tune in to.
Without even trying to claim membership of the discerning culture elite, which would be pathetic and utter-

That's half the appeal of the show:
watching rock stars living like we do,
in some twisted collective sense of
the words "we" and "do."
First of all, and probably most importantly, you've got
Ozzy. That alone is worth a lot of ass-kicking points. The
man is a living legend and a genius. He was in Black
Sabbath, one of the only bands ever to do the apocalypse,
doom-and-gloom metal thing right, and, boy, did they do
it right.
After Black Sabbath, he did some more drugs, and,
famously, bit the head off a bat. Yes, it was a live bat. No,
he didn't know it was a live bat. Whether or not that
makes the whole thing more or less amazing is up to you.
Anyway, fast forward 20 years or so. He's now in his

May 2, 2002

fifties, off various substances, and almost emotionally
stable. I'm pretty sure he sucks as an artist now, but as a
person, he's everything good and graceful about aging
rock stars, the coolness inherent in rock stardom somewhat preserved, without the bloated patheticness of most
old rock guys (Page & Plant, anyone?).
Ozzy lives with his wife, Sharon, and two of his children, Kelly and Jack, in a recently acquired house in

California.
The show, in the ancient tradition of reality TV, follows the "real life" experiences of the Osbourne family.
On a given episode, you might see Sharon chastising one
of their seemingly infinite supply of little fluffy housepets for peeing on the rug, Ozzy incoherently lecturing
the kids about the dangers of drug abuse, or Kelly and
Jack squabbling over curfews and privileges like, well,
normal teenagers. And that's half the appeal of the show,
if that wasn't already obvious: watching rock stars living
like we do, in some twisted collective sense of the words
"we" and "do."
My parents are nothing like Sharon and Ozzy, and I'm
sure yours aren't either, as sad as that is. But our alienation from the concept of having a father known for biting the heads off small mammals is matched by our identification with a whole bunch of the minutiae of their
family life; they look, more or less, like we think a family should look. And that rules.
There is one, and only one, thing that bothers me about
the Osbournes, and that's the whole "reality" problem.

Summertime at the movies: a sneak peak

marks the dawning of two
potentially beautiful new eras. First, there's
the end of Swarthmore's spring 2002 semester as we know it, soon to be replaced shortly by three much-deserved months without
Swarthmore classes.
Then,
there is the beginning of
Hollywood's summer season, which could
take either of two dichotomous paths.
It could wow the world with a sudden
influx of insightful, well-crafted, fluid,
thought-provoking masterpieces that would
fully compensate for the last few months of
hardly worthwhile flicks.
On the other hand, it could further convince me that Hollywood films are a lost
cause, that the general public does truly
enjoy rotting its collective brain, and that I
should cut the ol' AMC umbilical cord, bidding fond farewell to overpriced popcorn and

From JONAH, pg. 14
I’m not taking credit for this observation, and I feel a

I feel for Ozzy and family, I am sometimes filled with an
even deeper fear: What if it’s all an act? What if Ozzy wears

his

death," or maybe just a game of chess.
I show up late, after frantically trying to do some lastminute remembering of a game I haven't played since fifth

where he went wrong, which might be asking too much.
Andrew, ever the silent, strong one, gestures toward his
now vulnerable queen. So I take it, of course, without
much second thought. This just allows Professor Grinstead
to gut the board, and he's left with enough pawns over me
that he's able to move one down the board and exchange it
for a queen.
"You might as well justresign now," his older son says.
I hold out for a bit longer, but eventually take his snide
advice after Grinstead trades another pawn for a queen. I
knock over my king, and I'm in a huff because I hate losing, but mostly I'm just relieved that the game is over.
Grinstead's older son, in lieu of doing his homework, has
written down all the moves from a certain point about
midway through the game, just in case I want to re-create
my tedious slow death. I think I'll pass.
So much for my streak. And that's it for the semester,

know, as per the rules of the game, it goes back and forth
for a bit as Grinstead tries to establish position and I try to
develop a stone-faced look of intense concentration that
might convince him I have a sophisticated understanding
of the implications of each move.
"Don't take a picture of the board. I'm sure we're
already off any established opening," Grinstead tells the
photographer, shattering any illusion I might have that he
actually considers me a formidable opponent. A few more
turns pass, though, I still haven't lost any pieces, and it
doesn't seem like I'm in danger of one of those trickster
seven-move checkmates, so I'm beginning to think that
maybe I'm a natural at chess, that maybe all the math and
science genes in my family didn't skip me over after all.
Then he starts cleaning up. First one pawn, then another,
and then this move that I think is really weird where he
moves both his rook and his king past one another into
adjacent squares, but which is apparently not even really
worth writing about because it should be so obvious and
elementary. His younger son starts loudly whispering
under his breath the moves his Pappy should play, even
though it's obviously me who needs the help.
"Take the horse," his son says. Professor Grinstead
takes his son's advice, and then, happy to take any opportunity to teach, immediately points out how that wasn't
the best move. I look around the board desperately. If it
was a bad move for him, that can only mean it was a good
move for me. A game-saving move, perhaps. All I have to

Homeschooled kids build robots
under tutelage of professor
From ROBOTICS, pg. 6
the robotics groups, homeschooled kids from
all over the Philadelphia area wanted to join,
and Everbach eventually had to cap the class
at 16.

These robots use "C" programming, which
is more advanced than the programming the
Lego robots used. Also, Swarthmore's robots
use different types of sensors to detect elements such as heat, light and sound. The boys
were able to write more advanced programs.
Each week, one of the boys would propose
a project, and the group would write a program to direct the robot. "Carr usually
reviews some programming languages, and
then we try to get a robot to do a task,"
explained Andrew Ashleigh, age 13.

"We'll either work on fixing an old program or write a new one," Unger said. "We'll
draw diagrams on the blackboard and experiment with the robot. Whenever we get stuck,
Professor Everbach will help us."

The boys had the robot obeying their
every whim: It followed a light beam, tracked
a piece of electrician's tape, and found its way
through a maze, among other things. One
week they even wrote a program to make the
robot dance. Just as in a regular class, they
had homework assignments throughout the
week, such as online readings, and were
allowed to come into Hicks and use the equipment during the week, as well.

Swarthmore police report
A Swarthmore College student
was arrested Monday for 500 counts
of sexual abuse, 506 counts of criminal use of a communication facility,
six counts of dissemination of child
pornography, and criminal attempt to
unlawfully contact or communicate
with a minor.
The investigation started when a
detective from Keene, N.H., contacted the Swarthmore Police
Department regarding e-mail contact the detective had with the student. The information was forward-

Each boy liked a particular aspect of the
class. "My favorite part of the class is seeing
if the program makes the robot do what we
want and then trying to fix the program if it
doesn't work," Ashleigh said.
Unger enjoyed many aspects of programming. "My favorite attributes of programming are editing and refining the program,
working with Professor Everbach and learning new ways to program," he said.

Most of the boys in the class are advanced
for their ages and were interested in the

Ed to Lieutenant David Peifer of the
Delaware County District Attorney's
Office. The investigation resulted in
the confiscation of a computer
used by the student and this
arrest.

On Monday, Sergeant Stufflet was

auto on Park Avenue. Investigation
revealed the vehicle had been stolen

group's challenging academic atmosphere.

One boy, Taylor Baggs, 14, came each weekfor
a different reason. His mother, Dori Baggs,
explained that he has learning disabilities
and "in the public school he was labeled and
dumped in special education, where his needs
went ignored and overlooked." She thought
that, although the class would be academically hard, he might get a lot out of being in a
positive, encouraging environment. He loved
the class and said that his favorite part was
"making the robot do new things."
Everbach isn't sure if the group will continue next year, but he has enjoyed working
with the boys. He was impressed with their
work and found that they were able to direct
themselves well. Many of his preconceived
notions about what to teach changed substantially. "The students' own interests and the
students' own questions have led us in many
different directions," he said.

Public Safety report
On Friday at 1 p.m., personal property was stolen from the DuPont parking lot.
On Tuesday at 7:14 a.m., a stereo
system was stolen from the main dining room in Sharpies.

On Tuesday, also at 7:14 a.m., a
few paintings were stolen from the
McCabe library. Although these two
crimes occurred at the same time,
Public Safety believes that these two
crimes were unrelated.

Help is sought for both humanitarian and commercial projects and
varied skill sets are needed, without there being any expectation that any
one person can "do it all." A key project aims at using the Internet to
improve relief supply delivery in Afghanistan, thereby providing America
with an opportunity to play an expanded, positive non-combat role.
Other projects focus on commercial markets for data exchange. The technical skills needed include: html & JavaScript coding, some use of
MS/Excel; also database programming in MS/ACCESS and/or MySQL;
also clip art graphics & CAD. Applicants are encouraged who can do some
of this, even if they cannot do all of it.

There is also potential for non-technical work for students who write
exceptionally well. If you plan a career in academia, this might be a
worthwhile opportunity to "get your feet wet" with grant application writing.

From UNDERCOVER, pg. 3
contributed to the arrest of 265 people in 43 states and 15
countries. The sting began in 1997, after a local incident
where "a woman was going online and seducing young
boys."

The department started seeking out Internet sex
offenders when it became clear that "our children were at
risk," McLaughlin said. "It was obvious that there were
crimes going on" on the Internet.
Due to the Internet's global nature, the operation has
been international in scope from its start. The United
States Justice Department funded it for two years but no
longer does.
McLaughlin

said there were about 30 similar task
forces around the country, working under the authority
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Customs
Office, the U.S. Postal Authority and local county and
state agencies, many of which the Justice Department
funds.
The detective would not comment on whether the pictures Boothe had sent him were of pre-pubescent or postpubescent minors. Depending on the ages of the minors
depicted, he said, "there's a difference in the pathology
and treatment that is rendered, but as far as the law is
concerned, there is no difference. If it's illegal product,
it's illegal product."

sible," Gross said. "I'm disappointed if in fact a
Swarthmore student had engaged in such behavior."
Goundie said Swarthmore will not take any action
until the legal system decides Boothe's case and that the
college will take its cue from the courts about the severity of the offenses.
"The critical thing is whether the person would be a
perceived threat to members of the college community,"
Gross said. "[Boothe] is not a threat to the college. If he
were, we would ban him from the campus."
Gross drew a distinction between crimes involving

computer files and crimes involving personal contact.
"He is not charged with any physical contact with
anyone," Gross said. "The fact of a 19-year-old having
Internet or phone contact with a 17- or even 15-year-old is
not something where you would call out the vigilantes."
Goundie said that, based on conversations with
Boothe, he is "confident" the student has stopped his
involvement with child pornography.
College officials learned in March that Boothe was
under investigation when Peifer and Officer William
Thomas of the Swarthmore police department removed
his computer, with his consent, from his room on
March 14.
Agent William Applegate of the Pennsylvania
Attorney General's Office for Forensic Examination has

been examining Boothe's computer since then. Officials
got a warrant to search Boothe's files on the college network, which they executed on April 1L That warrant said
that at the time he surrendered his personal computer
Boothe admitted to possessing and sending child pornography images, having phone sex with a 17-year-old male
and having a sexual conversation with detective James
McLaughlin of the Keene, N.H. police department, who

was posing as a 15-year-old male.

"He is not charged with any
physical contact with anyone."
Bob Gross '62
According to the arrest warrant, Applegate "discovimages of apparent child pornography,
which depicted children engaged in sexual acts or poses."
A child is defined by law as one who is under 18 years

ered over 500

of age.
The Phoenix withheld Boothe's name in two previous
articles because no charges were filed at the time, in
accordance with its policy on reporting names in crimi-

nal investigations.
Boothe's lawyer, Joseph Fioravanti of Media, declined
comment.

Bench-clearing brawl cuts

Further penalties for Buzzards unlikely;

last Saturday when the two teams became
entangled in an all-out brawl.
Twenty minutes into the second half
and with Swarthmore down by one try,
fullback Ted Chan 'O2 leveled an Albright
flanker, prompting the fight. Chan's hit
was a reaction to Albright's style of play,
which the Evil Buzzards deemed offensive

Montagnes and Chan, the University o

Albright for a match next year.

Rugby Union (EPRU) has issued no officia

but they might face some disciplinary
action."
After the fight, the Evil Buzzards decided to leave, because Albright's acting coach
told them that he could not ensure that the
Albright fans would remain under control.
"They had a bunch of fans on the side who
were drinking a little bit," Montagnes said.
"We felt that you have to get your fans
under control and the next [possible fight]
was going to be more serious."
According to Chan, his hit "was not the
only tackle of that type in the game, just
the best executed.
"I got a running start, anticipated his cut
perfectly, and did my best Rodney Harrison

impression, leaving my feet to deliver a
knockout shot. I think he rotated 270 degrees
and landed on his face," Chan added.
As satisfied as he was with the hit, Chan
would not be eager to play Albright again.
"It's a physical danger to play a team like
that," he said. "They're out to hit you, and
they're out to hit you with cheap shots."
"I was proud of the team," Montagnes
said. "We kept our cool and were mostly
concerned with ending and not prolonging
the fight. What happened on Saturday was
most definitely not rugby."
The Evil Buzzards will hold their annual alumni game this Saturday at 12 p.m. on
Cunningham Field.

Women's Ultimate
season closes with
loss to Haverford
BY KATHRYN JANTZ

kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
The Warmothers ended their season after losing to the Penn
State Isis and the Haverford Sneetches at regionals, a double-elimination tournament. Although the team is disappointed that it will
not have a repeat trip to nationals this year, the Warmothers' game
against the Isis was nothing to be ashamed of.
"I think we have come a really, really long way since spring

break. It just felt really good to play with the team," Alison
said. "It's not just a couple of star players, it's every-

one working together."
Although the game was the second of the day, following the
Warmothers' 15-7 defeat of Syracuse, the women made Penn fight
for the win. With Penn headed to nationals, this was no easy task.
The game was capped at an hour and 45 minutes and ended with a
score of 11-7. At halftime, though, Penn was feeling the heat, with
the score close at 8-6. Throughout the game, Swarthmore took the
lead at regular intervals. It was such a challenge for the teams to
score that as much as half an hour elapsed between points. This

loss put the women in the losing bracket against Haverford.
Sarah Kates-Chinoy 'O2 yet again proved her worth throughout
regionals weekend. According to Marah Gotcsik 'O2, "she played
amazingly in that game." Kates-Chinoy played regardless of a
shoulder injury for which she will undergo surgery on Friday. She
is a current nominee for the Callahan Award, which is awarded to
the nation's best Frisbee player after every team in the country

votes.
Also on Saturday, the Swarthmore women creamed both
Syracuse (15-7) and NYU (15-2). During the NYU game, Gotcsik
made a Callahan, or scored while playing defense. According to

play with. They put their hearts and souls into the game."
The women faced Haverford Sunday. With about six of its eight
starters suffering injuries and with only one sub available, the
squad was heavily disadvantaged from the start. After almost two
hours of play, Haverford closed out Swarthmore, 15-8.
Gotcsik said she "will miss playing with them. They are all phenomenal women, and I feel like we really ended on a high note."
Seniors Abby Lowther 'O2, Sarah Hoser 'O2, Kates-Chinoy and
Gotcsik will all be missed next year.

but lost to Julie Chalfant of Dickinson College 6-2, 5-7, 6-L "I had
beaten Julie before, but I wasn't playing at the top of my game,"
Pao said.

"Kristina played well," coach Sears said. "Julie made far fewer
mistakes than she did when Kristina beat her in our dual match at
home, but Kristina battled gamely to take the second set. She just
ran out of gas in the third set."
After storming through the Centennial Conference in her firstyear and sophomore seasons, Reddy is not resting on her laurels.
"I still have a lot of room for improvement. I'm working with my
coaches to improve aspects of my game and prepare for nationals."
Reddy is hoping that her performance in the Centennial
Conference will secure her a bid to NCAA Division 111 Nationals at
Briar College, Va. "I think it's looking pretty good. We'll just have
to wait and see if I get a spot," Reddy said.
After closing the season on a positive note, Reddy and the rest
of the team are awaiting another successful season next year. "We
had a lot of fun this season, and we're looking forward to next
year," Reddy said.
"This was a rebuilding year. Next year we'll be getting some
really good recruits and challenge for the Centennial Conference
title again," Pao said.

The Garnet finished their season last Saturday with a 10-4 win over Haverford in game two of their doubleheader. Matt Goldstein pitched a complete game, striking out eight and allowing only three earned
runs in his second victory of the season. Third basemen Ryan Pannorfi, who was 3-for-3 with three RBI,
and catcher Joe Corso, who belted a home run in his final collegiate game, led Swarthmore's offensive
attack. The Tide dropped the first game of the doubleheader 4-10, allowing six runs in the fourth inning.

Women's 4x400-meter
relay squad shines at
Univ. of Penn. Relays
Squad looks to secure a nationals bid
BY JUSTIN KANE
jkanel@swarthmore.edu

The women's 4x400-meter relay team of
Imo Akpan 'O2, Njideka Akunyili 'O4,
Elizabeth
Gardner 'O5
and
Claire
Hoverman 'O3 is well on its way to completing a sweep.
In February, the quartet blazed by its
competition at

Indoor Track

the Centennial Conference

& Field
Championships.
Last Thursday, the four women took the
Penn Relays title in the Middle Atlantic
Conference division.
This weekend, they head to Ursinus
College to stake their claim to dominance
at the Centennial Conference
Outdoor Track & Field
Championships.
Though the four are eager
to complete their sweep at
the championships, another
goal looms on the horizon. At
Penn, the team won the relay
in a school-record time of
4:00.23.
The time is slightly more
than a second off the NCAA
provisional qualifying time of 3:59.10, but
the team says qualifying is within sight.
"Conferences is one of our last chances
to qualify," Hoverman said. "The win at
Penn definitely gives us confidence, but
Western Maryland and Dickinson are close
at our heels and will remain good competition in the 4x400."
Western Maryland and Dickinson were
Swarthmore's closest competitors at the
Penn Relays and will likely be aiming to
avenge their losses. But Akpan said the
team will not rest on its laurels.
"It's a great feeling to help bring back
the huge plaque to Swarthmore after three
years. Winning the event was just a really
nice way for me to finish up at my last
Penn Relays," Akpan said. "I think this
puts us in a pretty good shape for the con-

ferences. I know the other teams are going
to put out their best performances, espe
cially because we won at the indoor confer
ences, but I know that we've trained reall
hard all season long and we can definitel
do this."
Members of the team also expect to far
well in individual competition.

Akpan currently holds the top times in

the conference (and NCAA provisiona
qualifying times) in both the 200-meter an

400-meter dashes, and she is ranked second
in long jump and the 100-meter dash, jus
0.22 seconds off the provisional qualifyin
time.

consistently. I didn't make many birdies, but I didn't
make many bogies either."
Kaufman got off to a quick start, moving just one
stroke off the lead and into second place with his firstround 76. On day two, he scored a 75, moving him into a
tie for first place with Matt McLaughlin of Gettysburg.
The two players wound up sharing Player of the Year
honors when the third round of the championships was
canceled due to poor weather conditions.
"I was one back after the first day, and I felt like I was

in really good position," Kaufman said. "I felt like if I
could just put a good number on the board and keep

myself in contention, I'd be in good shape for Sunday."
But it turned out that Sunday's play was canceled.
Asked if he would have changed his style of play on
Saturday had he known that would be the last day of the
tournament, Kaufman said, "I really probably would not
have done anything differently. The way that I play that
golf course is to play conservative golf. When you try to
get aggressive there, that's when you make bogies. What
I might have done is been more aggressive on my putting
game."
Kaufman's conservative approach proved beneficial.
He managed to avoid the marsh that lined both sides of
the course with controlled drives down the middle of the
fairway,

he said.

Putting was also challenging, as the greens were wet
and had especially long grass. But Kaufman managed to
keep his short game virtually mistake-free.
"The greens were a little slow, so it was hard to make

the 15 to 20-footers," he said. "But I had maybe only one
three-putt the whole weekend."
Geoff Hollinger 'O5 agreed that the greens were diffiso
cult. "There were two types of grasses on the green
...

it made a difference."
Hollinger chimed in with a 167, good for second on the
Swarthmore team and 17th overall. After a first-round 83,
he notched an 84 to finish out the tournament.
"The first day, I putted pretty well despite the slow
greens," Hollinger said. "The second day, I hit the ball
much better, but I had one bad hole," he said, referring to
the par four 16th.
Swarthmore finished fifth in a field of seven teams
behind Kaufman, Hollinger, and Matt Draper 'O5 and
James Dolan 'O2, who tied for 25th place.
"Matt is an excellent player, by far the best on the
team this year," Hollinger said. "He was disappointed
when he couldn't play on Sunday and win first place
alone." Kaufman finished fourth in the Centennial
Conference last year.

its hardest, neither team could punch in
the disc, each suffering from drops and
miscommunication. Then GW broke the
dry spell with a quick three-point run to go
up 14-11, a score reminiscent of the 'Worm's
sectional finals. Swat crawled back 14-13
before GW capitalized on their third game
point to take the game 15-13.
"We had a lot of drops," Slezak said.
"The weather affected us more than it

affected them."

The loss sent the 'Worms to the loser's
bracket, which meant a game with the
loser of the Penn State/Bucknell semifinal.
Swat headed to the next field expecting to
play their next game just 10 minutes after
the heartbreaking loss, only to find that the
two teams were still battling it out. Cold
and tired, the Earthworms watched for a
short while before heading to the vans for
dry clothes and some heat. An hour later,
the team faced Penn State. With game time
capped after an hour and a half, the 'Worms
had just 30 minutes to get up 7-6 before the
game was capped. The 'Worms handled
Penn State 9-7 to get to the backdoor finals.
The weather and the long games earlier
in the day took their toll on both teams'

play.

next in preparation for the national tournament on Memorial Day weekend.
From EARTHWORMS, pg 24.
"wildcard" bids the Metro East received
this year. The UPA gives out both "size
wildcards" to the largest regions and
"strength wildcards" to regions with the
strongest overall finishes at nationals the
previous year.
"This was the biggest year for the Metro
East," Misha Horowitz 'O3 said. "It's a very

competitive region, and there were seven
teams, maybe, with a legitimate shot at

nationals."
Swarthmore opened its campaign with a
15-4 win over No. 14 seed Haverford.
"They're a fun team to play against,"
Horowitz said. "They're good guys."
Next was a rematch of the sectional
finals: UPenn versus Swat.
As is usual for the 'Worms, the first half
was tight, with the two teams trading
points. Swat took the half 8-7, then stepped
up the intensity in the second half to take
the game 15-10. Horowitz and captain
Jeremy Slezak 'O2 cited the team's solid
team defense in the relative walkover.
"We played the best 'D' we've ever

played," Slezak said.

"We were pretty smart about keeping
the disc away from Jared [lnselmann 'o3],"
Horowitz said. "We were just really solid."
Inselmann is the key playmaker for the

Void, and the 'Worms defensive strategy
made the difference in the sectional finals.
The win was the fourth Earthworm victory
over the Void this season, and put Swat in
the semi-finalround early Sunday morning.
In the semis, the Earthworms faced No.
2 George Washington. Never having played
each other, both teams were uneasy going
into the game.
"They made some comments to our players on Saturday," Horowitz said. "It sounded like they were already intimidated."
The 'Worms left campus at 6 a.m. on
Sunday and got to the field almost a full
two hours before the 9 a.m. game.
"By the time the rest of the teams
showed up, including George Washington,
we had warmed up and were scrimmaging," captain Brandon Silverman '0 said.
Silverman said the early start allowed
the Earthworms some time to shake out
nerves and build up the intensity needed
for the game.
The weather, however, was not cooperative. Heavy rain and low temperatures limited both GW and Swat in the first half.
"Both teams were playing outstanding
'D'," said Slezak. "But there were also lots
of unforced turnovers on both sides."
GW took a shaky 8-7 lead in the first
half. After the break, both teams traded
points until GW led 11-10. With the rain at

"There were points in the game when
you could tell that whatever team just
wanted it more was going to take the
game." Silverman said.
The players also cited the lack of crowds
as a factor in the low intensity of the game.
"We were kind of thrown into Siberia,"
Silverman said.
The capped win put Swat back into contention for the third and final nationals bid
in the backdoor finals versus Maryland.
"They were coming off a big win,"
Horowitz said. Maryland beat UPenn 17-16
in the other backdoor semi.
"Everyone was getting really excited."
Slezak said. "It was the last chance to prove
that we deserved to go to nationals."
With a large crowd, the 'Worms dug

"We're just going to have
fun and enjoy our achievement."

themselves into an early hole when
Maryland gained a 3-1 lead before scrambling back to tie it up 3-3. The teams traded
points until Swat took the half 8-7. After the
break, the teams traded points.
"They just kept beating us on hucks,"
Horowitz said.
The game was tied 15-15, hardcapped at
17 when Maryland sent the disc up.
Horowitz was guarding the intended
receiver, and it looked liked Horowitz was
beaten.
"Misha layed out and just got the trailing edge to knock it away," Silverman said.

"We came back down and scored."
With a 16-15 lead, Swat pulled and
played intense defense, forcing Maryland
to keep dumping the disc of in the backfield. The 'Worms forced a drop about five
yards out of the endzone, according to
Slezak. Silverman grabbed the disc and the
'Worms cut out of their stack.
"Andrew Rosskamm ['o4] cut towards
the line, and three Maryland players went
with him," Horowitz said. "Paul Wulfsberg
['o3] and John Anderson ['o3] cut out on the
dark side and were wide open."
Silverman tossed up the disc, Anderson
and Wulfsberg both went up for it and
Wulfsberg grabbed it. But Silverman's
defender called him on a stall, forcing the
point to be called back. The 'Worms proceeded to run exactly the same play, with
Maryland reacting exactly the same way,
and Anderson caught the game-winner.
Both Silverman and Horowitz cited the
support of the 'Worms sideline as a key factor in the win.
"Every time we scored, they rushed the
field, and that fired us up even more,"

Silverman said.
"It was clear that intensity and sidelines was what was going to be the deciding
factor in the game," Horowitz said.
The weekend was a culmination of a
season's hard work.
"We ran our offense like we've been trying to run it all season." Horowitz said.
Silverman also said that the bid to
Nationals was a result of four year's hard
work on the part of the seniors. "My freshman year, nationals was just a pipe dream.
We literally lost every game at sectionals,"
Silverman said. "It'll be a huge achievement that we're at nationals."
Key
seniors on the field were
Silverman, Slezak, Michael Wollenberg,
Dan Schwartz, Pat Hagan and Rahul
Bhalodia. Silverman also mentioned Al Bui
'O2 and Dima Shchelokov 'O2.

Having achieved their goal of going to
Nationals, the team is looking forward to
enjoying the fruits of their labor.
"We're just going to have fun and enjoy
our achievement," Horowitz said.
Considering the size of the other schools
that will make the trip to Spokane, Wash.,
the fact that a small liberal arts college will
be attending is huge.
"Hopefully people will remember the
name Swarthmore College," Slezak said.
For others on the team, just getting to
Spokane is a goal. Silverman's oral honors
exams are scheduled for the first two days
of the tournament. He hopes to be able to
reschedule the exams: "Just to go" is his
personal goal.
Although the team has "some responsibility" to maintain the quality of the Metro
East's performance at nationals, they enter
the tournmaent with no expectations.
"The great thing about nationals is that
it's a complete no-pressure situation,"
Horowitz said. "We're definitely not the
favorites."

As the saying goes, there's no "I" in team. And if
you talk to the Earthworms men's Ultimate team,
they'll tell you the same thing.
Through outstanding team play, both defensive and
offensive, the team pushed its way through the losers'
bracket of the Metro East Regionals for the
Earthworms' first ever bid to the Ultimate Players
Association Collegiate Nationals.
After a narrow semifinal loss to George Washington
University on Sunday confined them to the losers'
bracket in the double-elimination tournament, the
Earthworms knocked off Penn State and Maryland to
win the bracket and to capture the region's third and
final bid to nationals.
The Earthworm's received the No. 3 seed at the
regional tournament after cruising to the championship at last weekend's Eastern Penn sectional tournament. A hard-fought finals battle with the UPenn
Void gave the 'Worms both the sectional title and the
No. 3 seed at the regional tournament. The top seed in
the region went to powerhouse Cornell University,
which won the Upstate New York sectional tourney,
and the second seed went to George Washington, the
winner of the Colonial section.
With Cornell expected to take the regional tournament and the region's automatic bid to the national
tournament, the 'Worms hoped to earn one of the two

Swarthmore co-captain Anjani Reddy 'O4 captured the
Centennial Conference Singles Championship by defeating
Ne'ko Browder 6-1, 6-3 in the Centennial Conference singles title match at the Mullan Center last Sunday. The AllAmerican from Ogden, Utah, captured her second consecutive conference championship and extended her undefeated streak in conference play to 30 matches.
"I was pleased with the way I played this tournament,"

Reddy said. "I played pretty well."
Reddy, the 2001 Centennial Conference Player of the
Year and top-seeded player in the draw, dropped only 14

games in her five matches en route to the singles title.
"Even though Anjani did not lose a set, this is more a
reflection of her solid preparation and ability to play an
all-around game than any weakness in her opposition,"
coach Dan Sears said.
Haverford and Bryn Mawr hosted the tournament, but
the final matches were played in the Mullan Tennis Center
due to wet conditions on Sunday. According to Reddy,
playing the final match at the Mullan Center was a huge
advantage. "My toughest match of the season was playing
away at Muhlenberg. I lost the first set, but came back to
win the next two," Reddy said. "It was a huge advantage to
play the semifinals and finals at the Mullan Center. I was
very familiar with the court and knew the way the ball

bounced."

Reddy also teamed up with co-captain Kristina Pao in
the doubles tournament. The top-seeded duo fell 8-2 to
Browder and Devon Hufnal of Washington College in the
semifinals. "Anjani and Kristina came up against Ne'ko
and a new partner, Devon Hufnal in the Semi-final," coach
Sears said. "They proved to be a difficult team to play,
because Ne'ko is explosive and Devon was very steady. We
had chances to finish points at the net, but they made some
gets, kept the point alive, and came out on top. We'll do better next time."

Pao advanced to the Round of 16 in the singles draw,
