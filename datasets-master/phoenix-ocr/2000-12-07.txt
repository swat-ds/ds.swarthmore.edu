LETTER

The irony of cutting SC vows to investigate ARC process
For the past few days, the approaching end to three
of Swarthmore's varsity sports teams has made the
college frazzled and frantic. Yet as the semester winds
down, the extremely heated disputes over whether the
college's decision was made in the right way and
of cutting football and
whether the outcome
wrestling and demoting badminton from varsity status
is in the best interests of Swarthmore and its
students seem far from ending.
There are several reasons why the Board of Managers' decision is causing such controversy. First, there is
the secrecy and independence that surrounded the
Athletic Review Committee from the very beginning.
Many members of the community, including students
and alumni, felt that the committee had not sought out
their opinions opinions about the place of athletics in
a college education that are often quite strong.
Second, in particular the decision to eliminate
football is being considered by a campus that is as
divided on the issue in the first place as was the
college's Board of Managers. Our college will no
longer be offering the sports many people want to play
here, and they are understandably angry. But there
are others in the student body who do not believe that
varsity football is compatible with the identity of
Swarthmore. The strong differences of opinion among
members of the student body (to say nothing of the
faculty or alumni) make it more difficult for dialogue
to happen. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact
that students who support the decision seem to be
even more publicly silent about their reasoning than
some of the administrators who made it were initially.
And the third reason the decision has caused such
controversy is the timing. The Board of Managers
decided to make a final decision, without any written
reports from the Athletic Review Committee, at its
meeting last weekend. That way, the board reasoned,
it could prevent the negative effects on recruiting and
morale of all sports that would have resulted if the
committee and board had been unclear longer about
which sports would be affected by proposed cuts. It
was an admirable goal, but the sudden decision
surprised everyone who had expected the issue to be
put off until the February meeting of the Board of
Managers.

The decision has incensed members of the teams
which are on the chopping block, but the hurt feelings
carry far beyond those three teams. Athletes who play
other sports are showing solidarity, confused by what
they see as an arbitrary decision. The decision has
delivered a blow to the morale of all teams and the
process by which it was made a similar blow to the
morale of most students.
Ultimately, what may be hardest for people to
handle is administrators' assertion that the decision is
in the long-term interests of the college and its athletic
program. The cuts may transfer resources like
admissions slots to other less-supported sports, but
many athletes feel that the cuts are a slap in the face
to all sports, regardless of which ones are directly
affected.
That solidarity is surprising in light of the muchdiscussed increasing specialization in sports, in which
Players concentrate on one rather than playing many.
As specialization continues to increase, it becomes
harder to field competitive teams at small colleges
but it also becomes harder and harder to offer the
opportunity to play varsity athletics to everyone if
those same small colleges decide not to offer the
varsity sports particular people happen to like the

best.

If that is the case, it would be hard to justify the

decision to cut football, wrestling and badminton to

improve the quality of the athletic program in general.
The decision could hamper diversity rather than help
it. President Al Bloom is right to note the irony in the
logic of cutting something in order to improve it. Now,
in light of that, he and the members of the Athletic
Review Committeeand Board of Managers who made
the decisions need to continue to explain why they
think their decision makes the most sense for the longterm health of the college and its athletic program.

Dear Editor:
As of 5:00 a.m. Wednesday morning,
Student Council has chosen to investigate what we recognize as possible
flaws in the decision-making process of
the Athletics Review Committee. Over
the course of the next week, we are trying to obtain, on behalf of the student
body, answers to the difficult questions
which have been raised since both the
Board of Managers' decision on Saturday and the initial formation of the
committee last fall. These concerns include, among other things, the lack of
sufficient student input and miscommunication concerning the timeline of
the ARC'S recommendation. If it turns
out that there are not, in our determination, satisfactory answers to these

questions, we plan to pursue a reexamination of the recommendation by the
ARC.
Since the board's decision was made
public, Student Council has been acting
solely on consensus and will continue
to do so in order to ensure the most legitimate and well-represented decisions
regarding this complicated topic.
It is important for the campus to realize thatearlier this fall, Student Council actively sought out the ARC in hopes
of incorporating a much wider representation of student opinion. However,
there were a variety of elements to the
timeline we discussed that were never
implemented, including student focus
groups and at least one Fireside Chat.
In our opinion, this is the most unfor-

tunate aspect of the ARC's proposal.
Allowing a recommendation of such
incredible magnitude to pass directly
over the heads of the student body was
irresponsible of the ARC and the current administration. It is our hope that
the administration will be willing to reexamine the current lines of commu-

nication that exist between the student

body, the administration, and the Board

of Managers. Members of Student
Council are elected to represent the
best interests of the student body; however, we can not accept that responsibility if this institution does not provide a concrete and meaningful way of
recognizing the interests of the student
body.

Council

Promises to current and future
students made, then broken
Dear Editor:
Half a century ago, my father played football for
Swarthmore College. A quarter of a century ago, two of my
brothers played football for Swarthmore College. My father
has remained one of the most dedicatedand loyal alums, cheering for the team at games and watching practice every day on
the hillside in front of the red barn. One warm fall afternoon
this past October, he and my mom took Philip, my five-yearold son, to watch practice. My son was so thrilled that he wore
his little football uniform, including pads and helmet. Some
of the players saw him and asked him to come down off the
hill and have a catch. Then one of the coaches came over and
asked him to join in the practice. It was a day that my son will

never forget.
Philip came home from practice beaming, saying, "Mommy,
I made the team!" Later that night, when he was tucked in his
bed, a picture of the Swarthmore College football team taped
to the wall above his pillow, he asked me if he could play football with the big boys at Swarthmore College when he grows
up. I told him yes, so long as he gets good grades and works
hard in school. He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
It was heartwarming to know that he had new heroes. Not

from the pages of a comic book, nor jumping at him from a
television screen. True flesh and blood heroes. And now?
I'd like President Al Bloom to explain to him why he
can't follow in his grandfather's footsteps, and those of his
Uncle Dave and Uncle Phil. Explain to him why he can't
aspire to be the scholar-athlete he dreamed of that night,
playing football for "his team." You explain it, President
Bloom, because I can't bear to break his heart.
Jean Raymond Tierno 'Bl

Administration turns its back
Dear Editor:

One of the reasons behind the decision to cut football,
wrestling and eliminate funding for badminton was to
maximize the competitiveness of those sports that will re-

main a part of the athletic program. What kind of studentathlete, however, would want to play sports at an institution that turns its back on hard working, dedicated student-athletes and reneges on promises?
Jay Schembs 'Ol

Decision process flawed by lack of discussion
Dear Editor:
It has always been a tenet at Swarthmore that important
decisions are made only after the entire Swarthmore community has been engaged in honest and thoughtful discussion,
keeping the best interests of the entire community at heart. It
has also been a tenet of our tradition that such decisions are
made only after a very strong consensus has been reached.
Decisions made without such consensus are very harmful,
indeed, unthinkable.
These conditions were not made with regard to the recommendations of the ARC. The single greatest intellectual resource the college has is its many thousands of alumni, the
vast majority of whom are committed to the college and its
values. Contrast this resource with a couple of thousand students, faculty, administration members, and Board members

that make up any current campus-centric portion of the
greater Swarthmore community. Contrast this resource
further with the composition of the ARC and the relatively
few people that were involved in this recommendation.
The whole decision process was flawed, and many honest people were misled through poor research and inadequate
reach to the Swarthmore community as a whole. To think
that in today's Internet world, the college would not use email, bulletin boards, forums, and chat rooms to involve the
extended Swarthmore community is incredible.
Finally, there was clearly no consensus at the Board
meetings this weekend in making the final decision. I am
stunned that the college's leaders would have acted in this

manner.

LETTER

College president should resign
Dear Editor:
On Sunday afternoon, I called for Al Bloom to resign as
president of Swarthmore College. Since then, friends and enemies have crawled out of the woodwork to applaud and condemn what I said. Although several students and administrators suggested that I retract what I said and apologize to Bloom
for saying it, I cannot do that. Instead, I hope to affirm and
clarify my position in the following paragraphs.
When I sat down to organize my thoughts, I wrote 750 words
about public trust and community values. After sitting
through Monday night's "fireside chat," I must completely restructure my argument. No longer will I contend that Bloom
lost the community's trust. Instead, I argue that he simply
does not have the leadership skills necessary to lead this col-

lege through times ofcrisis.
Leadership involves understanding the community to
whom you are responsible and knowing best how to communicate with members of that community. It also involves knowing about personal limits. Bloom has demonstrated none of
these qualities as he has dealt with the unfolding situation in
recent days.
When he first approached the college community with the
Board of Managers' decision, Bloom grossly underestimated
the dynamic of the student body and poorly prepared himself
for dealing with angry parents, students and alumni. He demonstrated that he is out of touch withthe values of the college
community, yet he pressed ahead with his original plan to
deal with the situation.

Instead of learning and adapting to the changed circumstances, Bloom decided it would suffice to paint himself as a victim of a mob-ocracy. At every turn since the horrendous meeting in the field house, Bloom has reminded students that events
are not proceeding as he had intended for them to proceed.
With all due respect, the road to hell is paved with good
intentions. Good leadership requires adapting to situations
as they unfold. Students have tried to express their concerns
to Bloom and other administrators. They have articulated

what bothers them about this process, and they have asked
many fair questions that deserve honest answers. Instead of
listening, however, Bloom has repeated the same glib answers
to difficult questions. He believes in the board's decision, and
he believes that by repeating the same lines over and over
again, students will, too.
To be honest, the decision is making more sense as more
information surfaces. However, the situation is not becoming
clear because of Bloom's repetition skills. Instead, some insightful comments made by Other participants at the Monday
night meeting are allowing students to make sense of the situation. While students, faculty, administrators and members
of the board are demonstrating the logic of the decision, Bloom
is repeating trite platitudes which make no difference to the
students of this college.
As painful as this may seem, Bloom does not have the skill
set necessary to guide the college community through this
situation. Therein lies the justification for my earlier call for
his resignation. Instead of working for us as a college president, he is trying to be a dean of students, an athletic director
and a public information officer. His failure to know his limits as an administrator and to trust the people around him
demonstrate that he is uniquely unqualified for the position

which he currently holds.
Perhaps my call for his resignation came too early in this
process and did not reflect an informed opinion. With that in
mind, I believe an ultimatum is now more appropriate: Dr.
Bloom, act like a college president, or resign as college president. There are people around you who know more than you
about this situation and who know more about how to effectively handle.this situation. Let them speak for you, and let
them dialogue with us. I promise you that everyone will be
happier with the results of that process than the current politicized mess you are dragging us through right now.

Bloom administration has too
much baggage to carrry on
Dear Editor:
As a parent of a recruited athlete, I'm afraid I share Neil
Austrian's conclusion that the Board of Managers' decision
to drop football and two other sports will have a negative effect on recruiting in all sports. Athletes at a school like
Swarthmore have a difficult enough time as it is maintaining
the level of self-respect and confidence necessary both to compete and to commit to the practice and workout schedule necessary to succeed. Now it gets tougher because the message
sent by the Board's decision tells those athletes that while
they're acceptable
they are to be marginalized, at least under the current administration.
It's a blinding glimpse of the obvious that most schools
Swarthmore is proud to group itself with academically and
culturally
the Amhersts, Williamses, Middleburys,
Haverfords and Wesleyans of the world, to say nothing of the
Ivy and Patriot Leagues—do not take this approach. And, since
many ofthe student-athlete prospects Swarthmore recruits are
also considering those schools, it's not too hard to imagine what
other coaches will tell them about Swarthmore and why they
would be less comfortable and unhappy
there.
There is a solution to this problem, I think. If President
Bloom truly believes this decision, which he apparently has
spearheaded, will ensure a rosier future for Swarthmore teams
and their members, then he must also realize that to achieve
that strategic outcome there must be new leadership in place
to implement it. If President Bloom's actions, in other words,
are selfless and not selfishly tied to a personal vision, thenhe
should step aside and allow a new administration the opportunity to rebuild the athletics program. The Bloom administration, unfortunately, will carry too much baggage to make
that possible.
Such a resignation would signify the kind of clear-sighted,
forward-thinking sensitivity and intelligence for which the

Swarthmore community is known. Given, however, that the
President —judging from his comments at the Sunday meetwas unable to wrap his mind around the simple fact
ing
that technology would spread word of the decision instantly
and universally, there seems to be little likelihood that this
more complex resolution will be undertaken, or understood.

Rush proves that hindsight is always 20/20
Dear Editor:

Thereal issueabout Saturday's decision is the process that
was followed. The decision was simply the final step in a process that was flawed from the beginning. Before anyone rushes
to judgment in either direction, it is critical that everyone
consider how we got here, and what this means for the present
and for the future.
On Friday and Saturday, theBoard ofManagers was presented
with a proposal from the Athletic Review Committee, which essentially said: Given that we want to aim for 15percent athletes,
here are the options for getting there. Managers than voted on
which option they felt would be best for the college. What no one
seems to have questioned is whether we should be aiming for 15
percent in the first place, or even how you classify a student. If
someone both plays football and sings, are they a singer or a
football player? It is these larger assumptions that went unchallenged, and they need to be addressed now.
Moving backwards in time, one must look at themission and
practices of the ARC. Why was the ARC originally formed, and
who pushed for its formation? Did the 30 members of the board

4

DECEMBER 07, 2000

THE PHOENIX

sit down together and unanimously decide that Swarthmore athletics needed to be re-examined and appoint the ARC, or was it
done at the urging of the faculty or administration? Second, besides thestudent representatives, was the opinion of the student
body as a whole ever solicited? For instance, why send out questionnaires if no one is ever going to tally them or look at the
result? Why ask people if they would be willing to be in a focus
group if there are not going to befocus groups?
We may not all like football or even think the school should
have a team. But we can all agree that there was something

inherently flawedabout the course ofaction that was followed.
If we are thinking about the long-term interest of the school,
why could this decision not have been made this time next

year, especiaUy if people felt rushed? Even if we agree with

the outcome, the procedural irregularities should make it
impossible for us to accept it. The process needs to be repeated,
this time actively involving students. While current students
should not be the school's only thought, we should at least be
taken into account, and not ignored as we were.

Conference concern:
Decision hurts Centennial schools
Dear Editor:
As a parent of a football player at another Centennial Conference school (Muhlenberg), I must tell
you how much the decision to end football at
Swarthmore will have a negative effect on the entire

college experience.
My daughter, who is a high school senior (and not
an athlete), would not apply to any school that did not
have a football team. My son, who is now a senior at
Muhlenberg, has often said that playing football in college has been the most enjoyable experience and the
best decision he has made in his life to date.
Your decision hurts the other schools in the conference, your own students andall those who may become
future Swarthmore students. It's worth rethinking.

James M. DePreta Sr.

Meaning of "student-athlete' ignored
Dear Editor:
As a parent of two college athletes, I am appalled
at the recent decision to abolish three sports at your
institution. The advantages and learning experiences
which athletes gain through intercollegiate athletics deserve continued support.
My son plays football at Dickinson College. I had
the opportunity to observe the Swarthmore team and

was impressed and amazed at the progress they have
made. They show class, enthusiasm and incredible
work ethic and are a credit to the institution of
Swarthmore. I truly believe that these qualities were
learned and enhanced through their participation in
the football program and are assets which will serve
them well in their lives after college. I implore those
involved to reconsider the decision.
Commitment is another treasured value learned
through dedication to a team and a program. The decisionis certainly not an example of commitment, and has
taught them instead a lesson in betrayal and mistrust.

A secondary issue is the impact the decision will
have on the conference as a whole. This is the height
of the recruiting season. I am sure that the negative
publicity generated from this action may impact a
high school athlete's decision to play in the Centennial Conference. This is a tragedy, as I believe the
Centennial Conference is a place where the true
meaning of "student-athlete" is fostered.
My son will be a senior next year. At this late date,
rescheduling a game in place of the Swarthmore game
wiU be difficult. As he ends his career, each game is
precious. Cutting football at Swarthmore may have
robbed all seniors in the conference of their opportunity to play a full schedule in the last year available to
them. I hope the decision will be reconsidered.

Judith A. Earley

Athletes valuable to every campus
Dear Editor:
I am a parent of a student-athlete at Dickinson
College. I have watched over the last three years as
[football] coach [Pete] Alvanos and his staff have
changed a perennial loser into a respectable program.
What the administration has done is nothing short
of criminal. PuUing the plug on a program because
the student-athletes are not in keeping with the image the college wants to portray is outrageous. The
athletes are not cretins, but positive forces on the
campus, as they are in all the Centennial Conference
schools. These young people are being cheated out of
a wonderful experience. Many were lied to by the
administration about the future of the sport at the
school. Finally, the administration violated one of the
most sacred ofall Quaker traditions, consensus.
Students and faculty, I hope you make the administration aware of your displeasure. Alumni, several
well-placed letters threatening to withhold endowment money might have a wanted effect.

Admissions pie must
Parents angered by board's decision
include ethnic diversity Teams enhance community Quaker commitment broken
Dear Editor:
On Monday evening at the fireside chat, Acting
Dean ofAdmissions Jim Bock '9O gave his rationale
for the 10 percent to 15 percent figure that the Athletic Review Committee settled on when deciding
what the maximum number of recruited athletes in
each incoming class should be.
His statement encapsulates my painful but necessary support for the cut. Among other things, he
said that reserving 30 percent ofeach incoming class
for slotted athletes makes it difficult for the college
to satisfy other community desires for diversity.
According to him, "When I was a student here, I could
count the number of black males on my two sets of
fingers." He also said a Hispanic community was simply absent just 10 years ago. The increased number
ofminorities that we have at Swat today did not come
about by chance. It tookthat kind ofhard work which
our coaches put into recruiting the many scholarathletes whom we are all proud of.
So the whole issue boils down to this: How can the
admissions pie be equitably distributed? Ifyou reserve
17 percent to 30 percent of the entering class for slotted athletes, you have to cut elsewhere or increase
the school's size. It is clear that the second option is
not possible. Up to 30 percent of 1300 students is high,
considering thewide range of students here. The only
sane and equitable course ofaction is to decrease athletics' lion's share. If the ARC had decided to cut four
other sports instead of football so as to meet the 10
percent to 15percent ceiling, I would still have strongly
supported the decision. The extra piece ofthe pie may
go to musicians. Currently, the orchestrahas only one
bass player. He graduates in a year. With a cut in slots
for varsity athletes, admissions can afford to recruit
a bass player. I am sure more examples abound.
So should we give the athletics program up to 30
percent of the pie or give a portion of it to minorities,
musicians and dancers? These kids spent justas much
time in high school pursuing these other interests as
athletes did playing and learning from sports.
Another advantage gained by cutting athletic varsity slots is that some of those slots can be given to racial minorities and students from incredibly poor economic backgrounds who, in spite of the obstacles
stacked against them, manage to persevere. If coaches
recruit with no restrictions on the intellectualachievement of potential scholar-athletes and I'm not talking about intellectual ability they could potentially
find minority students who qualify as "impact players." But this is when reality stares us in the face. Academically, Swarthmore is very hard. Recruiting without due regard for some minimumacademic preparation ensures thatrecruits will have a horrible time here.
The black community, for example, does as much
as it can to ensure that black students succeed. However, some situations just can't be helped. If you sit
in a computer science class as a freshman and you've
never used a computer before, the sheer scale of the
difference in prior knowledge between you and the
other well-prepared students may cause you to sink
into your seat. The hard reality is that it is difficult
but not impossible to find star minority athletes who
can cope with the academics at Swarthmore. The
difficulty of this task requires that it be left to the
admissions office. The kids in Harlem's RS. 100 who,
in spite of tremendous obstacles, manage to qualify
for Swat aren't likely to be captains of their basketball or football teams. This is a sad reality.
I am originally from Ghana, and after three years
as a guest in this country and two years of intense
personal study of African-American history, I have
come to realize, experience and agonize over these
and other issues relating to minority marginalization
in the United States. It is sad that the football team
got cut. It is unfortunate that wrestling has to go.
However, it's not about football nor badminton nor
even wrestling. It's all about the pie and, to me, how
much of it Asian, black and Latino students get. To a
large extent, simply by being a racial minority, a studentadds to the cultural richness of this institution.
Swarthmore must indeed swallow this bitter pill.

Dear Editor:
This is one of the few times I feel compelled to write to the
college as a parent. I am not a die-hard traditionalist who
considers the college football program to be untouchable,
undiscussable and a sacrosanct institution.
I am a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and never played any sport in high school or college. I firmly
believed then that sports program constituted a significant
diversion of mental resources, and schools were better off
without them.
I changed my mind during the period when my wife and I
were rearing our four children. In fact, now I strongly believe in and endorse sports programs in educational institutions. All of our children played varsity sports in their respective colleges: my son at Dartmouth, my second son at
Stanford, my daughter at Harvard, and now Matthew Asano
at Swarthmore. What they have in common is this simple
and sublimebeliefthat they cannot win alone. They need their
teammates.

If you observe Harvard, the bond between kids inthe same
class is strong, and much stronger if they played any varsity
sport. My daughter was accepted there, I believe, because of
her strong skill in ice hockey and not due to her academic
records. However, eventually she became the co-captain of
the women's ice hockey team, which in her senior year, lo
and behold, brought back the national championship. The tremendous celebration at Harvard included hundreds of nonsport students. She and her teammates brought something
valuable to the table, and I noticed that upon graduation they
are doing well and are advancing toward being leaders in the
community.
I believe that eliminating the football program, the centerpiece of any college sports program, destroys one of the
major pillars of the campus life. Attempting to build a college
on the basis of academic performance only will produce generations of very dull, risk-averse bureaucrats, which this
nation needs like a hole in the head.
Losing the center of sports activity on campus will lead to
general apathy toward the alma mater. The college will have
a chronic problem of raising funds from graduates, and this
in the long term negatively affects the viability of Swarthmore.
Whether participating or not, kids will always remember the
brilliant sunshine of a day in the fall when the football game
was fought and think of the college warmly.
Why not strive to build a college that produce generations
of bright, strong, team-oriented and risk-taking leadership? I

believe we can't do it without a football program. Restore the
football program.

Admissions sessions misleading
Dear Editor:
As a parent of a Swarthmore College student-athlete, I am
appalled at the recent decision to cut three athletic teams.
Swarthmore's major competitors for students, Amherst, Williams and the Ivy League, feel that football enhances their
student life. I feel I was misled by the campus tours and the
admission info sessions where athletics was touted as integral to student life. Haverford, Quaker consensus in action,
would never have made such a decision in a manner like the
Board of Managers did. Hopefully, this decision will be reviewed. Otherwise I am afraid that there will be an endowment problem and a fall in the rankings.

Dear Editor:
The short-term memory needed to honor the commitmen
and promise to rebuild thefootball program which was pledged
by Swarthmore College a short three years ago was glaringly
missing in its decision to drop the program Saturday. This com
mitment, coming from an institution with a strong Quaker back
ground and a strong academic reputation, brought 40 scholarathlete football players to Swarthmore. Now, without regard to
the effect on the lives of these student-athletes or superb coaching staff, without regard to the effect on the college's reputation
for commitment and without regard to the unusual process of
decision-making, this commitment has conveniently been ig
nored. Almost every current Swarthmore football player had
opportunities to attend other academically strong institutions
that have enjoyed more gridiron success in recent years. However, based on the college's promise and based on a confidence
in the new coaching staff, they chose to be part of a rebuilding
process. Now they are left out in the cold, with the saddest stu
dents being the juniors who most likely played the lastfootbal
game of their life without even knowing it.
The process that lead to this decision involved no significant student or alumni input. While the administration and
Board of Managers felt (correctly) that they had to make this
decision quickly for thesake ofeveryone involved, the decision
was not achieved by a consensus of the board, which is usually
a standard requirement at this Quaker institution. Instead of
requiring a consensus, a vote was taken and used as evidence
that the football program should be dropped. A lack of consen
sus for such a major change in the college should have negatec
the proposal to cut programs and kept the status quo.
The worrisome part of this decision-making process at
Swarthmore is that it implies that students who are in the
orchestra or newspaper or any other college extracurricular
activity had better beware because they may awaken one day
to find that their program has also been eliminated without
due process.
Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this momentous deci
sion is the "reason" given for the decision to drop the football program. Despite realizing, three years ago, what would be required
from an admissions-policy standpoint to rebuild the football program, the administration has now suddenly decided that this admissions policy would lead to a student population that is too topheavy with athletes (i.e., football players). The administrationnow
aims to have no greater than 10percent to 15 percent of its incom
ing class be athletes, which conveniently will not allow for the recruitment offootball players. The administration quietly and com
pletely ignored a proposal that would have maintained the football
program while requiring only 18 percent athletes in each class
Furthermore, they also consistently overlook the fact that the type
ofathlete choosing to attend Swarthmore almost always brings a
number of other non-athletic attributes to the college.
Finally, it needs to be noted that while Swarthmore College
is not keeping its side of the commitment, the players and the
coaching staff more thanmet theirpart of the bargain. The foot
ball program enjoyed its most successful season in years, win
ning four games, including two Centennial Conference games
and thefinal game ofthe season versus out-of-league rival Wash
ington and Lee. Swarthmore had eight players named to the
All-Centennial Conference team. This success was in large part
due to the excellent recruiting, coaching and inspirational lead
ership of coach Pete Alvanos and his staff.
This decision now significantly affects the lives of 50 young
scholar-athletes who haveinvested years in preparing and dream
ing about playing football at the college level. Many of these stu
dents will now transfer to other academically strong colleges with
even stronger football programs. This decision also significantly
affects the coaching staff and their families, who were promised by
the college a commitment to the
football program. Finally, this
■■
decision will have significan
negative effects on student life
the type of student who wil
choose to attend Swarthmore
and on alumni involvement. All
of this will happen solely to
make sure that the percentage
ofadmitted athletes in each class
■
can be dropped from 18percen
to no more than 15 percent. Nei
ther a Quaker promise, nor
Swarthmore College, may ever
be the same again.

Sports participation about self-improvement, dedication
Dear Editor:
I had a mostly wonderful experience at Swarthmore. This
letter springs from what was left over: the sideways glances
and cheap skepticism, the feeling that my dedication to a sport
was viewed as somehow less valid than dedication to other
pursuits, the resentment for a president, an administration
and a figurehead athletic director who fostered such blind
anti-athletic sentiment, the graciously accepted mediocrity,
unforgivable on a campus that won't accept mediocrity in
any other sphere.
President Al Bloom says "Our athletes ... don't bring each
of them two, three, four of these specializations. They can't,
right?" It seems he believes that athletes are incapable of en-

gaging in non-athletic activity. Prejudice like that set off weeks
of dialogue while I was at Swarthmore. But Bloom and his
administration have created a culture where such nonsense
is tolerated, where athletes feel the need to justify their presence at the school and to list their other activities. Despite
current protests to the contrary, athletes are not widely accepted at Swarthmore. The current rallies only tell me that
people are angry at having been left out of the decision-making process. They do not yet signal an acknowledgement that
the mingling of athletics, athletes and the campus as a whole
makes Swarthmore a richer community.
Some of my happiest moments at Swarthmore came on
the baseball field. It was something tangible that I excelled

in and I was proud to perform in front of friends and family, to share something meaningful with them. It was a
true social pleasure, entirely different from the personal
intellectual satisfaction I felt nearly everywhere else. Such
an unabashedly intellectual community could be thrilling,
but by the end of four years, I was just tired. And bored.
All I wanted to do was play ball and meet the people I'd
spent four years not meeting. I invited them to games.
There is so much self-satisfaction at Swarthmore, so much
dry inferiority that I can't imagine the campus not suffering enormously when joyfuland interactive social events
like athletics are eliminated.
Bloom says that it is impractical to maintain a team
that requires such large numbers. Maurice Eldridge says
it is impractical because studentsdon'tattend Swarthmore
to make it to the NFL. Stupid statements, but let's take
them at their word. But since when, exactly, has
Swarthmore been about practicality? Swarthmore is about
self-improvement. It produces brilliant graduates with no
better sense of what they want to do with their lives at
graduation then they had four years earlier. What is the
purpose of all this wonderful education if graduates, so
enamored of their own importance and thinking, spend
their post-graduation lives finding themselves because
they can't communicate in normal human interactions?
Maybe athletes do attend Swarthmore for the academics,

not to make the NFL. But if athletics make themfuller people,
why deny them the opportunity?
I'm truly disappointed in the result of the Athletic Review Committee. Why exactly was my mailboxcluttered with
appeals to vote for student representatives last year? Why
did I waste my time going to Captain's Council meetings
when the decision was so plainly predetermined? I'm guessing that Bloom's promise to revitalize the football program
three years ago had very little to do with student appeals
and everything to do with politics. I can only guess that
Bloom assumed [football coach Pete] Alvanos would not be
able to turn the program around, that apathy would increase,
and that axing football (his goal all along) would be simple.
He did not anticipate the passion ofAlvanos and the dedication of the players. I guess that's typical. Passion and dedication to athletics have no validity in his mind, so how could

he foresee this?
I feel so sorry for all my friends still involved in athletics
at Swarthmore. I feel especially sympathetic toward Alvanos
and his staff, who one day could be planning for the first
season in fifteen years as contenders and who the next day
are out of jobs. I will not forget such shabby backstabbing. I
just received the first of hopefully many paychecks in the
working world. Swarthmore College will never see a single
penny from them.

Cuts jeopardize Swarthmore way of life
College's fragile ecosystem at stake

Anti-athlete bigotry embarassing

Dear Editor:
I am very disappointed for the Swarthmore community
at the loss offootball and wrestling. Two contact sports have
been lost from a fragile community ecosystem and the impact will be felt for years to come. I was a varsity athlete on
both the football and wrestling teams during my undergraduate years, and coached wrestling as an assistant coach for
six years at Swarthmore and later as a head coach for four
years at Haverford College. This background in the athletic
departments at both schools gives me a unique perspective.
What Swarthmore has to look forward to is a community
ecosystem that will grow more similar to Haverford's. Football was dropped in 1972 and wrestling struggled and was
lost in 1989 and again in 1997. Today, Haverford offers us a
rare crystal ball into our own future.

Dear Editor:
I'm saddened thatSwarthmore dropped wrestling and football and demoted badminton. I was a wrestler and would not
have chosen a college that did not provide that opportunity
for me. I think about all of the great people I wouldn't have
met had I not gone to Swarthmore, and all the multi-dimensional athletes I befriended.
I'm distressedby the implicit message that scholar-athletes
are less deserving and somehow detrimentalto the Swarthmore
community and deserving ofa constraining quota. On the contrary, I remember many other gifted and disciplined students
who were assets to the community, participants and leaders in
varied non-athletic activities, and also athletes. In my
Swarthmore experience, the community was better for the effort at diversity. The feeling of some on campus that there are
"too many athletes" is embarrassing, shallow and wrong.
I'm embarrassed by the spectacle of the administration trying to keep the media and the public out of the meeting on Sunday, and in general Swarthmore's slidetoward mediocrity, even

I predict that Swarthmore athletics will decline to join the
level of Haverford's (with all due apologies to their track programs and any otherrecent successes they have enjoyed against
theirrival Red Bellies). This will be largely a consequence of
the loss of community diversity in athletics. As a result, the
community attitude towards athletics will change subtly and
negatively impact recruitmentand the admission yield process.

Haverford has a less intense "vibe" in its athletic community,
hasfarfewer men engaged in full contact sports and has a lower
expectation ofand by students involved in athletic pursuits.
This ecosystem has made it very difficult to recruit and
retain athletes used to a high-performance environment. And
this has been one ofSwarthmore's great advantages: a highperformance environment at all levels.
So as the Board of Managers and the president posture the
endof football, wrestling andbadminton to the community as a
way to spread the 15-percent athletic quota around a small and
highly selective admission pool, I counter that the admissions
yield will no longer contain the very athletes we hoped to add to
our community of diversity. The yield will be more homogeneous and of lesser stature. As these top men and women athleteslook at colleges and universities for the performance environment they are comfortable in, one that is greatly enhanced

by contact sports, they will pass Swarthmore by.
Following the pattern at Haverford, Swarthmore will see
a change in the ecosystem of the community. No longer will
I be able to so easily define the two schools by their differences (certainly their similarities were always too close to
ascribe). As I approach my 20th reunion, I regret this change
and expect it to be fully evident before my 30th reunion.
Oh, by the way, I expect U.S. News & World Report will
find the schools more similar as well. We may need to get
used to being number four or five, like our other peers, without the 110- and 67-year traditions of football and wrestling.

toward effetely-democratic non-consensual decision-making.
I'm perplexed that they would have dropped two fine, relatively inexpensive sports that provide excellent opportunities for individual athletes. Compared to "true" team sports, I
would think that wrestling and badminton, like track and
field, swimming, tennis, golf and cross country, are perfect

for a small school like Swarthmore, where individuals can
flourish even if it is an off-year (or -years) for the team.
I'm fearful that Swarthmore will become too esoteric, more
ordinary and less influential withoutthe diversity offootball
players and wrestlers. I also worry that fund-raising will wane
now that the college has finally, completely, alienated the very
group of alumni most likely to become "captains of industry," to amass dorm-building fortunes. The football players
from the early 1980s were already lost due to the last ugly
episode of anti-athlete bigotry. I expect that Thomases
Hallowell and McCabe are spinning in their graves.
I'm chastened by understanding that there are facts I don't
know and that there were seemingly logical reasons for each
step in the process. For example, I understand that it made sense
to make a decision now rather than later so that other sports
could recruit and proceed. I understand that comparisons to
Williams aren't completely apt, since they have many more students. My hope is that perhaps the problems that the committee

was trying to solve were not as severe as imagined. Either way,
I'm trying to separate the decisions from the decision-makers,
and I hope that the decision-makers made a good faith effort.
I'm melancholy, tearful really, about all the anguish and
wrenching pain that so many on campus are feeling right
now. I wish I could make it go away.

Football cut damages
Centennial Conference
Dear Editor:
Swarthmore's decision to eliminate football and
two other athletic programs is not merely an "internal" matter. Aside from the personal devastation
caused to Swarthmore's players, parents, some
alumni and fans by this decision, the college has dealt
a blow to the entire Centennial Conference. In joining and actually helping to found the conference not
so long ago, the college made a commitment that included fielding a football team available for competition with its sister and brother schools. Swarthmore
has breached its responsibility to each school in the
conference, and its remaining teams shouldbe forced
by the Conference to find another place to play. Why
should the college's administration be able, unilaterally and with impunity, to pick and choose its level
of participation in the conference? Other schools in
the Conference without football were admitted with
acceptance of that fact up front.
The following statement from the "History of the
Centennial Conference" Web page is instructive. Presumably, as a conference member, Swarthmore agreed
to "encourage athletic competition among nationalliberal arts colleges and universities that share similar
academic aspirations and a commitment to the importance of the total educational experience of students
engaged in sports. Intercollegiate athletics programs
are an integral part of the life of the member institutions and flow from their educational objectives. Each
institution provides a comprehensive, broad-based athletics program. All varsity sports are treated equitably, and every sport is important."
If the Swarthmore College program had "withered
on the vine" for lack of interest, it would be understandable to kill it but it survived and then began
to thrive despite its down times. Three or so fewer
admissions "slots" for football each year would not

prevent success on the field. The Swarthmore football program actually became this year a true inspiration to the followers of the Centennial Conference
and more so, to its players. It also showed that a premier academic institution could produce a good football team in the best sense of what Division 111 is sup-

posed to be about.
I urge you to make every effort to reverse the decision to eliminate your football, wrestling and bad-

minton programs.

Administration
made right call
Dear Editor:
Kudos to the administration and the Board of Managers for
finally abolishing the Swarthmore football program. Allocating
one in six male slots in every incoming class to football players
was unfair; the de facto football admissions quota worked against
the very diversity that it was intended to promote. Al Bloom deserves accolades, not derision, for making a politically difficult
decision that will benefit Swarthmore for years to come.
Geoff Anisman 'OO

Decision right for other teams
Dear Editor:
It just breaks my heart to see the picture of Al Bloom duking it
out with Cruella the newscaster. He works so hard, and now this? I
think it's disappointing that Swarthmore's resources are so limited
that they must cut some student activities, but frankly I agree with
theBoard ofManagers' decision. I ran cross-country for threeyears
and noticed that thefootball team rode in "motor coaches" to games
and got large food allowances while we traveled in vans driven erratically by fellow students and ate boxed lunches from Sharpies
consisting of turkey sandwiches on white bread to be washeddown
with graham crackers. Maintaining a football team at Swarthmore
is a vestige of the so-called happy days of the 20th century.
As a Quaker, I must also note that Swarthmore is not officially
associated with Quakers anymore, and generally does not use consensus-style decision making. Before the Swarthmore community
jumps all over the BOM for departing from consensus, I'd like to
see the Student Council try it for a month. On a side note, kudos to
The Phoenix for turning into a fabulous student newspaper. I read
the online version all the time. When I was at Swarthmore we
didn't have a newspaper for a semester when The Phoenix staff
tried disguising apathy as a political statement.
Amy Klosterman '97

Debate has been one-sided
Dear Editor:
In the last few days, it has been the students, not the administration, who have set a dangerous precedent at Swarthmore. A group
ofstudents haverushed to judgement withoutall the facts and have
quieted the voices of a large number of students who agree or partially agree with thedecision of the administration and the Athletic
Review Committee. At the fireside chat last night, I was struck by
the currents of hostility among the crowd. I have believed
Swarthmore students to beattentive to two principles in their search
for truth: gathering all ofthe informationnecessary to form an opinionand valuing an honest, open debatebetween differing viewpoints.
Neither ofthese principles have been operating in the students' reaction to the board's decision.
It will take some time for the administration and the ARC to
communicate and defend their decision-making process and explain
the reasoning behind the conclusions. Until they have done so, it is
grossly unfair for students to jump to conclusions about the motives and actions of theadministration and theARC. The anger and
hurt of the athletes who have been affected by this decision is understandable. However, when students' passion overrides their respect and when the same questions are asked repeatedly (presumably in the search for an agreeable answer), the administration and
ARC are prohibited from explaining themselves.
The facade of unanimity that students repeatedly tried to hold
up Monday night was also troubling. Not all the students who were
present at the chat disagreed with the administration's decision. I
think we, as a student body, are all to blame for their silence. To
those who were silent about this issue both last night and during
the past few days (including myself), I say shame on us. We should
stand up when we feel as though our opinions are being ignored. To
those who have been trying to strong-arm the student body into a
consensus against the administration, I say shame on you, too. As
the loudest voice so far in this debate and as a part of the Swarthmore
community, you have a responsibility to recognize that there are
students who do not agree with you and to engage them in debate.
I realize that the first reaction of many people to what I have
written will be anger. That's okay. But I beg you —-1 beg all ofus
please take a deep breath, count to 10 and realize that anger both
against the administration and against our fellow students will get
us nowhere. Honest, open debate which takes into account all of the
facts, is the only way productive changeand understanding can be
reached and I thought, until now, the only way at Swarthmore.
Elizabeth Hansen 'O2

Board of Managers decision flawed
Dear Editor:
Since the recent actions of the Board of Managers
fail to cloak the true motivations of such a move, why
continue to beleaguer a do-nothing group of deans, a
ratings-hungry presidency and an aloof BOM with sitins and protests? Certainly such retaliation is understandable, but clearly if one recognizes the manner in
which this decision was made, he or she will also realize that the current "dialogue" about the issue is only a
form of damage control and not of earnest consideration.
The school has become intensely focused on it prevailing in its seesaw relationship with Amherst for the
No. 1 slot in the rankings system. Such an attitude pervades the decisions ofthe administration and the board.
However, they remain within their rights to form unilateral pronouncements on the direction of their school.
And of course, students may exercise their right to protest in any way they choose.
Instead of drawing from the familiar playbook of vigils and sit-ins, why not address the real forum ofinterest
to the board and administration? Organize a letter-writing campaign to U.S. News World Report about your
concerns, and while you're at it, write to the guidance counselors of heavily-targeted high schools and give them a
fuller picture of whatthe climate at Swarthmore is really
like. Best of all, perhaps danger in the sensitive area of
rankings will give the BOM a good reason to reconsider
what course they shouldtake if it seems what they've done
is going to jeopardize what they were trying to achieve.

Online coverage useful to distant alums
Dear Editor:
Thanks for getting together a great set ofarticles about
the athletics decision so quickly. It is nice for alums outside of the Philly area to be able to keep up with these
decisions. I am saddened at the way in which the decision to cut football, badminton and wrestling was made,
without a consensus from the board. I am also troubled
that alumni input in this decision was not sought.
Joanna Vondrasek '94

Decision defies reason
Dear Editor:
As a student I attended many ofthefootball team's games
during a period of time when most of those games were
losses. Frequently the weather was cold and miserable, the
players obviously disgusted by their own play and the student attendance sparse. If, when I graduated, the boardhad
then voted to eliminate the team, I wouldhavefound it much
harder to argue. I was proud ofSwarthmore's long and storied football tradition,proud to walk by the pictures ofpast
championships en route to games. But I could have understood the argument that Swarthmore was too smalland overmatched to support a successful Division 111football team.
Instead, Bloom and other college administrators reassured coach Pete Alvanos, the returning players and
the college community as a whole that the college's commitment to the football team was stronger and surer than
ever. It cheered me to think that the team would be worthwhile again, and I think the college's efforts were successful in that respect.
In both The Phoenix and the Philadelphia Inquirer,
it has been reported that the board voted to eliminate
football in particular because ofthe fear that Swarthmore
was admitting "too many athletes." To say that athletics
subtracts from Swarthmore's goal ofacademic excellence
is not only ridiculous, it flies in the face of college policy.
If Swarthmore fears having "too many athletes," why
does it have a physical education requirement?
The treatment of Alvanos, of the current football players and of future Swarthmore students
who may have
applied early decision based on the assumption that their
school would have a football team
by the Board of Managers and by the college administration has been dishonest, contemptuous and unworthy of the Swarthmore name.
Although I was very happy at Swarthmore, I see little
reason to associate myselffinanciallywith an institution that
treats its students, employees andalumni so shabbily. I care
very much about Swarthmore and would hate to see a place
I knew to be open-minded and thoughtful descend into elitist, judgmental snobbery. It would do everyone a world of
good if the BOM wouldreconsider its hasty decision.
Jessica L. Harbour '99

Board must reconsider with more input
Dear Editor:
I am ashamed that President Bloom and the Board of
Managers have so blatantly disregarded the values that
Swarthmore has always held high and that I myself have
always treasured in this school: respect for others, willingness to listen to their opinions and desire for consensus. I urge the Board of Managers and President
Bloom to immediately rescind their decision and to
gather opinion from the student, faculty, parent and
alumni communities before reconsidering the options.
I, and others, are interested to hear and consider the arguments in favor ofeliminationof the teams, but I am deeply
angry over this decision when it is presented as a fait accompli. Should the Board refuse to reconsider, I cannot in
good conscience financially support an institution that so
willingly disregards the opinions of its members, and I urge
other alumni, students and parents to do the same.
Ethan Friedman '99

Outcomes not considered seriously
Dear Editor:
Congratulations on a well-written editorial. As a former
wrestler and proud Swarthmore alum, the decision to terminate threesports programs obviously outrages me. Several points have been made already: that the lack of consensus was unprecedented, that the quality of life for student athletes will diminish. But I think something else
needs to be noted
my teammates in the wrestling program were excellent students and true intellectuals. How
many of them, like me, chose Swarthmore, apart from other
top-notch colleges, because of the athletic opportunities.
In 1992, the day I heard Haverford cancelled its wrestling
program, I cancelled my application.
Hopefully, returning to stronger Quaker principles,
the Board of Managers will spend more time in contemplation of the gravity of their shortsighted decision.

Matt Miller '96

Sustaining program not Unfeasible'
Dear Editor:
PresidentBloom wrote that to assure the competitiveness
of all 24 of our intercollegiate teams, the college would need
to recruit approximately one-third of the 370 students in each
class as athletes. He believes that that level of allocation to
athletic talent in the admission process isn't feasible.
This is an interesting statement in light of a recent article about Williams College and their athletic programs that
appeared in Sports Illustrated (Nov. 27). While Swarthmore
thinks it is "infeasible" to recruit athletes for its 24 sports,
the article points out that Williams gets 40 percent participation for its 31 intercollegiate sports. It is apparent that
recruiting 30 percent athletes out of Swarthmore's admitting classes is not only feasible, but it wouldn't even come
close to matching Williams. Amherst gets 32 percent intercollegiate participation for 27 teams out of 1600 students.
Since Amherst is No. 1 in the U.S. News ranking, and
Williams is a close No. 3 to Swarthmore, it is clear that
President Bloom and anyone else who doubts the feasibility of recruiting the proper number of student-athletes is
flat wrong. Swarthmore supports fewer teams andrecruits
fewer athletes (and wins less games by accordance) than
its two closest rivals. Yet Swarthmore is the only school
crying the blues about not being able sustain its athletic
programs. What are Amherst and Williams doing that we
can't do? I'll wager that they are not smarter than we are,
but rather they simply value theirathletic programs more
than Swarthmore does. This is not an issue of feasibility
it's an issue of commitment.
If the ARC is considering reducing sports teams at
Swarthmore, it shouldn't use terms like "infeasible" and "too
costly" and phrases like "we can't support properly" and
"we can't be competitive." Don't insult the current studentathletes and the alumni who played before them by using
"can't do" terms that athletes ignore in the face of competition. Please admit then that Swarthmore is simply not committed to intercollegiate athletics like its elite peers and is
willing to allow its diverse culture to suffer the loss of future student-athletes who will clearly choose an Amherst
or Williams over Swarthmore. Maintain the integrity that
we all deserve within the Swarthmore College community.

'My hard work was only an experiment'

Civility a plus
Dear Editor:

Dear Editor:
In the aftermath of the recent cuts in varsity athletics, many
members of this college, both students and faculty who are
unsympathetic to the student-athletes whose teams were cut,
have claimed that the rally and press conference were gross
overreactions. Furthermore, they claim the student-athletes
were not mistreated, but the administration was completely
within its rights to make this decision, as difficult as it is for
some to accept. Those members of this community are misled
and uninformed.
Leave aside the Board of Managers' unusual, if not unprecedented, decision-making process. Leave aside the lack of student input in this decision. The reason for my anger, for the
anger of my teammates and the other student-athletes, and for
the anger of our coaches, is that we were betrayed by the college. We were promised the support of the college, from both
the BOM and the president, and we believed this promise. Because of this promise, we threw ourselves, body and soul, into
our particular sports. Each member of these teams has given
blood, sweat and tears, and has done it not only for their own
glory and personal gratification, but for the glory ofthe school.
Again, many people who have not participated in organized
sports at the collegiate level, or even at the high school level,
might claim that this is a grandiose and hyperbolized claim.
Nevertheless, it is thetruth. Athletes bring the school honor and
distinction, just as a student who writes a brilliant and acclaimed
computer program or creates a stunning and moving piece ofart
does. To be a top school, we must be distinguished in all areas,
not just academics. So week after week, month after month, we,
the student-athletes, work to make ourselves better so that we
can better contribute to the school. Having given all that to the
school, we are now told that our contributions were sub-par and
unappreciated. We have been stabbed in the back.
I cannot accurately relate the feelings and experiences of
others, so I will explain my own experiences with athletics at
Swarthmore. My senior year of high school, I was recruited
to play football at Harvard, Yale, Amherst, Williams and
Swarthmore. I was told by each of these coaches that I would
more than likely be admitted to his college without any help
from the football program, and so I felt confident that I had
my choice of schools. I chose to apply early decision to
Swarthmore only after a phone conversation with Robin
Mamlet, who was at that time Dean of Admissions. She said
that she had been told that the football team had the full support of the BOM and the president, and that if I wanted, the
chair of the BOM, Larry Shane (the same man who explained
the reasons for cutting my team), would call me to assure me
that I would be playing football for all four years at
Swarthmore. I decided that I did not need that phone call: I
trusted the college. The confidence in my future school and
the head of the board was sadly misplaced; after the official
announcement that football had been cut, I managed to get a
private word with Larry Shane. I reminded him ofhis promise that I would have four years offootball at Swarthmore, to
which he simply replied, "Things change."

Since coming here, I have played through injuries, through
two difficult years, and finally, through this last year of excitement and tangible results. Football has been the dominating force in my life here, and the activity for which I have
had the most passion (although I also participate in the honors program, the drama program, the Sexual Health Counselors, the PA program, Delta Upsilon Fraternity and two other
varsity sports).
Now, after finally seeing my hard work, and the hard work
of so many of my closest friends, bearing fruitful results, I
am told that the promise I was given before my application to
this college was a lie. I have been told that my hard work and
dedication was only an experiment, an experiment that has
been deemed a failure. I have been told that I am an unnecessary part of this college by the very people who put their word
on the line to get me to come to Swarthmore. In consequence,
I think it is beyond dispute that the honor of both President
Bloom and Larry Shane is compromised, and I feel that I and
all the other athletes have been willingly, frivolously and cravenly betrayed.

Athletes vital to Swat community
Dear Editor:
Athletics add an important and irreplaceable element to
Swat. What we will gain from eliminating football, badminton and wrestling in terms of admissions slots and money
will not make up for losing a bunch of vibrant, intelligent
students who take part in nearly every student organization,
as well as being the primary members in several others. The
message such an action would send is that team work that
can't be learnedfrom group projects in class is unimportant,
that the ability and inclination to play a musical instrument,
to study engineering or to involve oneself heavily in the theater is arbitrarily more important than the ability or inclination to play one or more varsity sports.
Swat athletes are not merely athletes. They are members
of nearly every club on campus. They are RAs, members of
Housing Committee, a cappella groups, and countless other
groups. They study hard, get as good grades as the rest of us,
major in everything from history to chemistry and yet find
the time to be among the most vibrant contributors to Swat's
social scene.
If these teams are eliminated, we will have taken a huge
and important step toward validating the myth that all
Swatties do is study. This is not because nobody throws parties besides athletes, but because Swat athletes are all interestingpeople who add an element of diversity to Swat society
that cannot be matched by any number ofnon-athletes. With
so many fewer people representing a much smaller range of
interests, there will be so much less to do besides go to McCabe
and study.

We should turn to Quaker values to conclude this saga
Dear Editor:
Over the last three days, I have heard terms like 'consensus,' 'Quaker values' and 'respect' talked about as if they were
mere terms in a politician's lexicon, as transcendental as campaign promises. What I heard standing on the floor ofTarble
Pavilion Sunday afternoon were these terms shouted and
jeered, amidst a scene of confrontation with condescension
on one side and utter hatred on the other. It is one of the most
un-Quakerly things I have seen in my life, and certainly the
most un-Swarthmorean.
Quaker values do not only imply certain procedures, they
concern an entire way of living. As such, the intent for which we
act is as important as the act itself. Consensus does not mean
anything without the intent to find the truth by moving away
from a language ofinterest. Operating by consensus in Quaker
fashion, properly understood, does not mean deadlock in the presence of disagreement, it is a process by which an issue is discussed hour upon hour untildissenters persuade, are persuaded
or choose to step back for the greater good of the community.
I'm not sure whether Swarthmore really holds to its Quaker
roots, and I was trying to figure it out based on my experience
as a Friend and a Swarthmore student. Many, many institutions and practices do not follow practices of the Society of

Friends. (If they all did, the Board of Managers itself wouldbe
constituted ofmembers freely elected for their commitment to
the community and its values, not for wealth, power and influence.) I am not sure whether those who are worriedabout board
procedures would like to go that far, knowing that Neil Austrian may not even be on a Quakerly board. I'm not completely
sure whether I would advocate this either, simply because I
have no alternative plan to present. We'd also have to be constantly mindful of Quaker testimonies in our daily lives: the
Peace Testimony, Truth-telling and fundamental respect for all
humanity through belief in the InnerLight, all of which would
make us almost illiberal in our dedication.
The part of Swarthmore that is fundamentally Quaker is
our practice ofinformed discussion, trust and respect: something that I see on campus every day here and that I saw
crushed at the Sunday meeting, by both the administration
and the audience. These are the values that are important
and need active protection. This is the only way to resolve
this mess of entangled interests. Quakers are told to 'proceed
as the Way opens.' That is what we must do now, to decide as
a community how best to conclude this and help those who
are hurt by it.

I left Monday night's Fireside Chat with much
more respect for virtually everyone there.
I gained respect for the football team (and other
athletes) who sat down and listened to the people behind the mike, and who asked their questions peacefully. I gained respect for the non-football athletes
who were passionately supportive of the team, saying that they didn't necessarily want to benefit from
someone else's misfortune.
I gained respect for the students who ran the chat:
Brandon Silverman, whorefused to be intimidated by
anyone twice as big as himself, and Jordan Brackett,
who set up a fair organizational structure.
I gained respect for Delonte Gholston, our Board of
Managers observer.We're lucky to have him, and so is
the board. He madeit clear in his speech that there is a
middle ground between demonizing the boardand perhaps disagreeing with eithertheirprocess or their ultimate decision, something the campus needed to hear.
JennieKeith and Al
I gained respect for yes
Bloom, who showedthat they are not insensitive jerks,
but rather intelligent and caring people who are, let's
face it, the ones stuck as scapegoats for an unpopular
decision which they nevertheless did make in a clearheaded, though perhaps rushed, fashion.
I gained respect for JimBock '9O from Admissions,
who again seems to be a man trying to both do his
job for the college as a whole and also to sympathize
with individual students, which appears to be practically impossible in this situation.
I gained respect for Allan Symonette '76, and by extension the rest of the board who participated in this
decision. It was his voice I came to hear. I wanted to
know how previously undecided board members had
come to their decision, and he gave me that information. He was thoughtful, rational and candid, and I hope
that whether anyone agrees with his (and the board's)
decision or not will not influence judgments about his

(or the other board members') personal integrity.
Thanks, everyone. I think I can safely say
without expressing my views on the cause of the controversy
that I'm glad to be here.

Voicing needs requires unity
Dear Editor:
Like most students, I was stunned last Saturday
evening when two football players knocked on my door
and told me their sport, along with wrestling and
women's badminton, had been cut by the Board of Managers. There was a note of sorrow and resignation in
their tone even as they urged my friends and I to come
out to the late night rally. I was even more upset whenI
learned about the objectionable process by which the
administration came to its decision. One thing I was glad
of, though, was the rapid mobilization of much of the
student body behind the cut teams. Football players said
please support us now; we would do the same for you.
However, I'm worried that the promise of the football team, that they would do the same for another group,
does not ring true, and that it wouldn't be true coming
from many campus groups or from our population in
general. I remember being surprised as afreshman when

the InterculturalCenter was vandalized, and there were

many studentswho didn't feel affected, or who expressed
resentment toward the IC support groups. I wonder if
the general outcry we are hearing now stems from students' frustration with the administration, rather than
sympathy for a segment ofour community. Football players and the IC support group members are all part of
what makesSwarthmore a diverse studentbody, and yet
they both take flak when their presence is supported by
money and resources. Circumstances have drawnmany
supporters behind football, but this may not be the case
for smaller, less visible groups.
It's time to set up some dialogue between all students
andall the groups that get beat up on or don't get a press
conference when something goes wrong. We can be much

more effective in voicing our needs to our administration if an injury to any of us is considered an injury to
all, but right now the tacit boundaries between many
groups of students are keeping thatfrom happening.

Liberal bias

Bathroom graffiti a window to Swat queer politics
BY TIM STEWART-WINTER
Bathroom graffiti is often inane and crude. What could it
possibly tell us about the state of queer-straight relations at
Swarthmore? A lot, I think.
Four recent letters to the Phoenix have highlighted the complex relationship between the queer community and the Swat
mainstream a relationship often viewed very differently by
queers and straights. In order to promote a more productive
dialogue about how Swatties can live together, I'm going to
present and discuss some bathroom graffiti written on the stalls
of the Cornell Library men's room late last spring.
-

I love rifle sports. While I admit that I initially
joined the Scarsdale High School Rifle Team in order to see the woman whom I want to (and never
will) marry, eventually I developed a love for the
sport equal to my love for the girl.
Rifle sports teach discipline, mental and physical
strength, precision, teamwork, and a host ofother qualities. But they can also teach another lesson. Those interested in rifle sports are often forced to confront illconceived and deceptive resistance. My high school
team, a team which never suffered even a minor injury in its 50-plus years of existence, was cancelled last
year due to such opposition. This injury-free team was
denounced as both morally and physically dangerous
to the school environment. Sounds Stalinist, eh?
The explanation that shooting is historically one of
the safest interscholastic sports was futile, as was the
point that shooting, more than anything else, teaches
gun safety and respect first-hand. Though in theory
Scarsdale's self-proclaimed "liberals" said they acknowledged these athletic and psychological benefits of rifle
sports, in practice this acknowledgement was nothing
more thanpolitically motivated appeasement. So, when
I decided to start a target-shooting club at Swarthmore,
I figuredI would encounter similarresistance from similarly described "liberals." I prepared for the worst.
I can happily say that I was wrong. When planning the group, I received valuable advice and assistance. When looking for members, I encountered many
enthusiastic and interested students who I had just
assumed would hate the idea of shooting. And when
the charter was finally sent, it was approved without
even requiring my presence at a meeting.
Such acceptance represents, for me, the true
meaning of liberalism: an ideological system that
respects and even encourages a multiplicity of views
and interests, as long as those views and interests
are not directly harmful to individuals. It is in accordance with this definition that those involved in
chartering the shooting club acted; it is by this definition that I would even call myself a liberal.
I therefore object to the floodof recent letters to The
Phoenix insulting excessive liberalism on this campus.
Yes, the activism on campus does occasionally lose sight
ofrationality and the actual meaning of tolerance, as I
have discussed before. But my experience forming a
rifle team on this campus has shown me that this is
not always the case; this is not a campus entirely full of
hypocritical, unnecessarily reactionary liberals.
Rather, at least in this case, it has shown itself to be a
campus of truly accepting and tolerant individuals.
I began this semester with a column promising
objectivity. I thought then that objectivity would mean
constantly deconstructing an onerous liberal bias. I
am happy to admit, after the successful chartering of
the Swarthier Target Shooting Club, that I was wrong.

The Cornell bathroom stalls where the staff post sheets
of paper so that graffiti won't damage the walls provide a
fascinating window into the unspoken dynamics and anxieties
behind our thinking about sexuality. Last spring, the stalls of
the Cornell men's room featured a long-running debate about
queerness on campus. The language ranged from crude to
hyper-intellectual, and a wide range of queer, straight, gayfriendly and anti-gay students participated.
A small group of queer-friendly students decided last spring
to photocopy and preserve these seven sheets of anonymous
graffiti and donate themto the college archives. Although some
of the comments are vulgar and deeply offensive, I'm going to
discuss them in detailbecause I think looking at them, rather
than beyond them, reveals a great deal.
The spark for the debate was a claim that the amount of discussion of homosexuality at Swat is excessive. A bathroom user
(probably, like the others, a Swarthmore student) wrote, "Why is
there always so much gay shit on this board? All these fags at
Swat... me, I'll take pussy, thank you." This student voiced the
perspective of some students who feel that politically active gay
students go "too far" in their effort to be visible. Several hostile
incidents at the Sager party and a controversial speaker opposed
to homosexuality and brought to campus by the Swarthmore
Christian Fellowship had heightened this concern.
"Maybe if you fags didn't make such a nuisance out of yourselves, normal people wouldn't get pissed," said one message.
"SQU needs to chill way the fuck out," opined another.
Many comments reflected a tendency to conflate the politically active segment of the queer community with queer students in general. The replies of queer-friendly students showed
that queer students don't share the view that they have a favored position on campus. Instead, many felt that being open
or political about their sexuality, while necessary, makes them
vulnerable. For instance, a student wrote that at the Sager
party, "One person outside threatened to kill me because I was
a 'fag.' That's hate speech." Another suggested that queer students are powerfully affected by "the amount of internalized
homophobia we've absorbed by the time we reach puberty."
For these queer students, their pride in their minority identity is coupled with stress and vulnerability.
Some comments complained about SQU's political activism
on behalfof aggressive sexual visibility. Thus, "this campus gives
the moral high ground not just to homosexuals but specifically
topromiscuous, poUtically-minded homosexuals." And in a similar vein, "SQU is moving away from its role as a support group
and towards an openly political position that may exclude many
gays." (Ironic, since SQU is probably less political today than
were the first openly lesbian and gay student groups at Swat in
the 1970s and 80s.)
Pro-queer students, in response, argued that queers must
take a political approach to identity precisely because of homophobia, "Hate speech" was a focus of disagreement. Queer-

LETTER
The Board of Managers won't reconsider
Dear Editor:
I think that it's time to get a few things straight. I think
that it's time to stop talking. I think that something must be
done. I wouldlike to bring attention to threepoints that have,
for the most part, been overlooked.
I was ashamed Monday night to hear Delonte Gholston and
Jordan Brackett talk about the extent to which the preceding
dialogue soothed their wounded souls. The meeting was entirely unproductive and repetitive. Gholston's argument that
an open dialogue would serve as the most conducive path toward overturning the board's decision is simply preposterous.
I do not claim that either Gholston or, for that matter, any
member of the board is stupid; they're just wrong. Gholston's
entire statement was overshadowedby the preceding comment
Put forth by the chair ofthe board we are not going to reconsider this. Since when has open dialogue been the most per-

-

friendly students, such as the target of the death threat I mentionedalready, usually see anti-gay comments directed at queers
as threats to their comfort and well-being. But other students
believe that hate speech is overblown, fabricated, and less harmful than the reaction against it. '"Hate speech' (which is arbitrarily defined by the self-appointed 'victim') is constitutionally protected," said one message. "It's one thing to defend your
freedom ofexpression and another to squash everyone else's,"

said another.

Perhaps appropriately in the science library, another key
topic was whether queerness is "natural." The antigay position was clear: "IfI see something disgusting, I am repulsed by
it. It's as simple as that... There's no deep meaning here—fags
just are sick freaks, plain and simple." Another student observed that "Humans are designed to pass on their genes," a
task at which queers presumably fail. Contrasting comments
noted that "most male primates and many birds display bisexual
behavior—ain't nothing unnatural about it," and quoted Gore
Vidal to the effect that "The only unnatural sex act is one that
cannot be performed."
Queer-friendly students sought to emphasize that homosexuality is an identityrather than a behavior. Another student wrote,

COMMENTS QUOTED GORE VIDAL TO THE
EFFECT THAT "THE ONLY UNNATURAL
SEX ACT IS ONE THAT CANNOT BE
PERFORMED."
"All that homo- or heterosexuality denotes is which sex gets you
hard. It does not have anything to do with whether you like it in
the ass or not." Someone proposed an elaborate experiment to
prove that straight men, too, would enjoy receiving anal sex if it
were performed by "a woman with a strap-on," and noted that
gays are simply "used to anal [sex], straights are not." Finally, a
queer-positive student pointed out that offensive comments about
same-sex acts reflect anxiety rather than certainty: "As a straight
white male with a happy sex life, I can't imagine how someone
in my position could be sooo afraid of gays."
In the end, one student suggested that "we all stop listening and responding to this one very lonely/scared/angry person (perhaps 2) and move on." While I agree in principle that
queers and their allies are not obligated to answer antigay
rhetoric, I do think that to understand and heal the divisions
in our communities, we need to pay attention to antigay as
well as pro-gay discourse. Sometimes hate speech is so dambut
aging that immediate steps must be taken to stop it
even then it's useful and important to scrutinize and try to
understand it.
To me, the most inspiring comment ofall was written by a
straight guy who admitted that he was uncomfortable when
"gay guys hit on me," but was trying to understand and reevaluate his feelings. "The idea of a guy masturbating to me
is pretty fucking disturbing," he wrote, "but [you should] realize that most women feel this way every day." Yes, queers
have a right and a need to tune out their oppressors much of
the time. But I increasingly think that, when possible, we
should try to think empathetically about other's experiences.
Yes, human difference is real and important, and we need to
notice and understand it, but we also need to try to understand others' experiences, to appreciate the limits of difference, and struggle to transcend it.

we've been inundated with spin

suasive form of mobilization? Swift and consorted action is
clearly more effective in achieving any sort of change. The
longer that this is drawn out, theless likely that anything will
change. Hmmm, and isn't it convenient thatthis decision was
made during the most stressful weeks ofthe semester? Thanks,
Al, this is definitely a choice time to establish clear lines of
communication with your student body.
Each time that a student admissions fellow performs an
interview or a recruiter sends out a letter, that person places
his/her name on the line. The Board of Managers and the administration have made liars out offar too many people. It is
not acceptable for this college to let the little people have their

reputations jeopardized, while the bigwigs casually disasso-

ciate themselves with theselies. It is intolerablefor this insti-

tution to attempt to dignify any sort offalsehood.
Finally, I want to know the truth. What events begged such

a radical change in so short a time? I think that we have heard
the same thing over and over, but I know that there is more. Is
our number two ranking not good enough? Are the football players too big and scary? It is preposterous to contend that the behavioral characteristics of these athletes were not considered in
this decision. The fact that this came into question in the board
and theARC'S conversations (regardless ofwhether they decided
to place the issue to the side) demonstrates that this was an implicit consideration in the decisions of these groups.
So, what is this student body going to do? I will be shocked
if any sort of successful student mobilization is achieved at
this point. We have been fed enough Soma that we are not
much of a threat anymore. Congratulations, Swarthmore. I
can't wait to see the lovely hotel that will (coincidentally, of
course) be built on the football team's former practice field.

Rape humor in poor taste
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to a the controversy surrounding Phoenix columnist Charles Fischette's November 9 column, in which he reminisces
about "things that are good about college." Noting that "we regret only what
is left undone," Fischette then proceeds to list a number of supposedly humorous experiences which he might not had if he had not gone to college.
The last item on Fischette's list reads as follows: "I would never have
heard someone say, upon viewing a somewhat-attractivefemale character
in a 'StreetFighter'-esque video game, and I do indeed quote, "Quick! Somebody press the rape button.'" Personally, I found this last comment far from
funny. There's nothing humorous about rape, fictitious or otherwise.
As if Fischette's column weren't bad enough, last week Benjamin George
and Elliot Reed co-wrote a letter in which they mocked those offended by
Fischette. Granted, we may not live in the pro-rape culture which George
and Reed suggest Fischette's detractors believe we inhabit, but our society
is indeed one which accepts unwanted sexual advances as the status quo.
Any woman who has ever commuted on the NYC subway knows that.
Do George and Elliot know how it feels to have a group of men you pass
on the street shout lewd comments about how they'd like to use your body?
Or to feel the man standing next to you on the train press his groin against
your leg while making slurping noises? Can they imagine what it'slike to
have a slimy-looking man stare at your breasts and whisper, and I do indeed quote, "There must be a lot of milk in those"? Do they know how filthy,
how violated, that kind of abuse makes women feel? And do they realize
that the men who commit these abuses will only in extremely rare instances
face any legal consequences whatsoever? Regardless of the recent media
attention given to sexual harassment, date rape, and similar crimes, our
society by and large remains disturbingly tolerant of sexual assault.
Unwanted sexual advances are no laughing matter. For years men have
used rape and other forms of sexual assault as a means of intimidating and
controlling women. Men continue to victimize women on a daily basis. A
video game which perpetuates this culture of intimidation is no joke.

SCCS to hold new
petition session
Dear Editor:
During the first vote on the Tarble basement referendum, the Swarthmore College Computer Society ran a petition to
encourage student government and the
college administration to attempt to accommodate all three proposals with the
presently available resources on campus.
As before, the SCCS believes that there
is a way to at least partially satisfy theCenter for Activism and Public Service and
SWa-Wa proposals from thelast referendum.
Specifically, these are to turn the Wharton
basement space into a dedicated or 'almost
dedicated" (to the extent that Student Council gets some use of the space as well) space
for student activism, and to extend the hours
and services of Essie Mae's.
We've decided to run a second petition
because the old one was rather unscientific
and because the four hours we spent petitioning didn't give too many people a chance
to sign. The new petition is being conducted
online at all hours of the day at http://

www.sees.

swarthmore.edu/petition/, and
will extend until Dec. 14. Please note that
because this is a new petition, those who
signed the earlier petition and still agree
with us on these issues must sign again.

Science Center plans, construction clarified
Dear Editor:
Thank you for the continuing articles on the new Science
Center. The new facility will make such an important and
dramatic addition to the campus that I appreciate the opportunity for the college community to be kept up to date with
the project. There were a few statements in last week's Phoenix that I found to be a bit confusing, so I am writing to make
sure that the details are clear.
One of the issues that has most concerned me from the
beginning ofthe Science Center project is how to plan responsibly for the future of sciences. On one hand, we certainly
want a science center that is going to serve the college well
for decades. On the other is the recognition that the cost of
constructing and running science buildings is very high and
funds that are invested in the sciences now are not available
to other important needs ofthe college. This dilemma is made
even more complex when you add in the degree to which the
sciences have changed in the past few decades and will change
(in unknown ways) in the future.
Recognizing that this same problem must have faced previous science building planning groups, I looked at thebuildings that currently serve the sciences at Swarthmore ae some
for more than half a century. They have some features in common: when they were opened, they didn't have any empty
unused space within them and their internal and external
design has beenmodified over the years as departments and
programs grew and changed. The take-home message here is
that in a dynamic setting like the college, all space that can be
used is used and no building exists for long in an unmodified
condition.
Planning for the futurerequires both space for expansion
and design flexibility. Growth space is built in to the science
center by having a set of seven offices that are not currently
designated as belonging to any department and by building
more classrooms than the classroom survey of 1999projected
we would need. We made sure that some classrooms are positionedand equipped in order to make conversion to laboratory space relatively easy. We could have chosen to build this
space as "shell space," which would have forced it to remain
empty until formally designated for a department's use, but
it seemed much wiser to use that space in some initial capacity, recognizing that it would be the first to be modified.
In addition to that non-departmental space, each department has recognized ways in which its currently designated
space could be modified to accommodate the addition of a
new faculty member to that department. So, in total, there is
growth room for as many as ten new faculty built into the
Science Center. Flexibility has been incorporated into the

10

OP-ART BY ALLISON GAFFNEY'O2

project by designing laboratories on a modular plan so that
they can be easily modified and updated. The inner walls of
the Science Center are not load-bearing and can therefore be
reconfigured for futureneeds. Utilities (a massively complex
and critical part of the function of a science building) are designed in such a way as to be readily accessible and adaptable ae the plan also features empty conduits that will allow
us to add utilities in the future.
I also appreciate your efforts to let the college community
understand the impact of the building process on the campus. We all wish there were a way to have it instantly appear
without any inconvenience. However, the process is going to
be difficult and we are working hard to figure out ways to
minimize the impact of construction. I do want to point out
that while it is true that the whole project won't be over until
the current first-year students are in their fifth year (as The
Phoenix puts it), it's important to realize that the Science
Commons addition (which will house the Commons, Beverage Lab, some of the new classrooms and some physics laboratories) will be complete for use in Spring 2003, followed
shortly by the new Chemistry wing for use in Fall 2003. So it
is actually only the class of 2002 who will experience the impact of building (in their senior year) without any direct reward from the project.
The process of planning how classes will be taught and
how research will continue during renovation is unbelievably complex. We are trying to minimize the numberof moves
that any individual has to make while maximizing their ability to do their professional activities.
Currently the worst situation is that a person would move

once into temporary space and then a second time into their
new space. Jan Sender and Susan Sayer of Facilities have
been working for months on these plans and things are largely
sorted out through 2003.1 expect that in another month or so,
we will have a finished plan for action. Given the vagaries of
faculty schedules and construction, it is appropriate, however, to realize that these "best-made plans" may need to be
altered as unforeseen circumstances arise.
The Science CenterPlanning Committeeis hosting an open
house Dec. 14 in the Scheuer Room in Kohlberg from 2 p.m. to
5 p.m. We invite members of the college community to stop
by, have some refreshments, take a look at the newest renderings ofthe building and chat with committee members about
the design and features of what I firmly believe is going to be
a wonderful addition to the campus.

Rally shows gender unity
Dear Editor:
The pieces by Donna Jo Napoli, John Dolan and Joanna
Curtis about rape in past weeks reminded me of an event I
attended that changed my views on sexual assault. One Friday night in October, Dean Bob Gross and I attended the
"You're the Man" Rally at Franklin & Marshall University.
The rally was a speak-out against sexualassault, led by males.
The conference addressed six assaults that occurred at F&M
by the middleof this semester. It targeted sexually aggressive
male attitudes on campus; one track runner detailed his anger at his teammates' jokes about forcing women into bed.
The rally also addressed a more poignant issue: how males
can care for and rebuild trust in a sexually assaulted partner.
Men and women spoke openly of experience with rape and
sexualassault, with anonymity preserved where desired. One
female victim spoke from another room via intercom to tell
her story of having been raped. What I never expected were
the powerful stories from men ofthe torture ofknowing they
could never rebuild the trust in their girlfriend after that assault and feeling that they had a role in preventing the atmosphere where it could ever happen to someone else.
The atmosphere is not present at Swarthmore for such
an event to occur. First, according to the statistics mentioned
by Curtis, the level of crime to warrants such a conference
does not exist here. The more unsettling thing missing is
the willingness of Swarthmore heterosexual men and feminist groups to unite on this issue as I witnessed at F&M.
What I feel hurts the prospects for dialogue is the kind of
attitude seen in last year's "Vagina Monologues." Men were
characterized as child abusers, brutal or neglectful spouses,
and outright dolts in regard to women's sexual and emotional
needs, and the audience lovedit. While the performances were
admirable and the stories poignant, I left feeling there had to
be a way to celebrate women's sexual rights without totally
bashing the opposite sex.
According to Curtis' piece "Hiding In the Shadows," the
Sexual MisconductAdvisors and Resource Team, devoted to
counseling and making survivors aware of resources, is allfemale. While of course women want counseling from other
women on this issue, this inhibits the involvement ofmales
whose girlfriends are victimized or who wish to support this
process. It seemed that sexual assault prevention and treatment is a "women's only" issue here.
F&M's rally showed heartfelt men and women who clearly
saw dialogue and cooperation as the best method of combating sexual aggressiveness and fostering healthy relationships.
Sexual assaults should not have to rise to crisis levels on this
campus for gender-exclusive groups that would not normally
cooperate, frats and feminist groups included, to admit a
mutual interest in combating a climate that contributes to
sexual assault. I for one don't want to have to wait for six
more victims for our atmosphere to change.

Women's basketball third in tourney
RYLAND AND EMILY GRAY

The Swarthmore women's basketball team is reeling following its overheated bus trip back from the Mount
Holyoke-hosted Seven Sisters Tournament, and the bomb that was dropped
on them the night before they were to
play their final of three games. Despite
a one-point loss to eventual tournament
champions Vassar College, the team
was more pre-occupied with the news
that the football, badminton, and wrestling teams had been eliminated. They

eventually placed third in the tourna-

ment.

As far as tournament play is concerned, the Garnet came out roaring
against Smith, with intense defense
and offense to match, on their way to a
decisive win. Thirsty for a challenging
match-up, Ali Furman 'O3 came out
with guns blazing to the tune of 21
points, a team high. Katie Robinson 'O4
and Heather Kile 'O2 also scored in
double figures, and Kile registered the
first of her three double-doubles of the
weekend.
The following day, the Tideswomen
were not as fortunate. The basketball
gods had decreed that the women
couldn't buy a basket on Saturday afternoon. Their defense would have
been cause enough to secure the victory, if they had managed more than a
meager 25 percent shooting from the
floor, registering just one player, Kile,
in double figures. The team succumbed
to Vassar by a heart-breaking singlepoint deficit.
That night, head coach Adrienne
Shibles approached the team with tears
in her eyes in an emergency meeting
of players. In a desolate hotel room in
Chicopee, Mass., she informed her
team that the athletic department was
being torn asunder with the elimination of the football, badminton and

wrestling teams. Suddenly, one-point

losses didn't seem so bad. Rallying be-

hind the greater cause of athletics, and
arming themselves with temporary tat-

toos invoking the names of the three
fallen sports, the Swarthmore women's
basketball team proved something on
the court that day at Mount Holyoke.
They defeated Mount Holyoke in a hardearned battle, while the two Heathers
(Kile and Marandola '01) led the team
in scoring. In an impressive effort, Katie
Robinson 'O4 added a new dimension to
her defensive game by tallying 13 steals
for the tournament.
The team ended up capturing a thirdplace trophy at the Seven Sisters Tournament, which it would like to dedicate
to the athletes on the football, badminton and wrestling teams. Many of the
players on the team would not have applied to a Swarthmore that the Board of
Managers envisions. The team wants to
make the "powers that be" aware of the

fact that in a short time, and with limited recruitment, the women's basketball team has accomplished a turnaround, and this while the football team
was still intact. By claiming that the
remaining athletic community will benefit from these cuts, they are really giving all remaining teams a bitter pill to
swallow, because the real improvement
happens through hard work and personal sacrifice, not by axing sports
teams. In silent protest against the
board's decision, the women will be
donning the home jerseys of the football
team instead of their brand-new shooting shirts for the remainder of the season.
The results of the contest versus
Washington College on Wednesday
night were not available at press time.
This is the final game before the December hiatus.

Slots. It's finally out in the open. They even
made The New York Times. They're also the main
issue at hand with the Athletic Review Committee
(ARC), the Board of Managers and the outraged
students. If you think this is just about football, you
are missing the point. This is not just about
football; it's about attitudes towards athletics. This
is not just about athletics; it's about respect for
students. This is about process and community,
about the real mission of the college. Are we just
here to perpetuate the high ranking of the
institution in a random newsmagazine?
Though neither my coach nor the Admissions
Office has directly stated it to me, I firmly believe
that I received an acceptance letter two years ago
because I was "slotted." I'm a recruited athlete. It
has been very difficult for me to sit by over the last
year and a half and listen to the idea that slotted
athletes (specifically football players) are a
degradation to the Swarthmore community. Within
this dialogue, I have, on many occasions, tried to
express what I feel is the Swarthmore studentathlete's perspective on Swarthmore and athletics.
I have also tried to explain that not all slots are
filled by football players. I have recently tried to
help break down the football-DU-dumb jock
stereotype. I felt that I was making progress.
Apparently, I was deceiving myself that I could
change these things. That I mattered. On Saturday,
my ideal of Swarthmore was shattered.
The ARC and the board may not like it, but they
are sending a message to the student-athletes
here that they are second-class citizens, that being
an athlete makes you different in a negative way.
That we slotted athletes are not smart enough to
be here on our own. They had to make an
exception for us. And by reducing the percentage
of recruited athletes, the ARC and the board are
saying that they don't want to make such
exceptions. That we are not worth it.
I can't reconcile this attitude with the main
purpose of the ARC. They were formed to
investigate the experience of the student-athlete,
with the intention of improving this experience.
Whatever good intentions they might have had and
however they choose to spin it, they are telling me
that if I want a better experience as a studentathlete, I should go somewhere else.
If you talk with Swatties about their hopes and
dreams, you will come across many commonlyshared goals. How many of you have wanted to be
a doctor since you were 10? How many of you
have had a lifelong fascination with fantasy and
science fiction? How many of you have this odd
affinity for insanely studying your brains out to
pursue an extremely difficult and stressful
education? How many of you stepped onto
campus and immediately fell in love with
Swarthmore? How many of you have had the
chance to participate in sports, whether
intercollegiate, club, intramural or those insane
pick-up tackle football games held on Saturdays?
Personally, I have had one goal that I have
continuously pursued since I was 111 have always
wanted to play lacrosse in college. It used to be
that I wanted to play Division I ball at Princeton
and be a four-year Ail-American just like Amory
Rowe (the first woman to score a behind-the-back
goal in NCAA play, and the woman who scored the
winning goal in the championship game of the last
World Cup, but that's another story). But as I

From NELSON-LEE, pg. 11
came to realize that though I loved lacrosse, I didn't
want it to be my life. I just wanted to play.
Swarthmore provided that opportunity. It also
provided me the opportunity to explore my writing
and opinions through the avenue ofThe Phoenix. It
provided me the opportunity to take the most bizarre
selection of courses with professors that knew my
name. It provided me the opportunity to immerse
myself in the theatre through my on-campus job. I
can run from class to practice to a lecture to dinner
to a free movie to a study break to McCabe (blech) to
a club meeting to Paces, all the while meeting the
most intelligent, experienced, wonderful people.
Swarthmore is not about U.S. News & World
Report's ranking. Swarthmore is not about turning
itself into a Willams or an Amherst, but it is not also
about turning itself into a Vassar or a RISD or a
Widener, or a Bob Jones University, or any other school.
Swarthmore is not perfect, but it is not broken. The
athletic program was not perfect, but neither was it
"tattered," as The New York Times claimed on Tuesday.
Swarthmore is not just about academics or athletics.
Swarthmore is about people. It is about diversity
of people. If you read the letters from alumni that
have been pouring in since The Phoenix first started
talking about the ARC this fall, and especially if you
talk with them personally, you hear a common
theme. What they remember the most about their
experience here is not the spectacular class they
took, nor the unbelievable performance they went to,
not even the moving athletic triumph. Though these
are valuable memories, what alumni rave about the
most are the amazing people.
The ARC and the board did not talk to the people,
and they did not think about the opinions, feelings, or
reactions of the people. They did not make their
recommendation and decision for the people. It
seems to me that the Board of Managers does not
make its decisions in good faith or for the community
or the students.
What is Swarthmore all about? Whatever longterm goals are made for the college, I want and
expect them to be for the present and future
students, not because we have a huge endowment
that we want to keep increasing and not spending on
the students, not because we have a personal
vendetta against athletes, conservatives, activists,
oboe players or what have you, not because we want
to be No. 1 at all costs. The Board of Managers
should be here for the students because without us
there would be no Swarthmore. Without our passion,
our pursuits, our intelligence, our hopes and dreams,
Swarthmore cannot exist.
For me, Kate Nelson-Lee, whatever label you
choose to represent my so-called specialty, whether it
be athlete, woman, journalist, stage technician,
designer, friend, enemy, does not matter. First and
foremost, I am a Swarthmore student. The
Swarthmore that I came here for, the Swarthmore that
I have grown to love and that is my life, is not the
Swarthmore that the Board of Managers sees for the
future. The Board of Managers has sent a message.
Their Swarthmore is not for the students. Their
Swarthmore is about numbers, about rankings, about
endowments, about being the best with complete
disregard for our Swarthmore. The board is telling us
that we are not important. That Swarthmore is not for
the students. That we don't matter.
I leave you all with a parting message from Bob
Gross: "No matter what you say or do to me, I am still
a worthwhile person." Believe that. But try to
understand that the Board of Managers did not just
cut football, badminton and wrestling on Saturday.
They told all of us students that we are not
worthwhile people. We are just a passing statistic of
an admitted class. Before Saturday, we were people,
but now we are nothing more than a number.

THE SWEET
SPOT

BOM decision turned
students into statistics

acting divisively

After the Board of Managers made the controversial decision to streamline the athletic program, many students
and parents decried the board's action, calling it un-Quakerly, un-Swarthmorean and unacceptable. I see no reason
why students should not sympathize with the members of

cut teams, regardless of how students feel about the board's
decision. After all, these team members can no longer participate in an activity that they love. Their protests of the
board's decision, however, must conform to the very
Swarthmorean values that they champion. In many cases,
the cut team members and the campus community have
protested the decision maturely, calmly and rationally. For
example, they organized a rally, planned a sit-in and solicited student backing in front of Sharpies. Unfortunately,
these admirableprotests havebeen overshadowed by other,

un-Swarthmorean protests.
At the Sunday afternoon meeting, students and parents
harassed, berated and verbally assaulted President Bloom
while he tried to proceed with an open dialogue. Regardless ofBloom or the board's previous disregard for athletes'
feelings, the antagonistic hostility of the meeting clearly
violated the Quaker ideals that the audience demanded
Bloom uphold. In an equally divisive fashion, many students
criticized the board for betraying the "athletic community."
While I can hardly expect all Swarthmore students to
join hands and sing "Kumbaya," I bid you all to resist cataloging yourselves. There should be no "athletic community"
at Swarthmore. Nor should there be a "drama community"
or a "music community" or an "academic community."
Leave the cliques to middle schoolers. This issue concerns
the effects of athletic cuts on the entire Swarthmore community. A decision to keep or eliminate sports should be a
decision that benefits the student body at large, not just

the "athletic community."
This self-described"athletic community" must therefore
affirm its value to the Swarthmore community as a whole.
To prove your worth, members of the "athletic community,"
cease acting in an un-Quakerly, divisive manner. By the
same token, continue to peacefully protest the board's decision, as you have done by organizing the rally and sit-in.

THERE SHOULD BE NO "ATHLETIC
COMMUNITY" AT SWARTHMORE. NOR
SHOULD THERE BE A "DRAMA COMMUNITY" OR A "MUSIC COMMUNITY"
OR AN "ACADEMIC COMMUNITY." LEAVE
THE CLIQUES TO MIDDLE SCHOOLERS.
Furthermore, engage President Bloom in a thoughtful, respectful and mature dialogue, thereby affirming the traditional values of the college. I also implore members of cut
teams not to transfer. If athletes stay at Swarthmore and
become or remain vibrant members of the community who
embrace the college's ideals (which, of course, include contributing to college life in more ways than one), then they
will show that the board's decision was misguided. If, instead, these athletes transfer, they will establish that they
do not wish to fully contribute to the social and academic
life of the college. Once these athletes desist from impulsive
and divisive action and, conversely, continue peaceful and
mature protests, they will affirm their value to the community and prove their doubters wrong.

Teams, administration need
dialogue with non-athletes
BY ANNA MASILELA

There is no question that the Board of Managers has
opened floodgates of discussion among students on this
campus about its decision to cut three teams. When asked
in informal conversation, almost every student seems
to have an opinion on the issue. That is not the case,
however, in the more formally structured discussions between the board and students that have been occurring
since Saturday. I feel that in the midst of all the rallies

THIS WAS A FORUM FOR EXPRESSING
THESE FEELINGS, BUT DEFINITELY NOT
ONE WHERE STUDENTS WHO WERE
NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED COULD CONTRIBUTE OR GAIN MUCH. MANY OF
THEM CAME AWAY WITH LITTLE INFORMATION, WHICH IS WHAT THEY HAD
COME SEEKING.
and fireside chats and sit-ins and talk shows, what has
been missing is a place and time for an honest discussion among students about the issue, where dissenting
opinions could be part of the conversation.
This should not be misconstrued as an attack on the
formal discussions that have already taken place. The
cut teams need to be given great credit for immediately
creating a forum for airing their views via the rally on
Saturday night, an impressive show of grassroots activism in its own right. The honest admission to having

information that was leaked was the best

FOR ONGOING

option

in such

a potentially compromising situation. It immediately
gave the teams the advantage of gaining the higher moral
ground and a sense of solidarity with students who were
not directly affected.
The meeting at the fieldhouse on Sunday morning,
however, did not turn out to be a continuation of an open
discussion. I truly believe that the cut teams chose to
open the meeting to all of the Swat population in order
to reinforce the feeling of solidarity. That did not turn
out to be the case, as there was a generally shared feeling of discomfort among the students who attended at
the disrespectful manner in which the board was treated.
True, emotions among cut athletes and their parents
were high and understandably so, given that many felt
very betrayed. This was a forum for expressing these
feelings, but definitely not one where students who were
not directly affected could contribute or gain much.
Many of them came away with little information, which
is what they had come seeking.
The situation was remedied at the impressive Student
Council-sponsored discussion at the Friends Meetinghouse. Both the board and the cut teams had a chance to
present their views and air concerns in a well-organized
forum. Obviously, the room for discussion is broadening but, once again, students who supported the cuts did
not express their opinions. Silence is definitely not consensus, and I think the next step that the community of
students needs to take is to move beyond the studentsversus-board viewpoint to one respecting the variety of
opinions among students. As far as I can see, more than
1,000 Swat students have not participated in this debate,
and if the cut teams are serious in their claim that this
decision affects all students, they need to be sure that
non-participating students agree or find out why they
do not.

Board votes 21-8 to cut sports
ARC felt pressure to
recommend a course
of action by December
BY BRENDAN KARCH
Despite several months of wrenching decision-making
that included discussion of at least a dozen different proposals, the Athletic Review Committee's final recommendation to the Board of Managers resulted in one of the most
divisive decisions in the board's history, a 21-8 vote to eliminate the varsity football, wrestling and badminton teams.
One member of the board abstained.
According to President Al Bloom, the board's vote tally
became official Saturday only after dissenting members
pushed for the vote to stand. Board members who voted
for the minority decision argued for the straw vote to become the official record of decision rather than stepping
down and letting the decision be portrayed as unanimous,
said Bloom.
The committee's recommendation to cut football, badminton and wrestling was not finalized until the Tuesday
before last weekend's board meeting. Board member Neil
Austrian '6l, who dissented from the ARC decision, spent
the final days before the meeting crafting an alternate proposal that avoided eliminating football. Austrian presented
the plan to the board on Saturday with the full support of
head football coach Pete Alvanos but felt it was inadequately considered at the meeting.
The ARC'S final recommendation came after four fall
Semester meetings in which the committee's view progressed from a consensus on making changes to a nearconsensus on recommending three teams be cut. In the
process, the committee looked at nine different proposals
for cutting teams, according to ARC Chair Jennie Keith,
and kept three options open until the final decision was
made at the emergency meeting held last Tuesday. Keith
|aid two of those options included keeping the football program, and the third, which was passed, did not.
The committee has justified its recommendation based
on what it saw as irreconcilable demands from athletics
and admissions about the number of students in each incoming class. According to committee members, athletics
requested 32 percent of each incoming class be devoted to
slots, a number that wildly overran the 10 percent figure
provided by the Faculty Advisory Committee to admissions. According to Keith, the committee used its October
meeting to try an reconcile these numbers, but found it

I

impossible.

"Ten percent did not adequately support intercollegiate
athletics and the full number of slots was just too big for
the college," Keith said. "From that point on, we started
looking at the trade-offs." In trying to gauge a proper percentage of slots, Keith said the committee "started with 10
Percent and began working up." After deliberation, "15
percent looked to us to be realistic to meet the goals that
we had set for the athletic program."
The committee, which was formed after Bloom addressed athletic concerns at a board meeting last year, was
Pressured into crafting their recommendation during the
span of only a few meetings because the spring semester
was devoted to information gathering and philosophical
issues. According to Keith, it was in April 2000 that the
ARC first heard extensively from coaches, who expressed
fte need for 32 percent of the incoming class to go toward
slots. "We heard from the coaches that every sport needed
(Slots," Keith said.
Two months later, at the ARC's June meeting, the Facility Advisory Committeeto admissions suggesteda 10 percent cap on slots. Because of summer break, the ARC's next
meeting was delayed until September, when the committee reached consensus on three things, according to Keith:
one, that changes needed to be made; two, that Swarthmore
would stay in the Centennial Conference; and three, that
[cutting teams was a possibility.
[ At the October meeting, the ARC scrutinized the paramfor eliminating teams by looking at nine different potential configurations. According to Keith, these proposdiffered in number of slots, ratio of team to individual

sports and ratio of contact to non-contact sports. Keith said
slot percentages encompassing up to 32 percent of each class

were considered at the meeting.
"We talked a lot about keeping what we have currently
and adding resources," Keith added, "but we decided there
was too much inequity between the sports."
According to ARC faculty member Mark Jacobs, "The October meeting was the first meeting where we realized we had
to do this very fast." The committee was concerned about recruiting and admissions timetables, according to ARC members, and they felt that postponing a recommendation until
the spring could hurt athletic programs. Dean of the College
and ARC member Bob Gross said the committee recognized
that "continued ambiguity after December would be detrimental to all teams."
"I wanted to do whatever we could not to make a decision,"
said Jacobs. "The answer the committee gave to me was, 'We
can't wait.'"
After the October meeting, the committee had only one
meeting left in which it could make craft a proposal. With the
possibility of cutting teams imminent, Keith and Board of
Managers President J. Lawrence Shane '56 met with coaches
again. According to Keith, "We made it very clear that we
were looking for the minimum but realistic number of slots"

The committee met all day Nov. 14 to finalize a proposal
but emerged from the meeting without consensus. According to Keith and Austrian, the committee decided 8-6 in
favor of a proposal cutting football. Keith added that three
members of the committee were absent at the vote.
It was toward the end of that meeting that Keith said
Neil Austrian's alternate proposal first surfaced, though
she remembered it as being "kind of hazy at that point."
Austrian, who opposed the proposals to cut sports from
the start, felt that the 8-6 vote was not decisive enough to
approve a proposal to the board.
However, by the end of the emergency meeting called
Tuesday, Nov. 28, Austrian was the only dissenting committee member. Austrian said he was notified of the Tuesday
meeting the previous day and had to participate by phone.
In describing the progress of the meeting, Keith said
the committee first tried to come to consensus on a proper
number of slots as a percentage ofthe class. The ARC could
not come to consensus, but still pressed on with a 14.4 percent number for slots after approving the issue by a majority vote. According to Keith, "Of those participating, all
but one supported the range."
After the decision to hold slots at around 15 percent,

Football commitment perceived as incomplete
Cut to program comes despite "resurrection" of the last three seasons and promises made to students
BY BRENDAN KARCH

This year's football recruiting
brochure says it all.
"One heartbeat," it announces in bold, garnet letters.
"The rebuilding is over be a
part of the Heartbeat!" Nineteen
of 22 starters were returning, it
goes on, making the resurrection
of football at Swarthmore self...

evident.
The board's decision to eliminate the football program
abruptly terminates what was
being hailed as a remarkable revitalization of a once moribund
team. Since the arrival of head
coach Pete Alvanos and his staff
in April 1998, the team has en-

joyed more players, more wins

and more honors than any time
in recent history.
What had started as a strong
commitment from the administration was now being realized in
a successful football team. But

even before the board's decision

last Saturday, the college had
given mixed clues about

football's future. Media clippings
and faculty concern, combined
with the board's decision, leave
a trail of evidence that make the
administration's initial commitment to football three years ago
unclear.
The

recent history of
Swarthmore football begins and
ends with one fact: after the 1997
season, Swarthmore had not won
a football game in two years, and
something had to give. The college fired head coach Karl Miran,
who came on eight years ago and
enjoyed initial success before the
team's decline in the mid-19905.
The previous year, the football
team had had only 28 players in
uniform at one point. Dean Bob
Gross remembers worrying for
the physical well-being of the
players that season. "[Athletic
director] Bob Williams and I
were walking the sideline one
week," said Gross, "wondering if
we should forfeit for safety reasons."
The 1997-1998 off-season provided time to rebuild. Alvanos,
formerly the offensive coordinator at the University of Chicago,
was hired in April, after an intense spring of recruiting by admissions and administration. In
Alvanos's first season, the class
of 2002, then freshmen, made up
just short of half the football roster.
Prospective athletes knew
they were coming to a team that
had not won in two years, but
many were lured by the promise

of an administrative commit-

ment to improving football. Part
of that commitment, according to
players, was a promise that

Swarthmore would have football

for the entire career of the class
of 2002. Doug Kneeland 'O2 said

that former Dean ofAdmissions
Robin Mamlet promised
football's continued presence,
and he was offered a callfrom the

backup assurance.
The team's first season under
Alvanos saw little improvement in
record 0-8 after an 0-10 season the
previous year
but most team statistics improved, including total
yardage gained on offense and allowed on defense, indicating an improvement in the caliber of play. The
next year, Swarthmore won their
first game in four seasons, crushing
a meager Oberlin squad 42-6. The
stigma of a winless team had dissipated, despite the team's 0-8 record
the rest of the season.
It was this year that Swarthmore
football's "resurrection" reached
full steam. The team nearly pulled

off a winning season, going 4-5 and
finishing first in the conference in
passing yards allowed per game and
third in all-conference honors. Players attested to boosted morale. "This
season was phenomenal in terms of
the three-year turnaround," said

Alvanos.

Although the revitalization can
be termed a success, doubts over the
decision to improve football and the

commitment to it over the last few
years have been abundant. Many
faculty members felt left out of the
original decision three years ago,
questioning the secrecy and topdown nature of the decision. "The
faculty was very miffed at the time,"
said physics professor Frank

Moscatelli.
An article in the College Bulletin after Alvanos's first season

avoided a one-sided portrayal of
football as rebuilding, instead focus-

ing on football as a "complex issue"
that raises questions about values
at a liberal arts college. Nearly a

year later, an article in The New
York Times on Swarthmore football
quoted Al Bloom as saying, "This is
an experiment." Bloom threw a positive spin on the issue yesterday, saying "the experiment was success-

ful." But in the wake ofthe cut, players have questioned the value of
Bloom's commitment if it was indeed an experiment.
If it was, then the expansion of
resources needed for a successful
sports program began to be undermined soon after the commitment to
football was made. At the same time
that DuPont renovations were first
being discussed two years ago, a
long-range planning subgroup on
athletics met. One of their conclusions, according to Dean of the College Bob Gross, is that Swarthmore
had too many varsity sports. The

combination of Swarthmore's small
size (about 1450 enrolled) and high
number of sports (24 before the cut)
gives the school the third lowest student-to-sport ratio in the Centennial

Conference.

players and faculty feel that these
issues contradict the college's
commitment to football. Players
have expressed betrayal, particularly over the promise made that
the class of 2002 would play football for four years. The positive
attitude that had permeated the
team since Alvanos's arrival

makes the entire situationall the
harder to stomach, players said.
Alvanos insisted his best moment in his briefSwarthmore career came when the community
showed the most support. "The
happiest moment was when
Swarthmore students ran out on
that field and tore down those
goal posts after that Oberlin
game," Alvanos said. "That just
sent chills up and down my
body."
With the board's decision to
tear down the goalposts, the reaction on campus has deeply
questioned that community
spirit, not only in the decision to
cut football, but in the decision
to revitalize it three years ago.

Admission slots to be redistributed

All varsity teams may get slots, which could be divided into degrees
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
The Athletic Review Committee rec-

ommendations adopted by the Board of
Managers included far-reaching changes

to the slotting system, allowing coaches a
say in the admissions process. Now, all
varsity teams will likely be given slots and
slots will be divided into three degrees.
Under the old slotting system, only 12

sports received slots and the number of
slots each team received varied widely,
with football taking a good proportion of
them. The slots were only of one type:
coaches were allowed to recommend players for admission at the beginning of the
admissions process and then check on the
status of applicants later in the process.
A slot recommendation was not a guarantee that a player would be admitted.
According to Director of Athletics Bob
Williams, the system was meant to give
relatively equal access to all teams. "It
was intended that the system would rotate, but the 12 sports didn't get in that
good of a condition," he said.
Provost Jennie Keith said that under
the new system proposed by the ARC, slots
would be reserved each year for all varsity sports. "We heard that every sport
needed slots," she said. She added that the
ARC proposal included increased coaching resources and more recruiting assis-

tance for the sports.
Acting Dean of Admissions Jim Bock
'9O said he expected that 20 or 21 of the 21
remaining sports would get slots.
"We're going to be able to be more competitive across the board," Williams said.

But the total number of slots will be
reduced to 14.4 percent of applicants from
past levels of up to 18 percent, Keith said.

This figure, which will mean about 33 slots
for athletes, was a compromise between the
10 percent or less desired by the Faculty Advisory Committee, led by ARC member Professor Hans Oberdiek, and the 32 percent requested by athletic coaches.
"10 percent wouldn't adequately support
a successful intercollegiate athletic program," Keith said, adding that the figure requested by the coaches was too large. "15 [percent] looked to us to be realistic to meet the
goals that we had set," she said.
Of the 33 slots in each incoming class,
some will carry more weight than others.
Keith said the ARC proposal will allow for
"tip" and "impact" recommendations in addition to regular slots. "We imagined a model
that might include 10 tips and 10 impacts,"
she said.
Tips, she said, will be "less than a slot"
and would give recommended players a
slight edge over other applicants when all
other factors are equal.
Impacts will be of more importance than
regular slots and will be taken very seriously
in the admissions process. With impacts,
Keith said, "we're acknowledging that there
are a few cases where a player may make a
great impact on a team."
The process for determining which teams
get slots will be developed by the ARC at its
next meeting. Keith is unsure when that will
be.
When it does occur, Williams' role in the
process may be re-evaluated, Bock said.
Williams said that he felt "awkward"
about his former role as the person who had
decided which sports got the original slots.
"The coaches tell the director of athletics
and the director of athletics tell us what the
need is that may or may not change under
the new system," Bock said.

BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
The college has considered
cutting varsity sports in order to
strengthen the rest of the overall
athletic program for at least three
years. A report made in spring of
1997 by the Athletics Planning

Subgroup made the same conclusions as the Board of Managers
and the Athletic Review Committee drew when considering eliminating some of the varsity sports.
The report concerned itself
with improving the athletic program at the college and favored
propping some of the varsity
teams to strengthen others. The
members of the subgroup, however, did not want to commit to
this course of action and recommended that a larger-base group
explore the issue. The report was
finally presented to ARC in the
beginning of its review process
that started in January2000.
"That one was weakly recommended," said John Caskey, who
chaired this committee. According to Caskey, the report was
composed in collaboration between students, faculty and members of the athletic department.

This committee did not have enough
authority to make strong recommendations or any changes. Other
options considered were making the
college larger and admitting a
greater percentage of athletes in
each class. These alternatives were
also the same as those discussed by
ARC.
Despite these long-lived concerns
regarding the viability of the athletic
program as is at the college, the athletic department claims that it was
fully committed to football.
"As far as I'm concerned the commitment was to make football work
over the long haul," said Williams.
This report preceded the decision
to hire Coach Alvanos to improve the
Swarthmore College football program.

Over the last few days, however,
the college's officials have been reported to have a different perspective. In the interview with the
Chronicle ofHigher Education, Tom
Krattenmaker of the Office of the
News and Information was quoted
as saying "Mr. Alvanos's tenure
with the football team has been
something of an experiment for
Swarthmore."
When contacted regarding this

comment, Krattenmaker said this
version of the reasons behind the
cuts was his interpretation of the
events. "I am not saying that three
years ago the official policy was that
this would be an experiment," he

said.
Other members ofthe administration seemed to recollect similar

things.

"Al Bloom said...it was an experiment for three years, [that] is what I
heard," said Dean Bob Gross '62.
So, was the ARC meant to decide
the fate of football from the start?
Mark Dingfield 'Ol said the misconception that the ARC was stacked
against football or any other team
troubled him. "ARC was out to improve the intercollegiate athletics
and that's what we understood the
charge to be," he said
"Every team was considered in
one form or another," affirmed
Gross.
All of the other members of the
committee contacted in relation to
this article also denied any bias towards any of the teams. They said
their understanding of the ARC's
mission was to improve the quality
ofthe athletics in general, not decide
on the fate of any one sport.

Members of the Board of Managers who were against the decision to cut football, wrestling and badminton were asked to step aside
and allow the consensus to be reached by another member last Saturday during the discussion of the Athletic Review Committee's proposal.
"Somebody suggested, now that we made this decision, [that]
those on the other side be willing to stand aside and allow us to
have a consensus," said Dean Bob Gross '62.
"There was no pressure" to stand aside, said board memberLillian
Kraemer '6l, adding that one of the opposing members made an eloquent speech on why no one should abstain.
Commenting on the infrequency of requests for the dissenting
members to stand aside, six-year board member and vice president
of the college Maurice Eldridge '6l said, "I've rarely in my time of
attending the board meetings seen it happen [but] the concept is

there."
The final vote for the board's decision was 21 for, eight against,
with one choosing to abstain.
Technically, there is no requirement that dissenting members
must stand aside and allow the board to go ahead with the decision.
And while the board aims to reach consensus, its bylaws do not require it for passing a resolution. In fact, neither the charter nor the
bylaws specifies how a vote is to be conducted.
"Bylaws don't spell out anything one way or the other," said

Eldridge.
"I thoroughly regret we were not able to reach a consensus," said
Gross. The board did, however, reach a consensus regarding the necessity of making a quick decision due to the possible adverse effects of indecision on recruiting and the class of 2005.
The ARC'S vote on the recommendations to the board was less
divided. According to faculty member of the committee Janet
Talvacchia, all voted for the proposition with the exception of one

member.

Swat culture affected by football
Team's influence on
social interactions and
diversity becomes focus

of student debates
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
Five days have passed since

the Board of Managers' decision
to cut football, wrestling and badminton leaked to the campus
community, and so far a meeting
with the teams has disintegrated
into pandemonium; a late-night
protest and a mid-day sit-in have
been held; angry e-mails have
been circulating; Web pages are
springing out of nowhere and the
college administration has faced
a public relations nightmare.
The decision is not just a matter
of athletic offerings; it also cuts
deeply into questions of culture.

And Swarthmore does not have a
history of taking cultural matters
lightly.
Following a season during
which seven players quit, the college began fueling resources and
effort into revamping the football
team in 1998. The difference was
noticeable with the class of 2002,
in which the number of football
players jumped from 13 to 18, topping 10 percent of male students.
The class of 2003 included 20 football players, and the class of 2004
enrolled 19.
No matter whom you talk to,
you will hear that a revamped
football program has brought
something fundamentally different to Swarthmore.
Many football players have
been outspoken proponents of the
ways in which the football program has contributed to the
college's diversity.
"They have a vision of the way
they want the school to be," Mike
Hopper 'Ol said of the majority of
the student body. "You take philosophy classes, you become
more enlightened, you take almost nothing practical," he said,
adding that a strong football
team, like a prestigious engineering program, has helped make
Swarthmore unique from other
liberal arts colleges.
Administrators, indeed, seem
to agree with football players on

Some athletes
prepare to transfer

As the news of the Board of Managers' sports cuts slowly sinks in,
many of the student-athletesaffected are beginning what they describe
as the painful process of looking to play football at another college.
As of Monday night, 16 of the 49 freshmen, sophomores and juniors
who would make up next year's returning footballroster told The Phoenix they will consider transferring if football is not reinstated.
Many have already contacted other schools for applications and

About 100 students gathered in
p.m. on Tuesday. Many came because they felt student voice had been ignored in the Board of Manager's
decision to cut three sports and wanted to visibly demonstrate their disaproval.

Students gather for sit-in
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL AND ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Members of the teams affected by last weekend's
athletic cuts along withother students opposed to the
cuts occupied Parrish Parlours and inhibited access
to the Admissions Office during the busy lunch hours
Tuesday, but the event brought little reaction from
the administration.
"We just wanted to get in the way so people would
notice us," said Axel Neff 'O2.
The demonstrators numbered about 100 students
by noon. Some held signs that read "They hear but
do not listen," "Protect our community," and "Save
our voices."

SOME DEMONSTRATORS HELD
SIGNS THAT READ "THEY HEAR
BUT DO NOT LISTEN,"
"PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY,"
AND "SAVE OUR VOICES."

They were indeed noticed by several members
ofthe outside press, students passing through Parrish
and a few bewildered prospective students trying to
make their way to the admissions office.
But aside from brief expressions of understanding from Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd
Goundie and Dean of the College Bob Gross, no administrators stopped by the demonstration, according to Robert Melick 'O3. Members of the senior staff
spent most of the day at the home of President Al
Bloom strategizing about the situation.
Not easily deterred, however, the sit-in's most active participants capitalized on it as an opportunity
to spread information about the decision.
Many were passing around the latest newspaper
articles about it, and some also had articles written
about the football team back when it was a target for
revitalization rather thanretirement.
Melick walked around holding a sign showing a
pro-football quote from an article published in De-

cember 1998, which he attributed to Provost Jennie
Keith.
The sit-in also allowed for reflection on the events
of the past few days. While Monday's fireside chat
was widely seen as an improvement over the raucous
environment of the meeting held Sunday in the
fieldhouse, feelings of anger lingered among many of
the students present at today's sit-in.
"I feel utterly disillusioned I don't play sports
here, but when I walked out of the Friends Meetinghouse last night, I really questioned whether I wanted
a degree with Swarthmore's name on it," Abigail
Friedman 'O2 said.
"I'm completely disgusted with the schooland how
the situation was handled. As seniorclass president,
I'm supposed to keep my class connected with the
school in future years. Right now, the administration
has given me nothing to think they care about what
we say," said Joko Agunloye 'OL
For other students, the extreme emotions ofearlier
in the week were replaced by quiet dejection. "I'm glad
to be getting out of here, but I look back at [the underclassmen] and I'm so sorry," Mike Hopper 'Ol said.
Overall, determinationand solidarity reigned. One
student delivered a bag of sandwiches to the demonstrators, who passed them around hungrily.
Several students expressed a willingness to stay
past the 2 p.m. ending time originally set by the organizers of the sit-in, who publicized it in an anonymous e-mail sent to the student body Tuesday morn...

ing.
"We have nothing to lose at this point by staying
here, by fighting our cause," Melick said.
Though the students dispersed as planned, several
made it clear that this would not be the last the community would hear from them.
The women's basketball team played its game
against Washington College Wednesday wearing football jerseys instead of their regular uniforms to show
support for the football players, according to Caitlin
Ryland 'O2.
And the community will likely hear more from the
players themselves.
"I'm willing to fight this fight as long as necessary," Jon Bartner 'O2 said.

interviews with athletic staff.
Dick Nesbitt, acting director of admissions for Williams College,
said he first found out about Swarthmore's cuts in athletics when a
high school senior interested in playing football and who had applied
early to Swarthmore called his office, explaining his interest to attend Williams over Swarthmore.
Many football players expressed shared feelings of betrayal and
alienation with the administrationand the leadership of the college.
Linebacker Jeff Gouline 'O4, who has already contacted athletic
officials at Washington and Lee, Trinity College and Johns Hopkins,
said, "This school had no intention of keeping us around, as we have
done everything they asked and more. I love this school and have
been extremely happy in my short time here; however, I cannot be at
a school which places so little value on its students and integrity."
Robert Melick 'O3, a tight end on the football team who has already contacted Carleton College about the possibility ofplaying there
next season, was especially hurt by the implications that slotted athletes are not valuable academic and social components of the college.
"I've considered transferring to Carleton College in response not
only to the elimination of the football program but mainly in response
to Mr. Bloom's implication that because I may have been admitted to
the college as a 'slotted athlete,' that I specialize in just football and
add no other elements of diversity to the campus," Melick said. "Such
a notion coming from the president of the college goes against everything Swarthmore College is about in my mind."
Melick said the decision to cut the football program sullied the
college's reputation for him. "I feel that by staying at Swarthmore, I
am condoning the deceit and inequity that came as a result of this
decision and presumably would continue for my two remaining years
and into the future," he said.
"This decision will be more difficult that my original college
search," said Lane Oatey 'O3, a fullback. "It will not be easy to leave
emotionally, my ties to this school are strong. I fear either choice,
and both are undesirable at this point."
Brian Byrnes 'O2, a defensive tackle, expressed sadness at the possibility of spending his senior year somewhere else.
"I want to be here at Swat," Byrnes said. "I love this school, and
up until Saturday afternoon, I was absolutely certain I had made the
right college choice. I want to stay here; that's my number one option, but if there's no football team, I don't know if I can."
Most players felt that the response of the college community to
the removal of the teams was at the same time wonderful and horrible because it makes their decisions so much harder.
"I do take solace and comfort in the student support that came as
a result of this situation," Melick said. "Had it not been for this support, I think I would not even consider staying here."
Director of News and Information Tom Krattenmaker said the college will fully support the decisions of students who want to transfer.
"The administration will do everything it can to make sure players'
needs are met." He could not, however, specify actions the college
would take to this end.
Krattenmaker said he hoped athletes from the cut teams would
decide to remain at Swarthmore, however. "I hope they stay. The administration hopes they stay. They have brought a lot to this community besides football; however, we understand if they need to play
football," Krattenmaker said. "The college is going to do everything
it can even, in some cases, if they really want to play football, to
help them find another college."
In the Sunday afternoon meeting at the fieldhouse, President Al
Bloom expressed similar sentiments.
Krattenmaker also expressed the possibility of the college extending the football program for one final year. "As of two days ago, the
belief was that there was the possibility of extending the football program for one more season."
Many team members found this idea neither acceptable nor a valid
reason to stay at Swarthmore. "Theextension of the football program
for one more year is not a viable solution and is only an attempt to
pacify us," offensive lineman Alan May 'O3 said. "Though I treasure
the moments I spend with the team, I could not stay."
Gouline added, "If the program was extended for one more year it
would be an embarrassment. Furthermore, I think that those who
that is, the coaches and players who will find
need to move on
other teams need to do so as quickly as possible. Staying in a lameduck program doesn't do anyone any good."

Alternate
proposal
was rejected
From ARC, pg. 13
"Everybody said that within that range they didn't see
a way to keep football." Despite two proposals for keeping football and one eliminating it, the ARC recommended cutting football, with Austrian as the lone dissenter.
Austrian questioned the final ARC meeting, suggesting that the student members of the committee were
"brow-beaten" into accepting the proposal to cut foot-

ball.

In the next few days, Austrian hurried to draft an
alternate proposal that avoided eliminating football.
The proposal called for 17.3 percent of each class to
be devoted to slots, which translates to 11 more slots
than the recommendation approved by the ARC, according to Austrian.
Austrian said his proposal had the "full support" of
Alvanos. "[Austrian] called me and asked me if it would
work, and I said, 'Yeah,' Alvanos said.
Committee members, however, expressed doubts
over Austrian's proposal, since it honored neither admissions' desire for 10 percent slots nor coaches' desires
for 32 percent slots.
"

Both Austrian and the ARC presented their separate
proposals at last weekend's board meeting. Neither proposal was ever officially presented in written form, although ARC faculty members John Caskey and Hans
Oberdiek drafted an informal majority opinion. Austrian felt slighted by the board, saying that "I got the
opportunity to present [my proposal] Saturday morning after a lot of minds were made up."
The board took a straw vote during theirboard meeting Saturday and came away with a tally of 21 members
in favor of the ARC recommendation and eight against,
with one abstention. Minority members of the board
then lobbied not to step aside in order that the divisive-

ness of the board's decision would become the official
record.
Austrian criticized not only the ARC for having
"started with a presumption, in my opinion, that we
could not support 24 sports," but also the Board of Managers. "I think was heavily lobbied, heavily politicked,"
Austrian said of the board. "I have never seen a decision that involved secretive conversation between members of the board." He added, "There are facts the board
didn't know," including, for example, badminton's status as an NCAA emerging sport.
Austrian has said he will resign from the Board of

Managers if the decision is not reversed.
In criticizing the ARC's decision-making, Austrian
said, "There was an attempt to try and look at quantitative data that wold allow the committee to prove if

anything."
Keith confirmed the use of data, including such fig...

ures as the GPAs of athletes.
Gross said of the data on athletes, "Their GPAs are
on average lower, but not by much," and that "there were
differences in the GPAs of some teams." He cited a "disproportionately large enrollment in social sciences"
among athletes as another concern, but emphasized,
along with Keith, that behavioral problems were not a
concern.
"I think those numbers were a factor but not a decisive factor," Gross said.
Despite the mass of data gathered, Keith and other
ARC members consistently pointed to the irreconcilable
demands from admissions and athletics that made supporting 24 varsity teams an impossibility.
"We knew it was going to be painful," Keith said.
Once the recommendation was made, she added, it
seemed nearly impossible to delay the board's decision.
"If the board had waited and we released the recommendation, we could have one irrevocable damage to football recruiting," Keith said. "We thought it would be
divisive and we thought it would hurt recruiting, even
it was reported accurately."

Amherst in process of
similar review of athletics
Swarthmore's move to cut football may influence possible future
decisions of the Committee on the Place of Athletics at Amherst
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

Amherst College has assembled a committee to examine
its athletic program and look at athletic issues "nearly identical to the issues Swarthmore has been struggling with," according to Amherst Board of Trustees member Colin Diver,
chairman of the Committee on the Place of Athletics at
Amherst (CPAA).
"The scope of the jurisdiction of the committee is pretty
broad," Diver said, explaining that the committee will look at
questions concerning not only specific sports, but also the
impact the athletic program has on academics, admissions

priorities and overall college life.
The committee will also look at the credentials and aptitudes of athletes, the time demands sports place on them, the
tendency of athletes to self-segregate on campus, as well as
recruitment practices used in the admissions process.
"Obviously, concrete issues are also at hand." Diver said,
"The place of football is always the most salient issue in inquiries like this."
"The specific issue of whether to drop football altogether,
it's fair to say, is one of the options that has been suggested,
but is not being actively considered," Diver said.
He added that the committee will "probably end up making recommendations of an incremental nature."
The composition and charge of this committee are very
similar to the Athletic Review Committee at Swarthmore that
presented the recommendation adopted by the Board of Managers this Saturday to cut football, badminton and wrestling.
The CPAA was appointed by Amherst president Tom Gerety
at the beginning of this school year to conduct an extensive
review of many facets ofathletics at Amherst, and is slated to
submit a report at the end of the school year, most likely at
the annual meeting of the college trustees in May.
The committee consists of faculty, students and members
of the board of trustees.
Assistant Director of Sports Information Steve Vladeck 'Ol
said the issue of the role of sports at Amherst has emerged
has been one of the largest recurring campus issues during
the last couple of years, and has been an ongoing debatefor
much longer.
The Amherst committee was formed in part as a follow-up
to a report released in September 1999 by a separate college
committee that detailedadmissions practices over a five-year
period from 1994 to 1999 and charged that the admissions office often went too far in sacrificing academic standards for

athletes.
Athletics expanded dramatically at Amherst after the New
England Small College Athletic Conference lifted its ban on
participation in NCAA tournaments in 1993.After that, "things
exploded," according to Vladeck, with the addition of more
sports, increased recruiting and an increase in the winning
percentage of Amherst teams.
After Amherst's football team went through a three-year
losing streak in the mid-90s, however, further adjustments
were made to football recruiting. Amherst Athletic Director
Peter Gooding called these adjustments "too aggressive."
"People have said that the class of '9B was admitted for the
sole purpose of beating Williams at football," Vladeck said.
These admissions processes have been reversed, according to both Gooding and Vladeck, but much of the debate on
campus about the role ofathletics can be traced to the report.
Gooding said that protecting the integrity of the academic
program while allowing athletic teams to be competitive is
always an ongoing process. "Amherst wrestles with these issues all the time. It's always going to be a challenge," he said.
To help improve the balance between academics and athletics, Amherst has pursued measures to lower the athletic
competition within its conference such as supporting the creation of a new conference rule that will cap football squads at
75 players.

Vladeck said there has been a "concerted effort to cut back
slowly on the number of athletic admits we have."
The number ofrecruited athletes has topped 20 percent in
recent years, according to Diver. At issue, Diver said, is "not
having to step too far down into the applicant pool to get the
next lineman."

Amherst has 27 varsity teams, and 40 percent of the 1,668member student body participates in varsity athletics. According to Gooding, Amherst uses a "reasonably well-defined" slot system for a "relatively small number" of athletes in each entering class.
According to Diver, the committee is also considering
recommending a "numbers cap" on recruited athletes similar to the 10 to 15 percent number voted on last Friday by
Swarthmore's Board of Managers.
"One of the big concerns is trying to determine what
that number should look like and how we could justify a
particular number," Diver said.
"The real question here is reconciling school size with
athletic program size," Vladeck said.
At Amherst, Vladeck said, the debate centers on the socalled "helmet sports," which are football, hockey and lacrosse. Football in particular requires a large number of
highly specialized male athletes.
"Like Swarthmore, about 10 percent of our male student body plays football," Vladeck said.
These sports often shoulder the blame when complaints
are expressed about Amherst athletics, yet at the same
time, Vladeck said, "these are some of our proudest, oldest programs. The trustees would be very reluctant to cut

them."

"AMHERST IS NOT EXACTLY A
SCHOOL TO AVOID THE INFLUENCE
OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE TAKE
THE SMALLEST CHANGE VERY
SERIOUSLY."
The athletics program at Amherst has several advantages over Swarthmore's in that it has a larger studentbody,
a stronger program historically, a long-standing rivalry
with Williams and a very large number of double-sport athletes.

Traditionally, Vladeck said, "Amherst portrays itself as
being the fence-sitter between Swarthmore and Williams.
We don't have the same campus-wide support for athletics
that Williams does."

Swarthmore's decision to cut three ofits sports has been
met with surprise and interest at Amherst.
Gooding said the cuts at Swarthmore definitely have
been noticed and said the topic came up in a meeting he
had with Amherst's president today. As Gooding explained,
"Amherst and Swarthmore spend their time examining

each other's navels."
As an athletics director, Gooding said, "I think it's unfortunate that Swarthmore had to reach this decision. It
may be understandable, but it's regrettable."
Amherst students like Vladeck are concernedabout how
Swarthmore's decision may affect athletics at Amherst.
"Amherst is not exactly a school to avoid the influence of
our competitors. We take the smallest change very seriously," Vladeck said. "With what happened at Swarthmore,
there is concern for the precedent it sets and the impact it
may have on our committee," Vladeck said.
Diver said Swarthmore's decision may indeed lead to
an increase in call for an end to football at Amherst but
may also elicit the opposite response.
"The situation of Amherst is very similar to
Swarthmore's in that it is trying to be an absolutely firstrate academic institution and also maintain a small size,
it's co-educationaland it's trying to be the best in the business, as is Swarthmore," Diver said.
As the Amherst committee continues with its review of

athletics this year, "it will be factored in as an indicator
that a very comparable college has come to the conclusion
that the costs outweigh the benefits of the football program," he said.
"When a place like Swarthmore makes a decision like
this, folks at a place like Amherst will pay attention."

Team experiences ups and clowns over 128 years
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

The tradition that ended in last Friday's
decision to dissolve the football team began in 1878, when Swarthmore played its
opening game against the University of
Pennsylvania.
At that point, the sport was, in essence,
soccer plus physical contact: the teams had
25 pjayers each, they could touch the ball,
and physical contact was permitted.
The introduction of intercollegiate football at other schools had begun just nine
years earlier, when Rutgers and the College of New Jerseyat Princeton met for the
very first game. New rules convinced

Swarthmore's Quaker Board of Managers,
which at the time oversaw all activities
strictly, to permit the college's team to play
against UPenn in November 1878 and again
against Haverford in 1879.
Both games resulted in such ruinous
defeat that there was little drive to field a
team the next year.
A fire that razed Parrish Hall in 1881 and
forced students to temporarily relocate to
Media prevented any varsity face-off between Swarthmore and Haverford until the
spring of 1883. Their freshman teams
played one game in the interim.
A point system was devised in time for

thethird game between Swat and Haverford.
New rules intended to prevent injury worked
at the college: The Phoenix stressed that no
one was hurt in the 1883 game or in those
that took place in 1887 and 1888.
This stress on safety marked the beginning of a student effort to gain permission
from the Board of Managers to play games
with schools other than Haverford.
Though students originally believed this
rigidity came from a concern for players'
safety, the board actually prohibited play
primarily because Swarthmore was coeducational. A Phoenix editorial suggested
holding games in the absence of "so many
young ladies" but that their presence might
actually "be an incentive to fine play."
After students circulated a petition, still
with no results, the varsity, sophomore and
freshman teams began to play other
schools under "tacit permission" given by
the board. After a successful season, the
board gave official approval at the end of
1885, and Swarthmore became a genuine
member of the intercollegiate football system. Games remained infrequent, though:

the varsity team played six games between
1886 and 1887.
It was only after a senior called for an

Alumni Athletic Association thatfootball became encouraged rather than tolerated. The
college also opened a new gym that year, introduced a physical education requirement
and appointed a football coach, John Shell.
Shell's efforts were undermined by a problem we live with today
the size of the college. In the 1889-90 Halcyon, a student wrote,
"The one great disadvantage we labor under
is lack of numbers and this becomes most serious when differentbranches of athletics are
undertaken."
But the teams of 1891 and 1892 played ex-

cellent seasons, due largely to "Reds" Brooke
(class of 1893), the first Swarthmore alumnus
elected to the football hall of fame. By that
time, Swarthmore football was "a national
powerhouse," in the words of Philadelphia
Inquirer journalist Bob O'Neill.
New acting President Appleton said,
"What is worth doing at all is worth doing
well, and thatathletics are worth doingby our
students ... admits no matter of doubt... without physical health, all intellectual health may
be crushed out of existence." He emphasized,
however, that sports may only be played without interfering with academics.
In 1905, the year when Swarthmore ended
UPenn's 31-game Winning streak, Swarthmore
had a legendary player in "Tiny" Maxwell. A
Chicago coach once called Maxwell "the finest piece of football timber I have ever seen."
A newspaper photo of Maxwell'smashed face
after the game with UPennhorrified then-President Teddy Roosevelt into threatening to dismantle football if the violence was not stopped.
This would go on to change the game's rules, reducingplaying timeand creating a neutral zone.
Two years later, Anna T Jeanes, a wealthy
Quaker, bequeathed all of her coal lands and
mineral rights to the college on the grounds
that it give up all intercollegiate sports forever.
Swarthmore accepted and banned sports
for a year. In 1909, the football team started
again, with administration claiming it had
suspended the team not in response to Jeanes'
request but because winning had become too
important.
The team remained strong until 1930,but then
a series ofbad coaches pushed it into a slump.
The hiring of Lewis Elverson as coach
mended this to some extent in 1937, and the
team experienced ups and downs through the

'4os. Elverson would stick around through the

post-war years and early 19605, when he
headed a team that was notably poor. Still, he
managed to drive the team's record back up
in 1965 and 1966, when the Garnet Tide won
two conference championships in a row.
During the 19605, President Courtney

Smith told the first dean ofadmissions to help
create a winning football team, said Darwin
Stapleton '69, who is co-writing a biography
on Smith. The president was an adamant
sports fan who once said the first section of
the newspaper he read was sports.
In the late 19605, the team approached the
nationalrecord for the longest losing streak
in the history of college football. At the end of
1975, the streak had grown to 34 games, one
short of the national record.
On November X 1975, television crews arrived to record the historic thirty-fifth loss.
But word spread wildly through the campus

Haverford dropped football 30 years ago
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

The furor at Swarthmore for the past few days over the
decision to cut football has a familiar ring for those who
remember when Haverford eliminated its football program

nearly 30 years ago.
Haverford played its final season of football in the fall
of 197 L Its performance that season was relatively strong,
according to Haverford Athletic Director Greg
Kannerstein, and even earned the team a 22-21 victory over

Swarthmore.

In 1972, however, football had only 17 returning players. The team attempted to play another season and got as
far a first scrimmage in which several players were injured, further reducing the number ofable-bodiedplayers.
After the scrimmage, the president temporarily suspended football, following the recommendations of the
coach and the athletic director.
For a generation, this gave Haverford the distinction of
being the Quaker-founded liberal arts college in suburban
Philadelphia without football. This distinction disappeared
with Saturday's decision by the Swarthmore Board of Managers to eliminate the football program.
Several years after suspending football, Haverford considered resuscitating the program. This rebirth never hap-

pened, both because of serious financial struggles the college was facing in the 1970s and the fact that the debate on
how and when to make the college coed shoved all other
issues to the sidelines.
Haverford Sports InformationDirector John Douglas noted
that the 1970s were a time in which the social and political
climate was not favorablefor football at either Swarthmore or
Haverford. Coming out of the Vietnam conflict, football was
perceived as an athletic version ofwar, he said.
Although Kannerstein noted that the reasons behind
Haverford's decision many years ago and Swarthmore's
very recent decision are rooted in very different causes,
he said he is "very sympathetic" toward Swarthmore.

Even though Haverford football was eliminatedbecause

it had died out, rather thanbecause of a decision by a board
of trustees, Haverford still experienced an outcry from
some alumni. Kannerstein said it will be interesting to see
how the Haverford campus reacts to the news.
"It has not escaped our notice," Douglas said. "There
have been a whole range of reactions, even humor."
Douglas said Haverford has not entertained any plans
to reinstate football, noting that if Swarthmore had such
difficulty maintaining a viable team with 1400 students, it
would be even harder for Haverford to form a team with a
student body of 1100.

at halftime: "They're winning!" The next
day, three-inch headlines in The Phoenix
proclaimed simply "WE WIN!"
By the early 1980s, the team was doing well
enough to arouse suspicion at the notion that
a small, academically elite school could produce a winning team. This even resulted in a
national comic strip called "Tank
McNamara" parodying a college whose students were humiliatedby its team's victories.
Controversy surrounding the college's
overarching philosophy on athletics, especially football, continued. In April 1982,
President Theodore Friend accepted recommendations on "perceived tensions between athletes and non-athletes, recruitment of athletes" and a five-year experiment with a football coach. Friend stressed
the need for integration offootball players
into the life of the college.

Little change at BU after football cut
With the Board of Managers' Saturday decision,
Swarthmore will join the ranks of the 42 percent ofactive
Division EI schools that do not sponsor a varsity football
program. While a numberof colleges and universities have
been stepping up their participation in the so-calledfootball
"arms race" to field the best teams and build the best athletics facilities in recent years, a numberof other schools have
decided to take an opposite route by cutting their football

programs entirely.
Boston University, a school with an undergraduate population many times the size of Swarthmore, eliminated its
football program after the end of the 1997 season.
According to Boston University Athletic Director Gary
Strickler, a desire to re-allocate financial resources to a wider
variety ofsports played a role in thedecision to cut the team.

He said it was "also a reaction to the fact that the football
team was not well-supported by the students or alumni."
The decision received a negative reaction from some elements of its community. Strickler said, however, that many
of those complaining the loudest were "people who had not
been attending games who suddenly decided football was
important to them."

Strickler said without football the overall atmosphere of
the campus has changed very little.

Cameras, secrecy
create divisive tone
Administrators mishandle situation
under the media's intense scrutiny
BY NATHAN

ASHBY-KUHLMAN

Just hours after the Board of Managers voted to cut the
varsity football, wrestling and badminton teams Saturday afternoon, members of the football team had heard the news
and had begun planning a protest rally for that night.
That rally set a tone of divisiveness that continued at Sunday afternoon's meeting in the fieldhouse, at which President
Al Bloom, Provost Jennie Keith and Board of Managers chair
J. Lawrence Shane '56 faced students, parents and alumni angry over the decision
and television cameras they invited

along.
Talking to hundreds of booing or interrupting students and
parents in front of the cameras was not the way Bloom had
wanted to tell the news to the rest of campus, he said in an
interview Wednesday.
"It was devastating to me and to Jenny [Keith] and to Larry
[Shane]," said Bloom, who said he had wanted to meet with
affected sports teams in person before making a public announcement of the decision.
What the Board of Managers and the Athletic Review Committee had originally intended to be a private decision ballooned into a public fiasco
complete with localand national
only hours after the board rendered it. A
media coverage
protest organized by disgruntled football players Saturday
night attracted two local television stations and a host of lo-

cal newspapers.

By Monday, the college was crawling with reporters and
photographers from The New York Times, The Chronicle of
Higher Education, The Philadelphia Inquirer and numerous
other newspapers and magazines. Bloom and the college's senior staff were answering as many questions from outside
media as they were from the community.
Bloom acknowledged that, in retrospect, administrators
could have handled notifying the campus in a better way and
averted some of the media firestorm. But in light of questions
over whether the decision-making process should have been

more open, he defended the Athletic Review Committee's
work.
"You can't ask students to talk among each other about
•which program should be cut
my program or my
roommate's program," Bloom said. He said that the question
of whether to cut sports and which ones, like that of whether
or not to grant tenure to a faculty member, is one that needs
to be decided in private by a group of representatives of interested parties.
Calling that a "representative democracy" approach as opposed to a "town meeting" style, Bloom said the Athletic Review Committee's work required it to stay private.
"The committee thought it was not a good idea to lay out a
map of what we might cut," Keith said. "We thought it would
be divisive and it would endanger recruiting."
Director of News and Information Tom Krattenmaker noted
that at many other schools, such a private decision would not
be unusual.
"I think at any school ithas to be made in the confidential
way it was made here," Krattenmaker said.
But the difference, he said, was that at Swarthmore, consensual decision-making processes are much more the
*

norm.

"I certainly realized that this decision [between keeping
deliberations secret and making them public] would be painful for the committee," Keith, the ARC chair, said. "I was very

torn between the benefits of the inclusive process and [recognizing that this is] the kind of the decision that really was not
an appropriate topic for the wide community discussion we
normally use."
Administrators also said that while they agonized over how
the cutting of football would affect current players, they eventually came to the conclusion that it was in the long-term interest of the school to cut the team.
"It was the hardest decision I've ever had to-make," said

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

An angry parent takes control of the microphone at Sunday's meeting in the fieldhouse as students watch and
television cameras record the incident. The cameras at the Sunday meeting seemed to inspire a confrontational
atmosphere, making open dialogue very difficult to achieve.
Bloom.

"I've thought about that a lot," said Krattenmaker. "I

have reached the conclusion that there is no good time to
cut a program. There are always people who are going to
be hurt by it."
Bloom noted that he would have preferred to phase the
football team out, allowing current students to continue
to participate until they graduate. But because a team requires a minimum number of players each year and no

new players would be recruited, the team would soon have
too few players to compete.
Bloom said he was most distressed by a sense among
some students that the decision was designed to weaken
athletics in general.
"It's [seen as] affirming a sense that the college devalues athletics," Bloom said. "[But] I believe we'll have a
sports program that is excellent at attracting students to
Swarthmore for athletics."

Coaches speculate about future

Many worry that Board of Managers' decision may make it difficult for remaining 21 varsity sports programs to attract athletes
BY SONIA SCHERR
Two days after the board of managers voted to cut
football, badminton, and wrestling from the intercollegiate athletic program, interviews with coaches of the
remaining 21 teams revealed sadness, uncertainty, and
in some cases, hope that the college's future actions will
demonstrate its commitment to improving the quality
of athletics here.
Many coaches questioned the board's decision to limit
the number of athletes on campus to 10 percent to 15 percent, and felt that sports programs couldhave been saved
if this percentage were set slightly higher. Almost all
the coaches agreed that the decision would affect the
other athletic programs as well as the general environment on campus.
"I'm not in favor of a short-term fix to address what I
feel is a much bigger picture," said women's field hockey
and lacrosse coach Karen Borbee. "I'm concerned about
the culture on campus, the labeling of athletes, and the
future of all the athletic programs, as well as the direction of the college."
Expressing a recurring theme among coaches, Borbee
said that cutting teams would diminish the diversity that
athletes bring to the college. "By eliminating sports,
you've eliminated a pretty big portion of a certain type
of student with a certain type of interest, and that will
definitely affect the culture on this campus," Borbee said.
Dropping teams will also impact the specific culture of
athletics to which other student-athletes belong, Borbee
said, and could have a potentially negative impact on
the entire athletic program.
But the decision could also affect the athletic program
in more tangible ways, coaches say, making it more difficult to attract perspective student-athletes and to retain athletes who are already here.
"It's not going to help recruiting," women's basketball coach Adrienne Shibles said. "The trust has been

shattered for recruits and student-athletes on campus."
Women's soccer coach Amy Brunner said, "Some of
my students won't want to be here anymore because
people like them won't wantto be here anymore.... We're
going to lose more than male athletes at this school."

The loss of athletes who play more than one sport may
also affect some remaining programs, according to coaches.
"To find people to throw on the field will be even harder,"
cross-country and track coach Pete Carroll said, "because
now I'll have to find special athletes rather than dual sport
athletes."
Both Brunner and Shibles said that simply cutting sports

"ANYTIME YOU MAKE SOMEONE CRY,
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. OBVIOUSLY,
FOOTBALL, WRESTLING, AND BADMINTON
HERE HAVE BEEN DEEMED WORTHY HERE
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. WHAT HAS
CHANGED SUDDENLY?"
does not address the issues facing athletics at Swarthmore.
"The decision is worthless unless other decisions are combined with it," Brunner said. "This is the very first step. We
need to know the rest of the steps before we know if this was
a good decision or not." According to Brunner, further steps
that must be made include revising the slot system, as well
as defining what is mean by an "athlete" and a "recruit."
Brunner believes that the administration has at least
addressed these issues during its deliberations even if it
has not yet made definite decisions. "I know they want athletics here and are going to do what they can to make them
strong," she said "I have to give them my faith that they
will do that for us with whatever [future] decisions they
make." But she said she will feel better once the administration presents additional plans for changing the athletic
program.
Most coaches said they were unhappy that sports
es-

pecially football
were cut.
"I would have hoped there would have been other solutions," Borbee said. "I counted on them. This is not what I
wanted to happen...l think that 24 sports can work at
Swarthmore College."
While acknowledging the difficulty of reaching consensus on the issue and the need to make a decision early so
as not to hurt recruiting for other sports, Brunner said that

with a number ofboard members being indecisive, "some
further exploration of options would have been nice."
She added, "I feel that there potentially could have
been better options out there than cutting football." But
she also said that the administration must have believed
the cuts were necessary, since it went ahead with them
despite the risk of negative reactions from the college
community.
Carroll said, "Anytime you make someone cry, there's
something wrong."
He wondered, "Obviously, football, wrestling, and
badminton here have been deemed worthy here for
many, many years. What has changed suddenly?"
Several coaches pointed out that cutting football is
related to the decision to limit the number of athletes to
10 percent to 15 percent of the student body.
Most coaches said they do not agree with the 10 per
cent to 15 percent goal, raising questions about the rationale behind this decision and expressing doubts about
whether this number would allow teams to be successful.

Borbee said, "I'm not in favor of 10 to 15 percent, I've
never been in favor of 10 to 15 percent, and I don't even
think that we should be talking about numbers and percentages when we're talking about students with an interest."
"Presently and for the last two years, [student-athletes] are looked at within a percentage as one-dimensional individuals, when they are not," Davis said. She
pointed out that students who play sports also contribute to many other areas of the college, including the resident advisors' program, chorus, orchestra, newspaper,
debate club, and other activities. "The athletic portion
has been way, way, way too quantified."
According to Davis and interim men's tennis coach
Chris Pearson '95, if the athletic department is recruiting for 21 sports, limiting athletes to 10 percent to 15 per
cent of the student body allows for two or three recruited
athletes per sport, which will not sustain a successful
intercollegiate program.
Referring to a proposal from board member Neil Austrian '6l that called for keeping football and allowing
approximately 17 percent of students to be recruited athletes, Pearson said, "I think that if they truly wanted to
keep football, they could do 17 percent." He said he
thought the sport was cut "because they don't want it
here, not because the numbers don't work."
Pearson felt that there is a difference between the
college's rhetoric about the decision and the reality. "If
they're going to make these big decisions, they should be
honest about their feelings behind them," he said. "They
have to be honest that they don't want a sport here."
Many coaches said they could not fully comment on
the process used to make the decision because they did
not yet have enough information about it. Carroll said,
"In fairness to the committee, they did a good job of meeting with the athletic department, having a dialogue, and
listening to our concerns. What they did with that I'm
not really sure."
Pearson said that the coaches should have been able
to read and react to different proposals before a final
decision was made. The athletic department met with
the Athletic Review Committee and recommended that
athletes comprise 30 percent of the student body. How-

ever, Pearson believes that after the ARC made its deci-

sion about the percentage of recruited-athletes it felt
comfortable having on campus, there should have been
opportunities for discussion of how the athletic department might have been able to make its programs work
within the committee's guidelines.
Now coaches are waiting to see whether the decision
is indeed a move toward improving the quality of the athletic program. Some are more optimistic than others.
"I don't trust that they'll commit to the other sports,"
Pearson said. "[This decision] is a potential Trojan
Horse.... I believe it could be a first step in the further
minimizing of sports here."
Davis said, "Based on conversation and meetings with
the president and provost, I do believe that they are sincerely dedicated to the improvement and success of our
intercollegiate teams and what remains is to develop a
system that works, which I also feel they are committed
to doing."

Faculty greet board's decision supportively
BY SONIA SCHERR
Most faculty interviewed this week said
they support the Board of Managers' vote
to cut football from the intercollegiate athletic program. While they generally did not
see any major problems with the way the
administrationreached its decision given
the circumstances, there were some faculty
members who felt that the process might
have been improved upon. One faculty
member seriously disagreed with the process used to make the decision, and several faculty members declined to comment

on any aspect of the issue.
Expressing the opinion of the majority of faculty interviewed, economics professor Steve Golub said, "I've taught a lot
of football players, and they're good students and fine people, and I have nothing
against football. But on the whole I sup-

port the decision because we're simply too
small a college to have so many sports
To have a viable athletic program, there's
no question we need to cut back."
There was widespread consensus
among faculty that fielding a football program takes more resources than other
sports, particularly in terms of the number of recruited students needed to field a
...

team.
While emphasizing that he feels badly for

thefootball coaches and players, Golub said,
"If you have to put so much priority into
football, other sports are going to suffer."
Eric Jensen, who also stressed that he
is not against athletics in any way, said the
quantity of student resources used by foot-

ball could potentially affect non-sports programs at the college as well, including
smaller majors. "It's hard to do, but prob-

ably the right thing to do for the college as
a whole," he said of the decision. "The bigger any one thing is, the smaller the pool
is to do anything else."
Golub said, "The basic point is that we
can't do it all unless we want to change the
nature of the college and give even more
priority to athletes than we do now."
While engineering professor Bruce
Maxwell '9l does not have a problem with
football itself, he feels that the program is
worth re-examining if the college has to go
to great lengths to sustain a successful
team. "If [football] doesn't affect admissions standards or the ability to bring in
diversity, more power to them," he said.
"But I'm not necessarily convinced that
has been the case."

Nevertheless, some professors said they
were sorry to see the football program end.
Physics professor Frank Moscatelli said he
does not dispute the findings of the Athletic
Review Committee (ARC) and supports the
process by which the decision was made. But,
while not a football fan, Moscatelli pointed out
that the sport has a strong tradition at many
colleges in the United States, and said he is

"disappointed and saddened to see a tradition

like football end."

Spanishprofessor Joan Friedman also supports the committee and feels that the college
should abide by its findings. But she expressed
regret that football would no longer be avail-

able for students with that interest. "I think
that students who apply to Swarthmore are
self-selective, and incidentally if they wantto
play football, or a musical instrument, or
spend time in the observatory
they should
be able to."
Friedman also said that she enjoyed the diversity that football players bring to her
classes.
The link between diversity and football is
also important to political science professor
Raymond Hopkins, who said he felt "saddened" by the decision to end the program. "I
don't see that we've addressed the issue ofhow
to have a truly diverse student body without
football," he said. "I would like to see people
who are really skilled athletes be part of the

student population."

Most faculty members said they did not
have enough information to say whether the

college had made the right decision to cut badminton and wrestling. Maxwell, however,
called eliminating badminton a "bad decision"
since the sport has traditionally been a strong
team and does not require much equipment
or recruiting.
Even those faculty who supported the

administration's decision had some reservations about the way it was reached, however.
Golub suggested that the committee could
have solicited feedback on "certain broad options it was considering," though he also said
he understood the need to keep some aspects
of the deliberations confidential and felt the
entire process was generally adequate.
Classics professor Gil Rose, along with several other faculty members, approved of the
committee's decision but thought it was unfortunate that it had to act under the pressure of
time constraints. Nevertheless, Rose said, "If
we were going to make these changes, I believe
it was important that we make them now so
they would come into effect for the next year."
Maxwell thought the timing of the decision

was "really, really poor," since it came after
the college invested substantial resources in
improving the football team. "It bothers me
that you're turning your back on some people
you've made a commitment to," he said.
Of those professors interviewed, physics professor Peter Collings felt most strongly that "a
mistake" was made in the process. Collings said
his impression is that the ARC decided months
ago to set the target number of applicants given
special consideration for athletics at 10 percent
to 15 percent of the incoming class. "That decision has major implications for the type ofcommunity we have here, and the entire community should have been given the chance to reflect and ponder the question" of the appropriate balance point in terms ofnumber of athletes,
Collings said. "And this was not done."
Collings, an unofficial faculty advisor for the
football team, disagrees with the decision to cut

sports at this time, saying that the administration had not yet completed the necessary
background research for a decision of such

importance and complexity. After attending
a presentation that was made to the faculty
several weeks ago, Collings said his impression was that the committee "had quite a
bit of workleft to do," though it did not say
at that time whether a recommendation
would be made to the Board of Managers at
its December meeting.
Collings said that people felt "crushed
and betrayed" by the decision. He is also
worried that the decision will send a message to perspective students that the college
doesn't appreciate intercollegiate athletics.
"We're all deeply affected by this decision," he said, "and I hope that out of this
comes something that ultimately strength-

ens the college community."

Alumni response to end of football divided
BY TED

CHAN

Much like students here, Swarthmore's alumni are finding themselves divided and shaken by the recent athletic
cuts of football, wrestling and badminton. A number of
alumni reacted with shock and outrage at the decision and
the process by which it was made.
Some of these alumni indicated that they planned to
protest by letter writing or revoking financial support.
Others, including Eugene Lang '3B, expressed faith in the
Board of Manager's direction.
Board of Managers member Neil Austrian '6l, an ardent
football supporter, has been one of the leaders in expressing dismay. The former President of the NFL has sat on
the board for 22 years, and felt that neither the decision

itself nor the process was fair.
"I'm starting with the assumption that the system was
not broken," said Austrian. "The real issue here was what
kind of college do we really want?"
Austrian felt that the perception that athletes were unwelcome on campus began with the administration. "I think
it starts at the top with where the president and the administration are vocal about supporting the scholar-ath24

lete as a part of the college, with an emphasis on the scholar
part," he said. "It starts where the administration doesn't
schedule seminars during practice times and understands that
there are away games."

Alumni express concerns with process
Austrianalso expressed serious concern about the way that
college business was conducted and the board's failure to reach
consensus on the cuts.
Lang, too, was disappointed by the way the scenario in the
meeting played out. The Chairman of the Board emeritus expressed resentment at "the militancy of the few who did what
they could to undercut the responsibility of the board and
president." He continued to say, "That's not the way things
should be done. You can close ranks or you can be gracious
and accept the view of the overwhelming majority and let life
go on."

The lack of consensus was a problem for Lang. "I also dedespite the almost unanimous recommendation of Jennie Keith's multi-constituency
committee and of the manifest tradition of acting by consensus
have refused to respect the Board's proud tradition of
acting on consensus," he said. "In the past, there have been
plore the action of the few who

inirreconcilable disagreements that Board members
cluding me
have had over issues of major substance
and emotional content. I also recall in each case that, in
the Quaker tradition, the few recalcitrants 'stood aside' to
let consensus express the will of the majority."
"My understanding of a Quaker meeting is that a large
minority does not need to stand aside," Austrian said, defending the right of the dissenters who feel strongly about
an issue. "You vote your conscience."
The "large minority" and the "overwhelming majority" seem to indicate a different perception of the proportion of dissenters. Barbara Mather '65 confirmed that there
were eight dissenters, but it remained unclear how many
were in favor of the proposal. "[The eight board members]
did not all dissent for the same reason. There were a variety of different issues in terms of timing, procedure and
substance," she said.
Jim Noyes, a Quaker and the only board member who
is not an alumnus, also expressed dismay with the process. Noyes was one of the dissenters and felt this deci-

Badminton, wrestling victims of ARC cuts

sion wouldhurt the college in the long run.
He seriously questioned the process and
whether the percentages were valid and
necessary. "I wanted to do whatever's best
for the college and I don't feel that way. I
think this will hurt the college."
Noyes added that he felt that the issue

needed further discussion and that some
of the numbers brought to the table by the

faculty regarding the percentage of athletes
the college should have were questionable.
The faculty first suggested 10 percent or
less and then compromised on 14.2 percent
when the first number was thought to be
too low. Noyes questioned both the need
for the percentage and the seemingly arbitrary nature of the percentages. "The board
did not have adequate time to really discuss the issues," he said.

Positive responses
Despite his disappointment with the

lack of consensus and the break from the
college's traditional manner of doing business, Lang supported the decision and said
that it was important the decision be made
right away for the sake of the admissions
process. While he sympathizes with the
ordeal the football players are going

through, he emphasized that the decision
was properly considered and made in the
best interest of the college.
"We must realize that what comes first
is the interest of the college," said Lang. "I
just feel that football is an 800-lb. gorilla
that our athletic program cannot support.
For that reason, I unequivocally support

the decision of the board."
Other alums supported the cutsor expressed only mild concern.
"While I think it's unfortunate for any

program or department to be cut, I don't feel
as devastated as if it were an academic program or department," said Tim Dodge '79.
"I've got enough confidence in the board

to believe this decision was made thoughtfully," said Jack Riggs '64, a former basketball and lacrosse player who was President of

the Alumni Association and now serves as the
Chairman of the Annual Fund.
Lang also added that he felt "the well-being of the institution cannot be subordinated
to an activity that has outstripped the capac-

ity of the college to handle it."
Additionally, Lang emphasized that the
athletic program is not being cut entirely, but
restructured. "Whatever the merits and attractions of football, it is just one sport. Unfortunately, an adequate football program de-

Working the web
Some alums have already begun to or-

Robert Steelman '92 and Steve Toy 'B9
have launched Web sites to serve as hubs
of information for the alumni protest. Toy
said a number of smaller sites and lists had
been set up to facilitate collective alumni
action, but that the wave of protest had
quickly overwhelmed the capacity of those G
tools, so he decided to create a central site
with unlimited bandwidth.
The site includes background information as well as links to articles, letters and
other discourse on the subject.
Already the site has been propagated
with a significant number of distraught
lettersfrom alumni. Toy expects that there
will be hundreds of letters posted on the
site before long.
"People are really justreally ticked off,"
said Toy, who played four different intercollegiate sports for Swarthmore. "We're
trying to get one place for all the activity,

Police arrest suspect in mugging
BY GERRIT HALL
Swarthmore Borough Police placed a suspect under arrest for last Thursday's mugging, according to Swarthmore Borough Police ChiefBrian Craig.
Two students were robbed at gunpoint in
thetunnelunder therailroad tracks lastThursday around 9:30 p.m. in what may be a string
ofrobberies in the area, according to Craig.
"One of the students made an identification on a photo lineup," said Craig. "Based
on that, we arrested a juvenile."
The alleged perpetrator already had a
warrant out for his arrest for a previous robbery the night the students were mugged.
Although one alleged perpetrator has
been taken into custody, the other two remain at large.
"We're trying to get more information to
track down the other individuals," said
Craig. The police department does now have
suspects as to the identities of the two other
perpetrators in the mugging.
The incident is similar to several others
that have occurred in nearby towns, said
Craig, who attended a meeting Tuesday with
representatives from several other police departments to consider the possibility that
theserobberies were perpetrated by the same
people.

The two student victims, who asked that
theirnames not be released, were returning
from the fire station in the ville by means of
the tunnel.
At the top of the stairs entering the tunnel, they saw one of the three assailants
standing against the wall by the mouth of
the tunnel.
"I thought, at the time, it was just some
ville kid," one of the victims said.
As they walked past him, they noticed
another person at the other end of the tunnel, who grabbed the female victim. She
screamed and flailed her arms, and her assailant ran away.
"I guess he was scared people would come
and find people accosting her," the male victim said. "I think the scream really scared
him away."

Meanwhile, the man at the tunnel mouth
by the stairs had thrown the male victim to
the ground and pulled him back up, causing
him some scratches.
The female victim was running away at
this point when she noticed that the other
student wasn't with her.
"I looked back and saw [the male victim].
He had his arms pinned behind him. As I
went to help, [the assailant] drew a gun," she

said. "I froze. [The male victim] saw me and
my face, and he froze, too."
The assailant forced the gun into the
male student's back, asking for their credit
cards and money. The female student emptied her pockets, and the male student threw
in his wallet. The thenran away, catching a
glimpse of a third accomplice's elbow, who
may have been guarding the tunnel.
They fled to Mertz, where they immediately called Public Safety. Public Safety took
the call and asked for some information
about the incident.
"At 9:51 p.m., we got a call. We spoke with
one of the victims until 9:53, when we dispatched a communications officer, who dispatched public safety officers," said Owen
Redgrave, director ofPublic Safety. "At 9:55,
they were in the tunnel."
By 9:57 p.m., they reported that "there

was nobody in the immediate vicinity," according to Redgrave. At this time, Public
Safety also called the Swarthmore police.
Meanwhile, the two walked back to
Willets by themselves, and, not knowing
that Public Safety had already done so,
called the borough police. Swarthmore police arrived on the scene at 9:59 p.m.
"We were happy with the response we got
from local police departments," said
Redgrave. "We had a lotof people searching."
For the rest of the evening, Public Safety
and the police investigated the scene.
Redgrave saidPublic Safety was "relatively
sure" the assailants weren't on campus immediately after the incident.
Although the Swarthmore police are in
charge of the investigation, Craig denied
that this will set a precedent leading towards
increased police presence on campus.
The two victims had high praise for the
police department. "Swarthmore police did
an impressive job [in] comforting us, et
cetera," said the male victim. "They're very
much on top of things."
Their praise did not extend to Public
Safety, however. "I still have a lot of beef
with Public Safety," said the male victim,
who thought several aspects of the
department's response were slow. "The
thing that sort of bugged me about it is how
long it took Public Safety to tell the campus. It took them pretty much a day."
"It takes a while to get accurate information compiled," said Redgrave.
Public Safety officer Pat Laurenzi agreed.
"The worst thing you can do is start run-

ning around with partial information here
and partial information there," he said.

The male victim said that the incident

The mugging occurred in the tunnel under the train tracks at the end of Magill Walk.
"does bring up the role of Public Safety."
Redgrave said he is going to look at the
role of the Garnet Patrol and see if it can be
made even more effective, but he predicted
"no policy changes at this time."
Overall, most people have been amazed
by the prospect of a mugging at gunpoint in
the relatively law-abiding village.
"Armed robbery is certainly out of character for the community," said Craig.
Although Swarthmore students have re-

acted with disbelief, they still feel very safe
on campus. When asked, few said that this
incident made them feel less safe.
"I think it was a random incident," Dan
Dan 'O3 said.
"Am I more cautious? Yes. Do I feel less
safe? No," Daniel Krausz 'O2 said.
Indeed, both Craig and Redgrave pointed
out the need for caution. "My concern here
has been that people have been a little bit too
complacent," Craig said.

Council takes stance against board's decision
BY JON EHRENFELD

In the wake of this weekend's momentous decision by
the Board of Managers to cut three athletic teams, Student
Council's Monday meeting focused primarily on reaction
to the cuts.
Despite the members' varying opinions of the board's
process and decision, the council voted to take a stance
opposing the process the Board used to eliminate the teams.
"I emphatically endorse any action this body can take
to ensure that in the future any decision of this magnitude
is first brought before the students," said Delonte Gholston
'O2, Board of Managers observer.
Before the vote on the stance was taken, the council
members voted on how the decision must be reached. Such
an important resolution, some members reasoned, war-

ranted

a consensus among the council. Because this motion passed, the council's stance opposing the board's decision passed with a consensus.

Since the official stance of the Student Council will dictate the action it takes, the members were concerned about
adequately representing the students. "We're supposed to

26

DECEMBER 07, 2000

THE PHOENIX

represent the whole student body," said co-chair Jennifer Pao
'OL Although the council discussed ways of more precisely
determining student opinion, the members agreed that there

was no time for that option. Ultimately, the council agreed
that the prevailing sentiment among students was that regardless of the decision, the process was flawed.
In addition, the council agreed that its stance must facilitate action and cooperation on the part of the administration

and students.
"I think we need to take a strong stance, and a active

stance, and not be neutral," said outreach chair Neil
Cavanaugh 'O3. The council members decided that Student
Council's responsibility in this situation is to act as a mediator between the students and the decision-makers of the

administration.
Though any action from the council will occur at a later
date, members raised two proposals. One was a meeting between the student members of the Athletic Review Committee and either the members of the cut teams or the public. The
other was the declassification of the board's Saturday meeting in which the decision was made. The second proposal
would allow board observer Gholston to explain in greater

detail the events that led to the cuts.
Both proposals will be discussed further at a later date.
The council members were split over the idea of a meeting
with the student members of the ARC.
Some questioned the efficacy of such forums, citing the
heated nature of both the public meeting on Sunday and
Monday's fireside chat.
"They'll have the same questions when they leave as
when they came in," said Brendan Silverman 'O2, representative to the College Planning Committee. Other members disagreed, stressing the importance of public involvement in the issue.
The council will meet again later in the week to further

discuss the actions that it will undertake. Co-chair Jordan
Brackett 'Ol indicated that at present, there is no clear
course of action. Only after further deliberation will the
council know how it intends to involve itself in the situation.
At the meeting, the council also passed a proposal
brought forward by the Student Budget Committee Treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2. The proposal called for a $37 increase in the Student Activities Fee for next year.

SPECIAL SECTION

STATEMENTS

Board, committee explain their positions
To the community:
As the debate over the Athletic Review Committee's and
the Board of Managers' decision to cut the varsity football,
wrestling and badminton programs intensified this week,
The Phoenixfelt that it was exceedingly important that some
written report or statement emerge from both the
committee and the board. Until the facts are put out in the

open and the decision-making process is made transparent,
it is difficult for anyone in the community to make real
progress in this debate.
To that end, The Phoenix offered unlimited space to
make a written statement to President Al Bloom and Provost
Jennie Keith, the chair of the ARC, as well as space to
anyone from the board or the committee they would like to

write. What follows is unedited except for the most basic
changes in format, and by no means represents the views

ton is that it will become a club sport. As is the case now, it
will not receive recruiting assistance in the form of admission spaces. However, it will continue to receive its current
level of support, including its part-time coach, and will play
a similar schedule and be eligible for national championships. Given the decline of wrestling at the Division 111 level
all over the nation, and particularly the decline in participation at Swarthmore, we do not expect this sport to shift to
club or intramural status.
The long tradition of football at Swarthmore, coupled
with the remarkable accomplishments since 1998 of coach
Pete Alvanos and his players, made the decision to discontinue football extraordinarily painful and difficult. Nevertheless, the Board decided that given the number of admissions places reserved for athletic recruitment, and the desire to have a broad and balanced intercollegiate program
available to the campus community, it was not possible to
continue football at Swarthmore.
The Board of Managers also asked the committee to continue to examine and address those aspects of the
Swarthmore culture which lead to the perception by some
of our athletes that they are being stereotyped and devalued. The committee also expects to study and make any recommendations needed to support the athletic opportunities
offered to students at Swarthmore in club and intramural

last Saturday's Board meeting. My vote resulted from my
beliefs that the proposed restructuring is essential to create an athletic program that would have maximum participation from and maximum support of the entire Swarthmore
community and that nothing less is acceptable as the goal
of our athletic program. I also voted as and when I did because I believed that, no matter how difficult it was to contemplate making a decision that lacked at the moment of its
making Swarthmore's traditional consensus, taking action
on Saturday was the ethically responsible thing to do. I
would like briefly to share with you how I reached these
conclusions.
Three years ago the Board endorsed the administration's
initiative to revitalize Swarthmore's athletic program by
strengthening our commitment to varsity football through
the hiring ofCoachAlvanos and active recruiting of scholar/
athletes to play on the team. While I think the entire Board
hoped for the success of the initiative, I must confess that I
for one had concerns that a sport requiring the participation of upwards of 60 players (or almost 10% of the resident
male student population) would prove too big a drain on
the resources of an institution that for many well-considered reasons had fixed its size at under 1400 students. In
retrospect and in light of the information made available to
us by the work of the Athletic Review Committee, I think
the Board may have erred three years ago in not devoting
more time before endorsing the initiative to the demands
that our football program would place on our resources.
However, it is never a solution to an error to fail to have the
courage to correct it when the evidence requires correction,
The Board has continued over the last three years to review the progress of the initiative, most notably and recently
through the Board's participation in the work of the Athletic Review Committee, which was established last year
and reported to the Board at both our September and December meetings.
The reports of the Committee persuaded me that the
health of a diversified and gender-equal athletics program
did indeed require a reallocation of our human resources
away from football (and wrestling) and toward more balanced support of our continuing sports. In reaching this
decision, I was particularly moved by the Committee's conclusion that the recruiting commitments we were currently
making to our athletics program would have to be increased
to reach the goal of acceptable competitive status in our
various sports
a conclusion not disputed in substance
but only in quantity of increase by the minority report from
the Committee.
Thus persuaded that the Committee's recommendation
was correct and inevitable, I was nevertheless concerned
that some of our members were of very different views and
that, in any event, the Board might once again be chargeable with acting precipitously. But ultimately inaction, even
if described as waiting for a Swarthmore consensus to develop, appeared to me to be irresponsible. To take no action
would be to leave in place a program that no one thought
could be successful without change. To leave that program
in place while announcing that the Board was continuing
to review and might terminate the football program would,
I believe, have condemned football to death by uncertainty
and insecurity. To leave the program in place without that
announcement, on the other hand, would be ethically unacceptable and utterly unfair to coaches and to athletes already on campus or in recruitment.
Although I do not believe, for the reasons I have tried to
articulate above, that it would have been feasible to continue an open debate of the issues before the Board made a
decision on the Committee's recommendation, I strongly
believe and devoutly hope that the dialogue on the way to
make Swarthmore athletics an integral part of the fabric of
Swarthmore will be ongoing and will help the Board and
the Administration attain that goal. Most importantly, I hope
that we will find in our ongoing discussions the sense of
community that seems to have been tattered by recent

Dear Swarthmore Community,
A year ago the Board of Managers created an Athletic
Review Committee to undertake a comprehensive review
of the College's intercollegiate athletic program and make
recommendations to strengthen it in ways consistent with
Swarthmore's educational mission. The committee's membership (listed below) includes representatives of the faculty, administration and Board as well as the co-captains of
four varsity teams.
In the first phase of its work, the committee explored

the effects on both athletics and admissions at
Swarthmore of the changing Division 111 athletic environment in which our teams participate. Increasingly,
fielding competitive teams requires specifically recruitofing and enrolling an increasingly large proportion
ten even the sizeable majority
of many team rosters.
Further (although we realize this may be surprising
and uncomfortable news for many in the Swarthmore
community,) this recruiting effort requires us to allocate
an adequate number of admissions spaces for intercollegiate sports. The experiences of other colleges have consistently demonstrated this need, and our own experience
makes clear that, where we have done so, we have been
successful in turning around programs and sustaining
competitive quality.
Based on information provided to the committee by
our coaches, to ensure the competitiveness of all 24 of
our current intercollegiate sports, we would have to grant
priority to athletic ability and interest for approximately
one-third of the places in each entering class. Given the
size of the College, giving that level of priority to athletic
talent and interest in our admission process is not feasible.

The challenge facing the College is to build an intercollegiate program that offers all of our student-athletes the
satisfaction and quality of experience they deserve, while
at the same time, reserving adequate places in a class of 375
students for all of the other talents, interests, and experiences that we also seek in admitting each class.
The ARC recommended to the president and the president to the Board of Managers that the appropriate proportion of places reserved for recruited athletes in each
class be a range of 10 percent to 15 percent. This allocation of spaces reflects the high value placed on the presence of our student-athletes in the community. Greater
commitment in admissions spaces would begin to change
the character of the College and of its educational mission. In order to meet the goal of 10 percent to 15 percent
and to provide our intercollegiate sports program with
the number of reserved admissions spaces required for
the committee further recommended
competitiveness
that the size of the athletic program be reduced by discontinuing football, wrestling, and badminton as intercollegiate sports. Finally, the committee proposed that
full-time coaching be available to each of the 21 continuing intercollegiate sports, as well as additional assistance

sports.
We believe the decision reaffirms both the College's
educational mission and the broad role of intercollegiate
athletics within that mission. We look forward to working with the community to build understanding of the

decision.

To the community:
As the debate over the Athletic Review Committee's and

The Phoenix felt that it was exceedingly important that some
written report or statement emerge from both the
committee and the board. Until the facts are put out in the

Cathy Abbott 72
Member, Athletic Review Committee

Member, Board of Managers

I appreciate this opportunity to share with Swarthmore
students and the larger community why the Athletic Review Committeecame to our recommendations on strengthening the intercollegiate athletic program at Swarthmore
College. First, perhaps, I should introduce myself. I was cocaptain of the volleyball team at Swarthmore College. My
husband, Ernie, also Class of '72, played varsity soccer and
lacrosse. Both of my two sons started playing soccer at age
four, and my husband typically referees two soccer games a
weekend. Every day, in business, I work with colleagues
for whom competitive sports were a formative experience
in their high school and college years and who are enthusiastic sports fans today. I tried to bring all of this experience
to the Committee's deliberations.
The Committee really began with a vision of Swarthmore
College as a SMALL liberal arts college striving for and

achieving excellence: excellence not just in its academic
program, but also excellence in the experiences outside the
classroom that Swarthmore offers its students. Our goal is
to build a successful intercollegiate sports program at
Swarthmore, consistent with our overall mission of excellence in liberal arts education.
Over the last year, the Committee met and gathered a
great deal of information about the state of the intercollegiate athletic program. We had extensive conversations with

coaches and the four student liaisons to the Committee, and;
we reviewed data on the won/loss record for our intercollegiate teams. After much dialogue within the Committee, we
reached consensus that Swarthmore's intercollegiate program was not measuring up to a standard of excellence in
the experience it offered participants.
We also gathered information about changes in the comthe increasing specialization of athpetitive landscape
letes in middle school and high school, leading to a higher
level of play at the college level
but also fewer multiplesport athletes. Further, for some teams, such as football,
there has been a significant increase in the size of squad
needed to play in Division 111(now 65-70 athletes are needed,
and that number continues to grow).
These facts highlighted the basic problem: the College
was now playing 24 intercollegiate sports yet each year

we needed more athletes to field teams, because there were

fewer multiple-sport athletes and because team sizes were
growing (such as football). As a result, many of the 24 teams

were struggling and both coaches and student athletes were
dissatisfied.
The Committee then explored how Swarthmore could
strengthen its intercollegiate program. We concluded that
the scarcest resource at Swarthmore is the size of the entering class (approx. 375). We asked each coach, on several occasions, how many talented student athletes do you need to
be competitive in your sport? We discovered, for example,
that the football coach believed he needed 20 athletes each
year, fully 10 percent of the entering male class, to play football competitively.
The College had experimented in recent years with trying to give special weight to certain teams in terms of college recruiting, and found that this weight was, indeed, successful in improving both the won/loss record of the teams,
and in improving the experience of the athletes. However,
we also found, that if we supported EACH of the 24 teams to
the level that the coaches believed was necessary, we would
be giving undue weight to athletic ability, as opposed to other
qualities, in the admissions process.
Finally, we attempted to arrive at a consensus about what
share of the entering class should be given "special weight"
for athletic ability. This was perhaps our most difficult decision, because there is no accepted formula that says how
much weight should the College give, in admissions, to athletic skill. Swarthmore is blessed with such an outstanding
pool of applicants yet we want to bring a diversity of skills,

format and by no means represents the views

it is difficult for anyone in the community to make real
progress in this debate.
To that end, The Phoenix offered unlimited space to
make a written statement to President Al Bloom and Provost
Jennie Keith, the chair of the ARC, as well as space to
anyone from the board or the committee they would like to

changes in

and backgrounds, and interests to the College. In the end,
the Committee was convinced, with but one dissent, that
giving a range of 10 percent to 15 percent of the entering

demic chauvinism and intellectual conceit. It is about students who seek an educational experience that will prepare
them for fulfilling careers and, as responsible citizens, for
contributing to the creation of a better world.
A quality athletic program that invites broad participation is essential to Swarthmore's educational purpose. Apart

class "special weight" for athletic ability would provide a
strong commitment to athletics, but allow continued excellence in other areas of College life.
With thatrecommendation, we then turned to whatkind
of a program could we support if we gave "special weight"
for athletic skill to 10 percent to 15 percent of the entering
class? We examined a wide variety ofalternatives over several meetings. In the end, we recommended thatthe College
reduce the number of sports offered from 24 to 21
eliminating football and wrestling, and dropping badminton to a
club sport.
The recommendation to drop football generated a great
deal of dialogue throughout our review (the rationales for
the other teams differ and can be elaborated elsewhere).
Fundamentally, football's growing specialization (offense,
defense, special teams, etc.) makes it difficult for a small
college to field a competitive team. The desired roster size
is the highest of any sport (65 to 70)
twice the size of the
next largest sport. Thus, football is a particularly high user
of our "scarce" resource, which is the small size of the entering class. We did look at whether we could support football within the 10 percent to 15 percent constraint for admissions preference to intercollegiate athletics, but concluded that we would have to sacrifice several other men's
team sports if we continued football. For a majority of the
Committee, that seemed to be too high a price to pay.
Finally, having come to a majority view, we wrestled with
the question of whether and how to provide for input from
the current students and from alumni. While each group
was represented on the Committee, we wondered whether
more input would be helpful. From a process standpoint,
we would have preferred getting broader based input. However, Admissions told us that all sports were currently suffering in recruiting, since nobody knew whether any individual sport would continue after the review. In addition,
the students reported that current student athletes were feeling very uncomfortable due to the uncertainty about the
future of their sport and needed a timely decision. Finally,
we were concerned about how student athletes would feel if
we recruited them to play a sport, knowing that by February or May, we might make a decision to discontinue that
sport. There appeared to be no good time to make this decision. Faced with two difficult paths, we recommended a

faster, rather than a slower decision.
Looking to the future, the Committee made a number of
additionalrecommendations in terms of strengthening the
remaining 21 sports
full time coaches, assistance in recruiting, addressing inadequate facilities. However, one of
the most important agenda items is addressing the culture
at Swarthmore surrounding intercollegiate sports. We would
like to engage the student body in understanding how to
better support our student athletes on campus, and how to
make the intercollegiate experience better. How can students
help? First, I believe we need to have empathy for the difficult choices that now confront the student athletes playing
discontinued sports. We need to support them in their decisions. And we need to move on and strengthen the remaining sports, so that sacrifice will not have been in vain.

Swarthmore has been an important part of my life because of its unique and widely respected educational program and significant social impact. It has established a community environment designed to foster the aptitudes, ambitions and leadership qualities of intelligent achievementoriented students. Its high standards ofacademic ability and
performance are a proud and essential characteristic. But
Swarthmore is not about an ivory tower for breeding aca-

from health and recreational balance, organized athletics

inculcate values of teamwork, leadership, training for
achievement and stretching to win. To that end, Swarthmore
needs a better athletic program with essential support facilities that students male and female can enjoy, with
the satisfactions of successful intercollegiate competition.
However, we must not sloganeer ourselves into thinking that
"football" does or can broadly represent the need for "ath-

letics." Whatever the merits and attractions of football, it is
just one sport. Unfortunately, an adequate football program

demands resources of student athletes and support facilities that go beyond what Swarthmore, as a quality coed liberal arts college of 1375 students, can provide unless we
continue to tolerate second-class status for sports other than
football on Swarthmore's agenda.
I think it is essential that we trade football for the values
of that agenda. The administration has given us its unequivocal assurance of its commitment and readiness to
build a quality athletic program and, also, to do what it can

to alleviate the problems of coaches and players caused by
the "trade." Thus, I absolutely support the Board's decision
that football be discontinued. In saying that, I also deplore
the action of the few who
despite the almost unanimous
recommendation of Jennie Keith's multi-constituency committee and of the manifest disposition of most board members to accept it have refused to respect the Board's proud
tradition of acting by consensus. In the past, there have been
irreconcilable disagreements that Board members
including me have had over issues of major substance and emotional content ("divestment" and the "Blue Route" occur to
me). I also recall in each case that, in the Quaker tradition,
the few recalcitrants "stood aside," to let consensus express
the will of the majority.
With hindsight, there are always good reasons to criticize a process that results in an unwelcome decision. That
is certainly true now. However, I am satisfied that the administration made a truly sincere effort to provide for a
comprehensive research, extended consideration and reconsideration of all aspects of football at Swarthmore and related issues. I am also satisfied that the Keith committee
made its final recommendation to the Board only after exhaustive study and concluding that there is no true solution that could satisfy all concerns. And I AM sorry to see
football go, and regret the pain of those to whom the sport is
particularly meaningful.

Co-President
Michael DeFillipo 'O4
My fellow students,

I am MichaelC. DeFillipo, I have decided to take the charge
and declare myself to run for the position of co-president. I
am deeply concerned about the misrepresentation that has
occured the student government and the administration. I
believe that I have several good ideas in which we can represent every member of the Swarthmore student body.
My first plan is to improve student groups by addressing
the lack of student monies for groups and student life. Secondly, I want to address the lack of student space on campus;
particularily, the ineffiecent use of Wharton basement.
Thirdly, I believe academics must be revaluated for the opportunity for students to achieve the the full potential of a
Swarthmore education. I will do this by addressing the question of an academic minor for non-honors majors as well as
reviewing the policy of the registrar, particularly in reference to transcripts and the pass/fail option. Finally, I truly
believe that the diversity of the campus MUST be upheld by
addressing the question ofour changing athleticand academic
programs and its effect on the communitiy.
I truly believe that my experience from high school and
my involvement in Swarthmore will prove to be valuable aspects in accomplishing my responsibilites to the student body.
You've got questions and I want answers.
Sincerely,

Michael C. DeFillipo

Brandon Silverman 'O2
Hi...1 am Brandon Silverman 'O2 and I'm running for the
first ever Co-President of Student Council. I am a former CoChair of Student Council, so I am completely familiar with
the role of leadership on the council, and I have been a Student Council representative for the last three semesters, which
means I know the process of change inside and out. The following are just some of the issues in the forefront ofmy mind:
First and for most, setting into motion a process that
will permanently address the inability for the student body
at-large to actively engage in major campus and Board decisions, specifically ones that will effect the current student
body. The administration will no doubt desire to resolve
this issue as well, and the sooner its not only addressed, but
resolved, the better. The BOM/ARC process blew, and it
needs to be fixed permanently. This is probably the most
important issue that has been or will be addressed for a
long time.
Looking at the next step in the ARC decision, namely
the revitalization of the remaining programs, and reexamining the effectsofthe slotting system on the culture of the campus and the success ofathletic programs. With more competitive programs, there are going to be less opportunities for
walk-ons which could have an effect on the im program.
Continuing themes such as student space (CAPS is still

possible in my opinion), keeping Tarble open later at night,
fixing movie projectors for good, hand dryers in dorms, etc.
—Eliminating the interest gap between the StudentCouncil and the rest of the student body.
In general, I think directing the Council in a manner that
includes solving day-to-day issues of campus life and continuing to push larger, more significant issues that have been
aroundfor years is the my ultimate goal. Idealism and practicality. Only with a deliberateeffort on the part ofthe Council's
leadership will it be possible to maintain the balanced lifeforce of the new revitalized Council from year to year. As a
Council, we should and willbe accountablefor maintaining a
watchful eye on the campus at-large, and this does not require catering to the adminstration or Board; Student Council should and will be accountable to the student body on all
issues that affect the quality of their experience at

Swarthmore.

Dave Thomas 'O2

People often ask me why I came to Swarthmore, usually
with a question like, "Didn't you know how liberal it is here?"
Sometimes I answer with a joke or a wisecrack, but I hope
my honest answer will convince you that I deserve your vote.
There is something unique about Swarthmore, about its
institutions and its culture. More than any other school,
Swarthmore cares deeply aboutits students. Professors, deans,
and even the President seem to honestly care about our well
being, both individually and as a group. That is so different
from the other places that I looked that it stands out. At most

schools, a Board of Visitors together with the President simply
make decisions about the future of the school, usually without
consulting the student body. In their defense, at least they are
honest about it. They don't ask for your opinion, but they don't
pretend to take it into account, and at least that is consistent.
Here at Swarthmore, we had always been taken into account,
and that is why the recent actions of the BOM and administration come as something of a shock.
To not be solicited on a decision of this magnitude should
serve as a wake-up call that we can be taken for granted. Not that
we always will, but that we must be vigilant to ensure that the
school will act with our desires in mind, and not just "for our
own good". The easiest way to do that is through an activist Student Council. SC may take a lotof flak, but the truth is that it is
capable of so much, and the current group has done quite a good
job. What SC needs is to be slightly more active and politically
realistic.
I know that a lot of you disagree with me on just about every
issue underthe sun, or at least think you do based on what you
assume my positions to be. But I can promise you that you will
never be disappointed with the amount of effort I will put into
this job, nor withthe skills I bring. With my experience and background, I can do the best job of fighting to make sure students
will always be included, and I can get results.

Campus life

representative

Adrienne Fowler 'O3

My reasons for running for campus life representative are
quite simple. I want to make life on campus as pleasant as possible for everyone here. Here are a few ways in which I plan on
accomplishing that:
As the current situation with football, badminton, and wrestling indicates, the relationship between students and the administration is both quite fragile and in need of improvement.
As a student representative to the Deans' Advisory Council and
other committees, I would take an active role in allowing the
studentbody to know exactly decisions are being considered and
to have their voices heard.

There is a shortage ofspace available for students'needs. The
space referendumearlier this semester highlighted various plans
to help make this campus a better place, if only there were room.
I would like to examine the ways in which space can be used to
make good ideas, such as those presented in the referendum, a
reality.

Concerns of thestaff are one aspect oflife on this campus that
is frequently ignored. I hope to work closely with the staff, the
administration, and students on campus who have already dedicated much time to this issue in order to improve the quality of
life for these people who make life on campus for the student

body possible.

These are only a few ideas that, hopefully, show you what
kind of issues in which I'm interested. I'm open to suggestion
and wouldbe more than happy to express any concerns you might
have to student council or the administration. So please vote for
me, Adrienne Fowler, for campus life representative.

Sanggee Kim 'O4
To members of the student body:
As I came into Swarthmore, I was told that this was the school,
though small, had the number of resources and opportunities
that can be found in an university. In a number of ways, that
little bubble of mine has been shattered. However, I want to be
instrumental in bringing about change to Swarthmore and a
voice that will campaign to make campus life a more pleasurable and enjoyable experience for all. The student body has a
right to know about decisions that will affect their campus and
the facihties on campus. As plans for co-ed housing and new
dorm are underway, I want to make sure that students are informed about every process and decision. Also, there needs to
be greater communicationbetween the administration and the
studentbody. Students shouldknow the position of the administration on campus issues and the administration needs to take
intoconsideration the needsof the students on campus. As campus life representative, I want to also stimulate a number of pro-

where a student may call Public Safety for help. Every student should have the confidence to walk anywhere on this
campus withoutfear.
2. The installation of lockers in Parrish 2nd or Tarble for
students who live in Mary Lyons. Students shouldbe able to
study freely anywhere without having to carry all their books
around all day.
3. Extended hours for computing centers on campus so
that students can freely use these areas without feelingpressured.

4. Freedom to eat whenever a person wants, especially during the off hours ofSharpies when there is a limited selection
of food. Also, Tarble should have extended hours.
5. A general student center with a main lounge where students can converge, discuss ideas, and have a knowledge of

what's available on campus.
I want to hear your ideas too. I will work extensively to
present them to other members of the council and administration. I want to make myself available to anyone at anytime. I hope that you will share the ideas I have and elect me
as campus life representative. Thank you.

Will Oilman'o2
My name is Will Ortman and I'm running for CampusLife
Representative. Since being elected to student council a year
ago as the Facilities and Space Coordinator, I have worked
hard to make sure that student concerns are always taken
seriously. With your support, I would like to continue thework
I've started. I believe that I bring the sort of leadership and
experience that can help student council continue to be the
increasing force it is for the student body.
A few of the things I've done 1) This semester I helped
convince the dining services leadership to try other options
and not eliminate our meal equivalencies at Tarble. 2) I have
taken the initiative in setting up meetings between students
and town leaders to try to make the Ville a better place for
students. We are making progress in February we will be
meeting with the Business District Authority to start setting
up specific ideas, please let me or another council member
know what you will like to see in the Ville. 3) I helped rewrite
theConstitution and so have an in-depth understanding of it.
4) I began working on increasing student summer storage,
and would like to continue working on this important issue.
I think that these experiences and others have given me the
kind ofknowledge about this college and how it works to continue to be a very effective member of student council.
I will bring to student council not only know-how and experience, but also a great deal of energy and new ideas. It is
very important to come away from this whole athletics mess
we are now in knowing that the administration will never
again make important decisions in secret. The way that the
decision was made was atrocious, it must never be allowed to
happen again. Another of my central goals will be to seek out
additionalstudent spaces and to fight for students to get more
of the space that already exists. The gameroom referendum
happened because a member of student council fought for it,
-

-

we can and will do more of this. There are so many other
issues that are important to me, such as finding an activist
space now (hopefully Wharton basement), parking, fixing up
spaces like Olde Club, and storage. I will bring my experience and commitment to every one of these ideas.

Lauren Tobias 'O2
I think most of us will agree that the Student Budget Committee (SBC) has not exactly seen the peak of its popularity
this semester. However, I am on that committee and I can
honestly say that it has been among the most satisfying activities I have engaged in at Swarthmore. I have enjoyed the
challenge of distributing our limited funds in ways that are
maximally fair, and bringing the most possible benefit to the
campus community. The experience has shown me how much
pleasure I get from playing an active role in campus decisions. I have chosen to run for Student Council because I am
interested in expanding the scope of the issues with which I
am involved. While my actions on the SBC impact particular
slices of the student body those involved with student groups
a position as Campus Life Representative on Student Council
brings with it a responsibility to address more varied issues
related to all aspects of campus life. I think I would thrive
upon this opportunity.
As Campus Life Representative, I would be responsible
for communicating the concerns of the student body to Student Council and, in turn, acting upon those concerns. Many
of the recent concerns that have arisen on campus have

stemmed from breakdowns in communication between the
students and the administration of the college. I would act to
bridge this gap by providing more opportunities for student
input and by communicationwith the Deans Advisory Council.

There are several issues I am interested in addressing as
Campus Life Representative. First, I would like to look into
the purchase of more public computers. Even if it means paying extra student wages, some of these computers should be
accessible 24 hours/day. Other topics that deserve exploration include the improvement of safety on campus, re-consideration ofthe bandwidth issue, and placement ofrestrictions
on the reserved students email system.
My qualifications for this position include extensive leadership experience and group participation on campus: as a
CoordinatorandTreasurer of thePhotography Club, Founder
of the Premedical Society, member of Mixed Company, and
one of the folks who helped get the new Sharpies HI Student
Art Gallery up and running last year.
I am excited about this newly created position, and hope
you'll share my confidence that fresh opinions, ideas, and
voices will help next semesters StudentCouncil to better serve
the Swarthmore student body.

Campus relations

representative
David Berger 'O4
Recent events surrounding Swarthmore athletics have
shown us the importance ofkeeping the student body informed
about issues that may directly affect them. I believe that
Swarthmore students need to be well informed of the decisions and operating procedures of the Student Council, and
this will be my primary goal if I am elected to be Campus

Relations Representative.
I will keep students informed about Student Council related events and processes by a variety of mediums, including e-mail announcements, posting signs around campus, and
periodic summaries to be printed in the Phoenix. I will make
sure that all Student Council processes are transparent to the
student body, as I believe that a student body informedabout
the workings of the Student Council facilitates campus-wide
discussion and decision-making on the issues important to
students. What ifthe SC approves some procedure or law that
is just as controversial as the current sports crisis? Do you
feel that you understand the current SC processes? Let me be
the person who will keep you up to date on the actions of the

safety to the student's location.
A unifying space for activist groups on campus.
The formation of a Dean's Advisory Committee on Mental
Health. The committee will study the how the administration,
faculty, staff, and students handle the problem ofmental health,
making recommendations to student council and the administration by the end of this year. Since Worth has only one psychiatrist who comes in once a weekfor just 2 hours, I will push
for student access to another psychiatrist either on or off campus during the spring semester. Students in crisis situations
should never hear that they have to wait 3 weeks for an appointment. People in their late teens and early 20s are most vulnerable to mental health problems. Mental health concerns at Swat
must be handled more effectively.
Finally, I strongly support the campaign for living wage for
all Swarthmore staff members. I also support the retention of a
football team at Swarthmore; the disturbing lack of transparency and dialogue in this decision reflects the antithesis of
"Swarthmore values." As your Campus Relations Representative, I will work to implement solutions that help you in your
daily life at Swarthmore, like the ones above. I would love it if
you'd contact me with your questions and ideas.

Doug Kneeland 'O2
My name is Doug Kneeland, and I am running for Campus Relations Representative. Although I have little background in student government, I have been largely responsible for the recent petition and student vote on the

referndum that the BOM be reconvened.
I think that, whatever anyone's opinion might be of the
aims of these endeavors, s/he must admit that they were
efficiently run and as well-publicized as they could havebeen
on such short notice. I promise I will bring equal energy to
the job of Campus Relations Representative. If elected, I plan
to change and expand the methods of publicizing student
council events, particularly those pertaining to SAC. The
current method, which seems to be confined to sending out
a reserved students email, is just ineffective. Most people,
upon reading the "reserved student" address, don't even
bother to read the subject of the email or to read the author
of the email (thus not knowing that it is a student council
announcement), but simply trash it. If any further attempt
at publicity is made, it usually involves small fliers scattered around Parrish and Sharpies.
These fliers get lost in the morass of other fliers publicizing other events, and most people don't even bother reading them, either, any more. My plan would be to have a
special email head used only to disseminate student council news. Furthermore, I would also create a specific web
page, used only for student council announcements. While

SC.

I have a lot of experience for this position: I served on
Student Council for two years in high school and, during my
senior year, I served as president ofthe Student Council. My
main duty as Student Council President was to be the connection between the students and Student Council. I would
be fulfilling the same role as your Campus Relations Representative.For those of you who do not yet know me, I hope to

I want to get to know you and to help you become more informed about SC.

Dear Friends:
As Campus Relations Representative, the person directly
responsible for communicating student council actions to the
student body, I will make the student council as transparent
and accessible as possible. How? Simple. During each meeting, I will compile a list that states how each member voted
on each issue. I will submit this list to the Daily Gazette and
The Phoenix. I will also post these results on the SC bulletin
board as well as on the Council's website. You need to know

whatdecisions are being made and who's making them, both
to change things now and for future election reference.
Asidefrom doing my job by ensuring the transparency of
council, there are four concrete policy recommendations I
will fight for continuously. They are as follows:
At least 2 top-loading copy machines in the library, as the
department offices already have. (That means about 3 minutes to copy an entire binder!)
Safety boxes throughout campus; particularly near the tunnel, on the path from C-Lot past the fieldhouse, and near
DuPont. As on nearly all campuses, theseboxes allow the user
to press a button in an emergency situation, alerting public

Dear Swarthmore Students,
I am running for Campus Relations Representative, one of
the new Student Council positions that was created when we
ratified the new constitution a few weeks ago. The CRR is responsible for maintaining effective communicationbetween SC
and therest of the Swarthmore community, especially students.
In many ways, the first person to occupy a new position defines
its image and its scope, so I feel that I owe you and future students my pledge to be a committed member of SC if you elect

THE PHOENIX

I do not bring an issues-agenda to this election, so that I may
be most responsive to critical broader themes that currently need
to be addressed on campus. First, your participation in a Student Council election gives you the right to know what SC is
doing for you, when they are doing it, and how you can contribute. And you should never be confused as to who your SC representatives are, which is part of the reason why I've begun to
plaster my face all over campus. But second, and most importantly, Student Councilhas an obligation to provide students with
direct lines ofcommunication with the faculty, staffand administrators who share this campus. I will work to make this happen.
Finally, because of the critical situation we are now in, I feel
it would be irresponsible not to address briefly the recent cuts to
our athletic program. While I disagree with the Board of Managers' decision, I believe that a far more destructive consequence
has been the grievously poor communication between the Athletic Review Committee and the student body. The CRR has a
role to play in strengthening that communication immediately
and in the future, and I would be honored to serve in that capac-

ity.

Appointments chair
Chris Moreno 'O3
No platform submitted.

Liane Rice 'O3
If my opponent loses this election, he'll still be on Student
Council as Curriculum Committee Rep. He and I do very different things on campus and we both have a lot to offer. I
think Chris Morello has done a good job on SC, especially
recently. Keep in mind that a vote for me is not a vote against
Chris (who will be on SC regardless!), but a vote for a more
representative SC.
Right now, SC isn't diverse enough, extracurricularly, politically, or demographically. At last week's meeting, SC expressed the concern that they couldn't speak for the student
body to denounce the recent actions of the Board of Managers. Of course they couldn't! As it stands, SC members represent a very narrow group in this community. For example,
they don'trepresent the artistic sideofSwarthmore well.Let's

change that.
The Appointments Chair position is key to making sure
that a broad range of people are represented. It's a position
I'm particularly qualified for. An effective Appointments
Chair needs to be very organized,knowledgeable, level headed,
articulate, and wellrounded. I make a great committee leader,
too.
But the Appointments Chair must also be ready and able
to take initiative on other Swarthmore concerns. I want to
help put the maphouse up for referendum, get hot food & coffee vending machines in Tarble or Kohlberg (no overnight
staff necessary), and work towards making Student Council
a more representative group that has the confidence of the
student body and the respect of the administration.

Here's what else I do: Editor & Treasurer ofSmall Craft
Co-President of the Feminist Majority, Goalie at
Motherpuckers, Woodwind Ensemble, drama, WA, PA, CA.
(but not RA) Questions? Feel free to e-mail: lricel
So when you vote, remember that a vote for Liane Rice
makes sure that people like both myself and Chris Morello
get the representation they need.

Secretary
Brian Byrnes 7 02
My name is Brian Byrnes and I am junior running for
Student Council Secretary. I believe that the two main qualities that someone with the number of responsibilities that
the secretary must have to succeed are dedication and discipline. I feel that in my three years here at Swarthmore I have
demonstrated these abilities to the student body, through my
overall involvement in student life. As an attendee of the
spring meeting of the Student Budget Committee, the Secretary must also be someone who is in touch with the needs
and desires of the student body. This is a quality that I am
quite sure I possess. Through the great connections I have
made with countless students in my time here, especially in
my post as a Resident Assistant, I have learned exactly what
the priorities of the student body are. I am certain that, if
elected, I would work fairly and tirelessly in an attempt to
meet the expectations ofeach and every Swarthmore student.

Robert Cox'o3
Hey Swatties,
This is Rob Cox, and I am running for student council secretary. Just as the student council's role as a whole is to connect you, the student body, and the administration (not to
mention the elusive BOM), I too will not stop short this goal.
However, rather than abuse the student council's reservedstudent email privileges, I will table at Tarble and talk extensively to students around campus. I know that facilitating
communication is Student Council's most important role; in
order for student sentiment to impact the decision process
you need SC leaders who will actively solicit your opinions

and bring them to the administration's attention.
As secretary I will do my best to further broaden student
council's linking role. Where many critics ofthe Student Council suggest we are a fifth wheel among administrative bodies,
the SC constitution referenda coupled with the success of the
student council fireside discussion in bringing students together with President Bloom in a civilized manner show that
See PLATFORMS, pg. 31

PLATFORMS
k

iMW:Wium:ifiWij:wn«ttim:{:

From PLATFORMS, pg. 30
we are in fact fulfilling the best of expectations.
I know this will be a tight election there are four of us
running for secretary alone. I realize that the other candidates are also hard working and well qualified, but thefact is
that I have been more closely involved with student council
and will be able to begin fulfilling my duties as secretary immediately. I have taken the SC minutes before, and so I know
that unlike the other candidates, I not only possess the qualities of a good secretary, but I have already performed the duties. Not to close by sounding like a completely stereotypical
Swattie dork, but I take good notes and I know that I am best
suited for the job.
**Re-elect Rob Cox for Student Council Secretary**

Kristina Pao 'O4
Hey Swat! My name is Kristina Pao and I would love to be
your student council secretary. Having survived my first semester here at Swarthmore, I feel that it's my duty as a student to serve my school. I have experience in the office of
secretary and as an active memberof the student government.
I'm hard working, organized, and I put 100% in everything I
do. And, I sincerely want to commit my time in serving the

student body ofSwarthmore. Keeping accurate minutes and
notifying students of upcoming events would be tasks of the
secretary. I would also be completely open to all suggestions
by any member ofthe Swarthmore community, student body,
or faculty. I would do my best to accomplish what is requested
and make sure that Swarthmore is the best it can be. One
main issue that has recently concerned me is the lack communication between the administration and the students of
Swarthmore. I feel that students of any organization have the
right to know what decisions are being proposed and that
they should have a say in what is passed. Likewise, I feel the
administration should be informed ofthe feelings of their students andall views, both those of the administration and student body, should be taken into consideration. I believe that
one of the main duties of secretary is to make sure that student voices are heard and represented.
On another note, I feel that relying on train/bus schedules
makes it difficultto schedule interviews for jobs or graduate
schools. I believe that there shouldbe a lottery, giving priority to seniors, for extra parking spaces open to the all students. Student Council shouldalso offer a committee that di-

rectly deals with suggestions made by Swarthmore students.
Students may have interesting ways to improve the school
and not have time or confidence to speak up about such suggestions. This committee would take into consideration all
suggestions and act upon them. My goal would be to make
Student Council more responsive to the needs of the student
body. By encouraging students to voice their opinions, I would
do my best to fulfill the desires of the student body to change
and amend school policies.

Poulami Roychowdhury 'O3
Hi guys, I'll try to be concise. So why elect me for the position of secretary/treasurer? For those of you who don'tknow
me, I'm a sophomore. I'm secretary ofFeminist Majority, a
member of the WRC board, and student representative for
the Women's Concerns Committee. I'm running for one big
reason: the current student council is not representative of

the student body. Eleven men and one woman, six of whom
are officially republicans, represent a student body that is
more than 50% female, and largely democratically affiliated.
As you can see, there is a great need for increased diversity
on the SC to accurately reflect the diversity of the campus.
What do I plan to do if elected? I have three agendas: increase campus security, change the meal plan, and make the
CollegeBoard more transparent. Have you ever called public
safety at 2am and not gotten an answer? Have you ever seen
anybody on GarnetPatrol, ever? Getting mugged at gun-point,
or getting gropedby a bearded stranger is craziness. I want to
do two things about this: get swipe cards so we can all get into
the nearest dorm if we feel threatened, and have blue-light
phones installed all over campus.
My second agenda includes improving the meal plan. A
lot ofus are dissatisfiedwith the measly two choices we have;
we should have more flexibility. I personally want a point
system so I can consume the entire contents of Kohlberg Coffee Bar, but I'm open to suggestions!
Lastly, board decisions to cut athletics this year were carried out in an unacceptable manner. Without students
Swarthmore would not exist, so we should have input into
decisions that affect us. If elected I plan to make the Board's
activities well publicized, and to allow students to have a say
before decisions are thrown at us.
Thanks a lot for reading till the end.

About me: I'm a sophomore and I'm currently a co-leader of
Empty the Shelters (Fill the Homes) and a Women's Resource
Center board member. I want to make Swarthmore a fun, happy
place.
What I want to accomplish as a member of Student Council:
1) SAC-funded parties: more parties, more variety All
those SAC-funded DJ dance parties are nice, but we should have
more party options. Every weekend, there should be at least one
event that involves something besides dancing-a poetry slam,
student band performances, outside band performances, etc. Although such events already exist to some extent, they don't happen all that often, and they're often seen as pre-party events. I'm
proposing that we beef them up-make them longer, make more
of them SAC-funded, encourage them much more-so that they
can exist as alternatives to the dance parties.
Also, we just need more SAC-funded parties in general. If
there aren't any SAC-funded parties scheduled for a given weekend, SAC shouldthrow one. We need to heavily encourage groups
and individuals to throw SAC-funded parties.
2) Food after midnight and Activist space SCCS won the
game room referendum, which is good-we needed more public
computers. But we shouldn't have had to choose between food,
computers, and space for student political groups. All three are
important, and we still need food after midnight and space for
political group meetings and storage. Ifelected to Student Council, I will do everything in my power to make SWaWa (or extendedTarble hours) a reality. As a member of the Swarthmore
activist community, I'm equally committed to establishing space
for student political groups.
3) Extended library hours

4) More student space
5) Extended Music building hours and more pianos in
dorms Lang needs to stay open later than midnight. Also, every
dorm should have at least one piano.
6) General Accessibility: tell me what you want The whole
point of electing people to Student Council is that they represent
you. Ifyou elect me, all you have to do is tell me what you want,
and I'll do my best to make it happen.

I'm on a mission: I want to make Swarthmore a more exciting place. I want to makeSwarthmore a fun place. I want to make
Swarthmore a place where people say, "I want to party here on
weekends, weekdays, and holidays." If you would be so gracious
as to honor me with your vote for Student Events Advisor in
these elections, I will seek specific steps to ensure that
Swarthmore is a fun place for the next year. First off, I will closely
monitor whether any drop-off in party activity occurs with the
Administration's sudden dismemberment of the football team,
and I will fight for every student's right to have a good time.
Next, I will seek to encourage major events that offer a broad
scope ofbacchanalian activities. While the weekly Paces parties
are fun, our party needs are greater than this. I promise to seek
more creative parties, more activities like pub night, and more
chill times. Back in '95 we had Dave Mathiews at Swarthmore.
Since then, we've had jackshit. Should I be elected, I promise I
will not rest until I have found a big name entertainer so that
you'll want to drag your lazy ass across campus. I don't give a
damned whether it's Dave Mathiews, Dido, Dr. Dre or Don Henley
as fun-loving Swarthmore students we deserve no less than
-

bacchanalia.
My role as your Student Events Advisor does not stop there.
As your student council representative, I willfight for just causes.
I will fight so that there are more female chairs of departments
so women feel more comfortable here. I will fight for more student parking. I will fight for more free-swim hours. I will fight
for better coordination among the different minority groups on
campus. I will fight for a more open, democratic Swarthmore. I
will fight for clearer admissions policies. I will use my perch on
student council to ensure that the body uses its symbolic power
of the student body towards moral ends that means no more
sweatshirts made with sweatshop labor. I understand the many
responsibilities of the office, and with my Swarthmore experience I have real ideas for how to improve the school. I won't be a
student council member along for the ride I want to change
Swarthmore, and if you share my vision, please honor me with
your vote. Thanks for your time.

My name isAnna Morgan and I am running for the position of Student Events Advisor on Student Council. I feel
this position would best suit my experience and interests. I
was a member of my high school Student Council for three
years, serving as Class Treasurer last year. I feel qualified to
be the Student Events Advisor because I was actively involved
in planning large-scale events in my high school. If elected, I
would beable to make more of Swarthmore's vast resources
available to the student body. As a memberofADVICE, a committee made up of representatives from many of the diversity-related groups on campus, I have become aware of the
issues that face different groups of Swarthmore students. I
believe I would be accessible to many different sectors of the
diverse student population and I hope to encourage participation by as many of thestudents as possible. I am very motivated to actively participate in both Student Council and SAC,
and because of my work at ADVICE I feel I could encourage
more open communicationbetween various student groups
and Student Council. Most importantly, I would like to be an
active member of the college community that I have chosen
to be a part of. As a Quaker, I feel I could help to increase

understanding and use ofQuaker values in school leadership.
Please seriously consider my candidacy for Student Events
Advisor. Thank you.

Student

Marvin Barron 'O2
A lot of work needs to be done about charters for groups
and the lack of institutional memory that student organizations have. Ideally a group's charter should be a clear document that lets a group that has fallen apart for a semester or
two quickly rebuild around a stated purpose, structure, and
goals. Unfortunately 41 groups don't even have a charter on
record, and most of the ones on record are outdated. I think
we should help similar groups consolidate so they spend less
time maintaining separate infrastructures and can spend
more time organizing activities. This would lower groups'
turnover rate (currently about 10% per year) and help build
institutional memory. It would help address declining group
activity. At the same time, I think the chartering process
should be made clearer with clear requirements and guidelines to get and maintain a charter. Lastly I would like to come
up with more channels by which non-chartered groups can
get access to money.
I was on Council for a year as CBC rep. During that time I
worked to push a student wage raise through CBC and I

drafted the first version of our new Constitution. As Student

Budget Treasurer, I've worked to help groups through the 19%
budget cut andfind thefunds they need. These positions have
given me a strong working relationship with student groups
and college administrators and helped me become well in-

formed.
As a Council member, I would like to see SC begin to use
its relationship withthe administrationto take definite stands
on larger issues that are important to thestudentbody. I worry
that sometimes SC is too concerned with maintaining this
relationship to actually use this realtionship to take a stand.
Recent events make it obvious that student input into large
Board decisions doesn't always make it to the top, and Council should work to address this. In addition to building administrative relationships, Council should use its voice and
democratic mandate from the students to substantively contribute to the long-term growth of this college.

Sydney Beveridge 'O3
Student groups should be able to focus on activities (and
dare I say fun) rather than budget issues and chartering
qualms. As discussed at therecent SBC fireside chat, campus
groups are spending theirbudgets much more slowly than in

the past. What's going on? If elected Student Groups Advisor,
I promise toremedy this sluggish spending. You've paid your
student activities fee; I'll help you spend it more efficiently.
As a dedicated treasurer of WSRN and Earthlust, two
prominent and very different organizations, I see the spending problem as a lack of information. Being a treasurer is an
unglamorous job. I have experienced the headaches of figur-

ing out funding first hand. As treasurer for the radio station,
I handle large amounts of money allocated to diverse shortterm and long-term projects. For Earthlust, I struggle to balance a small budget and fundraising (I'm sure you've bought
an Earthlust mug or two) with eager activism. Through managing both budgets, I have become well acquainted with the

SBC office and the Treasurer's Handbook.
Planning activities and projects comes down to financial
feasibility and time. With the 19% budget cut, additionalfunding sources are necessary. Both the lead-time needed to request funds and thetime invested in procuring themare burdensome to the typical over-committed Swattie. TheSBC and
other resources want to help with funding, but in my experience groups are often uninformed or intimidated. I want to
bridge this communication gap and serve as an objective liaison between student groups and funding opportunities. I
would plan to host information sessions for student groups
early next semester and distribute information regarding
funding sources and their contact information.
Besides overseeing funding, the Student Groups Advisor
chairs the Charter Committee. Working with Earthlust and

WSRN, I understand the structure and support an organization really needs. With my experience leading successful
Earthlust meetings, I am confident in chairing such an important committee where I will be able to effectively advise
and monitor groups. In the face of recent budget cuts, stagnant groups will finally face proper scrutiny. I will carefully
weed out, combine, or revamp such fossils as was done last
year by combining Earthlust with SOS.
If elected Student Groups Advisor, I will be able to facilitate responsible spending and chartering. Under my leadership, student groups will have an accessible resource for their
organizations and

an ally in student government.

With all of this controversy swirling around the Board of
Managers' cuts to the athletic program, we need inclusiveness
more than ever. Opinion on the board's decision may be mixed,
but nearly allbelieve the decision-making process was handled
badly. A decision was made thataffects us all—and some of us
far more than others—without really consulting us.
Student Council has far less power than theBoard of Managers. But it does have a significant impact on student life, particularly via the Student Budget Committee (SBC), which, among
other things, allocates resources to the college's chartered student groups. This year's 19 percent across-the-board cut in funding for student organizations is another example of a decision
that was madewithout adequately seeking the opinions ofthose
affected. Of course SBC has to be fiscally responsible, but the
decision has negatively impacted a number of student groups.
Many are straining under the cuts. Some have cut activities.
Others havebeen forced to rely on fund-raising for extra income.
Whatever a group's purpose, each was chartered with the expectation of its members that it would not be strangled by a shrinking budget. When thedecision was announcedlast spring, it was
a slap in the face to a lot of group members, a feeling not unlike
what many are experiencing now. When tough decisions are
made, it should always be done with complete respect for and
the inclusion of those whom it impacts.
The Student Groups Advisor chairs the Charter Committee
and serves as a voting member ofthe SBC. This person must be
an advocate for student groups and must ensure that there is
active dialogue between SBC and those it serves. I think we are
all proud to attend an academic powerhouse; I certainly am. But
if we aim for this to the exclusion of all our other goals, we're
just cheating ourselves. Student groups must remain a priority
and must receive the funding necessary so that every active group
can carry out its mission.

As Student Groups Advisor I, Shawn Kyzer, will serve
the student body with my experience and diligent work
ethic. There are three principles I believe should be maintained while holding an office. The first is integrity. A
candidate must have a sense of honesty to maintain his/
her integrity. I believe one of the worst things a person
can do is make false statements and hollow commitments.
The second is dedication. As Student Groups Advisor I
will strive to achieve every goal and never deviate from
that path. The third and final point is experience. Being
an executive board member of HOLA and having participated in several other organizations in the past (National
Honor Society Secretary, President Of Model United Nations, Debate etc.), I realize the complexity of charters
and I also understand the general financial matters of
these groups. I will communicate regularly with each organization on campus to ensure the needs of every organization are met. The position of Student Groups Advisor is a serious position that requires a great deal of attention and as a driven individual I will not only carry
out the necessary duties of the position, but also voice
the opinion of the student body when necessary. By maintaining these principles through communication I will
demonstrate to the Swarthmore campus leadership and
productivity. Ultimately, I will serve the College Campus
of Swarthmore and ensure each organization is fully rep-

Photos by Claire Weiss For The Phoe

well, then the answer is obvious.
"Jesus probably had a lot of facial
hair. Because he probably didn'tbother to shave. He had
more important things to do." Whether this argument
holds (holy) water or not (and I'm not sure what the Pope
thinks), it is still another connection between the forces
of good and the forces of hair. Hairiness is next to godliness. And, um, it's easier than shaving, too.
As previously stated, women, unlike men, are less
biologically inclined to vast growths of hair on random
areas of their body. Due to hundreds of years of sexual
oppression, however, we live in a society where the regular shaving of what body hair does grow, largely on the
legs and armpits, is a social dictum for many people with
two X chromosomes. But if men shouldn't have to shave
to be productive and loved members of society, why
should the other half? Elinore Kaufman 'O4 is a nonshaver, and likes her "soft and friendly" armpit hair a
great deal. She is, in fact, one of the few people I have
met who has made a friend due to body hair. "My best
friend decided to be friends with me because I had armpit hair," she said. Further testimony, as if we needed it,
to the fact that body hair need not be a deterrent to others from seeking one's company.
To recap what we've learned so far: Body hair is good.
Body hair makes you warm; body hair makes you happy;
body hair gives you nice skin. It can be braided into cute
patterns and dyed, or it can help you attract a mate. And
if you have excess, which many of us do, it can even be
used to insulate houses or stuff pillows in a pinch. So,
with all these undeniable benefits, why on earth is hairiness even perceived as a problem?
Christian Gaal'O4, a vibrant young social theorist who
"likes and relishes" his own body hair, has an idea. "We
don't want to think of ourselves as apes," he theorized.
"Societally, there's a backlash against anything that is
animalistic that connects us to our roots."
This may well be the case, but it may also well be
dangerous. See, from a Darwinian point of view, hair is
a definite survival advantage. And if we eliminate those
genes, by breeding only with the clean-cut, hairless Ryan
Philippe-types who are all the rage these days, we could
inadvertently do damage to the potential of the species
to survive catastrophe. Sure, we think we have nature
whipped right now, but one never knows when one might
need the ability to develop a thick, luxurious coat offur.
The facts are clear: what can you do, other than let
correct evolutiontake its course? Fulfill your social duty,
and remember that you, too, are an animal. Hook up with
a hairy person today. The world will be a better place
because of it.

Would Jesus Do?"

BY JONAH GOLD

According to Carlson,

Man, though he tends to keep his furrier cousins in
cages, has oft been referred to as the "hairless ape." However, this designation is not quite correct. Some of us, in
fact, are pretty hairy. Less so than monkeys, to be sure,
but more so than some carpets, or certain breeds of dogs,
or fuzzy fruits such as the kiwi or the peach. True to our
simian heritage, body hair can emerge just about anywhere, from backs to faces to legs to armpits to less pleasant regions. Women's follicles are genetically less generous than men's, on average, but they too have the
power to create ample quantities of the one thing that
defines us as mammals. The magic of body hair, for both
genders, is a beautiful thing, soft and luxurious to the
touch.
But despite the obvious advantages of the hairy
lifestyle, body hair is inexplicably frowned on in our
society as a whole. "I don't really hang out with hairy
expressing the views
people," says Patrick Connolly
of a depressingly large number of Americans. But this
is Swarthmore. Around here, the mainstream is constantly challenged in terms of mass culture, sexuality,
music, and general lifestyle. So why not body hair?
Why not indeed, wonders Zac Steele 'O4, proud possessor of what he can only describe as a "severely hairy
back." The pelt in question, rather than being a social
stigma for Steele, is a source of great utility and enjoyment for all. "I enjoy walking around without a shirt
on," he says, "and seeing the varying degrees of discomfort I can put people in." And he uses his wondrous back
hair, as well as his ample leg, arm, and chest hair, not
only for entertainment value, but for more practical purposes, such as warmth.
He is proud. He would never even consider removing
what's naturally there, and definitely not for the benefit
of others. "You're given a body, and if people can't appreciate it for the way it is, then it's their problem," he
says. And Steele himself, in a happy relationship of the
kind many Swatties seemingly can only whine about not
having, is living proof.
Facial hair is equally beneficial, according to Mac
Carlson 'O4, whose beard has been growing for three
years, ever since a long summer spent in New Orleans
without any shaving implements. It keeps his head
from which, our moms told us, a majority of body heat
escapes —just a little bit warmer. It traps food that might
otherwise have escaped from his mouth, and catches the
skin's natural oils underneath, keeping his pores clean
and the skin under his beard clear of blemishes. And if
you resolve everyday dilemmas with the question "What

As most of you are probably aware, a good deal has changed over the past four decades. In 1959,41 years ago, the Swarthmore College class of 1963 was entering its freshman year at the college.
Now they're all settled, for the most part happily, throughout the world. Some of
them are even retired, if you can imagine that. But none of them have forgotten their
alma mater. All that time, obviously, breeds change. The class of '63 lived in a different
era,

dealt with different issues, overcame different problems, and experienced different

social norms than we do.
As we all know, however, time tends to pass just a little bit differently (think of
writing your last paper) when dealing with matters that take place on the grounds of
this college. So it seemed like a worthwhile experiment to see what, exactly, has changed
with regards to this fine liberal arts institution in the last 40-odd years.
And yes, time does pass. Plenty of things have changed. To begin with, the language:
"As far as I can recall, no one said 'Swattie'," says Judith Ramaley '63. It's fairly logical,
then, that Swarthmore wasn't "Swat" either. It was "Swarthmore," usually pronounced
with the first Y intact. No one had dubbed the lawn in front of Parrish a "beach," probably because of the obvious lack of sand or water, and Palmer, Pittinger and Roberts,
then men's dorms on a gender-divided campus, were called the "preps," rather than the
more official-sounding "PPR." Comfortingly, at least one piece of Swat-specific lingo

was the same: "the ville" was still "the ville."
Traditions were different too. There was a serenade in which the men sang songs to
the women from the windows of their dorms, a mud fight in Wharton courtyard, a student-created theatrical production called the "Hamburg show," and a whole bunch of
other things that probably made a lot more sense if you were actually there at the time.
They played a sort of Swat variation of Twister called "stretch" on Parrish's noncoastal lawn, wherein students stood in circles and tossed knives stolen from the dining
hall (then in Parrish) into the ground, then tried to all stretch their legs to touch the
knives. They slid down the hill in front of Parrish on borrowed trays. They had something called a Sadie Hawkins dance, in which girls asked boys to dance. They were,
basically, college students, and their bizarre folkloric activities and regular events were
no more or less silly than our own.
The student culture as a whole, on a broader level, does seem to have been more
extreme though, and certainly fit in even less well with the suburban Philadelphia backdrop than it does today. "There was a funny town-gown dichotomy," recalls Barbara
Seymour '63. "People in the ville really thought that these grungy, long-haired students
were not their kind."
These grungy, long-haired pre-hippie types were a defining feature in the culture of
Swarthmore in those days. And they had a name, too. They were called "bodoes," which
was somehow short for "bohemians." A piece of administration dirt, courtesy ofDiana
Judd Stevens '63: "Dean Gross was a bodo." Pass it on.
The stereotypical bodo carried a huge green canvas bookbag (most students just carried books in their hands) and lived in Mary Lyon. "If there was going to be any oncampus partying with alcohol and drugs, it was probably down there," says Stevens of
ML, which doesn't sound like it's changed all that much, "There was sort of a mysterious
aura."

While we think of Swat as liberal now, the bodoes and their ilk in the early sixties
were further left from mainstream America's politics than was entirely safe in those
days.

We've all laughed at former vice president and upstanding American citizen Spiro
Agnew's reference to Swat as "The Kremlin on the Crum," but in the class of '63's day it
was less of a joke. The height of the college's commie days were actually a bit earlier in
the fifties, when it famously refused to buckle under to the House Un-American Activities Committee's request that communists be removedfrom its faculty and student body.
Even on the tail end of the McCarthy era, though, Seymour remembers, Swarthmore
maintained and almost lived up to its "pink" reputation. There were known communists on the faculty, Socialist presidential candidate Gus Hall spoke at one of the college's

International, and tons of other excellent activist organizations, but the
government doesn't care enough to try to shut them down, and there are still only five
people, give or take a few, in the folk song club. Though Matt Rubin might think we're a

ers, Amnesty

Swarthmore's mainstream was truly anti-establishment. And the sixties hadn't even
really started yet. In terms of radicalness, they have us topped hands-down.
This progressive student population certainly collided with another major element
of campus life present in the early sixties that we lack today: a Quaker-influenced, fairly
restrictive set of rules governing student behavior. "In loco parentis" was the term used,
meaning just what it sounds like to Latin scholars: the college tried to take the place of
the students' parents. "We didn't like it, but presumably our parents did", is the explanation Ellen Perchonock '63 gives of this strange idea.
The implementation of this "parenting" policy was appropriately sexist. It consisted,
first of all, of not allowing the girls to be out of their dorms after a certain time at night,
though boys had no such restrictions. The administration also limited contact between
genders to the dining hall, classes and rigidly monitored social events.
Members of the opposite sex, recalls Stevens, could only visit the other's dorm on
Sunday afternoons, and even thenthe "twelve-inch rule" was in effect, meaning that the
door had to be open at least a foot at all times when two members of the opposite sex
were in the same dorm room. Recall that this was a time when almost all major institutions were still single-sex, and it all seems a little less ridiculous, but only a little.
The students thought so too. Obviously, these rules were broken. Men entered the
women's dorms through the windows, and vice versa, on a fairly regular basis. The "dry
campus" statute as well was defied, by the five on-campus fraternities of the time, as
well as the aforementioned bodoes. Seymour, who says she learned to drink on this
"dry" campus, remembers the sight of gallons ofcider hanging out the windows of dorms,
fermenting for later consumption by thirsty students.
The mandatory weekly Collections, held every Thursday morning, were another place
where students' reactions to the administration's control of their lives was made clear.
People wouldarrive at these assemblies immediately after getting their mail, and would
proceed to ignore the speaker, who might have been one of any number offamous people,
from James Michener '29 to Ravi Shankar to W.H. Auden, instead very publicly choosing to bury their faces in the latest issue of Time magazine. One wouldlike to think that,
if such restrictions, or equivalent ones, were attempted again in this day and age, the
modern residents of Swarthmore would be similarly, and intelligently, defiant.
Today, we live in an era in which society, thanks to the efforts of progressives like
those who inhabited Swarthmore, has taken on a decidedly more free and equal bent
than could ever have been imagined before the sixties. And the students of today's
Swarthmore are products of this society, casually, though not complacently, accepting
the amounts offreedom the previous Swatties fought for. In general, though, the culture
of Swarthmore over these forty-odd years has not changed so much as the society around
it.

Polly Watts '63, waxing college brochure-esque in her description of what she has
seen in her return visits to Swat over the years, agrees that we're still as smart and
passionate as ever. "The students I see when I return are not very different from those I
lived with back then, except that they are more diverse in terms of ethnic background.
They still look serious and intense. They still talk constantly, in small groups and large.
I can tell that thinking, learning and questioning are still the most popular constant
activities."
And, if there were any doubt that Swatties then and Swatties now were anything
other than different phases ofevolution of the same species, Bill Steelman '63 clears it
up with an oddly timely joke from the days of the class of '63. It goes (paraphrased for
style) like this: A couple from out of town comes to Swarthmore for a football game.
They can't find the stadium. One says to the other "We can just follow the crowds and
we'll get there," so they do. At this point in the joke, Steelman pauses, in anticipation of
a punchline. "And they ended up at the library." He finishes.
How does the proverb go? The more things change... whatever. Ask the Swarthmore
class of 2037.

Orgasm isn't necessarily part of intercourse for
women. Upon examination of the sexual anatomy ofboth
sexes, it's clear that formand function are at times separate for women, while men seem to have it all in one.
And for many women, intercourse means pain, and being in the mood and in the moment doesn't always help.
Painful intercourse isn't always due to the tightness
of vaginal muscles, according to Go Ask Alice, Colum-

Saturday at 8:15 p.m. and on
Sunday at 2 p.m.
Rikhye directs Moliere's "The

being tight can be very painful, as is often experienced
during initial penetration, the mere state of vaginal
dryness can also be severely uncomfortable.
Any medication or drug that tends to dehydrate the
body will also dehydrate the vagina. Isotretinoin, the
active ingredient in Accutane, decongestants and antihistamines are all likely drying agents. Recreational use
of drugs can also put a damper on intercourse; though

Manuel Puig's play "Kiss of the

THOUGH SOME CLAIM MARIJUANA HAS
APHRODISIAC QUALITIES, IT WILL ALSO
DRY OUT VAGINAL FLUIDS.

some claim marijuana has aphrodisiac qualities, it will
also dry out vaginal fluids.
Feeling stressed can also have a negative influence
on vaginal moisture, as will experiencing abnormal
hormonal states that may accompany the use of oral
or
contraception, Depo-Provera, pregnancy
breastfeeding. A simple infection can also affect your
body's overall state of moisture, which will manifest
itself vaginally.
The Alice Web site recommends several options for
moisture supplementation. Astroglide and K-Y Jelly are
two brands of water-based lubrication that may be used
to keep things wet, and while saliva can be helpful for
the moment, it tends to dry the vagina out even more
than before. Just make sure that whatever you do use
is water-based, since petroleum-based products will disintegrate latex condoms.
Intercourse during menstruation is also an option,
though it may seem unappealing. The moisture from
menstrual blood serves to lubricate.
Some women may complain of the opposite problem:
too much wetness. In that case, the culprit might be the
infection cervitis, which causes lots of discharge. Here
oral sex is also influential, as a surplus of fluid may be
caused by germs from the mouth or throat. An intrauterine device (lUD) or any other foreign body in the
uterus will also increase vaginal fluids.
Dry or wet, either way, communication is vital. Being honest and direct and informative about what feels
good and what hurts can only help your level of sexual
security and comfort. And just because your partner is
wet doesn't mean she is ready to be penetrated. So talk
it out, be open to alternatives, and have fun.

Put aside your aversion to the word Indie'
Hey you. Yeah, you. The Swattie with all the
Kinks albums on vinyl, grinding your teeth and
drooling in disgust at the prospect of the new
Bizkit album selling more copies than the Magnetic Fields "69 Love Songs" ever will? Remember what pop music sounded like, back when
pop music was good music? Of course you don't.
You weren't born. You're in luck, though. The
good people at the Olde Club want to remind

you.

So put aside your aversion to the word
"indie" and come see The Aislers Set, playing
Saturday at 9 p.m. at everyone's favorite on-campus venue. There will most definitely be infectious pop to spare. You might even be able to
bob your head up and down a little, which means
it'll be, by default, at least as exciting as any
given Swat party. Given that that's pretty low
praise, here's a little word, from music mag

N.M.E., about the Aislers Set's latest, "The Last Match": "A band custom-made to have their name
marker-penned onto your pencil

case, the Aislers Set have gone
and made on of the best albums
of the year, and the great thing
is that they remain a secret."

part

of

social

diversity

BY MORGHAN HOLT
Sunday afternoon, I sat cramped in a gym filled with parental fury, player distress and general campus confusion.
I've never even watched a football game, so the team cut
doesn't directly impact me. But I still wanted to know, given
all the underlying implications of the decision, why such
drastic measures had suddenly been taken.
I knew as soon as President Bloom stepped up to speak,
student frustration clashing with his attempts at rational
justification, the tension growing denser by the outburst,
that my questions would not be answered. But that didn't
stop me from listening, my ears perking especially when
Provost Jennie Keith came right out and said, slipped in
with a barrage ofother justifications, that the Board of Managers made its decision to cut the football, badminton and
wrestling programs in part because of "the negative aspects
ofthe culture on campus." Although Keith, when confronted
at the Monday night fireside chat, amended her statement
by asserting that she had intended to say that the athletes
on campus are affected by such negative culture, not that
they create negative culture, I wonder if that changes the
broader implications ofher statement: specifically, that athletes, by their very nature, are hard-pressed to mesh harmoniously with the rest of theSwarthmore community; that
there exists a division between the athletes and the rest of
the students.
Because most of the debate surrounding the team elimination has focused primarily on the football team, the team
most significantly numerically impacted by the decision, and
because the football team, in its connection to the Delta Upsilon fraternity, has the greatest impact on the Swarthmore
social scene of the three cut sports, I decided to delve most
intimately into the cultural effects of the football team on
our campus. I asked myself, as well as a wide range of my
fellow students, if the campus social scene would change
significantly without the football team and, if so, whether
such change would have an ultimately positive or negative
effect.
I have not personally been involved in any divisive altercationswith the football players, but I've heard them vehemently recounted. I've heard how certain footballers have
gotten in the faces of visible members ofSwarthmore's queer
community, harassing them and calling them faggots, for
no apparent reason. And I've heard ad infinitum about the
tirades of many a drunken player.
But I've also seen the other side. I've listened to people
berate our football team for its infamously low SAT scores.
I've heard the unfounded claims that the football team is, as
a whole, the dumbest group on campus, that they don't deserve to be here. I've heard these men called oafs, buffoons,
idiots, bad influences on the Swarthmore image. And I'm
not sure what that is, to be honest at least not anymore.
I thought our campus was about tolerance, but, judging
from what I've seen recently from both sides of the spectrum, I guess I was wrong. I know I'm an idealist, and I like
to downplay differences and I like to think that, with a little
effort, we can all get along.
Swarthmore, obviously, is not my ideal world, and we
don't all get along. I want to know why. I want to know why
we're so divided, why in this controversy we are either
staunch supporters of the football agenda or staunch supporters of football's elimination, with a piddling few lurking tepidly in between. I want to know what it is that
footballers do that sets them apart from the rest of our campus. I want to know if a stigma against student-athletes (specifically football players) exists and, if indeed it does, what
inspired it. I want to know if the football players make an
active effort to dispel such stereotyping, or if their behavior
perpetuates it.
I want to know all these things and had hoped that attending the fireside chat would help, but the board specifically dodged the issue, not wanting to incite the underlying
division, not wanting to resort to stereotyping themselves.
Besides, as philosophy professor Hans Oberdiek clearly
stated, it hadn't been a consideration for the Board of Managers when they made their final decision to cut football. In
fact, quite the contrary: they had established that studentathletes do not have a negative impact on Swarthmore's com-

munity and culture.
But if this is so, why don't the students agree?
Nearly every student I talked to, footballer or not, told
me that there is a stigma against student-athletes on our
campus. Nearly everyone cited the stigma as a problem, regardless of whether they felt it was justified. Those who felt
theathletes (specifically, those football players involved with

It wasn't a night for partying at Delta Upsilon Saturday. The door was shut and most partygoers were instead at a rally.

I

WITH FOOTBALL CUT, THERE MIGHT BE "NO
MORE DU." BUT WOULD THE FRAT CLOSING
ITS DOORS BE GOOD OR BAD FOR CAMPUS?

DU) deserved the stigma told me thatthe way to rectify it was
to do exactly what the administration was suggesting: limit the
number of admitted athletes.
"If we keep the culture to a minimum, it won't have the bearing needed to create a problem, and the stigma will be proportionately minimized," claimed one senior, who told me that the
campus culture has experienced significant negative social
ramifications with the recent influx of recruited football play-

ers.

People aren't making these stereotypes up, as some might
suggest, or they wouldn'tbe as pervasive as they are. It's not
simply a rumor that the football players are pretty wild guys
anyone who has attended a DU party has seen them at their
raucous best. As a group, they're wild men, all right, but I'm
not sure that justifies the stereotype because I'm not sure that
wildness, in and of itself, is a bad thing. This campus needs a
little light-hearted foolery interspersed with its rigorous aca-

demics.

Light-hearted foolery, yes—but that's not the same as some
students' contention that players destroy campus unity by creating "an uncomfortable abyss between themselves and the rest
ofcampus," a claim supported by pointing to the "football table"
in Sharpies and the players' alleged arrogance and general disdainfor all things Swattie. "If they don't want to be here and do
the work and act like Swatties and embrace tolerance," asked a
junior who asked to be kept anonymous, "if they hate the place
so much, then why should we put up with them, why should we
support them in their time of need, after all their homophobia
and disrespect?"
The other side, the football team and its supporters, assert
that such statements and such flagrant resentment are what's
really damaging campus unity, and thatthe damage stems from

the intolerance of the larger Swarthmore community and
their outlandish assumptions
about SAT scores, about
recreational activities, about personal agendas. As Josh

Loeffler 'O3 so poignantly stated at Monday night's "fireside"
chat, there is a definite anti-football vibe on this campus,
like it's footballers against the rest. Athlete Marc Jeuland
'Ol said the vibe pertained particularly to football players,
but that he didn't think it was warranted and wished he
could find a way to end it.
Some of the students I interviewed told me that, without
football, the social scene would all but go to hell. "There'd
be no more DU," Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 told me. And he left it at
that, assuming he'dmade his point. Ironically, football critics responded with the same one-liner. "There'dbe no more
DU," said Josh Lindsey 'Ol, intending his statement to imply that it would be a good thing, that campus life would
drastically improve without the fraternity.
Drastic social repercussions will follow the decision to
cut the football program, and, contrary to the belief of the
Board of Managers, the campus will lose on the diversity
issue. The football players are notorious for causing a stir,
for lightening the loads of their fellow students with their
outrageous antics, and for being our scapegoats. They might
be a little more vocal about their antics (or, because of their
size, more noticeable), and, drunk or not, they definitely
don't mesh with the rest of the Swarthmore crowd. But for
all their foolery, they are not the bumbling idiots they're
presumed to be. We're striving to achieve the highest degree of diversity, right? Well, guys, that includes football
players. And, football players, that includes us nerds. The
issue isn't whether the football team adds to or detracts from
"Swarthmore culture," it's about how to best integrate the
diversity comprised by these beefy men into our own concept of campus diversity. What would life at Swat be like
without football? Boring. So our license plates might be a
little safer, but, according to the only real consensus of the
athletes and non-athletes, the pro-football and anti-football
sects, the energy level would definitely decrease.
