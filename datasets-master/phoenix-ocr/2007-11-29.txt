Thieves target LPAC and multiple dorm rooms

at night.

the past few weeks, additional thefts in McCabe
have been reported, with several recent thefts occurring in
the dorms as well. According to Director of Public Saftey
Owen Redgrave, there have been no substantial findings,
leads or suspects in any of these incidents. However, this
past Monday, one individual was arrested and three others
cited on charges of attempted burglary of sound equipment

At approximately 10 p.m. last Sunday, Nov. 25, Public Safety
Officer Robert Stephano was patrolling the campus and
securing buildings. During his patrol, he first observed four
subjects in the main stage area, and then stopped them as
they were trying to leave the building carrying equipment
from LPAC in what appeared to be attempted burglary,
Over

according to Redgrave.
"Subsequent investigation showed that [the suspects]
had sound equipment from the building that they were trying to take out," Redgrave said. "The subjects were all relatively local, but none were from Swarthmore." At that point,
another public safety officer and Swarthmore Police were
summoned to assist at the site.
According to Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig, the
police department responded to a call from Stephano, who
had stopped the four individuals at the doors near the main
stage trying to leave the building carrying electrical cords.
"It was determined that none of them had any affiliation
with the school," Craig said. "One of the individuals was
arrested for theft and the other three were cited for criminal

trespassing."
Managing Director of LPAC Jim Murphy was also contacted during that time and asked to identify the equipment
found on the subjects and possibly any other missing property. "It was some standard extension chords, some very specific sound cables and some lighting instrument cables,
almost all of which have no application in the real world,"
Murphy said.
According to Murphy, the total value of the equipment
that the suspects attempted to remove was around $2OO. All
of the property had been taken directly from the main stage

"That's part of the issue with the campus in general, the
unwrittenpolicies for things to be open and accessible to students when they're here, which creates a bit of a nightmare
for all," Murphy said. "It's simply severely understaffed for
that kind of policy. But I also think it's a policy that fits well
with the Swarthmore mission and ideal."

"[Cameras are] just a tool. You're not
going to solve every crime that
happens, but what you never know is
how many crimes you have
prevented."

Director of Public Safety
McCabe was also subject to another theft. On Nov. 12, the

the basement of McCabe. The steel security cable had been
cut and the perpetrator had taken the monitor.
In response to the McCabe thefts, Public Safety has been
reviewing some material from the security camera recordings, but has not been able find anything substantial so
far."We haven't finished reviewing all the tapes, but there
are lots of things that would keep the cameras from picking

it up. Few people would take things and blatantly carry out
something like thatand I'd be very surprised if we were able
to see something," Redgrave said.
He also noted that reviewing the security footage is a
time consuming ordeal, given the limited manpower and
resources that Public Safety has available. "Cameras can
serve in many ways as a tool for law enforcement,"

Redgrave said. "They are a big help to law enforcement

when somebody sees or suspects that somebody is responsible for a crime and then we can go back with that witness

and confirm a visual of the suspect."
Redgrave also added that the cameras serve as a possible
preventive measure toward crime. "For some people, having
cameras will keep them from committing a crime," he said.
"[Cameras are] just a tool. You're not going to solve every
crime that happens, but what you never know is how many
crimes you have prevented."
Multiple incidents of stolen student property from dorms
have also been recently reported. In one of the incidents, a
wallet was taken from Dana that contained an unknown
amount of cash, some credit cards and the student's driver's
license, though no use of the stolen credit cards was subsequently reported.
In another incident, a laptop was stolen over
Thanksgiving break from a dorm room in Willets. The dorm
room was part of a quad of two adjoining doubles, and the
students from both rooms claimed to have locked their doors
before leaving for break.
Monica Cody 'lO, whose laptop was stolen out of her
room, recounted the context of the event. "One [of my quadmates] had her laptop just lying on top her bed. Only my laptop got stolen," she said. "Maybe it would help if they just
locked the windows. I know I can get into dorms through
windows which means anyone else can or maybe we could
have sliding cards to get into dorms instead of having key
locks that are more easily broken into."
There have also been other incidents within the dorms
that weren't reported to Public Safety. In one particular incident, a student'siPod was stolen from Mertz. "I didn't report
[the theft] at the time because I thought it would show up,
but so far it hasn't so now I am assuming that someone did
steal it," Halona Jackson 11 said. "But it's odd because I had
so many other things in my room, and for some reason that
is the only thing that got stolen." The recent series of thefts
occurring under many different circumstances and at many
different locations have led to calls for greater alert and
attention to security throughout the whole campus.
"[Thefts] are never constant, we always seem to go through
peaks and valleys of criminal activities and it's very complicated to dissect." Redgrave said.

Essie Mae's cracks down, clarifies prices
BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu
Recently,

there

has been

confusion

regarding the Essie Mae's Snack Bar's
charges for sandwiches.
Despite speculations that Essie Mae's
would be raising its prices for extras on
sandwiches, there will be no changes in pricing of items, just a clarification, according to
Dining Services' Cash Operations Manager
Gusti Ruhri, who said that the charge for
additional toppings had always been there
but was often ignored.
"It's slipped through and has to stop,"
Ruhri said. With prices of food rising, the
additional toppings can add up in the costs

for

Dining Services.
Sandwiches at Essie Mae's Snack Bar
come with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato and
one topping.
They also include chips, pickles, and a 12
oz. drink. Any more toppings on the sandwich are an additional charge, which varies
based on topping. "[lt's] gotten out of hand
with all these extras," Ruhri said.
"[Students] have to know [that they] have to
pay more because up here it is not all you
can eat."
The limit on included toppings is the
price one pays for the variety of the different
food at Essie Mae's. To clarify the difference
between Sharpies and Essie Mae's, Ruhri
said, "You can go to Sharpies for all you can
teat. Here you have choices." Ruhri said that
she wants students to have choices and does
not want to take things away. She believes
that the clarification is justified because this
is the way the system has always worked but
was just never properly followed.

The enforcement of the extra charges for
additional toppings, Ruhri believes, should
not deter students from going to Essie Mae's
Snack Bar. "It is nice to come here. You have
great service and variety and that is the
beauty of it," Ruhri said.
The boards in the Snack Bar will now
clearly state that there will be an additional
charge for extra sandwich toppings and will
list the prices for each.
Ruhri has had some student feedback
about the clarification of the pricing of sandwiches. "Most of the students that come said
they understand," Ruhri said. She has not

heard any negative feedback. She believes
that by providing guest checks, on which
servers write the specifics of an order, it will
not be any harder for the students because
the checks will tell the cashiers what the
proper charge should be.

Dining
Services Director Linda
McDougall said that she has not yet heard
feedback from students. Even so, she said, "I
was asked by Student Council to send out a
clarification to the student body and I am in
the process of doing that now." Last Monday,
McDougall sent an e-mail notification to the
student body describing the clarification
and the prices of extras.

Student Council has received some
feedback about the issue. "We have gotten
a few students who were concerned
because they have to use more points for
extras," said Student Council President
Peter Gardner 'OB.
Because the new clarifications were
just recently implemented, Student
Council is now waiting for any more feedback. For the time being, Student Council
believes that Linda McDougall is doing
what is necessary to keep Essie Mae's economical.
"Dining Services is not out there to
make a profit. They are here to feed the

students good food and I trust [Linda
McDougall] to do that," said Gardner.
Gardner suspects that the Council will
receive feedback in the coming weeks once
students see how it affects them.
"If students start to believe this is a big
issue and we need to open up dialogue with
Dining Services, then we will," Gardner
said. "If not, then we just have to trust
Linda she does a fantastic job."
The new clarification methods recently
went into effect at Essie Mae's Snack Bar.
Students can send any opinions on the
issue to Student Council and also to the
Dining Committee.

Two alumni awarded prestigious Rhodes scholarship
Brubaker and Sniderman will study in Oxford after being recognized for academic and personal achievement
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu

Since 2000, five Swarthmore College students have been
awarded a Rhodes scholarship. Among the five are the two
most recent winners, Rebecca Brubaker 'O6 and Andrew
Sniderman 'O7, who are the 27th and 28th Swarthmore students to have received this award. Both will be studying at
Oxford University next October.
Brubaker, the first female Swarthmore student to
receive the scholarship, completed an honors major in
political science at Swarthmore and will be studying
"migration, resettlement and integration in Europe and
along its

borders."

"I feel like my dream made full circle
when Melissa informed me
I was
the first female to represent
Swarthmore. That... made me feel
incredibly proud."
Rebecca Brubaker 'O6

Brubaker explained that while growing up, she had
heard people around her speak highly of the
Rhodes scholarship but that she had never heard of a
woman becoming a Rhodes scholar.
"Thus since childhood, there was a certain mystique
making it an ultimate personal
about the scholarship
but as a

worrying about how to support themselves during graduate school," Mandos said.
"I think they met the criteria in every level and perhaps
exceeded it," Eldridge said. "I also think that it's encouraging for other Swarthmore students to see their compatriots succeed in this way."

Sniderman, co-founder of the Genocide Intervention

Network, is still deciding between a course of study in
either Philosophy or Politics.
Sniderman also hopes to do some research at Oxford's
Changing Character of War Programme.
"I hope to continue doing research on private military

companies (a project I started with Professor James Kurth
during a directed reading)," Sniderman said in an e-mail.
"I got to know Andrew through his work with
Swarthmore Sudan [now Swarthmore Stand] on genocide
intervention and from what I understand of him he's
always been other directed in his concerns," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said as he explained that
the [Rhodes] program looks for students who are both academically successful and involved in "other directed"

efforts.

Both Eldridge and Fellowships

and Prizes Advisor
Melissa Mandos believe that Swarthmore properly prepares students for the application process.
"Our students are very good candidates for the Rhodes
Scholarship for two reasons: first, Swarthmore's rigorous
academics have prepared them for work at Oxford, and second, our students live their education and are active on
and off campus on issues of concern to them," Mandos said.
The scholarship covers all educational costs for the
scholars and, upon acceptance, funds additional grants for
research. "It's a very generous program providing full
tuition and room and board. So a person can go to Oxford
and really throw themselves into their studies without

"I am incredibly lucky. I am also deeply grateful for the
support provided by Swarthmore faculty and staff
this
application is a real team effort," Sniderman said. "I want
to especially thank James Kurth, Ben Berger, Ken Sharpe,
Hans Oberdiek, Cynthia Halpern and Maurice Eldridge for
their teaching and support. I stand on the shoulders of

Swarthmore's giants."
Brubaker strongly encourages interested students to
apply for the Rhodes scholarship.
"Given the parallels between our honors system and

Oxford's tutorial system, it should seem like an even more
natural fit for some of you. Please feel free to be in contact
if any of you are interested. I would be happy to help in
whatever way I can," Brubaker wrote.

Newly created Car Authorization Committee prepares for spring
From PARKING, p. 3
The committee will consider a myriad
of criteria in determining who will
receive a permit.
There are 110 to 115 parking spots on
campus, and the CAC will be handing out
new permits based on how many students
will be giving up their spaces to go abroad
for the spring semester.
"The group is going to set some clear,
important rankings," Westphal said, in
regard to how permits will be handed out
according to need.
The new application will require more
proof of reasoning behind a student's
need for a permit.
If a student cites a medical condition
as a factor for needing a car, Westphal
said a doctor's signature would be needed.
The same would apply for a student needing a car for a research project or student
group activity; a professor or dean would
need to sign the application assuring that
the student would be using the car regularly for their stated purpose.

haven't been huge requests for parking
permits," Westphal said.

The CAC will now also be considering

PhillyCarShare was a hybrid Prius.
"If [the pod] gets a lot of use, we might
ask to have one right on campus,"
Westphal said. "If we had one right on
Dupont parking lot, that would be convenient for other people."
In terms of other alternatives to parking on campus with a permit, the
Swarthmore Borough Council allows students to purchase parking spaces in the
Ville for $5O a month.
The price has risen from several years
ago when it was around $25 to $3O a month
for a parking space.
"The vast majoring of people who rent
the spaces are Swarthmore students,"
Swarthmore Mayor Eck Gerner said.
Gerner estimated that two thirds of parking spaces in the Ville are rented.
Westphal has approached Gerner
about the possibility of decreasing the
prices, which may be seen as too steep for
some Swarthmore students.
$5O
"If $5O is perceived as too much
is about two dollars a day, so I don't think
it's too burdensome," Gerner said.
The price for parking spaces, according to Gerner, would not be raised for the
next year.
Gerner also emphasized that there was
absolutely no parking in the Ville from 2
a.m. to 6 a.m. for students without parking spaces, a rule they have tried to
enforce with multiple signs.
Gerner said that if a Swarthmore
police officer was to notice that a car had

streets, the officer would run the license
number through a datase and have Public
Safety move the car if the license was
found to be in a student's name.
Gerner acknowledged the difficulty of
dealing with the parking issue within the
college community. "I think it's a very
serious matter, and it needs to be
addressed in a larger context," Gener
said.

"A key thing here is
determing what the
college's policy on parking
availability is for people
who want to park."
Eck Gerner
Swarthmore Borough
Mayor
Gerner, in his time as mayor of the
borough, has witnessed the issue of parking over the year and the strain it creates
for both students and residents. "I would
say parking was a big issue when I came
in, and it still is in the fall of 2007."
Additionally, Gerner encouraged the
idea of creating a dialogue between students and administrators to determine
how to deal with parking issues and said
he would welcome the opportunity to participate. "A key thing here is determining
what the college's policy on parking availability is for people who want to park on
campus, to set up an opportunity for the
college to entertain discussion of the policy of the college in having a car on campus,"

Gerner said.

Media maintains practice of Fair Trade
BY SARAH PETERSON
spetersl@swarthmore.edu
For students who love neighboring Media's small, weland for those who haven't
coming shops and restaurants
yet been
there's now a new impetus to visit. Not only is
Media, Pa. a great place for going out or hanging out, but as
of summer 2006 it is also holds the distinction of being the
United States' first Fair Trade Town. As a result of this, Fair
Trade-Certified food and drink are more widely available
along with handicrafts and other goods.
The change has also led to wider awareness ofFair Trade,
and ongoing educational efforts both local and global.
Two summers ago, the Media Borough Council passed a
resolution in favor of supporting Fair Trade and also agreeing to serve exclusively Fair Trade coffee at its events. This
commitment met one of the five requirements for a town to
be designated Fair Trade, according to standards set by
British and European Fair Trade movements. There are
over 300 Fair Trade Towns in Europe, and currently a number of towns and cities in the United States are following in
Media's footsteps.
These include Brattleboro and Milwaukee, which has
declared itself the country's first Fair Trade city. Amherst,
Portsmouth, Los Angeles and San Francisco are among the
cities also getting involved in the movement.
The definition of Fair Trade varies according to the type
of product being certified. Products are certified according
to standards set by an overseeing organization, which focuses on providing fair compensation to workers, and upholding labor and environmental standards in the production
process.

The movement towards Fair Trade status began in 2005,
when local entrepreneur Hal Taussig decided that it would
be great for Media to be a Fair Trade Town, the first in the
country. Taussig is the founder of Untours Travel, and since
1995 has been putting all of his profits from that endeavor
into a foundation that provides low-interest loans to underprivileged people looking to start their own businesses.
Elizabeth Killough, the associate director at the Untours
Foundation, started to explore the possibility of a Fair Trade
Media. The campaign quickly took on a life of its own and
was met with surprising excitement. One of the first steps
Killough took was to bring the issue of Fair Trade to the
Media Business Authority. With conscious consumerism
gaining popularity everywhere, business owners in Media
saw many good reasons to support Fair Trade.
"They got the idea immediately," Killough said. "They
understood the ethical reasons and the marketing advantage."
Not only was the proposal met with little opposition, but
the Business Authority arranged for the issue to be put onto
the Media Borough Council's agenda for the monthly meeting two days later.
At the time of the Council's passage of the resolution,
Media was already fulfilling the second and third criteria of

were already providing and usingFair Trade Certified products. What remained after the Council's decision was for a
coalition to form, and for the media to cover the issue.
Both these criteria were quickly achieved. The Media
Fair Trade Committee meets weekly at the Coffee Club Cafe
in Media, which sells Fair Trade coffee from supplier Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters
which is also the coffee supplier for Sharpies and Tarble. And in terms of press, America's
First Fair Trade Town has received coverage in newspapers,
environmental blogs—and in Martha Stewart's magazine.
On July 8, 2006, the borough declared itself a Fair Trade
Town.
"It went way faster than anyone expected," said Selene
Whole Foods Co-op's General Manager Ira Joseph, who estimated that it took little more than six months to get from the
idea's inception to its realization.

The only expressed concern within the community was

that businesses who didn't stock Fair Trade Certified products might be "put down" in the process of publicizing the
decision. The decision's supporters insisted thatthe cam-

THE CRITERIA OF BEING FAIR TRDE
What it means to be a Fair Trade town is to meet the following five
critera, according to www.fair-trade.org, the Web site for the Fair Trade
Foundation:

1. Local council passes a resolution supporting Fair Trade, and agrees
to serve Fair Trade tea and coffee at its meetings and in its offices and
canteens.
2. A range of (at least two) Fair Trade products is readily available in
the
shops and local cafes/catering establishments. It should be
easy for local people to find Fair Trade products as they do their everyday shopping.
3. Fair Trade products are used by a number of local work places

(estate agents, hairdressers etc) and community organizations
(churches, schools etc)
4. Attract media coverage and popular support for the campaign.
5. A local Fair Trade steering group is convened to ensure cotinued
commitment to its Fair Trade Town status.

Amnesty provides perspective with a meal

The group's banquet on Friday will allow a closer look at the injustice and inequality of poverty
BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore.edu

"Hunger" and "Banquet" are seemingly oxymoronic
words and, put together, appear almost ridiculous.
However, the Hunger Banquet is not akin to most
Swarthmore banquets that are replete with cultural culinary delights. Although Amnesty's International Banquet
will offer food, the event's main purpose is to provide an
interactive lesson about global inequalities in income distribution and to feature examples of projects that have successfully improved impoverished communities.
Associate professor of history Tim Burke will moderate
a discussion following the main event, which will be held
on Friday, Nov. 30. The details of this "interactive" element, however, remain a surprise.

involvement in Philadelphia and experience with recruiting volunteers.
Also, several representatives from Oxfam America, an
international relief group that works towards solving
hunger, poverty and injustice, will also be present at the
event.

Swarthmore has many groups targeting specific aspects
of social injustice, such as Swarthmore Immigrant Rights,
Class Activists, and even Amnesty International, with
each group focusing on addressing various aspects of the
widespread problems of poverty. "Having food is the most

'O9 said.

However, according to organizers, the danger of the
presentation is reiterating the obvious. "Swat's audience is
educated, so it's not just about awareness," Aurora Munoz
'lO said. Instead of informing students through a lecture,
the banquet will try to create a model of hunger to evoke
empathy from students. Understanding is the first step.
Burke calls the idea an alternative to "hunger porn" or
visual imagery of hungry people manipulating emotions of
pity. "In between book knowledge and experience, people
need to emotionally feel the scale of the problem," Burke
said, in order to encourage experiencing the gap between

the "haves" and "have-nots" of food. The interactive experience of role-playing is an attempt to stimulate Swatties
by giving them new emotional perspective.
"The first task is to witness the world. I am content with

At the Hunger Banquet, students and other attendees
will partake in the interactive activity while dining, after
which Burke will make a short introduction speech and

have been successful in dealing with various issues relating to hunger.

These short presentations are intended to encourage
others to take action for these causes as well.

Ultimately, organizers expect that participants will be
inspired in a unique way. The variety of events will hopefully reach out to all the students. "We wanted to tailor it
to the student body," Amnesty president Linda Wang 'O9
said. "For people who are already doing this versus people
who are just getting their feet wet."
"I got involved with Oxfam in high school with the
Make Trade Fair campaign, and organized a successful
hunger banquet at my high school, and have wanted to see
it done on campus," Wang said. The banquet will be an
opener for more events relating to social and economic
agricultural justice next semester.

"Having food is the most basic
element to fulfill."

Microfinance is a program that has been developed and
furthered by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammed Yunnas
through the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Camillus' program allows groups of women to take small loans by combining their collateral. "People in the Quarter eat meals
one or two times a day. People who are hungry can use the
profits from running the business to buy food for a family,"
she said. Camillus began the program this summer and will
analyze its success for her public policy thesis.
SHIP, too, is an example of a Swarthmore-based organization fighting hunger at a local level. "What we're doing is
taking a huge issue like hunger and dealing with it on a
local level, one bag lunch at a time," SHIP member Nancy
Chu 10 said.
Ada Okun 'll, one of the organizers for the Hunger
Banquet, hopes thatthe programs will inspire people. "One
can care about these issues but at the same time struggle
with the daunting task of actually making a difference,"
she said.
On the flipside, Burke hopes that students will also recognize the difficulties in undertaking the construction of

such a program.

"Ultimately, all the organizers recognize that the outcome for each student willbe different but it will offer effective ways for individuals to get involved in the larger effort
to fight global poverty," Okun said.

for about 20 years."
England explained that in her generation, there was an increase in premarital

beliefs, students say the hook up has
replaced the casual date on college cam-

puses, according to a Stanford University
professor's study.
Professor Paula England surveyed
more than 4,000 students, freshmen
through seniors.
The study included students at seven

universities across the country.
"I'm trying to understand the whole
undergraduate hook up culture," she said.
England said the survey asked students a variety of questions.
The survey asked about students' experiences with and attitudes toward hooking up, dating and relationships.
By senior year, surveyed students
reported having, on average, 6.9 hook ups;
28 percent have had 10 or more and 24 percent have never hooked up, according to
the study.
England said definitions of the term
"hook up" are varied. According to the
study, about a quarter of all hook ups

Today's hook up culture is a way of
having some sexual behavior, but more
casually, England said.
"[ln a relationship] you have to be
devoted to being intimate, which is not an
easy thing. "I think the majority [of stu-

dent relationships fall] somewhere in the
middle range, where they have people
they know and know pretty well but don't

also said hooking up "is kind of different
than it was 10 years ago."
"Some people think it is safer than it

added.
About 50 percent of Penn State students who are sexually active say they
practice safe sex by regularly using condoms, Holowatz said.

"That's one reason we encourage peo-

ple to drink responsibly," he added.
One of the study's main conclusions is
the disparity between men and women in
a hook up partnership, England said.
"In hook ups, there is a really big
orgasm gap between the sexes," she said.
The study reports that of all hook ups,
regardless of what sexual activity took
place, 44 percent of men experienced an
orgasm and 19 percent of women did.
Couples are more likely to engage in
behavior that prioritizes male pleasure
and orgasm, England said.
Although most hook ups don't result in
relationships, most relationships start
with hook ups, England added.

Facilities fail to meet Disabilities Act criteria
The college settled with the Justice Department after being found in non-compliance with ADA standards
BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyal@swarthmore.edu
An out-of-court settlementbetween the college and the
Justice Department comes after an evaluation of the college found that some facilities and amenities do not meet

the Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility criteria.
Swarthmore College is one of three higher education
institutions to have been audited by the Department of
Justice after an'evaluation of the college's accordance
with the ADA.
From a random survey of the college beginning in
April 2006, the Department of Justice determined that
some doorknobs, restrooms, signs and walkways, among
other campus facilities, do not comply with the ADA'S
requirements.

"Swarthmore does not have a
pattern of not wanting to
comply with ADA. We've been quite
proactive in trying to make [the]
campus... more compliant."
Susan Smythe
Former LPAC Managing Director
...

The University of Chicago and Colorado College were
the other two colleges randomly selected for evaluation
by the Department of Justice.
Additionally, Duke University and the University of
Michigan were among the first schools to be audited for
non-compliance with ADA standards. In 1991, the ADA

created a set of standards for building requirements and
support services, codified in civil rights law, to guarantee equal access for persons with disabilities.
Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services
Stu Hain stated that after 1992 every new construction or
renovation on college property was designed to comply
with ADA requirements. Some of buildings that were

renovated during this time include Kolhberg, Trotter and
North Campus pathways.
The construction of LPAC, however, was completed in
1991, and is one of the buildings whose structural features
do not meet the ADA standards.
Hain also cited Worth and Wharton dorms as examples of college buildings which are clearly not in compliance.
Last week, the college signed a settlement statement,
in which "there is no civil penalty clause at all," Hain
said.

According to a press release issued by the Department
of Justice, the settlement states that the college "has
agreed to prepare a plan to make alterations to its facilities within six years and relocate services and programs

to accessible facilities with prior notice."
Although the college will not face a monetary penalty,
the Department of Justice has asked the college to survey
existing facilities, evaluate the college's adherence to
ADA requirements and develop a plan to be executed
over the next six years.
"We've spent money every year to mitigate the issues
... We have two million dollars of work planned for this
summer," Hain said. The Department of Justice, however, does not provide funding for implementing structural
improvements.
Hain also said that the college will be removing barriers and problematic features from the older buildings.
Between now and October 2008, the college will be evaluating the campus and making some changes.
According to Hain, the toilets in the Lang Performing
Arts Center will be more accessible, as will the path to

Bond Hall.
Three percent of dorm toilets must be accessible to
people with disabilities, and currently Alice Paul and
David Kemp Hall are the only two dorms that nearly
meet these requirements.
In addition to changing structural features,-the college will be ensuring the presence of appropriate assisted listening devices, signs and directions for navigating
the college's Web site.
Former LPAC managing director Susan Smythe is
responsible for managing the execution of the changes
and ensuring the fulfillment of the settlement agreement.
According to Smythe, the college has hired an outside
consultant to conduct the evaluation and solution-find-

ing processes. "I think it's important to note that
Swarthmore does not have a pattern of not wanting to
comply with ADA. We've been quite proactive prior to
involvement with the [Department of Justice] in trying
to make a campus of largely older buildings and a lot of
landscape more compliant," Smythe said in an e-mail,
regarding the college's handling of the settlement with
the Justice Department.

"[The settlement] is a friendly
negotiation between the college
and the Department of Justice.
I believe this will make
[the college] a better place."
Stu Hain
Associate Vice President of
Facilities and Services
"In trying to follow the settlement agreement, one
thing that will be important is trying to follow the
restraints of the DO J and ADA without losing site of the
mission of Swarthmore College, and what we are trying
to achieve educationally. I think it will take a lot of creative thought to carry out the assigned scope in the time
allotted and in a way that's sensitive to the needs of the
college as a whole," Smythe said.
The Department of Justice's press release contained a
statement from Acting Assistant Attorney General for
the Civil Rights Division Rena J. Comisac, praising the
college's efforts.
"We are pleased that Swarthmore is taking steps to
make its facilities and programs more accessible to per-

sons with disabilities and commend Swarthmore for its
spirit of cooperation in working with the Department,"
Comisac said.
The settlement is not at all punitive, and is "a friendly negotiation between the college and the Department of
Justice," Hain said. "I believe this will make [the college]
a better place."

Macklin felt that the program is a valuable addition that gives Williams' students practical skills to supplement their
liberal arts education.
While Barton currently doesn't have
any specific plans as the new ITS director,
she is eager to take on her new position at
Swarthmore.
Stephenson believes she will be an
asset to the community based on her prior

Recent stem cell findings change current debate
BY TATIANA LAU
THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN (PRINCETON)
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
Though the issue of
embryonic stem cell research has been one of the most
contentious political topics in recent years, a landmark
discovery may finally bring an end to the debate.
separate
two
In
published
studies
last week, researchers from Kyoto University and the
University of Wisconsin led by Shinya Yamanaka and
James Thomson, respectively announced that they had
successfully reprogrammed normal human skin cells to
act like embryonic stem cells. "I think it's probably the
most important finding in biology in 10 years," molecular
biology and Wilson School professor Lee Silver said.
The findings may render moot the ethical debate over
the use of embryonic stem cells for research.
-

-

-

The transformed cells are referred to as "induced
pluripotent stem cells," or iPS.
The iPS method is so straightforward that its creator,
Yamanaka, told The Wall Street Journal that "any scientist with basic technology in molecular and cell biology
can do [the] reprogramming."
Silver said that the method is "such that scientists
could be able to repeat [it] easily."
"Once we have an understanding of the biology of
cells, there's no limit to what we could transform," he
said. Silver added that he expected the new method, if
verified, would be immediately adopted by researchers
around the world.
Though the newly discovered method is being touted
as a far less controversial alternative to embryonic
research than many past methods, former University
president Harold Shapiro, Princeton University class of
'64
a former chairman of the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission who in 2005 was named the overseer of stem cell research in New Jersey said in an email that the value of embryonic stem cell research
should not be minimized.
"It is worth noting that without human embryonic cell
lines, the Wisconsin and Kyoto work could not have progressed, since the embryonic cell lines provided us with
the 'markers' for pluripotency," Shapiro said.
Shapiro added that, while he was confident about the
legitimacy of the new findings, embryonic stem cells will
still continue to play a vital role in research.
"It is quite possible that we will continue to need
human embryonic stem cells for some aspects of the continuing research program surrounding stem cells,"
Shapiro said.
--

"Once we have an understanding
of the biology of cells,
there's no limit to what we
could transform."
Lee Silver
Wilson School professor
Developed in 1998, the original method for procuring
the embryonic stem cells involved removing eggs from
an ovary, fertilizing the eggs in vitro and removing
embryonic stem cells from the resulting blastocyst.
The process of retrieving embryonic stem cells raised
several concerns from opponents who argued that
embryos, as nascent human life, should merit the same
protections as humans who have already been born.
In 2001, President Bush signed a bill that provided federal funding to research using the already existing stem
cell lines and not to research using new lines, thereby
limiting the amount of researchthat could be done.
Additionally, New Jersey voters rejected a ballot ref-

erendum this month that would have lent $450 million
for stem cell research in the state.
Under the new method publicized last week, skin cells
are removed from a human, after which four genes
are inserted into the cells.
The inserted genes, transported by way of a retrovirus, then transform the skin cells into pluripotent stem
cells, which are capable of differentiating into various
cell types.

"I think it's probably the
most important finding in
biology in 10 years."
Lee Silver
Wilson School professor
But politics professor Robert George, who serves on
Bush's council on bioethics and has vocally weighed in
against embryonic stem cell research in the past, lauded
the new method as a way to balance the needs of science
and ethics.
"From the beginning we have been arguing that we
must do everything we can to advance the cause of stem
cell science but without sacrificing our respect for nas-

cent human life and the principle of the inherent and
equal dignity of each and every member of the human
family," he told the conservative publication The Weekly
Standard last Wednesday.
"This latest news just goes to show that it really is pos-

sible," he said.
Silver said the recent new findings would level the
playing field for stem cell researchers all around the
world.
Because of the ethical issues surrounding embryonic stem cell procurement, many governments
have banned embryonic stem cell research, while
others including those of California and Singapore
have legalized it. This has led scientists to flock to
jurisdictions that permit the use of embryonic stem
cells.
With the iPS method, however, scientists will no
longer have to relocate in order to legally conduct cutting-edge research.
"There will be no more geographic disparity," Silver
said.
Silver added that, though the iPS method has not been
perfected, any problems with the procedure will likely be
discovered soon.
One risk in this method is that the genes in the transporting virus could become incorporated into the genes
of the transformed cells, causing them to become

"I think it's an excellent idea, since Da Vinci's can be
a little bit dim and seem somewhat too large and a little

evening hours, should bring in more Swatties than
they've had before now," Adam Koontz 'OB, a frequenter

Additional changes that Da Vinci's has been implementing include new late night hours on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday evenings from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m., in
addition to the regular hours during the day. Only
recently, Da Vinci's has also been advocating longer

First NOLArize Benefit Concert a success
BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, Nov. 17, the usual obscure
indie fare at Olde Club was refreshingly
absent to make way for an excellent showcasing of some serious Swarthmore talent in
the NOLArize Benefit Concert that rounded
out New Orleans Week. The line-up featured
a whole range of acts tHat either paid homage to the rich musical heritage born out of
the city with covers of eafeily recognizable
pop songs or went straight for an impressive
facsimile of genuine Mardi Gras music.
Tigest Tamrat 'OB, responsible for amassing the night's talents, said, "We wanted
soul, we wanted jazz. Obviously, punk rock
would not be acceptable. Anything that
involved trombones, brass instruments,
that's what we wanted."
The concert was held for the cause of
"supporting communities in New Orleans,"
NOLArize founder Marissa Davis 'OB said.
Specifically, the donations raised by the concert are, Davis said, "going to supporting an
effort to buy computers for the Cut-Off
Community Center" where Davis had spent
this past summer building a youth library^^
The night began with a cover band
included keyboardist Jonathan Jaquette 'll,
bass guitarist Dan Vail 'll, guitarist Ari
Klafter 'll and vocalist Eva Amesse 'll The
group took full delight in playing undeniably pop, but also undeniably R&B-inspired
jtsongs: Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy," Beyonce's
"Irreplaceable," doo-wop classic "Stand by
Me" and Gorillaz's "Feel Good Inc."
Amesse's powerful voice put a new spin on
"Crazy," forgoing Cee-Lo's scratchy, falsettoreplete vocals, and Jaquette improvised on
the keyboard in "Feel Good Inc." The group
ended with the guitar-heavy "House of the
Rising Sun," which had the strongest connection to New Orleans.
Next up were Taleah Kennedy 'lO and
Sunny Cowell 10, whose performance of
"When You Believe" quickly became an all-

out melisma extravaganza, easily comparable to the powerhouse collaboration that
inspired it. Crowd members shouted,
"Whitney, Mariah, give me a break!"
The next act was a bona fide Dixieland
combo straight out of the 1910s. The band featured Garth Griffin 'O9 on the keyboard,

Harry

Russin 'O9

on the banjo,

Hannah

Epstein 'lO on the clarinet, Dan Vail 11 on
the bass and Ed Dewey 10 on the trombone.

Griffin, taking on

an old-timey persona,

plenty ofropportunities to improvise. In
of their numbers, "Down by the Riverside,"
the drum solo quickened the tempo to the
point that when the entire band morphed
the song into "When the Saints Go Marching
In," it seemed completely on the fly.
Then, Ben Bradlow 'OB took the stage,
singing and playing the acoustic guitar, with
Russin on the accordion and Lucy
Warrington 10 on the violin. Bradlow intro-

duced each of his songs with a little discussion of its historical context, at one point
sheepishly adding, "I really shouldn't be
allowed to talk." The first song "Down in the
Flood" by Bob Dylan, though written in 1967,
could just as easily have been about the
heartache after Hurricane Katrina with
lyrics like "Momma, ain't you gonna miss
your best friend now." Next, Bradlow took
on Louis Armstrong's Dixieland staple "St.

James Infirmary Blues."
Bradlow also played a song of his own,
but it was hardly a reprieve from the bluesy

tragedy of his other songs. "I'm Not There,

£m Gone,'-' featured Bradlow singing, it
seems, about the complications of a relation"If there's a time when you had no
ship
idea what you wanted me to be / If there's a
time when you feel but just can't see."
Bradlow enlisted Warrington and Russin for
simple, elegiac backup singing, while he
himself displayed a nuanced vocal performance with a soulful warble that recalled
Antony and the Johnsons. Bradlow ended
with "James Alley Blues," a song about what
was "back in the day ... the roughest part of
New Orleans," Bradlow said.
The next act was a duo with keyboardist
Mark Loria 'OB and trombonist Marc Engel
'O9. Engel, who donned a beret, reminded his
audience, "Y'all put money in that box." The
duo's act was easily the most immersed in
jazz experimentation, playing "Search for
Philly jazz pianist McCoy Tyler,

Peace" by

which Engel said honored the musical roots
of New Orleans in a "diaspora kind of way"
and John Coltrane's "Johnny's Lament."
The concert then switched gears to a funk-

oriented band, again with Dan Vail on the
bass, guitarist Matthew Shen Goodman 'll,
drummer Aukosh Jagannath 11 and keyboardist Bert Ely see 'll Their rendition of
"Superfreak" was, out of the blue, interrupted by Ben Starr 'll, who jumped onto the
stage and grabbed the mike, saying, "Hold
on now fellas!" in a distinctly James-Brownesque manner. Sure enough, Starr took the
band a notch up in tempo with a rendition of
"Sex Machine" that had both Vail and
Jagannath in crazed improvisation sessions.
Starr's barks of "Get on Up!" sure enough
had Reed Weatherhill 'll getting up on the
stage and playing the cowbell.
The audience was awaiting the next act
on the stage when suddenly there was a cry
from the balcony above: "Does anybody
know what time it is? Mariachi tiiime!"
Swarthmore's own mariachi band had conguitars, violins
gregated on the balcony
and trumpets alike, and proceeded to ener"

gize the audience. The standout of the group
was Samuel Garcia 'OB, with his cavernous

opera voice.
Marissa Davis was fittingly the final act
of the concert. Davis was ready to sing the
spiritual "Give Me Jesus," but unfortunately the sound system was not cooperating.
Davis promptly said, "Alright, I'll do it a cappella, but you guys need to help out." She
had the crowd snapping their fingers and
the emcee G. Patrick 'lO beat boxing as she
sang, "In the morning when I rise, give me
Jesus." The last song of the night was a reggae piece to "take it back to Jamaica where
I'm from," Davis said. "Just voodoo, whatever." The lyrics were as warm as Davis's
voice "No matter where you're from, just
know that I love you."
From frenzied bluegrass to soulful yearning blues to the jubilation of Davis's humble
last act, the NOLArize Benefit Concert was a
fine ode to the music of New Orleans.

Avant-pop band Malajube electrifies with youthful pop at Olde Club
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

Blistering with exuberance, avant-pop Montreal-based
band Malajube took the stage of Olde Club Friday night,
Nov. 16, rapturously strumming, drumming, stomping and
pounding out songs off of their 2006 album, "Trompe-l'oeil."
Guttural, screamy vocals, a majestic tangle of glittering
keyboard, a softly reverberating bass, gently rattling drums
and deliriously poppy guitar chords made Malajube's
French dance songs feel like dizzy explosions of sparkling
cheap pink champagne, capturing all the youthful energy
and happy magnificence of good times with good friends.
Though lead singer Julien Mineau sings only in French,
the language barrier (for those of us who don't speak a single word of the lovely language) did not keep the crowd from
getting swept up in the vibrant pop music; throughout
Malajube's bold and upbeat set, small circles of friends
bounced and bopped and danced around like (perhaps
slightly intoxicated) silly college students, and even those
who swear they "don't dance" could be caught doing a
rather upbeat hipster sway.
"Even though the songs were in a language I didn't
understand, I didn't feel embarrassed to sing along or rock
out," Jeff Sloan 'O9 said.
Malajube's performance was like a well-kept secret
dance party, a much better (and more fun) alternative to the
UK Massive party at Paces.

12

November 29, 2007

While Pitchfork does some serious name-dropping when
describing Malajube's new album (Broken Social Scene,
Wolf Parade, Animal Collective, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,
and Tilly and the Wall were all referred to in one CD
review), I'd argue that Pitchfork is a little too generous in
its comparisons. Malajube did sound good, but I don't think
their sound was anything particularly memorable or
unique
if anything, those comparisons are only accurate
in so far as they suggest that Malajube is doing what so
many other bands are also doing by trying to imitate the
sound of the bands the review mentions.
But, what I think sets Malajube apart from every other
French-Canadian band is the exuberance, happiness and
wonder of their live performances, the youthful, jaunty,
driving energy, the overwhelming, inescapable desire to
dance around like a drunkard, the inability to keep your
arms to your sides and your feet firmly planted on the floor.
That is what makes their music so engaging; the truth
and beauty bombs that explode and make you feel like it's
high school or what you imagined high school was like for
the cool kids (cool uncool kids, in my case). And that is what
Friday at Olde Club felt like
people filtering in and out of
a casual gathering with friends with everyone having fun. If
not necessarily memorable, Malajube is undeniably fun to
see perform and they most certainly pleased the crowd.
"I thought they were the best band so far, along with Sam
Champion, to come to Olde Club this semester," Blaine
O'Neill 'll said.

Past Phoenix editors: Where are they now?
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

azalokol@swarthmore.edu

And so the epic tale begins: when my editor first proposed that I write an article catching up with old Editor-inChiefs of The Phoenix, I was at first amused. Oh Tiffany, I
thought, of course you want to know what former editors of
the paper are doing now. We'd all like to have some sort of
reassurance that our degrees are not entirely useless, that
they'll be somewhat marketable, that we won't all come to
inhabit so many cardboard boxes in New York that we'll
have our own borough.
After feeling like a child, trying to be as small and nonintrusive as possible as I wrote to important people with
fancy jobs, quite a few things caught my attention. First,
yes, even the
most alumni I contacted actually responded
ones with Wikipedia entries (the true test of success).
Second, everyone who got back to me was so eager to help
me out that they apologized for taking more than a day to
respond and took the time to give me any information I
needed, inviting me to call them at their homes or offices.
Swarthmore must have meant a lot to
them if they were so keen to talk to a
19-year-old college student. Most
importantly, I've learned that
what they've been telling us all
along is true, that major declaration forms and the specifics
of what you do at Swarthmore
aren't quite as important as
the totality of your four years
of education, that humanities
majors are not destined to live
in homes of cardboard and that
what you study here in no way

determines what you do
once you leave.

Phoenix came out twice a week. "There was no alternative
source of campus news, so all of us on the paper took ourselves very seriously, since we were, after all, the Paper of
Record. This was just one of the delusions of youth, but the
discipline necessary to meet a deadline was very good training, for Swarthmore and for life. I was only a sophomore at
the time, and I think under my editorship the paper

descended to a level of 'sophomoric-ism' that has not been
equaled since. On the other hand, we won a national award
as the best small-college newspaper in the
country, which only goes to show that if
you narrow a sample sufficiently, anything is possible," Rakoff sa

Embracing Swarthmore weather, come snow or sleet
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

When I was in high school in Western
Massachusetts, there was a large contingent of students who insisted on wearing
shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops in the winter, despite the biting cold and constant
snowfall. Their failure to accept reality
seemed odd to me. Why ignore the season?
Why not embrace the chillier months in
all of their frostbite-inducing glory?
Although it is always difficult to stash
away summer clothes in favor of bulky
jackets and gloves, winter can be one of
the most beautiful and fun seasons of the
year. Here are some of my favorite ways
to enjoy Swarthmore in the cold.
The bright and clear winter sky offers
a perfect opportunity for stargazing. If
you don't have access to the astronomy
department's telescopes or even a pair of
binoculars, there is no need to worry.
Plenty can be seen with the naked eye.
The easiest winter constellation to spot is
Orion, "the Hunter." Look to the south (in
the direction of Upper Tarble and

14

Wharton) for four bright stars that represent Orion's limbs and three smaller stars
in a slanted line that make up his belt. A
complete guide to the night sky can be
found at www.astroviewer.com.
Once it starts to snow, it is the perfect
time to revisit childhood pastimes, or if
you grew up in sunnier climates, to enjoy

them for the first time. Purchase a sled or
create your own makeshift contraption by
borrowing a Sharpies tray and sliding
down Parrish Beach. For a more intense
ride, scout out some of the icy hills in the
Crum. Be sure to watch out for the pine
trees, though. Or, ambush your friends
and unwary passers-by with a frigid barrage of snowballs. Start an all-out war and
don't surrender until everyone is sufficiently coated in snow.
Often, the best part of the cold is warming up. Nothing embodies the spirit of
winter like hot chocolate. Forgo the cloying sugary mixture that spurts out from
the Sharpies machine and make your
own. Purchase a bar of dark chocolate
from Essie Mae's or one of the coffee bars
and melt it into a mug of hot milk. Cradle

a cupful as you walk between classes to
keep you warm on that "exhausting trek"
from the Science Center to Kohlherg.

Don't rush to see 'August'
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

"I believe in music the way some people
believe in fairy tales," begins Evan, the 11
year-old orphaned narrator of "August
Rush." Audiences, be alert, for we have been
given fair warning: abandon all cynicism, ye
who enter here. Suspend disbelief, banish
doubt, take incredulity to a dark alley and
thump it on the head so that we may entertain increasingly improbable assumptions as
we tag along with Evan on his journey to find
his parents through the power of music.
We must assume that all musical people of
every breed are metaphysically connected.
(We must ignore the fact that our fathers venerate classical music and discern nothing but
noise from that junk we kids listen to these
days.)
We must assume that two adults of the 21st
Century don'tknow where babies come from.
We must assume that a hospital would
accept papers from a mother signing her
child away for adoption...while the mother
was unconscious.
We must assume that Robin Williams has
a reason for being in this film, although we
cannot say for the life of us what that reason
might be.

But even if an adult audience finds itself

not only willing to suspend, but expel disbelief, take its lunch money and send it to
reform school, this movie would still be bogglingly stupid.
"August Rush" is based loosely on "Oliver
Twist," though the filmmakers leave their
source uncredited, thus worming their way
out of a visit from the Ghost of Charles
Dickens Kicking Their Butt. I'm sure Dickens
is all too happy to let writers Nick Castle,
James Hart and Paul Castro take credit for
this one. (On a side note: three writers! For a

story that's been in the public domain since
1838! The humanity!) My only knowledge of
this story may be based on the Disney version, starring cats, but I can categorically

state that the cats were more convincing.
Alas, instead of cats, we get Jonathan
Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell, with him
doing that attractively brooding thing he
does so well and with her doing that innocently waifish thing Winona Ryder does so
well. He's Louis, a troubled rocker looking
for, well, something unspecified that requires
a lot of brooding; she's Lyla, a chaste classical
cellist under the thumb of her controlling
father. They meet on a rooftop one night in
New York. Some stilted dialogue, a series of
ponderous close-ups and one decorous fadeout later, we get Evan (Freddie Highmore,

November 29, 2007

reduced to a high, breathy monotone by his

American accent).
Newborn Evan is signed away for adoption by Lyla's father while she lies semi-comatose from a car accident in what is apparently the least scrupulous hospital ever. He
grows up unhappily in the Walden County
Home for Boys, the kind of idyllic country
orphanage that hasn't existed since about
1838, and at age 11, he sets out to'find his parents by following the music he hears aIL
around him. Along the way he meets Wizard
(an overacting Williams; think Fagin with
inexplicable piercings), who takes Evan into
his creepy band of child street musicians;
befriends and then be-enemies Arthur (Leon
Thomas III; think the Artful Dodger), whom
Evan displaces as Wizard's favorite; eludes
the search of a kindly adoption official
(Terrence Howard) and generates more sappiness than a coniferous forest.

Dickens himself couldn't have produced
more ham-handed material, and he was not
one known for his subtlety. (I know! I shall
call him the Dodger! And he shall be...
dodgy!) All of the main characters seem to
come from Mars, so caught up are they in
their little dream worlds that mundane
things like traffic and telephones seem
incomprehensible.
Director
Kirsten
Sheridan's cinematographic choices are

equally stultifying. Close-up of boy looking at
girl. Close-up of girl looking at boy. Close-up
of boy looking at girl looking at boy. Cut to
film reviewer vomiting into her popcorn.
Decorous fade-out. Eventually, I started to
jazz things up a bit by mentally editing the
endlessly repetitive shots of girl/boy/kid
walking into the distance by adding a bus
sideswiping them just as they turned to look
soulfully back at the camera. I sorely missed
the cats.
Heavy-handed Dickens may have been,
but at least his novels were pointed and relevant. It's a shame that "August Rush" missed
the real modern Dickens' story in its search
for a cozy, untroubled fantasy. How about
making an "Oliver Twist" update about a
black (or Latino, or really anything except
white, healthy and cute) musical prodigy
caught up in the nightmarish foster-care system of New York? In "August Rush," the
worst thing about the orphanage is that the
older boys tease Evan. Big deal. Oliver is
alive and well on the streets of New York
today, and he doesn't look like the rosycheeked Highmore, and no kindly adoption
official like Howard is looking for him.
Dickens would have had something to say
about that; it's clear that Castle, Hart, Castro
and Sheridan have got nothing.

If you happen to walk by Sharpies Room 4 on a
Saturday at 6 p.m., you're likely to witness the weekly
meeting of the Lady Philosophers.
Started two semesters ago by Ronni Sadovsky 'OB, the
Lady Philosophers club provides a forum for female philosophy students to discuss their experiences in the discipline, described by Sadovsky as an area of academia that
has been historically "male-dominated and often doesn't
know it." She added that it is only recently that the discipline as a whole has started to recognize the gender imbalance that plagues it. The Lady Philosophers' weekly meetings give female philosophers a chance to share experiences from class (and from the discipline in general) in a
supportive setting.
Contrary to what many people think, the Lady
Philosophers' meetings are not forums to have intense
philosophical debates or discuss contemporary hot-button
issues.
Instead, Sadovsky described the gatherings as "something like a support group; a place where girls can get to
know other women in the philosophy department."
Sadovsky started the group because she did not know
many other female philosophers and was often in classes
that were predominantly male. She started searching on
Facebook for other Swarthmore women whose profiles
indicated an interest in philosophy and asking professors
about the female students in their philosophy classes. One
such student, Sophie Horowitz 'OB, noticed the same problems that Sadovsky did. "There are certain problems with
classroom dynamics that crop up in philosophy classes,
and which also seem to make girls particularly uncomfortable," said Horowitz.
The meetings started out as free discussions on whatever topics the women at the particular meeting wanted to
talk about, becoming a little more structured as the dinners grew in size. Now, Sadovsky sends out questions and

conversation topics in advance via e-mail so that the group
can continue interesting threads from the previous weeks
and be sure to address topics of particular interest to the
group. The free-form spirit still continues, however, and
the meetings are still open to any girl interested in attending, even those who have never taken a philosophy class:
This kind of openness is very important to Sadovsky and
to the group as a whole. Sadovsky encourages anyone who
is interested to stop by and discuss their experiences in
philosophy or to talk about ways to be more assertive or
more easily heard in class.

"There are certain problems with
classroom dynamics that crop up in
philosophy classes, and which also
seem to make girls particularly

uncomfortable."
Sophie Horowitz 'OB
Lady Philosophers member
One topic that's very important to the Lady
Philosophers is the idea of collaboration in the classroom
setting. Sadovsky said that, "philosophy can be a very combative discipline, which creates a problem because searching for truth should be a collaborative experience." The
Lady Philosophers encourage each other to stand up for
other people in class and to be sure to voice agreement if
they like what someone is saying in an attempt to lessen
this combativeness.
The Lady Philosophers also discuss topics beyond the
discipline of philosophy; there is a lot of discussion of academia as a whole and what the future holds for philosophy
majors and particularly for women who want to go into

academia. The next step

also open the door to collaborations with other generally
underrepresented groups in the philosophy department,
such as students of color or queer students. Sadovsky,
Horowitz and the rest of the Lady Philosophers want to
give everyone involved in philosophy the chance to discuss these issues. After all, open discussion is what philosophy is

all about.

Film Society screens re-released gem 'Killer of Sheep'
BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

For the past year, various film webzines
and blogs seem to have been all abuzz about
the theatrical and DVD release of "Killer of
Sheep", a film that was made in 1977 for just
$lO,OOO over a series of weekends as the masters thesis of then ifCLA film school student
Charles Burnett, but has since garnered all
kinds of accolades, like the Critics' Award at
the Berlin Film Festival. The sudden attention to a film, that I had never heard of, got
me curious: How is it that a film declared a
"national treasure" by the Library of
Congress has not seen proper distribution
for 30 years
As it turns out, Burnett had adorned his
film with various pieces of music, whose
rights he had not attained. The film was
finally released in a limited number of theaters on March 30 this year in a restored
Television
35mm print by the UCLA Film
Archive and fully licensed musical score. It
was only on Nov. 13 that the film was
released on DVD.
Having seen "Killer of Sheep" on Nov. 17
at the Film Society screening, I was left even
more curious. Was this meandering, unassuming film the same one that critics had
been raving about? That was listed as one of
the National Society of Film Critics' 100
Essential Films? "Killer of Sheep," which
focuses on an African-American couple liv?

&

ing in the Watts district ofLos Angeles, proceeds as a series of largely uneventful, unrelated episodes. Some have likened Burnett's
fly-on-the-wall mode of filmmaking to
French New Wave and Italian neorealism,
and "Killer of Sheep" certainly benefits from

the same lack of conventional entertaining
cues of those films. The reason why "Killer
of Sheep" has, as many critics have noted,

16

aged well in comparison to its contemporaries is because the film doesn't really cater
to any particular formula and extracting a
message from the film is pretty damn hard.
An argument could be made that "Killer
of Sheep" is a social commentary on where
the black community had been left in our
country's urban sprawl after the Civil
Rights Movement. A scene where children
play in a junkyard with the only toys that
they can get' their hands on, like a tire,
unfolds against the patriotic song "The
House that I Live In", which sings, "What is
America to me?
All races, all religions,
that's America to me." The satirical intention is blaring, but this is one of the few
moments that seems charged with a palpable rage.
Burnett doesn't preach, and his purview
of a community left behind, if depressing,
also documents his characters' everyday
tasks with an undeniable love. Racial conflict is barely touched; hardly any white people can be seen in the film. There is one
prominent white character, and she is a corpulent convenience store owner, who both
condescendingly manhandles her black
employee and flirts with Stan, our film's protagonist. Having come in the wake of the
blaxploitation film, "Killer of Sheep" must
have been an admirable feat of restraint.
"Killer of Sheep" spends a large amount
of its running time following the idyllic playtime of its children. A group of rowdy boys
have a rock-throwing battle and play along
train tracks. Two girls humiliate a smaller
boy and push him off his bike. In one harrowing scene, three boys board a bike and,
chased by dogs, almost get hit by a car. The

image of kids leaping between two building
tops would be incredibly poetic if it weren't
so incredibly scary. These sequences are
contrasted with moments like the film's

introduction, where a boy is scolded for getting his brother hurt. "You're a man now,"
the father says, and we see his frustration
and his anxiety over making his son understand what a harsh and unfairworld he lives
in. Dinah Washington's "This Bitter Earth"
plays repeatedly throughout the film.
Of course, prominent in the film are

issues of class. The film screening may as
well have been a Class Awareness Month
event. When one of Stan's friends tells him,
"Now you think you're middle class," Stan
retorts, "Man, I ain't poor. Look, I give
things away to the salvation army. You can't

call yourself poor."

I think Dave
Eggers'

heart

bleeds. I remember being a fan of
Perot, too, back in
'96, because no one
else gave a damn about him and he seemed like the sort
of guy who deserved some attention. We all kinda need
attention, in that sick way that we're all horribly
obsessed with ourselves
which is justified. I mean, as
Eggers says, "If you're not obsessed with yourself, you're
probably boring."
While reading "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius," I began to see what they meant about books hitting close to home; this one struck under my front porch.
It struck from all sides really. First, it hit the aspiring,
young, illustrious facade, then my patio of victimization,
Ijagainst my "being chosen" rooftop, within the crawlspace of familial degeneration, down to the foundation
bricks of terminal illness. All of Eggers' themes are helpfully outlined in his hyper-self-conscious prologue,
which he urges you not to read.
I'm not sure about this post-modernist tendency to be
critically self-conscious, actually writing about the making of a book and the considerations that go into production like, "I arrived at the lake with a notebook and tape
recorder." or having characters say things to other characters like, "You're being out of character." Why, I wonder. It's not as effective as narration on its own.
It's what makes the book daring, though
not his
subject matter, but his games with form, the narrative
style, his propensity to include actual discussion of the
book within the book itself. For me, I'm much more
taken by literature that refuses to acknowledge itself and
goes the proper length to let you forget it's a book at all.
Like Kerouac. Kerouac's got literary game.
But Dave Eggers' work is poignant. A Pulitzer Prize
finalist, he capitalizes on what's become lost to modernity: wit. He is hilarious, actually, in describing his little
brother Toph's tricks at Frisbee, or his conversations
with his melodramatic, pseudo-suicidal friend John. It's
been a while since I have laughed aloud while reading;
probably because I am suffering the disenchantment of
growing up. Either way, "A Heartbreaking Work" is a
charming work that chides while tearing your heart
apart.

I usually latch on to an image, early in novels, later
for poetry, that characterizes the book in my memory
from then onward. In "A Heartbreaking Work", it was a

"gut-wrenching description of the Eggers' mother's cancer, which almost made me vomit, an image to never forget: "When she went in again, and they had 'opened her
up'
a phrase they had used and had looked inside, it
was staring out at them, at the doctors, like a thousand
writhing works under a rock, swarming, shimmering,
wet and oily
or maybe not like worms
Good God!
but like a million little podules, each a tiny city of cancer, each with an unruly, sprawling, environmentally
careless citizenry with no zoning laws whatsoever. When
the doctor opened her up, and there was suddenly light
thrown upon the world of cancer-podules, they were
annoyed by the disturbance, and defiant. Turn off. The
fucking. Light."
They burn, images like these, for all those of us who
have seen cancer, who have watched it corrode through
the human spirit. Go on, Swatties, it's about time. Find
the cure.

moment of mortification. Well, no more. According to Florence Kane in
the October issue of Vogue, the search for originality is
over. And not because everyone is retreating into classic
cuts: on the contrary, Kane's headline informs us that
"with the latest best dresses, übiquity beats anonymity."
Not only were Olivia Chantecaille, Katie Holmes and
Princess Caroline of Monaco all photographed in the
same square-necked, striped Chanel minidress; they're to
be proud of it.
The Chanel "it-dress" wasn't the first. Kane traces the
trend from Phillip Lim's not-so-subtle rosette T-shirt
dress and Tracy Feith's jewel-toned smocks to a little
leopard print DKNY number that reigned omnipresent
this time last year. Suddenly, it's neither embarrassing
nor threatening to be another woman's fashion doppelganger; on the contrary, it's become just one more sign
you've got your finger on the pulse.
What happened to the creative pressure to be one-of-a-

kind? Five years ago, fashion magazines were touting
vintage as the ultimate solution to ensure originality;
now, singularity has been trumped by übiquity. Women,
according to Kane, are realizing that the dress, like any
accessory, is "just one element in their entire look; it's
about the overall picture and how you use the dress to
make that picture." Is the übiquitous dress evidence that
November 29, 2007

women no longer fall prey to the tyranny of designer
integrity? If the Chanel dress is just one element in your
ensemble, then there is no need to honor the designer's
original intentions; dress it up, dress it down, alter it and
wear a brooch the sky, allegedly, is the limit. The thing
is, if Vogue's photo-spread is to be believed, this isn't happening. Sure, Chantecaille wore the dress with leggings,
while Holmes and the Princess went bare-legged, but I'm
not willing to call black tights a personal stamp.
On the contrary, the trend towards uniformity seems
to drain the fashion pages and the New York City transit system
of personality. "It's ironic," said Phillip
Lim, auteur of the rosette it-dress, "there are so many different choices now, and yet people are choosing the same
thing." It may be true that there are more choices now
than ever before, but it's also true that most of us are
buying off-the-rack, mass marketed merchandise: clearly
someone else is wearing exactly the same dress we are if
it came from the mall. Anything short of couture is not,
and has never been, one of a kind. Why pretend?
The it-dress, however, rarely recedes into the background of an outfit. The days of boho chic and mismatched layering are, for everyone except Mary Kate
Olsen, more or less over. I'm not sure I agree with Kane:
whether it's the Feith dress on Christy Turlington, Aerin
and Jane Lauder and Naomi Watts or the Chanel dress on
Chantecaille, Holmes and Princess Caroline, the ensemble revolved around one very identifiablelittle number.
The girl rarely seems to be wearing Chanel; in these days
of übiquity, Chanel seems to be wearing the girl. These
"it-dresses" are more about personal branding than personal style, unless the personal style is synonymous with
the name of said fashion-house. Is the übiquitous dress
evidence that personal style is less about choosing individual fashion pieces to create a signature "look" than it
is about aligning oneself with a brand image?
Lim blames contemporary political currents, wondering if the move toward uniformity is "because it's a time
when there's a lot of [political] uncertainty? And people
are gravitating toward the same thing?" Could it be that
women today feel "safer," as Lim suggests, united behind
the shield of Chanel than they do striking out on their
own? If the übiquitous dress is a coat of arms, then perhaps all Hillary Clinton needs to prove herself leader of
the pack is a little square-necked number

Later McCabe hours not a smart choice
Recently, certain students
have asked the administration and McCabe Library to
consider keeping the library
open to students for addition-

al hours on school nights.

in McCabe until the last closing buzzer rings are ecstatic

about

We Need to Talk

ed library would not necessarily be an improvement for
students. While there are def-

initely several benefits for
some students who spend
many late hours in the library, it's important that the drawbacks are not ignored.
Having McCabe opened for extra late night hours is great
for students who like to have somewhere around 750,000 volumes available to write their papers, theses, or research
projects, and who typically work late into the night. Extra
hours obviously mean more time allowed for students to
work late in McCabe, using the numerous resources made
available to them that they can't find anywhere else on campus.
The space in McCabe is great for both individual and
group work. There are quiet areas available for students
who work best without distractions. The lounge on the main
floor provides a comfortable space for students to talk and
relax, as well as work with other students for group projects.
This provides a more desirable work situation than a group
trying to get together in a dorm room to do work, where
space and resources are limited.
If McCabe were open until two or three in the morning,
students wouldn't have to worry about their homework
being interrupted by McCabe closing or those hideous
buzzers until later, giving students who work late into the
night a space to finish their work before heading back to
their dorm rooms. For students whose roommates sleep
early or those who live in Willets and need a more peaceful
study environment to work efficiently, a late-night library
offers them the perfect solution.
But despite the advantages that later McCabe hours
would offer, there are also considerable disadvantages. Most
students generally work more efficiently and are less likely
to procrastinate when they know they have a limited
amount of time to complete it. McCabe staying open later
would only give Swatties an excuse to loiter in the library

longer and return to their dorms later, causing them to
spend more of their time in McCabe and less time sleeping.
For students who need books available to them for research
papers, they can use their student library cards to check out
as many books as they want and take them to another study

space or their rooms. Bringing a book bag, checking books
out, and taking them home with you isn't all that difficult.
Andfor those who find they needed to check out more books
than they expected, the librarians often have a small supply
of plastic bags for students to carry their heavy load of

books.
With longer McCabe hours, the late night librarians and
student workers would either have to work later hours, stayNovember 29, 2007

ing until after 2 or 3 a.m., or the library would have to hire
more staff. As a courtesy to the staff, a handful of students
shouldn't demand an unnecessary service and force library
workers to stay even later than they already do. Also, by
paying the librarians or hiring more staff for the longer
hours, the college will be spending more money to cover the
costs of salary. Further costs would include payments for the
additional utilities used during the extra hours such as
water, electricity, and even the extra Rice Krispies treats
and assorted snacks that the library provides for students
who study late in McCabe. The college could use this money
to do anything else, so why should they spend all this extxmtt
money on a service of convenience for a few McCabe
addicts?
Later McCabe hours would only be truly necessary if
there were no other available study spaces for students after
1 a.m. But this is not the case. Students can find quiet spaces
to study throughout campus, such as dorm lounges, Parrish
Parlors, and academic buildings that are open 24 hours a
day, such as the Science Center. The Science Center has
vending machines, comfortable couches and chairs, wireless
Internet, and various quiet spaces for studying. Having to
walk the extra three minutes to the Science Center from
McCabe to do work at night is not the end of the world. If it's
the lack of security walking around that part of campus late
at night that bothers you, then studying in your dorm or,
starting work earlier is always an option. You will finish
your work sooner, and will be able to spend your time doing
something besides readings and problem sets, like bonding
with your roommate, showering, or even sleeping.
The college is not insensitive to students' rigorous workloads or excessive study needs. They know how hard you
work, considering it's one of the reasons you are here in the

first place. The college accommodates students with later

McCabe hours during reading week and finals at the end of
each semester, the times when many students need extra
work hours the most.
McCabe is my study space of choice. The librarians are
enthusiastic and helpful, the lounge offers a place to see the
friendly faces of my fellow work-afflicted peers, the library
enforces quiet work environments in the basement and
upper levels, and I have an entire building ofresearch materials for work right at my fingertips. But despite my love for
McCabe, I do not want to spend any more time there than I
already do. McCabe is always looking for ways to improve
itself for students, so if a sufficient number of Swatties want
a space in McCabe for later hours, then the college should
try to accommodate them. Instead of demanding extra
hours, a trial run of McCabe staying open later is a more reasonable way to see if this change would be worth all the

extra work for the majority of the students. If enough
Swatties make use of the space, then McCabe staying open
longer makes sense. What doesn't make sense is students
staying later and wasting the time by merely hanging out,
sleeping, playing Tetris on their computer, etc. If a trial
works out, then students have a safe, comfortable center to
do their work late at night. But if it doesn't, it's not the end
of the world. McCabe is already open for 16.5 hours of the
day. If that's not enough time to get work done, then the
problem is study habits, and an extra hour or two is not
going to help.

Stop stealing

Rise of hate crimes indicative of larger problems
Who
quantifies

hate?

It has become almost second nature to us:
leaving laptops unattended in McCabe, dropping backpacks off outside the doors of Essie
Mae's, even purposely not locking our dorm

room doors. Blame it on the Swarthmore "bubble," but we seem to have forgotten what the
consequences of these negligent actions can be.
But with on-campus thefts on the rise, it seems
as though recent events should serve as a
wake-up call reminding us that there is an
increasing need to unlearn these habits and
also actively work on other preventative measures.
This isn't to say, of course, that this is the
first year thatthefts have happened on campus.
Just last year, the school found itselfconcerned
with intruders stealing from Parrish Hall
dorms and even installed surveillance cameras
in both McCabe Library and Sharpies Dining
Hall. But the incidents this year have become
more frequent and, in some cases, more personal with thefts from purportedly locked dorm
rooms. Some have even been downright disturbing, like the attempted theft of sound

we're more hateful: in 2006, 7,722 hate
crimes were reported to the bureau by
local law enforcement agencies nationwide. That's an 8 percent increase from
2005, and it represents the steady increase
in hate crimes since the bureau's first official report in 1990. Really, since participation in the report is voluntary and most

hate crimes go unreported, the actual

and the successful burglary of a computer monitor from McCabe. And with no conclusive evidence of who (if it even is only one person or a
group of persons) is behind these robberies, it
seems as though the most we can do is protect
ourselves as best we can.
Of course on the part of the students, this
means taking to heart the warnings we've been
about leaving our personal items unattended and being as vigilant as possible, in
terms of reporting suspicious behavior in public buildings and watching out for propped
dorm doors.
Yet, while there are quite a few steps that
can be taken by students on a personal level,
there are still many bigger precautions that
should be considered by the administration.
For one, the debate about whether or not residence halls should be equipped with card-key
entries has been ongoing for quite a while.
Although cost seems to be a big issue, the relative success of the keypad entry systems to the
residential halls of Parrish in preventing
intruder-related incidents in that dorm seem to
validate the effectiveness of such systems.
Additionally, it'd be much easier to prevent the
unauthorized use of stolen card-keys than it
currently is to change locks to prevent the use
of lost or stolen traditional keys. On another
note, it is of concern that the expensive surveillance systems recently installed in some of
the college's major buildings do not seem to be
effective in providing leads to facilitate the
identification of those responsible for the

recent thefts.

While the recent incidents are in no way
solely the fault of the students or the administration here at Swarthmore, we hope that we
can work together to mitigate this problem.

Most hate crimes take
place near residences or
homes, but a sizable
number take place at
universities and colleges.
The common reaction to reports like
these is to call for more legislation against
hate crimes, but it shouldn't be the government's responsibility to fight hatred.
Consider that the highest percentages of
the hate crimes were labeled "intimidation" or "simple assault." There are murderous hate crimes, which shouldn't be
forgotten, but these are the exceptions;
generally, that is, hate crimes take the
form of hate speech. That hate speech carries its own violence is incontrovertible,
and yet the non-tangible nature of the
crime makes it harder to legislate and officially define as violence. Legislating
against hate crimes is necessary, but it is
more necessarily symbolic than effective
as social activism (some take this argument too far by suggesting it isn't that hate
crimes are increasing but that the government is liberally expanding the definition
of what constitutes a crime
to which
you can ask whether a person exists if
their parents never name them). Further,
the fact is that awareness-raising
whether it is on the part of the media or
within liberal college communities
is
also insufficient because of its institutional character.

As has been the norm, more than half
of the crimes reported were racially motivated; more than 60 percent of these
crimes were anti-black. If the Jena 6 have
been relegated to the back pages, the nearly 60 imitative incidents involving nooses
since the protests in September seem
insistent on proclaiming the hatefulness
living happily in the hearts of too many
Americans. It is true that the percentage of
crimes committed against blacks in 2006
did not represent an increase from the previous year, but that's the kind of fact that
should only interest the most academic of

academics.

More important is the unverifiable
sense that hate crimes against blacks are
getting more violent. The imitativeness of
the crimes following the protests in
September suggests some woken and
newly hungry virus; the image of the
noose is straight-up chilling, almost disturbingly anachronistic. Of course, it's

entirely possible that the sudden proliferation of nooses represents the potentially
positive result of increased media cover-

age. And yet, the fact that the number of
hate groups has increased 40 percent since
2006 suggests that even if it is the case that
media have increased their coverage of
hate crimes, they are not doing so inspired

by a conviction for social change so much
as they are simply responding to a resurgent demand for hatred.
Most of us, I think, could cynically predict the groups that did experience an

L
But
do you consider quantity or rate
of increase? After all, there were four
times as many crimes reported against

Hispanics as there were Muslims
Similarly, while it is true that religiously
motivated crimes increased 19 percent
while racially motivated crimes basically
maintained the same percentage, there are
still many more crimes against Hispanic
and blacks than there against Muslims,
Jews and Catholics. This could suggest
that those quick to claim that religion is
the country's most threateningly divisive
issue are misleading their audiences
the deeper, more consistent problem is
racial, specifically with regards to our
individual attitudes towards immigrants

and black Americans.

From another angle, though, the drastic 19 percent increase in religiously moti-

vated crimes can be considered alongside
the 18 percent increase in crimes that
resulted from sexual-orientation bias. In
all other regards, it is absurd to compare a
religious group with a community defined
by its sexual orientation; it's essential to
treat hate crimes specifically, e.g., as
crimes against Hispanics and crimes
against the queer community, rather than
as hate crimes in general. At the same
time, however, it might be more productive to consider the rise in hate crimes
generally, as indicative of a particular psy-

chological attitude towards the increasing
number of types of They that seem to
threaten mythical American unity. In

other words, hatred towards Muslims is
not solely the result of xenophobic government propaganda, just as hatred towards
the queer community is not solely the
result of the teaching of the religious right;
rather, something about being American
today induces a particular fear of anyone
at all unlike you. And even no, especially if the source of this paranoia is, in fact,
abstract, then it's misguided to seek remedy in institutions rather than through
individuals. The change has to happen on
an informal interpersonal level.

It's essential to treat hate
crimes specifically rather
than as hate crimes in
general.
Most hate crimes take place near residences or homes, but a sizable number
take place at universities and colleges. Too
many of the noose incidents occurred on
college campuses. This is confounding,
since the movements to subvert mainstream discourses are usually started on,
and often restricted to, college campuses.
But it might also point to the fact that students can be the most hateful citizens

perhaps, paradoxically, since we're most

full of life. This is my last column for The
Phoenix and I wish that I had written

more about this issue, because it has to do
directly with us and because it actually
matters to me (it turns out that columnwriting threatens the heart-brain connection). I think it is our greatest responsibility to use the attention we receive to individually mess with the seemingly innocent daily discourses that clearly containing primitive racisms. If we're about
changing people, that is, then we have to
change the way we talk about one another.

Meet the Student Council candidates for 2008
CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY
LIANA KATZ'IO

My reasons for running for Student
Council Secretary are twofold. First and
foremost, I care about Swarthmore.
During my one and a half years here,
Student Council has taken many positive
steps to improve student life. I would like
to become more involved in these
changes in order to guarantee that students' voices are always heard.
Second, as Secretary, I will finally be
able to put my perfectionism to good use!
According to the Student Council constitution, the function of the secretary is to
"ensure that important documentation

20

pertaining to Student Council is
archived," posting minutes and keeping
track of the budget. In order to be an
effective secretary, one must be highly
organized and attentive at all times. As a
Latin major, I have come to love subtleties and details. Studying a language
in which a small line can change the
meaning of

a word has made me

extremely thorough and focused. If I am
elected as Secretary, I will bring these
detail-oriented strengths to Student

Council.

Although I have no previous experience on Student Council, I am no

stranger to

active participation at

Swarthmore. I have already taken an
active role in campus life in many different ways. As co-president of Ruach, I am
responsible for providing strong leadership under which an entire organization

can flourish. As a reporter for The
Phoenix, I have learned the importance
of working efficiently, keeping deadlines
in mind. I will utilize these skills to make
sure that my duties as Secretary are executed in a competent manner.
I am not looking to radicalize or revolutionize Student Council. I simply want
to bring all of my skills and strengths in
order to help Student Council run effectively and smoothly.

there.
However, the arguments of those people do not take into
account that the latest financial crisis is
similar in many
respects to the crises

of the past. The summer financial crisis was caused in part by several Wall
Street companies issuing risky assets that they rated as not
that risky.
A financial crisis ensued in the U.S. as a result of the disparity between the published and the actual risk. Some say
that the crisis demonstrates, among other things, that the
amount of innovation in the financial industry seems to be
on the decline. They say that for us college students this

means that Wall Street will offer fewer career opportunities
than those that were available to those who graduated
before us in recent years. However, we have little reason to
fear this, even if we will graduate as soon as next June.
Some stress the negative effects of the summer crisis.
They cite that the crisis created about $4OO billion in losses
overall in the economy. However, the losses represent only
a small proportion of the overall economy, which is more

They stress that credit rating companies clearly underestimated the amount of risk that these securities entailed.
Then, they conclude that the crisis deeply undermined the
credibility of many financial companies.
However, those that assert that the crisis will negatively
affect Wall Street in the long term tend to overlook the fact
that mortgage-backed securities (the ones entailed in the
crisis) represent only a tiny fraction of financial assets, and
cannot in themselves account for recent declines in the market. Rather, this is a crisis in confidence.
This will likely become clear far sooner than most people realize, and the market will put its current woes behind

this say that there is a limit to how much wealth can be preserved through the diversification of risks. According to
this logic, without further financial innovation, the industry becomes increasingly stagnant and potential for creativity diminishes.
However, this argument does not have broad supporting
evidence. One can find many crises in the annals of investing. Since the Great Depression, there have been many economic downfalls
including a recession in 1987. There was
also the Enron scandal in 2001 and many others over the
years. None of them left a substantial negative legacy for
their industry as a whole. Thus there is no reason to expect
that the summer financial crisis will hinder the financial
sector in the long run.
Finally, some conclude that there will be fewer jobs on
the Wall Street in the future. They say that if the industry
will not expand as much in future years as it has in the past,
then opportunities for jobs will not grow by as much.

However, since there is little evidence that the detrimental effect on the financial sector will last for much

Attack on 'hypocritical' letters unfounded, offensive
To the Editor:
There was one column by Jeremy
Freeman regarding two sets of letters in
the Nov. 15 issue of The Phoenix. His discussion of the first set was an instance of
bloated self-congratulation, and it carried
the putrid aroma that arises whenever a

building since the beginning of their time

could not have been identified as such
without some belief in the unknown. In
other words, perhaps there is no objective
knowledge.

superiority complex and perceived intellec-

tualism intertwine.
In the first section of his opinion piece,
Freeman fails to see the point of two letters
to the editor written in response to a column exploring the relationship between
the subjective and objective elements of
faith. From my perspective, Alicia de los
Reyes's letter sought to address the
assumption that those of a fundamentalist
religious vein never individually question
their beliefs. And instead of citing scientific evidence that contradicts passages in the
Bible as sources for her internal conflict,
she implicitly draws upon personal experiences that caused her to first doubt, and to
next self-renew.

In his attempt to call out
the hypocrisy that he
perceived in the written
opinion pieces of others,
Freeman underscored his
own inherent hypocrisy.
From my perspective, Jeff Weaver and
Mi Zheng attempt to argue that a spiritually-based framework for examining empirical evidence is not only appropriate, but
fundamental in continuing to cultivate the

THE PHOENIX

It carried the putrid aroma
that arises whenever a
superiority complex and
perceived intellectualism
intertwine.
But I'm not here to argue semantics.
I'm here to say that in his attempt to call

out the hypocrisy that he perceived in the
written opinion pieces of others, Mr.

Freeman underscored his own inherent

hypocrisy. The stork analogy that he made
in his piece was disrespectful and unprofessional. Conflating belief in a god with
belief in something like Santa Claus or the
Easter Bunny reflects not only insensitivity and intolerance, but an intellectual laziness
a complacency and satisfaction
with relying on old, banner, blanket beliefs
with no justification for why he chooses to
side or believe in the manner that he does.
His obvious contempt for those attempting
(however weakly) to bring a real, multilateral discussion of religion and its place in
society to the Swarthmore table is most
unfortunate. And this reader is surprised
that his under-researched and overtly personal opinion piece passed muster with

The Phoenix's editorial board.

Olivia Toro 'O5

To the Editor:

In last week's Phoenix, Jeremy

Freeman ("Hypocritical Letters") wrote
the following: "There were four Letters
to the Editor in the Nov. 8 issue of The
Phoenix. Each was an instance of tiresome self-righteousness, and each carried the rank stench that arises whenever hypocrisy and poor argument intertwine." His assessment is false.
The letters ofAlicia de los Reyes, and

Jeff Weaver and Mi Zheng relate to
whether fundamentalist faith entails any
sort of questioning before acceptance.

Boil them down, and the letters simply
say: "Hey, we do question our beliefs, and
we think there is proof!" We can argue
about tone, but it is very hard to apply
the labels "self-righteous" and "hypocritical" to the letters.

I appreciate the
necessity of forgiveness
even when [it] is
unasked and
undeserved.
-

Mr. Freeman is correct in pointing
out that no concrete proof for
Christianity was presented, but that was
because the authors were not presenting
a defense or explanation of their faith.
Their purpose was simply to say that
Christians do wrestle with issues of faith

and belief.
Should he be interested, I wouldrefer
Mr. Freeman to the rich history of
Christian apologeies from St. Augustine

November 29, 2007

to C.S. Lewis. The second two letters
were in reference to a parody article
being offensive. Mr. Freeman's argument
is essentially as follows: "Mr. Cohen and
Ms. Marrazza once wrote and published
something offensive, so they can not
protest anything offensive published
now." By the same logic, a thief, having
once stolen, cannot ever say that stealing

is wrong without being a hypocrite.

People do offensive,
stupid, foolish, even
criminal things.
There seems to be blame enough to
spread around. Perhaps Mr. Cohen and
Ms. Marrazza unwisely wrote and published something. Perhaps Mr. Peters
and Mr. Decker also unwisely published
something. Perhaps Mr. Freeman was
mistaken in his assessment of the four
letters. Perhaps Ms. de los Reyes, Mr.
Weaver, and Ms. Zheng could have provided an example of their proof of faith.
People do offensive, stupid, foolish,
even criminal things. We should oppose

these things. Yet as a fundamentalist
Christian and a recipient of unprecedented forgiveness myself, I appreciate
the necessity of forgiveness even when
forgiveness is unasked and undeserved.
I invite all the aggrieved parties
involved to forgive: leave the personal
attacks and continue discussion on more
amicable terms. We are all adults. Let us
rise above pettiness and interact with
respect, honor and character.

CANDIDATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT
ROMANS PAD110
Many of my past experiences at the college will enable
me to effectively perform the duties of Vice President. I
have an ability to work well with others, yet voicing my
opinion when needed.
One of the major reasons why I should be elected to student council is the fact that I can communicate very well
with other people. In the case of the Board, I am not intimidated by communicating the concerns of students with
them. I served on the College Budget Committee with various Board members. My ability to listen has enabled me to
make people comfortable around me and share their concerns with me. Serving on the Executive board of SASS,
being a member of SBC, and being a Lang Center Intern
has allowed me to recognize the importance of working as
a team on a committee. During my time as the Civic and
Political Action Coordinator of SASS, I worked closely with
the administration to put on a successful rally.
Whether one approves or disapproves of the council at
this time, no one can dispute the fact that at this point in
time, Student Council is at a major turning point in that
people are paying attention to what the council is doing.
While I have a number of things I am committed to, like
actively pushing the idea of “Thanksgiving in the Spring”
and extending the hours of Sharpies and Tarble, many of
my goals are more long term:
One of the jobs of Vice President is to serve on the
College Planning Committee for 2025. With that being said,
it is important to have a Vice President on this committee
who can be bold in terms of providing feedback on what

>

students think of certain aspects of the school. While on
this committee, for example, I plan to talk about the colaaipge’s diversity in the future. By diversity, I mean the variety of classes we offer here, student diversity, etc. I also
plan to address them on how the college uses its finances.
My other goal is to continue Student Council’s work
with groups like Training for Change, which provided
Student Council with workshops on Anti-Oppression work.
This kind of work will allow Student Council to create a
strong relationship with student cultural groups on campus and to become an ally to them.

I also want to work with the Educational Policy
Representative to expand curriculum options that reflect
the interest of the entire student

body. There have been

suggestions about creating more majors.
My personality is analogous to my upbringing, in that I
am diverse, hard-working, determined and eclectic.
B
Consequently, this allows me to approach issues from
another perspective and enables me to look at issues outside the box. During my time at Swarthmore, I have had
the opportunity to meet many of my peers and listen to
their concerns regarding the direction of the college. If
elected as Vice President, I believe that I will represent the
opinions of the student body successfully.
I ask for your vote to help make this happen. Thank you.

Changes, big

and small, are always afoot at

Swarthmore because students are always awake, sipping
coffee and Thinking About Things . . . What if we could
walk into Worth Health Center, confident in the medical
care? What if the vegetables in Sharpies were fresher? I
often wonder what we can do to make Swarthmore students happier, less pressured, and I have some let’s-do-itright-now kind of ideas about how to make improvements in the short term. As Student Council Vice

President, I would work collaboratively within our community to find some viable answers to these questions
and others that may arise in the next year.
I love Swarthmore, and if elected Vice President, I
would put that love to good use. I want the chance to
make a place I love even better by combining experience

and determination.
I would bring a wide array of experiences and skills to
the office of Vice President. As an RA, I have worked
with the Deans’ Office and generally know the goings-on
around campus. It is my job to talk with students on my
hall and to do what I can, not only right-here-and-now to
make them more content, but also to strategize about
tomorrow. I would like to extend this concrete connection with my hall to the community at large. I know the
resources on campus, and I’m comfortable using them.
For example, I’m in conversation with the health center’s
director, Beth Kotarski, regarding a student-run van
service to Chester Crozer Hospital. I would also like to
begin a dialogue with Linda McDougall about improving
the quality of the produce in Sharpies and Essie Mae’s.
As a campus tour guide, I know the facts and the figures of Swarthmore. But, more importantly. I’m familiar
with how things work here, and I know what questions to
ask. I have personal relationships with Liz Derickson
and Dean Westphal because I’ve taken the time to ask
them about CAPS and Public Safety’s policies. Besides,
I’ve seen the rubber duckies lounging poolside in
President Bloom’s basement spa!
I don’t need to remind you that we Swatties do a lot of
thinking. As Vice President, I’d like to translate some of
those thoughts into action. The other day, my friend was
saying how great it would be if there were just some randomly fun things “Like what if there were suddenly a
band playing in the fragrance garden on Friday afternoon?” that happened here on campus? The administration has actually been thinking of doing something like
this for a while, but I want to make sure it happens. The
Vice President, along with the rest of Student Council,
functions as a voice for the student body, and at this
point the administration wants to listen. Okay, so tell me

that you will be promptly notified of the status of your application.
If your application is selected, your concern will now be in the interview process. I
want to make this as easy and undaunting
as possible. As Appointments Chair, I will be
responsible for setting up a meeting between
you, me, at least two other member of the
appointments committee and possibly with
a member of the committee you are trying to
get on. I will maintain open communication
with you and other members of the appointment committee to schedule an interview
promptly, working with your schedule. I
believe that an interview is not an interrogation, and I would make sure that the meeting would be relaxed, but focused.
I have decided to run as Appointments
Chair, not only because I believe I can do a

CANDIDATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT
SVEN DAVID DDEKWD 09
Hello friends, classmates, and fellow Swarthmoreans.
I have chosen to run for the position of vice president of
Student Council because it is a position of great responsibility that I know I will occupy to your full benefit. In
my time at Swarthmore, I have grown to appreciate more
each semester all the wonderful things that drew me to
this institution. It is hard to find a place where the
administration listens to the students as much as ours
does, and our small size makes any minor issues fixed
with a few meetings, or even just some emails to the
right place. For me, the accessibility of the administration and student leaders is one of the most vital keys to

our success, both as individuals, and as a collective. That

is in essence what I want to keep as the foremost goal of
council, the committees and the administration. The
work has already been started this year, with the current
council increasing transparency of its decision making
process, but as I have learned as a member of student
council, there is always room for change. I am not speaking of massive changes like overhauling the financial aid
system, but changes that allow students to become more
aware of some of the resources open to them, and the

ease of accessing those resources. One thing we did on
council as part of a push for appointments was have a
study break last semester with members from each committee there, and the eagerness they showed to talk
about their committees was admirable. An idea that I
hope to realize, would be to have the non-confidential
committees have one completely open meeting each
semester that students would be encouraged go to and
learn about the functions, for in that way you can see
what it is like to work closely with faculty and administration. By constantly improving the function of school
government with small changes, we could make the flow
of information smoother, and achieve even greater levels
of transparency. Having served as appointments chair
for the past two semesters, I have learned a great deal
about the necessity of small improvements, and the difference they can make on an entire process, like applying to committees. However, there are some larger
issues which council has been tackling that I would seriously look to solving in my two terms, such as the possible creation of a permanent sustainability committee.
Also I would push for the short break in spring, or at
least shed some light on the attempt to implement it. I
would pursue this course, all tbe while maintaining and
expanding the openness council has worked for this
semester. The need for openness has also never been
clearer to me as it is now that I am an RA and have had
freshmen approach me with questions about appointments and other extracurricular issues. Since they are
going to take over our groups and committees one day, I
will make sure they have had the easy opportunities to
hear from those who came before.

good job, but because I believe that I can use
the job to expand student engagement. Let's
face it: most Swatties are not involved with
student government. I have noticed that a

handful of the same students hold a number
of positions
on
committees.
As
Appointments Chair, I want to bring in
more students instead of having the same
half-dozen or so people on several committees. I think we can all agree that the more
people we can get involved the better it will
be.

I recognize that Swatties feel they are
extremely busy and don't have the time to
become more in tune with what student
council is doing. As a member of the council,
I would promote more effective and easier
means of outreach. I want to add an internet
poll to the Dashboard web site that would

allow you to keep tabs on what the Student

Council was doing and provide the council
with feedback. Instead of wasting paper in
giving every student a newsletter (most of
which end up getting recycled), I think the
Student Council should instead post flyers
on Sharpies' tables, bathrooms, and dorms
that people would be more likely to read. If I
am elected, I hope to implement simple ideas
like these to keep you more in touch with
what is going on.
I know I am asking for the vote of students who don't know me. Hopefully my
platform has provided you with a good sense
of who I am and what I intend to do. If you
have any questions, please do not hesitate to
e-mail me (nerskinl@swarthmore.edu) or
approach me on campus. I would love to
chat.

Blogs: the online future of sportswriting

ANDREW QUINTON
Be Aggressive
I'm usually bitter and cynical
anything
involving
about
increased emphasis on the internet, but I get really excited about
the already high and still increasing influence of sports blogs. Like
the academic disciplines, the
THE PHOENIX

sports world has grown far too
complex for any one individual to
be an expert in all areas. Even the
best analysts can only talk about
one or two sports with authority,
and even the most obsessive fans
know little about the actual playing of the games. Watching ESPN
or reading the columns of "mainstream" writers makes this
painfully obvious
attempts to
write about the entirety of just one
league nearly always produce rudimentary, near-useless analysis.
If you're a casual fan and only
want to invest enough time in
sports to read one article a week,
that kind of stuff is great. But if
and
you want more, then blogs
their newsgroup and message
board cousins
are essential.
Good blogs offer one or more of
three things: high-quality original
content, summaries of what else is
out there and the beginnings of discussions.

A blog focused on providing
new analysis can reach levels of
analysis unseen in the traditional
press. While the blog author(s)
may not have the kind of inside
sources of a traditional reporter,
they can use the reporter's news as
a jumping-off point and then go off
in any direction.
Other blogs focus more on linking to other stories already posted
on the Web, with perhaps a paragraph or two of additional analysis. They may not offer more than
a scan of ESPN, Yahoo! Sports,
Rotoworld or the official league
sites
but the time to run such a
search adds up quickly and your
search probably won't be as good
as that of someone who's doing it
for an audience. Other blogs, like
Deadspin (www.deadspin.com),
are full of links to local news stories and obscure YouTube videos
...

that would otherwise be almost

impossible to find.

November 29, 2007

Blogs that do little but provide
links and discussion threads look
the least impressive, but may be
the most important. My favorite
example is Baseball Think Factory
(http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org). BTF has a huge readership
from the days when it featured
more original content, and now
those readers contribute to articles
that are frequently fascinating and
nearly always more informative

than the local beat writer.
Another unrelated, but great
benefit of "blog culture" is that
blogs offer athletes a way to communicate directly with fans. I hesitate to use "unfiltered" to describe
these blogs, since clearly athletes
or the site they write for can apply
all the spin control they want, but
they're still great as windows into
how and what athletes think.
Gilbert Arenas writes about the
new nickname he devised for himself: "I think I got a new name. It's

still Agent Zero, but instead of
Agent Zero with the Hibachi as an
arm, it's Agent Zero having Nacho
as an arm because I'm serving
chips and dip." That's just awesome.

Yes, any blowhard with an
email address can start a blog, and
thousands of words of garbage are
put online every day. And yes, I've
wasted a lot of time reading idiotic
comments on Deadspin, BTF and
other blogs. Over time, though, one
learns where and from whom to
find good reading. What you get is
well worth the effort.
There's still a need for tradi-

tional reporting, and blogs will
probably never replace the human
interest stories one finds in Sports
Illustrated or other magazines. But
for news, analysis and humor,
blogs are the way to go.

Garnet men get off to impressive start
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu
The 2007-2008 men's basketball team is on a mission to
earn respect from around the conference.

After being picked to finish 7th out of the 10 teams in
the Centennial Conference, following a year in which the
team went 8-10 to place 6th in the standings, the Garnet has
jumped out to a 2-1 record this year, winning its first two
games of the season against Oberlin College, 81-62, and
Southwestern University, 78-73.
The first game of the year, which pitted the Garnet
against the Oberlin Yeomen on Nov. 16 at home as part of
the opening round of the annual Swarthmore/Haverfordhosted Equinox Classic, saw Swarthmore start four seniors. Matt Kurman 'OB and lan McCormick 'OB, both of
whom earned All-Centennial honors last season started at
shooting guard and center respectively, while co-captain
Noam Fliegelman 'OB manned the point guard position and
Steve Wolf 'OB, who has ranked among the team leaders in
points and rebounds over the last two seasons, started at
forward: Matt Turner 'lO, the only non-senior to start,

rounded out the lineup as the other forward.
Neither team shot particularly well the first half, with
Swarthmore only shooting 13 for 39 and Oberlin only
going 8 for 24. The worst stat of all, perhaps, was
Swarthmore's dismal free-throw record of one for seven.
Nevertheless, at the end of the half, the score stood
Swarthmore 30, Oberlin 22.
Both teams picked it up in the second half, but
Swarthmore maintained the upper hand. Swarthmore's
second half scoring run was capped off by two huge baskets by Danny Walker 'lO with under two minutes left to
play. With 1:44 left to play, co-captain Chris Nana-Sinkam
'OB fed Walker the ball, and Walker posterized the lone
Oberlin defender with a hard slam dunk. It was Walker's
first college dunk, and it elicited loud cheers from the 400plus fans in the stands.
"I knew I was gonna dunk it," Walker said. "I knew
what I was gonna do the whole way I did it all the time
in high school, but this was the first in college. In college
...

it felt good."
On the very next play, Walker was again fed the ball,
this time outside the perimeter. Still on fire from his dunk,

Walker took aim at the basket and sank a three-pointer.
Walker's two shots to put the final touches on the game
were only part of the story. Predictably, the team's seniorled starting squad was responsible for most of the damage.

12 rebounds, to lead all players in both categories, and
Kurman and Turner each finished with 11 points.
The following day Swarthmore faced off against

Southwestern University, who had defeated Haverford

College in its match the preceding day, for the tournament
championship.
Wolf led all Swarthmore players with 17 points, while
Southwestern's Ben Schleif, in only 16 minutes of playing
time, had 21 points.
Despite being outscored in the second half, 42-39,
Swarthmore held on to the win, 78-73.
The Garnet's first loss of the season came on Nov. 20 to
Arcadia College, in a game that went into overtime.
In the 87-84 losing effort, McCormick picked up his second double-double of the season while scoring a careerhigh 36 points, and notching 12 rebounds. The performance
earned McCormick Centennial Conference Player of the
Week honors. Kurman added 17 points of his own.
Swarthmore players are proud of their 2-1 start, and see
it as a good launching pad for the rest of the season.

"We were 2-0 for the first time in five or six years, so
we're off to a good start," Turner said. He added that the
first few games have been a good chance to iron out any
remaining kinks in the team's play, while building team
chemistry.
Thus far, the team's strengths appear to rest largely in
its core of returning players. "We've got veteran leadership in four seniors who have been in the program for four
years," McCormick said. "We know how each other
play[s]." He added, "We've got a new confidence about us
this year.
Swarthmore traveled to McDaniel College last night for
its first conference competition, a game too late for press
time.
The Garnet will play two signicant Centennial
Conference games this coming week, on Saturday at
Johns Hopkins University, and on Wednesday at
Muhlenberg College, before returning home to face off
against Ursinus College the following Saturday, Dec. 8 at
2 p.m.

Swimmers take down Bears, move on to F&M Invite

Though both men's and women's swim
teams had lopsided victories over Ursinus
College in the pool last Tuesday, 144-97 for
the women and 125-86 for the men, Garnet
swimmers continued to step up and

achieved several lifetime bests.
The meet came at a significant time in
the season, after both squads had suffered

tough losses to New York University, and

was the last tune-up before this weekend's
Franklin and Marshall Invite, the biggest
meet of the season thus far. And while both
teams went into the meet expecting wins,
the Garnet got the bonus of seeing personal
record swims and a pool best in addition to
an extra mark in the "W" column.
"Every competition is an important
competition, whether the other team is

weak or strong," Coach Sue Davis said of

the meet against the Bears. "We had some
very good swims against them."
Standing out in the meet were lifetime
bests for Claire Shelden 10 and Derrick Kao
11 in the 200 freestyle, John Heagy 'OB, Sarah
Bedolfe 11 and Fatima De Vol 11 in the 400
IM, Connor Morrison 11 and Brian Roth 'O9
in the 200 butterfly, and David Dulaney 11 in
the 100 butterfly. Anne Miller 10 continued
to leave her mark on Swarthmore by breaking the pool record in the 50 butterfly in the
first halfof her 100butterfly race.
The swimmers took advantage of the
slight let up in their challenging schedule

to enjoy the competition against the Bears.
"Ursinus usually isn't our most competitive meet but it's nice because we get to
swim some of our off events," Heagy said.
Franny Zhang 'OB agreed. "The Ursinus
meet was fun," she said. "It was a nice
change from the NYU meet."
Amid its sometimes hectic meet schedule, Heagy said that the men's team has
found the time to come together as a squad
and start to fill the holes that the talented
class of 2007 left. "It was tough to begin
with," he said of losing last year's seniors,
"but I think we're starting to really come
together now and we're having some really

November 29, 2007

good swims, and I think the freshmen are
really starting to step up."

Allie Jordan 'O9 said that the same is

true for the women's team. "I think the
excitement is starting to build for our
upcoming events, and I think the girls all
stand by each other," she said, noting that
the team chemistry was an essential part of
the squad's success. "Having your friends
behind the blocks is one of the most amazing feelings in the world."

The Garnet will need everyone, firstyears and upperclassmen alike, to step up
this weekend as the teams travel to their
first multi-session meet of the season at
F&M. At this meet the team will face stiff
competition from both inside and outside
of the Centennial Conference, and they will
get to preview the order of events that they
will compete in at the season's culminating
event,

the

Centennial

Conference

Championships.
"It's the best preparation for the conference meet we do all year," coach Chris Daly
said of the meet. And as such, the coaches
are expecting a top effort from their swimmers. "If they approach it as preparationfor
the conference meet, we would expect that
we would have all good swims," Davis said.
