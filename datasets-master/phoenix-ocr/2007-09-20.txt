Campus decision to kick coke under reconsideration
After a two-and-a-half year campaign to remove CocaCola products from campus resulted in a victory for
Swarthmore's Kick Coke chapter, the college's Board of
Managers is reevaluating the claims of wrong-doing against
the Coca-Cola Company that had played into the college's
decision to drop Coke.
Ruth Schultz 'O9, one of the Kick Coke organizers, said
the group did not expect that the Board would be able to
reconsider the college's move to eliminate Coke products
from campus. "At first we were sort of surprised because we
didn't know that the Board had that kind of authority. Now
we are questioning the role of the Board of Managers to overturn the results from a two-and-a-half year campaign,"
Schultz said.
In an e-mail sent out to various groups on campus publicizing an educational and action meeting hosted by Kick
Coke tonight at 7 p.m. in Kohlberg 115, Schultz referred to
the possible overturning of the Board's decision as "a precedent that would potentially jeopardize other decisions that
the college makes." Schultz urged students to attend, citing
the importance of voicing concerns, "not only about the
issue of Swarthmore's contract with Coca-Cola, but about
the lack of transparency and student voice in College decision-making processes in general."
"We decided to hold the educationaland action [meeting]
after the Daily Gazette article came out last Thursday
because we had a lot of people coming up to us asking *what
is going on with the Board?' and 'what can I do to help?' We

have gotten a lot of positive responses from people that overturning the decision is not the right action to take and want
to do something to voice their concerns. We also want to do
something so that the administration and Board hears this
sentiment from other people besides us," Schultz said in an
e-mail.

Schultz acknowledged that the Board of Managers has
the right to partake in conversations about Coca-Cola's status due to its inherent role in financial decision-making.
However, "if the decision gets overturned, it shows that the
administration doesn't actually have a lot of power when it
comes to these decisions, which will severely limit the
amount of access that students have to the decision-makers,"
Schultz said in an e-mail.
Last spring, the Board of Managers asked Swarthmore
Kick Coke members to conduct further research into the
allegations of Coca-Cola's human rights abuses in Colombia
and India. This request came after the administration decided to completely remove Coke products from college coffee
and snack bars, various vending machines and Sharpies.
"Those managers who have spoken on the subject believe
that too little evidence and investigation has been undertaken and that too much reliance on a single source of information does not reflect the rigor of inquiry standard at the college," Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l said in an e-mail.
The Board of Managers and the college Kick Coke members
are meeting on Sept. 28 to further discuss the future of CocaCola's relationship withthe college. Kick Coke members wiH
be presenting their position to the Board of Managers.
. "[The .Board of Managers is] not at all interested in
attacking°students or tearing down their perspectives and
have to find" and support the balance between educating our
students for social and civic responsibility and keeping the
institution
for future generations," Eldridge said.
Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services Stu
Hain agreed. "The Board is trying to look at the big picture,"
Hain said "I want this process to play out. I've tried to
understand both sides of the argument."
Stocking the college with Pepsi products is considerably
more expensive than purchasing Coca-Cola. According to
Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall, the college
purchased; $14,716 in Coke bulk products in the 2006-07 academic year? "If we have bought the same amount of Pepsi it
c

would have cost $40,553," she said. McDougall also said that
the college participates in a consortium, a sort of buying coop, with Dickinson College, Gettysburg College, Messiah
College, Elizabethtown College, Bryn Mawr College and
Haverford College. When the college sent a request for pricing to Pepsi and Coke, it became apparent thatPepsi was the
more costly option. "If Swarthmore continues to use Pepsi,
then future contracts for the remaining schools may be compromised and will most likely decrease their buying power,"
McDougall said.
At Smith College, a soft drink advisory committee of students, faculty and administrative members was created to
investigate the allegations against Coca-Cola to determine
the validity of these claims. Emma Roderick, who graduated
in 2007 from Smith College, was heavily involved in Smith's
Kick Coke Off Campus campaign. Roderick said that from

her interactions with Coca-Cola she discovered that "[CocaCola] like[s] their bottlers to have local autonomy. They said
they can't do anything unless the bottling plant wasn't making enough money." Roderick also said that the Coca-Cola
Company itself has been the real reason why there has not
been an investigation of the purported human rights abuses.
"It was absurd. It's not like [Coca-Cola] denied any of it,"
Roderick said.
In the spring of 2007, the president of Smith College sent
a letter to Coca-Cola informing the company of Smith's decision to absolve its 50-year relationship with the soda company. Smith College is now a Coke-free campus. "It's really fun
to see all the non-Coke machines on campus," Roderick said
of the change.
Ray Rogers, director of the Campaign to Stop Killer Coke,
contacted The Phoenix after reading a Daily Gazette article
on the developments at Swarthmore. Rogers, who participated in Smith's campaign, came to Swarthmore once in
2004 to speak to a class, and again in 2005 for a forum.

Iraqi journalist Nuri begins work with WNR
BY MARIA KHIM
mkhiml@swarthmore.edu
Ayub

Nuri, a well-known Iraqi journalist

who has extensive radio broadcasting experience and has been published in newspapers from The New York Times to The
Washington Post, is now War News Radio's
new journalist-in-residence. As a highly
knowledgeable and experienced journalist
in the field, Nuri, along with the students of
War News Radio and members of the college
faculty, have high hopes for War News
Radio's future and this new-founded rela-

tionship.

"I can't imagine a better fit
for War News Radio
We're lucky enough to
have him ..."
David Gelber '63
...

The process of searching for candidates
began early in the summer, soon after the
departure of Marty Goldensohn, War News
Radio's former journalist-in-residence. The
school's initialpoint of contact was alumnus
David Gelber '63, now working for CBS's 60
Minutes, who recommended a list of people
that he was familiar with through his own
experience in the field of journalism.
"I can't imagine a better fit for War News
Radio. Ayub knows radio from his BBC
experience and he knows Iraq better than
most reporters who are there," Gelber said.
"I'm not aware of anything else like War
News Radio in undergraduate education
today. It gives students a chance to
add
value to a national conversation of supreme

Towards the endof the search, two strong
candidates remained, both of whom visited
the campus to work with the students of War
News Radio. The selection process involved
the students of War News Radio as well as
the alumni and many members of the faculty including Professor of History Marjorie
Murphy and Executive Director of the Lang

Center Joy Charlton.
"We thought of this person as a coach for
War News Radio, and we were looking for
someone who could do radio journalism and
was also content knowledgeable. Ayub was a
wonderful find for War News Radio,"
Charlton said.
Nuri, as one of the two strong remaining
candidates, visited Swarthmore to work
with the students for a couple of days during
the summer.
"It was great working with Ayub
When we were working together, there was
electricity in the room. People were more
energized and there was a buzz in the air,"
said War News Radio Senior Producer Hansi
...

Lo Wang 'O9.

According to Murphy, the students were
fairly unanimous in their decision. "After
[Ayub] left, the students were totally jazzed
by the whole project, so I knew that he was
the one," Murphy said. "He's an affable person. He's approachable. You can ask him
very serious questions about Iraq and
engage him or you can just joke with him as
if he were a friend from high school. He's
approachable at all levels."
In addition to his immediate click with
the students, Nuri also had incredible cre-

dentials.
"Another thing that was attracting about
him was that he had prior teaching experience," Professor of History Timothy Burke
said. "But in addition to all those qualifica-

tions of admirable measure, I found him a
very charismatic guy. When he talks, you're
aware that it's something worth listening to.
He's also got that quality that I would prize
in a good teacher in that he's able to persuade people to do the best work they can."
Ever since he was young, Nuri had
dreamt of becoming a radio reporter. His
interest in journalism and the radio led to
his earlier work with Iraqi journalists. He
has a range of experiences in both print and
radio journalism and has been reporting
news on the war in Iraq ever since it began
in 2003. Nuri is widely acknowledged as a
commentator on the Iraqi war and has conducted many interviews for broadcasting

networks such as CNN, BBC and NPR. He
has also written op-eds for The New York
Times and The Washington Post and continues to write op-eds for newspapers in Iraq
from time to time as well as responding to
interview requests that he receives.During
the past year, Nuri attended Columbia
University, graduating with a master's
degree in journalism and worked with the
Human Rights Watch before coming to

Swarthmore.
Amongst his many talents, Nuri is fluent
in three languages
English, Arabic and
Farsi and also speaks a little bit ofTurkish.

because [Student Council] showed what they
learned over the summer," Paul said.
Student Council had a general agenda for
the forum discussion. President Peter
Gardner 'OB began by explaining the "background where Student Council is coming
from in regards to this meeting," he said.
Members of Student Council met with
Training for Change, an internationalfacilitation group, for a two-day diversity and
anti-oppression workshop. Gardner said the
workshop helped him gain some insight into
"what it's like to be a marginalized person,
to be on the outside always."
The first issue addressed by council at
Sunday's forum was ways they could work
to add more transparency to the committee
appointment decisions. According to
Asarnow, "the only way to be successful is to
know someone on the committee or someone
who has applied before
that committees
are more open to people who are close to
committee members."
One idea was to "create a flowchart of the
application process and put up flyers around
campus so people see how easy it is," said
Appointments Chair Sven Udekwu 'O9.

voiced confusion regarding the committee
appointments decisions. There was a need
for "some clarity as to what to expect of students experience wise," he said. Financial

Another idea included compiling and presenting names of students who were on various committees.

Student Council held an open outreach
forum this past Sunday afternoon in the
Scheuer Room. The forum was intended to
open lines of communication between
Student Council and various student groups,
including the Intercultural Center and the
Black Cultural Center communities. Total
attendance at the event was around 15 individuals, including leaders of several IC and
BCC groups, as well Student Council themselves. Participants discussed issues such as
how to clarify the process of appointments to
committees and elections and the funding
process for events and speakers. Campus
Life Representative Randall Johnson 'O9
said the meeting was advertised as being
similar to* the IC and BCC forums held last
year.

...

However, Student Council Vice President
Sam Asarnow 'OB said that this forum had a
different intent than the ones held previously. "The purpose of this forum was an opportunity for Student Council to update the student body on goals," he said. Although many
of the issues covered had been raised in previous forums and dialogues, both Student
Council and leaders of IC groups were
pleased with the focus on "concrete decisions" as well as the openness of the forum.
Co-President of Deshi Parth Lakhani 'lO
said, "StuCo had structured [the forum] differently. Instead of open discussion, it was

people on those committees. Similar issues
were raised in relation to Student Council
elections. Student Council also hopes to
clarify expectations by having direct contact
with applicants to committees.

"The ICC has a lot of more
groups, and I didn't feel
[that] a lot of them were
there."
Paul Apollo 'O9
Students Groups Advisor
Along with election issues, the possibili-

ty of Student Council membership being a
work-study option was briefly raised, but

not discussed at length. At the weekly meeting following the forum, Student Council
members indicated that they may be speaking to Dean ofAdmissions and Financial Aid
Jim Bock '9O regarding this topic.
Funding was another contentious issue
discussed by Student Council. "[The] entire
Swat campus had funding issues," Gardner
said. "Students didn't know where to get
money, where to appeal if they weren't
happy with their decision. Money wasn't
necessarily allocated as should have been."
The IC Swarthmore Asian Organization

intern Andrea Pien 'OB said in an interview
after the forum that that SAO had trouble

enough for SAO to appeal their decision,"

Pien said.
As a possible solution, Student Council
secretary Meredith Firetog 10 passed copies
of a flowchart thatoutlined "various places a
group can go to get money for various
events," she said. The flowchart also contained information on the Social Affairs
Committee appeals process.
Lakhani found the solutions to funding
issues helpful. "A lot of our money will go to
open-campus dinner events and speakers.
The actual procedures for getting money

will be affected by this meeting," he said,
also citing the flowcharts as a usefultool for
finding resources.
Many of the IC leaders attended the
forum with skepticism but were pleased
with the concrete solutions that Student
Council generated in response to the issues
previously raised. "They took on a lot of our
ideas about the ways they can improve,"
Paul said.
Lakhani felt similarly. "There were concrete ideas, based on [past] discussions. I am
happy to know that the discussion wasn't
wasted last semester," he said referring to
the open discussions held in the spring.
"The leaders of [Students of Caribbean
Ancestry] and [Swarthmore African Student
Association] weren't there
but the BCC
did a good job," Paul said. "The IC has a lot
more groups, and I didn'tfeel [that] a lot of
them were there."
Camila Leiva 'O9, IC Enlace intern, was
unable to attend due to conflicts with managing a Latino Heritage Month event that
was occurring at the same time.
Nonetheless, she was 'fencouraged by how
proactive they seem to be, more receptive to
student input, especially cultural groups."

Swarthmore students will show solidarity with demonstrators in Jena,
Louisiana, and from around the country,
at a rally later today to support the legal
cause of six black teenagers in the small
Louisiana town who were charged with
assault in a racially charged story that
has galvanized activist and media attention.
Associate Dean of Multicultural
Affairs Darryl Smaw sent an e-mail to students last night announcing the rally,
which came after a number of posters
around campus and e-mails sent on the
mailing lists of Swarthmore's multicultural groups publicized the event.
According to Marsha-Gaile Davis 'lO, the
goal of the rally is to garner support for
the defense of the accused teenagers and
to familiarize studentswith the issue. "On
campus we're just trying to make the student body aware that this kind of thing is
still going on," she said.
The story, which has garnered national attention this week in advance of a
planned demonstration in Jena today,
began when a black student at Jena High
School asked permission at a school
assembly on Aug. 31, 2006, to sit under a
tree where traditionally only white students had sat. The next morning three
nooses appeared hanging from the tree.
A number of racially-motivated incidents followed the so-called "white tree"
episode, culminating in the assault of a
white student named Justin Barker on
Dec. 4,2006 by sixblack students. Mychael
Bell, one of the six, was charged and con-

ing funds for speakers because Forum for

Free Speech, the committee for allocating

victed for assault, but the conviction was
thrown out and he was to be retried as a
juvenile today (he is 16 years old). Despite
the fact that his conviction was thrown
out, he has not been released from jail.
Many prominent activists have described
the legal proceedings as racially skewed.
According to Smaw's e-mail, in addition to the rally; students will be tabling at
Sharpies during lunch for students to
make monetary donations to a defense
fund for the Jena Six.
Davis said that the rally and its surrounding activities were designed to complement the activities in Jena today,
rather than replacing them. "A protest
would be mere effective if it were in
Louisiana," she said. She referred to
today's planned activities on campus as a
"rally and vigil" rather than a protest.
The rally will begin at the SEPTA train
station at 5:15 p.m. and participants will
then march up Magill Walk to Parrish
Hall where planned speakers include
Smaw, Vice President Maurice Eldridge
'6l and the poet Kahlil Almustafa from
New York City, who is already here as
part of Latino Heritage Month programming.

Davis, who hasbeen leading the effort
for the Jena Six on campus along with
Romane Paul 'lO, said that she is hoping
for a wide turnout of not only students,
but potentiaEy other residents of
Swarthmore and neighboring areas. "I'm
hoping that the whole campus will participate," she said

-

President Bernie Machen said he was
"embarrassed" by the events at Sen. John

Kerry's speech Monday.
Machen said he regretted that civil discourse did not occur at the meeting between
Andrew Meyer and University Police
Department officers.
Meyer was Tasered and charged with a
third-degree felony and a second-degree

misdemeanor after officers said he resisted
arrest with violence and disturbed the
peace. Machen said the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement would conduct a full
investigation of the officers' actions. He said
two officers involved, Eddie King and
Nicole Mallo, would be immediately suspended with pay pending further investigations.
According to a UPD offense report, King
gave the order to Taser Meyer. Mallo
Tasered him in the left shoulder, according
to both King's and Mallo's accounts.
A panel of faculty and students will
review UF's police protocols and suggest
ways to improve. UPD will also conduct an
internal investigation.
The State Attorney's Office will decide

Because Meyer used profanity during a
question-and-answer session, his microphone was turned off, said Steven Blank,
chairman of Accent, Student Government's
speakers bureau. The group hosted Kerry's
speech.
When police tried to pull Meyer from the
microphone, he began to struggle. Six officers held him to the ground, while one
Tasered him.
Machen said safety has been a heightened concern since the Virginia Tech
tragedy, and he is still confident in UPD's
capabilities.

UPD is the "most professional and sensitive group of officers I have ever worked
with," he said.
Machen said Meyer is allowed back on
campus immediately.
Gene Zdziarski, UF dean of students and
assistant vice president of student affairs,
said students charged with misdemeanors

or felonies would be suspended from classes
if they were dangerous to other students.
Meyer does not pose a threat, he said.
Downstairs, protesters waited, cooling
off in the air conditioning after marching
from the Plaza of the Americas to the UPD
office and finally to Emerson Alumni Hall.
"The protesters are concerned about the
same things we are," Machen said.

Sharples prepares for new air conditioning
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
The Sharpies dining facility is undergoing exciting changes, including the addition of air conditioning and the renovation

of employee bathrooms, as well as plans to
possibly reintroduce soft serve ice cream.
As chilly days grow more common on
the Swarthmore campus, air-conditioning
may be the last thing on peoples' minds. At
Sharpies, however, the construction of a
new AC system is expected to be completed

this spring.

"I've been here 17 years, and every year
we've been hoping to get air conditioning,"
Director of Dining Services Linda
McDougall said. "They've [currently] been
working on it every day at Sharpies.
Hopefully by the spring it'll be done."
"We're lucky that the kitchens are air
conditioned, but it's brutal for the employees out here in the warm weather,"
McDougall said.
Others who stand to benefit from the
installation of AC include the alumni who
visit during Alumni Weekend and students
who participate in on-campus sports and
academic programs during the summer,
McDougall said.
Vice President of Facilities and
Management Stu Hain said there are three
principle motives fueling the decision to
install AC in Sharpies. It has been an
administrative ambition for some time.
However, the first technical step forward
to providing AC in Sharpies came when
construction of the Alice Paul dorm began
in 2003. During construction, the engineers
constructed pipes to bring chilled water
down from north campus to the dorm for
its AC. "This gave us the capacity to carry
chilled water to Sharpies," Hain said, "and
allows us to use less electricity to [cool
Sharpies]." The air conditioning system
will work by blowing air over the coiled
pipes that carry water. This year there

were sufficient monies in the college's capital fund to undertake the project. The capital fund provides money for renovations
around campus, both for maintenance and
construction projects.
"[AC is] mostly targeted for students
because we're using Sharpies year-round
now, and it was an issue of the comfort of
students and staff," Hain said. However,
some wonder about the practicality of
installing AC at Sharpies and the environmental costs that will result. To cool a
building like Sharpies would require a lot
of energy," Ashir Sered 'll said.
"It'll be interesting to see how this'll

work because the ceilings are so high.
Personally I think it'd be an engineering
feat to AC this building," McDougall said.
Earthlust member Ethan Deyle 'OB said

"We're going to try to be as efficient as
we can," Hain said, adding that he hadn't

yet done the analysis of the total environmental impact and carbon footprint. "Until
we've actually run the system, we won't

Sharpies will open doors for providing soft

McDougall, Sharpies once treated diners to
machine-dispensed soft serve ice cream,
but the machines were dismantled about
five years ago due to health concerns.
The heat in Sharpies stimulated the
growth of dangerous bacteria in the
yogurt, McDougall said.
The AC will provide a cool enough environment for the yoghurt in soft serve to be
stored for long periods of times without
growing bacteria. "I would enjoy [soft

of the new plans for soft serve at Sharpies
are yet concrete. "We are going to work
hard to figure out whether or not we can

really do this," Hain said.
The administration at this point is still
in the decision-making process, which

the
costs of

College pledges to minimize use of rankings in publications
BY KAITLIN KYI

kkyil@swarthmore.edu
President Al Bloom recently joined the presidents of
eighteen other prominent colleges and universities in signing a pledge to minimize the mention or promotion of college rankings, such as that of U.S. News and World Report,
in college publications. According to Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O, all pamphlets distributed
by the Admissions Office will be free of any ranking information by the fall of 2008.
Swarthmore joins a group of mostly liberal arts colleges in the pledge, including TriCo colleges Bryn Mawr and

Haverford.
The statement is a result of an ongoing discussion on
how pertinent rankings are to prospective students in their
college search. In the statement, Bloom and his colleagues
said, "We are concerned about the inevitable biases in any
single ranking formula, about the admissions frenzy, and
the way in which rankings can contribute to that frenzy and
to a false sense that education success or fit can be ranked
in a single numerical list."
While the college is choosing not to promote ranking
systems, the most prominent of which is U.S. News and
World Report's "Best Colleges" list, it will still be participating in the rankings. The other colleges that signed the
statement, including Williams College and Amherst
College, are all among the "top colleges" named by the U.S.
News. Swarthmore College currently ranks at number
three.
President Bloom was highly involved in the creation
and signing of the statement. "I helped re-craft the statement to better capture our collective point of view," Bloom
said in an e-mail. The crafting of the statement took approximately one month in order to accommodate the work

THE PHOENIX

schedules of those involved during August. The Office of
Admissions was also highly involved with the process during the summer months. "Over the summer, we came
together collectively to talk about [the statement] for people
who were here on campus," Bock said. "Technically, it's the
president's statement, but Al [Bloom] solicited comments
from several members of the staff."
Though the actual creation of the statement took a
month, the debate over the significance of rankings has
always been present among the administration. "We're
always reassessing," Bock said. "You're always tinkering
year after year. We want to know our own institutional
data."
According to Bock, the college will be participating in
a National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities assessment. Instead of ranking colleges and
universities numerically, NAICU does a more general survey of the schools that participate.
Bock said that this specific type of assessment from
NAICU is important for Swarthmore. "We hope [NAICU]
will be more inclusive than U.S. News, and we believe it's
important to share that information. It's more exhaustive"
Bloom said that rankings were important in their ability to raise awareness about the college.
"The rankings raise the visibility of small liberal arts
colleges as a group and many of the dimensions they meassuch as student selectivity, student to faculty ratio,
ure
are of informational value to prospective stuclass size
dents and families," Bloom said.
Bloom, however, remains wary of rankings and the
implications that accompany them.
"In creating the impression that the quality of an institution as a whole can be reduced to a single number and
that only institutions with the high numbers are of quality,
rankings obscure appreciation of the complex qualities of
September 20, 2007

individual institutions and of the wealth and range of quality institutions in America," Bloom said.
Bock also said that rankings like U.S. News can be limited by its method of assessment as well as its motivation.
"You can't really compare apples to oranges," Bock said.
"What's been problematic is that U.S. News says that it's the
most comprehensive. They're also trying to make money."
Despite the limited scope of lists like U.S. News and
World Report's "Best Colleges," rankings also have a certain
amount of currency among international prospective students. In many occurrences, such lists are the very method
by which international students are attracted to

Swarthmore.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal
believes that rankings do have positive recruiting value,
especially for international students. "Particularly since
our name is not as widely known because of our size, I think
[rankings do] attract some really great international college
students," Westphal said.
Sneha Shrestha 11, an international student from
Nepal, said, "In a place like Nepal, people know the Ivies.
Everyone told me to apply there. When I told people about
Swarthmore, people said why are you going there? And I
would tell them to look at the rankings."
Westphal still believes that the administration made
the correct decision in deciding to remove mention of rankings from literature publicizing the college, believing the
change will allow students to refocus on what truly embodies Swarthmore. "I think the whole ranking process has
really skewed admissions across the country. It makes people apply to schools for the wrong reasons," Westphal said.
"If you come to Swarthmore, you should come here because
you want to come here; it's a unique experience here. I
think it's harmful for the students who come for the wrong
reason."

StuCo reissues seed funds for groups Facilities plans for
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY CLAUDIA SEIXAS

cseixasl@swarthmore.edu

Last Sunday, the Student Budget Committee
accepted Student Council's supplemental budget proposal for "seed funds," money mat the Council distributes to new student groups that demonstrate potential. According to Student Groups Advisor Paul Apollo
'O9, seed funds have existed for a long time, but since
no one has applied for seed money in the past three
years, the spring 2007 Student Council decided not to
include seed funds in their budget proposal during
SBC's spring budgeting. However, at the beginning of
the semester, Student Council received four inquiries
regarding seed funds for upstart groups on campus.

These groups include Students for a Democratic
Society, Swarthmore's Depression Support Group and
a ping-pong club.
Apollo said that he advocated for the issue of seed
funds. "The reasoning for seed funds is that that's
what groups need to build interest," Apollo said.
Council members discussed reinstating seed funds at
the Student Council retreat at the endoflast semester,

but the newfound interest in the discretionary funds
this semester restarted the discussion of seed funds.
Any student interested in starting a group or
securing funding for a pre-existing but unchartered
group is eligible to apply for seed funds. Apollo said
the eligibility criteria for seed fund distribution
includes: how long the group has been active, how
many members they claim, the group's mission,
whether there is overlap with other existing groups,
and how the group plans to benefit the college. During
their weekly Sunday meeting, SBC considered

Student Council's supplementary proposal and awarded it $250.00, enough to distribute $5O of seed funding
to five different groups. If these resources are exhausted, SBC protocol allows for the review of additional

proposals. "Unless the student gives a compelling case
otherwise, we're looking to give $5O [per group] $4O
for all campus events (the equivalent of two study
breaks) and $lO for fliers and photocopies," Apollo

said.

"We completely encourage seed funds because we
think that it's important for groups to have standing
ground in order to generate interest," Student Budget
Manager Giannina Esquivel 'OB said. Elena Smith 'O9,
co-founder of the Swarthmore Depression Support
Group, is one of students who inquired about seed
funds. SDSG, in its very beginning stages, held its first
meeting Tuesday night. Smith said she contacted
Apollo about two weeks ago regarding seed funds and
was informed that at the time Student Council did not
have available funding.
"We thought it was really important to advertise

and have refreshments at the first meeting to make it
a more inviting place. But we decided fro seed funds,
no snacks,'" Smith said. "It just doesn't make sense to
pay out of our own pockets." Smith received a
response from Apollo Monday morning inviting her to
apply for the newly available funds. Apollo, who is
also on the Chartering Committee, said he is glad

Beardsley changes
BY KATE WALTON

kwaltonl@swarthmore.edu

Beardsley, currently housing ITS and the Art Department, underwent extreme renovations on the upper levels this summer, pleasing
some but leaving others wanting more.
The Art department experienced considerable changes specifically, the renovations included the expansion of the space of senior
studios on the thirdfloor and the moving of the slide library to a more
prominent location adjacent to the department office. ITS, however,
which occupies half of the building, has seen little change.
Named for Swarthmore's first engineering professor, Arthur
Beardsley, the building has housed many different academic programs over the years. It was not until the early 1990s that it came to
take the shape that Swarthmore students know it as today: half ITS,
half Art department. Some argue, though, that the building has not
gracefully transitioned from its former engineering function to its
new multi-purpose role. "This room has been used for many different
things, but it hasn't been renovated for its use," ITS coordinator Seth
Frisbie-Fulton said in reference to one of the ITS rooms on the first
-

floor. "It's had many lives."

more resources have been made available to new
groups. "It makes me very excited
the more new
groups I can charter, the happier I'll be."
Editor's note: As Student Groups Advisor, Apollo is
the Student Council representative on SBC, and therefore he did not vote on the recent decision.

"The fact is that it is using every
square in there; so they could use
more space Something needs to
give in that building."

Semler said. "The faculty would like to see improvements to the studio places which have the mechanical air conditioning."
The building, while modern in many ways, is still cooled by a fairly antiquated method of air conditioning. Although there are many
difficulties in solving the space problem, facilities management sees
air conditioning as a simpler problem. However, even air-conditioning poses issues. "When you air condition a building you need big
fans and coils. It would require a planning process over the next two
years," Hain said. Some are most concerned with the overall aesthetics of the building. "It's like a fortress," Mark Dlugash 'OB said. "It'snot very friendly or warm."

The Art department is facing the same problem. "Their dream is
about increasing the space," Facilities Manager Jan Semler said.
Hain explained the difficulty of acquiring more space for either
ITS or the Art department, saying that there is no room to expand
within the building and the only solutions would require either an
addition or relocation for one of the programs. "Something needs to
give in that building," Hain said.
However, the professors and students of the Art department have
voiced their appreciation for the changes made over the summer. "It's
extraordinary, "studio art professor Randall Exon said. "I think this
space is at its peak." The population of Art and Art History majors is
growing steadily. Currently, a combined total offourteen seniors participate in the two programs. "We were able to fit the creative arts into
the larger fabric of the school," Exon said. Exon has been withthe college since 1982, and has been witness to Beardsley's transformation.
In order to house the growing program, Art professors and school
administrators recognized the need for a larger, more functional
space. While portions of the Art department, namely printmaking,
were moved to Old Tarble, the renovations focused mainly on changing the current space in Beardsley. "It's a good example of what you
can do with spaces ... everyone wants a new building, but it's possible
to take old buildings and, in the spirit of sustainability, make old
buildings work," Exon said.
Other, smaller improvements to Beardsley may still be in the
works. While most of the building has been renovated and is up to
date, "some spaces are still operating under the old mechanisms,"

For many, the aesthetics of Beardsley do not compare to that of

other academic buildings. "Beardsley has always been seen as a bit of

Dean's office offers student life coaching
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swartlimore.edu

Swarthmore students seeking professional support now have two resources
available to them. While Counseling and
Psychological Services has long offered psychological counseling and psychotherapy,
the Dean's Office has recently begun offering life coaching to students in need.
Aiming to help individuals pinpoint and
achieve their goals, life coaching is
designed to work both independently of and
in tandem with psychological services.
Life coaching will be offered by Assistant
Director of Student Life and Head Field
Hockey Coach Kelly Wilcox '97, who introduced the practice to the Dean's Office after
seeing its success with the athletes whom
she coaches. Wilcox described life coaching
as "coaching to the gap of where you are and
where you want to be. We all have dreams,
and they can seem insurmountable, and a
life coach breaks them down to achievable
goals and action plans."
Wilcox, who is a certified life coach, was
introduced to the practice while completing
her master's degree in psychological services at the University of Pennsylvania. "It was
described by a supplemental speaker in one
of my classes at Penn. I was coaching parttime at Swarthmore at the time, and the
approach outlined by this woman struck me
as something that would really resonate
with my students," Wilcox said. "What I like
is that it assumes that the individual has the
answers and the potential within them, and
the life coach partners with them to shift or
open up perspective. I think it resonates
well with Swarthmore students who are
action-oriented, who are very intelligent
and capable, but sometimes need help shifting perspectives or shifting course when

necessary."

Wilcox also stressed that life coaching
can be utilized both alone or along with
CAPS counseling. While students are

always welcome to approach

her first, she

may refer them to CAPS. Wilcox said that
students must be prepared for life coaching,
and if the preparation is not there, they may

need to work with CAPS first. "Students are
the drivers, and I see myself as the passenger and navigator. Sometimes before they
are ready, they need to look in the rearview
mirror before can put their foot on
the pedal," Wilcox said. "Other times
they are ready to hit the road. Everyone is
different."
To expose the residential assistants to
life coaching, Wilcox conducted an informational session at RA training this year.
Since RAs are often put in situations where
they are asked to be a life coach, Wilcox
wanted to introduce them to the fundamentals of life coaching. To do so, she focused on
active listening and powerful questions.
Wilcox defined powerful questions as those
that cannot be answered by yes or no.
Part of the session focused on how life
coaching can help people concentrate on the

positive aspects of their life, and how they
can use that positive energy to help them
achieve their goals. "[Wilcox's] saying how
often times people will focus on what they
aren't doing, focusing more on the negative
than the positive. What life coaching teaches is to focus on the positives. Everything
has some bad, and life coaching showed how
to focus on the good. It seems good for helping approach life's challenges," Marissa

Davis 'OB said.
Davis also appreciated the session, stating that it gave her a wider range of
resources to refer to when acting as an RA.
"It's always good to know different perspectives on how to handle situations and to
know to some extent that we can be informal support for students," Davis said.
According to Wilcox, she is currently not
as available for life coaching as she would
like to be due to her dual responsibilities as
an assistant dean and head field hockey
coach. However, she plans to be more acces-

sible once the field hockey season is over.
"I would just love to have my office full
with students all day. But the senior dean
staff wants to make sure that I survive
through the hockey season, and hopes to
make me a greater resource in November or
December. However, I'm happy to serve as a
resource anytime, even if I can't commit a
lot of time right now. My door is always
open," Wilcox said.
Wilcox has also been working with
Office of News and Information Associate
Director Alisa Giardinelli to craft an essay

From COKE, p.

"I think of Smith and Swarthmore in
the same light. Both are prestigious campuses which take the facts before they
make decisions," Rogers saicLßogers currently works with 45 colleges and universities to remove Coke from campuses
nationwide. "[Coke] say[s] a number of
things that just aren't true. They try to
besmirch the information we put out concerning labor, human rights and the
environment," Rogers said. Rogers said
that he is willing to meet with Coca-Cola
at any kind of venue, forum or committee. "Coke will not go head to head with
me in any venue," Rogers said.
Among other examples, Rogers cited
KLD Research and Analytics, Inc.'s decision to drop Coca-Cola and two of its
largest bottling companies from its index
of socially responsible funds as evidence
of Coca-Cola's labor and environmental
violations. KLD Research and Analytics
is an independent investment research
firm in Boston that creates a Broad
Market Social Index, that, according to
KLD's Web site, identifies "the best environmental, social and governance performers."
Rogers also expressed concerns
regarding the motives of a Swarthmore
Board of Managers member. However,
Rogers did not provide The Phoenix with
substantial support for his claims in time
for publication.
THE PHOENIX

Schultz said that Swarthmore's Kick
Coke campaign has been working more
closely with the United Students Against
Sweatshops organization than with Ray

Rogers.

Schultz acknowledged the difficulty
in collaborating with an international
solidarity campaign, stating that it is difficult not to be in close contact with the
movement and situation in India and
Colombia.
Eldridge said that the Board is looking for stronger evidence, "evidence that
reaches a conclusion
that reflects a
thorough study of the issues from a variety of points of view and a wider band of
sources on any and/or all sides of the
issues that concern the campaign."
Schultz said that Kick Coke has been
in touch with Corporate Accountability
International, the Polaris Institute and
the National Alliance for People's movements, the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy and the People's Union for
Civil Liberties in order to bolster and
corroborate the information Kick Coke
receives from the national campaign.
"It is harder to find organizations
working on the labor abuses in
Colombia, most likely because [such
work] would result in a threat to their
life. People working for human and labor
rights in Colombia are continually
threatened, kidnapped and murdered,
including judges who rule on those
cases," Schultz said.

and Wilcox say that that the essay could be
one way to inform Swarthmore students
about life coaching and its place in the
dean's office and on the college campus, as
currently few students are aware that life
coaching

is offered at the college.
Giardinelli, who edits the feature stories on

the homepage, approached Wilcox about
writing the essay. "Given Kelly's new role

coaching, it seemed like a perfect fit,"

Kick Coke under pressure

Katherine Koch Phoenix Staff

Assitant Director of Student Life and Academic Affirs Kelly Wilcox, with her prior experience as a certified life coach, helped introduce this new practice into the Dean's Office.

"For years, we had the problem of not
having enough sources in Iraq. In fact, the
whole media has that problem," Murphy

said. "And here was someone who knew a

lot of sources and could, if we had a question, lead us in the right direction. This
was exciting."

Nuri has helped arrange interviews for
getting people's consent to do
interviews, sharing his contacts and also
serving as a great source of information
about Iraq.
"I am familiar with the situation in Iraq
to a high extent and I have a big network of
contacts. I know what kind of problem is

the students,

prevalent and the students don't have to
research on the computer anymore. Now
here I am, I can give them all that information," Nuri said.
Since Nuri's arrival, War News Radio
has taken up several new projects.
"We've been coming up with new segments for the show, such as 'A Day in the
Life' in which we profile one person and
broadcast one specific personal story every
week. Last week, we had an Iraqi teacher
telling his story in first person and this
week, we interviewed an Iraqi refugee in
Syria," Wang said. "Usually, they're only
given one or two quotes but we give them
five minutes to tell their story. We're giving
the chance for these people to put their voices out there."
Wang said they were looking for an
Afghan voice as well and talked also about

September 20, 2007

the possibility of interviewing an American
soldier for this new segment. In addition,
Nuri also inspired them to bring back "Iraq
101" and "Afghanistan 101," a series of
reports that delve into the historical background and context of a certain term.
Through all his work, Nuri expressed his
hopes to make a difference, "not to leave
everything that is done, but whatever it is to
really expose it to the world."
"I hope people in Iraq put aside their differences and forget about the past. That's the
reason for all the problems in Iraq, they
have to put their differences away and live
together. If not, there will always be problems," Nuri said.
In addition to sharing his knowledge
with the students, Nuri hopes to learn from
the them as well. "I will definitelylearn from
[the students] too," he said. "I will learn
about this country from them, as they will
learn about Iraq from me."
Both the faculty who have been involved
and the students ofWar News Radio feel fortunate about this opportunity to workwith
Nuri.
"Ayub is so knowledgeable about the situation in Iraq, and he enjoys communicating with people about it in groups and in
face-to-face conversations. To have that kind
of expert on campus, someone the campus
can speak with, isn't just about War News
Radio, it's about the whole community,"
Charlton said.
"He's a really exciting guy in general,"
Burke said. "Both the student body and the
faculty ought to get to know him."

Lang Center undergoes changes with leadership, location
BY SARAH PETERSON

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

Over the summer, the Lang Center for
Civic and Social Responsibility, previously
housed in the SEPTA-owned train station,
has moved to the newly renovated building
at 3 and 5 Whittier Place on the north end
of campus. This change in location, however, is just one of many new changes and
developments.

Location, Location, Location
The new location has a number of
advantages for the Lang Center, one of
which is a greater proximity to the main
buildings on campus. It's a psychological
shift, as well as a physical one. "The train
station isn't on-campus, in most students'
minds," said Associate Director for Student
Programs and Training Pat James. "I
would go up to Parrish, and run into students who would say 'What are you doing
on campus?' Well, I work on campus, but it
was really clear that the train station was
not on a normal route that students were
traveling anyway
People had to be really intentional about going to the train station.This is a little more centrally located."
Space had also been an issue at the train
something the staff recognized
station
even when they first moved into the train
station around five years ago. "In our first
staff meeting we said something like 'This
space is too small, it's already too small,'"
said James. At the time, the staff already
had bigger plans for what the center could
achieve. When the Lang Center was just
opening, the staff took a "field trip" to
Stanford University to see what their Haas
Center for Public Service looked like, in
hopes of finding a model or prototype.
James said that as the day went on and
classes ended, they noticed that the Haas
Center grew increasingly filled with student groups. "We realized that, at the train
station, we didn't have the building to fill
with student groups. We could get one,
maybe two groups in there and that was it.
There was no more space."
The new Whittier location, in contrast,
features an entire wing dedicated to student organizations and activities, including small meeting rooms, a project space
and kitchen, a library of books, as well as
...

conversational areas and computers.

With the advent of all this new space,
the staff of the Lang Center made sure that

it was going to be as useful to student
groups and community service groups as
possible. When plans for the renovation
were being made, a set of architects and
interior designers worked with the staff to
develop ideas about how the space should
be used. For example, the Keith Room, a
large classroom on the main floor named
after the center's former founding director,
is equipped to seat about 40 people. The
tables and chairs, however, fold, roll and
can easily be moved from the room.
"Sometimes it's going to be a classroom,
sometimes you're going to be doing a training in there where you're doing a lot of
experiential work and you want people up
and moving," James said.
A New Director
On July X Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs and Professor of Sociology Joy
Charlton stepped into the role of executive
director of the Lang Center. Charlton succeeded founding director Jennie Keith,
who had been with the Center since its
inception five years ago, before retiring

this summer.
Charlton was invited last December to
take the position, and until assuming full-

8

time responsibilities was meeting weekly
with Keith about the projects and initiatives that the Lang Center was involved in.
"I love the job," Charlton said, explaining that she felt the responsibilities of
working with students, faculty, administration and the larger community to be a good
fit with her experience as a professor, dean
and sociologist. It also suits her personal
values, Charlton said, in terms of relating
to larger communities. "I am an ethnographer, I do most of my research by observation and interviewing, and so when I teach
I always have my students out in the field
one way or another. So I feel as if I've
always been bridging the community and
the classroom in lots of ways. So, to have
that be my focus—l'm thrilledand delighted."
"I think it's been a really smooth transition," James said. "[Charlton] has known
us, she's known the program for a long
time ...When we didn't have a Lang Center
and it was just me doing the service learning programs and so forth, I was in the
Deans' Office. So Joy's been aware of this
work for a long time."
Fostering Community and Collaboration
Charlton expressed excitement and
anticipation for the kinds of connections
and initiatives that would take place in the
new location. "One of my goals is for it to
be a very lively space," Charlton said. "I'm
eager to have classes meet here, and I'm
eager to have staffhave meetings here, and
I'm eager to have student groups meet
here, and I'm eager to have individuals
study here
I'm eager for community
partners to come and meet here."
But the increase in space is not simply
meant to facilitate the goals of individual
groups. Both James and Charlton felt that
with an increase in space and a larger
capacity for hosting multiple projects at
the same time, a productive culture befitting the Center's goals might emerge.
"Our new space is conducive for many
diverse groups to meet and learn about
each other. One of the things that happens
at Swat, for example, is that activist groups
and community service groups don't' seek
each other out to talk to each other," James
said. "But if you've got two groups that are
ultimately sharing the same goal of ending
poverty or improving education or something like that, it's a lot easier for them to

see that they're Working on a continuum
towards a same goal. We want this to be a
welcoming place for that kind of thing to

happen."
"I hope it will be a bridge space for people and the synergy that develops out of
that," Charlton said. "And the energy that
can develop out of that will just take us to a
whole new level." Charlton offered an

example of this kind of synergetic culture:
She was acting as a host at the Lang Center
on Sunday night when two groups met in
succession in the Keith Room. The first
group had brought refreshments and had

leftovers, Charlton said, and left those
refreshments for the following group to use
in their respective meeting. "I know it's a
small thing, but it's kind of symbolic of
some of the synergy that I hope develops."
According to James, a number of student groups have already asked if they can
begin meeting at the Lang Center. "We are
in the process of hiring desk-sitters so that
we can keep the desk open beyond the time
that the staff is here," she added.
Organizations that have already met at the
Lang Center include Earthlust, Darfur

Radio

Project and the Intercultural
Center—which held a leadership training
session at the Lang Center. Charlton said

that the Keith Room is already becoming a
popular meeting space—and not just for
students. Human Resources is using it for
staff orientation, and the Dean's staff will
be having a staff meeting there to get to

know the space.

One of the first events that took place at
the new location this year was a banquet
hosted by the Swarthmore Progressive
Action Coalition, held on September 2.
SPAC treasurer Markus Schlotterbeck 'lO
worked with James over the summer to
plan the event. The goals of SPAC are similar to those of the Lang Center, insofar as
their goal is —according to Schlotterbeck

said.
SPAC member Ruth Schultz 'O9 said that
while SPAC's plans are still in formation,
they want to promote unification and collaboration among activist, cultural and
service groups on campus. "Everyone's
focused on what they're doing, but it's good
to look outside at what others are doing
and have fun," Schultz said.

A Different Kind of Classroom
Charlton not only expressed hope that
the center would serve to connect classrooms with communities outside of
Swarthmore, but also that the classrooms
within the Lang Center might help connect
the center with the Swarthmore community itself. Faculty are using the seminar

room as a place to teach their courses,
including professor of education Ann
Renninger's Introduction to Education
First Year Seminar, as well as film and
media studies professor Bob Rehak's
Animation and Cinema. "I love having

classes here for slightly different reasons,"
Charlton said. "One is that I'm eager for
the faculty to be involved in the center, so
if I get them here in classes, they're here
and they know about it." In an e-mail,
Rehak found out about the available space
through the faculty email list. Rehak was
pleased with the projection system, important for a class in which videos are often
shown. "If there's a drawback at present,
it's that the recent construction has a *new

car' smell I'm sure this will fade in the
next few weeks," he added. "When I hesitated about using the Lang Center for an
animation course (a bit of an incongruity),"
Rehak said, "Joy assured me that the goal
was to bring students and faculty to the
Center and encourage them to see it as a
vibrant, useful space."
Samuel Green 'll, one of Renninger's
students, wrote in an e-mail that while he
wasn't sure about whether the Lang Center
was "really on campus," he had been to the
new location a few times
"and am somewhat intimidated by the awesome focus
and drive of the socially conscious students
who use the place as their workspace for
various projects." Green also wrote that he
was interested in getting involved with a
mentoring program, and "I'd like to spend
more time [at the Lang Center] as I figure
...

out what it is that I want to do with my life
at Swarthmore."
"The Lang Center is fresh, just the right
temperature, and downright classy," wrote
Daniel Symonds 'IL another student in
Renninger's seminar. "Lately, I've taken to
studying in the 'student study area' of the

Lang Center, either solo or with a group of
friends
I plan to study there regularly."
With regards to faculty involvement with
the Lang Center, Charlton said that she
thinks there will be more. This year, the
Lang Center received Teagle and Mellon
Grants to support faculty as they discuss
...

community-based learning.

"The college mission, as stated somewhere
is to provide academic excellence
...

in the context of social responsibility. And
when I think of the center
that's my
focus: academic excellence in the context of
social responsibility," Charlton said, also
adding that there is a core group of faculty
involved with the Lang Center who are
interested in and have held discussions on
community-based learning." In the spirit of
ethnography and learning about what goes
on in this part of the college and the community." Charlton herself plans to spend
time volunteering alongside students at
their placements or during their Saturdays
of Service. Charlton said she hopes to
come to "a better understanding of what's
going on and how we can support it in the
best possible way and help the Lang Center
become evermore organized and coherent
in its support of students."

Honorary degrees Lecture addresses U.S. Constitution

process to begin
BY KAITLIN KYI

kkyil@swarthmore. edu
In 1888, only 24 years after
Swarthmore
founding,
College began awarding individuals with honorary degrees
during commencement. Now,
nearly 120 years later, the
Honorary Degree Committee is
accepting nomination letters

for

Honorary degrees are conferred
upon three recipients each year
as a way of paying tribute to
distinguishments.
their
According to the criteria listed
by the committee, a candidate
must demonstrate "distinction,
leadership or originality in significant human endeavor," as
well the capability to serve as
role model for the graduating
class, which the candidate will
address in a short charge about
five minutes long.
The committee also looks for
balance and diversity among
candidates over the years in
terms of gender, race, academic
discipline and careers. "The
committee reads the letter [of
nomination] and they sit and
look at who we've honored in
the past... you want people who
are going to be an inspiration to
the graduation class," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said. The Honorary Degree
Committee is comprised of four
faculty members and three
board members with President
Al Bloom and Eldridge acting
as co-chairs. "The process
begins with nominations from
its

the broad Swarthmore community," Bloom said in an email.
"It then involves a good deal of
research on each qualified nominee and extended consideration to identify the three candidates the Committee believes
would contribute most, in
'terms of who they are and what
they have accomplished, to the
quality of the Commencement
experience for the graduating
class in that year." The
Committee also looks for candidates, who if not alumni, have a
connection to the college. Bill
Cosby, who holds an honorary
degree from Swarthmore, has
demonstrated a commitment to
liberal arts education around
the Philadelphia area.For a candidate to be awarded a degree,
they must be present to give a
speech at commencement.

The Committee also prefers
to honor people who have yet to

reach the peak of their careers
and who may not have yet been
recognized for their achievements, though this criteria is
not rigid.

Princeton University's Professor Kim Lane
Scheppele's Constitution Day visiteded Swarthmore

on Tuesday and presented a lecture where she dis-

cussed Executive Branch emergency powers and how
they evolve within the American constitutional sys-

tem.
"[Scheppele] has challenged the arguments made
by John Yoo, Alberto Gonzales and others working
within the Executive Branch for expansive and even
unlimited power of the Executive to deal with terror-

ism," Professor of Political Science Carol Nackenoff
said in an email. "Some of these arguments made by
Executive Branch apologists are referred to as the
theory of the 'unitary executive.'"
Scheppele began by giving the audience a brief
overview of the history of American governance
under the American constitution.
To further emphasize the point of the alarming
regularity in which states of emergency are declared
within the United States, Scheppele read out a list of
recent states of emergency declared for seemingly
innocuous incidents that arguably may not warrant
their imposition: blustery storms in New York and
the bridge collapse in Minnesota to name but a few.
In keeping with the spirit of the talk, Scheppele
reminded the audience of the delegation of emergency powers, as designated within the American
Constitution. Yet, Scheppele argued, this legislation
has meant very little in the context of American
democracy, as "It has actually never been the base
that Congress has had the power to enforce emergencies." Scheppele took the audience through some
notable instances where the Executive Branch has
ridden roughshod over the Congressional Branch of
power at various times in America's independent history. She proposed that, "The biggest emergency in

As we entered the 20th century, the form
of emergencies changed." Scheppele noted that in the
United States, "Congress increasingly began granting legislative powers to the President." In giving the
Presidency such overwhelming powers, Scheppele
said, Congress sustains the danger of having their
own power undermined for a period considerably
longer than they had provisionally hoped for.
Scheppele also said, "We know from leaks that the
President's legal advisors have advised him that his
inherent powers in times of emergency make him
immune to publicly declaring his policy decisions.
Effectively, his position as Commander-in-chief
means that he can ignore any congressional statutes
that impinge on his power."
From Scheppele's point of view, no democratic system has devised an effective formula to deal with
emergency situations. She contends that the U.S.
Constitution in its current state is "in dire need of
redrafting
any country would have adopted a new
constitution after the Civil War instead of amending
the existing one." Moreover, she argued that, "In the
United States, political parties have become much
more dominant than institutions. The Presidential
system is increasingly looking like a parliamentary
system, a working majority in Congress is a sure way
of ensuring Executive Branch domination over the
other branches of power."
Many of the attending students found Scheppele's
perceptive analysis of the American Constitution and
its limitations impressing and enlightening.
Youda Cao 'll said that one of the most memorable
parts of the lecture for him, "[Was when Shappelle
said] that our Constitution has lasted so long only
because at almost every time, one part of it has not
been working."

Projects press sexual violence awareness
BY MARIA KHIM
mkhiml@swarthmore.edu
The Clothesline Project is currently well underway,

HandPrint Pledge and the newly established
White Ribbon Project. These projects are separate but workto raise the level of
ing together toward a common goal
awareness and support on campus concerning issues of sexual violence.
The Clothesline Project is designed to give the opportunity for survivors of sexual violence and their friends and
family to express themselves through decorating t-shirts of
different colors that represent different kinds of violence,
including sexual assault, rape, violence because of perceived queer or trans identity, domestic violence, child
abuse, incest and murder. These t-shirts are then hung up
along with the

around campus. They will first be displayed in Upper Tarble
during the day on Monday and the following days on
Tuesday and Wednesday, they will be hung on the clothesline in front ofParrish.
In the past, the Clothesline Project has taken place
toward the end of the spring semester, but as a result of
complications that arose last year due to its proximity to the
exam period, the Clothesline Project Committee moved it to
earlier in the fall semester when students would be less
busy and less preoccupied by class commitments.
"The goals are the same as they have been every year: to
raise awareness, offer support and make visible that there

is a community at Swarthmore that cares about these
issues," said Patrick Rock 'O9, a member of the Clothesline

Project Committee.

T-shirts and supplies have been made available throughout the week at Worth Health Center, in front of the
Dean's Office and at the Intercultural Center. Boxes have
also been placed next to the supplies for t-shirt submissions
and they are collected every day. In addition to the line of tshirts, the Clothesline Project is hosting several other related events.

On Monday evening, when the t-shirts go up, an Open
Mic event is happening in Upper Tarble. In this event, various stories, poems and other submissions that were submitted throughout the week will be recited. "Last year, the
speak-out ended up being pretty intense; I would encourage
people to bring a friend," said Nicole Belanger 'OB, another
member of the Clothesline Project Committee.

"Masculinity is often times defined
as a trait used to dominate
someone else The HandPrint
Pledge is an effort to go against that
definition of masculinity."
Nicole Belanger 'OB
...

...

Clothesline Project Committee
On Wednesday, there willbe an open ring discussion and
on Thursday there will be a closing luncheon.
"People often have many misconceptions about sexual
assault and do not understand that sexual misconduct can
happen in many different ways," said Marilyn BatongaNgassa 'OB, another member of the Clothesline Project
Committee. "The idea for the ring-discussion is that we
want to have more people that are non-survivors
discuss
issues, such as how we define sexual misconduct, some of
the prejudices that we may have... and ways to deal with it."
"For me, this kind of event is important just because
sometimes being here, we become part of a bubble and are
unaware of many issues," Kathryn Riley 'lO said. "This project serves as a reality check for some of these issues that are
prevalent in our community."
Like last year, the Handprint Pledge is happening simultaneously with the Clothesline Project. The HandPrint
...

...

Pledge is an event in which men are invited to put their
handprint on a sheet, which will later I>e hung publicly
around the campus, as a sign that they pledge not to participate in sexual violence and to stand against it.
"Masculinity is oftentimes defined as a trait used to dominate
someone else, whether it is through physical violence or sexual assault. The Handprint Pledge is an effort to
go against that definition of masculinity," Belanger said.
This year's Clothesline Project is happening along with
a new event, the White Ribbon Project. It was established,
according to Rock, in response to feedback from students
that they could not get as involved as they wanted to be in
the past, especially for non-survivors on campus. This gives
all students the opportunity to move beyond their status as
passive observer to become active supporters during this
...

week of awareness.
"Whereas the HandPrint Project is targeted at only men,
the White Ribbon Project is a way for the entire campus,

regardless of their gender, sexuality, etc. to demonstrate
their support for those touched by sexual violence," said
Reid Wilkening 'lO, a Sexual Misconduct Advisors and
Resource Team member also involved in the Handprint
Pledge and White Ribbon Project.
In the White Ribbon Project, white ribbons will be made
available for students who wish to show their support
throughout the week. Donations are also being accepted for
Women Against Rape, an organization that offers various
types of support and helps survivors cope with rape and

other incidents of sexual violence.

"What I want people to take away from it is that

these people are very strong and resilient," Belanger said.
"While they are responding to bad things that have happened to them through the t-shirts, the important thing is
that they are getting through it. They are sharing their
experiences, but also taking active steps to make things better, and that's something important to acknowledge.
They're the strongest group of people I've ever worked
with."

Cockroaches and pests infest Mary Lyon dorm over summer

abertyl@swarthmore.edu.
Since the beginning of the semester,
Mary Lyon dwellers have been reporting a

rise in the cockroach population, particularly in the basement and near the
kitchen.
These creepy crawlers, that Housing

Coordinator Liz Derickson 'Ol referred to
as "gross" have been spotted and reported
to Mary Lyon RA Mark Kharas 'OB, who
then contacted Workbox in order to take
care of this unfortunate problem.
Kharas said that the increase in reportmight

consequence of the way in which the
kitchen was maintained over the summer.
Derickson said that oftentimes there are
more bug sightings at the beginning of the
semester. "I think that there has been a
significant rise in cockroach sightings,
particularly on the side of the basement
close to the basement kitchen. I know that
the kitchen was kept very messy during
the summer and suspect that some of the
rise is associated with that," Kharas wrote
in an e-mail.
Allison Barlow 'OB, the RA for Mary
Lyon

this past summer, said that the

increase is due to the summer dwellers.
"In my two years living here (both academic year and summer), there have
always been cockroaches in ML. I think
that this is largely due to the abuse of the
kitchens over the summer months.
Although we are supposed to be a very
intelligent lot, many Swarthmore students
have yet to learn how to clean," Barlow
said in an e-mail. "It is pathetic that a
group so allegedly focused on helping others cannot have the decency to maintain
the cleanliness of public kitchens for even

a week. Since the dorm is less social and
more sparsely populated over the summer,

A cockroach skitters across the carpet in Shane Student Lounge in Parrish. In addition to the problems in Mary Lyon over the summer, students have reported cockroach sightings in other dorms, including Dana and Willets.
I heard fewer complaints about cockroaches. Despite this, I do not doubt that the
cockroaches are courtesy of the summer

residents."

Stephanie Appiah 'lO recounted her
experience at ML during her stay over the
summer. According to Appiah, cockroaches were a constant issue that did not desist
despite efforts to keep the dorm clean,
including the kitchen area, and setting up

bug traps. "There was a cockroach in, my
room when I moved in and it continued to
be an issue all summer long in the dorm,
especially in the basement. I tried setting
up traps in my room and the RAs would
stress about keeping the dorm and the
kitchens clean, but that still didn't get rid

of the cockroaches," she said.
Recently, ML dwellers have not reported any further cockroach sightings, lead-

Construction on David Kemp continues with adjustments
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Outside construction to be concluded by November, walkways to be paved from dorms to Magill Walk
BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore.edu
David Kemp Hall has been under con-

struction throughout this past summer
and appears likely to be finished on schedule by May 2008. Outside construction for

the building should be completed by
November, whereupon the construction
crew will then work inside the building
on interior construction projects.
Although the construction progressed
smoothly in the summer and throughout
the first month of the school year, there
have been some noise complaints by students living in the nearby dorms, Mertz
and Alice Paul. Move-in logistics became
more complicated for incoming freshman
in August, spawning the necessity for the
various shopping carts found around campus and a new pathway in that area.

loud construction noises early in the
morning. "One of the struggles last week
was transitioning from the summer, trying to accommodate student schedules,"
Derickson said. There were "at least two
days last week where the work started
earlier than it was supposed to."
Construction in the summer began
early at 6 am but was supposed to shift to
7:30 when students arrived. Due to a miscommunication, however, work started at
6:15 am on a few days. Mertz resident
Aurora Munoz 'lO said, "In my hall people
were disturbed because the construction
started at 6:30 and it woke people up."
However, the effect of the construction
on residents of Alice Paul and Mertz
appears to be largely location-specific.
Roy Allen 10, who lives on the side of
Alice Paul facing away from the construction, indicated that the construction had
not significantly disturbed him. "I'm not
really bothered by the construction
[though] I know a lot of people on the
other side who might be," Allen said.
Furthermore, Allen cited the amenities
of Alice Paul as being conducive to minimizing the effect of the noise, saying, "It's
good that we have air conditioning,
because then I can keep my window
closed and I don't have to hear construc...

"Mike Boyd was a very
strong advocate in this
process and [he was]
eager to be responsive to
student concerns."
Liz Derickson 'Ol
Housing Coordinator
The plan for David Kemp resembles
very closely that of Alice Paul. One minor
difference is that David Kemp will have
"different angles compared to the square
ones of Alice Paul," said Senior Project
Manager Mike Boyd. "Alice Paul is L

shaped, Kemp has a bridge that connects
the east and west portion of it that you
would walk under. An overhead canopy
that will [be] connected into Alice Paul,
but not bridge connection." The canopy
concept parallels the connection between
the two parts of the Science Center, which
includes a courtyard and an outdoor

blackboard.
Boyd said, "There will be a courtyard
and that will be adjacent to the canopy in
between Alice Paul and David Kemp." The
lounge will be on the second floor with a
view of Alice Paul's courtyard. Students
will enjoy additional lounge space with
the bridge connection. However, there
will be no double-floor lofts like the ones
in Alice Paul.
Swarthmore's warm weather ensured
the efficiency of the construction over the
summer. Mike Boyd explained the technical aspects that the construction team
completed. He said, "We put in some temporary paths and installed some underground utilities that will go to the new
building, chill[ed]
water and electrical.
We also started putting in storm sewers.
We finished the second floor structure
and started putting up stone veneer; the
stone is the facade of the building."
There will also be two paved pathways
for students to walk from Mertz and Alice
Paul straight to Magill Walk since the
pathway between the buildings is being
blocked due to construction.
Just after the rush of students moving
in during mid-August, several students
sent in complaints regarding the on-going
...

construction.
Soon after, Alice Paul and Mertz
Resident Assistants approached housing
coordinator Liz Derickson 'Ol about the
issues that had been brought about by

tion noises."

The schedule change was difficult on
the contractors as well. "During the summer we started at 6 in the morning. Now
that we are back into the school year, [we]
start at 7:30
contractors normally start
anywhere from 6:30 to 7 and it's a cultural
change for construction to start later,"
Boyd said.
"Students were quite vocal about that,"
Derickson said. However, "Mike Boyd
was a very strong advocate in this process
and [he was] eager to be responsive to student concerns." E-mails went to Mertz and
Alice Paul residents in August informing
them of the construction, and Boyd sends
weekly updates on the construction.
...

Another issue was the process of moving in for incoming freshman and returning students. Part of the problem was the
staggered move-in days over "three
weeks" said Derickson. "Parking was a little tricky, for more than one car. On freshman move-in day, the tight turnaround
was more difficult."

Civil Engineers event. Below: Senior Project Manager Mike Boyd explains to Kelleher
and Chris Caruso details regarding the structure and design of David Kemp.

Boyd also bought laundry carts in
August, which proved to be very helpful.
Derickson said that the carts were positioned around Alice Paul, although they
migrated around campus to help students
travel on the walkway. They "were helpful, and will continue through the years."

Carts were first introduced as a solution
for move-in during the construction of
Alice Paul in 2002.
Derickson said that despite the construction, more students wanted to live in
Alice Paul and Mertz this year. Allen, who
blocked into Alice Paul, claimed that the
construction did not deter his group's
decision to block there.
"We would have wanted to block there
either way. Alice Paul was a clear first
choice with or without construction, for a
sophomore," Allen said.
Munoz herself was placed into Mertz
off of the housing waiting list.
"I think I've gotten used to [the noise]
by now," Munoz said. "It was a little noisy
because I couldn't hear the music playing
that I liked in the morning
but now it's
...

gotten a lot better."

15 minutes before the event, students
and faculty were already waiting in the
Fragrance Garden. The bees droned in
and out of the lavender in rhythm with
the percussion, and many feet were tapping as Yerbabuena warmed up. The band
members, who joked and teased one
another, made the entire event seem like
a family reunion.

Some students were notified by e-mail

Fellow Enlace Co-president Grace

outside of the IC and "getting Latinos
involved and [setting] up the groundwork
for collaboration with outside groups."
Through Latino Heritage Month, Cornejo
said, "I hope the campus can get a better
sense of how much diversity there is
behind the label of 'Latino,' as well as
bring to light several issues many
Latinos struggle with and how the Latino
community works to ameliorate them."
Two more events took place on
Sunday, Sept. 16: El Asadito, a cookout on
Parrish Beach with Peruvian and
Venezuelan food and a film screening of
"Central do Brasil." Lopez, who stopped
by the cookout, said, "I enjoyed a meal
outside Sharpies. Good music, yummy
food. I just wish more people would have

Barajas is looking forward to the

STUDENT SPOTLIGHT ON JUAN VICTORFAJARDO
most ofhis time in Havana and Caracas talking to the artists themselves. The artists
were eager to show their work and spoke
candidly with Fajardo. As he studied the
murals, he discovered two vastly different
cultures surrounding public art in Havana

and Caracas.
Nelson Santana, a world famous muralist
served as Fajardo's artistic guide in Caracas.
Santana and other muralists illustrate global themes which serve as a daily reminder of
worldwide issues. In Caracas, most murals
are done by individual artists like Santana
who are funded by their community and
work independently. According to Fajardo,
this allows for a vibrant artistic culture
because the artists are not interested in
being in a gallery. Instead, they strive to "get
society thinking."

Cheryl Tse The Phoenix

When Juan Victor Fajardo 'O9 went home
to Caracas over winter break last year, he
was surprised to see new political murals
adorning the city walls, many expressing
anti-American sentiment. Impressed and
intrigued, he began to wonder what people
thought of these murals. With the help of
Sociology and Anthropology professor
Miguel Diaz-Barriga, Fajardo attained a
Eugene M. Lang summer research fellowship and traveled to Havana, Cuba and
Caracas, Venezuela during summer. Over
3,000 pictures and the countless hours spent
interviewing artists later, Fajardo emerged
questioning the complicated relationship
between art, "the people" and revolution.
"My basic interest was to see how ... the
Cuban revolution and the Bolivarian
Revolution in Venezuela are using art and
using artists
to touch the tissue of society," Fajardo said. To this end, Fajardo spent
...

"In Cuba, it's different because most of
the murals are sponsored and organized by
the government," Fajardo said. Instead of
allowing freelance artists to paint murals,
the Cuban government sponsors a muralist
brigade known as the Brigada Muralista
Jose Marti. Artists are given a theme and
are expected to paint accordingly. The quotations come from political leaders such as
Fidel Castro and Jose Marti and usually convey patriotic sentiment. According to
Fajardo, these murals are meant to "take art
to the people. That is their power."
Fajardo is currently wrestling with the

question of whether Havana'smurals are art

or government propaganda. He believes that
"whenever you are creating something, you

are creating art." But, can an artist be truly
inspired by a government command?
Propaganda or not, people in Havana and
Caracas have responded positively to the
murals. Fajardo attributes this reaction to
the fact that the public is granted input. He
said the muralists will confront people and
say, "Listen, we are going to paint a mural in

people, but art "from the people."
Fajardo stressed that art from the people
can also come in the form of vandalism. He
described a scenario in which a mural of
Che Guevara was painted and found a week
later to have the word "murderer" scrawled
across it. Vandalism of this sort is not negative or destructive. According to Fajardo,
vandalism creates a necessary and unique

The Riot Group examines war in 'Pugilist Specialist'
BY SUNNY COWELL

scowelll@swarthmore. edu

On Friday and Saturday, Sept. 14 and 15,
The Riot Group performed "Pugilist
Specialist," a play by Adriano Shaplin. In
the play, four well-trainedUnited States soldiers are ordered to assassinate a Middle
Eastern leader. This thought-provoking
play addresses issues ranging from the mishandling of modern political assassinations
to the controversy surrounding race and
gender integration within the U.S. military.
The play features Lieutenant Stein played
by Stephanie Viola, Lt. Studdard (Drew
Friedman), Lt. Freud (Adriano Shaplin) and
Colonel Johns (Paul Schnabel).
The first scene opens with the four characters sitting on two benches on a dark
stage with the spotlight focused on Lt. Stein,
the outspoken feminist. Stein expresses her
loneliness as one of very few women in the
military and on the mission. Stein says,
"Punctuality is my feminism," to express
how her habit of arriving early is a way to
exercise some form of control and to prove
her abilities as the only female on the military mission. Lt. Studdard then joins Stein
on the bench. At first, the two engage in an
awkward conversation with many pauses,
but they go on to discuss gender, racial integration and surveillance in the marines.

They are joined by the blunt and humorous
Lt. Freud who adds witty comments.
Next, Colonel Johns informs the soldiers
that they must interpret documents and
execute their target, including a 16-hour
flight in the desert, in only 12 hours.
Meanwhile, subtle sounds of piano music
portray the anxiety associated with the task
the soldiers face. Electronic sounds of chaos
signal the scene change to the mess hall,
where the soldiers talk about topics ranging
from the sustenance of hot dogs, seduction
and the evaporation of their enemies.
Lt. Stine becomes emotionally invested
in the political and social conflicts associated with their mission. As a result, the
Colonel worries about her loyalty. He makes
the statement, "I'd rather be alive and ignorant than be dead and sensitive to the fact,"
a possible jab at how the U.S. military justifies carrying out assassinations and other
dangerous missions. The scene proceeds to

RACHEL SUGAR

Your Secretary Is Not a Toy
I have what I think is a very poor sense of smell. Perhaps
it was a sickly and stuffy-nosed childhood that stunted my
potential as an aromatic connoisseur; perhaps it was my
parents' zealous dedication to unscented products ("I just
don't get it: why would anyone light a scented candle," grumbled my mother to my six-year-old self in a home furnishing
store, "unless they were covering up the smell of marijuana?"). Except for an awkward gift of Victoria's Secret
Strawberries and Champagne lotion I got for my 13th birthday, I've spent most of my life a "Dove unscented" girl.
There are scents I like, of course, strong, unsubtle strains
that associate directly with tangible things: gasoline, pears,
smoke, chocolate chip cookies. The thing is, I don't actually
want to smell like a chocolate chip cookie, a pear or a gas station parking lot. Diptique makes what I think is a really nice
fragrance that smells exactly like a sugar cookie, but a fragrance-sawy friend assured me I don't (or shouldn't) want to
smell like that, either.
Under his tutelage, I went on a summer quest to develop

aromatic taste. We took field trips to specialty boutiques,
department stores and www.basenotes.com. Aggressive
salespeople assaulted me with questions, assuring me in
thick accents that this or that scent was "very exclusive,"
quickly shpritzing three or four different fragrances onto
paper strips and demanding to know which I preferred. A
deer caught in the heavily perfumed headlights, I deferred to
my companion, causing massive confusion among the
Macy's staff as to the exact nature of our relationship
she have her own opinions?").
If I was going to develop taste, it was going to have to be
in a less threatening environment. We retreated to boutiquestyle stores, where the salespeople seemed to have little
interest in the exclusivity of my choices and left us to wander. The first thing to do, apparently, is to figure out what
fragrance category you're looking for. As my friend
explained it, there are five basic types: the green, the floral,
the fruity, the Oriental and the chypre (the very 1980s guide
"Fragrance Sense" subdivides these for a total of eight categories, but I'm still a beginner). For the similarly uninitiated, the breakdown goes something like this:
Greens are "fresh, brisk, clean, and sparkling;" florals
include (obviously) all flowery smells; fruity notes
pineapple, cassis, apple, peach, orange
have a sweet crispness;
Orientals are spicy, sweet and musky, hewn from resins,
vanilla beans and ground pepper; chypres are "reminiscent
of new-mown hay and lavender bouquets." It's even more
complicated, though, because any given perfume may belong
to more than one category (a green chypre, for example, or a
fruity floral). "Fragrance Sense" suggests that each individual find her "base scent" category through a number of
quizzes. I'm a fan of quizzes generally, but unable to figure
out if the skin on my wrist tasted "salty" or "lemony," I
somewhat arbitrarily decided on a preference for Orientals.
My friend, out of genuine agreement or impatience, nodded.
I wish I could say that I then found My Fragrance, that I
wear it every day and ever since my life has been glamorous
in a 1940s spy-by-day, femme fatale-by-night, sort of way. It
might have happened like that, except that perfume, it turns
out, is really expensive, and I wasn't ready to make an

Oriental (or financial) commitment. We aborted the mission.
For the moment, I'm working my way through a collection of assorted tiny vials, excerpts from my sawder friend's
collection. I wear them occasionally and totally arbitrarily. I
have a ways to go.

Fall into Olde Club's lineup
BY NICK GAW

ngawl@swarthmore.edu

Welcome to Fall 2007 season at Olde Club. This
semester's lineup is a dazzling array of great independent music, from melt-your-face-off rock to thoughtful,
innovative hip hop. This semester, more than ever
before, Olde Club will be a rocking party. The best part?
All of this great music is free with a Tri-Co ID.
Earl Greyhound is headlining this semester's inaugural show on Sept. 22. The fiery three-piece from New
York has already captured critics' and fans' ears. There
is something tunelessly "rock" about a band like Earl
Greyhound it resides in a space carved out by rock
and roll in the 1970s that remains classic today. Earl
Greyhound will melt your face and make you move. The
performance is not to be missed.
Supporting Earl Greyhound is Pora! Pora!, which is
not your typical Brooklyn quartet. Pora! Pora! matches
Earl Greyhound's ferocity and is, if anything, more
-

danceable.

If Pora! Pora! isn't your typical Brooklyn indie experience, the Oct. 6 show featuring Brooklyn's My
Teenage Stride certainly is. -That certainly is no mark
against the quintet. Their live performance promises to
be full of interactive merriment. My Teenage Stride's
MySpace indicates that the audience is a sixth member
of the band, responsible for "intermittent percussion,
lascivious onstage dancing, schadenfreude." Fair
enough.

Both Hands and Knees and Monarch will be opening
for My Teenage Stride. Hands and Knees is a Bostonbased indie band with a little country twang. Despite all
that the other bands have to offer, Monarch is poised to
be the jewel of the evening. Monarch is a beautiful collaboration of Andy Stack and Jenn Wasner, who together blend many musical talents into pure pop gems.
The Oct. 26 show features Washington Social Club,
punk-inspired rockers from the district. Washington
Social Club has had a lock on the D.C. circuit for some
time, but their latest album, "Bigger Than Your
Boyfriend," widens their appeal. Their sharp sound is
led by Telecaster-touting Evan Featherstone and the
band's front man, singer Martin Royal. Washington
Social Club will certainly get Olde Club moving with

September 20, 2007

their infectious rock and roll. The Dance Party will be
backing Washington Social Club on their visit to
Swarthmore. Similar in style to Washington Social
Club, The Dance Party will certainly do what their
name promises with their palatable, danceable rock.
On Nov. 16, Olde Club will host Malajube, the critically acclaimed band from French Montreal. Unlike

Olde Club favorites Nous Non Plus, members of
Malajube can claim a certain legitimacy to their
French-ness. But just like Nous Non Plus, they will get
Olde Club moving, if only in a different way. Malajube
has a sound defined by their melodic craftwork with a
knack for balancing simple riffs against complex vocal
and musical layered arrangements.

This semester's line up is a dazzling
array of great indepedent music,
from melt-your-face-off rock to
thoughtful innovative hip hop. This
semester, more than ever, Olde Club
will be a rocking party.
The last show of Olde Club's fall season changes
gears with Philadelphia rapper The Last Emperor on
Dec. 8. The Last Emperor writes about Philadelphia and
the state of modern hip hop with an unusual set of
images more commonly found in comic books. His love
of comics fuels the intensely narrative quality of his
work, even while not explicitly driving his lyrics. The
best part of The Last Emperor is that his creative
approach to hip hop works.
This fall's Olde Club season promises to be a great
semester of sound. The one thing that all of these acts
have in common is that they will shake Olde Club and
everyone in it. Olde Club booking director Madalyn
Baldanzi 'OB worked on one basic principle when securing this semester's acts: "I want it to be a party." With
these kinds of acts, Olde Club looks like it will be that
party.

Local Players Club is a site for sore 'Eyes'

The girl with the silver eyes is "as beautiful as
the devil and twice as dangerous," as the detective
describes her in Act L Take a hard-hitting detective with a trench coat and a pack of cigarettes.
Give him a case and then introduce a seductive
woman with silver eyes and a penchant for treachery. Add $lOO,OOO, a corpse or two, and you have a

typical 1920's murder mystery.
Directed by E. Scott Jones, "The Girl with the
Silver Eyes" is currently playing at the Players
Club of Swarthmore. Jones, who has directed several mysteries for the Players Club in the past,
says "I've always wanted to do something by my

fiction writer Dashiell Hammett."
Hammett, known for his criminal dramas, wrote
several short stories. Two of them were later
adapted by Terrence Nolen into plays.
From the film noir music playing during intermission to the detective's voiceovers, the resulting
play succeeds at capturing the feel of a true murder mystery. Hammett is "out to fool the audience," said audience member Adrienne Nussdofer.
She has read several of his literary works and
believes this quality transferred to the theatrical
production.
The play is arranged in two acts. In the first,
the detective (Henry Newkirk) finds himself in the
middle of a group of thieves (including the silvereyed Elvira, played by Maria Eldridge) and he
attempts to sort out what is going on while freeing
himself and foiling the bad guys' plot. In the second act, the detective attempts to sort out a case
involving a missing girl and encounters the
treacherous Elvira from the previous case.
Add various other characters, including an elderly couple who just might have something
besides a tea party planned for unwanted guests,
and a slightly crazed poet and you have "The Girl
with the Silver Eyes."
favorite

The reactions to the play were mostly positive.
"Sometimes [plays] you've never heard of can be
the best," said audience member Anne Cressman.
Audience member Mary Tammany added, "I don't
think I've ever seen a bad [play put on by the

Player's Club]."
I found the play to be interesting and well-done.
If you like the mystery genre, then I would definitely recommend seeing
this production.
However, it does follow the typical murder mystery plot line and thus some of the punchlines and
plot twists can be anticipated long beforehand.
Nevertheless, Hammett has included several unexpected twists that keep the story interesting and
the characters are well-played. In general, the acting was good and the performance was very

smooth.
"I was impressed by how seamlessly they
merge the scenes," Nussdorfer said, and I agree
with her sentiment. Indeed, there were a total of 14
scene changes, each of which was done smoothly
with a rotating circular stage.
The Players Club of Swarthmore will be performing "The Girl with the Silver Eyes" on the following dates: Sept. 21, 22, 28, 29 and 30 at 8 p.m.,
and on the 23rd at 2 p.m. The Players Club is located at 614 Fairview Avenue, a short walk from campus.

Other plays that will be performed in the near
future include "Assassins," directed by Joseph P.

Southard, which will play from Oct. 18 to Nov. 3
and "A Christmas Story," directed by James
Carroll, which will play from Nov. 23 to Dec. 15.
Student prices are $8 for a play, $lO for a musical
and adult prices are $l5 dollars for a play, $22 for a
musical.
"The Girl with the Silver Eyes" has all the trappings of a good murder mystery, so if you're in the
mood to watch some 1920s style detective work,
you might want to set aside a few hours and head
down to the Players Club of Swarthmore. It's a relatively cheap, fun way to spend the evening.

Don't take a ride on the predictable '3:10 to Yuma'

agraberl@swarthmore. edu
The western remake "3:10 to Yuma" feels
a bit like the male's answer to the romantic
comedy
predictable genre film with less
kissing and more waving about of .manly
bits, by which of course I mean guns. And
like many romantic comedies, "3:10 to
Yuma" feels a bit phoned in. The clunky dialogue, the male bonding (insert your subtext
here), the great, stubbly, unwashed-ness of it
it hits most of the western checklist
all
without doing much to better it.
Not that "3:10 to Yuma" is unwatchable
by any means
if nothing else, the manful-

ly stubbly and unwashed presences of
Russell Crowe (slightly pudgy, slightly
squinty), Christian Bale (slightly mangy,
slightly preachy) and Peter Fonda (slightly
geriatric, slightly awesome) conquer that
frontier with ease. And their acting isn't bad
either. But director James Mangold doesn't
quite know what to do with what he's got,
which is a bucket o' talentand an underused
location to match. One wants such a film to
be great (especially because mere genre
westerns have gone out of vogue) and
Mangold settles for
not unwatchable.
Crowe is cast in the old Glenn Ford role

esteem, father and son set off to deliver
Wade to the prisoner train to Yuma, bolsteredby Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Dallas Roberts

and Kevin Durand, who round out the posse
as Those Useless Guys Who Get Killed.
When they feel like it, Mangold and his
posse of writers (Halsted Welles, Michael
Brandt and Derek Haas raise your hand if
you think this is too many writers for a
remake) throw a bone to the themes that
make westerns more than Cowboys and
Indians: the isolation of the American heartland, Dan's social alienation as a Union veteran left out to dry and, lest we forget, the
somewhat dubious nature of the characters'

relationships

realism. Instead, Sachs uses what White describes as
"painterly techniques" that force her audience "to not
always trust photographs
She's trying to use more writing or painting techniques to say there is subjectivity in the
camera."
Even more curious is the fact that, like the title ofher lecture suggests, hardly any war footage appears in her films.
"It's about the residue of war," Sachs said. "That I actually
don't show people compromised or bloodied [forces] the
viewer to bring your own archive."
Sachs used her situated perspective in the present when
she went to Vietnam in 1994 to shoot "Which Way is East," a
film which White said "made a really big impression on me."
"This isn't just tourist imagery of Vietnam
this is not
war imagery of Vietnam, where that sort of stands in for an
American perspective on Vietnam, this horrific war photography," White said of the film. "The imagery is positioned by
the voice and very subjective, very situated, very personal."
Illuminating subjectivity is crucial to Sachs' documentaries. "Quite a few of my projects are grounded in a first
person perspective so I don't claim to be all-knowing," Sachs
said. "I'm also interested in how a person can participate in
the witnessing of the war without claiming objectivity
where it's so openly subjective, not just that you side one
way or the other, but you're really thinking about the experience and allowing for your own vulnerability."
Sachs' film "States of Unßelonging" documents her correspondence with her Israeli friend Nir Zats and follows
Sachs to Israel and Palestine. "Ireally made it pretty evident
that I was scared, I wasn't sure that I wanted to go there to
make a film for political reasons, so I express my own
ambivalence." It's a major departure from traditional photojournalism, but Sachs sees her subjectivity as an access
point for her audience. "I'm hoping that my viewers become
involved with my films because they can enter it and understand my position," Sachs said.
Sachs herself did not begin filmmaking until her late
twenties. As an undergraduate, Sachs majored in history
and was immersed in painting and poetry. "Film kind of

the War ... Again," a compilation of shorts decrying the Iraq
War, one of which was filmed by Sachs.

"It's about the residue of war. That I
don't show people compromised

Experimental filmmaker

"Since the mid-19905, I've been making films that explore
the relationship between war and the creative
process...what happens when people find themselves in a
war situation and how that in turn can be articulated
through imagination," Sachs said.
Although war is a unifying thread in all of her films, not
much else is consistent throughout her body of work. Her
films' subjects have ranged from the Bosnian War to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Her films are hardly the conventional documentaries that rely heavily on the pretense of

ing and painting and poetry," Sachs said. "The great thing
about filmmaking is that it's very much about the written
word, and it's also 'this fantastic license to go ask anybody
you want a question and just pursue it, knock on doors [like]
a quintessential photojournalist, and then to interpret it in a
very personal and perhaps very poetic way."
White hopes that Sachs' lecture will contribute to a more
communal filmmaking environment in Swarthmore. "[The]
experimental film culture has in some ways waned
That
sort of nurturing of culture, of people who are committed to
experimental film and to using small format Super 8 or
16mm or video ... that's something that I really want to keep
alive at Swarthmore. Without that kind of history and context of a culture of sharing experimental film language, people don't have the tools to understand it or to think of it as a
way of potentially making art or making political work."

In keeping her work personal and experimental, Sachs
opens the discourse ofher films to her viewer. "They're not
being educated; they're being charged with thinking very
directly with me and try to come up with their own decision," Sachs said. "I don't offer answers. But, I offer, I hope,
titillating questions."

"Sopranos" mobsters grab the loot at 2007 Emmys
BY ALEXANDRA ISRAEL
aisraell@swarthmore.edu

I almost thought that the Emmys were
going to redeem themselves this year. Not
completely, of course, because nothing
could make up for snubbing critical darling "The Wire" as well as both "Lost" and
"Big Love" - the two best shows on television if you ask me
but I thought they
might at least atone for snubbing
Elizabeth Mitchell's criminally good turn
as "Losf's conniving, sympathetic Juliet.
Granted, Ryan Seacrest's sleep-inducing opening monologue was even worse
than his continual I'm-not-gay-you're-gay
banter with Simon Cowell, and Ray
Romano did his best to detract from the
award he was actually presenting with an
unfunny, self-indulgent monologue, but
the Family Guy opener was awesome.
Terry O'Quinn won "Lost" its (shamefully) one and only award of the night, wearing a hot-pink shirt and sparkly tie
nonetheless! Helen Mirren proved, as
usual, that she is wittier and classier than
the
entire
cast
of
"Desperate

and

leaf blower.

Then came that god-awful musical tribute to "The Sopranos," which was quite
possibly the worst blend of medium and
subject matter that I have ever seen; the
horrifically inappropriate banter between
Brad Garrett and Joely Fisher (honestly,
the cast of "Everybody Loves Raymond"
almost got me to forget that I ever liked
the show); and, lastly and most inexplicably, "Boston Legal" star James Spader's

win for Best Actor in a Drama Series over
the incomparable Hugh Laurie in "House"
and Tony Soprano himself, James

Gandolfini. Even the awkward joke that
Neil Patrick Harris made about Hayden
Panetierre's coming-of-legal-age was
preferable.
That being said, some of the awards
did go to worthy contenders. Yes, I think
that Michael Emerson's devious Ben
Linus deserved the Best Supporting Actor
award over Terry O'Quinn's tortured, formerly paralyzed John Locke, but
O'Quinn's performance is certainly good
enough to merit a statue.

The show itself also had its moments.

the cast of that show created a great
underhanded tribute to Steve Carell's success while Ricky Gervais, the creator of
the original British version of the show,
won a well-deserved award for his work
on "Extras;" I've only seen one episode of
the show, but that half-hour of television
was funnier than an entire season of '"Til
Death," the show that spawned the aforementioned nauseating exchange between
Brad Garrett and Joely Fisher. And then
there was "The Sopranos."
It was pretty much foreordained that
the last season of HBO's

prize for Best Drama Series.

ovation paralleled the one that the cast of
"Roots," an equally groundbreaking tele-

vision event, received when they stood
together earlier in the telecast to cele-

series. Those two moments best represented what the Emmys sometimes lose

ADAM DALVA
The Real Old Prospector
The advantages of going to a small liberal arts college
are repeatedly spelled out in our admissions catalogues
and explanations to incredulous uncles about why someone with a 4.3 GPA would turn down Harvard for an allgirls school in upstate New York, but despite the repetitive
tropes of class sizes and personalized attention that we all
know by heart, there is one facet of Swarthmore's size that
becomes more glaring as the years go by: This school is
really freaking small.
As a first-year, Swat seemed to loom threatening all
around me, full of strangers, mixed drinks, hippies and
debates about Foucault, a swirling world that was disorienting even when I wasn't blindfolded. Nobody knew who
I was, and usually it seemed like no one ever would. Today,
even though the hippie terror does still darken an occasional afternoon, a different kind of sanity threat has
proven to be more overwhelming than those early days of
key chains and tucked in shirts. Now instead of not knowing much about anything, I know far, far too much about

everything.
Reading The Phoenix last week was even more frightening than usual, but the cover story and the Dahl/Grimm
collabo were not what led me to surreptitiously abandon it,
half-read and covered with succulent honey mustard,
under my Sharpies chair. No, what caused me to shuffle
my feet with consternation (and subsequently trip for the

Look, I am probably the biggest fan of Internet delay in
the world, but at the risk of old fogeyism, it seems more
than a little ridiculous to know 300 people's favorite
movies before even arriving on campus. With the rise of
Facebook, which started so innocently in the fall of first
year as a simple, elitist service that took about one minute
a week to maintain, we are now all able to know everything there is to know about most people at this school. It
is essential, and it has changed what it is like to be here.

Facebook groups, sports teams and declared majors to find

Large protests often spectacular, but rarely effective
For about four hours
last Saturday, the headline on the digital front
page of the New York
Times was: "Dozens
Arrested in Antiwar
Protest Near Capitol."

By Sunday morning,

JOSH COHEN

I Got the Bullets

the media was reporting that the actual number of protesters arrested was about 190, but by
Sunday
night
the
protest was virtually
forgotten. The debate
about the number and
presence of US troops
in Iraq continued to
make headlines, but a
glance at a dozen or so

articles did not show a single reference to Saturday's
especialprotest, as if it hadn't happened at all. It is hard
not to reach the
ly if you believe in the antiwar message
conclusion that antiwar protests in their current incarnation are anything but well-meaning exercises in futility.
Rewind, for a moment, to Feb. 15,2003, which, according
to the un-ironic Guinness Book of World Records, is the date
when Rome became famous for having the largest antiwar
rally ofall time. I remember skipping Stat I to protest with
some of my friends in New York City's Union Square. It was
excitingly reaffirming to hear about so many people taking
to the streets that day, and I took it on faith that if the war
happened anyway it wasn't because of any failure on my
part.

Two years later, I read an article in the Socialist Worker
which, yes, I subscribed to in high school that cited the
British writer lan McEwan's novel, "Saturday," which is set
on Feb. 15, 2003, to make this very argument in light of the
then full-fledged war. The writer claimed that the fact that
novel was set on "the day of the great march against the war
in Iraq is an illustration of how deeply the antiwar movement has rooted itself in public consciousness." The point of
the protest wasn't to actually stop "Bush's imperial project," he said, since that would be impossible, but to provide
the "necessary visibility" that would
well, make us visible.
The truth is that the antiwar movement has been characterized by this stubbornly unimaginative philosophy, and
it has been incredibly self-defeating, if not delusional in
particular with regards to its emphasis on "visibility" and
the accompanying affirmation that large-scale antiwar

protests are inherently worthwhile. Today, it's worth pointing out that the main character in "Saturday" actually tries
to reconcile his antiwar position with the fact that the massive protest on the streets strikes him as a distant afterthought.

Antiwar protests in their current
incarnation are anything but wellmeaning exercises in futility.

Really, today's large-scale protest is a weak imitation of
the protests of the 60s and 70s. The nostalgia for that era's
unity and purpose contributes to the antiwar movement's
delusion, which prevents it from seeing that the evolution
from five to 500 channels has rendered the large-scale
protest impotent. In. truth, if the "the angry spirit of the
Vietnam era" was, according the lead of the New York
Times article, present at Saturday's event, it's because most
of Saturday's protesters were actually there for Vietnam,

too.

en gradual masse to breach the police barricades.
Down the road, too, you had the pro-victory, pro-troops
Gathering of Eagles, represented by Karen, John and
Rachel (their daughter) Aldin of Media, PA, who together
told the Times: "They [the antiwar protesters] don't realize
the big picture
It's not just Iraq, it's the whole Middle
East. It's not a red, blue or pink issue. It's an all-of-us issue."
You also had Lt. Col. "Buzz" Patterson, who told a mass of
Harley Davidson jackets and American flag bandanas that
we have one message for the terrorists: "We will find you

And yet it is groups like the Answer Coalition, the
umbrella group of activists that organized Saturday's event,
not yesterday's good-hearted hippie, which are really the
problem. The group's pledge, for example, is "To Stop War
and End Racism," a mistake that encapsulates the forced
attempt at a universality that was organically achieved 40
years ago. By now, I've been to too many protests where
everything is protested and nothing ends up being said.
Worse and more painfully revealing is that Answer, an
organization that sells "Resist Imperialism" Che Guevara tshirts, is at the forefront of the pacifist movement. The antiwar movement has failed not only borrowed ideas but on
unforgivably bad ones, too.
Where was I on Saturday? No one our age I know was
there, either. I don't think that this, the absence of youth
with the exception of 20-something Iraq war veterans and
is a sign of indifference. It's an indinostalgic dropouts
cation of the fact that protesting is an occupation, if not a
luxury, and that without a draft, and with the intuition that
protests don't work, it is understandable that most of us didn't cut class to road trip it to Washington. It's not justifiable,
but neither are emptily spectacular large-scale protests.

and kill you."
The cops had to keep the two groups of protesters from
fighting one another. But why were the protesters playing
to an audience of state cops and anti-antiwar protesters?
The clearest answer is that no one else was paying attention. And yet it's not the message that is wrong; it's the
means. If you looked at the photo underneath the Times'
temporary headline there was something off
besides the
fact that she was young
about the shot of the woman
being led off-stage by helmet-wearing, shield-bearing policemen: she was smiling. There's a desperate plea for attention
evident in that smile, in what went down on Saturday, that
stands in stark contrast, say, to the image of a Civil Rights
activist patiently, powerfully, simply sitting. It makes sense,
then, that the clash between the police and the protesters
erupted after the 'die-in" immediately withered: showing
up doesn't guarantee attention anymore, and the understandable but misguided impulse is to try to perform better.

Take this Saturday's "event." On one side, you had the
antiwar protesters preparing to stage a "die-in," in which
they would lay on the capitol lawn wearing signs representing killed US soldiers. You also had a few dozen protesters dressed in hoods and orange jumpsuits, milling
about and staging impromptu torture scenes in reference to
Guantanamo Bay. When the cops didn't respond, the protesters got antsy (or did the cops get antsy when the protesters didn't respond?), abandoned their stunt and decided

There will be a march and other events oh campus today

in the worthiness and necessity of today's efforts clash with
what I expressed above. For me, the anti-war position is
directed at political leaders, and calls for small-scale individual action rather than mass expressions of unity if it
intends to effect practical decision-making. Racism is a

On record(s): A changed perspective on the digitalization of WSRN
BY JONATHAN PETERS
jpetersl@swarthmore.edu

Roger Shaw, a good friend of mine and
director of WSRN this year, recently held a
meeting for the board, which I sat in on.

During his introduction he
mentioned the terabytesized hard drive we bought
last year; it's a huge piece
of equipment that could change everything

about our campus radio station.
He explained that soon, if not this year
then next, all of our station's catalog will be
digital. No more CDs, 8-Tracks, vinyl
records or cassettes all bytes. And in an
impulsive mood, I raised my hand. "Good
riddance. I can't wait to get rid of all that
-

crap."
There was a pause.

Then the communal

glaring started.
I decided to take a library stacks adventure that night after the meeting. I planned
on changing my mind, if not for the
library's sake then for my own personal
safety.

The WSRN office is Swarthmore's attic, a
repository of discarded music and press

THE PHOENIX

clippings. And now that maintenance
repainted our office beige after twenty
years of yellow, it's a mess. Desks were
moved haphazardly to the center of the
room, all of the posters were removed and
placed on the floor and records were piled

in random corners. It's hot, uncomfortable
and moldy, and there are made-at-home
beer bottles everywhere. As for lighting, it
is almost non-existent. It seems that a lumberjack- orgy took place 100 years ago and
no one bothered to clean up.
My eyes immediately fell upon a 1978
Radio Shack catalogue advertising, on its
front cover, something akin to a personal
computer. This year is special to us
because most of our equipment comes
from that year. On the top shelf of an open
filing cabinet, the applications from
Spring 1996 waved at me. I shuffled
through them. Future DJs wrote glowingly about The Cramps, Flying Saucer
Attack, Psychic TV, the Red Crayola. Were
these the bands popular then? Why
haven't I heard any of them?
Quick note: one of my favorite 1996 programs: Foody Esculence of Rocco. One DJ
wrote "just use the name Rashid [under-

lined for emphasis] in the program guide."
Scattered across the office are hundreds of
1990s applications from anonymous rock
DJs who have since graduated, held jobs
and raised families.

I planned on changing my
mind, if not for the
library's sake then for my
own personal safety.

albums from countries that no longer
exist, classic jazz, Jethro Tull records
worth hundreds, no, tens of dollars stuck
in corners of bookshelves next to the
soundtrack to Wes Craven's "Shocker."
Why can't we put this all online?
And then I stumbled upon the coffee
table in the center of the room. Lying on
the center was a Dan Crary album,
"Lady's Fancy." My first thought
who
the hell is Dan Crary? My second thought
have we forsaken Dan Crary in a digital
world, whoever the hell he actually is?

I checked out the 8-tracks next. We
have an 8-track with a station promo from
Jean Costeau. Why did Jean Costeau come

amazing?

There are playlists from September
1991 on the bulletin board with a tiny

stumbling upon anonymous
artists like Crary. It's just not possible to
replicate the work of a millennium of
mess in a bright institutional iTunes
account.
I did a quick search on the Internet. It
turns out Dan Crary is famous. Vince
Gill, host of the Country Music Awards in
the 19905, worked with him on the album.
His fiddler, Byron Berline, is integral to
Bob Dylan's 1970s sound. Crary has a website and a Wikipedia page.

Dialogue crucial

by

sam

Bolivia

Who would've ever guessed that a beverage, originally intended to
be a patent medicine, could stir up so much controversy? Indeed the
argument over whether or not Swarthmore should support Coca Cola
has been brewing for months, but just when we thought an agreement had been reached, the case was blown wide open again this
time by the Board of Managers. Yet while the Board of Managers
appears to be an untouchable force to be reckoned with, students do
have a way of getting their voices heard and their apparent unwillingness to do so is indicative of a much larger problem.
Every Sunday at 3p.m., the officers of Swarthmore's Student
Council meet in Parrish parlors for what should be a meeting that is
-

-

open to anyone and everyone. Upon first glance, though, it would
hardly seem that way; usually, the only outside attendees to these
meetings are reporters from campus publications. With all the controversy that surrounded last semester's elections, wherein current
President Peter Gardner 'OB narrowly won his election over None of
the Above, it would make sense for students to have a heightened
interest in Student Council. Unfortunately, though, it seems as
though all the concerns and hype surrounding the organization last
semester has since fallen to the wayside. Since the purpose of the
Student Council is to listen to, and later voice, student concerns, it is
troubling to know that few are coming forth to inform the Council
about important issues on campus at these meetings. Little can be
changed if those with the means of pursuing these changes are left to
blindly make decisions without hearing from the people they represent.
In the past, The Phoenix has criticized Student Council for failing
to publicize their meetings and for keeping an unhealthy distance
from the campus community. But with the extended outreach that
the organization has made this year, the fault no longer lies in the
hands of our leaders, but rather with us, the students of Swarthmore
College. Yes, Student Council should continue to advertise their
meetings and update the student body on their latest projects, but
students need to do their part, too, by actively following these developments.
Take, for instance, the current investigation into the possible reinstallment of Coca Cola products on campus. Though the names of
the members of the Board of Managers are public, all of their meetings are closed and most of their decisions are largely irreversible.
Most of the members live out of state and are graduates of years past,
who may or may not keep up with the latest concerns of the student

population as represented by student-run organizations or publications. The only two students allowed into these meetings as
observers are the Student Council President and Vice President. In

Peter Gardner and Sam Asarnow 'OB, we have ambassadors who can
voice our concerns to the governing body of our college
but we
need to let themknow what these issues are, first.
In an editorial last week, The Phoenix emphasized the need for
communication between the administration and its students in order
to create a heightened sense of safety. Now, it seems as though the
problem is a lack of communication between students and their representatives. And without that dialogue and willingness to approach
those equipped to make change, the problem at hand is no longer just
safety, but unity as well.

Board jeopardizes student activism
BY SARAH ROBERTS AND ANNA KASTNER
Sarah.Jan.Roberts@gmail.com and
akastnel@swarthmore.edu
No matter where your brand loyalties lie, the
possibility that the Board of Managers will reinstate our contract with Coca-Cola
has huge implications for anyone

OP-ED

who cares about how decisions

are made here at Swarthmore. If
the Board reverses the College's decision, it sends
the message that no matter what decision-making
process students and the administration go
through, the final decision could be reversed by
the Board.
This is not to say that the Board of Managers

doesn't care about students—they spend a lot of
time and a lot of money to make Swarthmore a
really great place. However, the fact is that the
Board only meets a few times a year and does not
usually come into contact with a lot of students.
While the Board clearly has an important role in
the way the College functions, Board members
often have a very different understanding of
issues on campus than students or administrators
do.

At the same time, the decision-making process
that ended with Swarthmore cutting its contract
wasn't a particularly good model either. Instead
of any institutionalized, transparent process, most
issues like this get decided after several years of

meetings between campaign members and the

administration.

Decisions need to be made in a
way that is transparent to the
entire community, includes
student voices, and has a clear
and standard procedure.
Students often don't know what avenues to go
through to have their voices heard, and it can be
incredibly time-consuming to get concrete information about costs and timelines from the administration. On the reverse end, it's time-consuming
for the administration to have countless meetings
with every student group who wants to change
something at Swarthmore, and it's frustrating for
the Board of Managers when decisions like this
are made without consulting them first.
But, although the original decision-making
process was flawed, it does not mean that the
Board of Managers would fix the process by reinstating Coke. Decisions need to be made in a way
that is transparent to the entire community,
includes student voices and has a clear and standard procedure.
The issue of how to fairly and efficiently make
decisions about social responsibility at
Swarthmore is complicated, but decisions should
September 20, 2007

definitely involve more of the community than the
Board of Managers alone.
One possible solution would be to utilize the
plan for a new committee drafted last year by the
Lang Center to deal with student initiatives
involving socially responsible purchasing like the
issue of Coca-Cola or cage-free eggs. This committee would be institutionalized so that future ethical purchasing decisions will be made in an efficient and transparent way involving members of
the College at all levels.

Although the original decisionmaking process was flawed, it
does not mean that the Board
of Managers would fix the
process by reinstating Coke.
For those of you who weren't here for the
entire campaign (or somehow managed to avoid
hearing about it for three years), here's the brief
story of the Kick-Coke campaign:
The group
formed on campus in spring 2005 as part of an
international campaign. Kick-Coke proposed that
Swarthmore cut its exclusive contract with Coca-

Cola until a neutral third-party investigation
exonerated the corporation of its alleged labor
rights abuses in Colombia and environmental
abuses in India.
After a lengthy series of meetings between
Kick-Coke, certain faculty members and members
of the administration, the College drafted a letter
to Coca-Cola calling for an independent investigation into past and present abuses and threatened
to cut its contract if sufficient progress was not
made.
In October 2006, the College cut its contract
because no progress had been made with the
investigation. After this decision was made, the
College continued dialogue with Coca-Cola about
the possibilities of an investigation and used the
potential of its purchasing power as leverage to
attempt to convince the corporation to undergo an
independent investigation. One concern the Board
of Managers has expressed is that we do not have
enough information to prove that Coke is guilty,
so perhaps a reasonable course of action seems to
be to wait for the results of the International
Labor Organization investigation, then reinstate
the contract if Coke is proven innocent.
Regardless of your soda preferences, the
Board's decision to reevaluate a decision made in
partnership by students and the administration
would create a precedent that would potentially
jeopardize other decisions that the College makes.
It is important to voice your concern, not only
about the issue of Swarthmore's contract with
Coca-Cola, but about the lack of transparency and
student voice in College decision-making processes in general.

Kick Coke argument needs stronger proof

LAUREN MENDOZA

We Need to Talk

28,
Sept.
On
Swarthmore's Board of
Managers will review
the College's decision to
discontinue their contract with Coca-Cola.
The decision was based
on allegations of misconduct on Coca-Cola's
behalf put forth by Kick
Coke, a student run
group. Some board members now feel that the
decision was made in
haste. Because an equal
quantity contract with
Pepsi costs the college
over twice as much
($26,000 more), the board
is strongly considering

reinstating their contract

with Coke.
The campus is divided over this issue. While some are
appalled that Swat would support Coke's corrupt, dehumanizing practices, others, like myself, are annoyed that a
group would go through so much trouble just to remove
some soda fountains from the dining hall. These annoyances were furthered when it became clear that Kick Coke
failed to provide hard evidence of their allegations. It now
looks like those same soda fountains might be making an
encore appearance due to monetary savings and popular
demand.
For a long time I resented the group, not because I
thought they were a self-righteous group that took themselves too seriously, but because I detested the inferior
taste of Pepsi. But after a semester my taste buds adapted,

and I even began to appreciate water. I stopped resenting
Kick Coke, and since they had nothing left to complain
about, the hype about Coke died down and all memory I
had of them dissolved. But now I find myself offended on a
new level. Kick Coke made the college go through all this
trouble and spend all this extra money on a substitute
soda, and for what? To end up right back where we start-

did I lose sleep over drinking an occasional
refreshing ice-cold Coke that could be tainted with
immorality and scandal, but I now have to listen to the
same argument again.
I understand that Coke could indeed, and probably does
run a corrupt franchise. I am also not ignorant enough to
believe that every other big corporation isn't exactly the
same. I'm sorry Kick Coke, but Pepsi is not the answer. As
long as we are paying corporations for a service or product, chances are that our money is helping them screw
over somebody somewhere. My main problem with Kick
Coke isn't that they went through a hell of a lot of trouble
fighting for something that will probably go unchanged,
but that their battle didn't need fighting in the first place.
In the process they caused the college inconvenience and
monetary loses. And when you look at the big picture,
what is there to show for it?
Ed? Not only

Not only did I lose sleep over
drinking Coke that could be
tainted with immorality and scandal,
but I now have to listen to the same
argument again.
...

Swarthmore is a place where students are well aware of
their social responsibility. I personally am proud to be part
of a school whose students are so committed to fighting for
their principles. Swarthmore has an excellent reputation
for being aware of the changes that need to be made in our
society. Swarthmore Sudan, who tirelessly raises money
and support for the end of genocide, the Katrina Relief
Group, who has made trips to New Orleans during their
academic breaks to work with aid organizations and
countless other student run groups all contribute to this
well deserved reputation. These groups motivate their
peers to donate blood, bone marrow, time and money to
help out the sick, the homeless and the dying. And then

there is Kick Coke, the free advertisement for Pepsi, which
got Coke removed from campus so that maybe the corporate bigwigs up at Coke might possibly stop to reason the
next time they hypothetically think about doing something
unethical. Because Sharpies doesn't have the time or
resources to brew their own line of soda we will just have
to go with the flow. If you don't agree with Coke's policies,
don't drink it. Don't force your beliefs, or your Pepsi, down
my throat.
A recent article in the Daily Gazette quoted a Kick Coke
member who said, "Our burden is not to directly evidence
charges of rights violations. That is the burden of an investigation
one which we have not seen come to fruition."
IfKick Coke didn't get "direct evidence" of Coke's alleged
abuses and an investigation was never conducted, then
aren't these accusations just assumptions? How am I supposed to be convinced that this cause is worth everything
it is putting the college through, if the people fighting for
it can't prove that it's worth the struggle?
Do not assume that I will agree with what you are doing
just because you have a noble reason for doing so. Being
noble isn't enough to make a difference in society. You
need to pick your battles carefully, have your facts straight
and be ready to put your name on the line for what you
believe in. Don't back down claiming that the burden of
getting hard evidence to back up your cause is someone
else's. You are the prosecutor, so show me some proof or
take your petition somewhere else.
If there is no evidentiary support for whatKick Coke is
trying to prove, then let's let the board members decide
what's best for the college. If Swat can save $26,000 by
using Coke instead of Pepsi, then let them so that little
Johnny can get some extra financial aid, or so the campus
staffmembers can get a nice bonus this Christmas or anything else that the board members decide to do with the
mpney. Or, if the board decides it's in the College's best
interest to stick with Pepsi, then I am all for it, as long as
they have a good reason. It's important that as ethicallysensitive students we make sure our cause will do more
good than harm, and if it doesn't, what's the point?

Making money and making change not mutually exclusive
BY BRIAN TOMASIK

tomasil@swarthmore.edu
When 'freople talk about 'careers that
make a difference," they usually have in
mind jobs at nonprofit organizations, advocacy groups, disadvantaged
school districts, medical
research laboratories and
the like. It seems quite natural, for instance, that someone concerned
with animal suffering in factory farms
would work for the Humane Society or the

Ufl

Humane Farming Association, while someone who wants to address global hunger
might join Bread for the World or Food First.
One factor easily overlooked is the fact
that these organizations have limited budgets, so that if you're hired as, say, a policy
researcher at Oxfam, then someone else
won't be. Thus, the 'difference" that you
make to the world by your work is only the
amount by which you're more effective and
hard working than the other person would
have been.
In some cases, these differences of effectiveness may be large. For instance, a
fundraiser who is significantly more persuasive than the person who would have been
hired in his place might bring in millions of
extra dollars for an organization over time.
A medical researcher who is significantly
more talented than her peers might help
society greatly by directing her efforts

toward groundbreaking discoveries, even if
doing so means taking away grant money
that could have been used by her colleagues.
But another way to change the world that
doesn't involve being especially talented
in a particular area is to make a lot of

For instance, suppose that,
instead of working as a researcher at
Oxfam, you pursue a career at a consulting company, investment bank or corpomoney.

rate law firm.

Another way to change the
world that doesn't involve
being especially talented in

a particular area is to
make a lot of money.
After working for several years, you
might earn, say, $175,000 annually after
subtracting out taxes and costs of living,
assuming you live as frugally as possible.
You can then donate this money to Oxfam
and allow them to hire two or maybe even
three new policy researchers. It's important to note that because you've increased
the total size of Oxfam's budget, you're
allowing additional work to be done that
wouldn't have happened
otherwise,
rather than just doing work more effectively than someone else would have.
Of course, this example is limited and
simplistic, but the idea behind it applies
quite broadly. For instance, suppose you
aren't interested in joining an established
organization but want to work as an independent activist like animal welfare campaigner Henry Spira. However, unless
you think you would be exceptionally talented, you might accomplish more by
making money and then hiring several

other people to work as activists. Spira
himself was funded by wealthy donors.
Or maybe you want to make an impact
e.g.,
by pursuing academic research
studying how to address global poverty,
finding out which animals can feel pain
or what positions we should take on
moral or religious issues. But, then again,
you could instead make money and use it
to fund grants, discovery prizes or
research institutes.
The general point should be clear: For
any activity that you feel would make a
positive impact on the world, consider
whether
after accounting for LakeWobegon bias in judging your own abiliyou could make an even bigger
ties
impact by making money and funding
other people to do the work for you.
Before, I suggested some unusual ways
that one might spend money to improve
the world, but direct giving is always an
option as well. To take an example, a $25
donation to the Fred Hollows Foundation
can prevent one person in the developing
world from going blind. Simplistically
assuming that, by pursuing a high-paying
career, you could earn a lifetime-average
after-tax and after-cost-of-living salary of
$200,000 and that you would work for 45
years, you could donate $9 million (ignoring inflation, investment returns, timevalue of charitable donations, etc.). This
would, according to naive division, prevent 360,000 cases of blindness. If, by
instead working at a nonprofit, you were
able to donate $30,000 a year, you would
have prevented only 54,000 cases of blindness (about one seventh as many).
Of course, in reality the marginal ben-

September 20, 2007

efit of each dollar donated to a single
cause may decrease, but
given the multitude of cost-effective causes out there
the marginal benefit of each dollar donated to charitable causes in general is
essentially constant. So naive division
may not be unjustified.

You could make an even
bigger impact by making
money and funding other
people to do the work for
you.
This suggests another interesting
point. If donors aim to maximize the
expected societal benefit of their donations, and if the marginal societal benefit
of each dollar donated does not decrease
(or does not decrease very much), then if
donors invest their money in the capital
markets before giving it away, they
should choose only securities with high
systematic risk (e.g., small-cap stocks)
rather than low-risk, low-return investments.
Of course, it's arguable that donating
directly to good causes is less cost-effective than, say, funding activism to encourage the government or wealthy individuals to give more to similar causes. But fig-

ures like the above represent a minimum
amount of benefit to the world that any
competing non-money-making career
plan would have to overcome.

Major League Stiff competition at Garnet Classic

■ I love

ANDREW QUINTON

Be Aggressive B

the thrill of the longball and the drama of a pennant
race, but my unavoidable
Swattie-ness (sorry,
Matt
Midkiff) also gets excited about
stuff that has nothing to do
with the sport itself. The way
baseball teaches kids team-

work, spans generation gaps and unites entire regions is very
meaningful to me, and not just because girls love that stuff. And
what better way to enjoy this side of baseball than at a clean,
accessible minor league ballpark? You guessed it
time for
another column about how the minor leagues, with their downto-earth players, reasonable salaries and family-friendly atmosphere are superior to the majors and their steroid scandals, $4
hot dogs and Pete Rose.
Yeah, right.
Don't get me wrong
minor league baseball is great. I've
seen my hometown Portland Sea Dogs (and their truly lovable
mascot, Slugger) play well over 100 times and always have a
great time. I can park my car for free, get a seat in the fifth row
for $8 and enjoy an evening of good baseball.
The majors, though, are just on another level. First, there's
the quality of play. Baseball talent is like a pyramid there are
only a very few elite players, a few more who are very, very good
and progressively more at each level as you head down the quality scale. Minor leaguers are fine ballplayers, but most of them
are as close to college players in quality as they are to the stars
of the majors. Whether you loved, hated or have never heard of
Ayn Rand, there's something about watching the best players
mankind has to offer that the minors just can't match.
Then there's tradition the place where diehards, statheads
and intellectual fans all come together. Baseball was around
before any of the other American sports, giving it a uniquely
extensive and rich history. Sometimes tradition can be painful,
us Red Sox fans saw until 2004 and Chicago Cubs fans continue
to experience today, but it brings people together in a uniquely

powerful way.
There's nothing in the rest of American sports quite like the
fanaticism of Red Sox Nation the name given to the collection
of Sox fans around the country. It's similar in intensity to how
many support their favorite NASCAR driver or high school football team, but race day and game day only come once a week,
while all 162 Red Sox games are a major event. When I go home,
90% of the people have never heard of Swarthmore, but everybody knows the Red Sox.
The minors, as they are presently set up, cannot inspire that
same kind of loyalty and interest. There are a few reasons for this;
the biggest is that rosters are controlled by the "parent" major
league club. Clay Buchholz and Jacoby Ellsbury are the darlings
ofRed Sox nation for their late-season performances with Boston,
but back in April they both played for Portland. The Sea Dogs
managed to limp into the playoffs without them before getting
beaten soundly in the first round; doubtlessly, they would have
stood a far better chance with their two best players. When the
parent club says, implicitly or explicitly, that the development of
players is most important and it doesn't really matter if a minor
league team wins or loses, it's hard for fans to disagree.
A few times every summer, I encounter a few families that
include a 10-year old wearing a Sea Dogs cap with an illegible
signature scrawled in Sharpie across the brim. Each time, I
enthusiastically ask "Hey, who signed your hat?" I am really
excited at the prospect of making a meaningful connection with
a young, diehard fan! Maybe I can share some interesting fact,
wowing this fine young man while boosting my own ego at the
same time! To my dismay, though, "I don't know" comes back
coupled with an upward glance to mom or dad, who reassures
me with, "It was the guy at the autograph table...l can't remember his name. Honey?" "Nope, me neither." Signatures of Red
Sox players may be much harder to come by, but when they do,
ijhe signer is never forgotten.

Swat Warmothers show off early skills at Sectionals
Roundup of weekend sporting events
Women's Frisbee
The Warmothers opened their fall season in style on
Saturday, going 5-1 at Division II Club Sectionals held in
New Jersey. Swarthmore faced off against teams from the
University of Delaware, Haverford College, Princeton
University, the University of Pittsburgh, Bucknell
University and the University of Pennsylvania, winning all

games but their matchup against UPitt. Despite the intensity of playing six games in one day, the Warmothers showed
promise and adapted to tournament play on the fly as the

rookies faced off against a zone defensefor the first time ever
in their game against Bucknell.
"We basically just learned how to handle it on the spot,"
co-captain Molly Robbins 'OB said. Overall, "it was a huge
learning day for everyone. We have a lot of talent, and with
that kind of performance after just one week of practice

I'm really excited to see what we can do with more."
Swarthmore will play three more tournaments during the
fall season, which serves as an opportunity to teach new
players the game and for the team to tune up before the
more serious spring season. And if this first tournament is
any indication, Swarthmore can expect great things from
its women's Frisbee squad next season. "A few of our most
solid players are abroad this fall, so when we get to our
official spring semester I have really high hopes for us,"
Robbins said.

Field hockey
The Garnet field hockey team extended its winning
streak to three games with a 3-1 victory over RandolphMacon College on Sunday, giving the team more confidence as it prepares to enter the heart of conference play
next week. Natalie Stone 'O9 followed up her hat trick in
the squad's win over Richard Stockton on Sept. 11 with the
first Garnet goal of the match, and Abigail Fischer 'OB
immediately followed it with one of her own to give the
Tide a 2-0 lead at halftime. Sara McCabe 'll padded
Swarthmore's lead with her sixth goal of the season to
open the second period, and the Garnet defense was able to
hold off the Yellow Jackets until the 64th minute, when
Lindsay Walker scored Randolph-Macon's only goal of the
game.

Throughout the game, the Garnet women were able to
stifle the Yellow Jacket offense while making repeated
attacks at the Randolph-Macon goal, taking 23 shots to the
Yellow Jackets' 10. The win improved Swarthmore's record
to 4-1 going into tonight's home contest against
Elizabethtown College at 7 p.m. Fischer acknowledges that
the team still has some work to do if it hopes to continue
its winning ways against upcoming competition. "We definitely had some communication breakdowns [against
Randolph-Macon]," she said. "We probably weren't as
much as a team as we should have been. We brought it
together near the end of the second half and I think we
learned from that game and still pulled off a win."
The Garnet will host Washington College in the first of
four straight games in the Centennial Conference on Sept.

Jays hand men's soccer loss
BY JULIAN CHENDER
jchendel@swarthmore.edu

Over the past week the men's soccer team (4-1-2,0-1-0 CC) was a model
of perseverance. On Sept. 13, the
Garnet traveled to St Mary's City,
Maryland to face St. Mary's College
of Maryland in non-conference play.
The match went into double overtime, ending in Swarthmore's favor
as captain Patrick Christmas 'OB
scored the game-winner off a header
from Michael Bonesteel 'OB at 106:47
to give the Tide a come-from-behind
victory.

Christmas' goal was his first in
three years and the second of his
career. "The first one was also a
game winner at the end of a match
at least I make 'em count," he
said in an email.
"The game against St. Mary's
was a real test for us," Christmas
said. "Making the comeback was a
confidence boost for the team. We

need to grasp that we're capable of
anything when we buckle down and
attack with pace."
Strong and steady pressure certainly helped the Tide best St.
Mary's. Swarthmore fell behind 1-0
midway into the second half when
the Seahawks scored off a corner
kick, ending Garnet goalkeeper
Ryan Sutcliffe 'oB's 340:31 minutes
without a goal against him. Morgan
Langley 'll corrected the score
some five minutes later with a blast
from 30 yards back. The score
remained 1-1 until Christmas'
match winner 30 minutes later.
"We've had several games this
season where we've come back from
a deficit of 1-0," Sutcliffe said. "It is
a reflection on the character our
team has."
Sutcliffe added that he believed
this character carried over into
Saturday, when the team hosted
the tenth-ranked team in the
nation, Johns Hopkins, at Clothier

Field in front of a crowd of 500.
Though the Tide fell to the Blue
Jays 4-0, the score doesn't do justice to the nature of the match. The
Blue Jays hardly overpowered
Swarthmore, as the score might
reflect; in fact the two teams
appeared to be pretty evenly
matched. The Tide controlled the
ball for most of the first fifteen
minutes of the match, but was not
able to get a shot off.
The Blue Jays scored first, and
"it was one of those games where
the team that gets the first goal has
a way of deflating the other team,"
Sutcliffe said. "People who see a 4-0
score think the other team has
given up but we didn't. We played
hard every minute."
"Unfortunately, we were not able
to pull through this past Saturday
against Johns Hopkins," Sutcliffe
said. "It's good we're learning these
lessons early on
the important
games are at the end of the year."

Men's rugby

Suffering through a number of injuries sustained at a
tournament the previous weekend, the Evil Buzzards fell
to Lehigh University on Saturday in a rough 69-0 loss.
Despite the lopsided score, Swarthmore was happy with
the opportunity to give the rookies a chance to take the
field, and the veterans praised the potential of their new
players. "We did well underthe circumstances, but we had
an almost half completely new lineup because we had a
bunch of injuries," captain Paul Apollo 'O9 said of the loss
to Lehigh. "Half the people on the field had never played
rugby before."
"It's a very young team," Jake Baskin 'lO said of the

Buzzards. "We have a fair number of freshmen
which
should be good for the future, but it makes for some rough
games right around now." Still, he said, the new crowd
"seems to be enjoying it and picking up on the game quickly." The Evil Buzzards will host Widener at 1 p.m. on
Saturday and are hoping for a reversal offortune from last
weekend. "Widener's a good team," Apollo said. "They beat
us in the tournament but we did better against them than
anyone else in the tournament did
I like our prospects."

Tuesday also saw the Garnet earn a national ranking of
23rd in the country, according to the National Soccer
Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) poll.
The ranking came prior to Tuesday night's game, said
Coach Todd Anckaitis, who announced the news to the
team on the bus going to Albright.

"They were calm when I told them," Anckaitis said,
adding that he was very excited about the recognition.
"And after the game I told them, Alright guys, you can celebrate now,' they said, 'Coach, we've got goals in mind.'
That's great that they're not resting on it."
It was clear from Tuesday night's game that the women
were by no means "resting" on their ranking.

Another day, another pro sports scandal
various NBA, MLB and NFL scandals of the summer happened,
sporting news has been just looking for more drama rather than
stories. Maybe that is what a
majority of consumers want to
read about these days; maybe peo-

ple are more interested in reading

ticularly incendiary to me is the
way that people seem to be writ-

Nowadays I can't even go to

the

ESPN

Web

site

(http://www.espn.go.com) without
seeing some breaking news of one

scandal or another slathered

everywhere. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but it seems like since the

24

of sports than about the actual
sports themselves. This of course
all came to light for me this past
week when my beloved Patriots
were blamed for videotaping and
stealing signals from the Jets in
their 38-14 drubbing of the aforementioned New York scrub unit.
What makes this "scandal" paring off the past success of this
franchise for an issue of cheating
that has not yet been fully investigated: The feet that people, are
claiming that the Patriot's three
Super Bowl Championships are
suspect because of this affair really burns me up. If winning three

titles could be so easy as videotaping signals then why didn't anyone think of this before?
ESPN.com reports that, "former
NFL players believe Belichick had
microphones installed in the
shoulder pads of defensive linemen so the Patriots could tape

other teams' offensive audibles
and line calls." Does anyone else
find this as ridiculous as I do? The
Patriot cheating scandal is being
turned into a conspiracy, I believe,
simply because they are on top.
Everyone in any sport always has

something to say about the guy in
first place simply because everyone wants to be him.
I think that since the Patriots
are a dominant team that has completely reloaded their offense for
this year, they began this season
under far more scrutiny thanother
teams. What would the implications be if theTEagles were caught
stealing signals? No one would
care because not only are the
Eagles 0-2, but also few sources had

high hopes for Philadelphia this
season. I think it's a shame that
people are attacking Bill Belichick
and the Patriots over these allegations, which have yet to be fully
investigated. I especially find one
ESPN columnist's juxtaposition of
Bill Belichick to Richard Nixon
during his impeachment scandal
to be in rather pOor taste. The mere
comparison of Belichick to Nixon
mars his name unnecessarily,
specifically when posing the question of whether this particular

head coach will last the entire season with the Patriots. Though it is
extremely possible
that the
Patriots will be found guilty of
committing serious violations of
NFL policy, I refuse to believe
them guilty until proven innocent.
Let us not overlook the Duke
lacrosse scandal of a few years ago.
How the tables have turned in that
case.
I personally am glad to see the
Patriots put this controversy
aside while preparing for their

game against the San Diego
Chargers, who they also annihilated 38-14. If that isn't a show of
the coaching skills of the Patriots
staff than I don't know what is.
Their ability to put the distractions out of mind while preparing
for the game at hand shows a certain amount of professionalism

and determination. This same
attitude is not the sort of thing I
would think could be found in
association with a team that
would steal signals in order to
win games. I hope that this "scandal" has lit a fire under the
Patriots and given them even
more reason to destroy every
team they face this season. If you
have caught a glimpse of New
England this season, then you
will see the football juggernaut
that is waiting to unleash the dogs
of hell upon the league. I pity the
fools who stand in their way.
