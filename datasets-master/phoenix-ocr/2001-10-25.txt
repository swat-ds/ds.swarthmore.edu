ghts chalkings, the first sign that the college's

inual Coming Out Week celebrations had arrived.
"The point of the week is to show pride in our
jeer identities and for our queer allies to show
ieir support," Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU)
sard member Jackie Aponte 'O2 said. In light of this
urpose, SQU has planned a parade of queer-orienited and queer-friendly activities, which began on
onday and will last through Saturday night with
e SAC-funded and SQU-sponsored "Sexual
ealing" party.

Born ofNational Coming Out Day, held on Oct. 11,
UU has extended the celebration of queer pride to
i entire week. As queer feminist slam poet Alix
Ison, who made her third visit to campus on
onday, said, "I love how everyone else gets a day
id you guys take a week!"
The week has no shortage of events commemoting its purpose. An open meeting of the Queerraight Alliance (QSA) on Tuesday was designed to
dcus more on how coming out relates to straight
lople," QSA member Alex Brennan 'O4 said. The
cus shifted on Wednesday, when queer and quesming students discussed issues surrounding comg out at a closed SQU meeting.
Today, there will be a student panel discussion at
50 p.m. in the Intercultural Center focusing on
eer students of color. "There are special concerns
students who are both a sexual minority and a
cial minority," Aponte said. This second annual
nel discussion on the subject aims to provide a
rum for these issues, which Aponte said are often
erlooked.
Friday night will feature a screening of "Before

Emily Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff

In response to a week-long celebration of queer
pride, homophobic slurs appeared on some signs.

The problem of respect

The campus reaction to Coming Out Week has
not been entirely positive (see story below). As
Brennan explained, "There are homophobic people
on campus and, at different times, that surfaces in
different ways."
SQU board member Jon Elmer 'O4 said this
homophobia has shown itself this year through
graffiti on various signs posted by SQU to advertise
the week. Elmer said a "Better Gay Than Grumpy"
sign was defaced with the question, "How can a
moral wrong be a civil right?"
Elmer also described a sign where someone had
scrawled the words "Die, Fags, Die," over the original slogan "My Kids Have Two Daddies and Lots of
Love." A running commentary on Sodom and
Gomorrah also appeared on many of the signs. "And
that's just a representative sample I happen to have
had in my backpack," Elmer said. "There are more."
Elmer said homophobia has occurred during past
Coming Out Weeks. But he characterized the general
campus atmosphere as accepting. Because of this,
Elmer said, many of the students who support gay
rights are quiet about the issue, as they don't realize
there are students on campus who feel differently.
To combat this during the 2001 Coming Out
Week and throughout the year, Elmer said it would
be "good for people who support gay rights to realize that other people don't and to be more vocal in
their support."

Athletic director Bob Williams informed the women's volleyball
team that their head coach Tom Bosley had been placed on administrative leave for "inappropriate conduct" on the Thursday before
fall break, members of the team said. According to team member
Sarah Donovan 'O4, Williams told the players that the college felt it
necessary to investigate the coach's behavior. Since then, the team
has played eight games with little coaching or logistical support.
Players said they had little warning of their coach's removal
before the meeting with Williams. "This came out of nowhere for
most people," said co-captain Bryn Rosenfeld 'O3. She and Christine
Hancock 'O2, the other team captain, "got a little advance notice that
something was up, although we didn't know that charges would be
filed."

But Rosenfeld and Hancock said the college's Equal Opportunity
Officer, Sharmaine LaMar, had instructed them not to comment on
the substance of the investigation.
"I can't comment because I am involved in the investigation,"
Hancock said. "It's not fair to the people who are filing charges, or
to the coach" to reveal information related to the investigation, she
said.
Williams refused to comment and directed inquiries to LaMar,
who would not comment or confirm her involvement in any investigation. "This is a confidential matter," she said.
Bosley was hired for the part-time position of head volleyball
coach on Aug. 17, after former head coach Chang Han resigned in
late July to continue coaching a club team in the area. Bosley was
previously the head volleyball coach at Eureka College, where he
was employed for the 1997-98 academic year. According to the NCAA
Web site, Bosley also formerly fulfilled head coaching responsibilities at Aurora University, Western Illinois University and Rock
Valley College, which are all, along with Eureka, located in Illinois.
In the Sept. 6 issue of The Phoenix, Williams said of Bosley: "We are

fortunate to have him. Seldom do we have interest in part-time jobs

from outside the area."
Team members had mixed opinions about Bosley's coaching, but
they generally speak favorably of him as a coach and a person.
"There were definitely advantages and disadvantages to his coaching style and personality on and off the court. He was a tough
coach," Donovan said. Hancock noted that he made chocolate chip
cookies for the team and was "very invested in Swarthmore outside

of volleyball."

"Most of the team liked him as a coach and would have happily

played for him next year," Rosenfeld said. •
The team has had a difficult time in the past

week, playing

seven

games without Bosley and dealing with both their feelings toward
his removal and some frustration with the athletics department.
"He was a friend of mine and a very essential part of the team.
It's very difficult for me to have him removed," Hancock said.
The news does not seem to have been completely shocking to
many team members. "I was not surprised, just frustrated.
Including assistant coaches, we've had eight coaches in three
years," Donovan said.
For the co-captains, the situation left logistical headaches. "We
had to deal with food, money, transportation, scheduling

threatened to remove all of the

"I don't feel they communicated with us. I don't feel they supported us at all," Rosenfeld said of the athletics department, noting
that the team has not been well informed of the process of the investigation and at one point was not told of a change in game time.
But Williams said that the department "did everything that we
knew needed to be done" in response to the situation. "We did everything we were asked to do," he said.
According to Rosenfeld, the issue goes deeper than just the current problem of Bosley's removal.
"The way they've handled the team for the last few years has
been ridiculous," she said. She specifically questioned the way the
department had handled the hiring of coaches. The former assistant
coach, Mitch Kline, has stepped up to assume the position of head

Suspicious package harmless
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

The nationwide terrorist scare hit
Swarthmore the Friday before break when a
suspicious package found near the Cunningham
fields prompted the evacuation of the women's
soccer, field hockey and rugby teams from practice as well as an investigation by the local bomb
squad. Though the package turned out to be
harmless, the incident provided a local example
of how recent fears of terrorist attacks are having an impact on everyday life.
The package, which an athlete found on Oct.
12 lying in the weeds near the Cunningham field
parking lot, was sealed with packing tape and
wrapped with a red ribbon. Its exterior markings consisted of a large white label and a baggage claim ticket addressed to John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York via Asiana Air.
The suspicious nature of the package prompted the summons of public safety to the scene,
who in turn contacted the Swarthmore police
department. "Because of the climate and the
way things are right now, rather than take a
chance, [the police officers on the scene] called
criminal investigation and the bomb squad to
investigate the package," said police chief Brian
Craig.

As an additional precaution, members of the
Swarthmore women's soccer, women's field

hockey, and women's rugby teams, who were
practicing on the Cunningham fields, were told
to finish their practices immediately and evacuate the fields.
The bomb squad was able to make a small
hole in the side of the box and determine that
there was nothing explosive inside. They then
opened the box and found it to contain a number
of informational packets and brochures for the

Global Information and Communication
Corporation.
Craig said he was not sure to whom the box
belonged or why it was left in that location.
Because the box contained no personal identification, he said, the police department would
most likely not be able to identify the owner of
the box. He said he believed whomever left it
there either meant to pick it up later, forgot
about it, or decided that he or she didn't want it.
Craig said he had no reason to believe that the
incident was the result of any malicious intentions.
Whatever the intent, the unidentified box
prompted a large response from local law
enforcement that Craig described as necessary,
especially given the current national mood.
"Fortunately, it turned out to be nothing," Craig
said, "but, in that type of situation, you have to
identify the worst case scenario and go from
there."

College recovers from $71 million
loss, but future remains uncertain

'

College officials say Swarthmore's endowment
has rebounded from the $7l million dollar loss that
occurred during the economic downturn in the
wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, but they warn that a
prolonged recession could shrink the endowment,
decrease alumni giving and increase student financial aid needs.
"We've recovered the Sept. 11 values, and we're
past theimmediate effects of the attacks, but it's hard
to know where we'll go from here," said Sue Welsh,
treasurer of the college.

recession could also have an impact on alumni giving and student financial aid needs.
"The downturn could and well might affect
alumni donations, but it hasn't yet," said Dan West,
vice president for alumni development and public

relations.
"It's a little early to tell. Any downturn in the
economy affects people's outlook, but most of those

"The stock market has largely recovered from
the attacks, and although the economy and financial markets are not as robust, we don't expect this
to have an impact on the college's budget, at least
in the short run," Welsh said.
The college's financial structure is designed to
act as a buffer against dramatic changes in the
economy, said Paul Aslanian, vice president of
finance and planning.
"If the endowment fell by 50 percent or so, we'd
certainly have to change the budget, but short of
some cataclysmic event, we won't see any shortterm change in our operating budget," he said.
"Our finances are structured to absorb this kind of

shock."

The value of the endowment was the only aspect

of calls from parents who are worried about their
family's financial situation in the wake of attacks.
"We're getting calls from people saying, 'l'm an
engineer in an engineering town, and we might
lose a government contract as a result of this recession.' I think that a lot of families are worried.
They haven't lost their jobs yet, but they're worried," said Laura Talbot, director of financial aid.
"We expect that the economic downturn from
before and after Sept. 11 will affect Swarthmore like
it affects society in general," she said.
Talbot said she would not be able to accurately
gauge the effects of the downturn until the next
batch of financial aid applications is processed.
"I expect we'll see more applications for financial aid," she said. As for the financial worries of
families who are already receiving aid, she added,
"we've certainly already seen that."

Wilderness group pilots
first-year orientation hike
BY IVAN BOOTHE
"It was incredible," Rachel Thomas 'O5
said of the wilderness experience she
shared with seventeen other first-years
over fall break. "I didn't have any backpacking experience; I had never really
been outdoors," participant Melanie
Johncilla 'O5 said, "but I had tons of fun."
The expedition, organized by the TriCollege Outdoor Orientation Program
(TrOOP), took nine first-year students
each from Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr on
a five-day hike more than 20 miles of the
Appalachian Trail in New York state.

The experience
Enlivened with good weather, the two
groups set out on Oct. 15 from opposite
ends of their route, which ran south from
Bear Mountain to near the New York state
line.

The dual groups of nine students each
had two leaders who guided the first-years
across the mountains, led team-building
activities, and taught the students how to
read maps, pitch tents, cook, and survive
in the wilderness. All four leaders were
Swarthmore students. TrOOP invited
Haverford to participate, but it declined to
do so this year.
Mike Wollenberg 'O2 described his
group's experience as "phenomenal."
Being a leader "depends a lot on the

we just sat around and talked, and I think
that was probably better," he said.
"The leaders were so good about giving
us control," Thomas said. "I was navigator the first day, which was a little scary,
because I'm really bad with directions."
Both Wollenberg and Court said they
allowed their groups to plan what route to
take each day and where to stop for water,
lunch, and sleep.

Johncilla said. "They taught us how to

aridness of the climate during autumn.
"We had to be careful about our water," he
said, "we had to be aware ofhow much we

Most of the students, Thomas said, had

the rest of their lives."
"It's definitely a positive experience," Thomas said of
the trip.
When a student is on the hike, "the world is reduced to
the next mile and where you're going to sleep," Wollenberg
said. "It's a chance to interact without distractions."
For Johncilla, who is an international student, the trip
"helped [her] see a different side of the states, being out in
nature."
"Out-of-classroom experiential education is just as
important as in-classroom learning," said Zac Steele 'O4.
Steele is one of the original members of TrOOP, and he
helped to create the impetus for a wilderness orientation program. "The woods have always provided a perfect format for making a metaphor between trying
something new and pushing oneself in a new environment."

The organization
"It was incredibly positive," Steele said. "We received
one evaluation from a Bryn Mawr student who said it was
one of the best experiences of her life. Things like that are
just awesome to hear."
The group began last fall, when Christine Hancock 'O2
sent a letter proposing the idea to the Outsiders, the college's wilderness outing group. When members of the class
of 2004 showed interest, they formed SwOOP, the
Swarthmore Outdoor Orientation Program. The trip was
patterned after Princeton's Outdoor Action (OA) program,
which engages more than half of each incoming class in a
wilderness experience.
Last May, the organizers decided to expand the program to the Tri-College community and renamed their
group. Because of the short notice, Haverford chose not to
participate, and trip leaders were only drawn from the
Swarthmore student body.
About 20 students applied from each of the two participating colleges. "We figured it would be self-selecting,"
organizer Joe Florence 'O4 said, so no explanation of intent
was required. TrOOP organizers chose the nine students
who went on the trip by lottery from the pool of applicants.
Both Florence and Steele believe that the number of students who applied was lower because of the trip's timing.
Not only was it in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks,
but "a lot of people already have an expectation, or their
parents do, to go home over break" as well, Steele said.
"We would expect a whole lot more people if it was moved
to the summer."
At the same time, Johncilla said, "if you have it for pre-

orientation, people who want to be in Tri-Co or CROP or
other programs will have to choose."
Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr each sponsored a group of
first-years by paying $3,400 to an outside organization,
which took care of food, equipment, and medical support.
With transportation costs and several other meals, it cost
each college approximately $4,000. The four leaders were
trained on a similar trip earlier this year, which cost
Swarthmore an additional $3,400.
"In the future, we hope to train people to a competent
enough level, or create a position for somebody who
will be
able to train students, so we can operate without having to
contract with an outside organization," Steele said.
'Although there will be costs with
hiring a person, it
basically becomes a question of transportation and food."

cal education department.
Physical education professor and basketball coach
Adrienne Shibles, who is the faculty adviser for TrOOP.
acknowledged that the program might become a part of her
department. But, she said, "we as a department have not
yet discussed that."
Despite the ambiguity of whether the program will
exist next year, he and others are already planning to
expand."My personal goal is to have 20 students from each
of the three colleges go next year," he said. Because the
organizational issues are the hardest part, Steele said,
going from one group often to two groups often should not
pose a problem for the college.
"After the initial investment, which the school has
already done, it's pretty cheap," Florence said.
Steele said the group had discussed placing members
from the three colleges together in a group. However, "we

would want to stay true to the goals of forming good friendships and having an introduction to [the college], so it
makes sense to keep the groups separate."
He said that the size of the groups would not increase,

even if the total number of participants did. "It might be
decreased if there are more leaders," he said.
"We want to facilitate good bonds, but not have people
get sick ofeach other," Steele said, but "if you're moving in
a group larger than 12 or 14 people ... you start to make an
impact on the campsites."
"We want to run trips at other times of the year for
other segments of the student body," Wollenberg said. "We
don't want it to be just a freshman thing."
Steele believes "the wilderness provides an excellent
interface to work with other people as a team, assert independence and challenge oneself," and Wollenberg felt that
"backpacking is a metaphor for what the Swarthmore initiation is going to be like."
Florence said simply, "It is something really powerful
for people."

The future
"I am extremely impressed by the energy and planning
that students have put into this project, and I would like to
find a place for it," Dean of the College Bob Gross wrote in
an e-mail. "But I am not optimistic about funding a major
new initiative."
To convince Gross and other members of the administration, organizers of TrOOP are preparing a presentation
for the deans in the next few weeks that will include comfrom this year's participants and the group's ideas
for next year. Steele has also considered hosting a roundtable discussion among the deans, faculty, the organizers,
and interested students from all three Tri-Co schools "to
discuss options for the program," he said.
"No decision has been made," Gross wrote, but "money
js an issue." Based on projections for next year's budget,
he said, "money for new programs will be tight."
"This year the funds came from the Dean's
discretionary Fund, and we can't do that again," he wrote.
Organizers of TrOOP have suggested several ways in
which the experience could be integrated into the three

OPINIONS
EDITORIALS

It's Coming Out Week!

This is not about
the chalkings

...but what if the closet' s locked?

This is not an editorial about the chalkings
for Coming Out Week.
After all, every year the Swarthmore
Queer Union (SQU) promotes a campaign that

includes slogans that aim to challenge conventional thought and that are often sexually
explicit. Some on this campus feel the words
constitute good, thought-provoking publicity;
some feel they are unnecessary and in poor
taste. It is a debate we have come to expect.
Sadly, we have also come to expect homophobic responses to Coming Out Week. It was
distressing to see posters for the celebration
defaced with scrawlings like "sick pervert" and
"die, faggot, die!" But what really disturbed us
was the fact that we were not surprised.
If the Swarthmore African-American
Students Society (SASS) put up posters for an
event and someone wrote racist messages over
them, there would and should be an uproar on
this campus. We should be seeing the same
uproar now. Homophobic messages of hate
should be no more acceptable than racist ones.
We make this plea: if you feel that homosexuality is wrong, or that Coming Out Week publicity goes too far, make your own posters with
that message. But just as you should have freedom of speech, you should not infringe on the
rights of others. The extreme disrespect that
the defaced posters showed is something that
we, as a community, must not accept.

Time to jilt The Jolt
We believe it is time for the Daily Jolt to die
a natural death. What began as a legitimate
attempt to provide a forum for student discussion has degraded into nothing more substantial than the scribblings in a bathroom stall.

The students ofSwarthmore should cease

to use the Web site and, like a proletarian revolution, resist any further attempts by an outside company to infiltrate themselves into the
campus. No, The Jolt is not unique to
Swarthmore. Born at Amherst, The Jolt exists
in customized forms at a variety of colleges. At
Swarthmore, the forum in all its crass, catty
glory is the main attraction.
Although The Jolt does offer other services,
such as weather reports and a Sharpies menu,
these services are already duplicated by other,
campus venues, such as The Daily Gazette.
The fundamental problem with the forum is
its anonymity. It's a recurring cycle: A "guest"
posts several insults, and so those with intelligent comments feel it's not worth their time to
express themselves. After some time, the only
people left who write on the forum spew abuses, shielded by their anonymity.

The unfortunate difference between The
Jolt and a bathroom stall is the perceived
respectability of a Web site. No one takes toilet
graffiti seriously, but, online, those same
words carry some weight.
The censorship The Jolt frequently exercises to blot out particularly offensive posts
is hardly adequate. The point, after all, is not
to suppress asinine thoughts but to hold their
authors accountable for them. Nobody
deserves to be publicly humiliated, and no
one should have the power to hurt others'
feelings without any repercussions. We cannot help the fact that some students are
insensitive, but we can help whether or not
The Jolt continues to exist as a place where
this insensitivity can flourish.
We would be willing to rescind this proposed death sentence only if the forum were
revamped to require people to post with their
real names.

Don't let fear
halt plans to
study abroad
Dear Editor:
As someone who was out of the country
during the attacks and still is, I find the

news about the drop in students studying
abroad ("Drop in foreign study brings
crunch in dorms," Oct. 11) disappointing.
I understand that there is reason for
concern and caution, but I do not understand why the actions of a misguided few
should force people to live their lives in
fear and anxiety.
The point of the attacks was just that
to create a climate offear.
In curtailing plans such as the wonderful opportunity to immerse yourself in
another culture for an entire semester and
attempting to understand more of the
world, we are shutting ourselves off and
therefore giving in to exactly what the terrorists wanted in the first place.
This attitude does not help us with our
own personal growth and it certainly is not
helping the economy or America's foreign
policy.

Be skeptical of dogmatic world views
Dear Editor:
The internal incohsistencies within Dan Naseemullah's last two
columns (Oct. 11 and Sept. 27) have
become too glaring to go unanswered.
On one hand, Naseemullah
implores us to seek objective truth, to
aspire to the virtue called humility,
and to recognize that we don't have
the answer.
I agree with this half of
wish that
I
Naseemullah
Swarthmore students would be more
skeptical of their dogmatic ideological worldviews.
Yet in the very same column
where Naseemullah proclaims these
noble pursuits, he goes on to lambaste
those who stood squarely on Parrish
who told a thoughtful rally that
American imperialism is the freely
chosen and ultimately correct philosophy of the modern world.
This is a downright pathetic and
mean-spirited paraphrasing of two
heartfelt speeches that were guided
by the speakers' deepest moral inclinations.
Apparently people
are only
thoughtful to Naseemullah if he
agrees with what they have to say.
For the life of me, I cannot bring
together Naseemullah's professed

pursuit of humility with his vicious
assault on those who dare to disagree

with him.
When he articulates antiquarian
positions that advocate an extraordinary anti-American worldview, he
implicitly suggests he is being humble and cognizant of the possibility
that he is wrong.
Yet when others suggest that perhaps the United States is justified in
taking action against its enemies,
they are castigated as arrogant and
thoughtless.
It's the pursuit of objective truth
versus Naseemullah's extreme positions. He must have it one way or
have it the other.
But stop self-righteously dismissing serious and thoughtful opponents
through your haughty and mean-spir-

ited insults.

The Price of Liberty

Keep these countries

out of foreign policy
Pop quiz, hotshot. You're the secretary of state, and you're trying
to assemble an anti-terrorist coalition. Membership includes all sorts
of swell perks like military aid, warm diplomatic relations and the
United States turning a blind eye to human rights offenses. Regimes
are lining up around the block to take part in it. However, you realize that in matters like this, it pays to be selective. Letting every
joker with a flag and a rifle into your club simply won't do. Who do
you choose to exclude from the war against terror?
A) Syria. Syria is a major sponsor of the terrorist group Hezbollah
and is currently building closer ties with Iraq. According to the Middle
East Media Research Institute, an organization that monitors extremist statements in the Arab press, Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlass has written a pamphlet called "The Matzah of Zion" about how
Jews murder innocents in order to procure human blood for their
Passover matzah. A movie version is in the works.
B) Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have been a major source of terrorist
funding for years. In the past, the Saudi Arabian government has
repeatedly blocked investigations of terrorist attacks, either because
they're terrified of a fundamentalistbacklash or because they secretly
approve. They have a medieval law code similar to that of Afghanistan,
with strict controls on the behavior of women and public beheadings

to be Colin Powell.
In peacetime, I think that Powell would make an excellent secretary
of state. He seems to be a genuinely talented diplomat, and he loves
building alliances with foreign governments. If his mission was to
make America more popular, I think he would do a bang-up job.
Unfortunately, that's not his mission. His mission is to help America
win a war against terrorism. And from the evidence so far, it looks like
he's going to mess it up by creating another rotten coalition.
Coalitions are a tricky thing. Even a superpower has to have some
friends in order to fight a war like this. That's why it makes sense to
chum up with morally reprehensible but strategically useful nations
like Pakistan. But if you bring in too many allies, it's worse than having none at all. Each different country has its own set of demands,
some or all of which might not be in accord with American interests.
We saw this at the end of the GulfWar, when Powell backed down
from toppling Hussein rather than let the coalition fall apart. The fear
was that if we deposed the Butcher of Baghdad unilaterally, enormous
anti-American sentiment would spread through the region. After years
of the sanctions and military presence which that policy made necessary, guess what happened? Enormous anti-American sentiment
spread through the region. Now it looks like we're about to repeat that
mistake. Our allies will support or at least not vehemently oppose
a war against Afghanistan. They know that we're going to bomb the
hving daylights out of somebody and figure that it might as well be the
Taliban. But the moment we turn our attention beyond Afghanistan,
they're going to start raising hell.
If Powell hasn't learned anything from the Gulf War, he'll try to
c ut the mission short and declare victory prematurely rather than
upset his new allies. We'll feel good about ourselves for a while, content in the comfortable lie that a yahoo with a beard in a backwards
little country was pulling all the strings of international terrorism.
And then eventually America will be attacked again. We'll rebuild

of adulterers.
C) Sudan. Sudan is ruled by an Islamic regime which regularly
commits atrocities against Christians and animists living in the
south. Government-supported militias routinely take women and
children as part of their booty. According to Anti-Slavery
International, there are currently 5,000 to 14,000 non-Muslims being
held as slaves. The Sudanese government provided safe harbor for
bin Laden until 1996, when the United States threatened to bomb
them, and Al Qaeda camps may still be operating in the country.
D) Israel. This democratic state has been a staunch ally. They
wrote the book on airline security, and they've got one of the world's
finest counter-terrorism programs. For the targeted assassinations
that the United States is now trying, no government has more experience. If you answered D, congratulations! You've got what it takes

the alliance for another round. Repeat ad infinitum.
The mayor of New York, not the secretary of state, is the one we
should be turning to for foreign policy wisdom right now. When a
Saudi prince showed up recently with a check for $lO million and an
offensive harangue about how we brought this upon ourselves,
Giuliani told him that we didn't want his help badly enough to put up
with his anti-American guff.
That's the sort of leadership we need right now. We need someone
who has the backbone to tell certain allies that the benefits they can
°ffer us aren't worth the price they want to charge. We need someone
with the perception to point out which foreign governments are part of

But then I remember those dull hours spent in th

in high school, and I fall victim to it even now at times.
Maybe Los Angeles attracts those who run away

I've lived in Los Angeles since I was eight years

Peace movement foolish, dangerous
Dear Editor:
The drumbeat of war can be
heard throughout the civilized
world. In Afghanistan, it can be
felt in the pounding rhythm of the
bombs. Yet, in some elitist, educational institutions the drumbeat
of opposition from a self-styled
peace movement is growing louder. Many Swarthmore students
support this movement. They see
themselves as carrying on the
anti-war sentiments started in the
Vietnam era. However, our current conflict and the Vietnam
conflict are fundamentally differ-

ent, and this peace movement is
misguided and dangerous.
The peace movement starts
with the assumption that
Americans need to understand
why so many Muslim fundamen-

talists hate them. There is nothing wrong with this assumption;
many people who are anything
but pacifists are trying to understand the same thing. But pacifists make the leap from explanation to justification
that the
atrocity of Sept. 11 was the
inevitable result of arrogant
American foreign policy.
This view of American foreign
policy is at best uninformed.
American efforts in the last
decade to help Muslims in
Kosovo, Bosnia and Kuwait have
-

been as altruistic as foreign policy gets in the real world. 85 percent of food aid to Afghanistan
prior to this crisis came from the
United States. Even where
American efforts have been less
fruitful, such as the ongoing
sanctions against Iraq and the
stalled peace process in Israel,

debate whether homosexuals
should be hurled from the top of
buildings or buried alive.
In the Vietnam era, peace
activists could make the argument that the war would end if
we simply withdrew. This is not
the case now. This war is not
optional, and withdrawing is not

intentioned, if unsuccessful.
Even our current campaign,
despite horrendous death and
destruction at home and the
threat of anthrax in the mail, has
made enormous efforts to help the
Muslim civilians on the ground.
The Air Force has dedicated valuable resources and taken extraordinary risks to drop food to starving Afghans. The military as a
whole continues to stress minimizing collateral damage as a critical aspect of their mission.
The Taliban and Al Qaeda dislike things about America that
most liberal peace activists tend
to value: freedom of speech,
human rights, the rights of
women and the rights of homosexuals. While we debate the
wage gap between men and
women, the Taliban throw acid in
the faces of women who show
their skin. While we debate hate
crimes legislation and hold

So without a leg to stand on,
why is Swarthmore so strongly
antiwar? Partly, it stems from a
naive but genuine concern for
human life. Partly it stems from
a desire to emulate the now-legendary civil rights and peace
movements that reshaped the
country a generation ago. And,
partly, it stems from a love of
protesting and the adrenaline

rush of rebellion. But protest for
naive, emulative, or rebellious
reasons is foolish and dangerous.
This era is more comparable to
1939 than to 1969. We are fighting
for our very survival. Thousands
of people have died and thousands
more people both American and
foreign will probably die before
this conflict is over. However, just
as in 1939, the world will be better

BY MATT RUBIN

October break is a time for contemplation and revelation. Last October break, I finally realized that Weezer
had based their album "Pinkerton" on the opera
"Madame Butterfly." Soon thereafter I realized that
every other hardcore Weezer fan already knew that. Now
I don't care because they sold out anyway.
My revelation this break was twofold. First, I realized
that Swarthmore is the greatest place in the world.
Second, I realized that it's not.
Why is Swat the greatest? Oh, let me count the ways
the quirky people, the scenic beauty, my history seminar, Lodge 2
This list is endless. Indeed, I spent the
entire break trying to recreate the Swat environment,
whether by looking for secluded parks in Scarsdale to
read in, attempting with little success to have a nice conversation with some pretentious Yalies, or just seeing as
many Swatties as possible in a short period of time.
As you might have gathered, I spent some time this
break at Yale. While there, my aforementioned Garnet
Pride was at its peak; I could hardly endure being at any
school other than Swat, especially one where, on family
weekend, most fathers were smoking cigars and laughing
so loudly that I couldn't hear myself think, let alone
insult them. That I saved for this column.
Nevertheless, an article in the Yale Daily News did
pique my jealousy and severely shake my faith in Swat.
The article, "UHS ready for anthrax; Cipro kept on hand"
(Yale Daily News, Oct. 17) describes how Yale has been
stockpiling appropriate antibiotics for an outbreak of
anthrax on the Yale campus. To the best of my knowledge, no such precautions have been taken here at
...

Swarthmore.

I know such precautions are absent because when I
first heard about the threat of anthrax, my roommate
Bobby and I made a beeline for Worth, where we were met
by a reassuring and nice woman on duty. And though I
thoroughly enjoyed her multi-colored toe socks (even
though this kind of sock usually weirds me out, it looked
cute on her), my request for Cipro was flat out rejected.
Rather than being made aware of Worth's precaution-

protect me from bioterorrism?
Some might call me paranoid. However, as supporters of peace on this campus point out, continued
American aggression overseas can only exacerbate antiAmerican sentiment and its obvious effects, such as
bioterrorism. If I'm paranoid, then so is a United States
government that is calling for increased production of

I am scared, as many others should be as well, primarily because I am away from home. If anthrax or any
other biological disease does hit Philadelphia, I don't
really know how to use my medical insurance or where
to go for treatment. All I know is that going to Worth
seems pretty futile, especially if the outbreak is massive
enough to test Worth's capacity to handle crisis.
These fears are valid, and the school should be taking
steps to calm them. Even if nothing happens, that does not
change the precarious atmosphere in which we all currently live. I would hope that the administration would be
cognizant of that and fortify our health services to have
the capacity to handle a serious biomedical disaster.
As I noticed in New Haven, most of what goes on at a
big university is not for me. I can do without huge Spring
Flings and unnecessarily grandiose birthday parties that
feature Bill Clinton talking, Phil Glass composing a special birthday score and Paul Simon performing. I certainly don't need George W. Bush speaking at my commencement. However, I would choose life. Wouldn't you?
Though this campus may be divided about what
action America should be taking overseas, I think we can
all agree that, whatever the nature of our offense in this
so-called "war, our defense must be strong. Clearly the
United States government recognizes this need.
Hopefully Swarthmore College will too, and soon.

we mean business, and the recent discovery of plastic
explosives stashed in a locker at the Greyhound station
many of us use?
The burdensome knowledge that we were obliged to
complete around twelve trillion things we'd been putting
off during the first half of the semester in order to
approach the second half with a glimmer of sanity certainly did not make break more restful.
Add to that the mid-semester inevitable existential crisis, uncertainty about our most recent academic decisions, the relationship that's been teetering on the rocks
in the midst of the inescapable struggle to strike a functional balance between work and play and the unrelenting sense of certain doom that set in somewhere around
the second week of the semester. Then the ten-day break
suddenly seems a whole lot less glamorous and far from
rewarding.

I.don't care what you did, whether you flew to the
Bahamas and bummed the beaches or condemned yourself to campus and the now-familiar rotting cheese and
stale booze stench of Willets First. If you think October
break was fulfilling or long enough, drop everything and
seek professional help. You've got some deep-seated
denial to deal with.
I haven't spoken to anyone who is ready to be back on
campus, nose scraping against the grindstone. In fact, I
haven't encountered a single soul whose nasal scabs have
even begun to heal from the first six weeks' grindstone

chafing.
Let's face it: we need at least another week. Hell, anotner month may not be long enough for me to personally
recuperate from the first half of the semester, reorient
myself and my sense of sanctity in the world, and catchup
with everything I've let slide, academically and otherwise.
In light of the fact that I was on edge all break, paranoid that I'd receive an infected parcel or step into a
building that turned out to be the latest target of terrorist
destruction, I implore the administration to reconsider
the duration of October break. The world is too chaotic
right now for us to isolate ourselves as this institutions
rigor mandates.
We should let things settle down a little, at least to the
point where I can ignore the evening news and the stack ot
unopened mail I've sealed in airtight plastic wrap, fearing
some mastermind bio-freak has possibly detected my
anthrax deficiency, long enough to complete the 300 pages
of reading I'd resigned myself to digesting over break.
Let's wait until the country is reasonably stable ana

I've come close to finishing my overdue problem sets.
About a decade should suffice.
October break is intended to return us to classes rejuvenated, refreshed by our second winds. But we've been

The bitterly funny libretto of "Naomi in the Living Room" is based on a play by Christopher Durang. "Sukey in the Dark" will be performed as a companion piece to it.

MYTH AND MADNESS: TWO NEW OPERAS
Departments collaborate to create
accessible opera, commemorate
LPAC's tenth anniversary
BY SUZANNE WU

Suzanne Wu Phoenix Staff

"I don't like my color scheme": the Jonathan Holland directed world-premiere of "Naomi in the
Living Room" is one of two operas being presented by Orchestra 2001 this weekend.

So it is opera, but Orchestra 2001's latest offering, "Myth and
Madness: Two New Operas" moves far beyond the stodgy stereotypes of the genre. One does not have to pretend to be a cultured
connoisseur, nodding appreciatively while thinking longingly of
"Seinfeld" reruns.
Instead, Music Professor Thomas Whitman teams again with poet
and English Literature Professor Nathalie Anderson, with whom he
collaborated on 1998's critically acclaimed "Black Swan," and infuses his new one-act opera, "Sukey in the Dark," with humor, "orchestral color" and the universally accepted ridiculousness of love.
Neither Whitman nor Anderson want to give too much away about
the specifics of the piece, but the issues dealt with in the opera,
according to Anderson, should be familiar to just about everyone, as
part of what makes situations and human interactions interesting is
the way they seem to recur indefinitely. In the myth Cupid is a god
and Psyche is his mortal wife. Psyche is not allowed to see her husband's face, and the obvious ridiculousness of that situation is the
fodder for the play, according to Whitman.
"When you're in love, it's hard enough to know who you're really
in love with," said Whitman. "That's a universal thing, not just a
Swarthmore thing."
In the case of this opera, the grand dilemma is the complexity of
love; either you understand love and your life sucks, or you don't
understand love and wish you did.
"It's like when you notice a couple walking together and you wonder, 'What do they see in each other?' They seem so wrong for each
other from the outside," explained Anderson. "The opera is based on
this premise, and the thought that within the couple, the realization
that people see them as wrong may cause the reexamination, in this
case for the woman, of what her anxieties are."
Orchestra 2001 led by Conductor James Freeman, will present
the world premiere of "Sukey in the Dark" as a companion piece to
the world-premiere of another modern opera
the Jonathan Holland
directed "Naomi in the Living Room." The libretto (or text of an
opera) of "Naomi" is based on a play by playwright Christopher
Durang. The featured soloists are Laura Heimes, soprano; Tamara
Matthews, soprano; Freda Herseth, mezzo-soprano; and Keith
Buterbaugh, baritone. Daniel Rothen berg is the stage director.
The two pieces will be performed in the Pearson-Hall Theatre,
Lang Performing Arts Center on Saturday at 8 p.m., and on Sunday
at 7:30 p.m. as part of a collaboration among the English, Theater
and Music DepartmenBts to commemorate the building's tenth
anniversary.

RASHELLE ISIP
One Stop, Get Out of Swat

A Halloween extravaganza
If you haven't noticed it yet, it's almost Halloween. Candy, costumes,
pumpkins
you've probably seen it all before. This Halloween, expand your
horizons with the occult and the true, but strange.

The Occult

Harry's Occult Shop on South Street has been around for almost a century. It was originally founded in 1917 by Harry Seligman as an apothecary.
Seligman later adapted to the wants and needs of the community and turned
his store into an occult shop. The store remains family-owned today and
sells books, candles, incense, herbs, occult oils, essential oils, magical stones
and crystals, jewelry, bibles and tarot cards. It offers free consultation services and also has classes in subjects such as meditation and hypnotherapy.
So what is the occult exactly? A phone call to Harry's helped answer that.
Marcia Finnegan, an advanced certified clinical hypnotherapist, defined the
occult for me as "anything that is unseen or unheard." This includes things
such as psychic abilities, reiki (a method of healing with the hands through
universal energy) and hypnosis (allowing one's subconscious to be talked to
and persuaded to so something). The occult need not be a thing of mystery
or danger, for as Finnegan told me, "Everyone has [occult] abilities. Some
people are more open to their abilities than others."
You may be thinking, "Yeah, right I'm psychic. That stuff is all a joke."
But, have you ever been in a situation where you just felt uncomfortable and
couldn't explain why? That's your subconscious alerting you to the situation
at hand. "Always listen to your gut feeling," said Finnegan. "99.9 percent of
the time your subconscious is right."
So how can you make use of these "unseen" and "unheard" abilities that
you possess? That's where Harry's comes in. "We help people to teach them
to empower themselves, whatever needs to be done, we teach them how to do
it," explained Finnegan. "We teach positive ways to handle problems or situations." For example, suppose you want to acquire large sums of money.
You must first mentally set your mind to this goal. After this is done, you can
further your project with special herbs, oils and crystals of certain colors.
You might still think that the occult is strange or scary. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. Finnegan told me that at Harry's the, "main concern is to help people use their energies to help enhance their own lives." So
stop worrying that if you use your occult abilities you are heading down the
path of evil. You are really moving toward of self-improvement.

The True
Do you think museums are boring? The Mutter Museum at the College of
Physicians of Philadelphia will certainly change your mind. The small
museum houses an amazing collection of medical oddities, all to educate the
public on the history and developments of medicine.
So what's there? Skulls of prison inmates. A plaster cast of Chang and
Eng, the famous conjoined (Siamese) twins, and their livers. The Chevalier
Jackson Collection of objects swallowed and removed (including an assort-

ment of pins, buttons, nails and other oddities). An enlarged colon (you've
got to see it to believe it). Casts of rare conditions of the skin. Abnormal
fetuses in jars. The Soap Woman (a lady whose entire body was saponified,
or turned into soap). And much, much more.
When I went, my lower jaw practically hung open for the entire duration
of my visit. The collection is extraordinary and you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this is no Hollywood movie trailer of props, this is the real

deal.
The Candy
It's that time o' year and all you really want is the good stuff. If you're
unsatisfied with that bag of Snickers from the drugstore, visit the Candy
Barrel of Philadelphia. They sell candy by the pound, a fond remembrance
of those penny candy stores of the past.

we were called Aspera Ad Astra, but we had to

mechanically. It's overboard at times. But if we
could go back, I don't know if we would change
it. It's good, you know, because it encapsulates
those five months. Stuck in one studio, day in,

Peace movement in pieces without protest music
BY MATT RUBIN

It's 1 a.m., and I've just returned home
from a concert by jazz musician/activist
Gil Scott Heron. Brother Gil, as he's called,
put on a great show, reviving classic
protest tunes calling for freedom and
peace. Yet as the evening progressed, I
couldn't help but feel that though his
songs, perfect for helping put an end to
apartheid and Vietnam, today sound a bit
dated.
Brother Gil did make a concerted effort
to apply the anti-war message of his songs
to the current climate of war in America.
He specifically noted that his lyric "without peace, there is no freedom" is even
more applicable today then ever before.
Which left me wondering where are the
protest songs of this war?
Now, I'm far from a radical. In fact, you
could say I support our government's current action, though with heavy reservations. Regardless, I do mourn the conspicuous absence of artistic opposition to our
military action, as I see such art as definitively representative
of all that is
American. And protest songs make good
music, which should be important to every
American, regardless of politics.
Peace, though I hardly espouse it in the
same way as many on campus, ought to be
advocated as fervently as it has been in the
past, for the dialogue such advocacy creates can only be positive. The lack of
protest music now speaks to the bizarrely
different nature of this war, particularly in
-

regards to

our generation.

While Brother Gil warned us that "this
revolution will not be televised," perhaps a
more appropriate warning these days

would be "this revolution will not have a
popular web site." After all, this is the first
war in which the Internet is playing a
heavy role informing and instructing the
public, and it is hardly doing so in a revolutionary manner. And of this public, the
most Internet-savvy and likely to use the
Web are young.
While the counterculture of the sixties

and seventies turned to music as an alternative to their parents' sources of information (newspapers and television), youth
today turn to the Internet: online chat
rooms, a personal Internet journal, or,
quite often, an interactive video game
Consequently, the people filtering the
information we get are nothing like the
detached hippies of the sixties. Rather,
they are techies with a much different
agenda and mindset as well as a batch of
incredible tricks more powerful than a
minor chord. For example, on newgrounds.com, you can kill Osama bin
Laden in a variety of scenarios. Though set
up as competitive video games, these
games inevitably result in bin Laden's
death.
A disturbingly racist highlight:
blow up bin Laden as he "escapes in a variety of ways: on foot, on camel, and on

magic carpet."
Frighteningly, these games mimic the
way in which our nation's military is conducting the current war. Today's war is
being fought on a digital battlefield; most

tanks and aircraft have computers with
maps that label areas either "friendly" or
"enemy." If an area is labeled enemy, soldiers attack, never having to see the actual
result of their atrocity. Such war must be
disgustingly easy to wage for a generation
that has grown up on video games such as
"Command" and "Conquer." Maybe my
father was right when he used to tell me as
a child that video games were just a ploy by
the government to train future soldiers.
For both soldiers and citizens, this war
has been dehumanized and distilled onto
an LCD screen. The push of a button provides us with opportunities to learn about
and even attack our proclaimed enemy.
The provider of this information and
opportunity, whether the government or
some teenage technophile, is most likely
far different from his counterpart one generation ago.
Other factors make this war different as
well: we were attacked on our own soil, and
our friends and relatives are not yet being
drafted. However, the phenomenon of the

Internet has some very interesting implications on the nature of this war as it per-

tains to American youth. Rather than lash
out against authority, American youth is
now flocking to a venue devoid of protest
but full of patriotic brutality
So, for those who wish to legitimize the
anti-war cause, Brother Gil's instructions
to "teach your neighbor with a heavy tune"
should be taken to heart. As peace vigils
become increasingly abstract in message
and effect, protest songs would help to galvanize and clarify a disparate movement
that, though I disagree with it, should participate in our political discourse with all
possible resources.
Time is of the essence. As I return to my
computer to write this conclusion, I am
watching The Who perform for the Concert
for New York City, a jingoistic bullshit
event with goals I support but execution I
deplore. The concert is a disgrace; songs
that were once revolutionary are now
being introduced by George Pataki and performed on the same stage as anti-Afghan
rhetoric that pokes fun at Osama bin Laden
for having a contagious strain of "smallcox." Even worse, in my opinion, is Bill
Clinton's declaration of the music's larger
purpose. He says, "We are told that Osama
bin Laden and his friends watch us on TV
all the time. Well, I hope they saw this
tonight." If that doesn't make you sick,
maybe this will: after a New York fireman

called Osama bin Laden a "bitch" and
asked the Al Qaeda leader to "kiss his royal
ass," he was regaled with cheers of "USA!
USA!" etc., ad nauseam.
Thus has the uniquely revolutionary
weapon of music been co-opted by the same

powers that control all the other weapons.
Don't be surprised if, this December, you
hear John Lennon's song "Happy Xmas
(War is Over)" distorted from a song of
protest to a song of solidarity, perhaps entitled "Happy Xmas." Hell, following comic
sketches by Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey,
Paul McCartney played "Let it Be" as well
as a new tune he wrote for the occasion. It's
title: "Freedom." If, in the wake of Sept. 11

and the ensuing United States military
action, Lennon's "Imagine" hadn't already
been banned on all Clear Channel radio
stations for its lyrics, I wouldn't be surprised to hear a new version of it: "Imagine
no Osama. It's easy if you try." I bet those
techies could pull it off.
So to all who wish to use music for its
important anti-establishment purpose: you
had better act now. Otherwise, the answer
to the question "War, what is it good for?"
will remain, at least according to newgrounds.com, the hundreds of thousands
who have visited its games, and the millions watching VHI, nothing more than a

good laugh.

Book reviewers: the bane of postmodernist existence

It was with a view to purchasing one of the many marvels of literature produced nearly daily in the contemporary fiction market that I went to a bookstore in

There was so much detail and so
many seemingly pointless asides
that I could hardly follow, much
less enjoy, the story. Perhaps those
whose mental capacity approaches
Mrs. Brown's can see the genius in
her expansive style. But those of
average mind
among whom the
present author has the modesty to
number himself
will find the
effect altogether lost on them. One
passage, as best as I can remember
it, reads thus:

Philadelphia this weekend. I had not been browsing long
through the shop, reading the invariably even-handed and
well-informed literary judgments placed on the back cover
and inside jacket of every volume, when my attention was
seized by a newly released novel entitled "Envy" by

Sandra Brown.
"Never has there been," wrote the Timbuctoo "Herald,"
"a work of such magnificence! of such absolute greatness!
of such unparalleled grandiosity! It is the ne plus ultra of
all art, from Homer to Picasso. I should not shed a tear if
every book but Mrs. Brown's were suddenly committed to
the flames, so much superior is it in form, in style, in content, in
"It could not be more plain," William Safire of "The
New York Times" swore upon his honor as a gentleman,
"that the cerebrum of Mrs. Brown is in a much higher
state of development than that of ordinary human stock:
her style has a loftiness no average mortal could hope to
attain."
"We may feel perfectly at liberty," intoned the Quarterly
Review, "to use the pages of 'War and Peace' or 'Madame
Bovary' or 'Don Quixote' to wipe our less exalted regions,
for compared to Mrs. Brown's divine achievement these
works are nothing but so much Charmin Ultra 2-ply."
On reading these reviews, I very nearly sprinted from
the store, in a transport of excitement, with an unpaid-for

copy of "Envy" in my hands. I regained possession of my
faculties in time, however, to first establish my ownership
of the masterpiece by lawful transaction; and no sooner
did I step out of the shop than I began upon the first pages.
But surely the reader cannot anticipate what then took
place, so contrary is it to all expectations. I had not finished a fifth part of the novel, when I realized, more suddenly than by slow meditation, that I did not feel for

Just to Distract You

Stumbling serendipitously on
Swat's Baroque Ensemble
Part of the beauty of Swarthmore College is that it has a plethora of cultural and
educational opportunities that cater to even the most specific of interests. But I am
definitely one of those students who wouldn't know about or take advantage of very
many of them if I was left to my own devices. Unless some professor made me go,
why would I listen to some form of music that I know nothing about, I never hear anyone mention, and the name of which sounds like some art history major's thesis?
Sometimes things work out in unexpected ways for a reason. The Swarthmore College
Baroque Ensemble is an example of stumbling upon something wonderful accidentally.

For those of you who, like me, know very little about classical music, here's some
basic background information about the type of music that this group performs. I
reseached the genre through the Chamber Society of America ensembles such as
ours play what is called chamber and chamber-orchestra music from the 17th and
18th centuries. Back in the day (a very long time ago, like the late 17th century),
before public concert-giving began, musical concerts were performed in the church,
the theater and the private homes of royalty or aristocracy. The tradition of performing
music in private homes became known as "chamber music." It was music intended to
be played by a small ensemble for a small audience. Chamber music, therefore, was
composed for two or more instruments with one part per instrument. Because of the
individualized role of each musician, collaboration is key.
The Baroque period (from 1600 to about 1750) is characterized by its ornamental,
extravagant style. You have probably heard the style before and just didn't know the
genre; some famous Baroque composers were Vivaldi, Bach, Schobert and Hadyn.
There is one more distinguishing feature of the style of music that this ensemble performs: there is no conductor, therefore, the need for collaboration that I mentioned
earlier is amplified. The closest thing they have to a leader in this style is the keyboard
(harpsichord), which traditionally was given the role of the rhythm section; it drives the
rhythm using a bass line and a few chords. However, since each instrument plays a
-

Because of the individualized role of each
musician, collaboration is key. The Baroque period
(from 1600 to about 1750) is characterized by its
ornamental, extravagant style, but the music is
written without ornamentation because the performer is expected to add embellishments when
she or he chooses.
unique part in the piece, the role of "leader" is not as authoritative as it sounds.
The ensemble is co-directed by Gwyn Roberts and Richard Stone. Roberts, a Bryn
Mawr alum and recorder player, is the director of Early Music at the University of
Pennsylvania and faculty member at the Peabody School of Music in Baltimore. Stone,
a lute player who won an award at the 1990 Festival of Flanders in Bruges, is a cofounder and co-director of the Philadelphia based baroque ensemble, Tempesta di
Mare, and director of Early Music at Swarthmore.
"I coach the group, but they lead it," Stone said, emphasizing the uniqueness of
really giving the musicians their own agency in this style. I also spoke with Molly Jones
'O3, who explained that the Baroque style is much more free and creative than tradi-

tional classical music. The music is written without ornamentation because the performer is expected to add embellishments when she or he chooses. The ornamentation and extravagance that Baroque style music is known for has more to do with the
decisions of the individual performer than with the directions of the composer.
The Baroque Ensemble was one of the factors influencing Jones's decision to
attend Swarthmore. Having learned to play the recorder in elementary school, Jones
said that she didn't know that it was a real instrument until she was in eighth grade
when she became serious about her musical studies. Trained in the Baroque style,
she now plays a wooden, hand-carved, alto recorder, which she ordered from a specialized workshop in New England. Jones is unusual in that she learned to play in the
Baroque style at a very early age. Most of the students in the ensemble were trained
in classical music and are just now learning to play in this genre. Of her rehearsal time
with the ensemble, Jones says,"This is my once-a-week release."

If you are interested in hearing the
the ensemble play, you can stop by
their rehearsals on Tuesday nights in
the Lang Music building, or go to
their concert, scheduled for Nov. 30.

Desperately
seeking a muse
'Serendipity' in dire need of a plot
BY ESTER BLOOM
I went to Ritz at the Bourse intending to see "Iron
Monkey" which, as some of you may know, is purported
to be a carefree martial arts flick made magical by the
talents of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. As I walked down the escalator,
ticket in hand, my attention was drawn to a large sign
that read "Serendipity." I asked an usher to help me
choose a path and she said, without hesitation,
"Serendipity." She told me she had seen it recently and
liked it a lot. I didn't feel like seeing fun violence by
myself so I opted for what I hoped would be light enter-

tainment instead.

Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale, with the restored cute British accent she abandoned for
"Last Days of Disco") would say that my seeing this film rather than the other was nothing
less than destiny. Some purpose, some force, preferably accompanied by remote twinkling
sounds, guided me through those double doors. This is the philosophy that she shares with
Jonathon Traber (John Cusack
don't you hate it when actors play characters of the same
name?) when, as the movie starts, the two meet in Bloomingdales. Her oratory is so passionate you would think the idea that the universe operates according to a plan originated
in her head.
Regardless, John is an eager convert. Enraptured by Sara and her binary life is either
predestined or simply a chaotic mess
after twenty minutes in her presence, he offers to
ditch his girlfriend for her. (At this point, I sank down in my chair and began to glare at the
screen. The action continued, oblivious.) Sara devises an intricate system of tests involving
two elevators, a $5 bill and a first edition of "Love in the Time of Cholera." Trusting that if
it is in the stars that she and John are meant to be, these circumstances will conspire to
reunite them, Sara walks away.
Years pass, illustrated by the fluid motion of clock hands and shadows flitting across the
face of a sundial. John, in New York, and Sara, in San Francisco, are both engaged to other
people. But their joy is tempered by an impulse to spend a lot of time staring out of windows and sighing. Finally the fixation on what-might-have-been overwhelms them. They
set out, determined to find each other, assisted by the encouraging presence of their best

friends.
Their search involves cross-country flights, thousand-dollar wardrobes and lying to
their unwitting fiancees. Poor fiancees! Their only crime is their inability to compare to
Sara and John's romantic fantasy; still, like all obstacles to love, the purest ideal in
Hollywood movies, they are destroyed and forgotten.
The question of what purpose the stars have in going to such abnormal length to bring
these rich, beautiful, talented, mopey characters together is never explored. Perhaps the
fact that they're rich, beautiful, talented and mopey is sufficient. But their reunion is so
contrived and involves the sacrifice of so much that it seems like something extraordinary
must come of their being together. Like maybe the Messiah.
"Serendipity" isn't a bad movie: the script, Marc Klein's first attempt, has some funny
lines, and Cusack and Beckinsale have almost enough charm to redeem the banal simplicity of the plot. But I missed Rob Gordon, Cusack's character in "High Fidelity," who would
beat the hell out of John for choosing "the fantasy" over a woman he knows and loves. "I've
been thinking with my guts since I was 14 years old and I have come to the conclusion that
my guts have shit for brains," says Rob. "Serendipity" could benefit from such wisdom.

What were they thinking?
From REVIEWERS, pg. 13
That such writing is tiresome I would
not have the reader believe on my authority alone. No less esteemed a literary critic
than George Carlin convincingly defends
the truth of the position thus: "With novels
like this, if there is a landscape, or a breeze,
or even a door slightly ajar, the author has
to stop and say something like, 'The clouds
hung ponderously on the horizon, like
looselyformed pieces of shit, dangling ominously on the horizon.' I'm not interested.
Skip the clouds and get to the fucking."
But I do not wish to weary the reader by
being too minute with criticisms. The
upshot of the matter is that I began to doubt
the sincerity of the novel's book reviewers.
Naturally, I had already known instances
where my fellow human beings deliberately said the thing which is not, and I shuttered to think that here this might be the

case.

I was doubly put in mind of this vice of
our species when I thought back to the

Swarthmore tour guide which I
had recently overheard. Whereas I was
expecting her to say, "And here is the plaque
commemorating the address President
Woodrow Wilson gave to the college, which
is remembered with special pride by the
students and faculty here, because Dr.
Wilson was not only the last person even
remotely famous to have spoken at
Swarthmore College, but also the last president to have even heard of it," in fact she
actually said, "And here is Sharpies Dining
Hall, whose varied menu and exquisitely
prepared cuisine has made for it a reputation not just throughout the campus but
speech of a

throughout the western world at large."
Could it be, I mused, that even in the literary world such perversions of truth
occur? I merely suggest the idea. For it is
not my desire to rob of pleasure those who
are fated to encounter a good read in Mrs.
Brown's "Envy." I think they have a future

in book reviewing.

SQU demonstrates

against harassment

SSfofek

From HARASSMENT, pg. 3

"I was in a state of shock," she said. "It's fine if he thinks
that, but he shouldn't -have been saying those things and
threatening me."
Although Rogg spoke at length about his opinions of the
chalkings, he declined to give an account of what took place
between himself and Lindsey in front of Sharpies.
Soon after the incident occurred, Jackie Aponte 'O2, a
friend of Lindsey's, sent an e-mail to members of QSA and
SQU with a subject that read, "Homophobic harassment on
campus today."
Rogg said he was especially offended by the use of the word
"homophobic," explaining that he has been around many
homosexuals, including some in his own family, and that he
fully supports the queer rights movement.
"I did not attack anyone," he said. "She took the 'bring it'
as a threat," and shouldn't have. He added that the chalkings
were what spurred the incident, repeatedly citing the use of
the word "cocksucker" as especially offensive.
"I didn't come to Swarthmore to see that word on the sidewalk," he said. "Who would dare defile this beautiful campus
in such a way?" He said the kind of provocation found in the
chalkings would help no one, and that, while telling Lindsey
some of the writing was offensive, one of the other students
helping her hand out buttons and stickers agreed that some of
the messages were too blatant.
"If they [SQU] behave like this in the real world, I guarantee you their progress will be slim to none," he said, adding
that he took special offense when one of the other QSA workers at the table with Lindsey compared the queer rights move-

queer."

The e-mail said that the incident, when combined with the
slurs written on several pro-queer signs this year "demonstrates the homophobia that does exist here at Swat."
In response, a demonstration will take place today on
Parrish steps at 12:30 p.m. SQU will arrange a reading of all
the incidents from this year that board members feel were

homophobic. An open mike period will follow.
Aponte said the event was to "just show people won't stand
not only for this incident but for the signs" as well. She added
that it was also "in support of the queer community, in condemnation of homophobia" and hate speech anywhere on
campus. "I'm not Republican, but I'd be upset if someone did
that to a Republican on campus," she said.
Emily Morris 'O4, QSA co-coordinator, said the purpose
of the demonstration was "to say something about how people are under the impression that there's not a lot of homophobia here, and that's not always the case." She added that
she was very hopeful that an administration or faculty
member would join SQU in condemnation of homophobia

on campus.
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie, who met with Lindsey
yesterday and will meet with Rogg today, said he supports
QSA's and SQU's efforts to raise awareness. "I think it's very
positive, and I think that they invite people to discuss and disagree with them," he said, calling the defamation of pro-queer
posters "cowardly and deplorable."
Lindsey came to him, said Goundie, "if not threatened [by
the incident], at least distressed." He added that no punishment was being planned, nor any action on the part of the
administration.

Volleyball rallies to success ACL tears end athletes'
despite coaching changes seasons, not their careers
BY ANNA MASILELA

FROM ACL, pg. IS

Surmounting the controversy
concerning the change in head
coaching staff over October break,
the women's volleyball team
wrapped up a season with its best
Centennial Conference record (4-5)
since 1995, and its best overall
record since 1994.
A victory over St. Joseph on
Oct. 13 was the starting point for
the Garnet Tide at the Seven
Sisters tournament held at Bryn
Mawr. With each succeeding
game, St. Joseph's slipped further
and further behind, losing the
match 30-20, 30-14, 30-12. Natalie
Dunphy 'O5, who was named to the
conference honor roll, knocked in
an even 20 kills.
Co-captain Christine Hancock
'O2 had 17 kills, while Sarah

Emma Benn 'O4 both got down
defensively for Swat and came up
with eight and seven digs respec-

The second game of the tourney
was a non-conference match-up
with Haverford, currently ranked
second in the conference. It ended
in a loss for Swat, 30-27, 30-13, 30-2
Hancock and Dunphy combined
for 19 kills, while Rosenfeld supported defensively with seven
digs.

The Tide was swept in three
straight matches by a dominating
Vassar on Oct. 14. Although
Hancock, Rosenfeld and Dunphy
each had nine digs, the Tide had a
weak attack for which it could not
compensate. Hancock added some
spark to the attack with her seven

kills, but Swat did not catch the

fire and lost the match, 30-26, 30-11,
30-7.

And once dealt, the injury can be a major irritant.
Typically it is a season-ending affair, and often
necessitates surgery.
This procedure, often an autograft, in which
the patient's existing tendon is used to repair the
break, is "always an elective surgery" according
to Mancini. That is, reconstructive surgery is not
required, but is recommended in most cases. The
typical rehabilitation time frame before a return
to unrestricted cutting activities is typically

need not end a sports

Such is the case for
Lewis. Thanks to surgery,

the continued monitoring
of her knee by doctors,
and a steady regiment of

rehabilitation exercises, Lewis is expected to

complete a full recovery.
Though she will miss the remainder of the soccer season, she will be able to play without any
major complications next year. Since she sustained an ACL tear on her other knee while in
high school, Lewis is able to joke, "You never get
full range of motion back so there is often a slight
limp, but since I tore both of mine, I guess the
limps cancel each other out."

Gallaudet took charge of the
first game, but Swat answered
swiftly with a win during the second game. The third game went to
Swat and the fourth to Gallaudet
again, with Swat finally losing
narrowly in the fifth game. The
score of the match was 30-21, 28-30,
30-27, 27-30, 16-14. Swat stepped
back into conference play with a
victory over Washington on Oct.
17, 30-18, 30-23, 30-18. Hancock
brought in 18 kills for Swat, while
Dunphy contributed another 12.
Not content to support only the
attack, Hancock also brought up 14
digs for the defense. Rosenfeld had
11 digs as well.
On Oct. 20, Swat give up the
first game, but regrouped and finished off conference foe Ursinus in
the next three, 17-30, 30-25, 30-24,
30-27. Benn took charge of attack,
contributing 19 kills.
Next up for the Tide was the
Green Terror. Swat started off
weakly against Western Maryland,
but the Green Terror was able to
hold on to the advantage and the
Tide lost, 30-11, 30-22, 30-26.
Rosenfeld, who has the best hitting
percentage in the conference, was
named to the weekly honor roll for
her efforts.

Field hockey narrowly edged out by F&M, 1-0
From HOCKEY, pg.

Woodworth 'O3 scored as well to finish out the
balanced attack by the Tide.
Facing Franklin and Marshall on Saturday Oct.
20 the team realized it needed a win to maintain any
hope for a berth in the playoffs. "Coming into the
Johns Hopkins and Franklin and Marshall game, I
thought that our team was still in good contention to
go on to the conference playoffs," said Tarr. With the
largest crowd at Swarthmore this year to see the
seniors' final home game, the stage was set for
Swat's do-or-die matchup.
The teams matched up for 50 minutes of intense,
scoreless play and keeper Nelson-Lee grabbed six
saves to keep the game tied. With eight minutes to
play in the game, however, Nelson-Lee was whistled
for pushing in the penalty area. Franklin and

Marshall attacker Alison Reindle took advantage of
the penalty stroke and found the back of the net for
Franklin and Marshall's narrow 1-0 victory.
The loss was a frustrating one for seniors like cocaptain Amy Dißenedetto 'O2, who was named to the
conference honor roll for her work during the season. "You set lofty goals in the beginning of the season and somewhere along the line, you reevaluate
your goals," she said. "I hadn't done that [prior to
the F&M game on Saturday]; I still believed that we
should have made the playoffs."

Swat closed the season with a 4-1 victory over
Haveford on Oct. 24. The Garnet has swept the
Fords in nine straight meetings. Gaffney started the
Garnet attack, while Tarr put a second one in the net
on a penalty. Cariello added another one in the middle of the second half and Lindsey VanSciver 'O3 got
in the last one to make an even four.

The 'infamous pop': ACL tears
common in female athletes
Risk of knee injury can be reduced through weight training, cardiovascular conditioning
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
Four weeks ago, Shavaugn Lewis 'O5
found herself sprawled on the ground during a game against Franklin and
Marshall. "I was battling a defender for
the ball, won it, and she pushed me down
while I was shooting. All of my weight
was on my left leg which was turned
toward the goal, but the girl pushed me
away from the goal. My knee cap went
sideways and my leg buckled back and I
heard that good old pop sound," explained

Lewis.
This "infamous pop sound," as Caitlin
Ryland 'O2 described the audible indicator
of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
she sustained while playing basketball for
Swarthmore in February of 2000, is one
that reverberates throughout the female
sports world. According to
Marie
Mancini, Swarthmore's head athletic
trainer, advances in surgical procedures
and a better understanding of how the
body operates no longer render a torn
ACL the career-ending injury it was just
twenty years ago, but it is still a frequent
and serious occurrence on the college
sports landscape.

Anatomy of an injury
The ACL, a ligament in the knee which
connects the femur (thighbone) to the
tibia (shinbone) can be either partially or
completely torn through a twisting motion
incurred when the foot is planted while
the body turns, a sudden stop or a direct
blow. A tear permits the tibia to move too
far forward, allowing the connection
between the femur and tibia to become too

A recent study appearing
in the American Journal
of Sports Medicine indicates that a combination

of circumstances
contribute to the higher
ACL tear rate among
women.
loose, creating instability in the knee.
However, a complete break between the
femur and tibia is alleviated by the presence of three other ligaments in the knee,
the posterior cruciate ligament, the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligaments. Often, a tear in the
ACL is accompanied by either the stretching or tearing of one of these other ligaments in the knee or by a meniscus tear.
Two or three ACL tears are incurred by
female student athletes at Swarthmore in
a typical year. Describing the causes
Mancini said, "Usually it's a cutting or
pivoting action. With collision sports,
there might be collision or impact
involved, but we don't see that as much in
women's sports as we do with men's
sports." It is through this less common,
contact-induced means, that Ryland tore

her ACL.

"I went up for a rebound and collided
with another girl. I came down on my left
leg in a contorted position" she said.
Heather Kile 'O2, a basketball and

lacrosse player, had a similar experience
while playing basketball in high school. "I
don't even know exactly what happened. I
drove to the basket and one girl stepped in
front of me at the same time her teammate
ran into me from the side. We all ended up
in a big pile on the floor and my knee was
twisted in the middle. The result was a
torn ACL and MCL," she said.
But such collisions are less frequent
causes of ACL tears than sudden deceleration or lateral movement. Helen Leitner
'O4 incurred this more-common type of
ACL tear last year while preparing for a
playoff game in field hockey against
Washington on the turf at Johns Hopkins.
"I was sprinting to catch up with a ball,
but as I went to take a quick shot on goal
I landed on the side of my foot and twisted my leg as I fell. It still amazes me how
easily it happened," she said.
Why women?

OCTOBER 25, 2001

And it seems easier for ACL tears to
occur in women than in men. Studies estimate that women are anywhere from two
to eight times more likely to experience
torn ACLs. The most conclusive of these,
a 1997 study released by the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey' s
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School,
reports that female college players are
about six times more likely than men to
suffer an ACL tear. There is still a good
deal of speculation about why this is the
case.
A recent study appearing in the

THE PHOENIX

American Journal of Sports Medicine
indicates that a combination of circumstances contribute to the higher ACL tear
rate among women. Though the study was
conducted with high school athletes, colleges often notice the same trend. The factors contributing to the disparity in rates
between genders include a "higher

top notch, that you're lifting with your

among males than females and the fact

strength"

found to be statistically smaller than it
was in boys." Additionally, there is
research currently being conducted which
may link the presence of estrogen in
women to a weakened ACL.
As Mancini explains, an "anatomical
configuration may predispose women" to
this type of injury. But, she is quick to
emphasize that while "there is no guarantee that you will not have an ACL tear,"
there are certain precautions athletes can
take to minimize their risk. "One thing
they can do is to be in as good a shape as

said Mancini.
Rehab crucial
Student athletes who have suffered the
injury agree, and cite development and

theirrehabilitation efforts as well.
"I think that the best thing a female
athlete can do is to lift weights," said Kile.
"My rehab came along very quickly. The
speed and success was partially attributed
to my strength before the injury occurred.
The rehab itself was not that different
from the lifting I was doing prior to my
injury so my muscles were already
strong."
Leitner concurred, citing the importance of proper equipment at well. "I've

Cross country shows strong
at Seven Sisters, Allentown
BY TARA TROUT
The men's and women's cross country teams
are both looking toward the Centennial
Conference postseason after pulling out outstanding performances over October break. The men's
team raced at the Allentown College Invitational
on Oct. 13 while the women's team competed at the
Seven Sisters Invitational at Haverford on Oct. 20.
The men performed extremely well on the difficult course in Allentown, an eight-kilometer
course with a labyrinth of hills and turns, garnering a top-notch performance. Even though many of
the top runners for Swat were injured, the fortytwo other teams were no match for the speed of the
Garnet.

Leading the pack was co-captain Joe Makin 'O3,
who placed thirtieth overall. Close behind him
was freshman phenomenon Garret Ash 'O5, who
also placed well. Also placing for the Tide was
James Golden 'O5 with an impressive race after
recovering from injury. Another recovering runner, Lang Reynolds 'O5, put in an outstanding performance as well. Rory Kondrad 'O2 rounded out
Swarthmore's top five. Don Nguyen 'O3 was close
behind. And Dan Keys 'O5, who is also recovering
from an injury, still managed to make
Swarthmore's top seven.
"Allentown's a tough course

Give rankings a rest,
try football Madness

Field hockey beats
Mules, Villa Julie

The vast majority of sportswriters and Division 1-A college football coaches consider Miami to be the best team in
college football. Evidently, they're wrong. At least, they're
wrong in the eyes of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS)
system, which ranks teams under the guise of alleged
objectivity. But this objectivity is only an illusion.
When the BCS ranking system emerged several years
ago, it vowed to determine the "true" two best college football teams in the nation so that these teams could compete
in a bowl game for the national title. Previously, the
Associated Press rankings, which represent the collective
opinions of experts, determined which teams would compete in the title game. However, fans and others complained that the AP poll was too subjective, and that often,
the top two teams in the poll were not the top two teams in
the country. Enter the mathematically-based BCS rankings. A mathematically-based system must be able to
determine, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who the best teams
are, right?
Wrong. Controversy not only still exists; it is burgeoning. Take, for example, last year's BCS, which pitted undefeated Oklahoma against Florida State, which had only lost
one game. Florida State's only loss had been to Miami, a
team that also suffered only one defeat that year. A considerable portion of college football fans and experts believed
Miami deserved to be number two. The BCS, allegedly the
objective savior of rankings, did not save college football at
all.

The problems with the BCS stem from two factors.
First, the system is just as subjective as the AP and ESPN
polls. These two admittedly subjective polls in fact comprise one element of the BCS system, supplementing the
mathematical polls. The mathematical polls themselves
are subjective because they arbitrarily weight different
factors, such as margin of victory. Also, factors such as
losses, poll rankings, and schedule strength do not directly determine a team's BCS rank.
Rather, the weights given to each of those factors determine rankings. The BCS could easily multiply the different elements by different weights to change its rankings.
For instance, the BCS could arbitrarily decide that
strength of schedule is important and multiply that factor
by ten. As a result, teams with difficult schedules would
move up in the polls.
Second, the BCS system is unfair simply because it is a
ranking system. It is impossible to fairly compare an undefeated, historically successful team from the ACC with an
undefeated team from the Southeast Midwestern Valley
Sunshine Athletic Conference. Most ranking systems
would penalize teams from small, obscure conferences
because they play weaker competition. But such penalties
are undeserved. For example, imagine team A in the NFL
that goes 16-0 but is in a division with Dallas, Washington,
Detroit and Kansas City. Imagine team B that goes undefeated in a division with St. Louis, Oakland, Green Bay
and San Francisco. If we ranked those teams, we would be
tempted to favor team B.
But in reality, we could never know for certain which
team is better unless those teams play each other
(although even then, only a series between the teams could
really determine which is better). We would need to give
team A the opportunity to display that it is as good as team
B. In college football, we need to provide teams with a similar opportunity to prove their worth. We could use rankings as a rough estimate to determine the top eight or 16
teams. Then, we could allow the teams to prove their
worth in a three or four week playoff. Team one would play
team 16 and so on. Stadiums and corporations that currently host bowl games could host playoff games, and the

Fiesta, Orange, Sugar and Rose Bowls could rotate hosting

the championship game. If March Madness is any indicator of the excitement of college sports playoffs, then such a
format would be hugely successful in college football.

Garnet splits four games over break; Cahello makes
top ten in Centennial Conference goal scoring list
BY DERRICK WU
The games over October break and all this week have

proved a roller coaster of a ride for the Garnet Tide. The
team experienced
exhilaration after defeating
Muhlenberg in overtime. Swat proceeded to lose to archrival Johns Hopkins, but bounced right back against
Villa Julie. Centennial Conference scoring leader Kim
Cariello 'O2 scored goals number 30 and 31 of her career
in the victory to become the thirteenth member of the
Centennial Conference 30-goal in a win club. However,
the week ended in frustration when a call late in the
game against Franklin and Marshall cost the Tide a
chance for a win and any hopes for a Centennial
Conference playoff spot.
Swat opened a critical four game series starting with
the game against the Muhlenberg Mules on Oct. 1L With
a 2-3 conference record and three of the next four games
against Centennial Conference teams, the Tide needed a
victory to remain in the postseason picture. However,
seasoned veterans knew the game would not be easy.
"The past two years have always gone into overtime with
Muhlenberg," said Cariello. "It's always a good game."
After falling behind 1-0 in the first half, the Garnet

Tide raised their game in the second half. Five minutes
into the second half, midfielder Ingrid Kaszas 'O3 scored
her first goal of the season to even the score 1-L Although
the Tide led the Mules 18-4 in the half, the team couldn't

find the back of the net again to take the lead. Finally, in
the seven-aside overtime period, Cariello put the game
away with her eighth goal of the season. "I was just
lucky," said Cariello. "If I hadn't scored, four other of my
teammates would have." The victory was Swat's first
comeback win after trailing at the half this season.
Next, Swat faced off against conference arch-rival
Johns Hopkins on Oct. 13. Last season, the Tide fell 1-0 to
the Blue Jays in the Centennial Conference finals.
Despite a strong outing by goalkeeper Kate Nelson-Lee
'O3, who pulled in four saves, the team lost the game 2-L
Attacker Alison Gaffney 'O2, who had four shots against
Muhlenberg, scored Swat's lone goal off an assist from
sweeper Katie Tarr 'O2. The Blue Jays managed to
squeeze by with the game-winning goal when Kelly
Hewitt scored with six minutes remaining in the game.
On Oct. 18, the team played against their only nonconference opponent of the week, Villa Julie. Swat dominated the game the entire way, outshooting their opponents 22-6 and winning the contest 5-3. Kaszas opened the
scoring off another assist from Tarr early in the first half.
Cariello then scored the first ofher two goals with a beau-

tiful textbook give-and-go with attacker Helen Leitner
'O4. Cariello is currently tied for eleventh place on the
conference all-time goal-scoring list and tenth on the alltime career points list. Leitner and attacker Meg
