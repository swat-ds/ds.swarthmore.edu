They were sick of ordering pizza, and
they wanted a space to chill on the week-

Irie has been cooking for friends for
several years, and his creations have
long been a welcome late-night alternative to pizza.
Qub's other founders, Dan Yue 'OS,
Chris Atanasiu 'OS, Joey Roth 'O6, and
Alex Atanasiu 'OS, began to ask Irie, why
not cook for the rest of the campus? And if

ends that wasn't filled with smoke. So six
students came up with the idea for a cafe
called Qub, a late-night lounge that will
serve Asian-inspired food but won't allow
alcohol or smoking.
Qub's promise of an alternative atmosphere won the support of the deans,
money from the president, and a spacesharing agreement with the Student Art
Association.
Last Friday, the Kaori Kitao Student

Art Gallery in Sharpies 111 was completely bare and white. Yesterday, soft pink

they were going to cook, why not create a
place to eat and hang out together while
they were at it?
Those thoughts led the six friends to
propose Qub to the deans at the very end
of the summer. Their description of a cafe
that would prohibit smoking and drinking
won its approval.
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said

supporting a cafe like Qub was "a big priority for us as an alternative to the usual
alcohol culture."
President Al Bloom gave the group
$1,250 from his discretionary fund to help
with startup costs. The group has spent

more than that already, but Goundie is
"prepared to find more to get them over
the hump."
Once they start selling food at the cafe
(and perhaps offering takeout), Qub hopes
to be self-sustaining. Food items will cost

which is meant to be more soothing, minimalist and clean-cut.
Student Council and the Student Art
Association control Sharpies 111 and decided in December to let Qub use the space

without a referendum, which has deter-

between SLSO and $5.00, and drinks will
cost between SIOO and $3.00. Already, Qub
has already hired 10 students. Some will
serve as bouncers to enforce the no-drink-

mined use of contested student space in
the past. Council Co-president Ryan
Budish 'O4 said the council is not providing Qub with any money.

ing rule.

Budish was optimistic about Qub's success and glad that the college is giving the
group a chance. "The major plus is that it
would get people to the art gallery and
showcase student art," he said.

Chris Atanasiu said Qub will be
"Paces without the smoke and the dinginess."
It will be a "high class" place, Yue said.
Seated on a cushion in a corner of the
room, Yue looked around him and said, "I
would take a date here. It's better than
Sharpies."
Carmen Barron 'OS, a Paces coordinator, said she does not see Qub as competition to Paces, the larger, smokier student
cafe open Sunday through Wednesday

nights.
"I don't think it's comparable to Paces,"
Barron said. Qub will be open on different
nights and offer a different atmosphere,

she explained.
When she first heard of Qub, she said
she was glad to learn that another latenight food venue was opening here.
"Both offer students services that are
desperately needed on this campus," she
said.
"Some people like the cracked dishes
and poor lighting of Paces," Barron said,
while some will prefer Qub's atmosphere,

"SAA had mixed feeling about us opening up in this space," Wu said, but agreed

anyway. Goundie and Student Activities
Coordinator Jenny Yim are excited about
the cafe and think it will last.
"I think it's another good opportunity
for student socializing in a different venue
than what's available now," Goundie said.
"I do hear a lot from students that, if
you're not particularly drawn to the typical party scene, there's not much to do on

the weekends."
This is not the first late-night lounge
on campus. The Dead Dog Cafe started in
1998 and served up late night fare in
Mary Lyon on Friday nights. It died after
many of its supporters graduated. Yim
said she has asked Qub founders if they
think the same might happen to their
cafe, but her impression is that the firstyears in the group intended to carry it

Arms firm relents
Lockheed Martin includes sexual
orientation in non-discrimination policy

G-Love and DJ Shadow are
possible large-scale events
Budgetary concerns leave future of large-scale event in doubt

BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's Committee for Socially Responsible
Investing (CSRI) has, in its second attempt, achieved
an alteration in the Non-Discrimination Equal
Employment Policy of Lockheed Martin, an arms
manufacturing company in which Swarthmore owns
7,500 shares of stock.
CSRI re-filed its shareholder resolution last
November, asking Lockheed Martin to incorporate
reference to sexual orientation in its Non-

Discrimination Equal Employment Policy.
Lockheed Martin never responded directly to the
CSRI, but on Nov. 21 the company's 125,000 employees
received an e-mail from Vance Coffman, Lockheed
Martin's chief executive. He announced that the policy was changing. The CSRI learned it had achieved
its goal only after reading about it in The Washington
Post two days later.

"Pressure on Lockheed Martin
increased externally and internally."
Morgan Simon 'O4
Corporate Policy Statement CPS-003, Section 1.1
now reads: "Lockheed Martin will provide equal
employment opportunity to all employees and all
applicants for employment without regard to race,
religion, color, sex, national origin, age, United
States military veterans' status, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, family structure, or mental
or physical disability so long as the essential functions of the job can be performed with or without
reasonable accommodation."
The CSRI first filed the resolution over a year ago
and presented it at the company's annual shareholders meeting in San Diego on April 25, 2002. They only
won 5.5 percent of the shareholders' vote, but this
surpassed the required three percent for a resolution
to be re-filed the next year.
Morgan Simon 'O4, who flew out to San Diego to
present the resolution, said that 5.5 percent is an
impressive achievement. Most of the other resolutions only got one to two percent. A relatively small
amount of investor support is often enough to force a
company to acknowledge the resolution. It is "the
loudest statement a shareholder can make to a company," Simon said.
After rejecting the proposal in April, many things
changed for Lockheed Martin. "Pressure on
Lockheed Martin increased externally and internally," Simon said. Its own employees, represented by
the group GLOBAL [Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual at

Lockheed Martin], began to make themselves heard.
Then, in August, Lockheed Martin received a zero
rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advo-

cacy group.
In November, Lockheed Martin finally gave in to
the pressure. Coffman's e-mail announced, "We have

always had a firm commitment to treat all employees
at Lockheed Martin with respect and dignity. In this
spirit, we have added the words marital status, family structure, ancestry and sexual orientation to our
Corporate Policy Statement on non-discrimination,
CPS-003." Coffman also promised to offer domestic
partner health benefits beginning sometime in 2003.
Simon was studying abroad in Mexico when she
heard the policy had been changed. "I was amazed.
Crying," she said. Her boss feared for her sanity. "It's
hard to explain a shareholderresolution in Spanish,"

Simon said.
Suzanne Welsh, vice president for finance and
treasurer, said that the entire CSRI felt empowered
by the whole process. "It was reaffirming to see the
power that colleges and universities can exert to
bring about social improvement," she said.

With the Large-Scale Events
Committee set to decide this year's
event on Friday, the college plans to
question the benefits of such an
event after receiving a dearth of
viable proposals this year.
"We need to think about how
we're spending money," Maurice
Eldridge '6L vice president for college and community relations, said.
"It's worth rethinking whether the
community feels the large-scale

event is worth doing."

These sentiments stem from the
lack of interest exhibited by the students this year. Originally, the
Large-Scale Events Committee had
set a deadline of Dec. L 2002, but the
proposals from the fall were not
acceptable, according to Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5, Student Council's student events adviser.
After extending the deadline past
winter
the
committee
break,
received only two proposals they

deemed acceptable. The final choice
will be between alt-rock group G
Love
Special Sauce and electronic
performer DJ Shadow, who works
with instrumental hip-hop. While
these were not the only two proposals the committee received, they
were the only two under the budget
of approximately $20,000. "The proposals this year weren't satisfying in
general," Rodriguez said. "Swatties
like to complain about the largescale event, but I can't give any credence to complaints when there are
&

only two viable proposals."
Furthermore, Rodriguez stressed
the importance of Friday's committee meeting. "If the decision is not
made on Friday, there may not be a
large-scale event," he said. "Our
intention is to sit down and say,
'This is what we're going to

choose.'"

Rodriguez addressed the rumor
standup
comedian Dave
Chapelle was under consideration.
He is not. Chapelle's booking agent
asked for $35,000 and would not
budge from that price, Rodriguez
explained.
Eldridge, who was Chapelle's
high school principal, said no one
contacted him about the comedian.

that

The committee also faced a conflict over the procedure for selecting
a performer. Rodriguez felt the
appropriate the way to proceed
would be to put the event up for voting through a referendum.
However, Student Activities
Coordinator Jenny Yim and Student
Budget Committee treasurer Jeff
Traczynski 'O4 both said that, under
the college's constitution, a vote
would require two weeks of planning. The committee felt that two
weeks would result in an unacceptable delay and the likelihood of no

large-scale event.
However, many people like the
idea of a vote. "If the proposals themselves are viable, I wouldn't mind
knowing where the community sentiments lie," Eldridge said.
Despite these obstacles, it appears
likely that there will be a large-scale

event this year. But a year marked
by conflict over the proposal process
and a general lack of interest among

the students may have affected the
future of the large-scale event.
Eldridge expressed his concerns
that students are not attracted by the

large-scale event. "We try to get
something that coincides with the
end of the semester. It's supposed to

be a communal release before
exams," he said. "I like the idea of

having a few big events that draw
the community together, but is the
need and desire for an event there?"

Librarians protest FBI seizure rights
BY SUE CHEN
schenl@swarthmore.edu

The American Library Association (ALA) issued a resolution last month protesting a provision in the USAPATRIOT Act that gives the FBI the right to seize patron
records without reasonable cause.
The resolution, passed at ALA's midwinter meeting in
Philadelphia, states that the act "undermine[s] and chill[s]
free expression and inquiry."
"[The PATRIOT Act] was passed in record time; it was
passed as a reaction to Sept. 11, and I don't think people
thought seriously about what it really means," College
Librarian Peggy Seiden said.
"It almost feels as if they [have] set aside the
Constitution, and I'm concerned about... what can really
happen when you have provisions put into place that go
around due process. I think that's really frightening,"
Seiden added.
In its resolution, the ALA "opposes any use of governmental power to suppress the free and open exchange of
knowledge and information or to intimidate individuals
exercising free inquiry." The association will submit the
resolution to Congress and the Office of Management and
Budget in hopes that these rules will be amended.
Furthermore, ALA's resolution "urges librarians
everywhere to defend and support user privacy and free
and open access to knowledge and information."
Here at Swarthmore, Seiden and Lending and Access
Services Specialist Linda Hunt prepared procedures for
staff and student workers on what they should do if government officials demand to see patron records.
"We've never had anything in place when it came to
February 6, 2003

judicial process. The PATRIOT Act has been somewhat of
a catalyst that pushed us to [write out] something that
people can refer to," Hunt said.
In the event that "law enforcement officers
request
specific information about library patrons or staff," students should immediately notify the on-duty circulation
supervisor, according to instructions in the Swarthmore
College Libraries Student Procedures for Complying with
Judicial Process. The staff member is then to notify
Seiden, since staff are not allowed to "attempt to fill the
[search warrant or subpoena] request on their own."
Both students and staff, according to their procedure
guidelines, should not offer any information to federal
agents or answer any questions other than the direction...

al.

"We don't anticipate that any federal people will come
in, but if something should happen, we really feel like our
student [workers] should be prepared," Hunt said.
The procedures were first written last summer and
have yet to be finalized.
Seiden, who is the only person with access to patron
records, said she wants to "limit, to every possible extent,
the amount of material that we have on any individual."
The problem arises, she said, when the library needs
back records to keep track of checked out books and overdue fines. For instance, it is not unusual for students to
ask why they have been fined a particular amount, and
libraries need back records to answer those questions.
"We have to balance how much [information] we need
for bookkeeping" and minimizing the amount of back
records, she said. According to Seiden, Swarthmore currently keeps back records on checked out books for one
month.

Activist crosses country for peace
Attempting to understand the anti-war movement, student spends semester on catwalks and college campuses
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

Hitchhiking, train hopping, cooking on
sidewalks and sleeping on billboard catwalks sounds more like the description of a
Depression-era hobo than a 21st-century
Swattie. While it may not be what most
students envision when they decide to take
a semester off, it's exactly what Javier
O'Neil-Ortiz 'O4 did for the past four
months.
From September 2002 to January 2003,

O'Neil-Ortiz traveled through more than 30
states, analyzing the anti-war movement.
To minimize costs, O'Neil-Ortiz slept on
billboard catwalks and snuck into dorm
lounges for the night. He was kicked out on
more than one occasion. Some nights he
stayed with fellow activists, who ranged

from 16-year-old high school students to
senior citizens. He even stayed in an
activist commune. He carried all his food
and belongings in his backpack, cooking
his meals in dorms or on sidewalks, despite
the strange looks he sometimes received.
And while he did try to travel by
Greyhound when possible, he often found
himself hitchhiking or hopping onto cargo
trains. "It just seemed so practical.
Sometimes I didn't know where the train
was going, I only knew it was going west,"
he said.
While the purpose of the trip was pri-

marily to research the anti-war movement,

O'Neil-Ortiz said he learned much about
life in the United States. He nearly encountered race riots in Cincinnati, where, in his
view, unprovoked murder of young black
males by police is commonplace. He also
witnessed gangs and posses roaming the
streets of North Austin nightly with rifles
and two-by-fours.
O'Neil-Ortiz's most unforgettable experience, however, occurred on a bus trip
from Austin to El Paso, Tex., when the bus

was raided by border patrollers and three
illegal immigrants were taken into custody,
still holding the Christmas presents they
had intended to deliver to relatives.
The incredible poverty O'Neil-Ortiz
encountered in many cities shocked him.
"I usually try not to think of this country as a first-world country mixed with a
third-world country, but there are actually
areas that are extremely rundown," he
said.
O'Neil-Ortiz, one of the first members of
the anti-war organization, Why War?, said
the desire to take this trip stemmed from

both personal and activist-oriented motivations. While he wanted to travel, see the
nation and take a break from schoolwork,
he also wanted an opportunity to observe
how the anti-war movement operates and
progresses.
The motivation to examine the anti-war
movement also grew from the desire to
expand the activities of Why War?. In
attempting to form a coherent strategy for
the future, Why War? members realized
they did not even understand the move-

ment.
"I had so little information about the
movement, and it just occurred to me that
no one really knows how the movement

works," O'Neil-Ortiz said.
When he began his trip last September,

O'Neil-Ortiz said that he had no specific
destinations or schedules. Instead, he
decided to travel to places where he could
find no anti-war organization on the
Internet. He assumed that there actually
were organizations; they just weren't publicized. Making few plans in advance, he
walked around college campuses looking at
flyers, hoping to make contact with organizations.
While on the trip, O'Neil-Ortiz said he
recognized the isolation of anti-war groups
and the lack of communication among
them as a major problem.

Andrew Steele Phoenix Staff

Javier O'Neil-Ortiz 'O4 tracked the anti-war movement across the United States.
"Groups like to work in their backyard.
They don't like to coordinate nationally,
which leads to a lot of structural problems," he said. One of his goals was to

increase the communication and information flow between different anti-war organizations.
Through his travels, O'Neil-Ortiz developed a new perspective on the anti-war
movement, and he now envisions a different strategy.

"We should turn a lot of the efforts into
the movement instead of trying so hard to
communicate to people about it. There are
millions and millions of activists. Between
all those people, a lot of stuff could be done
with new forms of dissent," he said.
One ofhis goals is to develop a national
database of organizations, what he calls "a
national phonebook" which will "open up
channels of information." His travels also
inspired him to develop an independent
print newspaper, an outlet for activism that

is more cutting edge than the current forms

of independent media.
O'Neil-Ortiz also sees the future of Why
War? changing. It will be "bigger, better,
wider and more thorough," he said. To
accomplish this, members are attempting
to make Why War? a nonprofit organization; they also plan on creating a second
Web site.
While the first site will focus more on
the analysis and theory of the anti-war

movement, the second will coordinate and

share innovative forms of direct action.
"Originally, we tried to focus on questioning the war," O-Neil-Ortiz said. "We felt
that if you just question the war, we are
confident you will come to the same conclusion as us. But it's been so long. It's been
a year and a half. You can't keep pushing
the war. If you haven't questioned the war
by now, maybe you won't. Maybe we should
move to the next step, acting more, not just
questioning," he said.

Same-sex marriage... or none at all
Dissenters at QSA-sponsored talk decry not gay marriage but the institution itself
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

In the course of Tuesday evening's Queer-Straight
Alliance-sponsored discussion on same-sex marriage, participants called marriage everything from "a desired label"
to "social baggage" and a form of oppression. While the
political issues concerning same-sex marriages arose,
most of the discussion centered on the social significance
of marriage.
"We are socialized into thinking that marriage is the
central concern in our life," Maria-Elena Young 'O4 said.
"But there are all sorts of different identities and diverse
types of couples. Everyone's looking for love, but love
doesn't necessarily equal marriage. That's something for
us to think about."
The discussion, facilitated by Paul Riccio 'OS and Matt
Armstrong 'OS, occurred less than a week after Belgium
became the second nation to successfully extend equal
legal rights to same-sex marriages. The Netherlands
made a similar decision in 200 L While many religions
have ceremonies to establish unions between same-sex
partners, these unions have no legal grounding in the

United States.

"Marriage is not merely a political institution but also
a culturally significant ceremony," Powen Shiah 'O6 said.
"From a social standpoint, it's saying we love each other
and we are committed to each other. You can't discount the
social implications."

THE PHOENIX

"I see this as the next civil rights
movement. I want that. I need to
know how to convince the rest of
the country."
Valerie Maulbeck 'O6
Addie Candib 'O5 said she believed that, regarding marriage, social issues were political. "Marriage is saying that
not only do we love each other but also we want the state
to validate that," she said.
Many students portrayed the fight for same-sex marriages as an issue of equality. Patrick Hart 'O6 said that,
when the law denies legal rights to same-sex marriages, it
holds a heterosexual relationship in higher esteem than a
homosexual one.
Valerie Maulbeck 'O6 agreed. "To allow same-gender
marriages is an injustice. It's not allowing couples to have
the rights they need," she said. "I see this as the next civil
rights movement. I want that. I need to know how to convince the rest of the country."
However, not all attendants believed that establishing
same-sex marriage should be a central goal, and they questioned the priorities of the queer community. Some students expressed concern that same-sex marriage has
February 6, 2003

unfortunately become the "predominant queer issue." In
Amalle Dublon 'O4 said that "the choice to prioritize marriage over other issues, particularly issues of
economic justice, reflects the interests of a particular
socioeconomic slice of the queer population in the United

particular,

States."

The movement to permit same-sex marriage is scattered and fraught with cultural and legislative opposition.
Paul Riccio 'OS described the political situation surrounding same-sex issues as a "dichotomy between the judicial
and legislative branches."
This dichotomy is exemplified by state battles, such as
those in Hawaii. In 1996, a Hawaiian court declared that
denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the
state constitution. In response, however, the legislature
passed a Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined
marriage as a relationship between one man and one
woman.
And although Vermont's supreme court ruled in 1999
that the state must offer same-sex. marriages the same
rights as opposite-sex marriages, the U.S. government
and 36 states currently have DOMAs, which deny recognition to any legal marriage licenses same-sex couples

hold.
Many experts believe that the federal DOMA, which
Congress passed and former President Clinton signed in
1996, is unconstitutional, but it will be impossible to challenge it in court until the right to same-sex marriages is
established in the states.

Lecture addresses fate of 'new economy'

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY SARAH STANTON
sstantol@swarthmore.edu
Just a few years ago, many Americans celebrated the

promise of the "new economy." The phrase described the
economic potential of the 19905, years of growing
American productivity, heady stock market gains, technological innovation and an ever-decreasing unemployment
rate. In sharp contrast, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has
reported six percent nationwide unemployment. The stock
market is struggling, states are having trouble funding
basic public services and President Bush is pushing for tax
cuts even as the U.S. government faces a growing budget
deficit. What happened, and what do we do now?
Tuesday night, Albert Fishlow, professor of interna-

tional affairs and director of the Center for Brazilian
Studies at the Colombia University School of International
and Public Affairs, addressed the current changes in the
U.S. economy at an economics department lecture in Kirby
Hall. Although his lecture, "What happened to the 'New
Economy,'
touched on a variety of issues, he generally
connected the decline of the American economy to a weak
global economy. He also questioned the aptness of
President Bush's response to the situation.
Fishlow opened the lecture by describing the national
debt and the state of the stock market. "We seem to have forgotten the Clinton years" in which economic policy focused
on eliminating the deficit, he said. Fishlow reported that,
today, the United States has a deficit of over $350 billion.
He also focused on the weakness of the U.S. stock market. "Very few people realize that the decline in stock values has been greater [proportionally] than the decline in
"

the Hoover years," prior to the Great Depression.
States has avoided anoth-

According to Fishlow, the United
er major depression thanks to

continued consumption,

increases in residential construction, and population
growth due to immigration for keeping the country out of
another major depression. But he worries about the state
of the economy.
Fishlow traced part of the initial decline in the economy to fundamental changes in the manufacturing industry, both at home and abroad. The United States began to
import technological items, such as computers, very
cheaply, while at the same time losing its edge on many
exports.

"The U.S. has adjusted to demand for imports by borrowing money internationally," Fishlow said. "The United
States today has the largest debt in the world," larger than
the International Monetary Fund allows for developing
nations.

Fishlow wondered what can stabilize the U.S. economy
as the value of the dollar weakens on world markets.
During the 19905, when other countries faced severe economic challenges, the United States was able to act as a
"major bulwark" because of its financial success. But as the
American economy struggles, no other region in the world
is having enough economic success to pull the United States
out of its current recession. Fishlow reported that eastern
Asia is currently the only place in the world with dramatic
growth. This growth, however, depends largely on U.S.
imports and may not remain constant.
President Bush has responded to the current economic
struggles with policies similar to Ronald Reagan's in the
1980s
tax cuts, increases in military spending, and placing greater responsibilities on states, all trying to force a
boom in economic activity.
As for the success of Bush's plan, Fishlow said he was
"not so optimistic" because the United States is in "a weak
world economy." He concluded by saying he felt "a little
worried" that Bush and his administration are focusing

too much on small variables within the country, that they
are neglecting key issues such as productivity and how the
United States fits into the global economy.
When asked about the best thing the United States can
do in its current situation, Fishlow responded plainly:
"Tell the truth." While not wanting to diminish the significance of al-Qaeda and Iraq, he emphasized the need to
give ample attention to the deeper issues within the economy that will dramatically affect the United States in the
future.

Four new members to join SC
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu
With 416 total student votes, three new council
members joined Student Council after a special
election last week.
Appointments Chair Chris Ciarleglio 'O4,
Educational Policy Representative Melinda Lee

'O4 and Campus Relations Representative Audrey
Dorelien 'O4 took office early this week, commencing their term in a retreat with the rest of
the council.
Lee said that, "in a selfish way, [I joined] to
better understand how the educational system
works here." She is excited to continue working
on the issues that are already underway in the
Council of Educational Policies, such as the possibility of eliminating Primary Distribution
Courses (PDCs).
Her unique platform called for students to "not
be mules."
"I knew it was a risk to opt for style as opposed
to content
but in a matter of campaigning, [a
platform] needs to be easy to read and needs to
have some sort of resonance to people," Lee said.
She questioned the place of liberal education
in today's world. "The whole essence of liberal
I don't know if it's congruent with what

the students feel nowadays. Do we really need
four years of liberalness
or do people actually
want more focused things?" Lee asked.
Dorelien said she had wanted to run in past
elections but put it off because of other commitments. After studying abroad last semester, she
realized what she wanted to accomplish at
Swarthmore. "Campus relations representative is
the position I can do best, but I really joined

Council discusses club sport
funding, student wage increase
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ

Student Council will survey
captains of club sport teams to
ascertain their views on funding
for their teams, Student Events

Adviser Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5
said at Tuesday's meeting.
The survey will ask if the captains want additional funding for
equipment and uniforms and
what exchanges they would be
willing to make to receive this
funding from the Athletic Dept.
The survey will also ask captains if they would have played a

varsity sport if the club sport had
not been available, because
Rodriguez noted a suspicion by
the Athletic Dept. that they were
losing athletes to the club sports.
To determine which campus

jobs deserve a wage increase, the
council will create a list of jobs
that are harder or involve more
work than others and those

which are integral to the campus,
according to Secretary Treasurer

Andrew Gisselquist 'O5.

Public Safety warns of

In response to a recent string of thefts from

from Parrish offices. These incidents
occurred on weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Public Safety believes these thefts are related to
an individual seen in Parrish, Kohlberg and

Pearson Halls. The man's behavior has prompted
observers to make numerous reports.
Using these reports, Public Safety sent an e-mail

that described the suspect as a black male who is in
his mid- to late twenties, s'B" to 5'11", with a medium complexion, a medium build, short hair, and
possible facial hair.
The e-mail described theft as the most frequently committed and the most preventable crime on
campus.
It warned the college community to secure personal belongings and not to leave them in unlocked

closets or desks.
Individuals are encouraged to report "suspicious individuals and activity" to Public Safety.

Carmen Duffy, a CSRI member who works in the treasurer's office,
agreed that other colleges need to become involved. "There aren't a lot
of schools out there doing this, if any at all," she said. While some
schools do actively vote on other shareholders' statements, they do not
actually file their own. They need "a better understanding of how to be
a proactive shareholder," Duffy said.
Besides learning more about socially responsible shareholding,
there are many who see divestment as another viable option. This is
outside of the realm of the CSRI, although one committee member,
Harris Kornstein 'O6, is working on a divestment campaign with about

six other students.
But shareholder activism will probably be the method most utilized

One of McCabe library's laptops was stolen this week.

McCabe laptop stolen
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
One of the laptop computers
available for rental at McCabe
Library was stolen Sunday
evening after a student left the
computer unlocked and unattended while he went to dinner.
The computer was reported
stolen at 5:55 p.m., when the student returned from dinner and
could not locate the computer,
according to Public Safety and
library staff members.

The student had signed a document stipulating his financial
responsibility for the Dell
Latitude c6lO. If the computer is
not recovered, the college will
bill the student for the full cost of
replacing it, probably around
$1,500.

I'm back. Your favorite queer. The one that first

brought you "Sex and the Swattie." And someone who
essentializes as often as Marian Fahy sends out open

I am generalizing in my next statement. In my experi
ence, the gay male community seems much more open
about moving quickly into physical intimacy than the
straight community. Many queer males I know are al
over each other faster than you can say "interpretation

are queers programmed differently?
Sex and the Swattie
Take, for example, Stanford and Marcus. For their firs
date, they meet for a Salisbury steak dinner at Sharpies
How romantic. Then, they head to the nearest Paces
party. It doesn't matter whether SASS or the Frisbee team
is throwing it. They're there. Once there, their technically and.artistically effective danc
ing skills make them stand out in the sub par Swarthmore dancing crowd. Perhaps
because of that, or more likely because they want to jump each other, they move on to the
dorms. The Kenneth Cole comes flying off. With condoms blazing, they're in homosexua

heaven.
Compare to Charlotte and Trey. For their first date, they catch the first train to Center
City after seminar. They dine on seafood and pasta at a cozy Italian restaurant. How
romantic. Then, they head to the nearest Ritz theatre. It doesn't matter whether it's Mery
Streep or Adam Sandler. They're there. Once there, they make no moves whatsoever. No
crouching tiger, hidden dragon
if you know what I mean. Perhaps because of that or
more likely because they need to catch the last train, they move on to the dorms. The only
thing that flies off is the train schedule they try to pocket so they can shake hands. With
not so much as a dental dam blazing, they're in heterosexual hell.

Is that it? Plain and simple? Lots of testosterone and
no eggs? Is that all it takes to create a world where
first date equals first lay?

ment is that if you're not worried about accidentally popping out babies, you can go at it

all you want.

Is that it? Plain and simple? Lots of testosterone and no eggs? Is that all it takes to create a world where first date equals first lay? I'm not convinced. So I decided to do some
sexual anthropological research.
Being the overachievers that we Swatties are, we start to pair up even before Screw
arrives. It's like an advanced and twisted form of Bambi's spring time twitterpation. Even
our own Ben Camp is out there dating. Which means more data for me. I decided to ask
around and find out if the straight couples really are dragging out the sexual waiting period like a professor in an honors seminar, and if the queer male couples really are getting
it on like it's Greenbottle already.
It was like finding out that Dawson's Creek is still on the air (albeit for not much
longer). It turned out that I was completely wrong. There were gay male couples who
chose the handshake over the handjob, and there were straight couples who chose anal
sex over anal dating rules. Whodathunk?
And so it turns out, deciding how fast to move into the sexual realm is completely independent of sexual orientation. You're thinking duh. Well, sometimes it takes some firsthand accounts to destroy those awful stereotypes, whether they be self-proclaimed or
labeled by others. I guess this means I should join the rugby team to see if it really is the
last bastion of masculinity. (Talk about homoeroticism.) Then again, maybe not.
_

Why the disparity? Shouldn't these couples be equally sexually active or equally sexually conservative? The straights and the gays are as different as Cornell and McCabe.
There are, of course, the two obvious explanations. First of all, two men equals two
loads of testosterone. It's like putting a shoe lover and a purse lover on a shopping spree
together. They go nuts, literally. And second of all, there's no chance of pregnancy here.

Humorous confessions
Clooney's directing debut shows promise but fails to follow variety of plots to fulfillment
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@Swarthmore.edu

George Clooney's directorial debut, "Confessions of a
tries to be a love story, a psychological
drama, a spy movie and a mockumentary. Based on the life
story ofChuck Barris, a successful TV game show creator
who happens to work as a hit man for the CIA in his spare
time, it never really achieves any of its goals. But it is really funny.
But it's not as straightforward as it may seem, and
Clooney's movie wants to be more than just a comedy.
Written by Charlie Kaufman, the scribe behind
"Adaptation," the movie follows the life of Chuck Barris,
played by Sam Rockwell. You know him; he's famous for
playing the Head Thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
The script is adapted from the memoirs of the real Chuck
Barris, the creator of shows such as "The Gong Show" and
"The Dating Game." In his memoirs, he claims to have
been a contracted hit man for the CIA. Apparently, he fits
what Jim Byrd (George Clooney) calls "the profile," whatever that is.
Dangerous Mind,"

Courtesy www.rottentomatoes.com

The movie juxtaposes Barris' rise to fame as the creator
of these first reality TV shows with his life as a hit man.
The funniest parts come in when the winning contestants
are told that they've won a trip "exotic West Berlin" or
"sunny Helsinki" with Barris as a chaperone. The audience is in on the joke, though, and it's apparent that Barris
has chosen these destinations to correspond with his
orders from the CIA.

Barris says that all he ever wanted
in life was sex, and accordingly
gets tons of women, as well as the
nickname "Strawberry Dick."
In between these humorous scenes, Barris' love life and
the choices he must make take center stage. From the
onset, Barris says that all he ever wanted in life was sex,
and accordingly gets tons of women, as well as the nickname "Strawberry Dick." Penny (Drew Barrymore), who
is the love of his life, and the mysterious agent Patricia
(Julia Roberts), whom he meets while on assignment as his
"reward," represent the choices in Barris' life. He loves
Penny, but Patricia is the mystery woman of his dreams.
Clooney also tries to produce a psychological movie.
Barris finds out that another CIA hit man has turned on
this fraternity of hit men and consequently begins to develop paranoia and schizophrenia. Clooney wants this theme
to extend throughout the rest of the movie, but he does not
really succeed. The story is told from the perspective of the
psychologically distraught Barris holed up and naked in a
hotel room, and it seems as though Clooney wants to suggest that Barris' ideas of working for the CIA were just in
his head. But there is too much going on to bring out some
of these more intriguing aspects.
If that's not enough, there are also a few scenes where
real TV people Dick Clark and some guy with a bag over
his head from "The Gong Show"
tell stories about the

Courtesy www.joeblo.com

real Chuck Barris,

creating a kind of documentary effect.
All of these conflicting storylines need to be resolved in
the hour and 53 minute running time, and the audience is
left feeling unsatisfied by any of the plot lines. However,
individually, the parts are great. The acting is top-notch.
Clooney, as the cartoonish CIA agent, nails his own role,
and Drew Barrymore turns out a nice performance. Most
impressive, though, is Clooney's directing style. He frames
shots in a very flashy, appealing manner reminiscent of
some of Steven Soderbergh's works. He also employs different filters to create some interesting cinematographic
effects and washed out images.
«
Though it looks good and is really funny, "Confessions
of a Dangerous Mind" is lacking the ever-important element of a strong focus. It seems as though Clooney has a
long and successful career as a director ahead of him; he
just has to learn to narrow the scope of his entertaining
subjects.

well as a craving for sugary or starchy foods, weight gain, oversleeping, avoidance of

Swarthmore an ideal place for SAD to hit. The disorder has been linked
to the hormone melatonin, which is secreted in greater quantities in the darker days of
winter and has been known to cause symptoms of depression. SAD occurs throughout the
northern and southern hemispheres, but the disorder is rare in those living within 30
degrees of the equator, where daylight hours are long, constant and extremely bright. At
higher latitudes, SAD occurs more often.
Kevin Lull 'O6, a resident of Alaska, recounts his experience
with SAD back home. "Nights are extremely long in winter
in Alaska. In some parts, daylight does not even appear,
which can really affect people's moods," he said. "I've
noticed it in my own community more than in
more southern communities, although I've never
had the disorder myself."
Health professionals, and, yes, our own
Worth Health Center, recommend spending
more time outside, particularly while exercising (OK, I'm sounding like my mother), to
relieve mild SAD. They also suggest rearranging
your room to allow for more sunlight. (Yeah,

For more severe SAD, light treatment, or
phototherapy, has proven to be helpful, as it is
thought to suppress the brain's secretion of
melatonin. Most often, a light box, an extremely bright light that shines
through a filter, can treat SAD patients by imitating the effect of natural sunlight. When
phototherapy doesn't work, doctors may prescribe anti-depressant medications to SAD
patients with severe symptoms.
Swatties are reminded to visit their local Psychological Services Department at Worth
if they feel they are experiencing symptoms of SAD. Psychological Services provides
counseling, weekly therapy sessions and medicinal treatment for SAD. They can be

Greg Tardy, a tenor sax, his

Saturday. The music starts moving at 8 p.m. on 230 Vine Street,

Heather Doyle

As has become customary in the rap
world, K records (the up-and-coming
Olympia, WA underground hip-hop label)
are releasing special vinyl-only instrumental and a cappella editions of the
Microphones' newest full length platter,
respectively entitled "Drums from Mt.
Eerie" and "Singing from Mt. Eerie."
Now, I haven't heard these versions of the
album, but I can only imagine how useful
they would be for DJs who want to slip

some killer breaks and vocal hooks into
their old-skool/underground sets.
The Microphones, despite taking their
name from the revered battle weapon of
hip-hop's past, have made a career of
pushing the genre's boundaries, at times so far as to be confused for
"experimental folky indie-pop." Their range is particularly impressive considering that the Mies posse consists of just one man, Phil
Elvirum, who juggles production and MC duties. His trademark
"10-fi NW" style has been acclaimed as Washington's answer to the
dirty South, while his "poetic" mic skills tend toward the extrametrical and somnolent. Some have even accused him of singing
rather than rapping, but while his flow is quite tuneful, it's not
really on pitch enough to qualify as singing. For Mt. Eerie, he's
assembled a formidable roster of additional vocal talent, including
the sultry-voiced Mirah (K's resident chanteuse), to complement
his storytelling lyrics and sleepy delivery with magisterial chorus-

es of oohs and aahs.
Mt. Eerie is essentially a single piece of music divided into five
long cuts, though the points of division are somewhat arbitrary.
The titular fourth track, for instance ("in which you watch your
killer roll up and kill you. Vultures eat your body and fly off, leavdid I mention this is the
ing the peak empty and windy again"
craziest-ass concept album since Mr. Lif s I Phantom?), starts with
a continuation of the dreamy choral singing in track four. Then,
two minutes in, it suddenly erupts into a menacing, propulsive
ditty which (no joke!) bears an uncanny resemblance to Missy's
"Work It." On "opener" "The Sun," murky, swirling layers of percussion slowly emerge from nothingness, building up from a heartbeat pulse into an otherizing/ever-loving tribal frenzy reminiscent
oflate-'6os Miles Davis. After 10 minutes, this suddenly drops away,
and Phil's voice makes its first entrance, blathering on (about
something deep, I'm sure.) At first a cappella, he's soon joined by
sweet choral vocals and guitars but also more
waves of sound
menacing electric and organic noises that eventually overpower

and consume the whole business.
Okay, so Mt. Eerie is not really a hip-hop album. Though that
much is clear, it's hard to get much further in trying to categorize
it. There's something epic going on here: transcendent perhaps,
bombastic probably, and deeply personal, obviously. But what's
most mystical is how Elvirum manages to tackle his grand,
abstract, universal, ill-defined themes and emerge with a record so
worthwhile, down-to-earth, and eminently listenable.

Large-scale woes
We Swarthmore students seem to have a strained
relationship with our college entertainment scene. As
far as entertainment goes, Swarthmore is not really the
place to look. We're not in the business of having the
coolest, best publicized shows in Pennsylvania every
year. There are higher priorities in our budget than
holding concerts, and, when we do provide entertainment, it's meant as a community event for aU students
to enjoy. That means certain tradeoffs.

Take the Nickel Creek show last
spring. It brought a reluctant,
skeptical crowd to its feet.
Sure, we could get the Counting Crows like Bates did
if we were willing to charge $25 per ticket, if we had
room in the budget to come up for a $70,000 payment,
and if we could afford to still end up losing $20,000 on
the deal. Unfortunately, we're not, we don't, and we
almost certainly can't.
We have the luxury of paying for all our events out
of a flat annual activities fee, which allows us to hold
all-campus concerts without putting financial burdens
on students. We also believe that everyone should have
a chance to take in some good shows while they're here.
That means that we're committed to having a largescale show every year, unlike, say, our friends at
Haverford, who get a $30,000 show from the Roots one
year and may have nothing at all the next.
Even with budgetary restrictions and incessant complaints from the student body, Swarthmore's large-scale
shows in past years have been successes. Take the Nickel
Creek show last spring. It brought a reluctant, skeptical
crowd to its feet, clapping and cheering for encores from
the energetic, talented bluegrass band right at a moment
when the American public was beginning to rediscover
bluegrass. A concert can have broad appeal even without
a name that's instantly recognizable.
The audience's response in Upper Tarble last year
stands as a pretty good refutation of naysayers' fears.
Sure, not all of us may be Olde Club-frequenting hardcore indie fans, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy a
band that isn't currently on the Top 40.
The complaints that sweep over us during largescale event planning time should concern the administration rather than irritate them. Maybe if students
voted on the decision instead of waiting for a committee's "yes" or "no," we'd feel better about having our
ideas shot down for being too expensive.

Corrections
The article "Time in Middle East increases student's pacifism" (Jan. 23, pg. 5) contained two
factual errors. Micah White 'O4 was one of Why
War?'s original members, not its founder, and
the events described as happening on
Thanksgiving actually happened on Dec. 2.
A pull quote in the article "South Korean students react to crisis" (Jan. 23, pg. 4) was
wrongly attributed. The quotation beginning
"South Korea is westernized, globalized and
urbanized" came from Soo Kyung Lee 'O5, not
Christine Shin 'O4.
Last week's quote of the week (pg. 2) was misspelled and wrongly attributed. The quote
should read, "We're just a bunch of dumb
Dutchmen," not "Dutchman," and the speaker
was Lana Mervine, not Lamar.
There was an incorrect class year in the article
"Students nervous after Bush speech" (Jan. 30,
pg. 3). Alex Black is in the class of 2004, not
2003.

Haendler misinterpreted karma
Dear Editor:
In his opinion piece "Karma kills American left" (Jan.
23), David Haendler displays a striking ignorance of the
Buddhist idea of karma, which he devotes several paragraphs to mocking. To Haendler, "karmic retributions"
involve a poor rebirth, perhaps as a bat or a rattlesnake,
as a consequence of misdeeds in the present life.
Certainly, this is one aspect of karma. "Karmic retributhat is, if you
tion," however, can also be immediate
create bad karma now, the consequences may become
apparent during this life, not the next. This is known as
"instant karma."
For example, suppose I abuse my spouse, then become
involved in a relationship in which I myself am abused
that's instant karma. Or suppose I attack a country
because I'm not fond of its dictator, and thousands of
innocent civilians die. Then, suppose the surviving citizens of that country become "nuke-toting Islamakazes"
(as Haendler labels them) who are bent on retaliation.
Guess what? That's instant karma, too. Whether you're a
Buddhism adherent or simply a believer in the theory
that chickens come home to roost, this idea is neither

"loopy" nor far-fetched. Therefore, maybe George W.
about karmic retriBush should indeed be "worrying
...

butions when pondering what to do about Iraq."
What's even more disturbing than Haendler's willingness to deride a concept he clearly doesn't understand
(or his infuriatingly condescending view of the average
"Joe Sixpack" and "Sally Lunchpail") is his depiction of
Buddhism as generally flaky. "Most Americans," he
sniffs, "do not consider righting the cosmic balance to be
a legitimate goal of foreign policy."
Most sincere Buddhists, if they used the phrase
"righting the cosmic balance" at all, would probably use
it in the sense of "resolving conflicts and peacefully rectifying injustices." Isn't that what much of foreign policy
is all about?

Haendler concludes his series of snide jabs at the
American left by saying, "Bring on the war, and bring on
the karmic retribution. I'm looking forward to spending
my next life as a rattlesnake." Perhaps the columnist
should consider tempering his arrogance with a bit of
Buddhism's most fundamental principle: compassion.

The myths about
affirmative action

by

op-art

annie

ronan

A HOPEFUL THOUGHT

It wasn't so long ago that Trent Lott admonished the Republican
on race issues and voiced his overwhelming support for affirmative action. He took the words right out of my
mouth. Had Washington finally embraced the goal of racial equity?
Could we now gather "round the campfire in harmony and join in a
Trent-led chorus of "Kumbaya"?
Not so quick. The month following
Trent's declaration has seen a vicious
debate over affirmative action, and the
next couple of months may prove whether
Party for its dubious stance

all that show of equality promotion is for
real. The upcoming University of
Michigan Supreme Court decision could
have a significant impact on minority representation on campuses, in high-level
jobs and in high-income brackets. Before
it's too late, we must reexamine the myths
ofaffirmative action opponents and take a
good, hard look at their destructive
effects.

MAYA SCHENWAR

Swat Meets World

Myth 1: Without affirmative action, college admissions would be a "free market,"
with the same opportunities for all. The
current system is biased against whites.
As Trent so poignantly noted in his
interview with Black Entertainment

Television last month, discrimination and inequality still haunt
America, especially in education. Consider the funding discrepancies
in New York: Districts with the most minority students receive over
$2,000 less than those with the most white students. These discrepancies influence who gets to go to college, as high schools with fewer
resources have less money for college counseling, test prep, and, well,
teaching. Even with affirmative action, minorities are underrepresented on selective campuses. Take our poster college, the University of
Michigan, whose student body is a whopping 8.4 percent AfricanAmerican and 4.7 percent Latino. The law school student body is only
6.7 percent African-American. Is this a case of bringing down the white
guy? I think not. It's a modest attempt to level a playing field grossly
tipped toward the white end of the spectrum.
Myth 2: But when you "level out the field," you're admitting people
who don't deserve it just because they're minorities.
Maybe our "leveling-out" analogy needs to go. It makes it too easy
for opponents to interpret affirmative action as an abandonment of
qualification criteria, a kind of welcome-to-college invite for anyone
who can flaunt the label "minority." In reality, affirmative action makes
race, ethnicity and gender additional criteria in choosing among qualified applicants. Just because applicants are qualified doesn't mean they
necessarily get in.
Lots additional factors are considered: athletic ability, musicianship, handwriting, whether you trip over your shoelaces at the interview. Many prominent members of our government have benefited
from "affirmative action" in its legacy form. In fact, our venerable president, a middling high school student, might never have been able to
experience Yale had such preference not been granted. How can we jus
tify shutting down the race and ethnicity branch of affirmative action,
which strives to balance effects of historic and current discrimination,
while still upholding the legacy branch, which consistently favors the
progeny of rich, old-stock white families? College is hardly a free-for-all
for people of color; affirmative action simply makes it a little more
accessible to people without a Yale coat of arms branded on the family
:

tree.
Myth 3: Eliminating affirmative action would not result in fewer stu-

dents of color.
The numbers speak for themselves: The year the University of Texas
halted affirmative action, African-American applicants dropped by 42
percent in the law school and 26 percent in undergraduate admissions.
Hispanic applicants dropped 23 percent. The elimination of affirmative
action discouraged a significant percentage of students from even
applying. When California's Proposition 209 banned affirmative action
for public universities in 1996, the graduate system's minority population took a plunge. At Boalt law school in Berkeley, there was only one
black student in the 1997 freshman class of 270 students.
"I strongly support diversity of all kinds," President Bush
announced last month. Touching. But the California case makes clear
that maintaining diversity requires action, not lip service.
The University of Michigan decision will have lasting implications
for equality in college admissions. If Trent Lott and friends are really
serious about tackling issues of equity, they should get active and lobby
for the endangered cause of affirmative action.

Racism is about more than money
Dear Editor:
In his op-ed "Reconceiving affirmative
action" (Jan. 30, pg. 19), Randy Goldstein makes
several arguments against affirmative action as
it exists today. Although I agree that the existing system is flawed, I don't believe that exclusively class-sensitive policies will provide a
solution. Goldstein implies that middle- and
upper-class blacks are somehow immune to
racism, a belief which to me demonstrates a
serious lack of understanding of the complex
nature of racism in the United States. Wealth

does not make one immune to racism. Goldstein
writes that the use of racial criteria in affirmative action is an easy way out. I am struck by
the seeming ease with which Goldstein is able to
write off the significance of race in this country.
The New York Times recently reported on a
study done at MIT in which job applications

were submitted for fictional applicants who
were identical in all criteria save their names.
There was a group of applicants with traditionally black names and a group with traditionally
white names. Mr. Goldstein might be surprised
to learn that the applicants with the common
white names were 50 percent more likely to be
called for interviews than the applicants with
common black names.
I graduated from a high school that had a
straight-up quota (35 percent non-white and nonAsian) until about six years ago, and I watched
as a variety of alternatives were considered.
From where I stand, affirmative action should be
situation-specific as possible and include
class- and race-sensitive policies, acknowledging
that we live in a country rife with both classism

as

and racism, institutional and otherwise.

The maroon narrative
There are four types of American blacks, yet we only
hear about three: the house slave, the field slave and the
free slave. (I call free blacks of antebellum times "free
slaves," for people who can't vote, who can't own guns,
who can't testify against whites, who are subject to reenslavement and who are
insecure in their properties

are not citizens and are therefore not free). The fourth
type, the maroon, we hardly
ever hear about. Yet the
maroon is as emblematic of
American manhood as the
samurai is of Japanese manhood, as the Teutonic Knight
is of German manhood.
Bushido in Japan is Kultur in
Germany is Marronage in the

the house slave and field
slave and free slave stereotypes, but we know nothing
February Historian
about the maroon archetype.
Thus, blacks have been
cast as bit-players of the socalled "Master Narrative," that American drama of white
Anglo-Saxon Protestants ruthlessly achieving their "man-

rate, but equal, maroon destiny. It's called "Marronage."
Marronage is the Haitian Revolution, 1791 to 1804, a
French colony of half a million blacks becoming the first
independent state of Latin America. That colony, Saint
Domingue, was to be a Napoleonic base of operations for
the French empire in the Americas. But, led by Toussaint
L'Ouverture, Saint Domingue defeated Napoleon and,
thus eliminating him as a player on the American stage,
precipitated Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase. On Jan. 1,
1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, successor to L'Ouverture,
issued his own declaration of independence and renamed
the former colony "Haiti."

name, a maroon narrative wherein the black man is protagonist, wherein he fulfills his own destiny as a freedom
fighter, wherein he epitomizes "Give me liberty or give
me death!" For "manifest destiny" there is indeed a sepa-

Marronage is the Maroon Peace Treaty of 1739, which,
signed by the maroon chief Cudjoe and the British governor of Jamaica, Sir Edward Trelawny, settled the First
Maroon War of 1729 to 1739. That war earned the Jamaican

maroons their autonomy and their freedom from British

taxes. Every year, on Jan. 6, they celebrate that treaty,
still in effect to this day, in Accompong, the principal
maroon village in Jamaica, named after the supreme deity
of the Ashanti religion.
Marronage is the 60,000 maroons of Suriname, a.k.a.
"Bush Negroes," maintaining their integrity as six types
ofAfrican tribesmen: 25,000 Djuka, 25,000 Saramaka, 2,500
Matawai, 2,500 Aluku, 2,000 Paramaka and 500 Kwinti.
During the 17605, the first three, the three biggest, signed

treaties with the Dutch authorities, whose repeated
attempts to enslave them had failed. The Dutch officially
abolished slavery in 1863, but that was long after the
maroons had won their sovereignty, a sovereignty they

enjoy to this day.

Marronage is the First Seminole War, 1816 to 1818, i.e.,
the maroons of Florida successfully resisting Gen.
Andrew Jackson's attempt to re-enslave them. These
maroons were blacks whose ancestors (and who themselves in many cases) had escaped to Florida, mostly from
Georgia and the Carolinas, to live as free people under the
Spanish crown. Jackson failed, so on Feb. 22, 1819, the
United States bought Florida for $5 million so as to bring
the maroons, as well as their allies, the Seminoles, under
U.S. rather than Spanish jurisdiction. The Second
Seminole War, 1835 to 1843, was yet another failed attempt
by the U.S. government to re-enslave the maroons, yet the
maroons were forced out of Florida and many ended up in
Mexico, still a free people.
Marronage is many things besides, but, at bottom, it is
a warrior ethic. The maroon, not Sambo, not Uncle Tom,
is our protagonist in the saga that is American history. As
a warrior and soldier, he resisted slavery and waged per-

petual war against the slavocracy. He refused to give in to
those who would own him as property. He was the bane of
"white supremacy" throughout the Americas from the
early 1500s on. The maroon single-handedly debunks the
myth of the docile slave. Indeed, the very etymology of
"maroon," from the Spanish "cimarron" meaning "wild,
untamed," speaks to the fear he struck in the heart of
every would-be slave master. The Great Emancipator
freed the slave in America, but the maroon, signer of
treaties, declarer of independence, was already free.

When should Bush say 'God'?
Religion has no place in State of the Union address, but it belongs in response to Columbia tragedy
I heard President Bush deliver two speeches last week. During his
State of the Union address on Jan. 28,1 physically cringed at each mention of God. As spectators around me laughed and mocked Bush's references to providence, I experienced pangs of confusion along with
each of my cringes. Since I'm a
J
Christian, shouldn't I have agreed

rather than felt ashamed? I hoped the

memory would fade quickly; yes, I
would just wait it out until a candim I

president. But on Feb. X a different
m m
tragedy struck America; with the

Columbia, I once again listened to
Bush's remarks. This time, however, I found myself agreeing
with him, saying "amen" to the
phrases of comfort and hope
he offered from Isaiah. So
why did I cringe on

Tuesday but say "amen"

on Saturday?

I cringed during the
State of the Union address
because I agreed with Bush's statements about God but disagreed with most of the rest of the speech. Although Bush
presented some interesting proposals for dealing with the
AIDS epidemic and the national health care crisis, I was
deeply saddened by the direction in which he is leading this
country regarding the war on Iraq. In his speech, Bush said,
"We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be
defended If war is forced upon us, we will fight
in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in
every way we can, the innocent." This in itself
made me weep, but the "cringe moment" came
when this strong possibility of war was closely followed by the statement: "We do not claim to know aU the
ways of providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind aU of life and all of history. May

He guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States of
America."
I certainly do not know all the ways of providence, but I honestly
cannot see how war with Iraq is the direct result of trusting in God.
So I pray that God wiU guide us toward real peace, not just homeland security. I wish that terrorists could learn the meaning of
Christian mercy rather than "American justice." I do believe in
the sovereignty of a loving God, but I don't believe this translates
to the sovereignty of America. For all I know, a war on Iraq could
mean the destruction of America. I cringed because I felt Bush
was suggesting something that I don't think can be done in the
name of Jesus. Let not my will, but God's, be done.
Christianity is about grace, about abundant and unconditional love. Tragically, when grace and power are mixed in
this fallen world, it is often at the expense of grace. I can see
seeds of this tension even within myself. Maybe that's why
I'm more likely to vote for someone who doesn't bring up
the name of God in his public policies. I fear that the
use of God's name will truly be in vain, so I seek to
push it out of national politics.
My political choices are, in part, the result of my
giving in to the idea that the public and private
spheres of life must be separate. I could say "amen" to
Bush's biblical references comforting those who mourned
the Columbia disaster because I felt that he was acting as
a person, not as a political figure. It seemed that he was
acting in more of a private sphere, even if it was on national television. But the irony of my reaction is that I have
discovered that I myself cannot live by separating my public life from my private life. I cannot simply push aside my
identity as a Christian in the public sphere. And yet I try to
elect candidates who do. I have much left to
learn. Meanwhile, I will pray for our president
and country, trying to love a president whom
m I deeply disagree with and contributing
toward policy changes in any way that I can.

For years, the GOP has tried to position itself as the
party of limited government. According to the party, it
was the one in favor of keeping government spending to
a minimum and letting the free market work its magic,
while the Democrats were a pack of big-spending,
bureaucracy-loving socialists.
Republicans
still
haven't dropped that rhetoric, but they've proven it to
be a lie. Right now we've got

i

a lot more than it has in the past, but it's going to spend
money that it doesn't even have. The supply-side thinking which George Bush the Elder once referred to as
"voodoo economics" has made a comeback.
The worst thing about all this is its likely effect on
future generations. By going buck wild with deficit
spending, the government is forcing a heavy burden
upon the taxpayers of tomorrow. I'm not planning on
having children, but I would very much like to be
cloned by the Raelians. Sadly, due to George W.
Bush's free-spending ways, Dave Haendler v2.0 is
hj
going to be living with high taxes, low investment
and a national debt so massive that it crushes

Moreover, big government generally implies
intrusive government. Bureaucracies have to do
something in order to justify their budgets,
which means more regulation and state planning. My poor clone will be growing up in a
nation where the feds meddle in the affairs
of states, cities and individuals even

But even if you factor out the costs of the wars on terrorism and Iraq, the cost of government is out of control.
According to an analyst from Fortune magazine, only

College wins recycling contest

Missing Mommy

Students recycled an average of 56 pounds over an eight-week period

House mothers could save Willets

Dear Editor:

I'd like to take you back in time. In a
foggy time known as last semester, you
received a thank-you, in this very
newspaper, for having recycled anything, ever. This thank-you came at the
beginning of a great adventure, known
as Rush to Recycle, in which all on campus took part. It was a long (eight
weeks), toilsome (big thanks to all of
the hardworking staff who made it possible) and perilous (I can't back that up)
journey, but Swarthmore came out on
top of the mountain. Of all of the colleges and universities of Pennsylvania
that took part in this journey, of those
fine institutions that had the audacity
to compete with us, we recycled the
most per student. Indeed, we more than
doubled how much we recycle on a
daily basis over the eight weeks, and
the average Swarthmore student had
the strength of wrist and moral fiber to
toss over 56 pounds of goodies into the
good bins, which just so happens to be
the best (see www.dep.state.pa.us/host-

16

ing/rushtorecycle/popup.htm). It's a
good thing that you are not after mere
glory, but seek instead the humble
knowledge that your trek to bring it to
the bin served to better the world. And
you did, Swarthmore. You recycled to

save the world, and the $1,500 dollars
that you won as a result means nothing
to you.

This investment of
$1,500 will save the
college something on the
order of $126,000 over a
20-year period.
Unless (as that old rock the Lorax
left behind said) that money were used
to keep Swarthmore on the trail ofmaking less of a negative environmental
impact. If it were, then it would surely
mean something to all of you. (Actually,
...

the

Pennsylvania

Department

of

Environmental Protection stipulates
that we have to use the money that way,
but would we really want it any other
way?) So the money will be used, indirectly, to purchase new LED-based
bulbs for exit signs across campus,
which will save a lot of electricity.
Thereby, this investment of $1,500 will
save the college something on the order
of $126,000 over a 20-year period (see

www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/cever-

bal/Class/Greenlnitiatives.html).
Who knows what kind of magic
could be made with that? So way to go,
Swarthmore. The Lorax would be
proud of you, and as my beloved professor Charles Grinstead loves to write in
the middle of many-chalkboard-spanning calculus problems, "Thus emboldened by our success, we journey forth
...."
Likewise, in the middle of our great
recycling safari, we continue to flick
our refuse-filled fingers toward the
blue and gray treasure chests.
Keefe Keeley 'O6

February 6, 2003

Dear Editor:
As one of the few people who lived in Willets
for three years (albeit 25 years ago), I would like
to propose that one of the things that can be
done to reduce vandalism is to restore the position of "house mother."
For quite a while, the house mother was
indeed a middle-aged woman who lived in an
apartment on the first floor near the lounge. I'm
not sure what all of her responsibilities were,
but they certainly included being a shoulder to
cry on, baking cookies, teaching the guys how
to work the laundry machines and generally
being an adult presence.
Even when the "house mother" was Cigus

Vanni, male and a recent graduate, he served
the same functions.
If the RAs don't want to be responsible for
discipline, perhaps the house mother can be.

Bullets barrage Garnet Tide Badminton off to fast start
from three-point territory
From BADMINTON, pg. 20

BY ERIKA DOYLE

The fight was not enough. Despite
intense efforts from several individuals,
the conference challenge proved to be too
great for our Garnet squad as they lost a
tight away game to Gettysburg this past
Saturday, 71-64. David Pearce 'O3 led Swat

with 15 points, while Chris Loeffler 'O4
and Josh Loeffler 'O3 each added 12
points, but the Garnet could not overcome Gettysburg's hot second-halfshooting, which sent Swarthmore below .500
in the Centennial
Conference.
The Garnet constantly battled for
the lead against the
Bullets in a game

as the fourteenth male in Swarthmore
men's basketball history to reach
points.

Swarthmore fell at home to confer59-45, on
ence rival Haverford,
Wednesday. Haxel recorded a doubledouble with 10 points and 12 boards,
adding four blocked shots. Jacob
Letendre 'O4 led Swat with 11 points, and
Matt Gustafson 'O5 chipped in with
seven. But poor shooting from the field
plagued Swarthmore all night. The Fords

adjusting their three-point shooting
down the stretch and making clutch
attempt decisions. Leading 51-49 with 8:12
left on the clock, a Ryan Page triple hiked
the lead up to five as he hit the first of
four BuUet 3-pointers. Blair Haxel 'O5
retaliated with a jumper but Dami
Oloruntoba sank a three to give the
Bullets a six-point advantage. With 4:46

layups between an Oloruntoba layup to
propel the Tide within two at 59-57. Much
to the Tide's dismay, the Bullets countered with a Page triple and six straight

game tends to be crazy, and when you let

is when you do not play all that well,"
Josh Loeffler said.
Yesterday, the Garnet men challenged

season. In their last encounter, the
Garnet Tide left with an electrifying conference victory that blew the Shoremen

said before the game.
Entering the game, Washington was
coming off an aggressive 96-86 upset of
nationally ranked Franklin & Marshall
this past Saturday. As a result, Wimberly
said, "[They] will be sky-high for this
game." However, he remained confident
in his team's abilities and fighting talents. "I hope that our guys, having been
very competitive with one of the league's
top teams on the road, will go into the
Washington game with the confidence
that, if we play well, we can will the

"I thought we played quite well
against Gettysburg, particularly in the
first half when we defended their
'Princeton-style' offense very well. I also
felt we did one of our best jobs of the year
on the boards in the game," head coach
Lee Wimberly said after the game.
However, the Tide's efforts were tamed
by Gettysburg's impressive shooting
behind the arc, which ultimately deter-

mined the outcome. "The difference in
the game was their ability to hit the
three-pointer and our inability to hit it,"
Wimberly said.
Following the heartbreaking loss to
Gettysburg, co-captain David Pearce 'O3

to show that such poor play should not occur on the highest level ofbasketball.
Many state that Walton has no place to be so critical of NBA players. I think just
the opposite. Too many broadcasters go out of their way to stay in the middle of the
road, worried that criticism will hurt their standing with the athletes. Instead, these
announcers should perform as a good journalist would; point out bad play when it
happens, and applaud the good when it too occurs.
The latter is the facet of Walton's repertoire that most often goes overlooked.
While Big Red will discuss in length and detail the mistakes that are made, he will
also highlight the highlights. No other announcer shows a love for the game like
Walton. He talks endlessly of the beauty and transcendence of the game. He dotes on
great passing, a well set screen, a beautiful jumper. Walton is the fan's fan. His love
for the game is evident in every contest that he attends.
Of course, I doubt that many of you will look for the positive aspects of Walton's
broadcasting the next time that you tune in to one of his games. It is much easier to
sit back and throw things at the television screen when you happen to disagree, But
this is all right, as well. I mean, there have to be two types of people in this world:
those who love Bill Walton, and those who do not.

Though Swarthmore's Blue
Route neighbors captured a first-place victory at the PAIAW Championship tournament
last weekend, the match is by no means out of

Having just competed against their opponents at PAIAW's on Saturday, the
Swarthmore team would love a second
chance to win. "I feel like the team's performance is near its peak and things can go our
way," Morris said. Larson echoed that comment and indicated she hopes to avenge the
loss she and Gupta suffered over the weekend.
With an unparalleled competitive drive,
the badminton team will train hard today and
hope that effort translates into an upset.
Loomis is excited about the prospects of
the match. "We need to get out to a fast start

a really good PAIAW tournament last week so
their confidence will be high coming into the

is if we can put pressure on them early and

Women's hoops preps for another playoff run

As the saying goes, "The more

just two returning starters, one

ward Katie Robinson 'O4 is still

very good possibility that playoffs
will be part of their season again.
Indeed, after half a season of

increasing success both individuas a team, the Garnet are
still singing the same tune of playing intense defense and taking it
"one game at a time." And with
six regular-season games left to
play, the future looks good, real
good.
"I think the team is going to
peak at just the right time,"
Shibles said. "I'm excited about
ally and

what we can do. I think we'll be
hard to beat in the playoffs."
But while Shibles has confi-

dence in her team, she is quick to
stress a season-long theme of concentration. "The focus has to be on
the next game, the next competitor." Shibles said. "We have to stay
focused on the next competition
and on doing the little things."

seem that the Shorewomen are
just a stepping stone for a Garnet
run towards the playoffs, Shibles
made sure to prepare her team.
"I never feel safe," Shibles said.
"You can't ever rest against
[them]."
Indeed, last Saturday, F&M was
up on Washington by 20 points
with just four minutes left when
the Shorewomen launched a late
run. F&M's lead quickly diminished, and the Diplomats scraped
by with a four-point victory.
Last week, Swarfhmore split
two conference games, romping
over Haverford 72-36 before dropping a hard-fought Gettysburg
game 61-58. Robinson posted two
consecutive double-doubles, averaging 20.3 points, 8.7 rebounds and
6.3 steals in last week's three
games, earning a spot on the
Centennial Conference Weekly
Honor Roll.

Lately Shibles has been asking

ference games for the Garnet,

the team to play a "full 40 minutes
of basketball." Forward Alison
Wolff 'O5 literally did so at
Gettysburg, playing the entire
game. While at first glance the

including the home rematch
against Muhlenberg. Also, the
team has yet to play West powerhouses Johns Hopkins and
&

Marshall. The latter

"She's one of the most consistent players on the team," Shibles
said. "Consistency in athletes is
invaluable."

Wolff has started all 18 games
for the Garnet, and leads the team
in rebounding, averaging 7 caroms per game. Her 15 season
blocks are a clear head above the

rest of the Garnet.
"Ali is a constant force for our
team," Debbie Farrelly 'O6 said.
"In a tough game, even when
things aren't going her way, you
can always rely on Ali to be there
when you need her."

Wolff has stepped into her new

role on the team with grace.
"It's pretty amazing. I didn't
actually expect to be such a huge
part so early on in my career," she
remarked last week. "I hope to
continue to contribute as much as
I have lately. The team is a great
bunch of girls to work with. We all
get along really well."
Gettysburg also featured a
strong defensive performance by
rookie center Radiance Walters
'O6. With the assignment of shutting down the conference-leading
rebounder Jay Hodge, Walters
kept the Bullets to a minimal
inside threat until getting into foul
trouble.
"Radiance has a lot of presence
on the court," Shibles said. "She
really hustles on defense, and on
offense she can power the ball
hard to the basket. It's nice to have
power post play on the court."
Saturday's game against F&M
will be an important one.
Robinson will square off against

Harriers Golden, Ash dominate 3000-meter run
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
The Garnet men's and women's indoor track and field
teams traveled to Franklin & Marshall College to compete
in the annual lannicelli Indoor Classic this past weekend
in Lancaster. Following a successful team performance at
last weekend's Haverford Invitational, the Tide looked to
further solidify its squad, with the much-anticipated
Centennial Conference Championship less than a month
away.
On the women's side, Sarah Kate Selling 'O3 broke the
school pole vault record that she set by clearing 7'6".
Selling, whose personal outdoor best is B'L25" and whose
practice best is B'6", was pleased with her performance,
considering a recent NCAA rule change which set a minimum 18-inch distance between the bar and the box.
"Saturday was the first time I've vaulted in competition
this year," Selling explained. "Coming into the meet, I
had hoped to clear at least B', but considering the rule
change, I was pleased to clear 7'6."
"Until this year, we've been allowed to have the bar as
close to or as far (from the box) as we want. This year, the
bar must be at least 18 inches behind the box. Since I'm
used to vaulting with the bar 10 inches from the box, this
is a big change. Once I've adjusted to this change, my
goals for the rest of the indoor season are to clear 9' or
9'6" in competition and hopefully to place in the top five
at the conference championship," Selling explained.
The women's 4x400-meter relay team finished third
with a season-best time of 4:24.82, and Elizabeth Gardner
'O5 paced the harriers with a 400-meter time of 61.2 seconds. Gardner attributes her early success to her rigor-

ous cross-country training, especially over winter break.
"I officially started training in August for cross-country, and, after a successful season, I took a few weeks off
before starting to run again for indoor," Gardner said.
"When I was at home over break, I trained through some
harsh North Dakota weather
one run was in 10-below
weather
but I think that it did make me stronger. The
combination of the cross-country training and the training that I did at home over break has made the transition
into indoor much smoother, and I hope that it will keep
me strong for the rest of the season."
Sarah Hobbs 'O6 ran a personal best in the 3000-meter
run with an 11:10 time. Njideka Akunyili 'O4 (5:17.57) and
Molly Maurer 'O6 (5:19.07) placed third and fourth respectively in the 1500-meter run. Jessica Zagory 'O5 rounded
out the slate of impressive finishes for the women, finishing a top-10 performance in the 55-meter hurdles.
On the men's side, harriers James Golden 'O5 (9:01) and
Garrett Ash 'O5 (9:13) finished first and second among collegians in the 3000-meter run. Golden has been training
since December in preparation for the conference championship meet.

"Three or four days out of each week I run distance,
two days of the week I do track workouts and the other
day I race," he explained. "Before this meet, I did track
at race pace so I would

learn what the pace felt like."
"This season, I want to beat most of the Haverford
guys at the conference championship meet and run under
8:50 for the [three-kilometer]. I also want to beat the [fivekilometer personal record] of our assistant coach, Joko
Agunloye 'Ol, by more than 2:00," Golden said.
For Ash, meet preparation has focused primarily on

February 6, 2003

the mental approach. "This season, I've based my train-

ing around the idea that relaxation is the first step

toward focus," he explained. "It's a philosophy the coaches have helped me learn, and I'm finding it to be a healthy
perspective. I've been trying to take things one day at a
time, not put too much pressure on myself, and not strain
my body unnecessarily.
"The philosophy of taking things one day at a time sort
of precludes the setting of seasonal goals, at least quantitative ones. However, I'm hoping to continue improving
on making a contribution to the team," Ash said.
Off the track and on the field, Rob Melick 'O3 continues
his strong senior indoor campaign, as he finished second
in the shot put event with a throw of 41'8.75". Melick says

he owes his success to coach Mudrick, a former
Swarthmore track and field coach who now volunteers
his time to teach throwers and pole-vaulters technique.
"I remember all of the techniques before entering the
circle. Staying low, going quickly across the circle, planting properly, and extending my throwing arm at the end,"
Melick said. "However, when I am in the circle,
[Mudrick] tells me to forget all of that and let the muscles
do their thing. Coach Mudrick is a great coach and is the
reason I am enjoying success this year."
Melick added, "I was happy with my performance at
the F&M Meet, because all of my throws were over 40 feet.
I am becoming much more consistent, and that is a good
thing. I look forward to the rest of the meets this year as
tune-ups for the most important meet, the Centennial
Conference Championship. My goal for this season is to
win the conference shot put title for indoor and outdoor
as to make our team competitive as possible for a team
title."

Bill Murray's ingenious character Bob Wiley once stated:
"There are two types of people in this world. Those who like
Neil Diamond, and those who don't." I think that this is a
valid point. Neil Diamond, like few other musicians is an
individual who must either be enjoyed or hated. There is no
room for the middle ground
in discussing this figure. The
sports world is littered with
these types of individuals.

ily Can draw the ire or the

broadcaster.
Since the days of Howard
Cosell, broadcasters have
become characters, individuals whose personalities are as

large as the athletes and whose role in the sport rivals the people playing. The most popular sports broadcasters are generally the ones who are as likely to upset as they are to provide
critical insight. The reason for the popularity is quite easy to
see. Even though a provocative announcer is likely to infuriate the viewing audience, the ability to infuriate is the same as
the ability to entertain. It is far more exciting to tune in to
someone who has an opinion, will state it no matter what the
consequences, and could not care less what anyone else thinks
of the stance.
For an unbelievable study on this topic, one simply need
turn to the NBA. Now broadcasting the most watched games
for this league is the most controversial, declarative voice in
sports today: Bill Walton. Just the mention of the name is
enough to spark heated debate, and for that reason alone, I

It is easy to paint Walton into a corner. It is simple to portray him as the bitter announcer who only wishes to point
out the flaws in everyone else. It is easy to pay attention to
only the negative statements that he makes. It is easy, but
leads one far from the truth.
Does Walton make statements that tear a NBA athlete to
pieces? The answer is obviously yes. When watching the
highly publicized matchup between the Lakers and the
Rockets, Walton stated that two errant passes were the worst
in the history of the Rockets franchise. He then went on to
say that Shaq's deragatpry comments concerning the nationality of Chinese Yao Ming were ignorant, and had no place in
the game today. These types of statements are part of the
everyday Walton arsenal, used to depict and analyze a game
as vividly as his vocabulary will allow.
When one takes a step back and dissects the comments
that Walton makes, the picture becomes a bit more clear. Yes,
the statements about the passes were obvious exaggerations.
But hyperbole is a tool wielded by Walton to get the point
across that professional basketball players should not make
these types of boneheaded errors. The statement about Shaq
was dead on. Shaq made fun of China, Asians and Yao, simply because he is of a different culture. There is no place for
such behavior in the NBA. Granted, Walton does get carried
away from time to time. Most of his analysis contains the
truth, though. One need only look through the humor and
blatant exaggeration to understand that Walton is attempting

On Tuesday night, with a few
swings of the racquets, the Garnet
badminton team easily defeated
Albright College 4-1. In little under
an hour, Swarthmore secured wins
in all three singles competitions as
well as in a doubles match, improving to a perfect 3-0 in Philadelphia
Area Intercollegiate Association for
Women (PAIAW) seasonal play. The
squad also placed second at the
PAIAW Championship tournament
last weekend.
Leading the Garnet to victory

was number one singles player
Surbhi Gupta 'O4. Noted by her
teammates as a true leader, Gupta
beat Nicole Huber 11-9 and 11-4 to
earn a point for the Garnet. Gupta

and Huber are two of the top players in the league, so any match
between them is significant. "I was
nervous about this match," Gupta
said. "Last year she beat me once

and I beat her once. It took me a little while to warm up, but once I did,

it went well."

Coach Jeremy Loomis praised
Gupta's skill and her dedication to
the program. "Surbhi's work ethic
and mental toughness are instrumental in her success," he said.
"Each practice, she's ready to
improve some aspect of her game
and that carries over to her matches.

Each opponent that she faces must
play an outstanding game to have a
chance, because Surbhi doesn't give
away any free points."
In the number two singles
match, Jessica Larson 'O6 beat
Theresha Miller 11-0 and 13-12 in
what Larson calls "the most bizarre

comeback [by an opponent] I've

seen." What aided Larson the most
during the games were her serves.
"I worked a lot on my serves in
practice this week. In the first game
I didn't miss any of them," she said.
Ay Jy Phoun 'O4 rounded out the
singles sweep by clenching the
number three match 13-12, 11-4.
Phoun said that she lacked focus
early on and could have done better
in the first set. And after a quick
