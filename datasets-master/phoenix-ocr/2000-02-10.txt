Carolina training trips canceled

College joinsBryn Mawr, Haverford in NAACP boycott of state
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Joining in the NAACP boycott of South
Carolina, the college has decided to withdraw the spring break plans of six sports
teams to train there. The affected teams
women's lacrosse, softball and tennis,
as well as men's golf and men's and
women's track and field
were scheduled to practice in Myrtle Beach and
Hilton Head but are now arranging to
travel elsewhere.
The decision, made Tuesday afternoon,
follows similaractions by Bryn Mawr and
Haverford as well as Temple University,

which are all supporting the National Association for the Advancement ofColored
People's boycott ofSouth Carolina because
of the Confederate flag that flies over the
state Capitol.
"The Swarthmore College administration, affirming the value this institution
places on a humane and just society, has
decidedthat our spring athletic teams will
support the NAACP boycott ofSouth Carolina over the issue of the continued display of the Confederate flag," President
Al Bloom said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. Bloom was not on campus to comment yesterday.
The NAACP launched what it is calling

"economic sanctions" against the state on
Jan. 1, asking people and groups with
travel plans to South Carolina to cancel
them until the flag is removed from the
state capitol, where it has been flying
since 1962.
"I think in this case you've got a governmental body, the legislature, [displaying a symbol] which signals to a large segment of the population, and not just African-Americans, a time period of violence
and repression, and slavery," said Maurice
Eldridge, the college's executive assistant
to the president.
He said when an organization like the
NAACP takes such a stand, "it fits within

our values to support them."

Tight timing
But the college's decision has the
coaches who had training plans for South
Carolina scrambling to make new arrangements. With the exception of the
men's golf team, all had tentative plans
by yesterday afternoon.
Those plans will not be firm, however,
until the teams can arrange matches in
their new locations. The NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association) requires
that training trips include at least one

"We have to give up our illusion that our ghettoized niche in

advocate of independent party
politics and one of the few liberal
politicians in America to endorse
Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. "The Reform

Connerly, Proposition 209 proponent, speaks tonight
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff

courtesy OFFICE OF NEWS

AND INFORMATION

Ward Connerly speaks today in a visit sponsored by the Swarthmore Conservative Foundation.

Expect controversy tonight when Ward
Connerly, who spearheaded the effort to
end affirmative action in California and
now seeks to do so elsewhere, speaks at
7:30 p.m. in LPAC.
Connerly knows the university circuit,
and rarely does he give a speech without
provoking an angry reaction from his opponents. Connerly has incited responses
ranging from an interruptive shouting
match at the University of Wisconsin to a
"half-baked sale" (designed to draw attention to his "half-baked ideas") at the University of Texas.
At Swarthmore, however, most of
Connerly's opponents plan to dothe Quakerly thing and listen to what he has to say
before generating a reaction. Activists in
groups that tend to be pro-affirmative action, such as Diversity Coalition and the
four Intercultural Center groups, plan to
restrict their attacks to the question-andanswer portion of Connerly's lecture,
which is entitled "Racial Preferences: A
Dying Regime." Diversity Coalition isalso
holding a roundtable discussion at 12:30
p.m. on Friday in the IC to discuss
Connerly's speech.
In recent years, Connerly has come into
the national spotlight for his role in the
passage of California's Proposition 209, a
1996 referendum that ended racial preferences in California. The referendum,
controversially titled the "California Civil
Rights Initiative," has since significantly
affected the treatment given to minorities
by state institutions. At the University of
California-Berkeley's Boalt Hall law
school, for example, admission offers to
African-American students dropped by 81
percent in the year after Proposition 209
went into effect.
Indeed, academic institutions are usually those most affected by such "anti-discrimination" initiatives, and with momentum growing to duplicate Proposition 209
nationwide, it is easy to understand why
Connerly's words don't sit well with many

Students apathetic on calendar issues
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
At a fireside chat about changing graduation date Tuesday
night, members of the Curriculum Committee and Student
Council were joined by only one
other student, evidence that despite an impressive list of calendar changes up for consideration
by thefaculty, most students are
unconcerned about the fate of the
academic calendar.
Responding to the lack of student interest, Registrar Martin
Warner admitted that "calendar
issues are generally uninteresting. They're seen to be relatively
unimportant." According to
Michael Spiegel 'O3, studentrepresentative to the Curriculum
Committee, only one student responded to last week's e-mail poll
about the proposed changes,
which include holding graduation
one week earlier. Student apathy
may leave the final decision entirely up to the faculty, which will
make the ultimate decision on the
recommendations of the Curriculum Committee.
Debate over the amount of
time necessary for Honors exams is at the heart of graduation

date discussion. Under the current calendar, most Honors students take their last written
exam by the second Friday or
Saturday in May, while oral exams do not begin until the following Thursday. The interim period
is technically dedicated to more
written exams and comprehensive exams, but since the length
of the Honors exam period was
set when students took eight
preparations instead of the current four, the interim period is
rarely used for exams. Instead,
Honors students use it to review
for their oral exams.
Under the proposed changes,
the course final period would be
shortened from nine days to
eight. Honors written exams
would be distributed over the
first five of those days, instead
of stretching to 10 exam days, as
under the current schedule. The
new schedule would not allot
time for comprehensive exams,
and oral exams would begin on
the last day of regular course finals.
Students are generally against
shortening the calendar. Sean
Brennan 'OO said that shortening
the exam period is "a horrible,
horrible idea," making the spring

semester more like the cramped
fall semester.
"It will be good to have an extra week," said Prachi Patankar

'OO.
Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol
agreed, explaining that "Obviously, in my own self-interest, I'd
rather have more time for Honors exams."
Jennifer Pao 'Ol pointed out
that many students have course
and other seminar exams in addition to their Honors exams,
making the finals period even
more stressful.
Some faculty, however, argue
that having an extra week would
benefit their summer research.
Williamson said the current calendar keeps the Swarthmore faculty at school a week or two
longer than faculties at other
schools.
The proposed changes would
take effect after the 2000-01 academic year.
In addition to the exam period,
the discussion at Tuesday's meeting also touched on the issues of
moving the fall opening date,
changing the placement of the
October break, and switching
graduation from Monday to Sunday.

students.
Take Chela Delgado 'O3, for example.
Delgado, a California native, helped campaign against Proposition 209. Since its
passage, which she said was due just as
much to confusion over the use of the
phrase "civil rights" as to genuine antiaffirmative action sentiment, she has been
monitoring its effects. "The elimination of
affirmative action has had a devastating
effect on the UC system," she said. "Not
only have minority admissions gone down,
but minority applications have dwindled
as well."
Members of the Swarthmore Conservative Foundation and the College Republicans, who are co-sponsoring Connerly's
visit, are well aware of the controversy
that the speaker carries with him. Tony
Hillery 'Ol, a member ofboth groups, said
of Connerly, "He [has] had extreme forces
against him statewide and even nationwide. He's used to the pressure, I'm sure,
and that's why we thought he'd do well
here."
The selection of Connerly to serve as
SCF's first sponsored speaker (from a pool
of candidates that also included Oliver
North), however, was deliberate in more
ways than one. Hillery said SCF hoped that
by "bringing in an African-American to
speak about affirmative action in this
manner, the students will be more receptive than to someone who they could off
the bat see a picture of and write off because of his racial background."
In terms of gaining student acceptance,
Connerly already has enough going
against him as it is. At Swarthmore, at
least, he can be thankfulfor one thing: his
opponents plan to engage him in intelligent dialogue rather than ignore him in
protest.

Connerly's visit is partly funded by the
college through College Republicans but
also largely sponsored by the Young
America Foundation, a nonprofit "campus
outreach" organization. Swarthmore has
gained national media attention in thepast
for the involvement of outside conservative groups in its campus politics.

CBC passes higher wages
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Putting an end to more than
a semester of debate, the College Budget Committee decided this week to approve a
16percent student wageraise.
The center of the new wage
scale will shift from $6 to $7
over a two year period, explained Marvin Barron 'O2,
CBC representative from Student Council. Wages will increase by eight percent each
year.
Despite CBC's decision, the
wage raise is not yet definite
because it awaits the approval
of the Board of Managers.
Barron explained the role of
the CBC in the process. "We
just recommend it to the
Board of Managers and they
make a final decision," he said.
When asked, however, if he
thinks that the wage raise will
pass this final hurdle, Barron
responded that he is "fairly
certain."
The campaign to raise student wages was begun last semester by Matt Schwartz 'Ol,

former co-chair of Student
Council. In response, the CBC
formed a subcommittee responsible for undertaking an
extensive investigation of the
student wage situation. As a
basis for comparison, the subcommittee examined the student pay scales of a group of
other colleges and found that
“Swarthmore was below the
average level and we needed
to remedy it,” said Barron. A
similar comparative method
is used to determine faculty
and staff wages.
The 16 percent increase,
well overdue in the eyes of
many students and their employers, will make adjustments for inflation and bring
Swarthmore’s pay scale in line
with those of comparable colleges.

Black political experts discuss reform ideas
From FORUM, pg. 3
try?" one black student asked.
It was a reaction that would
be seen many more times over
the course of the night, as the
four panelists tackled issues
ranging from the census to education reform. By virtue of
Fulani's support of the Reform
Party, election reform became
a centerpiece of the forum, but
both Fattah and Clyburn managed to plug their own programs in education funding and
census reform.
Eventually, Fattah and
Clyburn responded to Fulani's
attack on party politics, but
Fulani had nothing but contempt for the Democratic congressmen.
"I'm not pretending Pat
Buchanan is Malcolm X," said
Fulani. "Not that it would matter; if I ran Malcolm on the Reform ticket, you wouldn't support him—you're a Democrat."
Fulani argued that by building a coalition between the extreme left and the extreme
right, the Reform Party could
capture the voters disenchanted by the centrist politics of the Republican and
Democrat presidential frontrunners.
Fulani's goal for the Reform
Party, she said, is to build "a
new partnership with the socalled 'angry white man.'"

to point what they saw as the ab-

surdity of the entire situation.
"I don't think that there are a
whole lot of black people who
are going to vote for Pat
Buchanan," said Fattah.
Clyburn also attacked Fulani
for her "unrealistic" view of
electoral politics, saying that
the current composition of the
Democratic Party
"AfricanAmericans, women, younger
Americans, the very rich and
the very poor" is the composition best suited for furthering
the welfare of the black com-

munity. Clyburn also called for
reforms in the electoral process, advocating the replacement of winner-take-all elections with representative elections.
Clyburn, Harrisonand Fattah
spent much of their allotted
time talking about the census
and their individual policy initiatives.
"I consider equal funding to
be the single most important
issue facing education today,"

Expensive swipe card
proposal no-go for now
By Marina Boevska
Phoenix Staff
A Housing Committee suggestion to use swipe cards to enter the
dorms has been rejected for now. The idea to replace keys with swipe
cards was first raised at a Housing Committee meeting last November in response to students' concerns about the difficulty of having
friends from other dorms visit.
The swipe card system is used on many university campuses, but
it will not be implemented at Swarthmore for now. The project has
been left at the "idea" stage and no concrete plan developed.
Larry Schall, vice president of facilities, explained, "The planning
for such a system would be complex and involve many, many people.
It is not an easy thing to do and would have to be done very carefully
to make sure it was done well and addressed all the various needs of
the many people involved."
Paul Arandia 'OO, the RA of Parrish 3rd West and a member of
housing committee, added thatthe swipe card system is very expensive and would involve switching every dorm door to the new system, installing new locks and hiring somebody to administer the system. This is both costly and time-consuming.
, When the concern about letting one's friends in the dorms was
first brought up, the Housing Committee proposed giving out universal dorm keys to people who request them. The idea was quickly
dropped because of the safety problems it would cause.
Safety concerns were again raised with respect to universal access cards. Since only students would have access to the swipe cards,
the Housing Committee felt that abuse would be minimal. People
who normally leave their rooms unlocked, however, might feel the
need to lock them if the cards were introduced, knowing that every
student could access their dorm.
The coinless laundry proposal was discussed in tandem with the
swipe card proposal since the cards could be used for several purPoses in addition to dorm access, such as meals, laundry and ID.
Both Myrt Westphal, director of residential life, and Larry Schall
confirmed that these projects have been dropped for now as being
too expensive and complicated. Schall expressed hope, however, that
m the future a plan might be developed" for easier access to the

dormitories.

Workforce Committee, Fattah
pioneered the GEAR UP program, a scholarship initiative
that has allotted $l2O million to
help disadvantaged middle
school students better prepare
for college.
"Just look at Swarthmore
here the school district spends
$14,000 per student," explained
Fattah. "In Philadelphia, they
spend $5,000 per student, and in
rural Pennsylvania, it's only
$3,800. Our government has an
obligation to provide students
with an equal education."
Clyburn and Harrison both
spoke about the upcoming census. Clyburn has made it a focus of his tenure as chairman
of the CongressionalBlack Caucus to insure that the 2000 Census is more accurate than the
last count.
"There was an eight million
undercount in the 1990 Census,"
said Clyburn. "The Bush administration knew it, and they decided not to correct it."
Harrison, a Harvard professor and a census expert at the
Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, estimated
that the undercount costs the
black community over $1 billion annually. He also highlighted the problems caused by
the racial classifications on the
census.
The forum was moderated by
political science professor
Keith Reeves.

Vandals cut
Willets power
By Mara Hvistendaht
Phoenix Staff
Vandals struck the basement
of Willets late Tuesday night,
damaging the telecommunications, outdoor lighting and heating systems and leaving a trail of
shampoo and broken porcelain in
the men's bathroom.
Between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.,
while most Willets residents
slept, a vandal entered the machine room and disconnected the
power to the dorm's vital systems, rendering the ethernet,
phone and heating services inactive. The vandal or vandals also
ravaged the men's bathroom by
dousing the mirror with shampoo, breaking a mug on the floor
and stealing an electric razor.
Since then, the damaged systems have been restored and the
bathroom has been cleaned. The
dorm residents' confidence in the
security ofWillets may take a bit
longer to restore.
On Wednesday, Public Safety
conducted an extensive investigation into the vandalism. Joon
Suk Choi 'O2, a resident of the
vandalized hall, said the officers
now "have an idea as to who
might have done it. They know
which direction to start looking."
RA Pat Murray 'Ol notified hall
residents of the suspect's identity
on Wednesday afternoon, but
they were unwilling to disclose
this information to The Phoenix
without his approval. Murray
was unavailable for comment.

Plate thefts solved? It depends on who you ask
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff

With Public Safety in the dark over
seemingly unconnected thefts, Delta Upsilon (DU) on the mend for a crime they
didn't commit and unconcerned about one
they did, and Tedd Goundie stuck in the
middle of it all, crime and punishment at
Swarthmore is becoming largely a matter of perspective.
No new license plates have been stolen
in the past few weeks and all plates stolen
this semester have been returned. As the
issue fades, with the rash of thefts apparently over, Public Safety's investigation is
still open but has few pertinent leads.
Though the case is still officially unsolved, Assistant Dean Tedd Goundiefeels
that theissue is close to a resolution. Based
on his discussions with DU president Paul
Willenberg 'OO, Goundie stated, "DU recognizes some of their members were involved in [the thefts]." Even though there
is no evidence of organizational involvement, Goundie expects DU to make
amends as an organization for the actions
of its members.
What remains unknown is exactly who
those guilty members are and exactly
what those amends should be. Goundie is
unsure whether others besides DU members were involved and is not actively pursuing names. Willenberg is even less sure;

he only said, "I heard that there could have
been DU guys involved." He added that
he doesn'tknow any names and "[doesn't]
want to."
Willenberg was more concerned about
DU's image on campus. "The perception
is that if two people who [are involved]
happen to be DU members, the campus
thinks DU as an organization is involved."
Despite Goundie's remarks, Willenberg
felt that DU has adequately distanced
themselves from the thefts. "I hope to be
moving beyond that," said Willenberg,
referring to DU's association with the
crime.
Willenberg's concerns, however, come
in the midst of an investigation into DU
regarding a different crime. This past
week, Public Safety confiscated a slew of
street signs from the fraternity house.
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, the bust was an unintended consequence ofroutine surveys of
the DU and Phi Psi houses.
However, Goundie admitted that Public Safety approached him before the inspection and requested a search of DU.
Public Safety received a tip that DU may
have been involved in recent video projector thefts, added Goundie. Public
Safety found no projectors, but they did
find the collection of street signs hanging
on the wall of a DU meeting room.
Both Goundie and Willenberg seem

largely unconcerned with the petty theft.
Willenberg emphasized that many of the
signs were hanging in the fraternity house
long before he came to Swarthmore, some
for perhaps as long as twenty years.When
DU members voluntarily took the signs
to the red barn next to theFacilities buildings, they added them to a pre-existing
pile of other street signs of unknown origin. Goundieis investigating the financial
repercussions of DU's stolen street signs
but expects little financial burden on the
fraternity.
If Goundie and DU have their way, the
denouement of the license plate story
could be remarkably similar. Last
semester's thefts notwithstanding,
Goundie sees little left to do. Few, if any,
students have contacted him about financial retribution. He stated that "because
of the number of people [involved] that
happened to be in DU, it's not a bad thing
to help DU set things right as an organization." Doing the right thing is, however,
a matter of perspective.
For Willenberg, apology is the obvious
first step. He spoke for DU when he said,
"We're sorry that the people have had
their license plates stolen." He added that
DU hopes to take a "proactive stance in
trying to help its image."
For Public Safety, though, the investigation is still officially open, and while
Goundieand Willenberg aren't personally

of the investigation into license plate thefts.
invested in finding the actual thieves, the
campus law enforcement organization is.
With the issue still very much up in the
air, Goundie felt that, "If we can't bring
this to closure, I think we may see
[Swarthmore Borough Police] get more
involved." And that, he intimated, could
change everyone's perspective.

College cancels Carolina trips over Confederate flag

competition, but trying to find a
willing school this late in the academic year is much more difficult.
"In tennis you're only allowed
to have 20 matches in the season," women's tennis co-captain
Michaela DeSoucey 'OO said yesterday, "and most schools already have their 20 matches

booked."

The women's lacrosse team is
in a similar situation. Coach
Karen Borbee said she had arranged for a trip to Colorado
Springs, Colo., but that she had
not arranged for a match yet.
"We just need to have the contest
to make it official," she said.
Track and field coach Luci
Rosalia said she had just signed
the contract for the South Carolina package last week. Yesterday, she was confirming a trip to
California, where the Claremont
Colleges have offered the use of
their facilities. She said the unexpected need for airplane tickets was also problematic, since
teams traveling to South Carolina
usually drive, but she was sure
that the trip would work out in
the end and the team would be
able to have a meaningful prac-

tice.
"I'm sure that we'll have a very

competitive spring break trip
and we'll be able to accomplish
all those goals," she said.
Men's golf coach Mark
Duzenski said that at the time the
college's decision was made he
had not yet made final arrangements for the team's usual trip
t° golf mecca Myrtle Beach. He
js now considering a trip to
ftnehurst, N.C. or Orlando, Fla.
Ouzenski and the women's softball coach, Mitch Kline, might
also join Swarthmore's track and
tield team in California.

Although the coaches have arranged for new trips and are sure
they will be able to schedule competitions as well, it has come at
the expense of backing out of
previous arrangements with
spring break trip operators as
well as other schools.
"I'm having to apologize to a lot
of people," said women's tennis
coach Dan Sears.

Additional cost
Because sports schedules are
usually arranged so far in advance usually in September or
Octoberfor the spring—Athletic
Director Bob Williams notedthat
the uncertainty of not having
competitions completely arranged yet is awkward.
But another problem with the
change is financial. "We have
quite a financial commitment in
deposits and registration fees,"
he said. That is college money,
Williams said, and students, who
usually have to pay $lOO or $125
of their own money plus providing their own meals on such a
trip, do not stand to lose down
payments on canceled plans.
But many of the teams, who
were planning to drive to South
Carolina, will now have to fly.
The airplane tickets are both
more expensive and harder to
come by now. Add to that therelative cost of flying compared to
driving in the first place, and the
trips may be significantly more
expensive than originally
planned.
"I know that we'll get some
support from the college," said
Williams. "How much, I'm not
sure at this point.
"My intention," he added, "is
not to increase the amount students have to put in."
Eldridge confirmed that the
college would defer the increased costs. Meanwhile, Will-

"Even though it's a
powerful statement from
the president of
Swarthmore College, it
could have been even
more powerful coming
from the Tri-college
presidents together."
Bob Williams
iams said he would investigate
reimbursements for the parts of
the canceled South Carolina trips
where a refund is still possible.

Making the decision
The Philadelphia-area participation in the boycott began at
Haverford College, where Athletic Director Greg Kannerstein
said women's tennis coach Ann
Roger initiated Haverford's
eventual reaction.
"Ann Roger came to see me
about the time of the big demonstration in South Carolina,"
Rannerstein said, referring to
the protest on January 17 when
46,000 marched to the state's
Capitoland demanded the flag be
removed. "She came to me and
said she was feeling uncomfortable about sending the team."
Rannerstein
met
with
Haverford's senior administrators, who decided to support
Roger's move on the grounds of
opposing the flag itself as a symbol as well as taking a stance to
support the NAACP boycott.
Haverford's tennis team will
travel to Orlando, Fla., instead at
a somewhat higher cost,
Rannerstein said. According to
Haverford's policy, the college
will absorb the cost of a longer
van trip. Some members of the

team, who choose to fly on their
own, will pay for their tickets
themselves.
Since Haverford's men's tennis
team has also practiced in
Florida, Kannerstein saidthe college initially did not think the
move was that important to publicize.
But Bryn Mawr College's tennis and lacrosse team's soon followed suit, as did the men's tennis team at Temple University.
Swarthmore administrators
heard about the boycott on Friday, and Eldridge said the senior
staff began discussing the issue.
The decision Swarthmore made
days laterwould affect six teams,
while at the other schools it inconvenienced a maximumof two.
At the senior staff meeting
Tuesday afternoon, Eldridge
said, administrators decided to
release the statement announcing Swarthmore's intention to
join the boycott.
Williams, who was notified before that meeting ended, said he
immediately confirmed the decision with the affected coaches,
who had known before that the
move was possible.
But while Williams, as well as
coaches and players, supported
the decision, they all said it
should have been made differently.
Williams criticized the Tri-College Consortium of Bryn Mawr,
Haverford and Swarthmore for
not making a joint decision on the
subject. "Even though it's a powerful statement from the president of Swarthmore College, it
could have been even more powerful coming from the Tri-college
presidents together," he said.
Coaches and players said they
wished they had been a part of
the process. "I'm sure the administration agonized over it too, but
[the decision was] made behind

closed doors," said Sears.
"They didn't leave us enough
time to reschedule," said
DeSoucey of the tennis team.
"They didn't contact the coaches
and they didn't contact the captains."

Supportive reaction
The coaches and players said
they supported the eventual decision, however.
"We do understand why
they're doing this," said one of
DeSoucey's fellow tennis co-captains, Jen Pao 'Ol.
Rosalia said her trackand field
runners agreed. "I think they
were supportive of the decision,"
she said, expressing optimism
that the decision would have an
effect.
"Hopefully, our stance on it
will bring attention to it," she
said.
Tim Sams, assistant dean and
director of the Black Cultural
Center, responded favorably
when informed of the decision.
"I like it," he said. "I think it also
teaches students the importance
of standing for something."
Sams said the decision was
consistent with Swarthmore's
values. "This is consistent with
what we say around here," he
said.
Sears pointed out that
Swarthmore's decision, while
enormously symbolic, would
have little economic effect without broader support. Administrators were unsure yesterday
whether any other colleges outside of the Philadelphia area
were participating in the training
boycott.
Despite the hassle of rearranging the trips, the decisiontouched
on an important issue, Sears said.
"I haven't heard anybody say, T
think it's fine for them to be flying the Confederate flag.'"

Southern discomfort
Swarthmore's decision to detour athletic training
trips around South Carolina is only a small reaction in
the midst of local and national tumult. While the
practical and financial repercussions of the boycott
will likely harm Swarthmore more than South Carolina, President Al Bloom has, for all practical purposes,
made a statement in line with the college's and students' beliefs.
There is no doubt that the administration's decision
was reactionary. At the national level, the NAACP has
called a boycott of South Carolina, hoping that the state
will be economically pressured into removing the
Confederate flag from the state Capitol. The boycott
began on the local college scene when the Haverford
women's tennis team decided to avoid South Carolina
this spring. Other teams followed suit, and on Friday
the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that team-by-team
decisions had augmented to school-wide boycotts at
Haverford and Bryn Mawr. The article conspicuously
mentioned Swarthmore's indecision. Four days later,
the college reacted with an austere press release.
The hasty decision is troubling for practical and
ideological reasons. The college has clearly caused a
pain in the neck for several sports teams, which must
now reschedule trips and hope to squeeze in matches
their new locales, as the NCAA requires teams to have
matches against other schools. Money has been lost in
the form of non-refundable deposits. And although the
college, not the athletic department, will pick up the
extra tab because many teams may now have to fly
instead of drive, the decision is clearly costing someone money.
The college, then, is clearly reacting on ideological
grounds. It is rare to see official decisions made on
such short notice, and we commend the administration
for making the correct decision in a matter of days.
However, the decision-making process was not without
injury.
It is apparent that few in administration knew that
any sports teams were even planning to travel to South
Carolina. The issue wasn't discussed until after the
Inquirer article appeared on Friday, and athletic
director Bob Williams, though kept appraised, was not
actively involved in the decision. The coaches were not
notified until after the decision was made, and the
news on campus came only after an official press
release by the Office of News and Informaton.
There is a tendency, especially at Swarthmore, to be
naturally suspicious of secretive, top-down decisions.
These suspicions are not unfounded, especially
because the move was so highly reactionary. While the
administration certainly did not have time to form a
committee to explore the issue, student or staff input
was only a phone call or an e-mail away. Its decision to
act without feedback shows not only a lack of concern
about feasibility but also a lapse in concern about the
practical well-being of those affected.
We should be happy that, despite the lack of input,
the administration made the correct decision. In a
move that was deeply political as well as ethical, the
college was able to strike a correct balance. If a
similar situation arose in the future, we have confidence in top campus officials to correctly represent
the college and students' beliefs. But in the future, we
hope they won't act alone.

Commendation
On the most sonorous corner of campus, several hundred students gathered Friday night in Lang Concert Hall
for a cacophonous and heated political debate. The Black
Political Issues Forum 2000 was a resounding success not
only because it drewbig names and gave the college positive publicity, but also because it truly engaged students
and presented an in-your-face view of the real world of
black politics today. The College Democrats and theBlack
Cultural Center deserve credit and applause for organizing such an intelligent, relevant and substantial event.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

'Sex games' shouldn't be sports focus
To the Editor:
The recent improvements to The Phoenix regarding content and presentation are both apparent and
appreciated. However, a big step hasbeen taken backwards in publishing the article entitled "Sex games:
Two ways to score" by Scott Kushner (Feb. 3, Back
Page). While we personally find the subject matter
offensive, our issuelies with the inappropriate placement of the article on the front page of the Sports
section. Students are free to write on the topic of
their choice, but it is the ultimate responsibility of

the editors to make decisions regarding publishing, and
more importantly, presentation. As educators of sport,
we are disappointed to see it given such a prominent
place. Quality stories concerning the student-athletes
and teams at Swarthmore are deserving of the space and
attention. If the article is, in your opinion, worth publishing, it is your responsibility to put it in the proper
place and to ensure that it does not detract from the accomplishments and commitment of the athletes here at
Swarthmore.

Religious politics create barriers
By Cathy Ta
For The Phoenix
I have always supported religion as an

institution for its practical and convenient

purposes, e.g. givingpeople guidance, helping people get through difficult times, etc.

If anything, I myself have strong faith.
However, a couple of days ago, I had an
odd online conversation through instant
messaging with one ofmy girlfriends from
high school. She revealed to me that there
were many random occasions during high
school when she would just thinkof me and
cry for me. I was surprised to hear this,
curious at least to find out why. At the same
time, I felt a deep appreciation for her for
having cared so much for me. But then she
typed in why. "I was and still am hurt to
see that you're going to he 11...."
Don't get me wrong. I love this friend
for loving me so much. On the one hand, I
really admire her for her devotion to a
single religion. Any person able to be so
passionate and committed to a faith, a religion, something without certainty, is beautiful. Not many people can do that without
empirical data or whatnot. Her trust in God
is truly inspiring. But on the other hand, I
cannot help but see the politics of this, the
side that turns me away from religion and
its labels. It creates needless barriers between believers and nonbelievers, contradictory to the whole point of religion. Religion should serve as an institution that
unites people, teaching people to accept,
relate, learn, and grow from one another,
regardless of what faith they believe in. But
because I did not and still do not share the
Christian faith with her, I received something along the lines of prejudice.
I must admit, this isn't something new.

Peculiarly enough, thereare three religions
in my extendedfamily. The majority of my
relatives, including my grandparents, are
Buddhists, while the "minority" of them
are either Baptist or Taoist. Until my Baptist uncle tried to convert another family
member this past December, this array of
religions wasn't a problem at reunionsand
family dinners. However, this past December, my grandfather (the head of the household in traditional Chinese families) "put
his foot down" and vowed to disown any
family members who were to convert to
Christianity under the efforts of my Baptist uncle (my Baptist uncle is a son-in-law
to my grandfather). I just thought the
whole thing was ridiculous.
It seems as if believers (not all, but
enough) Christians, Baptists, Buddhists,
Taoists, etc. become hypocrites in the
name of religion. Soon, everything revolves
around this one notion of not what's right

and wrong, but of who's right and wrong.
Does it really matter what religion a person is? It's almost as if religions in themselves are political parties. Does it really
matter if I'm a Christian in order to believe
in the same things as a declared Christian?
Or do I have to be a declared Buddhist in
order to believe in Buddhist principles? I
just don't get it. There are people who declare themselves to be Christians, butpractice none ofit. Will that person go to heaven
or hell? And if I officially do not bear the
name of being Christian, am I immoral and
satanicand will I end up in hell? The name
of being Christian does not necessarily
imply that heaven is locked in for a person. It's just a name. I highly doubt God
will be playing the name-game on judgment day. If God is what He's made out to
be, my opinion is that He's not as superficial as some humans are. The biggest sin
of all, I think, is to use religion in the name
of human stubbornness.
I am not disrespecting Christianity or
any religion for that matter. I honestly
applaud people and their faiths. Religion
serves a special purpose of enhancing a
person's life and spirituality. What I am
bothered by is the politics around religion.
That night, my girlfriend asked me, "How
do you know that you're right?" I plainly
answered, "I don't know if anything's
wrong." It's always about which religion
is "right" and which is "wrong." Any religion a person believes in is not "wrong"
or "right." That's not the point. The point
is the person benefits from just simply
believing. That night, I was not insulted
or offended by my girlfriend's comments.
Instead, I just resolved to see my friend
as someone caught in the middle of the
politics of religion.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ERes system superior to print version
To the Editor:
We read with great interest Nate
Stulman's recent piece in The Phoenix ("Efficient and optimal: an ode to Xerox," Jan.
27 Pg- 9). Eric Behrens' response (Letter
to the Editor, Feb. 3, pg. 11) was equally
engaging. We think that both articles identify and address facets of complex issues.
In his article, Nate is essentially cautioning against the indiscriminate use of technology for the delivery of course material.
While this point in and of itself merits significant consideration, Nate tries to make
his point by doing a cost-benefit analysis
that is not fully informed. Eric balances out
Nate's analysis of print versus digital delivery of material by providing a series of
excellent examples of the merits of digital
oyer analog. In addition, he effectively
highlights a critical element that Nate
missed: the role of copyright laws in costs
of the distribution of course material. Eric
also articulates thathe has a sense that user
satisfaction with digital readings is high
and that "the happiness of resource users
is a benefit." We agree.
For many professors, course readings
are an integral component to meeting
pedagogical objectives. Developing and
>

maintaining reliable, affordable, efficient,
tegal, and equitable access to materials
are challenges that successful colleges
must balance. There are basically four
models for distribution of supplementary

class readings:

1) the course pack wherein
a faculty member puts together a set of
materials and distributesthat "anthology"
to each member of the course; 2) the distribution ofindividualarticles throughout
the term to each enrolled student; 3) the
Placement of multiple copies of materials on reserve in the library; and 4) using

an electronic reserve system to store and
deliver individual readings.
Swarthmore College libraries have been
supporting the provision of access to
course readings through print reserve
services for years. Funding by the Andrew J. Mellon Foundation has provided
the libraries the opportunity to pilot an
electronic reserve project popularly
known as ERes at Swarthmore. Systems
like ERes have several advantages in allowing libraries to aggregate different
types of materials. For example, many
faculty have utilized "folders" to provide
access to problem sets and exams. ERes
has allowed us to provide students with
one entree point to materials which may
be stored in various places. Perhaps the
best example of this has been our ability
to link to articles available through data-

bases like JSTOR. For Econ 11, we were
able to locate 75 percent ofmaterials from
an out-of-print book through JSTOR. In
many instances we have found that articles that were routinely being photocopied by professors to be put in binders were
already available electronically through
a subscription. By streamlining the way
these materials are used, the library may
actually be cutting down on the printing
of unnecessary binder copies. The electronic reserves system provides opportunities for making contextual connections
in ways that were previously unavailable.
As Eric indicates in his letter, the response to the electronic reserve system
has been very positive. Centralizing access to resources, be they print, digital,
human, etc., via an electronic reserve system, is powerful. Check it out.

A few of
my favorite
things
I usually get some amount of commentary as a result of these columns, running
the gamut from "You're funny, heh, heh"
to "Please stop." My last, however, was a
bit unique, in that a) no one thought it was
funny, and b) at last count, seven people
got it. Cinematic satire is perhaps best
attempted on a movie of more obvious infamy and also by one more talented than
I. For that, I apologize. In my head, like
many other things, it just sounded really,

really good.
The problem, of course, with virulent
cynicism is that it risks mutation into dejected apathy, and Lord knows we have
enough of that. So, in a brutally-cruel maneuver (and yes, I know I'm the only one
who hyphenates adverb/adjective pairs
modifying nouns, but I don't care), I shall
attempt to illustrate just a few of the
things I have grown to, if not appreciate
(if I do not split infinitives, who will?), then
find a little comfort in (messy, messy English. Bad boy
why am I the only one
saying that to me?).
In recent millennia, I have been quite
hard on the Sharpies dining staff. I would
like to offer something to assuage their
pain: to wit, whoever picks the oldies station that they have on can be my new best
friend. In one day, standing in line, I heard
"Beast of Burden" by the Stones and Lee
Michaels' "Do You Know What I Mean." I
may not be the most soulful guy to come
out of Pittsburgh (that honor, of course,
going to Michael Keaton), but even my
leaden toes get a-tapping when I haven't
heard "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" in a
while.
Also: the fact that I no longer live on
Willets first. A great deal, if not the majority, ofmy general antipathy must have
come from the wonders of that devilish
circle. I even contemplated today revisiting my haunt, so that the ever-present
smell of vomit and the plethora of empty
plastic vodka bottles could once again stir
the darker recesses of my bosom, but I
declined. I much indeed prefer my cloistered cell overlooking the pretty, if often
inexorably-dull, courtyard of the Twins of
Concavity. I am sure that some have their
own, as Dennis Miller (another
Pittsburgher) once put it, RubeGoldbergianattachment to the place, and
perhaps I do, as well, in a masochistic way,
but on the whole, despite whatever social
advantages are to be lost in the institutional and meandering corridors of
Danawell, and I do not deny that they so
exist, I am very agreeable to the quiet here
found.
Quickly, as I run out of space, I would
also like to give a mention to brie. We're
not really a brie kind of family at home,
but I dislike the seminar break that fails
on that important fromagian matter.
So I hope that instead of sinister sneers
of shared misery, I impart today awry
smile. It can, and it shall be, much worse.

Politics as usual: Bill Bradley's fight
By Min Lee
For The Phoenix

e

'Three Kings'
silent on
today's Iraq
I was expecting a little too much when I
hoped that Hollywood had finally found
morality. When I went to see "Three
Kings," the first mainstreammovie about
the Gulf War, I felt more than a little disheartened.
Not that it wasn't an excellent portrayal
of the dark side of the 1991 war. It showed
the complex sentiments in Iraq, the maniacal behavior of U.S. troops, the suffering during the war itself, and the morbid
cynicism that characterized the first major war that our generation knew.
The criminal failure of "Three Kings"
was in its complete unwillingness to connect the horror of Iraq in 1991 with the
veryreal horror that stillexists there now,
a decade later.

A movie particularly painful
in its lack of perspective.
Most good filmsabout unjust war shake
us from complacency for those two or
three hours and give us a real sense of
righteous indignation mixed with awe of
the strength of humanity. We can come
away with a sense that, were we there,
we would have acted differently, but we
can learn from our mistakes and move
on.
We would have never allowed the genocide in Cambodia after we watched "The
Killing Fields" and we would have appreciated the vitality of the human spirit in
the face of senseless destruction after we
watched "The Deer Hunter" or "Apocalypse Now." However, we all recognize
that we can't do anything about the guilt
associated with these events.
This is exactly where the argument
breaks down, though. Do we ever consider
what happened to the landmines in southeast Asia? Do we question the United
States' refusal to sign the Ottawa Treaty,
which would ban anti-personnel
landmines?
"Three Kings" is particularly painful in
its lack of perspective. Thousands of Iraqis continue to die every month because
of malnutrition, disease and unsanitary
conditions. These deaths are the "acceptable consequence," as Madeline Albright
puts it, of the economic sanctions that
keep Saddam Hussein in power and the
country powerless.
Did the movie mention this at all? Were
there even two lines about the current
state of Iraq at the end, after we hear
about the American soldiers' lives? No,
and it's hardly a secret. We, the audience,
left feeling redeemed the good guys did
the right thing and the refugees got to
Iran.
But the real story doesn't end there,
back in 1991. The suffering goes on today,
and I only hope we can do something about
-

www.phoenix.swarthmore.edu

In the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary, withthe race for the Democratic presidential nomination locked in a
dead heat, former Senator Bill Bradley finally decided to take the plunge. First, in
his warm-up act, at an lowa debate, he challenged Vice President Al Gore to end racial profiling instantly by forcing his boss
to sign an executive order ending the practice. "I want you walk down that talk hallway, walk intohis [Clinton's] office and say,
'Sign this executive order today," Bradley
demandedforcefully, to an outburstof roaring applause. Before we knew it he was
tearing Gore's image of integrity apart.
But it was never an easy transition for
Bradley, who at the outset had so painstakingly fashioned himself as a candidate
who was above "politics as usual." Even
after deciding to go negative on Gore,
Bradley could never keep his underlying
and genuine disgust for the rules of the
game from bulging to the fore. In the final debate before the New Hampshire
election, and by far the most contentious
to date, he finally lost it.
Gore was on the offensive from the very
beginning, wasting no time in bringing up
Bradley's latest misstep. Obviously
slightly flustered, Bradley scrambled to
hold his ground, responding with a few
attacks of his own along the way. But at
one point it seemed as if he had plainly
given up. In a tone of resignation and almost disbelief, he told Gore, "You, out of
all people should know better than anyone else [not to practice politics as usual.]"
What is, after all, politics as usual? The
modern political campaign is won on the
battleground of popular perception. Nothing said during a campaign is a full-truth,
which is not to say that everything is all
lies either. But if you hammer away at a
message or an idea hard enough, the electorate just might internalize and believe
it. The fact that voters and the media don't
have a lot of patience or time doesn't help.
The goal of this kind of perceptual manipulation is to differentiate (read: polarize) candidates, more often than not, negatively. The final outcome, however, is a
selective, if not disingenuous portrayal of
the candidates' actual positions.
Take health care, for example. Gore
accused Bradley of jeopardizing the future of Medicare and Medicaid. Bradley
does call for the dismantling of Medicaid,
but replaces it with refundable tax credits with which the poor can purchase insurance on their own. As far as Medicare
is concerned, the statement is not entirely
true, nor is it a blatant lie. Bradley's plan
is simply more optimistic about the
economy and visionary. Universal coverage consumes most ofhis budget whereas
the solvency ofMedicare is not accounted
for. Gore's plan is more conservative and
costs less. It merely improvises on the
current system to gradually achieve universal coverage, with an eye to keeping
Medicare and Medicaid solvent as well.
This is precisely the campaign that Bradley wanted to avoid, which he did, until
Gore stepped up his offensive and made
major inroads on his position in the polls,
at whichpoint Bradley started getting his
hands dirty as well, if only reluctantly. At
first he was content with simply accusing
Gore of distorting his own and Bradley's
positions, trying to expose politics as
usual. But now he is treading on thin ice,
making claims about Gore that if not
distortive, are equally unprovable as those
the Vice President made about him and
his positions. Only six weeks ago Bradley
praised Gore for "learning from" the campaign finance scandal, citing the fact that
Attorney General JanetReno's investiga-

tion revealed no evidence of wrongdoing.
Now based on just one new Fortune article, he is arguing that Gore knowingly
committed campaign finance violations.
At the heart of this hesitant shift in tactics is the strong tension between
Bradley's desire to win and his genuine
desire to run a differentkind of campaign.
You can't change the system unless you
get into the system, which means playing
by its rules to a certain extent, something
that Bradley himself, as much as he detests it, fully recognizes. But the dilemma
is costing him votes, and will continue to
do so, until it is resolved.
For starters, the change in strategy
poses a painful hypocrisy for Bradley,
which Gore has already fully capitalized
on, most notably in the final debate in New
Hampshire. (Gore accused Bradley of setting a bar that he himself "could not comply with.")
Even if Bradley had to go negative, attacking the Vice President's integrity
seems like a bad choice. Despite the "no
legal controlling authority" fiasco, Gore's
image is still squeaky clean. A New York
Times article (Jan. 31) revealed that even
some staunch Bradley supporters did not
question Gore's integrity and were dismayed by their candidate's new tactic.
Running a positive campaign and limiting negative attacks to necessary responses that protect his existing position
also makes sense strategically. The
economy is doing well, so many of the issues featured prominently in this campaign are moot. In other words, most voters are not tied to their candidates based
on conviction, which is why the politics of
perception is so important. It is especially
crucial in a primary election between two
candidates who are, after all, not all that
different ideologically.
Not to mention the fact that the issues
thathave dominated the Democratic campaign are issues that are inherently hard
to reach conviction on. Continuing with the
health care example, it would take a Ph.D.
to figure out
maybe even a couple
whose plan is better. And your average
voter is simply not going to bother to sit
down and go through each plan line by
line. Thus the debate on health care has
been reduced to a "He Said, She Said" situation. This was most evident in the second Bradley-Gore debate in New Hampshire. Bradley accused Gore's plan ofleav-

ing people behind. "Who are you leaving
behind?" he asked Gore. "No one," the
Vice President retorted. "That's not true,"
Bradley replied back curtly.
This is also why simply crying foul play
doesn't work —Bradley can't prove within
the limited attention span of the media and
voters that Gore indeed distorted both
their records, even more so when the issues are so complicated. "Politics as
usual" is so dangerous and self-perpetuating precisely because it is so hard to
identify. You can't possibly attack "politics as usual" within the paradigm of "politics as usual."
Bradley can undo the perceptual hold
that Gore has over many Democratic voters, but not by going negative—what good
is trading one perceptual hold for another?
You don't want people to hate Gore; you
want them to love Bradley. And Bradley
can break Gore's perceptual hold and replace it with a permanent one by simply
projecting himself as he truly is, a man of
tremendous integrity, someone willing to
take on big issues that can't necessarily
be conceptualized simply in terms of
policy, like race relations.
But herein also lies Bradley's biggest
obstacle. Most of us who have studied
Bradley know that he is a genuine person,
but that's exactly the problem we studied him. We read his books, or went to his
Web site and canvassed through his
speeches. Which is why he is so popular
among intellectuals, and as recent exit
polls indicated, the young and well-educated. But he is not communicating effectively with the rest of the electorate. The
reason why? He has not tried to connect
with the people on an emotional level. We
know of his authenticity and passion, but
we don't see or feel it. His speeches tend
to be long and winding, more fitting for
the Senate than the campaign trail. As
Charles Pierce pointed out in his recent
profile of Bradley in Esquire, the former
senator simply keeps too much to himself
He is a fantastic listener, but he doesnt
show voters that he can "feel their pain,
and therefore they don't reciprocate with
feelings that breed conviction.
Bradley is no Clinton, but for those ot

Bradley has a dream too, but we just

Internet sales a sign to end sales tax
By Ben Schweigert
Phoenix Staff

Much of states' revenue comes in the
form of sales taxes. By taxing purchases
within their borders they are able to raise
money for schools, roads and other services which we all benefit from.
The Internet threatens this source of
revenue. Purchases on the Internet cross
state lines, meaning that individual states
are unable to collect taxes on them. With
the rapidly increasing amount of commerce taking place on the Internet, states
will either have to be allowed to tax purchases made on the Internet or to raise
other taxes to replace this revenue.
Allowing the Internet to go untaxed
whilemaintaining the sales tax on conventional commerce would make taxes dramatically more regressive. Only those
people with computers and Internet access would be able to take advantage of
the tax-free environment of cyberspace.
People without them would still be forced
to pay the normal sales tax, allowing the
wealthy to buy goods at lower prices and

only taxing the poor.
However, the answer is not to tax the
Internet. For one thing, who would collect
these taxes? The state of the purchaser?
The state of the merchant? The federal
government? Secondly, how would these

taxes be collected? A way could probably
be found, but it is unlikely to be simple.
The other major source of a state's revenue is the income tax, and any lost revenue could easily be replaced by an increase in it. The income tax is generally
recognized as a more egalitarian tax than
the sales tax anyway, since it avoids the
sales tax's tendency to target the less
wealthy. Those with less money spend a
greater proportion of their income and
invest less of it, meaning that they are hit
harder by taxes on spending. An income
tax, on the other hand, can be calibrated
to ask more from those with more ability
to pay. This would carry the further benefit of reducing prices, which would remove a disincentive to spending money.
The answer, therefore, is to accept the
fact that commerce can no longer be understood as taking place within state lines, and
to move away from the sales tax entirely.
Reducing these taxes across the board and
replacing themwith an income tax increase
would serve to make the tax code more effective, more fair and more relevant to the
modern, technology-dominated world.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Re-examine your cultural assumptions
To the Editor:
I'm writing in response to Hofan Chau's article "The alien at
Swat... might be human" (Opinions, Feb. 3, pg. 11) Having been
an "alien" most of my life, I understand a lot of the things she
the one
pointed out. But I'd like to focus on one paragraph
about "America [having] a monopoly on racism, classism... and
the rest of the -isms."
I actually think that a lot ofAmericans (especially elite Americans) see other countries (especially non-Western and non-industrial powers) as having more of these problems. And they
seem to think that it's because "they" are less "modernized/liberal," or apatheticpeople who just float withthe current of "conservative traditions." I'm sorry if I'm generalizing, but I do think
that people often overlook the context of the issue. As Hofan
said, people forget the "Why did the culture develop so?" part of
it. They forget how internalized and complex these issues are.
They fail to realize that for most people in the world "culture"
weighs very heavily inside them. Not seeing this, people easily
condemn "them" for being racist and for not fighting against
the racism in their culture.
I'm not saying that these "isms" should be ignored because
"it's part of their culture"; that's problematic as well.But it's so
easy to make value judgements without thinking ofother people's

So before making statements like "she's so
ignorant" or laughing at his insensitivity, it'd be nice
if you'd wait and examine the assumptions you are
working from."Aliens" have to do that all the time
because we're surrounded by foreign assumptions.

Yet, I also see the need for both "aliens" and "non-aliens" (in
the U.S. and in other countries) to be patient and consider the
particular contexts of the issue/problem. It's just so easy to take
it for granted that the world revolves around us, that our values
are the moral standards. We should learn to be humbled, to be
confused because our values have been turned upside down
to get out of our own personal bubbles.

There's more to comics than superheroes
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to the article on the state of comic
books that appeared in the Feb. 3 issue of The Phoenix ("Comic
books: final chapter of doom," pg. 12). The writer, Jesse Taylor,
brought up three points that he sees as being problematic to the
modern state of comics: lack of availability outside of specialty
shops, poor content, and collector mentality. While these are all
valid points, Taylor's solution for fixing the comics industry
leaves much to be desired.
He suggests that one should go to the nearest corner store
and pick up a copy of Superman, which, presumably, will leave
the reader wanting more. However, this will only create a demand for more of the same kind of mainstream comics that corner stores currently sell. If Taylor's plan is successful, it may
create a greater demand for the medium, but it would leave the
medium withthe same lack of variety it has right now: superheroes, superheroes, and more superheroes, with the occasional
issue of Archie thrown in for the tykes.
The real problem lies not in the method of distribution (after
all, video stores operate perfectly well under the same boutiquelike setup that comic stores do), but in the popular perception of
comics as a medium. Most of the American public thinks of
Batman, Superman, and the rest of their spandex-clad friends
when they think of comics, and while there is plenty of merit in
superhero comics, there exist many other genreswithin this medium: horror (Zombie World), crime fiction (Goldfish), autobiography (Peepshow), and kids' comics (Measles), to name a few.
These books rarely survive in the comics "scene" because it
caters primarily to superhero comics, and cannot gain recogni-

tion outside of said "scene" because people who don't follow
superhero exploits don't know that these other titles exist. The
best, most straightforward solution is to let people know these
books are out there, and while a better method of distribution
would be helpful, the most effective way to currently do so is by
critical reviews and word-of-mouth.
For its part, The Phoenix has done a wonderful job at this, by
including weekly reviews ofcomics in each issue's Living & Arts
section. However, what we truly need is a way in which people
can browse different comics, in order to find the titles that they
might enjoy. Haverford has a small room in their library dedicated exclusively to comic books, and there has been some talk
of Swarthmore setting aside a similar place in McCabe. If such
a room is created, Swarthmore students may be able to re-discover the joy of a well-writtenand -drawn comic book.
Until such a space is set up, however, one's best bet is to seek
out comics at the specialty shops where the majority of comics
are sold. There are two in reasonably close vicinity, at the King
of Prussia and Granite Run malls, many more within Philadelphia, and one just outside of Bryn Mawr. And for a more costeffective option, one can always ask one's comics-reading friends
to borrow whatever comics they own. I actively encourage my
friends to borrow and read my own comics, and so I am now
extending this invitation to the entire campus: you want comics? I'll give you comics. Borrow. Read. Enjoy. After all, a new
surge of interest in this historically under-appreciated medium
is, as Taylor wrote in his article, comic books' last chance.

Bill Bradley:
A Swattie's
candidate
Come November, I will be casting a ballot for Bill Bradley for President. Why?
Because Bradley is the Swattie's presidential candidate. Bradley's history, talents,
and personality embody the Swat culture.
First, he is an idealist. Most appropriately, he is an idealist inspired by the progressive politics of the civil rights movement. His extra-curricular activities included work with an Urban League reading program in Harlem that taught African American literature. Bradley even
had the nerve to teach the very literature
that he, himself, was reading for the first
time. Call it dumb. Call him smart. But
definitely call that a Swattie move.
However, while he comes from a progressive '6os legacy, like Swarthmore College, he has a more measured sense of
what "big" things government should and
should not do in today's political landscape. "We must remember we've done
the big things in the past. We can do the
big things in the future." His official Web
site (http://www.billbradley.com) also
notes that "Bill Bradley believes that government should do a few big things well."
Second, his liberal arts academic training has honed his scholarly and writing
skills. He was a Rhodes Scholar and
authored numerous books.
Third, our neck of the mid-Atlantic region has been Bradley's stomping
grounds. He lovingly represented New
Jersey, our friendly neighbor just across
the river, for three Senate terms. Like a
Swattie, he had a poor rookie year so he
sucked it up and worked even harder by
playing in a Philadelphia summer league.
Fourth, Bradley has exercised his job
skills in very Swattie ways. In recent
years, he even left the Senate to teach as
a professor
teaching being one of the
common Swattie professions. When he
was an NBA player, he explicitly reasoned
a policy for not accepting corporate endorsements because he was about the
sport and not the self-aggrandizement. For
the Harlem reading program he wrote a
brochure to get corporate funding and
analyzed capital-building strategies for
black, urban America. As is commonly
said, Swatties in the real world don't necessarily become the public figure in
policy, but they are the thinkers, advisors
and counselors shaping the ideas for the
policy. And this is the job capacity that
Bradley has always come back to throughout his career.
Especially given this last characteristic,
it is interesting that Bradley is a strong candidate for the highest executive office. Bradley may accomplish what most Swatties
can only fantasize about—which is to be true
to his humble, intelligent, and thoughtful
scholar-Swattie core but still have the publicly-appealing qualities that may actually
get him elected! It is this last bit of contradiction that brings the excitement to
Bradley's candidacy and his place as the
candidate that all Swatties should vote for.

Although they often work "behind-the-scenes,"
the contributions of Swarthmore staff enable the
college to function. This week's article is the
second in a two-part series that provides an in
depth look at key aspects of the staff experience.

'

than a year after a long range planning committee completed the first ever major study of staffing issues, many staff continue to have concerns
regarding wages, training and education, opportunities for adI vancement and staff influence in college governance.
Out of a workforce of more than 500 staff, fifteen were interviewed for this article, of whom all but two asked to remain
partly anonymous. The staff interviewed work in EnvironmentalServices, McCabe Library, Physical Plant, and various
administrative positions. Their top concerns were compensation, training and education. Many staff also felt that their
concerns are not always taken seriously enough by the college. These findings were consistent with the results of a 1998
*3taff Advisory Committee (SAC) survey completed by 37
pecent of the staffworkforce. Nevertheless, staff also emphasized the positive aspects of their work experience, such as
job security and a pleasant work environment.
This week's article
the second in a two-part series that
examines staffing issues at the college
discusses training
and educational opportunities, the grievance policy, human resources and the staff role in college governance. Last week's
article provided a historical perspective on staffing issues and
focused on staff wages.
�

•

Training and Education

Training

and educational opportunities ranked only
slightly behind wages as one of the top concerns
among staff, though the college has recently made
efforts to increase its support in these areas.
Several employees lamented the lack of training in many
staff departments at the college.
"People are looking for more in-house training," said one
itaff member, who reported that there is little ongoing training in his department.
The results of the SAC survey suggested that this dissatisfaction was widespread. Fifty-seven percent of respondents
"strongly disagreed" and an additional 21 percent "disagreed"
hat the college offered sufficient opportunities for training
wid professional development that could directly benefit job
performance,
The 1998 Accreditation Self-Study prepared by the LongRange Planning Committee Sub-Group on Staffing Issues
[PSG) for the Middle States Evaluation Team pointed to a basic lack of training for all staff at the college, especially in the
wea of technology. "Progressive organizations in 1998 comnit 2 percent to 4 percent of their staff salary budget to trainng and professional development, significantly more than
what the college currently allocates," said the study.
The study also reported that, unlike similar departments at
nany other organizations, Swarthmore's Human Resources
HR) Department does not have an established staff training
unction. It went on to suggest that Swarthmore "dramatically
inhance" training for staff at all levels and in all areas of the
:ollege.
In addition to training, a few employees were disgruntled
jy inadequate support for continuing education in areas both
lirectly and indirectly related to their jobs. Just over half the
'espondents to the SAC survey shared this view.
"There should be 100 percent reimbursement for employes furthering knowledge that will help them in their positions,"
jaid one employee. "If we are the number one college, we need
he number one staff."
The college's mission as an institution of learning suggests
"at it should support general education for all members of its
immunity, argued another staff member.
The self-study, which noted that the college offered "normal support for undergraduate education and no support for
raduate studies, recommended that the college bolster its
|u Pport for educational opportunities ranging from basic litiracy skills and GED classes to graduate work.

us fall for staff professional development and educational
ork including graduate studies.
Although psychology professor Barry Schwartz acknowledged the "inadequate opportunities for training and profeslonal development," he felt that this problem reflects
»

Swarthmore's lack of "verticality" in its staff structure, which
permits "very little room for advancement."
"While we can certainly provide opportunities for, say, administrative assistants to acquire new skills, they will still
pretty much be stuck being administrative assistants," explained Schwartz. "This might prove to be quite frustrating,
as people become more and more overqualified for the work
they do."
Indeed, the SAC survey showed that 64 percent of respondents did not believe they were "likely" to advance within their
work unit, as compared to 12 percent who did. The remaining
24 percent had "no real opinion" or did not feel that the issue
applied to them.
The self-study also mentioned the limited promotional opportunities available in many staffing areas, attributing this
situation to the "flat, decentralized, and specialized nature of
work" at Swarthmore.
While the dearth of advancement possibilities may be inherent in Swarthmore's employment structure, it also places the
college in a difficult position. "Does the college want t0... prepare [employees] for advancement, even if this means sending them off to another employer?" asked the self-study.
But when higher-level jobs do become available in their area
of employment, some staff members complained that the college tends to hire an outside person to fill the position rather
than train a current employee.
"Their solution to everything is to put in a new face, [even
when] there's a good employee who needs to advance but can't
because there's no means for training," said one staffmember.
For those who are promoted to managerial positions, the
college provides little or no supervisory training, according
to many of the staff and faculty interviewed.
Professor and Chair of the Department of Physics & Astronomy Peter Collings, who oversees several employees, believes that the managerial staff "varies tremendously" in terms
of the instruction, support and feedback they provide to those
under their supervision. "In the end, employees with different supervisors are often given different instructions and so
conduct their work according to differentrules," said Collings,
who also emphasized that Swarthmore is not a business organization and that its supervisors generally are not professional
administrators.
But, he added, placing great stress on his first word, "1f...
sound policies can be developed that everyone can understand
and follow, it might lessen the unevenness."
The self-study confirmed the current lack of training for supervisors, noting "that many campus managers have been promoted into their positions without any supervisory training."
Despite these problems, several employees mentioned the
ways in which the college has supported their educational endeavors.
Yvette Johnson, who works in Dining Services, was pleased
that for the past two years she has been able to arrange her
work schedule in order to take classes at the college.
Another employee commended the college for giving her
several paid hours every week to participate in Learning for
Life, a program in which Swarthmore students tutor staff in
literacy and computer skills.
The college will continue to take steps to augment stafftraining and educational opportunities in the near future, according
to Vice President of Finance and Planning Paul Aslanian.
Aslanian hopes to create a new position in Human Resources
that will handle staff training and development. Moreover, the
current $2OO million capital campaign includes a $5 million fund
earmarked for staff educational and training opportunities.

The Grievance Policy

The

grievance policy is one area in which Swarthmore
has made significant progress, according to most of
the staff and faculty interviewed.
The college is currently in the final stages of implementing
a substantially revised grievance policy intended to be more
responsive to staff needs. Steve O'Connell, chair of the Equal
Opportunity (EO) Committee, and Bradshaw, the newly hired
EO officer, explained that this policy differs from the existing
one in that it contains specific and clear procedures for handling nondiscrimination type grievances. Moreover, therevised

policy no longer places the onus on grievants to try to
work out problems with their offenders.
"I think this is a really positive step forward for
staff," said O'Connell, who added that the true test of
the policy's merit will occur once it is implemented.
"[We need to see if staff find it] usable, protective of
their interests, and reasonably effective, and whether
supervisors and others think it's constructive. [But] I
think it has a very good chance."
The revisions started in 1998, when former Director
of Human Resources Barbara Carroll began collaborating with a sub-committee of senior staff to develop
an improved version of the grievancepolicy published
in the staffhandbook. In what O'Connelltermed a "very
open" process, Carroll presented drafts of the revised
policy to the EOC, SAC and the Administrative Advisory Committee (AAC) in late 1998 and again in early
1999. Carroll used the feedback from these committees to rewrite each draft. The final grievance policy,
which should be formally
promulgated laterthis semester, currently awaits

fice to include handling
complaints that do not involve discrimination issues. For the first time, staff
may choose whether to take such complaints to the
EO officer or to the Employee Relations officer, who
traditionally addressed non-EO grievances. While emphasizing the "collaborative" relationship between the
two positions, O'Connell suggested that some staff
may feel more comfortable discussing their concerns
with the EO officer, whose position is distinct from
Human Resources.
"The Equal Opportunity Office creates a safe space
that didn't exist before for staff to explore other [nonEO] grievances," said O'Connell.
Bradshaw, who serves half-time as the EO officer
and half-time as a recruitment officer, explained that
her other major goal involves collaborating with Human Resources to diversify the staff workforce. The
self-study reported that African-Americans have more
representation in lower and higher staff positions and
comparatively less representation in mid-level positions, while other minorities tend to be under-represented at all levels of staff employment
Despite being on the job for only several months,
Bradshaw reported that "a lot of people are using the
[EO] Office so far." Staff members stop by to discuss
specific problems or simply to find out about services
offered through her office.
"I don't turn anyone away," said Bradshaw. "All staff
concerns are relevant."

Human Resources: Looking for Leadership

The

lack of a HR Director has slowed the effort to address many staff concerns. The top
position in HR has been vacant since last
March, when Barbara Carroll resigned after less than
three years on the job. A search committee has interviewed its final candidates for the position, and the
college is now "within days" of hiring a new HR director, said Aslanian.

14 | the phoenix | living | February 10,2000
Like other staffing issues at Swarthmore, Human
Resources has received a stronger commitmentfrom
the college only in recent years. The self-study re
ported that "the college has had, as part of its culture
a default position that dollars not spent directly on
students or faculty are dollars not well spent. Human
Resources is a good example of this 'neglect'."
Human Resource's function was limited to payrol
until the mid-19705, when the college hired a person
nel assistant to the associate controller, according to
the self-study andLee Robinson, associate director o
employee relations. The first personnel director of Hu
man Resources was hired in 1978. Since then, the de
partment has grown to encompass a variety of func
tions, including staff recruitment, wages and benefits
employee relations and payroll.
Without a director for nearly a year, the current HR
department has been compelled to set aside virtually
all major projects, according to Aslanian andRobinson
Aslanian commended the HR staff, who have taken on
considerable extra work, "for their incredible effort to
keep the good ship Human Resources afloat." The
larger college community has generally been "pretty
understanding," added Aslanian.
Nevertheless, several of the staff and faculty inter
viewed acknowledged that the situation is far from
ideal.
"[Not having a director] has definitely thrown a
monkey wrench into [staff-related projects]," said one
staff member.
Economics professor Larry Westphal feared tha
Carroll's departure could complicate the effort to
implement the PSG recommendations. According to
Westphal, who also served on the PSG, Carroll wa

committee members whose job involved translatini

larger pattern of
turnover that has
plagued Human Resources in the past decade. Her
predecessor, who was hired in 1992, left three years
later.
"The personnel situation hasn't stabilized," said
Westphal. "We need someone committed to the co!
lege who can function for a long period within the co!
lege environment."
To combat this turnover and to ensure a highly-quali
fied applicant pool, Swarthmore has invested fund
to upgrade the HR Director to Associate Vice Presi
dent of Human Resources, according to Aslanian. "The
staff area is large enough to justify the effort to at
tract the very best candidate," he said.
But Westphal felt that it has taken longer than i
should to find this candidate. "In the context of all
that went on in the PSG, one might say that it's been
very disappointing how long it's taken to move towar
the replacement of Barbara Carroll," said Westphal
who was careful to acknowledge various mitigating
factors involved.
Aslanian and Robinson did not agree that the re
placement process has taken unduly long. The colleg
took the unusual step of hiring a search firm to accel
erate the search for a new director, said Aslanian, wh
explained that typical searches usually last abou
seven months.
The college's HR search committee, which include
significant staff representation, narrowed its choic
of candidates to two finalists prior to winter break
The committee delayed having the candidates com
to campus until after the break so they could experi
ence the college while it was in session.
"We want the community to support this position,
said Aslanian.

Staff Governance

The

role of staff in college decision-making i
likely to be one of the issues thatthe new HR
director will address. Many of the staff in
terviewed felt that their views do not receive as muc
consideration as they would like.
Kae Kalwaic, an administrative assistant in the edu
cation department, said staff are not given fair repre
sentation on relevant committees. A strong proponen
of consensus, Kalwaic described Swarthmore's gov

wvvw.phoenix.swarthmore.edu
ernance as a "top-down" system in which decisions tend to be
handed down from the upper levels.
Kalwaic supports more staff representation on all committees, not just those dealing directly with staffing issues. "Staff
would offer a fresh perspective," she said. "Every decision
made affects everybody else."
Aslanian and Robinson pointed out that staff serve on eight
committees, three of which wield the most economic power of
all committees on campus: the College Budget Committee, the
College Planning Committee and the Faculty and Staff Benefits Committee.
Moreover, SAC and AAC, which are elected committees of
staff, have become increasingly strong voices for their constituents, said Aslanian.
Formed in 1998, SAC states its mission "is to represent staff
concerns to the administration, to serve as a liaison between
the staff and senior administration, and to advocate on behalf
of the Swarthmore staff." SAC, which meets regularly with
members of senior staff, has worked on a variety of staffing
issues, including tuition reimbursement, compensation and
"improving overall communications on campus."
Schwartz felt that staff are "well-represented" on committees that deal with issues pertaining to them. "If there is a
perception among staff of inadequate representation, it may
be because there are inadequate channels of communication
among staff."
Indeed, one employee characterized the communication
between staff members in lower-level positions and middle
management as "very poor." Meetings tend to be held only
when something goes wrong, said the employee, which prevents staff members from giving regular feedback that would
affect decision making.
While acknowledging that the college is currently trying to
increase communication among staff, Schwartz emphasized
that it is not "an easy problem." For instance, the college cannot schedule meetings during the paid workday that all staff
are free to attend.
One employee believes, however, that staff can counteract
the communication problem by making sure their voices are
heard. "It's up to staff to convey their concerns and opinions
to middle management in the hope that these concerns and
opinions will move up [to senior staff]."
"We have to realize that our main concern as staff... is to
provide a service to students and faculty," he added. "Understanding [that] will make it easier for staff to communicate
their needs and wants to management."
Several of those interviewed wondered whether the views
of staff serving on committees were sufficiently valued during the decision-making process.
"They try to keep staff on committees... [but] I'm not sure if
staff participation on them is weighted as much as we would
like," said one employee who has served on a college committee. She and Meredith Hegg 'OO, coordinator of the Student
Labor Action GrOup (SLAG), observed that staff are not always appointed to committees in a timely manner.
Although Schwartz said "there is no question that staff are
not 'equal' in importance to faculty and students in the eyes of
the institution," he felt that staff concerns are "taken seriously"
in the context of committee discussions. As a former associate provost who served on various committees involving staff
issues, Schwartz maintained that "[the staff] perspective on
things is always considered when decisions are made."
Nevertheless, Schwartz acknowledged that the heterogenous
nature of the staff workforce complicates the effort to address
the concerns of all staff members. "Sometimes, policy that is
perceived as not being responsive to staff concerns may actually be policy that is responsive to the concerns of one segment of the staff but not others," he said.
Still, the general consensus among the staff interviewed was
that their concerns are not always given fair consideration
compared to faculty and student concerns.
"If you have concerns, you can go to anyone," said one staff
member. "... But will your concerns be [treated] with equal
importance as student or faculty concerns? The answer is, 'No.'"
The staff workforce seemed to share this viewpoint. Sixtysix percent of respondents to the SAC survey felt that staff
concerns did not receive sufficient attention relative to faculty concerns. A slightly smaller percentage felt the same way
when staff concerns were compared to student concerns.
Thompson Bradley, professor and chair of the modern languages department, agreed that issues important to staff do
not consistently receive the priority they deserve. "Faculty
needs and wants
and student needs and wants
have always been first. Staff needs and wants havebeen last," asserted
Thompson. "... [Consequently,] staff feel neglected at best."
Many of the staff interviewed cited examples of this perceived neglect.
"At face value they try to make you feel appreciated, but in
reality they could do a better job," said one staff member. "In
general, there's a feeling that some of management [tacitly
implies] that if you don't like it here, you can go somewhere
else, that we're easily replaceable."
According to President Al Bloom, however, "if that perception exists, it's a misperception. The college deeply values its
staff and the essential contribution each makes to

Swarthmore's educational mission. It consistently
strives to assure that each member of the staff is
treated fairly and with respect, feels ownership in the
community, and derives satisfaction from his or her
work here."
Aslanian agreed withBloom's assessment. "A flourishing, successful college has at its core faculty and
students," said Aslanian. But he also felt that staff are
crucial to its success. "What would happen if there
were no one to run the
heating plant?" asked
Aslanian, who went on

"This [process] must be done in style," said Aslanian.
"Consensus... means that nothing gets done real fast.

Aslanian believes that these efforts, as well as those
Swarthmore has made in areas such as wages, the
grievance policy and Human Resources, showthat the
college appreciates its staff. "It's pretty clear that
Swarthmore looks at the relationship between the college and its staff as much more than an arms-length
economic relationship," he said.
One staff member would hope this is the case.
"Staff... do perform excellently and like to be treated
as full members of the college community," she said.
But despite expressing concerns in several areas, the
majority of staff interviewed were quick to point out
the positive aspects of their work experience at
Swarthmore. Several cited the college's "laid back"
work environment, which compares favorably to what
they encountered in private industry jobs. Another staff
member emphasized that his department provides him
with all the tools necessary to do his job effectively.
Many stated that their immediate supervisors are not
only considerate but also "like family." Still others appreciated the generous benefits and relatively high
degree of job security offered by the college.
The SAC survey also indicated that a large majority of respondents were satisfied with their supervisors, felt that their work environment was "safe" and
thought their benefits were "basically good."
"Some of thepeople who complain the most havebeen

But, he added, "there are a few things to be done to
make things better."

Reinventing
image
her
Dar Williams
grows closer
to rock
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Those who view Dar Williams as a
folk musician, including the singersongwriter herself, may have to think
again. With her latest album, "End of
the Summer," released in 1997, she
rocks out, kicking her music into the
higher gear concert-goers should expect in her performance this Friday.
Earlier in her career, Williams was
strongly influenced by the folk music
of the 19605, shown by the traditional
acoustic and vocal approach of her first
two albums, "The Honesty Room"
(1995) and "Mortal City" (1996). A fervent admirer of singers such as Joni
Mitchell and Joan Baez, Williams is
redefining the folk genre they helped
to create. She feels that she has more
freedom than her '6os counterparts,
however, because she does not have to
craft her songs as part of the feminist
movement.

"You don't have to go out and beat
your drum and say: 'This is why women
should be equal,'" she said in a
Tarentum Valley News Dispatch interview. "You can write from the perspective that you are equal, and you can
write about anything you want. I can
write about anything without feeling
like I'm hurting some movement."

'Scream' trilogy a new, postmodern horror genre
Wait. Check that: "Scream" wasn't
just a revision of the slasher film; by
bombarding the genre with heavy doses
of postmodernism, it resulted in a whole
new strain, a mutation. Now, "Scream"
was 1996's sleeper hit and did real well
by all those involved, but it did best in
the hibernating horror industry and for
a while on the multiplex screens. If you
were a good looking kid-actor with a
great head of hair, it was standing room
only to get your ass killed.
This mutant crop
the neo-slashercomedy, the self-deconstructing scare
soon had its own set of cliches: the
requisite geek speech about the rules
of horror films was substituted for the
staple shower scene. The "Friday the
13th"and "Halloween" movies were just
about bodies fucking, killing and getting
killed; "Scream" was as much about
mouths that ran a mile a minute, mouths
that wouldn't shut up, mouths that spoke
as often as they screamed. We're talking about the monstrous love children
of "Seinfeld" and "Psycho."
A couple of months after the release
of the first film, rumors started getting
around that "Scream" was planned out
as a trilogy, the "Star Wars" of horror.

Then sequels began to come out with an
alarming alacrity that bespoke a studio looking to capitalize on a trend and not a couple
of artists or visionaries in Craven and
Williamson looking to stretch out and expand. "Scream 2" kind of stumbled, taking
as the focus of its critique something way
more diffuse and slippery: sequels. It was a
noble experiment, wanting to parody the
tendency in sequels to make it bigger and
better but fumbled in its struggle to top the
original.
"Scream 3" came out Friday. Since the
success of its predecessors, audiences have
made big hits out of "The Blair Witch
Project" and "The Sixth Sense," horror films
way pared down of irony and, in their microscopic concern over the helplessness and
anxiety of their victims, were marked by a
sort of melancholy slowness. A friend also
pointed out that when "Scream" came out,
the last movie anybody had seen starring
teenagers was "Clueless." But "Scream 3"
is just another teen movie in a long line of
teen movies; we go to the theaters like a team
heading out onto the field in the middle of a
losing season, like it's our jobs.
So, faced with the changed tastes of moviegoers, this third film's a bit of a weird bird.
The plot has the survivors from the first two

"Screams" being drawn back into danger
by a rash ofkillings on the set of "Stab 3."
A reviewer in Salon.com notedthat it was
awful hard to tell whether "Scream 3" was
intended as "a scathing horror parody, a
loving horror homage, a Hollywood satire with a few slashings thrown in or a
high-minded critique on the evils of making movies." Whichever it is, the film is
ambitious in its scope and respectfully affectionate towards its characters but it's
neither particularly funny nor particularly scary.
This is a film that carries a lot of baggage; literally, it has ghosts rising from
their graves to prove it. Courtney Cox and
Parker Posey, who plays an actress playing the part of Gail Weathers, make for a
bizarro comedy team; they have the combative whiny power dynamic of a ventriloquist and her dummy Bickering over what
the 'real' Gail would do, the two actresses
only serve to remind us of how fun and
furious the first go-round was.
At its best, "Scream 3" could be said to
have a certain pathos; at its worst, it just
has an overworked, overcooked inevitability, and in the moments of exposition
between murders the look on everyone's
faces reads, "What? This again?"

Valentine's Day: a week of taboo-shattering theater
'The Vagina Monologues' a
fresh look at female sexuality
By Catherine Osborne

Phoenix Staff
The New York Times called it "a bona
fide phenomenon." For Variety it's "a
work of art and a piece of cultural history." But for one Swarthmore student
it's much simpler:
Anna Woodiwiss is worried about vaginas.
The sophomore's production of Eve
Ensler's (in)famous one-woman show
"The Vagina Monologues" will play in
Olde Club this weekend as part of a
country-wide initiative for Valentine's
Day. Woodiwiss saw the show in New
York this fall and immediately began
planning for Swarthmore's own V-Day
2000 celebration.

"There's a lot of anti-vagina
mythology out there that needs
to be dispelled before women
can feel really comfortable with
their bodies."
Cathy Muller
"Not only does the show break down
taboos about women's bodies and their
vaginas," says Woodiwiss, "but it does so
in a refreshing, affirming way. The play's
appeal is really universal it celebrates
women without denigrating men at all."
The monologues, based on Ensler's interviews with dozens of women of all ages,
colors, sizes, and sexualities, speak out
boldly on topics most people consider to
be, at the least, impolite. They are smelly,
hairy, sexy, earthy, and deeply powerful,
just as Ensler believes the vagina is.
The show has proved so popular that it
now
its
own
website
has
(www.vaginamonologues.com) and is currently being performed on Broadway by
a rotating cast which includes Kathy
Najimy, Alanis Morissette, Ricki Lake, and
Winona Ryder.
Ensler herself moved on to other
projects on Jan. 1, but before she left she
gave a workshop for college students (including Woodiwiss) whichprepared them
to return to their own campuses and

spread the good news about the vagina.
With funding from the Feminist Majority and Drama Board in hand (Ensler has
waived the royalty fees for Valentine's
Weekend performances) Woodiwiss began
the casting process in December. Seventeen women have worked on the show as
technicians and actresses. They come
from varied backgrounds: Jamie Rowen
'O3 had considered producing the show
herself; Morghan Holt 'O3 had never even
heard of Ensler. The common thread
which strings them together is silence and
its breaking.
Danielle Masor 'O3 auditioned because
"I couldn't even say the word; I knew
something was wrong."
The word "taboo" comes up frequently
in conversations with the show's actresses.

"In general, I don't believe in taboo subjects I think that idea is kind of ridiculous," Cathy Muller 'OO writes. "I think it's
important that women recognize their
vaginas as a beautiful and integral part of
themselves, not as some smelly thing that
they have to keep in secret. There's a lot
of anti-vagina mythology out there that
needs to be dispelled before women can
feel really comfortable with their bodies."
The actresses seem to delight in the
community-building they feel has taken
place over the last few weeks.
"I always leave with new respect for my
body," says Rowen.
Woodiwiss delights in the fact that
"we've been able to create 'the community of vaginas' that Eve Ensler talks about
one in
in her introduction to the work
which everyone is celebrated, strengthened and encouraged."
For the most part the campus is supportive of them, despite some troubling comments in the always-provocative Cornell
women's bathroom
most notably the
anonymous "I thought we went to
Swarthmore, not Smith."
"I was furious when I heard about that,"
says Melanie Hirsch 'O2. "It implies that
feminism and women have no place at
Swarthmore. This show is about women,
not feminism."
Swarthmore's production of "The Vagina Monologues" aims to educate and
emotionally connect with both sexes on
campus. Rowen hopes that both "men and

'Jodie's Body' reflects on stereotypes, both personal and political
By Deirdre Conner
Phoenix Staff
In this showbiz world of implants, sound bytes and intolerant critics, imagine a show that
features a large naked woman
and a discussion of the apartheid
in South Africa. Now imagine
that show got rave reviews from
such critics as The New York
Times and The Village Voice, and
you've got "Jodie's Body," the
one-act to be performed in LPAC
next week.
Aviva Jane Carlin, who wrote
and acts in the play, is a white
South African who is posing for
a life drawing class in England.
Through this setting, Carlin proceeds through a variety of monologues, both funny and sad, per-

sonal and political, touching and
exhilarating. They range from
her observations of the artists
painting her to her reminiscences of a childhood spent in
apartheid South Africa.
Though produced in part by
Gloria Steinem, this one-woman
play bucks all traditions (including the feminist ones). The notion that for one to be naked in
public one must have model-perfect looks is shattered, as is the
notion that serious politics and
light fat-girl humor don't mix.
Brought to campus by the
Dean's Office, Worth Health
Center, the President's Office
and Psychological Services for
Eating Disorders Week, "Jodie's
Body" was perceived by its organizers as a performance that

would appeal to a broad audience,
not just a select group interested

in traditional eating disorder is-

"We thought something that
wasn't about anorexia would be
good," Linda Echols, director of
the Worth Health Center, said.

Carlin goes beyond the norms to
comment on predjudice of all
kinds and the world's ability to

change.

Muddled 'Eye of the Beholder' doesn't thrill
Despite appropriately seductive performance by Judd,
movie plagued by sub-par supporting cast, aimless plot
By Morghan Holt

MOVIE REVIEW

Exiting the theater, I'm engrossed in thought, contemplating my weekly movie. My pondering is interrupted by loud
complaints on either side of me.
To my right, a man asks his wife
why the hellhe wasted his money
to see that piece of shit. Obviously embarrassed, she tries to

continues his tiradeuntil he’s out
the door. On my left, another
man gripes that he didn’t understand the point, that the movie
confused him from its onset.
Ordinarily, I’d have shrugged
such statements off, attributing
them to these men’s personal
opinions of the film. However,
such statements would also have
ordinarily been accompanied by
others’ positive commentary. No
one around these outraged guys
protested. In fact, they nodded
in agreement. The audience, it

seemed, was downright displeased with the elusive nature
of the new Stephen Elliot flick.
Personally, I'd have to agree
with the tetchy men. "Eye of the
Beholder" didn't exactly thrill
me. I found it more thick than
thrilling, more pedantic than profound. For the life of me, after
Marple
the
overhearing
audience's responses and formulating my own opinion about the
show, I can't understand how this
movie topped the box office.
Perhaps it was the premise.
After all, a thriller starring
Ashley Judd as a seductive serial
killer has definite potential, and
Marc Behm's 1980 novel, on
which the movie is based, received much acclaim as a national best-seller. It's understandable, then, why viewers
would be drawn to the promise
of this film. Yet I wonder about
the percentage of people who
left the movie fulfilled compared
to those who felt that they'd been
gypped.
"Eye of the Beholder" begins
by semi-introducing its protagonist, who is never actually
named. We know him only under his British Intelligence alias,

The Eye. Played
dourly by Ewan
McGregor, The
Eye's current
mission is to nab
his boss's son's
girlfriend, who is
using the son to
embezzle money
from his moneybags father. Hiding out in the
bushes, a sort of
high-tech voyeur,
McGregor watches in horror as
the amazing woman stabs her
boyfriend to death and dumps his
body in the river. His first instinct, naturally, is to apprehend
the murderess. But something
stops him: it's his daughter, or,
rather, the apparition of his
daughter. Her floating body
haunts his daily routine, monopolizing his thoughts, and, apparently, also determines his actions.
Later we learn, though the reason is left unexplained, that The
Eye's wife, tired of trying and
failing to pry him away from his
world of computers and cop
games, left him, taking his
daughter, to whom he seems to
feel a surprisingly close connection. Either The Eye sees a resemblance in the killer, named
Joanna Eris (though, a mistress

of disguise, she flips through a
variety of pseudonyms) and his
daughter, or he's simply attracted to her and can't bring
himself to turn her in. Whatever
the case, he becomes obsessed
with her, following her in a frighteningly stalker-esque manner,
any prospect of her capture completely forgotten, even as he
watches her kill, marry, and kill
again.
If done correctly, "Eye of the
Beholder" could have proven a
worthwhile cinematic venture.
Judd certainly holds up her end,
playing her sinister temptress to
the max, mixing in the slightest
psychological twist to provide an
ultimatefemale foe. McGregor's
performance just missed the
mark, and the other castings (k.d.
lang as his computerized back-up

and Jason Priestley as Judd's
crack fiend wooer) were absolutely ridiculous.
Elliot could possibly have salvaged this film by further exploring his characters. As it is, the
audience is on the outside looking in, and, because of the absence of transition and the overemphasized visual effects, the
whole thing seems aimless,
muddled, and, like McGregor,
whose character digresses
throughout, utterly confused.

Scud: the Disposable Assassin
in the same way I hate sad movies because
they force emotion upon me and con me
into exposing some facet of myself that I
would rather not reveal to a roomful of
strangers.
Okay, you are probably thinking that
this is creepy and all, and at the same time,
a problem that is really not that unique
this liking someone that you cannot have.
And you're probably also wondering
where the connection to a comic book is,
which would be a legitimate concern, because this is a comic book columnand not
just a forum for my therapeutic complaining and rambling. Ok. Well let me set up
some background.
This comic is set in the future, a future
where you can buy robotic assassins
(Scuds) in vending machines and then sic
'em on a target. "Scud: the Disposable Assassin" follows the story of one Scud, our
Scud, who discovers accidentally, by looking into a mirror during a fight scene, the
warning on his back that explains how all
Scuds self-destruct after their mission is
accomplished. But Scud's life is already
so intertwined with that of his target that
he can't just let her be. And he can't kill
her either because that would just be his
own suicide.
Don't worry, the comic generally isn't
sad or whiny. I'm just twisting it to apply
to my life. "Scud: the Disposable Assassin" is actually very surreal; Scud's target, Jeff, has an electric plug for a head,

"When Harry Met Sally"
R. 96 minutes.
Starring Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal and Carrie Fisher.

Friday
7:30, 10:00

The 1989 classic romantic comedy seems fitting for Valentine's Day. The plot (it takes 12
years for two friends to realize they are in love with each other) is as old as the movies
themselves, but this favorite's dialogue is sunny and fresh.

"The Sixth Sense"
PG-13. 107 minutes.
Starring Bruce Willis, Olivia Williams and Haley
Osment.

LPAC Cinema
Saturday
7:30, 10:00

If you've heard about "The Sixth Sense," you already know the premise, if you haven't,
suffice it to say,"l see dead people." If you go, you'll see more than just dead people,
you'll see a tantalizing, confusing, intelligent, overloaded horror film with a killer ending.

"The Manchurian Candidate"
PG-13. 126 minutes.
Starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela
Lansbury.

Kirby Lecture Hall
Monday
10:00

This is a 1962 masterpiece in which not a moment lacks edge, tension and a cynical spin.
A Korean War hero (Frank Sinatra) returns to the U.S., where a plagued friend suspects
that the hero's communist captors have turned him into a killing machine.

"The Hurricane"
R. 125 minutes.
Starring Denzel Washington, Deborah Unger and Liev
Schreiber.

7:40, 10:50
Friday
Saturday 7:30,10:40

In June 1966, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a strong contender for the middleweight
boxing title when he was erroneously arrested for three murders and sentenced to serve
three life terms in prison. A boy who read his autobiography works to free him. Denzel
Washington gives a powerful performance in this story about looking for redemption.

"Snow Day"
PG. 90 minutes.
Starring Chevy Chase, Mark Webber and Zena Grey.

7:20,9:35

When a school in upstate NewYork is snowed in, a group of students hijack a plow to
keep the school closed. There's something appealing about the magic associated with a
snow day, but at best, this is cute, at worst, it's uninspired... take your four year old to it.

"Stuart Little"
PG. 92 minutes.
Starring Michael J. Fox, Geena Davis and

7:30

Adapted from E.B. White's childrens' classic,"Stuart Little" uses groundbreaking technology to tell the story of a mouse adopted by the Little family. Somehow, though, the literal
translation into film takes away from the thing that made the book so magical: imagination.

"Eye of the Beholder"
R. 107 minutes.
Starring Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd and k.d. lang.

7:50,10:15,12:30

In this high-tech thriller, The Eye, a lonely British intelligence agent, becomes obsessed
with his new pursuit, a blackmailer (and frenzied murderer) named Joanna Eris. He is
convinced that their two fates as lost souls are somehow connected, but to catch her
would be to lose her.

"The Talented Mr. Ripley"
R. 135 minutes.
Starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett
and Jude Law.

7:50, 10:55

Matt Damon gives an excellent, disturbing performance in one of the year's best thrillers.
The lush, beautiful scenes of Italy in the 1950s contrast sharply with the dark undertones
and complexity of the plot. Based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 literary crime novel, this
coolly beautiful film is an engrossing study of a sociopath's progress.

"Scream 3"
R. 116 minutes.
Starring David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Neve
Campbell.

7:40,9:10, 10:20, 11:50

Playing on the tendency of young viewers toward series-esque programming, the "Scream"
hype continues. The last of the trilogy, the entertainment value of this one will depend on
how much you enjoyed the first two, because it's essentially the same
there are, after
all, only so many ways to redo the same plot.

Based on Stephen King's best-seller, this is the story of a death row murderer locked
away in a Southern prison. Of course, he's not the monster he appears to be, and that's
the big complication.. .that and the fact that the guy has the magical power of healing.
The casting and acting are stellar, making "The Green Mile" a must-see.

A humorous spoof of the television series "Star Trek," "Galaxy Quest" pokes fun at the
show and its... um... devoted fans. Tim Allen's striking resemblance to Willian Shatner
(Trek's Capt. Kirk) is funny enough to carry the film by itself, but unless you are a "Star
Trek" fan and have a sense of humor about Trekkies, it's not for you.

Men's basketball
nets three losses
Kyle Lewis earns spot on Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll
By Ben Park
Phoenix Staff
Sophomore forward Kyle
Lewis earned a spot on the Centennial Conference Weekly
Honor Roll despite the fact that
the men's basketball squad
dropped three in a row, including two to conference foes.
Lewis averaged 13.5 points
over games against Washington
(5-4 conference, 9-11 overall) and
Franklin & Marshall (7-2; 15-5).
In Monday night's home loss to
Drew (6-13), Lewis matched his
billing with 19points and 4 steals,
both career highs, as well as 7 rebounds.
Swarthmore (2-7; 3-17) missed
its chance to pick up a win
against mediocre Drew University. The Rangers had dropped all
10 of their away games this season, and 11 of their last 12 games
overall.
However, the Garnet Tide
found themselves on the losing
end of a 78-61 drubbing after
shooting an abysmal 28.8 percent
from the field. In addition to
Lewis' stellar performance, forward Joe Culley 'OO notched 11
points and grabbed 12rebounds,
including seven offensive
boards.
Both Washington andFranklin
& Marshall came out hot against
the Garnet, as both teams faced
must-win situations.As usual, the
Centennial Conference playoff
race is tight, with the Shoremen
of Washington one game out of
first place in the Eastern Division
and the Diplomats one game
ahead of second place in the
West.
Washington shot 50.9 percent
en route to a 71-53 victory, while
the Diplomats made 58.5 percent
of their shots overall, including
a blistering 18-for-30 in the first
half to take a 47-13 halftime lead.
F&M eventually won 81-50.
Lewis scored 16 against the
Diplomats, while guard David
Pearce 'O3 and center David
Gammill 'O2 each managed 12
points against the Shoremen.

Isaac Cohen pushes the ball down
the court Monday night against
Drew.
Gammill also grabbed a game
high 11 rebounds.
Twin brothers Eran 'O3 and
Asaf Ganot defended each other
for the first time this season during the Franklin & Marshall
game. Future matchups are
highly anticipated by players,
coaches and spectators alike.
Swarthmore's game against
Muhlenburg on Wednesday was
too late for this week's publication.
Swarthmore travels to the
famed Penn Palestra Saturday to
play Ursinus. The team has split
two games with the Bears in the
Palestra since they began playing the series there. Tip-off is at

A hero
passes on
On Veteran's Day in 1990, Derrick Thomas said he was going to dedicate the
game he was about to play against the
Oakland Raiders to his father. Thomas'
father was a helicopter pilot who was
killed in the Vietnam War in the ironically
named OperationLinebacker 11. When all
was said and done that day, Derrick Thomas had honored his father with seven
sacks in that single game, a feat that usually only happens in video games. He was
a pass-rushing outside linebacker in the
Lawrence Taylor mold, but he carried himself with infinitely more class. As a football player, Derrick Thomas was a Hallof-Fame caliber player. As a Patriots fan,
I could smell the sloth-like Drew Bledsoe's
fear through the television when Thomas
was eyeing him.
Derrick Thomas passed on Tuesday
morning. He was thirty-three years old.
When I first heard the news, I could not
fight back the tears. While it was essentially a given that Thomas' playing career
was over after being paralyzed below the
legs in a car accident that occurred on an
icy highway as he was rushing to fly to
the Super Bowl, nearly everyone expected
Thomas to survive.
His death came as

carried himself
with dignity on the
football field. His friends and family and
co-workers will remember him for the
kind of person he was.
I will honor him by never forgetting how
great a football player he was. The legacy
he left in a game so many love immortalizes him.
Death and sports don't go well together.
In a sense, we consider the true greats
immortal. We re-live Joe Dimaggio in old
films, Vince Lombardi every time a coach
uses one ofhis quotes to motivate his team
and Wilt Chamberlain every time the
young fan asks what the record for most
points in a NBA game is. When a great one
goes so early, it jars us back to reality.
Sports are to entertain, to make us smile
and feel emotions we might not have a
chance to experience in our everyday life.
When our heroes die, the impact is more
profound than many of us would ever expect or admit.
Mourn for Derrick Thomas, but know
that he is not completely gone. Every time
you see Jevon Kearse or any speed rusher
blow around the corner and strip the QB,
say to yourself, "That reminds me of Derrick Thomas."And smile. When your sadness for having lost the player is gone,
when summer melts to fall and the gridiron at Arrowhead stadium is frozen, savor the memory of that legendary, secondto-none speed rush.

Swim team out-reaches Dickinson
By Becca Howes-Mischel
Phoenix Staff
With only one more dual meet to go before conferences, both the men's and
women's teams took down Dickinson College this past Saturday. After a long bus
ride and just beginning their resting period that will shave off precious seconds
at conferences, it was with very tired
muscles that the swimmers took to the
pool. Nevertheless, Swarthmore managed
to pull off a victorious ending, 121-69 for
the men and 117-88 for the women. The
women's record stands at 9-2 (5-1) while
the men's is 6-4 (3-2).
In order to win dual meets, you have to
combine fast swims with a strategic
lineup. In the case of competitive meets,
Coach Davis anticipates where the other
coach will place swimmers and then
makes up a lineup to beat them. Often, the
swimmers walk into the meet with the
reassurance, "If you all go the places I
have you going, we'll win." Unfortunately,
close meets usually do not go exactly as
planned. In that case, the team looks to

deck jumped up and down watching first
Alice Bonarou 'O2, then Alissa Parmelee
'Ol and then Ted Sherer 'Ol hold off the
Dickinson swimmers' end-of-the-race
speed. JoDe Hendrick 'OO touched out the
Dickinson swimmer in the 200 butterfly
to pick up an unexpected fifth place. And,
in the last freestyle relays, first Amy
Auerbach 'O2 and then Paul Dickson 'OO
blew the Dickinson swimmers out of the
water in their anchoring leg. For many of
these swims, no one could determine who
had won until the final times flashed
across the score boards. It was in the final hundredths of seconds that
Swarthmore won this meet.
However, not all the races were decided
in the last ten yards. Both the men's and
women's medley relays won comfortably.
David Whitehead 'O3 had phenomenal
wins in the 50 and 100 freestyles as well
as swimming a leg of the final relay. Brent
Wasser 'OO continues to dominate the
backstroke events. Shererand Lillvis covered the breaststroke. Chris Bussard 'O3
took care of the mid-distance freestyles.
In the women's meet, Auerbach dusted the
Dickinson swimmer in the 1000 midway
through the race. Claire Arbour 'OO and
Davita Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 dominated
the 200 freestyle. Bonarou claimed the IM
and the breaststroke. It was these first
place swims as well as all the supporting
swims that allowed Swarthmore to "let
Dickinson eat wake."

pick up points from unexpected sources.
At the Dickinson meet the men knew
that they would have to win every race to
win, and they did. This group of nine men
has really stepped up to cover any cracks
that their size may leave open. As demonstrated in this meet, they have used pure
speed to compensate for any lack of depth.
The women also were supposed to win
every race, and they did not. But, the
beauty of this team sport is that other
swimmers stepped up and stole places
away from Dickinson. Two years ago, at
Dickinson, Dickinson women won by one
point (a fifth place swim). This year, it was
a combination of third, fourth, and fifth
place finishes that helped win the women's
meet. For both the men's and women's
teams, some amazing swims were decided
by the outstretched hand of a Swat swimmer out-touching a Dickinson swimmer to
the wall.
During the 1000 yard freestyle John
Lillvis 'O3 and the Dickinson swimmer
paced stroke for stroke for the entire ten

speed that won him the race. In both the

Fuchsman fire behind women's field events
By Marc Jeuland
Phoenix Staff
A successful track & field squad consists ofmany components, and people are
not always fully aware of some of them.
A successful team must be able to unify
those components into an integrated
whole. High profile events, generally
races, unfortunately sometimes overshadow other important and hard to master skills, such as the throws and jumps.
Nearly every American can identify
Michael Johnson or Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
but how many know the names of world
class discus or shot put throwers?
It is in this type of environment, with
the added academic challenges of
Swarthmore, that Clara Fuchsman 'Ol has
made tremendous improvements in her
ability to throw a heavy round shot. Clara
joined the track team only because "Annie
[Baumgartner], my best friend, was lonely
because she was the only shot-putter." She
was just planning to keep her friend company.
Two years later, Clara has increased her
throwing best from high school by about
7 feet: from 25 feet, 9 inches, to 32' 9.5. At
the Wesleyan University meet about two
weeks ago, she threw that new best, improving on her previous mark by over 14
inches, and catapulting to contention in the
conference standings. She is currently the
only woman thrower on the team, and she
comments, "I feel lonely, but it's OK because the guys are funny. Before they
came in I was really lonely. But I stay on
the team because I have fun. Throwing
heavy objects really is fun. I meet people
I might never otherwise meet. Besides, it's
also a challenge...to beat really big
people."
Always humble, Fuchsman credits her
improvement to better coaching, though
she does admit that she is stronger than

If a player goes over or through

2. Players' helmets will be

Freshman Ali Furman also
stepped up to provide a muchneeded offensive spark on the
Washington court. She was perfect from the foul line (5-5) and
contributed 9 points total. Pam
Lavallee 'O3 suffered a serious
ankle sprain in the contest on a
mean drive to the basket in the
first half. She hopes to be back
on the court before the conclusion of the regular season. Swat's
opponents do not.
The team faced and defeated
non-conference opponent Eastern College the following Thursday, winning 61-46. The Garnet
squad did not overwhelm the
small Eastern team from the tipoff, however, as the game remained close in the first 20 minutes of play. The freshman biggirl-in-the-middle Sarah Tufano
chipped in 22 points and ripped
down 7 big boards. In combination with Heather Kile's 19 points
and 12rebounds, Tufano and Kile
were a force too strong for the
Eastern opponents to reckon
with.

offensive and defensive threat,

but unfortunately not the outcome they desired, losing by a

comes despite Swat shooting a
superior 39 percent from the
floor, including 50 percent from
beyond the arc (F&M 39 percent)
and 89.5 percent from the free
throw line (F&M 79 percent). The
tell-all statistic of the game
proved to be Swat's 21 turnovers

of the ball. Despite the loss, Kile

long delay at F&M Invitational

5. If a player is disgruntled
with his contract or playing time,
he can switch teams in the middle
of a game or play. Imagine a
pissed-off running back who is
supposed to pass block on the
quarterback's blind side turn
around and knock his quarterback senseless.
6. If one team is driving down
the field late in the game, trying
to put the game out of reach, their
arch-rivals can come out of
locker room and interfere.
7. The traditional pouring of
Gatorade on the coach of the
championship team is abandoned
in favor of choke-slamming the
coach through a table.
8. The XFL Championship can
only be seen on pay per view for
the mere price of $79.99. There
will be a replay of the game two
days later for $49.99.
9. Possible franchise names
could be: San Francisco Sockos,
Boston Bottom Lines, Jacksonville Jabronies, Pittsburgh Puppies, Los Angeles Poontang Pies,
St. Louis Smackdown, Tennessee
Tombstones and the San Antonio
Stunners.
10. The slogan for the XFL
should be: If any ofyou rooty-poo
candy asses aren't down with
XFL, then I got two words for

Marc's spikes, but rather her own, finished second
in the 5000-meter run. Karen Lloyd 'OO finished
fifth in the 5,000-meter run as well. Rounding out
the results for the women, the Distance Medley
team (Sarah Jay 'Ol, Akpan, Lloyd, and Agunloye)
finished fourth.
On the men's side, Marc Jeuland 'Ol, wearing his
own spikes, finished first in the 5000-meter run.
JeffDoyon 'OO finished fifth in the 1,500-meter run.
Catch the amazing track and field team this Saturday at 12 p.m. at the fieldhouse in the
Swarthmore Invitational. It shall prove to be an
exciting meet since conferences are coming soon.

Garnet drops three straight

Do you smellllll
what the WWF
is cooking?
Finally the WWF has come back to athletic supremacy. For those of you who
have not yet heard, the WWF (if you don't
know what WWF stands for, stop reading)
will be launching a professional football
league called the XFL. Unlike the World
Wrestling Federation, competition within
the Xiting and Xilerating Football League
(I was hoping for X-rated) will not be
scripted. As WWF owner Vince McMahon
explained, "The WWF is 100 percent entertainment. But the XFL will be 100 percent sports."

100 percent sports? That remains to be

seen, especially since McMahon cannot

Lady Garnet close in on playoff berth

With a historic victory notched against
Washington College last Tueday, the
Swarthmore women's basketball team
continues to play solid basketball as the
final leg of the long winter season approaches. The Lady Garnet are not quite
ready for their season to end, however, as
these tenacious women eye a Centennial
Conference playoff bid for the first time
in the school's history. Their current
record stands at 7-2 in the conference and
12-8 overall.

The women are hoping to finish strong
and bring the program and Swarthmore
athletics to a new level. Excitement is
mounting as the team commands respect
for the Swarthmore name in arenas outside of the classroom; these ladies mean
business and continue to get the job done
with hard line efficiency.
The women carried this cutthroat attitude over into their latest competitions
against Washington College and Eastern
College, which proved to be successful
outings for the Garnet. Although the Tide
did drop a tough game to Franklin &
Marshall College this past Saturday, the
women are not daunted and remain fo-

The Garnet Tide made history last Tuesday when they won for the first time at
Washington College, 62-46. This also
marks the first ever Garnet sweep of the
Shorewomen. Although the victory was
truly a team effort, the "Heathers" again
put up huge numbers to lift Swarthmore
over an aggressive Washington squad.

help but add a touch of the entertainment
quality the WWF provides. For instance,
players will wear helmet cameras and
microphones. Plus there will be greater
television access to sideline activities to
further enhance the viewers' experience.
The XFL is set to launch next February,
hoping to ride the wave of footballenthusiasm created by the NFL's Super Bowl.
The first season will have eight teams
playing a 10-game regular season schedule. The top four teams will be in a playoff round followed by a championship
game.
Perhaps the best aspect of the new
league is the payment plan. Unlike the
NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL, XFL players
will be paid strictly on incentives. This
means players get paid only as much as
they produce on the field. This system
would strike fear into the hearts of many
of other professional athletes. Overpaid
jabronies like Kordell Stewart, Hideki
Irabu and Juwan Howard have to settle
for the pennies they deserve. Meanwhile,
guys who come out of nowhere to layeth
the smacketh down wouldbe awardedfor
their efforts (i.e. Kurt Warner, Steve
Beuerlein and Jeff Zimmerman). If nothing else, it will be interesting to see just
how pissed off a running back gets when
the fullback gets the goalline dive.
While there are several wrestlers in the
WWF with football backgrounds,
McMahon assures wrestling fans that
"they will be interested only as fans."
McMahon makes it very clear that the
XFL will be just as selective, if not more
so, than rival football organizations. "We
only want tough guys in this league. This
won't be a league for sissies or
pantywaists," said McMahon.
Sorry, Lawrence Phillips, get your bags
packed for Europe. Bledsoe, I could give
two drops of monkey piss if you have a
boo-boo on your thumb you've gotta be
tough to hang in this league. Quit your
bitching, Scottie Pippen, and play, even if
you aren't buddy-buddy with your teammates.

Official rules for the league have not yet
been finalized. XFL executive Basil
DeVito explained that the rules will be
aimed towards a faster-paced game than
we're used to from existing leagues. I've
come up with a short list of rules that the
XFL should instate to maintain the edgeof-your-seat excitement standards set by
the WWF.
