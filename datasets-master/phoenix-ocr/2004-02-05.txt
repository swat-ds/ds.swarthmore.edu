Inadequate heat
plagues students
BY MARY MINTEL AND CHRISTINA TEMES
mmintell@swarthmore.edu and
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Students have experienced discomfort in
the past weeks due to problems with heating
in several dorms on campus.
One of the hardest hit areas is the north
side of Parrish fourth, where temperatures
dipped as low as 57 degrees, Director of
Maintenance Ralph Thayer said. This is 11
degrees lower than the "normal range" of
temperature, which is 68-72 degrees,
according to Director of Residential Life
Myrt Westphal.

"It's been freezingly cold," Parrish fourth
resident Qing Ling 'O7 said. Ling, who
stayed at the college during winter break,
coped by piling all her clothing on top of her
quilt and taking showers in the afternoon,
when it was

slightly

warmer.

"I've been sleeping in a hat
and five layers. It didn't
work. I got sick."
Dana Seay 'O7
She would have complained about the
heat over break, but "there weren't many

people around. I didn't know who to talk to,"
she said.
Her hallmates Dana Seay 'O7 and Cristina
Alva 'O7 have called Facilities many times.
"They just come in and look around, then
they tell us to move our beds back, that the
pillows are blocking the heat," Seay said.
"I've been sleeping in a hat and five layers.
It didn't work. I got sick," she said, adding
that her sinus infection had gotten worse
since she had been sleeping in a cold room.
Westphal said she had not received any
temperature-related complaints in over a

week.
The cold temperatures are nothing new
for Parrish residents. They have endured
cold winters in the past.
"I could tell even before October break
that I would need to bring some extra blankets from home to get me through the winter without freezing," last year's Parrish
resident Katharine Merow 'O6 said in an email. Students living across the hall from
her had the opposite problem and were
warm in shorts and tank tops.
Merow's hallmate from last year, Karen
Zaino 'O6, also lived on the north side and
experienced the cold, but she never complained to Facilities. She thought the maintenance department had already been bombarded with calls from other students and
assumed not much could be done to solve
the problem. "I figured if it were easy to fix
it would have been fixed a long time ago,"
Zaino said.
Last year, Mac Carlson 'O4 lived in the
Parrish fourth single closest to the fifth
floor stairwell and said it was often unbearably cold, especially on windy days.
"I frequently kept my winter coat on at
all times in my room, and when it was worst
I wore gloves so that I could type or write,"
he said.
Unlike Zaino and Merow, however,
Carlson made several complaints to the

THE PHOENIX

Facilities office about the temperature.
Other than being given practical advice,
such as to leave enough space in front of the
heater, Carlson was simply told that the
problem could not be entirely fixed until the
upcoming renovations.
Ben Masten 'O4 also complained about
the lack of heat in his room. "The heating
situation was completely wretched," Masten
said. "My room was constantly freezing, and
I remember getting blankets out to wrap
myself in, while sitting shivering at my
desk, on more than one occasion."

"Parrish is a problem building," Thayer
said of the recurring heat problems in the
building. Facilities has received complaints

about the temperature this year off and on
since Thanksgiving, Thayer said.
Facilities has taken responses upon complaints in the past but was unable to find a
permanent solution. It was not until recently that Thayer himself became aware of the
problem and is now looking for a solution.
"Once things get to the top, they can get
done," he said.
Thayer explained that Parrish operates

on a hot water heat system, with valves con-

trolling the heat flow to all of the floors.
Facilities is scheduled today to configure
the system so all the flow will go to the
fourth floor, which will reveal whether
there is some type of blockage. If there is,
Thayer said, he is not sure of what facilities
would do next. There may also be a problem
with the valves themselves. Despite frequent problems with the heating system,
Thayer said, the Parrish renovation plans
do not currently include updating the system in any way.
Meanwhile, attempts to lessen the cold on
the fourth floor have led to the heat "baking
the second and third floors," Thayer said.
The problem of dorms being too hot has
affected other dorms on campus, such as
Wharton and Dana. Thayer said this was
due to a lack of individual heat controllers
for each space. Therefore, depending on the
location of a room in a building in relation
to the sun, temperatures can fluctuate.
"My roommate has dubbed our room
'the oven,' and we leave our windows
cracked in order to keep from roasting at
night," Merow, who now lives in Dana, said.
This practice of opening windows to
reduce the heat can cause a great energy
loss, engineering professor Carr Everbach
said.
Every 5.48 hours of lost energy from an
open window costs $2O, which is equivalent
to burning over 300 bright lightbulbs,

to a speculative study by
Everbach.
"The point is that heat embodies a lot of
energy and a lot of money
it's really
according

...

insane to let all that heat out into the cold

air," Everbach said.

"The problem is that open windows make
it seem like more heat is needed. It's a
vicious cycle," said Keefe Keeley 'O6, who
was the Earthlust coordinator last semester.
Kelley added that students ought to call
workbox if their rooms are too hot, explaining that "heat is one of the largest energy

expenditures."
Earthlust is currently involved in an initiative to lower the amount of energy students use to encourage the college to use
more wind energy rather than fossil fuels.

Swarthmore staff, including Sharpies employee Andre Singleton, will be covered
by a new benefits plan.

New benefit plan and job
grading system announced
BY CAROLINE GRUBBS

cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu
Human Resources announced a new benefits plan for all faculty and staff dur-

ing an all-staff meeting in December. HR also presented a revised job-grading structure that will affect all staff members in January.
The new benefits include a change in base health-care coverage from the
Keystone HMO to the Keystone Point of Service plan, extended dental options, and
more equal family coverage, according to the Weekly News.
The new benefits plan is the result of a process started last year by the
Faculty/Staff Benefits

Committee and

Swarthmore's acceptance

into the

Philadelphia Area Independent Schools Insurance Group, said Marty Cormican,
HR manager of compensation and benefits.
PAISIG is a consortium of 76 secondary and post-secondary schools. The college
decided to join because it can purchase health care at a lower rate as a part of the
larger organization and offer a larger variety of health care options, Cormican

said.
Now, because of PAISIG, the Point of Service coverage is available to give
employees access to specialist doctors outside of the HMO network while still
being covered by health insurance, Cormican said.
Employees, however, may choose to remain with the HMO plan. Also, a wider
range of dentists is available and there is a 9 percent increase in funding for family coverage, the Weekly News reported.
The FSBC presented the new benefits plan to college employees at All Staff and
Faculty meetings both this year and last year, Cormican said.
Sharpies employee Andre Singleton was enthusiastic about the new benefits.
"Anytime the benefits improve, it's a plus," he said.
But, some dining services staff were unclear about the changes in benefit plans.
When asked to comment on the revised benefits, dining staff member Beverly
Warren said. "I don't know anything about it."
Claudia Fagioli, a Sharpies cashier, was also unaware of new updates but said
that if it were beneficial to the staff she would be in favor of them. "Dining services are hard to get to," Cormican said. "Sometimes we might miss somebody." There
will be more meetings scheduled in late February to further explain the changes in

the new benefits plan to staff.
The new benefits plan will go into effect in April.
New job grading system to be implemented

Later this year, the college staff will experience a change in job grading.
According to the compensation philosophy chapter of the Human Resources Web
site, the college divides its employees into different position classifications based
on education, experience, organizational impact, complexity of skills and supervision. These positions are grouped into a pay grade, within which varying ranges
of pay reflect the importance of the job.

Diebold drops takedown orders

ITS expunges worm
from college network
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Information Technology Services successfully defended the college's network
from the threat of the MyDoom computer
worm, preventing possibly severe disruptions in network traffic last weekend.
The college's network, in addition to
many other computer systems around the
world, was attacked by the MyDoom computer worm, The Phoenix reported last
week.
The worm takes the form of a mass email, mimicking the style of an e-mail
from a familiar person with an attachment. MyDoom contained code that
would cause each infected computer to
send large volumes of junk data to a Web
site in what is called a denial of service
attack, causing the Web site to be shut
down.

ITS Director Judy Downing said the
adoption of new policies, such as the
required installation of anti-virus software, allowed Swarthmore to effectively
combat the latest virus.
"In past attacks, even a relatively
small number of campus computers gen-

erated so much traffic as to make our
Internet connection unusable. We almost
certainly averted another major Internet

interruption similar to what we saw last
September as a result of the new tools and
procedures," Downing said in an e-mail.

ITS was recording 240 infected e-mails
per minute at the peak of the e-mail barrage last week, according to ITS Manager
of Network and Systems Mark Dumic. By
Monday, this rate had decreased to 40
infected e-mails per minute. The normal
rate under low virus conditions is two or
three tainted e-mails per minute.
ITS has taken a proactive approach to
prevent e-mail communications from
becoming a method of spreading viruses.
The college actively scans incoming e-

mails and routinely conducts individual
mailbox scans to detect viruses that may
have gotten through the spot scan,
according to Dumic.
These scans pose no privacy threat

because "there are virtually no human
eyes looking at individual files or their
owners at any point in the process,"
Downing said. The process is necessary

to block infections that enter through email during the first 18 to 24 hours of a

virus outbreak before new definition
files are available.
The SCO Group, a software company
that manufactures Unix, was negatively
affected by the MyDoom virus. The
denial of service attack was aimed at
SCO's Web site and was successful in
taking SCO off the Internet, causing

ceased asking individuals at universities
across the country, including Swarthmore,
to remove internal company e-mails from

But Luke. Smith 'O6 and Nelson
Pavlosky 'O6 said they plan to continue
their litigation against the electronic voting machine manufacturer however in the
hopes of setting a precedent against filing
what they say are baseless copyright
infringement claims.
The company recently received a damaging review in a report by the state of
Maryland, which argued that potential
security issues were serious enough that
Diebold software should be rewritten prior
to use in any actual elections.
"We were genuinely surprised at the
basic level of the exploits," author Michael
Wertheimer said. Researchers were able to

cast multiple votes, change vote totals and
unlock the machines in "approximately 10
seconds," according to The New York

Times.
Because the machines keep no paper
records of the voting totals, such tampering
could go unnoticed, the study's authors

Under the new job-grading system, the
number of pay grades will be reduced from
30 to 13. The HR department decided to
decrease the number of pay grades because
"wider grades mean most jobs have a higher maximum, which will give long term
employees more room to move. [Fewer pay
grades] simplifies the system making it easier to understand and easier to administer," Associate Vice President of Human
Resources Melanie Young said via e-mail.
Though some employees may see a pay
increase as a result of the new grades, no

one's salary will be decreased, the Weekly
News reported.
"The whole pay structure has a slight
upward tilt," Young said. "The majority of

copies of internal Diebold e-mails between

Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital
Commons and Why War? were within their
rights when they posted and distributed the
material online.

The case began when Why War? posted
files on its Web site, why-war.com, that had
been taken from a Diebold server that left
unprotected by password. In response to the
posting of the memos, Diebold sent takedown requests to the group's Web hosts,
claiming the group was engaging in copyright infringement.

The documents over which Diebold and
the Swarthmore students are engaged in litigation contain evidence of similar security
issues from 2002 and 2003. In one instance, a

Gore in a Florida precinct. Other e-mails
advised company representatives to "fake

important enough for public distribution.

Historian Schlesinger to speak LIVING WAGE NOW!
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., historian,
social critic and speechwriter for John F.
Kennedy, will speak at Swarthmore to inaugurate the new James Field lectureship.
Schlesinger, who was born in 1917, attended Harvard in the 1930s and then fought in
World War 11. He went on to advise and write
speeches for President Kennedy.

"Bush has replaced a policy
aimed at peace through the
prevention of war by a
policy aimed at peace
through preventive war.
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.
"He is the best interpreter of the Kennedy
administration, as he was the most involved
in it," history professor Marjorie Murphy
said. "We can't offer him much money, and it
is a new lectureship, but even though he is
in his eighties, he is still hopping on a train

and coming down."

After
assassination,
Kennedy's
Schlesinger wrote "A Thousand Days: JFK
in the White House," analyzing his administration. He also wrote "The Imperial
Presidency" and "The Vital Center." In 1946
and 1996, he won the Pulitzer Prize for history and biography respectively.
He is also the two-time winner of the
National Book Award.
Schlesinger's talk is entitled "Patrotism
and Dissent in Wartime." Murphy expects

THE PHOENIX

that the lecture will center on current US
foreign policy
towards Iraq, since
Schlesinger recently published "Eyeless in
Iraq," an article criticizing the war in the
October 2003 New York Review of books.
"Mr. Bush has replaced a policy aimed at
peace through the prevention of war by a
policy aimed at peace through preventive
war. He did this quietly, smoothly, and skillfully, without calling undue attention to so
fundamental a revision of foreign policy or
provoking a national debate over his drastic
change of course," Schlesinger wrote. In the
same article, he argued that if postwar leaders had adopted the same strategies as Bush,
nuclear war would have broken out in the
first few days after World War 11.
Schlesinger is the first speaker in a new
annual series of lectures in honor of former
Swarthmore history professor James Field.
Field and Schlesinger attended Harvard
together, and both served in World War 11.
After Field's death, Thomas D. Jones Jr.
'53, Vera Lundy Jones '5B and their children,
Thomas D. Jones 111 'B7 and Gwyneth Jones
Cote 'B4, gave Swarthmore a charitable
reminder unitrust and a gift of cash to start
the lectureship in memoriam of Field.
"The parents are the ones who actually
made the gift, but each generation knew
him, and at least one person in each generation had him as a teacher," Director of
Planned Giving Ted Mills said.
The Jones family was unavailable for
comment.
"It's very exciting that the college is introducing a lecture series in American history
for the first time," Murphy said. "It's especially appropriate that such a distinguished historian is inaugurating the series."
The lecture will be at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday,
Feb. 10, in the Lang Performing Arts Center.

One Book program seeks to increase multicultural dialogue

BY TERESA KELLEY
tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu

When young James Mcßride
asked his mother, "What color is
God?" she told him "God is the
color of water. Water doesn't have
color and everybody can drink it,
regardless of color."
In "The Color of Water," his collection of memoirs, Mcßride wanted to inspire others to have similar
conversations. In choosing this
book for its citywide reading initiative, Philadelphia hopes to do
just that, but not all ofSwarthmore
is listening.
The

One
Philadelphia program, now in its
year, hopes
second
to
use

Mcßride's book to increase literacy and encourage conversations
about the multiculturalism, religion, identity and family values
addressed in the book.
One objective of the program,
sociology professor Sarah Willie
said, is to increase dialogue among
people "not in the habit of talking
to one another."

The book is organized as a
series of memoirs, documenting
;he story of black author James

Mcßride and his white mother,
Ruth. This dualism of moving from
one voice to another, according to
Willie, gives the book a "musical"

with various themes in the memoir.
When selecting speakers for the
lecture series, Willie made a conscious effort to have people of

diverse races, religions, socioeco-

nomic statuses and genders. She
said she believed
the book

appealed to a large and varied
audience, and she sought to represent this quality in her selection of
speakers.

Rafael

Zapata,

assistant dean

and director of the Intercultural
Center, will be one of three panelists speaking on themes of race

Monday night series. He plans to
bring to the discussion his own
experiences growing up Latino in
New York City and hopes that sharing his story will encourage others
to examine their own lives.

Dena Henderson 'O6, who has a
courseload of English and social

sciences, said she typically reads
500-1,000 pages a week, something
she "can't get done as is."

"You're participating in something larger
than Swarthmore, and you're giving
yourself the opportunity to think
differently about your own life."
Professor Sarah Willie
Kelman said the purpose of the

was to examine community reactions to "The Color of
Water" as well as whether the One

Book project is achieving its objectives of encouraging literacy and
"bridging culture and racial gaps."

After attending the opening
discussion Feb. 2, Kelman questioned whether these goals were
being met. He said those attending
the discussion were "interested
and engaged," yet appeared to be
largely "people you would expect

to find at book talks": educated,

students "may feel guilty about
reading a book for pleasure."

At Swarthmore, knowledge of
and participation in the One Book,
One Philadelphia program is low.
Students appear hesitant to add it
to their reading load. Zapata said

She said she would be more
inclined to read the book if professors incorporated it into their

classes.
Steve Levin of Swarthmore's
bookstore said there has not been a
high demand for the book. He
ordered about six copies after hearing it was selected for the program
but has sold only a few. Levin also
said no professor has requested the

title for classes. If there is an

increased demand for the title,
Levin added, the bookstore could

easily order more copies.
Knowing that Swarthmore students have a large reading load,
Willie is aware that many will not
be inclined to pick up additional
books. Yet Willie describes the
book as a quick read that is more

than worthwhile. After investing a

single afternoon, she said, "you've

read a lovely piece of writing,
you're participating in something
larger than Swarthmore, and
you're giving yourself the opportunity to think differently about your
own life."
Christopher Densmore, curator

of the Friends Historical Library,
and Multi members Val Maulbeck
'O6 and Anna Masilela 'O4 will be

leading a discussion on themes

related to "The Color of Water."

Masilela hopes to bring a more

contemporary perspective to analyzing issues of race in this book.

She said the book is relevant in

"figuring out complicated issues,"
especially understanding the hows
and whys behind the ways people
choose to identify themselves as
multicultural.
In addition to encouraging better interaction among people
throughout the Philadelphia area,
the program seeks to promote literacy. Willie believes the One Book,
One Philadelphia program is an
example of "positive peer pressure"
that will encourage people who are
not in the habit of reading to pick
up this book.
Last year's selection for the
One

inaugural
One
Philadelphia program was Lorene
Carey's "The Price of a Child."
Several professors assigned the
historical fiction account of an
escaped slave in Philadelphia.

Men's soccer holds youth clinic for famine relief

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Students who entered the Lamb-Miller Field House Sunday
afternoon were greeted by a large group of children waiting with
soccer balls in hand and being helped into shin guards by parents.
The reason for this assembly was a youth soccer clinic the
men's soccer team held to raise funds for famine relief efforts in
Ethiopia.
About 80 local children between the ages of six and 15 attended the event, head coach Eric Wagner said. The clinic, which is in
its second year, lasted two hours, during which the children
worked with the players and their coaches. These included a
skills warmup, small games, a passing demonstration and exercises, goalkeeper exercises and larger games, according to
Wagner.

Participants were asked to donate $lO to support Africare, a
non-profit relief organization that has a special famine relief program in Ethiopia. As of Monday, the team had raised $BOO, and
Wagner expects the amount to exceed $l,OOO as more donations
come in from other sources.
Before the activities, Wagner gave a brief speech about famine
and the need to provide aid to relief efforts. "55,000 young children in Ethiopia
don't have food on the table and roofs over
their heads and proper water," Wagner said.
Parents were willing to donate the money, and the children
were enthusiastic about the event. "$lO per person is cheap
for
two hours, you can't go to too many places for that," mother
Alyce Kikpatrick said.
"The kids had a great time
all the parents were really happy
that we're doing this and more than happy to donate," team
member Charles Taylor 'O6 said.
Wagner conceived the clinic in the fall of 2002, when he heard
a report of the dire famine in Ethiopia. He had studied Africa in
college, and the presence of Ethiopian players on the team led
Wagner to think that the clinic would be "an easy and exciting
way to make a bit of impact." Last year's clinic raised over $l,OOO
for the cause.

Janet Jackson wins Super Bowl
At least be as American
as a Canadian
For those of you who have been stuck in McCabe for the past
three weeks, the Super Bowl was last Sunday, nipples and all.
On that hallowed Sunday of Sundays, some Swatties celebrated,
others got loaded, and most just did work. But there are some
things more important than reading, and the Super Bowl was
one of them. The Super Bowl
unites Americans, and last
Sunday, our country stood
tall and united, even though
most Swatties preferred to
sit.
Still, we managed to completely avoid boring Swatties
on Super Bowl Sunday, and
we reveled in our patriotism
in Willets. Let us just state
for the record that four J
briskets, two racks of ribs, a

During the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIi 1, a "wardrobe malfunction" occured, exposing Janet Jackson's
right breast to 100 million viewers. Justin Timberlake called the incident "not intentional and regrettable."

Swatties watch big game at DU, Mephistos
On Sunday night, I was reassured that traditional American values are still set in stone and that
some things never change no matter
your geographical location. This
reminder came in the form of the
most anticipated sports game of the
year, Super Bowl XXXVIII. Being
from Texas and a former cheerleader, I've always carried the
stereotypical belief that
only
Southerners are deeply invested in
the game of football. Last Sunday, I
was proved wrong. I engaged in

pigskin hysteria, intently watching
the New England Patriots and
Carolina Panthers face off in my

hometown of Houston.

But all this meat doesn't compare to the tender breast we all
got a taste of. Thank you, Justin Timberlake, you have finally
done something good for the world, and it's made up for all the
shitty music you wrote. In case you haven't heard, Janet
Jackson's nipple was revealed for the world to see by Justin "Hot
Pants" Timberlake. There was also a step-dancing naked guy
after halftime who was taken out by a large linebacker. CBS,
however, did not share our enthusiasm regarding the streaker.
They panned away so that you couldn't see what was going on. If
a guy manages to get through Super Bowl security when we are
at code magenta, he deserves to be on TV for 15 seconds.
The commercials were good, too. The "Speed of Sound" com-

Homer Simpson MasterCard commercial was pure genius.
Pure frickin' genius. And then there was the Jimi Hendrix

Pats by three in the fourth with a field goal. The Patriots' twopoint conversion was enough to make Emiliano have to change
his pants. Carolina rallied, making the last few minutes of the
game exciting, but the thought of missing Janet's boob was too
much, and they couldn't hold their concentration.
But this column, like all our columns, has a point. The Super
Bowl is a part of your culture, and, as an American, you should
at least be mildly interested in watching it. Swatties travel
across the globe to learn and enjoy other cultures. We
go to Madrid for bullfighting, India for cricket, Turkey for
backgammon and Afghanistan for hide-and-seek. And we love
it while we're doing it, but so few of us have any understanding
of our own national culture. We are too self-hating and self-defecating. We aren't saying that you have to love the Super Bowl,
but if we Swatties want to be as intellectually curious and
diverse as we claim, we should try to be a little bit more local.
In closing, Jon, a Canadian who loves eating Emiliano's
smoked meat, is more American than all of you. Put on some
weight and drink a beer, because it's your culture, whether you

A guide to casual sex
We would be the last

such damnation would
entail. We like sex. A
relationship, or sex in
the context of a relationship, is not in any way
undesirable. And this is
not to say those of you
who have yet to have

Sexual Healing

sex should do so in a
casual way
this could

although
alleviate

some of the previously
virginity
referenced
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
issues. Instead, our role
is to evaluate non-exclusive sexual practices and to give you some tips in case you

make the decision to enter this lifestyle.
There are many kinds of non-exclusive sexual relationships. They range from those that can hardly be called

relationships
i.e., one-night stands to seriously emotional, ongoing relationships where each party is emotionally invested but circumstances prevent exclusivity.
Unfortunately, uninformed non-exclusivity
known colloquially as "cheating"
is also included in this paradigm. We're going to shelve that concern and assume that
we are discussing ongoing, consensual, non-exclusive,
safe sex. Sorry, playa, this doesn't apply to you.
Under these constraints, a conversation establishing
your status must ensue. Although none of your conversa-

tions will be as formally delineated as our vows (see box),
similar concerns should be addressed. First of all, how emotionally committed will you be? Are you just sport-fucking?
Are you friends with "privileges"? Or do you genuinely care
about each other but happen to sleep with other people?
What level of commitment can you give to other partners
(some couples are only exclusive with their emotions)?
Second, you need to establish your sexual expectations. Are
you booty-call material? Do your hookups stem from freak
encounters? Or does sex require a "workout" (or, in our
case, "community service") sticker in your Swarthmore
daily planner? Third, are you the jealous type? Realize that
non-exclusivity means that your partner can, may and
pursue other sexshould to preserve your agreement
ual ventures. And finally, what was the nature of your relationship beforehand, and are the potential consequences
worth a couple of orgasms assuming you orgasm?
So, you've signed the papers and are well on the road to
your first sexcapade. Great! Right? Maybe. In our experience, things usually disintegrate when one person's feelings change. Caring less simply ends the sex. There are
usually no seriously hurt feelings. But caring too much is

an explicit breach of contract. That's the catch for both
parties. The more committed person either hides his or
her emotions and suffers, or breaks it off and suffers. The
less committed person either takes advantage of the other
person's attachment and hurts him or her, or breaks it off

and hurts him or her. Sucks! 'Nuff said.

Double-booking requires tact, time management and

stamina. Be wary of informing double-bookies of your
schedule, particularly the earlier one. He or she may think
that you are compensating for his or her inadequacies.
Though emotions are accounted for, remember that egos

are still at stake. Logistically, be honest with yourself about
your sexual potential. Guys, how telltale is your second-,
third- or fourth-round performance? And ladies, carry lube.
We've also found that trying to have ongoing relationships with more than three or four people at a time is all
but impossible. Seriously, just don't do it! Even if you have
enough time and stamina, you don't want to be on aca-

demic probation.
Generally, be honest, especially if your expectations
change or there are safety concerns.
As we've said before: Do not get attached. Non-exclusivity is almost never a "stage" in a relationship once sex
is introduced; instead, it serves to limit further options.

'The Perfect Score' not a 1600
BY EVA HOLMAN

They just might find the joke where Kyle

scoffs, "SATs? What does that stand for
Sucks Ass Test?" funny only the first two

As college students, we harbor a secret
fascination with the college admissions
process. It is what keeps our old essays
within printing distance, what forces us to
tack highlighted copies of our best SAT
scores on our bulletin boards so our roommates will be impressed and like us. At the
same time, many of us realize we can
manipulate our results through years of

times.)
Each teen in the ensemble cast is offensively buried in a stereotype. There's
Desmond, a black basketball player who
needs to raise his score to 900. There's Roy,
a stoner Asian who is innately brilliant at
math and science. Anna and Francesca are

neurotic studying (and, sadly, many of us
a
did just that). So "The Perfect Score"
movie that acts out every high school
senior's fantasy of sticking it to
Educational Testing Service
seemed like
an original movie worth seeing.
The premise is interesting enough:

Kyle, a would-be architect, faces imminent
rejection from Cornell because of his test

scores. So he does what any other kid who
happens to live in Princeton, N.J. would do:
He hatches a clandestine yet poorly concealed plot to break into ETS and steal the
answers, with what we hope will be hilarious results. But if the viewer's hopes aren't
dashed to pieces within the first five seconds by the "MTV Productions" logo, they
probably won't endure the movie's superficial tackling of America's college admissions system.
That is not to say that "The Perfect
Score" is unbearable for everyone. Those
who enjoy seeing the world through the
lens of a rebellious, pot-smoking narrator
will feel right at home. (Indeed, any viewer who is no longer or never was a 12-yearold boy may have a rare pang of regret.

man-hating supervixens (introduced as "a
future Ph.D. with a nice A. S. S." and "The
Forbidden Fruit," respectively). And Kyle
and Matty round out the cast as the two presumably burdened with releasing Anna and

Francesca from the shackles of feminism.
The two women are the best students of
the six but deliberately non-threatening in
their intelligence. Anna is class salutatorian yet, when asked by Kyle why she keeps
bombing the SATs, she prettily recounts
how a story problem involving a woman at
a train station confused her because she
"kept picturing the woman's face, wondering where she was going." The movie
almost asks the viewer to have pity: How
can anyone as fragile and sensitive as
Anna not wonder about the well-being of
the characters in story problems?
If the movie was trying to bring the fundamental unfairness of the SATs to the
audience's attention, it did not get its message across very well. During the movie's
climax, each of our six heroes gives his or

her personal reasons for wanting to cheat
on the SATs. When Desmond proclaims,
"Because the SATs are racist!" the audience erupted into laughter. Desmond,
Anna and Francesca frequently mention

Courtesy of CelebrityDesktop.com

the SATs' biases against women and people
of color, but each are so outrageously
stereotyped themselves that the important
message becomes a joke to the viewers.
In the end, the ETS still represents the
mother of all faceless profit machines for
high schoolers across the country. One
therefore becomes easily invested in the
six teens' triumph, which makes the various break-in attempts among the movie's
most exciting moments. Yet the movie
shifts suddenly from vilifying ETS to
preaching the evils of drug use and cheat-

February 5, 2004

ing. The "it's not a fair system, but, hey, it's
our system" attitude the movie ends on is
especially dissatisfying when each character miraculously ends up at the college of
his or her choice. But perhaps it's comforting to realize that, as college students, we
are long past our slave-to-ETS days. We will
have to make due with casually dropping

our SAT scores into our friends' mailboxes
or the hands of tour groups. Or, if nothing
else, we can take comfort in Anna's touching epiphany about what the SAT stands
"Secretly A Tease."

A little bit country, a little bit rock 'n' roll
BY MELISSA PHRUKSCHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
Speed, chrome and Southern
California car culture? These
three things were integral to the
development of the country music
genre known as "honky-tonk" by
acting as status symbols of the
white middleclass, Dr. Peter
LaChapelle of Wilson College said
in his lecture "Honky-Tonking:
Migration, Marginalization and
Whiteness in Southern California
Country Music" last Friday.
"Country music is a fascinating thing to study," LaChapelle
said. "Despite the negative stereotypes, it tells us a lot about ourselves and our society and our
relationships with each other."
Though many northeastern
liberal Swatties might wonder,
"Who listens to country music
anymore?" the genre remains
quite popular in large segments of
the United States. Pockets of
honky-tonk and hillbilly music
fans still exist today. The hillbilly/rockabilly scene even experienced a small revival last year
(the first major one being in the
1980s withBrian Setzer's band the
Stray Cats), with Reverend
Horton Heat being the most wellknown current example. These
forms of music, however, identify
just as much with rock as with
country, for rockabilly is one of
the earliest forms of rock 'n' roll.
Today's modern country is light-

years away from the hepcat cool
of the '3os and '4os, its purity having been diluted over the years
for the same reason so many

other forms of music have been
diluted money.
LaChapelle explained the ori

Fraternities abuse animals throughout nation
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu

When was the last time you saw a pig at
a Swat frat party? Not the guy who parks by
the food table and stuffs himself on wings all
night, I mean a real, live, oinking pig. Not
recently, according to the frat members I
interviewed. But while Swarthmore fraternities are keeping their houses animal-free,

those at some other universities are not.
Twenty one members of Sigma Phi

Epsilon at Wake Forest University in North

Carolina were charged with animal abandonment after they brought a 200-pound hog
to a party, fed it beer, and then left it, drunk
and passed out, at a local park, according to
OGBOnline, the university's student newspaper. A similar incident involving another
intoxicated pig occurred at Clarkson
University in Massachusetts. Also in the
past few years, a puppy was killed at Quincy
University in Illinois, a goose at Davidson
College in North Carolina, and a cat at the
University of Rochester in upstate New
York. Some other events just make you
wonder. At the University of Georgia, for
instance, three Phi Kappa Psi brothers shot,
skinned and ate a raccoon. Is the food there
really that bad?
Swarthmore's fraternity members are

adamant that that kind of thing would
never happen here. "That isn't something
we'd accept," said Charlie Sussman 'O5,
president of Phi Psi. (Just for the record:
Phi Psi was once part of Phi Kappa Psi, the
raccoon-eating frat, but was expelled from
the national organization for admitting an
African-American member in the late '6o's,

10

before the national organization permitted

minorities.)
When asked what he thought about the
incidents, Tommy Coughlin of Delta
Upsilon responded, "It's pretty ridiculous.
What's nice about DU is that we don't have
to do stuff like that to have fun."
Zack Ellison 'O4 of Phi Psi laughed derisively when he heard about the incidents.
"We don't do anything weird, like at other

universities," he said.
Robert Buechner 'O5, a member of DU,
agreed. "Those people are idiots," he said.
One reason such incidents are less likely to occur at Swarthmore is that pledges go
through much kinder, gentler initiation

rites than at many other universities. DU,
which will be celebrating its 110th anniversary this year, is a strictly non-hazing
organization. "Our pledge activities are
based on brotherhood-building, where
pledges are working with each other," said
Chris Ciarleglio 'O4, current president and
two-time pledge master at DU. One major
no, no yoga involved
event is Reflection
where pledges spend a weekend together
in the lodge, studying for an exam on the
frat's history and working on the Pledge
Project. This is not to say that hazing-free
necessarily means alcohol-free; projects
from the past few years have included, in
addition to the D J table and a grill for their

courtyard, a new Beirut table for the lodge.
"Sometimes they'll play Beirut with their
we do a big brother-little
big brother
brother thing
and we'll have some tournaments," Ciarleglio said. The most popular event is Meet the Brothers, where stations are set up, each one with a different

activity for the pledges to do. "They're
always free to do whatever they want,"
Ciarleglio said. "They're never forced to do
anything The point is for them to become
a really close, cohesive group."
At Phi Psi, according to member Chris
Rose*'os, "it's pretty low-key. We don't do
the crazy hazing thing." "You're not really
forced to do anything," recent pledge Dillon
...

McGrew 'O7 said. "It was mostly drinking
games, but you didn't really have to drink."
Jacob Letendre 'O4, a former Phi Psi member, thought there really wasn't much initiation at all. "There's a lot of just hanging
out with the guys," he

February 5, 2004

says. "It's nothing

like the horror stories I've heard from other
universities. It was pretty light when I went
through it."

And while humane societies around the
countries call animal abuse a growing
trend, Swarthmore's frat members worry
that they're getting "a bad rap," as Rose put

it, for the stupidity and cruelty of a few

drunk guys in South Carolina. "Just
because a frat does that in Kentucky doesn't
mean all frats do that," Buechner said.
So the Swarthmore squirrel population
is safe for now. But who knows? If Sharpies
really starts to go downhill, there're always
raccoons.

Online networks
for elitist snobs
BY LILLIAN DUNN
ldunnl@swarthmore.edu
"Oh, that's elitist," was the reaction of Megan Bartges
'O5 when told about TheSquare, a networking service similar to the online community Friendster, but reserved solely for people who currently attend or have attended "the
world's top colleges and universities," according to the
service's Web site, thesquare.com. Bartges's reaction was
not unusual among those interviewed about TheSquare.
When entering the site, you are greeted by the smiling
faces of members who have posted their pictures, links to
chat rooms on topics from the conflict over Iraqi intelligence to football trivia, and an exhortation to "Join now to
network with TheSquare.com's other members. You can
find great jobs, meet your soulmate connect with old
friends, and so much more!" If, say, the photo of that particularly foxy Harvard grad in the cowboy hat catches your
eye, you have to become a member before you can read her
profile. And "only verified students and alumni of the following schools [a list of schools from Amherst to Yale] are
eligible for membership," the Web site reminds you. The
quickest way to join is to show the administrators that you
are currently using college e-mail at one of the universities
on the list; if you are already out of school and out of the college's e-mail system, you must fax them a college transcript.
Bob Sterling 'O7 found out about TheSquare from a
Princeton message board and signed up out of curiosity.
He said that while it appears to be a good resource when
applying for jobs, The Square is "snobby."
"I don't see the point in only allowing members from
certain schools to join," he said. "There are successful
people from all schools; there are smart people from all
sorts of schools. It's not like the top schools have a monopoly on anything, really."
Although he signed up, Sterling was somewhat put off
by its approach. "They don't trust you. I mean, you need
verification that you go to a good school," he said.
Such strict membership regulation, however, is a
sound financial strategy for TheSquare, according to an
interview in Internet News with founder and former CEO
James Marciano.
"Students and alumni from the top schools have the
advantage of being fewer in number (21 million potential
audience) with a strong affinity for each other, but representing a huge economic opportunity. As a group they
earn $273 billion a year and control $2.2 trillion in assets,"
Marciano said in the interview. "Rather than spend
$5O-$lOO million on a TV and print campaign, we're able
to rely instead on very focused marketing (leveraging the
school's built-in distribution channel and brand) to
acquire customers at a cost which is well below industry

Grannies around the world, stand up and take a bow.
You've gained my newfound respect. You see, it wasn't until
this past week that I realized knitters must be some of the
world's most talented people. Or, at least, I assume
they are. How else to
explain my inability to
form even two rows of
interconnected
loops,
despite training from
some of the most brilliant
young knitting minds at
Swarthmore?

ALEX LEADER-SMITH
The Prodigal Prodigy

It certainly wasn't for
lack of effort that the
Knit-wits failed to impart
to me their compulsive,

almost habitual, loop-

making ways. President

Lan Le 'O4 was hardly

able to contain her
enthusiasm when I asked
to be initiated into their cult of yarn and needle.
Scavenging up the appropriate supplies for my first project, she eagerly explained to me the philosophy of the knit-

ter, liberally doling out analogies to bolster my understanding. It's the same idea as
chain mail, she explained, loops
interwoven to form some great "We're
of
structure! It's just like asexual
communist
reproduction, she noted, a single
well-formed loop producing many
Rachel
identical brothers! What a shame,
I thought, that I hadn't taken biology since my first year of high school. Too bad, also, that
I'd declined that metal-weaving apprenticeship at Ye Olde
Jenkintowne Armory. I really would need to rely exclusively on Lan to teach me.
Thankfully, Lan was a rather talented knitting instructor. Unfortunately, I was a rather poor knitting student. It's
like the old saying goes: You can lead a horse to water, but
you can't make it drink. Knitting is a far more challenging
pursuit than drinking, and I, apparently, am far less dexterous than most horses. Lan would demonstrate the same
simple technique a half-dozen times, then I'd take the needles from her and freeze. I'd fiddle around, feign some sort

sort

other uniquely grotesque procedure on the poor ball of
yarn at my disposal.
Finally, she showed me an easier way to make my first
row of loops. "Casting on" she called it; "knitting for
morons" was my immediate assessment. In time, I mastered this basic technique. I made a row of loops! It was
ugly, twisted and somewhat lopsided, but it was mine. I was
like the four-year-old who'd dressed himself for the first
time: shirt inside-out, pants on backwards, but still a proud
smile on his face. Then I was told the bad news. Casting on?
It only worked for the first row of loops. After that, actual
knitting skills were required. Thus ended my dalliance
with knitting success.
Yet despite my frustration with the complicated knitting
process, I found the Knit-wits themselves to be quite engag-

ing. They were lively and talkative, merrily gossiping
about all sorts of topics as they worked diligently on their
sweaters, hats and scarves. Nor were their discussions private or exclusive; they took pains to make me feel welcome
in their group. Knit-wit treasurer Rachel Shorey 'O6
explained the group's blue-collar policy of acceptance.
"We're sort of an anarchist, communist organization," she
said. Still, I do feel the Knit-wits were inclusive beyond any
reasonable limit when they insisted on my appearance in
their yearbook photo. Now I'm blessed with knowing that,
even if I never pick up a needle
again, my hour of knitting exploits
will be saved in yearbook form for
all my descendants to view and
mock incessantly. ("You were in the
knitting club in college, Grandpa?"

Still, before I knew it, it was 5:30 on this Wednesday
afternoon, and this meeting, only 75 minutes old, was
scarf, white-board erasbreaking up. My great creation
er, who knows what?
would never be finished. For I
would not be returning to Knit-wits. For a second consecutive week, I'd stumbled into an activity rife with nice
Swattie folk but requiring skill beyond my capacity. Next
week, I told myself, I'll do something easier, some effortless
activity. It wouldn't be too much of a problem, I figured, ifI
never learned how to knit. After all, we'll always have the
grannies to deal with the hard stuff.

norms."

Marciano created The Square after starting Referan "affiliate-matching service" much like
TheSquare but for the business realm. His idea when
bringing The Square to the public was to make a place
where alumni had "the ability to network, for personal
and business reasons, with a group of people they feel
comfortable with," he said. "Twenty-five percent of our
members go to two of our target schools, so for example
Harvard undergrad and Dartmouth grad. That makes for
an incredibly close affinity group and a ridiculously effiit.com,

cient marketing strategy."
Lisa Gunaydin 'O7 said she saw the rationale for such
a Web site and didn't find it offensive.
"I don't think it's elitist. Sure, there could be creeps at
the top 40 colleges, just like there are everywhere else, but
it's probably less likely that you're talking to some 80year-old weirdo, because at least [members' college credentials] are verified," Gunaydin said.
However, others disagreed. Alan McAvinney 'O6 said
that he couldn't see a point to the site.
"I think Friendster is kind of silly, anyway, but a
Friendster for elite colleges is even more ridiculous,"
McAvinney said. "I just don't see a need or reason for
something like that, especially if it's excluding people."
Sterling said that mail from The Square has become
"junk mail, and I just haven't gotten around to un-signing
myself from their mailing list. I guess you could say that
not everyone should be able to join [an online community] for safety's sake, but elitism doesn't really seem the
way to go."

The Monolith, "Here Comes the Monolith"

(Fortune Records, 2004)
Come to think of it, pop is pretty monolithic. OK, actually, "pop" has been used to
describe so much diverse music that it's virtually meaningless, but I'm talking here
about something specific: pop in its "purest" form, like the musical equivalent of sunshine (and, as Lesley Gore adds, lollipops and rainbows) or one of those Miyazake
movies where nothing remotely bad ever happens. I would date its inception back to
the late 'sos and early '6os, the milieu of Brill-building songwriters such as Neil Sedaka
and Phil Spector-produced girl groups like the Crystals. Then came its refinement
(and arguable perfection) later in the decade by masters like Brian Wilson and the
Zombies; the work of janglers and power-popsters in the '7os and 'Bos (Big Star the
Raspberries Cheap Trick the Knack Squeeze Jellyfish, or something); and a reflowering in the mid-'9os with groups like the Beulah, Lilys, and the Apples in Stereo.
Through it aU, this kind of pop has maintained a dis'
tinct set of signifiers and a characteristic attitude
optimism, essentially. Curiously, since the post-Nirvana

fallout of "tortured" or "sensitive" guitar guys, and the

prevalent beat-basedness ofchartable happy music, pop
like this hasn't been all that popular, or at leastbest-selling, since the late 'Bos or so
but that's another story.
Here come the Monolith, a trio (with friends) from
sunny San Francisco, keying in squarely. Any of the
artists mentioned above would serve as an appropriate
reference point for their debut CD, which, if nothing
else, provides a magnanimous opportunity to play spotthe-influence (hey, dig that "And Your Bird Can Sing"
guitar work on "Dandelion Storm"). Not that they're
simply copyists. The boy-girl vocals, chiming chorus harmonies and unabashed melodicism that permeate the album may be oft-overplayed genre tropes, but this band
wields them with a remarkable authority and judiciousness.
Still, despite considerable internal experimentation and range, it's nigh impossible
to listen to "Here Comes" on its own terms, without thinking of its forebears. "Ruby,"
the disc's most psychedelic moment, is not, in fact, a
cover of the like-named Apples' classic, but it stops
ROSS HOFFMAN
just short. "Never Mind What You Heard" uncanniInnovation & Respect
ly emulates Elliott Smith. "10 x Infinity," the indelibly hooky better-be single which is sine qua non for
a^mmmmmmmmmm^^m
any self-respecting pop record, finds the group straying closest to Cars/Romantics crunchy New Wave territory. I doubt the Monolith
would resent this characterization much
originality clearly isn't their priority, and
there's nothing wrong with that
but it makes them a difficult band to assess, apart

from their undeniable competence.
What should one want, in 2004, from canonically minded purveyors of Melody,
Harmony and Rhythm? Perhaps we can consider this in strictly utilitarian terms: Just
like make-no-amends dance music, which is only worth as much as its ability to get
you on the floor, capital-p pop has a pretty specific purpose, and it's not hard to quantify its effectiveness. Considering the tenacity with which some of these tunes have
been coursing through my head this week, there's really no question: The stuffworks.
Dani Siciliano, "Likes

..."

(!K7, 2004)

This debut effort from the longtime collaborator (and wife) of German minimal
techno and micro-house producer Matthew Herbert is being billed as a singer-songwriter affair (or rather, a "song-based vocal album"). I don't think that will fool
many people. The record's first discernable vocal line
doesn't turn up until nearly three minutes into the
album. When it does, neither its minimal melodic gesturing nor its few, repetitive lyrics' capture much of
the listener's attention. By this point, Siciliano's
voice, clipped, fragmented and otherwise manipulated, has long since been established as the building
block and focal point of a deftly woven aural tapestry,
which builds over the course of nine minutes from
bleepy cocktail atmospherics reminiscent of early
Mouse on Mars to a gentle, disco-derived thump. On
this track ("Same"), as on the bulk of what follows,
Herbert's unmistakable sonic fingerprint is all over
the proceedings, with Siciliano's smoky, langorous
voice providing melodic punctuation and serving as a distinctive textural element
much as it does on the always intriguing albums of Herbert such as "Around the
but rarely overpowering the subtlety of the production as a whole.
House"
I don't mean to suggest, however, that her billing as primary artist here is unwarranted. Despite their frequent resonance with Herbert's production style, Siciliano
developed these pieces in her own studio and worked with several producers to flesh
them out. Besides, except for one inexplicable instrumental cut, the album is indeed an
excellent showcase for her remarkably evocative pipes, which fall somewhere on the
spectrum from Bjork to Shirley Bassey. Appropriately, amid considerable stylistic
from the punchy electro of "Walk theLine" to the Icelandic dreamery of "All
range
the Above"
the dominant textural reference point here is probably Bassey's noir-ish,
jazz-inflected lounge (as exemplified, interestingly, in a torchy rendition of Nirvana's
"Come as You Are"). This also makes sense, coming on the heels of Herbert's most
recent project, last year's fascinating "Goodbye Swingtime." Much as that project
explored the relationship between Herbert's trademark micro-electronic production
and 1930s big band jazz, "Likes ..." connects these dots with more vocal-centered song
forms. As such, both serve as ideal introductions to the Herbert style for folks looking
to branch out.

Jorg Immendorff's 'I Wanted to Become an Artist'
BY CLAIRE RUUD

cruudl@swarthmore.edu

Jorg Immendorff s playfully phantasmic
yet socially conscious work fills two small
galleries at Moore College in Philadelphia
this month. Immendorff s cartoony, actionpacked drawings and paintings animate
the galleries with vibrancy and dynamism.
The first gallery covers Immendorffs
career during the '6os and '7os, the second
the 'Bos up to the present. Many of his best
works in the exhibition are those from his
artist's books and sketchbooks, so don't
overlook the glass display cases. Also, be
sure to stop and look at the exhibition catalogs in the first gallery, because his oeuvre
is huge, and the curators of this show barely have room to scratch the surface.
This show is Immendorffs first solo
museum exhibition in the United States.
The German artist, born in Dusseldorf in
1945, grew up in a divided country suffering the aftermath of World War 11. Many
German artists of his generation struggle
with the same momentous issues that he
does, like human nature, social welfare,
political revolution and Germany's historical responsibility. While his well-known
peers Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polk
have taken a much more detached and
majestic approach to history, Immendorff
tackles the same serious issues head-on,
with devious wit and wily animation. The
curators, Robert Storr (our very own, class
of '72) and Pamela Kort, have organized the
exhibition to reflect three periods that dis-

tinguish Immendorffs career. The exhibition is heavy on theory
the wall text
comes in chunks four or five paragraphs
long. It is written more like a thickly condensed scholarly article than like the light
blurbs we are used to seeing on museum
walls to "explain" the art to us.

The first room covers his early and midcareer. His work in the '6os uses bright pri-

mary colors and cutesy images of babies,
flowers and animals. During this time,
Immendorffstudied stagecraft and then was
admitted into the class of the legendary
artist Josef Beuys at the Dusseldorf Art
Academy. There, he began a series of artistic
actions partially modeled after Dada called
"LIDL," a nonsense word based on the
sound of a baby's rattle. He built a miniature
"LIDL Akademie" out of paper and drew
designs for a "Lidlstadt" with a school, a
house for himself and a few houses for visitors. The curators portray Immendorff during this part of his career as a zealous, if
immature, anarchist fighting against both
social repression and elitist art.
The second section focuses on his work
during the '7os. Immendorff transferred his
allegiance to the Communist Party, and his
work became more and more politically
activist. I was particularly struck by the
series, "I Wanted to Become an Artist"
(1972), which chronicles his journey as an
artist and an activist up to that point. Each
panel combines a scene from his life with a
reflective but satirical caption. The series
reveals a man in his twenties, worried about
selling out and how he can make a difference in the world, two things that come up
in our conversations all the time. But my
favorite panel of the section was "Social
Action as a Pretext." In the painting,

"Anbetung des Inhalts" (Worship of Content),
Jorg Immendorff,

1985.

Immendorff is campaigning for "tenant soli-

darity" for the people living in cardboard
boxes on the street in Dusseldorf. In the cap-

tion, he talks about realizing that he was

involved in activism out of self-admiration
and not out of real solidarity with others.
Such activism is worthless and ineffective,
he said. "This will not change until one
begins to struggle, on a daily basis, against
one's own egoism and against the philosophy of egoism and profit," he said. "Social
Action as a Pretext" is a good example of the
self-interrogation he was enduring at the
time. His forthright style, political bent and
moralizing attitude give his work refreshing
directness. The curators suggested that this
phase ended as the artist realized his art had
crossed completely into the political realm.
The lighthearted playthings and unassuming doodles give way to grandiose narrative paintings in the second. This gallery
holds some of Immendorff s more recent
work, including four enormous canvases,
filled with chaotic hordes of people engaged
in all sorts of activities from lugging
around gigantic communist insignia to lesbian sexual encounters. The figures remain
cartoon-like and colorful, and the action is
worked up to a frenzy. Quickly receding
space pulls you in, and sharp diagonals jut
out at you. Immendorff wraps you in a
world of chaotic caricatures and archetypes. Through these canvases, he claims a
newly authoritative artistic persona.
The curators set up this last phase as the
culmination of Immendorff s artistic journey. As an artist, they suggest, he can
rewrite history both to create a place for
himself and to open up opportunities for
dialogue. His paintings certainly take liber-

ties with history, combining political and

artistic figures in places they never were.
From the few examples in the exhibition, it
is hard to tell whether Immendorff s project
has become too self-important to be really
politically and socially radical.
Storr and Kort are interested in
Immendorffs earlier works as a precursor
to his art today. The exhibition presents the
infancy, adolescence and adulthood of a
developing artist. The curators think he
matured by recognizing that anti-elitist art
is ineffective. Now his more gripping theatrical work interests a broader audience.
However, who's to say he hasn't just sold
out? His earlier art is far less impressive,
but it cherishes hope for social change and
strives to be effective.

Squeaky wheels
All of us who work in journalism, even at the level
of the small liberal arts college student paper, were
upset by the Jayson Blair scandal last year. The only
thing a newspaper has to trade on is the trust readers
put in its staff to deliver information they need to
know honestly and completely. It takes years for hardworking reporters and editors to build this trust, while
one dishonest or incompetent reporter can wreck it

with a single major mistake.
Unfortunately, in our cynical age, this trust is fragile for many people. This doesn't just apply to our line
of work; most institutions have lost credibility in our
times. This particularly applies to us critical-thinking
junkies of academia; Swarthmore skepticism seems to
flourish about the competence or the motives of everyone from the administration and Student Council to
Sharpies Dining Hall and, of course, us at The
Phoenix.
The most shocking and disheartening thing for
those of us emotionally invested in the press as a social
institution is the reason no one called out Jayson Blair
for his lies, even those he directly misrepresented. It
turns out many of his misquoted sources had the
impression that such inaccuracies were common to
newspapers. They groused to their friends, but thought
there was no point in protesting to their editors.
Despite the common tendency to assume the worst
about sensationalistic, attention-seeking yellow journalism, most journalists are well-intentioned, hardworking, intelligent people who get 99 things right out
of 100 things that can go wrong. This is particularly
true of small organizations like The Phoenix, where
there is no profit motive, only a desire to participate in
the campus community.
That one mistake that slips through the cracks,
however, always affects somebody, and every time

someone feels misrepresented, manipulated or let
down by a news story, we lose a bit of the trust we
work hard to preserve.
Our policy is always to print visible corrections for
any factual errors reported to us and to print any letters we can that provide perspectives on events different from our own editorial bias. It is therefore disturbing to us when we hear about complaints about
Phoenix coverage indirectly, through the rumor mill.
One of the primary reasons our publication exists
is to promote the self-improvement of our campus
institutions through open propagation of information
and debate over grievances. The same ideal we feel

should apply to other organizations applies to our own.

We're committed to telling the truth about what we see
on campus, and we hope the campus will be commited
to telling us the truth about what they see in our paper.

This bill may seem innocent on the

wording of the law is vague. This
makes it very vulnerable to misinterpretation and would allow large companies to use intimidation tactics to
stifle even fair use of a copyrighted
database (Diebold, anyone?) due to
the legal costs involved in a court

Here's an argument one of my

logic behind this copyrighting of

"Why would anyone make a database (or whatever), if anyone could

Shouldn't things like the boiling

point of cesium be protected from

The point is, who cares whether or
not information is discovered if access
to it is so restricted that it does no one

Manly Democrats
According to an article in The
Nation entitled "Butching Up for
Victory," as well as a horde of
recent press about the presidential
candidates, the secret to winning
this year's election is all about the
size of your figurative balls.
Citing the 9/11-induced "crisis
of masculinity"
how many
times must we restate that brilliant analogy between the Twin
Towers and penises?
Richard
Goldstein of The Nation claims
that, if the Democrats stand a
chance of winning, they've got to
snag the ideal candidate: an "alpha
male." No bleeding hearts allowed.

The man for the job is more likely

steak. Arrrrrrr.
For a while, it looked like former Gov. Howard Dean fit the
bill: He had the rolled-up shirtsleeves, the angry talk about Iraq,
the pickup-truck appeal. As London Telegraph columnist Mark
Steyn noted in December, Dean always looks "as if his head's
about to explode out of his shirt collar." Nothing says power like
a neck eruption.
But Sen. John Kerry pulled ahead. Commentators on his
recent wins cite his war-hero image; in The Village Voice,
Goldstein calls it his "masculine mystique," and the LA. Weekly
comments on Kerry's new aura of manly "savage indignation."
The dude's blog calls on every American to be a "Citizen
Soldier." And a week before New Hampshire, Kerry was broadcast on national television playing hockey. Hmm.
But why is butchness so key?
Goldstein says we need a super-macho candidate because we
want to feel "safe." Americans apparently want a tough
dad-type with a fist of iron and a big stick. Personally, brass
knuckles and sticks have never made me feel particularly
secure. But most of the candidates have given the image a shot.
Gen. Wesley Clark flaunts his military experience; Kerry
flaunts his Harley-Davidson. According to a survey by The Hill
on the relative manliness of the nine candidates, the Rev. Al
Sharpton's street-smart, "hustler" 'tude means he's still got a

shot.

What's more, the Dem dudes' lack of masculinity can be a
serious detriment, emerging in many a critical article. My
favorite is a piece on IntellectualConservative.com, which scoffs
at Sen. John Edwards' alleged use of cosmetics, Clark's girly
habit of "waffling" on issues and, especially, Kerry's "dainty eating when confronted with a Philly cheesesteak." Sharpton's
hairstyle is the butt of every joke from here to lowa City.
Columnist Steyn of Free Republic giggles at Rep. Dennis
Kucinich's "milksop" pacifism and suggests he might go over
better with the electorate if he had a girlfriend on his arm and a
few more inches on the tape measure (height-wise, that is).
And face it: Dean was everyone's pick until he emasculated
himself with his "primal scream." ("Only women and Howard
Dean
scream," Goldstein clucks.)
If it were simply an image thing, it would be annoying but
ignorable. I don't really care where Howard Dean's shirtsleeves
end. But the macho ideal also seems to have seeped into policy

positions.

Media lounge returning better than ever

Jan. 29, pg. 17) on the delayed reopening of the SCCS Media Lounge, The

First, the media lounge will not
remain closed all spring, as the first
paragraph of the article states.
Rather, it will open as soon as it is
technically feasible to open, within
two weeks of the completion of the
first phase of wiring.
Secondly, the media lounge is
hardly the "dead space" that the editorial portrays it to be. Last year, students did homework, wrote papers

For Dean (who might otherwise have been my favorite candidate), this means cultivating NRA support and backing down
on any kind of national gun-control legislation, even though
handguns continue to top lists of U.S. homicide and suicide
methods. It means professing limited support for the death
penalty, as if the only way to be "tough" on criminals is to, um,
kill them. It means a loosening of Dean's original enthusiasm
for civil union legislation and an un-endorsement of the federal
legalization of gay marriage.
Dean's manly-man image is supposed to make us feel secure.
But guns don't equal safety. Backing down from out-of-the-mainstream positions doesn't equal strength.
According to Kerry's Web site, he plans to step up security by
pumping up the National Guard and funneling already-tight
funds into first defenders. Abroad, he advocates a "bold" return
to "military might." Okay, Mr. Man, you're no softie. But you do

sound a lot like President Bush.

At this point, I'm considering forgetting all the wannabe
butchies and writing in a candidate I really believe in: my Mom.
She's modest, pro-gun-control, anti-war and economically savvy,
and I don't doubt her commitment to "safety." (She has managed
to keep me, the most accident-prone person in the universe,
alive all these years.) Too bad she's voting for Kerry.

It was a sci-fi thriller if ever
there was one.
A team of computer scientists
and programmers convened in
Maryland with a mission: hack
into six high-security government computer systems. They

had one week to plan and execute their mission. The future of
a nation depended on their
actions.
That was two weeks ago. The
'

EVAN HENSLEIGH
Technological Misfit
—mm

team members not only hacked
into the computers, they were
able to do whatever they wanted.
One of them, William Arbaugh,
went so far as to say, "I was really surprised with the totality of
the [security flaws] we found.

Just about everywhere we
looked, we found them."
If you're not already aware, what I'm referring to is a security review conducted by the State of Maryland of
you guessed
it electronic voting machines, manufactured by Diebold.
They found that the Rubin report, an analysis issued this
summer condemning security flaws in Diebold's voting software, was almost entirely accurate. The team had no trouble
changing ballots, changing votes or altering the vote count as it
was transmitted to the voting center.
The report estimated that, for a mere $750, a person of reasonable competence could create an administrative-level access
card prior to the election, at which point it was easy to shut
down the machine, clear the vote counts or cast multiple votes.
The team was able to guess the access password, which has also
been released on the Internet and is hard-coded into the software used on all voting machines.
Access to the terminal comes through a memory card slot or
a keyboard jack, both of which are covered and locked during
the election. However, each lock was identical, and any of 32,000
keys produced could open the lock. Furthermore, one member of
the team picked the lock in "approximately 10 seconds," and the
team determined that an experienced locksmith could get the
lock open unnoticed in an election. Once open, tampering with
the memory card allows major changes to the election, and connecting a keyboard gave the user administrative access to the
terminal without an access card. And that's just the tip of the
iceberg.
These flaws are, to say the least, inexcusable. A few quick
fixes were recommended to make the machines reasonably safe
for the March primary. Ultimately, however, the report advocated a major overhaul of the system's security features before
November; most importantly, the team insisted that the
machines leave a backup paper trail.

Diebold inexplicably issued a self-congratulatory press
release declaring the report a "validation" of its current security

measures, but the Maryland report makes it clear that electronic voting, as it exists now in the United States, cannot be expected to reflect the will of the voter. The results of an election decided by such machines cannot and should not be considered valid.
Diebold's voting systems are failures in every important
respect. A new system must be designed, and I suggest the following criteria be met to make a safe, secure electronic voting
machine capable of being used in a valid election:
First, voting terminals should be slave machines.
Administrative access to them should only be available from a
central computer, constantly monitored by an election official.
Second, each machine must leave a paper trail, with every
vote given an anonymous serial number. A foreign card brought
into the system would have the wrong (or, at least, a duplicate)
serial number and be properly invalidated.
Third, the votes should be encrypted at all points in the software. One key flaw the study found was that the vote counts
were never encrypted, which made altering them as they were
transmitted exceptionally easy.
Fourth, an entirely different operating system should be
used. Windows and its security flaws are too well known; one of
the team's findings was that they were able to break into the system using the same hole that the Blaster worm exploited. A tailored form of Unix would be a likely candidate.
Until these conditions can be met, and such a system can
thwart a rigorous security attack, the results of such elections
should not be respected. We, as voters, deserve better.

of

my

excitement

turned to disappointment with a number of
social initiatives that

seem both ineffective and unnecessary.
I was pleased with the State of the Union address,
for the most part. The president's desire for Congress
to renew the PATRIOT Act is a crucial step to maintaining the War on Terror. Domestically, President
Bush's plan to allow formerly illegal workers to work
legally in the United States is a bold manifestation of
the ideals and values upon which this nation was
founded. Training programs for Americans whose
jobs have been lost overseas and reintegration programs for newly released prisoners are positive steps
to ensuring Americans every opportunity for success.
These and other initiatives are critical to the future of
the United States and its prosperity.
There were, however, proposals in the State of the
Union address that cannot possibly be effective or
worthwhile. First among these is the president's proposal to increase funding for the drug testing of students in public schools. The fact that the president
seeks to decrease adolescent drug use is laudable. It is
not the business of public schools, however, to monitor the behavior of individual students outside of the
classroom. This is not to say that schools ought not
seek to influence that behavior. Education as to the
dangers of drugs, in vivid, gory detail, could be a far
more effective deterrent for young people. For schools
to police and punish drug use, especially with consequences that could be detrimental to the lives of casuFebruary 5, 2004

al drug users who are otherwise good students, is an
overstepping of their authority and an infringement
on the rights of students.
A second contentious proposal in the address was
the increasing of funds to promote abstinence education in schools. This proposal goes beyond wishful
thinking. Young people do not have sex because they
have not been taught to abstain. Young people have
sex because of their raging hormones. Abstinence
should be taught in schools as the only completely
effective method of preventing pregnancy and STDs.
Given the reality, however, that adolescents will continue to have sex, it is foolish to ignore other types of
sexual education just because abstinence is a preferable alternative. A plan that promotes abstinence but
also actively educates students on minimizing the
associated risks if they do choose to have sex would be
a far more practical, effective proposal.
The last point was perhaps the most flawed stance
in the president's speech. While not directly opposing
gay marriage, President Bush made clear his opposition to state courts' challenging federal rulings on the
issue, coming within a few steps of outwardly opposing homosexual marriage itself. For the president to
devote a portion of the State of the Union to arguing
against a liberty that has been evolving for decades is
a foolish attempt to delay the inevitable. This country
was founded on the principle that the law would
progress
with the advancement of society.
Notwithstanding the Bush administration, homosexuals are enjoying unprecedented freedoms. Not only
would it be wise for the executive branch to adapt to
this reality, but it could also jump at the opportunity
to muster support from a group that has traditionally
voted against the Republican candidate.
President Bush has been a valiant, effective leader
on the whole. His stance on foreign policy has been
crucial for the country during the events of the last
three years. Yet while domestically he has demonstrated many positive initiatives, there still remain
certain aspects of his policies that make too great an
attempt to legislate morality. While the president's
valor and foresight have guided the creation of many
effective policies, it would be best if more personal
values would remain solely personal.

Bullets wound Garnet Tide
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

The men's swimming team fell to the
Gettysburg Bullets on Saturday 72-133, dropping
to 3-5 on the season and 2-2 in the Centennial

Conference with the loss.
But the Garnet Tide were able to pull out a
victory in the first event of the day, the 400-yard
medley relay, as well as represent the top three
finishers of the 200-yard breaststroke. The Tide
did not manage to put together anything else

after that, allowing Gettysburg to easily slide by
and build a significant lead that ended with a
Bullet triumph. "Gettysburg did not swim well
at all. We had a chance, but we did not capitalize
on it," Head Coach Sue Davis said. "Both
Gettysburg and we were in the same position of
the season, since Gettysburg's training trip was
at same time. We knew it was going to be a tough
meet regardless, but Gettysburg is beatable, and
we didn't let ourselves beat them."
Despite the disappointment, Davis pointed
out some notable individual performances at the
Gettysburg meet. Darshan Patel 'O5, Ben Morgan
'O5 and Jonathan Augat 'O7 achieved season-best
times. Eric Shang 'O4 managed to swim season
and career-best times for this part of the season,
including his win in the 200-yard breaststroke,
which was the only individual Garnet victory of
the day.
Andrew Koczo 'O7, Michael Auerbach 'O5,
Jason Horwitz 'O7 and Anders Taylor 'O7 combined in the 400-yard medley relay for a time of
3:4618, beating Gettysburg's medley relay team
by .12 sec. Also, Shang finished first in the 200-

yard breaststroke with a time of 2:19.02. Brian
Rose 'O6 came in second (2:27.41) and Rob
McKeon 'O7 came third (2:28.00). Although the
meet against Gettysburg counts as a team loss,
Taylor admitted that the competition can be
helpful for the swimmers to achieve better times
in preparation for the conference championship
meets that are coming up. "For me, it's better to

swim against faster people because it helps me
improve my times," Taylor said. "Individually, I
think it is important for us to get experience racing faster swimmers. Right now, I believe we're
on track for conferences. I think the taper will go
well, so that our muscles will recover, and we
can swim faster in the last meets of the season."
Rose commented on the loss, the taper and

the preparation for conferences. "The performances from people on our team were pretty
inconsistent with each other; some swam well,
others did not," he said. "I think that signifies
that some are more rested than others, but hopefully, we'll all be tapered and rested for the con-

ference championships."

"These last three meets, Franklin and
Marshall, Gettysburg and Dickinson, are the
toughest conference meets," Davis said. She then
commented on the team's preparation for the
conference championship meet, which will take
place at Franklin and Marshall Feb. 20-22. "I
think the conference meet will be very interesting. My goal is that everybody has good swim.
Each dual meet is preparation for swims at the
conference, and I think our men are trying overall. I just hope we all hit 100 percent when we get
to the conference meet."
The men compete next at Dickinson Feb. 7.

Women's swimming iced by the 'Burg
BY COLTON BANGS

cbangsl@swarthmore.edu

After jumping off to a great start,
women's swimming (6-2, 3-2) fell to
Gettysburg in a Centennial Conference
showdown Saturday, 72-133. The dual meet
opened with a victory for Martyna
Pospieszalska 'O6, Michele Horn 'O7, Katie
Schmidt 'O7, and Melanie Johncilla 'O5, in
the 400-yard medley relay, with a time of
4:12.65. From there the Tide was lost at sea,
with Schmidt picking up the only other win
with a 26 second time in the 50-yard
freestyle.

"Gettysburg didn't swim the greatest
meet in the world. Yes they are a very good
team, but so are we," Coach Sue Davis
said. "We had a great win in the 400 medley relay, and then it started downhill.

They sent their distance swimmers out to

get us and they did."
Co-captain Leah Davis 'O4 was careful to
point out, however, that the meet was much

closer than the score indicates. "Contrary to
the score, it was a really good meet. The
score was very misleading because we were
coming in tenths of seconds and even hun-

dredths of seconds behind the Gettysburg
swimmers," Davis said.
Coach Davis also remarked on this point:
"The score, while it looks horrendous, doesn't reflect the number of races where we just
got touched out. In the freestyle relay
less
than half a tenth of a second; the breastroke
8 tenths of a second. What that says to us
is that we better start getting a little sharper and start attending to the details of races
turns and finishes."
Coach Davis also thought that despite
being so deep in the season, the team put
forth a strong effort in the loss: "We are

sore, we are starting to rest, and that effects
different people in different ways. In some
cases we could have swam better and in
some cases we swam as hard as we could
and didn't get anywhere. Overall a couple
things didn't go our way but we really tried
hard. That's a little bit part and parcel of
where we are in the season. But if
Gettysburg can come in here and swim they
way they did, then we should be able to do
the same." Swarthmore has never beaten
Gettysburg in women's swimming.
Despite the loss, however, Captain Leah
Davis is confident in the Tide's chances at
conferences in three weeks. She points to
the end of the season as the time when the
team tends to perform better and to methods
of shaving and tapering to achieve maximum swimming efficiency that should
favor the Tide.
Co-captain Meredith Leigh 'O4 seconds

this confidence, saying: "We are really well
positioned. We will have full teams for both

Coach Davis sees the greatest competition in F&M, Gettysburg and Dickinson

swimmers."
The Tide travel to Dickinson on
Saturday to face off at 1 p.m. "Dickinson is
going to be just as hard as Gettysburg. Our
last three dual meets are probably the
three hardest of the season. I am hoping to
be a little sharper about things on
Saturday, but it is going to be tough," said
Coach Davis.
Leigh looks to the Dickinson meet as a
definite challenge for the Tide: "They are
going to be really tough. I hope our team
goes into it thinking that."

Men's basketball overwhelmed by F&M Dips
Diplomats punish Tide 97-54; team still alive in playoff race for conference title
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's basketball team faltered last weekend
against Centennial Conference leaders Franklin and
Marshall. They lost to the Diplomats 97-54, who remain
unbeaten in Centennial Conference play. Swarthmore
fell to 8-10 on the season and 5-6 in conference play. The
Tide also played conference foe and second place Johns
Hopkins (12-5, 8-3 CC) last Wednesday, but the results
were unavailable at press time.
Saturday, Swarthmore was overwhelmed by a superior F&M squad, as the Diplomats jumped out to an early
25-3 lead over the Tide and never looked back, heading
into halftime with a 50-18 lead and control of the game.
"They're a top-15 team, and they came out wanting to
prove they could dominate anyone in the league," Dillon
McGrew 'O7 said. "We didn't come out sharp, and they
just came ready to play."
Matt Gustafson 'O5 and Jim Dalton 'O6 led the Garnet
in scoring against F&M, pitching in 13 apiece in the losing effort. Despite their effort, it was the Diplomats' 62.3
percent shooting percentage from the floor, including a
64.3 percent mark from behind the arc, which was the
ultimate difference in the game.
"We just didn't make any shots, and they made everything," Coach Lee Wimberly said. "We just got killed, and
they were very good. We'd have to play our best to even
be competitive with a team like that, and we
didn't."
Swarthmore also played Johns Hopkins this
Wednesday. The results were not available at press time.
The Hopkins game also poses important playoff impli-

cations for the Garnet Tide. They are still alive for the
final playoff berth with seven games left to play.
"I'd like to think we have seven games left and seven
that we could win or lose," Wimberly said. "We played
Hopkins tough last time, and they're another very good

"I'd like to think we have seven
games left, and seven that we could
win or lose we're capable of
playing with all seven left on our
schedule, and if we can manage to
win, we'll have a shot to make
it to playoffs."

team. But we're capable of playing with all seven left on
our schedule, and, if we can manage to win, we'll have a
shot to make it to playoffs."
The Tide also downed conference foe and perennial
rival Haverford last Wednesday at Haverford, defeating
the Fords 74-70 on the strength of their bench. The Tide
avenged last year's end-of-the-season loss, a defeat that
put the team out of playoff contention. The game included sensational efforts from McGrew, Marc Rohde 'O7 and

Jim Dalton 'O6.

"Basically, Dillon McGrew, Jim Dalton and

Marc

Rohde all played sensationally," Chris Casey 'O7 said.
"Especially in the first half, they all came out and played
real well, and it was key for us, because Haverford
played real good defense on Matt Gustafson."
The battle between Haverford and Swarthmore featured 13 ties and lead changes. The outcome of the game
was in serious doubt until the Tide went on a 13-6 run
with just over six minutes left to play. They then settled
in to hit their free throws down the stretch, capping the
game with free throws from Dalton and team captain
Chris Loeffler 'O4.
Wimbery was impressed with this year's rivalry
showing. "It was one of the best-played HaverfordSwarthmore games I've seen," Wimberly said. "It was a
statistically close game the whole way, and we just got
the breaks in what was a tight game."
Swarthmore will also face a tough Dickinson squad
this Saturday at Dickinson. The team looks to force a
split with the Red Devils, having lost to them at home
earlier in the year, 70-64.
"They played great last time we played them,"
Wimberly said. "They haven't won many, but we don't
match up real well against them, and they are going to be
tough to play on the road, so we'll see. This is very much
one of those years where there is not a game we can't win
coming down the stretch, but we could also lose them all,
too."
The Tide faces conference foe Muhlenberg (6-12, 4-7
CC) away next Wednesday, followed by McDaniel (6-12, 38 CC) the following Saturday at Tarble Pavilion. These
are must-win games if the team hopes to make the playoffs and a run for the conference championship for the
first time since 1997.

Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
Tournament. They also hosted their
first team match of the season, sweeping Albright College 5-0.
Weather has been a frustrating
factor early in the season, with three
matches this month postponed or canceled by the snow. Players had to
shake off the rust for their first competition all season Saturday at Bryn
Mawr.
The PAIAW Tournament, which is
considered Swarthmore's conference
tournament for badminton, was open
only to singles players this year
because of conference restructuring.
Due to the changes, there was no
ranking or placing
of teams.
However, all three Garnet players
that entered (Surbhi Gupta 'O4,
Jessica Larson 'O6 and Laurel
Beesemyer 'O4)

advanced to the semi-

finals of the tournament.
The doubles teams got a chance to
compete later that afternoon in the
Main Line Invite, which had been
rescheduled from early December.
But the team performed poorly over-

Loomis said.
Larson, the team's co-captain, was
optimistic
after
the
PAIAW
Tournament results. The Garnet
appear ready to build on last year's
solid finish. "We only lost one singles
player, and we've gained three really
talented players with previous experience," she said.

On Tuesday night, coming off only

two days' rest, the Tide made quick
work of the Albright Lions. In the singles matches, the senior trifecta of
Beesemyer, Gupta and Ay Jy Phoun
all easily defeated their opponents,
although top singles player Gupta
survived a tough first game to win
her match against rival Nicole Huber
11-7, 11-3.

Beesemeyer and Phoun had an
easier time emerging victorious, winning 11-4, 11-1 and 11-3,11-0.
The doubles matches provided a
little more excitement, including a
three-game match in which Larson
and Liz Leininger 'O4 prevailed 15-8,
13-15, 15-7. In the second match, the
team of Anjali Aggarwal 'O6 and
Candice Cherk 'O7 breezed to a 15-0,
15-3 victory.
Despite being the first team competition all season, Gupta thought the
team got off to a good start.
"We played a pretty big opponent
and did really well in that match,"
she said.
But the team won't have much
time to celebrate Tuesday's win with
a home match against rival Bryn
Mawr today. The Owls, one of the
toughest teams in the region, beat
Swarthmore in both of their meetings
last year.

"They're one of the toughest teams
to beat," Coach Loomis said. "They
have strong players all the way up

and down the lineup, but we're playing pretty well, so I think we have a
chance."
After the Tide face Bryn Mawr,
they will be hosting the Northeast
Collegiate Regional Tournament Feb.

In short, hockey i

sometimes we all need t
go away. The question is
what's hockey going t

look like when it come
back? The answer: a lo
lighter. As many as eigh
of the 30 teams may be contracted upon hockey's return
And if you thought hockey had no fan base now, what d
you think is going to happen after a year in which ther
is no hockey? Some of the rituals surrounding th
Stanley Cup are downright religious in nature. If nex
season becomes known as "The Year They Canceled Th
Cup," we wouldn't be surprised if some of hockey's faith
ful turn apostate.
To be honest, though, we wouldn't mind if hockey los
a little weight, franchise-wise. In 1993, the NHL only hat
24 teams, including ones in Quebec, Hartford an
Winnipeg. Today's NHL is 25 percent bigger, with team

in such glorious hockey areas as Phoenix, Nashville an

Carolina. If it were up to us, we wouldn't mind takin
hockey back to how it was in 1974. Eighteen team
(including ones named the Scouts and the Seals), a heav
Northeast bias, and old-school sweaters. Our Capital
could go back to wearing red, white and blue, and the fac
that they had 16 wins at the all-star break would have th
owner hugging fans instead of strangling them.
What needs to be said, though, is that hockey needs t
reinvent both its product and its business model. Firs
off, it needs to forget TV. Hockey and TV are never goin
to mix right. ABC is showing a whopping five hocke
games this season. Five! The Chevy Chase show did be
ter than that. So how does hockey survive without TV
They look at the one American professional sport tha

baseball. This is not to say that the NHL should becom

is that hockey needs to drastically cut salary, then dras
