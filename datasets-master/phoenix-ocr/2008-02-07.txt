Following the trail of Swarthmore's trash
Swarthmore" report produced by students in the Spring

BY SARAH PETERSON

2007

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

Environmental

According

According to the Environmental Protection Agency,
"the average American will throw away 600 times his or
her adult weight in garbage" over the course of a lifetime. Given the average lifespan of an American, that's
about 30 times your body weight just over the course of
four years in college.
Where does all this trash go? What happens to it? The
story of your trash and recycling doesn't end at the trash
can, of course; that's just where this story starts.
According to Associate Vice President of Facilities
Stu Hain, most offices on campus are outfitted by the college with two waste bins
one for paper, and one for
trash. For other various recyclable materials
aluminum, glass, plastic
there are also bins in most hallways.
In dorms, the situation is similar
beyond whatever
depositories students have in their rooms, each hall has
two trash cans and a paper waste bin, as well as a recycling bin.
Grounds and Environmental Services oversee the regular removal of waste and recycling from the buildings
and transportation to the dumpsters located behind
buildings all across the campus. Each dumpster is not
necessarily emptied every day, so a single dumpster may
contain layers holding multiple days of trash before they

are removed after 7 a.m. on pickup days.
The dumpsters, however, are not college-owned. They
belong to the college's rubbish removal contractor, Jack
Clark & Sons Inc., who have been taking care of the college's garbage and recycling for 32 years. By the estimates of Jack Clark himself, the company has about 50
dumpsters total on Swarthmore's campus. They also own
the compactor located behind Sharpies.
Fifty dumpsters is a lot, especially with the added consideration that Jack Clark & Sons sends their trucks to
empty dumpsters on campus six days a week.
However, not all of the dumpsters, and not every set of
materials, gets picked up each of the six days, Clark said.
While garbage is taken from campus on a daily basis, different recycling materials are picked up according to different days of the week and taken to various recycling
sites across the region.
The college started recycling in the mid-1990s with the
support of Earthlust, according to a "Greening of

Studies Capstone Seminar.
to Director of Grounds Jeff Jabco, the college

currently recycles 19 different goods, which the report
estimates as costing the college a total of ten to twelve

thousand dollars a year.

"There's a tonnage of trash that has
to go through for [Covanta] not to lose
money a few years ago, the Chester
mayor went to Philadelphia and
asked them to give them their trash."
Yaeir Heber 'll
Earthlust Member
-

These materials range from antifreeze to the more
familiar categories of mixed paper and commingled
materials. Noting a recent decline in the amount of com-

mon materials being recycled, Jabco provided The

Phoenix with recycling figures from 2007 that were not
yet published.
In 2005, the college recycled 36.25 tons of commingled

meaning glass, plastic, aluminum, and
materials
bimetallic. In 2006, this amount decreased to 34.75 tons.
And last year, the college only recycled 32.75 tons.
"We've gOne down two tons every year," Jabco said.
In paper, the figures follow a similar pattern. In 2005,
67.02 tons of paper were recycled. In 2006, that number
went down to 63.04 tons, and decreased again in 2007 with
61 tons recycled.

It's doesn't seem likely that these figures are the
result of less consumption in the community, but rather

that they indicate less and less consistent recycling
habits. "Some students are more conscientious of recy-

cling in the dorms than in other places," Hain said.
While the college is able to have its recycled goods
weighed, it is so far impossible to know the figures for
how much garbage is carted away on a yearly basis. "The
problem is, when he picks up ours, he picks up others'
too," Jabco said, referring to Clark's company. After

picking up trash on Swarthmore's campus, the
Springfield-based contractor's trucks go to other client
sites before getting weighed. Consequently, it's impossible to know how much Swarthmore is contributing to the

load.
Jabco said that it would be possible to get these figures
and perhaps necessary at some point
but to do
so would involve rerouting the trucks out of their way,
and burning excess fuel in the process. "How sustainable
do you want to be?" he said, explaining the tradeoff.
The contractor's trucks eventually take Swarthmore's
trash into nearby Chester, to the incinerator owned by
Covanta Energy. Formerly known as the Westinghouse
Incinerator, the trash-to-steam incinerator is the largest
of six incinerators across the state of Pennsylvania and
the 7th largest in the entire country. It burns 2,688 tons
of unsorted trash each day, according to Mike Ewall,
founder and director of Action PA and Environmental
Justice Network.
Ewall has also worked with student activists, including Earthlust.
"There's a tonnage of trash that has to go through for
[Covanta] not to lose money
a few years ago the
Chester mayor went to Philadelphia and asked them to
give them their trash," Yaeir Heber 'll said. Heber is a
member of Earthlust, involved in the group's environmental justice initiative and also a part of the DelCo

Alliance for Environmental Justice. The alliance is a
recently-formed group.
To stay in operation, the incinerator takes waste not
only from Delaware County and surrounding areas, but
also from Philadelphia, New York and New Jersey. The
incinerator is not the only waste treatment facility in
Chester
other facilities, some now closed, handle
wastewater and medical waste
but even alone its
impact would still be felt.
Before the waste even reaches the incinerator, Ewall
said, nearby residents are plagued with "trucks going
odors, noise, diesel emissions
downresidential streets
[this] impacts health pretty directly."
Other emissions, Ewall explained, include dioxin,
mercury, arsenic and lead. Having these pollutants in
the air "affects people's health and their ability to think,
to learn." They can also cause miscarriages and birth
defects.

Spring LSE in the works to follow costly but successful 'Roots'
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

Though we may be mere weeks into the
spring semester, the Large Scale Events
Committee has already begun planning
this semester's event. According to committee member

Alvin Melathe 'lO, who

spoke before the LSE Committee officially
decided not to comment on next semester's planning, the group has already
brainstormed potential acts to bring to
campus.
"We have a lot of different ideas, both
musical and non-musical," Melathe said.
According to Melathe, when tossing
around ideas, the committee greatly considers both the student survey that was
administered earlier this school year as
well as their own personal opinions.
"We like to think we are representative
of the rest of campus. We're a pretty
diverse group," Melathe said.
This semester, the committee faces a
financial challenge as a large majority of
its funding was spent on last semester's

act.
The committee's funds, which come
from the President's Office, are given on a
yearly basis. Therefore, it is up to the committee's discretion to decide how to split

THE PHOENIX

the money between the two semesters.
According to Melathe and an LSE member who wished to remain anonymous to
adhere to the committee's guidelines that
members not discuss funding, last semester's LSE, The Roots, cost more than half
of the yearly budget. Vice President for
College and Community
Relations

Maurice Eldridge '6l further detailed the

committee's budget situation.
"The annual amount is $lOO,OOO. About
80 percent of it was spent on the fall
semester this time around," Eldridge said
in an e-mail.
Melathe attributed the high cost to The
Roots' high profile and large size and to
the fact that they were booked lastminute. The Roots were contacted after

other ideas fell through.
"There were a number of bands who we
were in talks with, but eventually we got
kind of screwed over by some of them,
although not in an extreme sense. We
were coming down to the wire and we had
a month or so and had verbal agreements,
but the groups backed out of the contracts," the LSE member who wished to
remain anonymous said.
According to Melathe, despite spending
a significant portion of the budget on The
Roots, there should still be enough money

to carry out a successful LSE this semester.
"The money has definitely been a concern, and it's definitely had an impact on
the range of options we have. However,
the quality of the act should not be significantly affected," Melathe said. "The more
money the better, obviously, but the difference isn't that big when looking at
[small and medium] acts."
Melathe explained that, although the
budget is not large enough to get big name
acts, the committee's shrunken coffer is
still adequate for small and medium name
acts.
"The difference between $50,000 and
$30,000 isn't that big. It's not like we're
going to get the Red Hot Chili Peppers anyways, so the quality of the act [for this
semester] is not significantly affected,"
Melathe said.
The anonymous source also stressed
the thought that the committee put into
selecting The Roots.
"We definitely took the amount of
money that The Roots cost into consideration," the source said. "One of the things

that we decided was that Swarthmore students would really like to see them on
campus. On questionnaires, people overwhelmingly said that they wanted some-

February 7, 2008

thing they could dance to, and that they
would like to see big name bands brought
to the college. I think The Roots really fulfilled that."

"The annual [LSE budget]
is $lOO,OOO. About 80
percent of it was spent on
the fall semester this time
around."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice President
Christopher Szeto 'O9, who attended the
concert last semester, agreed that The
Roots added to the diversity of acts
brought to Swarthmore.
"I liked [the LSE] a lot, it was a pretty
cool concert. I wish there were more
bands like The Roots that came to Swat,
but I understand that not everyone likes
that type of music," Szeto said.
"It was a nice change from [former LSE
acts] Wanda Sykes and Ben Folds," he
said.

Despite rumors, Da Vinci's not set to close
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

Amid rumors largely initiated by a post on the Daily Jolt
that Da Vinci's will be sold, owner Chris Bruno says no
and the Swarthmore Borough administration and the land's
realtor say they don't know anything about the subject
-

either.
Once known as the Cheese Court, Da Vinci's is a small
cafe in the Ville offering light meals, coffee and wireless

internet. Da Vinci's is owned by Chris Bruno and mostly student-run, catering increasingly towards students with
coupons, artwork, live music performances and poetry readings. As of Feb. 4, not a single "Closing" or "For Sale" sign
occupied space on the cafe's windows. However, a suspicious
ad posted online suggests something to the contrary.
On Jan. 31, 2008, an anonymous individual posted an ad
entitled "Coffee Shops For Sale (serves breakfast/lunch)
$85,000" on Craigslist. According to Craigslist's Web site, the
service is a "local classifieds and forumsfor 450 cities worldwide community moderated, and largely free."
The site is financially sustained by ad revenue, and anybody can post classifieds without being subjected to extensive background checks. It also provides an e-mail forwarding service to which interested individuals can reply to a
particular ad. Attempts to contact whoever posted the ad via
Craiglist were not returned.
The specific ad goes on to describe a cafe that is unmistakably Da Vinci's of the Ville: "Located in quaint village
town across from Septa Regional Rail stop and local college,"
"Light Fare served for breakfast/lunch/dinner," "Existing
owner will be re-modeling in the near future," and of course,
"Location: Swarthmore." Some of the phrases are taken
directly from Da Vinci's Web site. The poster's "reason for
selling" is that the owner is opening a "new, larger location
in Chester County."
Later that day, an anonymous individual posted the link
on the Swarthmore Daily Jolt. The identity of the individual
-

-

who posted on the Jolt is unknown, and responses to the post
are mild. The post neither confirmed nor denied the veracity of the ad.
Chris Bruno denied the rumors. "I am not sure where
you heard this, but the store is not currently up for sale," he
said in an e-mail. Bruno, who recently celebrated the birth
of his daughter, has been busy at home lately.
He indicated.however, that he has no intent to sell the
cafe and said that he was not the individual who posted the
ad online. An employee of Da Vinci's, Liz McGlinchey, also
denied the rumors. "Basically the story is thathe's not going
to sell, that's what he's been telling all of us that work here,"
McGlinchey said.
"It's just that his wife just had a baby two and half
months ago, a little girl, so he's spending a lot more time at
home with her, because his wife is a professor, so he has a lot
less time to work at the shop. So mostly this is a
studentrun coffee shop and then me and the cook in the back are the
only ones who don't go to Swarthmore," she said.
...

"[Bruno] thought about [selling] because he can't be here

as much, but as far as I know it's not true that he's going
to sell. Right now we're just trying to think of different
things to get the college student life back in here," she said.
Referring to the Craigslist ad in a later e-mail correspondence, Bruno said, "I can tell you this ad posted on
Craigslist was not posted by me." He continued to describe
an individual who he believes may have posted the ad.
"There was a person we hired as a manager back in
December who came in, got access to private information
and quit after five days. He then tried to contact my landlord
directly to find out when my lease expired, etc It is a person whose intentions are quite despicable. Unfortunately
anyone can place an ad on Craigslist as they have no verifi-

...

cation process."

The landlord in question is William J. Pastuszek Real

Estate. "At this point we don'tknow anything about it," said
a representative from the real estate agency who refused to
identify herself.

The ad on Craigslist describes a store remarkably like Da
Vinci's, writing that it was selling an "espresso/coffee
bar" serving "light fare" in Swarthmore, and that it had
recently begun a process of remodeling.
The Swarthmore Borough Administration Office knew
nothing either. Swarthmore Borough Town Center
Coordinator Marty Spiegel, viewing the ad for the first
time, confirmed that it must refer to Da Vinci's.
"Sounds like there could only be one place that fits
that description. That's a pretty hefty price," he said,
adding that he would communicate with Bruno on the
matter.
For now, while the provenance of the Craigslist ad
remains unknown, it does not seem that Bruno plans to
sell Da Vinci's. Furthermore, the identity of the individual posting the ad remains unknown.

Tri-Co energy conservation competition to result in cash prize
BY HANNAH PURKEY

hpurkeyl@swarthmore. edu

The first of the month kicked off the
Tri-Co Energy Diet, a competition
between Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and
Haverford Colleges to reduce energy consumption between the months of
February and November.
The environmental clubs on the
respective campuses will be keeping track
of the amount of energy used by each
dorm, converting it to amount of energy
used per student, Kavita Hardy 'OB, a
member of Earthlust, said.
This data will then be compared to
data collected in November (on a per-capita basis), the month chosen as being closest in climate and energy use to February,
to determine what percentage of the energy was conserved by each campus. The
winning school will receive a $1,500 prize
to be spent at the school's discretion,

according to Harvey.
"Our goal is that by the end of the
month it will have become habit to turn
off the lights when you leave the room
and turn off your computer at night and
use drying racks," Hardy said. "To the
point that people won't necessarily revert
back to their more inefficient habits."
Along with the competition between
schools, the college is also holding a contest among the dorms on campus. "We'd
like to do the dorm vs. dorm so that even
if we don't win [the Tri-Co competition] as
a campus, at least the winning dorm can
have a pizza party to celebrate their success in saving energy," Hardy said.
The competition is based on a similar
one that took place at Bryn Mawr last
spring semester, according to Emily
McGlynn, a member of the Bryn Mawr
Greens and organizer of last year's energy
diet. "It was really successful last year,"
McGlynn said. "A lot of people got really

4

into it. Our goal was to reach five percent
saving and we reached nine percent overall. On average each dorm saved 15 per-

cent."
Because of this tremendous success,
the Greens began to develop the idea of
having a similar competition but on a
much larger scale. "[The Greens] have
taken the idea and made it into something
so much bigger than I could have imagined," McGlynn said. "There are so many
more activities than last year. They are
doing a great job of organizing it."
Some of the activities taking place on
the Bryn Mawr campus include movie
showings and speakers.
The Greens are also gathering prizes
from local businesses to help motivate
students to conserve, according to
McGlynn.
Earthlust is also organizing several
events during the month to promote the
competition, including the Footprint project. "We're going to ask people to make a
tracing or imprint of their foot and have
that be symbolic of their carbon footprint
and then ask them to sign a pledge to
reduce their energy consumption and
then display them," Harvey said.
Earthlust and the Greens are hoping to
team up to purchase a bike-powered
blender. "We want to hold an event where
we make smoothies for the whole campus,
but students have to bike their own

smoothies," Harvey said.

Through weekly updates posted in
Sharpies, students can see how much

their dorm has saved and each dorm's

consumption as well as the other schools',
according to Hardy.
Earthlust also hopes to get a link on
the Swarthmore Web site dashboard so

students can have access to this information anytime.
The data will be monitored with the
help of the facilities departments at each

of the schools. Each dorm on campus has
a meter to track energy consumption and
the facilities departments are constantly
monitoring that data, according to Hardy.
Unfortunately, since off-campus dorms
are not on the same energy grid, those
dorms will not be counted as part of the
competition. Parrish will also be excluded
because of the inability to distinguish
between student and administrative uses
of energy, Hardy said.

"We want to teach students
how to conserve through
the use of technology to
promote more efficient use

of energy."
Jim McGraffin
Bryn Mawr Facilities

Engineer
Much like Swarthmore, the Bryn
Mawr facilities department is working
closely with the Greens not only to monitor the dorms' energy use but also to

make sure students are educated on the

proper ways to conserve.
"We want to focus on education as well
as the competition," said Jim McGraffin,
the Bryn Mawr engineer who is responsible for the energy program. "We want to
teach students how to conserve through
the use of technology to promote more
efficient use of energy without changing
their lifestyles."
One way in which the facilities department is doing this is by distributing free
energy efficient light bulbs, which are

February 7, 2008

equally luminescent while using only onethird the electricity, according to

McGaffin.
The

Facilities
Management
Department's guidance is also necessary
after the competition last year at Bryn
Mawr got a little out of hand.
"The competition was a great success,
but some students were a little too enthusiastic, turning off things that shouldn't
have been turned off," McGaffin said. For

the Tri-Co competition there are more
rules and regulations to ensure that
everything is fair.
Bryn Mawr's goal this year is to

reduce the school's total energy use by
another two percent, McGaffin said.
Although this is an impressive goal,
Earthlust has not given up on
Swarthmore's chances of winning.
"Bryn Mawr is going to be very tough
competition," Hardy said. "If we want to
beat them, we can; we're just going to
have to make a very conscious effort to
reduce our energy."
The Bryn Mawr facilities department
is making the effort well worth it the
money will be coming from a program in
which the school sells the energy they are
not using back on the free market, according to McGaffin.
"If we make the two percent goal, we
will actually save the $l5OO, the cost of the
light bulbs, plus money for photocopies
that we helped the Greens with,"
McGaffin said. "It is well worth the educational awareness to reinvest the money
with the students."
If Swarthmore wins, the money would
be put towards further efforts to save
energy by bringing speakers to campus or
funding an awareness party or concert,
-

according to Hardy.
"If people think about what they want
and if that would motivate them to save
energy, let us know," Hardy said.

Planning committees solicit student feedback
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MARA REVKIN
mrevkinl@swarthmore.edu
Next Wednesday, Feb. 13, Student Council will host a public forum to bring students up to speed on the college's longterm planning campaign, launched last year to define a trajectory for institutional development over the next ten to fifteen years.
In Jan. 2007, a steering committee comprised of faculty
members, administrators, alumni and representatives of the
student council and the Board of Managers was charged
with the task of envisioning the Swarthmore of 2020.
In a statement to the Board of Managers last February,
President Al Bloom emphasized that the planning campaign
is not about amending or rearticulating the college's central
mission. "Rather it should be about how to best deliver on
that educational and institutional mission in the decades
ahead," Bloom said.

"This is the time to be asking
hypothetical, open-ended
questions. If we had unlimited
resources, what would we do?"
Peter Gardner 'OB
Student Council President
...

The monumental project was delegated among several
subcommittees, each of which has meet weekly over the past
year to examine a different facet of the college's future:
"Academic Program," "Broader Educational Experience,"
"Broader Swarthmore Community and Philanthropy,"
"Faculty and Instructional Staff," "Leadership in
Scholarship, Higher Education and Society," "Recruitment,
Composition of Class and Financial Aid," "Resources" and
"Staff."
According to Sam Asarnow 'OB, who served on the steering committee during his two semesters as Student Council
vice president, some of the planning committees supervene
on the missions of preexisting advisory groups while other
"freestanding" committees were created exclusively for the
2020 planning campaign. "The difference between these

existing committees and the more recently formed planning
committees is that [the latter] include additional members,
such as representatives from the Board of Managers,"
Asarnow said.
According to Vice President of the college Maurice
Eldridge, the planning committees are in the process of soliciting feedback from academic departments and students and
will convey their recommendations to the steering committee by the end of the semester. "Next fall, we will start the
process of prioritizing those recommendations," Eldridge
said.

Elisha Ann 'OB, a member of the Academic Program
Committee, confirmed that departmental recommendations
'are starting to come in." "We haven't really solidified our
opinions as a committee yet, but we're seeing some common
trends across all the departments dealing with, but not limited to, enrollment, new technology, and faculty recruitment," she said.
Asarnow, who also sits on the Academic Program
Committee, said that the group is "thinking about big picture ideas, such as areas we'd like to see the curriculum
expand into, new interdisciplinary programs and maximizing research opportunities for students in all academic
departments."
While many of the committees address the college's inter-

nal culture, some of the task forces notably the Leadership
in Scholarship, Higher Education and Society Committee
are dedicated to sustaining the college's tradition of socially
responsible engagement with the public sphere. Eldridge,
who chairs the committee, said that the group is concerned
primarily with "finding the linkage between the college's
intellectual enterprise and its commitment to helping to create a more just world." This entails identifying a set of
socially responsible initiatives that the college will nurture
over time.
According to Eldridge, "Environmental sustainability
initiatives and student-run programs like War News Radio
and Swat Sudan fall under that category." Developing new
projects raises the inevitable question of resource availability, which the committee is addressing through its examination of existing and potential sources of funding. "We want
to explore these existing [funding] mechanisms but also
think about new ways to provide resources for student innovation," Eldridge said.
In addition to their primary role as architects of the longterm planning project, the sub-committees are helping to
produce a report that will enable the college to be reaccred-

-

ited in the spring of 2009. Each committee is responsible for
sections of a comprehensive self-study that will eventually
be evaluated by the Middle States Association.
The timelines of the two processes coincide to such an
extent that it seemed practical to incorporate the committees' recommendations into the MSA report, according to
Eldridge. "The separate planning groups are each responsible for developing certain chapters of that final report,"

Eldridge said.
As the long-term planning process kicks into high gear,
the college will inevitably have to explore fundraising strategies to finance the projects recommended by the steering
committee. "No independent school can imagine existing
without philanthropy. In the future, it could easily take half
a billion dollars just to keep Swarthmore as good as it is
today," Eldridge said, estimating that the college is three to
five years away from
a new campaign of the
comprehensive sort."
While institutional changes may indeed be on the horizon, the planning process has not moved beyond an initial,
conceptual phase. Student Council president Peter Gardner
'OB urged students to offer feedback on the campaign during
this formative stage, "where nothing is really off the table."
"This is the time to be asking hypothetical, open-ended, even
random, questions. If we had unlimited resources, what
would we do?" Gardner said.
Ann emphasized that next Wednesday's forum is intend-

ed to facilitate a discursive, rather than didactic, exchange
of ideas and information. "The open forum is designed to
inform studentsabout the process, but more importantly, it's
going to serve as a brainstorming session. We're hoping to
collect raw student feedback and incorporate those opinions into our committee discussions over the next few
months."
Asarnow said that students are respected participants in
these discussions. "When we're in these meetings, it feels
like a collaborate endeavor that the students are really a
part of. I hope students are excited about the forum because
it's important that they know how involved students have
been in the whole process," Asarnow said.
...

According to Ann, student council scheduled the forum
after hearing anecdotal reports that "students feel uniformed
about the planning process." "The college will be dealing
with a lot of money and prioritizing where it will go. We felt
that students should be aware that important decisions will
be made within the next year or so, and we wanted them to

have input in that process," she said.

Social Scene Advisory Council forming
BY HANNAH PURKEY

The

new

Social

Scene

Advisory Council will meet for
the first time on Friday to begin
discussing ways to improve the
social life at Swarthmore. The
SSAC, recently assembled by
Assistant Director of Student Life

Kelly Wilcox, is made up of students participating in a variety of
activities on campus to discuss
the school's policies about social
events and the student body's
opinion on these policies.
"It is going to be an informal,
open activity between what I hope

is a cross-section of students with
varying interests and backgrounds, but who all have a common desire to communicate with
each other and the administration to suggest improvements,"

Wilcox said.
In order to form the council,
Wilcox asked for nominations
from ten different groups and
organization on campus, including from the Student Health and
Wellness group and Student
Council. "Part of it was based on
the groups who typically turn in
party permits, whether for alco-

hol or non-alcohol events," Wilcox
said. "But it's also different interest groups, people who have
THE PHOENIX

expressed interest." The council
will cover a variety of topics
including the school's alcohol policy, the use of campus space for

social activities as well as the
communication network, according to Wilcox. Discussions of the
alcohol policy will include looking at the support network for
those with alcohol abuse problems as well as the comfort level
of students who choose not to
drink at social events. Tom
Elverson, assistant to the president for alumni relations and the
alcohol and intervention special-

ist, said the council is overdue. "I
am thrilled that the college will be
looking at dry events, dry spaces
and dry activities," Elverson said.
"I think it is tremendous."
Through his work with students, Elverson said there is a
need on campus for a council to
discuss alcohol issues and options
for more dry spaces and events.
"Just because you already have
twenty percent [of Swarthmore
students] that choose not to drink

or use substances, that doesn't
mean you can't extend that number a bit," Elverson said.

"I've met with students who
moderately drink here that have
said, 'I wish there were a place I
could go that didn't have [alcoholic] drinks,'" Elverson said.

One possible activity being
considered is a night in the Lang
Cultural Center, where food and
non-alcoholic drinks would be
served as well as an offering of
some kind of entertainment,
according to Elverson.
"I've advocated for [this council] for the last five years,"
Elverson said. Elverson also suggested designating more areas as
dry and holding activities, like
the Lang coffee house idea, where
students can get away from the
more alcohol-based social scene.
Students on the council will
have the opportunity to suggest
and discuss ideas like these at the
meeting on Friday, which will be
structured almost like a focus
group to allow students to voice
their thoughts on Swarthmore's
social scene, according to Wilcox.
Wilcox will then take these suggestions to other committees to
try to implement the changes.

Students on the committee are

looking forward to expressing
their concerns. "I'm concerned
about the alcohol policy on campus," Sunjay Barton 'O9, a member of the SSAC, said. "Not particularly that it's out of hand, but I
think there are improvements

that could be made that would
improve the well-being of all the
students on campus."

Environmentalism to be taught at Wallingford
Looking to expand their reach outside of the
Swarthmore community, four Earthlust members recently
began leading environmental enrichment sessions at
Wallingford Elementary School. Kavita Hardy 'OB, Ambar
La Forgia 'll, Greta Pittenger 'lO and Ashley Werner 'OB
spend one hour a week at the school teaching third graders
a curriculum based on environmental issues.
According to Werner, the idea for the environmental sessions was born when senior Elisha Ann 'OB was student
teaching at WES last semester.
The fourth grade students in Ann's class read a Time for
Kids article about sustainability and the Arctic Circle, and
several students expressed interest in further exploring the
issue of sustainability.
"Personally, I got really invested in the issues
lo and
behold, a few girls from another fourth grade class, with the
support of Debbie Wile (the enrichment teacher),
approached our class withtheir interest in forming a Global
Warming Group. The Global Warming Group would specifically think of ways to combat global warming in the school,
and met every Friday during lunch. A group offourth grade
students sacrificed their lunch time (and recess) to gather
in the enrichment room, eat their food and talk about the
issues and how to combat them," Ann said in an e-mail.
Ann remained involved with the group, but did not have
the time to be as active a member as she felt they deserved.
...

"I wanted to support the group in anyway possible, and

card making and experimenting with hot and cold, which
happens to be led by Swarthmore professor Michael Brown.
According to Wile, the enrichment program includes a
total of approximately 88 students. Eleven of those students
are enrolled in the environmental session, Hardy said. Wile
explained that WES chose to utilize this particular model of
enrichment for its third graders due to the special circumstances surrounding that age and grade.
"Third grade is an absolutely magical year in which the
students are interested in absolutely anything and everything. By the time they're in fourth grade, the curriculum
gets much more inflexible, so finding time to do it is difficult. And before [third grade], they don't have the skills to
do it," Wile said.
So far, the school has only held one of the six total sessions. During this first session, the Swarthmore group
gauged their students' interests and prior knowledge.
"The kids were already passionate about the environment, and they already knew so much. They really knew so
much more than we thought," La Forgia said. "In developing our lesson plan for the next session, we upped it up a bit.
They surprisingly wanted to know more facts and scientific
stuff, which we didn't expect for third graders."
La Forgia said that the group's goals for the class include
;
showing their students
the implications of global
warming and explaining
to them how they personally can affect global
warming. While the students commonly think of
the pollution caused by
cars as a major factor in
'

since my time was busy with teaching, I thought about
inviting Earthlust to talk to the group. I asked a few students and the enrichment teacher, Debbie Wile, how they
feltabout this, and they seemed to like the idea... I think it's
history from there," Ann said in an e-mail.

Ann connected Pittenger and Werner with WES, whose
administrators asked the Earthlust members to work with
the school within the framework of its official third grade
enrichmentprogram.
This program, which engages all third grade students at
WES for an hour every Friday, exists in the form of two six
week long sessions. According to WES Enrichment Teacher
Debbie Wile, the program allows students to pick from a
wide array of classes. Aside from the environmental class,
the options for this session also include learning about the
elections, scrap booking, songwriting, astronomy, theater,

global warming, they do not easily consider the effects of
their own actions, such as keeping the television on or hot
water running for too long, La Forgia said. "We wanted to
make it more personal," La Forgia said.
Werner also said that the group wanted the students to
understand water issues and the international scope of

environmental concerns.

As for the structure of the curriculum, Werner describes
it as an interactive one.
"We're trying to bring the lesson down to something that
they can understand, and not overwhelm them. We're asking them what they already know and adding on it in knowledge. We also want it to be a solution-based kind of curriculum by asking them what they think the solutions are and
then bringing in things that we can all use in our lives to
help," Werner said.
La Forgia and Hardy say that the group's most significant difficulties arise with encouraging all 11 students to
talk and with scaling the curriculum down for a six-session
program.
"Our biggest difficulty is with making the curriculum.
There are so many ideas we want to introduce," Hardy said.
"We only have six sessions to convey what makes the envi-

ronment important. It's such a broad topic that having to
narrow it down to what we feel are the most interesting and
important things is difficult. We also have to consider on
what level they can relate to it."

The Earthlust members' reasons for their involvement
with the environmental enrichment class lie in their desire

to incite activism in young students.
"I've just really been craving working with children in
particular. I think it's really critical that we teach our children right now what's going on and the ways that we're
really related to the environment. If we take care of the
environment, it's something that we have. I've been working on projects here with the administration and students
our age, and in college you just don't get as much age diversity," Werner said.
"We want to make environmentalism something that
people ofall ages can engage in. It's not just something you
do as a college activist, it's not something that just politicians do and it's not something you do when you have a
house and pay an electricity bill. It's something you can do
anytime," Hardy said.

Although rumors of a lice outbreak
in Willets dormitory caused some concern around campus at the beginning
of the spring semester, in reality there
was only a pair of reported cases this
year. The lice problem appears to have
been small and isolated and has now
been completely eliminated.
Reports of the lice may have evoked
memories in some students of a lice
outbreak early last year. According to
an article in The Phoenix from March
8,2007, the lice outbreak last year led to
treatment of several students from
Willets, Hallowell and Mary Lyon.
In that article, The Phoenix reported that Environmental Services technicians deloused public furniture with a
lice treatment spray, to help mitigate
the outbreak.
Despite the initial scare, the 2007
outbreak was quickly contained by
Environmental Services and the Worth
Health Center.
The case this year was much more
mild. "There were two students on my
hall who had lice, roommates," Willets
RA Katy Feniello 'OB said. "One had it
mostly dealt with by the time we got
back from break, and the other was finished after only about a week
it's
over now. This is the third time I've
seen lice on this campus, and it went
away faster this time than I've ever
heard of."

BRIEF

in Willets this semester
Femello described the situation

as

being worrisome, but not as causing
any fear.

"Some students were concerned,
mostly friends of mine who live in
other dorms, but the people affected
by it handled it in a superlative fashion, and it did not get anyone else,"
she said. The reaction was quick and
procedures were followed to ensure
that the problem would not proliferate.
"I sent an e-mail to the Willets list
when I heard about it, to warn people
generally about being aware and
avoiding fabric-upholstered public
furniture. But generally, it was wellhandled by all, and there wasn't really
much reaction to it."

Director of Health Services Beth
Kotarski said that there is ho mystery
to lice.
"It happens, and it's not dangerous," Kotarski said. "Good lice shampoos are over the counter and we
carry them also."
"I know it's icky, but really common among people who share bathrooms and bedrooms and very close
head-to-head contact," Kotarski said.
"Diligent cleaning of all bed linens
and pillows with very hot water and
hot air in the dryer is enough to kill
lice."

"Delaware County has done more than

Meanwhile,

in the eyes of the DelCo
Alliance, the community of Chester
reaps no benefits from the arrangement.
According to Heber, the waste treatment
industry doesn't provide much in the
way of employment opportunities,
although that is how it had been advertised initially. "The revenue isn't going
to Chester," Heber said. "It's going to
investors who are somewhere outside of
Pittsburgh." The Office of the Mayor of
Chester did not respond to phone and email requests for comment.
Though attempts to reach a representative from Covanta for comment were

unsuccessful, the Covanta Web site
claims that the Chester incinerator "provides an effective and environmentally

safe solution to the county's solid waste
disposal needs."

Furthermore, their official description indicates that the work of the plant
produces as a byproduct 75 megawatts of
electricity, of which 90 percent is sold to
the local community, though its efficiency is unclear.
Ewall provided The Phoenix with a
resolution that had been adopted at the
Delaware County Democratic Party's
convention, after being put forth by the
head of the Chester Democratic Party.
The resolution supported "waste reduction and a moratorium on additional polluting waste industries in the county,"
and included reminders that as a result
of pollution Delaware County is in the
top 10% of counties nationwide for "for
cancer risk from toxic air and water pollution."

Ewall said in an e-mail.
There's further frustration for all in
that reducing waste doesn't immediately
translate into reducing the incinerator's
emissions.
For Swarthmore College to reduce its
waste would likely only mean that much
more waste would come from somewhere
else within the county, or somewhere in
the region.
"This is such an economic powerhouse,
and very entrenched," Ewall said. "[The
incinerator] has a contract with the county

Still, he added, it's important to reduce
waste as much as possible, to inflict strain

on the industry, and reduce environmental

impact overall.
Moreover, he said, "If Swarthmore students were to work within their campus,
borough and county to help move the county towards a zero-waste goal, the county
could reduce its waste generation by 60-90
percent like other communities have
making it far more likely that the county
could back away from incineration when
the contract comes back up in 2017."
For those interested in learning more
about the history of waste treatment and
hazardous pollution in Chester, there will

be a screening of a related documentary,
"Laid to Waste" at Widener University on
Saturday. The event is hosted by the DelCo

Congressional initiative to impose stricter
enforcement of Internet copyright laws on
college campuses.
Section 494 of the Higher Education Act,
a new amendment to a bill submitted by
the House of Representatives, would
require colleges to provide legal alternatives to Internet downloading and take
steps to prevent it.
Wendy Wigen, a policy analyst working

that this university would become the
police force for downloaders," he said. "I
think we have other agendas that we need

The milder Senate version of the bill,
which includes Section 494, passed almost
unianimously last July.
The updated bill has yet to reach the
floor, but there are two ways it can be
removed.
"What we're trying for is to get the language deleted in what they call the manager's amendment," Wigen said. "So, before it
ever gets to the floor for a vote, the language will be deleted." She also mentioned
a late option
that when the House and

RA selection set to begin A chat with Robert Kuttner
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu

Resident Assistant applications are in
for the 2008-2009 school year, and the RA
Selection Committee will begin to conduct interviews, which will last from Feb.
13-17 and will be followed by deliberations
on Feb. 29 and March L Decisions for the
next group of RAs will be made on March
5.
According to Associate Dean for
Student Life Myrt Westphal, the process
of selecting RAs and alternates is a long
and arduous one, but it is one that is critical for providing students with a fun and
safe college experience within the dorms.
"We're picking
student leaders
you're known on this campus
because
as an RA. If there is an emergency in the
woods or at a party or whatever, RAs step
up and try to diffuse the situation or help.
...

So we want people that the community
admires," Westphal said.
The RA Selection Committee is
responsible for selecting RAs from a pool
of applicants who are interviewed in both
semesters of the school year. This is done
for the sake of applicants who have been
away studying abroad or on leave during
either of the semesters.
"We have to do the first round of RA
interviews after the application materials are due in the fall," Jenna McCreery
'lO, a member of the RA Selection

Committee, said. "This year, we had our
first round of interviews at the end of
November. Then, we took that information and filed it away."
According to McCreery, this process is
repeated "in the spring after the applications were due on February 4th." The
applications asked students to answer a
number of questions that relate to the RA
role and to share personal experiences
that would be appropriate in attesting to

their ability to be an ideal candidate for
the RA position.
The interviews then seek to discover
similar aspects about the candidate but
through a more discerning approach.
Each applicant is interviewed by a group
of three members of the committee and a
dean. Each committee member is responsible for being present at approximately
13 interviews over the next two weeks.

According to Westphal, "We look at
the applications, student by student. We
talk about strengths and weaknesses and
think about whether they have the characteristics that we think would make a
good RA, and students get ranked at that

time," Westphal said.
Applicants are ranked into groups
based on their possibility of being accepted, denoted by a "definite yes", "maybe
yes", "maybe no"" and "yes for certain circumstances", among others.

Phoenix reporter Matt Bleiman recently sat down with Editor in Chief of the
American Prospect Robert Kuttner to discuss his views on the state of the American

economy and what factors he believes may
lead to either a recession or a recovery.
Kuttner gave a lecture Monday at

entitled "Deregulation,
Financial Risks, and the New Politics of
Managed Capitalism." Co-founder of the
Economic Policy Institute, Kuttner is the
also author of six books, most recently
"The Squandering of America: How the
Failure of our Politics Undermines our
Prosperity." In addition, Kuttner has been
granted an honorary doctorate from
Swarthmore College:
Is the economy headed towards a recession, and if so what are the implications of
that?
Yeah, it's headed towards a very severe
recession and the difference between this
recession and others since the '3os is that
this recession was caused by damage to
banks and other financial institutions
which makes it harder to cure because if a
bank has lost a huge amount of money then
a bank is reluctant to lend money and that
has a contractionary effect on the whole
Swarthmore

economy.

Recently the Fed has been cutting
they've cut interest rates twice and there's
been a lot oftalk in Congress about stimulus
plans, so how do you think this is all working to help the problem? Is it going to be a
long-term issue?
Well, it helps a little bit. I don't think it
fixes it. First of all, I don't think the stimustimulus is about
lus is big enough. The
one percent of GDP about $l5O billion in
-

an economy that's almost $l5 trillion.
That's not big enough given the damage
that the economy has suffered. You also
have housing valuesreally taking a hit and
the average middle-class family has most of
its net worth in their house. Now, most
housing values are declining at the rate of
about seven percent this year. That means
that people's homes are going to lose about
$2 trillion in value, so unless Congress and
the administration do something a lot bolder to prevent the slide in housing values
and the increase in foreclosures, that's

going to really be a dead weight on the
economy. If your house is worth less
money, you're less inclined to buy consumer durables, you're less inclined to put
money into home repair, you're less
inclined to go out and buy a new house and so the damage to the housing sector is
another really serious problem that is not
going to be fixed just by lowering interest
rates.
Do you think now is a good time where
the people can capture the need for greater
regulation due to the fact that what's happening now isn't working?
I think the job of political leadership is
to help people connect the dots. Most ordinary citizens do not connect the dots
between the sub-prime collapse which is
pretty technical and pretty hard to under-

stand and the failure of deregulation. So,
before this becomes an opportunity to have
some consumer protection legislation
enacted, the leaders are going to have to
use this as a teachable moment. I think you
need re-regulation, you need a lot of public
spending, and you need a whole set of policies to improve the distribution of income

So it's more of a long-term plan that
needs to be totally reworked and fixed back
into the economy, would you say?
Well, I think there are short-term things
we need to do. For example, let me give you

one. The stimulus package is about $l5O billion. What happens in this kind of a downturn is that state governments find that
their tax receipts are not as plentiful as
they anticipated because people are spending less money at the store so sales tax
receipts are down, people are earning less
because there is higher unemployment so
income tax receipts are down and their
homes are worth less so property tax
receipts are down and that means that
states and cities and towns have less
money to spend. So at exactly the moment
when you would expect states and cities
and towns to spend more money, cities and
towns are spending less money and they
are adding to the recession. One of the
things that the federal government ought
to do is it ought to have emergency aid to
states and cities

economically to be young.
It's also a good time to be

idealistic."

Editor in Chief, The
American Prospect
Seeing as this is all happening now

before the presidential elections J saw you
were a supporter ofJohn Edwards's policies
for the election. Now that he has dropped
out, how do you think that is going to affect
-

things, or which of the candidates do you
think is going to pick up his ideas?
I think as the economic situation worsens, I think whether the Democratic nominee is Obama or Clinton, I think you're
going to find both of them recommending

stronger and stronger recovery measures
because circumstances are going to
demand it.
And you feel the Democrats, in general,
are more capable of revitalizing the economy
than the Republicans would be?
Well, I think philosophically the history
of the Democratic party is of a party that's
more inclined to use government to produce economic recovery and to create a
more balanced economy. The Republicans'
philosophy is less government, more tax
cuts and they're particularly ill equipped
to lead the country in a situation like this
one.
Finally, this is a big situation in the
country. Do you think it has any specific
effect on the students who are at a school like
Swarthmore? What impact does it have
directly on young people?
I think its a particularly tough time to
be starting out in the economy because
companies are not doing as much hiring,

universities are not doing as much hiring.
A lot of jobs that younger people have don't
have health insurance. People who don't
come from affluent families have tuition
bills and loans to pay off. A lot of young
people have credit card debts to wrestle
with. It's a tougher time to be starting out
than it was when I was starting out when
the economy was at the beginning of a long
boom. Swarthmore students are better
positioned than a lot of other young people
because they have an excellent education
a degree from a wonderful college. Many of
them are from affluent families so they
have a head start. But it's a difficult time
economically to be young. It's also a good

Carr explains Cuban identity, politics RAs chosen carefully
Prior to his talk this past Wednesday ("Wither
the Cuban Revolution?"), Phoenix reporter Mary

Prager sat down with Latin American historian
Barry Carr. Oxford-educated, Carr is the author
of eight books on the history of Communism in
Latin America, labor movements in Cuba and
Mexico and the trends of numerous other "popular" movement phenomena that have occurred
throughout the Americas.
Carr is currently in the final stages of publishing a manuscript detailing the lives of Cuban
sugar industry workers.
Could you tell me a bit about yourself, about
your background?
Sure. I was born in London, in Britain, but I
went to Australia in the early 1970s and since 1972
I've been a professor at university in Melbourne,
which is the second largest history department in
Australia, it's called Latrobe University, and I
teach Latin American history there.
And I have a special interest in agrarian and
labor history, and in the history of social movements of the left in Latin America, and in terms
of regions I'm particularly interested in Mexico

and Cuba.
What led you to Latin American studies?
Well, I began to be interested in Latin America
in the 19605. In Britain, where I was born, the
interest in Latin America was much less developed than it was in the Untied States.
But the British government in the mid-1960s
set up a committee called the Parry committee,
named after a man called John Parry who was a
famous British historian of Latin America, to try
and find out why Latin American studies were
not highly developed in Britain and what to do
about that.
And the Parry committee report concluded
that the only way to rebuild Latin American studies in Britain would be to set up Latin American
centers in six universities, and one of those universities was Oxford, where I was a student.
And the idea was that by promoting the study
of Latin America in universities this would
enable Britain to recover its economic role in
Latin America which they'd lost during the period after the first World War. So it was a very
naive 1960s idea that somehow trade would follow
the academic flag.
So, these Latin American centers were set up
with money and with scholarships and with airline tickets to Latin America, so I said, sure, why
not?

I'll be talking about, you know, the impact of
the collapse of Cuba's familiar world in the late

what it has meant to Cuba, and I'll be talking
about the United State's response to Cuba, is it
changing, what is it at the moment and is it likely to change.

And I'll say a few things at the end about what
I think the options are that Cuba might take,

Cuba-watchers.
It's a bit like the old Soviet Union or China
today, there are people whose living, I'm not one
of those, who spend their entire lives coming up
with scenarios, for their political or intelligence
or their economics clients.
And there are scenarios that people have come
up with, and one of the scenarios I remember is
that Cuba will implode or collapse, which is most
unlikely.
But then there are other scenarios such as,
"Will Cuba take the China, Vietnam route" for
instance, one of the big questions that's asked,

partly because Raul Castro, head of the armed
forces, is somebody who in the past has shown an
interest in the Chinese experience of maintaining

One potential factor when deciding
whether a candidate could be an
RA is whether the candidate is in
danger of being overcommitted

activities. "Often the people that
are turned away are those who are
over committed and don't have

"A lot of people underestimate

One of the most important
aspects of the deliberation process
is the idea that applicants must
work well together as a team within a dorm building and within the
greater RA community. "I think
you have to look at all kinds of different qualities because I think
being an RA is being part of a team

Lowell said. Throughout the deliberation process issues of friendship or notoriety are downplayed

For Cuba
One point I've really made is: be

And it's also, the Cuban revolution was a
nationalist revolution, and so it's very important.

So I joined the brigade and that's how I began
to study Latin America, although like virtually
all my fellow students, none of us went on to
become business men or traders or investors.
I mean, that particular aspect of John Parry's
ideas never came to fruition, and in those days,

And most people don't understand about
Cuba, or fail because of this mistake, that they
don't understand that the Cuban Revolution was
as much in the beginning, and also during a large
part of the revolution an attempt by Cubans to
gain control over their own destinies and identities as it was a program for radical social and
-

economic reorientation.
So it's very important I think, not to lose
touch with this powerful sense of identity, which
I think will mean that whatever changes happen
in Cuba, politically and economically, those
changes will have to adjust to this powerful
search for Cuban identity, to maintain it.
Whatever it is, there's not real one identity,

Cubans control it.

VILLAGE EDUCATION PROJECT
BY JOAN KIM

jkim3@swarthmore.edu
While many students on campus often
search out NGOs for summer internship
opportunities,
and
employment
Swarthmore alumnus Katie Chamblee 'O7
went one step further and started The
Village Education Project, which continues to maintain an active presence on campus through the efforts of both Chamblee
and Swarthmore's Village Education
Project Team.
VEP is a non-profit organization that

funds the education of children from rural
villages who are not able to afford an education themselves. It also provides students from Swarthmore and other universities with the opportunity to spend the
summer in rural villages surrounding
Otavalo, Ecuador, where they help prepare
sponsored students for high school by
teaching classes in Math, English or
Computer Literacy.

"We've only been in
operation for two years
and we make an effort to
listen to the volunteers."
Katie Chamblee 'O7

VEP Founder
Chamblee
volunteered
initially
through a different program, which
inspired her to take on the challenge of
helping students fund their education. "I
realized the students would not be able to
continue in school because they could not
afford it," Chamblee said. VEP, on the
other hand, supports "something concrete."

"It's only $2OO a year for full tuition for
one student for one year," PR director Jake
Ban 'lO said. This tuition covers books,
uniforms and other supplies, so the students have a much-needed free ride to
attend school. "The students come from
subsistence farming cultures and don't
usually have the opportunity to go to
school," Ban said. By educating the

VEP hopes to
improve the prospects of their entire community. Currently, VEP sponsors and
teaches rural students in four villages surrounding Otovalo: La Joya, Mojandita, San
Juan de Capilla and Chuchuqui.
VEP Team member Anna Phillips 'lO
went over winter break to Otavalo with
Chamblee to visit the schools and teachers
and to evaluate what needed to be done in
order to help complete administrative
tasks. Phillips, who had never been to
South America and who had only taken
one year of high school Spanish, said, "My
Spanish was not very good, but they really
welcomed me in. They would speak slowly
without being condescending."
Chamblee and Phillips met with a
school principal and a tutor hired by the
organization to talk about the needs of the
curriculum. The entire discussion was in
Spanish and although Phillips said she
younger

10

generation,

"was not the most articulate," she was able
to contribute her opinion and give feed-

back.

Phillips is currently working on developing the curriculum for the summer
school program with the help of the department chair of Educational Studies Lisa
Smulyan. All of this additional work is
worth it for Phillips because "this is what I
love to do."
VEP volunteers Monica Cody 'lO and
Taylor Rhodes 'lO went to Otavalo this past
summer for two weeks. Rhodes explained,
"I taught computers to the students. There
were three laptops for ten kids so they
shared
I would teach them basic computer skills," an essential resource because
the children did not have computers at
home. Cody, who taught English, empha...

sized the eagerness of the students she
taught: "I loved my time down there, especially the kids that we taught... The kids
were happy all the time."
Cody and Rhodes also donated sports
equipment from the Swarthmore soccer
team to the schoolchildren. "The soccer
team was asked to bring sports equipment,
Frisbees, balls, and jump ropes, to a sports
league that was like a YMCA," Cody said.
"The soccer team was looking to set up a
relationship with an organization on campus," Rhodes said. The Swarthmore soccer
team ended up fundraising throughout the
school year, and several teammates visited
Ecuador to volunteer. "They were really
appreciative," added Rhodes, referring to
the donated equipment.
The program volunteers also spent time
out of the classroom, often venturing to
markets "with booths selling goods to
mainly tourists," Phillips said. Volunteers
took advantage of free hours to travel to
the nearby cloud forest, visit the rain-forest and even learn salsa dancing.
"On the last day, we had a field trip to
the lakes an hour and a half away. We got
into a truck with 40 other small kids and
stood up for the whole ride. The parents
were there and made us lunch and gave us
jackets they had made. It was so sad to say
good bye to them," Cody said, adding that
the experience was made especially memorable because "I also tried guinea pig for
the first time."

VEP website if they are interested in vol-

unteering for the program. According to
Ban, volunteers can sign up to teach students for two to eleven weeks. No knowledge of teaching or Spanish is required.
Once accepted, volunteers will receive
information on the political, cultural and
historical background for the location they
will be working in so that they can be
informed about the issues in that area.
Volunteers pay a program fee that goes
directly towards paying the high school
tuition for the students in the villages as
well as a housing fee.
This year, the VEP team will create a
set curriculum for the volunteers. "This is
a unique opportunity. We've only been in
operation for two years and we make an
effort to listen to the volunteers,"

VEP program volunteers can spend anywhere from two to 11 weeks preparing
Ecuadorian students for high school by teaching English, Math or Computer classes.
Chamblee added that, although the constant change in volunteers could be seen
initially as a weakness, it is also a strength
because each volunteer brings his of her
area of expertise. For example, every

'Illinois' makes some noise at Olde Club

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Local bands reigned supreme at Olde Club this past
Friday night with a lineup that featured two groups hailing from Southeastern Pennsylvania. Illinois, ironically

from Bucks County, and openers The Extraordinaires,
from South Philadelphia, took to the small stage and
filled the venue with over two hours of music that got
even the most reluctant of Swarthmore students nodding j|
their heads to the beat.
The evening began with The Extraordinaires, who
describe their sound as "an electric muppet
Although playing to a somewhat unenthused

and
monsters.
The
self-sacrificing
of
Extraordinaries' eccentric combination of guitar-driven
rock and children's books was powered by solid must*"
cianship and an evident love for performance. The sV
was marred by technical difficulties, which were ultU
mately resolved when Illinois lent a Fender Telecaster to
Extraordinaires guitarist/keyboardist Jacob Wolf.
Despite the complications, The Extraordinaires found
some fans at Olde Club. "The Extraordinaires had a swagger and a sense of humor," Robin Lipp 'lO said. "They
went crazy on stage for a little while...and weren't too
cool to talk to people after the show."
As Illinois began setting up their instruments soon
after The Extraordinaires left the stage, it was clear that
the quartet had the look of a disaffected indie outfit down.
With tight jeans and multiple packs of cigarettes in tow,
Illinois proved that they had not only the look but also
the talent to play a powerful set. Although their appearance seemed predictable, Illinois' music proved to be

uncategorizable and, at times, foot-stompingly danceable.
"Their music was so rhythmic, you couldn't help but

dance, or at least jump up and down," Diana Pozo 'O9 said.
Illinois' Web site describes the band as having an
lllinois' music meandered through various stylistic incarnations. With songs
ranging from hazy, keyboard heavy laments to pop tunes
driven by lead singer Chris Archibald's yelping vocals
(sometimes refracted through what appeared to be a
rewired telephone), the band defied the "indie/folk-rock"
Following the quirkiness of The Extraordinaires,
■ innovative of the two
I saw they seemed to have a pretty
good sound, nothing too unusual or special, but still
enjoyable. The first band was much more out there,"

Scott Weiss 'll said.
Yet, what Illinois lacked in originality, they made up
for in concision. Picking up on the technique championed
by the Ramones in the 19705, all of the Illinois' songs were
very short, allowing the band to show off the range of
their talents.
Illinois did offer up one awesome quirk to noveltyhungry Olde Club audience. After shouts from the audience demanding that the band bring out its signature
instrument, Illinois launched into the banjo-dominated
"Nosebleed," which was featured on an episode of
Showtime's "Weeds." "Nosebleed" proved to be Illinois at
its most unique, blending a country riff with heavy base
and drum undertones. "It was an interesting twist to have
an instrument so strongly associated with simple folk and
country tunes play the prime role in a dancepunk/shoegaze ensemble," Illy Quintano 'O9 said.
From cacti to boys clad in tight pants, Southern
Pennsylvania offered some of its best to Olde Club, oddities and all. Who knew the banjo could rock so hard?

Nietzche and Kierkegaard, draw parallels
with The Brothers Karamazov, Catch-22

drawn upon by the creators in a book published as a companion to the series, entitled Bad Twin and written by supposed

Religion and Spirituality on Campus Week began
two years ago when several Swarthmore students
involved in religious organizations voiced concern
about the student body's lack of awareness surrounding issues of religious life. "Students wanted to raise
awareness that there is a religious life on campus as
well as convey the diversity of it," said Joyce
Tompkins, Religious Advisor to the Campus
Protestant Community.
This year's Religion Week includes a lineup of
events that promote religious awareness, from a
sacred food display in Sharpies on Monday, Feb. 4, to
numerous lectures covering topics such as

fresh-faced,

"Feminism, Islam and the Postcolonial State," which

took place Tuesday, Feb. 5.
"I felt like it is an important thing to get involved
in, raising awareness of Hinduism and religion on
campus. Also, I like food. So it seemed like a good

idea," said Ishita Kharode 'OB, who was responsible
for explaining the sacred food display.
"It's actually quite comforting It's nice to have
somewhere where you can practice religion," said
Samuel Garcia 'OB, who was at the Ash Wednesday
Observance and Eucharistic Liturgy on Wednesday.
Tompkins added that it is important to note that
the week extends beyond just religious life
it
includes raising awareness of spiritual life as well.
"Not all students who are spiritual practice a particular religion," Tompkins said.
For students who may have missed any of the
week's earlier events, there are still plenty of events

For those interested in having some sort of sexual or emotional
congress, the coming of February is more terrifying than opening
up The Phoenix, reading an article on sexual harassment and then
seeing Ben Bradlow's smiling face next to the word "Clothesline.'
Way to pick the only Bob Dylan song that directly ties into the traumatic experience of fellow Swarthmorers, Ben. Well, except for
"Knocking on Heaven's Door." (And speaking of bad decisions by a
Ben, could Ben Van Zee's first column have been more unnecessary
or blatantly incorrect? How is it that a Spike column imitating Josh
Cohen inspires mass outrage while this goes by without a whisper?
I feel like Charlton Heston after eating delicious Soylent.) All tangents aside, here are .some useful tips for those who find themselves

unable to resolve a month hairier than Moustache November.
The biggest obstacle to February dating success is the greatest
Hallmark holiday of them all. Whether you hate it or hate it more
Valentine's Day is a dangerous time for any relationship that is an
open-invitation for your significant other to decide whether or not
they'll continue to pick against the field. The event cannot be "forgotten" like a birthday so there are few options here. One is to grit
teeth and power through, but dogged perseverance does not an
insight make. While the much ballyhooed "cut and run" theory is
often bandied about, my assumption is that most in the Swatßox
are going to want to hold on like death, taxes and Ron Paul (who
defies both deathand taxes) to whatever action they have. Besides
praying for the inevitable Swarthmore Plague to hit on the 13th, the
only other viable plan is a return to shock and awe theory, so I hope

While the Screw engine is grinding to full power, many of us still
have work to do. While the night itself is fairly innocuous, somehow organizing a simple blind date has become more anxious than
Republicans who have to choose between a Mormon and a
Manchurian Candidate. (Let the Swift Boating begin!) As I see it,
you are faced with three scenarios. Here are Screwing suggestions
that surpass even the Bone Doctor for hand-numbing goodness:
L You have to screw a relationship. One of them is quietly making rumblings about how fun it would be to go out with someone
different for one night. The other is terrified but must pretend it's
a good idea. If they want to be screwed with each other, they are
unhealthily into their theme. Diagnosis: Screw those bastards, in
the normal sense of the word. This is the one day of the year when
the focus should be on you! Give them a demeaning theme and
move on. Never screw someone with someone already in a relationship, unless the cheating index is above 80.
2. Your friend has a crush on someone and demands to be
screwed with them, failure is assured. Diagnosis: For God's sake,
don't do it. Any basic Neg theory would suggest that screwing your
friend with anyone they're actually interested in would be a massive tell. Instead, choose an attractive acquaintance, dress them in
hotness and have themmeet wherever the object of interest is located. Once both Screws flop, it's 12:30, they're both wearing their

nicest clothing and "Remix of Ignition" comes on, the biznasty will
commence.
3. Your friend has given up on dating and is obsessively planning your screw to conceal their loneliness. Diagnosis: Sit in
Sharpies, wait to hear the word "screw" and leap in with a picture
handy. If nothing can be found, import a ringer from your high
school and pretend they are an ML freshman.
It will be a tough month, but if we keep our focus, we'll make it
through. In other words, I'll see you in my pillow fort.

its characters over Shanghai's housing market. It's no "Pulp
Fiction," but its actors sell its story with such gusto that you
have to believe that this is the talk of the town amongst China's
movie-going middle class business, business, business.
Naive ABC that I am, these two New Year comedies have
been a fascinating window into Chinese popular culture today.
And what I see is a messy hodgepodge of random cultural signifiers cleanly removed from their origins in a way that only
consumer demand could accomplish (hip-hop and rap, for
instance, are prominently and nonsensically used in both
films). At the same time, both films, whose characters are motivated by nothing but avarice, are keenly aware of how closely
media and money converge. In the post-Tiananmen era, currency is China's popular culture today.

China's film industry seems
to be doing just fine attracting

audiences. For a nation so
long deprived of popular culture, a film tradition is slowly
creeping towards the whorish
blockbuster mentality of
Hollywood. And just as we have our summer season, the
Chinese film industry is taking full advantage of an age-old holiday, beginning on this very day
the Lunar New Year.
Yes, the Spring Festival is a time for hong bao, firecrackers
and all those generic things, but apparently, it's also become
inextricably linked to the New Year comedy, a genre begun in
Hong Kong cinema that the mainland has since capitalized on.
When I was in Beijing over the summer and was introduced to
this genre, I was given a rather humanist explanation for its
existence something to the effect of "On New Year, you return
home to see relatives, and then what else is there to do but go to
watch a feel-good movie?" It was this endorsement of the New
Year movie's mass appeal that piqued my interest. So, among
the piles of snooty art films I bought during my trip (they're so
freakin' cheap there), I made a point of buying a few lowbrow
okay, two, to be more precise.
New Year comedies
So, what makes a New Year comedy in the 21st century?
Based on what I've seen, it means really low production values,
really erratic editing and really cheesy musical cues disarmingly similar to our stoner genre (e.g. "Harold and Kumar") but,
of course, far less hell-bent on satiating the teenage Id. It's a
kind of movie that doesn't try too hard and just has fun with
itself. It's also a genre that, unlike a lot of the initial mainland
output in the 'Bos and '9os, appeals only to a mainstream
Chinese audience. Stephen Chow's "Kung Fu Hustle" is probably one of the few crossover exceptions that you'll recognize.
And so, as an American-born Chinese far removed from my
tribe, I'm no judge on how entertaining the movies are.
Comedy-wise, it felt like most of the gags fell flat, but that's
probably because I didn't really get the jokes. It's also probably
because, for supposedly mindless entertainment, the two films
I saw were ridiculously obsessed with business and commercialism. Ready for "Dude, Where's My Subprime Mortgage?"
My first case study, "Big Shot's Funeral," is about a "bigshot" U.S. filmmaker (played by none other than Donald
Sutherland, sporting a vaguely offensive Pai Mei-like do), who,
during his remake of "The Last Emperor," lapses into a coma.
Consequently, the director's assistant and a lowly cameraman
scheme to make his funeral a big commercial event in the
Forbidden City, selling ad space to all different companies. The
film is self-aware to boot, poking fun at real-life filmmakers like
Chinese film poster-boy Zhang Yimou, whose recent streak of
crowd-pleasers and current position as the Olympic Games
artistic director has made him the ultimate sell-out.
While "Big Shot" is an outrageous satire, the second film's
major conceit is flat-out parody. It's called "Big Movie", and I'm
pretty sure that, by naming it such, its makers intended to take
after "Scary Movie," "Epic Movie," etc. Indeed, the cover claims
it will parody 20 classic movies. "Big Movie" pretty much fails
as a parody of any of these (excepting a send-up of "In the Mood

BY JUNG KIM

jkiml@swarthmore.edu
It seems that I have gone into political hibernation,
but now I think it is time for me say a word or two
about this "magical" process of democracy that we
call the election.
First, about the two "insurgent" faces
Congressman
you see on the screen
Dennis Kucinich and former Senator
Mike Gravel. These two seem to embody my ideals more
than any others in the race. Senator Gravel's filibuster to
get the "Pentagon Papers" published is still the textbook
definition of political iconoclast. However, like the edito-

rial board of "The Nation" said, their inability to raise
money and to organize makes me look to someone else.
However, they will still be my first "ideological" choices
and I will always have the utmost respect for these two

distinguished politicians.
The next name, former Senator John Edwards, may be
old news, but I think he deserves a few parting words.
Senator Edwards was the guy I went to for that good ol'
fashioned populism who all jokes aside struck a chord
with the issues that I find are most dear. Senator
Edwards, in his political and post-political career, was an
advocate for those who did not have a voice. He worked
hard to fight poverty and looked out for the "little guy" in
the face of big corporations. His work with the University
of North Carolina School of Law's Center on Poverty,
Work, and Opportunity was an inspiration to a young
high school intern working poverty law in Little Rock.

Her political career spans
from the courtroom to the
state house to the White House
to the Senate.
Finally, the million dollar question for the would-be
political junkies out there: Clinton or Obama? This one
took some thinking. Policy-wise they are both along the
same pages (give or take a few differences in fields like
healthcare) and in the long run both Clinton and Obama
would make excellent presidents. Either of the two candidates will create a safer, fairer and better America. They
will both work towards making sure that all Americans
get a fairer tax, better health insurance and go to sleep
knowing that they are being taken care of by their government. So why am I then working against most of my
college friends (it's undeniable that Senator Obama has a
lot of support on college campuses nationwide) in endorsing Senator Hillary Clinton? The answer is simple; politics is not always about politics. There is a fair amount of
personal attachment to the Clinton family. Having
worked in Arkansas state government and politics, I
worked with some of the most brilliant people, these people being former Clinton administration officials. If they
are any sign of what is to come in the (new) Clinton
administration, then I know that this country is in the
very best of hands.

Senator Clinton is by definition a statesman
(stateswoman, that is). Her political career spans from
the courtroom to the state house to the White House to
the Senate. It is this (gulp!) experience that gravitates me
toward the Senator from New York. Knowing that she can
unite a divided nation and work with both sides of the
aisle in tackling the toughest issues satisfies my hunger
for change (the word everyone seems to be talking about).
It is a more solid promise than that of Senator Obama,
whose speeches always seem to captivate me and, yet,
leave me wanting more. I want more from the Senator,
more definites, more clarity, somethingI get from speech-

es by Senator Clinton.
By the time this op-ed gets published, Super Tuesday
will have been digested and we will have a sense of who
is likely to be the next president of the United States.
However, for a guy from a place called Hope (actually I'm
really from Little Rock, but Arkansans seem to really like
this slogan) there's always...you know, the rest.

The new surveillance
plans would allow the
DHS to use satellites
that capture
more
advanced images.
...

Last August, the Department of
Security
(DHS)
Homeland
announced plans for expanding
access to military spy satellites
directed toward the United States.
The official purpose of expanding

access to this advanced satellite surveillance network is to monitor suspicious activity around the country
with regard to terrorist attacks, illegal immigration, drug trafficking,
gang activity and pretty much any-

thing dubbed a threat to national

strictly scientific use by NASA and
the U.S .Geological Survey. The quality of the photos taken from satellites in the past has been comparable
to something you would see on
Google Earth.
In contrast, the Wall Street
Journal reported that the new surveillance plans would allow the DHS
to use satellites that capture significantly more advanced images.

These satellites will be coordinated
with domestic patrol planes, allowing the DHS to take images so powerful they can penetrate underground bunkers and see through
concrete walls. The Washington Post
added that these satellites "will be
operating 24 hours a day and using
infrared cameras at night."
Charles Allen, spokesman for the
DHS, told CBS News, "The full capabilities
of these systems
are
unknown outside of the intelligence
community, because they are among
the most closely held secrets in government." Not only are we not exactly sure what this program fully
entails, the Washington Post quoted
the DHS spokesman as saying that
they "envision 'more robust access'"
in the future.
But we trust the government, so it
doesn't really matter, right? They
probably already have millions of
photos of us all, and they're just trying to prevent terrorism.
Not really. Access to these satellites doesn't stop at the federal level.
The Washington Post also noted that
expanded access to these satellites
will also be available to many civilian agencies, and will be used to

enforce criminal and civil laws on
the federal, state and local levels.
The program has
already
received funding from Congress due
to DHS's claim for an "urgent need"
to expand access to these satellites.
How should you feel about this?
Charles Allen, top intelligence offi-

cer for the DHS, told the New York
Times, "My view is that no
American should be concerned."
Despite Allen's attitude, the program has raised the brows of quite a
few congresswomen and men who
had the program put on hold last
August. Two months later, a DHS
spokesman told the New York Times,
"We are totally confident this is
going to go forward." And lo and
behold, the Wall Street Journal
reported a little over a month ago
that the program is now being finalized.

You think that since
you don't do anything
illegal, the domestic
surveillance program
won't affect you.
None of us should be concerned,
huh? I'm sure the DHS wishes none
of us were concerned. That would
make their goals [unknown to the
American public] a hell of a lot easier to accomplish.
They wouldn't have to justify
themselves to Congress and could do
whatever they pleased. Why the
urgency? Do they really think
they're going to miss something? Or

are they trying to get this program
passed as quickly as possible so they
can evade the eye of the media? A
better question is: why don't most

Americans even know about this?

Why doesn't it attract more atten-

tion?
You may think that since you

don't do anything illegal, the domestic surveillance program won't affect
you. But as Kate Martin, director of a
non-profit government watch organization, Center for National Security
Studies, told the Washington Post,

"They are laying the bricks one at a
time for a police state."

Time to stop sexual assault
BY LINDA CORCHADO
lcorchal@swarthmore.edu
As a woman, I would like to say that I
hold much respect and admiration for the
victim of sexual assault last semester who

decided to take her case to

the CJC. Not only does this
take a lot of courage, it also

takes a lot of selfless consid-

eration on her behalf for the rest of the
women and men on campus. Especially in a
small campus like Swarthmore, I believe
that we must all be aware of circumstances
that could jeopardize our public safety.
Much like when Public Safety announces to
the student body that a bag has been stolen
in McCabe, I would like to see the day when
Public Safety will warn the student body
that another rape has occurred on this campus. It begins with courage.
Much of Alex Ginsberg's piece was influenced by a conversation that was posted on
the Jolt in December a conversation I saw

is even more so, I would like to ask these

address such concerns. We have all come to

we came and we've all, one way or another,

many more stories of broken mothers who
lose their daughters to a losing war of vio-

unfold. A woman, who admitted she is a victim of sexual assault, asked all brotherhoods on campus to get together and address
the issue of sexual assault on campus. Alex
rose to the occasion and said he would lead
such a cause. I'm grateful for his stance.
These brotherhoods could all get together,
annoyed by the situation. And I don'tblame
them. They could feel like they are being
blamed for isolated sexual assault cases.
They could express their frustrations that if
they have one bad apple within their group,
the whole organization looks bad and apathetic to sexual assault. They could throw
their hands in the air and say, "but what can
we do with an alleged rapist in our brotherhood, if the victim doesn't even press
charges?" All concerns and frustrations are

lence against women. During an Amnesty
International meeting on the issue, one
woman cried out and said it always comes
down to women informing men about
assault the dialogue always remains the
same.
After witnessing years of impunity when
it comes to sexual assault, I ask the men on
this campus to demand for something more.
This is not a woman's battle. There is a dialogue that must take place between both
gender lines. I speak on behalf of many
women who would like to hear back from
the rest of the brotherhoods on campus on

healing to begin. We should, in essence, help
bring them out of the nightmare to a better

turn, will shape the future of the college.
planning
meeting
The
on
Wednesday represents a unique opportunity for students to make suggestions and be heard, since the planning
process is still in an early phase.
This is a real chance to influence
the college and to ensure that it sustains and hopefully improves the quality of life for future students here.
Students often express, both around
campus and on the editorial pages of
The Phoenix, their desire for the col-

lege to take up important initiatives.

These concerns include, just to name a
few, the environmental impact of
Swarthmore on surrounding communities, the quality of housing and dining services and the state of certain
facilities such as Hicks and Worth
Health Center.
Furthermore, we are certain that
there are other issues on the minds of
students that have not yet been adequately discussed. Now is the time
that these issues are most likely to be
heard and taken into account as part
of the college's planning, and we hope
students will not pass up the opportu-

Say it loudly, say it proudly.

political

nity to make a strong stand at the
planning meeting.
Of course, we hope that students
express interest in the future of
Swarthmore by attending the meeting
and voicing their opinions in the
friendly spirit of the school. However,
we recognize that most of the suggestions made at the meeting will not
immediately benefit us, but rather
Swatties of the future. The character
of the school is partly determined by
the students, and also determined by
the faculty, staff, grounds and infrastructure. We need to avoid being
short sighted and participate in the
planning process, regardless of the
fact that we may not be the primary
beneficiaries of the campaign's longterm consequences
both for the
future of students at the college and

for ourselves. Swarthmore's esteemed

reputation for academic excellence
and social responsibility is part of
what draws students to Swarthmore
and it is important that this excellence

continue into the future, both for the
benefit of future Swatties and so that
our degrees continue to have the
weight of such an highly recognized
institution behind them in future
years, as we progress through our
lives.
The more we do now when we are
here, the more likely it is that
Swarthmore will resemble the kind of
institution we would like it to be a
decade down the road. By not attend-

ing, students risk not being heard and
take a chance at having their alma
mater be disconnected from the important values that we hold. If there has
ever been a time to come out and make
our ideas for the college truly heard by
those with the power to make change,
the time is now. We sincerely hope
that students do not pass up this
opportunity.

Lately, the campaign has been in full
swing against bottled water. Permanent
water bottles are a fashion statement at this
point. Sigg, for one, is sweeping the campus
with its shiny aluminum bottles. And don't
get me wrong, the political and cultural
emphasis being placed on water is important and a very positive thing. Bottled
water is a huge waste of plastic. It's a waste
of plastic that needs to be produced with oil,
shipped long distances using fossil fuels
then thrown into landfills to take up space.
The Earth Policy Institute reports that
86 percent ofused water bottles never make
it to recycling and it's estimated that 17 million barrels of oil are used annually to
makePET plastic water bottles. Even if you
don't want to invest in a "professional"
water bottle, it doesn't take a lot to refill a
glass bottle and tote it around indefinitely. I
would even venture that it makes you cool

packaging, it is largely ignoring the contents of that bottle: the water itself.

According to the work of Dr. Tyrone
Hayes and his colleagues, the answer is:
definitely not. Dr. Hayes studies atrazine,
the most commonly used herbicide in
America. This chemical blocks photosynthesis in weeds, but also does some interesting things to people, too. The enzyme
that converts testosterone to estrogen is
found in a wide variety of species, from
humans to mice to amphibians.

The distressing thing is that atrazine
is everywhere, and at much higher concentrations than 01 ppb. It's in our drinking water, allowed by the EPA at levels 30
times greater than the dosage seen to produce mutations in frogs. It's in the
migrant workers who apply the herbicide,
who have atrazine at levels 24,000 times
higher than what is associated with
decreased fertility and feminization of
frogs. It's in the rain at concentrations of
L 0 ppb even when the rain is falling far
from any farm. It's in the soil for as long
as two years after it is applied in the field,
despite a purported half-life of 8 days.
Why is atrazine allowed at such high
levels when it has been demonstrated to
affect the frog endocrine system at levels
30 times lower than that? Of course, what
applies to frogs may not apply to people.

There were several variables that might have

Individually, Maithili Parikh 'll had a standout

would defend their choice.
As someone who pays
keen attention to the mascots and names of other colleges and universities around the
nation, I realize that our mascot and team name is not so bad.
Dare I say that "Garnet Tide" is an understated yet classy
name that shows the true attitude of our institution as well as
its student-athletes? I mean it could be worse; judging by the
names and mascots of some of the other schools out there, I
would have a hard time battling someone upon the merits of
being called the Molemen, or the Pansies (a real high school
mascot). The following schools make my top five list for having the most badass mascots in all the land:

5. Wichita State Shockers This mascot garnered my attention a few years back when I thought that it was a guy with a
beehive on his head. Upon closer inspection I realized that it
was just a hostile looking guy with wheat sticking out of his
hair and mouth and sporting a throwback "WSU" sweater.
4. Southern Illinois Salukis Admit it, this name is just
fun to say, Salukis (Sa-Lu-Kees). A saluki looks like some
kind of dog with floppy shaggy ears. Though Southern
Illinois may not strike fear into the hearts of its opponents
with their logos, if you don't think that a name like the
Salukis sounds badass then you just don't know right from
wrong my friend.
3. UC Santa Barbara Gauchos - Though I have never really heard of anything pertaining to the University of
California at Santa Barbara besides the fact that their club
lacrosse team is pretty decent, I pick this team as my third
place finisher because of their logo. A pair of sinister looking eyes peering out from under a black ten-gallon hat, with
the word "Gauchos" in front. I'm not even sure what a gaucho actually is but it sounds way to awesome not to

anything that

phrase "Ragin' Cajuns." I have such a special place in my
heart for this team that I once picked them to go all the way
in my final four bracket. I would have been better off burning the money for heat.
1. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers This without a doubt is
my favorite mascot to date. Never mind that their baseball
team is pretty diesel, any team whose logo is a turquoise
juiced up rooster with a gold Mohawk deserves my respect.
Besides when was the last time you heard somebody say the
word chanticleer? The Canterbury Tales?
This column wouldn't be complete if I didn't at least
acknowledge those schools that I would transfer from on
basis of athletic mascots alone, I mean really I just would
never wear anything that had my school mascot on it if I
went to any of these.

1. UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs Not badass, not charming, susceptible to salt.
I still think that summer club lacrosse teams have the
most ballin' mascots ever: The Jammin' Salmon (fish playing a guitar), Team Ankle Breakers (skull over crossed
crutches), The Crease Monkeys and of course The
Benchwarmers (man sitting on bench with a lacrosse stick
in one hand and a beer in the other). If you know of any
team out there that can compete with that please let me
know, as I am always looking for hilarious new mascots.

Every second counts on Senior Day
BY MELINDA PETRE
mpetrel@swarthmore.edu
Saturday was Senior Day at Ware Pool,
where both men's and women's swimming
fought hard to say a final home farewell to
their five seniors, Andrew Frampton 'OB,
John Heagy 'OB, Katherine Koch 'OB, Jennie

Lewis 'OB and Franny Zhang 'OB. With Ware
pool the "busiest I've ever seen it," according to Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9, there was a
great crowd to see the seniors swim in their
last meet. The large fan base created a high
energy atmosphere which made for "an
exciting last home meet," said Lewis.
Even so, the team was able to focus under
the leadership of the seniors and "pull
together while competing against a really
tough team," said Allie Jordan 'O9. "If anything, the fact that it was my last home meet
made me want to make it worth it. I wanted
to defend our house one last time,"
Frampton added.
And defend the house they did, as the
men's team (4-5, 3-1 CC) defeated Gettysburg
(4-5, 3-1 CC) 103-102 in a close race that came
down to the wire. Women's swimming (6-3, 41 CC) lost their first conference match-up
after a hard fought battle to undefeated
Gettysburg (8-0, 5-0 CC) 114-91.
Going into the competition, GilchristScott knew "it was going to be very close
and that every single race counted."
Gilchrist-Scott's instinct was right on target, as the men's team picked up crucial
points with 1-2 finishes in the 1000-yard
freestyle, the 50-yard freestyle, the 200-yard
individual medley and the 500-yard
freestyle. Frampton took first in both the
1000 and the 500, saying, "I wanted to make
my last meet at Ware count, so I put everything out there, whether or not I was in the
lead, I just wanted to go out and show what
I could do."
"Except for three quarters of the way
through the 500, there was no way in hell I

was giving that one to [Stephen] Shymon

The men's team won the meet on the
nail-bitingly close final event, the 400yard

their fastest guy first in the relay, so we
knew that we had a lot of ground to make
up. In that situation all you can do is dive
in and swim you butt off," remarked
Gilchrist-Scott. The dramatic finish gave
the Garnet the 103 points they needed to
win the meet.
The Garnet women found key points in
"

the 200-yard individual medley and domi-

nated the 200-yard butterfly, taking the
first three places. The women's side finished with a hard fought final event victory in the 400-yard freestyle relay, (Zhang,
Julia Wrobel 'lO, Chelsea Brett 'll, Lewis)
3:44.47 over Gettysburg's 3:44.56 effort. "It
was a perfect end to win that relay, and

even though we didn't win the meet, we as
a team had a lot of great swims," Lewis
said.
It was an emotional day for both the
men's and women's teams, but as Jordan
recalled, "The best moment, for me was
watching Jennie [Lewis] swim her last
race in the Ware pool. When she stepped
up on the block to anchor the final relay,
the crowd on the deck and in the stands
were all screaming and chanting her
name. That's what the meet was about:
the seniors."
This week, the Garnet traveled to
Washington on Wednesday and will face
Dickinson College on Saturday. Both
Garnet teams look to draw a lot of confidence from the Gettysburg meet in order
to "keep the ball rolling," Lewis said.
Frampton said the team intends "to go out

Garnet squeaks by Squirrels 57-56, drops one to Dips
BY LAUREN WALKER

lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu

Last Wednesday, the Swarthmore women's basketball
team trekked over to Gooding Arena to take on the rival
Haverford College Black Squirrels. The game proved to
be an exciting battle, as the lead went back and forth
multiple times before the final buzzer sounded, signaling
a hard-won victory for the Garnet. By beating Haverford
57-56, the women's squad effectively put a stop to its
demoralizing eight-game losing streak.

"We decided as a team that from
here on out, there are no more
excuses."
Karen Berk 'OB
The team went into the game on Wednesday with confidence, but they also knew that they would have to work
hard for the win. "Our attitude was that the Haverford
game was ours to win [as long as] we wanted it. That attitude kept us focused on a play-by-play basis," Lisa

Schumacher 'lO said. While Haverford was behind
Swarthmore in the conference standings going into the
game, the players knew they would need to fight for the
win.

Haverford struck first, scoring immediately after the
tip-off, setting the tone for a tough contest. Despite the
constant pressure put on by the Garnet, the first half
seemed to favor the Fords as they held onto the lead for
the majority of the half. Swarthmore, however, stayed

strong. Laura Popovics 'OB scored her 100th career threepointer, and she was on fire from the three point line,
sinking four threes and helping Swat cut back the home
team's lead to six points before halftime; the teams went
into the locker rooms with the score at 31-25, favoring the

Fords.
on

After the half Swarthmore continued to put pressure
the Fords, responding to the loud chants of the oppos-

ing fans with an aggressive offensive run. Kathryn
Stockbower 'IL named Centennial Conference Women's
Basketball Player of the Week on Feb. 4, posted a doubledouble, bringing down a career high 21 rebounds and
scoring a team high 17 points. Stockbower's 21 rebounds
were good for the third highest number of rebounds in a
single game in Swarthmore Women's Basketball history.
Pam Costello 'lO tallied eight points on the day, and
Karen Berk 'OB and Ceylan Bodur 'll each scored six.
After taking the lead off a Stockbower jumper,
Swarthmore continued to put the pressure on, their lead
peaking at eight points with about nine minutes to go.
The rest of the game was back and forth, each team making runs at the other until the bitter end. Stockbower
sunk a lay up with less than a minute remaining to put
the Garnet ahead by one. Haverford put up their last,
desperate shots, but failed to take back the lead by the
time the whistle blew, leaving Swarthmore triumphant.
While the team came out of the win on Wednesday
with newfound momentum and energy, they faced a
tough crew of Diplomats on Saturday, Feb. 2, as they
traveled to Lancaster to take on Franklin and Marshall
College. The Diplomats are one of the strongest teams in
the conference (8-3 CC, 13-5 overall), and although the
Garnet put up an outstanding effort, the Diplomats came
through victorious, holding the lead the entire game and
coming through with a 84-55 win over the Garnet.
Stockbower had another impressive game for the Garnet,
February 7, 2008

picking up yet another double-double (her 15th on the
year) with 12 points and 17 rebounds.
Berk tallied 10 points, and Melissa Grigsby 'O9 scored
9, while also notching a few assists and two steals. After
the game, Coach Renee DeVarney commented on the
team's performance. "We need a little more toughness
and physical aggression. We are a team of nice girls,
which in many ways is good, but sometimes we just need
to get ticked off and take it to the other team," DeVarney
said.

"Our attitude was that the Haverford
game was ours to win [as long as]
we wanted it. That attitude kept us
focused on a play-by-play basis."
Lisa Schumacher 'lO
Despite the loss to Franklin and Marshall, the win at
Haverford broke Swarthmore's eight-game losing streak
and ensured an improvement from their record last season (5-13 overall this season over 4-20 overall last season).
The team hopes to bounce back from their latest loss and
keep the energy up in the home stretch of their season.
"It basically comes down to having the will to win," Berk
said.
"We decided as a team that from here on out, there are
no more excuses. Everyone is playing hard the entire
time they step foot on the court and hopefully we won't
have another game like F&M for the rest of the season,"
Berk said.

Track teams cruise through McElligott Invitational

Pat Hartnett, Alex Frye, Andrew Vanßuren and Mickey Katz return to practice on Monday after a strong showing at Haverford's Seamus McElligott Invitational.

Women clock qualifying times
BY JAMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO

jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

>—»

Despite competing with a thinned-out
roster, the Garnet women's track team posted several solid performances at the
Haverford Seamus McElligott Invitational.
Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 ran 5:18.40 in the mile,
good enough for a fifth-place both in the
meet and on the Garnet top-ten list. Lauren
Deluca 'lO, Bess Ritter 'O9 and Ashley Davies
-

'lO also clocked in with strong performances,
running times of 5:34.26, 5:37.05, and 5:45.98
respectively. As a result, all four women
qualified for the Centennial Conference
Championships to be held March 1-2.
While the majority of the Garnet
women's action occurred in the mid-distance division, Heather Hightower 'O9,
Nathalie De Gaiffier 10 and Rebecca Woo 11
held down the fort in the throwing, sprinting
and long-distance events. Hightower threw
6.90 meters in the shot put, De Gaiffier ran
33.98 for the 200 and Woo ran 11:43.48 in the
a*
3000, the last performance a conference qualifying mark.
All things considered, the Swarthmore
women turned in a very solid showing, especially considering that nearly all the athletes
competed in events that were relatively
unfamiliar to them. According to assistant
coach John Noon, the Invitational "was a
good meet for us to get some conference
qualifiers. People really weren't running
their main events today, but trying new
things to get the strength to be successful in
their own events. For example, Cait
Mullarkey ran the mile in preparation for
the 800 at Boston, and Nathalie De Gaiffier
ran the 200 to increase her speed down the
runway in the jumps." Hightower's performm ance was just as solid by comparison, considering that she is still a relative newcomer
to the sport. Competing in only her first var-

has a bit of adjusting to do. She described
her experience with throwing as being
"rough at first because I had no idea what I
was doing. I was just trying to piece together
the individual mechanics of it. Now I'm trying to figure out more a personal technique.
I am throwing farther by a meter to a meterand-a-half." Despite her obvious talent as a
thrower, Hightower has a humble view of
her early successes, attributing her strong
performance to "a lot of strength training... and being coached by the illustrious
Tom 'Gladiator' Reynolds."

"[McElligott] was a good
meet for us to get some
conference qualifiers."

Women's track coach

PRs abound on men's team

When asked about the indoor track
team's tough training regime, Connor
Darby 'O9 had one thing to say: "We take
it balls to the wall." That's just what the
Garnet men did this past Saturday at the
McElligott Invitational held at neighboring Haverford College. The day was full
of impressive accomplishments, tough
competition and numerous personal

records.
The Swarthmore throwing squad
made an impressive showing. Of the four
young men competing in the shot put
event (Nick Willet-Jeffries 'lO, Samuel
Garcia 'OB, Jake Baskin 'lO and Tommy
Huang 10), three of them threw PRs.

The Garnet women weren't the only ones
working up a sweat at the meet however, as
quite a few supporters turned up to cheer the
athletes on. Ashley Davies said she was surprised by "how many people were here
supporting the team, yelling and cheering.
...

It made the transition into indoor track very
welcoming having so much support. The
team is excited for the rest of the season."
If this week's performances were any

indication of what the future holds for the
Garnet women, they have every reason to be
excited. The men's and women's teams will
both be competing at the Boston University
Valentine Invite on Friday and Saturday,
March 8-9 and closer to home at the
Haverford College Quad Meet on Monday,
March 11

Coach Tommy Reynolds was thrilled with
their progress. "These guys are doing
great. They are all new to the sport, and
they are all improving and developing
into a solid throws group," Reynolds said.
The other field event in which two
Swarthmore men competed was the pole
vault. The two pole vaulters, freshman
Brendan McVeigh 'll and rookie vaulter
Huang, are new but valuable additions to
the track team. Being a freshman fieldevent athlete on the team has its challenges, according to McVeigh, but the
newcomers are adapting well. "It was initially difficult to find my place on the
team because the pole vaulters don't
spend much time working out with the
rest of the guys, but everyone seems to be
very welcoming
and
supportive,"
McVeigh said.
On

the track, the Swarthmore men

kept the intensity up with competitors in
every event excluding the 5k and the 4x4
relay. Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll came out
strong with a fifth place finish in the 55m

hurdles. Bacon's performance was followed up by an excellent mile run by Alex
Frye 'll, who clocked in with a time of
4:46.
Sprinters YJ

Heo 'O9, Emmanuel
Afrifa 11 and Simon Nin Zhu 'll all competed in the 55m dash. Afrifa and Nin Zhu
both doubledback in the 200 m later in the
afternoon.

"We take it balls to
the wall."
Connor Darby 'O9
Dan Kurz 'll opened his season with
an impressive 2:04 in the 800 dash. Kurz
said he was pleased with his first performance of the season, but looks to lose
a few seconds in the coming months. "It
was a good starting point. I'd like to be
under two [minutes] this year, but it feels
good to be back on the track," he said.
Four distance runners, lead by Micah
Katz 'OB, competed in the final event of
the day.
Katz, Darby and Andrew
Vanßuren 'lO all posted PRs in the 3k.
Coach Pete Carroll said that the team's
strong showing at Saturday's meet bodes
well for future competitions. "It was the
season opener for the majority of our
team, and it was a good meet to get our
feet wet. The substantial number of [personal records] is an encouraging sign for
the rest of the season," Carroll said.
This weekend, Darby and a few members of the women's indoor track team,
will travel to Boston University to compete in the Valentine Invitational.
Haverford will host the next local meet,
scheduled for Monday, Feb. 11
