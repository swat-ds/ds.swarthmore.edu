Board discusses Trotter
plan, multiculturalism
By Mark Osterweil
At its first meeting this year,
the Board of Managers met last
weekend to discuss a wide range of
issues ranging from academic concerns to financial aid. The Board, a
groupofappointed alumniwho meet
four times a year to discuss collegerelated issues and make financial
decisions, heardthe President's report as well as reports from the
Trotter committee and the Student
Life Committee.
On the agenda was the finalizing of theTrotter renovationproject.
The plan is ambitious: rebuild
Parrish Annexand begin a complete
overhaul of Trotter. According to
Kari Hong '94, a student representative to theBoard ofManagers, the
floor plans for Trotter suggest that
much thought has been put into
"planning for the needs of
Swarthmore." Inparticular, shecites
added seminar rooms, the grouping
of department offices so as to encourage interdepartmental cooperation and the widening of hallways
so that"students and professors can
talkbetween classes without blocking traffic."
The renovations will also be of
interest to campus car owners since
the plans call for a car-free campus.
The road extending from Parrish to
DuPont, for instance, is to be replaced by added trees and an expansionof the Rose Garden. Hong indicated that the question of parking
has still not been resolved.
President Al Bloom presented
his report to theBoardand indicated
that the President's Office would
target itseffort on three goals for the
coming year. First, Bloom will seek
to increase faculty input into decision making. Second, the College
will begin to respond concretely to
the issue of multiculturalism at
Swarthmore. Bloom plans to take
steps to foster understandingby creating educational committeeswhich
reflect pluralism, examining new

multicultural pedagogical approaches and implementing a number of still-to-be-determined curricular changes. Third, the President plans to proceed with the Trotter project.
Tshepidi Moremong '95, another student representative to the
Board, reported that other issues
discussed included the creationof a
committee to investigate reformfor
the honors program, future projections of financial aid and an increase in the college enrollment to
1,325 students.
The board also examined areevaluation of the foreign study
policy. It was suggested that the
policy be changed to allow for students to continue to pay their tuitions through the college, rather
than their respective programs, in
exchange for full academic credit.
Hong, however, was skeptical: "As
much as it wouldbe nice to get full
credit when studying away from
Swarthmore, I am not sure people
wouldbe willing to pay for it, especially for the programs which are
significantly less expensive than
Swarthmore."
Moremong and Hong reported
their observations to the student
body last night in Parrish Parlors.
Both indicated that they hope to
make theirreports public following
all future Board meetings.
Moremong also appealed to the studentbody to become more involved
withcampus issues. With regard to
the Trotter project, she indicated
that the President's office is more
than willing to listen to student input, and she encouraged students to
share their views with Bloom.
In related news: ThePhoenix is working on a comprehensive article on the Trotter and
NorthCampus renovationproject.
Look in upcoming issues for a
detailed report on the project,
whichpromises to change the face
of campus permanently.

Escort ad leads to arrests

Arizona students
arrested in sex ring
By College Press Service

TUCSON
Three University of Arizona students were arrested for allegedly running a prostitution ring near the campus and
employing college-age women, according to the Daily Wildcat.
U was undetermined whether the women involved in the ring
were US students, the campus newspaper reported. According to
police reports, a 19-year-old woman who was employed by Elite
Escort Service agreed to have sex for money with an undercover
police officer at a hotel near the Tucson International Airport.
Thomas Carl Watson, 21, a psychology sophomore, Sean
Robert Delahunty, 22, a creative writing seniorand a disc jockey at
the campus radio station, and Milo John Kaciak, 19, a sophomore,
were arrested at a house near the campus in late September. They
were charged with pandering and receiving the earnings of a prostitute, officials said
The arrests took place after police investigated an advertisement reading: "Elite Escort Service featuring Lauren, Nicky &
Victoria. Noon-3 a.m. Large selection. Reas. rates," that was published in the Arizona Daily Star.

Members of the Swarthmore Conservative Union. "We've made it safe for students to openly
read National Review on campus," said one member.

Conservative Union expands activities
By Eli Rubin
This is a big year for the
Swarthmore Conservative Union.
The group is planning to have guest
lecturers from among the nation's
most famous conservatives, drastically increased membership, and a
growing acceptance from theSwarthmore community .TheConservative Union, through a program entitled "Young Americas" which
helps bring big-name speakers to
campuses, will present Phyllis
Schlafly andWilliam Buckley this
semester. Edwin Meese was invited but will not be able to peak
this semester. Schlafly will speak
on November 4 and Buckley on
December 2.
The Union has grown significantly in its second year,from eight
members in 1992-93 to approximately 50 members in 1993-94.
When asked about possible reasons for the rise in popularity,
founder Matt Schenk '95 replied,
"Basically we make it more acceptable to be a conservative."
Schenk stated that he feels "more
comfortable being a conservative
now" than he did during his first
two years at Swarthmore. "When
I first came here, I felt very isolated. I didn't know if anybody
shared the same views with me.
I went through my first and second
years thinking I was wrong about
everything."
Members of the Conservative
Union feel that the campus has
been very tolerant of their views.

"In fact," saidRam Lee '95, "I am
more surprised when people act
with intolerance towards my views
than when they don't." Other members chimed in, "We've made it
safe for students to openly read
National Review on campus."
However, many feel that although they are tolerated, their
views are still not respected. "When
I have a discussion with a liberal,
we often find that we agree on the
goal but disagree on the way to
reach it. I am content to leave it at
that, but oftenI am told that I don't
understand the situation well
enough; ifonly I understood better
I would agree with them," stated
Lee.
Lee continued, "One reason it
is hard to be a conservative is that
liberals base a lot of their policies
on ideals, while conservatives often base much of what they say in
reality. That is not to say that we
don't have any ideology."
Conservative Union co-presidents Vijay Toke '96 and Geoff
Cline '96 agreed that few people
actually want to listen to theirpoint
ofview. "People dismiss our views
as heartless," stated Toke, "when
they do not actually listen to what
we have to say." Toke added, "I've
actually been told 'lt's not your
fault that you are conservative. It's
your parents who raised you that
way'."
The members feel that their
organization fills a crucial niche on
campus. "We're paying $26,000
for a balanced education, and that is

part of what we provide,"

explained
Toke. Chris Mazingo '97 agreed,
asserting that while at Swarthmore
"you have to challenge established
beliefs."
Many of the members hope to
move beyond what they feel is a
political situation plagued with
name- calling and knee-jerk reactions. "I'd like to avoid as much of
thename-calling—which is so characteristic of politics—as possible.
That's where a lot of the sensationalism comes in. We need to have
real substance backed up by facts if
we are going to have staying power,"
said Alice Stillman '96.
"The Union's focus is to bring
knowledgeable speakers to campus
to open up debate. That way students will be forced to go beyond
knee-jerk reactions and deal with
facts...l go to hear liberal speakers
for that reason. I thought the drug
legalization lecture was great; it exposed me to their [liberals'] way of
thinking," continued Toke.
A large part of the Union's
function is to provide a forum in
whichconservatives can debateother
conservatives. Stillman stated,
"We're individuals. Some of us
don'tagree with all the speakers we
invite."
In addition to thescheduledtalks
by Schlafly and Buckley, the Conservative Union will be holding
meetings in the Community Resource Center at 9:00 p.m. on Tuesdays. "If we ever get a bulletin
board, we'llbeable topost the times,"
remarked Schenk.

Study warns of drinking games
By College Press Service

POTSDAM, N.Y. Chug-a-lug and other drinking games are not as harmless as college students may
think, warn two researchers in a recently published study.
While "light" or "moderate" drinkers experienced few alcohol-related problems, those who played a
drinking game within the preceding year significantly increased the probability of negative consequenceslike
missed classes, violent behavior, and property damage, the report says.
Chug-a-lug contests and "quarters," a gamethat involves flipping a quarter into a mug ofbeer to designate
the person who has to drink the contents, were identified as popular campus drinking games.

Hate speech tests the
college community

A student reported thetheft of bicycleparts from a locked bicycle from
the exterior of Palmer. The incident occurred between 7:00 p.m. and
11:30 p.m.

Christian Fellowship and Swarthmore respond

A student reported the theft of a bicycle from the exterior of Parrish
Hall. The incident occurred between 7:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. The
bike is described as a Univega mountain style with a blue frame. The
bike was locked at the time.

...on this beautiful campus, I feel despised not for what I have done or what I look
like or how I speak, but for what I believe."
Many students were surprised on September 28 to find the e-mail message from
Andre da Silva, entitled "Illiberalism", expressing frustration and anger over a recently
received anonymous e-mail message .
Da Silva had sent out an all-campus
message about the time changes for the Investigative Bible Studies which are run by
the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship. The
anonymous writer sent back da Silva's letter
with the words changed. The results were
negative and vulgar. A graphic ofan upsidedown cross accompanied this disturbing
message. Following the message, Andre
also listed another document he found while
working in the computer center.
Many students have since responded to
da Silva's letter, some confused and some
angry over the "hate" mail. Dean Ngina
Lythcott was also a respondent. She noted
that with electronic mail, "we have the opportunity to respond quickly and sometimes
it is too quickly." However, she used e-mail
rather than 'slower' methods ofcommunication because "I wanted students to know that
somebody is hurting."
Several faculty members have told
Lythcott that they sent messages to Paulson
or Da Silva expressing their feelings on the
issue. According to Lythcott, the community has the "responsibility to actively work
to create a climatethat reduces ugly speech,"
and must now "work to create a community
that makes hate speech less likely."
In an interview withThe Phoenix, President Bloom had the following to say about
the inciden: "It is reprehensible for any
member of our community to engage in ad
hominem intimidation against any other.
Such action violates the core values ofinterpersonal respect and interpersonal support
thatwearesoproudofatSwarthmore. Ihope
that this incident will renew our collective
commitment to making sure that such acts of
interpersonal violence come to be regarded
as so unconscionable by the community as a
whole that they cease to occur."

a student reported the theftof a computer from the Intercultural Center
in Clothier, A Macintosh computer, keyboard and mouse were taken
between 12:00 p.m. on the 28th and 7:00 p.m. on the 30th. The theft
occurred from Office 133.
A student reported the theft ofbicycle parts from the exteriorof Palmer.

bicycle in the bed of the truck. It was determined that the bicycle was
owned by one of the passengers.
The Department ofPublic Safety continues to investigate the theft
of bicycles from campus. The Department is seeking the help of the
College community to immediately report any incident of theft or
suspicious activity. Anyone with information regarding previous
thefts is asked to call Public Safety at extension 8281.

Delaware county residents
consider a new periodical
By Andy Perrin
Over 20 residents of Delaware County
met last week at the Springfield Borders

Bookstore to discuss developing an "alternative publication" centered on Delaware
County.
The meeting, convened by Bob Smallof
Swarthmore and Terry Rumsey of Chester,
included residents of all parts of the county.
Many had different kinds of experience in
publication, from writing to production to
graphics.
Several of the people at the meeting
found that the Delaware County Daily Times
either misrepresented their communities or
neglected them completely.
"It's really big on church bazaars and
stuff, but there's more than that that goes on
in this county," commented Small.
The meeting discussedthe contentof the
publication as well as its format and printing

schedule. People were interested in a broad
range of writing and journalism, from arts to
a political forum to "hard-hitting editorials."
A teacher from Chester suggested that
high-school age students be encouraged to
writeby holding writing contests in themagazine: "the kids in high school have no outlet
for their writing because it's really censored," she said.
"That's why you get graffiti," chimed
in another participant.
Rumsey originally suggested that the
publication be an annual review of politics,
activities, and arts in Delaware County, but
the enthusiastic participants soon suggested
a monthly instead. "FromChester to Radnor
is a big space, and everything in between is
important," one said.
The group will be meeting again inmidOctober to consider next steps, how to get
the publication off the ground, and funding
opportunities.

DelCo AIDS Network

certified, the students will accompany Network workers to area high schools and colleges
in order to spread the word about HIV/AIDS. DelawareCounty isranked third in thenumber

College News Briefs
Compiled from the College Press Service
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. A country
and western dance class instructor created a
brouhaha by telling a University of New
Mexico student that the school had a policy
that women can't dance with other women in
the class.
The instructor, Jim Calvert, made the
comment to graduate studentJill Cornell. He
later said he did not intend to discriminate,
but wanted to keep the ratio of men and
women even so traditional roles could be
practiced in the classroom.
"I have no problem with ladies dancing
with ladies," Calvert told the newspaper.
"But to avoid confusion, I'd rather have a
leader stay a leader through the whole class.
Leading is a joband following is a job. It gets
confusing to switch back and forth."

CLEMSON.S.C—Can arthelp bridge
differences between the races? That is the
kind of question that will be raised during
Clemson University's first Festival of African-AmericanLiterature and the Arts to explore the role of race in novels, films, and
other art forms.
The Oct. 20-24 festival will feature playwright Alice Childers, novelistDori Sanders
and poet Nikki Giovanni, who will discuss
their work, and an art exhibit and jazz and
gospel concerts.
Harvey Gantt, former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., will deliver the welcoming remarks. In 1963,Clemson University was the
first college in the South to be integrated
peacefully by Gantt, then an architecture
student.

Da Silva also received a letter from Justin Paulson. Paulson acknowledged that the
finger message was his work, a plan filed for
the Unix computer program. The plan was
not originally meant to target any S warthmore
group, least of all the Fellowship, but was
actually meant to comment on the religious
right away from the college. Paulson clarified that his finger message was made accessible to all of the public on the network and
was not part of the anonymous message sent
to da Silva. (It should be noted that "the
finger" was not sent to anyone by either da
Silva or Paulson.)
Justin said he sent his reply letter, sympathizing with da Silva on a personal level
while still condemning the previously mentioned right wing political movement, because "I'm very concerned about hate speech
and I saw that something had to be done."
Da Silva felt that the anonymous letter
was just an indication of the sentiment towards many of the Christians and conservatives on campus and said"Thecampus claims
to encourage diversity, but many really aren't
tolerant at all."
Another student, DavidAuer'94, saidhe
felt the person who sent the e-mail was very
irresponsible and that people should "attack
ideologies not individuals."
Andre said thereason hemadethe anonymous letter sent to himpublic was that "I had
enough. I wanted to make people think,
which is the only thing you can do with that
kind of attitude." Andre said he now knows
the name of the person with the anonymous
letter, but won't disclose the name, feeling
there is no reason to go any farther.
Rishi Goyal, anothermemberof theFellowship noted a positive effect of the event,
"when someone faces this kind of attack, it
makes us (SCF)grow closer."
This incident, no matter the resolution,
does bring up questions of tolerance and
liberalism on Swarthmore's campus Lib
end, as defined in Webster's New World
Dictionary, "implies tolerance of other's
views as well as open-minded[ness] to ideas
that challenge tradition, established institution." The key to ensuring our liberal selfdefinition now, according to Dean Lythcott,

Second lecturer in the
Cooper series to speak
By Mark Kernighan

Theda Skocpol, a Harvard professor
and author whose accomplishments are
"unique in the history of American social
science," will give a lecture next Thursday at
8:00 p.m. in the PAC, according to Political
Science professor Rick Valelly. The lecture,
"African-Americans and National Social
Policy, from the Civil War to the Present,"
will be the second of three Cooper lectures
this semester. The lecture series, "The Politics of Possibility: Forging Democracy in
America," was organized by Valelly and
Political Science professorCarol Nackenoff.
Skocpol is noted for crossing the borders between sociology and political science, andbetween internationalandnational
politics. Valelly believes she is the only
author ever to win top honors from both the
American Sociological Association and the
American Political Science Association.
"Her work hasbeen appreciated from a number of different disciplines," said Sociology
professor Robin Wagner-Pacifici.
In 1978, Skocpol, a sociologist, pubUshcdStates andSocial Revolutions, "a classic and a standard reference... that brought
to a closure some old debates about what
social revolutions are, and opened some new
debates," said Valelly.
According to Wagner-Pacifici, this
book, a comparative study of revolutions in
France, Russia, and China, won the American Sociological Association Aw ardforDistinguished Contribution to Scholarship in
1980. Skocpol outlined thethree conditions
"necessary for a social revolution to occur:...
a conflict within the elite,... a state that's
militarily or financially vulnerable,... and...a
popular movement from below."

After making her landmarkcontribution
to international sociology, Skocpol shifted

her focus to the United States. This year, she
won the Woodrow Wilson Award for Protecting Soldiers and Mothers, a study of
"universalistic social policy" (USP): government aid to all citizens at once. The conventional wisdom is thatUSP began withFDR's
New Deal, but Skocpol traces it all the way
back to theCivil War; it began with veterans'
pensions. She also attacks myths about who
has supported USP; she claims it was used by
the Republicans in the 1920'5, but not by the
Progressives around 1900. "We had a very
early welfare state, we killed it, then in the
twenties, we redefined it," said Valelly.
"[Now} you give to the needy; you don't give
universally to the citizens."
First Skocpol studied veterans' groups,
then women's groups, and now AfricanAmerican groups. According to Valelly, her
lecture will cover "struggles by AfricanAmericans to shape the public agenda." She
will draw heavily on history and apply it to
modern events.
Skocpol's concept of "targeting within
universalism" has become a household word
for political theorists. Sohas her name. She is
already world-famous, and Valelly believes
that even if her ideas have not yet moved the
political state of the world onto a different
course, in about ten years, her influence will
be recognized as historical.
The sponsors of Skocpol's talk are the
William J. Cooper Foundation and the Department ofPolitical Science. The co-sponsors are, in alphabetical order, the Black
Studies Program, theForumforFree Speech,
the Department of History, the Department
of Sociology, and the Women's Studies Program.

Vandalism, editorial decisions
debilitate Phoenix's purpose
This week's editorial focuses on two separate yet equally debilitating facets oflast
week's Phoenix (10-1-93). While one occurrence was beyond our control and remains
a mystery, the other certainly was not.
Last week, various pages of The Phoenix may have appeared altered or, dare we
say, vandalized. A graphic on page five was tampered with so that a cartoon which
originally read "Leno, Letterman and Arsenio" would read "Leno, Letterman and
Arsenic, .and Bloom," obviously in reference to our Collegepresident. While this was
unfortunate enough, it was only the beginning. Both title and subtitle of an article
appearing on page nine also were vandalized. What should have read "Kick gr-ass in
Bio Lab: How to beat your elders at titrationand influence people" subsequently read
in Bio Lab: How to beat [off] yourelders at titrationand influence people."
Needless to say, neither ofthese changes was committedby staff members nor generated
from the Phoenix office on the fifth floor ofParrish, which leaves the source of this
sabotage without sensible explanation. (Luckily, our printer was able to detect and
correct some, not all, ofthese alterations before itwas too late.)The publication is pasted
up at approximately 4:30 each Friday morning,placed in a conspicuous yellow box
which is labeled "The Phoenix," and subsequently hand deliveredby the Co-Editors-inChiefto Benjamin West by 6:ooam awaiting the pick-up of Press Publishing Co. Last
Friday morning the printer gave usan early wake-up call to notify us ofwhat he saw—journalistic sabotage. These are the facts.
If any of these words vandalized, violated, etc. seem overly harsh, then once
again we have successfully gained your attention. Itis not the severity ofwhat was done,
but the very act ofdefiling a campus publication that we find at once reprehensible and
unnerving.
Whether for personal pleasure or campus comic relief, these acts were not
appreciatedby anyone affiliated with The Phoenix. Politics andpersonal tastes aside,
The Phoenix represents a staple of the College community. Editors and biases
(unfortunate as they may be) come and go, butThePhoenix 's purpose remains the same:
to provide aforumfor individualand community expression. Acts ofsabotage against
such a valuable medium certainly do not qualify. Rather, they reduce the overall quality
ofcampus communication to an ignoble existence.
Vandalism was not the only act last week which, in our eyes, reduced the integrity
of ThePhoenix. A "news commentary" on Common Sense, in retrospect, had noplace
whatsoever in thepublication's News section. (Infact, interestedreaders canfindfuture
installments of 'To comfort the afflicted, and qfflect the comfortable' in The Phoenix's
Opinion section.) Compromising our own editorialpolicies is equally destructive to the
publication's purpose.
These are some occurrences which we couldhave addressed through retractions or
apologies ofsorts. However, we believe that they affect the integrity ofThe Phoenix so
profoundly that they deserved more lengthy notice andarticulation. Well, thispaper is
on its way to "paste-up." Let's hope it is printed as it was produced. Furthermore, let's
hope that it is not only flawless, but tasteful and in sound judgement.

Make judgements for Good

It's football season and playoff time, and
most sports fans are living vicariously through
their favorite sports team. It is usually their
home team because it is ofthe city where they
were born. The home team is not just a team
based in the town one lives in. Fans look at the
team as a possession. The home team is their
team. Determining a favorite sports team is
differentfrom determining otherpreferences.
The difference is choice.
People make choices every day. They

D'Souza responds to Schmidt
To the Editor:

I have read Professor Peter Schmidt's
letter, and am familiar with the sources he
cites. While I agree with his urging that
students investigate the influences on the
American constitution, I don't thinkheoffers
any evidence that the Iroquois played a significant role.
So what ifBenjamin Franklin visited the
Iroquois? So what if Senator Daniel Inouye
conducted hearings on the complexity of the
Iroquois system of government? So what if
the Senate passed a resolution commending
theIroquois? I suppose theSenateresolution
can now join other resolutions that our illustrious Congress passes every day to cherish
groundhogs, establish a "Commemorate the
Haitian Revolution" memorial, and declare
Disabled Librarians Day. These resolutions
are intended to convey political sentiment,
not to establish scholarly conclusions.
Elisabeth Tooker is the leading scholar
on the Iroquois. In a long essay in The

Invented Indian she examines the extent of
the Iroquois influence on theAmericanfounding, and concludes thatit was nil; most of the
claims are based on rhetorical hype and political wishful thinking.
I am sure that no Indian constitution, as
ProfessorSchmidt says, wouldinclude a threefifths compromise on slavery—they were
entirely for it. There is no record ofany antislavery movement among Indians, who practiced slavery long before Columbus arrived.
When theU.S. abolished slavery, Indiantribes
fought-to be exempt on the grounds that they
were separate nations; only later, as part of a
treaty signed with the U.S. government, did
Indians reluctantly agree to discontinue enslavement.
Now we can understand why Professor
Schmidt's grazings in multicultural pastures
are so limited. Unpleasant discoveries await
him.

they define it.
Since people do not choose their home
team, and most sports fans root for it, most
fans may root for teams undeserving of support. People enjoy watching football. They
root for theirteam and relish the adversity of

the rival to fail. It does not matter how bad
either team's management is, or how bad the
players' personalities are. Whether the fans
judge their team or not, they still root for the
home team.
The fans quibble to their hearts' content
on local talk shows, but if an outsider judges
the team, thelocal fan will come to his team's
defense. Thefans do not act upon their judgment. No matter how disgraceful the teams
become, the fans will still support them. Such
loyalty and devotion perpetuates the status
quo of an organization, whether it is good or
bad.
If fans acted upon their judgment of a
team, the team would improve. Iffans judged,

Intolerance: the worst Editorial corrupts liberal ideals
kind of deviant behavior
on the person of Matt Schenk and
only after an ungracious description
of internal Phoenix politics do you
begin to seriously address Common
Sense. You quite rightly suggest
that society can not be qualified in
"black and white" but in "shades of
gray." Yet you immediately use convenient labels: "Reagan Democrat"
and "bisexual" to mention a few.
You may thinkI am only white, male
and Jewish, but that only defines
what group you may choose to ascribe me to. There is more to me than
three superficial demographic titles.
If you agree that it is a dangerous path to label people than surely
you wouldn't tag "conservatives"
the way you did last week. I am
quite convinced that conservative
ideology is not as monolithic as you
make it out to be. There are the Pat
Buchanans and the Jack Kemps of
this world, each sharing different
ideals but both being labeled conservatives.
You state that "CommonSense
is a space very much like the 1C...
centers which the conservatives
implicitly disapprove." I am always
suspicious of words such as "im-

To theEditors:

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the
article entitled "We must not 'tolerate' deviant behavior" in the October 1 edition ofThe Phoenix, written by lanHansen. In my opinion,
it is Mr. Hansen who is ideologically deviant, and not the conservatives on this campus.
The idea that dissent or difference of ideology indicates mental
illness or deranged thinking was
certainly not first conceived by Mr.
Hansen. It had its origins in the
Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin,
and was later established in Nazi
Germany by Adolf Hitler. Even
under the liberal regime of
Khrushchev, psychological "treatment" was the preferred means of
dealing with anyone who was perceived to disagree with the majorty. Furthermore, the repression of
free speech and free press was another basic tenet ofNazism and totalitarianism, as implemented by
Hitler and Stalinrespectively. Why
was it that these governments were
so afraid of dissent; what was it
aboutfree speech and freepress that
appeared to be so pernicious that
these governments felt obligated to
censor? The answer is simple. Stalin
andHitlerknew that withfree speech
and freepress, people wouldbe able
to think for themselves, the lies of
the government would be exposed,
and thus they could no longer control the ideology and the thinking of
their peoples.
I would suggest that itis not the
conservatives on this campus who
need their thinking examined, but
rather Mr. Hansen. First, the rights
of free press and free speech have
been held sacred by the American
government sinceits founding. They
are thefreedoms which separate the
United States from Nazi Germany
and Stalinist Russia. What audacity
you have, Mr. Hansen, to suggest
that my rights of free speech and
free press should be limited simply
because I don't agree with you.
Furthermore, your argument thatthe
conservatives on this campus should
not be permitted to "distribute their
paper on campus. .[or have] their
speakers limit our campus space,"
begs several questions. If conservatism were as illogical and deranged

Editor's agenda twists Phoenix goals
To the Editors:

Having witnessedmy publication (Common Sense) become the subject of muchcriticism in both the"News and Opinionsections
of last week's Phoenix, I feel it necessary to
reply. I would like to begin by stating that
although a few points in the articles criticizing Common Sense were well thought out
and even well taken, I found many points of
criticism both inappropriate and hypocritical.
In the editorial found on page four, the
Editors-in-Chief make a strong defense for
The Phoenix as an open forum for all ideas,
but theirattempt to come across as a publication open and accepting to all was undermined by the totally inappropriate Opinion
column found in the News section on page
two. Not only did this article— speciously
written under the guise of "news commentary"— contain several factual errors, it was
a blazing example of mis-use of editorial
powers by the author and News editor, Mr.
Andrew Perrin.
The Phoenix, in allowing the News editor to print an outrageous and factually incorrect opinion article in his own section, is
showing the extentto which it is allowing its
staff to have a private and political agenda and
carry it out in the school's only weekly publication. It's a pity that all the students at
Swarthmore don't have their own paper to air
their own views in. Of course, if they were to
try, it is most likely that they would also
become the victims ofattacks fromThePhoe"

nix editorial staff labeling them as seekers of
Affirmative Action and shameless propagandists.
For their sake, I hope that the Editors
were unaware of Mr. Perrin's inappropriate
"News" article, as it goes directly against The
Phoenix stylebook, something thatI know the
Editors are sticklers for. Still, I would have
assumed that Mr. Perrin, with all ofhis editorial experience, would know better than to
print something with such an opinionated
slant in the News section, especially as he is
the author of it. Even if he didn't, such a
transparent abuse of power should never
have made it past the hands of the Editorsin-Chief.
As for the other two articles making
reference to CommonSense, I have no quarrel
with them, as it was this sort of give-and-take
that I was hoping wouldresult from my publication. What I was hoping to put behind
Swarthmore, however, was excellently showcased in Mr. Perrin's diatribe, which was
more of a panicked and threatened defense of
Swarthmore's past years of liberal onesidedness than a thoughtful response to the
conservative publication.
As I have mentioned several times in this
letter, Mr. Perrin also managed to establish a
personal record for factual inaccuracies in his
"news commentary." A short list of these
distortions:
•Distortion: "Mr. Schenk... who is so
marginalized by his conservative views that
his work has graced the pages of 7 hePhoenix
for years ."

•Fact: My "conservative views" graced
The Phoenix for exactly one semester. Coincidentally, this was the semester that I took
over the Editorship and was required to write
weekly editorials. Mr. Perrin should rememberbetter thanmosthow"conservative views"
were really treated by The Phoenix in previous years. I wonder if he recalls how the
opinions ofMr. Read Schuchardt were treated
year after year by some of the hostilely liberal
Phoenix Editors?
•Distortion: "There is no merit to the
claim that conservative opinion is repressed
on this campus. Much of die editorialstaff of
the new paper has held high editorial positions on The Phoenix.. the writing ofMessrs.
Schenk and [Ram] Lee has dominated the
Opinion section for at least a year."
•Fact: I am the only person affiliated
withCommon Sense that has ever been on the
editorial staff of The Phoenix. Period. Mr.
Perrinknows this and his attempts to suggest
otherwise are simply thinly-veiled attempts
to lend weight to his otherwise baseless arguments. AsforMr.Leeandl"dominat[ing]the
opinion section for at least a year," I have
already addressed this ridiculous statement.
IfMr. Perrin can explain how a conservative
opinion every other week for a single semester is equivalent to dominationfor "at least a
year," I would be greatly impressed.
•Distortion: Concerning Swarthmore's
slippage in the U.S. News rankings, Mr. Perrin
writes: "Never mind that no slippage occurred, since Swarthmore was in the same
position last year
.

"

•Fact: The article concerning this issue
in Common Sense begins by establishing that:
"For the second straight year, Swarthmore
finished behindrival schools... in U.S. News
and World Report's annual ranking..." The
slippage referred to was based on the fact that
Swarthmore is, in fact, falling furtherbehind
Amherst and Williams in terms of overall
percentage points.
I could continue, calling attention to some
his misrepresentations concerning the "US.
News" and "Safer Sex" articles in Common
Sense, but I am quickly approaching my length
limit, and I certainly do not want to
hypocritcally violate any Phoenix policies.
I will simply close by stating that if Mr.
Clay and Mr. Taylor wish to truly set The
Phoenix up as an open forum for all views,
they should take all measures to ensure that
other members of their staffkeep their agendas out of the College's oldest student publication, lest it show them to be the hypocrites
they profess to look downupon. Ido not deny
that CommonSense seeks to promote conservative views— this is openly acknowledged
in itsmission statement. It makes no attempt
to hide this fact and is honest enough to
openly admit this agenda. I would simply
suggest that before making any more
accusations, ThePhoenix Editors take a closer
look at their publication (last week's issue in
particular), and see if they are truly free of the
agendas they claim to detest.
Sincerely,
Matthew Schenk

To the Editor:

Although it may seem an unusual practice
to respond to an editorial in one publication by
addressing a letter to another, I feel in this case
justifiedinresponding to the editorial"WeMust
Not 'Normalize' DeviantBehavior" in the inaugural edition ofCommonSense. In this piece the
writer attempts to makeacontroversial condemnation of bi/homosexual behavior more palatable to the average Swattie by arguing his case
in the context of condemning another "unhealthy" behavior: drug abuse. In the indirect
spirit of his article and out of respect of the
writer's freedom to his views, I protest not his
beliefs, but the "destructive," "deviant," and
simply unsubstantiated way in which they are
presented.

Since the writer chose not to directly address the topic of bi/homosexual behavior, I
believe it is worthwhile to examine the relevance of the argument against drug abuse to the
topic of bi/homosexual behavior. A bastion of
rational, traditionalAmerican culture, Webster's

New World Dictionary, Third College Edition
defines "homosexual" as "characterized by
sexual desire for those of the same sex as oneself." Honestly, of what delicate fabric is our
country constructed if it can be "deteriorated"
by sexual desire? Bi/homosexual behavior, just
like heterosexualbehavior, does not cause physical harm to the body whenpracticed in a safe and
responsible manner. It will not impair judgement or motor control, dilate your pupils, or
cause hallucinations of Lucy in the sky, flashbacks, brain damage, or death. It will not make
you sick, damage your liver, give you lung
cancer, or shorten your lifespan. Nor does bi/
homosexuality "corrupt" and "drag down society" by incapacitating the labor force, promoting gangs and crime, encouraging children to
carry gunsand beepers, padding Noriega's bank
account, or wasting the precious income of
desperately poor households. To equate those
suffering with AIDS with bi/homosexuals is to
ignore the biological fact that Nature failed to
equip that avenging little HIV virus with any
way to tell between whose bodily fluids it

wriggles, heterosexual or "deviant" AIDS is an
equal opportunity killer. It appears that a far
more dangerous and "disturbing" social behavior would be to fail to thoroughly educate firstyear college students on the true nature of this
unbiased disease and the protection against it.
All this does not change the "fact," as the
writer states, that bi/heterosexuality "is still an
abnormal and unnatural behavior." Why? Well,
the only evidence I could find in the article is
because "the vast and rational majority see it as
a harmful and destructive habit." So why try so
passionately to convince the Swarthmore community of this "fact" if the majority, by definition, already agrees with it? All right, so
Swarthmore may quite honestly be labeled a
little atypical of all-American society. Then
who exactly is this vast and rational majority
that defines for itself the morals it wishes to
uphold? According to the article, even if the
Government were to "legitimize" this behavior
by protecting bi/homosexualrights, and the President were to appoint a bisexual or homosexual to
his cabinet, it would still "not make the behavior

any more acceptable." This reasoning seems to
imply that these public figures and the majority
of people who vote are not included in this

"rational majority." In fact, the writer points out
that a bi or homosexual could be "your sister or
your uncle, or even your own child.'' According
to the evidence presented, since your own family members cannotbe trusted to be a part of this
vast andrational majority, this Mt. McKinley of
American values and moral standing, one finally comes to the conclusion that this "majority" must be, well, the writer himself.
I hope no one will accuse me of being a
narrow-minded liberal "conservative-viewsphobe." I am onlyfinding fault with the hurtful,
irresponsible, and inherently undesirable journalism exemplified by this article. In the words
of the writer, "I am simply calling attention to a
harmful behavior and recognizing thatthe blind
acceptance of this behavior is not the way to find
a solution to it—regardless of what the cause or
causes might be."

The tri-college system: What's On
does it really exist?
Informal survey shows that students want a more
visible and convenient connection between schools
By Megin Charner and Megan Hallam

Question 3: Does the tri-college system dispel rivalry or just increase tension

Ever been cross-campus visiting? We
have. Last Saturday we, Megan and Megin,
set off to Haverford and Bryn Mawr in order
to investigate the tri-college system. We
learned a great deal, including the fact that, at
present, perhaps it is really a bi-college system, with Swarthmore just attached as an
afterthought.
In order to gather information, we set
forth a set of questions for students at all three
colleges to answer. What we found was
enlightening, disturbing, but mostly interesting. There is much about this system which is
quite beneficial, but in orderfor it to be of the
greatest benefit to all three colleges, it is
evident that some changes need to be made.

between the colleges?
In relation to tri-college tension, "Apathy comes to mind. [lt would be nice] to see
more of a community developed," said Michelle Ruach '95 (BM). Most students at
Swarthmore felt that rivalry in sports was as
strong as ever, but that in relation to schools
in general, "because it allows a student ofone
college to be, in essence, a student ofall three,
the tri-college system helps [to] unite," said
Jennifer Shook '97 (S).
Between Haverford and Bryn Mawr,
however, there exists a certain general tension, with Bryn Mawr viewed by Fords as a
"male meat market" and Haverford seen by
some Mawrters as "a haven for egotism, tension, and immaturity." Once again, there were

Smoking
Godzilla!
By Ethan Borg

Honey, I'm on fire. I'm burning down
the house, baby. I'm hot I'm smoking.
No. I don't smoke. I lambada.
The moral of this story is not "people

fact be true, and it should not be underemphasized that lambadais against thelaw in
nature preserves, the true light of enlightenment I wish to spread is an intellectual one
(please read it over several times if necessary
to fully grasp the awe-inspiring essence)—
we, the human race, do some very strange
things with fire.
Take for
example my
friend Godzilla

to grow back, and that eyebrow hair implants
are pretty funny-looking (both as a client and
the owner of the company). Nevertheless, he
feels compelled to try to douse candleflames
with his spittle-dripping fingers.
First of all, it has been scientifically
proven that spittle, when properly used, can
both create and destroy. It can create possession of food when successfully aimed at a
sibling's cupcake, and it can destroy the mood

bellybutton (note: for my purposes, hoking a
big slimy one is to be considered equal to
saliva, although scientific studies have so far
been inconclusive). But nothing in the books
says that saliva can effectively insulate one's
fingers from something hotter than hell. Furthermore, I think it's kinda stupid (note: I
thinkit's stupid because I'm too chicken).
Now, let us focus on myfriend Sally, not
simply because sheloves my friend Garthand
kisses him despite thefact that his halitosis is
much worse than Godzilla's, but alsobecause
she prefers to walk on burning hot coals than
God-given concrete pathways and likes to
keep a flame lit about two inches from her
face (despite the fact that she dates someone
lacking eyebrow hair for very similar reasons).
Like every good-smelling Swattie, I read
The Phoenix every week, I am aware that the
issue ofsmoking hasbecomehot lately. Well,
frankly, I have something to add to that.
Listen, smokers; look at Garth Jones—he

that, try to smoke long cigarettes. Keep the

into your lungs and avoid walking behind
Sally, because you might hurtyour feet Plus,
don't throw your cigarettes out your car windows. That really irks me, because it's people
like that who start forest fires.
Finally, I'd like to address the way we
talk about fire. It really confuses me. "I'm on
fire" can be either a wonderful sensation or a
damn evil one. For instance, when I began
writing this article, I said to myself, "Wow,
I'm on fire." In the context of writing, this is
a pretty enjoyable experience. In the context
of having suddenly realized

my
smelly
friend Garth
said the very
same phrase,
we had to douse
his face with an extinguisher. See my point?
My point is this: we do not have a clue
how to deal with fire, which is pretty stupid if
you ask me. For thousands of years people
have burnt their spittle-dripping fingertips in
flames. And since Eve told Adam, "Honey, I
burn insidefor you," our fire metaphors have
severely confused already severely confused
people. Thus, I suggest, along with Al Bloom,
that smoking should not be allowed in public
spaces. First of all, I suggest this because I'd
like three or four responses to this article in
the Opinion section next week. Secondly, I
felt as if some sort of suggestion would be a
good way to end this article. But since I have
concluded it was not, I end on this note: not

Air Jordan soars no more

The best basketball player there ever was walks off the court for the last time
By Robert Fleegler

I remember the first time I
watched Michael Jordan play basketball. It was theNCAA Championship Game in April 1982 and I
was only eight years-old.
Jordan was a mere freshman
on a great North Carolina team led
by James Worthy and SamPerkins.
TheTar Heels were playing a Georgetown team led by a freshman center by the name of Patrick Ewing.
The announcers talked of Jordanthat night as the next great player
from Coach Dean Smith's illustrious UNC program. Little did they
know they how right they would be.
Georgetown was ahead 62-61
in the final minute when the young
Jordancoolly sank a 17-footjumper
to give North Carolina the lead and
the nationaltitle. Thefirst chapter in
an incredible book had been written.

Worthy and Perkins left after
that year and Jordan took on the
mantle of leadership. He quickly
became one of the top players in
college basketball- but never averaged over twenty points a game in
Smith's no-one-is-a-superstar-offense. This later gave rise to the
joke that there was only one man
who could stop Michael JordanDean Smith. The precocious star
would leave the Tar Heels after his
junior year to turn professional.
The storybook continued as,
before he turned pro, Jordan played
on the 1984 Olympic team that included not only him but future stars
such as Patrick Ewing and Chris
Mullin. Jordan led that team to an
easyvictory and hisfirst gold medal.
Our grandchildren will no
doubtmiss the answer to thefollowing future trivia question. Whatnumber was Michael Jordan chosen in
the NBA draft? Our descendants

will be shocked to learn thathe was
picked third, not first overall. The
Houston Rockets chose Hakeem
Olajuwon first, then the Portland
Trail Blazers chose Sam Bowie,
and the ChicagoBulls tookMichael
Jordanthird It's difficult to believe
that now.
Jordan was amazing in his first
year as he played his way toßookieof-the-Yearhonors. Fans got a sense
thatthis guy was the most electrifying player to enter the league since
Julius Erving came from the ABA
in the late 1970'5. Still, there was
no talk of him possibly being the
greatest of all time.
Perhaps it was in his sophomore season that we got a sense of
how great Michael Jordan really
was. He broke his foot early in the
season and the Bulls management
was content for him to sit out the
rest ofthe year. But Jordan was too
great of a competitor for that. He
rehabilitated furiously and returned
before the end oftheregular season.
He led the Bulls into the playoffs
and it was there he made his mark.
He rang up the eventual champion
Boston Celtics for 50 points and
then 63 in a double-overtime loss.
The Bulls were swept in three, but
we knew that Michael Jordan was
different than any other player in
the game.
He led the league in scoring for
the next seven years. Only Wilt
Chamberlain has equaled that feat.
Additionally, he made the all-defensive team seven years in a row.
The Bulls slowly built a competent supporting cast led by Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant.But it
was always Jordan who was the
key. Chicago made it deeper in the
playoffs each year, losing twice in
the Eastern Conference playoffs to
Detroit before advancing to the finals in 1991.

I picked against the Bulls in
1991. They were too one-dimensional. They beat theLakers in five.
Jordan was MVP.
I picked against the Bulls in
1992. After all, they just had Jordan. They beat the Trail Blazers in
six. Jordan was MVP.
I picked against the Bulls in
1993. After all, they just had Jordan. They beat the Suns in six. Jordan was MVP.
The truth is, I was never really
wrong. Though the supporting cast
had to improve for the Bulls to win,
they didn't need much more than
Jordan. Bird had McHale and
Parrish. Magic had Kareem and
Worthy. Jordan had
The rest of theBulls were onedimensional but Jordan provided
all the dimensions. He combined
the athleticism of Dr. J with the
court vision of Magic. He was just
as deadly from the outside in the
clutch as Bird.
Hekeptimproving.Peoplesaid
he wasn't a good three-point shooter
so he worked to become one of the
best three-point shooters in the
game. There was no challenge that
he couldn't meet
Perhaps that's why he retired.
No more challenges. Three NBA
Championships,sevenscoring titles,
and a general consensus on his status as the greatest basketball player
on the planet.
Have we really seen the last of
Michael Jordan? Or will he, like Ali
and Magic, watch his inferiorsfrom
home and get the itch to play the
gameagain simply because he thinks
he's the best?
If Michael Jordan thinks that,
he's right We may have seen the
last of Jordan, but even if we have,
we watched the greatest player of
all-time dohis thing. Happy retirement, Michael, we will miss you.

If we play like that at Seven
Sisters [Tournament on Saturday at
Vassar], I'd put money on us," said
co-captain Katie Westin '94, of
Swat's match against Gettysburg
College. Althoughtheylostinstraight
games, 7-15, 12-15, and 2-15, their
play was a lot more inspired and
intense than in previous matches.
The Gettysburg teamisranked among
the top 20 Division m volleyball
teams, but Swat did not let this affect
their outlook; "We had heard a lot of
intimidating things about Gettysburg,
but I don'tthink we were psyched out
by that... it actually brought us up,"
said fellow co-captain Way-Ting
Chen'94.
Things looked bad for Swat in
the first game. Gettysburg took an
early 8-1 lead, which, after a Swat
timeout, was quickly extended to 122. Gettysburg alternated low and
high sets and seemed to throw off the
timing of Swat's defenders. Near the
end of the first game, Swat managed

a small rally as it became adjusted to
the Gettysburg attack; this momentum carried over to the secondgame.
Each team showcased its defense in the secondgame. Each team
made incredible digs to sustain long
rallies. Swat fought hard and was on
the verge of taking the second game
as it took a 12-11 lead with the help
of senior Jenny Willis' kills and the
outright hustle ofChristina Richards
'94 and Nancy Rosenbaum '96.
Gettysburg, however, held its composure andrallied to win 15-12.
"We let them catch up [in the
second game] on serve-receipt mistakes," said Rosenbaum. These mistakes carried over into the thirdgame
in which Swat fell behind 8-0 and
never recovered. The Gettysburg
middle and weak side hitters were
too much for the Swat blockers to

continued strong.
"It was good to play against a
really good team who hit the ball
[hard]. They were very confident, I
think we can learn a lot from them,"

said Yvonne Lui '95. The key for
Swat now, in warming up to defend
the Seven Sisters title on Saturday, is
to polish their game.
According to Westin, "[Swat
needs] to keep the serves in and the
free balls to a minimum."
After losing toKutztown Saturday 16-18, 11-15, and 2-15, Swat's
strong performance could not have
come at a better time. "I think we
really pulled it together," said Westin,
who added, "Coach [Strawbridge]
liked it so much, he gave us tomorrow
off [to catch up on school work]."
Chen described Kutztown as
"another Western Maryland," referring to anearlier match in whichSwat
didnotplaytoitspotenual. "Theway
we played [Wednesday night], we
would have beaten Western Maryland for sure," said Chen. Certain to
be a challenger at Seven Sisters,
Western Maryland is one of the strongest teams in the conference. The
tournament will also offer Swat a
chance for revenge against
Gettysburg.

Men's soccer wins some, loses some

Men disappoint in loss to Dickinson, but rise to victory over Muhlenburg
By Chris Marin
It was an up and down week
for the Swarthmore College men's
soccer team. The down came in a
loss against Dickinson Saturday.
The up came when they kicked the
Muhlenberg Mules right in their
respective nickname. It was a week
that might well prove pivotal in the
team's run to the post-season.
Swarthmore was right back in
the thick of the Centennial Conference standings with a record of 5-32, having come offtwo straight wins
against Johns Hopkins and Holy
Family. Then along came lowly
Dickinson to spoil the party. In a
game similar to this year's earlier
loss to Kean College, the Garnet
were only outplayed by a little, but
were outscored on theboard.
The 2-0 loss came largely as a
result of Dickinson's ball control
offense and their physical style of
play. Although they only had 11
shots, they set them up well and
knocked two in. Only one was of
notable significance. It came in the
first half on a corner kick from the
far right corner of Clothier Field.
Whizzing by goalie Shawn Bundy
'97, a Dickinson player happened to
put the ball in by the far post of the
goal. The win by Dickinson was
marred by their excessive barbarism, which amounted to 31 penalties and two yellow cards.
Their bodiesbattered and egos
bruised, the Garnet withdrew into
the Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse and
regrouped with a week of tough
practices and new focus. You could

see this in their drubbing of
Muhlenberg.
Muhlenberg, a team ranked
25 th in the nation to start the season, came into the contest against
Swat with a record of 7-3. Their
only loss in the Centennial Conference had been to Division 111powerhouse Gettysburg, 1-0. They beat
Dickinson earlier in the season 2-0.
Swarthmore was coming up against
a formidable opponent at a crucial
time in the season.
Assistant Coach Don Norton
Jr. said, "It was like we (the soccer
team) were on DeathRow awaiting
a call from the governor."
Well, someone was listening,
because the team turned in its best
performance of the season. With
forward Krister Johnson '95 leading the attack andbacks Pete Jacobs
'94 and Jesse Murphy '95 playing
their usual brand of excellent defense, Swarthmore ran over
Muhlenberg 3-1.
At first it seemed like it was
going to be a long day for Swat.
Muhlenberg utilized the small (minuscule) size of their field to attempt some quick strikes at the beginning of the game. One shot
decided to go in with 19 minutes
gone by. Not to fear though, because Swat has proved throughout
the season that it can come back
from early deficits.
Using their shots efficiently,
the Garnet jumped on the board
with two minutes left in the first
half with a goal by Johnson. Having come close to scoring on two
previous shots, Johnson nailed in

his third shot on a cross from forwardLen Cuello '96. Having only
begun their feel-good massacre,
Swat went into halftime with a 1-1
tie and some confidence in their
blood.
Coming onto the field in the
second half, the Garnet were bursting with intensity and it showed in
their play. They came out firing,
maintaining control of the ball with
outstanding play from Dave Lane
'97, who had to move to mid-field
from hisnormal back position. Two
goals eventually came from thisrush
of enthusiasm as the Muhlenberg
players slowly disintegrated from
their own frustration.
First, Captain Jeff Nebelsieck
'94 scored off a pass from Cuello.
Then, only 4 minutes later,
Nebelsieck furthered his offensive
contributionby assisting on a goal
by Kenrick Cato '94.
This offensive display was
backed up by the aforementioned
firm defense and outstanding
goalkeeping by Bundy, who had 9
saves. All in all, the performance
was an accurate display of Swat's
talent and ability as well as a sign of
things to come.
Said Nebelsieck of the week,
"We were really down after the
Dickenson loss because it was such
an important conference game. But
the Muhlenburg game brought us
back up. It was our first big victory
-thefirst real game that we won that
we weren't expected to-in two years.
That game showed us that we can do
anything if we work together as a
team."

Low Tide for the Garnet
Football plays Ursinus for real, loses big
By Shawn Beckett
Last Saturday, the GarnetTide of
Swarthmore College traveled to
Collegeville,PA to get trouncedby the
Bears ofUrsinus. The final score was
57-16 in favor of the Ursinus.
Swat came out receiving theball
first and drove it down to thered zone
(20-yard line to the goal line) and were
forced to kick the field goal. Then
Ursinus came out and scored a touchdown. The Tide received the ball and
inched their way down the field until
they were stopped and forced to kick
the field goal Then Ursinus came back
and scored die touchdown. The Tide
cameback and fought their way down
the field and were forced to kick anotherfield goal. Then Ursinusreceived
theball and eventually scored another
touchdown. This touchdown, plus the
two-point conversion made the score
22-9 at the midway point
"We can win this thing. We just
can't go in thetank. Staypositive," said
Coach Miran in thelocker to a host of
disgruntledplayers.
The second half is whereeverything totally broke down Do not get
me wrong, the Tide never gaveup or
quit The problem was not the physical
aspect of the game, because every
member of the team played to his
maximum ability. The mental mis-

takes were very costly to theTide.
"We never went into the tank, we
did
just not perform as well mentally as
wechdphysically,"sakioffensive tackle
Charles Horton '96.
"You cannot blameany individual
for Saturday's loss. We lost as a team,
just as we win as a team,"said tight end
GregSelby '97.
The GarnetTide are now 2-2 and
l-2intheCentennialConference. They
hope to improve theirrecord on Homecoming Day, Saturday, October 9,
against Muhlenberg.

Swat hockey got off to a slow
start playing on turf at Johns Hopkins
on Saturday. After a difficult game,
the women came out with a 4-1 loss.
Swat went on to meet Dickinson
Thursday at home on a more comfortable field, but still fell 1-0.
"We were not prepared to play
on turf [at Johns Hopkins]," said
Melissa Bonder '95. She added,
"We had difficulty adjusting to this
and couldn't pull it together."
Bonder scored the only Swat goal of
the game.
Swat then met Dickinson Saturday in a tough, very competitive
game. Swat played some tough
defense in thefirst half. This led to
an aggressive attack, as well as excellent play back and forth on both
sides of the field. Kristen Osborne
'97 had some strong crosses that
continuedtheoffensiveattack. Swat
put a lot ofpressure on the Dickinson goalie but was unable to score.
On the defensive end, Jane
Grabias '94 had many strong drives
to clear out the Dickinson offense.
Osborne kept up theattack and was

helped by Bonder and the rest of
the offense. The game at this point
was played mostly back and forth
between the respective twenty-five
yard lines and neither team was
able to get on the board.
Heather Ritch '97 played in
goal for Swatand was supportedby
strong defense from Grabias and
Susan Rivera'96. Bonder played a
very aggressive game, as did Samantha Peltz 4 97.
The women started out strong
in the second half with Lia Ernst
'97 shining. The Swat defense was
able to stop Dickinson's fastbreaks.
Offensehadmany corners andmany
opportunities to score but was unable to convert.
However, Dickinson stepped
up their level of play in the last
minute of the game and scored with
15 seconds remaining to gain a 1-0
advantage. Their goal came on a
penalty stroke that was off a high
stick. Swat was unable to respond
in the waning seconds.
The women finished the week
with an 8-5 record. Swat goes on
the road to play rival Haverford at
11 a.m. Saturday
