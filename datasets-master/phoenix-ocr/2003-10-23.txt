More than 13,000 pages of internal

Curricular review will examine allotment of faculty resources
BY MATTHEW

FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

In the future of the curriculum, the history of professor
Steven Hopkins's employment with Swarthmore might be
of particular note.

When Hopkins, whose teaching focus includes religions
of India and the comparative study of religions, received
tenure two years ago, it was the end of a long road of, ultimately, job insecurity. It took him six years to go from visiting professor to a tenure track position, including his

first two years at Swarthmore, when he was a leave
replacement for professor Don Swearer.
In those six years, Hopkins was repeatedly told by the
administration that he had a future with the college, while

teaching where he could, including at Haverford from time
to time. And when a retirement occurred in the religion
department, he received the tenure track position. This,
however, was only after another national search; Hopkins
had already submitted to one for a position as a leave

replacement.

Toward the end of those six years, but before the tenuretrack spot opened up, Hopkins had other job offers come
across his desk, and he had discussed with his family
whether it would be better to take a position that offered
more permanence. In the end, Hopkins said of
Swarthmore, "it worked out."
The story gains significance in light of the Council for
Educational Policy's (CEP) decision last semester to begin
a broad review of allotment of faculty resources. This will
include a close look at each department's policy for hiring
leave replacement faculty as well as an inspection of courses that consistently have a smaller enrollment and teamtaught courses.

THE PHOENIX

What might come of the review is unclear at this formative stage. Possible changes that could result include a
reduction in the number of leave replacement faculty
hired or a reduction in the time they can spend at
Swarthmore (from a year to a semester, for example). This
would lead to a slightly higher enrollment in more general
courses across the curriculum.
But Provost Connie Hungerford said it was clear from
the outset what the review does not mean.
"I want to be very emphatic that we are not talking
about cutting out classes that don't meet a certain enrollment threshold," she said. "We are emphatically not talking about slowing down the hiring of tenure track faculty."
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and
community relations, added, "I don't think there's any
thought that we should not have small classes or seminars.
And I don't think that anyone has an optimum idea of what
small is." Hungerford added that first-year seminars,
which the CEP decided to make mandatory last year, are
part of ensuring that a small class experience is part of

everyone's time at the college and that this philosophy was
at the core of a set of understood fundamental values CEP
does not seek to change.
The motivation for the review, almost all interviewed
for this article agreed, was not entirely financial. Still, as
Hungerford said, the issue comes down to "putting our
money where our highest priorities are." And if resources
are being used unwisely, "maybe we can recoup the money
to do what we'd rather do."
But the need to efficiently deploy resources was in part
fueled by the college's budget deficits and the current
unstable economic situation.
"It doesn't hurt," Eldridge said, "when the economy
shifts from one way to another, to make sure: Are we

October 23, 2003

spending our resources well." Hungerford added that the
need "to make sure" comes around every so often; the present economic worries were only a timely reminder.

Formative stages

Hungerford emphasized that nothing had been finalized, and that the process was only beginning. Above all,
the provost said, for the CEP and everyone involved, this
will require large amounts of learning, in terms of each
department's logic for the hiring of leave replacements and
enrollment caps, before any decisions are made. "We really are trying to learn what practice is, rather than having
a sense of what it should be, and a need to enforce that,"
she said.
According to professor Tim Burke, who sat on the CEP
for the last two years, "one of the permissible outcomes of
any committee investigation is that everything is fine."
Based on his experience with the committee, Burke said
the danger "may not be so potent" that those involved
believe a change
any change
must take place.
When it comes down to it, he added, academically
speaking, "I don't think there's anything weighing on us
that says, 'You better change or else.'
Right now, each department decides enrollment caps
for its courses.
"There might be perfectly good reasons for capping
enrollment" that each department holds, and those reasons might differ across the college, Hungerford said.
"Developing guidelines that everyone might agree are
appropriate," however, is one potential major change the
review is considering.
She added that departments might present rationales

ITS blocks file-sharing program use
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Students who wished to
download music or movies from

their favorite file-sharing applications this week opened their
programs only to find that they
were unable to.

Beginning Tuesday afternoon, Information Technology
Services blocked those on the
network from using peer-to-peer
applications, including popular
downloading programs like
KaZaA and Morpheus.
The block was put in place
after a few weeks of network
problems, ITS Client Service
Manager Robin Jacobsen said.
These problems involved the network being sluggish, especially
when accessing Web sites out-

Swarthmore
and
various

Internet
since
September.
When ITS first started to
investigate what systems were
slowing down the network, they

discovered a new peer-to-peer
application called Bit Torrent,

which was used by a group of
students.
BitTorrent opened multiple
connections instead of just a few,
causing the network firewall to
become overloaded, Jacobson
said.
In response to this, ITS sent
an e-mail to students informing
them of the problems with
BitTorrent and urging them not
to use it.
On Monday night, however,
the network was down again,

blocking access to external sites.

Jacobsen said that on Tuesday
morning, when ITS started to
investigate the problem, it found

"the firewall flooded by network

requests," this time caused by a
peer-to-peer application called
Blubster.

the block "will last until we [ITS]

"The first priority is to keep

Dumic said.
This week, ITS hopes to contact students whose computers
are generating the most traffic

and investigate other possible
reasons for the network sluggishness, such as students picking up viruses on their comput-

To help realize this, the college recently promoted Stephen D. Bayer to director of capital giving and hired Lisa C. Smith as the new director of

Bayer worked at Swarthmore as the director of

"My job is to identify money that is sitting

Smith works to convince the owners of these
funds that their money could be used to support
academic excellence at Swarthmore.
"Essentially, what I do is tell them how great
Swarthmore is," she said.
Although Smith has had professional experience at being persuasive, she is a self-proclaimed
bad liar. But, luckily, touting Swarthmore's merits
will not be challenging for her, because she says
she actually believes in them.
"It's a spectacular culture here," she said, "I felt
an amazingly warm embrace."

Dozens of chalkings inaugurated Coming Out Week 2003 this
Monday as the college kicked off five days of movies, talks and other
events sponsored by the queer community and a host of campus organizations.
The annual event, held around National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11,

is "all about letting people know there's a supportive community" for
students questioning their sexuality or considering coming out,
Swarthmore Queer Union board member Powen Shiah 'O6 said.
He said some of the events' organizers were making a conscious
effort this year to direct focus back toward supporting students.
"In the past, Coming Out Week has not always been focused on coming out," he said. "It has been more of a pride thing."
Community support, said Shiah, is very important, because "we live
in a heterosexual world. Coming Out Week is a chance for us to balance
that in the community." He added that Coming Out Week took on added
significance this year due to the vandalism of a SQU sign outside the
Intercultural Center three weeks ago. "The event is more pointed this
year," he said. "Increased awareness is more important."
A screening of the movie "Fire" opened the program on Monday, followed by a Queer-Straight Alliance discussion titled "How to Be an
Effective Ally to Someone Coming Out as Queer."
Ken Schneck, a professional comedian and assistant dean of student
affairs at Sarah Lawrence College, gave a talk on Tuesday entitled
"Coming Out Smiling." He discussed the lessons he had learned from
his painful experiences growing up homosexual in a conservative
neighborhood and coming out to a "conservadox" Jewish family.
"Coming out isn't a conscious decision to come out. Rather, it's a
decision not to lie anymore," he said.
Students expressed appreciation at the wide range of events being
held, but some hoped for deeper discussions.
"The Coming Out Week spirit is all about learning new things about
being queer, and it's been pretty cool so far," said Laura
Mecklenburger 'O7, who is a member of QSA and on the board of SQU.
"But there's' not enough dialogue. People haven't been talking that
much about what it makes them think."
Nonetheless, community reaction to Coming Out Week has been
strong. QSA and SQU member Elsita Kiekebusch-Steinitz 'O7 said that
"basically everyone" entering Sharpies on Tuesday had taken a sticker
in support of the week's activities.
Tonight's activities will include a 7:30 p.m. screening of "Trembling
Before G-d," a documentary on "the underground world of religious
gay people in Orthodox Judaism," which will be followed by a discussion of civil unions and gay marriage in Mephistos Lounge at 10 p.m.
On Friday, Wharton basement will become a stage for Salvadqrian
and Filipina rapper Jenßo at 9 p.m.
The annual Coming Out Week party will be held Saturday at 10 p.m

College spends more per student than similar schools

Professor's study finds disparity lies in number and size of course offerings
sure within the humanities division to look
at which classes have low attendance and

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

At the last Board of Managers meeting,
chemistry professor Paul Rablen presented
his findings that Swarthmore spends more
money per student than similar institutions. The money, Rablen found, went pri-

marily to academics.

Rablen had known that Swarthmore
spent more money per student than other
colleges, but he wanted to know where this
money went. While Swarthmore's tuition
is the same as the other schools he
researched, it has both a higher endowment and a smaller student body. Rablen
set out to find what other schools with similar rankings did to provide a good education without spending as much money.
Other colleges in the study spent less
money on each student, especially in academics. "That does not mean that they
spend less money total on academics, but
they do per student," Rablen said.

He also discovered that the college

offers "just about as many classes and class
sections as those other bigger schools,
despite Swarthmore's smaller size." As a
result, Swarthmore classes are often smaller. There are both fewer classes containing
more than 40 students and more classes
with only five or six students.
"I don't know that classes of five or six
are better than classes of eight," Rablen
said. "But it is inevitable if we offer this
many class choices."
Many

board members viewed Rablen's

findings in the context of recent discussion
about budget cuts, said professor Steven
Hopkins, a faculty observer to the board.
Although some members used the study to
make the case for enlarging the student body
or eliminating classes with low attendance,
most were encouraged by the findings.
"I think we ought to foreground this,"
Hopkins said. "It's a virtue." He said board
members agreed, hoping they could use
this study to show alumni the importance
of their donations.
"Students are able to take a course on
very specific things
that is what makes
our course catalogue wild and woolly.
That's what makes us different from
Amherst and Williams. The money should
continue to go in direction," Hopkins
added. He said he regretted the recent pres-

try to cut them.

Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, a student
observer to the board, emphasized the
value of smaller class sizes in a statement
to the student body. "We feel strongly that
one of the distinguishing features of the
college, a characteristic that makes us
truly competitive with schools like
Harvard and Stanford is its small size relative to its breadth of curriculum," he said.
Rablen examined how faculty course
loads compared to other colleges. He calculated this by comparing the number of faculty to the number of classes offered.
Surprisingly, he said, there was almost no
difference between course loads at each
school.

"Students are able to take
a course on very specific
things —that is what
makes our course catalogue wild and woolly."
Professor Steven Hopkins
"I have to say that the Swarthmore
experience is somewhat lumpier," he said.

"Our faculty teach more courses per semester, but our leave practice is different."
Although faculty at most colleges could
take time off every fourth year, at the other
colleges surveyed, most only took a semester off, while at Swarthmore it is customary to take a year off.
Another finding was that the three divisions at Swarthmore were relatively equally sized. Usually, humanities is the largest
division in terms of students enrolled,
classes offered and faculty involved, and
natural sciences only make up 25 percent.
The engineering department, unusual at
liberal arts schools, partially accounts for
this equality at Swarthmore.
The college also offers more lab courses,
which carry their own expense in terms of
setup and supplies.

Rablen compared Swarthmore to six

Paul Rablen found that the college offers as many classes as much larger universities.

but said they were "exactly the schools you
would expect us to be compared to, liberal

involved had to consent to being used in
the study and will receive a version of
Rablen's report shortly.
Although comparing small liberal arts
schools to universities may be like comparing apples and oranges because of the
vastly different resources and emphases
available, students feel that Swarthmore is
often in competition with larger universities for student matriculation.

In his statement, Rodriguez expressed
regret that the study did not include data
from schools "we consider to be competitors of Swarthmore, for example, Harvard,

Princeton, Yale and Pomona."

Much of the research is confidential,
because the data is complex and could easily be misinterpreted. "They [the other colleges] don't want data that is not public to
make them look bad," Rablen said.

Rablen completed the study through a

Mellon New Direction Fellowship during
his year off. The idea was backed by
President Al Bloom and a coalition with
the Expenditure Review Committee.

librarians, a profession that is often unflatteringly typecasted.

session on Oct. 28. The internships will begin in February
and will run during the spring semester for the next three
years. Four to six students will be admitted each semester
with special consideration given to members of the four
under represented groups.
The internships are an eight-week program that
includes work with different librarians around campus and
throughout Philadelphia, field trips, individualized projects within the library and a general exploration of professional library work. Interns will be paid for their work. In
addition, if a student wishes to continue or begin an internship over the summer, arrangements can easily be made.
Swarthmore anticipates alumni being instrumental in
coordinating internships that are far from the Swarthmore
campus. Over the three-year period, approximately 12 to 18
Swarthmore students will have the opportunity to work at
one of these selective internships.
The original library grant project began about three
years ago at Oberlin. It has been expanded since then to

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Bill would halt
tuition increase
BY EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS
DAILY TEXAN (U. TEXAS-AUSTIN)
A U.S. representative unveiled legislation
Thursday that would hold universities accountable
for

unreasonable
tuition
increases.
The
Affordability in Higher Education Act, sponsored by
Rep. Howard McKeon, R-Calif., would limit the rising cost of higher education as a part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.
"Our nation is grappling with a college cost crisis
that is threatening to push higher education out of
reach for low- and middle-income students," said
McKeon, chair of the 21st Century Competitiveness

The Mertz field now plays home to a construction site
for an a yet unnamed new residence hall, set to open for
student residents next fall.
Larry Briggs, who is construction company W. S.
Cumby's project manager for the new dorm, said the company has already completed excavation for the basement
and has poured fittings and the foundation for the building.
The company has also dug trenches in front of Mertz and
Old Tarble for lines of steam and chilled water, which will

provide the new dorm with the capacity for air conditioning for summer programs that require on-campus housing.

Associate Vice President for Facilities Management
Stuart Hain said 15 large trees had to be relocated to other
parts of campus, including near the tennis courts and on
the corner of Harvard Avenue and Chester Road. With 80
percent of the foundation walls complete, rerouting utilities to the new dorm makes up the majority of the company's work now, Hain said.
Briggs said the company's immediate goals are to grade
the basement floor, install the sanitary lines and to start
on the exterior walls of the first floor and the flooring.
Hain said he expects the structure of the first two floors to
be up by winter break.
In the spring, Hain said, the company will put the roof
on the building and complete the stone walls. "Before stu-

The college has $700,000 left to raise for the completion
of the dorm, according to Dan West, vice president ofalumni, development and public relations. Construction is funded by a combination of income from the student residents

through room rents, the use of budgeted funds for capital
improvements and gifts and pledges from donors, according to West.
"The dorm is in good shape with funding," said Vice
President for College and Community Relations Maurice
Eldridge '6L "We have very little left to raise and expect it
to be completed on time."
The dorm will have 75 rooms. Hain said there are four

types of dorm rooms: large and small singles and large
and small doubles. Seniors will get the large singles, and
sophomores will get large doubles. Included in these 75
rooms are six two-story, loft-style doubles and one suite
for a handicapped student with an adjoining room for the
student's aide.
The Phoenix reported in March that planned Parrish
renovations for next year will eliminate approximately 60
rooms on campus, leaving only a 15-room net increase with
the new 75 rooms.
The administration originally planned for the dorm to

have two L-shaped buildings to ease the housing crunch.
But Hain said the administration currently had no plans
for construction of the second building.

Subcommittee.
The act aims to promote consumer knowledge
and accountability for cost increases by establishing
a "College Affordability Index" that would compare
tuition increases to the rate of inflation. The information would then be made available to the public
through a "user-friendly" Web site.
If a university's tuition increases at more than
two times the Consumer Price Index over a threeyear period, it could lose federal funding from Title
IV of the Higher Education Act. Direct aid to students in the form of Pell Grants or Stafford Loans
would not be affected. But it could remove campusbased aid like Perkins Loans and work-study funds.
The American Council on Education has estimated that more than 1,400 institutions would have lost
federal funding in the last two years if the law had
been in effect.
"Such losses would be catastrophic," ACE
President David Ward said. "In only 48 months, this
bill would dismantle a system of higher education
that took this nation more than 200 years to build."
Opponents also fear the bill would fail to recognize the need of individual institutions to address
unique issues that can require a fluctuation in
tuition.

"The proposal is irresponsible because it disconnects tuition policies from considerations of education quality, access for low-income students, faculty
qualifications and class size," Ward said.
The legislation is still in its earliest stages, when
many changes can take place before leaving the committee to be heard before the full House. The Senate
is not expected to begin discussion on the matter
until next year.

Why War? resists Diebold, CEP reviews visiting

described himself as a legal consultant to SCDC.
"[Diebold is] taking advantage of the good faith lack of
judicial review in the safe harbor provisions of the
DMCA in order to threaten people without any legal
basis," he said. "This is a profoundly effective tool for
intimidation, because Diebold can issue these orders
without even getting a legal team involved."
Salmon has been in contact, on behalf of SCDC, with
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a legal group that
may represent those involved in any resulting legal

action.
But, according to Judy Downing, director of ITS,
for the college there was no other course of action.
"What we have said to the world is, in good faith, here
is what we are doing," she said. "We're not going to
we're going to have
play a cat-and-mouse game
integrity when we say these are the steps the college
has taken." Complying with safe harbor guidelines,
according to Gross, is the only way the college can

avoid legal liability.
Gross declined to comment on what action the college might take should it receive another cease-anddesist order.
Diebold did not return phone calls and has refused
to comment to other news organizations.

"We're not going to play a catand-mouse game we're going
to have integrity when we say
these are the steps the college
has taken."
Judy Downing,
ITS director
Looking ahead to legal issues
"The question of whether Diebold has a copyright
on these items
that's not a question," Salmon said.
Diebold does, in fact, hold such a copyright on these
items. "The question is whether reproduction of these
memos is a fair use of that copyrighted work." Using
the memos in the context of discussion and publicity,

as Why War? hopes to do, is legal, in the opinion of
Salmon and the EFF.
Four criteria generally determine fair use: first,
the purpose of reproducing such a work; second,
whether the work is factual or fictional; third, the
amount and substantiality of the excerpts from the
work; fourth, whether the fair use has a negative
impact on the marketability of the copyrighted works.
First, according to Salmon, these memos are critical to a national, political discourse, a purpose protected by copyright provisions. Second, factual works,
as the memos undoubtedly are, are accorded more lee-

way than fictional works. The third criteria, as well,
is generally applied to fictional works. It applies here
because the memos do not constitute a substantially
expressive work; they are a collection of facts, rather
than a cohesive, creative effort, but they are still less

likely to fall on legal ground. In terms of the fourth
criteria, since there was never a market for these
memos to begin with, their value is not adversely
affected by their reproduction.
Salmon said at yesterday's public meeting, hosted
by Gross and Downing, that, based on his knowledge
of the company's history, especially regarding copyrighted material, the cease-and-desist order amounts
to a bluff. Research done in the past at Rice and Johns
Hopkins Universities has resulted in Diebold threatening legal action; when groups at both schools
protested, Diebold backed down.
SCDC is considering a counter-notice against

Diebold. If one is filed, the corporation will have 14
days to file a court order in which they would argue
that their cease-and-desist order is legally justified.
Both Gross and Downing said the college was ready to
support such a counter-notice, but Salmon said it
would depend on whether legal representation, preferably of a pro bono nature, could be secured. Currently,
SCDC is looking for a more local group than EEF for
legal representation.
"These memos are primary evidence of gross criminal negligence on the part of Diebold, and, if publishing them is not fair use, if talking about them is not
legal under copyright law, then we're left in a position
where we can't talk about a fundamental failing in the
electoral process," Salmon said. "For them to suggest

that this is not fair use is ridiculous; this is exactly
what fair use was designed to protect."
Why War? responds

Should the counter-notice fail, one idea discussed

at yesterday's public meeting in Parrish Parlours was
to keep the memo going by passing it from one user to
another. This would leave the college's ISP not liable,

since it wouldhave no knowledge of the infringement.
As SCDC member Luke Smith 'O6 said, "We can't control the behavior of individual users."
White, adamant that Why War? would continue to
make the memos available, disagreed with the college's decision to take no official stance on the matter.
"Why is Swarthmore so concerned with staying on
the side of the law while being anti-democratic in the
process?" he asked. "I don't really care whether or not
it's copyright. If someone's copyrighted the fact that
Al Gore got negative 16,000 votes, then I think democracy trumps copyright."
In addition, only a small fraction of the more than
13,000 pages of memos have been examined. "There's

so much in here that we haven't found yet that it's a
necessity that we keep them up, so people can look
through them," White said. "[The content of the
memos] seriously calls into question democracy in
America," he said, adding that it was sad that in the
present political climate, "even Swarthmore will back
down over this issue."
Why War? will stay out of the legal situations that
may emerge from this because, White said, they miss
the point. "If anything warranted civil disobedience,
it's this action."
The dean insisted the college would take no further
steps. "The bottom line is, we feel the students have
legal recourse to achieve their objectives and a good
chance of succeeding," Gross said. "We hope they will
act in good faith to not jeopardize that success."

From CURRICULAR REVIEW, pg. 3
that are "wholly pervasive" and that all that will come out
of the review is an affirmation of those rationales. "When you're

looking at very small courses," Hungerford said, "it's useful to

ask what part they play."
Those courses that are writing-intensive or meant to be capstones are understood as requiring more professorial attention,

she added.
Overall, the provost sought to downplay the maximum effect
the review could have. "At this point, we're just trying to inform
ourselves. But I don't really think it's going to have a noticeable
impact on the curriculum," she said, adding that avoiding a
reduction in academic quality was "paramount."
In the end, "I don't think it will be apparent where we find the
savings," she said.

Leave replacements, not replacing leave

According to a recent study by professor Paul Rablen (see
story, pg. 5), Swarthmore professors maintain a higher course
load
five credits a year
than their colleagues at comparable
institutions. The college's leave policy, however, where tenured
and tenure-track faculty members receive a year of leave for
every four they teach, is more generous than at similar schools.
Instead of looking to change that system, the CEP review
decided to focus on the college's current, loose policy on hiring
leave replacement faculty.

"It doesn't hurt, when the economy shifts
from one way to another, to make sure:
Are we spending our resources well?" .
Vice President Maurice Eldridge
Burke said CEP, first of all, took up the broad category of alloresources. "Anything that fell under that heading
was of interest," he said. Leave replacement and class size issues
have since become the main focuses of the review so far.
In the case of some departments, it would be all but impossible to exist without leave replacements or visiting instructors
and professors. The theater department lists seven faculty members as visiting in this year's course catalog, and the same is true
for four of the six faculty members in the linguistics department.
Hopkins' story is representative of those professors who started off as visiting the college, then were found to offer something
Swarthmore lacked.
It is this aspect of the current leave replacement faculty policy
the diversity of ideas and people that visiting professors
can infuse and the option departments have to retain those peothat Hopkins is most worried could suffer if the
ple if it wishes
review calls for a significant change.
Looking again and again for more and more leave replacements, Hopkins acknowledged, can be exhausting, and
Hungerford recognizes that every department should be understood on its own terms.
Hopkins agreed, as well, that Swarthmore's curricular offerings match that of many larger universities, and the need for
smaller groups for research, the honors program and other core
values demand resources. But, on the whole, the ability of the
current leave replacement policy to infuse diversity was what
cating faculty

Hopkins emphasized most.
"That remains, I would think, an important aspect of this
whole system," he said. "The opportunity to draw someone into
the college who has something we didn't have before."
In a possible attempt to tighten leave replacement policies,
CEP runs the risk of passing on professors such as Hopkins and
situations like the one he found. For both the professor and the
college, the fit proved right in a long-term setting, not just in the
short term. Often, however, longer, more drawn-out periods,
such as Hopkins' six years in a hiring limbo, would be more difficult to maintain in a setting with tighter rules on visiting professors.

Burke pointed how pervasive the issue of leave replacement
faculty actually is. It stands as a pedagogical, financial, administrative and philosophical question all at once. In most respects,
he added, the college had done well in handling it up to now, and
that indicated well for the future.
"We don't rely on temporary adjunct-type professors as a pool
of cheap, experienced labor," Burke said.

Unorthodox relationships

Documentary explores conflict between sexual preference, religion for gay Orthodox Jews
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Some, however, have not greeted the documentary so
warmly.
'Trembling Before G-d' is a polemic arguing that the
Orthodox community should not just be more accepting
of people with homosexual attractions, but that it should
also be more accepting of homosexual behavior," wrote
"

Tonight's film screening by Ruach, the Swarthmore

Jewish student life organization, is sure to cause some
discussion on campus. The organization will show
"Trembling Before G-d," a documentary by Sandi
Dußowski on the experiences of homosexuals in
Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities, tonight at
7:30 p.m. in the LPAC Cinema.
"I think many times we assume that homosexuality is
completely at odds with traditional religion," said Ixel
Cervera 'O4, organizer of the event. "The documentary, I
believe, intends to point out that being frum [religious]
and being queer are not mutually exclusive."
"Trembling" tells the stories of several gay Jews, all
dealing with their homosexuality in different ways.
Subjects include lesbian high-school sweethearts in
Brooklyn, a married lesbian woman in Israel, a gay man
who has tried through therapy to change his orientation,
and Steve Greenberg, the first openly gay Orthodox rabbi.
"It is about how they relate to their community, how
the community treats them, the different levels at which
each is allowed to be out or discuss his or her sexuality,
and how Jewish institutions deal with homosexual mem-

bers," Cervera said.

The film has drawn both praise and condemnation

worldwide. It was granted many awards, including The
Teddy Award for Best Documentary at the Berlin Film
Festival, The Mayor's Prize for the Jewish Experience at
the Jerusalem Film Festival, and The Grand Jury Prize
for Best Documentary at OUTFEST Los Angeles. It broke
opening-day box office records at its debut at the New
York Film Forum.

Adam Jessel, a critic for the Jerusalem Post.
In a review entitled "Dissembling Before G-d," Avi
Shafran of Agudath Israel called the film's portrayal of
the rabbinical response to homosexuals "both incomplete
and distorted."

The most common complaint of the film's detractors,
in Jessel's words, is that "the film assumes that same-sex
attraction is irreversible, and therefore cannot be morally proscribed."
But organizers say controversy about the film comes
as no suprise.
"I expect that the reaction [on campus] will be everything from outrage to acclaim," Cervera
said.
'Trembling' intends to portray both the positive and
negative of the religious orthodox community, and I
expect the campus to reflect the things that touch closer
I think
to home about the religious community
'Trembling' is the type of film that causes questioning of
our behavior and that of the world around us."
The event was timed also to coincide with Coming Out
Week on campus.
"We wanted to use that to bring together different peoethnic,

THE PHOENIX

While hanging out in the admissions office the other
day (all right, you caught us
we were hitting on
specs), we threw an interesting piece of Swarthmore
College admissions propaganda in Mac's bookbag.
Unfortunately, Mac left his bookbag in the deep fat fryer
at Paces, so we had to spend several hours scalding our
hands while trying to get it out, at which point the
admissions propaganda had been thoroughly fried. As
we were trying to read it, all crispified, a troll grabbed
it and ran to Massachusetts.
This development necessitated an exciting fall break
road trip for us, filled with chin piercings, gun shopping
and run-ins with the Harvard police. But that's an

why they

asked us for our social security numbers when we
applied to Swarthmore.) Therefore, we dedicate this column to the various difficulties faced by the mysterious
quarter of the student body that is senior citizens
er,
uh, "chronologically advanced."
Note, please, the subtle difference between "Serfior
Citizen" and "Senor Citizen." Senor Citizen has a squiggly line above the "n" and comes from Mexico.
If you're a senior citizen, you might be wondering
about the best places around Swarthmore to purchase
items required for your basic senior citizen needs. You
might want to note that saying "Geritol" into the voice
recognition system will actually connect you to Gerrit
Hall, who will gladly help you. For all your medication
needs, I recommend you consult with Worth Health
Center or Michael's Pharmacy, or simply stop by
Willets if you happen to suffer from glaucoma. Also, as
far as we can tell, the Swarthmore Ville provides services exclusively for old people, so we recommend you
head down there to fill your cravings for cheese, crappy
haircuts and whatever they sell at "Occasionally
Yours."
From what we understand, loneliness can also be a
problem for many senior citizens. You should call your
parents if you need someone to talk to that badly. But
there are many options available here at Swarthmore. If
you're looking for people your own age, we'd recommend the Board of Managers. Swarthmore also provides
a variety of clubs and activities that old people are
interested in, such as folk dancing, the Knit Wits and
the baroque ensemble. And don't forget, the enlightened
staff at Pub Nite gives a sl-off discount for seniors.
One reason senior citizens might feel uncomfortable
on Swarthmore's campus is that the young majority of
students is not making the campus a welcome environment. Why not make a quarter of the songs at Paces parties something old people can Charleston to? Why not
spike punch with Fixodent? Why label their fondest
memories as "history class"? Don't answer the questions. They're rhetorical'.
Finally, we've concluded that this vast population of
senior citizens must live off campus, judging by the conspicuous absence of old people in dorms. We'd like to
encourage you fogeys to join the melting pot that is
dorm life. Imagine attending bingo study breaks, fighting with other students over whether to watch "The
Simpsons" or "Murder, She Wrote," and having people
yell at you to quit cranking the Sinatra at six in the
morning.

Tolerable 'Cruelty'

KILL
THAT

BY ESTER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu
Divorce is funny! Or at least it is in La-La Land, L.A., where
women spend sunny day after sunny day congregated
around pools granted to them as part of extensive settlements,
and men are all vain, aging and rich.
That's the conceit of "Intolerable Cruelty," a postmodern
screwball comedy influenced as much by the 1940s as the 19905.
Men are silly, women are silly, and marital unions between
them could not possibly be taken seriously.
Ultimately, though, the film seems to say that they should be.
Men and women, however Botoxed and flawed, are doomed to be
lonely if left alone. Despite its darkly humorous, even cynical
commentary on true love, "Intolerable Cruelty" agrees with its
hippie soundtrack that love is all you need.
Instead of adding complexity to the film, that underlying
message makes the film uneven: funny in some sequences,
moralistic in others. It is at first bitter, and then romantic, but
finally Botoxed and flawed itself.
The fault lies, perhaps, in the film's childhood. "Intolerable
Cruelty" is the product of divorce and subsequentremarriage of
some of its original creators, including Brian "A Beautiful
Mind" Grazer, with Joel and Ethan "The Big Lebowski,"

previous hits, now no longer interested in violence as
a vehicle for revelations about character, or whatever

was revealed by "Pulp Fiction."
In "Kill Bill," the sequences of bloodshed follow at
such a rapid and constant clip that they themselves
serve as the revelations; one battle, ultimately, leads
to nothing but another with more bloodshed and a bigger body count. And while the MPAA took a bold step

in letting this thing off with an R rating, this is part of
the point: nothing in "Bill" is worse than certain
sequences in "Saving Private Ryan" except the manner in which Tarantino makes us get such a fantastic
rush. In "Ryan," every severed limb emitted a sense of
loss; not so with the top of Lucy Liu's head.
By mastering violence in film, Tarantino also subverts it.
There is always a twist with these one-after-another
fight scenes: one is presented in iiber-gory, supremely
cool anime, while another offers a few more severed
limbs. Still, the formula remains in place throughout
as opposed to all this violence supposedly telling us
something about a story, characters, something normal and narrative to which we can relate, all it gives is
more violence and then even that gets normal. The
thing for Tarantino is the challenge of filming a fight
scene that, somehow, tops the one that preceded it.
That he succeeds throughout is more a testament to

!

"Kill Bill: Volume One," which pretentiously presents itself as "The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino"
in its opening credits, was met with the expected reactions across the American media spectrum. Most critics
like Peter Travers from Rolling Stone or Roger
Ebert loved it. Then there was The New York Times,
unwilling to offer "Kill Bill" a kind word. The film
seemed too hollow for The Times, too much, as critic
A.O. Scott put it, an exercise simply in style.
Well, tough. Yes, the story is deceptively simple.
Uma Thurman (Black Mamba, or simply The Bride)
wants to avenge the death of her fiancee and seven
other wedding party members four years ago at the
hands of Bill (David Carradine) and his Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad (the illogical "DiVAS" for short).
Thurman herself once was a DiVA and had ties to Bill
that might have been other than strictly professional.
Injuries from the attack on the wedding party leave
The Bride in a coma. When she awakes, her mission is
as simple as the title. Laying out a sheet of paper in
front of her on a plane from America to Okinawa,
Japan, she writes down the four members of the squad
she must kill, with Bill at the end as the fifth victimto-be. The Bride only gets to her first two targets in
"Volume One"; she'll deal with Darryl Hannah and
Michael Madsen, as well as Bill himself, in the film's
second half, which will show up early next year.
But, despite The Times' lukewarm piece (they
seemed more determined not to judge the film, fearing
what it might mean if they admitted they liked it),
"Kill Bill" is one of the most important films released
in a while, for three reasons.
First, in Scott's criticism of the piece, he sniffed at
how Tarantino seemed to have reversed position from

the deranged depths to which the former video rental
store clerk can take his mind, but that's fine.
For the origin of O-Ren Ishii, Liu's character (a former DiVA and the second target on the list), the movie
switches to anime
a tip of the hat to that genre,
which is invested in origin stories to begin with.
More, this violent event is meant to explain every-

thing about O-Ren

what happens before and after is

understood. The violence is all we need in order to
know the character, and look here at how Tarantino
has subverted the usual action movie logic: The violence is the point here, whereas your usual action
movie pretends its violence means something or
moves the plot along. Really, most action movies want
to be "Kill Bill": violence that leads to violence that
leads to violence, until all the Yakuza fighters are dead

and dismembered.
"Kill Bill" is the ultimate, logical, grotesque extension of the American action film, but of so many more
genres as well: the Samurai picture, the spy movie, the
spaghetti Western. The logic of each of these films dictates making bloodshed truly the main event, as
opposed to the manner in which the film's plot gets
told. The violence they make us crave, and the weaving of that violence inextricably with story, is a device
"Kill Bill" beautifully, hilariously, frighteningly
points out

a half.

and teases through its harrowing hour and

Tarantino combines all these genres, reducing even
the suburban family scene to a vicious, opening battle
sequence. .Vivica A. Fox (Copperhead, as she was
known when a DiVA member) and Thurman fight
with knives, only to be interrupted by Fox's daughter
getting home from school in a big, yellow school bus.
The "normal" narrative, family life in the suburbs,
gets in the way of the real one, and at the end, Fox is
dead and Thurman is faced with Fox's child, who witnessed the murder. And we get it: We see the mess that
comes of mixing a life of violence with "real" life, or,
in film, of one genre with another. The effect, in
Thurman's face alone, is haunting.
Lastly, there is the gender bending, or, maybe more
accurately, the commentary on film in its most blatantly gendered form. There were scenes in "Kill Bill"
of such blatant consumption of the female form, by the
audience and others
the camera stays on
Thurman's bloodied face and clean feet (in separate
scenes) for eons
that it is ultimately commenting on
that consumption. The audience is affronted with its
own voyeurism in, again, a kind of parody; watch
Tarantino's steadiness with his camera during these
shots
this is how you can be sure.
Perhaps "Kill Bill" is not so unique in its offering
of so many ideas about film. I'm sure there are more
provocative films out there about the movie medium
that's not what I'm saying here. But that "Kill Bill"
will be seen on such a wide scale (it opened at number
one at the box office last week, pulling in an unthinkable $24 million, and had $43.3 million as of the end of
this weekend), by such a mainstream audience,

cements its importance.

October 23, 2003

The Coen brothers had never worked on a film for which
they did not develop the story, write the script, direct and pro-

duce. In agreeing to work on someone else's vision, they may
have proven themselves open-minded. But they also took a leap
that has landed "Intolerable Cruelty" in Misfireville, in the company of directors Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg's failed
experiment "A.1."
Like "A.1.," "Intolerable Cruelty" is studded with some fantastically memorable characters and some cardboard cutouts so
old they're sprouting mold. Fortunately, the lead characters are
the former. George Clooney plays a slick divorce lawyer with
radioactively white teeth brought, via a divorce in which he represents her husband, in contact with Catharine Zeta-Jones.
Clooney, bored with his single, affluent, risk-free life, abandons his principles and falls in love with Zeta-Jones at first
sight. He fancies he sees the heart of gold within the gold-digger,
and he seeks to make an honest woman out of a fallen one. ZetaJones (literally) gives him a run for his money.
The screenplay keeps the couple well supplied with zingers,
1940's style, which keeps the professional marriage-breaker and
the professional wife bantering. It's clear that they are perfect
for each other. The background characters that advance the plot
are more of a mixed bag. The Botox babe characters, all of who
advise Zeta-Jones against starting a real romance, have sold
their souls for elective surgery and real estate.
Billy Bob Thornton, one of Zeta-Jones's conquests, a chatterbox cowboy from a Texas oil regime, is a notable exception. He
chews on scenery with his mouth open, pours barbecue sauce
on it, and chews some more. He's so delightedly, unselfconsciously funny that he nearly steals the movie from Clooney.
There's so much potential in "Intolerable Cruelty" that it's
hard to believe it doesn't quite work, or to understand the failure. Some of the plot twists work in classic screwball comedy
form; others muddle the narrative or aren't plausible.
But the biggest problem with the film is its inconsistency of
tone. It doesn't know whether it is a Hollywood movie or
whether it's commenting on Hollywood movies, whether it's
mainstream or indie, whether it's about love in our society or
apathy. And at the end of the moviegoing experience, after
investing that all time, the viewer walks away disappointed
and doesn't even get to keep the house, the Jag and the pool.

Euripides'

classic tragedy "Medea" will bring these issues to life
Friday and Sunday in the unique setting of the Scott
Amphitheater. Veronica Betancourt 'O6 and Eliza Cava 'O6

directed this production.

"Medea" tells the story of Medea and her husband
Jason (of Jason and the Argonauts fame). Though she
assists him in his various quests on their way to Greece,
he leaves her for King Creon's daughter. The bulk of the
play revolves around Medea's decidedly feminist plan for
revenge.
"Medea is such a strong character," co-director
Betancourt said. "She's not just a woman who's been done
wrong. She's very assertive and is not a woman of her era
She takes extra measures to get what she wants."
Chosen for the complex and emotionally charged starring role was first-time actor Katie Chamblee 'O7.
"I knew the play, and I liked it," Chamblee said. "I
thought I'd audition on a whim. It was the first week of
school and I thought I'd try something new."
Despite her inexperience, the atmosphere on the set
was more nurturing than intimidating for Chamblee.
Working with more experienced people has "definitely
been a challenge, because I feel everyone in the cast is so
good and talented, but I feel I learn a lot from everybody. I
had a lot of trouble at the very beginning. Medea is a very
emotional character. That was the hardest part, [pulling]
those emotions out of myself. When I get upset, I naturally try to suppress it. It's hard to be hysterical onstage."
Betancourt and Cava worked diligently to bring
...

THE PHOENIX

Chamblee out of her shell
"They'd make me scream during warm ups. They
talked to me a lot about the character," Chamblee said.
Rehearsals ran for several hours every day, and Chamblee
soon grew comfortable with the script. She did not find the
lines difficult to memorize, as "they make so much sense.
It's such a compelling play. I used to play in pit orchestras
in high school and I used to memorize the lines!"
As the rehearsals progressed, Chamblee said she
learned more and more about the acting process.
"I never knew how much it required, especially emotionally. I found out how much it takes from you, in a good
way. ["Medea"] was written so long ago, but it's still so
applicable. It's emotionally potent. The idea that I can feel

the same feelings as a woman in ancient Greece is amazing ... [Medea] is a great character. I have a lot of respect
for her. Even though she expresses herself in a very violent way, her emotions are universal," she said.
Chamblee's co-star lan Flora 'O5, starring in the role of
Jason, responded positively to Chamblee's work.
"What she lacks in experience she makes up for in
enthusiasm and a willingness to participate," he said.
Flora was previously seen as Bernie in 2002's "Sexual
Perversity in Chicago" and as Phipps in "An Ideal
Husband" in the spring of 2003. Compared with his previous work, Flora says that Jason is "a lot bigger than the
other characters I've played here. This is the only tragic
role I've played at Swat. His position at the end allows me
to act out emotions that I've never gotten to do before."
Elaborating on his character, Flora said, "Jason is the
deposed prince of lolcus. He's a man with a great reputation who doesn't deserve it as much as the other heroes do.
He's looking to increase his station in life for him and his

mother, however, is flying in from New Mexico to attend
the production. "I'll have one person rooting for me, at
least," he joked.
For the two co-directors, the progression of "Medea"
from concept to reality has moved quickly.
"The idea was conceived last semester, in the beginning of April," Betancourt said. She and Cava were bored
with school and pitched the idea of staging a play in the
amphitheater. The two planned for the play's final scene to
go on while the sun sets behind the amphitheater.
"We held auditions the second week of school and started rehearsals soon after that," she said. "It's been a very

"It's too early
"In terms of acting and staging, we're on schedule.
Everyone's off-book at this point. Right now we're getting
scenery and costumes done."
Cava said she was anticipating the work ahead. "I get
stressed thinking about all the sleep I won't be getting this
week," she added.
But, there is one caveat that neither director can do
much about—the weather. Since the play is staged outdoors during sunset in the amphitheater, the directors
strongly recommend that the audience dress in accordance with the weather. Each also expresses the fear of
being rained out. "It's why I pray at night," said
Betancourt.
"Medea" will be performed in the Scott Amphitheater
Friday, October 24 at 4:30 p.m. and Sunday, October 26 at
3:30 PM. The play runs 90 minutes without intermission.

the result of laziness, but I find that irreconcilable with
the level of craftsmanship that marks album. What makes
sense: "Seven's Travels" is the hip-hop White Album.
I guess that's a rather bold statement in some circles,
and not all of its implications hold up exactly. For one
thing, it's at least twenty minutes shorter than the White
Album. Outkast notwithstanding, the hip-hop doublealbum is still a risky proposition. And I'm not trying to
make any claims about classic status. As an outpouring of
creativity and personality and invention though,
Atmosphere's newest is easily equal to "The Beatles."
Actually, it's probably more consistent in quality than the
often excessive White Album (and certainly than
"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below") which is not to say the
peaks are as high as either of those more adventurous
albums. It's similarly eclectic from straight-up old school
jams like the poppy "Reflections" and the lush, soulstyled, sample-rich "Denvemolorado," to the jazzy-funky
bass and drum "Shoes" to genre-widening experiments
like the punk-rap of "Suicidegirls" and the bizarre shuffle
"Gotta Lotta Walls."
It's at least as accessible thanks equally to Ant's original, wonderfully melodic productions and Slug's immediately appealing lyrical approach. His technical skills as
an MC are nothing special, but his conversational diction
and keen sense of narrative make his rhymes direct and
personal. "Seven's Travels" is also highly inviting in the
sense of community it establishes. Most of these tracks
feature guest contributions (vocals, guitars, keys,
jawharp, and so on), and Slug's lyrics are full of references to life in a tightly-knit scene, but are broad enough
in scope to encompass classic hip-hop as well as mid-'9os
punk icons Lifter Puller. Especially touching is a bouncy

half of the songs on "UFO." The rest continue in the
same vein, or maybe they get weirder and more eclectic.
I know that some of them are longer.
"UFO" is more cohesive than it sounds. It's both a better studio record and a better representation of NNB's

working in Philadelphia these days. We ought to have
them play at Olde Club again, like they did two years ago.
They are masterful instrumentalists, but that's only a little bit of what makes them so exciting. You might imagine
that they are willfully absurd and freaky in a contrived
and unsubtle way, but they play with such passion and
exuberance that it becomes obvious this is just the way it
has to be. Spaz is for everyone.
Need New Body will be at the Theatre of Living Arts

Since Elvis hit the scene in the late 19505, blue-eyed
soul has slowly emerged and established itself as another facet of R&B music. Elton John carried on the tradition most notably with 1973's "Benny and the Jets." In
the mid to late '9o's soulful crooner Jon B. made his presence known in the genre, and the new millennium has
ushered in such artists as Justin Timberlake and Thicke.
Another young blue-eyed soul singer developing a career
in the genre is the talented Remy Shand.
The Canadian-born Shand's debut album, entitled The
Way I Feel, garnered less than stellar publicity in 2002,
but still managed to gain the critical acclaim it deserved.
The album, which Remy began to write at the age of 19,
caught the ear of Motown President/CEO Kedar
Massenburg. With the label's help, Remy was able to
bring his music to the U.S. market. The Way I Feel was
sung, produced, mixed, and engineered all by Shand at
his home in Winnipeg and took four years to create.
The Way I Feel is an extremely relaxing listen, with
hints of jazz and
blues in choice
songs. It comes as
no surprise that
the album emits
the vibe that classic Motown is
known
for, as
Shand has been

(a

pioneered) and in (Motown Records, 2003)
the song "I Met
Your Mercy" where the deep yet raspy singing evokes a
sense of yearning much like The Isleys' work.
Shand's lyrics read like poems and are poignant in
their simplicity. The last track on the album, "The
Mind's Eye," showcases his writing skills more than his
vocal ability. He sings, "I remember when uninspired /
conversation could fuel my fire / lookin' at me so heavy
handed / would loosen my strain / together as one the
body is gone / although it hasn't disappeared / I'll be the
one to set like the sun." Shand's use of literary elements
such as metaphor displays his conscious effort to develop songs with meaning about love. Different perspectives
of love are the recurrent theme of the 11-track album.
The title track, an admission to the singer's love-struck
state and a showcase for a soothing instrumental break
in the middle, stands in stark contrast to the somber tone
of "Burning Bridges", a song about the fear of love.
Bitterness of love lost can be heard on the track "The
Second One," while the happiness the emotion brings is
found in the smooth "Rocksteady." Throughout the
whole album, one can tell that each lyric exudes a distinct emotion and the actual music is a pleasant bonus to
the easy listening experience. While Remy has been off
the radar for months, he's back in the studio recording
and has already completed a new song, "A Day in the
Shade." While the direction of his new project remains
unclear, if his new song is any indication, this blue-eyed
soul singer will be around 'for years to come.

The good fight
It's a rare event when the college, well-known academic institution that it may be, finds itself smack in the
middle of national-level news. Since the heady times of
the 1960s wound to a close, our bubble has remained relatively intact; activists have continued to shout to make
their voices heard, yes, but rarely have they heard any
response.
We have a response now.
By now anyone at Swarthmore who's peeked out of
McCabe since break knows the story of the Diebold corporation and the threat its ineptitude and corruption
pose to the integrity of the country's democratic process.
This is not the first time the issue has been raised, and
this campus is certainly not the place where the issue
will be settled, but when Why War? and SCDC chose to
host Diebold's internal memos on a Swartnmore server,
Swarthmore became, for now, the focus of the conflict.
This is a relatively new situation for the administration. Swarthmore students have defied authority in the
name of their values before, but almost always it was in
the case of a protester arrested for an unpermitted
march. No serious damage was done; the penalties were
mild; the threat to the college as an institution was minimal, and it could sit back and let students fight the good

"The Night of the Living Blob."

fight.

The new world of information technology has
changed that. The college now finds itself in the uncomfortable role ofan Internet service provider caught in the
middle of a standard Digital Millennium Copyright Act
case, staring down the barrel of a wealthy, politically
infuential corporation's legal threats. By purchasing
server space and letting students use it, the college has
become involved, and it has had to make the difficult but
ultimately sound choice of complying with the cease-

and-desist.
Our administration is going above and beyond the
call of duty; while it must comply with the letter of the
law in the form of the DMCA, it has also taken steps
toward taking a legal stance on this issue by supporting

a potential student counter-notice to challenge Diebold's

copyright claims. Many another college, larger, richer

and less interested in its students, would simply turn off
network access for offending students and leave it at
that, safe from controversy.
Still, this leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of some
students. It is important to remember, though, that as
much as some of us would like to have the comforting
institution of the college standing beside us in our struggles, its mission as an educational institution is to above
all protect its own existence so it can serve all its students' interests. Much of the time it can only stand
behind us in support, or even merely step out of our way.
In this case, we doubt any Swatties count themselves
on Diebold's side, but as with all moral crusades we must
remember and respect people and institutions' decisions
about how much they are willing to risk.

Analytic flaws don't make John Lott a fraud
enough depth that detailed analytical questions could be

Dear Editor:
I respond to the letter of Joshua Kramer 'OO ("Lott study
fraudulent,- damaging," Oct. 9, pg. 14) about John Lott's lecture on campus on Sept. 29, in which Kramer states that
Lott is "a fraud" and that it was "disgusting" and "did damage" that the Department of Mathematics and Statistics
allowed such a "hack" on campus. As the math professor
who suggested we invite Lott, let me respond.
Kramer basically says: Some other scholars have said
there are errors in Lott's work that are egregious.
Therefore he is disreputable and a fraud. However, what
one has to understand about attempts to study large social
phenomena like crime is that the data are very large and
complex, and even efforts by the most careful scholars can
and will have flaws or errors in them. That's why you publish and make your data sets available so that other scholars can look for mistakes and help us all get closer to the
truth. Sometimes errors or failure to consider certain
interpretations will seem egregious to some other careful
scholars. That does not make the author a disreputable
fraud.
Get 1,000 pages of the best evidence about the most
straightforward event, and still lots of things won't agree.
The question is, "How much doesn't fit?" Good investigators know when a conclusion is consistent enough to bear
belief, and statisticians can, upon close study, judge when
an analysis merits attention. The fact is, if one goes digging
for flaws in any large data analysis, as one probably should
for a study by anyone on guns, one is going to find some
flaws.
But here we get to my disappointment with Lott's presentation. I had asked him to concentrate on the statistical
issues. Unfortunately, he devoted only perhaps 10 minutes
of his talk to this sort of approach, and he did not do so in

October 23. 2003

asked. So my disappointment is that I feel I have no more
basis now to judge the strength of Lott's evidence than I did
before his talk.
I should further state that I suggested we invite Lott
because I know him. He lives in town, and his sons and
mine are in Boy Scouts together. He and I have had a number of chats where I have listened to his life story and his
thoughts about his work. He is personally very pleasant,
interested in other people and gentle. My impression is
that Lott is by nature a backroom econometrician who got
into gun control issues almost by chance without an initial
agenda and who was taken aback by the ferocious response
to his conclusions, including death threats. His fighting
responses, while understandable, have not always been
wise. For instance, he certainly made a fool of himself by
going online pretending to be his own former student,

which Lott has since publicly said was a mistake.
But, for the sake of argument, let's assume my reading
of Lott is far too generous, and that Kramer, who doesn't

know him, is right that Lott is a biased propagandist who
would falsify data to mislead us. That personal information
still wouldn't prove that all his statistical analyses are
wrong! If even some of them are right, or possibly right
pending more study, that is something all of us in a gunladen society need to know about. (Ironically, Kramer likes
Lott's conclusions but thinks Lott is a bad guy. I tend to
think Lott is a good guy, but I hope his conclusions are
wrong.) Again, my disappointment with the lecture is that
we didn't get close enough to analyzing the statistical
work. Kramer's intemperate objection to the lecture misses this central point.

Europe gets a new kind of 'Net
Let me tell you a
story.
I remember that, way
back when I was a kid,
one of my favorite
things to do was to go
down to work with my
dad. Dad works at the
Detroit Institute of Arts,
a big museum in the
middle of Detroit, as a
photographer. I remember going into work with
him, when he'd go in on
EVAN HENSLEIGH
weekends or when we'd
come to pick him up.
While he'd take photoTechnological
graphs, I got to play with
-I^^mm^^^^^^^^^^^m
the computers.
Of course, this was 1987. The personal computer was
still new, and the first graphical computer was younger
than I was. I wasn't using one of those.
No, I got to play with a terminal
a keyboard and a
lovely little screen with glowing green letters on it.
There was no processor, no hard drive: all this terminal
did was serve as a screen and keyboard for a mainframe, a giant computer I imagined as a huge, polished
black box, housed somewhere in a reverently lit chamber in the bowels of the museum, with lots of flashing
lights and readouts, emanating bizarre beeps and clicks
and a healthy electrical hum.
There weren't any games for the mainframe; I mostly amused myself with the frustrating copy of
WordPerfect (it was bad even back then!), and I remember being amazed at how much easier it was than my

Misfit

typewriter (it never jammed!).
Of course, those days are gone forever. We don't use

terminals anymore,

we use PCs
the mainframe is
dead. Indeed, Virginia Tech is currently testing its new
mainframe-range supercomputer made of a large array
of Mac desktops, and, less than a year ago, the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) constructed a supercomputer, in a move that must have

letters

humiliated mainframes everywhere, out of an array of
store-bought Play Station 2's. The best thing about
arrays like this, of course, is that if you want to make
them faster, you just add more Play Stations.
Or is the mainframe dead? Inspired, no doubt, by the
efforts of the NCSA and Virginia Tech, the European
Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) thinks otherwise. It has encountered problems in their research
beyond the computational ability of any of the computers it can get its hands on (and that's a lot of them), so
it's aiming to go one better and (with the help of the EU)
build the "EuroGrid."
Euro Grid will capitalize on high-speed broadband
connections on the existing Internet to bring computers at research facilities across Europe together as
never before possible. Instead of just letting people at
each computer access the hard drives of others (as the
Internet lets us do now), these computers will share
processors. In other words, the intent is nothing short
of creating a large array of PCs across the whole continent
a mainframe the size of Europe.
The potential for the EuroGrid is enormous. Now,
instead of merely being able to share information
across the Internet, we'll be able to share clock cycles,
linking our home computers into something akin to a
giant computer.
A couple things are immediately apparent from this
new model for the Internet. First of all, Web sites will
be able to make a major shift
since servers will now
be able to serve their processor as well as their hard
drive, they can become platform-independent. What
software you are running will be less important. It will
be possible to serve the whole site to your computer,
already processed and ready to appear on your screen,
removing many of the current limitations on Web
design. It will be a new kind of Web. Moreover, it will
now be possible to sell very cheap terminal-style computers again, and instead of relying on your computer's
own CPU, you'll buy processor power off the Internet.
So who knows? Maybe our kids will get to play with

a terminal, too.

Stop smoking

No need for provocation

Dear Editor:

Dear Editor:

Smoking at Swarthmore is a privilege and not a right. As such, the college has laid out in excruciating detail
where smoking is and is not permitted.
"Smoking is prohibited in all public
spaces throughout the College," the
Student Handbook informs us, and violators will face a "$25 fine in addition
to other potential penalties."
Why, then, is smoking tolerated in
Paces, Olde Club, the WRC, the fraternities, Wharton D basement and even
fire-hazard Upper Tarble during parties? A good number of students on
this campus have allergies, disorders,
disabilities and aversions to tobacco
and are therefore forced to avoid parties, Paces Cafe and Pub Nite. A good
number of students, with their inhibitions lowered by alcohol, pick up a cigarette at parties and become regular

We would like to express our
concern about the recent chalkings meant to increase campus
awareness of Coming Out Week.
We feel that several of these messages defeat the purpose of the
event. Coming Out Week, as far
as we understand it, aims to create an atmosphere of tolerance
and comfort for people who are
questioning their sexuality as
well as one of support for those
who may currently conceal their
sexual orientation. Although we
believe in the goal of increasing
openness about sexuality, it

smokers.
For a school that cares enough
about our health to require both physical education classes and a swimming
test as prerequisites for graduation,
the silent tolerance of the activity that
is still America's largest killer is
astounding. It is time that all students
are able to go to Paces without fear of
an allergic reaction, that all students
can sit in Olde Club without reeking of
tobacco and that all students who violate the terms already on the books pay
the required $25 fine.
Abigail Frost 'O4

THE PHOENIX

seems somewhat counterproductive to chalk the campus in this
manner. The nature of the chalk-

ings is aggressive and frequently
inappropriate; it serves to create
a tension and a separation
between two communities at
Swarthmore. Although the queer
community is in some ways a
distinct entity and a valuable
resource for LGBT students, it
does not need to further distinguish itself through radically
inappropriate public messages,
from the college community as a

whole. Not

only does it have the

potential to alienate the straight
population, but it also accentuates divisions within the queer
population between those who

support radical, in-your-face
activism and those who take a
more laid-back approach.
Especially after this month's
incident involving the IC sign,
we should not be taking actions
that further perpetuate the Us
versus Them mentality that
seems to have developed between
the queer and straight communities. For instance, one chalking,
on the path down to Sharpies,

reads, "10% is not enough
recruit,
recruit,
recruit!"
Whether this message was meant
in jest or not, it undeniably promotes a competitive outlook on
relations between the two communities and creates a division
that does not have to exist.
Instead of provoking tension in
this manner, gay and straight
students should work together to
lessen the stigma associated with
being openly queer.
We would like to commend
...

SQU and QSA for their efforts in
coordinating Coming Out Week.

These groups embrace the noble
goal of helping queer students
become more comfortable with
themselves and their sexuality;
let's just be sure that we stick to
that goal.

Star Trek's "Borg" would gain the whole galaxy.
Organization man's organization is the North America
bureaucracy of managers, technicians and mechanics tha

Now, in the aftermath of Manifest Destiny, he would gain th

"White supremacy" means that the Anglo-Saxon didn
lose his soul, because he gained North America not of hi
own free will, but as an agent of God's will. Because geno
cide and slavery were acts of providence, his conscience i
clear. Even today, he has no guilty conscience and is there
fore dismissive of the idea of paying reparations to th
descendants of the enslaved Africans. By dint of "whit
supremacy," he's beyond conscience. His New World Order
as the aftermath of Manifest Destiny, is no less sanctionec
by God. But whereas Manifest Destiny was providential, th
New World Order is scientific. Of this mechanistic behe
moth, the cardinal virtue is efficiency. Conscience is ineff
cient. Thus, it is the antithesis of science.
The man of science ignores Jesus's dilemma by divorcin
action and thought, science and conscience. He believes
with Machiavelli, that the end justifies the means. In
word, he compartmentalizes. Thus, he dehumanizes human
ities such as politics, psychology and philosophy into "socia
sciences" such as "political science," behavioral psycholog
and analytic philosophy. Ethics and free will have no plac
in the "social sciences," which aren't humanities precisel
because they aren't about humanism, but rather mecha

but like a dog he is within range of scientific analysis."
But conscience transcends science. Ethics trumps pol
tics and economics. Free will thrusts man beyond the rang
of "scientific analysis." One must contrast the cold mechan
ical cognition of the man of science (1.Q.) to the cool ethica
intuition of the man of conscience (finesse). The forme
lives a life of easy efficiency. The latter, whose humanism i
at odds with mechanism, whose conscience is not docile t

face of corporate bureaucracy. He wants knowledge, not th

thus circumspect; not scientific, thus myopic. With regarc
to Jesus's moral dilemma, the man of science, the bureau
crat, the member of the corporate American "Borg," take
his cue from the WASP. He compartmentalizes. The man o
conscience takes Jesus's dilemma seriously. He agonizes. T

The survey's introduction
reports, "The bottom has fall

in most of the Muslim

the depressing fact that the
populations of many Islamic countries have more confi
dence in Osama bin Laden to do the right thing than they
have in George W. Bush. Views of America have not wors
ened only in the Islamic world, though. The introduction

reports, "Since last summer [the summer of 2002], favorable
opinions of the U.S. have slipped in nearly every country for
which trend measures are available." Not surprisingly
much of the rise in anti-American feeling is attributed to the
war in Iraq.
That the world is more anti-American than ever leaves
me with mixed feelings. The United States is the world's
most powerful country by far, and the world's most powerfu
country will always inspire resentment, no matter how
benevolent or principled it is. After the collapse of the Sovie
Union, therefore, it was inevitable that anti-Americanism
would eventually grow. In addition, if the government is pur
suing a policy that it sincerely views as the best one, it hard
ly seems appropriate that it should change that policy
because of world opinion; after all, we elect our leaders to be
just that
leaders.
Yet it saddens me that I may live my life in a world tha
views America and Americans with hostility and suspicion
U.S. leaders should not make world opinion their policy

guide, but surely they should also avoid actions that make
the world more polarized and make peace and prosperity
everywhere less likely.
From a pure realpolitik standpoint, America is less
secure without effective international cooperation in deal
ing with terrorism and other global security issues. From a
moral standpoint, one ofAmerica's great strengths is that i
is a country built on an idea
an idea of liberty and free
dom. There is something deeply wrong when vast segments
of the world population view the president of the Unitec
States as less trustworthy than an evil terrorist leader.
It is tempting to view the latest poll as merely a blip tha
will go away as memories of the invasion of Iraq fade. Iraq
though, is only a part of a pattern of actions that have
increased the world's hostility toward the United States
Most administrations have angered the world from time to
time; this one, though, has given the distinct impression that
it does not really care about the rest of the world. Like Bush
Bill Clinton took military action against Iraq and failed to
enact the Kyoto accords on global warming, but unlike Bush
Clinton did not have his secretaries make dismissive
remarks about "old Europe" or proclaim that the Unite(
States had "no interest" in making the Kyoto accords law.
Better P.R. could definitely help, but there are deeper
problems with the U.S. image in the world today that may
not have any easy solutions.
A Democratic president might take more care not to
offend the world with his rhetoric, might put more faith in
the United Nations and might try to repair some of the ol(
links with some of the western European nations
links
that have been severely strained by Bush. All these actions
would be steps in the right direction, but they would no
change the cultural differences between America anc
Europe that have contributed to the growing divide between
the two. In addition, the war on terrorism will continue, as
it should, and the campaign against terror and U.S. suppor
for Israel will continue to hurt America's image in the
Muslim world.
No one can really say what the future will hold, but hope
fully, we will see American leadership able to find ways o

Defense of Limbaugh ignorant
Dear Editor:
"Since when," Carlton Davis wonders, "have some
people been 'qualified' to talk about race while others are
not allowed to even mention the issue?" ("Rush was half
right," Oct. 9, pg. 20) Here's a clue: If you're a sports
columnist with a woeful ignorance of current events, the
history of racial oppression and the game of football, you
should probably keep your thoughts on the subject to
yourself.
Donovan McNabb, whom I got the chance to see play
in high school in Chicago, is one of the most gifted athletes in professional sports and a proven competitor.
Rush Limbaugh is a notoriously regressive shock jockey
who once proposed the construction of a massive wall
between the United States and Mexico. It would be ridiculous to blame Limbaugh for his statements, deplorable as
they are; he was hired to spark controversy. And we can
hardly act surprised at the behavior of a network which
has demonstrated such a willingness to sacrifice content
for theatre. But Davis' defense of Limbaugh displays neither the exaggerated humor of the host nor the sensationalistic appeal of the network. It is simply unfounded

and moronic.
Davis succumbs to the most common fairy tale of the
sports world when he writes of football as though it were
a bastion of racial harmony. If black quarterbacks are a
"non-issue" in the NFL, they have been so for barely more
than a couple decades, when Warren Moon became one of
the first African-Americans to play the position and was
forced to respond to a blizzard ofunfair criticism. In fact,
long after blacks began to dominate the NFL, the common

wisdom was that no team could succeed without a white
player behind center, presumably because a black athlete
October 23, 2003

was inherently incapable of possessing the intelligence
needed to master a playbook and lead a team. Even now,
when black quarterbacks are commonplace (though still
underrepresented in terms of ability), racism is glaringly
apparent in football organizations, most blatantly in the
miniscule percentage of black coaches in the league.

Davis's laughable argument that "society accepts
verbal abuse by blacks" is almost too ludicrous to warrant a response. If the history of racial inequality in pro
sports is not enough to convince him that there just might
be a difference between the disadvantages of blacks and
whites in American society, perhaps he ought to cut the
plastic wrapping off his middle school history book and
take a peek. Look up "slavery" or "civil rights" in the
index and maybe the chasm between profane rap songs
and the backward-thinking diatribes of a guy like Rush
will dawn on you.
The only reason I can imagine a college senior writing
such a mindlessly insensitive article would be a perverse
satisfaction in the torrent of abuse that inevitably follows. The only possible justification a newspaper would
have for printing it would be as satire, which this muddled nonsense might very well have been taken for.
Viewed as a serious piece of journalism, this article ought
to make every sports fan blush with shame. The fact that
it was written by a senior makes me genuinely question
...

the quality of a Swarthmore education.
Nevertheless, there is a silver lining here, though it is
buried in a mountain of stupidity. At the very least, we
should be grateful that the world has finally found someone who can defend the antics of John Rocker with a
straight face.

Cross country right on track
Swat finishes the regular season, prepares for Conference Championships and Mid-East Regionals

The men's and women's cross country teams had a
weekend following fall break. The men placed
sixth at the DeSales Invitational and the women hosted an exciting Seven Sisters Invite, earning a fourthplace finish out of the seven teams present.
Leading the Garnet runners for the men once again
was Lang Reynolds 'O5, who placed 15th out of 228 runners. Following Reynolds were juniors Garrett Ash
and James Golden, who placed 24th and 33rd.
busy

Rounding out the scoring runners for the Swarthmore
team in the 59th and 86th places were sophomores

Adam Hunt and Jim Kreft.
Both coach Carroll and assistant coach Laura
Feeney were pleased with the men's results from the
weekend.
Feeney, elaborating upon the men's results, said
that "the men ran a good race on Saturday. They
placed sixth this year which was better than their finish from last season, which is an accomplishment."
Feeney also commented on the race which the
women ran in on Saturday.
"The women also ran a great race at the Seven
Sisters meet. We were aiming for at least a third-place
finish and also hoping to beat Vassar, but they still ran
great and were only 10 points behind third."
Among the women runners that coach Feeney highlighted were seniors Njideka Akunyili, who placed
16th, and Krista Gigone, who placed 24th. Feeney said
both runners "ran terrific individual races." The other
top runners for the Garnet were Pam Davis 'O7 in 23rd
place, Lauren Fety 'O6 in 25th place and the leading

Swarthmore runner Debbie Farrelly 'O6
in 13th place.
Although the women's team did not
fare as well as they had hoped, the team
s did find the meet beneficial to upcoming races.
"Unfortunately, we didn't perform
as well as we hoped to and ended up
fourth. In any sense, every race that
you run during the 'regular' season is
just an element of training for the two
important races at the end. So, while
we were not satisfied with the results
of this race, we have our sights set on
the conference and regional meets that
are coming up in November," Farrelly

My hate list: Steelers,

Duke and the Yankees
Over fall break, I discovered the answer to a question I have
pondered for years. What makes our cultural institution of
sports so great? What's the best thing about sports? The best

thing about sports is how it lets me do, with complete authenticity and passionate energy, something that I can never do
anywhere else. Namely, it lets me hate. Utterly and completely.
Allow me to clarify. By hate, I mean absolute hatred. Pure
detestation. Every fiber of my being goes into this hatred. This
is obviously the sort of hatred which is completely frowned
upon by our society, as well it
should be. Sure, I hate the dentist, but I do so in a guilty,
sniveling sort of way. And sure,
I hate Rush Limbaugh, but in a
I-feel-sorry-for-his-pathetic-ass
sense. But 98 percent of the
hatred existing in my soul is

BEN WHARTON

90% Half Mental

directed toward a few certain
sports teams.
Several months from now, it
will nearly all be most certainly
directed at the Duke Blue
Devils men's basketball team.
Oh, how I hate them. I hate that
they bomb away from behind
the three-point arc because
they're too soft and weak to
bang around under the basket. 1

hate the way their richboy fans
use their games to act like "cra-

zies," instead of the eventual Republican donors they'll
become. And I hate the way Coach Shoosheffsky whines so
much he has his own vintage ("This is a 1996 whine, weaker
than most and with a decidedly bitter aftertaste").
In about a week or so, however, my hatred will be solely
focused at the Pittsburgh Steelers. This year's hatred will be a
little differentfrom years past, however, because this year, the
Steelers suck. What was once a righteous sniping from below
will become an oppressive gloating from above. I will gloat
about the insurance agent the Steelers put under center and
the fat old man they have running the ball. They have a stadium named Heinz and a receiver named Hines, so I'm sure I'll
figure out some way to make fun of that. I certainly won't forget that Bill Cowher is the longest tenured current NFL coach
to never win a Super Bowl. And did I mention one of their linebackers got shot in the ass?
But right now all the hatred is directed at one team. You
guessed it. The New York Yankees. On what other team does
the crazy bench coach physically attack an opposing pitcher
and then receive the media's support? The Yankees just have
an absolute litany of terrible human beings that I absolutely
hate. We can start at the top with George Steinbrenner, whom
I see as the walking desecration that symbolizes everything
wrong with baseball economics. Then there's Brian Cashman,
a zombie with just enough backbone that he can sit up to kiss
Steinbrenner's ass. They have Derek Jeter, a shortstop with
terrible range and a pretty face, who is at best the fifth-best
shortstop in his own league and who has been depreciating in
production for the last four years. Their slugger, Jason Giambi,
has just been subpoenaed before a grand jury in a federal
steroid investigation. In right field and the bullpen, they have
two criminals who assaulted a Boston Red Sox employee for
cheering for the team that signs his checks. And then there's
the pitching staff. First off, I reserve a special ring of hatred for
the traitor, Mike Mussina. I don't care if the Orioles' front
office didn't hop right up when he wanted more money. All I
know is that, at some point, Moose sat across the table from
George Steinbrenner and signed a contract in his own blood to
play for the Yankees. Nothing else matters to me. Then there's
Roger, who should go into the Hall of Fame with a dollar sign
on his cap, because that's obviously what he plays for. And
David Wells, who is, by his own account, a brawling drunk.
Add a few pricey foreign mercenaries and a history of fan
interference and bad umpiring, then look at the overall spending picture ($4O mil over the next closest team, $l3B mil over the
poorest), and you have a team ridiculously deserving of my
righteous hatred.
Now, is this hatred good for me? You're damn right it is. It
keeps me off the streets and helps me sleep at night. It underpins my sense of morality and acts as my compass, steering me
toward the good and away from the evil. As long as I remember
to not act like the Blue Devils, Steelers and Yankees, I will
remain a productive and morally upright citizen of these great
United States.

Tide finish fourth at Seven Sisters
BYALEXKALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Women's volleyball had an action-packed week full of
twists and turns. The week began with the Seven Sisters
Tournament at Haverford, continued with an away
match at Gettysburg and ended with a tri-match against
Washington and Franklin and Marshall.
Swat finished fourth at the Seven Sisters after playing
Vassar, Haverford and Wellesley. This was a marked
improvement from last year's seventh-place finish. The
highlight of the tournament and the week was the victory-over Vassar.
The Garnet scored a decisive victory over regionally
ranked Vassar to start the tournament on good footing 31 (23-30, 30-15, 30-23, 30-27). Erica George 'O7 recorded her
10th double-double of the season with 19 kills, 14 digs and
later 18 kills. George said she felt the Vassar match was
a "big win for us and that everyone's heart was in it."
The Haverford match proved harder, but it went to
five games, with Swat losing 2-3 (31-29, 13-30, 21-30, 30-24,
10-15). George added 18 kills, with Patrice Berry 'O6 contributing 21 digs and Emily Conlon 'O6 adding 38 assists.
George said she thought that the team had "played overall really well" even after the loss to the local rival.
The following day, Swat took on Wellesley but suffered a big loss 0-3 (20-30, 23-30, 12-30). George did credit
them with being a "good team" but said she felt that
"everyone was off mentally and that it was not a good
day." Nevertheless, George was named to the Seven
Sisters all-tournament team for her play.
During the middle of fall break, the Garnet traveled to
Central Pennsylvania to play Gettysburg in conference
play. Both teams entered the match as the only two undefeated teams remaining in the conference. Unfortunately,
Swat was not as successful against Gettysburg, losing 0-3

(11-30, 22-30, 18-30). Emma Benn 'O4 and Conlon were the
stars of the game. Benn made seven kills and 12 digs, and
Conlon contributed 20 assists.
The week of volleyball ended with a tri-match at
Washington with Franklin and Marshall. The Garnet
had a heavy loss to Washington, losing to the
Shorewomen 2-3 (23-30, 25-30, 32-30, 30-28, 8-15). Natalie
Dunphy 'O5 shined during this match leading the Garnet
with 19 digs, nine kills, four blocks and seven serving

aces.

Emma Benn said Washington's type of play was "not
expected" and Swat was not ready for a team that "didn't
hit hard, mostly only cheap shots." Ultimately, she said,
the team should have beat them. "We weren't playing our
best, adjusting to their level of play," Benn said.
Swat then took on F&M, winning the first game but
losing the match 1-3 (30-24, 21-30,19-30,29-31). Conlon once
against took control of the offense with 38 assists. George
contributed 13 kills, with Patrice Berry 'O6 adding 19 digs.
Coach Harleigh Leach recognized the efforts of some
members of the team. She singled out the efforts of
Dunphy, saying she had "played well this weekend in
both matches." Coach Leach also said that "Emma Benn
and Erica George continue to provide consistent efforts
defensively along with libero Patrice Berry, all recording
double-digit digs in each match over the last week. Setter
Emily Conlon continues to provide great support in
evenly distributing our offense, averaging at least eight
assists per game and senior defensive specialist Sarah
Donovan 'O4 also recorded match-high six service aces
against Franklin and Marshall."
Swat has some important matches coming up with the
end of conference play in the next week. This Saturday,
the Garnet host John Hopkins at 11 a.m. and Dickinson
at 3 p.m. Next Wednesday, Swat hosts Haverford in what
will be a heated matchup.

The team also played Penn

win over Hopkins, but it appeared
sluggish against the non-conference
opponent. "It's hard to get up for a
game like that, especially after a huge
win," Wagner said. "It was a non-conference game, and we let them score
early, and the kid hit a nice shot, but
we gave him time and space. It was a
little disappointing, because they
weren't of the same caliber as us."
Swarthmore also played conference foe Muhlenberg and non-conference opponent Cabrini earlier in the
break, falling to the Mules 4-1 and
tying

1-1.

Garnet simply were
outmatched by the Mules' physicality
and toughness, and the roughness of
the game carried over into the tie at
Cabrini. "It was a rough game against
Muhlenberg, and then when we
played Cabrini we didn't have a lot of
our usual starters," Schiller said. "We
could have won big against them, but
we didn't, because we were pretty
banged up and flat from the last
Muhlenberg, the

Swat stuns reigning CC champ
BY REUBEN

HEYMAN-KANTOR

rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's soccer team (7-7, 3-4) continued its up-and-down season over fall break, going 1-1 in
improbable fashion. After defeating defending conference
champions Johns Hopkins University on Friday, Oct. 10,
the Garnet Tide fell to McDaniel College last Saturday,
putting the Garnet's playoff hopes in jeopardy. With three
conference games to play, Swarthmore stands two losses
behind fourth-place Dickinson College for the final berth
in the Centennial Conference semifinals. The Garnet Tide
travel to Dickinson this Saturday for a showdown with
the Red Devils that is filled with playoff implications.
Heading into its matchup with Johns Hopkins,
Swarthmore looked like a team ready for a late-season
swoon. The team had lost only two days earlier to a
mediocre Ursinus team on the road, dropping its conference record to 2-3.
The Garnet Tide returned home to Clothier field to face
Johns Hopkins, a team that they had not beaten in
Centennial Conference history. Yet from the opening
whistle, Swarthmore looked like a team on a mission.
Undaunted by its poor history against Hopkins,
Swarthmore battled the Blue Jays throughout the field,
shutting down the Hopkins attack while possessing the
ball in the midfield. Despite their strong play, Swarthmore
was unable to break through the Hopkins defense, leaving
the game scoreless as the teams headed into halftime.
As the teams headed to the locker rooms, a power outage hit the Swarthmore campus. Power was restored 35

minutes later, and the game resumed with a new sense of
urgency for both teams. With play going back and forth,
Hopkins was able to grab the lead in the 50th minute.
Lindsey Kimura gathered a pass in the penalty box from
fellow freshman Lauren Baumann, beat a defender and
slide the ball past Garnet keeper Catherine Salussolia 'O4
to give Johns Hopkins the 1-0 advantage.

Despite the goal, Swarthmore continued battling.
"There have been times during the season when we've
kind of lost heart after an early goal, but that didn't happen against Hopkins," Salussolia said. "We kept working
hard up top, creating opportunities."
The hard work paid off when captain Katie McCaffrey
'O4 earned a free kick at the top of the Hopkins penalty pox
in the 69th minute. On the ensuing free kick, McCaffrey
found a streaking Jane Sacks, who struck a full volley into
the back of the night, tying the score on her first goal of
the season. "Jane has worked really hard throughout the
field all season, it was nice for her to have the opportunity to finish," Salussolia added.
In the last 20 minutes, both teams continued their
fierce play. Hopkins maintained the majority of the possession, but Swarthmore was also able to string together
passes and create chances in the offensive third of the
field.
The teams headed to overtime tied 1-L In the third

minute of first extra period, Rebecca Strauss 'O6 ended the
game, sending the crowd and the Garnet bench into pandemonium. Tanya Hahnel 'O5 received a ball in the midfield on the counterattack and streaked toward the
Hopkins net. With room to run, Hahnel maintained her
composure and found Strauss streaking past the Blue Jays
defense for the game winner.
"Tanya was dribbling down the center of the field. I ran

it immediately," Strauss said. "She waited and drew the
defense to her, freeing up a lane for me to run on to the
ball. She played a great ball past the sweeper, and I just
slipped it past the goalie."
The scene following Strauss' game-winning goal was
chaotic, as fans stormed the crowd while players wept
tears of joy. "It was one of those exhilarating moments. It
was amazing," Strauss said of her historic goal. Many

was Swarthmore's first over Johns

goals from forward Dawn Fletcher and a goal from midfielder Tara Healy. Swarthmore fought harder in the second half, trimming McDaniel's lead to 3-1 on a goal from
Ele Forbes 'O5 in the 59th minute. The 3-0 hole proved
insurmountable for the Garnet Tide however, and the
Green Terror cruised to the 3-1 victory.
"We weren't as mentally prepared against McDaniel as
we were against Hopkins. We didn't treat it as important,
we didn't feel we had as much to prove, we really let it go,"
Hobbs said. "We had some defensive lapses. It felt like we
had pretty good control most of the game, but we just

1993. "When we know a team is gonna come to play, we

defense was really solid. Other than the goal, I feel like we

"We had really good fan support, also. It made a huge dif-

While Swarthmore still has a chance to earn a playoff
bid, the team will need to win its final three conference
games of the season and hope for help from other teams.

Clutch performances are just a myth
From WASSERMAN, pg. 20
so that it quiets the opposition for an extended time and
gives teammates a chance to recuperate for the following
games. Martinez's fragility prevents him from doing this.
The Red Sox' heartbreaking postseason glaringly
revealed Martinez's weakness. Before this year, he was successful in his few chances 3-0,112 ERA in 24 innings and
four appearances but in the past fortnight he doubled his
appearances and was 1-1, 4.76 ERA in 28.1 innings. His two
divisional-series starts against the Athletics were irrelevant, because bullpens decided both games' tense endings;
the actual pitching in his first championship-series start

was mediocre; and his Game 7 start crumbled in the eighth
inning when he surrendered the three tying runs. The situation was so favorable in that final game. He was pitching
on four days rest
a rarity for playoff starters
and his
offense had built a sizable lead. He only needed to protect
that for one more inning, but didn't. Gibson, from ages 2932 had a postseason record of 7-2, LB9 ERA in nine starts,
with eight complete games.
More recently, Randy Johnson, now 40 years old, helped
defeat the Yankees in two series the 1995 ALDS with the

THE PHOENIX

Seattle Mariners and the 2001 World Series with the
Arizona Diamondbacks by having at least one start and
an impromptu, decisive relief appearance in the conclud-

ing game. Upon removal, Martinez had thrown 123 pitches;
at the end of a wearing stretch, he had thrown fewer total
pitches spread over a greater length than the other two, but
fell short.
Another reason to devalue clutch performances is they
scrutinize a few games rather than appreciate an entire
career, yet if Martinez is to be considered the past-quarter
century's best pitcher, he needed to perform better this
postseason. Great pitchers have at least one great performance every four starts, and Martinez had none; Martinez's
fragility limits what he can accomplish. Maybe he should
use the Yankees' closer Mariano Rivera as inspiration for a
career change. Both have wispy bodies but throw powerfully, yet Rivera dramatically affects more games by having
brief, dominant appearances that also permit quick recoveries. He threw in four games of the ALCS and, in the
finale, seemed able to pitch several more innings. Martinez
has clearly established himself as one of the best regularseason pitchers ever. Maybe, to totalize his dominance, he
should rethink his pitching schedule.

October 23, 2003

With a full week to celebrate its victory and prepare for
another conference battle, Swarthmore appeared ready to
make a strong run at the postseason. Entering its contest
with McDaniel, Swarthmore was 3-3 in conference and
tied for fourth place. Yet with a playoff spot on the Jine,
Swarthmore came out flat and was quickly pounded by its
more energetic opponents. The Green Terror sprinted out
to a 3-0 lead in the first 36 minutes of play behind two

Field hockey defeats
College of Notre Dame
Last Thursday, Swarthmore field hockey travelled to

the College of Notre Dame (Md.) and pulled out a nonconference 3-1 victory. The Garnet Tide connected on
three of their four shots on goal to run away with the
victory. Forward Joanna Hess 'O5 scored first on a
Chloe Lewis 'O6 assist. Teammate Chelsea Ferrell 'O5 followed suit, scoring her fourth goal this season with a
pass from Helen Leitner 'O4. In the second half, Leitner
added a goal of her own, finishing a feed from Emily
Szydlowski 'O5.
Overall, however, the Garnet field hockey went 1-3 in
their contests over October break. The women opened
the week with a pair of losses to conference opponents
Washington and Ursinus. The Tide had difficulty generating any offense against these CC foes, falling to the
Washington Shorewoman 1-0, and the no. 12 Ursinus
Bears 2-0.
In the final matchup over break, Swat returned to
conference play, taking on McDaniel. McDaniel's
offense pounded the Garnet, and the Green Terror took
the game, 4-0. McDaniel outshot the Tide 28-15. Lorang
amassed 14 saves in her 70 minutes of play.

Clutch performance?
Sorry, no such thing
Clutch performances are a myth. The concept is a qualitative measurement, difficult to prove, used to bolster an argument about a player when the statistical evidence is lacking.
Baseball's best example of this is Reggie Jackson, the Oakland
Athletics' and New York Yankees' outfielder and supreme egotist from 1967-8 L His career needs no qualitative measure to
confirm its accomplishments, yet he is known as "Mr.
October" because of his
"clutch performances" in the
playoffs. However, compare
his career batting average
and on-base percentage for
the regular season and playoffs: .262 to .278 and .356 to
.354, respectively. He did hit
three home runs in Game 6
of the 1977 World Series, but
he did this because he was a
great power hitter
a yearly average of 32 home runs
from 1969 to 1980 and occasionally was due to have
such a performance. Great

The Underdogs
m

said, arguments
ranking Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez above any
comparable contemporary seem unconvincing because of
Martinez's inability to dominate in key situations these past
two weeks. His regular-season performance since 1997 is so
unbelievable it's difficult to decide which year is the best. 2000
is appealing
an 18-6 record with a 174 earned run average
but 1999 and 2002 feature 20-win seasons and ERA's of 2.07
and 2.26. Pitchers with similar, but shorter, stretches are two
of the game's best ever, Sandy Koufax from 1963 to 1966 and
Bob Gibson from 1966 to 1970. More remarkably, these two
played during an era when pitchers ruled, while Martinez
conquers today's hitting-dominated game.
Yet there is something that leaves me wanting more: his
innings-pitched totals. Since 1997, he has pitched fewer
innings each year, only throwing 186.2 this year. This is
abnormally low for a pitcher of this caliber, particularly
because Martinez is now 32 years old, only the last year of
what is generally considered an athlete's prime. He threw jus
213.1 innings during his magical 1999 performance when hj
was 28 years old! Because of bullpen specialization, starter
throw many fewer innings than they did 15 years ago, but, i
this same age-span and older, all of Martinez's rivals for th
Randy Johnson, Greg Maddu

and Tom Glavine

The relative paucity of innings pitched is importan
because it shows Martinez could be accomplishing so muc
more. In many of his recent starts he has left after six inning
subjecting his win total to the bullpen's ability, which unfo
tunately has been erratic. It seems logical that the more hig]
caliber innings a high-caliber pitcher throws, the better th
chance he will have a greater win total. A counter-argumen
is Martinez's fragility. Six innings is the limit for Martinez
high-caliber performance; letting him pitch longer woui

team produced a stunning victory against then nationaling four contests against

ly ranked Johns Hopkins at Clothier
Stadium last Saturday, shocking the
overconfident Blue Jays 1-0.
The Garnet Tide played even with
Johns Hopkins during the entire game.
A sterling defensive effort held the

potent Blue Jay offense in check
throughout the day, as both goalkeeper Nate Shupe 'O5
and sweeper Alex Elkins 'O6 played superbly.
Swarthmore's lone goal of the day came on a cross from
midfielder Matt Schiller 'O7 to the streaking captain and
midfielder Brendan Moriarty 'O4, who one timed the ball
past the Blue Jay keeper for the game winner. "Saturday
was one of the most inspired efforts I've seen by this

game they've lost in the conference i
the last three years," Wagner said. "It was a great effor

Swarthmore plays conference foe McDaniel thi
