U.S. air strikes begin,
students mourn lost lives
BY MATTHEW FITTING
Early Tuesday morning, some-

in cities with
names like Kabul,
Kandahar and Jalalabad, Afghan
citizens were recovering from the
crackle of artillery fire that had
dominated their sky since late
Sunday. American and British air
and naval forces had concluded
that night's round of Cruise and
Tomahawk missile strikes meant
time around 6 a.m.,

lyrical

for Taliban training camps, garrisons and airfields, followed by
cargo planes dropping food and
medicine for Afghan citizens.
At the same time, about 90 students gathered in front of Parrish
to hold a vigil for the victims of
war and terror at what was for
them 9:30 Monday night. Their
faces illuminated by candlelight,
they stood in silence, as though
preoccupied with listening to the
noises of the past month: the
scream of a jet right before it
slammed into the twin towers, the
explosion of a missile hitting its
target.
The only word said was an
"amen" at the vigil's end.
"After the events on Sunday,
when we heard about the raids,
we definitely thought some sort of
action needed to be taken quickly," said Roxanne Yaghoubi 'O5,
who helped coordinate the event.
"A vigil was necessary, we
thought, to bring the student body
together and to mourn the lives

lost."

Since Sunday, 76 civilians
have been reported dead by the
Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic
Press, which quoted Taliban officials. The number has yet to be
confirmed by American journalists, and it is uncertain how many

Students gathered in silence Monday night to mourn victims of American and British military air strikes.

of them were civilians, according
to an article in The New York
Times.

Many who attended the vigil
acknowledged that their actions
would perhaps have little real
world impact, and they did not
describe the event as a protest.
"It wasn't so much about helping the Afghan people as it was
helping ourselves with coping and
reflecting and realizing how bad it
is and how we want to do something about it," Celia Paris 'O5 said.

Dann Naseemullah 'O2, howev-

er, said, "I think to some extent
our presence was a protest, what
with so many vigils to commemorate those that died. I think we
like to maintain the respect for
human life, be it Afghan or

American."

Organizers of the vigil, a
presently unofficial group, said
they assembled to mourn and
remember those who died not only
since the attacks on Afghanistan
started Sunday but also in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 1L
"I feel like there- hasn't been
enough recognition on campus of
everything that's been going on,
and so any time I can recognize
the

events
outside
Swarthmore bubble, I try to do
that," Caitlin Smith 'O5 said.
All day Thursday, the group
will hold a quilt-making session
in front of the Clothier bell tower,
where anyone can decorate a single square and reflect on recent

events.

"It's just a time for people to

come together and try to sort out

their feelings about what's happening, and mourn for the people
who have already died," Candib
said.
"I don't believe that it will do
anything specific in terms of stopping the bombing, preventing further bombing... but it's important
for us as a community in solidarity to say, 'These are the people
who care.'

Student Council addresses students' shuttle concerns
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER

Responding to student complaints about shuttle unreliability, Student Council discussed changing the shuttle
service back to a student-run operation at a meeting
Monday night.
Something needs to happen, hopefully this semester. If
Not, after winter break," council co-president Anna
Woodiwiss 'O2 said.
Throughout the semester, students have been bringing
concerns about the shuttles to the council and to pubjbeir
uc safety, complaining that they do not reliably make their
scheduled rounds to PPR and ML and sometimes do not
at all. On Oct. 3, Woodiwiss and co-president Lauren
iobias 'O2 met with deans Bob Gross and Tedd Goundie, as
We ll as new
Coordinator of Student Activities Jenny Yim
and Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave, to discuss
shuttle service. Council members believe the problems
|ie with the use of professional drivers hired from outside
the college.
'They're not showing up on time. They're not doing
wnat they're supposed to do," Woodiwiss said.
The professional drivers are not as familiar with
be campus as
the student drivers were," noted Tobias.
ln ey sometimes don't know how to handle off-campus
requests. They're not sure where they're allowed to go."
:.

In past years, students have coordinated and driven the
shuttle. This year, public safety contracted with an outside
agency, Foulke Associates, to hire professional drivers for
the shuttle in order to make it more reliable and to extend
its hours of operation.
"We've had problems from the start that we've been
aware of. We've worked with the company, and things
have improved, but not to the point where I think it's

acceptable," Redgrave said.

Tobias noted that the shuttle hours are inconvenientfor

drivers because they are late at night and overlap the
hours of normal second and third shift jobs. Some Student
Council members also believed that the drivers are receiving very low wages because of the share taken by the hiring agency, perhaps making less money than the student

drivers were.
"There is always going to be a high turnover rate
for the shuttle drivers," Tobias said. "It's not a normal
job. It's not a full shift." For this reason, she and other
council members believe that the shuttle service is
not going to improve until student drivers are reinstated.
"Student drivers seem to be the most viable option, one
that we're seriously exploring at this stage," Redgrave
said.
Goundie planned to contact the students who were

hired to coordinate the shuttle last year before it was
taken over by public safety, Tobias said. If these students were interested in reclaiming their jobs and trying to rehire student drivers for the rest of this semester, they would attempt to do so. If not, student shuttle
coordinators and drivers would be organized for the
spring semester.

Terrence Seales 'O2, one of the directors of the Student

Employment Office, expressed disappointment and frustration when he was informed that students might resume
coordination of the shuttle. He noted that one of the two
shuttle coordinators resigned from the job even before the
post was eliminated. Even if the remaining coordinator
still wished to reclaim her position, another student would
still have to be willing to take on the job.
"It was really hard finding people to apply for the job
last year," Seales said. "Only two people ever applied. The
shuttle really isn't something students should be driving,"

he added.
"Their work comes first. If something comes up, they
don't show up for their shifts," Seales said.
At the council's meeting on Monday, members discussed
ways to improve a student-run shuttle service. They noted
that, although the pay rate for student drivers cannot be

Drop in foreign study
brings crunch in dorms
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
With recent world events creating international
instability, many members of the college administration believe fewer students will be participating
in foreign study programs during the upcoming
spring semester. As a result, the housing committee
has been forced to deal with a potential housing

crunch.
There are approximately five open beds this
semester, and 30 to 40 rooms scheduled to be available
to returning juniors in the spring, said Myrt
Westphal, director of residential life. Yet the college
may never realize this surplus.
"Because of the uncertainty of the international
situation and the 90 students on foreign study now
who are expected to return in the spring, we don't
know what's going to happen with on-campus housing," she said.
Currently, the school is noticing a decrease in the
number of students interested in foreign study. "Some
of our peer schools are finding a fall-off in applications to study abroad next spring," Westphal said.
According to the office of foreign study, based on
the number of students who filled in the "declaration
of intent" forms, there was a significant drop in the
number of students stuyding abroad between the fall
and spring semesters.
"Because of the current crisis, there will probably
be an unusually small number abroad in the spring,"
Foreign Study Adviser Steve Piker said.

Westphal said the biggest problem with housing is
that sophomores who have roommates studying
abroad in the spring are able to to live in "huge
doubles as though they were singles." As a result, the
juniors returning from foreign study often receive
undesirable housing.
This year, the issue will become more pronounced due to a lack of available space. In an
attempt to alleviate the situation, the housing committee decided on Oct. 1 to field three different proposals dealing with possible solutions. First,
Westphal acknowledged that some rooms in the
Strath Haven condominiums have been put aside for

returning juniors.
Additionally, the housing committee is debating
three separate proposals that would help free up more
beds. Two of these proposals deal with consolidating
two-room quads and blocked housing if enough students from the rooms go abroad, Westphal said.
The third proposal, Westphal explained, was a
kind of lottery for orphaned sophomores called the
coercion model. "We would have a reverse lottery,"
she said. "The names of the orphaned roommates will
be placed into a fishbowl. If one's name is chosen, he
or she must pick a new roommate or move into
another room to open up a room for returning students."

This idea has elicited a strong response from members of the housing committee. "When I was a sophomore, I had to move," committee member Jeremy
Slezak 'O2 said. "I know how annoying it is, and I
know that, if you have to move a lot of people at the
same time, it can be a bad situation."
Other committee members, however, believe that
it is necessary to reassign some sophomores.
"I think juniors feel they have the right to a single," said committee member Andy Karr 'O2. "I also
think sophomores will bow to the authority of the
upperclassmen and will understand that they will
receive the same treatment the next year."
If the committee were to implement the coercion
model, sophomores would receive some type of compensation. Westphal said that sophomores who were
displaced through this method could receive a better
number in the housing lottery for the 2002 to 2003
school year.
"The best thing [this] solution would have [is] the
least number of people unhappy," Slezak said. "But
this year will probably be an anomaly because of the
situation, so if we put these ideas into effect this year,

it wouldn't be that bad."
As of now, committee members have not decided
on anything concrete. They plan to meet Monday, Oct.
29, when they will discuss and vote on the proposals.

Alcohol policy comparatively
BY JARED LENOW
A recent change in how the college
enforces the state's underage drinking
law may leave some under-21 students
frustrated, but Swarthmore still maintains a relatively liberal alcohol policy.
"I want to stress that there has been
no change in the alcohol policy, just
how it's enforced," said Jenny Yim,
coordinator of student activities. "I
believe we're still absolutely more
lenient with our alcohol policy than
other schools."

The
requires
Party
Associates to check IDs at the door and
stamp the hand of those who are 21 and
over. Previously, it was the bartenders'
responsibility to check IDs, and the
administration believed this rarely

occurred.
"There is more monitoring of underage drinking at other schools," Yim
said. "Here, the onus of responsibility
is on students. Public safety, the RAs,

they are not there to monitor behavior.
If a student goes to Worth because they
drank too much, we don't want them to
get in troublefor that. We are more concerned with the safety of the student."
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie
emphasized that Swarthmore's policy
is as liberal as it can be while complying with state and local laws.
"Our leniency comes from our general philosophical approach to dealing
with alcohol, that our primary concern
is the safety of the student," he said. "I
think we can have this kind of policy
because we have a very responsible

student body."

Many schools, including Amherst
and Bryn Mawr Colleges, maintain a
similar emphasis on safety and student

responsibility, but they are less strict
in their enforcement of underage
drinking laws.

"Our alcohol policy is more liberal

than most," said Samuel

Haynes, assis-

tant dean of students and director of
the campus center and student activities at Amherst College. "Our philosophy is if you're going to drink, be
responsible and follow the rules."
Amherst's administration leaves
the enforcement of underage drinking
laws largely up to students. The college

"If a student goes to
Worth because they
drank too much, we
don't want them to get
in trouble for that."
Jenny Yim
requires that hosts submit party notification forms for all parties and that
alcohol permits to be obtained for any
parties serving alcohol. Although students regularly submit notification
forms, Haynes has not received a single
application for an alcohol permit.
"Officially, they're required to have
an alcohol permit if they're serving
alcohol," he said, although he acknowledges that there is "a lot of illegal partying going on."
Bryn Mawr also leaves enforcement
of underage drinking laws to students.
"Parties where there is alcohol are
student run and funded," said Angela

Haight, student activities coordinator
there. "Students are responsible for
deciding who will be served."
But although Swarthmore's current
enforcement of underage drinking laws

makes it a little more conservative
than Amherst and Bryn Mawr, it is still
far more liberal than most schools.
"We're pretty straightforward. If
you're underage, and an RA or campus

liberal

security sees [you] with a beer, they're
going to report you," said Tom Mottola,
directorof judicial affairs at Gettysburg
College. "I think really every school has
to require that. That's a pretty serious
legal issue to have security and RAs
turning a blind eye to that."
Gettysburg's policy stands in stark
contrast to that of Swarthmore, Bryn
Mawr and Amherst, none of which
push RAs or campus security to report
instances of underage drinking.

Mottola said Gettysburg has had
some problems curbing underage
drinking at the school's fraternities,
which are supposed to enforce underage drinking laws at their own parties,
and that the college is currently trying

to address the issue.
"Our main policy is to emphasize
responsibility, to have students be
smart, safe and healthy, and one part of
that is underage drinking, but it's not
the focus," said Mottola. "And I think
we're more liberal than most schools."
Bucknell University recently considered becoming a dry campus.
"There was some talk of going dry,
because a lot of schools in the area
began to, but we decided it was not
something that we wanted to do," said
Richard Ferraro, dean of students at
Bucknell. "We came to the conclusion
that there was no need to go beyond the
laws of Pennsylvania."
Bucknell has an alcohol point penalty system, under which a student can
be suspended for a semester if he

accrues eight points. An underage student with an open container is penalized two points.
"Both RAs and public safety win
cite someone for underage drinking,"
said Ferraro. "Some of our policies are
pretty strict, some liberal. We combine
justice with mercy and forgiveness.
Overall, I'd say we have a pretty
moderate policy."

Lumbee Indian describes atypical identity
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Lumbee Indian tribe has no reservation. Its historical language is English,
and almost all its members are Christians;
they have been for generations. Lumbees,
who came together from hundreds of disparate Indian villages in response to colonization, have no ancient history. If you
saw a group of them, you'd be hard-pressed
to categorize them as Indians
many of
them have mixed racial backgrounds. The
federal government does not recognize the
Lumbee tribe, which means they have no
special privileges, no casino permits, no
federal funding and no tribally owned

land.
But the Lumbees know they are Indian,
and they know who their kin are. These
conditions may contrast with what most
Americans, Indian or not, view as true
"Indianness," but the idea of kin and community were the premises of Malinda
Maynor's informal lecture on her home

and people Monday afternoon.
Maynor began the presentation with
"Real Indian," the first documentary she
created while earning her master's degree
at Stanford. The seven-minute film gave
the audience some insight into Maynor's
North Carolina hometown, personal family
and upbringing. It drew attention to the
view that America perceives "real Indians
and fake Indians," as Maynor put it in her
film.
Lumbees are falsely considered "fake
Indians" she said, because they do not
appear or dress in a stereotypical Indian
way or engage in any traditional cultural
activities. Although some Lumbees have
taken on traditional Indian religions and
certain customs, Maynor said in the film
that she was "uncomfortable" with the idea
ofLumbees holding powwows, for example,
because those celebrations are part of a
pan-Indian tradition, not a Lumbee one.
The Lumbee tradition, Maynor said, "is
how you recognize another person as part
of your kin group.

l/laynor described Lumbee kin and

history.

"Without my family, I'm not anybody,"
she said, citing "Who's your people?" as the
first question many Lumbees ask one
another upon meeting.
Maynor, who lives in Robeson County,
N.C., also described "the place I come from,
first and foremost" as a defining character-

said.
She named 1835 as a critical and devastating landmark year for the Lumbee people, because it was the year in which North
Carolina passed a constitution excluding
Indians from all the rights they had once
enjoyed, including the right to bear arms,
the right to vote and the right to assemble.
"It made us equal to the African-American
slaves," Maynor said. At the time, Lumbees
owned land and had an economy that was
not slave-based but centered on keeping

"inherit" occupations from their relatives,
she said, and share land and resources
with one another. As a result, she
explained, there is little Lumbee migration, "because, without that land, we're not

The Lumbee tribe grew out of hundreds
of disparate Indian villages from three language groups who came together in the
American southeast over 150 years in
response to the European invasion. Fleeing
devastating epidemics and slavery forced
upon them by the explorers, the villagers
migrated to the swamps and forest, which
Maynor said the Europeans would not
enter because of a culturally ingrained fear.
She contrasted the early Lumbees'
lifestyle with Hollywood images of Indian
life, replete with warriors, horseback riding and teepees. "When was the last time
you saw Indian farmers in the swamps of
the southeast?" she asked, adding that she
would like to make such a movie some day.
Because they constituted a merging
of three language groups, Maynor said,
"English is the traditional Lumbee language," and the tribe's adoption of
Christianity did not come in the form of
outside efforts to convert. Although
Maynor said she did not know exactly
when or how specific Lumbee people

land within tribe members and individual

occasions, but the government has denied
them that status because they do not have
a history of political organizing or governmental connections, Maynor said. The
state of North Carolina does recognize
them, however, because it was the Lumbee
tribe that created the process for state
recognition of Indian tribes.
A Cooper Foundation speaker for the
Native American Student Association
(NASA), Maynor spoke as part of the
Intercultural Center's 10-year anniversary
series. She is a professor at UNC-Chapel
Hill, where she hopes to earn her Ph.D. in
Native American and southern history,
and she holds a master's degree in documentary film and video from Stanford.
"In the Light of Reverence," Maynor's
most recent project, is a PBS documentary
about the struggle of three Indian tribes to
hold on to what they consider sacred land,
protecting it from recreational and indus-

trial use, according to the PBS Web site.
"Real Indian," which has aired on public
television, appeared in the 1998 Sundance
Film Festival and won the best short documentary prize at the 1997 American Indian
Film Festival as well as a director's citation at the 1998 South by Southwest Film
Festival. Maynor has also created three
other short films and is presently constructing an informational CD-ROM and
Web site on Lumbee history.

Senator withdraws Students could help improve shuttle reliability
proposal for student
visa moratorium
From SHUTTLE, pg. 3

BY WILL OREMUS
THE STANFORD DAILY (STANFORD U.)
(U-WIRE) STANFORD, Calif.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (DCalif.) backed off on Friday from her controversial proposal to
impose a six-month moratorium on the issuance of student
visas for foreigners wishing to attend college in the United
States.
Feinstein's decision to drop the moratorium came in
response to pledges by education officials to improve the system by which colleges track their international students. Her
initial proposal, aimed at closing a loophole that terrorists
have used to remain in the country illegally, had elicited an
immediate outcry from the academic and international communities.
In an influential letter to the senator, President of the
American Council on Education David Ward on Friday proposed
a set of less disruptive measures that would make it "unnecessary to pursue more far-reaching actions."
Feinstein also met with representatives from California universities in Washington last Tuesday to discuss alternative methods of addressing concerns about terrorist loopholes.
"We used the opportunity to express our concern about the
moratorium and to find out if there were ways we could work
with the senator to address some of her concerns," said Asst.
Director of Government Relations Matt Owens, who represented
Stanford at the meeting.
Though Owens said Stanford did not take a formal position on
the issue, he explained that the representatives at the meeting
had harbored "grave concerns" about Feinstein's proposal.
Originally, Feinstein said the six-month moratorium would
be necessary to give the Immigration and Naturalization Service
time to implement a system to track the whereabouts of foreign
students. Terrorists in both the Sept. 11 attacks and the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center reportedly entered the country with student visas but never attended college.
Feinstein's revised plan will likely still include $32 million in
federal funding for the INS to set up a new tracking database.
"If we can get cooperation from the schools with regard to student-visa reporting requirements, the moratorium will not be
necessary," Feinstein said in a statement.
"I'm delighted that we're not going to have a moratorium,"

said John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International Center.
Pearson said he thought the eventual solution to the problem
would entail "some process by which schools will provide details
[about international students] to the INS on a more regular
basis."
"We've always been obligated to provide information when it
was requested by the INS, but we haven't been asked to do so
since 1988," Pearson said.
In the future, according to Pearson, colleges will likely be
required to report to the INS immediately when an international student leaves or fails to attend the school.

Renewing hope
Somewhere close by, there is a new bud of hope in the
complicated relationship between Swarthmore College and
the city ofChester. At the intersection of a love for academics and a commitment to service, a new dedication to social
justice is beginning. In this week's In Depth (see pg. 12), The
Phoenix reports how a withered attempt to integrate academic study and service in Chester with the college's curriculum is being replaced by a new plan to make that vision
a reality. We encourage the college to throw its enthusiasm
and energy behind that vision. We believe that a comprehensive program that incorporates serious intellectual
analysis of problems facing Chester and possible solutions
to them would be an enormously positive undertaking.
The partnership of Swarthmore and Chester has a long
history, and the ties that draw the two communities
together are strong. It's not just that Chester is our neighor
literally within walking distance of campus
bor
that several faculty and staff live there. Part of the connection has to do with the fact that Chester's economic downfall didn't happen so long ago
people still remember
Chester as a bustling town with a rich cultural life.
The key leaders of this revitalized partnership are
those who are familiar with both Swarthmore and Chester,

people like professor Keith Reeves 'BB and Bernice Warren
(a community leader in Chester), both of whom participated in Upward Bound, the college's longest running program in Chester. These are people who deeply care about
Chester and are eager to share their enthusiasm with their
students and peers to bring about change.
Though Swarthmore is often criticized for over-intellectualizing, a study of the causes and possible solutions to
the urban problems that plague Chester would be a good
thing. The ideas for programs like a Chester semester
sound exciting, and no doubt be of interest to many, now
and in the future. The vision here is not for intermittent
opportunities for involvement and study, but a sustainable, deep commitment to a neighboring community.
This college has the mindset and energy to embrace the
idea that if we want to change the world, we must start in
our own backyard. We have talented, connected people
eager to show us how. We should hold high hopes for this
renewed Chester partnership.

Save our shuttle
Any student living off campus or in a far-flung dorm
knows the value of the nighttime shuttle. A ride home is
usually preferable to

a long, cold walk after being kicked
out of McCabe, no matter how many stars are out. Most
importantly, though, a ride home is always safer.
A string of crimes last spring brought concerns about
students walking alone at night to the attention of the campus, leading to a fruitful discussion of ways to make the

campus safer. Student Council and the deans worked
together to add lights and callboxes and to extend shuttle
service until 3:30 a.m. Part of this arrangement included
hiring professional drivers.
Unfortunately, the shuttle service between Parrish, PPR,
ML and Woolman is off to a shaky start this fall, plagued by
reports of erractic routes and inconsistent schedules.

Student Council is now questioning whether student drivers could provide better, more reliable service than the professional drivers who currently run the vans (see pg. 3).
The council would do well to remember, though, that professional shuttle drivers were hired for the very purpose of
reliability. The fears expressed last spring were that not
enough willing student drivers could be found to run the
shuttles far enough into the early morning hours. This still
seems to be a legitimate concern. Certainly one student
employment coordinator thinks it is.
If there is no guarantee that a shuttle will show up, students often will just opt to walk an unnecessary risk. So

before calls to ditch professional drivers gain momentum,
those involved in making the final decision should examine
how to improve the current shuttle service. If a switch to
student drivers makes sense, it is crucial to ensure that
enough student drivers would commit to those late shifts.
In the end, whether students or professional drivers run
the shuttles makes little difference to people who rely on
the shuttles to make late night trips to and from campus.
Some shuttle service is better than none, but Student
Council and the deans must work to make frequent, reliable shuttle service a reality.

I LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Some positive changes made to athletic facilities
Dear Editor:
The Sept. 27 cover story, "Fielding failure," neglected to
highlight some of the reasons behind the problems that
occurred over the summer, and some of the many positive
changes that have come about since last spring. As members of the department of Facilities Management and the
Department of Athletics, we would like to provide some
insight as to why the problems existed and what positive
changes have been made.
The major source offrustration among the athletes and
coaches this year has been the condition of the field hockey fields, both their game field and the practice field. This
summer's problem with the game field was due to the fact
that we began a project at the end of last school year to
improve drainage on that field as well as the" rugby game
field. Neither of these fields is in fact used for summer
camps. A lack of rain throughout the summer prevented

these fields from recuperating from their restoration
work. Despite the efforts of the grounds crew and expert
consulting from Hummer Turfgrass Systems, as well as a
special consultant retained by the college, the recovery
was delayed. On the very same day that The Phoenix ran
the article last week, field hockey moved over to
Cunningham, where, thanks in large part to the efforts of
the grounds crew, they are now practicing and playing on
one of the best-conditioned fields in the area.
Future Stars has hosted camps at Swarthmore for a
number of years. Everybody agrees that camps are an
ongoing concern especially because of the damage to the
fields used by Future Stars over the summer. Plans are
already being made to prevent these problems from recurring in the future. They include limiting the number of
fields that camps can use, and implementing a deadline for
camp use during the summer, so that the fields have a
chance to recover.

Late last spring, the college decided to undertake a
series of ambitious indoor facility improvements over the
summer. Members of the departments of facilities and athletics, including coaches, were involved at every step during the decision-making process. We met our goal of having all of the heavy work done so that the lobby and other
facilities would be usable when the students returned.
Despite the short schedule and the presence of summer
camps, a tremendous amount was accomplished in a short
time and response to the upgrades has been enthusiastic.
We recognize that more needs to be done before our
facilities can rival those of our competitors; however, the
president's $BOO,OOO commitment to this summer's
improvements is a positive step in the right direction. We
look forward to a continued joint effort toward the commitment to athletics.

lOPINIONSI

College should sponsor undergrad journal
Publishing some students' work would benefit Swarthmore, others
BY ALLAN FRIEDMAN
Every year at this great institution, countless pieces of quality
scholarly work are carefully
researched and written. They are
then read by one or two people and
tossed aside, never to be touched
again. With the exception of the
few of us lucky enough to publish,
why do the vast majority of theses
and final papers go unread and
unrecognized by all except a professor or two, and maybe a WA? I
propose that we implement a college undergraduate research colonline,
lection
under the
Swarthmore Web site, to showcase
done
by
excellent research

Swarthmore students.
I believe that very few students

leave the college without having
engaged in some substantial, original research or analysis. Between
theses, seminar papers, senior
projects or just excellent coursework, much of what has been said
and written by undergraduates
may be of interest to those outside
these walls, or even to future classes coming through the ranks.
Currently, only a small subsection
of these scholars publish in the traditional sense, often because they
have every intention of remaining
in academia, or work with advisers who encourage them down that
path. Those of us who engage in
shorter, less complex work, or lack
mentors to lead us through the
process do not have this opportunity. Enabling these smaller works to
be published on the Web will give
them more significance than fulfilling a class or degree requirement, and the official Swarthmore
endorsement will legitimize the
forum of publication.
Beyond making students feel
their work is valuable, I believe
this will serve as a valuable serv-

ice to the global academic community. More and more students have
access to the Internet and even use
it as a primary research tool, or at
very least a preliminary tool. At
the same time, more and more
journals and publications slip
behind fee-based content providers
that only wealthy institutions can
access. Thus, a strong library of
interesting and original quality
scholarly material would be valuable to those who lack access to
expensive academic services.
Why on Swarthmore's Web
space, rather than personal sites?
First, the college can serve as a
reputable publisher of sorts: one
can claim to have a paper in the
Undergraduate
Swarthmore
Research Journal or whatever we
choose to call it. Web publishing is
also cheap, costing no more than
the initial expense of developing
the site and submission mechanism. More importantly, a collection of work, searchable and catalogued, can showcase the power of
the college. We are indeed getting
stuff done here.
I leave to you any conjectures

about how quality research made
available to the public will reflect
on the college. Given the intelligence I've witnessed among my
classmates for four years, I can
only see positive reflections.
Obviously a scheme to present
undergraduate research on the
Web would require a fair amount
of thought and planning. One possible implementation is to build an
automatic submission system, and
use faculty as the doorkeepers. A
professor who feels a certain work
is merit-worthy may ask the stu-

dent to submit a final edit, and
then submit that over the network
to a system which could insert the
abstract into a searchable database. Alternatively, the college

could "publish" a quarterly (or
yearly) journal on the Web showcasing the variety and depth of
research performed by our students. In this case, perhaps a faculty and student board could review
papers and then submit them to
the office of news and information.
Logistics will have to be worked
out, but I am confident that a
robust and equitable system can be
implemented.
My primary reservation is plagiarism. Are we not increasing the
risk of plagiarism by making
undergrad papers available to the
entire world? Under this line of

thinking, however, all publishing
inherently increases the risk.
Publishing makes plagiarism less
likely, since anyone can verify
that others have already expressed
a given idea. The Web makes plagiarism easier, but also easier to
catch. A suspicious professor
could easily track down a
Swarthmore paper on this site,
and track either ideas or exact
wording through search technologies. Many professors already use
this mechanism to track suspected
academic bandits.
Unfortunately, Provost Connie
Hungerford has declined to support this idea. It has great merits,

and that the majority of students
would support the chance to publish their own work and read the
work of others. Alums are, I'm
sure, interested in what students
are doing here these days, and the

work we're doing here is of interest to other students and
researchers out there. I call on
Student Council to take up this
issue, on students to contact the
provost encouraging her to reconsider this idea, and on the administration to more seriously considof

Be aware of excessive paper use
Dear Editor:
There are many things to be preoccupied about
these days from terrorist attacks and Afghanistan
being bombed, to catching up with our reading and
writing papers, to unrequited love and problematic
relationships. So much to be preoccupied about
stuff within our control, and stuffoutside our control.
So many things
but I have decided to focus on
something smallish, something that I feel I can do and
want to do. I want address the piles of unclaimed
printouts in McCabe and Beardsley, and the general
rampage of paper consumption in this college.
Next time you're in McCabe, go count the rings on
the huge Swing tree table. Figure how many years for
a tree to grow to that size, and then think it only
takes minutes for us to lop a big tree like that down.
Every minute, we deforest a rainforest the size of the
soccer field. Poof.
You too may have felt a twinge when you saw the
tray of unclaimed printouts. But what can you do?
And, I know, I too have forgotten to claim a printout.
And yes, I too have forgotten to click the double-sided
button, or sent a print command to a printer I cannot
locate. Or printed out 10 pages that I had to throw
away because the toner was too light. What can we do?
Here are some suggestions.
Be mindful of what you print. Some people just like
hard copy, and print out e-mails. But when I see two
line e-mail printouts, I get cross. You know what I'm
saying. You can be creative too
share printouts and
-

articles with people.
You could cut paper use in half. Many people would
be happy to print double-sided copies if only they figured out how, or if they remembered. Please
just
take a few minutes and ask someone to show you, and
take a minute to check the settings before you print. I
also think that the college should set the default to
double-sided unless otherwise requested. It can cut
the amount of paper we use in half! Wow.
Similarly, take the time to figure out where your
printout is going, and how to cancel your printout if
something is wrong. Spending those minutes familiarizing yourself with the technology available can
also help you out when the damn thing doesn't work.
For those of you with your own printers, consider
using one-side used paper for drafts. There are tons
and tons of one-sided paper in the paper bins outside
the printers, if you don't have your own already.
I also think the public areas should have a printer
stocked with 'one-sided used paper'. The printers we
have now are so sophisticated, surely we can accommodate that option.
There are many structural things in our college
that affect the way we use paper
e-reserves, the fact
that printouts are free and photocopies are not, the
fact that we need so many strategic fliers to advertise
an event. I just hope that we can become mindful
about the way we use paper, and perhaps begin a dialogue about our paper consumption.

Bush's spin game:
press shouldn't play
I thought that things were getting to be a problem when Ari
Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said that Americans
"need to watch what they say." The comment was in reference to
"Politically Incorrect" host Bill Maher, who suggested that the
United States, with its cruise missiles and bombing raids, was
more cowardly than the suicide terrorists who flew airplanes into
buildings. The White House probably never intended to use a
threatening tone to scold Maher, but the comment was not
received very warmly by the press corps, who tend to value liberties like, say, freedom of speech.

The current political climate will, of
course, be host to all sorts of measures
designed to restrict the information
government officials disclose to the press.
"We should dread a climate where the jobs of columnists and
comedians are endangered by dissent," wrote Maureen Dowd, a
New York Times columnist. Robert Reno, a- columnist for
Newsday, wrote that Fleischer was generally considered "one of
Washington's smoothest operators," but that this comment was "so
appalling it was the equivalent of stepping in fresh dog dropping."
The administration only dug its hole deeper when the comment
mysteriously disappeared from the White House's official transcript of the press conference. Someone up there just doesn't get
it. (Later, Fleischer issued a mea culpa of sorts. He also said that
the transcript erasure was a "mistake.")
I don't mean to overemphasize one verbal faux pas by a man
who speaks to the press every day, or to suggest that suddenly we
are living in an Orwellian nightmare. But the incident was reflective of a pattern in the Bush White House of, well, treating the
press, like crap.
Even before the Sept. 11 attacks, the White House was pushing
a bill that would broaden criminal penalties for leaking classified
information. The press has a long history of serving the public
interest by disclosing classified information that does not threaten
national security, and the move was a slap in the face to many of
the country's top investigative reporters. The current political climate will, of course, be host to all sorts of measures designed to
restrict the information government officials disclose to the press.
This week the President even scolded members of Congress for
leaks.
The White House also tried to pull a fast one on the press when
they suggested that the reason President Bush did not return
immediately to Washington after the September 11 attacks was that
a "credible" threat had been phoned into Air Force One. But that
turned out to be a lot of spin, designed to shield the president from
criticism that he was running away during a national emergency.
Now, it seems that the vice president is running, and the administration is again being evasive. As of Tuesday evening, Dick
Cheney was, for the third straight day, hiding out in an "undisclosed location," according to Ari Fleischer. Fleischer is, remember, the guy who made the "watch what they say" comment. And
Cheney, you may recall, is the guy who runs the country. Where
is he?
One reporter had the guts to inquire after Cheney's health. This
is probably a reasonable concern, since Cheney experienced a "cardiac event" during last year's election recount nightmare and his
doctors neglected to mention that it was otherwise known as a heart
attack. Fleischer, of course, said that the vice president was fine.
Oddly enough, the mainstream press seems largely to be cooperating with the Bush team's spin game, regardless of how they
are being treated. On the morning of the attack on Afghanistan,
CNN's Web site was still using its "America Under Attack" slogan
even though the missiles were clearly flying in the other direction,
and its headline at one point read "U.S. begins attack on terrorism," as if to suggest that there wasn't a second country involved.
Bush's approval ratings remain in the 90s in part, perhaps,
because Time Magazine's cover this week is a picture of a screaming Muslim and the New York Times' special section is still called
"A Nation Challenged." Which nation would that be? I'm ready
for the press to start asking questions like those, and for the White
House to help answer them.

America's attacks

"We will not waver. We will not tire. We will not falter, and we will
not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail." I think that sums up our crisis pretty well, and I really don't know what I can add to W's horrendous poetry. The current developments in the news are overwhelming
my ability to comprehend. The world appears so profoundly different
than it did when I came to Swarthmore this year that anyone's ability
as a columnist to discern and understand the news is bound to be lim-

ited. I've read the newspaper every day for the past few years, and I'm
still staggered by the fact that virtually everything I'd learned is irrelevant in the world we face now. In international relations, our new
allies are Russia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. All that I'd learned in the
previous few years is that we should befriend a newly open India and
condemn Russia's brutal excesses in Chechnya. Those facts are now
irrelevant.
The entire agenda Bush was elected on is now irrelevant too. There
will be no social security reform or medicare overhaul. The energy
package is still around
only it's been renamed the Homeland Energy
Security Bill. The economy that I knew no longer exists. Entire industries are weak that were once strong. A month ago, the American consumer was the last pillar holding up the world economy. Now suddenly consumer confidence is at levels I'd never imagined could be possible. A month ago, the world fixated on Greenspan's interest rate fiats.
Now he virtually eliminates interest rates altogether and no one cares.
A month ago I was at the US Open Final and I didn't think once about
my safety. Now they cancel the Emmys because of terrorism, and we
read about anthrax cases in Florida.
Maybe there are some people in the world who can make sense ofall
this in some coherent paradigm, but I distrust those who make this
claim. Many of us thought that we would be attacked by terrorism
eventually, but adjusting our mindsets to the new world is more dizzying than I ever could have imagined. That's why I was in such a daze
when I found out about last Sunday's strikes on Afghanistan and bin
Laden's chilling attempt to unite the Arab world behind his fanatical
vision of terror. I know the possibility of all this was apparent a month
ago, but actually seeing it all played out befuddles my ability to com-

prehend.
Whenever I read the news now, I just shake my head at the wonder
of it all. At times like this when the news confounds, it seems best to
focus on the simple things in our lives. As for me, I've been thinking
about how amazing the Swarthmore experience really is. We walk
around all day in one of the most beautiful spots in the world. The professors who choose to teach here don't do so because they want to
research
if that were the case they'd go to a school with graduate
school slaves to do their dirty work. They come here because they want
to teach, and students come here because we want to learn. And learn
we do, to the extent that I'm shocked at how much I know and how differently I think than I did three years ago.
The freedom to walk around campus all day, whether to Mullan, the
tennis courts or an activity, is something most of us won't have the
opportunity to do once we hit the real world and graduation. I always
hear people here complain about work, but let's stop kidding ourselves.
I've done real work like data entry over the summers. That's something worth complaining about. Learning about fascinating new issues
and writing papers isn't work it's fun as hell. And having so many
of my friends within a five minute walk to me is icing on the cake.
Donald Rumsfeld likes to say that if you can't solve a problem, you
should enlarge it (which may explain future military action against
Iraq). But for me it seems that if you're having trouble coming to grips
with a problem, you should focus and appreciate the little things in
your life that make sense.

'Dialogue of civilizations' needed
BY BEN

SCHWEIGERT

In the last four weeks, there has been an outpouring of calls for vengeance such as I never
believed that I would see. Everyone from ordinary
citizens to national leaders to journalists have worn
themselves ragged calling for the use of our massive
military might to bomb Afghanistan or the entire
Muslim world back into the stone age. Arabs,
Muslims and their friends (myself included) in the

United States have been harassed, threatened or
worse. But when all of the hateful rhetoric is put
aside, there is one question that Americans fail to
answer adequately: What will prevent another
attack in the United States?
Everyone knows that there is considerable bad
feeling toward the U.S. government in the Muslim
world. And there is no shortage of American commentary blaming this on everything from the faith
of Islam to the hot, dry climate of the Arabian
Peninsula. They hate all of us, they hate our civilization, etc. Many people are willing to believe anything, no matter how racist or absurd, as long as
they are not forced to examine the policies of their
own government.
However, when you talk to people in the Middle
East, a different story arises. There is no hate for the
American people. There is no hate for our civilization. Furthermore, there is little or no ill will
toward any Western government except ours.
Perhaps we believe that they hate and fear eachand
every single one of us because we hate and fear all
of them. I don't know. In any case, when you ask
angry people in the Muslim world why they are
upset, they point to extremely specific policies of the
United States government in the region, most
importantly United States funding of the Israeli military occupation of Palestinian lands and the eco-

nomic sanctions against Iraq.
This is not to say that the average Palestinian,
Moroccan or Afghan supports the attacks against
the World Trade Center. I have talked to many people who were in the West Bank on Sept. 11, and all
have reported that the news was received with
enough shock and horror to shut down Palestinian
cities entirely, dubious CNN footage to the contrary

LEŢER

aside. However, in any desperate population with
serious grievances, there will be those whose only
thoughts are for revenge. Are we any different?
This massive retaliation, some of which
occurred while I was writing this very piece, will
create more Osama bin Ladens than it can kill. It
will turn ordinary people into outraged people, or
worse: desperate, outraged people with nothing to
lose who will risk their own lives to strike back at
the United States.
We must go after Osama bin Laden, of course,
and any other people deemed directly responsible
for the Sept. 11 tragedy. Every Muslim in the world
understands that. However, when you're on the
receiving end, it does not seem like justice to avenge

the lives of thousands of innocents by killing tens of
thousands of people who are just as innocent. As
recently as last Thursday, the Taliban was willing to
turn bin Laden over to a third party for trial.
Instead of agreeing in principle and then negotiating the terms, we bomb. Goodbye, moral high
ground. Goodbye, world support. HeUo, ten more
Osama bin Ladens.
No matter the outcome of the current military
operation, however, we must move as quickly as
possible to develop real multilateral institutions
through which the United States government will
resolve the disputes that stand between us and the
various nations of the Muslim world. And there
must be a long-term commitment toward developing
inclusive structures that can help to resolve disputes in the future in the spirit of understanding
and compromise. There must be a dialogue of civilizations, as Muhammad Khatimi, the president of
Iran, has been calling for, ever since he was elected
several years ago. The real trade-off is less between
privacy and security than it is between world hegemony and security.
Finally, what are we saying if we oppose this
kind of dialogue? That we are willing to die for the
right of Israeli settlers to live on confiscated land?
For the right of the United States government to
starve a civilian population in a ruined country for
more than ten years? For the access of American oil
companies and military forces to the Persian Gulf?
Others may find these worth dying for, but I do not.

Taliban leaders are the real racists
Dear Editor:
In last week's op-ed "Pro-war speech advocated
bigotry," Karima Wilson characterized "Jeremy
Rubenstein's" [sic] lecture as a "sheet and a burning
cross away from a KKK rally." What she failed to
grasp, other than the essence of the talk and the lecturer's real name (Andrew Bernstein), is the concept of racism. Racism, as defined by www.dictionary.com, is the "belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others."
There is a distinction between faulting people for
reasons that they cannot control and faulting them
for reasons that they can. To reward, punish, praise
or ridicule someone on the basis of race and gender
is foolish. These are things that people don't choose.
On the other hand, ideas and actions are. The first is
an offense for which the members of the Taliban are
guilty. Women are barred by law from attending
school and earning a living. Executions for the real
or fabricated sin of cheating on their husbands are
commonly held at soccer stadiums. Leaders give soldiers blank marriage certificates, encouraging them
to take wives in battle. These marriage certificates
are nothing more than state sanctioned licenses to
rape. Dissenters are summarily executed, as are
those who convert to non-Muslim faiths. Bernstein
rightly condemns these actions as evil. The terrorists and their sponsors have forfeited their right to
live and to rule, not because they are Arabs, or
because they are Muslims, or even because they perverted Islam. They have forfeited these rights by initiating force against others.
Many people are quick to point to slavery as an
American sin. Yet they are never quick enough to
acknowledge that African nations during the same

time period also engaged in the slave trade. As the
American Anti-Slavery Group points out, slavery is
still a bustling industry in many Asian, Mideast and
African nations. In Thailand, young girls live lives

as sex slaves. In the United Arab Emirates,
Bangladeshi slave boys act as camel jockeys. In
Sudan, government forces attack villages and
abduct women and children "as spoils of holy war."
It is ridiculous to condemn today's Americans and
the American government for a sin that may or may

not have been perpetrated by their ancestors. It is
doubly ridiculous for someone serious about condemning such an atrocity to remain silent about
modern-day slavery.
The following is a statement by a legitimate
organization at Swarthmore: "The major goals of
the organization are to increase the number of
students, faculty and staff, infuse a greater
perspective into the curriculum, improve
the quality of life for
students on campus,

people outadvocate for the advancement of
side of Swarthmore and maintain a strong supportcommunity." Insert "white" into the
ive
blank spaces, and campus protesters would go
insane. Insert the word "black" and this becomes
the mission statement of the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Students Society. Insert the word "Asian
and with minor modifications this could be the rallying cry of the Swarthmore Asian Organization.
I leave Wilson a final question: Exactly who or
what has recently perpetrated racism on campus? Is
it Professor Bernstein who, as an Objectivist, does
not believe that one's identity is defined by ones
skin color? Or is it any of the so-called "diversity
clubs on campus who do?

comprehensiveness of the military strikes. They aim in large
part to destroy civilian infrastructure and livelihood, and
civilians will die (though how many is anyone's guess) and
will continue to be for days and weeks to come.
I really don't want to just talk about the bombings, though
they are on my mind and the minds of most of the world's people tonight. I want to talk about a value, or virtue, that is paramount in both understanding and resolving this crisis and yet
has been getting almost no direct airtime since Sept. 1L This

o
Ar C#M

virtue is called humility.
Humility properly understood, such as our common humility before God for those who are religious, is essential if we are
to end a cycle of violence that threatens to spiral out of control.
It is an instrumental virtue; it will help us bring out other
virtues and pave the way for some true realizations about how
to act to solve problems as imperfect beings in an imperfect
world. The antithesis of this virtue, which is arrogance, is pervasive in this world and especially so in reference to the last
month.

Arrogance is present when George W. Bush stands up and

describes how terrorists hate the millennialist freedom and
democracy that America stands for. Arrogance is present in
United States policymakers who automatically discount the feelings, wishes and aspirations of entire peoples when deciding
United States national interest. It is also present among those in
the left and yes, even the peace movement
who feel selfrighteous about condemning American imperialism. And of
course, it is intensely powerful among those individuals who
were convinced that a suicide mission that would involve the
killing of thousands would pave their way to eternal paradise.
Humility is a very difficult virtue to attain, because it
requires us to admit that we are wrong. This is a very hard
thing to do for those who are convinced that their path is the
right one, such as militant Islamic fundamentalists, the missionary-style "end-of-history" America and, yes, even us intellectually arrogant Swarthmore students. And yet, humility
properly understood and practiced will open the way to a more
peaceful and just world.
A lot of this work needs to start at home. In terms of the
Swarthmore campus, especially in regard to Sept. 11 and its
reactions, the intellectual pronouncements and worldly cynicism that I have heard expressed in the last month need to
stop. In a sense, Josh Galun's article combating Swarthmore
elitism last week was correct. However, it extends universally
not just to those that make light of the pain of the attacks and
their responses. It extends as well to those who stood squarely on Parrish steps and proceeded to tell a thoughtful rally that
American imperialism is the freely chosen and ultimately correct philosophy of the modern world.
We all need to recognize that we don't have the answer, and
the worldly cynicism of Swarthmore be it liberal or conservative is no real substitute.
In the outside world, America is compounding its arrogant
message of globalization by saying that the rest of the world
hates it because of its enlightened values. This does not help.
The United States needs to see itself more humbly as an imperfect nation, capable of making serious foreign policy mistakes
and of expounding an ideology that is less than universal in its
espeapplicability. Israel is also far from a perfect nation
cially with a prime minister who could justifiably be tried as
a war criminal just as Saudi Arabia and Egypt aren't God-

justified 'legitimate' regimes, and Iran and Afghanistan aren't

evil countries with only evil people in them.
In general, to see ourselves out of this mess, we must recognize, both as individuals and nations, that we do not have
all the answers. This opens the door to real dialogue, to finding the answers together. In this Utopia, we can see the United
States actually discussing substantively with the Islamic
Conference the means to bring bin Laden to justice without
major collateral damage or the outrage of the Muslim world. It
could also see the beginning of a real dialogue at Swarthmore
College, and that would be a thing to take genuine pride in.

Mara Hvistendahl Phoenix Staff

Liza Clark and Sarah Bryan lend a hand Sept. 29 in an event organized through CIVIC and Media Presbyterian Church to help Chester residents with home improvements. About 40
students participated in the day-long effort to repaint, landscape and repair homes around the intersection of Ninth Street and McDowell Avenue.

BBernice

Warren's eyes gleam as she gestures about
Kohlberg coffee bar, her arm encompassing humming
espresso machines and students clustered casually in conversation in one majestic sweep.

"There's a certain calmness here," says the pastor and director
of Eastside Ministries, a Chester organization that offers a variety
of services to low-income families. "You don't hear the sirens. It
takes you away from the hustle and bustle of urban life." She draws
her arm in and settles into a plush mauve chair colored to match
the building's pastel-hued windows.
Three miles away, Eastside Ministries, an imposing mix of
stone-block arches and red-tiled steeples, dominates the northwest corner of Ninth Street and Upland Avenue in Chester. It has
none of Kohlberg's clean soft lines and shiny chrome surfaces.
Rather, it exudes gritty pride: a heavy iron gate tinged with rust,
a tidy but balding lawn, an immense stained glass mural ridden
with holes.
When Warren speaks of the contrast between the college and the
community she ministers to in Chester, she knows what she is talk-

ing about. During the summers of her junior high and high school
years, Warren left her home in the Chester projects to take collegelevel courses at Swarthmore through Upward Bound, a collegepreparatory program that assists approximately 50 young people

from Chester each year.

"I loved being in the library and eating in the cafeteria,"
Warren says of the time she spent at the college. "I was exposed to
conversations about world politics and culture. It opened up a
whole other world to me that was not available had I stayed in

Chester."
After securing degrees from Kutztown State University and
Inner Theological Denomination Center in Atlanta and ministering to communities in Baltimore and Wilmington, Del., Warren
returned to Chester, where she set to work expanding Eastside
Ministries in 1995.
Because of Warren, Eastside now boasts a food shelf and
clothes closet that draw 80 to 100 people a week, the area's only
library, a pre-school that has expanded from two to five days a
week and a cultural arts program that has drawn instructors
from the People's Light Theater and Philadelphia drumming
ensemble Stilts.
Established in 1968, Upward Bound is the most enduring and
some say the most successful example ofcollaboration between the
Swarthmore and Chester communities. Graduates of Upward
Bound have received Swarthmore degrees and been hired as professors, excelled at all types of careers and emerged as leaders in
both Swarthmore and Chester.
Other efforts at cooperation between the two communities have

A promising past
Chester was once a thriving industrial city and the hub of
Delaware County. In the 19505, the city boasted an active shipbuilding industry and a number of other factories for corporations
such as Ford, Reynold's Aluminum and Scott Paper. It was "a
bulging muscle on the Delaware, a place of promise and money and
steel," New York Times editorial writer and former Chester resident Brent Staples wrote in 1994.
The city was also an important cultural center. It spawned a
"spinoff of the Harlem Renaissance" in the 19305, philosophy professor Hugh Lacey said, and the energy endured for several
decades. John Coltrane took music theory classes in Chester;
Martin Luther King, Jr. attended seminary there.
"I've seen it at its best," said lifelong resident Ella Thompson,
president of the William Penn Housing Development tenants' council. "We had so many nice stores downtown You name it, we had
it in this city. There were beautiful homes around, beautiful communities around. People used to come here to shop."
The city's industries began to move elsewhere in search of cheaper labor in the 19605, leaving behind a skeleton of crumbling mansions and row houses that could only hint at its former splendor.

The CSCCC framers had reason to

With white flight and the loss of jobs, the population
declined from 68,000 in 1956 to the current count of less than
40,000 people. "It looks like somebody blew up a bomb here
because there are abandoned lots Everything just went
by the wayside and started dying off," Thompson said.
Now the city is plagued by persistent institutional problems. The public school system, on probation from the state
because of low test scores and high dropout rates, was just
this year handed over to a private for-profit company for
administration. From the 1930s until several years ago, a
Republican machine dominated the city's politics, according to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission.
A negligent municipal Housing Authority has kept the
many residents who depend on government housing living
in substandard facilities. When Thompson was elected to
the tenants' council in 1988, she documented the deplorable
living conditions in the projects. "We looked under these
buildings. There was raw sewage there. They had covered
the raw sewage with plastic bags. Down in one basement all
you heard was the scratching of the bugs under the plastic,"
Thompson said.
...

Understanding through academics

Thompson has since organized the project's residents,
encouraging them to take their grievances to court and
leading them to protest in Washington, and effected significant change. But she remains hesitant about the future.
"When you've lived here and when you've gone through the
things that you've gone through in this city, then you have
one foot on hope and one foot on 'we better be watching,'

"

she said.
For philosophy professor Hugh Lacey, Chester is rife
with opportunities for learning. Lacey twice taught a course
titled "Methodologies of the Study of Poverty" in which
Chester was used as a model for learning, and students were
required to become involved in empowerment efforts at
William Penn. Reflection on the field work was an important component of class, and Lacey invited several Chester
community leaders to serve as guest lecturers.
"I always saw this as something that was important to
bring into academic life," Lacey said of the work in Chester.
Involvement with the city, he added, should be pursued for
intellectual as well as moral or social justice reasons. "It's
the college's business to be engaged in understanding
important phenomena, [and] urban poverty is one of the
great important issues of today. But
you can't hope to get an understanding of an issue without having

be ambitious: grants
had flowed in from the Ford Foundation, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and Pew Charitable
Trusts, and the project had attracted the attention of the
New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and NBC's
"Prime Time."
The coalition succeeded in identifying the benefits to be
mutually gained by more closely wedding the college with
Chester and in accruing the resources necessary to move
toward marriage. But it stopped short of accomplishing its

long-term goals.
A lack of sustained interest among faculty frustrated the
coalition's academic aims. Bradley twice co-taught a course
at the Chester campus of Delaware County Community
College titled "Literatures of Poverty," the education department continued its commitment to placing student teachers
and tutors in Chester and music professor John Alston
developed the Chester BOys Choir, but the lack of faculty
whose research focused on Chester contributed to the project's demise.
The death kneU came in 1998 with a massive construction project at William Penn. Thompson encouraged residents to endure the dust and hold on to their homes, but
many left during the months of construction, eroding the
community which had formed the base for the coalition's

efforts.

The CSCCC effectively disbanded shortly after; it is now
lying "dormant," Lacey said. Bradley retired last year and
Lacey will retire soon as well, making the re-creation of the
body exactly as it existed before next to impossible.
But Lacey stressed that the precedent the coalition set
created a solid foundation upon which future efforts at
cooperation can rest. "I don't think the coalition should be
seen as a failure," he said. "We gained goodwill and we
gained friends, which are certainly important for any
future relationship."

In the fall of 1999, the college hired Keith Reeves 'BB to a
tenure-track position in the political science department.

Lacey headed up an initiative to
integrate service and research in
Chester into the college's academic program. The effort culminated in the formation of the Chester-Swarthmore
College Community Coalition (CSCCC) in 1992. The coalition's board included then-Dean of Students Ngina Lythcott,
Thompson and several other members of the William Penn
tenants' council.
The coalition's efforts largely focused on education and
health. A report written by Lacey, Bradley and Eldridge outlined a slew of ambitious programs to be implemented at
William Penn: cultural enrichment and tutoring programs
for adolescent and younger children, an adult literacy program, a health center complete with drug counselors and a
job training program.

and the college.
Reeves has spent the past two
years building the infrastructure
for a renewed partnership and is
now moving toward enacting it.
In many ways, Reeves' project
echoes the work of the CSCCC. He
has established a strong relationship with the Chatham Estates

Housing Development, working
closely with the president of the development's tenant council, Barbara Muhammad. He aims to set up a "learning corridor" in the development that would house tutoring and
mentoring programs, support services for families and job
training programs. He has designed a course, to be taught in
the spring of 2002, that will draw on Chester for its material
and pair students with struggling organizations in the city.
And he hopes to stimulate similar academic initiatives in
other departments of the college.
But Reeves is also wary of repeating the mistakes of his
predecessors. In the interest of long-term sustainability, he
has taken care to ensure that fundraising efforts come from
within the Chester community. "Basically, we're teaching
the community how to fish," he said. "The center is not
doing all the heavy lifting
we're really drawing on the
insight of the people in the community."
Other innovations set Reeves's project apart from the

with Swarthmore students via e-mail and other Internet
technology.
Also, Reeves hopes to stimulate academic research on

Chester as well as promote more Chester-related courses.
The CSPS staff has produced several papers on development
in Chester.
Reeves's vision for an increased academic emphasis on
Chester is shared by Cooperative Involvement and
Volunteers in Communities coordinator Pat James, who
oversees all of the community service work done in
Chester. James initiated the Chester Road Orientation
Program this fall, which allows interested incoming fresh-

men the opportunity to learn about community development and organizing in Chester. This year 20 students
arrived five days before Orientation to participate in the
program, which began with a walk to Chester designed "to
physically connect students [to the city]." James is working
out some minor glitches in the program, including its overlap with the Tri-College Institute for new students of color,
but interest is strong and she hopes to make it a lasting feature of the college.
James hopes to see her work culminate in the creation of
a "Chester Semester" a type of study-abroad-at-home program in which a group of Swarthmore students would live
in Chester and participate in community organizing while
taking courses related to poverty and economic development at the coUege. "Folks in Chester said, 'We want you
there,' and we should go," she said.
Reeves said he was "110 percent enthusiastic" about the
idea. He said such a "Chester Semester" would not necessarily involve hiring additional faculty; rather, the program
could depend on existing faculty. He listed a broad array of
departments containing faculty already involved to some
degree in Chester: engineering, dance, philosophy and math.
Reeves stressed the importance of taking an interdisciplinary approach to the academic study of Chester. "What's
critical is that we get as broad-based participation among
the faculty as we can," he said. "[This is] a conversation at
Swarthmore that has been dominated by the social sciences,
and what I want to do is enlarge the circle."
Both Reeves and James said visions would come to be
only through gradual change. But Reeves hinted that the
Center for Social Policy Studies and by extension, the college
is on the verge of taking a big step in its relationship
with Chester. "If everything continues to go as well as it has
been," he said, "in the next few weeks we'll have a pretty
huge announcement to share with the college."
While Reeves works on defining and advancing the relationship between the college and Chester, some of the actors
in that relationship hold one truth as certain both communities are in too deep to get out. "I don't think we'll ever
be disconnected," Thompson said. "We think a lot of each
other, and it's almost like family to us."

Regis wasn't there
on "That Seventies Show"? ("Red",

BY JONAH GOLD
So "Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"
anyway? Me, apparently. Let's first off
get out of the way that I've never seen
the damned show. My knowledge of
television ends around the time
"Super Sloppy Double Dare" went off
the air. But, like many Swarthies
(from here on, I refuse to write
"Swatties"), my head has been full of
useless crap for as long as I remember.
And while I'm not big on the whole
Ayn Rand/eighties "greed is good"
thing, I certainly would not mind not
having to think about the words
"tuition," "resume," "career" or "quarters for laundry and pinball" ever
again. So when they announced tryouts in Philadelphia for the college
edition of Regis Philbin's best show
not involving Kathie Lee Gifford, I figured "what the hell." If nothing else, it
would be a good story.
They were only letting the first
four hundred in at all for the college
auditions, so when my accomplice and
I arrived a mere hour before the
scheduled time, we honestly thought
we'd be lucky to even get let into the
building. We were pleasantly wrong.
Maybe Americans care about game
shows less in times of crisis, maybe
the event was just under-advertised,
but for whatever reason, rather than
the rock-concert-esque mobs I pictured, there were only about fifty people ahead of us in line. There were a
couple large clusters of Swatties, all of
whom apparently wanted to be millionaires.
After standing there in line chatting for a good half-hour or so, some
well-dressed folks handed us out numbered tickets to get us into the test. I
was 63. A bit more wait, then they let
us in. We went up roughly 5000 flights
of very pretty stairs (travel tip: the
Philadelphia Marriott is a nice place)
into what appeared a conference room
of some kind. They handed us our official "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"
pens at the door, and we sat down, 300
or so college students on one side, and
a bunch of "normal people" on the

other.

Public, official-seeming gatherings
of people who do not know each other
are strange enough, and this one had
the added impact of being a test,
which brought to mind icky things
like the SATs. "You aced the SATs and
got into Swarthmore," I told myself.
"You are a worthwhile person, no matter what they say or do to you. You are
smart enough to be a millionaire."
Then they passed out the test, complete with answer sheet which we
were not allowed to detach, but rather
were forced to spindle the questions in
strange ways so as to fill it out. A spiel

was delivered, and then the fun began.
Twelve minutes. Filled with such
nuggets of joy as "From what animal
does the Rh-factor in human blood
derive its name?" (monkeys, the
answer to all life's questions) and
"What is the first name of the father

16

rather than "Bob" as I incorrectly
guessed). Like the utter moron or pastlife Chinese scholar that I am, I ini-

tially made the brilliant move of
assuming the questions on the sheet
went numerically from top to bottom
rather than left to right. Though I saw
the error of my ways and made some

hasty cross-outs before it was too late,
if there was a meta-test based on
answer-sheet neatness, (a concept I
fearfully fantasized about in my standardized testing days) I would have
horribly failed it. And know what
else? Maybe I'm a dullard, but the test
itself was kind of hard. Not killer, but
harder than the SATs. I can draw
those damn analogies like nobody's
business, but does that mean I know
the first thing about geography, sports
or television? Hell

no.

There was an amusing talent-show
interlude in which many "millionaire"
t-shirts were given away to people
who could do funny things such as
standing on their heads. I resolved to
learn a demonstrable talent so I can
get free stuff in any future such situation, and then the list of "winners" of
the qualifying test was called. On
which, unsurprisingly, I was nowhere
to be found. The potential sensation of
defeat was greatly lessened by the
exciting fact that four, yes four,
Swarthmore students total did pass
the test, making it to the next phase of
the audition, the exciting-sounding
"meet with the producers" test.
I picture something out of one of
those "a star is born" movies, complete with a Hawaiian-shirt-wearing

Millionaire" auditions for undergraduate college students were held last Thursday. Gold
was unable to figure out the answer sheet and did not advance past the quiz round.

sleazeball saying things like "You're
beautiful, baby" and "We're gonna
make you a star." But in reality, the
producers in question were the same
nice people who handed out our tests,
and by all reports, they were gentle,
even delivering the proverbial showbiz kill-line: "Don't call us, we'll call
you."

So then we ate dinner.And then we
went home. Swarthmore, as predicted,
made a good showing in the test-taking department, and a more questionable one in the area of TV-readiness.
My dreams of being a millionaire are
diminished, but whatever. I didn't
really "Want to be a Millionaire" that
badly anyhow. I would, I like to think,
have paid off my college debts, bought
a decent car and blown the rest on
some combination of projects, causes,

stuff and other such nonsense that
struck my fancy. And all this would
have been lovely. Someday, perhaps,
though, it will happen. I can always
fantasize. In my sitcom-perfect world,
on a loud Saturday afternoon rerun,
the Regis-robot will ask me: "Is that
your final answer?" in his tone-perfect
Regis-voice, and I will respond, stoically: "Yes. Yes it is." And with that
magical incantation, I will win glory
and fame for generations to come.
Money, cars, women, power, robot
armies, it will all be mine. For I know
the answer. And it is Wyatt Earp.

The bells: Oh how they pound
BY JOEY SPADOLA
Even since my days as a prospective student, I have
been hearing Swarthmore students express their sense of
of being constantalways feeling rushed on this campus
ly pursued by the clutching hand of Time. And I think anyone of sound judgment will recognize that the cause of this
affliction (for it is nothing less) lies entirely with the bell.
The bell, I say, without adding anything further by way
of description, because there is only one, and with it, as I
am quite certain, no one on this campus can be unfamiliar.
I think I speak for the whole of the student body when I
say that, for our sanities' sakes, we do not need to be
reminded, every fifteen minutes, how little we've accomplished in the last fifteen minutes; and still less do we need,
at the close of every hour, a series of imperious noises,
more like a military alarum than a friendly reminder of the
time, to confirm that our art history paper was due exactly
an hour ago, as we are still typing it, or that our nap has
trespassed on our afternoon class, or that, most depressing
of all, for all the hours of the day for all the gongs we
have nothing to show but so many hours of idleness.
Owing to the bell's influence, everyone, freshmen not
less than seniors, confirmed idlers not less than hard
workers, must sprint frantically about in an attempt to
complete something before the next quarter hour, when
ears polite and gross alike will be assailed by the
inescapable scourge of time-wasting. Poe argues himself
no stranger to the sentiment when he writes:
-

-

-

Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells

Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!

Indeed, such guilt do the bell's tolls inspire in every
conscientious breast that the whole student body is
obliged, if it wishes to maintain its sanity, to adopt one of
three solutions to guard against their pernicious effect: (1)
To live nocturnally, waking only after the hour of 11 p.m.
(when it begins its nighttime repose), and going to sleep,
like Dracula, before the light of dawn; (2) To stop up your
ears with wax and tie yourself securely to some sturdy fixture, like Odysseus in passing the sirens; or, the common-

est solution, (3) To invest in a "personal digital assistant"
and plan out the day so minutely that you will have
something constructive to show for your every waking
moment, as below:

(PDA),

2:32-2:54 Do biology reading
2:54-2:55 Say hello to Sarah, being certain to deny her

the liberty (in frank recognition of her volubility) of
extending the conversation
beyond words of greeting.
2:54-2:54.12 Check that
shoelaces remain tied (in
case not, do not take the
time to retie them; merely
walk with special care).
2:5412-2:54.14 Sneeze
2:5414-2:54.27 Employ a tissue as may be needed to
wipe the proboscis (See
-

-

above).

Now, it must be asked why
anyone would design a bell
that rings every 15 minutes. It
turns out that there is justification, upon which the dean of
the college, in 1963, expounded
in an open letter to the student
body, part of which I have
transcribed below:

Dear Students:
After a series of recent
incidents, the college has
come to recognize the necessity of having a bell which
rings no less frequently than
once every quarter hour.
When we had a bell that rang

only hourly, many students, in
the long interval between the
reassuring and regular tolls, would altogether lose their
sense of reality, become disoriented and, in some cases,
acquire serious temporary mental illness, such as persecution mania and schizophrenia. Some, being without
any time guide, would mistakenly conclude, even in the
dead of winter, that Spring Break had already arrived
and catch last-minute flights to Cancun, leaving many
classes unattended; others would hide under furniture
affrighted and trembling, shunning all human contact
except to ask into which circle of hell they had fallen,
and thus they would remain until the top of the next
hour, when those sonorous tones might release them

from their affliction.

Yours, the Dean

Though sources close to the present administration
declare the college to be still of the same opinion, freedom
is not entirely out of view. Everyone will have noticed that,

very recently, the bell has not rung out anywhere near its
usual quota of notes, but has been conspicuously leaving

out almost half of the same. Whence the only conclusion
that can be drawn is the following. Some brave soul, driven by the incessant chime to the very depths of despair and
lunacy, climbed up the bell tower and attempted to do all
the world a favor, by lodging something, perhaps fruit, perhaps a spare tire, into the bell's machinery; but, we must
infer, just as he was on the point of accomplishing the
deed, something took place for which he should have been
all too prepared: viz., fifteen minutes expired, and the bell,
wounded but still possessed of full vigor, not only expelled
him, but rendered him almost entirely deaf, with its furi-

ous roar.

But at least he, bereft of his hearing faculties, shall
have salvation. As for the rest of us, we must rest content,
PDAs in hand, with what was accomplished in the name of
our freedom from the bell.

Babblebook: narcissism online
BY

ESTER BLOOM

The story of Narcissus is a relatively familiar one: an offended goddess cursed the
young man to find his own reflection so spellbinding that he could not move or stop looking. Although it's not often said, I think anyone could sympathize with Narcissus.
Mirrors allow you to think you understand how you are seen by the rest of the world.
Journals serve a similar purpose. I've kept journals for years, filling them with perceptions of the world, ideas of how the world sees me, stories, poems, thoughts. They are
intensely private, and though I entertained the obligatory fantasies of dying young and
gruesomely and my mother, through her tears, deciding to publish them for other angstridden teenagers to relate to, I never trusted them to anyone else.
This summer, I decided to bypass the whole death/pretended humility step and publish
my journal myself. Not exactly trailblazing, as I'd been reading other webjournals for
months. Computer Science 10 introduced me to Justin Hall, a recent Swat alum who
gained a certain amount of notoriety when he had a movie made about him, which was
shown at the Sundance Film Festival. He has a comprehensive, six-year-old website
(www.links.net) on which he's been recording the details of his life. His honesty got him
into trouble while he was here, particularly his propensity for discussing sex as matterof-factly as the food at Sharpies, although generally in a more positive light.
Besides the chronicle he keeps on the main page, he has a Relationship Resume that
includes "Various Romantic Partners (Spring 1992 Present): Experience with a number
of women and one man learning about physical pleasure and emotional stimulation.
Penetrative sex with a total of twenty-two women, ranging in age from seventeen to thirty-eight. Thirteen of these exchanges were one-evening insertions"; a "drugz" page in
which he reviews everything he's tried; and pictures of himself naked. How could you not
admire such openness? And, if you consider yourself a writer, how could you not feel the
-

challenge to create something as risky, if not as risque? I had other inspirations as well.
I met a guy first semester who I thought was cool; unfortunately our paths did not often
cross. I debated stalking him, but a friend of mine informed me that the guy had a webjournal (www.boldrobot.com) and keeping track of him that way seemed an easier way to
go. Granted, it was bizarre to be reading the "deep thoughts" of someone with whom I
would never get past small talk in real life. But in the same bizarre way, it appealed to me.
The next semester we started dating (yes, it had something to do with the website; no,
I'm not going to tell the story) and I started appearing in his webjournal. My name was
online! Screamed out into the internet abyss to cause whatever echoes it would. The idea
appealed to me so much that I decided finally that I should be active: if I wanted more of
myself online, I should put it there.
Computer Science 10 outfitted me with rudimentary HTML skills, and summer afforded me with endless time. I already had the ego, the ambition, the motivation and the poetry I'd been writing since 1994 that I wanted the world to ooh and ahh at; all I needed was
an SCCS account. I set up two sites, one homepage with SCCS and the other with Blogger
(www.blogger.com) for the journal (in net parlance, a weblog or a blog).
From June to September I worked, uploading poetry, updating the journal daily, fussing with the coding and trying to make it all look professional. At first only my friends
read the weblog (www.babblebook.blogspot.com.) They were as transfixed by seeing their
names onscreen as I had been. A couple of them even took the initiative to start their own.
We described the same events and linked to each other's descriptions. So meta.
By the time I got back to Swat, I had settled into a rhythm. My SCCS page was satisfor
factory, and I had a small but loyal following
a mix of friends and strangers
Babblebook, to which I posted twice or three times a day.

Tower in the Fountain of Sparks (LUNA music)
Bob Pollard and Tobin Sprout, the dynamic
duo of indie, reunite to crank out a few more
mediocre classics. The reunion reminds us of
the good old four-track recording sound and
wholesome melodies that they patented together in Guided By Voice's "Bee
Thousand" (SCAT, 1994), but with a calmer, older sound. That is, this album is dominated by slow- to medium-paced guitar-vocal ballads, that neither go up to eleven
nor rock out on maximum riffage lead solos. Pollard leans more on narrative than
his usual wacked-out ramblings, opening the album by telling us a love story in the
only way he knows how. "Burns Carpenter, Man of Science," he begins, "discovers a
new rich compound, a liquid form of love, a brain in psychic peril." Though it's
doubtful that Pollard has become an environmentalist in his middle-age, he shows
his concern in the chorus: "this kind oflove will destroy the ozone." Songs like "Total
Exposure," "Circle of Trim" and "Stifled Man Casino" are good enough to sing in

Merrick are two gals from Southern California.
Their names (how precious is this) are Bryony and

Jill Sobule and Suzanne Vega. But this isn't just
another rehash of the girl-folk formula. Their selftitled, self-released debut disc is a musically inventive album that is immediately accessible and surprisingly consistent. Despite a decided 10-fi cast to the
recording, Merrick make excellent use
of a range of textures, from somber solo
violin lines to their haunting, shimmer

to be simple and captivating in both
lyrics and music, a refreshing change

The Highbury Working A Beat Seance
Being hip, which is very different from being
cool and certainly different from being edgy, is a
group activity. And according to our lonelinessphobic cultural standard, misanthropes just
don't fit in. Unless, of course, you wrap antisocialness around an amorphous dogma of its own, and make
it sick and gangly with a sort of predictable narcissistic
depression, well then, it might be accessible, it might be OK.
It might even be great.
Not that I think The Highbury Working's debut album,
"A Beat Seance," is OK or great. It's pseudo-intellectual drivel (over beats) that isn't quite rambling and isn't quite nonsensical because complete unlistenability is the planned stylistic equivalent of the very anti-everything message of
comic book writer-turned-lyricist Alan Moore's lyrics. I
can't tell if my copy is scratched up, or if that's how certain
tracks are supposed to sound: genre-crossing, vaguely
melodic riffs negated by Moore's monotone voice reading
poetry that is edgy because it has a few dirty words and
doesn't rhyme. This CD is no slave to your square notions of
what music should be.
In other words, yes, it sucks. This album sure breeds contemplation: it makes you wonder just what the hell Moore
the genius behind such groundbreaking comic books as
"Watchmen," "Top Ten" and the Hollywood-acquired "From
Hell" was thinking.

FOUR:

CD REVIEWS

An odds and sods compilation from everyone's favorite
umpteen-piece Nashville collective, this disc includes recordings
that span thirteen years (1987-2000) and incorporate everything
from squeakily harmonized recorders taped on a bedroom fourtrack to lush strings and disco beats. This is obviously a treasure trove for fans, but non-fans, too, will find
much to enjoy, once they have checked out some of the group's more cohesive releases, such as last year's sublime "Nixon" (Merge, 2000). There's the requisite handful of gorgeous down-beat country ballads (especially
"Whitey" and a cover of Vic Chestnutt's "Miss Prissy"). There's an invigorating remix of "Up With People,"
from "Nixon," which massages that song's gospel-choir hook into a heavenly delirium. There's the bopping
"Nine," the band's first single for Merge, with a great "deet-deet-deet" chorus. And there's the awesome "Style
Monkeys," a bedroom recording from 1987, which contains the fiercest drum machine I've heard in a while.
There aren't many bands out there who could do all of this under the auspices of being a country group, and
the fact that Lambchop could relegate all of this musical invention to a loose-ends comp with a mediocre title
and cover art is a testament to their talent and relevance. ROSS HOFFMAN

Shadows on the Sun (Subpop)
These guys take themselves a little too
seriously for sounding like a Hendrix cover
band. There's no question that they would
rock out during performance, but Marcus
Durant's vocals are hard not to giggle at when
he sings about the inferno like Jimi (or these days, unfortunately, like Lenny Kravitz). Meanwhile, Rich Millman, Carl Home and
Andy Duvall capture the exact tone of The Experience. The band
seeks to translate blues songs into hard rock, and it succeeds.
Unfortunately, this project isn't all that interesting or unique;
unlike Jimi, they don't experiment or explore any new musical
ground. On a positive note, however, they've got a fantastic rock
energy, which can never really come through on a recording.
Unless you're hungry for Hendrix, pass up buying this CD at the

breakingly grand. JOEL BLECHER

Men's tennis pushes toward spring competitions
From TENNIS, pg. 24

.

into the third round, he was beaten in a tough battle with
Andrew Roberts from Washington and Lee, 6-4, 6-2.
Visciano said ofhis performance that he "tore through the
first two rounds of singles without dropping a game, but
ran into some tough players on the second day."
Against such difficult opponents, the only other member of the Garnet to advance past the first round was
Justin Singer 'O3. In a close first round, he beat Steven
Ehrlich from Carnegie Mellon 6-4, 7-6 and 9-7 in the
tiebreak.
After a victory, Singer once again had another tight
match against Matt Rogers from Mary Washington, in
which he was eventually defeated with a score of 1-6, 6-3, 60. Singer also teamed up with Mike Noreika 'O4 to play doubles, but the pair lost a tough set against Kim and
Schaeffer from Washington and Lee, 9-7.
The other Garnet contenders didn't make it past the
first round due to the high skill level of their opponents.
Ben Rae 'O4 had a hotly contested match against James
Garvin that he lost, 6-4, 6-3. Joey Spadola 'O4 joined Rae
for doubles where they also faced tough players, losing to
Finlayson and Mayberry from Salisbury, 8-6. Aaron
Rubin 'O4 suffered a loss to Alvaro Prado from
Washington College, 6-3,6-L Rookie Justin Durand 'O5 had
a parallel experience, dropping a match to Conor Smith
from Mary Washington, 6-1, 6-4. These experiences will
help the Garnet prepare for their major competitions in
the spring.
Those invited to this tournament were selected for their
great records and represent the best players in their
respective areas, making it difficult to advance.
This regional tournament is a preview of the spring season, which will be even more competive for the men. "This

tournament was solely for individual [fall] rankings, and
the only important thing for me and for the team is to win
in the spring," Thomas said.
As the largest competition for Swat this season, it
allows for additional experience as well as seeing where
the team's strengths and weaknesses lie.
Looking ahead to next season, Thomas said, "When you
look lower down on our lineup, guys like Frank, Rae and
Durand had solid-looking matches against tough opponents. And when it comes to match play, the number six
singles match is just as important as the number one
match. That's the way we've always won here, having a
strong lineup top to bottom."
This year is no exception when it comes to having
strength and depth. "There is a lot of depth thanks to a lot
of freshman/sophomore talent, and players at each position know how to win key matches," Visciano said.
"We're looking forward to the return of Jayson Yost 'O3,
and a demanding but exciting spring schedule with a lot
of Division I competition," he said. Yost is currently
studying abroad.
Head coach Mike Mullan is also very impressed with
the team's performance this early in the year.
"The team has played better than I expected this fall.
Mike Norieka, Joe Spadola, Aaron Rubin and Ben Rae
have all improved significantly." Mullan is also expecting
to come out on top nationally in the spring. He expects the
team to be "ranked in the top six in the Atlantic-South
NCAA region and the top 20 nationally." Swat was ranked
17 nationally last year, with wins over 11th ranked Trinity
and 15-ranked Washington
Lee. "It's all pretty close in
the top 20," he said.
After finishing the fall season with this tournament, the
team will undoubtedly train vigorously in hopes of anoth&

er successful spring season.

Garnet beats Bryn Mawr
Women's soccer sets school record with seven shutouts
BY DERRICK WU
The
women soccer team
notched its seventh shutout with
a 1-0 victory over Bryn Mawr on
Oct. 10, setting a Swarthmore
record. The previous record of six
shutouts in a season was set in
1989. "Defense has stepped up this
year with most of the same lineup
as in the past with a few new
pieces that have come together,"
said head coach Amy Brunner.
"We've really clicked tactically
with our positioning."
Swat outshot the Mawrters 26
to 1 and had nine corner kick
opportunities but the Tide had
trouble finishing on opportunities throughout the first half and

the beginning of the second half.
Finally, with six minutes left in
the game, tri-captain Claire
Hoverman 'O3 ended the suspense
by heading in a cross from Tanya
Hahnel 'O5 with six minutes left
in the

game.

"This

seventh

shutout showed how Swat athletwomen's soccer has
improved through the dedication
of players and coaches and the
support of the Swarthmore student body," said Hoverman.
Spectators contined to stir controversy. "Fans were really rude
again today and if they're not
going to be positive they shouldn't be there at all," said Brunner.
"There's an NCAA rule that says
that fan comments can't be directed at on opposition player and
they were doing this again."

the first round of the tourney.

Hopkins in eight years of conference play; last year, the team was
shut out 6-0.
"I was very impressed with the
team's play. We knew coming into
the game that it was going to be
difficult, and we refused to back
down," said tri-captain Marah

'O2.
The Garnet Tide was able to
keep the Blue Jays in check for
much of the first half, thanks primarily to the defensive play of
goalkeeper Catherine Salussolia
Gotcsik

'O4 and sweeper Ele Forbes 'O5. "In
years past, we lacked a true
sweeper," said Brunner. "Teams
like Johns Hopkins can't dominate us now because of Ele."

However, Johns Hopkins managed to grab a slight advantage
with a goal by Kathleen Turley 28
minutes into the game, giving the
Blue Jays a 1-0 lead coming into

the second half.
The Tide's answer, and lone
goal, came when Jackie Kahn 'O4
notched her first goal of the season 60 minutes into the contest.
The forward was able to slip the
ball past the Blue Jays' goalkeep-

er after the keeper bobbled the
ball in the box. "Jackie Kahn had
one of her best games today," said
Brunner. Kahn applied much of
the pressure for Swarthmore with
three of the team's five shots on
goal.
Although the goal evened the
score to 1-1, Swarthmore was
unable to hold onto the tie. Six
minutes later, Aline Bernard of
Johns Hopkins responded with
the go-ahead goal that slid just
underneath
Swat
goalkeeper
Courtney Caughey 'O4, who boasts
0.67 goals against average.
Johns Hopkins tacked on
another goal to go up 3-1 and seal
the win with five minutes to play
in the second half. Brunner

blamed the loss on a lack of intensity due to exams week. "We suffered from Swat doldrums in the
second half," said Brunner. "The

players have mental fatigue every
year in the first week ofOctober."
Swat has a 2-5 conference
record and is 7-5 overall. The Tide
hopes to regain its focus and
improve its CC record with its
three remaining CC matches.

Volleyball splits conference tri-match
BY MARK JANOFF
The volleyball team traveled to Bryn Mawr on Oct. 6 to battle Centennial Conference foes Bryn Mawr and
Gettysburg. In the first match, the Garnet rallied from a 1-2 game deficit to defeat Bryn Mawr in five games.
"I was really proud that we managed to play through our tiredness and take the last game against Bryn
Mawr," Christine Hancock 'O2 said. "That's something we haven't been able to do in the past, and I think it
reflects that we have a lot more confidence in each other and ourselves." Hancock notched 15 kills and three
service aces in the victory, earning her a spot on the conference's volleyball honor roll this week. Bryn
Rosenfeld 'O3 contributed ten kills and one service ace, and Natalie Dunphy 'O5 recorded four aces in the win.
In the second match, the Garnet was swept in three straight games by Gettysburg, which is currently undefeated in conference play. "We weren't very consistent," Hancock said. "We were essentially exhausted after
already playing a tough match for over two hours and then having only a half-hour to rest." Hancock recorded three kills and one ace in the loss, and Rosenfeld led the way with five kills. Swat has not defeated
Gettysburg in the past nine years.
The win and loss move Swarthmore to a 1-4 record in the conference and 8-6 overall. Regarding the disparity in conference and overall records, Hancock said, "We have a tough conference that has really excellent serving and very solid teams. However, I think you might see some improvement in our [conference] record in coming games."
The Tide traveled to Dickinson last night, but scores were unavailable at press time.The team will participate in the Seven Sisters Tournament on Oct. 15-16 at Bryn Mawr.

Women ruggers
start fall season 1-3
BY MARK JANOFF

Swarthmore women's rugby inaugurated its fall season
with a 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic
Medicine on Saturday, Sept. 22. The team is coming off a landmark spring season, when it reached the Mid-Atlantic Rugby
Football Union (MARFU) Division I playoffs for the first time
in five years. However, women's rugby made some changes
during the off-season. To replace its recent graduates, the
team has recruited several first-years. Newcomer Jacqueline
Simonet 'O5 is the first recruit in the team's 15-year history to
have rugby experience. This year, the squad will be led by cocaptains Emily Sigalow 'O2 and Katie Harper 'O2 and fitness
captain Rabi Whitaker 'O3.
The team commenced league play this past weekend against
a fierce West Chester team. Plagued with injuries, the A-side
fielded a young team that couldn't overcome the odds, losing 290. "Everyone showed a lot of heart and didn't let West Chester
trample us as much as they could" Harper said. The B-side
faired much better, taking home a 10-10 tie. "B-side basically
showed it to them. We pretty much dominated," Harper said.
Swarthmore hosted East Stroudsberg at home on Oct. 6. The
A-side lost 27-3 in a bitterly fought match.
Next up is Princeton on Saturday, Oct. 13 at the Cunningham
fields.

501 miles away from the middle of nowhere
Two transfers from
Colby College bolster
Garnet women's soccer
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
It took a Swarthmore math professor's mix-up for
Corey Pilver 'O4 and Sarah Weese 'O4 to finally identify one
another, more than five hundred miles from where they
had originally met. "I called to find out about requirements, and [professor Stephen Maurer] said, 'ls this
Corey?' I said, 'No, this is Sarah,' and he was like, 'oh,
there's another girl from Colby' He e-mailed me Corey's email address," Weese explained.
Once introduced, Pilver and Weese realized that they
had a lot in common, from a Colby roommate reassigned
from one to the other mid-semester to a love of soccer.
They had left the roommate behind, but soccer was something that they both brought to Swat as transfer students.
Just last year, Pilver, a forward from Murrieta, Calif.,
and Weese, a defensive stopper from Baltimore, were battling the sub-zero temperatures common in the upper
reaches of New England. The town of Waterville, Maine,
which has been known to record temperatures as low as
-32 F, provided the backdrop for Pilver and Weese's freshman year at Colby College.
For their sophomore year, both chose to leave behind
the long winters, a "J. Crew, Abercrombie, L.L. Bean and
North Face culture," according to Pilver, and the feeling of
"being in the middle of nowhere," as Weese puts it. Since
arriving at Swarthmore, both have contributed to the
women's soccer team.
"Corey and Sarah have added much-needed depth to
our team and added leadership since they are a year older
than the 12 first-years that dominate our roster," said head
women's soccer coach Amy Brunner.
Pilver was named "Rookie of the Year" at Colby and
played for the White Mules in the New England Small
College Athletic Conference (NESCAC).
"It was a different focus at Colby. Soccer was supposed to be really intense. It was high pressure. It's a
really competitive league. The atmosphere is very
sports-oriented. Also, the schools
Swat plays are not like Swat at
all, whereas the schools Colby

plays are more like Colby," said
Pilver, reflecting on the differ-

Sarah Weese (left) and Corey Pilver found in common a mutual former Colby roomate and a love of soccer since
arriving at Swarthmore from Colby College. Swat offered the two an ideal balance of athletics and academics.
said Pilver.
Weese concurred and noted that being an athlete at
Swarthmore does not preclude other interests. "[At Colby]
the sports were really cliquey. I was looking for a more
academically challenging place. The best thing about athletes here is that they're smart. If
you look at our soccer team, we

and Weese to the school.

sixth in the ten-member conference.
Last year, Weese was recovering from an injury suffered while playing high school soccer and was unable to
participate at the varsity level and instead played intramural soccer.
Both Pilver and Weese cited a social dimension that distinguished their freshmen year from what they have
encountered playing soccer at Swat. "We had no fans at
Colby because it was more about men's sports, whereas
here there's more solidarity among the women's teams,"

have five pre-med people, for

instance."
Swat's
of
understanding
sports within the context of other
experiences is what attracted
both Pilver and Weese to the
school. Neither player applied to
Swarthmore while in high

school, though both considered
doing so. Pilver was dissuaded by
her
twin
sister
identical
Lindsey's consideration of the school. "I didn't want to
go to Swarthmore my senior year in high school,
because my twin sister applied here and got in and I didn't want to go to school with my sister. But when I was
thinking about transferring, I remembered how much
she'd liked it," she said.
Weese eventually decided against applying while in
high school, but in transferring recalled a conversation
she had in her senior year with Brunner about the pos-

sibility of playing soccer here. However, ultimately, "soccer was a little sidelight to the decision to transfer here"

said Weese.
Weese and Pilver have emerged as important factors in
the Tide's current 6-5 record this season, with Pilver contributing 13 shots and three goals this season. "Corey has
added scoring presence up front to help replace E.B.
Fortier 'O3, who is abroad this semester," said Brunner.
"Sarah has helped increase the level of competitiveness
and intensity at practices, pushing her teammates to higher levels of play."
Pilver and Weese are optimistic about the remainder of
the soccer season. "Apparently we're a way better team
than last year," said Weese. But, she added, "we have a
problem of playing at the level of the team we're playing,
which works out well when we're playing skilled teams,
but isn't so good when we're playing bad teams."
Pilver agreed, saying, "Our record doesn't really reflect
our talent."
Both Weese and Pilver are happy with their decision to
play soccer at Swarthmore. "I like it so much better here.
I like the [other players] a lot better. The sport is competitive, but it's also about having fun," Pilver said.
But there are things that both transfer students say
they miss. "I like how there's lots to do and that [Swat is]
close to Philly, but I do miss having a football team," said
Weese.

MAJOR

Ellis vs. Chan: The MLB postseason awards
Ted Chan's take

Dave Ellis' expectations

American League
MVP: 3. Roberto Alomar 2. Ichiro L Jason Giambi. Even more
than these guys, Alex Rodriguez probably had the best statistical year ol
any player in the AL, and any shortstop in major league history. But
MVP awards should be won by guys whose teams win games. Alomar
had another great year, hitting 20 home runs, stealing 30 bases, driving
in 100 runs and hitting .336. It really comes down to what Ichiro and
Jason Giambi did for their teams. Ichiro re-energized Seattle's lineup, and makes everyone
else better by allowing to hit with men on. But Giambi is ridiculous with the .476 OBP (compared to .382 for Ichrio), .342 average and 120 RBIs. Then there's no ignoring that he singlehandedly carried a slumping A's offense for half the year. (After picking the Redskins to
win the NFC East, I wouldn'tbe surprised to see Dave Ellis pick Cal Ripken here.)
Cy Young Award: 3. Mike Mussina 2. Roger Clemens L Freddy Garcia. This is
what I get for hanging out around the door at Late Nite. I let Doa talk me into taking
another look at The Chief after writing in Clemens. Garcia pitched more innings, threw
three complete game shutouts (second in AL) and had a better ERA than Clemens.
Clemens and Mussina were both pretty sweet this year, but I gave the edge to Clemens
because of his record and consistency.
Rookie of the Year: hj Alfonso Soriano. Saying Ichiro is a rookie is an insult to
Japanese baseball. Soriano is the clear top guy after that.
Manager of the Year: 3. Jimy Williams 2. Art Howe L Lou Piniella. Piniella and
Howe are easy choices here. Jimy Williams, yeah, he got fired three-quarters of the way
through the year, and look what happened to the Sox. I'm hearing a lot of sportswriters
will cast third-place votes for Williams.
Comeback Player of the Year: 2. David Cone 1. Ruben Sierra. Man, talk about a
name I never thought I would hear again. What a beast. Surprises: Mark Buehrle, Joe
Mays. Disappointments: Brady Carl Everett, Orlando Hernandez. Carl Everett better not
show his face in Boston ever again.

Awards are fun to write about since there is nothing scientific
about them. They are pure and utter opinions, and like all columnists I have opinions about everything. So here goes:
American League
MVP: There's a ton of guys who could get this one. Manny,
Boone, Ichiro, Arod, JuanGon and Thome all deserve consideration. But I favor Giambi, who, in addition to having a monster year, also is the single best clubhouse influence in baseball. That distinguishes this A's slugger from a
strong group.
Cy Young Award: I'd love to give this award to Moyer, Garcia, Hudson or Mulder,
all of whom had outstanding years. After all, it's not often that Pedro lets someone else
win this award. But I've got to give it to the Rocket, who went 20-3 and won so many
important games for the defending champs all year.
Rookie of the Year: This year the award comes down to whether sportswriters
value the letter or the spirit of the law. Ichiro is no rookie, and calling him a rookie is
an insult to Japanese baseball. Instead, I give the award to C.C. Sabathia, who in his
first year has become the ace of the Indians staff with a 17-5 record. He is the x-factor
in the Mariners series.
Manager of the Year: Lou Piniella. Anyone who wins 116, particularly when only
given an $BO million payroll, deserves this award hands down.

National League
MVP: Sosa had 23 more RBIs and 17 more runs than Bonds. And Sosa also had
64 home runs, which makes it a pretty good year for him. Both Bonds and Sosa
played for contending teams, so that's a wash. Yet what gives this award to Bonds
is the fact that his on base percentage was an astrounding .515 to Sosa's .437, and
his slugging average was an unprecented and unfathomable .863, as compared with
Sosa's .737.
Cy Young Award: There is absolutely no question this award goes to Randy
Johnson. His stats: 21-6,2.49 ERA, 372 Ks for a first-place club. Schilling is the only one
in Randy's ballpark, and he's still not even close.
Rookie of the Year: Oswalt made it really close, but Pujols is the clear choice. The
kid slugged over .600, played five different positions and oftentimes single-handedly
kept the Cardinals from disintegrating in their early season troubles.
Manager of the Year: While LA's Jim Tracy did a fine job, I have to give this one
to the Phillies' Larry Bowa. One glance at the Phillies roster reveals a team with utterly pitiful talent. Bowa willed an awful team into a late-season pennant race, which is
truly a manager of the year feat.

National League

MVP 3. Sammy Sosa 2. Albert Pujols 1. Barry Bonds. Bonds not only hit a pile of
home runs, but he walked more than Patrick Ewing does. If they pitched to him, he
might have hit 100 home runs.
Cy Young Award: 3. Matt Morris 2. Curt Schilling L Randy Johnson. Boy,
Arizona has to be the one team you don't want to face in a five-game series.
Rookie of the Year: 3. Wade Miller 2. Roy Oswalt 1. Albert Pujols. Pujols had the
best power numbers of just about any rookie in MLB history. You could make a very
strong case for him as MVP, especially since his team made the playoffs, and he is one of
the only two players since 1978 to start 25 games at four different positions. (Trivia: Who's
the other? See below for answer.)
Manager of the Year: 3. Larry Bowa 2. Tony Laßussa L Bobby Cox. Cox had to
deal with a lot, but he got the most out of a team with a lot of problems to give his horses
a chance in the playoffs.
Comeback Player of the Year: Scott Kushner, the guy who loved Tom Gordon. Heck,
I like him too. Not Scott, Tom Gordon. Yeah. That's it.... Surprises: Juan Pierre, Javier
Vazquez. Biggest Disappointments: Mark McGwire, Pokey Reese Trivia Answer: Tony

Postseason Predictions
The Mariners' pitching will propel them past the Indians, while the Yankees will
once again take out the A's in five games. The Astros' young arms will falter against
the Braves' experience, while the Diamondbacks will ride Schilling and Randy
Johnson to the NLCS. I like the Yankees to overcome the Mariners behind the Rocket
and Mussina, while the Diamondbacks will defeat the overwhelmed Braves. The
Yankees will four-peat in the World Series.

Scott Kushner forecasts MLB playoffs: in the end, A's will take it all

sex).
(88-74) @ Astros (93-69):

Braves
It's a travesty that one
of these teams will get to make the NLCS. The Braves won
their tenth straight NL East title which, while impressive,
speaks only to the youth of the Phillies and the choking of
the Mets. Their offense has struggled to score runs all season and their pitching staff is older than yo' mama jokes.
The opposite is true of the 'Stros. Houston has one of the
most potent lineups in all of baseball, but their pitching is
young (and injured). This series rests on the arm of Wade
Miller and the groin of Roy Oswalt. If both are healthy
the Astros move on if not, we'll have another fascinating
NLCS with Ted Turner (yawn). Astros in five games.
Cardinals (93-69) Diamondbacks (92-70): The winner of this series goes straight to the World Series. Do not
pass Go. Do not
collect $2OO. St. Louis is the most complete
team out of the NL with a solid rotation and a powerful lineup mixed with youth and experience. However, being wellrounded and having depth amount to squat when you have
to face Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling back-to-back. In a
seven-game set, the Cards take it, but in a five-game series
jt is tough to bet against Arizona's dynamic duo.

Indians (91-71)
Mariners (116-46): Two different
baseball philosophies go to war here. The M's have a starting staff comprised mostly of control pitchers, the most
complete bullpen in the majors and an offense that manufactures runs. The Indians pound the ball all over the park
and hope their shaky staff of fireballers can keep the score
respectable. This should be a walk in the park for the
Mariners, but if Alomar, Gonzalez, or Thome get hot, watch
out. Also, remember the comeback the Tribe made against
the M's earlier this year? 116 wins or not, everybody is tied
when the playoffs begin. M's in four.
Athletics (102-60) Yankees (95-65): Whoa boy. Last
year's series went the distance and both teams have added
some big names since then. The A's are the sexy pick out of
the AL after turning a disastrous first half into the second
best record in baseball. The additions of Damon and Dye
as well as the emergence of Mulder, Jeremy Giambi and
Chavez make this a much better A's squad than last year.
Of course, underestimating the Yankees is like telling
Tyson he's got a funny lisp
you're gonna get knockedthe-fuck-out. The reigning champs have bolstered their
staff with the addition of hard-luck ace Mike Mussina, and
despite their wrinkled faces, the Yanks always seem to pick
up steam in the postseason to roll through the World
Series. This year, the ride ends. No, really. I mean it this
time. And it's not just because I have a slight affinity for
the A's. It's because Steinbrenner's deal with the Devil was
only valid through the last millennium. Now begins the Art
Howe reign of terror! A's in four.

NLCS: In the postseason, pitching is gold. Johnson and
Schilling are money in the bank. Time for the D'backs to
cash in and the Astros to check out. If the Astros can manage to touch either of them for a couple runs though, the
Arizona offense will be unable to compensate. D'backs in
six.
ALCS: The Mariners finally awaken from their dream
season. It turns out Bret Boone isn't a .330, 40 HR, 140 RBI
guy after all and Paul Abbott will be lucky to win 17 more
games in his career. Actually, short of a total collapse on
the M's part... this should be one for the ages. But again,
pitching wins championships and Mulder-Hudson-ZitoLidle is the best rotation in baseball. A's in seven.
World Series: The road through the AL will be considerably harder than through the NL and that may take it's
toll on the A's while the D'backs somehow managed to
sneak through. However, this late in the season, everybody is running on empty. Johnson should own the lefthanded heavy Athletics lineup, but the Oakland staff will
give the D'Backs fits as well. This series will come down to
which is actually bad news for both clubs.
the closers
Jason Isringhausen and Byung Hyun-Kim have had serious self-destruct issues this season so I must defer to the
"Disaster Effect." In the year of a major disaster on
American soil, the Oakland Athletics must win the World
Series. Just like the quake in 'B9, last month's terrorist
attacks will cast a solemn shadow over the World Series,
thus making the A's victory hollow and easily forgotten
(except by me). A's in six games.

Setting things straight

Thomas, Visciano lead
Garnet at ITA regional

Hey, sports ethusiasts. I'm back. The reason for my return
to The Phoenix sports page is twofold. First, at the urging of
both my fans I will attempt to bring back the stale humor and
mildly offensive ideas I'm known for. Second, I couldn't stand
by while Mark Janoff molested the sporting world for another

week.
Before I get back to columns on the WWF or pre-game
humping, I feel it is necessary to clean up some of the mess
Mark has left behind. While I respectfully acknowledge his
opinions, I feel it only necessary to point out that they are

wrong. Starting in The Phoenix's first issue, Mark began
what has turned out to be a string of half-baked ideas.
Actually, looking back in the archives at last years' issues, it
is readily apparent that he didn't know what he was talking
about then either.
In his assault on Little League, he dismissed the benefits of
having an "everyone must play" rule because it "diminishes
competition" and is not fun to watch. Heaven forbid some little 11-year-old gets to play an inning in right field and take
valuable playing time away from the major-league-bound 12year-old ahead of him on the depth chart. By Mark's logic, we
should just do away with the bench players completely.
Obviously, they're not as good as the starters, they lower the
level of competition and they make the games boring to watch.
Impose new roster maximums. Eight players per team in
baseball (scrap the second baseman and just play a buck
short), three in basketball (fast breaks fun), 11 in football
(like Genderfuck ... everybody goes both ways) and only nine
per soccer squad (you're right fullback is usually a slow poke
anyway and by eliminating the goalie, there might actually be
a score at the end). This also simplifies selecting All-Star
everybody's in.
teams
In his most recent column, Mark echoed the cries of many
baseball "purists" who criticize the recent power surge in the
majors. He cites examples of major leaguers who hit 40-plus
homers yet struggle to bat their body weight as a sign that
baseball has taken a turn for the worse. Maybe a home run
isn't as significant as it once was, but is that so wrong?
The game of baseball is evolving and new styles of play
come to the forefront. And just like sideburns and boy bands,
sometimes trends come back in style. Right now, the power
game is in. But, upon closer inspection, you'll notice that even
in the height of the power game the most successful teams are
not always the ones swinging the big sticks. The Yankees
have dominated the last decade of baseball with pitching,
speed and (save Chuck Knoblauch) defense. The record-breaking Mariners boast an explosive offense that operates on stealing bases and hitting behind the baserunners.
The Yanks and Mariners are playing small-ball and winning while teams like the Rangers, Rockies and Brewers, who
build their franchises around the long ball, find themselves 30
games out of a playoff spot. How many more seasons of finishing in the cellar will it take for these teams to get the idea
that there's more to winning than trotting the bases?
Baseball actually had an "off-year" offensively. Home runs,
batting average, ERA and runs all dropped from last year.
Nonetheless, I can't deny that more and more guys are able to
reach the 40, 50 and 60 home run plateaus. But much of this is
because guys are trading in longevity for immediate power.
Richie Sexson might hit 40 homers a year, but he'll be lucky
to play for 10 years. Conversely, Hammering Hank was
around for nearly a quarter century.
It's ironic that Randy Johnson chased after the strikeout
record the same year as Barry Bonds broke the home run
record. With his 2.49 ERA, LO4 WHIP, and 379 strikeouts, I
guess Randy opted to use the un-juiced baseballs this season.
If anything in the majors is juiced, it's the players with 18inch forearms hitting the ball 550 feet to the opposite field. If
a guy who bench presses 450 pounds swings at a ball traveling
95 mph, what do you think is gonna happen? He'll either
strike out or hit a homer. Sounds like exciting baseball to me.
they're
Records are still sacred. But let's not forget
meant to be broken. Sometimes it takes 30 years to break a
record, sometimes only three. Remember, many considered it
sacrilegious when Hank Aaron was making his run at Ruth's
record. But now, Aaron's record holds the same significance

as it did when Babe held it... why not Bonds'?

Second-year vetran Frank Visciano advanced to the third round of singles play at the ITA regional before falling
6-4, 6-2 to Washington and Lee's Andrew Roberts. Visciano dropped only only one game in two rounds of play.
BY TARA TROUT

The Tide was challenged last Friday and Saturday at
the Atlantic South Intercollegiate Tennis Association
(ITA) tournament, a single-elimination 64-draw tournament that Swarthmore hosted. The tournament drew
selected Division 111 players from over 20 colleges in the
region.

The team did well overall, participating in a number
of close matches marked by many tiebreakers. Despite
the stiff competition from the pool of talented athletes,
Swarthmore still managed to have some players continue to the higher rounds. John Thomas 'O2 and Frank

Visciano 'O4 placed highest for the Tide in doubles. The
duo blew past a team from Frostburg State 8-1, and followed the win with another victory by beating a pair

from Salisbury 8-2. After qualifying for the quarterfinals, Thomas/Visciano suffered a gut-wrenching loss to
the Nquyen/Uyar team from Mary Washington College
after a final score of 9-8 and a 7-5 tiebreak.
Individually, Thomas scored two victories against
Haverford's George Bulmar 6-1, 6-1 and Boris Sofrnan
from Carnegie Mellon 6-3, 6-1 After making it to the
third round, sixth seed Thomas finally fell to Rhys
James from Washington and Lee after a hotly contested
match, 6-7 and 13-11 in a tiebreak, 6-2, 7-5.
Visciano did extremely well in the first round, obliterating Cabrini's Tyler Burt 6-0, 6-0. He followed his
success with a similar feat, beating Eric Thorell from
Mary Washington with a score of 6-L 6-0. After breezing
