E-mail Slams Student Council Candidate
By

Dan Green

On Monday, an e-mail was sent to four students—officers of SASS, SAO and SQU, and a former officer of
HOLA—asking them to spread the word that Ford
O'Connell 'OO was run ning for Appointments Chair in
the Student Council election held this week. The message, which urged support for Jeannie Gallego 'OO, characterized O'Connell and some unnamedStudent Council
members as "bigoted fools." The message became widely
known after it was forwarded on a SASS e-mail list.
According to John Todd '97, who sent the original email printed below, the message was "a private e-mail
sent to four people whom I know, asking them to 'let their
various organizations know' something." Todd states
that the message was never intended to be forwarded.
Indeed, JoshFreker' 99, headof SQU, did not forward the

message to his group,but rather raised the issue at a SQU
meeting.
Laura Kozek '97, forwarded the message to HOLA
coordinator MariaLuisa Guardiola, but not to any HOLA
mailing list. SAO coordinator Connie Cheung '9B could
not be reached for comment.
The message read as follows:
"hello people,
i was wondering if y'all could let your various
organizations know of a little scary thing: ford o 'connell
is running for student council, i don't k now about you,
but i don't think swarthmore needs any more bigoted

marginal voices contented to sit on the sidelines, fight

SASS president Reuben Canada '99 explained the
forwarding as a simple mistake by SASS secretary
Valencia King '99, who was unaware that she could
screen e-mails sent to her for forwarding. In an apology
sent to SASS members and to O'Connell, Canada explained that the message was "not a SASS sponsored email and was mistakenly forwarded to the community."
Canada added that "the SASS exec board will never

support the degradation of any person's character regardless of personal feelings." Canada later said that "as SEO
director and as an RA he's [Todd's] a role model, and he
should recognize the inherent power of his position and
should use it with more responsibility."
Many students expressed concern at O'Connell's candidacy. One first-year said, "I was really surprised thathe
was running." A sophomore added that O'Connell cannot be allowed to sit on Student Council because he
"cannot represent all of Swarthmore."
Gallego, who "was unaware that he [Todd] was going
to send out a message" says that "it was written by an
individual who had an opinion and an e-mail list and
decided to express his point of view just as so many others

Truth Behind Athletic Recruitment at Swat
By Andy Murray

Every year, coaches for intercollegiate sports at Swarthmore act out a role that lies somewhere between parent and
professorby sharing in theirathletes' successes and failures
and coaxing each athlete toward better performances on the
field, in the pool, or on the court. However, each year, as
spring and the admissions season draws near, a common
metaphor for coaches to use in describing what they do, is
that of the salesperson. Coaches are expected to keep in
mind the long-term performance of their program and they
would contend that this means they must sell the product of
Swarthmore College to an increasingly savvy market of
college-bound student-athletes who are becoming more and
more adept and shopping around for the best higher education provider.
In Division 111 as well as Division I schools, sports

recruitment invariably attracts questions about its impact on
the College community. While it has always been difficult to
determinewhetherathletic or academic recruitment is having
the larger impact at any given school—or even if the two are
in any way opposed—what is clear at Swarthmore, is that
athletic recruitment is a highly organized process which
many feel only adds to the success and reputation of the
College as a whole.
Suggestive of both the College's Division 111 status and a
college-bound senior's need to find the perfect match, is the
fact that sports recruitment at Swarthmore often begins with
the student. It is not uncommon for Swarthmore coaches to
learn of prospective players through recruitment services
which collect a fee from college-bound students in return for
sending their stats and skills to selected coaches in a region or
nationwide. Nor is it uncommon for coaches to be the first
and most frequent college representative with whom a pro-

spective student-athlete is in contact. According to Susan
Davis, coach of the men's and women's swim teams at
Swarthmore, this does not mean the student "is choosing
athletics over academics." A student, for example might be
using sports as one way of choosing between equally good
academic institutions. The quality of the team they are
interested in, says Davis, is only one way for them to determine "where they'll fit in."
Once contacted, however, Swarthmore's athletic representatives are anything but passive. While the bulk of
Swarthmore/'s recruiting is done either through the mail or
over th phone, there are stil! substantia! amounts of money
spent on reaching out to athletic talent. Bob Williams, who
chairs the College's Athletic Department, estimates that the

Sophomores Decide Their Futures
By Wendy Kemp

Swarthmore's sophomores are currently
contemplating major decisions, as the annual
"Sophomore Paper" season arrived earlier
this month with a "Chocolates and Choosings"
meeting, where the Class of 1999 met with
representatives from various academic departments to discuss their prospective majors. Major declarations were handed in by
February 10, and each department assigned
advisors to those students applying for a
major in their respective area. One final step
stillremains: the writing of the actual 'Sophomore Paper' which details the course of study
through junior and senior years.
Although decisions about Honors, double
majors and special majors have not yet been
officially recognized, most departments have
a general idea of what to expect. The division
of majors among the various departments
was unequal. Even though students were jokingly dissuaded from majoring in Biology,
this overcrowded department still attracted
approximately 50 majors.
Biology is not the only department which
has received a large number of major declaration forms. At present there are 34 students
whohave expressed an interest in majoring or
minoring in economics. "There are no big
surprises or problems at this point," says
Steve Golub, chairman of the department,
"[But] usually it rises to between 40 and 50 as

students sign up later." The English department has 30 interested sophomores so far,

half of whom have expressed interest in the
Honors program, while one plans to complete
a double major, and another, a special major.
Perhaps the biggest surprise was reserved
for the Sociology/ Anthropology department,
which has received 31 major declarations.
"This is the third year in a row we've seen a
substantial increase in majors," says chairperson Joy Charlton, "and we are delighted."
Among the intended majors are 16 course
majors, 6 honors majors, 5 Soc/Anth and
Education majors, and 4 Bio-Anthropology
majors. Seven students in the group have
expressed an intention to double major. In
addition, the department expects the number
of majors from the class of '99 to grow larger,

as "some students find Sociology & Anthropology later in their college careers, since
they've typically not been exposed to these
disciplines in high school," says Charlton.
There are presently 34 students who intend
to major in Psychology, although ten of them
are special majors in the field of Psychobiology. Two students have specified special
majors in Psychology and Education. As for
Honors, "a number have indicated interest in
honors, and others will find their way to
honors when they know more about the program," says Julia Welbon from the Psychology Department. Although the number is
slightly higher than usual at this time ofyear,
the number of psychology majors usually
increases throughout the junior year and beginning of the senior year, as people return
from studying abroad adjust their plans.
The History department has so farreceived
18 sophomore major declarations, which is
"fewer than we expected and fewer than we
have had in the past several years," says
Associate Professor Robert Weinberg. For
the classes of 1997 and 1998, the number of
majors totalled close to 70 in honors and
course majors. In addition, several of the
students are interested in honors majors for
history, as well as double majors.
Not all departments have a large number

The second floor was declared victor and
awarded the TV/VCR for the rest of the
semester. President Al Bloom, accompanied by his wife Peggy (15 points), made
an appearance to hand out the prize.
Surprisingly, most of the items on the
list were collected by at least one hall.
While no hall was successful in stopping

Moscatelli's Porsche was parked outside,
providing points for the first floor, and a
bottle of vintage 1988 wine provided
points for the second floor. Second floor

A statue from Bryn Mawr, a large portrait of a Swarthmore notable, one of those
big fans from Sharpies, 500 beer bottle
caps, a Haverford Goat, bodies smeared
with chocolate, a big rock, and enormous
toe nails were produced by various halls.
First floor gained a lot of points with a
dozenadmitted cases of hallcest, and while
first floor's attempt at an amphibious landing craft was deemed unworthy for water
travel, they were awarded 35 points.
But the second floor had more stuff, and
wound up taking first place by a total of 1.5
points out ofover 400awarded. Bill Mather
'OO remarked, "It's wonderfulthat we won,
but it is better in a way for the other halls
because they get to use the TV without the
noise of having it on their floor."
Third seemed unfazed by their solid
defeat. Gaining the points for only Mrs.

belly dancing champions, they finished a
solid last. "But we don't have to walk
down to first floor in order to watch TV,"
said Matt Menendez '99.

Dr. Mary Frances Berry
Speaks on Civil Rights
By Emily

Shartin

On Tuesday night in a lecture entitled
"Civil Rights in America: Where Do We
Go from Here? Dr. Mary Frances Berry
discussed her thoughts on social justice
as the nation prepares to enter the 21st
century.
Dr. Berry, Professor of American Social Thought at the University of Pennsylvania, began her talk by explaining
that civil rights movements involve everyone who desires to live freely, and
"not just the rights of African Americans." Summarizing the present state of
social justice, she somberly noted that
there are still many opponents to civil
rights. "Soon," she warned the audience,
"the anti-civil rights movement will be in
your neighborhood."
Her solution to this problem was simply that people start doing something.
She cautioned against spending too much
time theorizing and not enough time acting. "It's time to avoid betraying the
cause of social justice," Dr. Berry said,
entreating the audience to insist on policy

Dr. Berry frankly revealed her opinion of

College Bowl team thwarted

This Valentine's Day, instead of
partaking in festivities on campus,
more than 35 women flocked to
Pendle Hill Quaker Retreat for the
1997 Women's Retreat. At the retreat, students participated in workshops about race and ethnicity among
women, body image, women's health
and wellness, mother-daughter relationships, and assertiveness training.
Students left on Friday evening and
returned on Sunday around noon.
The motives for attending the retreat varied. "My reasons for going...

Lee '9B. Anita Chikkatur 'OO, who
helped organize the retreat said that
"it was a place for diverse groups of

The College Bowl team was unable to reach their competition
this past weekend, because they were given directions to a bowling
alley by competition coordinators.
John Shainan 'OO, Josh Miller 'OO, Ed Cohn '99, Fred Bush '9B,
JeffLockman '9B, and Psychology professor Frank Durgin piled
into a Swarthmore van early Saturday morning and set out for
College Bowl International (CBI) Regionals at Adelphi University,
in New York. "The directions were terrible," said Cohn.
Finally, they reached their destination—a building referred to in
thedirections as the "Sheridan Bowl." It was immediately apparent
that it was a bowling alley. "Were they holding the College Bowl
tournament at a bowling alley? No, they were holding the college
bowling tournament at a bowling alley," recalled Bush. Apparently, their contact person was running both of the bowl-themed
tournaments. Upon realizing the mistake, the team sped off towards
the real tournament, only to find that they had been disqualified for
lateness. The team was doubly disappointed at this, because if they
had won, they would have continued on to Nationals.

PACES fines Russian Club

New Bryn Mawr president chosen
Bryn Mawr College trustees Saturday picked Nancy J. Vickers,
Dean ofCurriculum and Instruction at the University of Southern
California, to serve as Bryn Mawr's next president.
Vickers will start work this summer, replacing Mary Patterson

a senior program officer at the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
Vickers, a specialist in French, Italian and comparative literature, was the only finalist for the job.

Members of the Russian club are angered over the loss of a $ 100
PACES deposit for a party they held on January 31 st. The deposit
was kept by the management, which claims that the facilities were
left in an unsatisfactory condition after the party.
After the party, Sasha Vorobiev '97, Co-President of the Russian
Club, emailed PACES Co-Coordinator Dana Correale '97 asking
how to retrieve his $lOO deposit. Correale replied that Andrea
Barnett' 97, the other coordinator, felt that the Russian Clubhad not
done a good enough job cleaning up, and thereforePACES would
keep the deposit. Members of the Russian Club dispute this claim,
insisting that they cleaned up adequately.
Misha Neverov '97, Co-President of the Russian Club, proceeded to contact Student Activities Coordinator Jen Leigh to
express his dissatisfaction over Correale's decision; Leigh responded that she would back Correale's judgment.
Neverov and five otherclub members then approached Associate
Dean Tedd Goundie, who said he would speak withLeigh and then
get back to them. Finally, this past Monday, Leigh e-mailed the
club, reaffirming her decision. Neverov, who is frustrated with the
decision, cites a "lack ofcommunication" between PACES and the
club. PACES coordinators maintain that they made their clean-up
expectations clear.

the department spends between $2OOO and $3OOO
annually on recruitment calls and $4OOO annually
on mailings. And for mailings, these figures do not
account for money spent by the Admissions Office
which spends a mere $475 every two years on
brochures targeted towards athletes.
While the practice is not widespread at
Swarthmore, some coaches also travel locally and
regionally to watch and recruit athletes where they
compete. Assistants to Lee Wimberly, the men's
basketball coach, occasionally travel to games in
Delaware County, Harrisburg, Washington D.C.
and New York City. There they watch players in
action and meet with likely possibilities. According to Williams, the Athletic Department compensates some coaches formileage costs and overnight
accommodations, but such trips are rare. Wimberly
estimates that only three regional trips are made by
men's basketball assistants each year, none of
which are overnight trips.
Methods of recruiting that appear to pay higher
dividends are student visits and campus functions
sponsored by the athletics program. Both Davis
and Wimberly noted that the Athletic Office hosts
prospective students for campus visits and that
attempts are made to house specs with team members and to coordinate visits with the Admissions
Office. "They want to see the entire scene," said
Davis. Some teams also sponsor functions that
promote the College to their top recruits. One such
event is held on the opening weekend ofthe basketball season, in conjunction withthe Equinox Classic. The basketball program attempts to bring in 8
or 10 of its top recruits and house each with one of
the players. The visits have proven very successful, with students choosing to come to Swarthmore
in the past. Echoing other students from the class

Deng Xiaoping, "paramount leader" of the People's Republic of
China since 1979,died Wednesday night in Beijing. Deng, 92, died
of respiratory failure. Known to be suffering from advanced
Parkinson's disease, he had not appeared in public for several
years. His position will probably be filled by Jiang Zemin, the
current President of the PRC and general secretary of the Communist Party. An official obituary, released later Wednesday, stated,
"The death ofComrade Deng Xiaoping is an immeasurable loss to
our Party...and will certainly cause tremendous grief among the
Chinese people."

of 2000, Erica Rosenthal 'OO recalled that talking
in person with Coach Davis help her decide to
attend Swarthmore.
Even among Division 111 schools like
Swarthmore, Williams and Amherst, sports recruitment has become an important facet of a
coach's job. Davis attributed the increasing competitiveness for athletic talent to the growth in
collegiate sports and women's athletics. Quite
simply, said Davis, "If you don't recruit, you're
not going to compete." As a Division 111 school,
there are certain rules the College must observe.
Foremost among these, the College may not offer
any athletic scholarships, nor can it play any direct
role in the admission process. Nonetheless, there
are indirect way s in which theAthletic Department
can seek to improve Swarthmore's ability to
compete.
Robin Mamlet, Dean of Admissions, indicated
that she does meet periodically withBob Williams
and that it is part of his job to convey to her the
needs of the Athletic Department. Coach Davis,
however, stressed the fact that the voiceofcoaches
or the Athletic Department is never above question. Whenasked if therewas anything resembling
a tacit agreement that certain coaches had a certain
numberof admissionseach year, herresponse was
a terse "don't we wish."
Mamlet also characterized the Athletic Department as eager and "particularly organized" when it
comes to going after future talent. By comparison,
the College's Music Department does not try to
contact students with a demonstrated talent for
voice or musical instrument. Gerald Levinson, the
Chair of the College's Music and Dance Department recalled that when the music program once
tried to institute a phone campaign to actively
pursue talented musicians, the targeted students
reacted as if they thought it somewhat "unseemly."

It was also clear that athletes, coaches, athletic
officials and admissionsofficers feltathletics have
an undeniablypositive impact both on student life
at Swarthmore and in encouraging multi-talented
students to attend theCollege. To demonstratethe
academic caliber of many of the men on his team,
Wimberly pointed to the fact that the Centennial
Conference has honored 14men' s basketball players in the last two years; 7 of those honored were
Swarthmore students while the other 9 colleges in
the conference combined to provide the remaining half. Just as important, in Coach Davis' mind,
is the way in which she sees the time management
skills of student-athletes improving in relation to
when they are not involved in athletics: "They
look at 21 hours of the day more closely if they
know they're going to spend 3 hours at the pool."

History, as well as double majors.
Not all departments have a large numberof
majors. Five sophomores have declared their
major as either Music or Dance, nine are
Studio Art majors and five Art History majors.
Five more have turned their major declaration forms in to the Classics department,
while the Medieval Studies program has received major declaration forms from three
sophomores, and also from one who intends
to minor in the area.
"Since all these students had expressed
interest in the program since their first year,
I wasn't surprised at the number," says
Stephen Bensch, chair of Medieval Studies.
"In the smaller programs on campus, students
identify their interests at quite an early date
and have already had considerable contact
withthe faculty they wish to work withby the
time they submit their sophomore papers."
The Black Studies departmentalsoreceived
a minimal number of declaration/concentration forms. They presently have "between
four to seven 'concentrators' in the class of
'99, but things are still very much in flux right
now," says coordinator and English professor Peter Schmidt. "We usually gain some
concentrators for a particular graduating class
during that class' junior or even senior year,

as students realize they can supplement their
major...with Black Studies."
In recent years the number ofconcentrators
in the department has ranged from 2 to 10 per
graduating class, and enrollment appears to
be increasing. However, says Schmidt, "many
folks who take one or more classes crosslisted in Black Studies choose not to 'concen-

trate' in it."
The Philosophy department has gained ten
interested sophomores, which is about parfor
the course since the department averages
around 12-13 graduating majors per year. At
the moment, two thirds of the number have
expressed an interest in doing Honors work,
while one student plans upon completing a
double major.
However, Philosophy chair Richard
Eldridge says that "the number [of majors]
often rises slightly over the last two years.
Students tend to come to philosophy later in
their careers." Like the Philosophy department, the department of Religion also received ten declarationof major forms, as well
as three requests for double majors and two
for Honors.
Presently, 18 sophomores have turned in
major declarationsto the Engineering department, while 12others have thrown their lot in
with the Math department. Among the proposed Math majors are one student who has
professed an interest in doing an Honors

major, two others who chose Math as an
Honors minor, three who indicate that they
are contemplating a double major, and nine
course majors.
However, many departments have expressed uncertainty as to how many majors
they expect. Says Linguistics chair Donna Jo
Napoli, "our numbers are pretty fluid now,
but...we always have the resources to cover
our small group of happy students."
There are presently eight Linguistics majors in the junior and senior class, two of
whom are enrolled in the new Honors program. Figures indicate that approximately
half of the Linguistics majors wind up completing a double major, and go abroad during
junior year.
Although most sophomores have turned in
their Major Declaration form to the department they wish to major in, the decision is
anything but final. "At the stage of handing in
the blue sheets, many sophomores are seriously clueless about the details of what they
plan to do," says Welbon. "The ideas evolve
through the advising and thinking process."
This week, sophomores are wrapping up
their meetings with their assigned advisors.
The advising process ends this week, and
sophomores will spend part of the weekend
mapping out their plans for the next two
years. Sophomore papers are due this Monday, February 24, by noon.

One More Thing

One of the best parts about a Swarthmore education is the sense that

students and faculty work together in academic pursuits. Virtually none of our
professors are just professors: rather, they are also doing research, writing
books, or doing some similarly worthy activity in the real world outside

Swarthmore. A crucial part of this academic freedom for faculty stems from
their leave schedule; though it varies somewhat by department, professors
typically have a one-semester paid leave every three years.
And yes, these leaves are essential for our professors: they do come back
rejuvenated, with a book completed or research finally done and full of
enthusiasm and new experiences to share with their students. Swarthmore is
currently one of the few colleges which are named on lists of both the best
faculty and the best researchers.
But the hard part is the time when they are gone. For several years now, the
faculty and administration have been altering the current Honors program in
an attempt to encourage more students to participate in it. Unfortunately, the
College does not seem to be adequately balancing its goals with reality.
Swarthmore has a limited faculty, and when several professors are on leave
during the same semester, the number of Honors seminars offered is drastically reduced. Departments typically fluctuate from offering as many as five
or as few as one seminars per semester. The Political Science department, for
example, in the Fall of 1997 will only be offering one seminar in addition to
the Senior Honors Colloquium.
If the College is going to make a commitment to improving and expanding
the Honors program, then it is essential that itaddress the needsof the students
as well as the faculty. One seminar per semester doesn't offer a whole lot of
freedom of choice. Perhaps more departments should consider the new
course-plus option; this option now allows students to take certain combinations of courses, attachments, or theses which together can count as a twocredit preparation for an Honors exam. This option is not perfect because it
is not available for every course, and it denies students the opportunity of the
actual seminar experience, but it does allow them an expanded selection.
The real solution seems to be that departments should either think more
carefully about the criteria for who is allowed to teach Honors seminars, or
else coordinate leave schedules so that several professors in each department
are on-campus and teaching their Honors seminars in any given semester.

Uniformity essential to sophomore advising
Swarthmore is a school of individuals: we recruit individual thinkers as
professors, administrators, students, and staff. We like people who think in
different ways, who are willing to approach obstacles from different angles
in order to seek solutions. But this individuality has a tendency to overcomplicate some issues.
Case in point: it's sophomore paper time again. Now the interesting thing
about sophomore papers is that although all sophomores have to write them
and all sophomores have to turn them in, the timebetween when they find this
information out and when the papers have to be submitted to the Registrar's
office differs entirely from student to student.
The sophomore paper season is supposed to be a timefor exciting exploration and reflection. For many of us, it is our first chance to see our lives at
Swarthmore truly come together; a chance for us to look more closely at what
we actually want to accomplish here.
At first, the process appears to be harmless: there are advisors to help us
write our papersand plan our course loads, departmentmeetings to outline our
requirements, lists full of classes and seminars we can take. And we believe
that the faculty and administration are trying to make this process as easy and
straightforward as possible.
It's just that they don't appear to agree on the easiest way to do it. Different
departments and even some professors within the same department go about
the process of advising their sophomores in entirely different ways.
Because the College is not consistent with its policies and schedules, the
process of writing sophomore papers has become confusing for many students. Some departments require their proposed majors to select advisors;
others randomly assign them. Some professors like to see drafts of sophomore
papers; others simply want to make sure their advisees are on the right track.
Some advisors only want to talk about how a student plans to complete the
majorrequirements; some want to talk about academic rationale and different
options and paths the students can take to get the most out of their time at
Swarthmore.
But all these different standards mean that students can easily become
confused on what has to be done and why and when. We are supposed to
reflect in a calm manner but instead become harried in our scrambles to
receive enough information and finish on time.
This seems to be one ofthese situations in which theCollege needs to decide
on a single policy and encourage all faculty and students to follow it.
Obviously faculty members will each interact with their advisees in their own
way, but the basics need to be the same among every department. Students
need to know how they get an advisor, how they set up appointments, and how
many times they should plan to meet together. The student-advisor relationship can and should differ, but the benefits of this relationship should not.

War On Drugs May Be War On People
By

Faculty leaves should not affect Honors study

Vincent Jones

to curb drug use, especially among

Did you know that a recent study
found that one in threeBlack males is
engaged in the criminal "justice" system in some facet? Some may be in
prison, awaiting trial, on their way to
the police station, or preparing for the
end on death row. Did you know that
a large portion of those AfricanAmerican
men came in
contact with
the criminal
"justice"
system as a
result of a
victimless
crime and
most often
for a drug
charge? Despite media
hype about
an increase in violent crime (which,
in actuality, has been declining for
over five years now,) most AfricanAmerican men wound up in prison
due to drug possession.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm no
advocate of drug abuse. I also feel
that the nation should do something

young people. Unfortunately America
continues to spend billions of dollars
fighting what it believes to be a war
on drugs, when, in reality, taxpayers
have been funding a war on people.
More specifically, Americans have
been paying for a war on primarily
the poor,Latino/as and Black people.
Consider for example that a person
found with the expensive powder
cocaine (popular among the well-todo) must be in possession of 100
times as much powder as of the
cheaper crack cocaine to receive the
same punishment. Crack cocaine
tends to be more prevalent in less
affluent communities due to its low
price. Such a difference between the
penalties for possession of two variants of the same drug has placed an
inordinateburden on African-Americans and Latino/as since these groups
comprise a sizeable chunk of most
poor neighborhoods.
To further illustrate the racist implications of the war on drugs, consider where the battles are fought.
Very seldom do we hear of police or
Drug Enforcement Aaents conducting sting operations to crack down on
campus drug use. Quite to the con-

trary, police spend their time rooting
drugs out of the inner city. Law enforcement officials cite the prevalence ofdrugs in such neighborhoods
as their rationale for their activities.
If this is in fact the case, then why
aren't police and DEA officials targeting college campuses?
Granted, drug abuse does pose a
problem in most urban areas. However, I would bet thatsimilar amounts
of drugs can be found insidethe ivory
tower as in the deteriorating cores of
our nation's cities. Most of the law
enforcement officials went to college
and should have seen the rampant
drug use first hand. I bet that the
prisons would better reflect our
nation's racial and socioeconomic
diversity if college campuses were
targeted just as much as the inner city
in the war on drugs.
Yet something tells me that this
would never happen. Despite the
heavy volume of drugs in both environments, one thing separates the two.
Inner cities tend to be predominantly
Black and/or Latino and lower income whereas students at college
campuses generally come from
middle and upper class families with
white skin. And in this country, wealth

and white skin has its privileges.
Now, I'm sure that other factors
color the decision of law enforcement to focus primarily on predominantly lower-income communities of
color. Nonetheless, one cannot ignore the questions raised by such
actions and feel comfortable with the
unequal justice which results.
To make matters worse, those most
affected by theso-called war on drugs
often cannot afford sufficient legal
representation. Moreover, legal services provided by public defenders
tend to be inadequate. Overburdened
by huge caseloads, public defenders
cannot be expected to protect the
rights of those receiving their services.
The frequency of plea bargains instead of providing a quality defense
demonstrates the lack of justice received by those who cannot afford
good lawyers.Until America rids the
criminal "justice" system of its bias
against certain groups, the racial
make-up of prisons will continue to
misrepresent the true diversity of
criminals. And this nation will continue to be two nations, separate and
unequal. Is that your vision of
America?

Point/Counterpoint
Swarthmore Should Consider Whether Race Counts More Than Other Factors in Recruitment
By Hillary Thompson

Swarthmore says it values diversity. The Admissions Office has instituted widespread recruitment of
people of color, bringing some incredibly qualified applicants. Swarthmore is correct in valuing diversity
and the different views it brings with
it. Diversity exists in many ways in
our community, and each brings valuable contributions to the education of
other students. However, there are a
finite number of spots at Swarthmore, and only 32% of the students
who want those spots can have them.
More specifically, 24% of the white
students who wish to be Swatties get
the chance, while students of color
are accepted at the rate of 46% and
some ethnic groups have acceptance
rates as high as 75%. Standards have
not been relaxed for these students.
Targetedrecruiting has been credited
by Robin Mamlet, Dean of Admissions, with causing these unusually
high numbers. "Last year, admissions
was highly successful in terms of
targeted recruiting thatgave us a spectacular group of applicants of color.
This allowed us to accept with pleasure and honor an unusually high
percentage."
These students are qualified, at least
equally, with their contemporaries in
the class. The question is, though,
whether they are so much more qualified than so many disappointed white
students. Say that there are two categories ofstudents applying—qualified and not qualified. In this case,
46% of applicants ofcolor fit into the
category of qualified (I am not disputing that fact), while 24% of the
white students do. Recruiting cannot
account for such discrepancies; if it
can, we should update our recruiting

of white students to ensure that white
students understand how high our
standards are. If recruiting cannot
account for the discrepancies among
qualified students who are accepted,
there must be other factors which
count in favor of the studentsofcolor.
In this way Swarthmore considers
the race of a qualified applicant as a
merit toward getting that student one
of the coveted seats in Lang during
orientation.
Swarthmore admissions has a philosophy which states: "Swarthmore
wants an admissions process which
recognizes that talents in this country
may be spread in many different
ways." This philosophy is used to
directly address the issue of racial
guidelines foradmissions. The problem with applying this philosophy
here, however, is that racial differences aren't talents.
Racial differences may lead to different talents, but they are not unique
in this regard. Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, family structures, city vs. rural communities, and religious affiliations will
have, by necessity, developed different talents. What is wonderful about
Swarthmore is the way that it revels
in these diverse talents.
The question lies in the institutionalization of the value of specific talents. Just as white society has historically become complacent in its definition of talents (the old white establishment valuing who you know, not
who you are,) Swarthmore admissions remains careful not to label
students of color as automatically
having recognizable talents without
the same level of scrutiny. This threatens the continued diversity of student
talentsby giving less explicit validity
to other experiences such as sexual

preference, family situations, or
survivor's issues (this is especially
true since many of these other determiners of talent are less recognized
in both the Swarthmore culture and
the "outside world").
What is race that makes it different
from other forms of diversity? Race
affects an individual in two ways:
who an individual is, and how people
treat him/her. This is not a unique
situation which relates only to race.
People are never going to be treated
in exactly the same way, nor should
they. People are different and this
should be acknowledged in theirtreatment. However, when race is concerned, one is discussing worse treatment. One must grant that racism
exists; this is a fact. Also facts: sexism, ageism, and classism. The attributes which cause each of these
prejudices are just as clear to the
casual observer as race.
All attributes, easily recognizable
or not, affect who a person is. All
attributes combine to form the individual. A person then has the right to
express themselves through their appearance; to expect anything different would be akin to asking a person
of color to dye their skin white.
There are people in the world who
will hate because of perceptions, no
matter what those are. We must accept that there are many people in the
world who are looking for an excuse
to treat anyone worse, and those excuses do not discriminate. Race is not
the cause of racism. Sex is not the
cause of sexism. All these things are
products of hate, and people are very
adept at hating for any number of
reasons. If a person wants to hate
blindly, they will find a way to, regardless of race.
Is Swarthmore College admissions

the right place to right the wrongs of
society? Here the issue of, "Do two
wrongs make a right?" applies. Yes,
we want to right society's wrongs.
Yes, we want equality. The problem
is that this is college. This is a very
big deal, a life-defining institution.
We are all young. We haven't had
time to discriminate, to be the causes
of the wrongs of society. We just
want to go to college, the best one
that we can. This is true across the
color spectrum. The applicants to
Swarthmore have worked hard to get
to a position where they could even
apply. It is wrong to deny someone
their dream based on race. Who cares
what the institutional power structures in society are? These are kids,
kids with dreams, and we should treat
them as such.
The Admissions Office looks not
at what is fair for the applicant group
but what is best for the College. I
submit that what is fair for the applicant group is best for the College.
Swarthmore is very much an individualist organization. The size of
classes, availability of professors,
popularity of seminars, and flexibility of the administration all attest to
that. All these things are the major
selling points which the Admissions
Office points to proudly when trying
to sell the college to upcoming students.
These same students are then the
ones who apply, and who are being
selected along different lines than the
individualistic message would lead
them to believe. It's time to realize
the dreams of students, not white
students or black students, but students. If we follow that ideal, we
don't need to fear for the future of
diversity at Swarthmore. The strength
ofindividuals' talents will assure that.

College Should Maintain Top-Priority Commitment to Racial Diversity in Admissions Practices
By

Ben Fritz

&

Brendan

Nyhan

Swarthmore College has a longstanding commitment to diversity
dating back to its founding. Swarthmore was, for example, only the second coeducational institution in the
country at the time of its founding.
More recently, the College has recognized the importance of racial diversity as a key institutional goal,
which it attempts to achieve through
admissions policies.
These recruiting efforts do not take
place in a vacuum, however. The
College exists in the context of modern-day America and must consider
the circumstances affecting both the
College itself and the students applying. Robin Mamlet, Dean of Admissions, and the admissions staff recognize that students come from different circumstances and have had varying degrees of economic and educational opportunity.
Minorities have been historically
under-represented at Swarthmore. To
correct this problem, the College has
chosen to pursue racial and ethnic
diversity in the student body. When
the admissions office goes about deciding which students should be offered a place in the class, it is faced
with a vast pool of students, more of
whom are academically qualified to

attend S warthmorethan space allows.
However, to the Admissions Office,
qualifications are not reducible to
quantifiable factors, but are rather
the sum of a variety of factors and
individual merits. As part of its judgment of these non-academic factors
when selecting from the many qualified students, S warthmoreadmissions
places an emphasis on reaching its
goal of diversity.
The first priority of Swarthmore
must be what is good for the College,
conceived broadly as diversity but
specifically as racial diversity. This
must take precedence over the perceived "rights" of applicants, which
are defined differently by different
people and are impossible for the
College to fulfill to the satisfaction of
all. The students apply to Swarthmore; it does not work the other way
around.
The general statement of the admissions office includes the following: "Swarthmore College must
choose its students on the basis of
their individual future worth to society and of their collective realization
of the purpose of the College." The
College's overall goal is not to provide the educational opportunity every qualified applicant wouldreceive
in an ideal world. Swarthmore is a
selective private institution that

chooses the standards by which it
judges applicants to create the type of
class it wishes. Seeking to achieve a
racially diverseclass is not a "wrong."
It is a right. The College has an institutional purpose to fulfill when admitting students, in addition to its
goal of educating those selected.
The argument that other factors
contribute to diversity just as much
as race is partially valid. Race is certainly not the only component of diversity. However, other factors are
not as easily recognizable by society,
making race a larger issue. While a
hypothetical student could be shaped
by a family problem, she is able to
choose whether to allow a casual
observer to know this, and thus judge
her based on it. On the other hand,
race is visible and cannot be avoided
or hidden. This hypothetical student
cannot hide her racial or ethnic origins. It is clear that race is not just a
part ofdiversity ofexperience. Rather,
it is a factor that affects every individual in how their lives are shaped
that must correspondingly be weighed
heavily in admissions decisions.
The College, moreover, takes many
non-academic factors into account,
many of which are arguably less important than race. "It is the policy of
the College to have the student body
represent not only different parts of

the United States but many foreign

countries, both public and private
secondary schools, and various economic, social, religious and racial
groups. The Collegeisalso concerned
to include in each class sons and

daughters of alumni and ofmembers
of the Society of Friends," states the
Swarthmore admissions general statement. Students are denied admittance
inplace of legacyapplicants, yet there
is little controversy. Similarly, the
College seeks to have a class with, for
example, enough athletes to keep our
teams competitive, enough engineers
to keep our engineering program at a
high quality level, enoughpolitically
active students to keep the Swarthmore activist tradition strong, and
enough musicians for the music program. These are all parts of achieving
a great Swarthmore community and
surely no one would deny their necessity. Racial diversity is just as
necessary.
The College exists as it does now
because it, as an institution, pursued
its own agenda, with the result being
the Swarthmore that we all chose to
attend. If not for the diversity ofbackgrounds, interests, and viewpoints that
come from a consciously created,
diverse community, Swarthmore
would lack the very intellectual vibrancy that makes it great.

The Phoenix

Opinions
Letters to the Editor
Pursuing Passions Is a Valuable Reason for Action; People Working for Beliefs Deserve Respect
To the Editor:
Because Brian Gobin explicitly
requested that people not reply directly to what he wrote in last week's
edition of The Phoenix and although
I am neither Brian Schwartz nor an
"10 frosh," I will honor his request
and respond precisely to what he did
not write. Mr. Gobin did not write
why he felt whathe wrote and that is
why it infuriated me beyond belief. I
am not writing to say that I hold a
different opinion, for better or for
worse, but simply to say that I am
ashamed that a member of our community would consider himself worthy of a pedestal in front of McCabe
library, were we to start building
monuments to "Swarthmore's Man
of the Century."
To speak for myself, I have heard
Mr. Gobin'srhetoric on campus many
times and so I would gladly rob him
of the honor of having an original
iconoclastic thought. Plenty of folks
come to Swarthmore and revel in the
isolation only to decide one day that
there is a real world out there.
Where I stand, however, I do not
think this is a bad thing. Change in
perspective is something that is very
important but not nearly as important
as recognizing and learning from that
development, growth, and maturation. I think what Mr. Gobin points
out is a worthy point but one that
should be entitled 'what I see in the
mirror' rather than an insult such as

he chose. This is an emotional and
philosophical transition we go
through individually within the care
of our friends and our professors.
My hope is that, as any thought
should, Mr. Gobin' s will develop and
revise itself. I would invite him to
write a short piece on why he feels
this way. Why does he understand
this better than any of us? What has
he done or seen that we haven't that
gives him such clairvoyance? I would
like to see him express it respectfully
rather than brutishly and arrogantly.
Further, I would like to make a
flamingly liberal point about freedom of speech, ifI may stretch it that
far. People, amazingly enough, have
a right to be concerned with whatever
they please.
An individual should respond to
the tremors in his or her heart when a
story or an event makes their heart
beat withrage, frustration, or love. I,
for one, had never heard of Burma
before folks on campus began an
awareness raising campaign. I am
confident that Mr. Gobin reads The
New York Times as such a powerful
intellectual as he is sure to do. In
which case he would have seen the
article a few weeks ago in which
Pepsi declared (at least) it would pull
its economically-supportive operation out of Burma because of popular
pressures in the States. Did the CEO
of
walk
around
PepsiCo
Swarthmore's campus reading side-

walks on any given day last semester? Probably not, but when thousands of people around the country
stopped to look at the message, just as
you did, they gave it some consideration and respect, just as you didn't.
I do need to respond specifically to
one sentence in which Mr. Gobin
says that consciousness raising,
awareness and protests are not productive in the real world. First, I am
aghast that Mr. Gobin considers
awareness unproductive, lest most of
the public health efforts of this postmedieval sanitation era are for naught.
My point is that we all have our
personal biases for what is productive—mine, and I welcome criticism,
is direct action, most often community service because it is my personal
experience. Community service is
what I have chosen to do because it is
right for me; not because my experiences have given me expertise on
another place or another people, nor
because I feel I am personally responsible for any body of change but
because those experiences helped me
understand mvself and my place
among those other people, their
places, and their own needs and ideas
whether near or far—and thatincludes
Swarthmore. I have heard speeches
and watched protests that I personally thought were wastes of timebut
which brought others to tears ofpassion and inspired others to work together and ultimately, sometimes

immediately, created needed change.
I understand no argument against
accepting another individual's preferences except where they are harmful or actively hurtful to others however small change may be, it is something to someone and nobody has any
right to take that away from them.
I hope my point is clear—this is not
meant as a personal attack on the
author of"Swarthmorestudents need
to get real" —this is a loud message
that we need to respect each other's
opinions and interests. We need to
recognize that our neighbors are passionate people and, if they are to
respect our position, we need to respect theirs.
I am glad that Mr. Gobin shared
his enlightened view with us and I
hope that others will do the same
about the issues that keep them up at
night (even after they have finished
the required and recommended reading for tomorrow's Very Important
seminar) because there is something
in another city, another community,
in another person's heart that makes
them care.
I think passion is our greatest gift,
friends. I came to Swarthmore to celebrate in a community of passionate,
open-minded and accepting people. I
hope intolerant and self-righteous
people and opinions find themselves
away from the pulpit for a while to
gain a fresh perspective.

Admissions Office Deserves Credit for Efforts to Improve Diversity in Recruitment, Admissions
To the Editor:
In last week's lead editorial, "Diversity in admissions needs to be
maintained," you expressed concern
over the administration's recent decision to admit more students through
the early admissions process. You
admonish the Admissions Office for
possibly backing down from their
mission of accepting minorities to
S warthmore College. While we agree
that increasing diversity in admissions is of the utmost importance, we
feel that the editorial was misleading
in its logic and at times irresponsibly
inflammatory. At the very least, the
editorial was devoid ofmanifest cause
for criticizing the Admissions Office. We believe that a closer look at
the evidence indicates that in many
ways the Admissions Office is doing
a remarkable job of attempting to
increase Swarthmore's level of ethnic diversity.
Indeed, the facts presented in your
editorial itself validatethis point. The
editorial begins by conceding that
while last year only 11 students of
color were admitted early, this year
the number rose to 30. These numbers are generally low, but all agree
that this is primarily due to the fact
that "students of color do not tend to
apply early" to colleges. Despite the
low number of minority early applicants (56 this year) to Swarthmore,
the percentage of minority students
accepted early went up from 10% to
over 20%.
But despite this initial evidence to
the contrary, you oddly disagree that
we are moving in the right direction.
You mention first that"the number of
spaces which have been left open for
all students, but especially students
of c010r... In the regular admissions
process will be sparse." This is compounded, you say, by the fact that the
size of the class of 2001 is projected
to decrease from 400 (in the class of
2000) to 350-360 students.

The editorial then strangely seems
of the Admissions Office by stating that "our
ranking for competitiveness will go
up because such a small percentage
ofregular admissions applicants will
be admitted." Incredibly, the editorial suggests that the Admissions
Office may actually be trying to decrease the number of minority admittances with its new policies. "All of
these decisions [to decrease the number ofregular admittances] were made
with the knowledge that students of
color tend to apply during the regular
admission process...and while we are
not at all convinced that the decisions
were made with this fact in mind...."
There's a very good reason why you
were not convinced
you offer no
evidence pointing even remotely in
that direction.
The Admissions Office appears to
be taking huge steps to insure that
more minority students are offered
admission. Not only did the percent
of minority students accepted more
than double, but 30 students of color
were admitted out of only 56 who
applied. Implying that Swarthmore
accepted more students early so as to
increase their "competitiveness
rankings" is silly—they accepted
more students early because almost
twice as many students applied early
this year. And in spite of this, they
only accepted 35% more students
early than they did last year. Even if
there is reason to fear that increasing
the number of early admitteesendangers the diversity of the school, it is
clear that the Admissions Office directly responded to this concern by
increasing the proportion of students
admitted early.
But we are not convinced that increasing the number of early
admittees in and of itself endangers
the diversity of the school. We took
out our solarcalculator and #2 pencil
and got to work. The school admitted
to impugn the motivation

—

11 students of color early last year,
and about 144came overall. If you do
the math, it ends up that slightly more
than 45 percent of the students of the
class of 2000 who were accepted
during normal admissions were of
color. Now, for this year, assuming
that 355 students end up coming to
Swarthmore, if the college simply
maintains the 45 percent figure above,
then we will again end up with an
encouraging year for admitting students of color, with about the same
percent of students of color in the
class of 2001 as in the class of 2000
around 35 to 36 percent. This means
a significant increase in overall student ethnic diversity—which is currently under 27 percent.
There is absolutely no evidence to
suggest that the school will accept a
lower proportion of students of color
during the regular admissions process than in previous years. Simply
accepting some more students during
the early admissionsprocess does not
pose a threat to admitting ethnic minorities. As the above evidence indicates, the Admissions Office has done
nothing to endanger diversity admissions, nor has it been negligent in its
duty to increase the diversity ofSwarthmore College.
If all your editorial board wants to
do is exhort the Admissions Office to
maintain high levels of diversity, then
that's an admirable, if somewhat
uncontroversial, message. But instead, you
the Admissions
Office by raising doubts about their
admissions procedures, and questioned their commitment to diversity
admissions without providing any
evidence or alternatives. There is
nothing "discouraging" about the
Admissions numbers, or the Admissions Office's actions so far this year.
And if there is, we sure couldn't figure out what it was from your editorial.
You assert that "we have to worry
—

about the way admissions procedures
for this year were designed," yet you
never give the reader substantive reasons for concern, other than speculation, conjecture, and what amounts to
conspiracy theories.
If anything, the criticism in this
case may be misplaced. The Admissions Office is clearly doing everything it can to reward ethnic diversity
among those students who apply to
Swarthmore. Still, the level of diversity at Swarthmore is not wheremany
of us would like it to be. If we were to
pinpoint the problem, we might suggest that it lies in recruiting students
of color to actually apply to Swarthmore in the first place. And yet your
editorial actually posits that the recent recruitment practices of the Admissions Officehave been extensive,
and have resulted in excellent returns. So we're left wondering again
exactly why you have targeted the
Admissions Office for attack.
We've criticized administration officials in the past. But we also think
that they should get credit where it's
due. Furthermore, if and when criticism is justified, it should be clear
and constructive, not vague and vindictive. We believe that Robin
Mamlet and the rest of the Admissions Board deserve commendation
and not criticism for their efforts over
the last few years to begin to overcome a disconcerting tendency of
minority students to avoid coming to
Swarthmore.
Ifthey diverge from this goal, then
constructive prodding and criticism

Students Should Consider Economic Theory
To the Editor:
In the midst of preparing for a class
discussion on noncooperative
oligopolistic behavior and strategies
that can be employed to raise a firm's
profits in a "dog eat dog" market
environment, (and during one ofmy
scheduled procrastination periods), I
came across an article written by
George Soros entitled "The Capitalist Threat." At the risk of sounding
extremely melodramatic, it was amply epiphenomenal. While I have long
admired George Soros for his business prowess and ability to feel the
pulse offinancial markets all over the
world, his philosophical discourse
was certainly not something I gave a
second thought about. Having devoured his thoughts over three times,
however, in the past week, I have
come to the conclusion that every
Swattie should take a minute or two
to ponder the meteoric importance

is becoming more and more plagued
by inequality and instability due to
this pervading ideology. Because the
prevailing doctrine of laissez-faire
capitalism is built upon a false edifice—perfect knowledge held by
mankind—our "open society," which
recognizes that human beings don't
know everything and differ in all
matter of opinion, is being threatened.
Increasingly, laissez-faire capitalism is being seen as the answer to the
world's many problems. In the past,
"beneath the individual preferences
that found expression in market behavior, people were guided by a set
of moral principles that found expression in behavior outside the scope
ofthe market mechanism." However,

Liberals Defeat Their Own Goals With Outrageous Tactics
By

Brian Gobin

Although S warthmorelikes to boast
about its intellectual rigor and socially conscious students, we really
have a lot of clueless people roaming
around the hill. My gripe with the left
is that it is dominated by half-wits
full of bogus rhetoric. Lefties like to
think they are one with people, champions of the poor, broad-minded, tolerant, and intellectually sophisticated.
But in reality, they're a bunch of
elites that are totally out of sync with
mainstream America.
America is fundamentally a society thatrides down the middle of the
road. At various historical moments,
we see the country swaying a little to
the left or a little to the right but never
too far from center.
What annoys me about lefties is
they often do more harm than good
because their hearts might sometimes
be in the right place but their heads
are someplace else. The first rule in
American politics is don't alienate

the moderates unless you want a conservative backlash. People like
George Wallace and Richard Nixon
gained popular support partially due
to the moronic tacticsof pathetic white
youth. In 1968, Joe American turned
on his TV to watch the Democratic
National convention, and instead saw
goofy-dressed white youth battling
police in the streets ofChicago. And
Joe American voted for Richard
Nixon.
It's so ironic that those idealistic
white youth thought they were doing
the world a favor by exposing the
corruption in the system, and instead
they helped destroy the Democrats
and elect Nixon. Even more ironic,
the lefties, so-called champions of
the working class, got their peaceful
asses whipped by angry working class
police in the quintessential working
class city.
If you want to accomplish any permanent changes, always remember
that the moderates have to support
you. The second rule is don't scare

the institutions. Our society is run by noyed. People are more interested in
its institutions: business, industry, solutions than problems. Joe "middlegovernment, and organized interest class" American wants to see the
groups. Our institutions wield enorpoor take initiative. Joe takes pride

Forget about trying to "expose" pay attention to Joe, so Joe starts

injustice. If you expose too much for case that society as a whole would

deliver the sales pitch to the people

paying for it.
Most important, Joe has the attention span of a chipmunk. Joe gets his
information from the six o'clock
news, USA Today, and weekly periodicals. The headlines change every
day right along with Joe's perception
about what's important in the nation.
Joe probably knows more details
about the O.J. Simpson case than
about how city government spends
its 50 million dollars in tax revenue.
You only inform Joe about what's
going on when you want to tell him
what's working well or when you
want Joe to take a specific course of
action. Otherwise, Joe should only
get information upon request.
Meanwhile, your special interest
group lobbies the hell out of the key
decision-makers to get the desired
outcome. The key decision-makers
only see you and your army of support, and you will get what you want
if you have enough leverage, and

decision-makers don't think Joe
would be particularly offended if he
found out about the deal. There are
many situations where Joe doesn't
count.

Now as much as I'd like to ditch on
conservatives and libertarians, there
is really no point because they don't
count on this campus and it'd be like
persecution of a minority. As for the
lefties, their tactics are self-defeating
and theirintellectual arguments could
only persist where there is little serious scrutiny. Under the guise of respecting everybody's damn point of
view, we are willing to tolerate a
whole lot of ignorance in the public
arena, and a good amount of ignorance stays under the table because
people are afraid to say what's on
their mind.
I really don't see this situation
changing, and that's unfortunate because it is a loss to society that people
who are passionate about improving
the world are less effective than they
could be.

Senior's vacation begins

with criminal truckers
and Mardi Gras in between
—

My

adventure in New Orleans started
when the Ultimate Frisbee team
decided to enter the Mardi Gras
tournament in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Five
Swatties, including Ali Momeni '97, Mike
Morton '97, Tim Sibley '9B, Matt Lowler
'96, and myself, joined forces with Haverford to defeat the University of Virginia and
Texas University. Although everyone went
down to party on Bourbon Street for one
night, I did not want to waste the twenty-two
hour drive and miss all the parades and the
festivities of "Fat Tuesday." I was caught up
in the Mardi Gras spirit of throwing caution
to the wind. Even though I had no place to
sleep and no way to get back, I decided to
stay.
When the guys left on Sunday, I checked
thelist ofSwat alums generated by our Alumni
Office. I called up Darin Friess '95, now a
student at Tulane Medical School, and said,
"Hi, my name is Bob and I'm a senior at
Swarthmore. I don't know you, but can I
possibly sleep at your house?" To my surprise, he was kind enough to agree to my
ludicrous request.
Being a Swattie, I could not avoid academic work even in New Orleans: I had a
nudity project for my photography class. In

other words, I had to take pictures of naked
people. This was not hard during Mardi Gras
as chants of "show your tits," "show your
bush," and "show your dick" echoed throughout Bourbon Street. In fact, there were
enoughpictures to fill up five rolls of film (if
you really want proof, just stop by my room).

If I had to give an estimate, I would say that
you could see a pair of breasts every two
minutes and men and women's private parts
every half hour. People did not, however,
expose themselves gratuitously. The possession of beads allowed you to walk up to
anyone and demand that they expose them-

selves or give you a long, wet kiss.
By now, you are probably wondering where
you can get some beads. Well, for one thing,
Swatties probably would not go for the Mardi
Gras approach, and instead of seeing their
private parts, you just might get a sexual
harassment charge. If you happen to be in
New Orleans for Mardi Gras, however, you
can get beads if you pay for them (lame),
catch them at parades, or expose yourself. I
got most of my beads through the Bacchus,
Bards, Orpheus, Zulu, and Rex parades. In
fact, I could not even fit my hands around all
the beads I gathered. It can be tiring to wear
five pounds ofbeads around your neck while
partying, but let me assure you that it is well
worth the hassle.
One of the most memorable occasions during Mardi Gras was what I would characterize as a "Breast Riot." A gorgeous and wellendowed woman was standing on top of the
balcony teasing the crowd. She received bead
offerings from at least twenty men. A flood
lamp was shone on her, and crowds from
within a one-block radius were converging
toward this one spot. The streets were already
completely saturated with people—so when
this woman decided to strut her stuff, the
crowds pushed and shoved to get a better
look. The resulting madness was unparalleled to anything I have ever witnessed or
experienced. The crowd was grabbing anything they could find and hung on to lampposts and doorways for dear life. People near
the walls were flattened while the masses
near the middle were tossed about in a frenzy.
If anyone had fallen by accident, he or she
could have easily been trampled to death.The
lesson here is: never underestimate the power

of breasts
At midnight on Tuesday, police on horses
lined up at the end of Bourbon Street and
marched straight down the road to clear the
crowds out for Ash Wednesday. This was
when it dawned on me that I had to get back
to Swat. Sure I could have taken a plane back,
but in the spirit of Mardi Gras, I decided to
skip the whole week ofclasses and hitchhike
instead. It took me two and a half days to
cover the 1,600 miles between New Orleans
and Swarthmore. I had to switch rides seven
times and battle the Northern snow storm
before reaching our beloved college.
Most of my rides were with truckers who
carried everything from sunglasses to
fishmeal. To say that these truckers lead
interesting lives would be an understatement.
Most of themhad been divorcedseveral times,
and having nine kids was normal. One of the
truckers had been in jail three times, stolen
various cars, and smoked a quarter pound of
pot a week. One trucker had stolen goods in
his truck and told me he hoped the cops would
not stop us. Another trucker was an architect
for some bridges in New Jersey before he
went to jail for laundering money. He also
had a three-year ongoing court case with the
IRS. Yet another trucker drank a six-pack
while he was driving, and told me that he was
once raped by three women at a truck stop.
The capricious nature of Mardi Gras allowed
me to come in contact with stimulating characters whom I would have never met otherwise. One thing's for sure, I will never see
truckers in the same light again. In this short
week, I have learned more than a semester of
classes could have taught me, and most importantly, I am glad that I am still alive.

Two Careers and Family

Napoli Believes in Power Of Self- Exploration Of the Mind
Gabriel Cumming
Rachel McKnight

By
&

"My life has been a series of accidents,"
says Donna Jo Napoli, director of
Swarthmore's linguistics program and writer
ofchildren's books. "There are some people
who plan their lives —I didn't." This seems
to be Napoli's general view of her past, but it
is not a negative view; she wouldn't have it
any other way. As she explains, "there's also
serendipity." She may attribute her success
to serendipity; it seems to us that it might be
result of her remarkable intensity, interest,
and passion for exploration. At any rate, she
now leads a very rich life, as a satisfied
linguist, a successful writer, and a mother of
five.
How did Donna Jo discover the field of
linguistics? "I came to it by accident," she
explains. "I was a math major. I loved math,
but I wasn't very good at it.... Nothing else
compared in intellectual appeal." Though a
math major in college, she entered Harvard
Graduate School in Italian. While there, she
took a course in old Provencal taught by a
linguist. Finally she had found her ideal
subject! Linguistics, she explains, is perfect
for people who bring a mathematical approach to language. It's about the structure of
languages. "How languages are different is
much less important than how they're the

same," Donna Jo insists; she has worked to
find these universal similarities. Italian has
continued to be her emphasis, though. "I
became a syntactition who worked on the
structure of Italian." To some extent, this
has been areturn to herroots. "I've...become
Italianized, even though I grew up in an
Italian-American family that was American."
"I utterly believe in my field; I love it!"
Donna Joexclaims. She continues to radiate
enthusiasm for her work. "Linguistics is
great! It's such great training for the mind,
too." Everyone, she believes, should be exposed to the "introspective science," as she
calls it. "If everybody took a linguistics
class, people wouldn't have some of the
stupid ideas" that Donna Jo finds so prevalent. "Linguistic ignorance" is a constant
frustration for her.
Donna Jo's other vocation is writing
children's books, which, she says, makes
sense. "What I deal with" as a linguist "is
how people communicate—so writing
children's stories is natural." Though she
emphasizes that "I did not always want to be
a writer," she has found in recent years that
writing serves a vital inner need: "You almost don't want to be a writer, you have to;
it's like a disease." She doesn't decide who
her stories are appropriate for, however. "I
don't think ofmy books in terms of what age

they're for, I just write."
Donna Jo's small but well-lit Papazian office is plastered with letters she has received
from children in response to her books. She
gleefully recites the whimsical messages that
she has received from all of these young readers. One wrote: "You are the best author I've
ever written...and the only." She laughs.
"They're just insane, these children; they're
really insane..and I love them!" For Donna Jo,
though, insanity isn't all that bad: "I think that
I'm pretty crazy, but I think that most people
are t00...it just depends on what you do with
it."
Some inspiration for her writing has come
from her own experiences as aparent. "I have
lived with children for twenty-two years...l
like listening to them: their voices and their
ideas." She considers her relationship with
her own brood one of mutual understanding:
"my kids know there's no way I'd ever not
listen."
"The things I do tie together," Donna Jo
insists, and it does seem as if they do. They all
involve a creative attention toward the world
and people. For those who, like Donna Jo, are
on a perpetual "journey of self-exploration,"
she offers this advice: "If you're willing to put
out the work, don't let anybody tell you what
to d0....5h00t for what you want." Donna Jo
should know; she's done just that, and has
enjoyed every minute.

Chinese Government forces Tibetans to seek freedom

Documentary Reveals Realities of Oppression in Tibet
By

Last

Jennifer Z. Chen

Friday, MarlboroProductions held
a viewing of the documentary, Home
to Tibet, the Story of Sonant's Return
to His Homeland, in LPAC, sponsored by the
President's office. This film, by Alan Dater
and Lisa Merton, is a journey through the
terrains ofAsia as Sonam Lama retraces the
path towards the home he abandoned twelve
years ago. Sonam says that he abandoned his
family and his home because "I was not free
in my own land." This reason hasalso beenthe
cause for thousands of other Tibetans to emigrate.
Communist China's horrendous violations
ofhuman rights are wellknown. The Chinese
occupation of Tibet is no exception to the
patterns of opposition in the Communist regime. Tales of torture and random imprisonment of Tibetans have circulated around the
globe since 1949 when the Chinese entered
Tibet. Before that time, Tibet had been a
theocracy headed by the Dalai Lama and the
Panchen Lama who are believed to be the
reincarnations ofBuddha. When the Chinese
took over Tibet in 1949, they termed the
takeover as a "liberation" from the feudal rule
of the Lamas.
In some ways, religion (lamasery Buddhism) was stifling the growth of Tibet; according to an article in the December 1996
Philadelphia Inquirer' s Inside Tibet: A Country Tortured series, "construction of buildings was often canceled because 'worms and
insects might easily be killed.'" Religion is
the main driving force in most Tibetans'
lives, which leads to a de-emphasis on things
like the economy and industrialization. For
instance, in the film, when Sonam gives his

sister approximately $3OOO ( an amount
more than most Tibetans make in a lifetime)
before he returns to the U.S., his sister instead of using the money to buy things she
lacks like clothing, she donates the sum to
lamaseries and people who she deems more
unfortunate than her.
This piety can also be seen in the high
position which the Dalai Lama occupies:
not only is he the head of the government, he
is the Buddha incarnate. According to
Sonam, "His Holiness is everything for us."
When Sonam meets the Dalai Lama, he
appears as if he was scared to even look at
His Holiness. He also kowtows to His Holiness three times, which conjures up the
image of the ancient Chinese practice of
prostrating oneself three times in front of the
Emperor, the Son of Heaven.
However, the Dalai Lama is no longer the
"legitimate" leader ofTibet. Hisadministration fled the country in 1959 after an uprising. They have set up an exiled government
in Dharmsala, India. This is also the place
where most Tibetans escape to when they
leave the country in order to be closer to His
Holiness. However, the mass migration of
Tibetans into India has caused some fricition
between the two ethnic groups as competition for jobs increased.
Tibetans have been alienated on both sides
of the Himalayas. In Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet, Sonam has counted over 2,000 Chinese shops and approximately 100 shops
belonging to Tibetans. This large discrepancy between the numbers of Chinese and
Tibetan shops can be attributed to the Chinese efforts to "sinocize" Tibet. The Chinese know that the Tibetan culture is extremely foreign to its own; therefore, it is

trying to curb resistance to its rule in Tibet by
sending more Chinese to Tibet. As of now,
Tibetans are minorities in their own country.
According to Dater, Merton and Sonam,
most Chinese in Tibet loathe being there, as
the conditions are not hospitable. "The Chinese government offer the Chinese perks to
move out to Tibet." said Merton. These "rewards" include highpaying jobs, free housing
and exemption to China's one child per family
policy.
Not only is the ethnic make-up of Tibet
changing, its culture as well. The Chinese
government has effectively eliminated the
teaching of Tibetan history and culture in all
schools. The only Tibetan course allowed in
schools is in the language, which very few
children are exposed to. This is a cause for
concern for most Tibetans as their children
may grow up withoutknowing their ancestors'
culture and history. The only "truths" children
learn in school seem to be the offsprings of
Chinese propaganda.
The exiled Tibetan administration in
Dharmsala is trying to address this issue.
Before Sonam returns to Tibet, His Holiness
tells him to encourage parents to teach their
children the culture and the language. This
concern has led to the establishment of Tibetans schools in India, Nepal and other countries
bordering Tibet established by Tibetan
emigrantes. His Holiness, whose policy of
non-violence has prevented a full-fledged rebellion against the Chinese, sees education as
a solution to preserve the Tibetan way of life
and as a counter to sinocization.
This fear of not knowing one's culture extends into Sonam's personal life. Repeatedly
in the film, he asks his relatives rather facetiously "Would you recognize me if you saw

me in the streets? Would you know me?"
This need for recognition echoes the drastic
changes which Tibet has undergone since the
Chinese occupation. TheTibet today is nothing like the Tibet of yesterday where peace
was more prevalent than physical tortures of
prisoners. The theocracy of the past, with all
its flaws, surpasses the nonsensical oppression of Tibetans by the Chinese government.
Hearing the Chinese brutalities in Tibet
and other violations of human rights makes
me ashamed to be Chinese. I wondered if
Sonam and other Tibetans would hate any

Chinese people just because of what they
have gone through under Chinese rule.
Gyatso, a lama who had been tortured daily in
Chinese jail for over thirty years, said in the
Philadelphia Inquirer interview that he feels
"no hatred, no anger" against his torturers.
The Buddhist spirit of compassion lives on in
these oppressed people. Perhaps it is timefor
the Chinese regime to re-evaluate its policies
in human rights issues. With the death of
China's Communist party leader Deng
Xiaoping on Wednesday, it is the best time
for a new China to emerge.

Carrie Gets Revenge; Axel F Cleans Up Crime
By

Julia Sable

&

Jeremy Mathias

From

the opening scenes of this Friday
night's movie, as we watch high-school
senior Carrie White discover her period for the first time with shock and horror,
we realize she is not a normal teenager. She
screams and staggers out of her high school
shower, and faces the taunting jeers of "Plug
It Up" from her fellow female classmates as
they throw tampons at her.
Thus begins Carrie, a 1976 film directed
by Brian DePalma based on the book by
Stephen King, that spirals from sickening
cruelty into more horrible cruelty into, finally, after muchunbelievablecruelty, a sortof-scary horror wind-up.
Not that the movie is bad. The story is
actually quite interesting. Carrie, played by
Sissy Spacek in one of her earlier movie
roles, is the poster-girl for the word "shy."
Afraid of people (especially teenage boys)
and extremely mopey-looking, she spends
the day in her school library.. .reading about
her telekinetic powers.
According to the movie, the other pupils
spend every moment of their lives either
teasing her or planning how to get her. After
the girls in gym class (including Amy Irving
as good girl Sue and Nancy Allen as bad girl

Chris) get detention from sympathetic gym
teacher Ms. Collins for their tampon-hurling,
Chris orchestrates a scheme that will ruin
Carrie's prom experience. The fact that Carrie is even going to the prom is a consequence
of angelic Sue's making her ambivalent boyfriend Tommy go with her.
Carrie's uniqueness is partially due to her
overbearing, Bible-toting, witch-like, psycho
mother, excellently portrayedby Piper Laurie.
She tries to spread her Christian beliefs
throughout their sleepy little town, explaining to her neighbors that "these are Godless
times."
She also locks poor Carrie in a closet when
she discovers her "devilish" powers. When
Carrie goes off to her "Love Among the
Stars" prom, Mom cries, like a really supportive mother, "They're all gonna laugh at you!"
And they do—but don't worry, Carrie gets
her revenge, and, in the movie's most famous
scene, absolutely annihilates her class like a
really bad habit.
Once again, the movie is not bad. It does,
beside its intriguing Stephen King story, have
some assets to itscredit.There' s Piper Laurie's
wonderful performance, in which she plays
the righteous mom from hell. She practically
steals the movie with her ranting and raving.
Also, directorBrian De Palma has done a nice
job using light, darkness, blood, and Biblical

images as metaphors in his scenes. However,
despite these aspects, we cannot recommend
this movie this week.
Carrie is predictable, as we know early on
that Carrie will turn on her classmates when
she's had the last straw. Also, while Carrie is
not really scary, it is sick—the way Carrie is
treated is horribly degrading. We sympathize
with her, but we also wonder why the director
and producer felt the need to make this movie,
why it was so important to heap so much
abuse upon a single human being. At the
film's end, we are left with a creepy, dissatisfied feeling, not the feeling left after we've
seen a good horror movie and actually enjoyed it.
For a slight change in style, the second
movie playing this weekend is Beverly Hills
Cop, starring a smooth-talking Eddie Murphy.
This hit movie from the early eighties was
popular for a good reason—it is packed with
laughs at bumbling detectives, ineffective
henchmen and the many, many lies by the
main character, Axel Foley. Right from the
opening scene, Foley proves himself to be a
great detective with a penchant for getting
himself into a lot of trouble.
The story opens in Detroit, where Foley is
working as an undercovercop. After an introductory scene, in which he is almost fired for
insubordination, Foley meets his old-time

stumbles groggily through the day, he or she
will notice something. It might be small or
seemingly insignificant, but that something,
nonetheless, catches the eye or touches the
heart and makes the day that much more
bearablefor an otherwise miserably oppressed
workaholic.
Here, for your consumption, are a few of
my favorite things:
Delores, the card checker. We all know
and love her. She's the amiable woman with
the perennial wide smile across her face who
greets you with kind, inspirational words at
8:00 in the morning. When life seems bleakest at that early hour, you can walk into
Sharpies, and Delores, bright-eyed and bushytailed as ever, will make it all better.
The phone system. At that prestigious
school up in New Haven (to be said haughtily
with nose in air), students don't have the
option of recording their own voice mail
greetings. A nasal computer-like voice is the
standard.
But at Swarthmore, we believe in democracy and freedom of choice. You can check
your voice mail from anywhere in the world.

call long-distance from any campus phone,
and even record a personalized greeting. Yes,
it's true! You can sound as humorous or as
dry as you want, and callers still have to sit
through your message. The power...
The comfy chairs by the cappuccino bar.
Enough said.
SEPTA. It stops on campus and reaches
Philadelphia in 23 minutes. It connects with
Amtrak, costs a couple of dollars, and provides the only means of transportation for
freshman and sophomores.
The next time you pass by a SEPTA official, give 'em a friendly wave for me.
As always, though, with the good must
come the bad.
There are some aspects ofSwarthmore that
leave a dry taste in one's mouth (and it's not
just the cheesesteak bar). They are the other
little things that make life that much more
difficult—the ones that, unfortunately, the
guidebooks missed:
Lack of waffle batter. When I walk into
Sharpies on Sunday morning, I might feel
inclined to casually stroll down the stairs,
pour myself a fresh Belgian waffle, and sit
down with one's cholesterol and leisurely
read The New York Times. This is hard to do
without batter.
Often on weekends, I casually walk over to
the waffle makers and, to my horror, find
them dead and dormant. Because of this, I am
forced to forego freshly-made goodness for
5-minute-old pancakes or French toast. This
diminishes the whole Sunday Times experience and puts a damper on one's week. Thank
goodness for Delores.

GW Semester

It should be noted that batter is readily
available at such off-peak times as weekday
evenings, when no one in their right mind
would even think oftouching a Belgian waffle.
I sense a Dining Services cost-saving measure here. Either that or anti-Sunday Timesers
at work.
Bright copper kettles. Just checking. In
the other category.
Living on Parrish 4th. Walking up three
flights of stairs several times a day is brutal.
Brutal. I've even jokingly suggested to our
RA that we hold races up and down the stairs,
to see who can eke out the best time. But he
never listens to me anyway.
Concentrated orange juice. I'm afraid
this subject is rather serious and can't be
treated with sardonic humor.
I'm talking about the orange water that we
are led to believe is "orange juice." Orange
juice, as I recall from the outside world, tastes
somewhat like oranges. It is acidic, pulpy,
and refreshing, as opposed to watery and
sour. It's readily available almost anywhere—except at Swat.
In Sharpies' and Essie Mae's dispensers,
it's from concentrate. The bottles at Essie
Mae's are from concentrate. Even the soda
machine in LP AC that clearly says not from
concentrate is... you guessed it.
It's a crying shame. But at least my grandparents live in Florida, and I can visit them
over spring break.
So there you have it—the plain truth. Now
that I've vented a bit, I'll make it until spring
break, when this young Swattie's fancy will
turn to thoughts of sleep.

As directed by Martin Brest (who has since
gone on to Midnight Run and Scent of a
Woman), and produced by the premier eighties action team, Jerry Bruckheimer and the
late Don Simpson, Beverly Hills Cop is a
crackerjack piece ofentertainment. Between
Murphy's showing off and the huge action
sequences, the movie barely pauses to catch
its breath. A particular highlight is the outof-control garbage truck near the beginning
of the movie.
Of course, this movie was a huge hit and
led to two sequels, both of which are terrible.
The original is the biggest, boldest and the
best.
For anyone who doesn't want to go to
Screw, seeing Beverly Hills Cop is definitely
a good alternative. Eddie Murphy, with his
trademark laugh and hilarious humor, makes
this a great and classic comedy/action flick.
We would definitely classify this one as a
very fun movie.
Carrie plays on Friday at 7:30 and 10 p.m.

friend, Mikey, who has been working in California. Unfortunately, Mikey is shot when he
and Axel return to Axel's apartment that
evening. This sets up the plot for the rest of
the movie, as Axel travels to posh Beverly
Hills, in his worn jeans and sweat shirt, driving a beat-up blue Chevy Nova, to find out
whohad Mikey killed. This mission is against
the explicit order ofFoley's boss, who warns
Axel that he will be fired if he continues his
investigation. But, of course, that's what police captains always say in the movies.
The plot is fairly straightforward, but it
never becomes boring. Far from it—Foley is
constantly getting into one scrape or another,
which leads to some highly amusing quick
thinking (and talking) on Foley's part. He
masquerades as areporter from Rolling Stone,
a homosexual with a venereal disease, and a
customs security officer, to name a few. (This
is very much an 'Bos movie; political
corectness is not among its virtues.)
The laughs don't come only from Foley,
however. The pair of detectives following
Foley inBeverly Hills, Sergeant Taggert (John
Ashton) and Detective Rosewood (Judge
Reinhold), fall prey to many ofFoley's practical jokes.
He has a field day with Taggert's serious,
by-the-book attitude, and Rosewood's wellmeaning naivete. One of the most amusing
episodes involves three bananas, but we'll let
your imagination fill in the rest (don't worry,
it isn't dirty). Victor Maitland is the stereotypical criminal—a suave, slick, rich art dealer
with a British accent. The roles in this movie
are all pretty much stereotypes, but that is
precisely why they work so very well, and,
for the most part, they are really, really funny.
The soundtrack to the movie is very eighties, featuring such hit songs as "The Heat is
On," by Kenny Loggins, "Gratitude" by
Danny Elfman, and "Neutron Dance" by The
Pointer Sisters, as well as Harold
Faltermeyer's classic theme "Axel F." We
thought it was pretty groovy. Another cool
aspect ofthis movieis thatmany where-havethey-been? TV stars make appearances, including Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers), Paul Reiser (Mad About You) and Damon

South

Rachel Buurma

Street seems to be a pretty
big deal for Swatties. We rarely
hear of them talking about any
other part of Philadelphia. Swatties are
raised on South Street: the CA groups
visit South Street at the beginning of
Orientation, the more out-there firstyears go there to get pierced after two
rebellious months at college, and hordes
of Swatties go there every weekend to
shop. This is not to say that we know
better than you guys: we're the same
way, we have never ventured out of
South Street, even though we visit Philly
pretty often.
Now, everyone gets a feel for the
stores on South Street after a visit or
two (Condom Kingdom for gag gifts,
Trash and Vaudeville for trendy
clothes), but the restaurants are harder.
After all, it doesn't cost you money to
go in and look around a store: it does
cost you money to figure out which
restaurants on South Street are worth it,
and which aren't.
One place we've found that's pretty
good is Mirchi. It's a small Indian and
Mexican restaurant down near the end
of the shopping area ofSouth Street (on
the same block as Hats in the Belfry—where Brantley used to work...except
in Virginia...but that's another story).
The food is great. Not much else can
be said about it. They have a widerange
of traditional Indian and Middle Eastern fare: curries, tandoori specialties,
and kabobs. Rachel recommends the

Saagwala, a meat dish with spinach and
herbs. Brantley usually goes for the
Vindaloo, a tangy meat dish with potatoes. Do you wonder why we said "meat
dish"?Because you can choose beef or
lamb. Don't worry though, they also
have no less than sixteen vegetarian
dishes. And, for extra variation, they
have a decent selection of Mexican
food, which we haven't tried.
Mirchi has its downsides. It's a small
restaurant, and it's family-run, so the
atmosphere is plain and not very elegant. The serviceranges between good
and slightly lacking. The prices, however, are normal restaurant prices: an
entree is from $7 to $l2 on the average,
a dinnerfor two costs around $3O. What
you're paying for is the food, and that's
the main reason to go there.
When you order a standard dish,
they'll ask you how spicy you want it,
on a scale of 1 to 10. Our advice to you
is: FOR GOD'S SAKE, SAY SEVEN!
Any lower, and you're missing a great
experience (although the faint-hearted
may want to go for a five), any higher,
and you're going to kill yourself. We
know you're intense, but don't walk in
and order a ten. Brantley tried it once.
The injuries are still healing.

Katie

Menzer
Breaks
a Taboo:

Saturday
The

Afternoon Nap

It

is a conundrum that has confounded Swatties throughout the
ages: to nap after Saturday brunch
or not to nap after Saturday brunch.
Yes, that is the question.
You know what I'm talking about:
that overwhelming desire, after your
stomach has been unwittingly pacified by synthetic cheese blintzes and
Eggoesque waffles, to crawl back
onto a granite mattress and sleep
until dinner. Heck, you managed to
get up by 12:30 on a Saturday morning, you deserve a little nap.
Of course, there are those of you
out there who don't believe in a wee
snooze after Saturday brunch. Some
of you, I've been told, don't even
believe in napping at all. Well, if
that's what you believe, you must be
some kind of freak and I'm not talking to you anyway. But to all those
other people who believe in napping
as an institution but simply don't
believe in doing it after Saturday
brunch, please hear me out.
Saturday, as we all know, is the
day of rest. But, as you probably
didn't know, it is also the day ofrust.
You see, if you rearrange the letters
of "Saturday," you get "a rust day."
And to "get rusty," as we all know, is
to degenerate from lack of use or
inactivity. Obviously, "Saturday" is
a subliminal message from the Ancients telling you to rust, or nap, as
we call it today.
And why do you think that there
are no classes, labs or meetings
planned for Saturday? It's not because The Man expects you to be
working during this uncommitted
time. Heck, he expects you to be
working from 8 a.m. till 2 a.m. Sunday through Friday when classes and
labs and meetings are scheduled.It is
only because The Man doesn't plan
anything on Saturday afternoon that
you know The Man doesn't want you
hitting thebooks; he wants you sleeping. And you should listen to The
Man because someday you will be
The Man, or at least the podiatrist of
The Man, and you will want the minions to listen to you, too.
You can't even waste your time
and consciousness watching television on Saturday afternoon. All the
good cartoons Animaniacs, Pinky
and theBrain, Superman,Spiderman,
X-Men, MegaMan, Casper, SchoolhouseRock, The Mask, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Garfield and
Friends, Timon andPumbaa, Looney
Tunes, King Arthur and the Knights
ofJustice, Gargoyles, Woody Woodpecker, Double Dragon, and Eagle
Riders—areoverbyoneo'clock. The
only thing left to watch is the Frugal
Gourmet and the PGA Tour, and you
can watch both of those while you
are unconscious anyway.
McCabe Library closes at 6 p.m.
on Saturday. This seems to be a very
peculiar time to close a library,
doesn't it? The library doesn't close
at 6 p.m. on any other day. Seems
pretty suspicious, huh?
Well, if you think about it, the
library closes about an hour after you
should be getting up from that Saturday afternoon nap. That gives you
just enough time to traipse over to
McCabe, pick upyour reserve binder
readings and hit Sharpies before the
six o'clock rush. Pretty convenient,
isn't it?
Besides, it is a proven fact that if
you suffer from enough sleep deprivation, you will go insane. And at
Swarthmore, where that fine line between genius and insanity has been
decorously obscured with tulips and
monkey grass, you've got to take
care of yourself.
My final argumentum pro sleepo
post eatum involves that illustrious
eating establishmentwe lovingly call
Sharpies. Saturday brunch is a notoriously foul meal at Sharpies. There
are two reasons for this. One, they
want you to think that the food on
Saturday morning is so loathsome
that you won't even bother to get up
for it. They want you to sleep from
Friday night straight on into Saturday night. Two, if you foil their
plans and goto Saturday brunch anyway, they want you to feel so sickly
afterwards that you have to lie down.
If you don't believe me, just try those
sausage patties.

Preseason Report

Min Lee

The men's tennis spring season
will be under way in two weeks, with
an opener against Georgetown University on March 1 in Washington
D.C.
Players have been practicing daily
since the first day of Spring semester,
and the season got off to an unofficial
start last week with a match against
the Division I team from Columbia
University. The team will also be
traveling to California for a series of
matches against local schools over
Spring break.
New additions to this year's roster
include John Leary 'OO, Jon
Temin'oo, and Sasha Sheehan 'OO.
John Derderian '97 and Roger
Werner'9 8 will be at the top two
singles spots.
In the scrimmage against Columbia, the Garnet were defeated 7-0 in a
tough matchup. "Columbia is one of
the best teams in the northeast," said
Coach Mike Mullan "They beat
Harvard in the fall, and Harvard is
ranked in the top 12 of Division I."
There were several close sets, with
Steve Richards in the #3 spot losing
7-5 while #6 John Leary also lost a
tight match to his opponent. Overall,
however, Columbia proved too
strong.
Swarthmore has scored wins over
strong.
Swarthmore has scored wins over
Columbia in the past, and the recent
loss was by no means a complete
walkover for the Division I team.
"No one was blown away, which is a
good sign against such a strong team,"
said Greg Emkey 'OO.
The reason the team schedules
matches against stronger opponents
before the start ofthe season is to give
the team plenty of match play under
its belt once the season begins.
Georgetown, a Division I team,
will be a test for Swarthmore, but
players are optimistic about theirprospects against the Hoyas. "We've had
a good record against them in the

past," said Sheehan.

Princeton are also scheduled for later

After the season opener against
Georgetown, the team will play several other teams before the California
trip. There they will be play UC SantaCruz, UC Berkeley, Pomona College, Claremont College and Foothill
College.
In late March the team will be
traveling to Atlanta, Georgia to play
the top Division 111 teams in the nation. The team also hopes to avenge
losses to Amherst—one of the team's
and Williams last
major rivals
year. Matchups against UPcnn and

in the season.
The main goal of the season, according to Mullan, is to make the
NCAA Division 111 tournament, held
from May 17-22 in Lexington, VA.
"I would very much like to win
another national championship for
Swarthmore, and I think that nearly
everyone on the team would place
that as a top priority," said Sheehan.
Swarthmore last won the national
championship in 1990. The team
made nationals last yearbut was eliminated in the round of sixteen.

Since fifth year head coach Karen
Borbee has been at the helm of the
women's lacrosse team, the Garnet
has been in contention for the league
title, and this year should be no different. While most teams would suffer a rebuilding season after losing
seven starters, the Garnet continues
to look strong and once again set their
sights on postseason action.
While depth may be a problem this
year, since there are just 18 players
on the varsity squad, the team returns
a core of five solid seniors.
Tri-captains Lia Ernst '97, Kristin
Osborne '97, and Kelly Wilcox '97
and fellow
seniors Chu'ya
Hornberger and Samantha Peltz provide great leadership and experience.
Ernst, who is rebounding from a
knee injury, Osborne, and Hornberger

will carry the scoring load. Peltz and
Wilcox key a strong defensive unit,
and will have to protect whoever
arises as the starting goalie.
Competing at the goalie position
are Jaclyn Coutts '99, Jane Kendall
'OO and Cay ley Pendergrass '97.
Coach Borbee has been impressed
with the play of all three and will be
comfortable with any of them in net.
Defense will continue to be a key
for the Garnet, and they will need
several defenders to step up and fill in
for the losses of player personnel. An
impressive group is ready to fill the
role. They include Anne Holland '99,
Danielle Thomas '99, Lynne Steuerle
'99, and Sarah Singleton '99.
{Catherine Wu '9B brings quickness and two years of varsity experience to the defensive position. Laura
Starita '97, who returns after spending a year abroad, carries a reputation

as being a physical defender.
If last year was any indication,
Holly Baker '99 will be an offensive
force for the Garnet. Baker, who is
finishing up basketball season, is a
tremendous athlete with a knack of
scoring goals in big games.
As Ernst continues to recuperate,
goal scoring help will come from
Betsy Rosenbaum '9B. To counter
the lack ofdepth, the team will change
its offense from an up-tempo game to
a slower one relying on ball movement and selective shots.
Players have been impressed with
the way Julie Finnegan 'OO and Alicia Googins 'OO have been playing.
Finegan, who never played the sport
before, is picking up the game quickly.
Googins has a solid shot and will be
counted on as a finisher. Both will
need to make an immediate impact.

Jennifer Z. Chen

Wrestling wrapped up its regular season Saturday
at the Centennial Conference Championship, where

Swarthmore finished sixth overall. Before thechampionship, the Garnet competed in a quad-meet at
Ursinus where its sole win was against Haverford
College.
In that quad-meet, against Washington & Lee,
Adrian Wilson '99 won his bout against Adam
Branson in the 134 pounds category. Pete Balvanz
'9B defeated John Grumbine in the 150 weightclass. In the 190 weight-class, Sean Lewis 'OO conquered his opponent Marshall Sutton with 2:07 to
go. Paul Willenberg 'OO in the heavy weight division
surpassed his competitor John Sensing. Overall,
Swarthmore lost to Washington & Lee 16-28.
Against the host team, Ursinus, the Garnet did not
fare well. The overall score was 6-46. Only Balvanz
and Wilson won their bouts.
In the meet against the Green Terror of Western
Maryland, the Garnet failed to register a single win
with the overall score of 0-49.
The only Garnet win of the day came against archnemesis Haverford College, which forfeited all but
one of their bouts. Jesse Bean 'OO lost to the Ford's
Geoff Silver in the 158 pounds division.
The Garnet finished sixth overall out of a field of
seven teams in the Centennial Conference Championship. Notably, Balvanz finished third overall in
the 150 lbs. category, and Lewis ended fourth in the
190 division. The Garnet squad hopes to perform
better in this weekend's NCAA Division 111 King's

Regional Qualifier.

Three Losses for Women's B-Ball
By

Garnet Falters

Jean Quinn

The Garnet dropped three tough
contests this week. Swarthmore fell
to conference leaders Ursinus and
Muhlenberg and to Eastern. The Garnet, 7-15 overall and 4-9 in conference action, have just one game left
on their schedule.
The Garnet lost to Ursinus 69-44.
"Ursinus is a strong team. They play
well together, and they have a wellrounded squad. The biggest difference between Ursinus and Swarthmore is self-confidence. Somewhere
along the way, our team forgot what
it feels like to play fearless basketball. We need to take back our confidence and start to play like a team,"
said Coach Adrienne Shibles.
Swarthmore came out flat in the
first half and could not keep the game
within reach. The Bears led by 25 at
the break.
One strength that manifested itself
in the Ursinus gamewas the women's
half-court press, which they threw at
the Bears in the second half.
Coach Shibles commended the
team: "The women did a great job of
intimidating one of the top teams in
the conference with the press."
Ursinus looked completely rattled
and repeatedly turned the ball over.
Swarthmore actually played Ursinus
evenly the second half, with both
teams scoring 29 points.
Pia Houseal '97 led the Garnet
with 13 points and nine rebounds.
Teammate Jean Quinn' 99 also scored
13. Holly Baker '99 hit three shots
from behind the arc to score nine
points, and Michelle Walsh '9B tossed
in eight points.
Against Muhlenberg, the Garnet
did not fare well. Although they
played better than they had against
Ursinus, shots just wouldn'tfall. The
Garnet shot a miserable 15% from
the floor in the first half, yet only
trailed the Mules by nine at the half.

Frustrating losses hinder the Garnet's bid to
clinch playoff berth.

"We didn't deserve to win. We
were up 9-0 and trailed by 17 at half.
It was the worst we shot from threepoint distance all year, and it was in a
money game," said Coach Lee
Wimberly of Swarthmore's 76-61
loss to Muhlenberg on Wednesday.
If the Garnet had won, they would
have clinched the final playoff berth
in the East Division. However, now
Muhlenberg hasmoved into a tie with
Swarthmore for the final playoff spot
with one game remaining in the season.
On Saturday, the playoff picture

could be decided. Muhlenberg faces

Michelle Walsh '9B rises above her Eastern defender in
yesterday's controversial loss (69-60).
The Garnet defense looked especially good, and the team stayed
within striking distance for a while.
In the end, Swarthmore was unable to
match the Mules bucket for bucket,
and lost the game 61-35.
Lisl Cochran-Bond '97 scored a
game-high 18 points. Houseal
grabbed nine boards, andWalsh added
seven. Walsh, among the conference
leaders in steals, also robbed the
Mules four times during the game.
Last night's game against Eastern
was senior night. Houseal and
Cochran-Bond were honoredfor their
many achievementsand contributions

to the basketball program.

Unfortunately, the Garnet could not
pull out a victory, losing 69-60. The
team was frustrated by the referees.
To them, it seemed that every player
from Eastern could draw a charge,
and no one wearing maroon could.
Swarthmore came out strong in the
first half and enjoyed a small lead at
the half but was unable to maintain
their composure over the final 20
minutes.
The team wraps up its season Saturday at 6:00 p.m. at Haverford, where
they hope to avenge a loss earlier this
season.

Haverford. If either team wins and
the other loses, then the winner goes
to the playoffs.
However, if both teams lose or
both teams win on Saturday, they
will face each other in a deciding tiebreaker game on Monday. By virtue
of a better record against East Division opponents, Muhlenberg will host
the game.
The Garnetplayed poorly against a
team they had soundly defeated 6855 less than a month ago. It was the
team's worst shooting performance
(32.2%) of the season, and the defense did not play with its usual intensity. The Mules connected on half
of their shot attempts.
Meanwhile, only two starters had
decent shooting nights. Tim Schofield
'99 hit on four ofhis nine attempts to
total nine points.
Aaron Bond '97 continued his
strong finish to the season. He has
averaged 14 points, 11.5 rebounds,
and 2.3 blocks in the team's last six

points and added nine rebounds.
"[Bond] did a good job and held
their leading scorer to zero points.
We were totally dominant on the inside but couldn't hit anything from
the outside," said Coach Wimberly.
The loss to Muhlenberg came just
days after Swarthmore pulled off an
emotional and heart-stopping 64-63
win over Dickinson. Swarthmore has
defeated both West Division playoff
teams, Johns Hopkins and Dickinson.
The Garnet defeated the Red Devils despite the fact that their opponents hit 53% of their shot attempts.

shooter going into the game, sunk

give the Garnet a 62-61 lead.

Chester. He pulled off a three-game upset against one of the
favorites to win. Unfortunately, Wachter dropped his match in
the finals against a UPenn player, 11-3, 11-4.

Centennial Conference (CC) Championships.
On February 21, 22 and 23, the
meet will be held at Franklin and
Marshall College in Lancaster, PA.
The Championships host eight CC
teams including Bryn Mawr,
Dickinson, F&M, Gettysburg, Swarthmore, Ursinus, Washington, and
Western Maryland.
Gettysburg's men's and women's
teams are looking for their fourth
consecutive CC Championship, but
this year the Garnet is not going to let
that happen withoutputting up a fight.
The Garnet has trained all season
long in preparation for this one meet.
In the swimming world the term
"Shave and Taper" is used to describe the meet that a team will pre-

pare for. Most of the men's team's
hair has been colored, and the
women' s team has been growing their
leg hairall season. This is all to greatly
enhance the feeling of the shave that
comes along with taper.
Taper is the decrease in practice
work load which gives members of
the team an excess amount of energy
levels, i.e. bouncing off walls.
Swarthmore's Swimmers are
ranked high going into the meet. A
Psyche Sheet which list the events
and times of all the swimmers in the
CC was recently sent to all the teams.
In almost every event a Garnet swimmer is ranked in the top three.
Molly Marino '9B and Claire
Arbour 'OO are ranked well in their
events, and, on the men's side, Mark
Friedburg '9B, Andy Robbins '9B,
and Brandon Walsh 'OO are placed
well in the meet. Everyone is well
prepared and ready to swim fast.
