Hanna King, one of George Lakey's students assisting the creation of the Global
Nonviolent Action Database, is one of several students who presented the project to the
campus community on Wednesday.

BY ELI SIEGEL

esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

Professor George Lakey and students in his research seminar on
Nonviolent Strategy and Struggle
recently announced the creation of the
Global Nonviolent Action Database
Project, an online catalog that contains detailed accounts of over 400
cases of nonviolent campaigns for
human rights, economic justice, environmental justice, race and religion. It
includes informationfrom roughly 150
countries on six continents with its
oldest case being from the fifth century B.C.E. Each case study contains a
segmented narrative of the campaign

that details the tactics used by the
activists and assesses whether or not
they were successful.
The first of its kind, the database
can open doors for contemporary
activists to see what techniques work
and which do not, according to Lakey.
"As a young activist I would have
loved to have a database like this,"
Lakey said. "It's a place to bring
together the ingredients [for social
change]."
Lakey believes the database will
allow scholars to look for patterns
over time in order to enhance and
develop the most effective nonviolent
action techniques. For example, scholars often break up nonviolent action

iyiarch^4,^Qll

techniques into ones of social change,
which challenge old rules, and ones of
social defense, which seek to keep past
traditions. With this database scholars will now have enough concrete
data to see which one of these two
techniques is most successful. This
will in turn allow current activists to
see if it would be better to frame their
action as social defense or social
change.
In addition, the database reveals
waves of nonviolent campaigns
throughout history that lead to significant results. For example, it shows
the wave of nonviolent action that
took place in Eastern Europe in 1989
just before the downfall of the Soviet
Union. A similar wave of action can
been seen in Southeastern Europe that
lead to the overthrow of Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000.
Students in Professor Lakey's seminar have been powering the project.
Each student writes 12 cases per
semester for the database, developing
their research methods and learning
about sociological concepts. The seminar was first offered in the fall of 2009
and has been offered every semester
due to continued student interest.
Students from Georgetown University
and
students
volunteers
at
Swarthmore have also written cases
for the database.
"[The database] was something I
was really interested in," Max
Rennebohm 'l3 said, who is a psychology and peace and conflict studies
double major. "It will be useful to
future activists."
Lakey believes that creating the
database can change the way students
look at the world and understand complex issues.
"When Egypt erupted with mass
nonviolent direct action, the media
largely portrayed it as spontaneous. A
number of my students [were surprised by this], because they could tell
that there had been movement organizing and strategic planning prior to
the mass action," Lakey said.
"My students turned out to be right.
Their course work gave them more
insight than some journalists on the
scene," Lakey added.
This in turn allows students to feel
that their efforts really can make a difference.
"Working on the database project is
the most empowering single thing I
did during my college years. It contradicted my cynicism about whether
change is really possible and showed
me that people like myself can organize campaigns that matter," Shandra
Bernath-Plaisted 'O9 said.
The experience of creating the database has had a profound impact on
Lakey's students.
"As someone who is socially
engaged," said Will Lawrence 'l3, "the
[project] transformed the way I view
history, activism and power."
Lakey and his students plan to
launch the database publicly this summer. When launched the database will
have over 500 cases from almost every
country.

Plans to construct
a gazebo in limbo

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY AARON KRAMER
akramer2@swarthmore.edu

Allegra Pocinki Phoenix Staff

On Wednesday, Jeff Hiller of Jobßound hosted a professional development workshop to
provide students with the tools to achieve career-related success.

For the past seven weeks, Student
Council has been the discussing the
possibility of constructing a gazebo on
campus. The list of potential uses is
quite varied.
"It's going to be a place to rest, a
place to socialize, a place where classes and seminars could be taught," said
StuCo President Simon Zhu 'IL "I
think that there's also an aesthetic element to it, there's a communalelement
to it; it could be a place for productions
and musical performances."
According to Zhu, similar spaces
are limited on campus given that there
is no student center. However, Student
Council is not investing a lot of time in
the project at the moment because it's
in its preliminary stages. "We're very
much still exploring our options," Zhu
said.
At this point, the gazebo proposal is
in conceptual stages; no formal proposals have been drafted. Questions yet to
be addressed include the final cost of

construction, maintenance mechanisms and costs, materials, location
and architecture. "Those questions
will have to be vetted in the community to see what makes sense," said
Claire Sawyers, Director of the Scott
Arboretum. "We have a lot of people
who have strong opinions about what

architecture works here and what
doesn't work here, [and] what materials are appropriate."
Paul LaFreniere 13, who has expe-

rience working in architecture, has
mixed feelings. "One of the things I
really like about the aesthetics of the
campus is how we have these open,
unencumbered green spaces buttressed by trees," LaFreniere said.
"I've never heard anyone express a
burning desire for a gazebo, especially
considering the financial constraints
of the school... Hopefully, it will function as a locus that draws and arranges
people around it because if it doesn't, it
will just become a public eyesore."
"There is obviously a cost issue,"
Zhu said. "We would have to secure
funding, but we think this could add
value to the campus. There are a lot of
potential benefits, but we don't what
kind of price tag we're looking at and
whether we would have funding for it.
There will of be a question of opportunity cost, what else we could do with
the money," he said.
LaFreniere also believes that the
conceptual phases of the project
should be opened to the student population so that interested parties could
submit ideas. "If this is going to work,
a lot of care and thought and public
input has to go into determining how
[the gazebo] is going to be used."
Student Council discussed a prefabricated design, which would be significantly cheaper than a custom one. The
design had a price tag of about $9,000
and is about 15 feet across. Stuart
Hain, Vice President of Facilities and
Services, is concerned that the design
does not live up to building standards
of the college.
"I'm concerned about the quality of
this structure," Hain said, "[the gazebo] should be of a higher quality of
materials than a residential gazebo
should be in order to sustain much

heavier use." No custom designs have
been submitted, but they generally
range between ten and fifty thousand
dollars.
For projects like this, sources of
funding are usually varied. The
College has a facilities capital budget,
but the gazebo proposal will likely face
strong headwinds as the college is
tightening its belt in response to the
recent recession. Funding for capital
projects has been and will remain at a
reduced level: $3.1 million for facilities
projects were approved for the 2011-12
academic year, while in the 2008-09
year the figure was $lO.B million.
The gazebo proposal may in fact be

competing for funds with a similar
proposal for a student activities plaza

between the fraternities and the

Faulkner Tennis Courts.

"The capital budget is stretched to
exhaustion," said Stuart Hain.
According to Hain, Swarthmore's capital facilities budget doesn't normally

fund projects like the gazebo and that
discretionary use of the budget will be
low so as to protect the college's infrastructure.

approach
StuCo
could
the
Arboretum as well. Claire Sawyers,
Director of the Scott Arboretum, wants
to consult with StuCo on the project,
but does not believe that the
Arboretum can help fund the construction of a gazebo. The Arboretum's
funds have been depleted, in part due
to the construction of the $3.8 million
Wister Center, a space for public horticultural education and displays as well
as a greenhouse.
"There's not one recipe to go about
making this happen," Sawyers said,
"this is part of the way Swarthmore
works. You build consensus, you build
momentum, and then you work on
funding."

According

to

Sawyers,

Student Council could solicit the
Alumni Association for a portion of
the funds, as a Gazebo could serve
alumni weekend functions. Projects
like this can also take the form of senior class gifts.
Student Council has been speaking
with the Engineering Department
about the project. The Department's
sponsorship appears unlikely as it has
little funds and does not view the construction of a gazebo as educational.
Vandalism is another concern.
According to Sawyer, unless the gazebo is in a very public location, it may
be a target for defacement. Where the
gazebo might be built will depend on
the size of the gazebo and the input of
Facilities and Services and the
Arboretum, but one proposed location
is near the Rose Garden, between
Trotter and McCabe Library.
The consensus seems to be that the
idea of building a gazebo on campus is
a good one. "I think creating spaces
where people can be comfortable and
slow down in a place like Swarthmore
is a good idea," Hain said. But financial constraints and other practical
concerns will likely postpone the project until the College is more solvent.
To complete projects like this in
Swarthmore, one must navigate a
labyrinth of administrative and
departmental constraints. "Its like a
jungle out there," said LaFreniere,
"maybe one day it'll have a gazebo in
it."

Boakye, who

Model Solar Car Project up and running again
BY PATRICK AMMERMAN

pammerml@swarthmore.edu

The Model Solar Car Project, an outreach initiative for students who are enrolled in Chester's public school system, is entering its 16th year of existence. Swarthmore engineering professor Nelson
Macken heads and runs the project, which invites
students in Chester to build their own solar powered model car, working one hour a week for four to
five weeks during Chester's after school program.
Every spring, four or five Swarthmore students
volunteer with the project to help make the experience as positive and beneficial to the Chester students as possible.
"The whole thrust of this is to try to get the students interested in science and technology,"
Macken said. He has been working with
Swarthmore students to offer this opportunity for
children in Chester since the project's inception. A
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology lead a similar program in his own community, which inspired Macken to create his own
program for Chester's schools.
In the beginning of Macken's program, the cars
were built so that the students could enter a national contest known as "Junior Solar Sprint," in which
seventh and eighth grade students race their cars
against one another's.
But, there were a few logistical issues that made
it difficultfor students to attend and compete in the
contest. Finding transportation for the students to
go to downtown Philadelphia to participate was
challenging.
Also, the contest is in June every year and many
of the Swarthmore volunteers have left campus
before the event. "For many years now
we
haven't been a part of the contest, but we do our
own thing and have a contest between the kids who
make the solar cars," Macken said.
Swarthmore students who volunteer with the

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION Hi

Students across the state fight proposed cuts
BY MICHAEL MACAGNONE
pittnews.com, Mar. 20, 2011

Three weeks ago, Pitt senior Nick Brink didn't picture
himself becoming the leader of a state-wide student organization.
The neuroscience major is now the acting president of
the Coalition of Pennsylvania Students, an organization
founded after Gov. Tom Corbett proposed halving state
spending on Pitt and other Pennsylvania universities in
his budget address two weeks ago.
Brink and the 11 members of the group's board
which is comprised of students throughout the state —are
trying to bridge a gap between various universities in the
two state-supported systems: the four state-related universities and the 14 universities in the Pennsylvania State
System of Higher Education.
"There was not one organization that wanted to coordinate with all schools," he said. "We've worked nonstop
over spring break to get all of the organization started."
He created a Facebook event hours after Corbett's
budget address two weeks ago, "GOV CORBETT 50%
Appropriation Reduction for Higher Education- UNACCEPTABLE" that now has more than 22,000 attendees.
The cuts, part of Gov. Tom Corbett's first budget,
amount to almost $9OO million in education spending and
would reduce Pitt's $lB5 million appropriation by more
than half, to $80.2 million. State legislators will hold hearings on the budget throughout April before setting a date
to vote on it.
Accounting for inflation, the appropriation
which
accounted for nine percent of Pitt's budget this year
would be the smallest Pitt has received since becoming
state-related in the 19605.

Pitt will also lose more than $lO million in federal
funds this coming year. Its total budget is more than SL9
billion.
Corbett called his $27.3 billion, UOO-page proposal a
"reality-based budget." It includes no tax increases
in
line with his campaign promises
and cuts state spending to 2008 levels.
The initial outcry over the Internet among students
has turned into organized activism from both long-established and more recently formed student organizations
across the state.
Graduate and Professional Student Assembly
President Nila Devanath helped Brink organize on
Facebook and launch the Coalition of Pennsylvania
Students' website. Brink has also worked to promote
which by
GPSA's online petition against the cuts
Friday had more than 4,000 signatures from students at
more than two dozen universities across the state.
Devanath also emphasized the importance of Pitt Day
in Harrisburg on April 5. Student Government Board will
bus students to the capitol building for a day of lobbying
legislators in person.
"We want to fill as many buses as we can," she said.
"When you are talking to that legislator or that staffer
face-to-face, it's hard to be ignored by them."
Other student leaders have focused most of their advocacy on their campuses, or coordinated through the
Pennsylvania Association of State-Related Students, an
organization formed last semester to support public funding for Pitt, Penn State University, Temple University and
Lincoln University.
"There's no need to re-invent the wheel here," said
Christian Ragland, the president of Penn State's
University Park Undergraduate Association, referring to

the new coalition.
"I admire [Brink's] efforts and I hope to continue to
help him in the future," he said. "But we need to get
behind the organizations that are already established."
The efforts of the state's most populous campus with
more than 40,000 students have focused on getting stories out to legislators. In the last week, Penn State has
gathered video stories from students on its campus, and
Ragland said UPUA wants to organize a phone bank to
reach out to legislators in the next few weeks.
The phone bank is similar to a letter writing campaign
on Pitt's campus sponsored by SGB and GPSA that kicks
off tomorrow. Devanath said that Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg is scheduled to speak at 6 p.m. to start the
campaign, which runs through Wednesday.
The two groups will also coordinate district lobby visits and calling days.
But SGB President Molly Stieber said the biggest event
will be a rally on March 30. Although details about the
location have yet to be finalized, Stieber said she was "in
talks" with city administration to possibly shut down
Bigelow Boulevard and hold the rally there.
Timed less than a week before Pitt's Day in
Harrisburg, the rally would not be an SGB event. Stieber
said she wanted it to be "student-driven, student-led."
Pitt students will go to Harrisburg the same day as
Penn State's students, although Ragland said that the two
schools did not coordinate the event. He thinks that reaching out to legislators
especially this year
will be the
best way for students to enact change.
"Students didn't really understand the importance of
days like that until this year," he said. "I think that the
protest, the activism, plays a definedrole in this process*
but it is up to the legislators to vote."

Roose to discuss his experience at "Bible boot camp"
BY HENRY KIETZMAN
hkietzml@swarthmore.edu

Liberty
Established
in
1971,
University was named "Bible Boot
Camp" by its founder, the late Reverend
Jerry Falwell. Falwell designed the academic institution to provide a small liberal arts education without the tempta-

tions of a traditional liberal arts school
to train "champions for Christ," as
stated on the school's website.
Now, 40 years later, Liberty is the
largest private university in Virginia,
with 60 programs of study, 12,000 students enrolled on campus and nearly
53,000 students enrolled online. Kevin
Roose, a graduate of Brown University,
will describe his own experience "going
abroad" to this exotic world of evangelical Christianity this Friday in the
Scheuer Room at 2:30 p.m.
Jesse Dashefsky 'l3 wanted to bring
Roose to campus after reading a review
of Roose's memoir, "The Unlikely
Disciple." "It struck me as a genuinely

and
Dashefsky said. He believed that
Roose's political and cultural questions
were quite relevant to Swarthmore, and
also admired Roose's unique approach
to exploring such questions.
Last summer, Dashefsky e-mailed
Roose a question he had concerning the
book and, in addition, asked if the
author would like to visit campus.
"[Roose] was really enthusiastic about
the idea, and six months of planning
later, here we are," Dashefsky said.
Joyce Tompkins, the Protestant
adviser on campus, helped Dashefsky
in organizing the event, along with
Tompkin's interfaith interns, Sydni
Adler 'l3 and Ashley Vogel 'l3, the
Religion department and the Sociology
and Anthropolgy Department. "[Jesse]
worked very hard to bring together different groups and funding to accomplish his goal of bringing Roose here to
Swarthmore," Tompkins said.
Gwynn Kessler, professor of religion
studies, is currently teaching a firstyear seminar course entitled Spiritual
Journeys

Roose's "The Unlikely Disciple" is studied. Kessler hopes that Friday's lecture

"Religions exist in large part due to
their adherents, and meeting individuals personally, in a way that Roose
draws them in the book, helps make us
aware of the potential problems inherent in more broad sweeping generalizations."
Tompkins admires Roose's experimental and 'hands-on' approach to
learning
about
evangelical
Christianity. "Roose's experience gives
Swatties of all backgrounds, faith or
non-faith, a different way of approach-

Tompkins said. "Rather than condemn

Swarthmore students relate with their
diverse campus, and will hopefully
bridge the gap between these two
worlds.
In addition, he hopes to demonstrate
that Liberty students also compose a
very diverse community.
For example, he explained that his
friends at Liberty held a variety of
views and not all were "planning antiabortion rallies."
Since ending his study abroad period
at Liberty, Roose has developed a
respect and appreciation for the role
that religion plays in the lives of those
he met at Liberty.
"I look at [religion] as something
that when worn correctly can be great
and life-changing and can inspire people in ways that a secular atmosphere
has more trouble with. But I also have
come to understand some of the dangers of a rigid theology that separates
people into inside and out or saved and
unsaved," Roose said.
For this Friday, Roose anticipates
his visit to campus will be an opportunity to share his stories.
"This was the richest, most productive semester of my life and hopefully
it'll inspire some thinking among
Swarthmore student as to how and why
someone might do something as crazy
as this," Roose said.

I'm not going to deny that there is a truly incredible amount of brain-rotting crap hitting the airwaves on a daily basis. However, those who only
focus on "Jersey Shore" and "America's Next Top
Model" are missing the bigger picture; over the
course of the last decade, television has entered a
golden age, with shows like "The Wire," "Lost,"
"Community" and "Fringe" daring to tell original
provocative stories that are too sprawling for film
and too visceral for literature.
This creative awakening is due, in no small part,
to audience fragmentation and niche networks
some pay channels, like HBO and Showtime, and
some basic cable channels like FX and AMC
that
allow writers and showrunners to take risks that
never would have been possible when there were
only four networks and they were all fighting their
hardest to gain the largest audience share.
Of course, there are drawbacks to this kind of
audience fragmentation; when viewers are confronted with so many quality shows, it becomes challenging for a show to do well in the ratings, particularly
when said show airs on one of the major networks.
For example, AMC's recent hit series "The Walking
Dead" drew 6 million viewers for its finale, a recordbreaking number for a cable network, but a middling to bad number for a series on a major network.
This sort of audience fragmentation can lead to
major problems for network shows with a more
niche audience, like FOX's amazing sci-fi series
"Fringe"; last week, "Fringe" pulled in a little less
than 4 million viewers, a really solid number for a
cable drama but one that only increases fans' worries that the series will not be renewed for a fourth
season. (In case you couldn't guess, this discussion
is really an attempt to get everyone to watch
"Fringe." So please watch it, if only because I've

Senior vocalists to showcase talent in recital
BY STEVEN HAZEL

shazell@swarthmore.edu

At 8 p.m. this Saturday, Swarthmore
students and staff will have the opportunity to listen to two vocalists, Ben Starr
'll and Sirkka Natti 11, for their senior
recitals in the Lang Concert Hall.
Sponsored by the department of music
and dance, senior recitals offer music
and dance majors an opportunity to
showcase their interests, either through
selections from a specific artist or a certain group of works that they feel particularly drawn to.
At an early age, both Natti and Starr
were enthralled with music, which
seemed to foreshadow their later passion. "I have been singing since before I
can remember. I love being able to
express myself in such a pure way," Natti
said. Although her musical interest was
obvious to those around her, for Natti,
music as an academic endeavor was far
from apparent. "Coming into Swat, I
wanted to be a political science major,"
Natti said. "But the more I did other
things, the more I realized that music
was something that I wanted to do [in the
real world]. I started taking it seriously."
On the other hand, Starr developed an
interest in instrumental music first. "I
started piano lessons around age six. I've
always loved music, and I have an eclectic musical taste," Starr said. Although
he continued to play the piano, he also
developed a new musical interest as a
vocalist when he arrived on campus.

"When I first came to Swat, I was really
musical, but my primary instrument was
piano," Starr said. "I've since focused a
lot more on singing, and developing my
voice."
Here at Swarthmore, Natti and Starr
followed very different paths for their
love of music. Starr became involved
with Sixteen Feet, the capuses oldest allmale a capella group that was founded in
1981 Starr is the music director of the
group, which performs songs of diverse
genres such as pop, soul and jazz."l have
seen Ben Starr and Sixteen Feet multiple
times at Swat, and I always find [much]
to enjoy at their shows," Danielle
Sullivan 'l4 said. During his time on campus, Starr believes he has matured as an
artist. "I had an intuitive understanding
of harmony when I was a freshman, but I
think my understanding of harmony has
become more sophisticated and nuanced
through my study here," Starr said. In
2009, he performed as the opening act for
the Jazz Group Trio (Blue) when they visited campus to perform.
On the other hand, Natti has participated with the arts in several plays at
Swarthmore, including "Eats Shoots and
Ladders" and "Bodas de Sangre (Blood
Wedding)." Natti believes that her musical education within the Swarthmore
music department have inspired her to
pursue music as a career. "I have learned
so much over the last few years, and
singing has gone from something I did
for fun to something I want to do for a living. Although that is really scary, I think

Swat has prepared me to try to achieve
that goal," Natti said. Her inspiration
comes from
who puts theirheart
on their sleeves and moves mine."
Specifically, she loves German composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach
and Johannes Brahms, and a bit more
modern rock music such as the Beatles.
For Starr, his musical taste is "really
eclectic" and ranges from across many
genres.
For Saturday, Natti selected a song
cycle
a group of songs designed to be
performed in sequence to achieve a unified effect
called "Fiancailles Pour
Rire" by Francis Poulenc, a French composer from the early 20th century. The
collection of songs addresses friends who
are separated by distance. "I picked it
because ithas a wonderful longing quality that I find intriguing," Natti said. Also,
she will perform two arias, including
"Kommt Ein
Schlanker
Bursch
Gegangen" by Carl Maria von Weber,
which Natti describes as "flirty and fun."
Her second aria, "Steal Me Sweet Thief
by Gian Carlo Menotti, depicts a maid
hoping her love will come rescue her
from her ordinary life.
For his selections, Starr chose a different route and choose Robert
Schumann's 0p.39 "Lierderkreis," which
is a song cycle of 12 songs that focus on a
particular musical theme. Also, he will
perform five songs from Erich Wolfgang
Korngold's posthumous "Lieder." As
opposed to Natti's theme of love and longing, Starr's selections are united in their

origin

these songs are adapted from
the work of German poet Joseph
Freiherr von Eichendorff.
Both performers hope that listeners
will be able to experience the emotion
infused in the music. "In an ideal world,
[the audience] will take away the truth
that is in the music, and the love that I
have for it. Music, for me, expresses so
much of what makes the world beautiful," Natti said. "Hopefully something
will touch [the audience]."

the opportunity to literally witness her work's impact.
Regardless of all the rewards of her job, as with any
job, there are a few pitfalls. "One major problem with
being a consultant
is that you are not in control of
work flow," she said. "If they all call up on Wednesday
evening with urgent demands, you are overwhelmed."
While it helps to be flexible and willing to sacrifice
weekends, Stone admits that the job required a great
deal of traveling, which got old very quickly.

'The Owls' portrays lesbians who desire acceptance

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY SERA JEONG
sjeongl@swarthmore.edu

"The Owls," a pathological lesbian thriller, will
screen this Friday as part of the 2011 Queer and Trans
Conference. The annual symposium is held at
Swarthmore College to explore issues pertaining to the
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. This year's theme is Envisioning Queer Futures.
The conference website highlights some of the questions that the symposium will address including, "How
are we going to form relationships? What are our families and kinship structures going to look like?"
According to the conference organizers, one of the primary objectives of the conference is to "move us toward
a better understanding of these questions."
"The Owls" was created by The Parliament Film
Collective, which self-described itself as a "large, queer,
multi-racial community." "The Owls" premiered at the
2011 61st Berlin International Film Festival and has
since been screened at the Seattle International Film
Festival and Torino LGBT Film Festival.
Cheryl Dunye, the director and one of the actors in
the film, will be present at the screening. She attained
her BA from Temple University, where she currently
teaches in the department of film and media arts. She
gained her MFA from Rutgers University's Mason
Gross School of the Arts. Dunye directed "The Owls" in
her signature format of filmmaking, dubbed the
"Dunyementary," by combining narrative with confessional scenes that emulate the style of a documentary.
"It's a mixture of truth and fiction and the way you
want the world to work for you. So many people are
not honest about the truths and fictions of their lives
and how they coexist... That's how it's handled in the
film, using documentary and narrative to make everything real," Dunye said in a press release.
"The Owls" refers to the acronym Older Wiser
Lesbians, addressing the main characters, four middleaged lesbians. Set in Los Angeles, the film revolves
around two disillusioned and dysfunctional lesbian
couples who have yet to conform to the norms of society. The film portrays these women as products of a revolutionary, rebellious lesbian culture of the early '9os,
in contrast to the present, where lesbianism is widely
accepted and the challenges OWLs have faced are largely unappreciated. The two couples are tied by the murder of a younger lesbian woman who was killed at the

house of one of the main characters.
These characters are shown struggling to adapt to
domestic, normalized relationships. For example Lily,
an alcoholic, reminisces about her career as the lead
singer of a '9os lesbianrock band. Lily is in a relationship with another character, MJ,who spends all of her
time on the internet inside the couple's house.
Patricia White, a professor of the program in film
and media studies at Swarthmore College who organized the event, highlighted the farcical nature of the
film. "I think there is a certain amount of mockery of
the optimism of lesbians [of past generations]," she
said. The film suggests that there is confusion in the
OWL community about accepting a younger generation
of naive lesbians who were born into a more accepting
society."ln a way the film [conforms to] the image of the
drunken, homicidal, predatory, failed, marginal lesbians that is the legacy of mainstream movies. But as
gay and lesbian cultures become more mainstream and
marriage and domesticity focused, there is certain nostalgia for the image of the outlaw, abject lesbian. This is
a confusing legacy," White said.
White contrasted the representation of lesbianism in

"The Owls" with "The L-Word," Showtime's television
drama series which ran from 2004 to 2009. "'The Owls'
is a fun counter to the mainstream, airbrushed and a
little bit self-serious 'The L-Word," the biggest and most
visible media text portraying lesbians," she said.
The film reflects a diverse LGBT community.
"[Most] lesbians are portrayed as either really feminine
or really butch. When I read into the plot of this film, I
thought the film gave more than a traditional onedimensional view of lesbians," Paloma Perez 'l4 said.
According to Hillary Yee 'l4, the unusual storyline of
the film may be a fresh change from mainstream
movies. "Its not a commercially-made film so there is
an appeal if students want to watch a lesbian film that
is a change from a Hollywood movie," Yee said.
The film will screen during the conference to showcase the work of Dunye, a Philadelphian, because the
subject matter of the film is relevant to the theme of
this year's symposium. "Any generational concern
about what kind of culture comes next has to look a little bit at the recent past. The theme of Envisioning
Queer Futures has a thematic relationship to the film,"
White said.

From the President: a statement of principles
BY REBECCA CHOPP
rchoppl@swarthmore.edu

In anticipation of a future inn and restaurant
being built as part of the Town Center West project,
the student group Swarthmore Labor Action Project
(SLAP) has asked the College to enter into a “neutrality” agreement with the hotel industry union
UNITE HERE and to endorse a card-check approach
to union organizing. I write to state the position of
the College administration, which
has been shared with the Board of

OP-ED

Managers.

Swarthmore College has long been
committed to providing a safe,
healthy and productive working environment for all
who work here. We believe that our community is at
its best when individuals are supported in their
work; when there is an environment of mutual trust
and a genuine exchange of information, opinion and
perspectives on all issues among all parties; and
when coercion and harassment by any party are
explicitly forbidden. Respect, tolerance, support and
open communication with one another are preeminent values in our community.
As we plan for an inn that will require new
employees, we affirm this statement of principles,
drawn from existing College policies, for all employees working on our campus, including the future
employees at the inn:
I Every employee will work in a safe and healthy
environment.
2. Every employee will be provided wages consistent with the College’s compensation policies.
3. Every employee will have the right to voice his
or her opinion and engage others in free and open
discussion with full, uncensored information relevant to any choice they may need to make in order to
make an informed decision.
4. Every employee will be respected for his or her
right to make uncoerced decisions about joining a
union or not.

5. Every employee will have the right to raise concerns about his or her working conditions and to
have those grievances addressed fully and impartially.

Under the terms of the neutrality agreement that
SLAP and UNITE HERE have proposed, the administration of the College would pre-select for the future
workers of the inn and restaurant a specific union,
UNITE HERE, and would agree that no member of
management would discuss unionization with
employees during the union campaign. Depending
upon the terms of the contract between UNITE HERE
and the College, other stipulations might apply.
Taken literally, "neutrality" in this instance is a
misnomer. While the College would agree to remain
"neutral" and silent during a union campaign, in
effect the College would have already expressed a
preference for a union and a certain union in particular. Such an agreement would afford that union a
monopoly or special status as the employees in the
potential bargaining unit analyze the question of
union representation.
As a practical matter, the union's would be the
only voice on campus during a campaign, which
effectively limits employee access to comprehensive
information, inhibits critical analysis of representations made and interferes with a full discussion of the
issues. This deprives employees of fundamental
rights necessary for informed choice.
Such a neutrality agreement also preempts the
right of future inn employees to initiate their own
union efforts on their own timetable, limits their
ability to request full information about both union
and nonunion workplaces and prohibits their ability
to discuss such issues with managers if they wish to
do so.
Thus, neutrality agreements inhibit, and are
inconsistent with, core College values such as free
speech, self-determination of staff, and choice. We
believe that given our fundamental values and practices, neutrality agreements for the College come at
too high a price, compromising both the values we

treasure and the positive working environment we
work hard to preserve.

SLAP has also indicated that it favors a card-check
approach to union organizing, rather than a private
ballot system. Akin to signing a petition (though
more binding), a card-check system is one in which a
card is signed publicly in front of and/or subject to
disclosure to peers and union officials, indicating a
commitment to a particular union. If the union
obtains signed authorization cards from more than 50
percent of the potential bargaining unit members, the
union may then be established.
We believe in the right of all of our employees to
choose, without coercion, whether or not to be represented by the union of their choice, as articulated in
federal legislation and overseen by the National
Labor Relations Board. But Swarthmore is an educational institution committed to open dialogue and
respect for differences.
Thus we believe an election process is best suited
to our culture, as it better allows for all views to be
aired in an atmosphere of respect, appreciation and
inquiry and then for a decision to be made in private
in the election booth. In the past, members of the
College staff have also voiced their preference for private ballot elections to protect their right to a confidential choice.
For a further statement on neutrality agreements
and card-check versus balloting please see
http: //www. swarthmore. edu/x32227.xm1.
In sum, the College has a deep and abiding commitment to provide a safe and productive workplace.
Our statement of principles will govern our practices

for employees of the inn as well as employees of the
College.

If the future inn workers decide that a union can
best represent their interests, we will support their
right to such representation. But let us give them the
chance to be heard and to make their own, free choice
in an atmosphere that is open, fair, dignified and
respectful of the values we hold in highest regard.

The entertainer did not just visit the
women's prison to collect laughs; she
highlighted the structural injustice of a
punitive system that criminalizes
women who have histories of severe
psychological, physical and sexual
abuse.
From dealing with a mentally and
physically abusive spouse to just not
having enough money to afford a prom
dress, Mo'Nique emphasized that we
are all only one poor decision away
from majorly altering the course of our
lives.
When I learned of the case of Afrika
Owes, a young Harlem teenager who
was charged last month with acting as

THE PHOENIX

a gun courier for her 20-year-old
boyfriend Jaquan Layne and the 137th
street crew, I couldn't help but recall
Mo'Nique's haunting message.
Afrika formerly attended Deerfield
Academy, a prestigious private boarding school in Massachusetts but after
two years at the institution, she moved
back home to enroll at Millennium
High School.
Some are deeming the highly accomplished and very intelligent young
woman an "Ivy League-bound drug

dealer" but the characterization of
Afrika as the "gangsta girl" and as "the
good girl gone bad" is absent much
needed feminist analysis.
Some argue Afrika fell victim to a
"no snitching" code but I don't believe
the extremely bright 17-year-old was
"playing thug," hypnotized by the supposed allure of gangsterism or desperately trying to authenticate her blackness.
While the commodification and misrepresentation of life in America's
ghettos are certainly cause for concern,
there are very particular challenges
black women face in entering institutions where the majority of its students
foundational interactions with women
of color are with caregivers and housekeepers.
Afrika's positioning as a black
woman in the white space of Deerfield
Academy is intrinsic to her story. Her
reality speaks to a truth we are far too
uncomfortable addressing and that is

the devaluation of black female bodies
This is perhaps why this case is so
compelling. We live in a society that
ostracizes black women from mainstream modes of celebration except
when it comes time to put them under
a harsh microscope. The ramifications
of being excluded from prevailing
notions of beauty contribute to a cycle
of invisibility and desexualization.
Afrika's pending future speaks to a
racial and gendered reality that is
underdiscussed. Many might argue
that surely Afrika could have found a
more affable suitor than an alleged
drug dealer but the reality for so many
black women is that the higher they
rise in academic and professional success, the more unlikely it is they will
find a partner at all. One might argue
that such relationships, particularly at
formative ages, are all together unnecessary and certainly not integral to an
understanding of self.
However, heterosexual relationships are the most visible interpersonal representation in American culture
and although these relationships saturate the story lines of our favorite television shows and music, black women
are often not included in these narratives.
Look no further than Amber Riley's
role as Mercedes Jones on "Glee." As
the second season comes to a near conclusion, she is the only character on
the series that does not have any kind
of legitimate romance. While all of the

March 24, 2011

white and even other students of color

relationships at McKinley High School

have been thoroughly explored,
Mercedes remains dateless and proud.
No one is attracted to the dark-skinned,
heavyset, self-proclaimed diva except
when it comes time for her to belt a
gospel tune or chime in with a "Hell to
the No."
Mercedes' damaging characterization is a far cry from the nuances that
embody the isolated realities of black
women in primarily white institutions,
particularly when thinking about
issues of romance.
Even though one might write off
Glee as a profitable adolescent series,
its highly influential message is indicative of the invisibility of young women
like Afrika Owes.
Black women should not be expected
to exhibit a superhuman resiliency
that veils them and others to their existence as women. While it might be
problematic that Afrika sought validation in a supposedly troubled young
man, we live in a society that promotes
these kinds of unbalanced partnerships
with the unspoken assumption that
women will invest more of themselves.
The implications are arguably more
fatal in communities that, despite the
unprecedented
efforts
of
the
Abyssinian Baptist Church, do not
have the social capital and white privilege to erase Afrika's nightmare.

International reflection on nuclear energy needed
HEMI H. GANDHI
thecrimson.harvard.edu, Mar. 22, 2011
Japan's nuclear disaster has sobered
the world. What's more is that in the
age of globalization, Japan's tragedy has
morphed into a global crisis—international markets have tanked and some of
Japan's radiation has spilled into
California and China.
According to the International
Energy Agency, over 31 countries currently operate a total of 440 nuclear
power plants. The number is likely to
exceed 800 by 2025. Therefore, in the
aftermath of the Fukushima plant's
very pubic display of the dangers of
nuclear power, all countries must
reflect on their ambitions for nuclear
power.
As seen from the Japanese example,
a future nuclear disaster in one country
can have an adverse effect on all countries. Facing similar challenges regarding nuclear energy, the international
community must work together to
establish tighter nuclear protocols and
standards.
the
Internationally,
Fukushima plant disaster has provoked

16

sharp criticism of nuclear power as a

viable energy source. But regardless of
criticisms, the reality is that nuclear
power is here to stay.
Many developing countries have no
choice but to continue with their
nuclear plans. China and India alone
have plans to build over 200 plants over
the next 20 years. There simply isn't
enough fossil fuel-based energy or
cheap renewable alternatives to fuel
their energy-hungry economies. In an
effort to uplift hundreds of millions of
their citizens from poverty, their choice
to pursue abundant nuclear power,
despite its risks, may be well justified.
At least in the medium term, developed
countries like the U.S.—with a 20 percent dependency on nuclear power—can't simply shut off existing plants or
completely rule out the establishment of
future plants.
Given the inevitable growth of
nuclear power and the fact that the
futures of all open economies are intertwined, it makes sense for countries to
work together to establish tighter
nuclear standards. The U.S. should seize
this moment to lead a necessary global

effort to ensure the safety of our own
existing plants and the safety and sustainability of new plants in emerging
economies.
To begin this effort, a team of independent, international scientists must
first review existing reactor designs.
Concerns about fundamental design
flaws of the General Electric reactor in
the Fukushima plant have been in existence for several years. There are 90
such reactors in plants around the
globe—an unbiased review of GE and
other vendors' designs is clearly mandated.
Furthermore, new guidelines for
suitability of nuclear sites must be
drawn out to minimize the vulnerability of plants to potential catastrophic
natural disasters. Currently there are
substantial plans for new nuclear power
plants in natural disaster prone countries like Indonesia, which lie on the
Ring of Fire. In light of the Japanese
tragedy, such plans must be critically
reviewed.
Nuclear emergency plans must also
be established for all countries. Japan
has the world's third-largest economy

March 24, 2011

and has highly sophisticated technology. Yet its impromptu efforts to deal
with this crisis appear to be desperate.
It's scary to think about the level of
potential inadequacy with which developing countries like India or Indonesia,
that lack the necessary sophistication,
experience, and infrastructure, would
deal with a similar nuclear crisis. Even
in the U.S., a Hurricane Katrina-type
response to a nuclear accident could be
equally disastrous. Disaster readiness
everywhere must subsequently be
improved.
Since the Chernobyl disaster fell
from the headlines over two decades ago
the world has dangerously assumed
that we have a mastery of nuclear
power. The Japan crisis clearly shows
that we do not.
Given the inevitability ofmany more
nuclear plants to come, the U.S. must
lead an international effort to substantially increase the safety of nuclear
power plants. If the world seriously collaborates on such an effort, Japan's
nuclear crisis will at least have served
the purpose of avoiding future
tragedies.

bracket syndrome, it's that it's perennial and universal.
As stench creeps through your predictions just remember that we're all going through the same thing. Except
that jackass who had Richmond AND Butler in his Sweet
16 and won't stop talking about it even though he's
watched more "Gilmore Girls" than NCAA hoops in his

>^

life, but screw that guy.
Since come March we're all one big messed up bracket
loving family, I'm taking a closer look at what we're going
through:

Stage 1: Optimism

This is the "remember when" phase, where money predictions of years past give you a false sense of hope for
your current prospects. This phase usually lasts about 5
minutes, from the end of Selection Sunday until you actually start picking games. It goes a little something like,
"Remember in 'OB when I totally had Davidson in my Final
Four? Yeah, this is MY year."

Stage 2: The Research Phase
Wasting time in the library phase. Obscure factoid
phase. Don't believe the ESPN hype phase, or for some people, watch Sportscenter for the first time and believe
everything they say phase: Did you know that Pitt is leading the Big East in assists per game with 17.5 and Texas is
fifth in the nation in rebounding with 40.3 per game. That's
why they're both locks for the Sweet 16. This is definitely
my year.
By the way, ESPN has completely ruined the research
phase. If you have ESPN Insider and tried to research
games, you would have seen that no matter where you
click JoeLunardi's pick is plastered at the top of the page.
That's a psychological nightmare. Dealing with "the
experts" is bad enough (Butler over Wisconsin? C'mon
ESPN, Michigan State in the Sweet 16, really Sports
Illustrated?), at least give me some solace with my Insider
subscription.
Stage 3: The Denial Phase
This is the phase where the true basketball fans get
pulled mercilessly back down to Earth when they realize
that their cat could pick tourney games just as well as they
could. Here's when those 8/9 games start to go the wrong
way and "totally unforeseeable events" start happening. It
sounds a little something like this "If it weren't for Matt
Howard's put back, Demonte Harper's three ball, Juan
...

Fernandez's leaner, Kalin Lucas' travel and Kevin
Anderson's floater, I'd be killing this bracket pool.
And did you see Nasir Robinson's foul? (which by the
way was absolutely absurd. Why Jamie Dixon has his
players on the line with no time left is a complete mystery
to me, granted Robinson definitely shouldn't have hacked
Howard, if Dixon has a bit of sense in that situation Pitt
would probably have lasted at least one more round before
losing prematurely like they always d0)... and by the way,
if it weren't for Jacob Pullen eating a bad cheeseburger,
the poor water pressure in Notre Dame's locker room and
Georgetown's itchy uniforms, I'd be killing this bracket
pool.

4: The Despair Phase
In this phase the pretensions of knowledge are almost
completely broken down. This is the reality phase, the
"wow I can't believe my 15 year old niece had VCU in the
Sweet 16" phase. Depending on your personality, it's either
the "screw that guy" phase (which definitely isn't me), or
the "how'd he pick that" phase. Either way, you'll find
Stage

yourself dealing with some serious bracket envy.

Stage 5: The Hope Phase
Time to go to the scenario generator! Okay, so ifButler
beats Wisconsin and Florida and makes it to the final four,
all I need is for UCONN to beat San Diego State then lose
to Duke, for UNC to beat Ohio State and for Kansas to win
the championship. There's still a chance
...

Stage 6: Heartbreak

Dammit.

Stage 7: Humility and the Return to Optimism
This is the relaxing phase. The "I'm out of my bracket
pool but I'm not letting that ruin the championship game
for me" phase. Sometimes it's easy to forget the quality of
basketball on display and get lost in bracketology world,
but the truth is, an upset may be mildly upsetting to your
bracket picks, but imagine what it's like for the athletes
involved, for the seniors especially, who may have seen
their best days pass and for the coaches whose livelihood
may be at stake (sorry Bruce Pearl).

With the Elite 8 games coming up, good luck ignoring
inflated bracket ego guy. I hope your scenario generator
treats you well and that even if you lose, which you almost
definitely will, that you welcome next year as a challenge
to lose by less. I hope those of you who picked Pitt learned
their lesson and for those of you who picked Butler only
because your friend's cousin went there get wiped out in
the next round. A Merry March and a stinky bracket to all!

goal. However, the match ended in disappointment, with a 54 loss. "We're playing for

wants it," Bressman said.
Stephen Youngblood 'l2 partnered Zak

with a win in the No. 6 singles 6-7, 6-1 and 61 in the tie-breaking set.
Despite the loss, the team is feeling confident that they can bounce back, and that

Men's and women's lacrosse lose to Ursinus Bears

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANIEL DUNCAN
dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

Despite high-scoring, strong performances, both the
Swarthmore men's and women's lacrosse teams fell just
short against Ursinus in their Centennial Conference openers. The men fell to 1-5 (0-1 CC) while the women now stand
at 4-2 (0-1 CC).

The men came flying out of the gates, building a 3-0 lead
just seven minutes into the game off goals from Jonathan
Molloy 14, Daniel Kowalyshyn 'l4 and Owen Masters 'l2. By
the end of the first quarter, the Garnet seemed to be in control with a dominating 6-2 lead.
"The first quarter was the best quarter of lacrosse we've
played all season. We were moving the ball well, playing
smart, and getting easy lay-ups," Molloy said. Molloy credits the fast-acting game plan as getting them to a 6-2 lead in
the first quarter. "We had the defense on their heels so we

just kept dodging, throwing fastballs and dodging again
until something opened up. When we executed that, we had
plenty of opportunities which we were able to capitalize

on."

But after trading goals with the Bears in the first minute
of the second quarter, Swarthmore's offense went dormant.
Ursinus was able to fight its way back into the game with
six unanswered goals. The Bears led 9-7 at halftime.
Defense and caution took over in the second half. Aaron
Stein 'll took a nasty shot to the head late in the second
quarter. Ursinus added two more goals before a late Garnet
rally cut the deficit back down to two. The Bears came out
with an 11-9 win.
Molloy, Masters and Max Hubbard 'l2 led the Garnet
with two goals apiece. Richard Brode 'll anchored the
defense with four caused turnovers.

The women also found themselves on the wrong end of a
back-and-forth game with the Bears. In the first half, the
Garnet took the lead, scoring five goals to Ursinus' early
three goals. But after several lead changes in the first half,
the Garnet went into halftime down 7-5.
In the second half, the two teams traded goals before
Ursinus put the Garnet away with a 4-0 run. The Bears left
with a 15-11 win. Annalise Penikis 13 and Corinne Sommi
14 accounted for 10 of the 11 Garnet goals in career-best performances. Penikis put the ball in the net six times, while
Sommi added four more.
In goal, Michelle Ammerman 14 made 14 saves.
"Without those saves we would not have been in that
game," Penikis said of Ammerman in an e-mail.
Sommi saw the game as one of the Garnet's better performances on the season. "Our defense really stepped up,
though we received some tough calls for physical play,"
Sommi said. But Sommi recognized that despite their
strong performance, the team "clearly still [has] a lot of

work to do."
Penikis also agreed that while some aspects of the game
were strong, others were not as much. "On the down side,
we weren't able to come up with some 50/50 balls; Ursinus
beat us in ground balls (and ground balls win games),"

Penikis said.

Last night, the men were scheduled to take on
Muhlenberg, but the game was postponed due to snow, but
the Garnet will take on the Mules this Thursday at 7 p.m.
The women's game against Gwynyd-Mercy was postponed
until April 11 due to the rain. Up next, the women take the
field on Saturday in a Centennial Conference game against
Bryn Mawr. The game is scheduled for a 12 p.m. faceoff at
Clothier Field.

Purkey provides proof for how to win an NCAA trophy

Hannah Purkey
The Purkey Perspective

So you want to win an
NCAA basketball championship.
It
makes
sense: the fame, the fortune, the really big trophy. Well, maybe not the
fame and fortune part,
but definitely the really
big trophy. Plus it's also
the ultimate bragging
rights. You started a
foundation
to
feed
orphaned children in
developing nations during your four years at
college?

Well, I conquered March madness and now have
this really big trophy to show for it. Take that starving children.
Deciding to win is half of the battle, so you are
already well on your way to the champagne shower.
Feel free to pause reading and pat yourself on the
back; you deserve it. What is the other half of the
battle, you ask? Well, I'm told it has something to do
with playing the game of basketball. This may be a
problem, you say, as you have never actually been
on a basketball court. Nonsense! We're Swatties
something as silly as a lack of experience shouldn't
stop us from achieving our life goal, the really big

trophy.
But just in case you haven't quite perfected the
physics equations necessary to master the game of
basketball without ever having played before (those
coefficients of friction are so hard to account for
with so many different playing surfaces), here are
some recently published scientific findings that,
when applied to sports, may just help you in your
pursuit of that trophy.
Be the little engine that could
Do you remember when you were in kindergarten, and you read (or someone read to you) that
story about the annoyingly optimistic train? It was
the one about the engine that overcame seemingly

repeating "I-think-I-can, I-think-I-can." It may have
seemed schmaltzy at the time, but according to a
new article in the Journal of Personality and Social

Psychology, the way you perceive yourself really
does affect your performance.
Participants taking a general knowledge test
either did better or worse depending on whether
they were implicitly exposed to perceptual, semantic or conceptual stimuliassociated with being intelligent (did better) or stupid (did worse).
Researchers concluded from this that perception
has a direct impact on performance. So instead of
actually training in order to do well in sports, you
just need to trick yourself into believing that you
are already good at sports. Or, conversely, you could
try and convince your opponents via subliminal
messaging that they are bad at sports. If all else
fails, the "I-think-I-can" worked for the little engine
that could.

If all else fails, laugh
If, despite your best efforts, these bits of advice
still don't propel your team into the Final Four, then
all you can do is laugh. As it turns out, this might
also function as a last-ditch effort to succeed.
According to a 2006 article in the Journal of
Neuroscience, there is a neurological response to
hearing laughter or a triumphant yell that makes
the listener more likely to laugh as well. So if you
are down and you just don't think you have a chance

Baseball picks up wins against Immaculata, PSU
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

After an opening week that saw a solid
Spring Break and a dominating home opener, the Swarthmore baseball team did not let
up in the second week of competition, going
3-2 to bring its overall record to 9-5. The
Garnet have been on an offensive tear all
season, scoring 10 or more runs in its last
three wins and in seven of 13 games overall,
and hopes are high as the team rolls into
Centennial Conference play.
Following a tough loss to PSU-Abington
last Tuesday, the Garnet rebounded in a big
way, taking a close 10-7 victory against
Immaculata on Friday before crushing PSUBrandywine in a Saturday doubleheader.
The Brandywine twin bill included the
first two home runs of the season, highlighting the team's prolific offensive output.
First baseman Mike Cameron 'l2 garnered a
three-run homer in the first game to lead
the Garnet to a 13-3 victory; in Game 2, right
fielder Tim Kwilos 'l3 catalyzed a 15-9 win
with a grand slam.
Although this week opened with an 8-5
loss to local rival Widener, the Garnet
showed resiliency, coming back from an 8-1
deficit to bring the tying run to the plate in

the ninth.
"We're swinging the bat very well," head
coach Stan Exeter said. "I'd call it a good
week."

Mike Waterhouse 12, last week's
Conference Player of the Week, continued
his offensive domination of non-conference
opponents, going a combined 10-for-17 last
week through Saturday to raise his season
average to .457. He leads the team with a .674
slugging percentage, a .565 on-base percentage and 16 RBIs.
"He's definitely swinging [well]," Exeter

said. "What needs to happen in Conference
play is for the guys around him to keep [hitting well] so he ... continues to get the pitches he needs. He's a big-time college hitter
now."
Behind Waterhouse, Nicko Burnett 'l4
has proven himself as an offensive team
leader through the first two weeks.
Burnett's college debut has been nothing if
not promising, as the primary designated
hitter has recorded a robust .410 batting
average (2nd on the team), .510 on-base percentage (3rd) and .487 slugging percentage
(3rd) through last Saturday.
The transition from high school to college has, apparently, not fazed him. "[lt] has
been for the most part what I expected,"
Burnett said, "but it has been made much
easier by all of my coaches and teammates.
They have all been great about getting me
and the other freshmen ready for the season
and letting us know what we should
expect."

He described his performance at the
plate as "pretty locked in so far," and credits
hitting coach Tim Gunn with "[keeping] it
pretty simple for me, which has just allowed
me to stay aggressive and hit the ball hard."
At the bottom of the lineup, centerfielder
Ben Schneiderman 'll has also provided significant run production. Schneiderman, a
solid career .311 hitter, has gotten his hits at
the right times this season and stands second on the team with 15 RBIs.
"Everyone in the lineup is hitting right
now," he said, "so run production is up, too.
We're all locked in and making it easier on
our pitchers."
Left fielder Rory McTear 'l3 continues to
hit and wreak havoc on the basepaths, stealing four bases in last week's games while
raising his average to an even .400.

Leadoff hitter Rory McTear (top) waits for a pitch in the Garnet's 8-5 loss to Widener on Tuesday from Clothier Field. Designated hitter
Matt Lamb (below) steps to the plate. McTear had four at-bats and Lamb had two.
Cameron remains a potent threat in the
middle of the lineup, hitting .378 with a .556
slugging percentage.
Although the season so far has been
highly successful, the true test lies ahead as
the Conference season begins on Saturday.
Dickinson, 13-3 in non-Conference play, will
be the Garnet's first challenge; the team will
then face Haverford and Gettysburg before
its next non-Conference game.
"We're going to see good pitching and
well-executed games," Exeter said of his
new set of opponents. "I'm confident that
our pitchers can match theirs. We just need

to step up and do it."
Exeter's players are aware of the challenges that face them, but don't expect personal or team approaches to change significantly. According to Schneiderman, the
team is already where it needs to be as far as
mentality is concerned.
"We've been treating every game as if it
were a Conference game, so we're not going
to change our approach," Schneiderman
said. "We're just going to keep putting ourselves in position to win games by pitching
and swinging the bat as well as we have

"We expect to be facing a higher caliber
of team," Burnett said, "but we just need to
stick with our game and play how we know
how to play. We just need to take each game
one at a time, keep doing what we've been
doing, and enter each game expecting to
win."
Dickinson will come to visit on Saturday,

kicking off Conference play at Clothier
Field in a doubleheader. First pitch is set for
12:30 p.m.
