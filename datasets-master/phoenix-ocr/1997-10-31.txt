Quote Korean group criticizes U.S. actions
of the week

By

For Kim Hyongjun, a permanent member of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World's People (KCSWP), the
occasion was a somber one. Coming from
one of the most isolated nations in the
world—which is also currently suffering
from its worst famine in history—he was a
man with a mission.
Although the stated purpose of the trip
might have been to promote friendly ties
between the people of the two countries,
Kim had come to explain his country
perhaps one of the least understood but yet
most widely misunderstood—and to appeal
for help at the same time. One of the members of the delegation, namely Mr. Ri
Yongson, is a researcher at the Institute of
Agricultural Sciences.
The current visit marks the latest in a series ofeducational exchanges between the
two countries initiated by the American
Friends Service Committee (AFSC). Mr.
Kim and his colleagues are the second delegation from North Korea to visit
Swarthmore in the past three years. President Bloom, along with a group of Quaker
educators, had paid a reciprocal visit to
their Korean counterparts in Pyongyang
during the summer of '96. The delegation
was originally scheduled to visit this April,
but had decided to cancel their trip last
minute after the defection of a top official
to South Korea.
Kim addressed Swarthmore students at
a forum held Tuesday afternoon in the
Scheuer Room. In an hour-long speech
characterized by propagandistic references,
Mr. Kim made the case for his country on
issues varying from reunification to regional security.

A case currently being brought
against credit unions in the U.S.
Supreme Court could affect the
future of the college's branch of
the Franklin Mint Federal Credit
Union. Operating from its singleroom office in Kohlberg Hall, the
FMFCU welcomes 2,802 students and employees of
Swarthmore College as its members.
The case, National Credit
Union Administration v. First
National Bank and Trust, concerns a 1982 move by the regulatory National Administration to
allow credit unions to grow and
branch beyond strictly limited
fields of membership. Credit
unions have traditionally differed
from commercial banks by being

On the Budget Committee's
agenda is a recent proposal to increase the present student activities fee of $2OB. A $7 to $9 increase is suggested to account for
inflation and to make up for the
over $ 10,000 decrease in revenue
due to a decrease in the size of
the student body. The fee was not
increased for the 1996-97 school
year, so the committee feels inflationary pressures as they seek
to meet the financial needs of
Swarthmore's many student
groups. Since the student activities fee is the committee's only
source of income, the only option
other than raising the fee is to "cut
group budgets significantly," explained Vincent Jones '9B, Budget Committee Treasurer. Although the committee does not
plan to make serious changes in
the way they distribute funds, a
real effort will be made to start to
become tighter on spending since
the decrease in the student body
this year resulted in the loss of the
cushion of extra funds which the
committee relied on in the past.
Another proposal introduced by
Jonesis the establishment of a stu-

terns" concept used by China to reclaim
Hong Kong as a model.
Although Mr. Kim has emphasized at the
outset that the KCSWP was a non-governmental organization, it was apparent to the
critical listener that he was toeing the government line. "Korea was not divided by
Korean people themselves, but by foreign
forces," emphasized Mr. Kim.

In 1982, the Credit Union Administration chose to allow credit

The total number of minority
students applying to Swarthmore
has seen a steady increase in the
past several years. This year the
college received 978 applications
from students of color, nearly 200
more applications than in 1993.
Although the number ofAfricanAmericans in the applicant pool
has remained relatively constant,
more Asian-Americans and
Latinos are applying. The per-

centage of these minority applicants who are admitted to
Swarthmore has not changed
greatly since 1993; in fact, it decreased by approximately eight
percentage points in 1997. But
Tracey Collins Matthews 'B9, Associate Dean of Admissions and
Recruitment Director for students
of color, says that this drop is misleading because the acceptance
rate for all students declined from

30% to 23%.
Overall, the percentages of mi-

nority students in Swarthmore's
admitted class have experienced
the greatest boost during the past
five years. African-Americans
represented 11.8% of students in
the 1997 admitted group, up from
10.8% in 1996 and 8.7% in 1993.

which would serve as another
source of income. Each year a
portion of each student's activity
fee is allocated to the committee's
capital replacement budget.
Funds from this budget would be
used to create theendowment and
a portion of the interest from the
endowment would be used each
year. Because of the endowment,
thefee would not have to be raised
again in the near future.
This proposal to increase the fee
was presented to the Budget Committee on Sunday, but was held
up because of a dissenting member who opted for an increase in
the fee greater than that which is
necessary to account for inflation.
Josh Kramer 'OO proposed a $2O

Car owners rustled by
sudden rash of thefts
By Kathryn Tong

Early this week, two Honda Accords were stolen
from Parking Lot C. Both cars identical, except in
color, and parked next to the SEPTA station. Connie
Cheung '9B, was the first to report her car stolen to on
Tuesday afternoon. Rachel Brakke reported her car
stolen after midnight on Wednesday.
Cheung last saw her car on Monday at 2:45 p.m. and
the next day at 3:00 p.m., the car was gone. She says
that she locked the doors but regrets not attaching her
club device onto the steering wheel. "I thought that
the school was safe but apparently not," says Cheung.
After receiving the public safety report on Wednesday, Brakke went to Parking Lot C at midnight that
day to find that her car was stolen. Before going to
public safety, Brakke circled the lot with a friend to
make sure that she had not parked the car in another
space and saw a suspicious looking black Honda Accord in the lot. The engine of the car was on and a
person wearing a large hat sat in the driver's side playing loud music. Brakke was unable to get the license
plate number, but did notice that the car did not have
a c-lot parking sticker on its bumper that all student
cars are required to have. She reported this to public
safety and the Swarthmore Borough Police who failed
to investigate the black Honda further. "I hope that it
was a student but think that it was linked to the car

theft," says Brakke.
Director ofPublic Safety, Owen Redgrave, says
that it is difficult to assess who the thief is. He
also mentioned that the 1991 Honda Accords are
one of more popular cars to stolen for parts. When
asked what measures public safety was taking to
prevent more car thefts, Redgrave said, "Full liability is still on the owners, but we of course are
paying more attention to parking areas on campus. I've had discussions with police, and they are
making more swings through the campus and its
parking areas." He says that the chances of either
Cheung or Brakke recovering the cars are very slim.
Both Cheung and Brakke would like to see the
administration doing more to prevent crime on
campus. Especially in light of the fact that former
Dean of the College, Ngina Lythcott's Honda Accord was stolen from campus just last year. "Prevention needs to be done," says Cheung, "How many
cars have to be stolen until action needs to be taken?"
Brakke spoke with President Al Bloom earlier
Thursday afternoon and suggested to him that
video cameras be placed in the parking lot with
signs warning any possible thieves of the cameras.
She says that he seemed to like the idea and was
going to discuss the possibility with Associate Vice

has made great
strides in the
past hundred
years towards
gaining first
acknowledgement
and then acceptance in the mainstream continuum. However, it certainly was assured that over one
hundred years ago, when policies
like our housing code were drafted,
that administrators were not factoring homosexuals into the equation.
This omission, ironically, serves to
highlight an issue that is lurking
somewhere among the future housing debate topics: co-ed living spaces.
It is clear to see that homosexuals involved in a relationship are not
explicitly restricted from rooming
together as the case is with heterosexuals. Let us be clear, we do not intend to argue that this is in essence
wrong, but merely to use this point
as a spark from which to light the
flame of inquiry under the housing department.
The idea of co-ed living spaces
breaches the subject that we need
to eat away at the stigma of sex, as
one Yale students writes, "we need
to address each other as human beings and not projections of our
genitalia." Is the school really helping to break down the wall of intrinsic discomfort by not allowing
for men and women to directly confront their differences through a coed living experience? One thing is

certain,

Swarthmore's

wouldn't it be
consistent
then to also
have staff in each dorm patrolling to
see that dorm rooms, no matter the
gender makeup, weren't put to sinful
use? Rather, the policy seems a relic
of a less progressive time.
What is the answer to the heterosexual student's question ofwhy he
or she can't room with his or her
partner when it is" possible for homosexuals to do just that. What,
too, is the reply in the case of two
friends of different sexes wanting
to room together? Critics will cite
the practical issues of what to do
in the situation where a relationship goes awry, however, this line
of thinking must exclude the possibility that homosexual relations
can also turn sour. Indeed, if the
current situation of housing is inherently flawed, shouldn't its remedy be new and unsettling.
Are we, indeed, issuing the signal that we are men and women
first, and people secondly, that the
differences between male and female are so fundamental that they
exclude the possibilities of being
able to live together? The Phoenix
ed board is divided concerning this
issue and we encourage reader input as to the direction the college
should consider taking.

To the editor:
Unethical practices by academes and administration at
Swarthmore College must cease.
Is professionalism possible
without honesty? How can conduct unbecoming be judged as
such when the judge, jury and
accused form a troubadour
band?
The story is of a Swarthmore
sophomore subjected to the
sneer tactics of a callous professor ofreligion, the tacit approval
of department heads, and the
hypocrisy of the present dean,
provost and president of the college.
But listen to the sparkling
words of our president at the
1997 Commencement: "The
ethical consciousness you have
developed here will enable you
to grapple with the... value complexities of our global order.
Your ability to listen and grasp
others' perspectives will equip
you to build trust and..." (on and
on!).
Do the words, "ethical consciousness," "value complexities," "trust," mean anything at
all? Are they just handy honorifics used to give credence to
occasions of pomp and ceremony? It is the duty of every
student and every alumnus who
feels loyalty to this academic institution to challenge the virus
of guile and deceit that exists at
Swarthmore College. To whom
does a college belong: to the students (past, present, and future)
or to the administration?

Op-Ed
The question of social
responsibility in
investment

Swarthmore's

endowment—worth nearly three-quarters of
a billion dollars—is among of
the nation's largest on a per stu
dent basis among top liberal arts
colleges. Moreover, theendowment'smarket
value has more than doubled in recent
years and continues to grow, both as a result of the bull market and additional gifts
to the college.
According to the College Bulletin, the
endowment contributes $ 17,000 toward the
cost of a Swarthmore education and provides one-third of the college's annual operating revenues. Clearly, the continued
excellence of the college depends heavily
on the success of the maintenance and
growth of the endowment.
At the same time, however, we cannot
ignore altogether the issue ofhow we have
achieved such resolute financial success
and educational preeminence. As a college
founded upon and devoted to ethical thinking and social responsibility, we must at
least consider whether we have acquired our
abundance through less-than-noble means.
No one would dispute the notion that
maintaining a superior faculty and administration, need-blind admissions, needbased financial aid, a low student-faculty
ratio, an attractive campus, and modern facilities are worthy endeavors. These,
among other tenets of the college, are what
make Swarthmore so distinctive and celebrated. Furthermore, they are what make
a Swarthmore education so expensive.
There is an additional component of
Swarthmore, however, that is less quantifiable but no less important: the college's
commitment to social responsibility. The
purpose of the college, according to the
Bulletin, is to "help students realize their
fullest intellectual and personal potential
combined with a deep sense of ethical and
social concern." One area, however, where
what the college practices and what it
preaches are potentially inconsistent is that
of its investment policy. In fact, it is the
policy of the college to invest in such a way
so as to maximize profit, all other social
objectives notwithstanding.
The college has many millions of dollars
invested in such corporations as Philip
Morris, Disney, Westinghouse and

Microsoft, for instance. These are companies that lie to the government, exploit
workers abroad by paying pennies an hour,
blatantly ignore pollution laws, and utilize
monopoly power to overwhelm competition.
The practices of Westinghouse should be
particularly disturbing to Swarthmore. The
company has built a trash incinerator in
nearby Chester, a low income, predominantly African-American community
which did not have the resources to fight
the project and is now suffering from its
highly toxic output. Swarthmore student
activists (SPEEC) are working to fight this
kind of environmental racism in Chester,
and have recently been funded by a large

It's

a very simple principle: work gets
assigned, work gets done. Yet some
thing always seems to muddle that ageold process, and you end up in semi
nar without having done any of the
reading. Now, you're all wondering why I'm
bothering to waste your time spouting truisms,
but I wish to make a distinction between two
different types of procrastination-inducing distractions here. First, you have the problems
we all face at one time or another during the
day, what I am going to term "sympathetic
problems." These factors include among other
things your friends, your sports teams, your
extracurricular activities, your campus jobs.
No matter how hard I might attempt to barricade my door, these diversions always seem
to find their way between me and my work
(especially my hall mates, who appear to have
designed a drinking game based on ruining
my academic career). Wrestling, too, tends to
slow down my work rate, since, following
practice, I have trouble exercising many of the
motor functions necessary for studying (i.e.
breathing, seeing, etc.).
Now don't get me wrong here: I'm not playing Misery Poker (though I assure you that
my hall can make a drinking game out of that
one as well. Hell, let's face it: my hall could
make a respectable drinking game out of
Tiddly Winks™. But I digress). I'm simply
enumerating these problems with the later goal
of distinguishing them from what I'm going
to term "unsympathetic problems." See,
friends, sports from hell, etc., are sympathetic
because, at bottom, they either recognize that
you do have work to do, or they themselves
have to stop drinking long enough to do some
work themselves. You can legitimately miss
practice for the Orgo exam you know you're
going to fail anyway, and your hallmates will
eventually leave off sabotaging your future

the community during the
19605. As growing campuses began to expand their borders
into their neighborhoods, they
sometimes met fierce resistance
from residents who lost their parks
and sometimes their homes when
new facilities were built. At the
same time, an invigorated sense
of community responsibility
blossomed both within and beyond the campuses during the
civil rights era.
Yet the notion of community responsibility never became an institutionalized part of the curriculum.
Almost four decades later, seventeen prestigious colleges and universities met at the College to muck
over the same issues. Now their
concern is propelled more by the
decline of urban centers than any
uproar from within or beyond the
campus gates. Panels of students,
faculty, administrators, and community representatives discussed
the question of how colleges and
universities can fulfill theirresponsibility to their communities while
pursuing their research and intellectual objectives.Higher education
still has not made the connection
that they ought to be pursuing their
mission in the community. The assumption that colleges and universities have a responsibility is the
major problem preventing effective
community involvement. Colleges
are chartered specifically for the
purpose ofeducating students. Parents pay tuition with the expectation that their dollars will be spent
on educating their children. The
government already takes their
money to pay for social programs.
If taxes are not enough, they may
voluntarily donate their time or
money to their favorite charity. Tuition is for the specific purpose of
educating students. Similarly,
government education grants and
loans are designed to support the
goal of promoting access to
higher education. Parents and the
government pay for higher education, not the community next
door.
One panel member suggested that
universities ought to invest in their
communities. In his view, it is not
enough for theuniversity to employ
residents, build facilities, and buy
pizzas and supplies from local
vendors. Does it make any difference whether the university is located in an affluent or disadvantaged community? Should we
serve the least of our brothers or
the ville kids?
The main reasons generally given
for community service programs is
to promote development of social
conscience or to prevent your institution from getting stuck in another New Haven. Community service activities may receive college
support if and only if such activities advance some goal of the college such as developing socially
conscience students. The College
may provide limited support for
feeding the homeless, tutoring children, or any other social cause. But
spending College funds to make a
more substantial investment in any
community will require more justification than altruism. It should be
remembered however that the primary mission remains to foster the
intellectual development of students. Second, community service
and other investments may be justified if the deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood threatens
the quality oflife of college members. The College has only the
former concern. A strong wind out
of the West might blow some incinerator pollution our way, but that
is the extent of the College's legitimate worries about Chester. At the
institutional level, higher education
lacks the motivation to define its
role beyond vague notions of community responsibility which is a
major reason why so many prestigious schools are mucking around
at conferences.
Any substantial commitment to
the community must ultimately be
grounded in the research and intellectual missions of higher education. The challenge to higher education is finding a way to justify
being a genuine stakeholder in the
community.

Improving the curriculum: the CEP's plans for change
Nate Stui.man

In conjunction with the extensive
review of the college currently being conducted by the College Planning Committee (CPC), the Council on Educational Policy (CEP) is
investigating a variety of possible
changes in the curriculum. Provost
Jennie Keith, chair of the CEP, sees
the review as "broad in scope" and
"very important" to the future of the
academic program.
The CEP is considering abolishing the so-called Primary Distribution Requirement and replacing it
with a distribution requirement
based on processes of thought, such
as creative writing, visual analysis,
and quantitative thinking. "There

presence of law-related courses
may be increased in the Department
of Political Science.
The college is also seeking ways
to provide increased institutional
support for community based learning (CBL), including course programs that involve internships and
trips to other communities. The
current level of support for CBL
projects—including the Political
Science Department's set ofclasses
entitled "The Democracy Project—is "inadequate," according to Keith.
The CEP is likely to recommend
that funding be made available to
faculty to expand the role of CBL
in their courses and to students for
transportation to the communities
being studied and other expenses

are other ways to conceptualize
graduation requirements rather than
mere distribution requirements,"
says Keith, who noted that a student might be able to fulfill a quantitative thinkingrequirement, for instance,
in one ofseveral departments.
The CEP also looked into over
150 possible new majors and concentrations last year. Taking student interest into account, the
Council is expected to endorse the
creation of concentrations in Islamic Studies, Cognitive Science,
and Film and Media Studies. Japanese Studies may be integrated into
the Department of Modern Languages, an expanded emphasis on
creative writing may be added to
the English Department, and the

involved in CBL projects.
In addition to expanding the academic program, Keith and the CEP
are looking at possible deficiencies
in the current program. A survey
administered last spring found that
the primary curriculum complaint
among students was the frequency
of full and closed classes. "There
may be a strong need for new faculty in departments that are heavily
enrolled," notes Keith. Additionally, Keith is looking to increase the
number of faculty in order to alleviate
the problems students face when certain faculty members are on leave.
The CEP is also involved in a general review of student workloads.
There is some concern that the
workload among different depart-

,

By

ments is significantly unequal. The

student survey conducted last year
reflected the attitude that natural
science majors are far busier than
students in other departments.
What, if anything, will be done to
address this concern has yet to be
determined.
After the CEP finishes the process of integrating new areas of
study into the curriculum and improving what is already there, it will
begin studying how future curriculum integration should take place.
"We will explore ways for students
to ask for courses to be taught from
someone off campus," says Keith.
Keith says that any major changes
to the program of study will probably be offered to current students,

Campus

Minority admission numbers drop
from PHONE, AI

mately 12% of students admitted in 1993;
last year this figure dropped to 10.8% before rising sharply to 15.9% in 1997.
Therefore, despite a slight decline between
1993 and 1995, the percentages of AsianAmerican, African-American and Latino
students in Swarthmore's admitted class
grew significantly in 1996 and 1997.
Although the numbers of minorities in
Swarthmore's enrolled classes have also
gone up, they continue to lag behind the
percentages of minority students in the
admitted groups. The percentages of African-Americans in the first-year class grew
from 6% in 1994 to 7% in 1997. In 1994,
4% of students in the enrolled class identified as Latino and 10% as Asian-American; these figures have climbed to 11 % and
12%, respectively. Since African-Americans comprise nearly 14% of the 18 to 24
year-old population in the United States,
this group remains underrepresented at
Swarthmore. However, the percentage of
Latinos in this year's class is almost identical to
their representation in the age group at large.
Indeed, many students say that the Admissions Office has made a strong effort
to increase ethnic diversity on campus and
has been responsive to student concerns
about minority admissions. "Personally, I
think that the school is doing a very good
job in its recruiting efforts," asserts Vincent
Jones '9B, Co-President of SASS
(Swarthmore African-American Student
Society). "It has instituted policies to identify black students, and has increased the
likelihood of having these students apply
and then actually come to Swarthmore."
Zoe Whitley' 01, an admissions intern for
SASS, agrees with this assessment. "Considering its small size, the college is doing

that admissions tends to direct its recruitment efforts toward minorities who only

very well in terms of minority recruitment."
Earlier this year, representatives from the
admissions office met with SASS, SAO
(Swarthmore Asian Organization), and
HOLA (Hispanic Organization for Latin
American Awareness). "At the meeting we
made suggestions and [Tracey Matthews
and Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet]
listened to our concerns. Although they
agreed with some of our perceptions and
disagreed with others, they listened to everything we said. I think that Admissions
is very approachable.. .you can walk in and
talk to anyone."
But in the words of Martha Santana 'OO,
admissions intern for HOLA, "there is
room for improvement; it's not a Utopia
anywhere." While acknowledging that the
percentages of minority students have
risen, many students express concerns
about low levels of diversity within each
ethnic group.
Santana emphasizes that "although this
hasn't been a problem in the past, the students admitted this year tend to come from
similar economic backgrounds. Admissions
keeps going to the same schools to recruit."
She feels that for the current first-year class
(again, this has not been an issue in general) the College targeted students from
suburban high schools and neglected those
from urban areas. Moreover, she points out
that "Latinos are represented from every
country; nevertheless, the numbers are
skewed, favoring certain countries over
others."
HOLA members Elida Salcedo 'OO and
David Andrade '9B raise similar issues.
According to Salcedo, "Although the percentage ofLatinos has gone up, not many
social classes are represented. Also, there
aren't many students from cities such as
Philadelphia and Chicago." Andrade says

attend elite or affluent schools. "Statistics
show that numberwise, the admissions office seems to be doing a much better job in
recruiting students of color, which in a
sense implies that more students from diverse economic and social backgrounds are
being recruited," he explains. "I hope that
this is actually the case and that admissions
is not intentionally recruiting only from
certain high schools at the expense of others. Swarthmore can claim that diversity
is increasing by pointing to the numbers,
but this creates a false ideal image about
the school. Admissions should recruit from
as many schools as possible and not just
hit the elite or affluent institutions."
Admissions denies that it focuses recruitment on students from a particular economic background. Says Robin Mamlet,
"...our special outreach is devoted almost
exclusively to students of all races from
lower economic and inner city backgrounds. I do not understand why students
would feel that we target middle- or upper-class students ofcolor more than those
from inner-cities, for this is not the case."
But Jones says that he understands why
some schools may be overlooked. "To do
well at Swarthmore you need a certain type
of preparation. Admissions doesn't go to
many inner-city schools—or rural
schools—because that preparation just isn't
there." And yet, because Swarthmore lacks
a name in the black community, the
college's yield for black students has remained fairly low. Jones suggests that this
situation might improve if news articles
pertaining to Swarthmore appeared in magazines aimed toward African-Americans.
"We need to do different things to get
Swarthmore's name out in the mainstream."

Supreme court ruling to
affect college credit union
from CREDIT, AI
tists' offices.
The Justices' ruling in the case could hinge on the
interpretation of the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act
which brought credit unions under the regulation of
the National Credit Union Association and limited their
membership to "groups having a common bond of occupation or association." Banks have argued that the
"common bond" stipulation should imply single-employer credit unions, while credit union regulators interpret the plural "groups" as allowing for multipleemployer credit unions.
If the Court requires FMFCU and other credit unions
to return to single-employer status, the credit union
could be forced to close its Swarthmore doors. According to officers at the Swarthmore Branch and at
the Credit Union's headquarters, FMFCU would seek
to avoid this eventuality either by pressuring Congress
to write new legislation, or by re-chartering the credit
union to make it a community based credit union serv-

Despite some conflicting perceptions of
Swarthmore's recruitment strategies, the
Admissions Office and organizations for students of color are working together to draw
members of minority groups to theCollege.
SASS, SAO and HOLA are involved in planning open houses and Minority Pre-Frosh
Weekend. Furthermore, an Admissions intern and several ambassadors from each of
these organizations help to recruit minorities while facilitating communication between the Admissions Office and students
ofcolor on campus. When Admissions conducts minority phone-a-thons, students of
color talk to prospective students about
Swarthmore. In addition to hosting minority students, they serve as panelists during
information sessions for students. Comments Jones, "By providing a perspective on
Swarthmore, we establish a connection to
the school for prospective students."
Both the Admissions Office and the student organizations also share the primary
objective of improving ethnic diversity
within the student body. Tracey Matthews
hopes to "continue with our success of enrolling a racially/ethnically diverse group of students.
We would like to see even more of a community
ofcolor at Swarthmore."
Andrea Johnson '9B, who works with
Alumni Affairs through SASS, adds that
"We want to make sure that excitement about
minority enrollment continues. In 1994
when I was a first-year student at
Swarthmore, I heard that the college wanted
to have a student body that was 12% African-American, because this is the percentage in the entire U.S. population. Personally, I think that we should continue to strive
toward this goal. Though some people might
argue that school is exclusively about academics, I believe that diversity plays a vital
role in education."

President, Larry Schall. "Al Bloom was
very caring and supportive. I have faith
that Al will take this seriously," says Brakke.
Brakke added that various administrators have offered personal stories of
car theft to her. One administrator mentioned to her that she had a friend
whose car was broken into a few weeks
ago while parked in Cunningham lot.
Even though a very detailed description of the offender was provided by
witnesses, there has been no publicity
of this event on campus. In addition,
Brakke spoke with a dealer at a Philadelphia Honda dealership who lives on
Park Avenue, three blocks from campus whose Honda Accord was stolen
three months ago. "I wish I had known
about these thefts because I would have
been much more cautious having known
the real danger of parking in the town of
Swarthmore," Brakke concluded.
Although all of these incidents have
occurred within the last few months,
Sergeant Raymond Stufflet of the
Swarthmore Borough Police says, "We
don't get a lot of cars stolen. In the campus it does not happen at all, nearly."
Brakke and Cheung both believe that
the Swarthmore community as a whole
should be more safe-conscious and take
precautionary measures such as installing alarm devices if they own a car.
Redgrave also suggests that car owners take a further step in protecting their
cars so that they will not be an easy
target. "The community thinks that we
are not affected by crime. We are too
comfortable," says Brakke.

The Court could also rule in favor of the credit unions
and against banks, or it could rule against credit unions
but not force credit unions that have already expanded
their membership base to divest back down to singleemployer status. The Court's ruling could come as
early as January.
John Caskey, an Associate Professor of Economics
at Swarthmore who has also held an unpaid position
on FMFCU's Board of Directors since 1996, says there
were some hints the Court might rule in favor ofcredit
unions on a technicality. During the oral arguments
heard in October, Justices questioned extensively
whether or not banks had standing in a matter between
credit unions, their regulators and Congress.
Looking at the situation, Caskey indicated he thought
there was reason for credit unions and their members
to be optimistic. "I'm hoping the Court doesn't rule
in the most drastic way, forcing them to disband," said
Caskey of the creditunions' predicament. "That would
just be so disruptive, I think it is unlikely."

'

The festival featured late directorLucio Fulci’s 1980 masterpiece The Gates Of
Hell and his 1979 flick Zombie. I had seen both of them before, but experiencing
these astonishingly gory and remarkably entertaining flicks on the big screen reminded
me of why I love movies. After the numbing stupidity of recent, watery horror pictures
like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, Fulci’s movies have inspired me to
fashion this guide to the best of the indie horror renaissance of the 70’s and 80’s, just in
time for Halloween!
Because most Swatties are force-fed dreck like The Rock every weekend, they probably
don’t know that some of the most celebrated horror movies of all time were made right
here in Pennsylvania. George A. Romero, a Pittsburgh native, has the distinction of having
directed multiple cult classics, including 1962’s Night Of The Living Dead and its sequel,
1978’s Dawn Of The Dead, as well as the 1982 classic Creepshow and the epic 1981 biker
flick Knightriders.
Night Of The Living Dead was revolutionary for its time, and is still a wonderfully atmospheric piece of work, done on virtually no budget, with no stars, and is, of course, highly
recommended. Dawn Of The Dead, however, remains one of the greatest movies ever
made by any director, and it was such a sensation when it came out that it spawned virtually a whole genre of cheap zombie flicks.
Dawn Of The Dead begins at a TV news station, where reports of zombies craving human flesh are coming in from all over the world. No one knows what to make of the
zombie phenomenon. Eventually, some reporters and SWAT team members take refuge in
a deserted shopping mall. (The’Monroeville Mall, still a cool place to shop in Western PA.)

Many students are not aware of the mysterious legend of the ML
ax murderer. This rare photo (taken very recently) provides
compelling evidence that he still haunts the campus.

Letting it all hang out
by Dan Green

by Sig Rydquist
This weekend is Halloween, which brings along with it the annual
trek to to that dorm which some forgot and others never knew
about in the first place-yes, it's the ML Halloween party. Traditionally this party has had bands, but this year there will be a Dj, which
gets a mixed reaction from the masses.
Friday night is the first annual Singled Out, being put on by SAC
in upper tarbie. It sounds like it should be quite entertaining,
even for those not participating. The show kicks off soon after ten,
so those worried about their image don't have to worry about being
"fashionably late." Olde Club is also hosting a band on Friday.
Without a doubt last weekend's Party of the Week Was the "Lost
in Space" party. It will also fight for the esteemed prize of Party
of the Semester, a prize so coveted that t have had to turn down
numerous bribes. The Jazz Swing formal is also in contention, and I
am sure that the Halloween party will be no disappointment either.

The

Men's and Women's Rugby

teams upheld the most glori

ous of Swarthmore traditions
last Friday: The Dash for Cash.
Though the perspective of the
participants was generally limited during
the Dash, to judge by the deafening noise
level there were hundreds, nay thousands
of Swatties, staff, faculty, parents, and alums who lent their support to the Fall
Weekend (if that's what the PR. Department calls it now) tradition.
The Dash was a great success despite
the poor turnout among the ruggers: it was
clearly a case of quality over quantity.
Several first-years were disappointed,
however: "We wanted to see more naked
people," said one disappointed male.
Many women, and both captains of the
Men's team, were exposed as a bit gun-

shy. This Dash continued the laudable
trend towards complete nudity, as the
Men's team completely dispensed with
the anonymity of paper bags.
Traditions like the Dash for Cash are
indispensable for bringing the campus
together: members of all branches of the
Swarthmore community standing together, offering cold, hard cash to those
who live the maxim: if you have it, flaunt
it. The ruggers thank the Swarthmore
Community for their support, and plan
to spend the money on new jerseys and
other incidentals. For the next display of
rugby-style athleticism, be sure to come
out to DuPont field on Saturday at Ipm
for the last Men's game of the season.
Next week: watch the Women's team
continue to completely steamroll, abuse,
and generally bludgeon their opponents.

The undead haunt on All Hallow's Eve
They live there for several months, with zombies at the door, until a gang ofbikers (led by
effects maestroTom Savini) breaks in, the zombies get in, and all hell breaks loose.
Dawn Of The Dead is terrifically expansive and epic in scope, but never loses sight
of its homespun, tongue-in-cheek characters and dialogue. Romero's film making
technique is refreshingly direct. There isn't
a scene that isn't filled with graphic gore
effects, but Romero is a master showman,
and his zombies are often very funny. He
extracts riotous performances from his actors, especially Savini, who yuks it up while
sticking machetes in zombies' heads. Also
unforgettable is the rock score by Goblin,
an Italian band with no equal.
If you've never seen Dawn Of The Dead,
you're missing out on one of the seminal
American film experiences.
Those Crazy Italians
The Italian film industry is responsible
for a whole lot more than you probably
realize: modern gangster flicks, spaghetti
westerns, cheap horror, and great sciencefiction movies. Yes, while cinema snots
the world over were busy making 'important' films, the Italians went right for the

throat and dared to show people what they
actually wanted to see: tough guys, violence, sex, and blood and guts.
The king of Italian horror is Dario
Argento. Argento's career has spanned four
decades, and he shows no signs of slowing
down. His movies are all wonderfully original, and his reliance on operatic story-telling
and film making styles only disturbs the viewer
more. His early horror flicks (Four Flies On
Gray Velvet, The Bird With the Crystal Plumage) and somewhat hard to find on video, and,
while interesting, are hopelessly dated.
In 1975, Argento made Profondo Rosso,
known in the US as Deep Red or Deep Red
Hatchet Murders, and it was an enormous
hit. Deep Red is a disturbing, twisted movie,
with extremely graphic violence that takes
on a strange beauty in Argento's eye.
The ten-year period between 1977 and
1987 was the most fertile for Argento. 1977
brought with it Suspiria, his gleefully
graphic story of an exclusive European
dance academy (located in the middle of
nowhere, of course) that is run by an ancient coven of witches. In 1978, he produced Romero's Dawn Of The Dead.
In 1982 Argento wrote and directed
Tenebrae, starring Anthony Franciosa as a
mystery novelist who seems to be followed

by a serial killer during a visit to Italy. The
movie is filled with great characters, amazing special effects, and one genuinely disturbing sequence after another. It also has
a Goblin synth score that is positively
danceable. Sadly, thanks to the assholes
at the MPAA, Tenebrae is only available
in the US on video as Unsane, which omits
several astounding effects sequences, including a knock-out axe dismemberment
near the end of the picture.
Argento's true masterpiece, in Italy called
Opera, and, in America, Terror At The
Opera, came in 1987. It's about an Italian
opera diva who is stalked by a kinky serial
killer, and the movie brings all of Argento's
themes full circle, from his obsession with
large birds to his love of intricate torture.
Terror At The Opera is highly recommended for Halloween viewing.
Lucio Fulci (aka Louis Fuller)
Zombie is known in Italy as Gli Ultima
Zombi or Zombi 2 (it was marketed as the
sequel to Dawn Of The Dead which was
known there as Zombi) and on a Japanese
laserdisc I saw, it was called Zombies 2, so
there's an enormous confusion as to what
the hell it's actually titled. In America, it's
either Zombie or Zombie 2, which is a stunning revelation, as it's the only film I know

other side of the street, a metal sign
branches off from the traffic light.
It reads: "1992 5 deaths" and
1993-10 deaths." The red sign,
mangled from the 33 degree Celsius heat, has to be the most unappealing sign in the history of unappealing signs. There are no traffic

there is a sign in front of the control booth that reads :

The pandal that I went to lies at
the end of a narrow lane branching
off Garihiat Road. It was a temporary structure made of straw and
palm leaves. Each pandal has its
own unique design and type of
people who celebrate the "Durga
Puja" there. They hold many divine statues, such as Vishnu, the
god of sustenance, maintenance
and protection, and Shakti, the inscrutable power that is responsible
for all existence. The Pujari (master of ceremony) held a forty-five
minuteritual with strong percussive
accompaniment from the dhak, a
group of drummers. The "Durga
Puja," which is in celebration of
Durga and her shakti, is the largest

of all puja celebrations on the
Hindu calendar. It is notoriously
celebrated in the East Bengali
states. "Durga Puja" is a four day
event. The crowd was captivated
by the percussion and smoke from
the numerous "dhupes" (incense
sticks) that filled the pandal. The
atmosphere appeared to enliven
even the laziest to shake some
booty. It was by far the most unique
puja that I have attended; religious
conventions were broken with balloons, food and a carnival atmosphere.
As a foreigner, one cannot help
being skeptical on the first day, but
soon afterwards the beauty of
India's most populous and impoverished city becomes much more
apparent. The Indian proverb, "all
that is not given is lost," is an understatement of the character with
which Bengalis in Calcutta live
their lives.

of that actually achieved being its own sequel ! Fulci really was a genius.
The Gates Of Hell also plays the familiar Italian game of alternate titles. It's
known as Twilight of The Dead (very
funny) or City Of Living Dead, and, in Italian, Paura Nella Citta del Morti Viventi.
(Morti Viventi is 'living dead,' of course,
and has to be one of the coolest phrases in
any language anywhere.) The Gates ofHell
can be found in America in one of those
gigantic early 80's video boxes reserved for
bad horror movies and pornography. The
box has a big-ass rotting skull on the front,
as well as an enormous warning that the
squeamish should not view the movie, another staple of great 80's horror videos.
The movies themselves are very typical
of the genre. In all of these movies, most
of the plot seems to have occurred before
the film actually begins. In The Gates of
Hell, the plot focuses on a priest who hangs
himself, unleashing the dead upon
Dunwich, a small town in upstate New
York. A newspaper reporter (sturdy, irreplaceable Christopher George) teams up
with some girl who was mistakenly buried
alive (and who presumably knows something about the undead, as she was 'killed'
during some sort of strange seance) to stop

the invasion of the flesh-eating zombies!!!!!
Zombie opens with a deserted boat sailing past the Statue ofLiberty. (Actually, it
opens with someone getting his head blown
open.) The police check the boat out, only
to find ZOMBIES!!!!!!! The owner of the
boat, a famous scientist working on some
Carribean island, is nowhere to be found,
and so his daughter teams up with a newspaper reporter and goes to the Carribean
where they find
more ZOMBIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's all pretty exciting.
I've told you all you need to know about
the plots, so you can just rent these flicks
and fast-forward to the great gore sequences. The Gates Of Hell is famous for
a scene in which a woman vomits up her
own intestines while crying blood. Her
male companion then gets the back of his
head ripped open, and his brains fall out.
This scene received an enormous round of
applause from myself as well as the rest of
the audience at the Harwan's Zombie fest.
Don't miss it.
Fulci directed a million other cheap horror movies before his untimely death in
Marchof 1996. Some of my favorites include
his 1981 classic The Beyond and 1982's The
New York Ripper, which could be the most vile,
unpleasant movie ever made. I love it!

One CD not worth a listen
from BINARY,AS
over and over with lots of banging and crashing. Finally, each song
culminated in an appropriately obnoxious ending.
My general impressions while
using this method were, as you
can imagine, very unfavorable.
Many of the cuts seemed as if they
should be used only as background music, that is, as the
overly dramatic music that one
hears during supposedly gripping
action movie scenes. While listening, the scary T-Rex scene in Jurassic Park came to mind. However, most songs seemed as
though they would be placed
more appropriately in a cinematic
moment, where the antagonist is
thrown down a flight of stairs.
This is not music that deserves
any place in your living room.
No matter what mood you are

in, The Binary System: Live at
the Idea Room has nothing to
offer.
Perhaps I am being a bit harsh.
The recording sound is of high
quality, and the simple instrumentationhas possibilities. I just don't
think that these possibilities were
taken advantage of. On several
tracks, Miller opens up the piano,
then using tools such as bolts and
alligator clips, performs his pieces.
This produces very foreign sounds
that could be interesting and entertaining, but are not. His "improvisation" ranges from painfully
trite to nonsensical, and even the
drumming seems a shade away
from skillful. The greatest problem with this CD is that it attempts
to combine the old and tired with
the ridiculous, while trying to pass
this monstrosity off as innovation.
But, if you must listen, I recommend the following tracks as al-

most bearable. Track 4 "Moon

I

from ZOMBIE.AS

Dance" is pleasant sounding, although very repetitive; it even has
some tolerable piano playing in it.
"Machete Hacker's Boogie
Woogie" actually sounds a bit like
jazz (although no self —respecting
jazz musician would ever name a
song with such abandon). This
must be one of the "jazz tinged
moments that the CD cover boasts.
If you feel like a laugh listen, to
"Abruption"—it sounds almost exactly like the pseudo-spooky
theme song to the TV show
"Goosebumps". So, if you care to
indulge in the loud and irritating
sounds of Roger Miller and Larry
Dersch, these would be the tracks
to choose; just make sure you're
equipped with some Tylenol and
that the CD remote is near. But better yet, spare yourself. For the love
of your neighbors, don't listen to
this CD!

SPORTS

Despite perennial setbacks, Garnet Tide carries on
By

Pat

With an early injury to starting
quarterback J.P. Harris '99, the Tide
had to change their game plan for
Ford
backup
quarterback
O'Connell 'OO. In his first bit of
serious playing time, O'Connell
performed admirably throughout,
finishing with 12 completions for
134 yards, while playing through a
cut that would later require 15
stitches. The running game was
grounded by Dickinson as Joe
Aleffi 'OO was held to just 23 yards.

Donaghy

With just 31 players dressed for the

Tide's game against Dickinson,

Swarthmore took the field amid the
adversity of several players quitting
earlier in the week. The last time
Swat met the Red Devils on Cloth,ier Field was the noted 19-18 upset
over the nationally ranked Red Devils. While the Tide gave its best effort to date, the final score read 43-0
in favor of the opponents.

The major question would be on

defense, however, where the Tide
lost four starters, three of whom
played defensive line. However, the
defensive line had its best game to
date, limiting the opponents leading
rusher to under 100yards for the first
time this season. Additionally, the
defensive line clamped down when
it mattered most, stopping the opponent four times inside it's own fifteen yard line.
Defensive coordinator Don Burns

noted the difference with the new
attitude of the team: "On one drive,
they got the ball to our three yard
line after a big play. But because
of the character of the players on
the field, we were able to have a
goal line stand, and they didn't
score. One week ago, that wouldn't
have happened."
Asked what he thought of the impact of the missing players, senior
co-captain Bernard Nossuli said
"The effort from the guys was

Danielle Duffy, Michelle Walsh,
Lauren Hopkins, and Sujin Seo for
their dedication to the program.
Duffy scored twice, assisted by
Baker and Donna Griffin '99, and
Walsh found the inside of the cage
to give the Garnet a 3-0 half-time
lead. Lurah Hess, back in action
after hand surgery, scored with an
assist from Griffin, and Kate Vivalo
'Ol scored a pair of goals, one off
Krista Hollis 'Ol. Goalkeeper
Hopkins made five saves.
The Garnet also toppled the Blue
Jays from Johns Hopkins, 4-0.
Assisted by English, Hess put her
team on the scoreboard in the first
three minutes of the game. Duffy

team's fate. "It all depends on the
next regional polls, as well as how
many teams from our region the
NCAA decides to allow into the
tournament. There are a lot of factors involved, and we really can't
control any of them. We definitely
have to win our next two games
against Bryn Mawr and Haverford,
lout other than that, it is completely
out of our hands," she said.
In the meanwhile, the Garnet are
doing all they can to improve their
chances for an NCAA berth. Swat
won a 6-1 match against Bryn
Mawr earlier this week on Senior
Day, when the team honored

there. We stopped them on their

first two drives. But we just
couldn't sustain it because people
were playing out of their normal
positions." Nossuli later added that
he thought it was their best defensive effort of the year.
Perhaps the best way to judge a
team is by the opinion of their opponents afterwards. After the final
whistle, a Dickinson coach said that
Swarthmore always plays hard no
matter what the circumstances. He

added that the players that chose to
stay on the team should be very
proud of what they did on the field.
Tucker Zengerle 'OO put in another stellar game with 17 tackles,
a forced fumble, and a blocked field
goal to receive a spot on the conference honor roll. Zengerle leads
the conference with 100 tackles.
Nimish Dave added 13 tackles
playing through severe pain. Up
next for the Tide is on the road
against Franklin and Marshall.

later in the game off Baker. Hagan
connected off a corner from English
and Duffy to round out the team's
scoring. The Garnet outshot their

Only one game remains on the
schedule for the Garnet, against ri-

val Haverford. "I'm excited we
have a chance this week to achieve
the best overall record (17-2) I've
seen at Swarthmore and what may
be the best record Swarthmore field
hockey has ever had," said Hess.
Whether it will be enough to lead
them to the NCAA tournament remains to be seen.

For the first time in four years, the
Swarthmore Women's Rugby team
earned the right to compete in EPRU
championships. While this was nice
and all, it was raining, it was cold,
and Swat had to play the top Eastern
contender in the country Princeton
the
University.
Although
Swarthmore team put up a great fight
against the beastly Princeton team,
they came up short. The final score
in the 60 minute game was 34-0.
However, it should be noted that
theSwat team was surprised to find

smallest margin that Princeton won
by all season! (Needless to say this
was no consolation). In the semifinal match at 1:00pm, Swat played
the University ofDelaware. Unfortunately, this game ended much the
same way the first one did. In a team
effort, Meghan Brennan 'OO scored
Swarthmore's only try of the day and
Rhiana Swartz 'OO kicked the conversion. The final score was 15-7.
This weekend, Swat will hit West
Chester with the full force that
Princeton was lucky enough to
miss. Come watch Sunday afternoon at 11:00AM.

Offense key

loses; but
rivalry
continues
By

Dan Barrick

They say that, back in 1902 when
rugby was first introduced to these
shores, the University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College
played each other in an early match
that was meant to increase the
popularity of the sport among college students in the area. President
Theodore Roosevelt, upon seeing
a photo from the Penn-Swarthmore
match, was so horrified and
shocked by what he saw, he banned
the game of rugby in the United
States. "This is a game for barbarians and hooligans," he supposedly
remarked, "and is not fit for the
youth ofAmerica."
While TR's ban obviously did not
last, the rivalry between the two
schools remains as strong as ever, as
evidenced by last Saturday's matchup. Both Penn and Swarthmore had
been struggling all season long, and
were hungry for a win. While
Swarthmore lost this week, the Evil
Buzzards played perhaps their finest match of the season.
As in their last match against York,
Swarthmore struck early, kicking off
to Penn and driving the ball inside
of their 22-meter line. They held it
here for 10minutes, making numerous runs toward the goal line, only
to be repelled by the Penn defenders. The Buzzards, getting frustrated,
changed tactics. On a beautifully
executed back-line, fullback Tony
Cho 'Ol, dodged two UPenn defenders and sprinted 30 meters for his first
try of the season.
Penn could not muster much of a
forward offense, as Swarthmore
rucked ferociously, keeping them at
midfield for much of the half.
However, shortly after Cho's try,
the UPenn flyhalf broke through
two Swarthmore tacklers to score.
After a scuffle involving a
Swarthmore rugger and a UPenn
rugger, the Quakers snuck another
try by Swarthmore. Penn put in
another one, bringing the score to
24-5 at the half.
Aware that they were losing to a
less than stellar team, Swarthmore
came into the second trying to swing
the momentum back in their direction. After a series of penalties in
Penn's half, prop Mike Sheer '99
took the ball into the try-zone himself, carrying two Penn forwards on
his back. Not willing to give up just
yet, the Buzzards continued their
strategy of continuous possession
and quick rucks to move the ball.
After struggling to gain ground,
scrumhalf Jerome Bushnell '99 ran
89 meters to put the ball down in the
try-zone, bringing Swarthmore with
two points of the lead.
However, after a couple of long
runs by Penn backs, the Quakers
scored another of their own, bringing the score to 31-17. A victory
still seemed possible for moments,
as inside-center juked and stutterstepped his way into the try-zone.
Despite a series of well-placed
kicks and pressure form the
Swarthmore backline, the clock ran
out just as the Buzzards were within
range to take the lead, as the final
score was Penn 31, Swarthmore 24.
While Swathmore clearly dominated Penn in terms ofball control
and in the rucks, it was a matter of
two or three breakdowns in defense
that accounted for the Penn tries
that ultimately hurt the Buzzards.
The Evil Buzzards play their final
match of the fall season tomorrow,
against Bucknell, on DuPont Field.
Support from the home crowd
would be greatly appreciated.

"lt's about time we won a

game," said Tim "Tough as
Metal" Bretle
after the
Swarthmore Men's soccer 2-0
victory over Ursinus College on
Wednesday afternoon.
Swarthmore dominated the
game from the kickoff, pressing
Ursinus for all they were worth.
The first goal came two minutes
into the game when Mike "The
Admiral" Schall netted a pass
from "The Rufus is on Fire"
Frazier. Swarthmore kept up
their dominating play, and a little

as

men's soccer wins at home

while later, Mike "Rusty"
Eschleman scored on another assist from Frazier. While there
were no more goals in the game,
Swarthmore had some golden
opportunities.
This was a game marred by penalties and colorful cards. Said Gus "Hot
Wheels" Albarelli, "We were able to
pull this one out despite some sketchy
officiating." In the second half, an
Ursinus player received a red card for
a hard foul. A few minutes later, the
referee pulled thered out on Schall for
stripping the ball (a little violently,
granted,but not deserving of ared) from
an Ursinus player. A whole pocket-

full of yellow cards made their appearances in the game. Recipients
includedl. Jedi Knight Lewis who received his fifth of the season, so neither he nor Schall will play in
Swarthmore's next match.
Sloppiness and officiating
aside, Swarthmore can really be
happy about this victory. Beating Ursinus brought the team's
winning percentage to .500 for
the season. Last Saturday, the
men travelled to Gettysburg to
face The Bullets. The first half
ended with Gettysburg up one
goal. Then in the second half, the

Routing Johns Hopkins and Bryn
Mawr this week, the field hockey
team improved its record to an impressive 16-2. Swat is tied with
Gettysburg for first place in the
conference, both with 7-1 records
in conference play, and Washington is on track to make it a three
way tie. However, a critical 2-1 loss
last week to Rowan could put an
end to the Garnet's hopes for a run
at the NCAA tournament and make
a shared conference championship
the Garnet's finale.
Ranked fifth in the region, just
one spot below the Garnet in the

affects chances of a berth in the NCAA

last rankings, Rowan was an important competitor for the team to beat.
The team took an early lead, with
Jen Hagan '99 scoring in the first
minute of the contest off a corner
from Danielle Duffy '9B and
Kristen English 'Ol.
"Thursday's game against Rowan
was an unfortunate example of
what happens to a good team when
they become too confident and
comfortable. . . We entered halftime up 1-0. Unfortunately, they
came out stronger in the second
half, and we returned with the
mind-set of just holding them, instead of the mind-set that we
needed to score to increase our
lead," commented Lurah Hess '99.

Rowan proceeded to score two
goals, with the game winner off a
penalty stroke.
While the loss was only the second one for the Garnet this season,
the hopes for postseason play remain hopes for now.
"Unfortunately, it's very hard to
try to guess what the Rowan loss
will do to affect our NCAA
chances," said Coach Karen
Borbee. "We still have two challenging games (against Bryn Mawr
and Haverford) left, and if we were
to win those we would have a very
good overall record. If you look at
the strength of our schedule, we
have played 6 regionally ranked
teams. Against them, we are 4-2. I

The women's soccer team continues to struggle against the
strong teams in the Centennial
Conference. This week the team
fell to 6-13 with losses to Johns
Hopkins and Muhlenberg. Despite their record, the Garnet continue to improve with each opponent they face.
Unfortunately for the Tide, the
game against Johns Hopkins began, as many have, on the defensive. Hopkins, ranked fifth in the,,
Mid-Atlantic region, dominated
the first half with four shots hitting the back of the net. Captain
Betsy Rosenbaum attempted to
even up the score by knocking
one in for the Tide.
Revitalized during the second
half, the Garnet held the Bluejays
to only one goal. On defense,
"Jen VanderVeer played a strong
game," according to Claire
Baxter. Throughout the latter
part of the game, Swat had many
scoring opportunities but just
could not connect. The final
score, 5-1, was Johns Hopkins
smallest margin of victory to
date. Captain Sarah Jaquette felt
the "team's aggressive solid play
in the second half left the players with an energy we haven't felt
in a while."
On Tuesday, the Garnet faced
Muhlenberg with their attitude
intact and were only defeated 10. Swarthmore's defense kept the
Mules' offense under pressure allowing them their only g0a1.,/
Goalie Emily Manetta kept the
score close with many heart-stopping saves. The contest remained
close with the Garnet attempting
to even it up throughout the
game. The solid play of both the
defense and offense was recognized by all three captains.
Claire Baxter expressed her
pride in the team's effort and perseverance in both contests. "The
intense level of play demonstrates the effort that our players
have put in this year."
The Garnet Tide hope to add a'
win to their record on Saturday
when they face perennial rival
Haverford away.

can only wait like everyone else and
hope that our team will get the
chance to play in the NCAA tournament. Last year we got in with a
record of 15-4, and I believe we
have a stronger team this year."
The strength of Swarthmore's
team is attested to by the presence
offive players on the conference's
top ten scoring list. Duffy, Holly
Baker '99, and Hess lead the pack
with 61, 42, and 38 points respectively. Hagan and English rank seventh and tenth.

This was a game full of not so

Luckily, to the relief of
Swarthmore's squad, the men in

Another big victory for the

as part of the yearly practical joke,

The men's tennis team ended
their fall season last Saturday at the
Rolex National Tournament held in
Memphis, Tennessee. Players
gained entrance to the tournament
on the basis of their performance
in regionals.
Swarthmore was able to send
three players, John Leary, John
Temin and Roger Werner. Leary
and Temin were able to go as a result of their victory in regional
doubles, while Werner went as a
result ofhis win in regional singles.
The three left Swarthmore on
Wednesday in order to be in Memphis by the time the tournament
started on Thursday and were accompanied by assistant coach and
recent Swat grad, Chris Pierson.

Eight teams went in total, ana
matches were played every day
until Saturday.
Leary and Temin lost their first
match on Thursday to Kalamazoo
College, but came back for a win
later in the afternoon. On Friday
they lost their final match to MIX'
and finished sixth.
Werner lost all three of his
matches, including two tight ones
to Kalamazoo and UC Santa Cruz.
He eventually finished eighth.
Leary felt that overall they didn't
"play very well, but it was tough
because some of the best players
in the country were there."
During their time in Memphis thetrio was able to visit some of the
more important tourist attractions,
including Gracelandand numerous
Blues bars.
With the conclusion of nationals,
came the end of the men's fall season. The fall season is primarily a
time for individual play, but once
spring comes they will be playing
more for benefit of the entire team..
