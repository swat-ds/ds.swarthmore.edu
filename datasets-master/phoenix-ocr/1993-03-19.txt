New Budget Reflects
Leaner Times
New programs, salaries to feel the change
by RACHEL MEYERS

The College budget for the

1993-94 school year will compen-

sate for the significant increase in
financial aid spending during this
schoolyear. While spending on student aid normally increases by the
approximate cost of tuitionand fees
(11.8 percent), grants actually went
up by 22.8 percent, accounting for
an additional $787,000, according
to President Al Bloom.
The surge in financial aid given
by the college seems to have been
caused by the recession, which hit
many families hard. With parents
out of work or experiencing longer
stretches between jobs, the college
stepped in to fill the gap.
To balance the budget, there
will be "a very conservative increase
in compensation for faculty and
staff," Bloom explained. Compensation is the combination of salary
and benefits. Funding for new programs and positions will also be cut
back.
"Rather than ask students immediately to contribute more, we
are asking the college to live in a
more constrained setting for a year
and see if the financial aid situation
improves on its own," said Bloom.
The administrationhopes thatfamilies will not need as much financial
aid as theeconomy improves. However, "If this continues, we'll have
to ask students to take out larger
loans, etc.," Bloom added.
Normally, faculty and staff
salaries overall increase by inflation plus 1.5 percent (which would
be about 4 percent this year). Because of the financial aid increase
and a major rise in the cost ofhealth
care benefits and workmen's compensation insurance, "salaries cannot increase at the level which we
hope," saidBloom. "It's very disappointing because we want to be able
to reward faculty and staff for the
tremendouscommitment they make
to the College," he added.
For the '9l-'92 school year,
the college spent $8,779,000 on
grants to students, which constitutes almost 18 percent of the total
budget. Of this, $85,000 went to

foreign study. The college may even
pay for two students at once: aidfor
the student studying abroad, and aid
for the student studying at
Swarthmore in his or her place.
There will be no change in the
college's need-blind admissions
policy, or in theformula for figuring
out what families have to contribute. While students will not have to
work more during the semester, they
will have to earn more in the summer. However, this increase in summer earnings may be added to the
loan component of upperclassmen.
Another adjustment to the budget involves departmental budgets,
which will increase 2 percent, which
is less than inflation (currently
around 2.9 percent). With the exception of the new positions being
created by the Dean's office, no
new jobs will be added. In addition,
very few new programs will be approved.
The college has continuedfunding for three current positions that
were previously funded by grants.
These include the slide coordinator
for the Art department, Susan
Smythe, who is in charge of scheduling events in the PAC and other
college space, and Gil Stott, who
assists students inapplying for grants
and prizes.
Also, three new RA positions
have been created: Willets basement, and Danawell basements.
Additional funding will go to
the athletic department, the library,
and to cover the increasing cost of
student health insurance.
Next year, tuition andfees will
increase by 5.5 percent, which includes .7 percent to cover the cost of
the new telephone and computer
network in the dorms, said Bloom.
"We are looking carefully at a
plan for the next several years
through which we can sharethe cost
of financial aid in a more balanced
way between the College and the
students without imposinghardships
on the students, and so that we can
be in a position to insititutethe kinds
of new academic and student life
programs that will make sure that
we stay at the educational world,"
explained Bloom.

Students Stranded by Blizzard of 93; Spring Break Ends in Snow
by CHRIS PRIEST
By now most people have heard about
the so-called storm of the century that paralyzed the east coast from Georgia to Maine
last Saturday. Of course, this coincided perfectly with the end of our spring break.
Swatties from all parts of the country battled
the transportation nightmare caused by the
weather in a desperate attempt to makeit back
in time for classes on Monday. Some were
not successful. Here is just a sampling of the
adventures that fellow students had during
the blizzard of '93.
Many students endured long airport delays and cancelled flights. Sophie Linguri '93
had flown out to Los Angeles for break and
was scheduledtocome back on Sunday. When
she called the airport on Saturday, the airline

told her everything was on schedule. However, on Sunday at the airport Linguri found
out that the flight was cancelled. Instead she
flew out early Monday morning only to meet
delays at JFK in New York and at Philadelphia International airport. "After such long
delays, I noticedthatother passengers slipped
into a winter travel trance. They would just
stare blankly and wait for something to happen," said Linguri.
Once Linguri landed she took a train to
30th Street Station, but her journey was not
done. There she boarded the R2 instead ofthe
R3 and ended up inWilmington at 11:45 PM.
She caught the last train to Prospect Park
where she phoned her hall in Wharton. Luckily, hallmatc Andres Versage was able to
drive out and pick her up, saving her from
spending the night in the station.

Aaron Feuer '94 and Danny Kamin '94
also experienced airline difficulties. They
were spending theirbreak inPhoenix, as were
Don Easley '94 and yours truly. After watching the Weather Channel and seeing the effects of the storm, we all assumed that we

Biosphere Class Examines Energy Use

Security

Briefs

by MATTHEW SCHENK
What do you really know about
energy use at Swarthmore? Sure,
you know that when you flip the
switch the light goes on, but doyou
know where that electricity comes
from, what is used to generate it, or
how much it costs you to leave that
light on when you leave the room?
Or do you even care?
Like it or not, issues concerning energy use affect eachand every
one of us, every day. The cost of
energy use at Swarthmore, which
includes electrical, heating and cooling, exceeds 1.3 milliondollars each
year. Even so, most students don't
lose too much sleep worrying about
energy use; few even realize that
thereis anything they can do aboutit
EnterSwat and the Biosphere,
theenvironmental watch-dog course
of Swarthmore College. This semester, the inter-departmental, action-oriented, Swarthmore-as-alaboratory class has chosen energy
use on campus as its target for reform. For thefirst halfofthe semester, the class has been busily researching energy issues, not only
here on campus, but on the global
scene as well. Asforthebiospheric
focus of the class, class facilitator
Carr Everbach comments that "it is
an implicit goal of this class to reduce the impact ofSwarthmore on
the environment."
Over thepast sevenweeks, Biosphere students have explored everything from psychological issues
concerning energy consumption to
the newest developments in energy
saving devices. Also during this
time, the coursehas sought to evaluate the attitudes and patterns involving energy use on the Swarthmore campus itself. In examining
these issues, the members of the
course decided to focus their efforts
in three different areas:
Dorm related student use: understandably, students account for
a major portion ofenergy consumption on campus. Focus in this area
would be placed on helping students become aware of energy use
issues, and using information gathered concerning student attitudes
and behaviors to create plan for a

Energy use in McCabe: McCabe uses a tremendous amount of
energy and accounts for a significant portion ofSwarthmore's total
energy demand. As lighting alone

amount used by lighting, and plans
to transfer theresults to other campus buildings.

the renovation of Trotter provides
the class opportunity to directly influence the future of energy use at
Swarthmore, and will enable the
campus to utilize some of the technology at the vanguard of energy
research.

In order to inform students as
to how they can reduce theirenergy
use, it is first necessary to find out

what the current level of use is. In
doing this, some members of the
Biosphere course gauged student
behavior by using a series of surveys and questionnaires. The first
of these surveys consisted of a revealing door-to-doorstudy of many
of the rooms in the Willets dormitory. Some ofthe particularly inter-

esting numbers revealed that each
room averaged four lights, at least
one computer (30% of the 45 rooms
had two computers), and one printer;
halftherooms had televisions, while
well over 60% had refrigerators.
The class has used these numbers to calculate the amount of energy used by students in their dorm
rooms, and hopes to put this information to use in making their final
plans.
Examining informationconsidering light fixtures alone, the class
has discovered that there is much
room for improvementin the area of
student use. Before reductions in
student use can be made, however,
it is important to discover what the
attitudes of students are concerning
energy use. To do this, the members
ofthe Biosphere course conducted a
second study, this one campus-wide.
Using this information, along
with the cooperation of the campus,
Swarthmore and the Biosphere
hopes to create a plan that will help
students reduce their consumption
of energy.
In the future, the Biosphere
course will be updating you on further progress in the area of student
use, as well as their work with McCabe and the new Trotter building.

and plan residence-based activities in order to provide
opportunities for students, faculty, and their families to
spend time together outside of the classroom."
Ly thcott said theposition is her attempt to "shift the
focus of some student activities to the residence halls—a naturally occurring heterogeneous grouping of students."
"The trickiest part is working with the faculty to
identify how they might want to become affiliated with
the halls," said Lythcott. "Many faculty feel they are

overworked with all the committees they sit on," she
said, "so I'm making this affiliation voluntary."
The appointment of a Student Activities Coordinator and a Director ofResidentialLife are Lythcott's
attempt to indirectly boost Swarthmore's social life.
"One of the most common phone calls I get from
parents offirst year's is that there's nothing for their
son or daughter to do on the weekends except go to
parties and get drunk," she said, "I want to make it
easier for students to organize otheractivities so that
isn't their only option."

Watson Fellows Selected for Projects
The Thomas J. Watson Foundation has announced that Swarthmore College seniors Miriam Bowling,
Maeghan Maloney, and Jeffrey Moray have been awarded fellowships for 1993-94. Grants totaling almost $1
million will be awarded to 65 graduating seniors from 44 small U.S. liberal arts colleges and universities.
The Watson Fellowships, awarded through a national competition for seniorsfrom participating colleges,
support independent travel and study outside theU.S.for each recipient for the year following graduation. Fellows
design their own projects which may involve any area ofinterest.
The 25-year-old Watson Fellowship Program provides stipends of $15,000 for single fellows and $21,000
for Fellows accompanied by a dependent. Since the program began over 1700Fellowships have been awarded.

McGruff's Tip of the Week
Welcome back kids. I went south for a week to catch some
rays, do the doggy-paddle and hang with the hounds. Hope
your break was a safe one, mine sure was. Brrrrr! This snow
better melt soon -it's hard on my paws and there is no place to
pee. If you drive a car keep these techniques in mind for safe
winter driving: 1) Drive more slowly, 2) Increase space
cushions, 3) Do not accelerate or brake sharply, and 4) Be
farsighted so you can anticipate any potential problems.

Recent SJC Decisions
The accused was charged with 1) unauthorized entry into a dorm
room, 2) theft, and 3) creating a hostileenvironment for his accusers. SJC
has found the accused to be in violation of the Student Code of Conduct
with regard to all three charges.
In light of the fact of the accused's honesty in admitting to all of the
SJC issues the following sanccharges, and his willingness to
tion: a written apology to his accusers. We also issue a formal warning to
him, which means that if he is involved in anyfurther judiciary matters, this
case will be taken into account There will be no permanent indication of
this matter on his record.

We also feel it necessary to stress the importance of students' locking
their dorm rooms to protect their belongings and themselves.

has outlined a broad-based service program
that eventually would offer up to 100,000
college students a chance to get education aid
in exchange for community work.
"National service is nothing less than the
American way to change America," Clinton
said on March 1 at Rutgers University. His
speech was greeted with loud cheers by the
students who packed the university's gym.
Among other tasks, students in the service program would help rebuild neighborhoods, clean up the environment and counsel
children, Clinton said. In the process, they
would earn tuition vouchers or forgiveness of
student loans and set in motion a new national
commitment to service.
Students also would have an option to
repay college loans by deducting apercentage
of their salaries after graduation.

"Well, I guess I'll have to stick it out

weather."
Easley and I made it into JFK
where we met with some delays,
and then we drove down to Philadelphia later that evening. Feuer
andKamin flew out on Tuesday, but
Feuer's flight was indefinitely delayed. After about 9 hours of waiting and travelling, he arrived at
Swarthmore. When walking into
his room at midnight, all he could
manage to say was, "Arrghhh!"
The storm created even more
problems for Swatties on the road.
Michelle Kellman '93 went on an
alumni retreat with other Swarthmore students, professors, and
alumni. They stayed at a resort in
Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.
On Sunday they found out that the
governor had ordered all theroads
in the state closed. There was a
rumor that the local authorities were
not stopping anyone from travelling. Thus the debate began. "Being good Swatties, we spent a long
time trying toreach consensus over
whether to brave theroads or to stay
overnight," saidKellman. Eventually they decidedto stay at the resort
on Sunday, and they were able to
reach Swarthmore on Monday.
A number of students were

staying in Tampa, Florida for winter break. On Thursday night, some
of them, namely Adam Blakeley
'94, Andy Heyman '94, and John
Colaianni '93, headed back to
Swarthmore. As a result they missed
the storm and were back in time for
classes. Blakeley had this to say
about their luck: "I'mbitter." In the
meantime, Will Buttram '94, Joe
Lange '93, Mark Harris '93, and
Matt Werner '93 were stuck in
Florida by the storm. "Since we
could not go north, we decided to
head south," said Buttram. They
ended up in Key West where the
temperatures were cool but the sun
was shining.
However, they were reminded
of the storm as they travelled down
to Key West. In northern Florida
the storm resembled a hurricane,
with lightning, high winds and rain.
"While playing cards outside of our
camper, which was rocking in the
wind, we were almost struck by
lightning. Later when travelling
through Miami, we saw the destruction that was caused by the storm,"
said Buttram. The group of four
returned toSwarthmore on Tuesday

plans because of budget constraints. He is
expected to release more details in April on
the structure of his service program in his
fiscal 1994 budget
In addition to the service initiative, the
president outlined a number of changes in
student loanprograms in his Rutgers appearance. One change could give students a
chance to pay back their education loans
based on a percentage of their post-college
income, whichhe said wouldallow graduates
to take more community service jobs. College graduates complain that economics are
forcing them to take higher-paying jobs immediately upon graduation just to repay student loans.
Such a policy wouldenable graduates to
"hold jobs that may accomplish muchbut pay
little," Clinton said.
USSA's Ley ton said income-based loan
repayment could help some students but hurt
others because of higher interest costs and a
longerrepayment schedule. She saidstudents
needed more details about this element of the
president's plan before passing judgement.
For his part, Clinton said his service and
loan proposals also would help reduce the
college dropout rate, which he described as
twice as high as the dropout rate in high
schools. "We can do better than that through
national service and adequate financing," he
said.

Neither Sleet nor Snow Keeps
Swat from Business-as-Ususal
by ETHAN BORG

I spent all day today going through the
motions of my tamed existence, a bit detached, verily vacant, though deeply aware
that some machine lurking in the depths ofmy
frontal lobes was chugging fiercely along
with the question: "Why, when all the cold,

So, beseeching my elders who make the
rules, I wish to tell you why school should be

worst storm of the centuries flinging swimming pools of flotsam and jetsam from the

least within the next two years ofmy community service.
First of all, thisis what i wouldhave done
had school been mercifully canceled. I tell
you this not to gloat in front ofmy peers, but
for your enlightenment, so that you may understandthe workings of the student mind all

of a doubt, I would have began this past snow
day writing all of my future seminar papers
and perhaps a few extra since my mouth
would have been salivating quite greedily,
and frankly, I am an Adonis of the scholastic
world. I would have then come up with a
tremendous thesis topic, something involving Freud and pork-chops, sand-papered off
the rough edges, and typed out at least two
chapters (not including the introduction, preface, autobiography, and acknowledgements)
before lunch.
Following on the agenda, I would have
paraphrased the next five physics chapters
into vernacular, and memorized my footnotes, especiallypagereferences. After which
I would have taken a tea break while
nonchalantly scanning over old GREs,
MCATs, LSATs, bars, eye-tests, and the college swim exam. After dinner, I would have

were not enough to persuade you of your
transgressions, let me be even more frank.
It was really darn cold out. And it was so
bright I not only sneezed several unpleasant
times, my eyes teared so heavily, men driving
plows came off their honker contraptions to

pick those scabs off prematurely, causing
new scabs to grow in a scary scary cycle with

travesty ofjustice?
I am really hurt by the lack of concern
shown by the administration. And I can'thelp

of your students shall go to sleep scratching
off itchy scabs tonight! Just imagine the poor
old sickly strangers still squinting through
fuzzy cataracts inside their wretched eyes!
Just imagine how I shall fail my swim test
having to cram the day it is given again!
Shame on you! Shame shame on you!

stops, when businesses close their icy doors,
when Pennsylvania calls in the National

Article Contains Racist Implications
To the Editor:
In the last edition of the Phoenix, Noah B. Salamon wrote an article titled Social Justice or Social
Revenge? Simply put, Salamon's
'work' is apiece ofpoor journalism.
Salamon wrote his article based on
a two minute encounter in which he
earsdropped on a conversation between myself and another student.
Salamon's article is filled with misinformation, base assumptions, and
gross, false characterizations.
Salamon, in his omniscience, attempts to character my project, my
intentions, and my opinion. I have
never met Salamon. I have never
spoken to Salamon.
I am doing a semester-long
project for Multicultural Politics, a
course being taught by Professor
Meta Mendel-Reyes this semester.
I am interviewing 40 Swarthmore
students, soliciting their reactions
to an anti-smoking advertisement
sponsored by the National Black
Leadership Initiative on Smoking.
(If you would like to see the ad,
Mendel-Reyes is displaying it on
her door in Trotter 8.) I am interviewing individuals from a wide
range of class, racial, and ethnic
backgrounds for this project.
The mistakes of whichSalamon
is guilty are numerous and gross.
Some ofhisremarks even have racist implications. Firstly, Salamon
is so completely off in his interpretation of die facts that he describes
me (a Swarthmore student) as a representative of an advertisement
agency. Due to Salamon's personal

interpretation ofmy appearance and
my "entirely professional" behavior, Salamon makes the rash assumption that "Swarthmore's wellknown sensitivity to race, gender,
and class issues has become something of a commodity to the advertising industry." What is Salamon
talking about? I am not a representative of an ad firm and never have
I misrepresented myself in such a
fashion. Salamon is wrong! He
has never even approached me
about my survey.
Secondly, Salamon states that
the ad "has been passed around
Swarthmore campus, in the hopes
ofsolicitingreactions and commentary from students and faculty."
What is Salamon talking about?
This ad is not being passed around
thecampus. It is being presented to
a select group of students for the
purposes of research. Furthermore,
not a single faculty member has
ever been asked by me to comment
on this advertisement. What is
Salamon talking about? On what
facts does he ground his assumptions?
Thirdly, at the time Salamon
caught a glimpse of the ad, I was in
theprocess of soliciting thereaction
of an Asian-American student.
However, since I did not choose to
ask Salamon's Opinion ofthe ad, in
his article, Salamon jumps to the
conclusion that I had "had enough
input from whites." What is
Salamon talking about? Salamon
Is wrong again!! I need and am
soliciting whitereactions to the ad.

A large portion of my project depends on the compilation of data on
white reactions to the ad. Was it
partially due to the fact that I am an
African-American woman that
Salamon assumed that I had "had
enough white input?" This assumption is extremely racist ofSalamon
who has never once, to this day,
asked me about my project or otherwise spoken to me. I am angry and
deeply resent Salamon's act of taking it upon himself to speak for me.
Who do you think you are,
Salamon? I pose the question: Had
it been a white woman who was
asking an Asian-Americanstudent's
response to an ad, would Salamon
have assumed that that woman had
"had enough white input?" I think
not!!! Itis clear to me that Salamon
was assuming that I did not want
whitereaction because I am an African-American woman. Salamon's
assumption is racist.
It would have been another
story had Salamon spoken solely of
the ad in his article. Many of his
observations on the ad itself I find
extremely interesting. In fact, the
parts of his article where he speaks
solely about the ad highlight my
own reservations about thead. However, he crosses the line by characterizing my project and me. In the
future, Salamon, try thinking before

College Research
Worth Its Salt
by ROBERT D. HONIGMAN
There's an old joke about a
man who walks into a neighborhood grocery store, and he sees
row after row of salt. There are
shakers of salt, blocks of salt, bags
of salty and boxes of salt. "Boy,
you must sell a lot of salt," the man
says to the grocer. "No," the grocer
replies. "I don't. But the guy who
sells me salt. Boy, can he sell salt."
Similarly, in the university,
there is row after row of research,
blocks ofresearch, bags of research,
boxes ofresearch.But if you asked
the average student whether they
used all this research, they 'd probably say no. "But the guy who sells
us research. Boy, can he sell research."
So the question is, why does
modern
university produce so
the
much research? Is it because the
faculty and officials are expert
salespeople?Or is there some other
reason?
Research does produce new
wealth. It's a capital forming enterprise, so up to a point there is a
value in investing in research. But
why doesthe university seem to go
so much farther beyond that point?
Why does it overproduce research,
and why—since it'salso an educational institution, does it neglect
education in favor of research?
The answer goes back in part
to the nineteenth century when
American faculty were exploited
as were teachers and guardians of
college students. They envied the
Germanfaculty whohad organized
into research guilds, and who, by
virtue of monopolizing certain
fields ofknowledge, enjoyed high
incomes and corresponding social
status. When the American faculty
organized themselves into research
guilds following the German
model, they increased their social
power and prestige enormously.
From being mere servants of university presidents, underpaid and
exploited, they became the univer-

sity.

But it's not hard to see the
self-interest of the faculty in their
allegiance to research. But still,
they can say, "Look, if we didn't
do research, our prestige would
fall; students wouldn't enroll in

our campus; and we'd lose public
support. Therefore, we are responding to public demand for research
universities."
The weakness of this argument is that: first of all, it's not
very glamorous. It makes the faculty into entrepreneurs, out to make
a buck like everyone else. More
importantly, it's a self-deceiving
sort of argument. It's similar to
what the car companies used to say
in the early sixties when they resisted safety devices. They argued
that the public wouldn't spend
moneyfor safety glass, collapsible
steering wheels, and padded dashboards. What they forgot was that
they were spending enormous sums
to advertise the glamor and thrills
of automobiles. If they had spent
equal sums informing the public of
the horror of auto accidents—showing people withmashed faces
and broken limbs—safety would
have sold. Similarly, the modem
university advertises the glamor of
research. It minimizes and hides
itseducational poverty. Moreover,
it forgets that its very defense of
"We are only responding to public
demand," implies that the consumer is king. The great German
universities paid their professors
by the number of students who
enrolled in their lectures. Thus,
they had an interest in making their
research accessible and interesting
to students. The American university insulates its faculty from students and lets them do research on
the remote frontiers of knowledge—the more obscure and unintelligible the better. But that's the
point of guild organizations—to
monopolize knowledge and sell it
as dearly as possible in the market-

place.
The research glamor of the
American university masks a deepening inner poverty. Everyone
needs salt—there's no question
about it. But the price of salt and
the amount we buy—that's negotiable.

Clinton Calls for Service
By BILL CLINTON
I write to challenge you to join
me in a great Americanadventure—national service.
I make this challenge because
our country and our communities
need help that government alone
cannot provide. Government can
make vaccines available to children, but alone it cannot administer
shots to them at all. It can put more
police on the streets, but alone it
cannot stop crime. It can improve
the quality of our public schools,
but cannot alone inspire children to
live up to their potential.
It is time for Americans of every background to work together to
lift our country up, neighborhood
by neighborhood and block by
block. It is time to rediscover the
excitement and idealismthat makes
us Americans.
Thatis what nationalservice is
all about.
Through nationalservice, thousands will have the opportunity to

will take time for theseideas to pass

Thatis why I have called for a
Summer of Service— this summer.
More than 1,000young people will
serve in selected areas around the
country, learning to lead and getting
children who are at risk ready for

There are many who believe
that young Americans will not answer a call to action. They say you
are apathetic, and insist that you

they are wrong, and I know you will

You can become an agent of

THE PHOENIX OPINIONS MARCH 19,1993

"Rambling" Attack on Fulani Displays Faulty Reasoning
To the Editor:
I am shocked by Dan Oppenheim's commentary on Lenora Fulani's visit to
Swarthmore. His points aren't expressed
well at all. He attempts to be a critical thinker,
yet he fails miserably because he refuses to
analyze his sources of information and he is
contradictory. Also, he seems to have missed
the ideas Fulani presented. This is not an
intelligentpiece of opinion writing.
Dan begins the article by associating
Fulani withFred Newman, the founder of the
New Alliance Party, "a party that thrives on
deception and warped social theories." First
of all, I thought the article was about Fulani's
visit to Swarthmore College. By talking about
Newman instead ofFulani, Dan is distracting
thereaders from thereal issues at hand. Second, I am having difficulty in understanding
Dan's point about Newman's Psychological
theories. Dan states:"[Newman's] therapy
centers, which treat many Medicaidand Medicare patients, stress the social origins of emotional illness."Dan is unclear as to how this is
a warped social theory. In addition, the United
States of America is a warped social theory in
itself. The US thrives off of racism.
Dan then goes on to discuss Fulani's
opinions regarding the "present system of
race relations and the system of justice." Dan
goes on to say, "Fulani proffers many harsh
criticisms of our society, but offers no real
solutions." A politician, or any educated
person should be critical of the society one
lives in. Out of critique comes change and
progress. In terms of solutions, racism is so
ingrained in our society, a "real" solution is
not possible at this time. Fulani did not
profess to have all the answers to solve all our
problems, anyhow.
As far as the Reginald Denny beating

King beating also need to be addressed. First
of all, if themedia isn't biased against minorities, why is it that one can count on one's
hands consistent positive images of people of
color? The media has planted in every one of
our minds that "white is right." At the very
least that is bias, if not racism. Second, the
media was not sympathetic to Rodney King.
To reiterate Fulani's statement, every time
the Rodney King tape was shown, theReginald
Denny tape followed. This is a perfect tool to
soothe the conscience of white middle-class
America. It's like an eye for an eye. But
MartinLuther King was correct in saying that
mentality leaves a nation of blind people.
Americans are blind to the realities of racism
in this country. Third, Dan claims the networks didn't show the tape in its entirety.
How does Dan know the tape was shown
fully? He knows because he saw the whole
thing. Where did he get such privileged
information? He got it from the networks. I
have a major problem with being critical of
the media, yet using the media as your source
ofinformation.This is yet another example of
how Dan haphazardly explains his point of
view. Fourth, I'dlike to agree with Dan about
the beating being "a black and white issue."
The issue is much larger than that.
I am tempted to say, "Completely disregard this cluelessness." However, we should
be paying close attention. Dan isn't the only
one that uses this logic, although this example
is poorly expressed. Beware, Swarthmore
students. He doesn't realize black people
have had a hard lot. But in general, we don't
take slavery seriously enough. We don't take
the government sanctioned murders of MartinLuther King, Jr. and Malcolm X seriously
enough. We don't take seriously thefact there
on the media and the are political prisoners in the United States of
America (land of the free). We don't take
seriously the fact that black people still have
to struggle to be recognized as valuable, fullfledged members of thehuman race. Don't let
Swarthmore abstract these things. Let's have
some respect for human life and experience.
We need to take the implications of the beating of a black man very seriously. Had
George Holiday not been there, Rodney King
would have been "just another nigger."
When Dan finally returns to Lenora
Fulani he seems to have missed her point.
Dan feels, "The 1992 election is not signifi-

went, Fulani stated the young men who beat

Reginald Denny should go unpunished. It
seems Dan does not understand this sort of
logic since he states, "...isn't it ludicrous to
suggest that some types of violence and lawbreaking behavior are allowable?" After a
whole group of people has been beaten for
400 years, the group is going to want to beat
back. This is not to say violence is the best
method, but when one feels powerless, what
is else is there? to answer Dan's question;
YES, IT IS LUDICROUS TO SUGGEST
THAT SOME TYPES OF VIOLENCE AND
LAW-BREAKING BEHAVIOR ARE ALLOWABLE. Yet, isn't it also ridiculous that
four police officers can beat one man (violence) and twelve other police officers can
stand around and watch (law-breaking behavior)? Isn't it insane that all police officers
went unpunished?
The prime example of Dan's failure in
critical thinking is the paragraph about the
media and the Rodney King beating and trial.
According to Dan, "Fulani spoke despairingly of the 'racist media' in this country and
claims that'Rodney King was therule and not
the exception.'" This whole paragraph is
rambling in style. Once again, Dan strays
from his main topic, Fulani. From this
opening sentence one thinks he is going to
address what Fulani said about Rodney King.
Instead, Dan talks about the media being
sensational and sympathetic to Rodney King.
He doesn't touch on the habitual excessive
force by police at all. Not only doeshe break
away from Fulani, he breaks away from the
subject of the media in mid-paragraph. He
starts talking about the issue of race in the
beating of Rodney King and the subsequent
trial.

stantial portions of the vote, but rather it is
because Perot was able to secure the large
portion of the vote as a third party candidate."
Fulani never said the New Alliance Party is
the new American political party. She expressed excitement about the amount of votes
received by Perot. She said this indicates the
American people are tired ofbeing limited in
political decisions. She said the significance
of the '92 election was that the people spoke
up. Dan goes on to say, "Fulani noted the way
in which our electoral system is working is
undemocratic, and she presented ideas that
were introducedmany decades ago." Is this to
say that because an idea has been brought up
before, it is invalid? This is not a very good
argument. He somewhatredeems himself in
actually criticizing an actual idea. He says in
regard to a week long voting period, "In this
country with the frequency of exit polls the
outcome would be known throughout the
nation days before the finish of the voting."
To refute that argument, it lawmakers were
serious about making the elections fair, the
media would not be involved with the elections until the very end of the election period.
In his conclusion, Dan is very critical of
Fulani. He believes, "It is timefor her to stop
complaining about the system and it is time
for her to try achieving her goals by working
within the system." I am not sure if Dan was
present at the Fulani talk, because he has no
idea whatFulani's goals are. Fulani wants to
take back democracy from Washington, the
media, and interest groups and give it back to
the people. How she is achieving those goals
is to run for president of the US and present a
differentway of seeing politics. Ifrunning as
a candidate for United States President in all
fifty states isn't in the system, then what is? Is
it being a Democrat or a Republican? Is it
being an out of touch politician? Lenora
Fulani has done something many of us hear
wouldn't dream of doing. She neither vents
her frustrations with the political system on
Parrish walls, nor does she write a book for a
poli-sci class, nor does she stay silent. She is
out in the real world; she is fighting for what
she believes in a vocal and active way.
Whether or not you agree with Fulani, wecan
all learn from her initiative.
Sincerely,
PATRICE BONE

Environment May Be One Middle
East Dilemma With a Solution
by STACY NAKELL
Last year I had the pleasure of
hearing Alon Tal, one of Israel's
top environmental lawyers, speak
on the issues confronting Israel's
land. In a region where the land
holds the history of ancient footsteps, whereall Israeli children take
hiking trips
each year of
school
to
"discover the
land through
their feet",
where land
and environmental issues
form the crux
of heated debates, a discussion of the land answered many
questions I had about the issues
facing the Middle East. On the
evening of Thursday, March 18, I
was able to hear him speak again, as
heincludedSwarthmore on a trip as
a environmental ambassador, and
his talk held prospects of hope for
the region.
Tal began his speech with a
fitting joke about Moses telling Gdthat He had to deal with the environmentalists who were sure to be
up in arms if Moses parted the Red
Sea. This joke summed up the important relationship between the
environment and the problems in
the Middle East that were the main
focus of the talk.
Tal described the various problems facing resources in the Middle
East, including pollution ofthe Gulf
>

ofAqaba, sewage dumping by Lebanon in the Mediterranean Sea, expansion of deserts, air pollution, and
water shortages.

Because these problems are
shared by all areas in the region,
they must work together in order to
solve them. Tal sees great hope for

ued in discussions about the env
the multilateral talk
which will continue in April, an<
the coordination of Non Govern
ment Organizations from all area
of the Middle East in producing
plan of cooperation to handle th
problems in the Gulf of Aqaba.
Tal pro
vided concret
possibilities for
facilitating the
process to combine environmental efforts.
These included
focusing on one
issue such as providing education
for tourists on
how to avoid destroying coral in the
Gulf of Aqaba, and solving each
issue before moving on.
In addition, he stressed theneed
for the groups not to look at how t
split up the existing resources.anc
bicker over issues such as the rights
to the Kinneret water source whic
lies both in pre-1967 Israel and in
the West Bank, but how to use meth
ods such as desalinizationand recy
cling sewage to increase the re
sources available to all.
With such a positive outloo
on the potential for working to
gether on the environment, Tal pro
vided hope thatthe groups can wor
out their problems. A cooperatio
on the environment would increase
trust between the countries, an<
could provide the first step toward
peace in the Middle East.

One third of the coral in the

Committee Launches
CA Recruiting Drive
by MEGAN SMITH
Orientation 1993. It's closer
than you think. As the Admissions
Office prepares to send letters of
acceptance to anxious high school
seniors, we here at Swat begin to
think about the class of '97. On
August 28, approximately 410 new
students will
arrive on cam- |
pus. Theirfirst
impressions,
indeed their
impressions of
Swarthmore
for the next
four years, will
be based on
that first week,
known as Orientation. In '
order to make
Orientation '93 a success, the whole
campus must get involved.
The Orientation Committee
will be led by four creative, energetic, masochistic members of the
class of'96: Angela Mrema, Derek
Lumpkins, Megan Smith, and Will
Craig. They have ideas to make
next year's orientation even better
and are looking for more. All these
ideas, of course, need people behind them. This is yourchance to be
part of the most thrilling orientation
ever. It's your opportunity to get
involved in the most creative, dynamic, and exciting group on
campus...the Orientation Committee!
Perhaps you've seen our signs
aroundcampus. We'dliketoelaborate on those incredible, astonishing benefits of becoming a revered
CA (campus advisor) for next year.
You all know, of course, about the
sensational monetary perks and enviable advantage of an extra week
of Sharpies food. You get paid
nothing and will start losing weight
and calling Renato's sooner. You

get to explore new territory and expand your own horizons, seeing parts
of campus you never saw before.
As you wander, your assigned
groupies will follow you wid- eyed,
making you the envy of all the lame
people without CA groups.
The freshpeople will take in
every wordyou

say and write it
to their parents,
securing your
place in the
family mytholWho
ogy.
wouldn't want
to become a
demi-god?You
will be an authority on such
major campus
issues as the
best time to go to Sharpies (if there
is one), the most effective way to
ask a professor for an extension (an
invaluable skill), and the actual
height of Al Bloom. Your warnings
about registration and the swim test
will give themnightmares for weeks.
Or at least for that first, long one.
By the time Orientation is over, you
will know all the versions of the
name game and still forget
everyone's name. But you will get
to live knowing that you made a
difference in the life of a poor, pathetic, and disorientedfrosh. Most
importantly, you will have a nifty tshirt to remember it all by.
So, we plastered the campus
with our signs. We wrote an article
for the Phoenix (you're reading it
now) and we put the applications in
the Dean's office. There may even
be an all-campus e-mailing (we
apologize in advance). What more
can we do?
Now it's up to you. Pick up an
application, take a few minutes to
fill it out, and return it by the 26th.
This is your chance.

As you wander,
your assigned
groupies will
follow you wideeyed.

the possibility of cooperation about
the environment even in a region
where the parties are rarely willing
to work together. Because the problems are so severe, reaching a point
where one third of the coral in the
Gulf of Aqaba is gone, tourism is
decreasing due to a shortage of clean
water in some areas, and many species of fish are now extinct in the
Middle East, the countries which
are enemies in so many areas have
no choice but to try to solve the
problems. This process must involve cooperation, and all parties
recognize this need.
Tal pointed out the progress in
this effort in cooperation. This
progress began at the 1973
Barcelona convention where Arabs
and Israelis actually sat together to
discuss the environment. It contin-

Shapcott's Electroplating the
Baby Uses Shocking Imagery

Literary
Fetish

by MARY HELEN DUPREE
A few weeks ago, the College
Bookstore had a sale on theirpoetry
books (all two shelves of them).
Accordingly, this week'sFetish reviews works by two contemporary
poets: Electroplating the Baby, a
recent firstcollectionby JoShapcott,
a British poet, and "On the Pulse of
Morning" by the African-American
poet Maya Angelou, which was read
at President Clinton's inauguration.
To begin with Shapcott, the
poems in Electroplating the Baby
could be described as still-lifes, full
of arresting, often grotesque images. They capture awkward, revelatory moments in the inner life, as
when a child urinates on herself at
her seventh birthday party
(**' Power!'l'wasthinking JA puddle
on the rug!" 1 ). Although some of
Shapcott's poems explore sexual
politics, her work is far more introspective than political.
Many things about Electroplating the Baby make me glad I'drisked
the $lO.OO on it. Using the rhythm
and vocabulary of ordinary speech,

the reader deeply.
Shapcott could take a few lessons in depth of feeling from Maya

Angelou's Inaugural Poem Renews Spirit and Optimism
Shapcott's lean, elegant poems
evoke vivid images. In a cycle of
short poems, "Gleanings of the
Globe," Shapcott depicts life as we
really see it, in detached glimpses:
"The condor, when rising/from the
earth, always describes/circles in
the air, and can rise in no other

issue for some of y 'all. This movie
is basically an existentialist ploy to
infiltrate the collective consciousness of the electoral population, or
what is perceived to be the electoral
population from the perspective of
the great teeming masses of pedestrian pollers, and to simultaneously
subvert the virtuous, if sometimes
loquacious, politicos into vile and
pernicious acts oftruly heinous proportions.
Paul: To quote a wise man, "Are
you on crack?"™
James: Paul with the pharmacological answer truly exemplifies the
genre 0f...
Paul: Hey, I've never done genre,
fugger.
James: Exactly.
Paul: Hey, I don't have to talk to
you, jerkie.
James: That's my line.
Paul: Hey, Eric do you have anything intelligent to say?
Eric: Yeah, I do. CooL.what?
James: Maybe, you should take a
break from Engine Lab, dude.
Paul: Anyway, I'd definitely go
Friday. As a matter of fact, I am
going. And as for Saturday's option, that's up to you. I'm going to
be locked up in some room with a
keg.
James: Well, maybe after I've had
my thirteen beers, I'll be ready for a
little movie action. Think I can do
that in one hour so I can see the
movie?
Paul: Only if you want to see the
movie through white porcelain
glasses.
James: Yeah, maybel'll see Brazil
Friday, too. If you see me at Bob
Roberts though, don't sit in front of
me.
Paul: Yeah, I guess that goes for me
too. I give Brazil the trippy-movieI-wouldn't-go-tripping-to award of
the week.
James: Yeah, two trippy-movie-Iwouldn't-go-tripping-to's up™.

Poet Klepfisz to Speak at Swat
by AMANDA ROCQUE
In 1943, when she was just a
baby, Irena Klepfisz and her mother
escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto,
where the Nazis had already imprisoned more than half a million Jews.
Because her mother had blue eyes
and spoke Polish, the two were able
tp pass themselves off as Polish
peasants. Hiding out until theend of
the war, the Klepfiszes eventually
emigrated to the United States in
1949.
Since moving to the U.S.,
Klepfisz has worked to become a
widely acclaimed writer, was recently namedthe 1993Hillel Artist
in Residence, and has received several poetry grants from theNational
Endowment of the Arts. Besides
serving as a co-editor of a Jewish
woman's handbook on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, she has published two literary collections enlillcdDreams ofanInsomniac Jewish Feminist Essays, Speeches and
Diatribes and A Few Words in the
Mother Tongue:PoemsSelectedand
New.
She is a vocal activist in the
lesbian community and was one of
the founders of Conditions, a feminist magazine that features lesbian
writing. Klepfisz has also written
several essays thataddress the combined problems ofanti-Semitism and
homophobia, which exclude Jewish lesbians from the women's
movement

Most of the autobiographical
poems and essays featured in her
books center on modern Judaism,
gender awareness, and sexual preference. Moreover, because she has

Next on the list is senior Jeff
Moray, former high-school football
and rugby player who never quite
made the cross-over to theless contact-oriented world of squash. Jeff
was voted Most Likely to Bleed or

season. In post-season play, Jeff
continued his fine tradition by first
hitting his opponent at George
Washington University, then splitting open his knee and bleeding
profusely. At the next point, Jeff
proceeded toperform surgery on his
knee, pulling away dead folds of
skin. Jeff's bloodthirstiness, his
willingess to be martyred, and his
total disregard for the other player

see the long lines at the copier machine as people busy themselves

There you have it now I'll
explain. I think that Kentucky, with
Jamal Mashburn and Travis Ford
and the brilliant coaching of Rick
Pitino, has to be included in
anybody's Final Four. The same
can be said for Michigan and North
Carolina. As for Louisville, they've
been streaking at the endof the year
and they have three players, Greg
Minor, Dwayne Morton, and Cliff
Rozier, who are all capable of picking this team up and carrying it to
the Final Four. I also am very hesitant to pick either Indiana, Kansas,
or Duke to go to the Final Four, so
the Cardinals win in a process of
elimination.
My championship game is a
rematch of a December game that
the Wolverines won on a last second tip-in by Jalen Rose. They
should win again. NorthCarolina is
a great team. Their starting five of
Montross, Lynch, Reese, Williams,
and Phelps are as good as they come
and even their bench players like
Sullivan, Rodl, and Salvadori are
good.
However, I feel that Michigan
is the best team in the country, and
if they decide they want to win the
tournament, they will. All season
long, it seems that the Wolverines
have been just waiting for the tournament so theycan avenge last year's
loss in the final to Duke. After all,
if they win this year, Webber and
Rose can go pro early knowing
they've achieved the ultimate at the
college level. But don't think
Webber and Rose are the ones who
will be doing all of the work: postman Juwan Howard and shootingace JimmyKing will pick up their

Worst of all, the men were behind
Widener. A little dejected, we were
re-inspired by the realization that in
the next two days we could really
turn it on doing what we are good at,
200s and stroke events.
The second day began the
drama. Jessica Walker displayed
unrivaled fortitude by swimming
two finals within 10minutes ofeach
other and doing well in both, especially with a secondplace in the 100
fly. Her sub-2 minute 200 free also
set the college record.
Skye
Fulkerson finished perfectly to
snatch second in the 100 breast.
Kate Moran, on a half season of
work placed third in the 100 back
and set herself on course to realize
her Nationals potential once again.
The tandem ofMariaKaufman and
Khris Schaffner swam fabulous
400IMs (the second toughest race in
swimming), both making finals.
The men were emotionally led
by the ever-present Eric McCrath.
In the heats of the 100 breast he got
the fastest time overall. Bill Raich
pulled his way into top 16 with his
first ever 1.03(.99). Kendrew Witt
quietly slipped into the finals along
with McCrath. Jason Greenwood
made finals in the 400IM as did the
Kelehers in the 100fly. Iggy swam
a strangely effective 100fly, making consoles.
The race of the day had to be
the finals of the 100breast. McCrath

Dickinson College was the
venue for the climactic meet of the
year. The men arrived with a dual
meet record of 8-3 and the women
with the slightly better 9-3. Any
goodbookie wouldhaveranked our
women at third and the men were
probably as low as fifth. This was
simply drama in the making.
The first day of competition is
traditionally the worst for
Swarthmore Swimming. Between
the 500 free and the 50, we get a
little outclassed. The best swims

Although the men's lacrosse
season has begun in depressing fashion with the postponement of four
games, the team is looking forward
to more success in the MAC Conference than a year ago. Having
finished 5-10 last season underhead
coach Jim Noyes' first year back,
the team returns with seven members from last year's starting lineup,
who will be joined by experienced
reserves and new faces.
Among the returning starters
are senior tri-captainsKevin Bewley
(midfield), Greg Ferguson (attack),
and Ned Southworth (midfield).
Sandy Watkins '93, a last year all
MAC player, and Kirk Ramer '93,
who returns to Swat lax after a year
abroad, join the three captains in
providing experience for the team.

the number three ranked team in
Division ID, defeated Swat in three

Swarthmore held the lead, and in

Mary Invitational. The beginners
got to see the sport they have been
learning to play all winter for the
first time. Although missing the
guidance of senior captains and
veterans Hadley Wilson '93 and
Kate Winkler '93, the team did
extremely well in their scrimmages
in the tournament.
They tied Georgetown 4-4, a
tough Division HI school, in addition
to only losing to Roanoke (who is
ranked 2nd in the nation in Division
III) by three. They also held their
own against Hofstra and William
and Mary's B squad, two tough Division I schools.
