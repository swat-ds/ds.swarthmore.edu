Witness to terror
Alumna: 'We saw people running
and screaming. Then we looked up.'
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
Gregg Davis 'BO was not at work on the morning of Sept. 1L That
turned out to be lucky.
Davis works for the Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon.
Usually, he occupies his office in an area of the building that is adjacent
to the section of the Pentagon destroyed at around 9:45 a.m. that morning.
At that fateful moment, Davis was nowhere near the impact site. "I
was on the other side of the Pentagon at the time," he said. "I was actually in the dental clinic."
Davis is one of the many Swarthmore graduates who have sent a message to the alumni relations office over the past two weeks to confirm their
safety after the attacks. But these simple messages did not begin to reach
the emotional depths of the stories many alums have to tell.

Borough police responded on Sunday morning to a noise complaint at Olde Club. Before they left, the
concert was halted. A band member was cited, and Andrew Szafran arrested, for disorderly conduct.

police officers standing outside
the door," he said.
"Before anyone went in,"
Redgrave said, "a party associate
came out." The officers told the
party host and manager of Olde
Club, Priti Batta 'O2, that she

needed to lower the volume.
"There were three bands
playing that night," Batta said,
and "during the last band's set,
about two songs into their set,
some cops came, and I went outside."
Batta said there were several
police officers there, and "they
seemed to be telling me different
things," she said. "One said turn
it down, one said just close the
door. I was kind of confused."
"From talking to [my own]

officers," Craig said, "things

were quiet when they arrived.
They told them they had gotten a
complaint, and that it had to
remain quiet. As they were leaving, the band began playing
again, and things deteriorated."
"That's entirely false," Batta
said. "It was during the band's
set that someone in the audience
tapped me on the shoulder. I didn't hear him at first because it
was too loud." Redgrave also
said that the band had been playing when public safety officers
arrived.
Batta spoke with sound engineer Erik Osheim 'O3 and told
him to lower the volume. "I
turned down the vocals and the

drums," Osheim said. "But it
was up to the band to turn down
the amps." Because the band,
The Convocation Of, had not
been using Olde Club's sound
system for their other instruments, the sound level could not
be controlled from Osheim's
position.
"I went back to the cops, and
asked if I could just close the
door," Batta said. "I'm pretty
sure they said it was OK. A
minute later, the cops started
coming in again, and said,
'You've got to turn it down.'
"Our officers went inside and
tried to speak to the band,"
Redgrave said. Craig said public
safety was unable to convince
them to lower their volume after
"

"several attempts."

The college's response
Many alumni live in the regions of the attacks. According to alumni relations office statistics, 2,613 live in the New York metropolitan
area, 1,690 in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore area, and 190 in the
Pittsburgh area. As the dust settled, the alumni office tried to piece
together information on how this tragedy had affected former
Swarthmore students.
Lucy Lee 'BL director of alumni relations, said the office "sent an email to all of the alums for whom we had addresses so they could start
checking in with us and with each other through the college's online
community."

As of Tuesday afternoon, the alumni relations office had received 190
messages, according to Lee. "It has been very gratifying to see the number of alumni who have reached out to each other and to us to say that
it's really nice and comforting to hear from the Swarthmore community
at this time," she said.
These e-mails tell Lee the identity of those who survived the destruction. What they do not tell her are their stories.
'Shock and disbelief
Brad Skillman 'B9, who lives in Brooklyn Heights, witnessedthe attacks
from the Brooklyn Bridge. Skillman said that he was doing a late-morning
workout on the bridge when something caught his attention. "Out of the
corner of my eye, I saw a low-flying plane over Manhattan," he said. "At
first, I did not expect anything to happen. But then I did a double take and
watched the plane plow into the North Tower."
Skillman, a reporter for the Associated Press, quickly sprang into
action. He started interviewing people who had been watching from
the bridge. "I was talking to a man who had seen the plane flying in
from further away," he said. "The man pointed and said, 'lt was just
like that one.'
As Skillman and the people around him watched in what Skillman
described as "shock and disbelief," the second plane flew into the corner of the South Tower. "At this point, even before the towers collapsed,
we realized that life as we knew it had just changed," he said.
Hilary Brest Meltzer 'B6, who works a block away from the World
Trade Center in a room that faced the North Tower, was in her office
when the first plane hit. "At first, we did not really understand what
was happening," she said. "Looking down, we saw people running and
screaming. And then we looked up."
Meltzer did not understand what she was seeing. "It was not very
coherent," she said. "I saw a lot of smoke. I saw a tear in the aluminum of
the tower. It was strange to see a disruption in the pattern of the tower."
At around 9:15 a.m., Meltzer and her colleagues were instructed to
evacuate the building and leave the area. "When we got downstairs,
policemen were directing us north. I started walking home," she
said. "I was at NYU when I heard people screaming that the buildings
were collapsing. I was frozen; I couldn't bring myself to turn around
and look."
Unlike Meltzer, Rob Steelman '92 did see the Twin Towers collapse.
He was standing less than a quarter of a mile away when the buildings
came crashing down. Steelman said that he was on the subway heading
to a meeting at the World Trade Center when news of the crashes filtered down to him. When the passengers left the train at a subway station four blocks away from the site, they had a clear view of the towers,
according to Steelman.
"It was worse than I could possibly have imagined," he said. "I saw
bodies falling out of windows; I saw flames seven to ten stories above
the hole in the tower. It was like a bad Hollywood movie."
Steelman eventually started making his way uptown. A few minutes
later, he heard what he called 'a terrified scream
a sound I will never get
out of my head."

Swarthmore, along with 140 colleges and universities nationwide, held a peace rally.
As a drizzling rain fell on the
crowd in front of Parrish at noon,
three professors, an alumna and a

handful of students took the
microphone to advocate a nonviolent solution to the events of Sept.
1L The speakers warned against
vengeful rhetoric. They sought
causes for anger that would
prompt such attacks, describing
the negative impact American
politics and economics have on
the rest of the world. They also
called for action in the form of
presenting Congress with alternative views.
Toward the end of the rally, a
handful of students articulated
the other side of the dialogue by
proposing retaliation against the
perpetrators and the military
destruction of terrorist regimes.

America has developed as it continues to mourn the thousands of

victims from the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.
But the peace rally here took a
decidedly different look at national affairs. In a press release, the
organizers of the Swarthmore
event described it as "a coordinated effort to draw attention to
alternatives to acts of war and
massive retaliation advocated by
the U.S. government," which they
believe will "result in more innocent deaths while actually undermining U.S. security interests by
broadening support for extremist
groups."

Several local and national pub-

the Associated Press and columnist Gil Spencer of The Delaware

those speakers who warned
against global capitalism in the
same category with "backward

referred to most of the open mic
speakers as "a parade of Blame

"If we can understand who we

Coed rooming successful but sophomores say market too tight
BY BETH REDDEN
In response to a student campaign for
coed housing options last year, deans and
the housing committee allowed students to
pick into a limited number of coed rooms
in the spring lottery. As students adjust to
their personal living arrangements, many
of them are experiencing coed rooming for
the first time. Swarthmore's decision to
implement coed rooming has placed it into
a small group of schools that offer this
option to students, including Haverford,
Hampshire and Wesleyan.
Noteworthy as thedecision may have been,
coed rooming has not been without complications. Many of the students who originally
requested coed rooming were not accommodated. The restriction of coed housing options to
the Lodges and sections I and Jof Worth severely limited the number ofstudents who could live
in coed housing, which posed a particular problem for sophomores. They rarely have high

enough housing lottery numbers to live in
Worth, leaving themthe Lodges as the only coed
option.
Shawn Kyzer 'O4 is one of these sophomores. His request for coed housing, which
he had hoped would allow him to live with
a female friend in Worth, was denied. He
explained that, once he had averaged their
two lottery numbers, he realized it would
be "impossible to get a double in Worth

with that kind of number."
Louisa Strouse Boiman 'O3 echoed Kyzer's
sentiments. She said she wanted to live with a
malefriend in Worth, but thatlow lottery numbers left her with a single in Mary Lyon instead.

SEPTEMBER 27, 2001

Boiman, who said she "just wants to be comfortable with the person [she's] living with,"was
disappointed with theresult and expressed hope
for greater coed housing options next school
year.
Myrt Westphal, headof the housing committee and director of residential life, said the needs
of those requesting coed housing had to be balanced with those ofother students. Therefore,
many of the rooms originally available for coed
housing were instead filled with single-sex
groups with better lottery numbers.
Approximately 50 coed housing spots were
granted to single-sex groups, leaving only 11 students in coed housing. Yet Westphal saidthis situation was not unusual or atypical, as "not
everybody, particularly sophomores, will be
able to get the room they want."
In addition, Westphal explained, the
coed housing situation was particularly
complex because students "only wanted to
live with their friends." Although Westphal
sympathized with these students, she said
the situation was not an easy one.
It was difficult to find students willing
to live with a coed group they did not know
well. "The last two empty beds this summer were in coed housing," Westphal said.
Added to this fall's already tight housing
situation, this factor was especially frustrating for the administration.

The history of coed rooming
The housing committee approved coed
rooming last semester after they received
what Westphal called "a very reasoned and
well thought-out proposal" from Tim
Stewart-Winter 'OL Upon consideration of

THE PHOENIX

the proposal, the housing committee and

the deans approved coed rooming for the
Lodges and sections I and J of Worth.

David Conners 'O3 said the main objective behind the proposal was to secure "the
comfort of queer students." Conners, a
transfer student who is living in a coed
lodge this year, explained that, while serving as a residential assistant at Drexel, he
witnessed firsthand discrimination that
arose from feelings of homophobia.
Conners said he discovered "one of the
largest sources of stress [for queer students] is to be placed with a roommate that
is homophobic." It is beneficial, he thinks,
for queer students to have a living option
in which neither homophobia nor attraction would be likely to affect roommate
relationships.
But it is not only queer students who
are able to take advantage of the coed housing alternative. Alison Landrey 'O4, who is
living in a coed lodge this year, said that
she requested coed housing mainly
because she wanted to live with four of her

friends from her freshman hall, one of
whom happened to be Conners. Landrey
said her living situation is working "really

well."
"I don't think too much about having a
boy roommate," Landrey said. "It seems
normal to me."
The bigger picture
Despite the various setbacks experienced this year, the institution of coed
housing seems to be almost a non-issue on
campus. Westphal believes that this is

because the policy was "limited in scope,"
and that, for most students, "it doesn't

impact them at all."
Olivia Toro 'O5 agreed. "I wouldn'tfeel comfortable doing it but I think people should have
that option," she said.
Toro is not the only student who feels
this way. At least part of the student body
has been very receptive to the new policy.
Over 300 students signed a petition in support of coed housing last semester.
"Throughout last year, we heard nothing but support from the student body,"

Conners said. "No individuals or groups
voiced any opposition to the coed rooming

proposal."
In contrast, opposition to the policy has
come from off campus. A few alumni have
written the college to express their disapproval, and the Aug. 3 issue of Culture
Facts, the publication of the Family

Research

Council,

condemned

Swarthmore's decision to implement

coed

housing as "an example of political correctness run amok, and
another regrettable
example of a college abandoning $
...

Christian roots."
Nevertheless, Conners remains optimistic about the possibility of expanding
coed housing next year, to be decided when
the housing committee and the deans meet
early next semester.

But while still focused on Swarthmore's
situation, Conners said he couldn't help
but hope the initiative will encourage
other schools to adopt similar policies in
the future. "I definitely have my sights set

on the bigger picture," he said.

Perennially low turnout marks SC elections

After a year of improvements, co-presidents look to further increase credibility with student body
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
After marked improvements in the student body's interest in Student Council last
year, voter turnout fell while results showed
increased apathy among voting students in
last week's election for campus life representative.
The number of students who voted in the
election totaled 605, a significant drop from
last December's count of 682. And 15.2 percent of voting students voted for "no preference," "none of the above" or "Lamb Chop."
Last December, 9.6 percent neglected to
vote for an official candidate, and in

September of 2000 only 2.8 percent did.
Chirag Chotalia 'O4 won last week's election with 49.5 percent of the vote.
The increase in apathy comes, paradoxically, at a moment when the council is making a transition to a more populist and
accessible structure. A new constitution,
approved last December, provided for the
direct election of council co-chairs, whom
the council members had previously elected, and revamped committee responsibilities with the aim of making specialized positions more understandable to the student
"body.
The changes aimed to reduce the focus
on positions and to provide for a council
thatwould work together on issues, co-chair
Anna Woodiwiss 'O2 said. "I don't think it's
so important that the campus realizes that
we have those special functions," she said.
Indeed, the challenge lies not in having
students understand how the positions are
structured but in getting them to care in the
first place.
"I don't really feel like [council members] do anything important," said Hunter
Wells 'O2, who did not vote in last week's
election. Other students expressed similar
sentiments: they don't see the council effecting major changes, or they don't believe it
has the power to do so.

rl e Ville,"
CTtne new "Ville Discount Cards."

While most students remain skeptical about the impact
of the new "Ville Discount Card" on student-borough relations, merchants are optimistic, and some say the card has
already brought in a number of new customers from the
college. Although seven of the 26 discounts already existed,
store owners hope that the new card will help to publicize
them to students.
"It's worked out really well," said Scott Richardson of
Occasionally Yours, which offers a free homemade lemonade with any meal when students show their discount card.
"I've had at least 25 people come in and show me the card."
Student Council began the discount card project last
year as a way to increase the college's connection with the
town. The card, which offers various discounts at 26 of the
borough's 41 stores, arrived in mailboxes last Thursday, in
time for last week's "Friday Night in the Ville," an evening
of music, art and shopping until 9 p.m. that drew several
hundred students, according to organizers.
"I don't know if it was more the card or 'Friday Night
in the Ville,' but in any case, we've definitely seen more
students," said Richardson. "We had a group of eight students in here Friday night for dinner, and they used their
cards to get the free lemonade. The next morning, they
stopped by before they went into Philly just to pick up the
lemonade, they liked it so much."
Although the free lemonade is a brand-new offer, many
of the discounts on the card are old news. Previously
existing discounts include the student special at Renato's, 10
percent off sit-down dinners at Cheng Hing, 10 percent off at
the Village Restaurant, 50 percent offall paperbacks at the
Booksource, Ltd. and 15 percent off at the Cheese Court.
"I think it is a joke," said Matt Shiroma 'O5, who said he
felt like merchants were trying to pass old discounts off as

new ones. "I will never shop in the ville."
But most students appreciated the effort, even if they
didn't think it would draw many more students.
"Even though some of the discounts are old, I think
what's cool is that you have all of them compiled on one
card," Emily Tancredi-Brice 'O4 said. "There's a lot of
variety, and the discounts are decent enough, but still,
chances are very high I won't use them."
Nick Topoluk 'O5 doesn't shop in the ville very often,
but said the card could only help the stores. "Any discount
I'm grateful for," he said. "And I like that they're all on one
card. I feel powerful when I have a card in my hand."
Many students were unaware of the preexisting discounts. "I really didn't know about most of them," Tim
Kobyashi 'O4 said. "They're OK discounts. I don't know if I
need a 10 percent discount on rugs or anything, or some of
this other stuff, but maybe."
Store owners point out that they're not looking to completely redefine student-borough relations, only to make
them a little better. "Our hope was just that maybe a few
more students would visit," said Cindy Azzarano of Poco
Loco. "We decided 15 percent would be a nice discount, but
it wouldn't break the bank."
"We've always had a 10 percent discount," said Diana
Carey of the Village Restaurant. "This card is a great
opportunity to publicize the business, because a lot of the
students don't even know about the discount right now.
Hopefully some will stop by and use it."
Most of the merchants said building a better relationship with students wasn't just about business.
"We certainly would welcome more students," said
Elizabeth Kolowrat '56, who works at The Studio, a gift
shop which offers 20 percent off all merchandise. "If anything, just to have them in here and have a discussion and
see what's going on at the college."

Freshmen propel PC popularity upward
The changeover occurred
shortly before Kane joined the ITS

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

PCs predominate as the computers of choice among first-year
students, continuing a strong
trend that existed even before the

college began providing technical
support for PCs three years ago.

"It's been an aggressive change
in the sense that students have
made a very quick turnaround as
far as who is bringing a Mac and
who is bringing a PC," said Steven
Kane, user services coordinator
for Information Technology
Services. "Every year the percentage has been going up."
A net registration survey this
year indicated that at least 800
students use Windows PCs, while
only 288 use Macs. Last year, two
out of three students used a
Windows-based machine.
There are no hard numbers
indicating in which class years
PCs are the most popular, but
there is evidence that, each year,
incoming students push the percentage of PCs on campus ever
higher. Kane guessed that up to 95
percent of the current first-year
class is using PCs.
Andy Reed 'O5 is helping to tip
that precentage even higher by
bringing two PCs with him to campus. "One is a new desktop and the
other is an old laptop. I wanted to
be able to type in class because my
handwriting is awful," he said.
Reed never considered bringing a Mac to campus. "Macs are
extremely fun, but they are
extremely overpriced. They aren't
as cost-effective as PCs," he said.
At many of the computer training sessions held during orientation, only one or two students out
of groups of twenty or more
owned a Mac. Kane said, however, that he expects to see the rate
of change level off in the next few
years because a certain percentage of students will always bring
Macs to campus.
Until three years ago, the college was entirely Mac-based and
did not offer support to PC users.

staff, then known as the computing center. "There was a lot of
pressure to get the campus up to
speed," he said. Since then,
resources for PC users have
become more extensive.
Kane had no concerns about
the current level of support for
students with PCs as opposed to
those with Macs. Configuring a
PC to the network is still more difficult. Orhan Edali 'O4, who owns
a PC, said he had difficulty con-

figuring his computer to the network at the beginning of the
school year.
Viruses are also a more frequent and serious problem for
PCs. "Nobody spends the time to
write a virus for a Mac anymore,"
Kane said.
A major new virus hits campus about every three weeks, and
most are spread through e-mail,
especially by PC users with
Microsoft Outlook Express. Kane
noted although virus protection
software is available to students,
many opt not to use it.
Macs populate most of the public areas, though the college added
a significant number of Windowsbased computers over the summer. Surprisingly, Kane said, the
proportion of Macs to PCs in public areas is a result of student
requests.
Though he is not sure exactly
why this is, he conjectured that,
since a larger percentage of the
faculty use Macs, students may
think certain assignments must be
performed on a Mac.
Faculty are given a chance to
replace their computers every
four years. Any switch in platforms is usually a decision made
by the department. "The faculty
are more reluctant to change than
students," Kane said. "I think
we've already come across as
many faculty as will switch over."
ITS generally attempts to make
all software available for both platforms. Biology, however, is a strict-

ly Mac-based department and
requires the use of some software
only available on a Macintosh.
"I prefer PCs," Matt Miller 'O4
said, "but the programs used in

some of my classes that are
designed for Macs are better, and I
feel there are enough Macs on
campus that if I need one I can
find one."
Like Miller, Toby Sanan 'O3
owns a PC. He said he would like
to see more PCs in public areas.
"The have Macs everywhere
already," he said.
Another change that the net
registration survey highlighted is
the rising number of students
purchasing laptops over desktops.
The price of a laptop is still a pro-

hibitive factor for many students,
but it is becoming less so every
year. At present, 530 students
reported owning laptops, while
780 owned desktops.

Duane Chambers 'OO, technical
assistant for ITS, noted that a
small but prominent number of
students bring machines that
they build themselves. Kane said
dealing with problems such computers have is often "hairy"
because there are no warranties
on these computers and it is difficult to get replacement parts.
Apples and Dells are the two
types of computers that ITS officially supports, though about 500

students have machines that are
neither Apples nor Dells.

ITS personnel is about evenly
split between those who specialize in Macs and those who specialize in PCs. Although that
breakdown does not correspond
to the actual percentage of those
types of machines on campus,
Kane said,, the arrangement
works, and there are no plans to
alter staff specialties.
This year, students serving as
computer consultants in dorms

were trained on both Windows
and Mac systems. Dorm consultants are expected to deal with
most computer problems students
may have, leaving the ITS staff
primarily focused on keeping faculty and staff computers up and
running.

Students, professors rally against national cry for war
From PEACE, pg. 4
Addressing the circumstances that
drove the terrorists to hijack planes and fly
them into the twin towers and Pentagon,
political science professor Jeffrey Murer
warned Americans that they existed
behind a "cloak" of false democracy, denying them the knowledge of "our participation in death squads in Central America
and in coup d'etats in South America.
"We as a culture are culpable of the
process of imperialization," he said, urging
the crowd to fight for the freedom to have a
voice in government policies. "What is it
that we're willing to give up for democracy?"
War, revenge and national honor have
been "the three words that have come up
over and over again" in response to the
attacks, former professor of modern languages and literature Thompson Bradley
said in his speech at the rally. He expressed
anxiety over the ability of that rhetoric to
"incite two of our easiest actions, anger

and self-pity
to come by."

and Godknows they're easy

Bradley designated the attacks as a
crime, not a war, saying that individuals
not states or peoples
were the ones
responsible and should be subject to a
criminal investigation accordingly. He also
expressed concern that American Muslims
and Arabs eire in danger in America" and
urged the crowd to rise against the brewing
racist sentiment.
Kitty Bryant '74 came first to the open
mic, begging the crowd to mobilize against
any United States military action that
would "put its imprint on South Asia." She
compared the potential war to the powerful
influence the America has already exerted
on the people of Iraq. "We don't want the
United States to be the new empire" that
tells people they don't have the right to
their land, their oil or their culture, she
explained. "It was campuses like this and
what people did here" that ended the
Vietnam War when she was a Swarthmore
student, Bryant said.

'

A collection of students then spoke on
topics ranging from holding discussions

about the national situation in local
schools to the need for American Arabs to
hide their identities.
Danny Loss 'O4 warned that "violence
begets violence," a cycle that must be
stopped by courageous individuals and
governments.
The peace rally closed with a number of
students advocating a military response to

the attacks. As they spoke, there was a
noticeable decrease in applause, and students began to leave the Parrish steps
amidst the driving rain.
Will Ortman 'O2 expressed his opposition to pacifism, which he called "peace at
any price," and said we "must act or we'll
still be talking when the next plane crashes into the next building.
"We did not start this war, we did not
want this war, but to turn away from our
responsibility is not only cowardly, it
places the people of the United States and
the world in the gravest danger of further

attacks," Ortman said.
A few local community members,
including several members of the
Swarthmore Friends Meeting, worked with
20 to 25 students to put together the event,
organizer Sam Blair 'O2 said. Most students

were affiliated with the Swarthmore

Progressive Action Committee (SPAC), but
others interested in "seeking and raising
alternatives to war and military retalia-

tion" have established a group of about 45
students since the peace rally, and the
group is thinking about establishing a new
name for the campaign.

A trip to Washington, D.C. this weekend to join rallies against war and discrimination is the next step for these students, who also intend to join some of the
Swarthmore community on a walk for
peace and a candlelight vigil tomorrow
evening, Blair said. Many have begun
working to research current foreign policy
issues, and some are planning educational
programs about the crisis for local middle
and high schools.

New committee to
restore Crum Woods
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
In an effort to restore and preserve
170 acres of college-owned land threatened by invasive species, erosion and
facilities development in the Crum, the
college formed the Crum Woods
Stewardship Committee last fall.
Scott Arboretum Director and committee member Claire Sawyer said the college's involvement in the committee
shows dedication to raising awareness of
the problems facing the habitat. She
thinks the committee will improve towngown relations because the Crum is "an
amenity that the public can use." Many
committee members emphasized that
forested areas such as the Crum are rare
in Delaware County.
Five faculty members, stafffrom facilities and the arboretum, the college vice
president and two students compose the
new committee along with an outside consulting firm, Natural Lands Trust.
A need to prevent harmful facilities
development and to raise faculty awareness of the Crum's deterioration
prompted the provost to create the committee. Rare plant and animal species
inhabit the Crum, and seventeen professors from all three academic divisions use the Crum as a resource in

their classes.
Roger Latham, formerly an assistant
professor of biology and currently a con-

sultant for the Natural Lands Trust, is in
the midst of performing the first task of
the
Woods
Stewardship
Crum
Committee: taking an inventory of the
Crum's .biodiversity. Recently, the
Natural Lands Trust discovered the
largest scarlet oak tree in Pennsylvania
inside the Crum. In addition, Latham is
measuring tree sizes, some of which
indicate that the Crum holds some of the
best old-growth forest remaining in this
region of the state. Some of the trees, he
said, have not been lumbered for hundreds of years. The Natural Lands Trust
is also performing a floral inventory of

the Crum.
Over the summer, Latham visited
five of the seven colleges in the northeastern United States that own areas
similar to the Crum. Out of the five he
visited, Latham said Williams College
owned the most well-preserved forests,
which are about ten times the size of
the Crum. Latham also noted that

Williams has a woods manager to
address its forest's environmental
issues, a position Swarthmore lacks.
This semester, four of the five faculty members on last year's committee
are on leave. One recently appointed
committee member, Timothy Williams,
a biology professor who uses the Crum
in all of his classes, described the Crum
of his student years in the '6os as a
"woodland glaze." When asked about
how the Crum has changed since then,
Williams said, "This is the worst I've
ever seen it."
Before it became a Works Progress
Administration (WPA) project of the
19205, WiUiams said, the Crum was "a
wasteland." Dr. John Wister, a former
biology professor, designed the project
as an educational resource for the college, Williams said, and it was also very
common for members of the community
to take walks in the woods. He said saving the Crum, both for educational and
for recreational purposes, would be less
costly now than it would be later.

Both Latham and Williams commented on the effects that the "Blue
Route," Interstate 476, had on the
Crum. The Blue Route highway was
blocked for thirty years due the col-

lege's opposition to its potential to
threaten the woods, although its planning began in the 19605. In the 19905,
after the college gained some concessions in its battle about the route's construction, including reduction in its
width and changes in its layout, the
Blue Route finally came into existence.
Williams said the Crum was much

more peaceful before the construction

of the highway.
Invasive species from Eurasia have
also contributed to the deterioration of
some of the Crum's native species.
During the construction of the Mullan
Tennis Center, Cornell Library, and
most recently, the new science center,
areas of the Crum have had to be
cleared. Runoff from the parking lots
also contributes to the erosion of the
trails in the Crum. The new committee
hopes to rise to meet these obstacles to

restore and preserve the Crum for
future generations. For this reason that
Latham would like to see
least some
permutation of [the committee] be permanent."

Wilderness program on track
BYCATHY DANH
This fall break, twenty first-year students will attend a backpacking trip organized by the Tri-College Outdoor
Orientation Program (TrOOP), a new effort
that hopes to host outdoor pre-orienations
tor all interested first-years in the future.
Through a lottery system, TrOOP
organizers randomly chose ten students
each from Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr
to attend a pilot trip during fall break.
Haverford students will not participate
in the trip, though
TrOOP organizers
nope they will join future trips.
'The motivation for starting an outdoor
orientation program," TrOOP organizer
Morgan Simon 'O4 said, was for freshmen
to meet each other small groups "before
in
oeing thrown into a new environment with
1,300 other students." It would foster new

experiences and challenges, she said.
"It's a great way to come in to the
college environment... it's a wonderful
opportunity to bring students together,"
said physical education professor and

basketball coach Adrienne Shibles, the
program's faculty sponsor.
Known as SwOOP before it became a
Tri-College program, TrOOP has established itself on campus in less than a
year, gaining the backing of Shibles and
Dean of the College Bob Gross. The
dean's office is showing its support for
TrOOP by funding all costs of the fall
expedition.
"For colleges that already have outdoor orientation programs, everything
is organized by the school," TrOOP
organizer Maria Elena Young 'O4 said.

"People were questioning

At this time, Craig said, the police officers "entered the
party and told them to lower the music. The officers were
told, 'We already got paid, so we don't care,' Craig said.
"One of the cops said, 'lf the show doesn't stop within
three minutes, I'm going to give citations to everyone in
the room,' Batta said.
The officers "were met with some resistance, some
protest," Redgrave said.
"Students in the audience began shouting," Craig said.
"The band members protested and used excessive
profanity. The officers asked them to settle down and
attempted to leave. One of the band members yelled
obscenities at the officers and they returned to the stage."
"The guy in the band said, 'lf I don't play at this volume,
I can't play at all,' Batta said. Then "one of the cops hit a
girl in the head
it was probably by accident. She turned
out to be the girlfriend of the drummer in the band. She
started making a fuss."
Neither Craig or Redgrave knew of such an incident,
and Redgrave was not even aware that police went into
Olde Club.
"To the best of my knowledge Swarthmore police officers never went in the building," he said.
"No one in the band was being really rude," Batta said.
"This lead singer was being very polite, he wasn't cursing.
The officer said, 'OK, you're getting a citation for disorderly conduct.'
"He wasn't doing anything disorderly," Osheim said. "It
seemed a little bit arbitrary. They never said, 'Stop
arguing or we'll cite you.' They definitely came in with a
pretty hostile attitude."
"They were not insulting them in any way," Batta

emphasized.

The band member, Tonie Joy, was cited and released.
When the public safety officers went back outside,
Redgrave said, Andrew Szafran 'O2 was in a "discussion"
with the police.
Szafran was "shouting obscenities and inciting the
people inside," Craig said.

"The crowd was advised to clear, and the officers called
for additional help from other [police] departments."
According to Dean of the College Bob Gross, "when the
two officers felt they were confronting a potential riot
situation they called for back-up from the [county dispatcher], and Media and Morton police responded."
"The band members were moved to another location
outside. As they were giving the band member the citation,
the Swarthmore College student again hollered obscenities
and demanded the officers' badge numbers," Craig said.
Szafran attempted to pull the officers' patches off their uniforms, he added. "He was instructed several times to calm
down, and when he didn't, he was placed under arrest."
At press time, Szafran could not be reached for comment.
"I never heard him say anything blatantly antagonistic," Batta said. "But then one cop goes, and this is a quote,
'OK, this guy's mine.'
"The student's behavior arose to a level that... the officers became concerned for their safety," Craig said.
"I don't know what the laws are here, but in Virginia
the cops are required to show you their badge numbers,"
Osheim said. "They basically said no. They asked for his
hands, cuffed him and arrested him. I don't think he was
drunk."
While Craig said officers had spoken to band members
inside Olde Club, Redgrave said it happened outside. "The
dialogue with the student happened first, perhaps at the
same time," he said
"The report indicates that the SPD officer spoke to the
band about turning the volume down while the public
safety officer spoke to the host," Gross wrote in an e-mail.
Public safety notified the dean on duty, Joy Charlton.
"The student was arraigned, and bail was set at $5,000,"
Craig said. "As a rule," Gross wrote, bail is "the responsibility of the family or friends.
"In this case, [Charlton] acted personally on behalf of
"

the family, who repaid the dean right away," Gross wrote.
On a $5,000 bail, ten percent of the money was required for

ment, and stalking," Craig said.
Redgrave said public safety had been called to Paces
earlier in the evening when a female student reported
being harassed. Rumors were circulating that the
harasser was a band member. While the perpetrator had
been a non-college student, when the public safety officers
arrived, Redgrave said, "she had already spoken to the
person and said things were under control." He did not
believe the two events were related.
"Our only interest was in satisfying the complaint,"
Craig said. "The person [who complained] had a substantially legitimate complaint about the noise
that music
was being heard at one o'clock in the morning went
beyond reasonable."
Osheim, however, was skeptical. "It's never been my
experience that you can hear music from Olde Club in the
ville," he said. "The music wasn't any louder than previous bands
I was talking to one of my friends who lives
in the ville, and he could hear the outdoor party [in the fragrance garden] but not Olde Club."
"It didn't have to come to this; I think the officers were trying to avoid it," Craig said. "This just didn't have to happen."
"All it takes is one call from one prickly little ville person, and the cops come storming in," Batta said.
Osheim said the sound engineers are "talking about getting something to measure sound," to see how far music
would carry during a normal Olde Club performance.
"The ville's noise ordinance is not clearly stated," Batta
said. "We don't know exactly what level we can play at."
"Olde Club has been operating for thirty years, and
there is no indication that the noise was any louder than
usual," Gross wrote. "But sometimes weather conditions
result in the noise carrying further."
The college, meanwhile, is "investigating and considering judicial action," he wrote. "We think the police acted
appropriately in this situation. They only wanted the noise
to lessen, and they were not seeking a big confrontation.
One lesson is that it is risky, to say the least, to challenge
police authority in ambiguous situations. If you have a
complaint to make, they will be quite willing to hear it the
next day, but not in the heat of the moment."

Group hosts trail trip
From WILDERNESS, pg. 7

Upperclassmen serve as leaders and
are trained about a year ahead by people
within the 'outdoor department' of that
school." Since the Swarthmore program
has not yet established an 'outdoor department,' a conservation group called
Project U.S.E. trained the first set of students who will lead the freshmen, Than
Court 'O3, Mike Wollenburg 'O2, Emily
Pollina 'O4 and Kate Baker 'O4, for the

ly executing the pilot trip. After fall
break, Shibles said, everyone involved
with the trip will meet with administrators and talk about their experiences on
the trip, at which point TrOOP will be
"reevaluated for the future."
TrOOP organizer Zac Steele 'O4 said
the group was "hoping that after these
trips, administrators will see how successful these trips are and will prioritize
money for it in the future."

October pilot.

"Project U.S.E. is an organization that
does trips ranging from ropes courses to
canoeing to backpacking," Pollina said.
She, along with several other members of
TrOOP, completed the Project U.S.E. backpacking program before classes began
this semester.
"What made our training different
from those who generally do the program
was that instead of learning the basics, we
learned how they taught other people.
They taught us team-building games and
they taught us strategies for teaching
such as dividing up responsibilities,"
Pollina said. Although the training was
helpful, members of TrOOP wished they

had "talked more about medical training."

"October's trip will take place in
northern New Jersey and on the
Appalachian Trail," Simon said. The
twenty attendees and four leaders will
split into two groups, each of which will
go on a different route and may "meet up
in the middle for a game of capture the
flag," Simon said.
The current focus of TrOOP is to get
the program off the ground by successful-

because "students don't have the knowhow" to work within the school's admifl'

see TrOOP be incorporated into the

"At Swarthmore, there is less of

Divergent voices
Stroll out to Route 320 some time. It's a whole new
world out there: flags fly in every other home and business, conversations in restaurants inevitably stray to
the upcoming "war on terrorism." It only takes a few
minutes in the outside world to see that the political
sentiment of most of the United States forms a sharp
contrast to the climate here at Swarthmore and at
other colleges and universities around the country.
While much of the country is still reacting to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, students here are waging a war
of their own, one fought with words from an increasingly vocal section of campus which feels that a military
solution to terrorism is not a just one. According to
most major poll numbers, well over 85 percent of
Americans feel that military action is needed, reflecting
a different perspective than the sentiments displayed at
events like last Thursday's peace rally. At the event,
students proposed wide-ranging nonmilitary solutions

Grounds for concern
This year will be a defining one for Swarthmore athletics. As athletes head into their first seasons as part of
a sports program with three fewer varsity teams, their
experiences will inevitably form the first judgement of
whether last December's galvanizing football cut is
improving the quality of the remaining teams.
The hope expressed by many college officials while
justifying the decision was the quality over quantity
argument: with more resources to go around, teams
would be able to enjoy greater support than ever before.
Already, some coaches are praising the college for
being more responsive to their concerns. Yet all was not
well when athletes returned for preseason in August to
find inadequate fields and incomplete building renovations. And the additional practice space that should
have been available never materialized. Instead, a combination of poor weather this summer and poor planning last spring has left the fields in such bad shape
that fall teams have less practice space than they had
last year. Worse still, several games had to be relocated
because Swarthmore's fields were not playable.
Despite the fact that the college is looking toward
long-term changes in its relationship with athletics, it
must remember that immediate problems like locker
rooms and playing fields matter to athletes already
here. Within a short time, of course, the grass will grow
greener and the renovations will be completed. And
steps should be taken to make sure fields are in better
condition next year. In particular, the college should
reconsider its agreement with summer sports camps
like Future Stars that wear out the fields.
The condition of athletics facilities this fall was
unfortunate; at the very moment the college needs to be
proving its commitment to its teams, it only hurts the
credibility of its renewed focus on improving athletics
when it allows playing grounds to be in worse condition
at the start of the fall season than at the end of the
spring. It is too soon to pass judgement on whether the
college will fulfill its promise to athletes, but we hope
the college will make a concerted effort to pay attention
to the important details that make all the difference.

LETTER TO THE EDITORS

Sports are teaching tools
Columnist wrong in saying athletics merely allow release of 'negative energy'
Dear Editor,
We are writing in response to
Mark JanofFs column last week, "An
ironic saying: sports and fighting
don't mix," in which he stated, "We
shouldn't wax eloquent about the lessons that sports can teach us.
"Sports are not teaching tools.
They are forums for screaming,
yelling, seething, and fighting. Sports
allows us to release negative energy."
The Student Athletic Advisory

Committee represents the student-

athletes of Swarthmore, and one of
our main focuses this year is the lack
of education this campus has about
athletics.
When Janoff says that "sports are
not teaching tools," he devalues the
importance and dedication that a student puts into athletics while at
Swarthmore.
Each day, men and women focus
on their goals, work on their weaknesses and fine-tune their strengths
both in the classroom and on the field,
court, course, track or pool. Yes,

sports do teach lessons, and these les-

sons cannot be taught by a lecture.
Imagine you are a chemistry student. You must work hard in the lab to
understand the concepts being taught
in class. If you do not understand the
lab, you cannot grasp the underlying
concepts.
Now, imagine you are an athlete.
You want to improve. You step onto
the field and work hard to get better.
The field, court, track or pool is your

lab.
What have we learned while at
Swarthmore? Looking back in five,
ten or even just a few years following
graduation, we will remember what
we learned from our teammates: how
to work toward a common goal.
We will remember that we learned
to work harder when faced with challenges. We will remember how it feels
to be successful when we achieve our
team goal. We will remember how
sports exposed our weaknesses and
how we worked to make those weaknesses our strengths.

We promise you will not remember
what Planck's constant is or who
Weber was and what his sociological
theories mean.
So, you ask why we play sports? If
you ask us that question, we ask you
why you take an exam.
Exams show strengths and weaknesses; they tell the students and professors what needs to be focused on.
Athletic contests are just the same;

they aren't just ways to let out our
aggression. They test the athletes;
strengths
and weaknesses are
exposed.

Coaches and athletes learn what
needs to be focused on at the next
practice. The field, court, pool or
track is the coach's classroom and a
place where athletes learn.
We hope that in the following days.

weeks and months the college community tries to understand the importance of athletes.

to the crisis and speculated about how America could
have prompted the terrorists' actions.
As the days since the attacks have passed, much of
the campus' public reaction strays further from the
mainstream, and student voices here have appeared to
grow more and more divergent. Some students even
feel unwilling to talk
publicly or even privately
about their views, afraid of provoking an emotional
response from either side. But surely feeling that military action against Afghanistan is necessary does not
mean you're a right-wing fanatic, just as a stand for a
nonmilitary response to the tragedies of Sept. 11 does
not make you anti-American.
The increasing polarization on campus has left no
room for those who feel the issue is more complex than
merely peace vs. war or left vs. right; nor does it create
a comfortable atmosphere for those who are unsure
where they stand. In this, a learning community, we
should have more than enough opportunities to discuss the many complexities of the terrorists' motivations or the best response to the attacks.

OPINIONS
BY AUDREY CHANI

OP-ART
DAVID ELLIS
Big Man on Campus

War is inevitable
Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick called
them the "Blame America Firsters" for their amazing
capacity to blame the United States for all the world's ills.
Yet never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that
leftists, including many vocal members of the Swarthmore
community, would actually fault America for this month's
terrorist attacks.
For some, America is at fault for our global economic
leadership, which has enriched more people around the
world than any force ever before. For others, America's
perceived arrogance is the culprit
apparently we're
insolent for not signing atrocious treaties like Kyoto,
which was originally conceived by domestic European politics' kowtowing to the Greens. Another section of the left
blames American defense policy; never mind that over the
past decade we have fought for Muslims from Kuwait to
Bosnia, and from Somalia to Kosovo.
America has been the greatest force for freedom and
worldwide economic development that the world has ever
known. Swarthmore students like nothing better than
pointing out America's flaws. While it's our civic duty to
seek self-improvement, it seems that we've lost perspective
on the tremendous good that America represents in this
world. The French offer us the proper example for criticizing America. In peacetime they deride us as a "hyperpower," but when the chips are down we have no better friend.
Contrast this with the leftists. Extremists arise when
people cherish one value at the expense of all others.
Pacifists favor peace at all costs, even when world events
dictate that we are indeed at war. Peaceniks are infuriated
at the fight to come
but never do we hear them offer a
better alternative outside of meaningless bromides, such
as, "We should focus our efforts on creating a fairer
world." Thanks peaceniks, we'll try to keep that in mind.
If we do not respond to this grievous provocation, we
will be attacked again and again until we realize that peace
is an illusion. Wars aren't unnatural. They have been
fought since the beginning of time because people have
conflicting interests that they are willing to die for.
I saw William Cohen come on "Meet the Press" in 1997
to inform us that we will be attacked by chemical or biological weapons in the next 10 years. We should not be surprised by terrorism, but we should be resolute in its eradication. Peace cannot be ensured through international
law or platitudes, as our forebears discovered in 1929 when
they actually outlawed war. The only way to defend our
way of life and our values is by destroying those who are
plotting to murder us.
That means we must take all measures to decimate our
enemies' capacity to wage war. For the first time since the
19th century, a nation-state has failed to control groups
within its borders that have waged international violence.
It is the anti-terrorist coalition's prerogative to ensure that
the terrorist network is destroyed, since the state has
failed in this capacity. While one priority will be to protect
the lives of civilians, this is not the only important consideration in the world. We should not be prevented from protecting civilization because, in the words of the "student
solidarity" rally's statement of purpose, civilian lives
might be endangered. Of course civilian lives may be
endangered! They have been endangered in every military
operation since time immemorial. The defense of our values and our lives has costs and it pains us all to bear them.
But we will not be to blame for our deaths should they
come for that we can thank our enemies.
We are indeed in a nasty situation. The worldwide economy has tanked in a way that will affect us for years.
Foreign direct investment around the world has halved.
We're in the thick of an Arab civil war between legitimate
regimes and Islamic fundamentalism. And we have to
defeat a shadowy enemy that is difficult to clearly define.
But let's avoid the Ivory Tower inclination to overanalyze ourselves into a Gordian knot. We have the greatest
economies, militaries and intelligence services in the
world on our side. In Powell and Cheney, we have the most
competent and experienced foreign policy team in 50
years. And we have a wartime president who we've
watched come of age before our eyes. His Lincolnian
speeches have inspired a country to fight for a worthy
cause. We should choose to follow.

Rethinking ethics of America's plan

perspective. This is, after all, a world
after Sept. 11, and this country has
undergone a real transition from a
kind of blissful normality into a state in which fear,
anger, loss and confusion are a part of everyday life.
For those of us who have friends and relatives in the
Middle East and Southern Asia, the worst may be yet to
come in the form of mass retaliation by the United

States. And for those millions of American citizens and
immigrants who originated from those parts of the
world, an upward struggle against racism, profiling and
challenges to fundamental civil liberties seems
inevitable. In short, we live in a frightening time and we
must equip ourselves to respond.
On the day President Wilson spoke at this campus
hints of war were already showing themselves in th

Balkans, and it would be less than a year before th
whole of Europe erupted in an apocalyptic struggle in
which millions would perish. Closer to home, though
not even the president was particularly concernec

admit our own faults and arrogance while we blame others for theirs?
I wonder whether a critical self-examination of the
U.S. foreign policies that created the hate and animosity behind the Sept. 11 attacks would even be considered.
Is it more virtuous to practice a kind of proper humility
and thus work with others in finding true justice? I ask
whether America can solve anything by acting in selfinterest, and whether working with those countries that
are not in lock-step with America's interests would be a
better means to the right end.
As we walk around this beautiful campus, contemplating the tragedy of Sept. 11 and America's potential
responses, it may be worthwhile to think about how we
can respond to President Wilson's entreaty given on
that crisp autumn day in 1913. How do we remember and
execute our errand of enriching the world, thus avoiding self-impoverishment?

I suspect that the answer lies in a quest not often
thought of in the 21st century: a quest for values.

OPINIONS

DAN KOROBKIN
In Public

What is it like
to be a Bush?
The philosopher Thomas Nagel has said that the phenomena of consciousness and experience make it very difficult to imagine what it is like to be something else.
"Facts about what it is like to be an X are very peculiar,
so peculiar that some may be inclired to doubt their reality, or the significance of claims about them," he wrote.
A case in point: we find our president a very peculiar
man. I assume we all believe that Bush has experience.
Well, perhaps not the type of leadership experience one
would hope for in a president, but at a very basic level we
must all believe that George W. Bush, as a conscious
human being and in very general terms, experiences
things. Furthermore, as Nagel has indicated, the implication of the belief that Bush has experience is that there is
something that it is like to be a Bush.
What could that something be? What is it like?
I'd imagine it goes something like this. You wake up
early on Sept. 1L You are not very happy with your life.
Sure, you are the most powerful person on the planet (tied
with Alan Greenspan), the Leader of the Free World, the
Big Cheese, "el jefe"
right. Anyway, despite all these
things, you find the job boring. Stem cells, schtem
schmells, when is the next month-long vacation, and why
is everyone so obsessed with Al Gore's beard?
Suddenly, everything changes.
Your chiefof staff whispers something in your ear, and
within moments it is clear that the United States is under
attack. You are whisked away to Air Force One, where the
Vice President informs you that he is back in the White
House, in charge as usual. But this time you strengthen
your resolve: "When we find out who did this, they are not
going to like me as president," you say. "Somebody is
going to pay."
You sense that this is a turning point in your life, and
a defining moment in the nation's history, though the rest
of the country is a bit slow on the uptake. The Secret
Service is shuttling you between undisclosed locations
where people grow corn, and Alan Greenspan's wife is
calling you inarticulate on MSNBC. When you finally
make it back to the capital, you are too exhausted to give

a decent address from the Oval Office. But you are on a
new mission.
"I will not forget the wound to our country and those
who inflicted it," you tell Congress a week later in a
prime-time address. "I will not yield. I will not rest. I will
not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people." It is the best speech you have
ever given.
You are not an actor, which means that you cannot
hide what you don't care about. But you are not a robot,
which means that you cannot help but convey your deepest convictions. That is a big part of what it is like to be a
Bush. But there is another part, too: since you are human,
you focus on certain parts of your new destiny and shy
away from others.
You warn Americans to respect Islam, but you forget,
or do not know, that using the terminology of war wiU provide some people with what they think is an excuse to
exercise their racial fears and prejudices against Arabs
on airplanes and Muslims in mosques.
You say our war will be a long one, but you cannot
articulate specifically against whom it will be fought, how
long it might last, or by what standard we can measure
our success. You claim we were attacked because our
attackers "hate our freedoms," but you do not discuss
much foreign policy, and why that also is, or might not be,
worth fighting for.
Perhaps, then, it is like one thing to be a Bush, and it
is like another thing to be of Middle Eastern descent. It is
like another thing yet to be in the military, and like another thing to be peace-loving, and like another thing to be
Muslim, and like another thing to be Jewish.
There are just so many things that it is like to be, but
the only thing I can be is the thing I already am.
I am glad I'm not a Bush. I do not think I like what it is
like to be one.

Spread of cups
marks habits

of frat scene
BY MATT WALLAERT

Rare is the animal that soils its nest, but we
humans are rare creatures that tend to ignore half of
nature's laws in the pursuit of our own ends. For
proof, take a look in any dorm room on campus and
marvel at the wonder that is Swarthmore: the
unemptied trash can that overflows onto the floor,
the pile of laundry that hasn't been washed for
weeks, the pilfered dishes from Sharpies that remain
unwashed, despite the strange, gray-green mold that
has begun to cover them.
Fortunately, most students are either attacked by
3 a.m. guilt trips or manage to clean their rooms as
a method of procrastination, since you obviously
can't clean your room and write your English paper
at the same time. But there is one member of the
Swattie species that seems to be immune to these natural
urges to clean up its living environment at least periodically. I refer, of course, to the Fraticus Drunkus, more commonly known as the Frat Boy, and its unique ability to
induce the rampant spread of plastic
cups and other waste across the
Swarthmore campus.
True, the Fraticus does have a tal-

ent for providing the community
with cheap beer and an age-identification system that is convenient.
Almost like a rave, the frat party is a
cultural artifact; even if you don't
drink, it's a part of the college atmosphere and worth dropping in on at
least once, if only to say that you've
been and seen and experienced.

not to say that the Fraticus Drunkus is stupid, merely that
he hasn't yet figured out something most of us were taught
in first grade: You are responsible for your own mess.
After a particularly festive Thursday evening about
two weeks ago, one of the fraternity lawns became the
home of an artistic array of clear plastic cups, some still
half-filled with a pale yellow liquid that was beer or urine,
neither of which is a particularly appetizing thought. This
began a trend. Each successive party added another in an

coordination and doubling as a patri-

otic monument, proudly displaying
the national colors on a pleasant,
grassy background.

It is quite possible that by now the fraternities will

Rally betrays Swarthmore ideals

Dear Editor:

Last Thursday, a Rally for Peace was held on the steps

attentive and respectful. The comments of professors and
students drew responses that
ranged from polite to enthusiastic.

Their intent was not to disparage

stated clearly that while they did not want war, they
believed that the only effective strategy for the United
States to pursue was one of military retaliation. Instead of

be to our own students."

While most other colleges also have
summer programs, few have fielded similar complaints about fields. At Bryn Mawr
College, both game fields are used extensively by summer camps and teams practice on them through the fall. While Bryn
Mawr's fields were hit by a summer
drought, said director of grounds Robert
Burton, the fields are no worse than usual
and coaches "are really happy with how the
fields have come back" since August.
Burton said that Bryn Mawr has come
to an agreement whereby camps stop after
the first week of August. However, Future
Stars uses Swarthmore facilities and fields
through August 10. That's just 10 days
before the preseason for fall athletics, and
leaves little time to rehabilitate the fields.

Field flaws

When fall student-athletes returned to
campus on Aug. 20, they found themselves
awash in a sea of construction and field
renovations. Despite the cutting of football
and the subsequent freeing of two fields on
Clothier, the field hockey, men's soccer and

women's soccer teams found themselves
with less field space than last year.
Why the field crunch? Two fields on
Cunningham
the new rugby field and
the new shared field hockey and lacrosse
field
had new drainage systems
installed, but the grass has yet to grow
back properly.

The $70,000 system consisted of a grid of

sand lines

often several inches in width

designed to draw moisture down and off
the field. Unfortunately, despite repeated
seeding and irrigation, grass did not cover
the sand grooves, leaving an uneven playing surface.
Ben Burns, vice president of Hummer
Turfgrass Systems, the company that
installed the drainage system, said the system of narrow trenches has proven very

effective for both slanted and flat fields.
Normally, he said, grass grows in over the
grid within two months, but a drought this
summer made re-growing the turfdifficult.
"Our whole year was just terrible for
turf establishment," Burns said. However,
he also added that mid-summer is never
the best time to grow new turf because of
the hot and often dry weather. Barring the
sudden arrival of winter, Burns said, most
turf should benefit from the cooler and wetter fall. Swarfhmore's new systems were
installed on one field at the beginning of
May and one at the beginning of June. Ben

Burns said, "We like to have a couple of
months of growing time."
Director of Grounds Jeff Jabco said,
"We fully expected those fields to be ready
by mid-August," but, he added, "weather is
something you just can't predict."
Both soccer teams now only have one
regulation-sized field to share. Other possible game fields are either too narrow or are
used by the rugby teams. On Cunningham,
all fields are currently under renovation,
including field hockey's game and practice
fields. The team has been forced onto a
temporary home on Clothier fields at the
former site of the football team's practice
field.
Carroll's cross-country team has been
forced to find alternate running routes due
to the field renovations on Cunningham.
Peter Carroll, head cross-country and track
and field coach, said, "I think the grounds
crew did all they could considering the situation. The problem is that with our fastpaced lifestyles, we think we can get things
done in a matter of minutes, hours, or
days."

The lack of adequate field space has
caused scheduling difficulties. On Sept. 13,
both the men's and women's soccer teams
had scheduled home games. The women
were forced to play on the stadium field,
which is 10 yards too narrow. The field
hockey team had to change their season
opener against Widener from home to
away because of the field conditions. They
have since had to stop one of their games
after 12 minutes of play because of the field
conditions that were compounded by a
steady drizzle.
Upon arrival back on campus, the rugby
teams noticed the new drainage system
problems on their field. According to
Emily Sigalow 'O2, captain of the women's
team, no one communicated to them the
condition of their field. Though the team is
able to practice and compete on their new
field, Pablo Montagnes 'O2, captain of the
men's team, said, "A lot of the guys are
leaving practice with cut knees and
elbows." But what worries the captains the
most is not just the condition of the fields,
but they are still unclear about athletic
department policies regarding field times,
Sigalow said.

Summer facelifts

During the summer, the athletic facilities had an $BOO,OOO facelift, which began
phase one of the facilities imrovement. The
lobby in the field house was renovated,
Tarble Pavilion repainted, the floor relined,
and motorized baskets and glass backboards
installed. The indoor and outdoor tracks
were both relined. The Dellmuth-Rath
House, on Cunningham fields, has added
hot water, lockers and has become "more
user-friendly," Williams said.
However, most of these changes didn't
come easily or on time. According to
Schall, the first planning meetings in April
which involved most full-time coaches,
Williams, Schall and outside planners
started "way too late."

although it had originally appeared as a
side point of a greater effort to upgrade the
look of the field house. The key to this project was new flooring, lighting and paint.
Plans for the lobby project weren't finalized until June 1, about 10 days before construction was slated to start.
And when the fall sports teams returned

ments, many coaches have praised what
they see as an increased commitment from
the college. Head men's basketball coach
Lee Wimberly said, "The administration
has been significantly more responsive to
our concerns
than they were before."
Three new full-time coaching positions have
been added, and Adam Hertz was hired to
fill the new position of associate athletic
director. "Adam is improving the ability of
facilities and athletics to communicate on a
whole host of things," said Schall.

Renovation remains unfinished because of
the long lead time on equipment.
Two other projects were delayed until
next summer: the resurfacing of the outdoor track and the construction of dugouts
on the baseball and softball fields. These
were postponed because it is still unclear
how the former football field will be renovated, Schall said. The outdoor track was,
however, repainted.

concerns including the intersection of athletics and campus culture.
At the moment, coaches' concerns are
focusing on the ongoing issue of summer
camps and their effect on facilities. But
their concerns may not be finding a voice
in larger discussions on athletics, at least
not yet. Speaking of facilities issues,
O'Connell said, "It's something the ARC is
going to be deeply interested in, in seeing
how that discussion evolves. There is a
forum for coaches to express those views.
...At the moment that discussion hasn't
come to the ARC, because it's underway [in
other committees]."
"What's done is done. Our mission now
is not to let it happen again," said track
coach Carroll, speaking of the fields problems that developed over the summer. "If
this situation continues to happen where
Swarthmore students are deprived of their
privileges because of outside parties connected to the college, then we should be
held accountable."

THE STORY OF THAT ONE DORM,
WAY OFF CAMPUS, THAT NOBODY
WANTS TO LIVE IN
BY SETH "SURVIVOR" SIAS

Remember

the television show "Survivor"? This year there is an episode of
survivor right here on campus, or more accurately, a few minutes away from
campus. That's right, it's Mary Lyon Basement Survivor! If the roaches and
leaking pipes don't git ya, sucka, then maybe the dumpsters right outside
your window will. At any rate, the 7:30 a.m. garbage pickups will probably not
help you in your quest to survive.
Three of my friends and I were unlucky enough to end up on this abomination of a hall.
Last year, we enjoyed nice rooms in Mertz, but apparently Myrt's random number generator hates us, so now we live in a home that reminds me of Count Ugolino's place in
Dante's "Inferno."
For those readers fortunate enough never to have seen the ML Basement, the first
thing to mention is that the architects who came to campus last year to plan the new
dorm called it "sub-standard housing." Physically, you'll be happy to know, it is divided into two sections. The first is similar to the rest of ML. I happen to live in the other,
more hideous section. To reach these nether regions, one must cross a labyrinth, passing a room that is best described as an eel pit. You have to see it to believe it, but don't
home to a rather large dead cockroach,
bother. This pit was and perhaps still is
lying in plain view. If you look at the floor plan on the housing website, you'll find that
there is a portion marked "unexcavated area." Apparently we live in pre-1709
Herculaneum.
The real fun begins when you reach an undersized door that leads to the second half
of the basement.

'

As the days grind on, the pressure builds, and the
contestants start to drop like flies. There were
rumors that six more people were leaving. What
joy! I would win this game of survivor more quickly
than anticipated.

Emily Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff

Jon Ehrenfeld and James Zvokel waste time in their mess of a room, deep in the lower
circles of hell.

The diabolical origins of ML
The building we all know as Mary Lyon
is actually Mary Lyon 4, and since its construction in 1918, it has been a girls'
boarding school, a naval hospital, faculty
housing and a dormitory.
In 1892 the Swarthmore Grammar
School was founded in the buildings that
now comprise PPR. When the school
went from coed to all-boys, due to a perceived lack of interest from girls, in 1913,
Hadly Miller Crist and his wife, Frances
Leavitt Crist, founded the Mary Lyon
School. Mary Lyon, the school's namesake, was a prominent nineteenth century educator who founded Mount Holyoke
College in 1837.
In 1943 Frances Miller Crist leased
the school to the Navy, which used the
space as a hospital. The school finished
that academic year in New York, and then
closed permanently. During the three

years that Mary Lyon was a hospital, the
Navy made alterations to the buildings
and treated over 3,000 patients.
After the war, the Navy returned Mary
Lyon to the Crist family. But without a
school to run, they decided to sell the
property to Swarthmore College in 1946.
Due to the huge numbers of veterans
returning to college after World War 11, the
college immediately needed to use Mary
Lyon as a dorm. Current students may be
interested to know that the breakfast
room opened to Swarthmore students for
the first time on Oct. 16,1946.
As the flood of veterans dissipated,
the dorm became both faculty housing
and a dormitory, but eventually became
student-housing only. Mary Lyon was the
first dorm on campus to become completely coed by room.
SETH SIAS

Here any trappings that would distinguish this as a real dorm disappear. The
exposed piping, obnoxious in the other half of the basement, is somehow worse; we all
expect to succumb to asbestosis within the semester, or at the very least, be tormented
by the sound of running water in the wee hours of the morning. An insidious, and broken Foosball table sits dejectedly in one corner of the lounge, along with a shopping
cart. Worse yet is the fact that those above us seem to greatly enjoy the "throwing furniture" game, in which, you guessed it, they apparently throw furniture in order to
make as much noise as humanly possible.
Last year we griped about the Mertz bathrooms. Ah, the good old days. The showers
may have been grungy and moldy, but none had a window quite like our new bathroom's. ML's brilliant architect decided that it would be a good idea to put a crotch-level,
ground floor window next to a urinal. The phrase "insult to injury" comes to mind.
If all this wasn't bad enough, after weathering another night in the Dungeon, as we
affectionately call our home, we are still faced with a 15 minute walk to campus, most
likely through rain or slush.
The reason that living here is like a game of survivor is that people frequently
leave, never to return. We like to believe they end up in a better place.
During "Survivor I", the evicted islanders ended up in a resort on some South Pacific
paradise. For us, Willets suicide singles are the equivalent consolation prizes.
To recap the departures so far, we had one hallmate, Clifford Sosin 'O4 disappear
almost before he arrived. I came to school, saw his name on the door, saw him once in
the hall, and saw a new name on his former door the next day.
The next escapee from the Dungeon was Mari Velez 'O4, who disappeared into a posh
lodge before I even met her.
As the days grind on, the pressue builds, and the contestants start drop like flies.
There were rumors that six more people were leaving. What joy! I would win this game
of survivor more quickly than anticipated.
Sadly, only three of these six competitors are gone so far, but I will not be surprised

if the other three soon vanish as well.
Ann Owens, who no longer attends Swarthmore College, attempted to fly away from
this place on Sept. 12, when air travel was at a standstill, just because she could not
stand to be here one more minute than she had to. Who could blame her?
Only last weekend, both Claire Vancik 'O4 and Jessie Dryden 'O4, who transferred
into the college this year, transferred off our hall. I am amazed that they lasted so long.
On the day of their arrival, Vancik said, "It seemed pretty good until... there was this
giant roach scuttling along my suitcase." Vancik ended up living in Sosin's empty
room while hers was fumigated. Upon her return, she noticed the exposed pipes in her
ceiling. "Starting at 6:40 a.m. there is rushing water from the breakfast room," Vancik
said, which would be bad enough, but "once it stops, the pipes groan."

Mankind is fit for no activity like it is fit for arguing. Our most distant ancestors, before
they ate, before they slept, before they so much as scratched themselves, argued. And while
their form of debate consisted of throwing clods of dirt at each other, over the intervening
ages the human race has made a science of the activity to which it is so naturally disposed.
The earliest style of argumentation preserved in recorded form is that of the ancient
Greek philosopher Socrates, who must be considered the father of every species of right
thinking. His modus operandi was to irritate his opponent with irrelevant questions to such
an extent that in the end they would simply agree with everything he said, however ridiculous it might be. If we were to exemplify this method in the context of a current issue, we
might end up with the following dialogue:
SOCRATES: ...and so, Ridiculocrates, you are compelled to concede that the name "Yasser

Arafat" contains no less than four instances of the letter "a."
RIDICULOCRATES: It cannot be denied, Socrates.
SOCRATES: If we attempted, then, to spell a comical word by rearranging the letters of
the name in question, we would be justified in leaving out one "a," seeing as there are so
many.

Tweedledee and Tweedledum. It is
from these artful thinkers that we get the form of the syllogism which has far surpassed
Aristotle's in its influence: "Contrariwise, if it was so, it might be; if it were so, it would be;
but as it isn't, it ain't."
The year of the first Presidential debates, 1796, was a seminal year for the science offorensics, because a certain unspoken rule that had until then been thought indispensable for any
sound piece of reasoning
namely, actually addressing the topic at hand
was entirely
done away with. It was replaced with the practice of repeating unsubstantiatedbut pleasantsounding general campaign themes. There actually exists a transcript of this first debate,
between Thomas Jefferson and JohnAdams. An excerpt:
MODERATOR: Mr. Jefferson, what the American public really wants to know is just how
close you are to your slaves; more specifically, those of the female persuasion.
JEFFERSON: Well, I believe everyone has the God-given right to pursue his own happiness. That's why, under my budget plan, the rich as well as the poor, the young as well as the
elderly, will have their needs met. After all, we are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.
And I'm a uniter, not a divider.
Despite the argumentative innovations of past ages, there is perhaps no age which has so
refined and lofty a sense of debate as our own. Even in the lyrics of our music, we demand from
each statement a degree of exactness,
and at the same time of elegance, to which no other age
could even aspire, as exemplified by that famously profound line from the Wallflowers: "The
only difference that I see is that you are exactly the same as you used to be."
It is the present age, moreover, that can lay a just claim to the invention of advertising,
which, while not strictly a form of argumentation, can be considered as such, in so far as the
advertisers are trying to convince theiraudience of something, i.e. that the consumer should
buy their products. In infomercials,
argumentation has reached a level of sophistication that
Socrates could never have imagined. Take the infomercials for Tony Little's home fitness

RIDULOCRATES: I see no way of avoiding the conclusion.

So I went to a public, SAC-funded party this weekend. This is not something I
generally do. This is admittedly partially my own choice. Plenty of people seem to
like the parties here, and I'm guessing it's not SOLELY the lure of free alcohol and
a possible hot random hook-up. But since this column isn't actually about me
(smirk), I'll not get into that, and instead focus my brief spurt of negativity on all
the reasons that have been pointed out a thousand times over, and which are still
in some respects true, that have impacted my party abstinence policy. The music is
too loud and probably sucks, the alcohol tastes like pee, one can't see or breathe
among the sweaty people, much less dance, and the general atmosphere is dull at
best.
Don't stop reading yet. You're only a paragraph in. Yes, you're absolutely right.
I sound like another whiny, frustrated dork afraid to have a good time, without any
optimism or drive to make things change. You're wrong, about some of it at least.
And you also haven't gotten to the cannibalism jokes yet. Anyhow, the point is that
the party I went to this weekend was pretty cool. The music kicked ass, the food was
good, and the atmosphere, that intangible thing that makes it fun rather than pointless, was there, man. And it was sweet. I'm not going to mention the names of the
DJ's/organizers, but they know who they are and they can consider this an official
Phoenix shout-out.
I really have no complaints about this weekend's festivities. It even smelled nice.
Considering the way my socks smell, and considering how many more sweaty people there were in the party space than there are in my socks, that's pretty damn
impressive. But it did get me thinking. I'm not a "party person," but as I am occasionally reminded, I do like to party, when the party being had is a good party for
me to have. So, with that in mind, isn't the only moral thing to do to participate in
the creating of such social events, to spread the love, the groove, the ability to shake
one's ass? Well, yeah. Probably. But it's also a lot easier to sit on the sidelines an
urge other, better-suited-to-the-task people on. Thus, in the spirit of ongoing journalistic passive-aggression and without further ado, I present to you my own personal
TOP FIVE

SWARTHMORE PARTIES I'D LIKE TO SEE:

5.) The Dada Party Telephones, hats, computer mice and other found objects
hang from the ceilings, suspended by neon orange string that glows under blacklight. The D J's equipment is largely composed of a Rube Goldberg-type apparatus
which periodically emits squealing noises and scatological children's music, and
people have a hard time dancing anyway because of the thick layer of lime-green

The sea shanties are kickin', the rum is flowin',
and, for the evening, life ain't nothing but
wenches and doubloons.
Jell-0 on the floor, but they don't care. Because after all, what is left to care for in
a world where symbols fail to express the great emptiness of being? Is it not best
just to marry a gastrolith?
4.) The Furniture Party
Like IKEA, except fun. Lots of furniture. Chairs,
tables, desks, sofas, ottomans, wardrobes, you name it, we've got it. You can dance
on it, under it, over it, in between it, behind it or anywhere else you want. There
should probably be cookies shaped like couches or something too. And big, comfy
chairs to sit in while you consume your fancy beverages, served from behind the
largest bar stool you ever did see.

3.) Cannibal: The Party
Mmm. Do you like people? Do you like people
with mustard? If you've ever "craved flesh," this party is for you. Celebrate the.act
of anthropophagy in its various forms. Dance to the music descended from various
flesh-eating cultures, and eat such yummy Sharpies-prepared appetizers as "human
brains" (red spaghetti with meat sauce), "fingers" (chicken fingers), and for all you
vegans who own "Hannibal" on DVD, the special "liver with some fava beans and
a nice chianti" (crushed garden burgers). (DISCLAIMER: I am a vegetarian. This is
also a joke. Do not hate me.)
...

2.) The Reform Party
Will the candidate selected be a former professional
wrestler who has publicly admitted to not wearing underwear, or an egomaniac billionaire hellbent on slapping his name on the biggest metaphorical phalluses
money can buy? Or will it just be boring old Mr. fascist-pants Pat Buchanan? Who
the hell cares? The real question is Who Let the Dogs Out?
-

Merchant ships, run in terror if ye know what's good for

ye. We fly the skulland bones tonight! Any landlubber who doubts the simple truth
that this would be the greatest thing EVER is walking the plank. The sea shanties
are kickin', the rum is flowin', and, for the evening, life ain't nothing but wenches
and doubloons. No rape will be permitted, but pillage, plundering, rifling, looting
and consensual nookie are all part of your high-seas life as a lawless buccaneer.
Avast!

There is really little else to say. Having outlined exactly how to save the allegedly waning Swarthmore party scene was hard enough work for one evening. In my
next column, perhaps I shall deign to show you pathetic overweight bastards how
to cause anyone to fall madly in love with you forever, have endless, poetic tantric
sex, and get straight A's in all twelve classes you're taking, all while you sleep.
yeah, that's the ticket.

What would your
mother think?
With 'Bully/ Larry Clark, the director of 'Kids,' goes from art to pornography
BY JAE WON CHUNG
Imagine a young teenage girl

named Lisa. With a cherubic,
roundish face, she resembles a
younger, more disheveled Kate
Winslet. During the day, she
dresses drably in large, earthtone shirts and baggy pants. At
night, she sleeps naked. We
know, because we watch her
awake, rolling blissfully out of
bed. The camera, the eyes that
we are given, ogles her body. You
notice her smallish breasts, nipples more like pale stains, that
hints at "child." Forget the fact
that you are at the Ritz, where
"art films" are shown. When you
keep seeing her this way—the
camera reveals her unapologetically—you begin to feel ashamed
to be there. What would your
mother think?
Lisa (played by Rachel Miner)
is one of the main characters in
Larry Clark's new movie,
"Bully," a film based on a book by

Jim Schutze, which chronicles
the murder of a tyrannical boy by
a band of morally bankrupt
Florida teenagers. Our Lisa, as it
turns out, is one of main co-con-

of
the
murder.
spirators
Throughout the film, we get to

shift any blame;

not society, not

the
media.

to be nothing

evil. So not only
does Bobby have

think

wants

Clark

us

to

think

that
Bobby
should
die. And the
teenagers who
are victims to Bobby's tyrannyseem to see no other recourse
available to them.

The logic behind their helplessness—you have to wonder,
why the girls don't even consider
going to the police when they are
raped—comes from the Clark's

implicit premise that the teenage
world is a sex-obsessed, nihilistic
microcosm, cut off from the rest
of society as we know it. Clark's
pessimism was more plausible in
his first film, "Kids," where the

children were younger, more
urban, and apparently devoid of
parental guidance. But in
"Bully," the parents are all in
place: boring, corny, and intru-

sive with concerned eyes. The

know her very well, seeing her
being humped in the backseat of
a car, urinating naked, arching
her back during lustful intercourse. All this is well and good
for thirteen year old boys, but a
more hormonally-neutral viewer
has to wonder how any of this
flesh-fest is relevant to a movie
about a murder.
To be fair, the preliminary
scenes do go a long way to show
how the murder was possible,
perhaps even necessary, albeit in
Clark's own warped terms.
Bobby (Nick Stahl), the bully
who is eventually killed off, is
shown raping at least two girls

and physically and verbally

abusing his childhood friend
Marty (Brad Renfro). It's clear
that Clark wants us to hate
Bobby. None of the scenes seem
to suggest that within Bobby's
character lies a tortured, misun-

derstood soul. There's some evidence of repressed homosexuality, but no pathos-evoking manifestation of this repression. His
father may be a little overbearing, but so is every father at
times. Clark gives us no room to

neighborhood is normal-town
America. There are no drive-by
shootings. Even the young hitman hired to help whack Bobby
is pale, shrill, fashioning a qua£imullet. Frankly, he isn't very
scary. What is supposed to be
shocking about this story is that
it really happened, and in making it into a film, Clark took,
whether he realized it or not, the
responsibility of explaining how
these kids might have become
the way they were. But instead,
what he has given us is a meandering pack of hedonistic souls
already capable of murder, who
are conveniently willing to peal

off their clothes for Clark's directorial virtue of "frankness."
In "Kids"
a film about a
HIV-infected boy named Telly on
a quest to deflower as many girls
as possible
what was uncomfortably compelling was not the
portrayal of kids having sex. We
knew about sex. We knew about
kids having sex. It was the fact
that they engaged in it so carelessly, with disregard for the
partner and without at all considering the prospect of disease
—

and pregnancy (not to mention
the fact that there was none of
the awkwardness and fear that
we recalled from our own adolescence). When Telly's friend
Casper, along with his gang of
friends, beat another boy to a
brink of death for running into
him at a skate park, the same
effect was achieved as when
later, he thoughtlessly raped a
girl in her drug-induced sleep.
We saw no hesitation, no twinge
of regret in either cases. It was
the absence of humanity and
moral underpinnings in Clark's
characters that disturbed us, not
the incidental nudity that resulted from their actions.
But this doesn't mean that
Clark made "Kids" just to shock
us with examples of teenage
immorality. It is a hilarious
understatement to say Clark
likes young flesh, even if his love
for it is
and I doubt it
strictly aesthetic. In an earlier scene,
when a circle of adolescent girls
are discussing their personal
sexual experiences, the camera
often wanders off to explore the
contour of their thighs. In
"Bully," what is primarily supposed to shock is not the reckless
sex acts, but the remorseless
murder; so there is no longer any
artistic motive behind which
Clark's pedophilic preoccupation
can hide. Yet, he carries on with
the camera work as if he's still
filming "Kids," throwing in gratuitous groin shots and a wax-

dripping sex scene for good

measure.
The fact that "Kids" is filmed
mostly in brilliant, natural light
adds to its frightening reality.
That "Bully" has a similar look
makes you feel like you're watching an amateur porno. Because
Clark gives us little clue as to
why the kids in "Bully" are the
way they are, we cannot help but
turn to the scenes that haunt the
rest of the film: the relentless
flashes of sexuality. Take all this
into consideration, and you will
arrive at an absurdly puritanical
conclusion, though in case Clark
knows something I do not, I
advise all of you depraved students to beware: having intercourse in natural light will turn
you into a murderer.

"Bread and Tulips" delightful
take on romantic comedy
BY ESTER BLOOM
The study of human behavior or a universal phenomenon makes
some films transcendent. "The Shawshank Redemption," for example, is set in Maine and stars Tom Robbins and Morgan Freedom.
But those elements are three of any number of choices that could
have been made: as long as it features sensitive actors, it could be
set just as effectively in Sweden, Rwanda, or Memphis, Tennessee.
Conversely, some films are only enjoyable
or excusable, in the
case of "Gone With The Wind" in context. And in some cases, a
film that falls between those two extremes, one that has a by-modern-standards banal but not offensive premise, is rendered wonderfully watchable by a combination of the right setting, the right actor,
and the right touch.
"Bread and Tulips,"
an Italian film by director Silvio Soldini, is an
adorable feel-good
comedy that manages
to tell a story we've all
heard before in a way
that's just different
enough to make it
work. Rosalba (Licia
Maglietta) is an under-

utilized housewife who
finds herself by starting a new life in a new
city. She leaves
behind two teenage
sons, who are capable
of taking care of themselves, and a husband, who isn't he
has to appeal to his
mistress to iron his

Courtesy www.breadandtulips.com

The flight is not
originally Rosalba's idea. On a vacation tour, Rosalba is delayed at a
gas station because she has to rescue her wedding ring after it falls
in the toilet. When she finally emerges (successfully), it is just in time
to see the charter bus pulling away. As she mutters to herself, no

one even realizes she isn't on board.
After consenting to wait where she is for her furious husband to
find a way to come get her, she decides to hitchhike home. Her first
driver is an eccentric artist who, when she hears that Rosalba was
married at 21, said, "Wow at that age, I was in Copenhagen having
my second abortion;" and her second is an exhausted twenty-something who offers her the wheel. He's bound for Venice, where she's
never been and always wanted to go. So she takes him there.

The next day, on a whim, she obtains a
job as well, in a plant store run by an old,
grumpy anarchist with a soft spot for

flowers.
She only intends to stay in Venice for a day, but a missed train
detains her. Since her hotel shuts down and she lacks the lire for
another one, she begs help from Fernando (Bruno Ganz,) the eloquent, surly manager of her chosen restaurant. He offers her a room
in his flat. The next day, on a whim, she obtains a job as well, in a
plant store run by an old, grumpy anarchist with a soft spot for flowers.
With the addition of a new friend, her neighbor Grazia (Marina
Massironi,) a holistic masseuse, and the exchange of her awful purple-leggings-and-orange-sneaker clothing combinations for sundresses, Rosalba begins to construct a functional life for herself. Her
dreams, which appear without the benefit of segues to help the viewer distinguish between them and reality, convey some remorse, but
during her waking hours, she is too busy being happy to think about
the life she's abandoned.
Her husband, however, cannot understand this new arrangement
and finally, in frustration after his mistress refuses to take on
Rosalba's chores, hires Constantino (Giuseppe Massironi) to track
down his wife. Constantino's only qualification is his love for mystery
novels but he is determined not to let his new boss, who promises
him better employment later, down.
Hilarity ensues. As silly as the plot seems, it remains engaging,
buoyed the performances, particularly Rosalba's. She brings a freshness and an energy as well as a complexity to the role. As romantic
comedies go, it's among the best I've ever seen.

Sigur Rós:
beyond words
BY JOEL BLECHER

When my friends and I bought tickets for to see Sigur

Ros (prounounced si-ur rose) at the Theater of the Living

Arts several months ago, it was more out of curiosity than
real desire. But when we got to the show last Saturday
night, we were a little surprised at the turnout. We smirked,
immaturely pointing at the Icelandic flags some of the audience members were holding. "We came all the way from
Tennessee just to see them," I overheard a couple say
standing next us. "A friend of mine told me to go and see
them at all costs it's supposed to be life-changing." It
was a familiar tune in fact, my friend Emanuele had written me just the week before: "Sigur Ros was the most
amazing trip. It was the most stimulating vibrations I have
ever heard. They made me think and think and think. I
have no words to describe it. I know it sounds mean, but
you would not understand. Please go see Sigur Ros if they
are ever going to play near you."
"Big deal," I thought. "Who do these Icelandic hot shots
think they are?"

The drummer, Orre, had brought
six sticks with him on stage; three
of them broke, as if unable to
endure the utterly perfect rhythmic
explosions.
But the minute they walked on stage, our petty and
snide cynicism vanished. As they began to play though
the word "play" is utterly inappropriate it was as if time
and space disappeared. We were stunned, overwhelmed,
bearing witness to a small piece of eternity, a slice of a nirvana of which we had only dreamt. And we wept.
Jon, the lead singer, had a pain on his face as he sang,
as if he strained to deliver so much concentrated beauty to
us. Even his very body —so unusually thin seemed
weakened as if from transcending physical bounds too
often. His violin-like voice, singing in a language wholly his
own, put an even more angelic touch to the ensemble. He
used a cello bow to transform his guitar into an otherworldly instrument, or rather, a celestial cry. "When he had to
adjust his microphone in the middle of the third song," said
Bobby Berman 'O4, "I was so surprised. It was as if he
were actually human." When he sang through the pick-up
on his guitar, I knew that the girl with the Weezer shirt in
front of me, tears rolling down her eyes, would never listen
to Weezer again. The drummer, Orre, had brought six sticks
with him on stage; three of them broke, as if unable to
endure the utterly perfect rhythmic explosions. As the band
finished their final song (eleven songs in two hours, mostly
improvisation), they bowed. No stage banter, no jokes.
Like a serious orchestra, they played no encore; they had
said all they needed to say with their music.
After it ended, the crowd embraced one other, knowing
they had experienced something no one else could understand. Only some hazarded to put their thoughts into
words. "It was incredible," said Lisa Huang 'O2, "life-changing."

"Everything seems petty now," said Matt Rubin 'O4.
"Music, life, everything seems petty after you have an experience like this. This is the best I have ever seen. Never
has any art been so beautifully profound."
Emanuele was right to put this band into words is to
somehow compromise their infinite energy. I called him up
later that night, and he agreed. "Music," he told me, "is not
the way I think it is anymore." Sigur Ros said it themselves: "We are simply going to change music forever, and
the way people think about music. Don't think we can't do
it We will."

Women's soccer falls to Gettysburg
Team maintains confidence despite loss; player, fans ejected
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
In a game marked by off-the-field controversies, the
women's soccer team fell to Centennial Conference rival
Gettysburg by a score of 3-1 on Sept. 22. The game was marred
by ejections of fans for alcohol consumption and heckling
behavior and a red card for a Swat player, but members of the
women's soccer team chose instead to emphasize their formidable play and vast improvement from last year's crushing 82 defeat.
"We played hard and showed [Gettysburg] that
Swarthmore no longer represents an automatic win," said tricaptain Marah Gotcsik 'O2.
Gettysburg, continually ranked as one of the best teams in
the conference, had previously dominated play against the
Garnet, leading series play 12-1 since 1988.
Facing a deficit after a first half in which Gettysburg scored
two goals in three minutes, Swat escalated its offense in the
second half. Less than a minute after halftime, tri-captain
Claire Hoverman 'O3 pressured a Gettysburg player into scoring an own-goal. And though Gettysburg added an insurance
goal later in the second half, the Tide forced a save and continued to put pressure on the Gettysburg defense and goalie.
"The score does not always reflect what truly happened
the course of the game," said goalkeeper
Catherine Salussolia 'O4, who accumulated 14 saves in the
loss. "Our team played with and dominated at times one of the
top teams in the Centennial Conference."
Hoverman agreed. "We had a few mistakes and failed to
recover on a few of the attacks done by Gettysburg," she said.
"They are a good team but so are we."
"Fan behavior has gotten out of hand recently," said head
coach Amy Brunner, in response to the rowdy behavior of fans,
which included the ejection of Peppy McPepper and

"We love their presence but the cheers should be proSwarthmore and not negative toward anyone," Brunner said.
Citing the Centennial Conference statement of good sportsmanship, she said that, "People will probably say [heckling is]
part of the game, but ethically we should know better and I'd
like to think we are a more respectable lot than that."
Ele Forbes 'O5 received a yellow card for dissent and then

game and was ineligible to play in the yesterday's game

"If we continue to play with the confidence that we have

For the remainder of the game, Swat dictated
the fast-paced tempo by winning 50-50 balls and
out-hustling Ursinus. However, the Ursinus
defense kept the Swat offense at bay by doubleteaming the ever-dangerous Marty Griffith 'O5.
With wide-open space on either sideline, Swat
continued to pound the ball down the middle to
their number one weapon. The strategy finally
paid off with three minutes to play in regulation

time; after an Ursinus defender contested a ball

played down the middle, the referee whistled the
play for a Swat free kick. Sweeper MacDearmid
wrapped his twenty-five yard shot around the
three-man wall for the 2-1 win.
"It was the first game-winner of my
[Swatrthmore] career," said MacDearmid.
"After outplaying and losing to Philadelphia

said second year head coach Don Norton. "It was
our first conference win since 1998."
The squad ended its three game skid to raise
their season record to 5-5. On Sept. 29, the team

hopes to raise their record above .500 at home

versus Dickinson.

GAME OF THE WEEK

Men's and women's
soccer doubleheader
When: Saturday, Sept. 29
Where: Clothier Fields
Time: women at 11 a.m.; men at 2 p.m.
Tensions will mount this weekend as
the men's and women's soccer teams
host Centennial Conference rivals at
Clothier Fields. After shutting out its first
five opponents, the women's soccer team
allowed four goals in two consecutive
games. The women will look to regain
their defensive prowess when they battle
Washington at 11 a.m. The team is also
seeking its first conference win of the season.
At 2 p.m., the streaky men's squad will
take on conference foe Dickinson.
Although Dickinson has won the last eight
meetings between the teams, it has failed
to score in its past four games of the season. The Garnet will look to exploit the faltering Dickinson offense and improve
their own conference standing.

Strong tennis players vie for chance to compete in tournaments
BY DERRICK WU

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

tfen Rae looks to return
a serve.

Before the conclusion of the 2001 Tim Berman
Tournament, held at Swarthmore College, top-seeded Swat
tennis player John Thomas 'O2 warned that his teammate
Frank Visciano 'O4 would be this year's sleeper.
He was right. After finishing 6-0 in singles and doubles
play and racking up two first-place finishes on Sept. 22 and
23, every future opponent Visciano faces will be well aware
of the devastating game he brings to the court.
The tournament was named in honor offormer team captain Tim Berman, who died after a long battle with cancer
in 1981 and would have graduated with the class of 1982. His
legacy lives on in the annual fall tournament that fields topflight opponents from the University of Rochester and
Division I University of Delaware. This year, each team
picked up at least one title in four flights of singles matches
and two flights of doubles play.
In the A-flight, Thomas picked up two victories on
Saturday against Rochester's Dan Williford 6-4, 7-5 and
Delaware's top player Sanjay Khindri 6-4, 6-4. The next day,
he lost an early morning match to Delaware's freshman phenom John Tully, who had previously defeated Swat's second-seeded player Justin Singer 'O3, 6-2, 6-2. Tully surprised
even his teammates when he disposed of the highly regarded Thomas 6-1, 6-2. When Delaware teammate Khindri
learned of Tully's win, he asked, "How'd you do that?"
Battling weariness and noticeable disappointment,
Thomas teamed up with Visciano twenty minutes later to
rebound in the A-flight doubles final. The Swat duo made
quick work of Colin "Kobe" Ryan and Williford, defeating
Rochester's top doubles team 8-4. Thomas and Visciano used
an Australian formation that had proved effective against a
Delaware doubles team on Saturday.
The A-flight doubles victory was Viscaino's second title
in the tournament. Moments earlier, he had played against
fellow teammate Ben Rae 'O4 in the B-flight singles final.
Both players came into the match without dropping a set.
Viscaino double-bageled Rochester's Anton Orlin 6-0, 6-0.

The two teammates faced off on the first court, both playing

behind the baseline and relying on their booming forehands.
In the end, Visciano came away with the victory, 6-2, 6-3,
and the B-flight singles title. After the game, coach Mike
Mullan said he was proud of Rae's play. "Ben has really
improved over the summer," he said. "He's moving up the
ranks."
With the spring season approaching, every victory is
important for players like Rae. Only the top six Swat players get the opportunity to play every match, with the rest of
the twelve-man team filling their roles as backup players
and practice opponents.
With veterans Thomas, Singer and Jayson Yost 'O3 a lock
to make the top six, and second-year players Rae and
Visciano solidifying their positions this past weekend, other
players are informally competing for the sixth and final spot.
Since allfive bubble players who competed this weekend finished 1-1, the decision will not be easy for Mullan.
Newcomer Justin Durand 'O5 is in the hunt for the coveted sixth spot against teammates Aaron Rubin 'O4, Joey
Spadola 'O4 and Mike Noreika 'O4.
"We have a lot of depth on this team this year. There isn't
much [talent] dropoff after the top six," Joe Dickerson 'O4
said.
Despite the competition, most of the players are excited
about having a deep team. "This is the biggest team we've
had since I've been here," Thomas said. "It really helps out
everyone's play to have different people to hit around with."
With Swat's final fall tournament approaching, Mullan's
time to assess his players is running out. On Oct. 8 and 9,
Swarthmore will be hosting the Atlantic South
Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) tournament, a single-elimination 64-draw tournament.
Besides deciding on the final lineup for the spring season, Mullan is looking for his top veterans, Thomas and
Singer, to go deep into the highly competitive tournament
and Visciano to follow up on his success at this weekend's
tournament.

This week, the Garnet field hockey team's fiercest opponent has been the rain.
Twelve minutes into the game vs. Lebanon Valley on
Sept. 20, the officials called the game due to dangerous field
conditions after rain made the field too slippery for play to
continue safely.

"I thought we worked really well together against Bryn
Mawr and played as one unit. Our hard work has paid off'
said Jamie Larsen 'O5.
Although the heavens washed out two of the Garnet's
three games this week, both players,and coaches aren't
concernedthat the rhythm of the team's recent success has

Tuesday's downpour left the field hockey team with the

second cancelled game of the week. The College of Notre
Dame of Maryland's field was underwater, forcing the
Garnet to drop a non-conference game and turning practice into running on the track.
Rain even marred the one game the Garnet did play this

week. The constant downpour from earlier in the week left
standing water on the field for Saturday's game against
Bryn Mawr. The Garnet managed to adapt to the muddy
conditions to pull out a 6-0 domination of the Mawrters.
Lindsay VanSciver 'O3 started an offensive rush, assisting Kim Cariello 'O2 on a goal 11:26 into the game. One
minute and 25 seconds later, VanSciver slammed home a
pass from Alison Gaffney 'O2 to put the Garnet up 2-0. The
junior forward scored her second goal of the game 10 minutes later. The Tide tallied one more goal from Helen
Leitner 'O4, who was assisted by Ingrid Kaszas 'O3, before
heading into the half with a 4-0 lead.
Swat didn't let up, with Cariello scoring off a Gaffney
pass five minutes into the second half. Meg Woodworth 'O3
tallied one to round up the Garnet scoring rush. Both
VanSciver and Cariello finished the game with two goals
and an assist.

been disrupted.

"It's always nice to keep the flow with a game during
the week," said head coach Karen Borbee, "but I have no
doubt in our mind that the team will be ready for the
Gettysburg game [on Saturday]."
"Despite the fact that we didn't have a game early this
week, we always get up for a conference game, especially
Gettysburg," said tri-captain Katie Tarr 'O2.
The Tide travels to Gettysburg Saturday to face the
Bullets at 1 p.m. The Bullets are just one game behind the
Garnet, who are tied for fourth in the conference.
"The team knows how important this Centennial
matchup is. The Gettysburg-Swarthmore game is good
match," said Borbee. "Emotions always run high."
Although the two game cancellations leave the Tide
with two fewer games this season, it provides more opportunity for JV games to be played. NCAA regulations limit
the number of regular season games, and if a game is officially umpired, then it counts as an official game, whether
it's a school's JV or varsity team.
Although most colleges do not distinguish between varsity and JV players, often an unofficial third half will be
played to give rookies valuable game experience.
