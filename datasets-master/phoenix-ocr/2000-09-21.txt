SAC rattled by
rescinded Olde
Club job offer
BY IVAN BOOTHE
As Student Council considers applicants for three
appointments to the Social Affairs Committee this week,
questions arise about the committee's handling of the
Olde Club appointments process last spring.
SAC, which oversees the popular musical venue, initiated the appointments process for the club's director
and managers after some students had already left for
the semester. Problems continued throughout the appointments process, and after SAC's co-chairs realized
that they could not adequately fund two Olde Club cochair salaries, one job offer was rescinded.
Marie Abe 'Ol, who was appointed Olde Club co-director by SAC late last spring, was told weeks later that
she would not be hired.

A troubled history
SAC co-chairs Rodney Morris 'Ol and Chris Sajdera
'Ol, appointed by Student Council April 1 for the current academic year, were responsible for hosting the
Spring Fling and then appointing the 2000-2001 directors for Olde Club. Spring Fling went off without a hitch,
but by the time SAC requested applications for the Olde

Club position, final exams were about to begin.
"Honestly," Morris said, "Chris and I forgot." The
planning of Spring Fling was very complicated, he explained, because of the college's strict rules on the contract with the company SAC had hired for the event. "It
was probably 20 hours a week dealing with that," he
said.
Andy Smith 'Ol, last year's Olde Club director, raised
concerns about the late application process with the
SAC chairs, Morris and Sajdera, as well as with thenSAC coordinator and Director of Student Activities
Davirah Timm-Dinkins. By the time they released the
applications, Smith said, "one of our managers was already at home for the summer."
The director is responsible for lining up musical
groups to perform at the college. There havebeen problems with the Olde Club application process for several
years, Smith said, explaining that graduating directors
often fail to show up at the spring budgeting meetings
since they know they aren't returning in the fall.
Despite Smith's complaints, however, the SAC
chairs did not seem to be responding. "They seemed to
just be putting it off," he said.
The application process, Smith said, was also problematic. "Most of the time, applicants turn in a platform, but this year they didn't do that, they just asked
some brief questions."
After the two SAC chairs discussed the applicants
with Timm-Dinkins, they made the decision to appoint
two co-directors for Olde Club: Smith, who had applied
for the position for a second year, and Abe. "We wanted
to appoint two directors, because [Smith] has a good
background in indie rock and [Abe] has a good background in jazz, which would have meant a more variety of events," Sajdera said.
Morris agreed. "Last year we were really enthusiastic about having two directors."
So was Abe. "I had all these thoughts and energy,
and I was establishing connections with artists and
musicians in New York and Tokyo," she said.

Student storage areas in dorms, including this room in the basement of Willets, have been overcrowded and trashed
for many years. After local fire marshals made an inspection, the college has been forced to start cleaning them up.

Storage called fire hazard
BY

JON

EHRENFELD

Following an inspection by the local fire marshals, the
college has begun strictly enforcing rules concerning storage at the dorms. With the assistance of the residential
assistants and the department of facilities management,
all the dorms will be inspected and made to conform to the
rules by mid-October.
Earlier this week, the office ofDean MyrtWestphal was
notified that the fire marshals had found the existing storage spaces in some of the dorms to be inadequate, posing a
fire hazard to students. The marshals cited clutter and
boxes on the floor, bicycles tied up in the hallways, and
discarded furniture in the hallways.

The existing rules regarding storage state that all college
furniture must be in students' rooms, and non-college furniture may not be placed in common areas. In addition, bikes
must be stored either on the racks or in approved indoor storage spaces. Within the storage spaces, all items must be boxed
and labeled on shelves to avoid the current cluttered state of
the storage rooms.
Wharton has already begun to comply with the existing
and new storage rules to prepare for a visit by the Board of
Managers, and other dorms will follow. On October 2, items
stored in inappropriate places will start being removed from

all dorms, and, on October 16, the storage areas of all dorms

New drive fails; SCCS loses data
BY DANNY GUEVARA
The Swarthmore College Computing Society (SCCS) this summer lost

user data for the first time in its history, following the rapid deterioration ofa newly-purchased 18-gigabyte
disk. To prevent future loss, SCCS has
revamped its strategy for backing up
user and organization HTML files.
According to SCCS president Tom
Stepleton 'O2, the failure came during
the a time of the year when no system administrators were available on
campus. All users and organizations
were unable to access their files for
two weeks near the end of the summer. In addition, users who created
new content between the last backup
and the disk crash lost data.

Joshua Shakin 'O2 had designed his

entire web site in the month prior to the
crash. He lost the seven main HTML
documents that comprised his site. "I did
not back up my HTML files for two reasons," he said. "First, I had created them

during a short period of time. And secand it is
ond, it was my expectation
almost always the case—that any server
with a reasonable amount of traffic
would be backed up at least every week,
if not every day."
While Shakin has already replaced
the lost content on his page, he is considering hosting his site somewhere else
unless changes are made.
"I believe the college should bring at
least one paid staff member on board to

See SCCS, pg. 6

Rescinding the decision
After a hard drive crash this summer,
SCCS lost the current Web pages of
many campus organizations, including
its own. Its main site now reflects the
design of two years ago and notes to
the world that the page was last
modified on "November 16,1998."

Soon after the decision to hire two directors, SAC
ran into the problem of budgeting for a second director.
"The Student Budget Committee (SBC) allocates a set
amount for a director's salary, and while SAC is free to
hire as many directors as it wishes, the salary allocation must be split evenly among them.
"Unfortunately, we weren't able to get enough money

'Offensive' e-mail
list circulated
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Last Thursday, recipients of the reserved-students
mailing list which sends bulk e-mails to everyone
with a Swarthmore account
found a list of slang
words for female genitalia in their mailboxes.
Philosophy professor Richard Schuldenfrei had

found the list on a blackboard in his classroom with
the instructions "do not erase" written above. The
list had been created in the "Topics in Human Sexuality" class, a student and therapist-facilitated course
whose aim is to raise individuals' awareness of sexuality in their daily lives. He explained in the e-mail
that he sent it out because he needed to use the blackboard space it occupied but was unsure who needed
it.
Schuldenfrei sent the list to everyone on campus with the warning, "THISLIST MAY OFFENSIVE
[sic], so I suggest that people who do not need this
list may not want to look at it."
Schuldenfrei did notrespond to requests for comment.

Most students were either indifferent to the list
or found it humorous. "There were some names on
it that I'd never heard of, so it was educational in
that sense," said Dave Thomas 'O2. Heather Fleharty
'O3 wondered, "Why wasn't there a male list?"
Seth Sias 'O4, who used the classroom for SAT tutoring last week, said that there was a male list but
that Schuldenfrei had not needed to erase it. "It's
fine that he sent out the list in the way he did, warning the students," said Sias, "but wouldn't there have
been some other way to deal with it?"
Some students, however, took a more adamantly
offended stance. Steve Salter 'O2 described
Schuldenfrei's mailing as "total abuse" of the reserved students system. "It was totally inappropriate for a reserved students e-mail," he said. "It was
unbelievable."

Sexuality class given PE credit
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
To the delight of its coordinators and the confusion of some
athletic personnel, students are now able to obtain physical education credit for the Topics in Human Sexuality program.
Although the course has been available as a student-run program since 1978, when it was created by therapists trained in
marriage counseling, it has until now not been offered for credit.
According to Director ofWorth Health CenterLinda Echols, this
has created a problem in terms of both enrollment and consistency.

"[The coordinators] were looking for some incentive for people
to finish the course," she said. In the past, it was also often difficult to draw students to the class without the motivation of receiving credit.
Also, because they were not receiving recognition for their
participation, the number of students who continued to come to
class would taper off near the end of the course.

Mike Pasahow Phoenix Staff

So far, the granting of P.E. credit has served its purpose. Enrollment for the course is up from 40 students last year to about
60 this semester.
Bryn Mawr and Haverford offer physical education credit for
the course through their wellness program, which does not require physical activity but instead focuses on health issues. According to Echols, the course is so popular there that itis lotteried.
Swarthmore introduced the program to various universities
and organizations in the area 22 years ago in order to raise
people's awareness about their sexuality and the way it fits into
their everyday lives.
Although the program's coordinators are the brains behind
the operation, Topics in Human Sexuality is entirely student-run.
During class, the participants watch mostly silent videos on a
range of subjects from homosexuality to masturbation to relationships to rape and assault, according to Pulver.
Afterwards, participants split into smaller discussion groups,
where they focus on how the films' contents relate to their own
sexualities. Although the class does address safe sex, the broad
range of its curriculum makes it very different from a sex education course.
The question of exactly whatmakes Topics in Human Sexuality worthy of physical education credit has been subject to debate since the idea was first raised by the coordinators. When

Therapists serve a program coordinators for Topics in
Human Sexuality while the class itself is student-run.
Ms. Echols communicatedthe idea to Michael Mullen, professor of physical education and athletics, he was "dubious at first," she said, because he was used to receiving
requests for RE. credit for activities that "involve very
little physical movement."
After Dean of the College Bob Gross made it clear that
he favored the idea, however, Mullen decided to support

it, too—provided that some physical activity be incorpo-

rated into the course.
"We're not sure exactly what that activity will be," said
Echols. "It could be walking, it could be playing games.
It's only been a week since we've known this."
Because the offering ofcredit is a recent development,
confusion remains about the details surrounding the de-

cision.
Adrienne Shibles, the de facto director of the P.E. program while Mullen is on sabbatical, said she wasn't really sure when the credit had been granted and even
whether or not Mullen had agreed to give credit for the
course before he left.

explained Kidwell. "People just assume things are going to get done.
We are well taken care of here on
campus."

Student Council, however, remains optimistic. In recent months
the organization has made several
strides in establishing its authority,
one of the most significant of which
was the decision to use Sharpies 111
as art space. The organization's next
major project is the remaking of the
game room, and they are planning
to hold a referendum on the issue
in approximately a month and a
half.
"Every government is faced with
the problem of apathy at some point
in time," commented Brandon
Silverman 'Ol, former Student Council. He added, "Interest is dramatically on the rise. This semester is
marked with the least amount of
apathy."

cisions are most often reached through
consensus, theirroles on some of the committees, especially those dealing with issues pertaining to student life, often have
an impact.
Delonte Gholston 'O2, student observer
to the board, said, "My role would be more
effective if there were a more adequate way
for me to advocate students needs."
Gholstonalso said,"lt is amazing to see the
degree of interest of board members have
in the concerns of the current student."

Student questioned by police
Swarthmore borough police
drove onto Parrish beach last
night to stop a student who fit the
description of a suspect in recent
sexual assaults.
Kevin Setter 'O2 was informed
by two officers that they had already apprehended a suspect in
connection with the assaults,
which were reported in the past
few weeks by various females at
several different locations near
campus, but that they "needed

more people for the lineup."
Setter said the officers selected him because he matched
the description provided them by
the victims. Specifically, Setter
said the officers "needed people
with hair like mine."
After questioning Setter
about his contact information

who said she had spotted the

SC discusses bandwidth, storage issues
Student Council discussed but took
little action on Internet bandwidth limits,
dorm storage problems, and concerns
about Swarthmore Borough Police at its
meeting last Monday.
Student representative Will Ortman 'O2
expressed concern about the Internet bandwidth limits imposed last week by the Computing Center, claiming that the new limits have made the Internet slow.
Ortman criticized the implementation
of such drastic measures. "Imposing a major change in an important college service
without fully consulting the student body
is a blatant disregard for student concerns," he said.
Other council members, however, mentioned that the faculty strongly supports

the speed limit and may oppose efforts to overturn the decision.
Council members also recognized the
safety problems with dorm storage but did not
recommend action on the matter.
The council did decide, however, to look
into complaints that Swarthmore borough
police were butting heads with the campus
Public Safety. According to council members,
although the borough police have agreed that
Public Safety has jurisdiction over the campus, some students have claimed that police
have been coming on campus more often.
The council decided to determinewhat students' legal rights are, and possibly to meet
with police representatives to determine if
there is any validity to these claims.

There was once a perception thatPaces,
the student-run cafe sandwiched behind
Essie Mae's, was for the tragically hip
hip, because it served minimal amounts of
food to minimal amounts of customers at
maximal waits; and tragic, because this is
Swarthmore, and Paces was as hip as it got.
Lisa Adler 'Ol and JohnPaul Christy 'Ol,
Paces co-directors for 2000-20001, hope to
change that. And as Paces opened Sunday
to a full house of hipsters and non-hipsters
alike, it appeared that maybe they already
have.
As a lone weekday refuge in a school
with little effective student space and limited dining hall hours, the cafe has the potential to become a space accessible to all

to lines trailing out the door. Adler and
Christy plan to return to thisother history
of Paces through revamping the management techniques used for the business,
which is subsidized by college funds, and
in the process make the cafe into a more
inviting place.
"The perpetual complaint about Paces
is that the staff is inattentive and not welcoming," Christy said. "We don't want anybody to feel like he or she's been ignored
or that they are unwanted in the cafe."
He added that part of the solution to
increasing Paces' draw lies in changing the
makeup of its staff. In making hiring decisions, he said, "We had an image in mind
of our ideal Paces staff, one thatwould look

According to Christy, the co-directors'

does have a reputation for hiring hip
people," he said.
In addition to working to change the
makeup of the staff, the co-directors also
plan to cut back on losses. Though subsidized, the cafe has in the past few years
consistently run over its budget.
"Because the college has always realized that the cafe has a pretty important
role in student life and has cut it a great
deal of slack, the deficit has never been a
big issue. But Lisa and I very much want
to work within it," Christy said.
Adler was more emphatic. "Our number one concern right now is our budget,"

more like the student body of Swarthmore."
Jae Won Chung 'O2, one of the new waiters hired, agreed that the Paces staffhasn't
always fulfilled that qualification. "Paces

ing freshman," Adler said. "Last year a lot

of freshmen didn't know Paces existed."
To do that, they plan to advertise and
improve service. "There was a lot of complaints about poor service, so we're hounding our staff on that," Adler said.
As Paces opened Sunday night
two
weeks earlier than it opened last year
Adler's and Christy's efforts seemed to pay
off. Customers waited at the door to find
seats as staff struggled to avoid running
out offood.
Adler attributed the rush to the offering offree coffee. The rest of the week saw
noticeably smallercrowds. On Monday and
Tuesday business didn't pick up until 10:30,
an hour and half after opening.
But the changed service is enough to
keep Lashanna Lawler 'O2 coming back.
"Even on Sunday, when there were a lot of
people here, it was still pretty speedy," she
said. "I got what I wanted within a decent

SAC rescinded Olde Club job offer

to pay both directors," said Sajdera.

Abe, however, believes this was mostly a function of the lateness of the
application process itself. "Because they had waited so long, [the application
process] was after the Budget Committee had met," she said.
Smith also questioned the process. "It looked to me like they just didn't
want to make a decision," he said. "It was not thought out; what this would
mean with the budget cuts, having two directors."
Morris and Sajdera originally told Abe and Smith that they would share
the usual director's salary. Abe was comfortable with that, but Smith took a
different view. "It wouldn't cut down on the workload to have two directors,
like they thought. Most of the work is in the pre-production of the shows, and

that doesn't decrease much even with fewer shows," he said.
By the time the salary issue was addressed, exam week was over, and
Sajdera had already left for the summer. Smith spoke with the remaining
SAC chair, Morris, about the decision. "I pointed out that the directors would
actually be paid less than the managers," he said. Olde Club managers are
responsible for scheduling, cleaning and managing funds.
Abe also met with Morris, who suggested to her that SAC might be able to
acquire $2OO to $3OO more and appoint Abe Olde Club manager with Smith as
the director. "I wanted to bring about change, though," said Abe, "and as
manager I didn't think I'd really have the power to do so."
After a couple of weeks of consideration, the SAC chairs chose Smith to
become the 2000-01 Olde Club director, effectively rescinding their previous

job offer to Abe.
"We were at a loss. They were both very qualified. But for several reasons, we chose [Smith]," said Sajdera. "[He] had the job before, and was the
manager before that."
Sajdera is hopeful about having two Olde Club directors in the future,
when the budget allows for it. "I'm hoping that the SAC directors of the future will honestly consider co-directors. It would create a wider range for

Olde Club, and it would also be more efficient with two directors. There are
also possibilities for specialized directors."

Dorm storage cited as hazard, will be cleaned
From STORAGE, pg. 3

will begin to be cleaned out. Students will incur fines ofup to $25
for furniture and bikes stored
incorrectly.
In addition to the fire and

health hazards that the im-

proper storage of items pose, the

college's insurance cost for
dorms will go up if the problem
is not rectified.
In light of student complains
and the recent events, Dean
Westphal and the facilities department have begun consider-

ing ways to improve the storage
situation. In the future, a quota
on stored items may be implemented, limiting students to
three. By maximizing existing
storage areas, the college will
have to build as few new areas
as possible. Also, Dean Westphal

noted, locked storage areas
which are off the main college
key system have proved effective, and more are being considered. Ifonly the student and one
RA per dorm have the keys to
the storage areas, thefts such as
the ones thatoccurred this sum-

mer can be reduced.
At present, there are no definitive plans to create new storage spaces. Dean Westphal and
members ofthe facilities department have been meeting over
the past few weeks and will continue to meet to discuss storage.
Until now, the topic of conversation has chiefly concerned
how to eliminate what Vice
President Larry Schall termed
"a fairly serious situation which
created a hazard to students,"
but may soon turn towards the
creation of new storage.

SCCS hard drive fails; many web pages lost

work with SCCS and be held accountable," he said.
"The SCCS system administrators cannot be expected to do the amount of work they do and deal
with situations such as this one without being
paid."

A similar incident occurred in the summer of

1998, when a disk containing the operating system for the SCCS login server crashed during a
severe power failure. At the time, users went without any access to SCCS computers for weeks, but
all data was eventually recovered.
"While there [were] certainly far more badfeel-

ings created by the lack of e-mail access during
the 1998 crash," said Stepleton, "this current crash

troubles me more."
But SCCS has changed its backup procedure
to ensure no similar loss in the future.
"While we can't ensure full data safety [and] a
fire in Parrish would still be somewhat though
not completely
devastating, we're otherwise
quite confident that we'll never have this problem again," Stepleton said.
The faulty disk is now at a lab. Data recovery
is very expensive; in this case, SCCS would be
charged $4,300, even for only a partial data recovery.

Looking beyond the appointments
While Abe said harbors no resentment and remains supportive of Smith,
she does wish the process had been handled better. "I thought that [Smith]
could have done one semester, and maybe I could have done the next. I know
that SAC had so many things in their head, but they needed to remember to
open the position, preferably before the budget committee meeting."
Olde Club manager Latika Young 'O2 agreed. "The hiring process [of Olde
Club director] was kind of unusual it wasn't coordinated very well," she
said. "I think they were kind ofrushed to do the whole thing, and they thought
they were doing the right thing, but they hadn't thought it through clearly.
They need to be really clear about if they have the funds for two directors."
Smith questioned the tenuous connections between SAC and Olde Club,
proposing that the two have different objectives. "SAC has a different meaning of the function ofOlde Club," he said. "SAC has concerns like large atten-

lion ur student loan
and is is where your

ISTDRV

dance and accessibility to students." Traditionally, he explained, Olde Club

was separate from the college party scene.
"I don't look at a band and think, 'This band is going to bring in a lot of
people'; I think, 'This is a good band.' And that'skind of at odds with SAC,"
he said. Smith did not, however, fault SAC for this, explaining that social
events are the committee's job.
Smith also described ideas that SAC members had about which deejays to
bring to Olde Club. While Olde Club has hired deejays before, he explained
that those musicians' styles were markedly different from the styles of the
deejays proposed by SAC. "Our deejays aren't going to be playing dance
music," Smith said. "There is definitely a demand for that, but it should just
be through another organization whose focus is on that." Alternatively, he
said, SAC could create a second directorship to address this type of demand,
but only with "a fairly drastic expansion of the budget."
Morris, however, maintained that SAC and Olde Club are appropriately
connected. SAC, said Morris, "is responsible for providing social activities
for the whole student body."
He added that all students should feel like SAC sponsors a social activity
that they would enjoy. "The funds for Olde Club come from Student Council.
From SAC, we can see the puzzle from above, and everything has to fit together. We have to be diverse with a limited number of resources," Morris
explained. Ultimately, that may mean compromise for Olde Club.
Or, alternately, perhaps the new SAC members appointed this week by
Student Council will work to bring reform to the committee. Last spring's
Olde Club appointments suggest that most decision-making power rests with
the committee's chairs. The two SAC members interviewed for this story,
Jeremy Schiefling 'O3 and Erica Rosenthal 'Ol, were not aware that SAC and
Olde Club are in any way connected, let alone that the committee had hired
co-directors for the venue.
For the most part, the committee itself concerns itselfwith planning allcampus parties and other one-time social events. But on the rare occasions

when it deals with larger events such as the Olde Club appointments, more
than one person would like to see it handle its application processes more

smoothly.

"It wasn't the most ideal time to solve that situation," Abe says, about the
Olde Club appointments last year. She adds, "the final exam period was definitely bad."

Dissident speaks tonight

Singers tell Penn to ban Napster

BY GERRIT HALL

BY ALEXIS GILBERT AND MICHAEL SONSINO
The Daily Pennsylvanian

Elena Bonner, a former Soviet dissident and widow of Nobel Peace
Prize Laureate Andrei Sakharov, will
speak in the Lang Performing Arts
Center today at 7:30 p.m.

The Russian Club spearheaded the
effort to bring Bonner to
Swarthmore.
"She's one of the few representatives in this generation who speaks
with such moral authority," said Ira
Lindsay 'OL president of the Russian
Club. "Elena Bonner is really a huge
figure."
Bonner served as a doctor before
becoming active in the Soviet dissident movement of the '6os.
In 1972, she met Andrei Sakharov,
who helped develop the Soviet

Union's first H-Bomb but later became an outspoken opponent of Soviet human rights abuses.
"Bonner's late husband was really
the leading Soviet dissident in the
'7os," Lindsay said.
The two were imprisoned, but
later released during the Gorbachev

reforms.

After Sakharov's death in 1989,
Bonner carried on his legacy, speaking against the war in Chechnya, Russian breaches of free speech, and
Putin's regime.

Former Soviet dissident Elena Bonner
will discuss the role of human rights
activists during her speech tonight.
The Russian Club began looking for
a speaker last winter.
When they heard Bonner was in the
country, they successfully contactedher
through her daughter.

When she speaks at Swarthmore,
she is expected to talk about the

changing role ofhuman rights activists, and the challenges facing the
post-Soviet world.

A Semester
ALMOST Abroad

(U-WIRE) On Sept. 12, the University ofPennsylvania became the latest on a long list of universities that have been dragged into the controversy surrounding the Internet music site
Napster.
Attorneys for the heavy metal band Metallica
and rap artist Dr. Dre sent a letter to University
of Pennsylvania President JudithRodin requesting that the University ban access through its
Internet service to Napster. The artists havebeen
vocal critics of Napster, a service that allows its
users to share downloadable music files.
The University has been given until Friday to
respond to the request. University spokeswoman
Phyllis Holtzman declined to comment on the letter last week.
The Recording Industry Association of
America
an organization representing major
recording labels
first filed a suit against
Napster in December, charging the company with
violating copyright laws.
The court issued an injunction over the summer ordering Napster to shut down until the suit
was decided, but Napster successfully appealed
the ruling. The suit is currently in the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Earlier this year, a similar suit was filed by
numerous record companies, and many Web sites
similar to Napster have settled suits filed against

them.

Penn is just one of many universities across
the country to receive a letter from the musicians.
However, the University of Southern California
and Indiana and Yale universities were sued aiong
with Napster when they failed to comply last
spring withthe requests ofMetallica and Dr. Dre.
Howard King, attorney for the two artists, said

STUDY

Program

that other suits could still be filed.
The attorney made it clear that the letter
sent to Rodin was not intended as a threat, but
a copy of the original Napster lawsuit and the
suit filed against USC, Indiana and Yale were
included with the letter.
In addition, the musicians' lawsuit against
Napster includes a clause that reserves a place
for universities to be added.
King explained that his clients are targeting universities in particular because they "are
a hotbed ofNapster usage," especially because
colleges often "provide high-speed Internet
connections."

King said only about 20 universities representing a broad geographical cross-section
would be directly asked to address the Napster

issue on theircampuses.
He added that all his clients are asking for
is a "full and fair discussion of the issue, with
respect to the universities." And this goal can
be pursued, he added, without suing 300 universities.
Harvard University received a similar letter from the musicians recently but has not
officially responded. Harvard spokesman Joe
Wrinn said the school will not be intimidated
by the possibility of a lawsuit.

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

SC reform needed
It's election season again, and the campaign
themes are familiar. The major candidates, seeking
swing voters, seek neutral positions and make
promises on which they often can't deliver.
The candidates might be ones you know well
George Bush and Al Gore but for eight Swatties,
Election Day isn't far off. They are running for positions
on Student Council and on the College Judiciary
Committee, and they're looking for your votes.
Historically, turnout in student elections here has
been about as low as it will be across the country this
November. That seeming lack of interest among many
members of the student body is just one of the
challenges that Student Council faces. It is one of the
reasons it is important to elect candidates willing to
work with the current sitting members of the council

to reform the body.
In addition to the lack of student body interest,
Student Council has sometimes also had to deal with

a lack of commitment on the part of its members. Its
structure which includes two co-chairs elected by
the council means the co-chairs often end up
pulling most of the weight, in an often thankless
volunteer position, on behalf of their fellow students.
Another recurring problem is that council members
do not each represent some constituency of students,
and so the council has to struggle to discover the
goals and desires of the student body as a whole.
This semester, the council is beginning to discuss
reform. The structure may change slightly like
adding direct election of co-chairs by the student body
or drastically, for example by creating a paid,
elected "executive branch" of government to take over
some of the workload.
But no matter what form they take, changes in
Student Council would almost certainly improve its
ability to connect with the student body and accomplish the goals it sets for itself. Creating a draft of the
constitutional changes should be a high priority for
current members of the council
as well as the ones
we elect next week.

Monkeying around
Swarthmore is being plagued by a new breed of
animal: the Love Monkey. Maybe you've been tapped
by the Love Monkey, or maybe you've only heard of it.
What is the Love Monkey, you ask? It's the Daily
Jolt's new "great way to find out if that guy or gal you've
had your eye on likes you too." Here's how it works: you
tell theLove Monkey the e-mail addresses of anyone you
like or "just want to get to know better." All of those
people receive an e-mail from it telling them that
someone likes them. When they give the Love Monkey
their list, it will tell you both if you list each other.
It's not too sophisticated, but the Love Monkey has
grown perversely popular in its short time here.
Why? Because the Love Monkey is like a computer
confidante, the middle-school friend who would pass
your love note to your crush in seventh-grade English
class. Too shy to ask someone out? Use the Love
Monkey! Too shy to ask someone to ask someone out
for you? Use the Love Monkey! Embarassment-free
hooking up
what could be better?
A lot of things, actually. Are we Swatties so afraid
of rejection that we must resort to the anonymity of
our computers to help us to perform the most basic of
young adult rituals? Are we so socially inept that we
turn to a nonexistent primate for relationship help?
In all seriousness, the singles and relationship scene
at Swarthmore is dismal enough without people trying
to hook up from behind a monitor. Have you ever been
anywhere else with a higher concentration of depressed,
sexually frustrated and lonely college students?
So we might not have the best circumstances to
work with, but that doesn't mean you should entrust
your love life to a computer ape from junior high. Ask
out that person you've had your eye on forever, in
person. It won't hurt as bad as you think it will.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR-

What I would do with the endowment
Dear Editor:
What would you do with a billion dollars, or more importantly, what wouldn'tyou do? It seems as though Swarthmore
doesn't do much. With money pouring out of administrators' pants pockets, many students can be heard complaining about the school's miserly ways.
Sure, we all wish that the school would open up its overstuffed wallet and pay for more parking (possibly replacing
one of the lots with a multi-story underground parking complex), refurbish the dorms (have you walked into Willets
recently?) or further reduce the cost of tuition (one imagines that the interest on $714,000 per student could make a
dent). But we also understand that the endowment is being
put to very good and expensive uses such as paid internships, study abroad programs, financial aid, and more professors, not to mention endowment-building so future
Swatties can feel as unappreciated as we do.
But I fail to understand why the money from the endowment isn't used to pay for the little and inexpensive things
that would make all of our lives significantly better. So I
compiled a list of cheap but dramatic improvements that
should be made.

L Paper towels in the bathrooms (I like dry hands, don'tyou?)
2. Free laundry (Bryn Mawr does it and they don't even have
a billion dollars. Do they really need our 75 cents a load?)
3. Coffee available late at night (Who goes to bed at 10?)
4. Something like a 24-hour Wawa (Possibly out of the school
store?)
5. New pool cues and balls for the refurbished pool tables

now in Tarble
6. Fix the change machine in Parrish (this is just annoying)
7. Have Tarble accept past meal credits after mealtimes have
passed (I feel robbed whenever I sleep late)
8. Air-condition Sharpies (like every other college in the
world)
9. Add some bandwidth (it is not as expensive as the college

makes it seem)
10. Makecable available to everyone (run the lines to all the
rooms and give students the option to pay for service)
1L Two-ply toiletpaper
12. And on a personal note, I would like to ask the administration to put soap in the left-hand soap dispenser in the
bathrooms on Wharton AB Second.

Snotty Swatties: a lesson in manners
BY MORGHAN HOLT
Working at a local restaurant, I interact with hundreds of
customers personally on a daily basis. I deal with people who
stiff my tip, complain about their food, or simply rag on me
for the duration of their meal. I can handle it; in fact, I've
come to expect it. It's just part of the job.
Recently, I waited on a large group ofSwarthmore women.
I'm ashamed to say that this was the worst bunch I've encountered since I've had the job. So my co-workers haven't all
graduated from high school, and they're certainly not a part
of our elitist clique, but thatdoesn't negate the fact that they're

still human.

They're people, too, you know.
Which is why I was so disgusted by these girls' behavior.
Not realizing that they, just like our scads of other patrons,
had to wait in line for a table, they pitched a fit, saying that
they, as a large party, deserved to be seated first. After all,
they said, they were a group from Swarthmore College. Didn't
that entitle them to a little special treatment (which, as their
meals progressed, extended to everything from free desserts
to a group discount)? And that's not all: these wonderful
women complained throughout their meals, rolled their eyes
at my fellow waiters and were as rude as they could possibly

be.

Give me a break, ladies, I thought, as I sloughed away their
plates and scraps, cleaned their messes and refilled their
drinks. This is the real world, not the sanctity of your
Swarthmore bubble. Nobody cares out here where you go to
school. It makes no difference to them and it sure doesn't vali-

date you, much less warrant special treatment.
When the group finally finished theirmeals and left, leaving a measly, degrading tip in their wake, my co-workers

turned to each other, exchanging disgusted comments about
the girls' behavior and their need to de-validate other people.
Then, they began linking the girls to Swarthmore, dissing the
school for its inconsiderate students. Realizing that I too, am
a Swattie, they quickly began apologizing. And I turned their
apologies away. They didn't need to apologize. I did.
For the first time since I've been at Swat, I was ashamed to
be a Swattie. I was ashamed to be associated with a group of
completely arrogant, self-inflated people, reputed for their atrocious, snooty public displays.
I'm sure restaurant workers are not the only people who've
borne the brunt of Swarthmore's haughtiness. I'd hate to be a
mouse in the pocket of one such behaviorally impaired
Swarthmore student. I'd have to kill myself before my own
conscience did.
Next time you're in a public place, check yourself and your
attitude. You are not better than the chick behind the counter
because you go to Swarthmore. You are not more of a person
than the man toting your luggage. If anything, he's got one up
on you for humbling himself enough to do your lousy task.
Above all, if you insist upon publicly broadcasting your
position in the top tier, at least act like you deserve to be there.
Be mindful of the effect your behavior has on Swarthmore
College as an institution, then ask yourself if that's how the
student body would really want to be represented. As much
as intelligence is emphasized within our little utopic
brainland, it's definitely not everything.

For the freshmen who are new, there are five club sports
at Swat: men's volleyball, men's and women's ultimate frisbee,
and men's and women's rugby. What qualifies a sport to receive recognition from the school as a varsity sport is beyond
me (i.e., no one seems to know), but I do know this: none of
these sports receives a dimefrom the athletic department.
Every dollar these sports spend must either be given by
the SBC or be raised by the teams themselves. Anyone go to

The only solution that seems left is for the college to at least
partially fund the sports with a line item in the official college
budget. Fifty thousand dollars a year is more than all the club
sports together receive now and would represent one-sixth of
one percent of the college's interest from the endowment.
What this college needs is a representative on the College
Budget Committee (CBC) who has the experience within the
college and the relationships necessary with the president,
deans and members of the Board of Managers to make sure
this idea gets at least a fair hearing.

Not all carnivores cruel to animals

Inspired by John Dolan's article encouraging more activity out of some of
us larval Swatties, I've decided to respond to the article promoting the new

that just about every animal eats every

Admissions
process needs
improvement
Most students here are required to go through an
interview process, the sole purpose of this, of course,
being to provide employment for admissions fellows,
as present company will attest to the fact that neither a lack of social graces nor an inability to express
oneself clearly is grounds for exclusion from further
consideration.
Thus, I propose that the interview become more
like a secondary entrance exam, with the question
as follows: do you have the tools to survive
Swarthmore?
Step one: Distractions. All prospective students are
required to have the normal interview portion of the
admissions cycle conducted during either (a) the Dash
for Cash or (b) the last ten minutes of any party held
by a club team with a propensity for nudity:
"What are your favorite subjects in high school?
By the way, you got a dollar?"
"Uh, yeah, here. Well, I really enjoyed my AP bio...
Uh..."
"Yeah, she works out."
Or:
"So, do you have any idea what your major might
be?"
"Well, I am interested in neo-Marxi... I didn't think
you could fit that there."

I

NEITHER A LACK OF SOCIAL GRACES
NOR AN INABILITY TO EXPRESS ONESELF CLEARLY IS GROUNDS FOR EXCLUSION FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

These are the times that try men's souls.
The second leg of our admissions triathalon takes
place in Sharpies. This is not a required event like
the previous one, but nonetheless it should not be
taken lightly.
At this station, you are required to sit no more
than five feet from another person eating and try simultaneously to read whatever he's reading and not
have him look at you with that look that says, "Stop
reading what I'm reading. Not only do you not understand the difference between a tau meson and an
up quark, but you really, really need to wipe cranberry sauce off your mouth."
This is obviously a skill more useful to those occupying the minor rooms of Sharpies, but every little
point counts, people. The Bulgarians are very strong
this year.
And finally, the elimination round. The admissions equivalent ofthe pommelhorse, but without the
sexual connotations, is the required word event. In
this event, you are surrounded by four students, two
Swarthmore students and two other high-schoolers,
of undisclosed academic backgrounds, and you are
required to contribute to a conversation on one or
more of the following topics: post-structuralism, the
phenomenology of the Spirit, why Plato is wrong,
inventory evaluation, Sharpies food, ethnography, or
what happened to POG (pineapple-orange-guava
juice). While so doing, you must use at least three of
the following words: amenable, anathema, a priori,
zafig, mandala, docetic, or infrastructure. The first
one correctly recognized as a non-Swarthmore student is immediately put on the waiting list.
With this plan, not only will we spice up the admissions process, but, with the lawsuits we can generate, it'll only be a matter of timebefore we get that
endowment back to levels under the solid metal currency holdings of most third-world nations.

of his mouth are "I'm for the People, They're for the Powerful." He even told Oprah that one, and she's one of the
powerful. Too many signs that Gore is stiffening up again,
can't dance the macarena? He'll change into some earth
tones and roar, "I Want to Fight for You."
Oh, brother. Six and a half weeks to go till Election Day.
Thank goodness I found a couple of guys to help me sort
through all this muck. Dave Thomas 'O2, president of the
Swarthmore College Republicans, and Delonte Gholston
'O2, president of the Swarthmore College Democrats, think
there's more to the campaign catchphrases than alliteration and rhythm. In fact
if you're inclined to believe

these clowns

the words behind the Gore-Bush face-off
might actually mean something.
On "Compassionate Conservatism"

Dave Thomas (GOP): It's the same thing as conservatism, but it's a way of saying conservatives don't hate normal people. I guess it's a way of rephrasing something that
Republicans all believe but that nobody else seems to buy.
Conservatives really do want what's best for the country
There's been this perception that Republicans are somehow smart and more efficient but mean about it.
Delonte Gholston (Dems): I appreciate the political
maneuvering Bush seems to be accomplishing here.... Overall, I commend him for using the new language. If campaigns were actually about ideas and issues, that would be
a good start. But campaigns almost always go negative,
which is why Bush's compassion has come into question
in recent weeks with his attacks on Gore.
...

On "Real Plans for Real People"
Thomas: "Real Plans for Real People" is essentially saying, the Republican Party isn't just the party of the rich....
Obviously people vote Republican who aren't rich. So this is

Sound bites more
than you can chew
a way of saying to the swing voters: Look at our solutions, we
think they work for everyone.... "Real people" is also about what
kind of person George W. Bush is. I think that George Bush is
much more like the average American voter than Al Gore is.
Gholston: It's much more necessary for Gore to show his
humanity and that he can communicate to every kind of
American than it is for Bush. He doesn't have to work hard to
show that he is plain and normal. In fact, he's been criticized

for being a downright idiot, to say the least. What he does
have to do is demonstrate that he has policies that can back
him up, which is probably why his most recent slogan incorporates "real plans."
for the People, They're for the Powerful"
Gholston: The arrival of Ralph Nader on the political
sphere has in fact forced Gore, who is a quintessential moderate, to appeal to the side of the party whose loyalties are being
challenged by Nader. Both parties are going for the vital center, but what that means to many Democrats is that they're
being owned by interests. And so by separating himselffrom
those interests, saying he's for the people and not the powerOn "I'm

ful, Gore is trying to reconnect with that base.
Thomas: It's a wonderful slogan. I mean, talk about reinforcing perceptions. What better perception for Gore to reinforce than the Republican Party as the party of the rich. Were
I a Democrat, I'd use the same slogan.... Now, what does it

mean? You know, it's not like Al Gore was exactly from the

poor house. Senator Albert Gore Sr. was as much a political
insider as George Herbert Walker Bush.
On "I Want to Fight for

You"
Gholston: By and large, Gore is trying to let folks know
that he is human, that he is led by human passions and human convictions. He trying to let folks know that he is real...
There is no question among most people that he has proficient knowledge of policy, and so he needs to step out of that
wonkish typology and demonstrate that he is a real guy.
Thomas: My initial reaction is that he should have used
the word "lead" instead of "fight." Obviously it's been effective, we've all seen that, but I think it reinforces images of a
fighter and not a leader. I'm hoping on Election Day Americans are going to pick a man who wants to lead them over a
man who wants to fight for them.... Because who's he going to
fight? He'dbe the most powerful man in the world. That makes
him a bully, basically.

LETTER Tft THE EDITOR

Don't be misled: Steinem is powerful
Dear Editor:
To preface her talk at Bryn Mawr
College on gender dynamics, Gloria

Steinem lamented the hierarchical
and, according to her, thus
patriarchical formatof the lecture in
Goodhart Hall. During the questionand-answer session, I remarked that
there is something equally suggestive
of power in Steinem's MS. Magazine
venture not simply because advertising plays a critical role in the success of any such publication, but also
because of Steinem'sauthoritative or
seemingly authoritative role in politics and, specifically, the discourse on
feminism.
How, I asked, does she reconcile
her privileged position with her advocacy of breaking down power structures to facilitate equality? Steinem
responded first by noting that she is
not the editorofMS. and then claimed
that the magazine does not accept
advertisements. Such modesty is disingenuous, since Steinem founded
the magazine in 1972 and is currently
chair of Liberty Media for Women,
LLC, the magazine's owner. Furthermore, MS. recruits advertisers, is itself a product of the mass media and

most alarmingly, commodities its audi-

ence.
It is imperative to recognize what is
accomplished by Steinem's affectation of
humility: it veils the extent ofher power.
You think that you are resisting power
by championing an activist who is poststructuralist and politically correct,
when you are actually operating within
limits that a new order of power has defined. Power looks limited, not very powerful at all, when its possessors
downplay orrefuse to acknowledge their
agency. (Steinem says: I facilitate orga-

nizational meetings; Questions are answered in my absence; You don't need
me.)

But in fact, Steinem is the poster
woman of matriarchical authority. Her
power—especially in the lives of women
is pervasive. Steinem's use of the collective "we," for example, signifies the

appropriation of us as an audience for
her agenda, which appears to be centered around the right to abortion. This
manner of speaking is highly presumptuous, and it severely undermines the
brilliant diversity of opinions within the
feminist movement. It seeks to silence
opposition.
And I beg to differ.

THE PHOENIX

■>Hl;l>];l*4i]:i;M;a

The usurpation of power from men
does not justify the irresponsible wielding of power by women, nor is a
matriarchical system necessarily morally superior to a patriarchical one.
Steinem seems to be wary of only males
in power, whereas her denial of MS.
Magazine's advertising reflects an effort
to assume more power by coyly denying
its presence.

Indeed, the MS web sitefeatures both
MS Mall, an online shopping gallery, and
a classified advertising section. The
magazine's solicitation says, in part,
"Advertisers: reach an audience of influence [read: great buying power] with
your ad in MS online marketplace.
There's simply no better place for your
advertising message. Support this great

community by advertising with us!"
Even if we excuse this unabashed capitalist maneuver, the fact remains that
marketing the magazine and Steinem's
books is inherently advertising. To this
Steinem retorted, without qualification,
"It is not," and I thought it futile to engage further.
However, as my "outrageous act for
the cause of simple justice," I add here

REALITY
CHECK

Consider the
human costs
of drug use
How often have we heard "Swarthmore is not the
real world!" uttered by professors, students, ourselves?
Maybe more than enough. After all, this ivory tower
probably has a bigger window than do most colleges.
But at the same time, I think all of us could use a dose
of the real world, so in the spirit of making the window a little bigger, here's your biweekly reality check.
The world of illegal drugs is a complex one, and
should not be dehumanized and oversimplified by
mere debates over the legalization of marijuana, government-subsidized methadone clinics or spending
that extra million dollars on enforcement. These issues, though important, disregard the human cost of
illegal drug use in here and throughout the world.
Consider the following:
■ The federal government will spend $18.5 billion
(estimated) this year on drug control, up from $1.5 billion in 198
L
■ Of convicted property and drug offenders, about
one in four committed their crimes specifically to get
money for drugs.
■Of the L 7 million people incarcerated in the United
States today, almost LI million of them are there on
drug or drug-related charges.
Shocking? I think so. The fact of the matter is that
a good deal of the crime in this country is in some way
related to drugs. And every one of those crimes has a
human face. Who was robbed so the dealer could pay

I

COUNTRY IS IN SOME WAY RELATED

CRIMES HAS A HUMAN FACE.

his debts? Your grandmother? Who was shot in the argument over quality? A dealer's girlfriend who happened to be standing by? Who pays the taxes that go
toward law enforcement at all levels of government?
You?
Running drugs is hardly a pure trade. In Latin
America, the "business" of exporting cocaine, heroin

and marijuana has irreversibly changed the social and
political structure. Guerrillasand terrorists are funded
by these lucrative markets (not the least of which is
in the United States), using poor farmers lured by the
money in producing coca. Colombian drug trafficking
accounts for an estimated 8 percent ofColombia's GNP
and 50 percent to 60 percent of its exports every year.
The terrible violence resulting from drug trafficking
and sociopolitical conflicts hasbecome so intertwined
that it would not be possible to separate the two.
To say that U.S. policy toward illegal drugs has been
inadequate would be an enormous understatement. It
has often exacerbated the violence. But what is the
real solution? It isn't the legalization of marijuana, nor
is it spending more and more money on law enforcement. It isn't ineffective youth programs like DARE.
It isn't free cocaine for any addict who wants it. I don't
have all the answers. Right now, no one does. But in
true Swarthmore progressive fashion, we can contribute to reduce the suffering caused by drugs.
Unlike the many vegetarians and vegans who
choose a lifestyle that supports the humane treatment
of animals, those who refuse drugs rarely do so because of the implications for humans. Go ahead and
smoke that "harmless" joint, but unless you grew it
yourself, you don't know where it came from. Truly,
drug use, which many consider to be a personal choice,
is hardly that at all.

TWO MAJORS
BY BRENDAN KARCH

Depending on how well you know them,
Ben Keys and Grant Nachman are either very
similar or very different people. They are both
course majors in economics, the largest department
on campus. Both are white males who come from
large cities not on the east coast, and both grew up
with college-educated parents. They are both athletes
Keys plays tennis and Nachman lacrosse and both
are far from being the stars of their respective teams.
Except for slight variations in their fashion sense, the differences between Keys and Nachman seem as invisible as
the Swarthmore bubble.
But just because you can't see a literal dome surrounding
Swarthmore when outside doesn't mean you can't feel its presence

when inside. From the outside, there may not be a bubble separating
Ben Keys from Grant Nachman. But step inside the mind of each, and
you soon realize they are as isolated from one another as any two Swatties
with nothing in common.

Keys,

though a course major, has
taken two seminars and plans to
take another, while Nachman, be
cause of two semesters of study
abroad, could not. For similar reasons, Keys
will finish his major with several more credits than Nachman. The two have never
shared a course aside from the core requirements. Keys is a double major in political
science, while Nachman's other passion is
Spanish literature. And while Keys came to
Swarthmore with an interest in math but not
much direction, Nachman, who wants to be
an investment banker, has known his profession of choice since he was 10 years old.
Keys and Nachman are only two of the
more than 50 economics majors in the Class
of 2001, the largest econ group in recent
memory. Including majors and minors, almost one in five seniors is part of the department. With the Class of2000 which had
51 majors the department became the most
popular on campus, displacing the longtime
liberal arts strongholds of English and biology. Its popularity as a major and as the
home of "real-world" coursework has pervaded Swarthmore culture. One senior economics major recalled, "On my [admissions]
tour, I was told everyone takes Econ 1 here."
But if Swarthmore's cultural infatuation
with economics is so great, it's often a lovehate relationship. The department carries an
onerous reputation as "thefootball major" and
all the dubious implications that come with
it: Econ is easy. You don'thave to be that smart
to get an econ degree. Econ is for money-grubbing, unenlightened Swatties. Econ majors are
not true liberal arts students. All these sentiments are thrown around among the intelligentsia of Swarthmore. Ask one of these
Swatties, and they'll tell you they're proud they
have never taken Econ L Ask one of these
Swatties, and they'll tell you they don't like
the Grant Nachmans ofSwarthmore.
A Phoenix in-depth report has found that
such claims are always overblown and mostly
dubious. Yes, econrequires only eight credits;
but so do English and political science. Yes,
some students think the requirements for a
major are too easy; those students are likely
econ majors. And yes, many econ majors will
be future investment bankers and management consultants. But ask almost any ofthem,
and you'll find they came to Swarthmore for
much the same reasons as any other Swattie.
Call it a case ofThe Grass is Greener on My
Side ofthe Fence. Between those in the department and those outside it, and increasingly between those within the department, each
person's point ofviewhas eminent domain over
the other's. The surprising thing may be just
how similar those points of view are.

You

get the feeling from talking to
Grant Nachman that there is some
thing genetic in his desire to be an
investmentbanker. Although his parents don't exactly work on Wall Street (they're
both corporate attorneys in Denver), his
grandfather did work in finance. Grant was
not allowed the childhood privilege of television, so when the TV. was on it was tuned to
either "Wall Street Week" or "The Nightly
Business Report." Nachman says he thought
the people in suits looked cool, and ever since
then he's been sure ofhis career goal.
Nachman doesn't really remember ever
having any doubt about majoring in econ.
He took Econ 1 fall freshman year and Econ
21, macroeconomics, in the spring, earlier
than most students. Although he has other
interests, such as Spanish literature (his favorite author is Poll Delano) and history,
Nachman has always had his eyes on the
prize. While studying abroad in Chile in the
fall semester ofhis junior year, he interned
at an investment banking firm in Santiago.
He spent one of his summers working on
Wall Street.
It's easy to believe that the reason econ is
the most popular department on campus is
because there are now more GrantNachmans
running around. However, the popularity of
economics doesn't come in theface of skyrocketing numbers. The Class of 1995 graduated
only 35 majors, but the class of 1996 graduated
50, and the Class of2000,51 In the last 15years,
econ has consistently drawn between 10 percent and 14 percent of the student body.
Aside from economics, the threemost popular majors over the past decade have consistently been political science, biology and English. Notably, English is the only one ofthese
majors that doesn't have an appeal to a particular profession, and of the four popular
majors, English is the only one that has seen a
noticeable drop in numbers. That leaves three
of Swarthmore's most "practical" majors
ones that could be said to attract "pre-med,"
as the
"pre-law" and "business" students
most appealing to Swatties in recent years.
Economics professor Tom Dee '9O sees a correlation between the particular appeal of his
department and the strength of the economy.
"I wish I could say that it is because people are
becoming aware of the broad uses of economics," Dee says of the strong interest in economics. But, he adds, the widespread theory is that
'economics enrollmentstend to be pro-cyclical."
In other words, thebetter the economy, the more
interest in studying economics.
Thisraises theobvious concern thatthe economics department is catering to business students. However, both professors and students
in the department say that claim couldn't be

THE PHOENIX

farther from the truth. "We don't try to teach
business," says economics professor Amanda
Bayer. Still, some economics courses are certainly more business-oriented thanothers. Econ
73 Race, Ethnicity and Gender in Economics
is an example of one extreme, while Econ 33
Accounting is an example of "practical" economics at the other extreme.
Professors and students agree that majors
cannot avoid economic theory, especially
since everyone must complete a core sequence that includes micro- and macroeconomics. But once majors finish those courses,
they could potentially minimize their exposure to theory and maximize their exposure
topracticality with carefully chosen electives.
One would think that Nachman's singleminded focus on investment banking would
translate into such a plan. Certainly, he admits, he took his future career into account
whenheenrolled in the department's accounting course. But overall, his path through the
major has had little rhyme or reason beyond
curiosity. His course load, while heavy on
policy, can hardly be criticized for avoiding
the central theories of economics.
Nachman scoffs at the idea of pursuing a
business major at Swarthmore if one existed.
"I personally have enjoyed not being on a
business track," he says. His final choice of
schools, he recalls, came down to Pomona and
Swarthmore neither of which are known
for attracting future investment bankers.
At least not in large numbers.

Just

how many econ majors are business
majors in disguise is something that
Ben Keys doesn't mind estimating.

When asked how many of the senior
econ majors he thinks are in itfor the money,
Keys responds "probably... a majority." Not
surprisingly, Keys sees himself as part ofthe
minority.

If Ben Keys were to describe himself, he
wouldprobably be deemeda traditionalS wattle
posing as an economics major. He took Econ 1
in the fall ofhis freshman year and Games and
Strategies in the spring, but didn't decide on
his major until he took microeconomics. Even
then, he decided on a double major in economics and political science.
Keys explains that hisrationale for choosing econ courses was very simple: he took
"basically the most difficult courses I could
find." Although he is a course major, he has
taken two seminars and plans to take another.
None of his courses, he says, were chosen
with the business world in mind. "I didn't
really have a focus when I wrote my sophomore paper," he says, "and I still don't."
This spring, Keys took the Advanced
Microeconomics seminar, a course heavy on

both theory and mathematics. He describes the

course in close to Utopian terms. "It was a great
learning environment," he says, "[and] we
helped each other a lot." He adds that it was
"probably the best preparation for graduate
school I could have found at Swarthmore."
There were, however, only two students
in Keys' class, and the other was a sophomore. Keys thinks it is significant that in a
department with over 100 majors, only two
took an advanced theory seminar. "I think
that there aren't that many people who
are preparing for a Ph.D. in economics,"
Keys says, "or maybe who just aren't interested in that kind of intense challenge."
The essence of Keys' point of view lies
between the lines of that quote. As an academically-minded Swattie raised in an academic family, Keys has pursued what he sees
as the most academically challenging route
he could find.
"I think there's a pretty clear-cut difference," Keys says, "between the people who
are in econ because they wantto study econ
and people who are in econ because there is
no business major here."
It's pretty easy to see whichside of theline
Keys falls on. Ben Keys is taking economics
because he wants to study economics.
But what he doesn't know, through no
fault of his own, is that Grant Nachman falls
on the same side of the line as Ben Keys.
...

Asking

Keys and Nachman if they are
athletes is a lot like asking President
Clinton a question with the word "is"

in it. Before the question can be answered, one must define what an "athlete" is.
Nachman, who plays varsity lacrosse, defines himself as an athlete, but only on his
own terms. "If an athlete is someone who is
on a varsity sports team and shows up to
every practice," Nachman says when asked
if he's an athlete, "then I guess your answer
is yes." When asked ifhe's an athlete, Keys,
who plays tennis, answers "sometimes yes
and sometimes no."
Their responses, and this reporter's questioning, show justhow touchy the issue ofathletics is. Keys, for example, won't apply the term
to himselfbecause he doesn't want the baggage
that comes with it. "I think calling yourself an
athletehas a certain stigma," he says.
Part of that stigma is that athletes are econ
majors. Ask any informed Swattie what the
"football major" is and the response will be
'econ." Football players, and athletes in general, are notorious for populating economics
classes. It's not a problem in itself, but the
implication is that athletes, with their stigma
of being less intellectually curious than the
norm, bring an inferior sensibility to the de-

tTNPEPTHI

partments they major

in. And if so many athletes choose one major, the department as a
whole can be labeled less academically chal-

lenging than other departments on campus.
The validity of these subjective claims is
almost impossible to prove, and the statistics
don'thelp one way or another.The footballteam
only has six seniors on its squad this season,
two ofwhom are economics majors. Neithervolunteered to be interviewedfor this article.
If for no other reason than he looks bigger and prefers a preppier look, one would
probably pick Grant Nachman as the athlete before Ben Keys. Indeed, Nachman's
sport, lacrosse, is generally considered to
draw more stereotypical athlete-types than
tennis, however nebulous such a claim may
be. But Nachman, while a dedicated player,
is far from being an obsessive team captain;
in fact, he only started playing lacrosse when
he came to Swarthmore.
Nachman testedhis own priorities when he
madethedecision to finishhis academic career
at Swarthmore this fall. He is completing his
requirements this semester in order to spend
his final college days in Portugal. As a result,

Nachman will miss his final season oflacrosse
at Swarthmore. "It was a tough decision," he
says. But it is also one hehas rationalized; this
semester, he is taking Portuguese at the UniversityofPennsylvania, and he has always been
interested in Brazil and Latin America.
Although Nachman doesn't question his
own priorities and abilities, he does question how other people view him. While he
won't voice any particular complaints, he
does say, "If people have any doubts about
my ability because I'm on a sports team, I
don't worry about it and let my academic

performance speak for itself."
Keys doesn't seem to worry about such
issues because, as far as he's concerned, he's
only an athlete when he's doing athletics.
Once inside the classroom, Keys is more the
critic than the criticized on the topic of athletes. He admits, though, that it's nearsighted to question the intentions of a large
group, and he feels thatfootball players work
hard to get through micro- and macroeconomics just like everyone else.
Even if it's impossible to findall the reasons
why so many football players take econ, thefact
that econ is an easy major probably isn't one of
them. "I just don't see anywhere to slack in
econ," Keys says. "I think," he adds, "thatthere's
a lot of other easier majors out there."

Seniors

Yasemin Sirali and Vasya
Dostoinov fall on the same side ofthe
line as Ben Keys, though they share
little in common witheach other and
even less in common with Keys. Both are

-

"IFPEOPLE HAVE ANY

economics majors one course, one honors
and both are international students.
Both also felt compelled to be economics
majors, either by family or friends.
Sirali, whose parents are chemical engineers in Istanbul, describes it as an implicit
understanding between her and her parents.
"I knew, even when I was going to high
school, that my parents wanted me to be an
econ major," she says. Although she had
never visited any colleges in the United
States before matriculating, she decided to
apply to Swarthmore because ofits high academic ranking. She says, half-jokingly, that
one of the college guidebooks put a star next
to "economics" in their guidebook, indicating thatit was a strong major here. That star
was one of Sirali's deciding factors.
Sirali can be accused of a narrow focus,
but her path through Swarthmore is much
broader than it would have been at a Turkish university. On her university entrance
exams, she had to indicate what school in
Turkey she wanted to attend and even which
department she wished to concentrate in.
Even her place in high school was rigidly
determined; in sth grade, she took a test to
determine where shewould go to high school.
The top 100 students in the country were admitted to a single school, and Sirali remembers being ranked in the high to mid 90s.
Sirali insists she likes economics and is
also happy with her French minor, which
she says her parents let her choose. But she
admits that her choice of courses has been
influencedby an almost single-minded focus
on preparing for the business world. After
the core sequence, Sirali took Accounting,
The International Economy and two seminars Econometrics and Financial Economics. This spring, she will complete her honors major with a seminar in Public Finance.
Economics was Sirali's assumed path
through college, but for Vasya Dostoinov, the
options were a little wider. Dostoinov, who
comes from Kiev but now has asylum status, did not assume he wouldbecome an econ
major. Nonetheless, he took his first econ
class as a freshman.
"I hated Econ 1," Dostoinov remembers.
Still, he took International Political Economy
the following semester. "I hated that, too," he
says. Despite two bad impressions, he took Intermediate Microeconomics, the class with 96
students, in thefall semester ofhis sophomore
year. It was in this supposed weed-out course
that Dostoinov grew to like the subject.
Why did Dostoinov struggle through two
economics classes he hated and still decide
to take a third?Unlike Sirali, Dostoinov never
had an implicit understanding with his family that economics was his only choice. But
-

-

that doesn't mean he didn'tfeel any pressure.
When asked why he didn't initially break
freefrom a major he didn't like, he responds,
"I wasn't confident enough."
In Dostoinov's case, thatpressure came both
from himselfandfrom otherinternational students. Of the 18 foreign citizens in the Class of
2001, six are economics majors andanother large
percentage pursue engineering. That number
is not a recent trend; in the Class of 1995, seven
out ofthe 14 foreign citizens were econ majors.
Sirali and Dostoinov both agree that international students flock to these majors because
they feel that their choices are more limited.
"Their parents are paying $32,000 a year and
sending theirkids to America," says Sirali of
foreign students. "[The parents] have to get it
back somehow." Dostoinov notes that many international students he knows want to return
to their homeland (often third-worldcountries)
with the practical skills necessary to make a
tangible contribution to society.

International students, then, are a distinct

group who tend to choose majors that will
guide them into practical fields, often as a resultoftheir foreign upbringing. Professors and
administrators agree, however, thatthis trend

is not just limited to international students: to
an often lesser extent, domestic students are
also influenced by their upbringing, particularly by theirsocio-economic status.
It is this point, stated outright by no one
but implied by students and professors, that
provides the most tangible reason why football players (and athletes in general) major in
economics. Perhaps no one states it outright
because the assumption is based on two stereotypes: one, that football players generally
come from less advantaged backgrounds; and
two, that they therefore generally pursue econ.

In

a little over eight months, Grant
Nachman, Ben Keys, Yasemin Sirali and
Vasya Dostoinov will all have bachelors'
degrees in economics. As they look to solidify their plans for the future, their separate
paths highlight their differing points of view
regarding their common major. Grant
Nachman has applied to four New Yorkinvestment firms and has already received an offer
from one. Ben Keys hopes to work for a year or
two doing policy-heavy research before moving on to a Ph.D. program in economics. Vasya
Dostoinov wouldlike to work in the non-profit
sector before attending graduate school in pubhe policy. Yasemin Sirali wants to work as a
management consultant and then get her MBA.
Data obtained from the Career Planning
& Placement office seems to indicate that recent graduates are increasingly interested in
high-paying jobs. Majors were asked in an
exit poll to indicate their plans for the next

year. While only two out of 36 econ majors in
the Class of 1990 planned to enter the busi-

ness world as analysts, consultants or investment bankers, that number skyrocketed to
11 out of 35 students in the Class of2000. That's
a jump from 5 percent to over 30 percent.
Director ofCareer Planning & Placement
Tom Francis says that these types of positions are "a good match for many
Swarthmore students' interests." Swatties
like problem solving and communication
and many business positions offer those exact opportunities, Francis says. "Business
has had a bigger visibility" in recent years,
he continues, largely because there's so
much national interest in the economy.
But Francis also points out that, while
"there is a higher concentration of econ majors in the candidate pools [of business firms],"
the firms "are not interested in econ majors as
opposed to any other major." That implies one
of two things: either econ majors think they
are gaining an advantage, or they major in
econ solely because they're interested in it.
Yasemin Sirali seems to genuinely believe in the former. Most of her courses at
Swarthmore, she admits, have been planned
with the business world in mind. It is, after
all, hard to believe that courses such as Accounting and Public Finance would offer no
practical advantage in the business world.
Grant Nachman, though, would be an
example of the latter view. After all, why

would a future investment banker admit
that "a history major can be just as good an
investment banker as an econ major" if he
didn't really believe it? Nachman has been
so self-driven toward a goal at a young age
that one gets the feeling he would be just as
successful as a medieval studies major.
The debate is less relevant for Ben Keys
and Vasya Dostoinov. But Dostoinov is feeling many of the same pressures looking for a
job as hefelt choosing a major. Because he isn't
an American citizen, many ofthe more appealing job opportunities are not within his reach.
These Swatties' future plans reflect their
course selection. But more importantly, where
they are going reflects who they are, independent of their major. They bring a unique point
of view to their major. Certainly, there are
trends: it's hard to imagine Ben Keys as an
investment banker or Grant Nachman as an
academic. But the points of view that they
share place them, in the grand scheme of
things, on the same end of the spectrum.
When Ben Keys says, "If we set up a Swat
business school on the side, you would see
the numbers [in econ] drop precipitously,"
he doesn't know that Vasya Dostoinov,
Grant Nachman and Yasemin Sirali
wouldn't be among the defectors.

you'll work up to the final blow, in
which you bring the point that the
Phoenix editors don't look to be such
authorities on the matter, anyway.
Not that you've noticed.

You actually want people to
like you and think you're

There
was
this
thing that
happened

once that
caused everyone to
start noticing everybody else,

and then the
next step in
this evolution was that
everyone

started noticing all of

the little annoying idiosyncracies of everybody else,
and then the people began to notice the
subtle— or not so subtle ornamentations on everybody else and deep inside
they felt like shit or recognized the absolute inanity ofit all, because they had
started to assign appearance a disproportionately large weight in their judgements of personality and had actually
sort of forgotten to notice personality at
all, and then they felt petty and tried to
justify their actions and said, "Hey we'll
call it fashion," justlike some people justify greed and say, "Hey we'll call it capitalism," and then fashion became the litmus for personality and, well, there you
have it: style is substance, and if I didn't
dress the way I do, I wouldn't have met
half the people I know on campus and if
you stopped wearing those ugly short
shorts (or maybe it was the orange
capris?) then maybe that one girl would
give you the time of day.

I was once in love with this girl, who
left for me for some guy, whom she could
only ever laud for his too-tight black cowboy shirt with great pearly snap buttons.
Then I tried to do the same to her and
ended up dating this boy I met in a video
arcade, whom I only really liked because
he had messy hairand wore these bright
green New Balances and pink t-shirts,
but who wouldn't touch me. Once I put
my hand on his stomach, inching it under the thrift store tee he was wearing
that day I think it had a hula dancer
on it and he yelped, leapt backwards
and said, "Wow, I wasn't expecting that."
So it was over.
But I was with him for a whole two
weeks, so there must have been something, and it was definitely his style. I
liked him for his style, even though we
really didn't havemuch to talk aboutand
I ended up eating six meals a day and
chain smoking just to pass the time
when I was around him.
I'm sure you have done a similar
thing. No, not felt horribly unattractive
because some guy didn't want to make
out with you, but liked someone purely
because of the way he or she dressed. Or,
at the very least, bought some article of
clothing because it would make you look
good, i.e., attract the company of others.
You fucking weirdo. You actually want
people to like you and think you're attractive and want to spend time with you?
What's wrong with you? You must be like,
human or something, and that, in and of
itself, is often the most tragic thing.
And hey, I feel a bit hypocritical, because I'm the biggest clothes horse I
know and have quite possibly and sin-

cerely, without any hint of boastfulness
or embarrassment, the largest and, without a doubt, most eclectic wardrobe on
campus (which according to a previous
argument might just go to show how incredibly needy I am). I wouldn't wear
anything that I didn'tfeel complemented
and enhanced and exaggerated the accessibility of my self-perception. But
then that worries me, because I don't
know which is influencing which anymore. Am I too reliant on my clothing
for my image of self-worth, or is my
clothing merely a reflection of some existing persona? I dunno.
When I was depressed and lonely last
March around the time psychological
services didn't return my phone calls
even though I leftthem a message at two
in the morning after swallowing thirty
aspirin while making embarrassing, airsucking, crying noises on the phone and
throwing shoes at my mirror I wore
nothing but this old religious (it's holey! Get it, get it? hahaha ha) nasty, oldmen's gray sweater, which someone had
stolen from the Gap in a vain attempt to
fight the system and given to me, and
occasionally even pants. I hated myself
then, and all I wanted to do was sleep
eighteen hours a day in that cigarettesmoke-saturated sweater in my ciga-

~

rette-smoke-saturated room and smoke
cigarettes when I was awake and pity

myself.
I suppose this is an extreme case, and
in the gradient of emotions in between
that depressing last semester and now,
when I wake up every morning and feel
Andrew's waist on my completely numb
arm and am just so thrilled that I put on

By Suzanne Wu
a tie, there is always a lot of just going
through the motions; I wear ties and
dress up a lot, even when I feel like shit
or it is too early in the morning to be
coherent just because I am used to liking myself and being more alert when I
feel interestingly dressed, and I figure I
can always somehow con myself into
thinking I have it together.
So, I guess the moral of the story is
that clothes doreflect mood, but only to a
certain extent, and I'm sorry if that isn't
really an earth-shattering conclusion. My
favoriteredhead Mary told me that there
were some studies done, which proved
somehow or another that people who
dressed-up for the SAT's did better, in
general, than people who just rolled into
the test dressed in pajamas or whatever.
I would really like to believe that, even
though the theory sounds suspiciously
like an argument my mother might use
to get me to shower more often.
My mother once told me, as I left the
house in an ugly shirt made ofStarburst
wrappers, thatshe was planning on making me a sign to wear around my neck
that preemptively explained, "I don't
dress my children." She was worried
about how people would perceive her
parenting and how people would perceive me, and I wish I could tell her that
sheneedn't have worried, but really, any
sort of excuse for embracing the accepted
modes of fashion gets into all sorts of
class and gender, not to mention aes-

thetic, issues.
And, perhaps, there is no need to
read into style; what fashion may really
come down to absolutely nothing at all.
It's just a whim.

SEXUAL HEALTH
N-9 condoms not so safe
Sex. So most people think about it, worry about
it, wonder about it; many people even enjoy it. And
many feel some combination thereof.
If you have questions about sex, or want to talk about
it, that's where we come in. We are the Sexual Health
Counselors (SHC), a group of trained students, whose
goal is to provide information and support for all issues regarding sexualhealth and general sexuality. To
promote sexual self-knowledge and safety to as large
an audience as possible, we have started this column.
Our latest news flash is very important, because it
contradicts what most of us have learned in every sexed class we haveattended. This summer, theCenters for
Disease Controlreleased areport stating that nonoxynol-9 (or N-9), a compound which is widely used in
spermicides to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted
diseases, may actually increase the risk of infection.
N-9 acts as a detergent, creating micro-tears in the
vaginal or anal passages that can aid in disease transmission. Using a condomlubricated with N-9 provides a
barrier, which prevents fluid transfer, reducing your risk
of infection. However, subsequent unprotected sex is
more risky due to the potentially irritated tissue lining.
So should you throw out all of your condoms that
are lubricated with N-9? Probably not. A condomlubricated with N-9 is much better protection than no condom whatsoever. Plus, the amount of N-9 used on lubricated condoms is less than that used with spermicide-only protection. What this means is thatpreviously
recommended barrier methods, such as spermicidal
foams or films, are more dangerous than once thought.
The best bet for avoiding disease transmission is the
use of condoms that are not lubricated with N-9. And
remember, this is forboth analand vaginal intercourse.
None of this information is intended to scare anyone from not having sex. Sex can be a wonderful and
pleasurable experience. However, it always involves
an element of risk. Using a condom not lubricated
with N-9 greatly reduces that risk.
Sexual Health Tip of the Week
According toLinda Echols, directorofWorthHealth
Center, in an emergency after unprotected oral sex, you
can reduce your risk of infection by gargling with a
solution ofhalf hydrogen peroxide and half water. Alternately, you can use soda. Further, you can also swab
your vaginal or anal areas to reduce therisk of contact
infections, such as herpes. Do this within the first halfhour after unprotected sex. Remember, this information does not mean that you can forget the condom!

Canada's Moist thoroughly mediocre
BY JONAH GOLD

Canadian rock, hard as it may be to
talk about with a straight face, is slowly
picking up here in the United States. No,
we still don't recognize the mysterious
greatness of the Tragically Hip. Some
things just will
never be. But
other than that,
the signs are all
there that The
Great White
North is heading, musically,
in our direction.

last decade's musical legacy. College students nationwide love the Barenaked Ladies. Those nice Our Lady Peace boys are
pretty big withthe five remaining grunge
refugees who still haven't jumped on the
rap-rock train. And, for the most part, the
current crop of Canada-core bands aren't
bad, especially in comparison to the staggering amounts of current American pop
that flat-out sucks. Mediocre, maybe, but
not bad. Which is, incidentally, a fairly
accurate description of "Mercedes 5 And
Dime," the new album from moody Canadian alt-rock outfit Moist.

they go about this by using run-of-themill keyboards, effectsand strings seemingly swiped from Radiohead's "OK Computer." To top it all off, Usherhas a shockingly generic alt-pop voice reminiscent

Besides the obvious, there's not actually a great deal to say about "Mercedes

hear when tuning in to your local "Adult

home from a late-night movie date. The
songwriting is competent, and the lyrics,
though they could hardly be called poetry, do actually attempt to convey some
sort of meaning. There are catchy choruses, decently creepy atmospherics, and
musical moments that probably have
profound emotional meaning.

lost in the translation.For whatever reason, whether it's the squeaky-clean production job, Usher's stilted vocals, or
some deeper flaw, "Mercedes 5 And
Dime" doesn't have the emotional resonance that it wants to have. The best
songs, like the fourth track, "Fish," have
moments, frequently instrumental ones,
that are reminiscent of much better music. Moist, or whoever writes their songs,
are obviously passable artists, and in
light of this, it's quite sadthat they didn't
get more than they did out of thisalbum.
In reality, "Mercedes 5 And Dime"
doesn't quite gel as anything more than
an album of decent, forgettable, modern
rock songs.
So in the end, Moist is nothing more
than an addition to the parade of generically-named, generic-sounding, alt-rock
bands (Filter, Prong, Creed, etc.) that seem
to periodically obtain mainstream success, regardless ofcurrent musical trends.
Canada can do, and has done, better (i.e.
Moxy Fruvous). But the truly sad thing
is that, if Moist does make it as big in
America as it has in Canada, it will be
better than ninety percent of the contents
of the pop charts here. As our physics
teachers tell us, it's all relative. Modern
rock sludge, however ordinary, looks good
compared to Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit
looks good compared to N'Sync. N'Sync

Mr. Ripley"

LiICJ-t llUllll-,

How far would you go to sleep with Gwyneth Paltrow? Matt Damon? Jude Law? Well
that is not exactly what Anthony Minghella's highly acclaimed film, "The Talented Mr
Ripley," is about. But then again, there is that whole thought in literary theory tha
suggests that a desire to be someone else to assume his or her personality characteris
tics or lifestyle is actually a subconcious sexual attraction, whether it be homoerotic
or heteroerotic. But I really shouldn't pull too hard on any threads in the film's quasi
shockingly woven plot.
So, basically, there is this rich, older guy, and he asks this younger, attractive guy
Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) to play golden retriever and fetch his sexy wiener of a son
Dickie (Jude Law), back to the States. Of course, like always, there is money involved. So
Tom goes to sunny, southern Italy, and, well, falls in love with all that is Dickie. There i
all this jazz with Dickie's significantly expatriate other, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), anc
another object of affection, Meredith (Cate Blanchett), and then there is this other jazz
(the music). Ha! And you think you can see where this is going?
"The Talented Mr. Ripley" is playing on Sat., Sept. 22, at 7:30 p.m., and again atlO p.m
in the Lang Performing Arts Center Cinema.

Single in September
BY EMILIA PASTOR
No one wants to get screwed over
by classes, much less this early in
the year, so this is the best time to
begin thinking about time management. We all must weigh our different responsibilities, priorities, ambitions and goals for the semester
and organize them realistically. We
cannot control all variablesthat will
lead us to eventually get screwed
over by work, but we can at least try.
They say a fool learns from his own
mistakes and a wise person learns
from the mistakes ofothers. So take
my advice and hook up early in the
year.
L During the month of Septem-

ber the opportunity cost of hooking
up is the lowest and benefits are at
a peak (see points 3 and 4 for benefits). Most grades, or at least serious grades, do not start coming in
until October. From then on working "it" carries the high cost of falling behind the rest of the (sexless)
people in your courses.
2.1f you don't start now then
when will you ever start? I am not
sure if you can truly control
whether you are going to be one of
those people who will always have
someone or never have anyone, but
I'm pretty sure that if you don't have
anyone by October thenyou are not
going to have anyone for the rest of
the year. There is no guarantee that
you will find your other eccentric

self at Swat, but hooking up now increases your chances that you will
find someone. You miss 100% of the
shots you don't take.
3.1f you don't hook up now you
are going to have to settle for leftovers later. Now, I don't want to be
misinterpreted so I shall make myself clear through an analogy. Take
the steak bar for example. I think it
is kind ofnice that Sharpies makes
the effort to grill us some steak every once in a while. Sharpies' steak
is not the best, but it's much better
when it's fresh and still a steak than
when it's recycled into Asian bar or
Mexican casserole surprise two
days later. And it's no secret that
Mexican casserole surprise is always made from left-overs. Basically
what I am saying is get your meat
while it's still fresh.
4.You confer positive externalities on the whole campus by planning your time well. By hooking up
now as opposed to once your
workload becomes the size of the
12:40 lunch-line at Sharpies, you are
managing your time well AND you
are also helping others plan ahead
and manage their time well, too. I
mean, you can't hook up alone (well,
at least not in the conventional way)
and the more organized you are
about increasing hookups now and
decreasing them later, other people
will consequently be obligated to
conduct themselves in the samepattern. Help others avoid themidterm

Now, these may seem like trite

work show

that students

at

Swarthmore are procrastinators
or simply avoid getting anyone

SEPTEMBER 21, 2000

'Almost' realistically refreshing
BY MORGHAN HOLT

I've been hating the world lately,
or at least the pop culture aspect of
it: the phoniness and falsifications
that abound, shrouding everything
in life with a grime, a film not even
the toughest ofbathroom detergents
can kill. In the midst of my hatred,
I've been pondering my dilemma,
trying to discover what it is that
wouldmake life more liveable, more
tolerable. Tonight, sitting alone,

worn thin from a long day of dealing with too many phony people in
the theater, sipping on lukewarm,
artificial soda, surrounded by lukewarm, artificial people engaged in
lukewarm, artificial conversation, I
was wrenched from the misery to
which I've become accustomed, as
the sounds of the 70s rushed into my
ears.
I sat upright, alert, attentive, enticed by the prospect of something
real, something meaningful. Take
me back, I pleaded with the screen,
a silent appeal to director Cameron
Crowe and his long-haired, grungy
cast, take me back to a time when
people cared, when they were passionate and alive, when music was
more than synchronizers and
videography, and life was more than
implants and pension plans.
The story blossomed: a fifteen
dayyear-old aspiring writer
dreaming in class, composing in his
head great articles, great biographies about the bands he loves that

THE PHOENIX

play the music he loves
emerged
from the fading background of inspirational lyrics and moving guitar
riffs. William Miller, played convincingly ineptly by Patrick Fugit,
is in love with music. He writes
about music, dissecting it, examining in excruciating detail the lyrics,
the vibe, the essence of the tunes he

selects. He dreams about music, famous musicians frolicking in his
imagination. His life is about music,
about the posters that adorn his
walls, the chords that blarefrom his
speakers.
Passing the window of a radio

station on his way home from
school, where, he confesses, everyone hates him, he spots his idol and
mentor, the esteemed music critic
Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour
Hoffman), and later accosts him on
the street.
The story then shifts to a more
subdued, adolescent "Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas," when William, a more youthful, less strungout Hunter S. Thompson, lands himself a similarrole as a journalist for
Rolling Stone, for which he is to
compose a major piece on
"Stillwater," one of the decade's
many grassroots, Midwestern, almost-famous-rock bands.
William even gets to tour with
the band, as a company incentive
and an opportunity for research.
Despite the hesitation of his overbearing mother, whose main concern is that he might take drugs,

William jumps on the bus with
Stillwater and the group of girls who
call themselves the "Band-Aids,"
which, according to them, is much
classier than simply being groupies.
Over the course of the tour, he becomes very well acquainted withthe
extremely talented guitarist, Russell
(Billy Crudup), who professes to embrace nothing more than reality, as
he drops acid and lies to his girlfriend about sleeping with his group-

ies. Thinking he's found a new
friend in Russell, William admires
him, tries to spend most of his time
with him and hopes to center the
Rolling Stone piece around him and
his role in the band.
He also falls in love with the gorgeous Miss Penny Lane, Russell's
personal Band-Aid. Played by the
sultry Kate Hudson, Penny is a sixteen-year-old girl running from reality, hoping to improve her life by lacing it with important people, people
the world knows and loves, people
who are real, not like herself.
"Almost Famous" is filled with
lies. Penny lies to William and to
Russell, who lies to Penny, his band,
Rolling Stone and William, who in
turn lies to his mother, his friends
and the world. Eventually, there
comes a point in the sex-and-drugs
scenario, when William finally gets

fed up. He recognizes the love for
music he shares with the band, and
knows that it's what has kept them
together. Frustrated, he tries to
wake them up, bring them back to

reality, down from their pink

cloud of near-fame, their preoccupations with seven-digit salaries and sleazy girls, hallucinogens and big-time record deals.
He's a fan, he tells them, a true
fan of their music. He loves what
they've created, because it all
seemed so real.
Though the dialogue lags at
times and the acting couldbe better, the story progresses consistently and coherently. "Almost
Famous" certainly smacks of
"Fear and Loathing," but it's
much more together, much more
solid and much more meaningful.
And it's definitely more real.
There are no huge-name
stars. There's no silicone, there
are no nude shots. Nor is there
any violence or intense special
effects. It's just a flick about reality, the story of one kid's coming of age in the face of inter- and
intra-personal turmoil. It's
about filtering out the garbage
and getting to the core, the center, the truth. It was the perfect
film for me to watch, disgruntled
as I was, because it provided me
with an artistic form that was
actually artistic, not simulated,
not forced. This was also negative, in that I left the theater, the
sounds of real music resonating
in my ears, wondering where, in
our world of 'N Sync and celebrity hype, substance and meaning

have gone.

Collaboration with admissions Injuries and surface
pays off for coaches
slow Garnet

original 22 players in the class of 2003 are still on the
roster for the 2000 season. Edging closer to being competitive, along with selecting athletes that better fit the
profile ofhis program, has helped. Improbable as it may
sound, if these two classes can stay together for a few
years, then Swarthmore football may even find itself in
the top half of the Centennial standings.
"We have worked very closely with the admissions
department to identify qualified student athletes that
fit the Swarthmore profile," said Alvanos. He is quick,
however, to pass on the credit to his assistants. "I have
a great staffwho has worked extremely hard during the
fall and winter recruiting qualified student athletes,"
he said. "They spend countless hours at night on the
telephone and countless hours on the road at high
schools and homes talking to students and parents about
Swarthmore College and Swarthmore football."
Like Alvanos, women's soccer coach Amy Brunner
arrived at Swarthmore with the task of revamping a
once-proud program that had fallen on hard times. Since
she's on campus as both an employee (Director ofIntramural Sports) and a full-time coach, unlike coaches of

many of Swarthmore's other programs, Brunner can
put more effort into recruiting. "The three years prior
to myself were part-time coaches and that affects re-

cruiting first and foremost," she noted. The fruits of
her labor have been plentiful, with her first two recruiting classes yielding seven and eight women respectively, as compared to only five combined juniors

and seniors.
Despite their relative youth, the team looks poised
for a breakthrough after improving to 7-12 last season.
They have started off the season strong and been competitive in all of their games. The improvement owes
a lot to the work ofBrunner and the previous women's
soccer coach, Sean Ferris, both of whom "tried hard to
find those Swattie-type students that would fit in here
and play," said Brunner.

In NCAA athletics, it's difficult to succeed without
athletes. Now that coaches like Brunner and Alvanos
are seeing the numbers, they can focus on producing
successes on the field. Said Brunner, "We are already
starting to see the benefits of the added attention.
Here's hoping that continues."

Swarthmore College
Information Session
Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2000
7 pm
Bond Hall

Swarthmore women's soccer played against New York University (NYU) last Saturday, losing a hard-fought game by a score of
1-0. The players were hindered by their lack of familiarity with
NYU's astroturf surface, which afforded their opponents a distinct
homefield advantage.
"The combination of wind and a wet, carpet-like field was really wild," said E.B. Fortier 'O3. "I would have a corner kick and it
would go maybe five feet."
The novel field surface made the team more tentative at the
outset. "We didn't have much offensive movement in thefirst half,"
said Andrea Figueroa 'O2. "Second half, we had much more of it,
but we just didn't put the ball in the back of the net."
Liz Brainard 'O3 believes the Garnet would have done better if
familiar with the field. "If we had the same type of experience playing on turf as NYU did," she said, "we could have really shown
them up."
Swarthmore also lost to Ursinus in a 3-0 decision last Wednesday, but this score does not reflect the competitive nature of the
game. Both teams were scoreless at halftime.
"[Catherine Salussolia 'o4] has some great saves that kept us in
the game during the first half," said Brainard. "The defense was
really strong
just really solid." However, Ursinus slipped in a
quickie during the first two minutes of the second half, and then
scored twice more in the middle of the second half. "We don't have
a lot of [substitutes] and that really hurts us," said Brainard.
"Ursinus had fresh legs coming in all the time."
In a game against Dickinson this coming Saturday, Swarthmore
will be looking to break a two-game scoreless streak and undergoing a goalkeeper change at the same time. Courtney Caughey 'O4
will be moving from her midfield position into the goalie box to
replace former goalies Altschuler, who sprained her hand during
the game against NYU, and Salussolia, who suffered a concussion
during the game against Ursinus College.
The team, which has a 2-3 record overall and is 0-1 in the Centennial Conference, was scheduled to play Bryn Mawr College on
Sept. 19 but the game was cancelled by rain and rescheduled for
Oct. 2..

Women's tennis excels
during short season
For the women's tennis team, the short fall season has been
encouraging because of the outstanding performance of their impressive recruiting class. The team cleaned house at the
Swarthmore Invitational this past weekend, and then followed that
up with a 7-2 waxing of West Chester University on Monday after-

'

noon.
At the invitational, which was held at the Faulkner courts near
Wharton Friday through Sunday, Swarthmore paraded out its
impressive freshman class.
In fact, Swarthmore was so dominating that one article may be
rather redundant. Anjani Reddy 'O4 won A-flight singles in impressive fashion. Kristina Pao 'O4 won B-flight singles, and Sarah
Fritsch 'O4 took the C-flight singles crown.
The Garnet also dominated the doubles side of the tournament.
Jen Pao 'Ol, the team's first singles star last season, elected not to
play individually in any of the matches this past week. She will
most likely return to her fixture at the top of the singles lineup
this spring, but the girls surrounding her may be entirely new
faces. Four of the freshmen who competed this weekend could potentially break into the the top five. At the Swarthmore Invitational, Jen Pao teamed with Laura Swerdlow 'O2 to dominate Aflight doubles.
Caroline Celano 'O4 and Reddy won B-flight doubles. In addition, Kristina Pao and Fran Simonds 'O2 cruised to victory in Cflight doubles.
Against West Chester the result was the similar Garnet domination. Reddy and Celano won at first and second singles respectively. Kristina Pao and Stephanie Girondi 'O4 also won singles
matches.
The doubles teams of Jen Pao 'Ol/Swerdlow 'O2, Reddy/Celano,
and Kristina Pao/Katherine Voll 'O3 were all victorious.
"I think just about everyone played really well," said Celano,
"With the freshman and the people we have back, we should have
a very strong team in the spring."

Garnet makes good showing at
Seven Sisters tournament

Men's soccer falls to No. 12 Hopkins

BY TED CHAN

While the women's field hockey team fell just short against Wellesley
in the finals of the Seven Sisters Tournament at Bryn Mawr College
this past weekend, the team nevertheless put forth an excellent effort.
The Garnet advanced to the finals of the tournament for the seventh
consecutive season.
Despite coming up just short, the Garnet played well, putting forth a
cohesive team effort against top-notch competition.
"I think that we've finally jelled as a team," said goaltender Kate
Nelson Lee 'O3, "The Wellesley game was very important for us in that

regard."

The Garnet opened the tournament against Mount Holyoke from
South Hadley, Massachusetts. Swarthmore won a hard-fought 3-2 decision led by attacker Meg Woodworth's two goals. The Garnet scored
two goals in the first fifteen minutes of the game and seemed in command. Mount Holyoke responded with a goal with just a few minutes
in the halfand tried to make a game of it, but the Garnet basically locked
things up with a tally with just 45 seconds left in the half. The win
advanced Swarthmore against the semifinals against archrival

net.

The win placed Swarthmore into the finals against Wellesley Col-

lege, which is ranked 18th in the STX/NFHCA Division 111 Coaches PoU
at the beginning for this week.. Trailing at halftime, Swarthmore adjusted at halftime and dominated the second half, rallying to tie the
match at 2-2. Defender Katie Tarr 'O2 scored both goals. Tarr was all

over the field, as she also contributed three defensive saves which allowed the Garnet to extend the game to overtime. Ingrid Caszas 'O3 and
Katie Vivalo 'Ol assisted on Tarr's tallies.
Unfortunately, Wellesley scored first in the sudden death situation
to take a 3-2 win.
"With overtime, anyone can win, and Wellesley's luck just ran a little
bit better than ours," said Nelson-Lee.
Tarr was named to the Centennial Conference weekly honorroll and
the Seven Sisters All-Tournament team after tallying five points during
the weekend. She also had an assist against Mount Holyoke in addition
to the'two clutch goals against Wellesley. Her play on the defensive end
was also excellent, as she had four defensive saves total.
The Garnet are 5-2 to begin this season, 1-1 in Centennial Conference
player(this weekend's game against Haverford did not count towards
league standings). On Thursday, they take on the nation's top ranked
ranked team Lebanon Valley. Swarthmore is currently ranked 16th in

the nation by the STX/NFHCA Division 111 Coaches Poll.

then Swarthmore picked up on the
offensive. "We had a couple of opportunities to score," said Mike

our way." JHUfinished up the half
with another goal and cracked open
the second half with five goals.
"Our players were getting cuts
on knees and elbows," said Andrew
Kramer 'O3. "It hurts to slide on the
surface."
The team also lost to Albright
College last Saturday, 3-0. "It was
a raw, physical game on a small,
lumpy field," said Willis. Albright

took control of the first half,

scoring its three goals during
the first thirty minutes. "We
came out a little flat defensively," said Willis. During the

second half, Swarthmore regained some of the lost steam
and kept possession of the ball
but did not complete the scoring
opportunities. "We were taking
shots but we couldn't put [them]
in," said Willis.
The team is 1-4 overall and
is 0-2 in the Centennial Confer-

When the cross-country team headed to Baltimore last Saturday for
their annual meet with Johns Hopkins University, they had only one
goal: outrun Hopkins on their one-of-a-kind course, which involved
winding around a difficult course of swings and trees.
Despite this unique challenge, the women's team was unaffected by
the obstacles and fared well as they placed five runners in the top eight,
defeating Hopkins 22-33. Jokotade Agunloye 'Ol, Krista Gigone 'O4, MariaElena Young 'O4, Alissa Parmelee 'Ol and Christen Lungren 'O2 led the
team to the victory. Agunloye, the defending Centennial Conference

Down 21-0 and kicking off to
open the second half against Johns
Hopkins, the GarnetTide was looking for something to regain control
of a game that was quickly slipping
through its fingers.
When JHU kick returner Ben
Stopper 'O4 fumbled the kickoff at
the Blue Jays' 26-yard line, it
seemed the makings of a comeback
had inadvertently stumbled into
the hands of cornerback Donovan
Goodley 'O3 and the Garnet Tide.
Swarthmore

scrambled into action and sent out
the offense to convert its first legiti-

mate scoring opportunity.
Twenty

seconds

later,

Swarthmore had neither the ball
nor a shot at a comeback victory.
Against a tightening Blue Jays'
defense, Swarthmore quarterback
Scott Murray 'Ol tried to thread a
sidelinepass through the Hopkins'
secondary to receiver Keith
McManimen 'O2. JHU strong safety
JoeAngelosante 'O2 stepped in front
of McManimen and picked off the
pass, racing 35 yards behind a convoy of blockers before being
brought down from behind at the
Hopkins' 44-yard line.
"We had a chance to turn things
around, and I got too excited,"
Murray said. "I tried to force the
play, and it didn't work."
The ensuing Hopkins drive was
typical of Swarthmore's defensive
performance Saturday. JHU
tailback Scott Martorana 'Ol ran

virtually unhindered through the
defensive backfield, moving the
ball in 10- and 20-yard chunks.
Martorana, not even listed as a
starter, played like he was wearing
Teflon, shedding numerous tacklers four on the scoring run of
the drive in question
on his way
to 226 yards and three touchdowns.
Play after play, Martoranabounced
through holes in the line with

shoulder lowered and bowled over
linebackers and defensive backs. It
was all the Garnet Tide could do to
bring Martorana down before he
picked up a first down.
"We missed tackles and blew assignments all over the field," said
linebacker Joe Corso 'O2, who led
the team with 14 tackles. "We were
prepared for this but we just didn't
execute."
Execution on the offensive side
of the ball wasn't much better. At
times the Swarthmore offense
looked like the Washington Generals of Harlem Globetrotters
fame, bumbling its scoring
chances away in comic but pathetic fashion. Swarthmore's 14
possessions ended in three failed
fourth-down conversions, three interceptions, six punts and one

merciful halftime.
"It always comes back to blocking and tackling," said head coach
Pete Alvanos, who is now 0-15 in
Centennial Conference play in
three years as coach. "We weren't
doing the fundamentals, and the
game just snowballed on us."
Alvanos said he felt the game
starting to get away from his team
early in the first quarter, when the
offense failed to convert a crucial
fourth down on its first sustained
drive of the game.
"We were finally moving the

ball, and then we didn't make that
fourth-and-short," Alvanos said. "It
took the wind out of our sails. I
went back to the bench thinking,
'Oh goodness, here we go again.'"
And he was right. Hopkins
scored on its next possession and
added four more touchdowns before it was all told, leaving
Swarthmore wondering what it can
do to score, much less break its 31game Centennial Conference losing
streak.
"When you lose, it's tough to find
bright spots," Alvanos said. "But we
did have a few six- and seven-play
drives it's a start."
For what they're worth, those
drives are all the Garnet Tide (1-1)
has to build on going into
Saturday's road game against
Gettysburg (0-3). Despite their

record and the loss of top running

Bullets are still a formidable opponent
last year, they beat
Swarthmore 55-7.
But before the Garnet Tide can
even think about beating another
team, it has to stop beating itself,
Alvanos said.
"When no one's blocking or executing, there's no magical call you
can make to put the ball in the end
zone," Alvanos said.

Freaky links
You have a scorching Internet connection. You love sports,
but you're too lazy to search for anything. Since I'm a nice guy
(and since I need a topic for my first column), I present to you
my very own Sports Fanatic's "Guide" to the Internet:
Site: The Darryl Strawberry Chronology

The lowdown: If you're having a difficult time keeping track
of Straw-man's gaffes, then this site is for you. You can keep
track of Strawberry's cocaine convictions, tax evasion schemes,
domestic battery arrests, and illegitimate children, and you can
also learn about his more obscure exploits such as his stint as
spokesperson for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence.

Rating: 9/10.

The lowdown: This site is perfect for anyone who recognizes
that synchronized swimming represents all that is good in
sports... or for anyone who wants a good laugh. The index page
links fans to a detailed, interactive guide to the event. It also
describes the ultra-technical and athletically demanding moves
that participants must execute, such as rockets, boosts, twirls,
and thrusts.
Rating: 7/10.1 was pleased by the informative nature of this
site, but I was disappointed by its failure to address the lack of
a men's synchronized swimming event in the Olympics.

The lowdown: What true sports fan doesn't love ballroom
dancing and its physical, competitive demands? For those of
you who are not too familiar with ballroom dancing, this website
explains its detailed and controversial history. For those who
have already fallen in love with this sport, this page thoroughly
describesthe outfits that young boys must wear at official
ballroom dance competitions. But best of all, this site links
ballroom dancing enthusiasts to a detailed plea for ballroom
dancing to become an Olympic event.
Rating: 7/10. Kudos for the historiography, but this page just
misses greatness. I would recommend that it include a rules
guide and a description of men's dancing costumes.

The lowdown: On one hand, the Expos are below .500 and
have no chance of making the playoffs. On the other hand,
they're from Canada and they might disband in a few years. So
go to this website and print out a copy so you can show your
grandkids that you were alive when America's favorite pastime
got flushed down the toilet.
Rating: 10/10. This site might be worth something
someday... you know, like how Joe DiMaggio cards increased in
value when he died.

The lowdown: No, I did not stumble upon this site
accidentally. Unlike my other recommendations, this one is
legitimate. In fact, it is one of the best sites on the Net.
Basically, cracksmoker.com is an archive of the crimes of the
athletes of each of the four major sports. You can research the
blunders of sports figures like Charles Barkley, Gary Payton, Jim
Brown, and, of course, our friend Darryl Strawberry. Just in case
you were wondering, the NFL has the largest crime database on
this site.

Nothing doing: Tide shut out by JHU 35-0

JustinKane Phoenix Staff

In the waning minutes of Saturday's game against Johns Hopkins, running back Ken Clark searches for open space behind the lead block of fullback Lane Oatey. Clark's 131-yard
performance was one of the few bright spots for Swarthmore, which slipped to 0-29 in Centennial Conference play since 1996. For more on Saturday's game, see page 23.

Underclassmen bolster rosters
BY TED CHAN
What immediately pops out from a roster for one of
Swarthmore's football or soccer teams is the sheer number
of freshmen and sophomores listed. Without a doubt, recent
years have brought an increase in student athlete participation in these two sports.
Nineteen sophomores and the same number offreshmen
grace the roster of Swarthmore's football team. Meanwhile,
first-years and sophomores far outnumber upper-class athletes in both men's and women's soccer. This increased participation has been essential in turning these programs
around. Where pessimism once reigned, there is now hope
amongst the coaches, athletes and fans of these programs
that they will be contending for conference titles in the not-

too-distant future.
Swarfhmore football coach Pete Alvanos has a 2-16 record
one game into his third season with the Garnet, but that
number is deceiving. In truth, he has breathed life into a
moribund program that had not won a game in three years.

Before the Garnet could achieve victory on the field, they
needed to win the battle on a differentfield: the admissions
office. That challenge consisted of assembling a team with
enough talent and numbers to be competitive. Alvanos has
maintained a close relationship with the Swarthmore admissions office, which is essential considering limited enrollment numbers at the college.

That relationship between coaches and admissions goes
for women's soccer, too, according to coach Amy Brunner.
"We are in constant communication with [the admissions

office], trying to ensure a working relationship," she said.
It is difficult to tell if the increase in numbers is due to
admissions' increased willingness to accept athletes, or if it

is because coaches like Alvanos and Brunner have been working harder to identify student athletes who can contribute to
their teams while surviving Swarthmore's rigorous academics.
Brunner does not believe that admissions has been accepting more athletes. "I think admissions has not let in
more athletes at all. We have just gotten better at finding

the type of student that fits in here both academically and
mentally," she said. "Essentially, there is no 'special' relationship between admissions and athletics at all. Many
coaches feel that admissions is letting in [fewer] athletes
overall."

According to Kennan Dick, who served as the admissions
liaison to the athletic department, outgoing Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet improved the vehicles of communication between admissions and athletics. "Robin really put
together a system for the coaches that allowed them a lot
more access to the application process and let them know
the status of their students," he said.
Alvanos, who arrived at Swarthmore in 1998, has been
extremely successful in recruiting and maintaining talent.
The class of 2003, the first class he was responsible for recruiting, had 22 players. While recruiting is important, another of Alvanos' goals upon his arrival was to cut down
the rate ofattrition. He hasbeen highly successful: 19 of the
