the recent pattern of deficit
spending. The 19 percent cut
comes despite the $24 increase
in the Student Activities Fund
(SAF) Fee, because all of that
money more than $24,000 is
needed to replenish the capital
replacement account. The account, used to replace equipment
such as vans and computers, is
at $30,000 now but will be decimated by this year's extreme
deficit spending.
Student groups will have until
May 2 to decide what part of their
budgets will take thebrunt of the
cut. SBC is not allowing any appeals to its decision. Although
SBC assistant treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2 thinks that groups

have upwards of 10 percent in
"fat" that can be trimmed, many
groups that The Phoenix interviewed attested to little, if any,
budget flexibility.
Because the cut is proportional
to a group's allocation, larger
groups are being hit with multithousand dollar cuts. The Halcyon is losing over $8,500; Forum
For a Free Press (FFFP), which
funds all student publications, is
losing $10,000; Social Affairs
Committee (SAC), which funds
parties, is being denied over
$7,000; and Movie Committee,
which screens movies free-ofcharge, has been cut by almost
$5,500. At least 12 student groups
will lose $l,OOO or more.

On the same weekend that admitted students flooded the campus and the Deans laid down a
temporary no-alcohol policy,
Public Safety was bombarded
with multiple calls of vandalism
and noise complaints. The college emerged from the weekend
with no reports of drunken specs
but a case of student alcohol poisoning, damage to Wharton and
rowdiness across campus have
caused students to question the
Deans' decision and the possible
changes to college alcohol policy.
In the most serious mishap last
weekend, a female student in
Wharton was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. Public Safety
and local EMS personnel were
called to Wharton at 1:17 a.m.
Saturday night to treat the student, who was eventually released from the hospital without
serious harm. According to Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie, another student visited Worth
Health Center because of excessive alcohol consumption.
The alcohol poisoning in
Wharton was only one of many
incidents in what Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave
called a "busier than normal"
weekend. Between Friday and
Saturday nights, Public Safety
fielded four noise complaints,
two of which were in Wharton,
four property damage calls,

Wharton C/D basement was visited by Public Safety Friday
night because of a noise complaint (no alcohol was found), and
the first and second floors of C/
D were a source of noise Saturday night.
None of the damage can be
positively attributed to specs or
students. And, according to various reports from students and
from Redgrave, students, not
specs, caused all of the reported
drinking and noise problems.
Both Goundieand Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet felt that
the dry weekend policy was successful in that no specs drank to
the point of embarrassing themselves or others. According to
Goundie, this past weekend's
policy was largely a response to
problems with drunken specs
last year and the written request
by RAs to make the weekend dry.

College raises wages for hourly staff
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

Dozens of students came to a fireside chat Tuesday in Kohlberg Coffee Bar,
where almost all spoke against shortening the spring Honors exam period.

Students at chat oppose
shortened exam period
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Not one of the dozens of students at a fireside chat Tuesday
night spoke in favor of a proposal
that would shorten the spring
Honors exam period by one week.
The crowd, composed largely
of Honors majors, was at times
almost argumentative in its opposition to the proposal, the only
controversial one among four
changes the Curriculum Committee is recommending the faculty
make to the calendar. The four
which also include
proposals
synchronizing the fall semester
opening and break with Bryn
Mawr and Haverford and scheduling Commencement on a Sunday rather than Monday
are
set for a faculty discussion and
vote on April 28.
The controversial plan to
shorten the exam period would
move graduation a week earlier
in the spring, allowing faculty
and senior students to begin their
summers sooner and cutting
some of the time that course majors must wait before graduation
while Honors students take exams. One reason the Curriculum
Committee is considering the
change, said its chair, Craig
Williamson, is there are fewer
Honors exams than in the past.
"When Honors exams were
spread out over 9 or 10 days, there
were eight Honors exams," said
Williamson. "Now, there are four."
But students argued that the
stress they and their friends will
go through preparing for Honors
exams would only be increased
if the time span was shortened.
"If this college is going to make
a decision to support its Honors
students, it's got to give them the
time," said CatherineOsborne 'Ol.
Many of the students at the
chat also complained the proposal would schedule some Honors written examinations on a
Sunday, which they said should
be off-limits for religious reasons
and to have a scheduled break.
But professor Bob DuPlessis,
representing the Curriculum
Committee at the chat with fellow professors Williamson and
Don Shimamoto, pointed out that

Finally acknowledging that
many hourly staff are paid at
below the market value, the college allocated $50,000 toward
bringing those staff up to the
wages they are told they can expect upon hiring.
The $50,000 was approved by
the Board of Managers as part of
the 2000-2001 budget, which also
includes funding for an acrossthe-board 4 percent staff salary
increase. While a yearly raise is
routine to account for inflation,
this is the first time in recent
years that additional funding of
this kind and amount has been
allotted for hourly staff.
"We have to just be more competitive," Vice President of Finance Paul Aslanian commented.
"With hourly employees we were
under the market when we did our
homework." He added that it is
difficult for the college to keep up
with the booming economy, which
means that the Fair Market Value
(FMV), or the average market
wage, is continually rising.
Aslanian said in the December
10,1999 issue of the Phoenix that
to his knowledge all staff performing at a satisfactory level
reach Fair Market Value (FMV),
or the average market wage, af-

students had few objections to
holding graduation on a Sunday,
only to scheduling exams then.
According to Williamson, students with religious convictions
could ask the registrar to reschedule any Sunday exams.
DuPlessis said he did not care

matter of having

The reaction among staff is
mixed: while some are hailing the
funding as a capstone to a successful year in relationsbetween
the administration and staff, others view the changes with seasoned skepticism.
Michelle Hartel, a cashier at
Kohlberg Coffee Bar and a member of the Staff Advisory Council (SAC), said that she suspects
most of the staff she represents
in Dining Services are uninformed about the raise and the
new allocated funding.
And if they were to learn about
it, she said, they would temper
their excitement with experience. "They've always been
fighting for more money...Let's
wait to see it. I know that's what
they'd say."
Yet some staffmembers see the
funding as part of a new administrative effort toward addressing
staff concerns. SAC ostensibly
exists to give staff a chance to
have a say in the formation of policies that concern them.
"We really had a lot of input
from a lot of staff feeding into the
process," Aslanian said. "It
wasn't a matter of the President's
staff sitting in a room with the
windows closed and just dreaming up what would be the best

recommendations and
them float through the
tee structure."
SAC member Judy Lord,

Academy, where they were
chained to each other, given no
food or water and denied any
form of required medication (including Weiss' inhaler for
asthma). Police also allegedly violated the students' right to know
what they were charged for, guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment.
Given the option of paying a
$5O fine and admitting their guilt
or waiting for a judge to hear
their case the next day, the four
chose the former. After being
arrested at approximately 5:30
p.m., they were released at 2:00
a.m. Sunday morning.
All of the Swarthmore protesters came together Sunday at the
main protest ground: the ellipse
between the White House and the
Washington Monument, near the
IMF and the World Bank.
Protesters including such figures as filmmaker Michael
Moore, consumer advocate
Ralph Nader and the folk duo Indigo Girls marched loudly but
for the most part peacefully.
Jonah Eaton 'O2 described the
atmosphere as that of an entertainment event. The march was
immediately followed by a
scuffle among protest groups
sparked by a number of anarchists.
Contrary to what some protesters had aimed for, no IMF/World
Bank conferences were shut
down in the course of the protests.
As students returned to campus on Sunday and Monday evenings, the discussion of the global political economy continued.
Some students who did not attend
the protest remained ambiguous
about their own participation in
the protest. Many said they didn't
feel knowledgeable enough to
confidently protest.

Professor Thompson Bradley,
modern language and literatures
department chair and a veteraa

protest organization with stu-!

very thoughtfully organized, and
anticipated further collaboration
with students on the issue of globalization.

the protest a success because
Al6 received significant attention from the press and the public, further pushing the issue of
globalization onto the political |

Economics professor Kupei 1

compared the protesters to
"Luke Skywalkers fighting

found the varying degrees of demands from "shutting down the

reform" to be an unproductive
approach.
Political science professor
Bruce Morrison pointed out that

Math Forum acquired by online software company
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
The Math Forum, a mathematics education Web site and
Swarthmore College's first and
only spin-off business, was acquired April 4 by WebCT, a
course-authoring software company.
The partnership is the culmination of the Math Forum's extended search for a business
partner to help the Web site
(http://www.mathforum.com) become self-sustaining. Under the
agreement, the Math Forum,
while remaining an independent
online community, will be integrated into WebCT.com, WebCT's
e-learning hub.
"It was always preached to us
by the NSF [National Science
Foundation] that we would eventually have to become self-sustaining," said Math Forum
founder Gene Klotz. Klotz, a
Swarthmore mathematics professor, founded the Math Forum
in 1996 with a grant from the NSF

after selling off his previous
project, the popular geometry
education software program
Geometer's Sketchpad. "We had
been courted by numerous companies that wanted to sell mathematicalknick-knacks on the site
or sponsor the site and just plaster their logo all over it."
It wasn't until WebCT came
along that Klotz, now senior advisor of the site, and other Math
Forum executives felt comfortable entering into a business relationship.
"WebCT likedthat we hadbeen
developing an online community," said Klotz. "They wanted
us to continue doing what we
have been doing without much
interference from them."
Klotz said the fact that the two
companies shared similar educational missions and origins made
the transition to the corporate
world a little easier. WebCT was
founded by a computer science
professor at the University of
British Columbia in Canada and
has made online educational

communities a focus of its busi-

ness.
The Math Forum will continue
to offer its current resources for
free, although Klotz speculated
that "it's conceivable that there
will be homework helpers that
will have to be paid for." Klotz
also anticipates "tasteful" ads
will added to the site to help generate revenue.
Although the Forum, which is
staffed by many Swarthmore
alumni and students, will give up
its current NSF grant, Klotz said
the site is still developing a number of new programs for which
it will apply for NSF money.
A digital math library, virtual
study carrels and virtual reference librarians are all in the
works for the Forum, and Klotz
sees further expansion in the future.

"We'll probably expand our offerings for college-level and primary school offerings," said
Klotz. "We're also working with
other organizations in different
disciplines to start similar sites."

Crime, alcohol poisoning on dry Spec Weekend
From WEEKEND, pg. 3

A reserved-students e-mail sent Thursday
warned of possible revocation of acceptance for
specs caught drinking. Wharton RA Tracy McNeil
'OO thinks that, at least in her dorm, students sensed
the seriousness of the threats.
"A lot of upperclassmen watched themselves,"
said McNeil. She recalled two unofficial parties in
Wharton C/D with drinking, but added that specs
were "physically kept out" of these parties.
With a relatively tight noose on excessive drinking among specs and no reported incidents, students' main concern is there was too little fun to
be had last weekend. There was only one party
Saturday night, and a brightly lit one at that. (Apparently party organizers were clueless as to how
the lights dimmed.) Wharton resident Jessica Williams 'O2 said, "It seemed like a lot of people were
searching for something to do." She added, "There
were specs who were saying, 'Where's the alcohol?'"
Amber Adamson 'Ol, also a Wharton resident,
said that she is worried some specs were deterred
by last weekend's stifled social scene. However,
Admissions Intern Pat Murray 'Ol, who helped organized the weekend, said he heard of no complaints from specs.
"I think we had a lot fewer complaints [from
specs] than last year about not having enough to
do," Murray said. But he also felt that "the social
scene was somewhat misrepresentative."
Even if dissatisfaction with the social scene last
weekend was a non-issue for specs, it was a very
serious issue for students. Whartonhouses mainly
upperclassmen (C/D is exclusively upperclassmen)
and McNeil felt that, "On a weekend like this past
one, upperclassmen tend to party together." Williams validated popular opinion: "I think that more
people were drinking in their rooms."
Although there were no citations issued for underage drinking, the lack of a nighttime event with
alcohol had negative effects, especially in Wharton.
In addition to the alcohol poisoning, property damage and noise complaints, there were unofficial re-

ports of a drunken student who became belligerent while in Wharton C/D. Although no alcohol was
confiscated, private parties in Wharton, the Lodges
and Worth Courtyard were all tempered or even
broken up by Public Safety.
Goundie felt that the issue was largely one of
self-control. "I question why students can't not
drink one weekend out of their life," Goundie said.
But for some, last weekend's events were a clear
indication that a serious tightening of the alcohol
policy could easily cause more harm than good.
"There was a definitely a lot of action that might
not have been [in Wharton] had there been campus parties," McNeil said. "Whenever drinking is
there's a potential for danforced underground
ger." Goundie, however, stated flatly that theDeans
would not enact policy change that would bring
about such negative consequences.
Mamlet intimated that the dry spec weekend
policy could also undergo review. "I heard enough
people say that it wasn't enough of a normal social
life," said Mamlet, "to know that [the administration] will be talking about it."

After students expressed concern at a fireside chat held April 4,
the Council on Educational Policy decided to remove the "major plus
one" restriction from its course minor proposal.
Some students were concerned that the restriction, which would
have prevented students from pursuing more than two educational
components, would have hurt motivated students.
Despite concern from some faculty that students were taking on
more than they could handle and that the current policy leads to
"degree padding," CEP decide to revoke the qualification at its meeting on April 11.
Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2, student representative to the CEP, said,
"Students did act as a catalyst." She acknowledged, however, that
the decision also sprung from statistics presented to the committee.
According to Whitfield-Smith, 93 percent of the past two graduating classes graduated meeting the "major plus one" restriction. Of
that group, only 11 students had earlier exceeded the qualification
to later drop a major or concentration.
The council will bring a revised proposal before the faculty for a
vote this Friday. A group of five professors headed by history professor Lillian Li has petitioned the CEP to reinstate the "major plus
one" restriction. It is unclear yet whether the council will act on

Dissident Wang Dan to speak
Wang Dan, a leader in the 1989 student democracy movement in
China, will talk Friday on the impact of the movement on Chinese
democracy and the state of democracy in China today
When the 1989 student movement led to the takeover of Tiananmen

Square, Chinese authorities reacted violently, killing and injuring
hundreds of students and civilians. In the aftermathof the Tiananmen
crackdown, Wang landed the top spot on the government's most
wanted list. Captured after spending a month in hiding, he spent two
terms and nearly seven years in prison before being released and
coming to the United States in 1998.
Wang is now enrolledat Harvard University as an undergraduate,
and despite voicing his intentions to avoid the spotlight and focus on
his studies, he has remained active in the democracy movement.
Wang's visit to campus is organized by Susan Lin 'OO with the help

Activities funds to be cut 19 percent
From CUTS, pg. 3
now hoping that the Deans' Office, which usually
foots about half of the bill for these events, will
cover the costs when its own funding falls short
next year.
Movie Committee, which brings recent-run and
older movies to LPAC and DuPont on Friday and
Saturday nights, had its budget cut from about
$29,000 to about $24,000. Because most of its
money goes to renting movie reels, Movie Committee member David Plante 'OO predicted a substantial decrease in the quality of films.
"Basically it means showing fewer movies like
'American Beauty' and more movies like 'Meatballs,' Plante said. Rental rates for recent films
can run upwards of $l,OOO, Plante explained, and
with over 40 films to show per year and projectionists needed for all of them, that equates to only
about $5OO per film. Plante predicted that four or
five "American Beautys" will be replaced by
"Meatballs."
On a smaller scale, the Ballroom and Swing Club
is dealing with serious cuts in just its second year
of existence. The club asked for over $6,000, most
of which, according to Swing President Steve
Salter 'O2, was for professional teachers. SBC
eliminated nearly half of its budget during spring
budgeting; with the across-the-board cuts, the club
is only getting 40 percent of its initial request.
"We are cutting swing in half and eliminating
Latin," explained Salter. "We will try to cut everything but the teachers as much as possible. I don't
want to charge dues."
The Swarthmore College Computer Society
(SCCS), ostensibly the largest campus group with
over 800 student e-mail accounts, was planning on
using their $3,500 chunk of SBC money for a new
Web server to replace Kestrel. Sysadmin Nick
Ouellette 'O2 said of the new server, "We may have
to skimp on things we'd rather not."
Brendan Nyhan 'OO, the student publications
coordinator, explained that most publications will
take the cut hard, because costs are extremely
inflexible. "You're going to see a much larger effect with publications than with other groups," he
said. There are certain minimums for certain
types of printing, he explained, and those thresholds are being undercut by the 19 percent slash.
As an example, he cited Small Craft Warnings,
which he said will not be able to afford the type of
publication that allows its poems to be bound like
a hardcover book.
The Phoenix is taking its own unique route to
coping with the $3,000 loss. According to Editor
in Chief Justin Kane 'O2, The Phoenix is only going to give the student body the number of copies
SBC pays for. This year, they pay for a copy for
each student; next year, Kane expects the number of copies available to dwindle to 800 or 900
copies. However, that move will not make up for
the debt SBC is causing at The Phoenix.
"We'll be seeking alternative sources to fund the
paper," Kane said. "We're going to make do in the
most disgruntled possible way."
WSRN, Olde Club and Drama Board will be losing a combined $9,000.
CIVIC, an umbrella organization for community
service groups, is being hit with a $2,300 cut.
Forum for Free Speech (FFS), which brings
speakers to campus, will have nearly $4,000 less
because of the across the board cut.
Not all groups have such disastrously high figures attached to their names on the SBC budget.
16 Feet will only be $lOO less wealthy because of
SBC, and Amnesty International will see $B5 in
funds vanish. But even for these groups, a small
cut can mean a substantial change in operations.
One of the biggest burdens SBC has faced in
the last two years and one of the most controversial is club sports. The Athletics Department has
gradually passed on the financial burden of club
sports to SBC but has also given $lO,OOO a year to
cover club sports costs. However, according to
Barron, "This year we've seen participation in club
sports double." Five club sports men's and
women's rugby and ultimate and men's volleyball
were allocated $25,000, more than double the
amount the college provides.
Kate Fama 'Ol, treasurer of the women's rugby
team, sees the 19 percent cut as nothing less than
detrimental. "There's no leeway," she explained

BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Staf

Student Budget Committee Treasurer Laura Farra
watches Tuesday night as Student Council unanimously
approved an across-the-board cut in student funding*
of therugby budget. "It's non-negotiable
I don't
know how we'll function as a team."
One of Barron's slogans for next year is
fundraising, which he sees as a necessary andpossibly fruitful enterprise for many clubs. He even
suggested that some groups with limited benefits
to the entire college, such as club sports, shoulc
not be free.
But for rugby, at least, fundraising is alre&iy
an integral part of their enterprise. Fama said that
fundraising paid for practically all the team's
spring break trip to New Orleans. And club dues?
They're set at $25.
"We already run naked through Parrish to support our club sport," Fama said. "I don'tknow what
else [SBC] wants from us."
SBC is ambivalent about funding club sports in
the first place. While they get the impression that
club sports feel more comfortable under the aegis of SBC, committee members are also seeing
the burden of such expensive groups on the already thinly spread budget.
"We know things we'd like to push into other
places to fund," said SBC Treasurer Laura Farfa
'Ol, referring largely to club sports and The Halcyon. Student Council briefly discussed trying to
push the burden of Orientation Committee, which
they see as a largely a college event, entirely onto
the Deans. They also discussed revising the charter system, which would keep better tabs on active and inactive groups. But SC co-chair Jordan
Brackett 'Ol noted that these groups make up a
small part of the SBC budget, and better chartering would not necessarily mean more money.
But even as Student Council noted, all their talk
was largely an afterthought to the now inevitable
decision to cut student groups for next year.
Barron was initially worried about being hounded
because of the harshness of the cut and a lack af
leeway. But without a single complainer at
Tuesday's SC meeting and only a handful of nasty
e-mails, Barron was outwardly positive about the
...

cuts.

"Groups have been following the path of least

resistance," Barron said in regards to

funding,

adding that easy spending options that leech off
SBC won't be feasible anymore. In short, he
strongly intimated a leaner, more efficient funding system for the future.
And for those groups that can't handle the cut,
SBC has put $40,000 on reserve for next year
$lO,OOO more than normal. Fama said that the
rugby team will "have to go back and appeal for
everything."
Nyhan foresaw a more widespread de facto retraction of SBC's decision. "I think you're going
see this process where BC is going to give back
five percent of this cut," he said.
Unfortunately, this process could continue for
years if Nyhan is correct. Despite another expected SAF fee increase, this one for upwards of
$3O, SBC already expects a similar budgeting.,
shortage for the 2001-02 academic year.

Butchering Swat
Nineteen percent, $67,000
these are frightening
numbers, but they don't even begin to tell the story
of the financial carnage that now lies in Student

Budget Committee's wake.
How could SBC, a group ostensibly dedicated to
the smooth and painless funding of student activities, end up playing the butcher and leaving every
single student group with a skeleton budget? It's not
easy to screw so many people this badly. It takes an
entire committee doing their worst, bungling and
miscalculating and misrepresenting, transforming
normal students into economists without a shred of
heart or soul.
The story starts innocently enough a little more
than a year ago, when SBC, in a rush to give the
College Budget Committee a proposal for the Student Activities Fee and not anticipating this year's
increase in student activities, raised the SAF by only
$6, the rate of inflation. By the time spring budgeting
was completed and next year's needs were assessed,
SBC realized it had initiated a year of deficit spending and one in which nearly all its financial resources would be depleted.
Fast forward to February 2000, when SBC began
debating the amount to increase the 2000-2001 SAF.
Around $30,000 was left in the capital replacement
f:snd, but with the general fund in the red by over
$30,000, SBC found its deep pockets lined with
nothing but lint. The need for a large increase in the
SAF was evident, and it was only a matter of deciding how much.
Two viable proposals
one for an increase that
would merely begin to replenish the capital replacement fund, the other for a more substantial increase
that would go, in part, to preserving spending on
student activities
made a student survey. But the
survey, written by the SBC treasurers, made the
former option, supported by the treasurers and the
majority of SBC, seem like the only rational option.
Needless to say, it won.
The problem was compounded when the CBC cut
�he increase by $7 to fit the SAF within college
budget policy. Although the cut was unavoidable by
the time the CBC met to determine the final college
budget, Vice President for Finance and Planning Paul
Aslanian said that, had the CBC known about the
increase earlier, it probably could have accommodated it.
Through this series of missteps, the story winds its
way to today, where more than 100 student groups
are struggling to figure out, "Why us? Why here?
Why now?" Over the past two years, many groups
Student

Council, The Phoenix, College Democrats,
Solidaridad, club sports; the list goes on have
reached unprecedented levels of activity. Now many
%re left wondering how to maintain their success on
a shoestring budget. Groups whose events have
become campus favorites, like SAC and Movie
Committee, fear they won't be able to offer such
pleasures.
We wonder what caused SBC to decide that,
despite all the improvements over the last two years,
the current level of student activities wasn't worth
making any significant effort to save. In its reserved-students e-mail announcing the cuts Monday
night, SBC wrote, "It is not fair for us to continue to
spend at the expense of future students."
Is it fairer to hobble current students, even if they
may be willing to pay? More importantly, does
forcing student groups to curtail their activities
today contribute to the welfare of the Swarthmore of
tomorrow? We doubt the answers to these questions
are yes, but all Swarthmore students must wrangle
with these questions in the aftermath of the 19
percent cuts. We only hope those in power come to
the right conclusions for the present and future
college.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Psych services open to concerns
To the Editor:
On April 10, I visited Prof. Elaine Brenneman's
Education class as an invited guest to discuss my educational and training experiences, psychotherapy,
and Swarthmore College's Psychological Services.
Three days later you published an Opinions piece
("Psych Services patients risk deception," p. 10, April
13) that I believe has the potential of misrepresenting reality related to the process of engaging in psychological counseling. The article asserts, among
other things, that students are not encouraged to seek
information about the psychological services we offer.
Psychological counseling and psychiatric consultations are available to allenrolled Swarthmore students
without an additional charge. By its nature, counseling is designed to be a private experience. Nonetheless, we attempt to demystify the process and provide explanations whenever possible. This can include
a discussion of therapeutic orientation.We post a fairly
detailed description about what to expect from the
process, including how to proceed if one is dissatisfied. This description can be found at our Web site by
clicking CampusLinks. It is also posted in the waiting
area of our offices in the north wing of the Worth
Health Center.
If a student articulates a preference for a certain
characteristic in a counselor, such as a gender preference, an attempt is made to accommodate that request.
The staff is comprised of a diverse group of licensed
or in-training clinical professionals whose educational
and training experiences encompass most of the recognized clinical specialties, including systems theory,
psychodynamic, cognitive, psychoanalytic, and family systems approaches to problem solving. The approach used by any given counselor with a particular

student is determined by a number of considerations,
most notably the present circumstances, needs and resources of the student.
Over the six years that I've worked here, I've made
many presentations to student groups, RAs, staff, fac-

ulty, parents and the Board's Student Life Committee.
Within the bounds of the privacy accorded to the students we work with, my colleagues and I invite anyone
with concerns, objections or suggestions to share them
with us. This has been, and continues to be, a standing
invitation to the Swarthmore community.

Director, Psychological Services

Wild times
To the Editor:
An orgy breaks out at Sager, and it's publicly applauded.
My tuition pays for alcohol at campus parties, and the
senior class raises money by selling beer. The organizers of plays, lectures, a cappella concerts, and campus
jobs all offer the same ironic promises of orgasms and
inebriation for all.
We learn by making mistakes, it's true, and alcohol and
sexuality both take time to figure out. But by calling
drunkenness sociability and promiscuity free expression,
we risk as great a conformity as any bygone prudishness.

utterly hilarious, so unintentionally and
sublimely idiotic it makes you feel warm
inside sense. And I'm about to bring it to
you readers, and it's gonnabe quick, aight?
The pinnacle of this is Brian McKnight's
"Back At One." For anyone who's heard

around since Soul For Real's "Candy

Logically, it makes no sense. The first
four steps could easily be consolidated
into one, and the fifth is sketchy. The tortured lyrical extension over five arduously concocted steps, however, is unmitigated genius. See Sisqo's "The Thong
Song" for a sub-genre of this great-because-it's-goofy realm, the "freak" song.
Commercial rap has again reached the
days of the cartoonishly hokey late 'Bosearly '9os. I can walk into almost any room
at Swat, say, "Call me Big Daddy..." and
have someone tell me the temporal and
bodily context in which "Big Daddy" becomes an acceptable title. Rampant sampling may have removed artistic merit
from most mainstream rap, but I'll be
damned if it hasn't made it one of the most
self-aware sources of bemused entertainment in popular culture. Would anyone
have thought "Annie" could have been
redone as a ghetto anthem before the past
couple of years?
And then, we come to the daddy of it
all, pop music. You can categorize artists
who fit under this classification into two
subcategories: Britney Spears and "Boy
Band." Britney gets her own category by
virtue of her having come first, and the
fact that the throng of singers following
her seem to be exact clones of her, just at
different ages. "Boy Band" is harder to
define, because N'Sync, the Backstreet
Boys, and the other ones that don't sell two
bajillion albums sprung up almost simultaneously. And, I think, because of the
same person...
This genre is amazing, because it
springs so many horridly funny songs by
regurgitating the same words over and
over again: baby, need, want, heart, and
lonely. Just speak using these five words
often. Sooner or later, you're going to
stumble into a Christina Aguilera song.
Well, this is my last column of the semester, and I hope you enjoyed it. I'm going to be missing this like candy.

LETTERSTOTHE EDITOR

Mary Lyon RAs do Hate speech beyond
not discriminate
'inappropriate'

To the Editor:
We, the future RAs of Mary Lyon dormitory, are writing to
voice our outrage at what is a gross misrepresentation of our
opinions and flagrant violation of journalistic integrity. In the
article entitled "Lottery drama unfolds in fieldhouse frenzy"
(Living & Arts, pg. 17, April 13) an anonymous RA, presumably from ML, is quoted as saying, "I'm very excited that
you're not SWIL," in reference to someone choosing into the
dorm.
The two RAs who were present at the time never made such a
statement, and, in addition, asked not to be quoted at all. Not
only did The Phoenix print a quote, but went so far as to print a
quote that was not said.
This disregard for the truth concerns us greatly, but even more
important are its implications for us as RAs. Since the quote
was not attributed to a specific RA, it reflects poorly on all of
us.
Implied in the quote that was printed is the idea that ML
RAs don't like people who are members of the Swarthmore
Warders of Imaginitive Literature (SWIL). That quote gives
the false impression that we harbor discriminatory feelings
toward people who make up a large portion of our constituency, which is wrong.
As RAs we welcome all students into our dorm, regardless of
organizational affiliation, gender, race, etc. This is particularly
important given the recent discussion surrounding diversity
among RAs and their ability to serve their dorms.
We would like this misrepresentation to be rectified in order
to preserve our reputations and the reputation of The Phoenix
from the effects of this poor journalism.

Ms. Adamson is missing the point. The point is hate, not political correctness or semantics.

incorrect generalization about "frat boys" than what Ms.
Adamson refers to as "inappropriate comments." These "in&ppropriate comments" included statements like "fuckingfaggots."
I'm not saying that anybody's feelings are more important than
anybody else's. What I am saying is that Ms. Adamson should
perhaps read deeper into the article. She should try to understand that when Ms. Russo said the Sager party is "really a
straight space," she probably meant that queer people no longer
feel safe at the Sager party, not that straight people are unwelcome there.
It is important that Ms. Adamson spoke out because she was
offended, but I can't help but feel that her letter is downplaying
the fact that several people were seriously hurt by the homophobic incidents of the party She said, "Okay, maybe there were
some drunk guys there making inappropriate comments...." No,
that's not it. Ms. Russo's "some drunken frat boys" comment
could be called an inappropriate comment; "fucking faggots*is
hate speech.
Ms. Adamson herself said, "Wasn't the point of the party to
gather the wholecampus together to celebrate gender freedom?"
Yes, that was the point, but the "really drunk, really loud guys"
missed that point. I hope Ms. Adamson is satisfied that I did not
say "frat boys."

D.C. protestors don't know the facts
By Rohan Hooie
For The Phoenix

What protesters and other

When I heard about the tear gassings
and arrests in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, my first reaction, to be quite honest,
was a sense of amusement and satisfaction. I laughed when I saw the police officer beating up on those two punks on the
front cover of Monday's New York Times.
My visceral reaction to the protesters and
their trite banners and signs was violent
and angry.
I am repulsed by the ignorant people
who falsely dichotomize these issues into
some epic struggle of good versus evil.
Honestly, anyone who believes that the
World Bank and IMF are part of some malignant conspiracy to suppress the poor is
unwilling to make the effort to actually
understand these issues.
Last summer, I was fortunate enough
to work at the World Bank in the East
Asian Urban Development unit. I had
deserted my radicalism after working on
community HIV prevention in northern
Thailand and was interested in seeing
things from the inside out. I was assigned
to four projects all connected to the structural adjustment program in Indonesia.
The overwhelming majority of the people
in my unit were actually from developing countries; my unit chief was recruited
directly from his position as a city manager in Northern India. Each and every
one of my projects included community

critics of the bank also need to
recognize is that the Bank is
actually constrained from being
progressive by the elected
governments of some of its key
member nations.
consultation, education, or direct commu-

nity involvement. I spent most of my midday breaks at brown bag lunches where
I sat in as World Bank bigwigs debated
and decided the direction which the Bank
would take. Each and every person,
whether from Indonesia or the U.S., was
committed and dedicated to reducing
poverty. There was and is no conspiracy.
Which is not to say that there are not
areas in which the World Bank deserves
criticism. The bank has both made mistakes and has engineered successes. It
could certainly use increased transparency, more people without Ph.D.'s but who
possess community experience, a better
environmental program, and internal
mechanisms which hold it more accountable to its own standards.
Yet, what protesters and other critics
of the Bank also need to recognize is that
the Bank is actually constrained from being progressive by the elected governments of some of its key member nations.

For instance, when the World Bank and
IMF offered a plan at Seattle to abolish
all tariffs of goods exported from the
world's poorest nations, this was diluted
by the U.S., Germanyand Japan. While the
Bank is dedicated to debt relief through
HPIC, it has been given a measly $3 billion to deploy the program. Ultimately, the
Bank budget is a tiny $2O billion and is only
able to fund pilot programs. It does not
finance comprehensive development
plans, and as such it is unreasonable to
scapegoat it when the real issues are much
more complex. Indeed, it is ironic that
precisely when these institutions have
become more progressive, the protestors
in D.C. are calling for them to be abolished.
With such limited space I cannot but
begin to touch upon the myriad of problems I have with the protesters. To those
of you who have made understanding
these issues a major project in their life,
who understand the economics and politics, who have spent time working in communities, who went to D.C. and attended
and taught teach-ins, I give you credit and
we can respectfully disagree. But to the
white liberals and others who think you
can really begin to understand these issues by reading The Nation and Z Magazine, or who went to Washington for the
thrill of fighting "the man"... well, your
ignorance does the underprivileged a
great disservice. I hope you enjoyed the
tear gas.

In the New Economy,
there's no time to
seed, grow, groom,
promote or build
talent. You have to
hunt it down.
That's what we do.

Praying for
a good
campaign
Sometimes the little things bother me
the most.
"Vice President Al Gore said today that
if he was elected president he would support a ban on weapons in places of worship," began an article in The New York
Times on Saturday.
Journalists should learn about the subjunctive before they land jobs at the top
newspaper in the country. Al Gore may
be good at reinventing government, but it
really is a shame to see reporters reinventing language.
Speaking of good language, Al may
have given the speech just to practice his
p's (not q's): "Pistols have no place in our
pews," he said. Alliteration is great, but
I'm glad I wasn't in the front row, if you
know what I mean.
Shouldn't this little piece of policy ingenuity be a freebie? I know it's a long
time until the election and Al doesn't want
to unveil all the position papers at once,
but come 0n... who wouldn't support a ban
on guns in churches?
George W. Bush, for one. That's right,
in 1995 Bush signed a bill which allowed
Texans to carry concealed weapons for the
first time in about a hundred years. That
bill included a few exceptions, such as
carrying guns in churches, synagogues,
mosques and other places of worship. But
in 1997, Bush signed an amendment to the
law which got rid of those exceptions.
Nice work, huh?
Well, give Al a pat on the back, too.
His home state of Tennessee passed a law
in 1994 that allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons, and it made no exception
for churches. By that time Al was VicePresident, but he did not object.
In fact, 22 states now allow people to
carry concealed weapons with a permit
and do not make exceptions for places of
worship.
So does Al have a federal law in mind?
His campaign reports that this proposal
is modeled after the Gun-Free School
Zones Act, which was passed by Congress
in 1990. But that law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and was
struck down. I like gun control, too, Al,
but I don't think this is such a good plan.
Senate Democrats like the idea,
though. On Friday, they proposed that the
Senate pass a non-binding resolution declaring that Americans should not carry
guns into churches. No, this wouldn't have
the force of law, but the next time a guntoting monster who's read the Congressional Record comes marching up the
aisle, maybe he'll remember Senator
Lieberman's cute little phrase, "Bullets
and bibles don't mix." Who saidyour government wasn't hard at work promoting
your interests?
Bullets and bibles, pistols and pews. It's
a goodthing this column is going on vacation over the summer, folks, because one
thing that's not heating up is this campaign.

Student-run
disaster
One of the most liberal vestiges of
Swarthmore's activist past is the stipulation in the course bulletin that "up to four
of the 32 credits required for graduation
may be taken in student-run courses," a
policy which harks back to the 70s when
student radicalism often outpaced curriculum development. Now the fervor of
activism has died down, and with it withered the overwhelming demand for student-run courses, of which there are now
approximately two in any given year.
At a school which prides itself on having an 8 to 1 student-faculty ratio with no
teaching assistants, it is peculiar to the
point of being outright silly for there to
be student-run courses.
Students need not have any background
or have completed any coursework, here
or elsewhere, on the topic they wish to
teach. All a studentneeds to do is convince
a faculty member who will supervise the
course that it is a good idea once they
have such a sponsor all they need is the
blessing of the provost and the appropriate department. There are a few stipulations: there must be a reading list, and the
instructor must administer a final exam
or its equivalent. Beyond that, deadlines
are lax; a course does not even need to be
organized on time with all the other
classes because the provost can waive
deadlines "to recognize problems in the
organization of such courses."
It wouldbe shamefully uncharitablefor
the school to pooh-pooh on students taking initiative to learn, but it is equally absurd to award students full or half credit
for completing a course that is by nature
less organized, less rigorous, and taught
by undergraduates who are less qualified
than professors. Having returned from a
semester abroad, students are sometimes
forced to haggle for credit for classes
taught by professors. Why should they
blindly be awarded credit for a class
taught by theirpeers? It is not as though
the faculty sponsor is heavily involved in
the student-run class. Even the driest of
literature, the Swarthmore College Bulletin, admits that beyond approving the
reading list and administering a final or
its equivalent, thestudents have free reign
"normally with no further involvement of
faculty."
If the school wishes to promote individual initiative and intellectual curiosity,
they should do so by encouraging independent research with a faculty advisor; if
there is overwhelming demand for a subject that current professors cannot accommodate, then the college should import a
visiting professor with the appropriate
qualifications. That the college views an
undergraduate with absolutely no qualifications as the next best thing to a professor whois unqualified or unwilling to teach
is more bewildering than it is laughable.
Student-run courses are the academic
equivalent of the ugly bastard child kept
in the basement technically of the same
ilk, but so much less qualified and so far
removed from anything else offered here
that it is virtually unrecognizable. I say
lock the basement and throw away thekey.

Seminar survival for dummies
By Mattathias Schwartz
For The Phoenix
I was so anxious before my very first
seminar. Gee, I wondered. People had always said I was kind of bright, okay at
standardized tests and stuff, but was I
smart? What if I wasn't? Was there a way
I could fake it? What if the other people
caught on? Would the wise rabbi "Ben W."
snort at me for not reading Hegel in the
original German, tilting his head,
steepling his bony, learned fingers and
peering at me from beneath his spectacled
brow? Would the spitefully romantic "Andrew B." fulfill his dramaturgical urges
by pelting me with spitballs when I pronounced Nietzsche "neat-she?" Would
"Todd H." ambush me in the washroom
for a punitive snack-time swirlie when I
accidentally bowdlerized his beloved
Kant? I was all a-jitter.
Gee, I wondered.Wasn't there someone
I could talk to, some experienced friend
who could guide me through those crucial
first weeks? But there wasn't. I stumbled,
breaking unspoken rules of etiquette at
every turn. Later, I would learn that one
member of my seminar (let's call her
"Samantha G.") thought I was too kissassy. Others (the aforementioned Mr. H)
expressed concern that I dominated
snack-time with irrelevant pinball conversations! Sure, I'd learned some nineteenth
century philosophy, but I'd also made a
total ass of myself in the process.
You, dear reader, are lucky. You have
this generous friend, this kind sage. It is
I. So, without further ado, here is a short
guide to seminar success.
Conduct. Don't be silly, for you are a
solemn being. It would not befityou to say
things like "We're gonna get straight Foucault-ed up this weekend," or "It's all about
the Benjamin, baby," nor would you deign
to laugh at such undignified remarks.
Maintain that frown. Back straight, belly
up to the desk. If you must fall asleep, time
it right. Make sure you leave room for others to interpret it as a political statement,
a declaration of protest against the limited world of consciousness. Sleeping is
more than whatyou do when you're tired,
it can also be an act of liberation and rebellion, if you do it right. At least I like to
see it that way.
Notes. Do write something down. As
Sylvia Plath mused about her own college
years, "I shut his voice out of my ears by
pretending it was only a mosquito in the
distance and sat back enjoying the bright

lights and thecolored fires and wrote page
after page of villanelles and sonnets." Yet
she still somehow managed to make Highest Honors. At Smith, that is.
Snack. The key concept here is
spreadability. Everything you bring for
snack time (or break, if you prefer) should
eitherbe soft enough to spread with a plastic picnic knife, or rigid enough to accept
said spreadable materials. One should
avoid things like sorbet, beef, gelatin, dry
ice and the like. If your table-top soiree is
to be a roaring success, ProfessorPita and
Herr Humus should be guest list VIPs.
Books. "Doing the reading," as they call
it, is a good thing, but what does it matter
if no one finds out? And do you really want
to speak up and say something about everything you read? Of course not; you'd
probably sound like a fool.
So here's my solution: In order to subtly communicate that the text made a
mark on your thinking, you have to make
your mark on the text. Your books will be
within inches of your fellow students, and
they need to reflect your diligence, your
total devotion to the subject. Highlight.
Underline inmultiple inks. Spread a handful of colorful post-it markers throughout
the book to mark key points, making certain to emphasize the difficult middle-end
area, which many of your colleagues

might have skipped. Scrape the spine of
the book against the corner of your desk
to fray the binding. Leave no page unruffled. Rub a tablespoon of baby oil or
honey into the cover, wrap the book
around a baseball withrubber bands, and
sleep with it under your pillow. Read in
the rain, in the middle of a rugby matcn,
in a woodshop. Read in the shower, and
don't be stingy with the soap. If you've
followed my instructions up to this point,
your little friend will need a good scrubbing.
You are not only trying to show that you
read every last word (which you did,
naturally) but that you did so in a remote
and dangerous locale, taking breaks from
your courier mission in the Andes to
pause on a blizzardy peak and read a
chapter of Adorno, say, before catching
your chartered Concorde back to
Pittenger HQ. Now you've seasoned tha{.
shiny intellect with an extra patina of intrigue. And when the triscuithits the flan,
my friend, that's only going to win you
more hummus.
Interested parties may direct any additional questions regarding seminar etiquette to mschwarl@swarthmore.edu,
and I'll do what I can. Please be patient
with my responses, as I am awfully busy
this time of year.

SUZANNE WU

•

I once wrote a letter, one that I will never
send. I am almost even sort of afraid that
the person it is intended for will accidentally stumble across it someday and realize that it is about them. But alas, I am too
Hazy to write anything else, I am too tired
and too sick and too overworkedand have
spent all the time I would have used to
write this column complaining. So here's
the embarrassing letter, and it is even, conveniently, partially about a comic book.
Dear [name edited out],
I was reading "Daredevil" No. 11 when
I thought of you. The story is written by
David Mack, who you once saidyou hated,
but I know you were just trying to argue
for the sake of arguing and disassociate
yourself from his Asian fetish in order to
ingrain yourself into my good favor.
Anyway, the love interest/villain in this
story arc is a deaf woman named Maya
and her power is that she can directly
mimic any physical movement to thepoint
where she is a world-class pianist and
boxer and more importantly, speaks without any sort of impediment so that Matt
Murdock [Daredevil's alter ego who is
blind] can understand her.

Canibus:

In September 1998, renowned
freestylist Canibus took his act from underground to worldwide with his debut
album "Can-I-Bus?" His single "Second
Round K.0.," in which he lyrically battles
L.L. Cool J., put him on the hip-hop map.
Unfortunately for Canibus, his highly
anticipated album sold only 300,000 copies thanks largely to harsh reviews of the
unflattering beats found on almost every
song. In fact, many of the beats on "CanI-Bus?" seem to be designed to conflict
with Canibus' rhymes. Whilehot beats can
rarely make a bad rapper sound good,
weak beats can definitely sabotage even
the most talented of vocalists. Canibus
shrugs off his first album's disappoint-

"I'm not a beat-maker," he said. "I'm a
lyricist... Whatever everybody loved was
me; whatever everybody hated, wasn't
me. It was somebody else. I'm not responsible for the things people didn't like."
That said, it was just a matter of time before Canibus would be back.
And back he is with the sophomore release "2000 B.C. (Before Canibus)."
Canibus comes storming back onto the rap
scene with tracks like "100 Bars," "Watch
Who You Beef Wit," and the title track.
Each track features Canibus' uncanny
knack for spitting incredibly intelligent
lyrics with his rough and raspy voice.
Canibus has addressed the problems he
encountered with the beats on his first
album by severing his ties with "Can-IBus?" producer Wyclef Jean (from the
Fugees). Initially the split was passed off
as a mutually respective professional de-

Is Student Council
really representing
your 'issues'?

Student Council elections are here
again, and we have to face the fact that
low voter turnout is always a problem on
campus. Is the lack of voter mobilization
explained by general student contentment? Obviously not. Some of us read the
platforms, others look at the pictures,
most of us play the "to vote abstain or to
not vote" game, or we try to write in our
own name just so we will appear in the
list ofcandidates in the reserved-students
e-mail the next day. The fact is, however,
that student government is there to represent us, and we should vote in order to
feel represented. Low voter turnout is not
due to the lack of important issues on campus because, trust me, everyone here has
"issues." It's only when we talkabout other
people that we refer to them as problems.
What we need is for student government
to represent our real issues. I know, I
know. I will try to keep the "i" word to a
minimum. So I confronted our student
council candidates with a formal e-mail
asking them, "What do you propose to do
for Swatties marginalized by the dating
scene because they are, after all, a campus majority?" Surprisingly, nobody
asked, "What dating scene?" After several

ment.

Bear with me; I'm getting somewhere,
I can feel it.
So, Daredevil is having difficulty defeating Maya in the closing fight scene
because she keeps copying his moves, and
it made me think of that one time, sitting
in Denny's with you, whining about how I
don't like eggs and I don't like cheese, so
why are we here?, when you started mocking me.
I tried to laugh it off, said, "I won't be
mocked" in a sad little girl's voice, but then
you said it too, only high, whiny and nasally. I pouted and you pouted too.
I remember then calling the whole situation juvenile and you related how you
once had read in one of my trashy maga-

zines that mirroring someone's actions
actually makes you seem more attractive
to them.
I miss you. I don't know why, but that
seems to be the appropriate thing to say
at such a juncture. I suppose it's not so
much that I miss you, but that I feel like I
should. I'm also sort of even foolishly worried that my saying "I miss you" doesn't
hold any weight, because I've said it so
many times before, and now when I say
it, I say it with completely different intentions. Not intentions for our relationship but intentions (convincing) for myself.
There was this first date scene in the
aforementioned "Daredevil" comic book
where the girl is eating popcorn out of
Matt Murdock's hair, and he is laughing
so hard that an earlier face wound opens
up and starts to bleed. I am feeling quasiprofound, but that was sort of analogous
to the way I've been feeling lately.
I suppose I do have intentions for this
relationship. And I thought you were the
one who would finally open me up and, to
further the Daredevil analogy, to finally
make me see.
But, whatever. You didn't.
Dammit, I really wanted to believe that
it would be like you saidand we would live
in an overpriced piece of real-estate in
some over-crowded metropolis and have
a child named Derek whohates me. Maybe
we still will. But, frankly, right now,
through no fault of your own, the very
thought of you is even irritating to me. So
I'll stop writing now.
Goodnight, sweetheart. Love, Suz.

'28 Days' not humorous enough to trivialize addiction
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
I want to begin by setting something straight. Both
Webster and the New Revised American Heritage Dictionary define an addict as a person who is physiologically and compulsively dependent on a substance, who,
regardless of his desire to avoid that habit-forming substance, finds himself repeatedly returning to it, allowing it to control his life.
For me, this means that an addiction would be a relatively hard thing to break, something the said addict
would really have to struggle to overcome. Apparently,
director Betty Thomas doesn't see it that way.
In her latest film, "28 Days," she makes main character Gwen Cummings' triumph over her many addictions
seem like cake. Witnessing thenonchalance and straightup attitude Gwen uses to casually kick the booze and
drugs made me feel ashamed for my own little caffeine
reliance. If overcoming addiction is as easy as Sandra
Bullock (playing Gwen Cummings) makes it seem, and
I'm not strung out on hard core narcotics, then what the
hell is wrong with me?
In her role as Gwen, Bullock has a small problem. In
fact, she has several: painkillers, alcohol and nicotine. A
successful writer whose co-dependent boyfriend insists
on feeding her habits in a most unhealthy way, Gwen
operates in the midst of a vicious cycle, spending her
nights slamming down drinks as hard and fast as she
can, popping whatever pills happen to be lying around,
and watching the world blur before her. Each morning,
she awakens and feels the previous night, but is unable
to remember exactly what she's feeling, and pours herself a drink, swallows another pill, anything to make her
headache go away.
Her destructive, irresponsible behavior culminates at
her older sister's wedding (to which she shows up late
and sufficiently buzzed) when her drunken displays result in a stolen stretch limo run over someone's lawn troll
and into their living room. The whole mess earns her a

scathing earful from her sister and a 28-day sentence in
a rehab program.
Bad deal, or so it seems, until the viewer realizes that
the rehab program is actually better for Gwen than, say,
the local country club. Her whole situation is actually
pretty sweet; Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center for the
mind, body, and spirit is a place I wouldn't mind going
for vacation.
Once in treatment, Gwen has a few slip-ups... well, she
has two, really. She owes her salvation from temptation
to her stash of hard candy. That's right, she sucks on a
butterscotch disc, and her desire to drink and do drugs
magically disappears. If it weren't for her hoard of Jolly
Ranchers and Juicy Fruit, she'd be done for. When her
28 days are up, she's a new woman, clean and ready to
begin anew, even mustering the courage to kick her enabling, drunkard boyfriend (played perfectlyby Dominic
West) to the curb.
A plethora of things bothered me about this movie:
most importantly, the way in which it trivialized addiction, making recovery out to be a cinch, nothing that 28
days in a tranquil atmosphere withtedious group therapy,
irritating chanting and relatively little personal effort
can't cure.
The worst part is that the movie had the necessary
subject matter and the right material to create a decent,
emotionally insightful story. It was simply too contrived,
too Sandra-breaks-her-teeth-smiling-as-she-breezesthrough-this-thing-they-call-addiction... and what the
heck is so awful about her addiction anyway? Gwen
Cummings didn't have withdrawals (I guess her bag of
sugar accounts for that), she didn't experience any sort
of emotional breakthrough, she didn't even resolve, really, to get clean. One conversation with her counselor
(played by a much underused Steve Buscemi), and recovery just sort of happened.
I was disappointed by this movie mostly because it had
so much potential. The cast was good and the acting
wasn't bad, but the plot missed on all points. It was too
flighty and simple to have any profound impact on its

own in order to gather a general consensus of what students really want Student Council to provide. A suprising
number suggested (well, maybe not so suprising) changing the condiment bar to the condom bar to promote
stress-relieving activities.
"Condoms should be mixed in with those mints you take
when you leave the door at Sharpies," claims one junior,
who also thought that Sharpies was lacking in aphrodisiac food. However, a biology major argues that easy condom access fails to target the core of the problem and
we simply need to rid chocolate from Sharpies because
it ups neurotransmitters in the brain and creates a psychopharmacologic effect which is the same feeling we
get when we fall in love. With chocolate we have no need
for this feeling. That explains why there is never a
ridicously long line for the fruit flavored frozen yogurts.
Students also suggested improving dating and basic
social concerns through the academic policies such as a
Dating PDC, which would require field work and a weekly
lab. One senior expressed the need for personal advertisements in The Phoenix and a junior added, "They
should at least let us pick the flowers on campus."
Other suggestions included a yearly distributionof the
Cygnet with updated pictures and more information than
just the name of one's high school. And the list goes on.
I have simply laid out a few of the major concerns and
suggestions for Student Council to tackle. Now it is up to
you to make it to Sharpies to vote and demand that the
candidates represent your true issues.

The third feature from oddball Canadian auteur Maddin, "Careful" is a visual homage to
the look of early German and Soviet silent cinema. Set in a remote alpine village where
everyone speaks in whispers to avoid setting off avalanches, the film is a hilarious parable
of isolation, timidity, and repression. It is both hilarious satire and a visual stunner.

I know many of you have missed my, shall we say, outspoken presence,
especially those of you who served on Student Council the first semester. In
the fall, I will be back from my Semester in Washington, and I will be bringing
with me a whole new outlook on what this school needs. Swarthmore has
other colleges beat in a lot of areas.We are better academically, and we have a
better overall ranking. Among most circles, we are more respected both for
our intellect and work ethic. Sure, Harvard makes fun of us, but deep down we
all know that sometimes they wish they could be a little bit more like us.
Academically, Swarthmore is unquestionably first class. Socially... well, who
cares? We don'thave time for that anyway. I am not suggesting a massive overhaul of the way Swarthmore does business, because we all know that it wouldn't
happen, and if it did, we just wouldn't be Swatties any more. But that is not to
say that the Swarthmore campus couldn't be a little more user friendly in little
ways, that would make everyone's life easier.
I can think of a lot of things, like better snack bar hours, or increased access
to certain buildings after hours, a few ideas among many. I know, we have been
over these before, and they do bear re-examining. But thereis on e way in
which the school I now attend is fair superior to Swarthmore
swipe cards.
Here at GW, swipe cards serve a far wider purpose than you might think.
Sure, you can use them to pay for mealsand get into dorms. But they also serve
a variety of other purposes. For instance, you are an engineer working late on
a project, which lam sure happens very rarely.You need to get into Hicks, but
the school locks the building at night because they don't want just anyone
wandering in.With swipe cards, the building's card reader can be configured to
let in only cards that are correctly coded for building entry.
It's Sunday, and though you are not looking forward to it, it is laundry time
again. But damn, you just can't find enough quarters, and you really don't want
to trek all over campus to come up with 5 dollars in quarters to do 3 loads of
laundry,plus who knows if the game room still has that change machine.With
swipe cards, the machines can accept points, or dollars you put on at the
beginning of the semester. No more looking for quarters.
Here at GW, local restaurants, dry cleaners, etc. also all.ow you to use the
card,same as a debitcard. Just take your student ID card with you, and it works
the same as cash.There are so many benefits it would take this wholepaper to
discuss them.
Plus, let's face itThe school is going to have to switch over eventually, as we
become more and more technology friendly. We might as well switch over
while some of us can still enjoy it, or at least before our children choose
another school that is more student friendly over Swarthmore.
Elect me as your representative to the College Budget Committee. This
position needs someone who has experience with the student government,
and a good workingrelationship with the Deans and President of the College.
More than that, it needs someone who has experience working with professionals on a regular basis, someone who has experience lobbying committees,
and who will do whatever it takes to make sure that while we still need to
work on having a better social atmosphere, at least our lives can be more
convenient, and that we have one less thing to worry about
Elect me, Dave Thomas to CBC so I can put my effort and experience to
work for you. Let's make sure something can get done.

Peter Holm'ol
Swarthmore is a great place. Really, it is.Yes, everyone except your friends is
a freak,and yes, anywhere else I'd be ugly, but apart from that we really don't
have that much to complain about On the whole, you won't find better teachers, students, or staff members anywhere else. Indeed, wide-eyed specs wander
through, not knowing what untold wonders lie around every corner. Impressed
by the MullanTennisCenter (our commitment to athletics is legendary),dazzled
by the rows and rows of iMacs (the 21 st century is here!), and utterly stunned
by that paragon of everything good in the world—Miss Karen and her three
unstoppable spouts of yogurty sweetness—these kids just can't imagine how
the best college in the country could get any better.
That said, I'm one to wonder. Not that I'm a whiner, mind you, but when
good things could be better, I say, why not? Most of the problems with
Swarthmore are small, but they are problems nonetheless. And, being an idealist of sorts, I find myself compelled to remedy them. I'm not going to put down
a big laundry list of nitpicky things that are wrong with Swarthmore—the
proper place for that is Sharpies, not The Phoenix. But I will say that there are
plenty of policies and practices that go on here that despite what some might
say, are neither terribly "ethical" nor very "intelligent"at all. So why do we keep
them up? Well, I have some hunches.Let's just say that less-than-peakgrowth in
the endowmentand a return to winless football seasons are not on the top of
the administration's "To-Do List"
My goal as the CEP representative on Student Council would be to tackle
some of these problems with the following triple-edged approach. First we
need to identify what policies at Swat are either not working, could be handled
better, or are just plain "not good" in the first place. Second, we need to think
of ways to fix them, whether that means using common sense or imagining
truly new approaches to old, festering problems (for some of you, these might
include parking or student space, for others, Krispy Kremes...either way, it's a
problem). And third, perhaps most importantly, we actually need to get things
done.That means working with the administration and the faculty, coming up
with thoughtful and well-organized proposals, but also pushing hard enough so
that good ideas don't fall by the wayside.These are the things I plan to do as a
member of SC. Oh, and not to resign.

While studying in Central America this winter, I picked up a nugget of wisdom: When you move into a house for one year, you don't plant an avocado
tree because you won't be around when it bears fruit But if everyone planted
an avocado tree, then there would be one waiting at the next place that you
moved to. Our four years at Swarthmore are but temporary housing, and I
intend to use my term on Student Council to make that stay better for all
students to come. I have a strong desire to improve Swarthmore's academic
calender and curriculum program. I've attended two colleges other than
Swarthmore, so that I have firsthand experience of studying under three different academic programs.This experiencegives me a valuable perspective when
examining Swarthmore's own program. Not every good idea will work for
every school, but I have found elements of the other programs which could
supplement ours. My main concerns are protecting students' freedom to develop their own course of study and increasing opportunity for interdisciplinary programs. In addition to my interests and qualifications, I'd like to share a
small sample of the kind of changes that I will pursue on Student Council and
as a member of the Curriculum Committee:
Get the school to pay for all required textbooks for our classes. Sure, they'll
just charge more for tuition and it'll even out but the cost of my books each
semester have varied by almost s4so.That's 70 hours of work-study. For many
students, going over the book budget in our financial aid package can be a real
hit
No school on Labor Day. It's an affront to everything that "Quaker values"
stand for, and typical of the college, to start classes on Labor Day. I will do
whatever I can to end this practice as soon as possible and get Student Council
to stand behind the staff. Dining Services, Buildings & Grounds, Environmental
Services, etc. in their dealings with the college.
Increase the length of the add/drop/decide on pass/fail period. 2 weeks is
not enough time to decide. I want Swarthmore students, 2, 5, 10 years from
now, to have all of the opportunities and freedoms that we enjoy today, and
more. My time on Student Council will be committed to making this desire

Board of Managers Observer
Delonte Gholston 'O2
I know that you don't have much time to carefully read each platform so
we'll keep this conversation brief. I'm running for the position of Board of
Managers on the Student Council because I want to work toward making the
meaningful, sensible, but impactful changes that will improve our lives here at
Swarthmore.
Everyone knows that the Student Council, is far from an institutional or
managerial powerhouse. If you're looking to the student council to drastically
change your Swarthmore experience, then you should probably reorient your
quest. The one thing, however, that you can and should expect and, in fact,
demand from me and the Council, a person and a body that will clearly and
cogently articulate your needs and interests to the folks that actually DO have
the power and ability to change your lives at Swat
the Board of Managers.
And the greatest thing about the BOM is that they actually care about student
needs, and, guess what? They listen!
As President of the College Democrats, I've been fortunate enough to attend a few lunches with the BOM and have begun to foster relationships with
several of the members; they are an energetic and interesting bunch. Most
importantly though, they are eager to make Swarthmore the best possible
learning enivornment on the planet. How could you argue with that?And it's
clear that this commitment is far from a superficial or rhetorical one; on countless occasions they have stepped up to the plate, rolled up their sleeves, and
put their money where their mouths are, in a manner of speaking. Just take a
Ijlook around.
The work that I will passionately pursue during my two year term has very,
very little with any goals or intentions that I may have. It has EVERYTHING,
however, to do with you.Yes,..YOU. Like I said before, the Council itself is by
no means the most powerful body on campus. What it lacks in that regard, it
can definitely gain from the legitimacy of its connection to you, and its ability to
actively engage those (President Bloom, the Deans the BOM, etc.) with whom
the real power resides. So when you receive an e-mail, or see a poster advertising an open mike night, or when you see a student council representative
tabling in Sharpies, think about the little ways that your life could be better
here, and make them your mouthpiece.That's what they're here for,and that's
why I'm running.

There are a lot of things about this (our) school that I would like to change.
I want food in the middleof the night I want as many minors as I can fit into my
schedule. I want better housing and more parking. But the final decisions on
the most importantaspects of college policy are made by the Board of Managers, not by me, or by Student Council. This is why Student Council elects an
observer for the Board of Managers a studentrepresentative who acts eyes
and ears, though not as a voice, for the student body. I feel that I would be a
capable observer of the meetings of the Board of Managers. I am really inter'U ested in learning how this incredibly important committee conducts its meetings, and in being very close to decisions about collegepolicy. I believe that the
students should be the primary focus in every aspect of college business, but I
understand thatlimited resources mean that not everyissue can be decided as
the majority of the students might wish. As the student representative, I will
not be an impartial observer,but I will report objectively on the activities of
the Board, which I feel makes me the best candidate for Board of Managers
Observer.

Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2
The Fireside Chat on Minors two weeks ago is one of the main reasons
I'm running for re-election as the student representative on the Council for
Educational Policy (CEP).The ideas and concerns students raised there were
instrumental in CEP's decision to remove the "major-plus one" limitation
from its recommendation concerning minors to the faculty, opting instead
for a strengthened overlap clause. While we do not yet know if the new
revised minors proposal will be approved by the faculty (they vote this Friday), at the very least students' voices served as a catalyst for making the
minors proposal more equitable, less restraining, and truer to the spirit of
Swarthmore.
I see my duty as CEP representative as informing students about educational issues up before CEP through e-mails, signs, and the web; serving as a
conduit for student opinions to CEP and the faculty; and organizing forums
for students to voice their ideas, concerns, and opinions themselves-such as
last week's Fireside Chat Beyond minors, there are many important issues
with lasting impact that are coming before CEP and the faculty next yearlooking at the first two years as a package (WICs/PDCs, first-year seminars,
global studies req?), implementing (hopefully) minors, and others. I want to
make sure these issues come before students, too.
These are issues that I've worked on this year- I would like to see them
through. I feel my year on CEP has given me a wonderful foundation from
which to continue to work: thorough knowledge of current requirements,
greater grounding in Swarthmore's educational philosophy and institutional
history, and a sense of the possible limitations and obstacles to implementation (and a belief that we can get around them- no one ever thought faculty
would approve minors without the major plus one limitation). Most importantly, I feel my year of experience has helped me build productive relationships with the faculty and administrators on CEP and given me a stronger,
more respected voice to work from on CEP and before faculty. I'm sorry this
platform hasn't been pithy, (intentionally) humorous, tongue-in-cheek,or even
that amusing.These are the issues I care about think about talk about and
the reasons I'm running again. So I tend to get a little dense, serious, and
verbose when I talkabout them- that and I completely lack a sense of humorlet alone one of sarcasm.Thanks for getting this far.

College Planning Committee (CPC)

come true.

Chris Morello 'O3
I first want to say that my name is Chris Morello,but many students may
simply know me as "Cookie." Now that I have hopefully eliminated any confusion regarding my identity, there are a few things that I would like to accomplish if I am elected to the curriculum committee. In general I feel that the
student body should be granted more freedom regarding their curriculum
choices. First I would like to see the transcript rules be modified so that if
students choose to retake a class then their second grade will replace their
previous one without the original grade appearing in brackets. Also I think that
the Add/Drop period should be extended to a period of three weeks and not
two, I feel that this will allow students more of an opportunity to evaluate what
classes that they feel truly fit their academic needs and desires. Also students
should be allowed more leniencies regarding their Pass/Fail option. Students
should be given one chance to convert back to the regular grading scheme
without the use of a Credit/No Credit option counted as one of the four.
Finally I feel that the reading period should be lengthened enabling students to
better prepare for their exams. I feel that these changes would relieve much of
the stress that is inherent to Swarthmore. It is my goal to ease the pain that
effects so many students at Swarthmore and that is why I hope you will all lend
me your vote next week.

Secretary
Robert Cox 'O3
I would like to make the commitment to run for student council secretary.
this position entails a good amount of hard work,but I am willing
I realize thatdifficult
to take this
entry-level position to get a chance to learn more about
student council and how it works. Among the issues that I would like to address once on student council are the student parking procedure, especially
the public safety booting policy and tow policy. Additionally, I would like to see
some small physical improvements made to the campus and the dorms particularly the lounges. My biggest goal as secretary is to serve you, the student
body; I will do my best to keep a line of communication between the student
body and the student council. This will include e-mails (only when absolutely
necessary) as well as communication with individuals wishing to hear certain
concerns voiced on their behalf.Again, I have no political goals I only want to
provide my services to the student council because I feel that I am best suited
for the job.

Jordan Brackett 'Ol

Earlier this year, when I ran for Student Council Secretary, I wrote in my
platform that my ultimate goal was to be able to step back at the end of the
year and say,"Wow, what a transformation.This was a great year for SC."
Building on the successes of previous Councils, I am very proud of our
accomplishments this year; I think that this was indeed a great year for SC.
a more reputable,
I feel that as a team, we helped to make Student Council
accountable and responsive unit of representation for the student body.
The decision for run again for Student Council was not an easy one.
Ultimately, I decided that there is still much that I want to accomplish; my
time on Council does not feel complete. In the next year, Student Council
will be responsible for examining the college alcohol policy, will be pursuing a revitalization of the SC constitution, and will serve as the student
voice in any proposals for a hotel in the Ville. In addition, this next year
poses the challenge of continuing to make Student Council the central
voice of students at Swarthmore. These are all challenges that I embrace
and look forward to tackling. I feel that my year on Student Council,and my
semester as Co-Chair, gives me a unique and invaluable perspective on
facilitating these initiatives.
Most importantly, I decided to run once again because I truly have loved
the time that I have spent on Council. Each day affords us a new chance to
improve the school and the lives of students in the present and students in
the future.This is a commitment that I wish to continue until the end of my
tenure at Swarthmore College.
As we move in time future, I ask that you look into time past-into what
I've learned from my successes and failures-and elect meas the representative to the College Planning Committee.
It has been an honor to serve the students of Swarthmore College
throughout the past year; I hope to continue this pursuit in the future.Even
more so, I hope that one year from now, I can modify my ultimate goal,
where we can all step back and say,"What a great year for Swarthmore."
I thank you for your consideration.

Track strides forward
By Marc Jeuland and
Donald Nguyen
Phoenix Staff
The athletes on the track
team have been working hard

every day in practice, and that
commitment showed in many
performances last Saturday at
Gettysburg.
Notably, the women's team
finished fifth of eleven teams
and third among Centennial
Conference teams, and the men
had some strong performances
as well. In the throwing events,
Clara Fuchsman 'Ol threw a
personal best in the shot, taking fifth with a 34'2.5" throw.
Matt Rapoza 'O3 took fourth and
a quantum leap forward with a
new personal record of 40'10.5",
and Randy Keim 'O2 was fifth
in the javelin with a season-best
157'2" toss. The throwers have
shown tremendousprogress in
recent weeks.
Imo Akpan 'O2 ran some blazing times, setting a meet record

in the 400-meter race (58.32)
and also finishing first in the
200 (25.85). Even more impressively, she ran phenomenal legs in the 400 (with
Desiree Peterkin 'OO,
Raylene Ross 'OO and Emily
Gray 'O2) and 1600 (Peterkin,
Sarah Jay 'Ol and Alicia
Googins '00) relays, leading
the team to third-place finishes in both events. Jay took
second in the 1500 (4:55.3),
and Peterkin won the triple
jump and took second in the
long jump. In the 800, Christen Lungren 'O2 (2:34.6) and
Jessica Rickabaugh 'O2
(2:37.9) both turned in strong
efforts.
On Friday evening, Marc
Jeuland 'Ol set a new school
record in the 10,000 with a
time of 31:31 in a meet at
Haverford.
The Widener Invitational
is next for the track teams,
and then Penn Relays. Stay
tuned for results.

Doyon, Lloyd win McCabe Mile
By Marc Jeuland
Phoenix Staff
On Sunday night, one of the great
Swarthmore traditions was played
out in the basement of our beloved
McCabe Library: the McCabe Mile.
The race consists of 18 laps that test
endurance as well as agility, especially when rounding 90-degree
turns on the slippery orange carpet
we all know so well. Furthermore, it
is a shoving match, as throngs of athletes compete for the limited running space in the narrow corridors
of McCabe's basement.
Seniors Karen Lloyd 'OO, an elbowing specialist, and Jeff Doyon 'OO, a
sneakily aggressive type, took the
crown this year after being embarrassed last year by sophomores. Also
notable this year were the four
painted runners (covered in green,
blue andred body paint); Doyon was
one.
The race was first held by two
"Sewer Rat" Swatties (students who
studied in the basement) in the
spring of 1970. Dave Johnson 73 and
Peter Gould '73 decided that six
hours of studying was enough... they
needed a release
they needed to
run. And where better than in their
natural environment, the library? So
the two young men began to measure out a mile and determined the
appropriate distance for the run. At

as onlookers peer on.

10 p.m., after the library staff had
retired for the night, they pulled out
their running shoes and started the
clock. The following year, 18people
showed up to participate when a
friend hung a sign in the dining hall
advertising the event.
What began as a student prank
has developed into one of the most
sacred traditions on campus. Thirty
years later, the McCabe Mile has
become notorious, gaining fame
with articles in both Time and Runners World and even a brief TV clip
on the evening news.
The prize for winning the challenging race is a full-sized roll of
Scott Brand Tissue Toilet Paper,
which is the envy of all other participants. Why this prize? Thomas
B. McCabe 'l5, after whom the library is named, was once theChairman of the Board of Scott Paper, the
maker of said toiletpaper.
Prior to the beginning of the race,
a relevant quote is read from a book,
and the individual who identifies the
source of the quote may proceed to
the front of the line (which is determined by seniority) for the start.
This year, Jessica George 'OO successfully placed the quote from the
book of Isaiah, the book slammed
shut, and less than five and a half
minutes later, Doyon was the men's
champion. Lloyd ran the distance in
just under seven minutes.

Women's lacrosse
keeps on winning
By Amber Adamson
Phoenix Staff
Defender Kristen English 'Ol sparked
the Swarthmore offense with a career
day, scoring four goals and assisting on
another to lead the Garnet to a 12-11
Centennial Conference victory over
Franklin & Marshall.
English scored three consecutive goals
in the span of 1:42 to start the second
half. The natural hat trick moved the
Garnet from an 8-7 deficit to a 10-8 lead
with 18:47 remaining. A Diplomat goal
cut the lead in half beforeKatie Tarr 'O2
scored one of her four goals on the day
to push the lead to 11-9 with 14:48 remaining. Just 1:14 later, the Diplomats
were within one goal. At the 4:39 mark,
the Dips managed to tie the contest at
11-11. That set the stage for Erika Williams 'Ol to clinch the victory with a free
position goal with 2:21 remaining.
Swarthmore sent Franklin & Marshall
home with a 12-11 loss. Goalkeeper Jane
Kendall 'OO had 20 saves. Swarthmore
is now 2-3 in the conference and 7-5
overall.
The Alumni Game followed this solid
win. Alums who appeared included Lia
Ernst, Kelly Wilcox, Jen Hagen, Jenny
Harvey and Sam Peltz, just to name a
few. Apologies to those whose names
were left out.

Ultimate fares well at Haverford
By AlyssaTimin and
Paul Wulfsberg
Phoenix Staff
This past weekend, while many
other sports events were cancelled due to the inclement
weather, Swat's ultimate frisbee
teams took the short trip to
Haverford to play in the annual
"Layout-Pigout" tournament.
The men and women both did
well at a very competitive tournament, with the Earthworms
securing the consolation bracket
and the Warmothers going unbeaten until the finals, where the
first-place trophy narrowly
evaded their outstretched hands.
On Saturday, the Warmothers
cleaned up their round-robin
bracket, massacring Amherst 131, blowing away regional powerhouse University ofDelaware 132, taking out the host Haverford
13-7 and effortlessly plowing
through Harvard 13-3. In the
elimination rounds on Sunday,
the Warmothers won a hardfought defensive battle against
Yale 6-1 and defeated Bucknell
13-5 before losing to Tufts 15-13
in an incredible final replete with
layouts, hucks and other huge
plays by both teams.
CaptainLindsay Goldsmith'Ol
called the Tufts match "perhaps
the best game the Warmothers
have ever played." Their sterling
showing bodes well for the upcoming run on nationals, which
will be held in Boise, Idaho, at the
end of May.
The Earthworms struggled
much more against the high-caliber opponents, beating Bucknell
13-8 on the rainy round-robin day

before dropping three straight
close games. Cornell edged out
Swat 13-9, Tufts won out over the
Worms 13-9 despite being led by
Neil Pallaver and Penn beat
Swarthmore 13-10. In Sunday's
eliminationround, Swat suffered
a disappointing 13-6 loss at the
hands of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
However, the bitter taste of defeat soon became the sweet flavor of revenge for the Earthworms, as they avenged a loss
two weeks ago against Penn State
with a 13-8 spanking. In the consolation finals, the Swarming
Earthworms continued their
vengeful spree, defeating Penn
15-13 in a hard-fought marathon
rematch.
The Earthworms had very good
play from the whole team, with a
few players who deserve special
mention. Against Penn State, the
Worms pulled out two aces from
their sleeves with the surprise appearance of alumnus Imran
Posner '99 and rugger Emily
Sigalow 'O2. The 6'B" Posner dominated PSU on long throws, scoring repeatedly on hucks from captain Mark Murphy 'Ol. Sigalow
broke loose for a sharp pass from
Jeremy Slezak 'O2 before nearly
completing a swing pass to another Earthworm. Bringing her
rugby skills into the relatively
tame and civilized sport of
frisbee, Sigalow viciously fouled
a Nittany Lion who tried to mark
her.
Other highlights included a gigantic defensive layoutby Charlie
Ellis 'OO to turn the momentum of
the Penn rematch when the
Earthworms were down game

point and on their last legs. Unfortunately for the Earthworms,
Ellis turned in his resignation after the tournament, acknowledging that he was tired of making
the effort of playing club sports
at a school like Swarthmore.
Seniors Nate Schaffran and
Vinnie Pallaver led the Earthworms as always, providing big
layouts and steady handling at
key moments to spark the men.
There was a substantial freshman presence for the weekend,
though, much of it in the devilishly handsome form of Misha
Horowitz himself. On Saturday,
the spicy frosh dominated
Cornell University, going coastto-coast with huge layouts on the
defensive and offensive ends of
the field.
The Warmothers' Goldsmith
had some compliments for the
men as well. "It's always a pleasure to watch my boys
you
guys are looking hotter and hotter every weekend," Goldsmith
said.
Rahul Bhalodia 'O2 conceded,
admitting "not everybody sucked
... this time." Rahul wowed all onlookers with his all-out effort and
sheer guts.
This weekend, the Earthworms
and Warmothers remain at home,
playing against a team composed
of Swatalumnireturning to Mertz
field. At the advice of the team's
trainerBenson Wilder '99, several
Worms and Mothers are eating a
pre-game feast of a quarter-pound
of beef jerky(or vegetarian alternative) and drinking half a gallon
of chocolate milk each as quickly
as possibly before playing the al...

but surrendered one run. Fitti has been
the man recently on this struggling squad,
hitting at a team-leading .370 clip in his
final go-round in the Garnet uniform. For
a power hitter, he has done a remarkable
job reaching base, with .508 on-base percentage including four HBP and 11 walks.
Corso finished thegame 2-for-3 with two
RBIs and a stolen base. Brian Lopez 'OO
was 3-for-5 and scored two runs. It was an
exciting and much needed victory for the
Garnet, whose record improved to 6-12
and 2-5 in the Centennial Conference.
"It was easily the most exhilarating

game I've played at Swarthmore, right up
there with the Haverford doubleheader
last season," said Bartner. "The game
came down to the last inning, and we came
out on top. It was a team we really needed
to beat. A lot of different guys contributed."
Four consecutive days of rain have
thrown a wrench in the baseball schedule.
Last Saturday's doubleheader against
Gettysburg was rained out. And then
rained out again on Sunday. And then
rained out once again on Monday. The
Garnet faced Washington College yesterday, a make-up of a gamerained out Tuesday and then again on Saturday.

Purest things in baseball
From KUSHNER,p.2O

Ty Cobb. Ruthless, racist, revolting, the
"Georgia Peach" was the originalKing of
Swing.
Babe Ruth. His mythology transcends
the game.Red Sox fans still hold vigils and
sacrifices in his honor. Every year, drooling, rabid Sox fans (like Ted Chan) drag
Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, who
doesn't give a rat's ass about baseball, out
of her home and torture her until she says
she is rooting for the Red Sox this year.
Pete Rose. Pathological lying gambler
or not, "Charlie Hustle" collectedhits like
no other.
Not so pure: Mario Mendoza. His lifetime average of .215 gave birth to the
dreaded Mendoza line (which somehow
dropped to .200).
Winner: Ted Williams. Nobody knows
more about hitting. Nobody did it better.
"The Splendid Splinter" was just that,
splendid. "There's a tape of Gwynn and
Williams talking about hitting. Just sitting
there talking. Any baseball player should
watch it. It's the surest way to gain 15
points on your batting average that I've
ever seen."
Ted Chan
Purest Pitcher:
Criteria: The player that on any given
day can dominate a game. He has the
poise, power, and stuff to make a big

leaguer look more like a tee-baller
Mario Mendoza.
Runners up: Pedro Martinez. "Nobody
has more fun making batters look silly."

Greg Maddux. He makes the modern

Not so pure: Joe Niekro. Would use anything from spit to nail files to Vaseline to
try to get batters out and still wasn't any'

Winner: Bob Gibson. The meaning of
intimidation. In 1967, he had the most
dominant season ever by a pitcher, finishing with an unreal 1.12 ERA.
Purest Thing/Event:
Criteria: The one thing that epitomizes
the game of baseball and what it stands
for as the national pastime.
Runners up: The seventh inning stretch.
"Take me out to the ball game, take me
out to the crowd..."
Beanball. The game's most important
unwritten rule.

a perfect swing.

Baseball's
purest things

ally have a chance to get the ball to the
catcher," said Bartner.
Bartner was one of the big heroes in the
game for Swarthmore, a courtesy runner inserted for pitcher Carlo Fitti 'OO. Bartner is a
rarely utilized resource on the Garnet bench,
but on this day, he made the most of his opportunity with smooth base running and a great
jump on the suicide squeeze play, where timing is a key, but tricky, proposition.
The paper-thin 7-6 lead might as well have
been 700-6, with determined ace Steve Farneth
'OO, set to start the next day against Gettysburg
(though the games were rained out) warming
up in thebullpen. Farneth, despite being wilder
than normal (he walked a batter), slammed the
door shut easily, picking up the save. In an odd
storyline, both Swarthmore coaches, Mike
Petrone and Frank Agovino, were ejected and
Farneth was left to manage the squad.
Fitti 'OO picked up the win of starter Jay
Schembs 'Ol with a bend-but-don't-break 2 2/ 3
innings of relief. Fitti put five runners on base

I am Division 111 collegiate baseball
player because I like to write about patriarchal assault in cheesy inspirational
pieces of self-identity. I am Division 111
collegiate baseball player. Division 111.
Collegiate. Baseball. Player.
Well that was fun, moving right along...
A few months ago, I had a conversation
in Tarble with a few friends about what
we considered to be the purest thing in
baseball. At first, just three of us were
sharing our opinions. A few other people
waiting for their turkey-club-on-potatobread-hold-the-mayo overheard the conversation, which was getting rather
heated, and offered their opinion. Soon
after swiping twenty dollars' worth of
canned drinks and pop tarts with my $3.75
credit, I had almost ten people staking
their claim to having the answer. Since the
answers were intriguing but unsatisfying,
this conversation has resurfaced countless times over meals in Sharpies. The initial question of "what is the purest thing
in baseball?" has been manipulated into
consideration of the purest stadium, the
purest pitcher, the purest hitter and purest fielder. I've heard the arguments, compiled the statistics, and scratched my ass
Steve Lyons style long enough. It's time
to finish the conversation I started so long
ago.
Purest Stadium/City:
Criteria: A historical ballpark in a city
that lives and dies by its team.
Runners up:Yankee Stadium, New York.
The "House that Ruth Built" has been the
home of more world champions than any
other venue.
Wrigley Field, Chicago. The perfect
place for a day game with the ivy covered
brick wall and the Waveland Ave.
homerun balls.
Not so pure: Olympic Stadium,
Montreal. All three Expos fans are as die
hard as they come. Watch out for falling
roof tiles.
Winner: Fenway Park, Boston. The
Green Monster, quirky dimensions and
Boston's rabid, deprived fans are all timeless symbols of the game. This is probably
the only time anything associated with the
Red Sox has ever actually won anything.
Purest Fielder:
Criteria:The player who made spectacular plays look like routine outs.
Runners up: Ozzie Smith. "The Wizard"
worked magic with his glove.
Johnny Bench. He was the best backstop the game has ever seen.
Not so pure: Jose Canseco. His attempt
to popularize catching the ball with his
head fell flat when his first attempt ricocheted off his headand sailed over the wall
for a homerun.
Winner: Willie Mays. He made the most
famous catch of all time makes you forget he made many other great ones.
Purest Hitter:
Criteria: The player who didn't care
what you threw or where you threw it.. .it

Runners up: Tony Gwynn. He transformed batting from an art to a science.

bad. Swarthmore's Joe Corso 'O2 stood at bat
in this situation on Friday. With the score knotted at 6-6 against rival Franklin and Marshall,
Corso stood at the plate with a chance to put
Swarthmore ahead. A pull-hitting, fly ball hitter with a knack for driving in runs, Corso is
the Swarthmore batter you would want in this
position. All he had to do was drive one into
the outfieldfor a sacrifice fly, and Jon Bartner
could cruise in with the go-ahead run.
But instead, Bartner took off during the
pitcher's windup. Stealing home? No, a suicide
squeeze. Corso's bunt was nearly perfect down
the first baseline, and Bartner, aided by a tremendous jump, easily beat the pitcher's flip to
put Swarthmore up 7-6.
