Attendance Problems
Frustrate Budgeting
By Tara Zahra
Several times this semester, treasurers of student organizations have
attempted to meet with the student
Budget Committee, but instead have
only met with frustration. Budget
Committee has canceled multiple
meetings because it was unable to
gather the minumum number ofmembers required to make decisions.
Nick Lehmann '97, said the delays have caused problems for Ruach

since the club 4 s funding from

out-

side sources depends on what BC
allocates to it. He saidhe is upset that

members of a committee for which
so many individuals apply seem to
take their duties lightly. "There are
plenty of people who wouldlike to be
on Budget Committee who would
actually show up for the meetings,"
he remarked.
The committee, headed by treasurer Tanisha Little *97,musthave at
least seven ofits ten members present
in order to make decisions.Little said
meetings have been canceled three
times this semester because ofinsufficient attendance.
"Part of the reason we couldn't get
a quorumlast Sunday [April 9th] was
due to special circumstances," said
committee member Justin Herring
'97. "Generally though, some of the
members don't care as much anymore. It's been a kind of grueling
semester."
Little complained that she does
not have enough power to fix the
situation. A member can be removed
from the committee if he or she misses
two out of four consecutive meetings. "I'm not left with much room to
make decisions," she said. "The new
SC Constitution will hopefully give
me more leeway."
But according to Herring, who is
also a member of Student Council's
Constitution Committee, "the provisions we have now are pretty good."
He cited a rule that states that either
two-thirds ofBC or two-thirds of SC
can vote to remove any BC member.
"As far as I know, that power has
never been used," Herring said. "But
at this point in the semester it would
pretty much be useless anyway because we wouldn't be able to find a
replacement."

Some students believe that committee members are simply too busy
to put in the required hours. "I think
budget committee has been slack by
routinely not having quorums," said
Jen Philpott '97. "They're overcommitted." During spring budgeting, the
committee meets three or four times
a week for three hours at a time.
During theremainder of the year, the

committee meets once a week.

Appointments Chair Tony
Cheesebrough said that all applicants
are asked if they are aware of thetime
committment during the interview
process. "I can see no way to change
the appointments procedure which
would alleviate theproblem,"he said.
Cheesebrough did suggest that the
primary responsibility for taking action on thisissue lies with theBudget
Committee. Measures he would advocate include posting attendance
records in a highly visible location,
confronting truant members and removing members who are chronically absent in accordance with the
rules stated in the constitution.

Discussion Accompanies Performance of Passion
By Erik Huneke
The audience at this weekend's

chorus performances of Johann
Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion
were handed more than programs
upon entering Lang Concert Hall.
Five Jewish students, three of whom
were chorus members who decided
not to perform the piece, distributed
fliers which expressed their concerns
about theperformance and announced
a discussion brunch that was held on
Sunday, April 9 in Sharpies 111.
The students—NaomiMichlin '9B,
Leah Oppenheim '96, Shulamit
Shapiro '97, Vanessa Silberman '9B,
and Alexandra Volin '96—organized
the gathering because, as Shapiro said,
"This is a very multi-layered issue.
We didn't just want to scream. We
essentially wanted to be able to talk
about the piece, and to include the
people who don'tthinkthat it's problematic or who think it's problematic
but should be performed anyway."
Volinsaid that "one of the biggest
things that's frustratedme...[has been

creating] aneffective dialogue about
this piece," one which would include
people with a wide variety of views
about the piece.
Chorus co-manager Annika
Stroope '97 said, "The Swarthmore
Music Department and the faculty
and the staff...and the students that
were hurt all pushed dialogue forwardand did an exemplary job...[and]
made it an opportunity to learn."
Associate Dean Bob Gross noted
that "with the presence of Professor
Marissen, who is one of theforemost
authorities on the context of Bach's
music, it is clear that they were aware
ofpotential controversy and that they
had an educational context for the
presentation of the piece." He also
notedthat"the student concerns were
indeed instrumental in the instigation of the forum on February 17."
Shapiro, on the other hand, said, "I
frankly resent the fact thatthe Music
Department has made it seem as if
they would have made this an issue
independently of the students."
Silberman also believed that "if we

had not brought this up, it wouldn't
be an issue at all."

Carolyn Oppenheim, mother of
LeahOppenheim '96 and a professor
at Emerson College in Massachusetts, said, "I thought the administra-

Twenty Swarthmom students travelled to Washington, D.C. Sunday to take part in a NOW rally. Over 250,000 people
gathered to protest violence against women. Speakers said proposed welfare cuts could increase domestic violence
by making It tougher for poor women to leave abusive husbands. For a personal account of the event, see page 2.

On Tuesday afternoon, Dean of
Admissions Carl Wartenburg told
gathered students and faculty about
"how you got here."
In selecting applicants, he said, the
Admissions Office seeks to form
classes that are talentedand diverse,
composed of students that add richness to the community in many different ways. "We're trying to find
students that represent the society of
which we are a part," Wartenburg
said. His main goal, he added, is "to
put together a class that is greater
than the stun of its parts."
The most important criteria, he
said, are academic ability and the
candidate's capacity to take advantage of the opportunities that S warthmore offers. The second priority is
what the candidate can contribute to
the community.
An important consideration,
Wartenburg added, is the current "crisis in secondary education in theUS."
Inadequate schooling means that
many highly intelligent students may
be deemed unqualified for admission
because they were not fully prepared
by their schools.

This could mean that the College
misses the opportunity to admit students who have had limited opportunities and who could realize their full
potential at S warthmore. On theother
hand, "it is a highly calculatedrisk to
bring someone to campus who may
not be able to handle it here,"
Wartenburg said.
Addressing questions of proportions of ethnic groups admitted,
Wartenburg said theAdmissions Office wants the student body to represent the general demography of the
U.S. Some time ago, the faculty decided that 10%of students shouldbe
African-American. That goal has
never been realized.
There is no formal goal for numbers ofLatino students accepted. But

Housing May
Run Short Again
Room choosing could finish
with many members of the Class of 1998 still
unsure where they will live next
year. Director ofResidential Life
Myrt Westphal said yesterday.
Nearly 900 students have lottery numbers; about 800 beds are
available. If all students who have
numbers try to choose rooms,
those who pick last—rising
sophomores with high numbers—will end up without housing.
But Westphal expects that all
students who wantrooms will get
them by the time classes start
next fall. Some students who have
numbers may not pick rooms, and
next Thursday

spaces may open up this summer
if students who initially chose
rooms change their minds and
decide to study abroad or live offcampus, she explained.
"I think it's very likely there
will be unhoused students at the
end of the lottery, but it will probably sort itselfout," she said. "My

prediction is that people will
[eventually obtain a room]. My
goal is that everybody will."
Last year, 19 rising sophomores
left room choosing without
rooms. Westphal eventually
found space for all who would
accept the rooms she offered.
When the year began, rooms with
space for 30 students were empty.
Westphal said Swarthmore's
dorms can holdroughly 1250 students. RAs take 54 of those
spaces, new and transferstudents
will occupy 385, and Westphal
holds about 15 for emergencies
and students with special needs,
leaving 800 beds in the lottery.

ership has subverted the
democratic process in
trading the deliberative
value of the House of

Representatives for expediency.

In short, I think the Democrats
needlook only as far back as last year
to see some basic tactics for minority
party behavior. When the GOP lacked
formal power, they created power
through use of the media and by presenting a unified front. By contrast,

the Democrats do not yet seem to
have their act together. Republicans
have had only the most meager of
successes, but you would never know
that after the press conference they
held last week. Something, then, is
wrong. If the Democrats care to reassert their power in 1996, they should
be doing more to expose the weaknesses of the GOP platform.
Some might contend that this
would just cause more grid-lock, more

politics as usual, and more stagnation
within government. Perhaps this is
true. But if Clinton was correct in
apologizing last year to the Republican Party for not listening to them,
then clearly the Republicans owe
Clinton and the rest of the Democratic Party a similar apology for the
methods used to speed the Contract
through in the past hundred days.
Neither party has done a particularly good job of fostering discussion

with theother withinthe last year, but
somehow the Republicans have managed to use this fact to their advantage both last year and this year. The
Democratic Party souldbe concerned
about this..
Democrats should be screaming
louder than ever that they no longer
have a voice in Congress, that the
Republicans are doing the very thing
to which they drew attention just this
past summer. The Republicans are
stifling discussion, they are forcing
legislation through the House without full disclosure to the American
people, and they are playing "politics
as usual." If the Democrats want to
have a shot in 1996, they ought to
make more of this clear to the Ameri-

can people.

Brian Schwartz's letter to the editor entitled "DoLiberals Really Show
Tolerance" in the March 24th issue
of The Phoenix demands a response.
Not only has Schwartz failed to provide an adequate moral justification
for unrestricted rights to property,
but hehas also confused the meaning
of tolerance. If we have individual
rights toprivate property, as Schwartz
imagines, then tolerance is beside the
point. But if we do not have such
rights, then libertarianism is severely
misguided. I will argue that libertarianism, in the spirit of Locke and
Nozick, is unjust.
My argument is based on three
crucial assumptions: (1) Property (including money)
cannotbefundamental, for it
does not reflect
our

deepest

needs and interests. (2) Property does not
constitute indi-

vidual identity
in any important
way beyond the
minimal requirements of
basic necessities
and comfort. (3)
Morality requires that we

The market corrupts many of the
values which we desperately need to
save. One of these is care. The
market's valuing of free, self-interested behavior undermines our relationships and social obligations. Libertarianism is itself a definitive
vision of the
good life which
ought to be defended as such.

The Saturday evening LPAC performance, subtitled Rape/Race/Rage/
Revolution combines contemporary
movement and jazz with traditional
Asian music and dance forms.The comtance

bination animates and evokes connec-

tions between issues of gender, ethniciThematically drawing
togetherrepresentations from a range of
historical experiences spanning different
times and places, the evening's aesthetty and class.

ics translate into what Rho calls "a universal message" of reclaiming power
and confronting a painful history "in
order to draw from itand continue with
renewed strength."
Dancerand choreographer Choy created Seung Hwa with saxophonist and
composer Fred Ho, Royal Hartigan, and
Allen Won. A drummer and composer,
Hartigan holds a PhJD. in World Music
from Wesleyan University and currently teachesat the Graduate Music Studies
program at San Jose State University.
Allen Won's flute, clarinet, and saxophone artistry embody the jazz and classical genre. His ability is illustrated in
performances on a CD by his group,
MG4, to be released this July.
Raised in Hawaii, Choy recognizes
the likelihood of Korean-Americans
such as herself developing withoutwhat
she calls "a complete cultural experience," due to the prominence of deeply
imbued white-American standards.

Choy says that for her, dance and politics are "organically related" This connection makes Seung Hwa a medium
capable of penetrating the hitherto superficial historical portrayal of KoreanAmerican women. The work "acknowledges the lives and suffering of these
women," she says, giving them a voice
and informing the audience of their stories.
Hopefully, audience members will
leave the LP AC with more than an
appreciation for the lives of several

Korean-American women. The exhibition simultaneously weaves an inspirational message articulated in the concluding stage of this four-part suite. The
final section's name, Seung Hwa, the
same as the entire piece, refers to a state
of mental clarity which follows great
tragedy and hurt, stimulating a moving
forward by its recipient. Reflecting a
human capacity to overcome imposing
adversity, the last stage ultimately should
prove empowering to its viewers.
Choy's and Ho's works primarily

to the themes of struggle, resisand the need for self-determination. Themotivation for Seung Hwa falls
in line with the previous projects of both
artists. "At the center of both Peggy and
Fred's art is a passionate commitment to
making art a forum for social and political change," said Rho.
Philanthropic contributions underscore Choy's choreography. She has
been instrumental in forming the first
Asian/Pacific Women's alliance in
Madison, while the Wisconsin Arts
Board has designated her Artist-inEducation for her work with high school
students and curriculum. At present, she
continues fighting for an AsianAmerican Studies Program at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.
Furthermore, aside from directing the
outreach and arts programming at the
University, Choy is involved in building
an alternative school for children in a
MadisonCambodian community.

of the new tongue of anti-

That both the show's producer

have escaped the filmmakers completely—barring one incongruous
scene in which the investigator's
wife calls him "the Uncle Tomof the
Jews," the subject isn't even brought
up.
Instead of giving us social context, the film concentrates on the
relationship between Van Doren and
his father (Paul Scofield). What
started off as story of one generation's Watergate devolves into the

"drama" of a son's failure to please

Good Lovin'

Brash Claims Prove Sweet

By David Rich

By lan Bricke

Yes, there is such a thing as truth in advertising, and Matthew Sweet's new
album (his fifth) proves it. Ambitiously billed as 100% Fun, the album delivers.
With the help of new producer Brendan O'Brien (Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl
Jam), who gives the songs a pleasantly ragged sheen, Sweet has finally crafted
the perfect pop album that his fans have been waiting for since "Girlfriend."
The wild, distorted guitars of 1993's Altered Beast have been tamed a bit,
making more room for Sweet's voice (sounding better then ever, especially on
the Beach Boys-style coda of"Not When I Need It" and the mournful ballad "I
Almost Forgot") and the lyrics which offset the songs' hookiness with a bracing
darkness). Not that this isn't a guitar album, mind you, not with legends Robert
Quine and Richard Lloyd spitting monstrous hooks and riffs all over "Sick of
Myself and "Super Baby," two of the best rock songs I've heard this year.
But 100%'s strength lies in the subtle details—the way the guitar hook on "Sick
of Myself' stutters back for two encores, the power-ballad electric piano on
"Everything Changes," the Middle Eastern flavor of "Lost My Mind" (the best Led
Zeppelin song since "Kashmir"), and the harpsichord and mandolin in the background of "Walk Out."
Sweet plays most of the album's instruments himself, withable assistance from
Quine, Lloyd, O'Brien, pedal steel guitarist Greg Leisz, and drummers Stuart
Johnson and Ric Menck. His songwriting has never been more consistent. There isn't
a bad, or even mediocre, song on the whole album. Like all great rock n' roll heroes,
Matthew Sweet offers something instantly familiar yet completely fresh, almost primal in its power. In other words, 100% Fun.

attempts to answer these questions through the
eyes of a man who thinks he's the world's

MarlonBrando is the psychiatrist who initial- I

star, but her role as Brando's wife is virtual- m

insists that Brando is Don Octavio and that fl
he is deluding himself into believing that fl

see Brando become infused with the con- fl

desires in life. As viewers, we are forced
to make our own evaluations and decide who is
insane and who is more grounded in reality.
(Whereas, in Highlander 111, we knew they
were all crazy for making the bloody thing...)
Here's the thing: the movie is really, really
fluffy. I mean, this film is so light that Jenny
Craig is trying to get it into those weight loss
shakes. But by the end of it you don't care a
whit. For those 105 minutes, you get transported and find yourself as caught up with Don
Juan as Brando is. If you're looking for a film
to debate for hours over coffee at the Cow, go
see Priest or something; If you want beautiful
people living in a fantasy world, go see this
movie. Beware, the sex scenes are incredibly
tasteful, but so tantalizing (read: teasing).
The cast, meaning Depp and Brando, is fantastic. Johnny Depp is tan, rested, and ready.
He brings new meaning to the word sexy; it
was totally believable that he seduced a woman
who initially thought of him as some bozo from
a costume party. And not a bad line, either... It
is such a thrill to see Depp acting again, rather
than wandering around on screen looking cute;
with the exception of Ed Wood, he hasn't done
any real acting since Cry Baby. Very simply,
Brando still has power. And, it's not in his lines
(some of which are intelligible) or his emotions; it's when the camera looks at his face
from a certain angle, or when you look into his
eyes just right, that you can s.till see the ferocious youth that drove his characters in days
past Even though he is the size of a house, he
can still move on screen with a certain grace
and style that comes with being Brando.
Who decides what reality is? Who cares.
That's the message in Don Juan Demarco.
And it's a worthwhile message for everybody
being ground underfoot by professors and work
right now. Take a break and get lost in the story
of the greatest lover in the world.

Sports
Baseball
From the "What else could go
wrong department" comes this week's
baseball report. It wasn't pretty for
the Garnetas they dropped four more
games, extending their losing streak
to nine games.
On Friday, Ursinus made the trek
across Delaware County to complete
the season series. The game threatened to be a slugfest early on. Ursinus
scoredfour runs in the top of the first,
and the Garnet responded with three
of their own. The score stayed that
way until Ursinus erupted for nine
runs in the middle innings to blow the
game open. Patrick Straub '97 was
roughed up in five innings of work
and took the loss. Straub and Jeremy
Bonder '97 each had two hits, and
Bob Mascia'96 had 2 RBI.
On Saturday, the Garnet traveled
to Baltimore to take on the Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays. The prevailing
winds and short dimensions served
as an omen that therewould be plenty
of offense. Unfortunately, the Blue
Jays supplied most of the offensive
fireworks as the Garnet dropped both
games, 6-1 and 11-2. In the opener,
cleanup hitter Mascia did the ding
thing, but the rest of the lineup was
shut down as Hopkins' starting
pitcher scattered four hits over seven
innings for the victory. Chuck Hudson
96pitched a complete gameand took
the loss. The second game looked
like one of those old "Home Run
Derby" episodes on ESPN as starter
Sam Voolich '96 was touched up for
three dingers in 5 innings of work.
The Hopkinspitching staffonce again
mesmerized the Garnet's bats, holding them to four hits, highlighted by
catcher Andrew Clayton '96 going
yard. The result was an 11-2 defeat.
Tuesday, the Garnet looked to end
their losing streak against the Diplomats ofFranklin & Marshall on home
turf. The Diplomats are one of the
most improved teams in the conference, and they showed why early in
the game.The Garnet was able to cut

into the Dips' lead during the middle
innings, but the Diplomats offense
proved to be too much as the visitors
outsluged the Garnet 18-8. Mascia
went 2-4 with 3 rbi, raising his team
leading total to 17, leftfielder Craig
Rodner '96 had three hits and stole
three bases to add to his team high 17,
and second baseman Matt Wiggins
'96 chipped in two hits.
The Garnet travels toLancaster on
Friday and returns home to do battle
with Haverford on Saturday.

heardthe good-natured taunts of S wat
alumni, as they attempted to relive
the glory days oftheir Ultimate frisbee
experience with the Earthworms. The
lawn was lined with parents andrelatives who watched the heated competition between the Old and the
Good.
Led by Alan Rudy 'B2, the alums
scored two quick points in an attempt
to demoralize thefleet-footed Swarm,
the Earthworms jumped ahead, only
to be bested at the half by the motley
crew of die-hard graduates. Co-captain Matt "Charlie Brown" Robison
'96 summarized this phenomenon:
"We let them ahead at the halfto keep
the parents interested. The outcome
of the game was never in doubt."
Indeed, the Earthworms were full of
confidence as they took the alums,
13-10. The two teams then mixed up
for another .round of friendly competition.
Easter festivities will keep the
Swarming Earthworms from the tournament circut this weekend, but you
can be sure that a few Ultimate freaks
like Lew Davis '97 will be chasing
the disc on Saturday!

obstacles in the tennismen's path towards a tournament bid.

The line-up for Saturday's game
was pretty much the usual with a few
exceptions. Dave Plastino '97, Dan
Maher '95, and Mike Topodas '95
formed a fierce front row, while Jim
Tracy '97 and Bryce Walker '96 provided strength as seconds, Jason
Dougal '96 and Eric Ellingson '95
were wing forwards, and the experienced forward captain Mike Madden
'95 was the eight man. In the back
line, Chaz Teplin '96 played fly half,
where he will have to remain for the

Blescia '97 played inside center and,
despite thebeating his face took from

Swat Softball
Searches for
Silver Lining
By Mary Elizabeth Alvarez
The Swarthmore women's softball team, led
by coach Cheri Goetchus and senior captains
Margy Pierce and Kimberly O'Sheahave fought
valiantly so far this season. With only 12 field
players and 2 pitchers, they've battled against
conference opponents Western Maryland,
Washington, Franklin and Marshall, Ursinus,
and Drew University.
While the team started off with a big win
against Neumann College 20-19, it has been a
rough season withoffensive beatings from other
teams in the conference. With the addition of a
strong posse of first-years, though, the face of
the teamhas changed this year. Offensive leader
Michelle Walsh '9B protects her teeth quite
well on third base. Local Dana Lehman '9B has
picked up pitching at the beginning of the
season, and has come a long way to help veteran Texan pitcher Rachel Brakke'9B in leading the Garneton the mound. Fernanda Gonzalez
'9B uses her speed in both base-running and left
field. Mary Elizabeth Alvarez '9B is talking it
up behind theplate and the in the outfield. The
new crop ofenthusiastic and talented freshman
teamed with the experience of the upperclassmen captains, Vanessa Motto '96 at second
base, rightfielder Alejandra Gonzalez '96, and
catcher Mollie Davis '96 has been a bonus for
the Garnet. However, the early loss of senior
JanineSpermandue to a battle wound(a broken
leg) incurred during the spring break trip to
Florida along with the already slim numbers on
the team, has proven to be an obstacle so far this
season.
In the opening week of play, the bats were

big for the team with a combined .400 batting

average in the games against Neumann and
Allentown. However, since then, the offense
has not performed up to expectations. Things
did start to pick up in the second game of last
Saturday's doubleheader against Franklin and
Marshall when Pierce sent a flamer over the
centerfielder resulting in an in-the-park home
run. Conference statistics show that Walsh
(.400), O'Shea (.273), Pierce (.316), andMotto
(.357) have been consistent offensive players,
with rookie Alvarez (.333) learning the fast
pitch ropes. Goetchus and the team hope to
further tap available power resources and increase the team average from .270.

Defensively, the Garnet have been picking
up thepace, trying to decrease errors and put up
a fight against any offense they might face
during the course of the season. They've come
a long way evidenced by the fact that Swat
committed only five errors in theentire doubleheader against both Ursinus and F &M. Statistically, Lehman (.963), O'Shea (.917), and
Alvarez (.889) lead the team defensively, but it
has certainly been a team effort with many
players being shuffled around to find the most
effective lineup. Kudos to outfielder Heather
Matayak '97, a rookie to the game who has
proven herself as a capable defensive player

first try. Seconds into the second half, rookie
Mary Catherine Arbour '95 kicked the ball to a

for a try. Bridget Arbour '97 addedSwat's final
try later in the second half. Mary Catherine

Arbour connected with a kick for two conversions and a penalty to seal up Swat's convincing victory.

Swat's B-side also dominated BrynMawr in
a shorter game against a very similar team to
