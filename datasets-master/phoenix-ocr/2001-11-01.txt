Student fasts to promote Drug convictions could
mean loss of funds
'contemplation' of war
students will be
Aid
officers stress few

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

BY BETH REDDEN

As American military forces continue a fourth
week of air strikes on Taliban targets in
Afghanistan, they have in their memory a series of
mistakenly
incidents in which they bombed
civilian targets of no strategic importance to the
Taliban. These mistakes have included two strikes
on a Red Cross center in Kabul, an unintentional
bombing of a United Nations landmine removal center and an accidental attack on a family's home
inside Northern Alliance territory, according to two
New York Times articles printed Sunday.
To most Americans, these are inevitable accidents of war. For the Taliban, they are a method of
promoting anti-American sentiment and support

An untold number of college
students from across the nation
may soon find themselves ineligible for federal tuition aid
under a new law that restricts
such aid to students with drug
convictions. The law, actually
passed in 1998 as an amendment
to the Higher Education Act, is
only now beginning to be fully

enforced nationwide.

Yet Laura Talbot, director of
financial aid, said that the law is
nothing new for Swarthmore's
financial aid office. She said
they have treated the law "as if it
has been in effect" for the last
several years and that the school
has not yet faced a problem
regarding the issue. In other
words, the financial aid office
has not encountered any applicants whom they believe have
had drug convictions, so it has
been easy to comply with the law
without any consequences for

from Afghan citizens. But for Alex Barney 'O2, these

mistakes mean something very different.
Americans know, he said in an e-mail to other
Swarthmore students, what the consequences are of
accidentally dropping a 2,000-pound bomb in the
wrong place. They know that such accidents are a
part of war. So, as Americans, he believes, "the blood
is on our hands.
"Our tax dollars are being spent on bombs that
might just be killing little kids, and no matter what
we do, no matter how mad we might get about it,
how many letters we might send to the editors of the
New York Times," those deaths are our responsibility, he said.
"The point of all of this," Barney wrote in his email, "is that I'm very sad." To show his sadness, he
has not eaten for four days, and will not end his fiveday fast until tomorrow night.
Although Barney, wbo said he was drinking juice
three times a day, has continued to attend class, he
has spent much of his time sitting in Parrish
Parlours, hoping to engage people in conversation
about his actions and to offer literature about the
war. Most of those who had come by to talk with him
as of Tuesday night were people he knew personally,
he said.
In conjunction with the new campus group Why
War?, Barney has helped lead nightly discussions in
Parrish Parlours about varying aspects of the war
and what it should mean to Americans and the inter-

Swarthmore students.

national community.
The way in which Barney has labeled his action
a "fast of contemplation"
was intentional. He is
dedicated to "asking the members of my community
to take time to think of what's happening," he said.
The last time such a fast took place on the
Swarthmore campus was a year and a half ago, when
a group of eleven students from the Swarthmore

Committee outlines wage recommendations

Helping students develop "a

deep concern for social and ethi-

cal values" and attracting to campus the best staff possible are the
wain goals of the Compensation
Review Steering Committee
(CRSC), as outlined in its guidelines for compensation.
At a series of public presentations this week, the committee,
which the Board of Managers created to review the college's compensation system, named nine
dollars an hour as a tentative goal
for the minimum wage the college
should pay to staff. It also suggested improving health care coverage for families and increasing

mittee so far, which has centered
on a study of compensation issues
generally and at the college, as
well as the development of a philosophy on which to base a new
compensation system.

"Our process includes time for
the community to tell us what
they think about our initial
thoughts," said Melanie Young,
director of human resources.
Their recommendations are
based on what the committee sees
as the college's mission.
"The purpose of the college is
to enable Swarthmore students to
become more valuable human
beings, to be more useful members of society," said presenting
committee member Sharmaine
LaMar. "We accomplish this by
helping them to realize their
fullest intellectual potential, and
at the same time helping them to
develop a deep concern for social
The staff of
and ethical values
the college is a very integral part
of fulfilling this mission."
"Like the faculty, we believe
...

that the staff also need to be the
finest in their profession," LaMar
said.
The presentation stressed the
importance of creating a compensation package that would allow
the college to attract and retain
such staff. It also discussed factors influencing employee experiences at Swarthmore, such as

opportunities for education and

advancement within the college.
"Our culture must be able to

help and challenge employees to
develop and contribute in meaningful ways to the mission of the
college," LaMar said.
The committee stated its belief
in the importance of providing
additional support to employees
in the lowest wage range. The
presentation, however, stated several objections to a policy of merely increasing wages. "We learned
that the living wage is often
implemented as a common wage

the law.
Talbot also pointed out that

Swarthmore has "had a history
of compliance with federal standards, while offering replacement aid." In the past, students
who have been, deniedfederal aid
due to a failure to register for the
Selective Service had this federal
aid replaced by school-sponsored

aid. But she would not guarantee
that a similar replacement aid
policy would be offered to students who were denied federal
aid due to a drug conviction,
explaining that since the school
has not yet encountered this
problem, it has not developed a
concrete policy on the issue.
Still, Talbot said, an admission to
a drug conviction on the financial aid form would have no bearing whatsoever on admissions
decisions.

of this law at Swarthmore so far,

admit to having been convicted
of a drug-related offense since
turning eighteen or who leave

worksheet to determine their
eligibility for aid. The worksheet helps students determine
their eligibility by taking into
consideration such factors as
the number and dates of convictions and the successful completion of sanctioned drug rehabilitation programs. Students who

admit to a prior drug conviction
will have their eligibility for
federal aid suspended for one to
two years, depending on the
severity and number of offenses.
Talbot stressed, however, that
this law affects only a very small
portion of aid most students
receive. She estimated that less
than five percent of the grant
money students receive is federally funded and said that the
majority of available aid at
Swarthmore is funded by the
school itself.

against the law involve concerns
that it doubly punishes drug
offenders and that it is biased in
targeting low-income students.
The idea of doubly punishing
students who have already been
penalized for their drug-related
offenses once is what sticks out
as most unjust to Rachel Jacobs
'O5. "Just because you've made a
mistake once in your life, you
shouldn't be punished again by
not being allowed to go to college if you need the financial

aid," she said.
Most disturbing to the NASFAA is the bias they feel is
implicit in the law. In a May 18

learning everything I could learn,"
he said. He enjoyed German, but,
he said, "little kids become restless," displaying a self-knowledge
uncanny in a 10-year-old. "I had to
try a new language."
Jess's fascination with French
language and culture began when
his family visited the country
when he was seven. He recalls the
atmosphere, he said, and, above
all, the food. "I'd like to read the
history of the country in the native

invincible.

Becoming multilingual
Jess's interest in foreign languages began early, specifically
sparked by the film "Big Bird in

China," which Jess would watch
over and over again. "I think I
still know that whole script," his
mother Suzanne said. At one
point in the movie, a monkey
speaks to Big Bird in Mandarin
Chinese. Jess would stare in fascination, determined to figure out
what the monkey was saying. His
parents, both lawyers, also both

tutors or programs around.
The problem was familiar to
Suzanne. She recalls taking Jess
from public to private school, to

even the Sidwell Friends School

in Washington, D.C. Widely
regarded as one of the most prestigious and elite private schools
in the country, Jess left after a
year because there wasn't enough
of a challenge there for him. His
parents ultimately had to turn to
home school material from
Stanford and to take advice on
gifted programs from places like

Harvard and Johns

Hopkins.

And, finally, for French, they
decided on Swarthmore, within
walking distance of their apartment across from PPR. Suzanne

approached French department
chair George Moskos, unsure if
he'd accept such a young boy in a
coUege setting. To her relief, he

consented without hestitation.
"It energized the other people
in the class, having Jess," said
Moskos, who taught Jess as a student in French IB last fall. "The
other students in the class really
took him under their wings and
made him feel welcome." His
presence encouraged the other
students to do better, Moskos
added. None of them, he said,
wanted to be shown up by a nineyear-old.

The disease
It was his first day of soccer
practice last fall when Jess heard
the pop. He was running laps
when his right leg made a funny
noise. His coach advised his
mother to take him to the emergency room, where doctors were

puzzled.
"They thought I had what they
called a unicameral bone cyst,"
Jess said. "That's just a single
hole in your bone, and they apparently grow and they literally

burst or break your bone." He
was sent to the Children's
Hospital in Philadelphia for more
X-rays and a MRI, which Jess
recalled as being "really loud."
These tests revealed a non-ossifying fibroma, a cyst that hadn't
turned to bone when it was made,
as usually happens. It was still a
bunch of fiber tissue in his leg.
Sitting right under his growth
plate, the cyst had to be removed
before it burst.
Doctors removed the cyst and
replaced the gap left over with
calcium sulfate pellets, to provide
substitute bone. While operating,
they also found the disease.

Jess's mother approached French professor George Moskos last
year, unsure if he'd let a 10-year-old into his beginner's French class.
To her relief, he said yes.
Suzanne remembers how the doc-

tor came out of the operating

room and asked her and Jess's
father to step out of the waiting
room, so he could tell them the
news away from other parents
who were likewise waiting for
their children. On top of their son
being in a body cast for the next
six weeks, they also received the
news that he'd contracted one of
the most rare bone diseases
known to man.
The disease bars Jess from
playing

any

contact

sports,

including soccer, his favorite

one.

He remembers camp this summer, when everyone else went to
play soccer and he had to sit on
the sidelines, playing chess alone.
The pellets left him fragile. "If I
slipped and fell on something
hard I could break my leg quite
easily," he said.

A recent picnic reminded
Jess's family of this fragility.
While playing Frisbee, he ran
into a grill, losing two front teeth
and chipping a third. Afterwards,
he was racked with fear, telling
his mother he was afraid he
wouldn't be able to speak any foreign languages without the teeth.
Fortunately, polymer resin teeth
now allow Jess to converse with
his classmates in French.
Even more fortunately, he hit
the grill with his mouth and not
his forehead, which, because of
his fragile bones, could have
killed him.

eating for up to three days during parents weekend,
according to an April 30,1999 Phoenix article.
Those students dressed in black and spent the night on
Parrish steps "to highlight the plight of the Iraqi population
under the sanctions" imposed by the United States, participant Dann Naseemullah 'O2 said. Although some fasted for
the entire weekend, others only did so for one day.
The Delaware County Daily Times was the only other
publication that covered the event, although "we contacted
every media source under the sun," Naseemullah said.
Unlike SPAC in 1999, Barney has not sought media
attention for his action, and he said his fast was more

geared toward motivating people he knows himself to

think about the war.
"The biggest reason for doing this, for me, was that I
knew it would be important to my friends," Barney said.
"There were kids [at the discussion Monday] night who
would not normally have been here.
"It's much more centered on Swarthmore" than on
other campuses or the national community, he said.
There was also little time to contact the press about his
fast, Barney said. He wanted to begin the action when the
idea was fresh in his mind. "Time is of the essence," he
said. "People are dying every day."
Barney's motivation to stop eating for five days also
comes from the idea of "self-sacrifice. Suffering a little your4

selfmakes you think of how little you're suffering compared
to those who are going to die from not eating," he said.
Much of Monday's discussion was dedicated to just that
people who are dying from not eating. The topic, "civilian casualties," centered partly on the view that the United
States is hurting Afghan citizens by making it dangerous
for trucks with rations in them to enter the country, and
thatfood drops are insufficient. Others there were about
20 students at the event
countered that the United States
was doing all it could to counter those effects by dropping
food for civilians.

Tuesday's discussion, which focused on international
coalitions, had fewer attendees, with only six people participating. Topics included American support of Israel and
whether it was best to focus reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks
on retaliation overseas rather than on helping those
directly affected in New York and Virginia.
Professor of political science Cindy Halpern plans to
attend tonight's discussion on the morality of war, which
will take place at 8 p.m., and Spanish language and literature professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt will participate in the discussion entitled "issues at home" tomorrow
at 8 p.m. Her husband, Arthur Schmidt, a history professor
at Temple, will also attend.
Barney's decision to fast was highly personal, but he
chose to work with the campus organization Why War?
after he heard of the group.
Why War?, which believes that "students can be an edu-

cational resource for the rest of America" about what is
happening overseas, handed out about 1,000 pamphlets that
questioned the war, entitled "History," "Civilians" and
"Liberty," in Philadelphia last Friday, according to Micah
White 'O4, one of the group's founders. Their goal in a week
is going to be 2,000.
The group proposes alternate methods of responding to
the attacks of Sept. 1L "If bin Laden is indeed found guilty,
then apprehension of a criminal would be entirely appropriate," Andrew Kazakes 'O4, a Why War? member, wrote in an
e-mail. "But it should run by the council, with international
troops. And military action should always be balanced with
non-violent methods, such as cutting off the funding to terrorist organizations and policies that seek to address the
grievances and frustration which feed terrorism."
The group is looking looking for seed money from offcampus groups and have included a "donations" box whenever they have passed out information. Tonight, they are
hosting Pub Nite to raise money, White said.
By the time they began putting up signs to advertise the
fast, Why War? had created a Web site, why-war.com, to
showcase the group's activities and proposes their view
that a "call to arms" was a response that would only promote greater terror in the United States. Why War? hopes
to add links to literature and videos about the war soon.
Unlike other campus peace organizations, Why War? s

chief aim is to act as an umbrella anti-war organization by
"branching out to other campuses," White said.

Students gather to support
college's queer community
BY JARED LENOW
The main topic of discussion at a gathering of approximately 75 students was
the controversial gay pride chalkings that appear on campus during the annual
Coming Out Week.
Jackie Aponte 'O2, a board member of the Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU),
and Emily Morris 'O4, co-organizer of the Queer-Straight Alliance (QSA), organized the Thursday afternoon event on Parrish steps, independently of their
activist groups. They emphasized that an allegedly homophobic incident the day
before at Sharpies, in which Jeff Rogg 'O5 confronted QSA member and SQU
board member Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2 about what he perceived to be the offensive

language of certain chalkings, sparked the idea for the gathering, but was not
the sole reason for arranging it.
"This anomalous and disturbing incident served, for me, as a kind of kick
in the butt," Aponte said in an opening speech. The confrontation, she said,
"propel[led] me into action that perhaps should have been commenced long
ago, not in response to this particular incident but rather in response to those
things that have been occurring much more quietly, yet no less disturbingly,
on this campus all semester." She said it had been a mistake to call the event
a "demonstration and open mike" because of the imagery and ideas aroused by
the word "demonstration" and that it would more accurately reflect the
intended nature of the event to call it a gathering. She said the goals of the
gathering were to show support for the Swarthmore queer community, promote awareness of the various homophobic occurrences on campus and provide an open forum for a discussion about homophobic occurrences and

Coming Out Week.

Aponte started the gathering with a brief speech, but the rest of the half-hour
event consisted of an open mike. The overwhelming majority of the speeches
dealt with the chalkings. The only reference to the Sharpies incident was
Aponte's brief mention of it in her speech as the catalyst, not the cause, of the
event. Speakers primarily disagreed on how the more controversial chalkings,
especially those that were sexually explicit or seemed to aim at "recruiting"
straight students, fit in with the goals of Coming Out Week.
"I feel like the chalkings alienated a lot of people," said Dann Naseemullah
'O2, a speaker at the gathering. "I know they alienated me to some extent."
Other speakers felt the chalkings not only alienated the straight Swarthmore
community but were divisive within the queer community as well.
"When I came here, I was closed to myself and everyone else. I saw the chalkings and it was really hard to see that and to think that that's what I had to
become," said Louisa Boiman 'O3. "I still have an issue with some of the chalkings. They're possibly more polarizing than helpful. However, since they're not
hate comments, they have a right to be there."
Other speakers defended the more controversial chalkings, saying they
served an important purpose and should not be condemned merely because
they make some members of the college community uncomfortable. "Queer people feel uncomfortable in that way every day," said Aponte. If the chalkings

Although they disagreed on the effects of the controversial chalkings, speakers unequivocally condemned the defacement of Coming Out Week signs with
explicit and threatening anti-queer comments, such as "die
fags die."
"It's a little unreasonable to expect an atmosphere of total respect when

"If
you're going to be loud and in-your-face, that's cool, but don't be surprised

Most of the students who attended the gathering agreed that the more offensive chalkings were counterproductive. "I understand the purpose of the chalkjugs, but if I was not more open to homosexuality and didn't have homosexual
fiends, I think I would be more homophobic as a result of them," Rajaa Shakir
°4 said. "I think you have to understand that you're representing a group when
you write these things, not you as an
individual."
Under a chalking that read "We are not anonymous We are proud," some
who had written the chalkings signed their names, but many other students felt this didn't change their effect.
"If you're walking and you see all these chalkings, but there's one that's realty offensive, that's what is going to stick out," said Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5.

Entire campus to receive safety whistles
BY CATHY DANH
In response to a slew of crimes on campus last spring, the Feminist Majority, the
Women's Resource Center (WRC), the

deans' office are collaborating to bring
safety whistles to campus.

scream" held each semester before finals,
next Friday at 8:30 p.m.
"The whistles will not solve all crimes

Rice initially brought forth the idea
after looking at other colleges' Web sites.

Rice emphasized that the whistles are

To deter students from using their
whistles inappropriately, a fine is in
place. For students who misuse their
whistles, "there will be a $5O fine," said
Karen Henry, gender education adviser

Professors come down on both sides of 'living wage'
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
"Professor Kuperberg and I have superior intelligence and therefore we will win
this war against immorality," professor
Amanda Bayer jokingly asserted at an economics panel on the "living wage"
Tuesday. Philip Jefferson and Larry
Westphal spoke against the idea of implementing such a wage.
A lighthearted crowd filled the Scheuer
Room to watch the four economics professors debate this concept.
"It is consistent with the mission of the
college to ensure a decent standard of living for all members of our community,"
Bayer said. Although she admitted that
"there are some negative effects in terms
of employment, these can be minimized by
implementing a 'smart' living wage poli-

cy."

This "smart" policy would involve
changes in the employment structure to

avoid the loss of jobs, ensuring that those
most in need of jobs get them. It would
also couple wage raises with increased

employment and training opportunities.
Bayer supported a "national living
wage" in the form of government subsidies for low-wage workers in order to
address the high child poverty rate and
decreasing wages for low-skilled workers.

Professor Jefferson said he believed
that "as currently constructed, the concept
of the 'living wage' is problematic at best

and fundamentally flawed at worst." He
claimed it would hurt those it intended to
help because it would lead to the college
eliminating jobs in order to be more costeffective. He also believed it would "help
many people who need it least" because

would apply to work at the college instead
of other places where they could receive
comparable pay.
"The living wage' would alter the composition of Swarthmore's workforce and
increase unemployment in local communities," Jefferson said.
In reply, Bayer advocated structural
changes that would separate hiring and
compensation in order to avoid eliminating jobs. While she admitted that higherqualified workers might begin to apply for
lower-level jobs, she believed the college
could implement policies to "select qualified people, not overqualified people."
As an alternative to higher salaries,

Jefferson suggested creating opportuni-

ties for workers to acquire new skills so
that they can get better paying jobs after
leaving Swarthmore. He also worried that

dents to feel that they are effecting

larger problems of economic discrepancy
in this country as a whole.
Professor Mark Kuperberg supported
the "living wage" at Swarthmore,
although not at a national level.
"If we really are serious about this
world community, we should be willing to
put our money where our mouths are," he
said. Kuperberg downplayed concerns
that implementing the wage increases

would have adverse effects on communities. "You can act locally in ways that you
can't act globally," he said.
Larry Westphal's opposition to the
idea centered on "concerns about what
performance incentives workers would
have if the 'living wage' were paid." He

College to renovate Parrish in 2004
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Parrish will not be gutted for renovations until 2004, when many current stu-

dents will have graduated. But students,
faculty and staff will play a crucial role in
helping the college decide on a development program and design for the renovated
structure. After the Parrish Building
Committee chooses an architectural firm
in the next few weeks, a plethora of interviews will begin to help the college decide
how to re-design the Parrish interior.
The college will only undertake renovation on the building's interior, allowing it
to retain its current stone exterior, said
Larry Schall, vice president for facilities
and services. He stressed that changes to
the inside of the building will depend largely on the information collected during the
programming phase, which will consolidate what students, faculty and administration deem useful and necessary in the
renovated Parrish.
After renovation, Parrish will likely
contain more student space, while student
residence space in the building will
decrease by half. One proposed change is to
add a large student space in the space the
admissions office currently occupies.
As for changes to dorm space, one suggestion is to consolidate all the Parrish residences into one wing. In addition, Alexis
Williams 'O4, a member of the Parrish
Building Committee, said the committee is
considering making Parrish, which currently offers single sex male and female housing
by wing, into a single sex residence hall for
women only. "There is a lot less demand for
single sex male housing," Williams said.
She made it clear, however, that nothing
is definite.
Changes to the building's visible interior are only part of what will occur during
the building's renovation. The college will
spend a large amount of the renovation's
ballpark $25 million cost installing 'new
electrical and heating systems. "Over half
the costs of the renovation will be in things
you don't see," Schall said, "It tends to be
costly to put [such] things in old buildings."

In addition, Schall pointed out that current law requires that renovation of existing buildings accommodate the disabled.
Thus, the renovation of Parrish will
include the installation of at least one elevator, possibly several, due to the asymmetrical architecture of the building.
The project may also include renovating

such spaces as the former mathematics

library beneath the Parrish dome, commonly referred to as "the ballroom"
albeit not for student use. The space "is one
of the most interesting spaces of the building," Schall said, "but most likely it will
not be used for people."
Schall explained that in a wood structure, like Parrish, fire codes dictate the
number of people who can safely be present
in various group spaces of the building. As
you move to higher levels of the building,
this number typically decreases. Thus, it
would be unlikely that construction workers could renovate the dome at the top of
the building for use as a large gathering
space.
Schall said that it is more likely,
although not definite, that the space will be
used as a mechanical space, possibly to
hold the large air handlers that the new
Parrish ventilation system will require.
The Parrish Building
Committee
formed last year and hopes to make a final
decision on a planner and designer in the
next two to three weeks.

The committee started with a list of thir-

ty different architectural firms, which was
narrowed down to a group of ten firms by
the facilities department. The building committee met and interviewed five firms, then
narrowed the group down to two firms.

Schall said members of the building com-

mittee would probably spend a day shadowing each of these firms in order to make
their final decision.
"We are looking for a firm with extensive experience in adaptive reuse of existing buildings," Schall said.
Once the committee selects the firm, the
next phase of the Parrish renovation project
will begin. Schall described this next step as
the "planning and programming" phase,

Quaker speaker tries to reconcile humanism and economics
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
Jack Powelson wants to know why a small portion of the
world is rich while an overwhelmingly large portion is poor.
He is not traditional in his field; in fact, his self-appointed label is "liberal Quaker economist." In two lectures,
jointly titled "Reconciling Economic Teachings with

Humanistic Values," he explained what sets him apart from
traditional, conservative economists and how his stances

that economic growth comes from within a country. "Most
of the world's wealth was created rather than discovered
or stolen," he said.
In Thursday's lecture, entitled "Globalization: Fact,

allow him to see the flaws in conventional economics.
Powelson, who is 81, spoke on Oct. 24 and 25 about how
his experiences with international economics in foreign
countries have enabled him to reconcile his Quaker beliefs
in humanism with the conservative thought of economics.
He opened his speech by stating that he never saw the need
to resolve this conflict because he has "never seen a con-

"In 1970,1 was in Kenya developing a five-year plan for
their growing economy," he said. Eventually, he said, "I
realized that I was being used as a tool of the upper class."
After realizing his helpless position within the government of this developing nation, Powelson decided to return
to the United States in order to devote his time to economics research and teaching.
After almost 15 years of extensive research in texts on
the history of economics, Powelson arrived at one of his
most famous ideas of the growing economies of developing
nations. He explained that the power the lower class holds
in swaying the balance toward one faction of the ruling
upper class and the expansion of trade among the lower
class is the driving force behind economic growth in the

He has served as an economic adviser to numerous countries throughout South America, Africaand Asia. He received
his undergraduate and graduate degrees in economics from
Harvard and an MBA from the Wharton School ofBusiness at
the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, he holds the title of
emeritus professor of economics at the University ofColorado.
A history of globalization began the lecture. He focused
on detailing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) that came about after World War 11. "At the time,
countries began to realize that multiple trade reductions
were beneficial to their development," he said.

with."

In the 19905, GATT developed into the WTO, Powelson
exlained. He then backed up his support of WTO. "For a
long time, Quakers had been talking about extending ourselves," he said, "and, with the WTO, I noticed that we
actually had a chance to do so. I was very surprised to see
that many of the people involved in the Seattle protests
against the WTO were my fellow Quakers."
Powelson argued that the WTO was a fair organization
that had more power in dealing with environmental issues
than governmental trade standards.
Powelson's lectures drew mixed reactions from the students in attendance. "I was very impressed by the number
of countries he had been involved with and the prestigious
nature of his co-workers," said Jared Passmore 'O4.
Most students, however, did not agree with Passmore. "I
was expecting a pure speech about the benefits on globalization, the world policy, and international organizations
for and against globalization," Josh Berney 'O5 said. "I feel
I got a speech on the life of a prominent economist with
parts of his personal theory."
"He presented a perspective that I had not heard
before," said Carla Humud 'O5. "Although I personally disagreed with him, it was nice hearing someone actually
support the WTO for a change."
"I was really surprised about his point of view. I didn't
expect him to have the same opinions as those of traditional economists," said Sarah Goldberg 'O5. "Although he presented himself as a liberal Quaker pacifist economist, he

came out and made the same points as mainstream economists do. It made me feel like there can't be real liberal
economists."

OPINIONS
EDITORIALS

Crucial renovations
Parrish. Not only is its familiar outline a symbol
of Swarthmore; this most central building holds much
of the college's essential character and life. It's an
eclectic place, combining dorm rooms, administrative
offices, a classroom, meeting spaces and a radio station into a shared space.
It has charm
complete with doors that open to
nowhere and even a forbidden top floor. Step into
Parrish and you gain a sense of what makes this college so unique. The flood of people exchanging greetings in the mailrooms at noon are a reminder of its
tiny population, the mix of study groups and activist
groups that congregate in Parlours a representative of
its stated purpose, the deans' open doors a tangible

clue to its attitude.
It's good to know this building is due for a little
tender loving care by way of a fix-up job in three
years. Yet these renovations will be much more than
a little spit and polish. By going back to the drawing
board to redesign the whole of Parrish's interior,
there is the potential to make this structure a truly
incredible space, but there is also the potential to
alter the building for the worse.
It is in the best interest of the college that students
have a stake in the planning process by staying
informed and sharing their visions for Parrish. It will
be impossible for the two students on the Parrish
Building Committee to adequately represent all the
ideas and concerns students (and even alumni) may
have.
What happens to Parrish is so important because
seemingly small changes, such as relocating deans'
offices off the first floor or reducing the number of
dorm rooms would have large, symbolic impacts. It's
good to hear that creating additional student space
will be a prime concern in reconfiguring how space
in the building will be used.
So far, it seems that the planning process for the
renovation of Parrish will involve opportunities for
student input, but it is essential that the students use
these opportunities. In the distant future, when we
return to campus as alums and show our children the
old alma mater, it would be great to proudly show
them a resplendent Parrish and say, "I helped make
this building what it is today."

Back to LPAC
Quietly, there is a celebration going on around
here. It's not really a birthday party
there are no
bright candles or loud noises. LPAC is turning 10, and
though you might not have heard, there are a lot of
reasons to be there between now and May: some sort
of major concert, exhibition and performance will be
hosted for practically every weekend until the end of
the year.
The Lang Performing Arts Center was completed
10 years ago and named for one of the college's
biggest financial underwriters, Eugene Lang '3B. This
season, LPAC will host an unusually wide array of
events, ranging from the homegrown faculty dance
concert to the recent performance and workshop
given by an expert Ghanian musician this past week.
This weekend, check out, among other things, the
Silesian Dance Theater, a Brahms concert, the installation art of Sam Gilliam and our own jazz ensemble
(see page 13).
It's easy to take the cultural and artistic happenings so close at hand for granted, or often, just simply
forget about them. Students may check out the opera
their freshman English professor wrote, or a hallmate's concert, but many other performances are

worth a look as well. Because events are often publicized only in the interested departments, many students don't even know what sorts of things are going
on.
Another compelling reason to take in LPAC's event
calendar this season? They're free. At almost any
other college or university, most of these performances would be selling tickets for $lO or $l5 a pop. So get
out there and get your dose of culture for the week
it's on Gene.

America is not the wholly evil 'Other'
Dear Editor:
In the wake of September 11, there has been a rush to
turn the world into Us vs. Them. Ben Schweigert knows
better his article ('"Dialogue of civilizations' needed," Oct.
11) is an attempt, no doubt, to stop America from thinking
of itself as the perfect country attacked by a wholly evil
Other. Unfortunately, in the process, Ben turns America
into the wholly evil Other, and makes the Muslim world an
impossibly angelic entity.
According to the article, America is a place full of"calls
for vengeance" where people are "harassed, threatened or
worse." America is a place where "people are willing to
believe anything, no matter how racist or absurd," a place
that believes that all Muslims hate us "because we hate
and fear all of them."
Such a critical look at America would be wholly justifiable if the article also turned a critical eye towards the
Muslim world. But apparently there is no hatred in the
Muslim world only "ill will" towards the American government. The celebrations in the Palestinian street of the
terrorist attack are dismissed as "dubious CNN footage."
Why exactly this footage is dubious, Schweigert does not
share. Is it still dubious after Arafat's own security forces
killed three Palestinians marching in support of Bin
Laden? What of the pro-Bin Laden marches in Jakarta and
Islamabad? Is that footage also "dubious"?
Schweigert assures us that "Every Muslim in the world
understands" the United States bringing the perpetrators
of the attack to justice. Yet the latest poll from the

LETTERS

Palestinian Bir Zeit University found 68.9 percent of
Palestinians responding "no" to the question "Is the U.S.
justified in attacking those parties responsible for the
attacks on New York and Washington?" In that same poll,
26 percent of Palestinians said that the attack on the World
Trade Center was consistent with Islamic religious law,
and 43.3 percent said that such attacks served Arab interests. Most interestingly, while Schweigert is correct that
Palestinians bear "ill will" toward our government 86.8
percent dislike the American government he ignores the
32.8 percent that say they dislike American people.
In the past year, Syria's Bashar Al-Assad has claimed
that the Jews killed Christ, and Iran's Ali Khamenei has
claimed that the Jews worked with the Nazis to create the
Holocaust. Just last month Palestinian Authority
Television broadcast a sermon condemning Jews as "donkeys" who have been cursed by Allah. Is hatred really an
American monopoly?

In Search of Values

God to Dann:
'lighten up'
One of those dreary, sunny 75-degree days of last week made me

feel like taking some time out from the world ofanthrax and bombs
and such. I took one of those fabled nap things that I've heard talk
of all around campus. I could have sworn that an angel came to me
in that nap. It could've even been the Archangel Michael (he doesn't seem to get out as much as Gabriel), but I'm not too sure, as
those halos can be pretty dazzling, just like those senior portrait
experiences in Parrish Parlours. After adjusting my head up and a
little bit to the right by instinct, I looked toward that light. The

'There seem to be a lot of references
to a guy called Dick on the way down
to Sharpies these days, and Pussy
his cat? I thought Myrt didn't allow
pets on campus."
angel said three words unto me, three words that I will never forget as long as I live. Those three words were: "Dann, lighten up".
So, day passed into night and into day again with pretty
depressing regularity while I pondered these words. Did the angel
mean that I should learn how to fly? That's fine for him, he has
those 8-foot wing things and flight training on his resume. Should
I lose weight? I do admit that I've been putting on a few pounds
can't stay away from that everyday Sharpies pasta bar, which
makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven. But then, since the
angel had to come on campus to give me this message, I guess this
place really isn't heaven after all.
After some more days passing into nights (you know the routine), I finally understood the revelation, just like when Bart
Simpson found out what the sound of one hand clapping really
was. (That's from the episode on the Mini-Golf Tournament, with
Lisa playing Mr. Miagi, if anyone remembers.) I started realizing
that I need to stop taking myself so seriously.
Just as I was about to resign as an opinions columnist and drop
out of school, I realized that the opinions pages of The Phoenix, and
Swarthmore College itself, aren't exactly synonymous with taking
oneself too seriously. Take for example my friend and colleague
David Ellis the 'Big Man on Campus' who takes offense at my
"vicious assault on those who dare to disagree with" me. I tried to
visualize myself transforming into a rabid rottweiler upon sighting any of the College Republicans or Objectivists and then maybe
tearing out their eyeballs with my canines or something. And of
course, there's my esteemed editor Matt Rubin, who wants this
campus to run around in panic when anyone sees a little laundry
detergent, baking flour or fine-particle parmesan cheese just in
case a terrorist wanted to decisively strike the very core of the
ahem Future Leaders of America. Maybe Matt should be genuinely worried, if Marvin Barron is indeed 'the Man' and the ter-

rorists know it.

On campus too,

there are signs that I should stick around and
see what happens. There seem to be a lot of references to a guy
called Dick on the way down to Sharpies these days, and Pussy
his cat? I thought Myrt didn't allow pets on campus. I don't get it.
It seems that there is a new peace organization on campus with a
Web site: why-war.com. The activists are finally catching up to the
dot-com craze. On the other side, Dave Haendler wants to create a
foreign policy that doesn't actually involve any other foreign
nations, except perhaps Israel, and those annoying Europeans.
After all, with missile defense, we could attack them from space
and not have to worry about allies, right? But that's back in the
opinions pages. And then, for the real reason I should stay on campus: if I left in search of my sense of humor, I would have absolutely no idea what the Daily Jolt is referring to anymore. God, talk
about alienation.
Of course, there's that other ridiculous guy with messy hair, an
unshaven face and a peace pendant, who goes around pontificating
about the Good and the Right who's about as fathomable as
Interpretation Theory. And he gets up on this high moral stand
based on no real moral system other than a few obscure moral and
political theorists, while still spouting out Leftist polemics like
some sort of latter-day Trotskyite. And he's completely dead serious about it, to the point offanaticism. Now, is this absurdly amusing or what?

and investment banking

In my senior year of high school, one topic dominated my life college. Thankfully, senior year ofcollege isn't quite the same; people aren't yet overdoing
the whole future thing. Yet to a certain extent our plans
for next year have displaced the latest campus gossip
as the conversational topic ofchoice. Like any year, the
senior class has a variety of different plans for next
year. Some are applying to academic graduate schools,
while others are applying to professional graduate
schools. Some are looking
towards non-profits and others

are looking to travel.
Perhaps the majority of seniors don't have the damnedest
clue what they're going to do after
graduation. It's definitely a tough

rest-of-her-life Swattie from pursuing a business
career. At any rate, the most fun and heart-pulsing part
of the whole experience is the interview. The interview
is an incredibly weird adventure. Around Swarthmore
we conduct ourselves with a good deal of humility,
since our culture frowns at self-aggrandizement. Yet
this Swarthmore virtue will destroy the aspiring job
seeker in the interview. It's
awkward to talk about why

choice, particularly coming from
our liberal arts background.
Many of us picked this school precisely because we didn't know what we wanted to be.
It's easy to hide from the impending decision of what
we want to do with the rest of our lives behind the comfortable facade of Swarthmore, where our largest inner
debates concern the paper we're going to be up all night
writing or who we hooked up with last week.
As for me, I've decided to go through the e-recruiting job search ordeal. For those readers who have not
had the joy of experiencing this, it is quite possibly the
largest pain in the butt imaginable. Because jobs are
unusually scarce this year, many of us who hope to go
along this track have cast our job searches as widely as
possible. That means every night we check e-recruiting.com, alter our resumes and cover letters accordingly, and wait for the interviews. There is no apparent
pattern to who gets interviews and who doesn't. I've
gotten interviews over people who were superior to
me, while others have gotten interviews over me at
jobs I was really interested in. From an existential
standpoint it's actually quite funny. Companies are
deciding the future course of our lives by looking at 50
trumped up resumes for 30 seconds each.
It's tough to tell if we have an advantage over other
schools in this process. While we don't get very many
companies on campus, on the other hand the ones we
do get are highly likely to interview any given person,
unlike Penn where they get 8 billion resumes dropped
for 3 positions. And while our business alumni are relatively weaker than in other fields, the "let's save the

of knowing next to nothing
about finance (to which I pleaded guilty as charged), been told that I had to pass the
airport test (whereby the interviewer must feel that
she can tolerate your presence during a three-hourairport layover), only to have the interview end early, presumably because the interviewer was sick of talking
with me (I have not yet heard back from this job).
My favorite interview so far was this past week. I
walked into a job I had no idea about, and two young
women were waiting for me. We greeted each other
with a firm handshake (always a firm handshake
no
deadfish allowed), and they asked me why I chose my
majors. I gave them the stock answer, and they look at
each other and one said, "I think he'd like that." I nodded confidently like you're supposed to do in interviews. The other woman added, "Working for him is
the most amazing yet perplexing experience. It's
always a rush with him around."
"Is that so?" I asked.
Her eyes shined with wonder. "When he's in, everything revolves around him. We all work at his direction
and pace. And he has such a social conscience. I'm
working on a phonics book for inner city children,
while earlier today I sold hundreds of millions of dollars of a telecom company to Goldman Sachs."
Fifteen minutes later I found out who "he" was
but I am still uncertain on whether or not I was applying to a cult or not. At the end I was told I'll find out in
a couple weeks whether I get to meet "him" or not. I'm
not exactly holding my breath.

Lunch with Uncle Dick
At noon on Tuesday, I opened my mail, scrubbed my
hands with soap and water like the postmaster general
told me to, popped a couple of Cipros and headed down
to the ville to have lunch with Dick Cheney. It’s a new
world these days, you know?
As I approached Occasionally Yours, a man in a

trench coat with wires coming out of his ears stopped
me. “Mr. Korobkin?” he asked, looking at me with a sly
smirk. “Your breakfast with the vice president has
been moved to an undisclosed location.”
I tried to object.
“But I have this Ville Discount Card,” I said, waving
it in the air. “I get a free lemonade with every meal.”
The Secret Service agent shook his head slowly.
“That’s pathetic, sir,” he said. “Follow me, please.”
The undisclosed location they had chosen was a little Afghan restaurant in Philadelphia. The vice president was already there, red in the face and fuming at
the limited menu. “As long as my location is undisclosed, why the hell am I eating here?” he shouted, to
no one in particular, as I walked in.
“Uncle Dick,” I said, sitting down across from him,
“I’m going crazy here. I’m having nightmares about
catching anthrax while stuffing mailboxes and airplanes flying into Parrish. Yesterday I took my friend to
the emergency room because she sneezed. Last week I
reported two political science professors to the FBI for
suspicious behavior. And I think Osama bin Laden is
laundering money through the Franklin Mint Federal
Credit Union.”
“Look son, you’ve got to relax.” Uncle Dick paused
to swallow a handful of pills. A couple of them looked
like the Cipro I had at home. “The federal government
is doing everything in its power to keep you safe. This
is the United States of America.”
“I don’t know,” I said. “I feel like the special interests are too involved. You guys didn’t want to break
Bayer’s Cipro patent, even though Canada did. The economic stimulus package was just a large chunk of corporate welfare, repealing a business tax retroactive to
1986.”
The V.P. shook his head adamantly. “We are protecting the homeland.”
“The what? Look, Uncle Dick, that guy Tom Ridge
was a pretty good governor and all, but he doesn’tknow
weapons-grade anthrax from Osama bin Laden’s athlete’s foot medication. You guys fudged the truth on the
Tom Daschle letter.
“Now you’re telling us there’s going to be another
terrorist attack, but you won’t tell us when, where or
what form it will take. And look at this quote from
John Ashcroft...” I pulled the New York Times out of
my bag.

‘We think this gives people a basis for continuing
to live their lives the way they would otherwise live
them, with this elevated sense of alertness or vigilance.’ Uncle Dick, this gives me a basis to move to
Sweden.”
“Son, I think you’re overreacting.”
“Well I don’t think so! Have you seen these new
opinion polls?” I pulled out the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll, conducted last weekend. “A
majority of Americans think that there will be another
terrorist attack in the United States within the next few
months and that the government has not done enough
to prepare for a biological attack.
“Almost 50 percent think the government is not
telling the public everything they need to know about
anthrax. These numbers are all up from a few weeks
ago. Ashcroft said we should not succumb to a ‘false
sense of indifference.’
“But people are not indifferent. They’re just scared.”
“Now look here,” replied Uncle Dick, pointing to the
last question on the poll. “People are indifferent. It says
here, on question number 86, that 42 percent of
Americans don’t care who wins the World Series. So
the United States is responding. I’ve sent W. to the
Yankees game tonight.
The homeland has never been stronger.”

Ben-Ami proposal a ray of hope for Mideast
BY BEN SCHWEIGERT
There has been almost no good news
out of the Middle East since I returned
from the West Bank in January. I’m to
the point now where I dread opening the
paper in the morning, knowing that the
only thing that will face me are the
reports of new casualties. The muchheralded peace process has been shown
to be 90 percent hot air and manipulation, nine percent hope and enthusiasm
and one percent actual progress. The
violence in the Palestinian territories
now is worse than it has ever been.
Nearly all trust between the parties has
been lost. There is currently not even an
agreement on a framework from which
to begin new negotiations.
Then I heard about the new proposal
by former Israeli foreign minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami, and I wanted to shout
for joy. No one, of course, will listen to
Ben-Ami right now. His ideas are anathema to the right-wing government of
Ariel Sharon, a man found culpable by
an Israeli court for the massacre of thousands of Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon, and banned from commanding military forces (although not from
being Prime Minister). Nor does BenAmi’s plan represent a proposed bargaining position. Rather, it presents a
formula for negotiations. Nonetheless, it
is the best idea that anyone has had for
some time, and it should immediately
become the official American position
on the conflict.
The proposal is this: Israel will make
a unilateral withdrawal, and turn the
territory withdrawn from over to an
international force led by the United
States, which will govern the territory,
helping
to protect Israel from
Palestinian militants while at the same
time freeing Palestinians from Israeli
occupation. Final status talks can then
begin without the current conditions of
violence. Importantly, this proposal has
parallels on the Palestinian side. They
have long called for an international
force to be sent to the West Bank and the
Gaza strip to protect them against
Israeli human rights abuses. Their proposal is not as far-reaching as BenAmi’s, but in many ways the two plans
call for similar steps.

However, this would be a risky mission for any international force to carry
out. It would be important that it be
done in such a way as to ensure cooper-

ation from the civilian populations of
both sides and some measure of internal
stability in the territories. There are
several conditions that would increase
the likelihood of such a mission’s success, bearing the model of currentlyoccupied Kosovo in mind.
First, the Israeli withdrawal must be
substantial and from a contiguous territory, not from several isolated reservations as previous withdrawals have
been. The territory handed over should
have cultural, economic and political
viability as a self-governed entity for the
duration of final-status negotiations.
Israeli settlers in the evacuated area
should be given the option of immediate
resettlement in Israel or the protection
of the international force.
Second, The international force must
be U.S.-led, to appease the Israelis, but
composed mostly of forces from other
nations, primarily Europeans, but with
symbolic contingents from Muslim
states and Russia to assuage Palestinian
fears of the United States as Israel’s ally

and bankroller.
Third, the international force should
retain security control and create measures, voluntary where possible, to disarm the Palestinian and Israeli militias
in the territory. At the same time, however, it should transfer civilian control
to an elected body of the residents of the
territory,

including any remaining

Israeli settlers.
Finally, there must be a commitment
to resolve final status issues as quickly
as possible. This can most effectively he
done by using past agreements as the
starting point for new ones, even if certain areas need to be reevaluated.
These are the conditions necessary
for restoring calm in the Palestinian territories under such a proposal. And
calm, although it is not a solution, is not
to be undervalued. The two parties were
close to reaching an agreement by the
time that the final status talks finally
collapsed at Taba, and it was probably
only the fury of the moment that prevented the resolution of the remaining
issues. If the negotiations are picked up
where they left off, but without the background of active violence, then a final
status agreement could be achieved.

Coming out week incident was not newsworthy
Dear Editor:
The bottom line: the “Chalkings spur ‘homophobic harassment’ (Oct. 25) story featured in last week’s Phoenix should
never have been printed. I realize that not everyone has had
the experience of mulling over last-minute decisions about
whether a story is ethical or not, so here’s a brief summary of
why you should never publish people’s names in a story
about homophobia on a campus of only a little over a thousand students.
“We’re gonna come over and kick his mothefucking ass!
We’r gonna beat his fucking head in and throw him out a
fucking window!”
The source, of course, is the Daily Jolt, which the editorial board of The Phoenix so quaintly described as the “bathroom stall” of Swarthmore, populated by rumormongers, that
manages to do great harm to people.
Rather like The Phoenix itself, apparently. By presenting
a one-sided story about actions that the article all but outright labels as homophobic, in the news section of all places,
The Phoenix abused its official position as the campus newspaper. Yes, the Daily Jolt may be the source of plenty of
obnoxious rumor mongering, but it’s taken as just that: individual comments by individual students. But according to
The Phoenix’s own policy statement, since the article was not
in the opinions section, it represents the view of the paper.
”

Never mind bias, or the concept that maybe two people
yelling at each other isn’t really newsworthy. The Phoenix
tried to make this the statement story about homophobia at
Swarthmore, despite the fact that the person making the comments repeatedly denied that they were intended to be antihomosexual. In reality, the story runs: two people got in a
shouting match, one of them got angry and said things that
weren’t all that well thought out. We’ve all done it, but luckily for us, it never got reprinted in the newspaper and we didn’t get painted with a bullseye.
I’m not defending the comments of any of the students
involved, and we all pretty much agree that homophobia isn’t
something we want to see. What I do object to is unbalanced
stories that get labeled as news, despite the fact that they contain out-of-context statements and pit two accounts against
one. And I object to muckraking on the part of The Phoenix.
SQU is an organization that runs closed meetings so that
people can feel safe talking about their homosexuality.
Nobody publishes a list of homosexuals in the newspaper. But
when The Phoenix’s target asked if this story really had to be
written, the reporter responded that it was “just too impor
tant not to write.” And so The Phoenix provided the community with a target that could be labeled a homophobe and
blasted as such. Never mind about doing the right thing.

The tragedy brought the college community together, uniting it around grief. In the days
that followed, students leaned on each other for support and jammed into classrooms to hear
professors evaluate the emerging changed world. The campus was a mixture of tears, hushed
speculation and indignation, but above all it was united.
For Bill Carter ’47, that tragedy was the bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, not this
September’s terrorist attacks. Bui for Carter, the two events are eerily similar. Much in the
way that the September attacks have altered the lives of today’s students, the bombing of Pearl
Harbor abruptly punctured his college world of books and theory.
In the years that followed Pearl Harbor, nearly all of Swarthmore’s male students and several of its faculty left to serve in the war in some capacity, while the female students anchored
the vulnerable and changing campus. The dining hall operated on rations, the curriculum and
calendar were revamped to fuel the war effort and the college became a training ground for
Naval forces. Though Swarthmore ostensibly returned to normalcy at the end of 1945, the war
left its mark on the college. Aspects of the college’s academic and social life were never again
the same. Back issues of The Phoenix and alumni interviews provided insight into this time at
the college, and one thing is sure: the Swarthmore graduates who emerged from the war the
men who fought in Germany or worked as conscientious objectors, the women who treated
wounds and altered their lives to serve the war effort
were not the same as the young students who went into it.
Between the beginning of freshman year and graduation day, Carter grappled with the
morality of taking others’ lives in the name of justice. He arrived on a new continent to fight
an enemy he had never seen. And he came within inches of losing his life.

The war effort at home

By January of 1942, the college was gearing up for an extended war. Men trickled, and then
flowed, out of the college as the draft became more and more inescapable. Although draft deferment for students did not end until 1944, by early 1943 the student body was almost entirely
female. One-fourth of the faculty left to assist with government research or to fight, while the
college scrambled to hire replacements.
A summer semester was scheduled with the aim of graduating students more quickly so

that they could assist with the war effort. Most students attended the optional summer sessions, which lasted throughout the war.
“There was this tremendous sense of instability
students coming and going, men being
there for part of the time and being called off,” said Mary Ellen Chijioke ’67, former curator of
the Friends Historical Library.
A changed academic program added to the instability. Seeking to involve women in the war
effort, the college added a war minor and a foreign service major. The new areas of study
brought with them the addition of ten to 15 new courses, and women were encouraged to pursue motor mechanics and first aid as extracurricular activities.
Meanwhile, other academic departments suffered from the loss of students, and extinction
looked imminent for several of them. With this in mind, in July of 1943 the college welcomed
the addition of a Navy program that eventually brought in 467 men for training, nearly doubling the student body. Swarthmore was selected as a training site largely because of its strong

Robert Hayden ’47, one of the few remaining male students at the time, signed on to the
Navy program. Parts of the campus quickly took on new meaning for him.
“You had to be up every morning at five, and they’d take you up by the football field and
run you around the track for quite a while. Then you’d have to swim,” he said. Swimming, he
added, meant being in the water with his feet tied together while trying to hold a rifle out above

Wharton, where most lived, and march past Parrish
on their way to the field by the water tower.
In the fall of 1943, the seamen were joined by a group
of about 50 Chinese officers who lived and trained with
the naval units while attending English classes.
In ways big and small, Swarthmore students made
sacrifices. As staff became scarce, students cleaned
their own rooms, and female student workers replaced
waiters in the dining hall. Butter and meat were scarce,
and there were no bananas. During the summer session
of 1942, early-evening blackouts became routine, and
quiet nights were sometimes punctuated by the blaring
sirens of air raid drills.
Most students accepted the sacrifices cheerfully, and
some took the initiative to contribute in other ways.
Students crowded blood drives and bought war stamps.
A Phoenix editorial published on March 10, 1942 even
suggested that students forego corsages at dances. "If
the money spent by the men of the College for flowers
could be contributed toward the war effort," it read, "it
would be a small beginning for a Defense Fund."
The war "made everybody grow up very quickly,"
Nancy Hayden said.
The most wide-reaching change, perhaps, was monetary: with the addition of the summer session, the college had to stretch a budget normally allotted for two
semesters into three, according to the April 21,1942 edi-

tion of The Phoenix.
But for Nancy Hayden, the sacrifices didn't matter.
"We worked hard, but everybody had a good time," she

said. "It brought everybody closer together."
Until some of themleft, that is. After three semesters
at Swarthmore, and eight more months of training at
other universities, Robert Hayden was sent to China.
He was stationed on the coast, where he helped sink

Japanese ships.

Another Phoenix editorial, published on March 2,
1943, expressed the weight shouldered by many students. "We are all in college now on 'borrowed time,'
the editors wrote.

Bill Carter left Swarthmore in what would have been
his junior year to join the army. It was 1942, and he beat
the draft. He was sent to Louisiana State University for
training. During basic training, the gravity of what he
was preparing to do hit him. "Sitting and learning how
to handle a gun just boggled my mind," he said. "It was
a terrible thing to have to study."
His first night on the field in Belgium, he spread his
raincoat on the ground and tried to sleep while "buzz
early self-guided missiles
bombs"
rattled and
hissed headed from Germany to the United Kingdom.
He woke in a pool of water. This was war.
He recounted a December, 1944 battle: "The first day
we learned that one of our men had been killed the
night before. The case was doubly pathetic because the
shot had been fired by one of our men ... Al held the guy
in his arms for several hours before the doctor arrived.
The fellow died a few minutes before the doc's arrival...
Imagine having to care for a dying man in the inky
blackness on the cold snow." Al Cooper was a friend
from a neighboring platoon.
Fighting a war is usually not among the things
Swarthmore prepares a student to do. Indeed, the college
was not committed to assisting with the military effort
before Pearl Harbor. Before ending his term as college
president in 1940, Frank Aydelotte proposed to the Board
of Managers that the college refrain from direct support
of the war many saw U.S. involvement as inevitable
and instead focus its efforts on peaceby that point
promoting activities such as training conscientious

objectors, according to Chijioke.
After Pearl Harbor, however, the board rapidly
signed on to the war effort. Though it strayed from a
Quaker inspired pacifism, the college continued to be a
pocket of pacifist activity, naval training and all. Ten
percent of the men who graduated in 1942 were conscientious objectors, Isabel Logan Lyon '42 wrote in

"Swarthmore Remembered."
Members of the community were highly involved in
NOVEMBER X 2001

the effort to protect refugees fleeing persecution. By the
end of 1944, the vice-director of the Intergovernmental
Committee on Refugees was a former Swarthmore professor, and the American representative to the same
body was a former dean.
The college apparently started a fund to finance
scholarships for Jewish refugee students, according to
the Nov. 22,1938 edition of The Phoenix, though Carter
and others interviewed said they did not remember
meeting any refugee students during their years at
Swarthmore. Carter intimated that the college's treatment of Jewish students was discriminatory, and he
wished that there had been more awareness about the
Holocaust within the institution.
In conjunction with the American Friends Service
Committee, the college helped to rescue JapaneseAmerican students from internment camps. Exactly
how many is unclear.
Talk of creating a peaceful world abounded. Few,
however, questioned the war itself. And for some of
those inclined to peace, certain horrors could justify
fighting. Carter said that if he had been fully aware of
the Holocaust, he might have felt differently about handling a gun. "It was not at the forefront of my mind. It
was not what I was thinking about when I became a
pacifist," he said.

Battle scars
Carter was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge

in December of 1944.
Somewhere in Germany, Carter was surrounding
the United States army headquarters with tin cans filled
with pebbles. The cans were meant to catch shrapnel
and warn the troops of an attack. The shrapnel caught,
but it missed the cans. It entered Carter's left arm, zipping by muscle and bone, and continued out the other
side, grazing his back along the way.
The battle was raging, but some things mattered
more than the fight. Cooper rushed over and unwrapped
the bandage that was on Carter's wound and applied a
new one "not because it was necessary, butbecause he
wanted to do something," Carter recalled. After getting
wounded, Carter was transferred to a convalescent hospital. Despite his condition, getting out of the trenches
and into the hospital delighted him.
His arm healed, and when the war finally ended in
1945, Carter returned to Swarthmore. The college, he
said, "seemed like a very strange world. There was a
marked difference between the war veterans and the
college kids."
Many of the veterans were ready to begin a family
and get on with their lives. Robert Hayden returned
from China, and he and Nancy married and moved into
Roberts, which was designated as housing for married
couples. It may have been odd for soldiers and conscientious objectors to go back to a college they had left
years before and find it populated with younger, more
innocent faces, but for many the return was joyous.
"It was just so nice to go back and be free," Robert
Hayden said. "Everybody was delighted to get home and
start their lives again."
For the Haydens and Carter, the return was haunted
by memories. Not everyone came home. "The best baseball player we had was killed in Germany. There were a
lot of people that didn't come back," he added.

Theatre," a day-long symposium presented by the
and Theatre Studies. The symposium, beginning at 10 a.m. on Saturday, will consist of
a dance historian's panel, a studio performance of a
reconstruction of a 1946 Polish dance and a dance
critic's roundtable. It will take place in the Cinema in
LPAC.
Sharon Friedler, professor of dance and director of
the Dance Program, urges all students to attend
either of the performances as well as the symposium.
"Anyone with even a tangential interest in dance
should come," she said. Friedler hopes that this weekend's events will make more students aware of the
real-world applications of dance. "Say you're a
Political Science major," she said, "you might ask a
question, or hear an answer, which might shape a
paper that you're going to write."
The performances promise to be very exciting
dance events. "I believe that our audiences will find
the degree of physicality in this movement compelling," Friedler said. Also, "the commentary on
human relationships [in the piece] is provocative,
and worthy of considerable thought."
Luminski and his company first came to
Swarthmore in the spring of 1999 to teach and perform. In the spring of 2000, Jennifer Pike 'O2 was the
first student to take advantage of the program.
Students who go to Poland to study dance take dance
technique, composition and repertory classes with
members of the company. In addition, they study
intensive Polish. Students travel around the country
with the company as they tour, perform and teach,
and the culmination of the program is a paper based
on their experience.
However, dance is not the only option available to
students who wish to study in Poland. Bytom, where
the company is based, is a two-hour train ride from
Krakow and the Jagiellonian University, where the
Polish-language classes are held. There and at the
Politechnika, students can take courses in engineering and environmental studies. Bytom and Krakow's
dependence on the coal-mining industry makes the
area particularly interesting for these disciplines.
Programs in Dance

The region is plagued by environmental degradation

from the mining ofcoal and its use as a primary energy source. In the spring of 2001, five Swarthmore students participated in the program, three of whom concentrated on dance, and two of whom split their time
between dancing and environmental studies.
This semester, Luminski is a Eugene M. Lang
Visiting Professor of Social Change. This position,
endowed in 1981 by Eugene M. Lang '3B, "brings to
Swarthmore College for a period of one semester to
three years an outstanding social scientist or other
suitably qualified person who has achieved prominence and special recognition in the area of social
change," according to the Swarthmore College Web
site. Luminski teaches Modern Dance 111, a technique
class, twice a week and a three-hour repertory class
once a week. The repertory class will perform a new
work at the student dance performance in December.
Luminski, director and choreographer for the
company, founded SDT in 1991 in the economicallydepressed region of Silesia. The first professional contemporary dance company in Poland, SDT has struggled over the years to maintain government funding
and community support in a country which is still
recovering from the effects of living under a communist regime. Over the last 13 years, Poland has undergone many changes related to the conversion from
communism to a free-market economy. During that
time, Luminski has worked with his company to
make contemporary dance relevant to a rapidly modernizing

Poland.

Both the performances and the symposium are
free and open to the public; no advance reservations
are necessary.

This week I'm a rockstar
(and why you should be, too)
BY JONAH GOLD
I submit that we all wanted to be rock
stars at some point or another.
Understand, this is regardless of whether
we could sing a note, play an instrument
or strut about a stage in spandex pants
without tripping over ourselves. My first
band happened in first grade. I played
the "electric guitar," though I didn't quite
know what one was. Our "singer" claimed
she had written a bunch of songs, which
were actually Debbie Gibson songs, and
we were going to be number one in

America. We weren't. We never played a
note. Slightly more complicated versions
of this same story comprised much of my
middle and high school years, only with
real instruments.
But that's all in the past now. Dreams

of stardom have faded to dust, and we're
apparently all so damn jaded, counting
our GPA's and just itching to get into
business school. Whine whine whine, cry
like a little baby about our lost youths,
etc. So I am as shocked as the next person who cares when I announce that, all
of a sudden, it appears Swarthmore may
be on the verge of having an actual, honest-to-god college music scene. Who
knew?

scenes, pretty much by definition, involve
sitting around in someone's basement
(or a college concert venue) in an audience consisting mostly of friends of the
band, watching a bunch of people who
are friends with each other do the whole
rock star thing. If I were a more cynical
boy, i'd call it "masturbatory," or something along those lines (writing, on the
other hand, is never self-indulgent). And

yes, sometimes it is indeed hardcore
wankage. But as cliched as it is, the rock
star thing still works, even when you
know everyone on the stage and twothirds of the people in the room.
Sometimes, it even makes it better.
Because hey, even if he's dating your
roommate, the guy with the guitar
onstage is still, for this fleeting moment,
a rock star, which is basically the same
thing as being a superhero. And if you
know a superhero, who's to say you can't
be one yourself?
I feel like the guy who spends ten
minutes telling you how great his walk in
the park was without mentioning the girl
he met while he was there, so I should
probably bring this up
it seems I might
be in a band too. We might never get off
the ground, and I don't want to jinx anything, so I'm going to shut up about it
...

The rock star thing still works, even when you know

There was a show last Sunday night
at the confusingly named Olde Club,
spotlighting Swat talent. This happens
every year, I'm pretty sure. Last year at
least, though, if memory serves, there
was all of one or two bands that weren't
formed specifically to play a five-or-sixsong cover set for one night. This year,
every group and performer was the real
deal, either an established act or, better
yet, the debut of a new act, which hopefully will play many more gigs on-campus
yet. Some of them (gasp!) even played
originals. This, surely, is a good sign.
The other good sign is that these
bands are actually decent. I'm not
reviewing the concert per se, mostly out
of fear of kissing ass or being overly cynical as I try to avoid kissing ass. But I will
say this: when there finally were bands
at my high school, they sucked.
Swarthmore's bands, projects, and performers decidedly do not suck. In fact, it
can be safely said that all performers
involved in the show were pretty damn
good. Not Ozzy yet, but good stuff. There
is plenty of raw talent here in our luscious little arboretum, and it's not all
absorbed and channeled to feed the
fires of academia by McCabe's giant,
secret experimental brain magnets.
I don't know why all this makes me
happy, but it does. Watching good live
music is already so much fun it's almost
beside the point to analyze it. D.I.Y.

now, except this simple fact, which was
probably the misdirected inspiration for
this whole screed: playing very loud

music is real fun.
You should do it. Even if it's in your
own basement or the equivalent, which it
usually is. If you can't play loud music,
sing it, or rap it, or spoken-word it. Or
whack a tambourine. Or program your
Mac to beep rhythmically. Or if learning
how to do anything that requires effort is
too much for you to handle, feel
absolutely free, just thrash around and
play air guitar and snarl like Freddie
Mercury to your heart's content. Anyone
can do that, and that's the appeal.
So rock on, Swarthies. Indie on, punk
on, industrial on, hip-hop on, doo-wopon
for all I care. Be good if you're feeling up
to it, but feel free to suck. Just make
sure you're loud, or if you're not into
being loud, that you're having fun not
being loud. Think about and discuss how
much more talent you have than Sting.
Brainstorm dorky band names and then
reject them ("Hey! Let's call ourselves
Proof by Infinite Descent!"). Come up
with titles for never-to-be-released greatest-hits compilations. Play Michael
Jackson songs, except replace key words
in the chorus with the names of British
monarchs. The principle, as is often the
case, is this: Whatever. You're a rock
star. You can have all the brown M &
M's.

MCCABE MOVIES
Our reviewer on the top rentals in McCabe
BY ESTER

BLOOM

Perhaps alarmed by the recent negativity of my movie reviews, my editors devised
a new idea this week. I would go to McCabe, obtain a list of the top-rented movies
there and write capsule reviews. The idea behind this bit of ingenuity was to save me
from the torment of sitting through another two hours of teeth gnashing while giving
you, my readers, something refreshing and different.
So off I trotted to McCabe and without much trouble I
obtained the list of the top 40 movies rented from McCabe
this year. It's not exactly what I expected: the top-ranked
film, for instance, is "Vertigo" (1958), a glorious technicolor Hitchcock piece that was retouched and rereleased a
couple years ago. It features Jimmy Stewart and Kim
Novak in very dated clothing, old-school special effects
and a bizarre premise that was shocking and frightening
when it first came out. Like a number of Hitchcock's films
("Psycho," "The Birds"), it's lost some flavor over time,
but it's still good for a headache.
The sudden interest in vintage Hitchcock is a question
I left to puzzle over later and moved on to the second film.

are responsible for what I consider some of
the most innovative modern movies ("Barton
Fink," "Farg," and "Hudsucker Proxy," just to
name my favorites). Jeff Bridges plays a Los
Angeles slacker called "The Dude" who is
dragged into a complicated kidnapping/ransom plot because he shares the surname
Lebowski with a much richer man. Everyone
seems to have more fun in Coen brothers
movies: John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve
Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour
Hoffman take turns stealing scenes and reciting deadpan dialogue that sticks in your head
for weeks. The CAs from my freshman year
can testify to that: they had "Calmer than you
are" printed on their shirts.
Speaking of quotable movies, I was gratified to see that "The Princess Bride" (1987)
made number three. It seems especially
appropriate given the current situation
George W. could use Vizzini's advice, "Never
get involved in a land war in Asia." It's anothCourtesy MGM Entertainment
er movie of great performances from funny
"Never get involved in a land war in folks with even funnier put-on accents. Robin
Asia": McCabe's third most rented
Wright-Penn plays the title character,
movie, "The Princess Bride."
Buttercup, whose romance with her farm boy
Wesley, Carey Elwes, is put on hold when
pirates kill him. But as she and the audience learn later, "Death cannot stop true
love. It can only delay it for a while." It's perfect diverting fantasy and if you ever
get your hands on the book, I guarantee it's just as
good.

One of the movies from this list that I hadn't
although I
seen that is also based on a book
can't promise that this one's as good
is "Kama
Sutra: A Tale of Love" (1996). If I had had more
time this weekend, I would have rented it, particularly since it seems like I'm one of only six
Swatties who haven't yet had the pleasure.
If you're looking for nudity, although I can't
say it qualifies as erotic, there's also Peter
Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &
Her Lover" (1989). Like all of Greenaway's work
that I'm familiar with, it takes itself and moviemaking extremely seriously. Even by his standards, it is an intense experience. You have to
have an open mind and a strong stomach to
attempt it, and I suggest you do not try late at

night.

If you're uninterested in those precautionary
measures and you just want to be entertained,
there are other wonderful movies on the list.
"When Harry Met Sally," the most intelligent
romantic comedy of the 1980s and probably ever,
is up there at number eight, followed by "Annie
Hall," which is no slouch either, at number nine.
If you like your romances and your comedies separate, there's "Casablanca" on one hand and
"Monty Pythons' Life of Brian" and "Monty
Python and the Holy Grail" on the other. I wonder
if the Bottom 40 list will be so appealing.

Stars of The Lid The Tired Sounds of Stars
of the Lid (kranky)
If someone were to compose a soundtrack for a
two hour documentary on "A Day In The Life of A
Human Fetus," it would be the Stars of The Lid. You
won't find catchy melodies, bubble-gum chord progressions, suffocating disco beats or trite song lyrics
on this two-disc collection ofinstrumental suites; just long, sustained synth textures, with subtle chord and instrument
changes every once in a while. Brian
Mcßride and Adam Whiltzie, the musicians behind Stars of The Lid, keep it
real the analogue way with synth
strings, horns, piano and field recordings, which they slowly sprinkle in with
the synth pads throughout the record.
Instead of focusing on rhythm and
melody, the listener finds interest in the
duration and intensity of each chord's
oscillations. (I'm certain music historians will thoroughly study this years
from now). Though tracks are often difficult to distinguish from one another,
SoL find unique titles for each piece,
including,
"Requiem for Dying Mothers,"
"Gasfarming" and "Ballad of Distances." It's not
often that you find a group that fits into both the
neo-psychedelia and contemporary classical sections of a record store, so don't miss out. This is an
outstanding recording, far, far ahead of its time. But
keep in mind that it may get a little boring if you're
awake (and not on mushrooms). JOEL BLECHER

Tindersticks, "Can Our Love..." (Beggars Banquet)
Over the past ten years, Tindersticks have cemented a
rabidly supportive fan base and a reputation as princes of
somber, atmospheric melancholy. Their sound, perhaps
best encapsulated on their self-titled second release
(Universal, 1995), has always veered towards the orchestral, featuring lavish string arrangements and the impossibly smooth, passionate bass-baritone of singer Stuart
Staples. Frankly, though, despite an abundance of passion,
their albums often seem somewhat stilted: too clinical, too
overbearing, with too much operatic pomp to really work
as rock records.
With "Can Our Love...", the group's first outing on
Beggars Banquet, things have become decidedly looser. In
fact, it seems strange that this didn't happen before. If lush

music, they are equally at home in the world of R&B. It
seems that the 'sticks have decided to make that connection
explicit, and the results are undeniable. The album retains
the essential elements of their music but ensconces them in
a setting that feels far more natural, reminiscent of the stirring 'seventies soul of Curtis Mayfield, Harold Melvin, and
perhaps another Staples. The slyly grooving "People Keep
Coming Around," with its sinuous bassline and quietly
infectious chorus.stands out in particular, but the whole
album, though short, is solid and evocative.

Jonathan Richman, "Her Mystery Not Of High Heels
and Eye Shadow" (Vapor 2001)
ONE: LAUGHABLY BAD
After thirty years as a musical marginal, one of the
countless offbeat characters criscrossing the country and
playing to any available audience, Jonathan Richman has
become part of the cultural landscape. There he was on
PBS' "History of Rock'n'Roll" series, being hailed as the Godfather of Punk. There he
was on the front page of "The New York Times" Arts section last weekend, as part of a
story on jazz clubs staying open in the face of tragedy. There he was,
crooning and anticking with longtime drummer/sidekick Tommy

Larkins, in "There's Something About Mary," the sort of high profile gig
that has dogged him ever since, for better or worse. Heck, he even made
it into Spike a few years ago, where his sing-a-long paean to late-night
New England driving was reckoned the 53rd Best Thing of the
Millennium.
Through it all, despite progressing from the tough-guy posturing of
the indispensable debut "Modern Lovers" to the carefree exuberance of
albums like 1993's "Having a Party," Jonathan has lost none of his charm.
Part of it is a simplicity that makes even young squirts like me nostalgic
for the 19505, and makes the rich, chunky guitar of tunes like "Me and
Her Got A Good Thing Goin' Baby" the musical equivalent of comfort
food. Part of it is a childlike innocence that paradoxically makes the
hard-earned sage advice of "Couples Must Fight" and "I Took A Chance
on Her" that much more credible. Mostly it's just a sense of fun that's
inescapable in live performance and shines through as strongly as ever
on his unwieldily titled twentieth release. Backed by nothing more than
bouyant acoustic strumming, Larkins' spirited drumming, and the occasional piano or violin, Richman holds forth on love, friendship, and his
favorite cities (the brilliant "Give Paris One More Chance,") occasionally in Spanish (the bouncy "Yo Tengo una Novia.") And when he sings, you've just got to

"The record is so over the top
mechanically," remarked bassist Matt
Werth about this album, "it's overboard
at times." It's polite that he's so genuinely modest, but let's face it: its overboard
nature is its strongest point. Aspera's
cluttered circus-rock sound, difficult to
capture on tape, takes the sounds we are
comfortable with and pushes them into a
strange and uneasy "galaxy of goodness," (as Werth has so oddly labeled it).
Perhaps it's the creepy keyboard they
made themselves, or the spooky flavor of
lead singer Drew Mills' voice, but from
the moment the album begins we're

somehow inverted. Since this colorful
fairy-tale flavor is unrelent-

and dreamy

ing throughout the album, it can some-

times be difficult to breathe. I suspect,
however, that this is their strategy all
along
by rigorously withholding anything that remotely resembles reality,
they effectively do what good artists

should do: take us to a new place, in dif-

ferent time, in a different body, and leave
us to explore. JOEL BLECHER

The Strokes, "Is This It" (RCA 2001)
There's not much I can say about the Strokes that hasn't been said. Their press
kit came with a thick packet of xeroxed review clippings, all of which said, essentially, "the Strokes have been getting a lot of hype." So much hype that it's hard
to approach them, unless of course you were there before it all started. Which,
actually, I was. I saw the hot-shit New York five-piece open for Guided by Voices
last winter, when their median age was a shy 2L Vocalist Julian Casablancas (who
has, it's been pointed out, the ultimate rock star name) staggered drunkenly about
the stage, complained about his day job, broke a microphone, while the rest of the
group smirked disinterestedly or bobbed along to the beat. There's no denying
they've got the look: black suits, leather jackets, scruffy mod haircuts, straight out
of late-sixties London, or maybe late seventies New York.
And the music? Driving, direct, dirty, impassioned, inevitable. Terse guitar
riffs, tin-can drumming, bounding bass melodies, clipped vocals, addictive choruses, snotty lyrics, rock and roll. It's nothing we've never heard before, but who
cares? There are at least a couple on the Strokes' debut that aren't the catchiest
things, but then, your air guitar
would start to feel pretty heavy after
36 minutes.

doesn't really achieve the goals," Carolyn
Evans explained during the presentation.
"We also learned that funds may be spent
for better health care and scholarship programs and that higher wages can be earned
by acquiring more skills."
The committeerecommended that the college 'adopt a staff compensation goal that is
comparable to that of faculty: a salary slightly better than the market rate" for any job.
The presentation suggested a collegewide minimum wage of nine dollars per
hour "with opportunities for rapid movement for good performers." It mentioned
the need to "create the infrastructure necessary to make it easier for employees to

identify and prepare for new job opportunities," within the college. To that end, the
presentations advocated an increase in the
amount staff can be reimbursed for training or education outside Swarthmore.
The committee also proposed that the
mandatory retirement contribution for
employees be eliminated and replaced by
an increase in the amount the college contributes to retirement funds.
"This would add the equivalent of one
week's wages to take-home pay," LaMar said.
Other suggestions targeted the college's
benefit system. The committee found that
"we are above average on health care for
singles because of the benefit bank, and
below average on health care for families"
compared with other colleges.

The benefit bank is
available for employees to use for health
care coverage, in addition to the basic
health care provided to individual employees. Those with spouses or families can use
the money in the benefit bank to make additional non-taxable purchases for health
care. They can also take their benefit bank
money as cash that they must pay taxes on.
Because each employee receives the
same amount of money for health care, single people can often take much of their benefit bank allocation as cash, while employees who must purchase family coverage
must pay up to $450 a month out of their own
pockets in addition to the money provided.
"We'd like to decrease the cost gap
between single and family health care costs.

had to be completely prostrate at all times, never
on one side for more than two hours.
"That could get annoying," Jess said. "But, after
a while, you get used to it, and it becomes part of
daily life." On the up side, he said, everyone he
knew signed his cast, he still had the ability to play
chess and read books, and, one day, a pile of cards
was delivered. The messages, all addressed to Jess,
were written in French, and had been sent by his
beginning French class to his home.
"Thatmade me feel really good," he said. The cards
madethe uncomfortable time pass quickly. Still, there
were some parts he does not remember fondly.
"Don't ask me about going to the bathroom in a
body cast," he said. "It's weird."
Teaching Jess
Outside of French, Jess's education is a diverse
blend of home schooling and involvement in com-

His schedule is about as full as any Swarthmore
student, maybe more so. Take Monday, for example.
At 9:30 a.m., Jess starts French, which lasts
until 10:20. He walks home, and, from 11 to 12, he is
in Philadelphia, for physical therapy at the
Children's Hospital. When he gets home, it's
instruction from his mother in different subjects,
most of which he takes at a high school level. After
dinner, he has homework from until nine or so,
studying in French or math or spelling or social
studies. His favorite subject is medieval history.
"Quite definitely," he said. "I like the knights
and the medieval system, the Crusades and all the
battles and stuff, and just a while ago I memorized
all the parts of a knight's plate armor."
Keeping up with him, mother says, can be
exhausting. "I'm tired," she said, with a laugh and a
sigh. "It's not hard to teach him, because I think he's
a teacher's dream, but he goes through material
quickly, so I am working hard to make sure I have
the resources here to make the next step." Raising
and teaching him at the same time is a "full-time job.
"He's chomping at the bit, he's restless," his
mother said. "I'm working as hard now as I did
when I was practicing law in D.C."
As for Swarthmore, "thank God we had it,"
Suzanne said. "It's wonderful right now," because
Jess needs not only a challenge but also a safe environment due to his disease and formative age. The
future could hold more courses at Swarthmore for
Jess, probably only one or two a semester, his
mother said. "I think now that he has these limitations, and he's so much younger than the rest of the
class, he's going to feel a lot more marginal than he
has to be," she said when asked about his enrolling
full-time. Waiting until he is 15 or 16 is more likely,
giving him a chance to learn more languages and
develop emotionally as well as intellectually.

importantly,"
"Most
Ikenberry wrote, "this provision
discriminates against the lowand middle-income recipients of
federal student aid, since students whose families can bear
the cost of higher education are
not subject to any comparable
screening mechanism."
There is also concern that the
process depends on the honesty of

the students and that a student
could easily lie on his or her application. To this Talbot said that
although the Swarthmore financial aid office does not "have an
enforcement wing," it completes a
thorough, federally required verification process for students
receiving federal aid. "We spent
about 95 percent of our time
checking on about five percent of
our students' aid," she said.
Despite these complaints,
many Americans support of the
new law, believing that those
who have been convicted of drugrelated offenses should not reap
the benefits offederal tuition aid.

Angela Flood, chief of staff for
the law's author, Rep. Mark
Souder (R-Ind.), was quoted in
the May 21 Inquirer article as
explaining that federally funded
financial aid should be subject to

reasonable restrictions because
it is a privilege, not a right.
"I don't think it's asking too
much of kids to obey the law in
exchange for their financial aid,"
Joon Suk Choi 'O2 said. He added
that students should simply be
prepared to face such consequences as the loss of federal
tuition aid if they choose to
become involved with drugs.
"It's a choice you make," he said.

The committee reommended longevity
awards for good performance records and a different economic index to plan salary increases
and more accurately track market changes.
The recommendations presented were a
result of six months of study by the committee. After soliciting community opinion,
the committee will refine its recommendations and discuss potential plans and timelines for implementation. In late November,
it will present its final recommendations to
the president and Board of Managers.

Garnet runners finish among top five
in conference, move on to Regionals
BY TARA TROUT

On Oct. 27, the Swarthmore men's and
women's cross country teams traveled to
Dickinson College for the Centennial
Conference Championships. The championships were run on a difficult course, but the
Garnet Tide still managed to conquer the
course to finish in the top five. The men's team
earned fifth place overall, while the women's
team raced to a fourth-place finish.
On the men's side, the dynamic duo of Lang
Reynolds 'O5 and James Golden 'O5 came in side
by side, placing eighteenth and nineteenth
respectively. Following closely was Joe Makin
'O3, who placed twenty-fifth overall. Garrett Ash
'O5 also ran well for the Garnet, ending the
course with a twenty-eighth place finish. Rory
Kondrad 'O2 came in thirty-seventh. Don
Nguyen 'O3 was forty-sixth, and following close
behind was Dan Keys 'O5, who placed fifty-third.
"There were positives and negatives on
Saturday. Lang and Golden and Rory and Don,
those guys had great races, they did just what
they had to do. Rory especially, running
through the tendonitis; that was amazing.
well, we didn't have our best
Garrett and I
races," Makin said. "That's tough, especially
since we needed just seven points to get third. It
highlights something that's very true of cross
country, but not so much so of other sports:

there's no forgiveness. We all needed to have
great races to beat Gettysburg, and we didn't.
Still, we get a second shot at all those teams at
Regionals, so we'll see what happens. I'm feeling pretty confident."
The women had some outstanding performances that helped them place high in the conference behind the powerhouse teams of
Dickinson, Haverford and Gettysburg. Placing
highest for the Garnet Harriers was MariaElena Young 'O4, who came in strong with a
ninth-place finish. Young earned the honor of
being named second team All-Conference with
her time of 19:26.00.
Krista Gigone 'O4 also put in an impressive
performance, finishing twenty-first for the

Tide. Njideka Akunyili 'O4 placed twenty-ninth.
Christen Lungren 'O2 placed forty-first after a
difficult race. Loring Pfeiffer 'O2 placed fifty-

third, with Elizabeth Gardner 'O5, who placed
fifty-fourth, and Kate Baker 'O4, who placed
fifty-fifth, following close behind.
The championships marked the end of the
regular season for both teams, and now the MidEast Regional Championships are the next step.
The top seven runners from both the men's and
women's teams will continue to train for the
meet, which is to be held on Nov. 10 at Lehigh

Balancing the demands of athletics
NEW ASSOCIATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
AIMS TO MINIMIZE TENSIONS
BETWEEN ATHLETICS AND ACADEMICS
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

As a child playing street hockey, Adam Hertz could imagine himself capturing the Stanley Cup
with the winning shot. A career in
hockey would prove impossible for
Hertz, but a chance to influence an
institutional sports landscape
would be less elusive.
His opportunity came when
Swarthmore developed a new position: associate athletic director.

Designed to "provide additional
support for leadership within athletics," as Athletic Director Bob
Williams explained it, and formulated in the wake of the athletic
cutbacks and reassessment last
year, the position will allow Hertz
to clarify athletic recruiting strategies, assist in developing longrange facility improvement plans,
be an integral part of hiring deci-

sions and help determine the role
of athletic involvement in admis-

sions proceedings.
The job requires enthusiasm
for, and skill in, both athletics and
learning. At this college, where
academics are highly valued, Hertz

sees his role as minimizing the
tension between academics and an
on-the-field education. "I would
like to see us develop a better line

Emily Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff

Adam Hertz hopes to help define the role of intercollegiate athletics on this campus and to support
athletes as they pursue both athletic and academic interests. The associate athletic director position
was created as a result of the reassesments of the needs of the athletics department after the college decided to cut football last December.

of communication between athlet-

ics and the faculty and staff one
that would eliminate the need for
the student-athlete to have to make

the decision of whether to play or

stay in class," he said. "We need to
better understand the efforts and
frustrations of the faculty, and
they need to better understand

ours."
It is a challenge that is new for
Hertz. Though experienced in both

coaching and athletic administration at Alvernia College and

University (formerly
Beaver College), the new associate
athletic
director
recognizes

Arcadia

as
unusual.
"Swarthmore is unique in that it's
the first institution, and probably
one of only a few in the nation, that
doesn't use athletics as a source of
attracting a student body," Hertz
said. "While there are many
recruited student-athletes on campus, nobody comes to Swat to play
a sport primarily. They come
because they have the chance to
matriculate at the finest liberal
arts college in the country, and
they have an opportunity to continue their athletic careers."
Rather than viewing the deemphasized nature of athletics as
neglectful, Hertz chooses to view
this as one of Swarthmore's greatest strengths. He sees sports and
other, more traditional forms of
academics, as closely tied together.
As an active participant in sports,
and as a recipient of a master's
Swarthmore

degree in education from Temple
in 1995, Hertz understands the
need to combine the two. In fact,
citing his own experience, the new

associate athletic director explains
that the lessons acquired through
athletics can provide an important
education in and of themselves.
"Sports taught me that hard sucmotivates harder work
cess
[and] that there is always a way to
succeed," he said. They have also
taught him "how to best adjust my
strategy for each new challenge."
His new position is one of these
challenges. Because it is so broad
in its duties, the job requires an
ability to relate to anyone and
everyone who has contact with the
...

athletic department. This often
takes the form of appeasing various interests. In addition to bridging the divide between the per-

ceived interests of athletics and
academics, Hertz plays mediator in
a host of other problems.
Chief among these is the role of
coaching at an academically oriented
Division
school.
111
"Coaching is quite a challenge
here," he explained, "because
there hasn't been an understanding of what is necessary to successfully run an intercollegiate
program. Without this understanding, athletes are oftentimes late for
games, or can't make competition
at all because of potential missed
class time. Students here would
oftentimes rather be in class than
on the playing fields. That's
unique!"
By all accounts, Hertz has so far
been successful in addressing
these coaching concerns and in
providing extra support for a
department without a large adminAmy
istrative
component.
Brunner, head women's soccer

coach and intramural director,

said Hertz has been able to lessen
the load on Williams. "Having only

one administrator in an athletics
office is very difficult, particularly
for the person bearing the responsibilities," she said. Hertz has
"come in and really helped allevi-

ate some of the burden

that

[Williams]
carried, and also
allowed for more attention to
details that had gone by the wayside due to lack of manpower and

time."

Rather than taking full credit
for the positive reviews he has garnered since his August appointment, Hertz chooses to attribute
his successes to the open atmosphere cultivated at Swarthmore. "I

came to Swat because President
[Al] Bloom and the Board of
Managers promised a commitment
to the quality of athletics," he says.
"I saw it as a chance to help define
the role of intercollegiate athletics
on this campus. To be able to share
in developing the role of athletics
at any campus, let alone one as
academically competitive as ours,
poses an exciting challenge." It is
certainly a challenge different
from the Stanley Cup dreams of
childhood, but one to which Hertz
is equally committed.

SCOTT KUSHNER
Out of Left Field

Love hurts
If expletives were drops of rain, I would have drowned
two weeks ago when my beloved Oakland Athletics completed the worst postseason collapse in recent memory.
Since then, I have been able to choke, back my tears
enough to realize that I should snap out of my state of
depression. It's not as bad as it seems. My boys will have
their chances next year. The same, however, cannot be
said of every sports team. In some cases, the relationship
between team and fan is nothing but tough love. Year in,
year out, there are some teams who are all but guaranteed
to leave their faithful fans disappointed.
Since last winning the World Series in 1908 (the longest
drought in baseball), the Chicago Cubs have set the standard for mediocrity. In fact, in those 93 years, the Cubs
have won the pennant only seven times
but finished
fifth or worse 45 times! The cute and cuddly Cubbies test
the hearts of one of the most dedicated fan bases in all of
baseball. Even with the best pitching staff in the National
League and the most lethal offensive weapon in baseball,
the Cubs managed to pull up lame in the home stretch yet
again this year. If only "Rookie of the Year" had been based
on a true story. Poor Cubbies. Poor, poor Cubbie fans.
Look up "colossal choke" in the dictionary and you will
be sure to find the Buffalo Bills. The Bills find a way to lose
every year, whether it requires missing a 34-yard field goal
or allowing a Music City Miracle. Always the bridesmaid,
never the bride, the Bills are the NFL version of a cocktempting their loyal fans with the possibility of a
tease
championship, only to hike up their panties in the postseason. I would never condone rape, but after four straight
years of Lombardi Trophy blue balls, I would have understood it had the town of Buffalo swarmed the field and
sodomized Jim Kelly.
The Los Angeles Clippers have routinely found themselves as the doormat of the NBA. You'd think that after so
many years of having a top-five draft pick, they would
have eventually become a powerhouse ... but instead they
have managed to make themselves quite at home in the
cellar. Speaking of homes, isn't it bad enough that they
struggle to get 15 wins a season? Do they really need to
share their home city with one of the most popular and
successful teams in the NBA? I'm not really sure how a
person living in Los Angeles becomes a Clipper fan. I'm
stumped as to how they are able to maintain their allegiance to such a hapless organization. Clipper fans are the
best evidence we have of people being genetically predisposed to failure.
No list of perennial losers would be complete without
the Boston Red Sox. I would be naive to think I could offer
any greater" insight than the thousands of articles already
documenting Boston's 83 years of futility, so let me throw
out a few memories: Curse of the Bambino, Buckner's blunder, no mo' Mo, Pedro's shoulder, Nomah's wrists, Jimy
"Unemployed" Williams and Duquette running the show.
And finally, I must mention a team that should strike
close to home for all of us Swarthmore College. Whether
you play basketball or lacrosse, we are all actually on the
same team. Not just in the rah-rah school spirit sort of
way, but actually on the same team playing a year-long
game against our arch-rivals, Haverford.
What do I mean?
Well, in 1941, an award called the Hood Trophy was established as a symbol of athletic superiority between the two
colleges. The silver Revere bowl is presented to the school
that wins the most head-to-head varsity contests. Perhaps
the reason why so few Swatties are aware of the Hood
Trophy is that nobody here was around the last time we
won. The trophy has not budged from Haverford since 1995.
We've already dug ourselves into a hole this year, down
5-1 with 12 points (1 point per sport) remaining. So now, I
extend a challenge to all Swarthmore athletes: win the
Hood Trophy this year. Let's show Haverford that our competitive excellence does not end in the classroom. Let's
show our alumni that we can return to athletic promi...

nence. Let's show ourselves.

Garnet lose heartbreaker 2-1 to
Fords in overtime, finish 7-12
BY DERRICK WU

The Garnet Tide closed out the season with two tough
Centennial Conference matches. Playing a man down for
most of the Oct. 27 game, the team lost the home finale 21 in overtime against the formidable Haverford Fords.
Also, on Oct. 24, the Tide dropped a 5-1 decision to the
Washington Shoremen.

Despite a large home crowd, the squad played far below
its potential during its loss to Washington. "We thought
we'd just run right over them," said Nate Shupe 'O5-about
the 3-12-1 Shoremen, who took advantage of the Tide's

lackluster first half play to score three unanswered goals.
"We didn't come ready to play," said tri-captain Frank
Sersale 'O2. "Before we knew it, we were down 3-0."
It was only when the team was down 5-0 with only
three minutes left to play that the home crowd got to see
one of the most spectacular goals of the season. Forward
Amir Jaima 'O4 received a cross in the eighteen by cocaptain Cam MacDearmid 'O3 and managed to score off a
brilliant bicycle kick. "I was going for a header but I
overran the ball," said Jaima. "I saw it go behind me and
just got my foot on it." The ball deflected off the keeper
and into the back of the net for the team's only goal.
The team came back "from the worst game of the sea-

L

son" to play the "best game of the season" against
Haverford, according to Kirk Ellison 'O5. The two teams
faced off for the 79th time in a series that dates back to 192
Haverford holds a slight edge in the longsest running soccer rivalry in the country with a 41-30-8 record.

Swat started off strong, maintaining possession of the
ball and outplaying a talented Haverford team. Stopper
Brendan R. Moriarty 'O4 finished off a pass from Marty
Griffith 'O5 to give the Tide a lead 20 minutes into the
first half. However, the tide shifted against Swarthmore
when forward Brendan Moriarty 'O5 was red-carded for
making late contact with the Fords' goalkeeper early in
the second half. That call "hurt us a lot," said Sersale.
Haverford eventually capitalized on the one-man
advantage. Shupe miscalculated a cross, and allowed the
Fords' Terry Kegel to head the ball into the net in the sixtieth minute of the game. "The wind played a strong factor," said Shupe, "I came out of the net but the wind
pushed the ball out to the eighteen."
The game went to overtime, and Shupe denied a farpost upper nineties shot. However, the FOrds scored
moments later when they sent a corner kick to the far
post. "Since they played a few corner kicks to the near
post, I thought that they would hit it there," said Shupe.
"The ball went to the far post and a Haverford player was
able to finish."
Shupe played an outstanding game for the Garnet, finishing with 19 saves. His teammate, Steven Pater 'O5 was
named to the Centennail Conference Weekly Honor Roll
for his strong defensive play.
Swarthmore, 1-8 in the conference and 7-12 overall, is
looking forward to next year, since they will lose only
two starters, tri-captains Sersale and Chuck Withers 'O2,
and will bring back six starting freshman. "We've got a
great infrastructure for years to come," said Sersale.
