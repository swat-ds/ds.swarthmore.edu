A Mad Monday at Sharples: Viking Helmets, Singing Deans, and Big Hair
By

Fred Bush

Visitors to Sharpies were treated to
a cultural tour de force last Monday:
Scandinavian culture, with Viking
impersonators dishing out Swedish
meatballs and cabbage, and American culture, with nattily-dressed impresarios lip-synching the likes of
Tina Turner and Michael Jackson.
The Scandinavian cuisine, and the
people in Viking hats, came to
Sharpies through the efforts of the
Swarthmore Scandinavian Society.
Formed last semester, the Scandinavian society "wanted to do an allcampus event," said member Carl
Heiberg '96. "People had been asking us questions like, 'What's Scandinavian food?' We thought this'd be
a neat opportunity to introduce them
to Scandinavian cuisine."
The menu consisted of buttered
noodles, which had a disclaimersaying they weren'treally Scandinavian.
All the food was prepared by Sharpies
according to recipes provided by the
Scandinavian Society, except for the
Swedish meatballs, which were ordered specially.
Heiberg felt the food was wellreceived, except that "not too many

people wanted to take the sweet and
sour cabbage. For the people that
took the cabbage, however, it made
their plates aesthetically pleasing."
On the other hand, the Swedish meatballs, were popular even among
people who do not normally eat meat,
Heiberg added.
The food, however, was only part
of the true Viking experience. Scandinavian society members dished out
the dinners, wearing fake blond wigs
and glorious plastic Viking helmets,
surrounded by icons ofScandinavian
culture: mountain goat dolls and an
inflatable version of "The Scream."
After dinner, Bob Savage, professor
emeritus of biology, gave a talk on
the origins of the Vikings, and the
Scandinavian society showedthe film
"My Life as a Dog."
All this was part of International
Week, and the decorations and food
were funded through theInternational
Week budget.
Of course, once diners passed
through the food area, the real fun
began. The SAC-funded lip-synch
contest brought all the glitz and glamour of the '7os to the Big Room, as
students and professors dueled it out.
Entries ranged from the sublime to

the ridiculous. The first entry set the
for what was to come: a rollicking, brawling, knife-fighting rendition of Michael Jackson's "Beat It,"
performed by the "Five Young
Studs": Jonah Steinberg '97, Kerry
Boeye '97, Omar Mencin '97, Jeremy Weinstein '97, and Dan Sachar
'97. Madcap dancers Jimmy Chan
'9B and Tarek Radwan '99 joined in
on the action as the song progressed.
Said Steinberg of the experience: "It
added character and humor to a Mondaynight dinner." Sachar agreed: "We
had a great time practicing and choreographing our routine, but performing really made my day."
Student Council member Vincent
Jones '9B, who performed with a
magnificently huge wig, rocked to
the beat of TinaTurner's ProudMary
along with his back-up band, the Superlatives, consisting ofAisha Hobbs
'99, Andrea Johnson '9B,andTamala
Montgomery '9B. Jones said, "I
thought it was fun. It was funny because during the performance I noticedthatthe stage was splitting apart.
I kept worrying about falling into the
hole that had formed."
The real crowd pleaser, however,
was a group that showed its disdain

CBC Reveals New
Budget to Students

Memorial Lecture Series Begins Today
By

Jessica Harbour

Ling-chi Wang, professor at the
University of California at Berkeley,
will give a speech sponsored by the
Genevieve Ching-Wen Lee '96 Memorial Fund today at 4:30 p.m. in the
Scheuer Room of Kohlberg Hall.
Wang's lecture will be the first supported by this memorial fund, which
was set up by Lee's parents in order
to honor their daughter and to help
current students who share her interest in Asian and Asian-American
studies. The Fund, to be managed by
the Provost's Office, will sponsor
one speaker per year as well as two
grants of $5OO apiece to students who
wish to pursue projects relating to
Asian-American studies.
Lee was participating in a study
abroad program in China run under
the auspices ofDuke University when
she died in August 1994. Lee was on
a 12-day trip to visit various cultural
and historical sites in China, including HuKou Waterfall.
According to a Phoenix article of

September 9, 1994, at the waterfall,
"Lee found a place to sit and take
pictures. She joined herfriends at the
upper level where they were all sitting, then went back down to take
more photographs. Descending, she
slipped and fell into the turbulent
water." Three days later, Lee's body
was discovered 65 kilometers downstream.

"She was very interested in AsianAmerican studies, and her parents
wanted to encourage others to pursue
these interests," said Martha Dean,
Director of Development. "AsianAmerican studies was something she
caredabout very much.. .increasingly
so during her college years."
Paul Wong '97, who knew Lee
through the Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO) of which he is now
co-president, added, "She was also a
good friend who I respected and admired."
Ling-chi Wang, professor at Berkeley since 1972, is the founder of
Chinese for Affirmative Action and a
longtime activist for Chinese and

Asian-American concerns. In the
March 1996 issue of San Francisco
Focus, Joan Walsh wrote, "He is a
soft-spoken but tenacious advocate,
a congenital optimist, brimming with
ideas about how to close the American racial divide...Since he moved to
the Bay Area thirty years ago, Wang
has been that rare being: a truly public intellectual, engaged with the big
issues of his place and time." Wang
has also worked to establish Chineselanguage immersion program and
sponsorChinese speakers at San Francisco schools. As Genevieve Chingwen Lee's uncle, he was specially
chosen by the family to initiate the
lecture series.
A similar, smaller fund was set up
independently by SAO in Lee's
memory. Lee was co-president of
SAO before her death. "Although a
fund was established for Genevieve,
we still felt a need for SAO to honor
her in our own way," Wong explained.
"We felt the best way was to allocate
some of our funds to sponsor member-initiated projects."

Committee Directs Distribution of $600,000 Surplus
By

Genevieve Ching-Wen Lee

Beginning this year, $ 100 ofSAO's
annual budget will go toward the
GenevieveChing-WenLee MemberInitiative Fund, which SAO members will be able to utilize to work on
independentprojects, to set up workshops, or to invite speakers. This past
semester, funds were used to co-sponsor the Asian-American Writers'
Workshop organized by Jean Chen
'96.
This workshop featured the prominent writers Josephine Foo, Regie
Cabico, Barbara Tran, and Marina
Budhos who each read from their
works.

Commitment To House All Keeps Students Worry-Free
By Tony

Sturm

On Tuesday, blocks and sub-free
assignments were released and lottery numbers for those eligible to
participate were distributed. The official room choosing sessions will
occur Sunday through Thursday of
next week.
The block housing went smoothly.
There were a few blocks that were
disqualified because they included
studentswho were not assigned numbers, but this happens every year,
according to Director of Student
Housing Myrt Westphal. She did note
that a list ofall students with numbers
was posted outside of the Dean's
office and that all students should
have checked to make sure that each
member of their block was eligible
for housing.
There was a low turnout for the
substance free housing, especially
among freshmen men. "We were surprised at the low applicant pool for
the class of '99," said Westphal.

This is the third method in the past
three years for substance free halls.
The substance free housing was
picked in the same manner as block
housing. Although two halls in Dana
were designated for sub-free living,
the less-than-anticipated response to
the substance free halls resulted in
only one hall being filled. There were
enough female applicants to fill the
second anticipated hall, butfreshmen
male applicants were few, and the
gender and class ratio on second hall
could not be evened out.
Westphal noted that the survey distributed by the housing committee
earlier this yearindicated much more
interest in substance free housing
from all classes than actually materialized. However "It's a new way of
doing it this year," she said. "You
never know how it is going to turn
out."
She did say that the College will
most likely stick with the present
plan for at least one more year. "I
would say we will probably stick

with it," she commented. "It seems a
fair way to do it."
This year, the stress that many
sophomores felt about the uncertainty
of gaining housing is not as prevalent
as previous years because the College has promised to try to house all
students participating in the lottery.
"I feel pretty confident that I will
get housing, but I am not too optimistic where I'll be," said Anne Heidel
'99, who with her roommate, drew
two of the worst numbers possible.
"What we are saying is that we
expect to house all students who participate in the lottery. What we have
put into the lottery this year is the off
campus overflow housing," said
Westphal. This overflow housing, if
needed, would consist of apartments
off campus, and the living quarters
would be equipped with College
phone jacks and computer network-

ing.
The other significant change in this
year's lottery is thatany rising sophomore who rooms with a rising junior

will not be able to pick on the rising
junior's number; rather, their numbers will be averaged.
This was a result of the roommate
swapping scandal of last year, in
which many rising sophomores drew
rooms with rising juniors and
switched roommates after the lottery.
There are about 1250 beds on campus and, in the past, that has been
enough to house all students. Last
year, there were over 50 students on
the waiting list, and of those students,
everyone whodesired to live on campus was able.
The waiting list will most likely be
needed this year, since some student
numbers go in the 970' s and, if choosing rooms follows precedent, the last
rooms will be chosen around 800.
Nevertheless, the waiting list is not
as formidable this year for most students. "I'm not really worried about
it," said Greg Emkey '99, who expects to wind up near the bottom of
the list. "I am confident that we will
be housed."

New Registration Process Promises Positive Reactions
By

Laura Smid

Registrar Martin Warner and Registration Review Committee Chair
Craig Williamson held a meeting
Monday night to answer students'
questions about the new registration
policy. In attendance were members
ofStudent Council, who had planned
to attend as a group before theirregularly-scheduled meeting.
Thanking Warner and Williamson
for their willingness to address student concerns, Student Council CoCoordinator and CBC Representative Tony Cheesebrough '97 commented on the relative emptiness of
the room. "I think the fact that not so
many students showed up can be taken
as a good sign," he said.
Cheesebrough expressed a hope that

the poor attendance at the meeting
was an indication that most students
already understood the new policy.
The changes in the registration
policy are designed to cut down drastically on the number of studentswho
will need to attend registration in
Sharpies on May 5. Registering students are required to meet with their
advisors this week to get their courses

approved.
Those who do not do so may have
a block placed on their access to the
computer pre-enrollment program.
During pre-enrollment, which begins
this Friday at 2 p.m. and ends at
midnight on Tuesday, students will
sign up for no more than 4.5 credits
each.
Williamson and other members of
the Review Committee hope that this

limit will ensure that students sign up
only for the courses they actually
want to take, and thus, fewer courses
will be over-subscribed. Only those
students whose courses are lotteried
will have to attend registration in
Sharpies. The lottery system will be
done directly from pre-enrollment
data, and it will be the same for all
departments.
In the past, departments have developed their own systems, which
were, as Williamson puts it, "sometimes unfair."
Although there are still some details that remain to be ironed out
such as what to do about overseas
students, incoming first-year students,
and students planning to take 5 credits—Williamson hopes that the new
system will be more fair and more
—

efficient than the old one. "Registration has always been thorny," he says.
Student reaction, for the most part,
seems to be positive. "I think it [the
new system] is good because it will
be more convenient," said Jodi Furr
'97. Furr plans to avoid the Sharpies
registration because her classes are
"never lotteried." Mara Landers '97
and Chris Mazingo '97 agree that the
new system will be a tremendous
time-saver.
It remains to be seen, however,
whether Cheesebrough's optimistic
statement at the meeting on Monday
will prove correct. When questioned
Thursday, for instance, Amber Thompson '97 did not know what the
new policy entailed. "Is that what I
just threw away?" he asked. "I'm
really not up to date."

Jonathan Reed

Eleven students met withadministration officials Wednesday evening
to discuss uses for the additional dispensable income provided by the
strong endowment performance during the 1995 calendar year. The new
budget items are currently under considerationfor submission to theBoard
of Managers. President Bloom, Provost Keith, Dean Ly thcott, Vice President Aslanian, and Professor Charles
Grinstead were present.
Aslanian gave background information about the College budgeting
process and announced that the budget calendarhad been changed so that
various components of the budget
would individually seek Board approval in at the December, March,
and May Board of Managers meetings. He noted that the College endowment performance for the calendar year 1995 was 20%; since the
endowment performed better than
anticipated in the five-year financial
plan, there was an extra $600,000 in
the budget. Aslanian discussed the
question of whether the College
should reinvest these excess funds,
use them to sponsor one-timeprojects,
or apply them to ongoing programs.
The CBC had decided to spend
$216,000 of the extra income on recurringprojects and $ 175,000 on onetime expenditures.
One of the new permanent expendituresthe College is budgeting is the
Language Learning Center in
Kohlberg Hall. An additional growing expense is the cost of maintaining
library services. An extra $50,000
will be provided to the library's budget each year for the next five years.
The Collegedid comparative research
regarding spending on library resources and concluded that nationally Swarthmore is about average in
total spending yet is highest in per
student spending on library resources.
Another large College expense is
the cost of keeping a low student-tofaculty ratio, currently at 8.5 : 1.
Maintaining this low ratio and keeping a need-blind admissions policy
take up a significant portion of the
College budget, it was reported.
President Bloom brought up the

fact that financial aid grants —money
given by the College to those in financial need—were "way up" because of the College's commitment
to need-blind admissions. However,
he did state that the College has a
$500,000 contingency fund to cover
these grants and is building a
$2,000,000 reserve account as a backup for the contingency fund. He noted
that the College came to within
$15,000 of the contingency fund last
year to cover additional grants.
For the last academic year,
$8,901,000 was allocated for financial aid grants. This year, the allocation is $9,363,000; this figure represents an increase of 5.7% in College
funds allocated to financial aid. In a
written statement, President Bloom
compared this increase to the 2.5%
increase in departmental budgets, the
4.1% increase in compensation pools
for faculty and staff, and the 4.3%
increase in tuition and fees.
The Committee also discussed the
phasing out of the InternationalRelations concentration; it was stated that
students who are currently partaking
in this concentration will be allowed
to continue as will future students
who propose such in their sophomore
papers. However, the concentration
will not be listed in the College Bulletin. The reduction in this concentration is expected to save the College $35,000.
The natural science division and
economics department both are to
receive $17,000 in extra funds for the
upcoming year. Other new fund allocations include increasedrecruitment
activity in theAdmissions office; this
represents a cost of $165,000 this
year. Partial conversion of the campus-wide network from Apple Talk
to Ethernet was also funded; $75,000
was awarded to provide 1/3 of the
campus with Ethernet and $31,000
was given to expand Internet access.
Evan Dorn '97 introduced himself
and delivered a brief speech supporting Ethernet in the dorms, citing both
the Geometry and Math Forums and
SCCS. Justin Hall '97 and Samuel
Weiler '96 were also present to support the installation of Ethernet in the
dorms. According to Dorn's report,
the cost of conversion to Ethernet in
the dorms would total $225,000.

College Library Budget Quickly Becoming Exhausted Due To Rising Costs
By

Aarti

Iyer

The librarybudget, which provides
funds for all three libraries on campus, is being exhausted more quickly
than in the past due to rapidly increasing expenditures.
Slightly over one million dollars is
spent annually on materials—books
and journals—for the libraries; College Librarian Michael Durkan estimates that $600,000 of this money is
spent on journals and periodicals
alone. This is because they are bought
on subscription, and thus the libraries
are committed to buying them for a
certain number of years. Due to their
high costs, no new journals are added
to the collection, except at the request
of a faculty member or a department.
The Treasurer's Office of the College recommends how much money

the library should apply for, and asks
for justification for any requested
funding that exceeds that amount.
The Librarian's Office submits a budget proposal to the Provost, who then
sends it to the College Budget Committee. The CBCreviews it and makes
recommendations to the Board of
Managers, which gives the proposal
the final stamp of approval.
The College increases library funding based on the Consumer Price Index, which allows for inflation. The
prices of books and journals, however, increase at a much steeper rate:
according to Morrison, book prices
have increased 4.6 percent annually
over the past five years, and journal
prices have increased 10.4 percent
every year. The average annual inflation rate from 1990 to 1994 has only
been 3.64 percent (Source: Statistical

Environmental Justice Week at Swat
By

Ben Salter

This past week was declared Environmental Justice Week by Students Promoting Environmental
Equality In Chester (SPEEC).
SPEEC is a student group that
works withChester Residents Confor Quality Living
(CRCQL), a grassroots citizens'
organization in Chester. The groups
organize protests against Russell,
Rea, and Zappala (RR&Z), an investment banking firm that owns
the property on which several waste
treatment facilities are located.
The two groups also circulate petitions and educate Chester residents and Swarthmore students
about the "environmental racism"
they feel is being perpetuated in
Chester.

Pollution emitted by these facilitieshas resulted in numerous health
problems for the people of Chester.
Combined with the trash incinerator, polluting companies bring hundreds of tons of waste into Chester
every day.

instance, Durkan asked for a $98,000

Another problem is that in the last
20 years, a great deal of scientific
research has been published in Europe, thus necessitating the purchase
of foreign journals. These journals
are not only more expensive, but their
prices are pegged to the US dollar.
The strength of the dollar then plays
an important role in determining the
final cost of these journals. According to Morrison's statistics, a strong
dollar has resulted in a 6 percent
increase in the price of foreign journals, but when the dollar has been
weak, the price of the same journal
has gone up by an increased rate of 14
percent.
Since the College does not take
these factors into account, the libraries do not receive all the money they
need to cover increasing costs. For

increase in funding this year, but was
only granted $50,000 more.
"[The budget] is used principally
for book funds—what we spend on
journalsand books—as well as monographs, microfiche, sound and video
recordings, and continuations [the
purchase of remaining volumes in a
set ofbooks as they are subsequently
published over a period time]," said
Michael Durkan of the Librarian's
Office. The rest of the money is used
for supplies, student help, telephone
services, and journal-binding. "We
are also buying more electronic products, more CD-ROMs and the like,"
said Amy Morrison of Technical Services, who is to replace Durkan when
he retires on June 13.
The library has never come into
conflict with the College in selecting

materials for purchase. Books and
journalspurchased are recommended
by departments and individual faculty members.
There are also three division librarians—each representing the natural
sciences, the social sciences, and the
humanities—who are responsible for
the development of the collection in
their particular area.
There are 625,000 volumes in the
three libraries combined, which have
been accumulated from gifts and purchases by the College. There are an
additional 140,000 volumes in the
Government Documents sections.
These volumes are not paid for;

According to Director of Admissions Susan Untereker, the Admissions Office has taken a proactive
approach to minority recruitment in
the past two years.
While there is no master list of the
schools visited by the deans, though
they each have a record of where they
visited. Collectively, 60 percent of
the deans' visits are to public schools
and 40 percent to private and parochial schools. The deans also visit
schools with Admissions officers
from institutions like Pomona and
Bowdoin to encourage students to
consider small liberal arts colleges.
Jim Bock, assistant dean of Admissions responsible for visiting the
Midwestern region, said, "You learn
new places every year. We continue
to visit the prep schools, but the prep
schools know us, and they'll keep
sending kids to us."
Bock visited 21 private schools
(including parochial schools) and 29
public schools. Of the 29 public
schools, 19 schools could be classi-

Sharpies."
Kelly says that the first protest
did not have much impact upon
RR&Z. As for government legislation, the DEP has said that it is
reviewing the situation, which
Kelly says "doesn't really mean
much." Kelly says that there is legislation in Congress right now to
make equity more of a concern in
policy making. Thebill would force
governments to take racial composition of a community into consideration before granting permits.

fied as suburban or public select, like
magnet schools, and 10 schools were
inner-city schools. Additionally, two
of the parochial schools were located
in the inner city. This dean chose not
to visit as many inner-city public
schools because he attended four
National Scholarship Fairs which targeted minority students.
Alumni have been helpful in the
recruitment process. A graduate
teaching in the Rio Grande Valley,
for example, inspired her students to
apply for admission to Swarthmore
by describing her experiences here.
The Office also tries to attract a
diverse pool of applicants by having
a diverse staff. For example, Rosa
Garcia, assistant dean of admissions,
speaks Spanish. She is thus able to
communicatewith parents whose first
language is Spanish, allowing those
parents to be a part of the admissions
process and making those parents
feel more comfortable sending their
child to a college whose language is
English.
The deans encounter various oddities when trying to schedule visits to

high schools. For example, according to Jim Bock, the state of Virginia
only allows college representatives
to visit public schools during lunch
hour.
The Admissions Office also hopes
to attract first-generation college students. Untereker said, "We feel it is
so important to have this group of
students represented in our student
body. [After we receive a student's
application,] we code it on our computers. That's viewed positively, as
an extra point, as something that
Swarthmore values."
Last weekend, a total of 330 prospective students spent at least one
night on campus. Of these, 122 were
students of color. There were also a
small group of students who just visited for the day. To date, the Admissions Office has received over 200
deposits from students who plan to
matriculate. This exceeds the number received at this time last year.
"The students of color from the
pool this year are awesome. I just
hope they matriculate," said
Untereker.

outdated material," said Morrison.
They are then either placed in the
library book-sale or thrown away.
The library budget is comparable
to that of other schools, according to
statistics compiled by Morrison. In a
comparison groupthat includes other
small liberal-arts colleges such as

Amherst, Bowdoin, Oberlin, Smith,
Mount Holyoke, Middlebury, Bryn
Mawr and others, Swarthmore has
one ofthe highest library expenditure
figures per student. (Morrison cautioned that Swarthmore also has one
ofthelowest enrollments ofthe group,
so that might affect the figure to a
certain extent.) In terms of total expenditures, Swarthmore is in the top
third percentile of the schools in the
group. "We're not lavish, but we're
not lacking in any way either," commented Durkan.

Next week, The
Phoenix will explore
what draws students
to Swarthmore and
what turns them away.

$600,000 extra, and none for financial aid.
Two months ago, the College Budget Committee recommended that the
summer work expectation for financial aid recipients be increased by $100;
the Board of Managers accepted the proposal two weeks later. As we've
written many times, the plan puts financial aid recipients under even more
pressure than they're under now, and for no good reason: it will save
Swarthmore less than $70,000, a tiny fraction of a budget that exceeds $5O
/
million.
If the College were desperate for money—if endowment income had fallen
precipitously, and we couldn't afford to pay the faculty—then the increase
would be reasonable. But given CBC's announcement this week that higherthan-expected endowment income had produced a $600,000 surplus, the
increase is simply wrong.
To fulfill itsmission of producing socially responsible graduates, Swarthmore
must offer equal opportunities to all. And as Professor Donna Jo Napoli
argued in these pages last week, equal opportunity includes not just equal
opportunity to attend class, but equal opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities and equal opportunity to pursue meaningful
over the
summer and after graduation.
Needless to say, the more money students on aid must earn, the harder it is
for them to join student organizations or take low-paying yet worthwhile jobs.
/
The new summer work expectation goes too far.
That's why we're shocked that CBC's long list of ways to spend the
$600,000 surplus does not include a recommendation to rescind the summer
work increase. We'll be spending more on library books next year, more on
the language lab, more on recruitment, more on the computer network —but
not a cent of the surplus will go to financial aid.
In fairness, the recommendations CBC issued in February included a 5.7
percent increase in financial aid spending, far greater than the increases in
other areas of the budget. But 5.7 percent wasn't enough to keep the summer
work expectation at an appropriate level; considering how little it would cost
to roll back the work increase, and how much an extra $ 100 this summer could
mean to students, CBC's decision to stick with the increase is unconscionable.
It leads us to wonder whether the numerous protests in late February and
early March—a sit-in at the Board of Managers meeting, editorials in this
newspaper, open meetings in Parrish Parlors—made any difference at all.
With a $600,000 surplus, CBC should have found it easy to respond to campus
complaints about its financial aid plan. But it chose to do nothing.
We're left to wonder whether CBC really cares about financial aid, and
whether CBC really cares about students.

Collection shouldn't be a glorified study break.
When Collection was reinstituted as a regular event last spring, we were

pleased. Collection is a way of bringing the entire carnpus together on issues
which concern us all. It's a means of provoking debate and reaching about
consensus on the important issues of our time, such as racism, homophobia,
and hate speech. Collection is a powerful tool for allowing the campus
community to think seriously about a social problem, or a dilemma facing us.
Many issues have been worthy of a Collection this semester. Debate over
the nature of the IC, and the restructuring of the position ofassociate dean for
multicultural affairs, have sparked protest. The cancellation of the popular
Soc-Anth course "Wisdom and the Healing Arts" heis provoked an outcry, and
prompted discussion of who exactly decides which courses should be offered
here. Changes in the financial aid policy have drawn firefrom various campus
groups. A Collection would allow students and faculty to draw nearer to one
another, would perhaps help bring the campus nearer to consensus on these
troublesome issues. Yes, there are plenty of reasons why we should call a
Collection.
Massage is not a reason to call a Collection.
In case you've missed the announcements, Student Council has scheduled
a "stress-relieving" Collection for 1 p.m. today, featuring snack food and
body massages. We disapprove ofthe message thatthis sends to the Swarthmore
community. There is a history behind Collection, a history ofdiscussion about
meaningful issues, not a history of back rubs and Coca-Cola. When a
Collection is called merely to have a few massages, a few laughs, and relieve
stress, the idea ofCollection as a forum for community debate is undermined.
When there are so many other issues dividing the campus, calling a Collection
for the sake of massage is frivolous and irresponsible.
If Student Council or SAC wants to spend some of their leftover money
before the end of the financial year, so be it. However, they should not attach
the noble word "Collection" to what is just a glorified study break.
It's silly.

Put your time where your mouth is.
At the end of a semester that has witnessed frequent calls for more student
involvement in College decisions comes a new round of Student Council
elections.
It is one thing to support an increased role for those student representatives
in the abstract, and another to take on actual concrete responsibilities. We call
upon those who are concerned about the direction of College policy to
demonstrate their concern by running for Student Council.
In recent semesters, relatively few students have run for Student Council or
applied for positions on College committees. Many committees had to call for
students to apply on multiple occasions, and several students ran unopposed
for Student Council last semester. Considering this, it's hard to argue that
students need more seats on faculty and administration committees: the
student body has a hard time filling the slots it has right now.
We call, therefore, on students who profess disappointment or outrage over
decisions that the College had made, whether they concern curriculum
decisions, financial aid, or admissions policy, to back up their words with
action and run for Student Council positions.
As long as the issues in question are perceived as a minor issue for most
students, as long as it seems like negjative reaction is confined to a vocal few,
we cannot blame the administration or the Board of Managers if they assume
that the present level of student input is sufficient.Show your commitment;
get your name on the ballot.

Bill

Clinton and Congressional
Democrats want to raise the
minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15 per hour. Clinton sees this proposal as a reelection strategy. And it
just might work—if the public remains ignorant of the wolf in sheep's
clothing that minimum wage laws
represent.
These laws produce the an effect
directly opposite to what theirproponents claim. They widen the gap between rich and poor, decrease
everyone's spending power, and increase unemployment.
Let's look atthis in economic terms.
Say the government legislates minimum wage to be $5.15. Hence, it is
illegal for anyone whose labor is
worth less than $5.15 on the market
to sell his or her labor at market price.
Employers who can afford to buy
labor for, say, $4.50 an hour are prohibited from doing so by law. Fewer
employers will be able to afford to
hire workers at the inflated rate, and
some employers may lay off workers
because they can't afford to pay the
higher wage. Some companies will
hire workers oversees or in Mexico
because they cannot afford to employ
American workers at minimum wage.
Demand of a commodity drops when
its price is increased. The minimum
wage law does not guarantee anyone

nothing ! What kind of economic incentive does one have? Work, if he
ever found any, would give him only
$46 more per week than he would get
for not working at all!
OK, so what if the worker is hired?
To stay in business, the employer
must compensate for hiring the labor
at an artificially inflated price. The
price of the product is higher than it
would have been without the minimum wage law, as the cost of production is higher because of more expensive labor. Who pays the price? The
consumers, ofcourse, in higherpriced
goods and services. (And who suffers most? The poor.)
Those with inflated salaries spend
them on goods and services whose
prices are similarly inflated, so their
net purchasing power is not increased.
Banks and people who need loans
suffer too, as the employer operating
at lower efficiency will have less
money to invest in R&D, stocks of
small growing companies, banks who
make loans to students, or charities.
Everything is related to everything
else. We cannot change one aspect of
the system and expect everything else
to remain unchanged. The whole is
the sum of its parts, but those parts
interact with eachother. The economy
is not a machine with which we can
tinker to achieve our own ends. Individuals have rights —and these rights
should matter to anyone who values
human life. They are not rights to

Those who remain unemployed are
deprived of the chance to develop
skills needed to enter higher salary
job brackets. Minimum wage laws
increase the abundance of unskilled
labor. Most harmed by minimum
wage laws are those withfewer skills.
The skilled workers with jobs worth
over $5.15 get hired despite the law.
The less skilled workers can not be
hired legally—they get left behind
and remain unemployed, unskilled,
and downtrodden.
Furthermore, because most unskilled laborers are minorities, minimum wage laws are racially discriminatory. After World War 11, the teenage black unemployment rate was 8
percent. As of 1980, it was over 35
percent. The minimum wage widens
thegap between rich andpoor, skilled
and unskilled. See Henry Hazlitt's
Economics in One Lesson.
Look at marginal cost issues. A
worker whose labor is worth $4.50
per hour can now legally earn $ 180
per 40 hour work week.But theDemocrats want to forbid him to work for
less than $206 dollarsper week($5.15
per hour). This guy is now legally
unemployable at $4.50 an hour, so he
is made jobless by the law. Say the
government's unemployment compensation supports his idleness for
$l6O per week. LOOK: Without the
minimum wage law, this person could

Letters
Response to Seth Harvey: in defense
To the editor:
I am sorry that Student Council has
"disappointed" Seth Harvey in its
actions since his departure from the
Council last fall, but his diatribe
against the Council's campaign on
financial aid in last week's Phoenix
was unfairand immature. He letloose
with a torrent of condescending
charges, yet backed them up with not
a single knowledgable argument.
Writing as treasurer of SASS and as
a former Student Council co-coordinator, Harvey complained that "the
Council was presumptuous and factually incorrect in arrogating the responsibility for promoting diversity
by linking it solely to the financial aid
policies of the school."
First of all, I think that I speak for
most of the membersofCouncil when
I express my surprise at learning that
promoting diversity is considered by
anyone to be a responsibility that can
be "arrogated"by one group ofpeople
from another. While I have a great
deal of respect for SASS as an organization and for the work it has done
over its history to promote diversity
at Swarthmore, I feel just as responsible, as a representative of a Swarthmore student body that seems at least
to profess a concern for diversity, to
do what I can as well. If this is a

to the

of Council's

presumptuous attitude to have as a
student representative at Swarthmore,
then I have trouble fathoming just
why we bother to have studentrepresentation at all.
It is actually Seth Harvey that is
being "factually incorrect" in his representation of the issue. He is quick to
pick up the administration line that
SC "painted a one-sided face," on
efforts to promote diversity by "linking it solely to the financial aid policies of the school," but he fails, as the
administration has, to point out one
instance in which anyone on Student
Council ever suggested that financial
aid was the sole means of promoting
diversity. He also never explains what
exactly he feels was wrong with the
real Student Council message, which
was that, when financial aid is an
issue, as it was this semester, issues
of race and class diversity simply
cannot be ignored. He cannot honestly believe that, if Swarthmore reduced its overall studentaid, the number of students from low-income
backgrounds, both white and minority, wouldn't fall.
Student Council did not launch a
campaign to promote diversity and
then decide that somehow the best
way to do that was to promote financial aid. It learned that the College

else's wishes.
Next time you realize you want the
society you live in to be a certain
way, don't jump to the conclusion
that a government edict can magically make it so—because it can't.
Look at the past. Look at the "Great
Society." Look at all the incidents in
which the market is blamed for problems government policy caused, and
in which more policy was intended to
"fix" the problem (the Great Depression, monopolies, health care...). It
doesn't work. More importantly, it
violates individual rights.
Instead of using threats to achieve
our goals, why not workfor cooperation? Minimum wage laws threaten
to use force against anyone who
breaks them, anyone who wants to
hire someone for a price he can afford. Such laws do not work, although
they sound good if you look to the
government to magically make things
all better. They also sound good if
you do not mind using force to achieve
your ends.
Bill Clinton, like many politicians
ofboth parties, is just power hungry.
He does not care if his proposals
actually work. He cares only that the
people think they work. So it's no use
telling him he's wrong. Don't let
welfare statists fool you, and remember: if religion is the opium of the
masses, socialism is the pipe.

concerns about financial aid and diversity.
was considering some substantial
changes in the financial aid program
that would affect students this year,
and that certain budgetary policies in
place at the time threatened to change
the composition of aid packages toward higher and higher loans in the
future. The future diversity of the
student body was one among many
concerns that members of Council
had in learning of these issues, and
that is why we pursued it. We were
also concerned that this was all happening withoutstudents' knowledge,
and that is why we pursued the issue
ofconfidentiality. We were concerned
that without increased studentrepresentation on policy-making committees there was no way to ensure a
student voice in decisions directly
affecting their lives, and that is why
we pursued the issue of studentrepresentation.
I challenge Seth Harvey to tell
people what it was Student Council
was so "factually incorrect" about.
Was it "factually incorrect" to say
that students on financial aid will be
paying more in loans and working
more hours to meet their work-study
requirements next year? Was it "factually incorrect" to say that unless the
budgetary cap on financial aid expenditures is ignored or removed,

students' loan burdens will rise even
higher than the administration has
warned? Harvey asks, "why doesn't
[Student Council] get the facts straight
by listening to and understanding the
administration's view?" I would excuse this comment as uninformed
naivete if it were not for the fact that
Seth Harvey was a SC co-coordinator and knows well how things work
around here. He should have known
that the College administration was
not planning to shout from the rooftops that financial aid changes were
being proposed, certainly not until
after the decisions were made and
finalized.
The original administration position was that students should not have
been informed of the changes until
after the Board of Managers voted on
them. It was only after SC resorted to
what Harvey calls its "misguided tactics" that students were involved in
the debate. Harvey may well disapprove of the way certain students
(such as the group that very graphically linked race and class by plastering Parrish withwhite plates) participated in that debate, but his misrepresentation of the efforts of Student
Council is not a way to start a "reasoned debate."

Response to Thomas Ta: Perpetuating stereotypes about Zionists does not solve the problem.
To the editor:
As members of the Israeli Politics
Discussion Group, we protest Thomas Ta's outright condemnation of
Israel in his letter to the editor of
March 29, 1996. While Mr. Ta criticizes stereotyping and prejudice
against Muslims, he turns his argument around and stereotypes Zionists. Zionists are not all of the Baruch
Goldstein brand; in fact, all of the
members of our group are "productfs]
of Zionism and American culture,"
and the last thing any of us would do
is go out and kill Palestinians. We try
to understand the situation ofthe Palestinians and work toward a just and
equal peace. It is unfair to considerall
Zionists violentreactionaries. Zionism is a broad ideology, with a spectrum of creeds, from reactionary to
progressive. The unifying factor of
Zionism is the belief in the existence
of a Jewish state. Mr. Ta commits the
very crime he condemns by stereotyping all Zionists as anti-Palestinian
and reactionary.
As progressive Zionists, we question the short and violent history of
the state of Israel. We realize that
Israel is not perfect, that it has perpetrated violence and discrimination
against Palestinians, and that it has

created an awful situation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. While we do
not condone Israeli policy towards
the Palestinians, we realize, in Mr.
Ta's own words, that, the conflicthas
a very "complicated history." The
conflict is not black and white. Zionists did not come to Palestine intending to colonize or oppress Arabs, but
in order to escape persecution and
oppression in Europe. They were
desperate just as the Palestinians are
today.
According to Benny Morris, leftwing historian and authorofThe Birth
of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,
1947-1949, the Arab exile from Palestine was not a simple expulsion by
Zionist forces, but an "incremental,
cumulative, multi-causal, multistaged process in which Palestine's
Arabs and external Arab forces, along
with the Zionist politicians andarmed
forces, played roles." Both sides committed atrocities. Contrary to Mr. Ta's
statement, there are not "two to three"
Palestinian civilians killed daily by
Israeli forces. The most recent Amnesty International report on human
rights in Israel and the occupied territories has no mention ofany Israeli
killing of Palestinians outside of the
assassination of Ayyid Ayyash, a

Our policy on anonymous letters and opinions.
This week, The Phoenixreceived an unsigned letter in campus mail. We are
with our long-standing policy on anonymous letters.
We feel, however, that this is an appropriate time to reiterate that policy:
Ordinarily, letters to the editor must be signed. Where the interest of the
community is best served by publication of a letter, but the writer can expect
severe consequences should his or her identity become known, we will
consider withholding the writer's name. However, the writer's identity must
in all cases be known to the editors, so we can confirm that anonymity is
required and that the letter is not a hoax.
Should the individual who sent this week's anonymous letter make himself
or herself known to us, we will consider publishing the letter unsigned.
not printing it, in keeping

Hamas leader responsible for masterminding suicide bombings in Israel. Mr. Ta's facts are clearly outdated.The number ofPalestinian refugees in other Arab countries has not
grown because of more recent expulsion but because of natural population growth. Israel is in fact guilty of
destroying terrorists' houses and imposing cruel curfews and closures on
the Palestinian population in the occupied territories. Right now, the
objective of the Israeli government is
not to oppress Palestinians, but to
make peace and to help them create
their own autonomous state. And yet,
what is Israel to do when 60 of its
people are killed within a week?
It is now timeto correct the wrongs
of the past, not to perpetuate hatred.
If one cannot condemn desperate

Palestinian terrorists, neither can one
condemn Israel. Violence and murder are wrong, no matter which side
you're on. Mr. Ta paints a very black
and white picture of the PalestinianIsraeli conflict, which seems to go
against his own belief that the whole
issue is multifaceted and complex.
Mr. Ta, if you want a decent discussion of the Middle East conflict,
please come to our next meeting,
Monday at 8:00 p.m. in Parrish Parlors. The conflict will not be solved
by hate and a spirit of retribution.
How can you shake hands when
you're pointing fingers?

this send? Our willingness to return
people to life-threatening situations
has been shown all too frequently.
The principles of freedom and security this country purports to represent
should not stop at our geographic
borders; all people need to be protected. Dedication to the protection
ofhuman rights means that it is wrong
to send people back into dangerous
situationsbecause our quotas are full.
What is to be done? The United
States needs to reaffirm its commitment to human rights. All legitimate
refugees should have the right to stay
in the United States, and they should
be able to expect the support of our
government in resettlement. Also,
non-refugee immigrant policies
should be liberalized so that more
people access to the opportunities
this nation can offer.
As we consider our immigration
policy, we must remember that we
are a country of immigrants that has
benefited from a mix of heritages and
traditions. Immigrants are a benefit,
not a burden. Exclusive policies fail
to address economic problems, ignore human rights issues, and are
contrary to the principles on which
this country was founded.

seem ironic in a nation of immigrants—yet that sentiment
dominates recently proposed immigration legislation. While some regulations allow for relatives ofcitizens,
skilled laborers, certain refugees and
select other groups to enter the country, U.S. policy-makers are constantly
looking for new ways to keep people
out, for example by restricting some
from entering and lowering existing
quotas. Why? Many argue that immigrants and refugees drain the resources of our social service programs and take jobs away from
American citizens. These and other
reasons for more immigration restrictions are flawed. Not only are the
justifications for the exclusion based
on false premises, there are numerous benefits to inclusion.
There is no evidence that an increase in immigration would be an
economic burden on theUnited States.
Logic, and a bit of simple economics,
tells us that more people mean more
demand for our nation's goods and
services.
The next logical extension of this
is that increased demand creates more
jobs. It is also important to realize
that immigrants/refugees pay the
same taxes we do. Rather than simply
living off our social programs, immigrants contribute to our economic
growth. Implementing harsh immigration restrictions doesn't keep

that it doesn't care about diversity.
Your columnist, to be frank, can see
no way around this, besides perhaps
stating some objections to the segregation policy in its invitation mailings—because, as we all know, actions speak louder than words, and
the statement made by eliminating
such a weekend would send a far
stronger message than any disclaimer
in an admissions package. But while
he understands the hitches associated
with dropping the weekend, it still
troubles him that symbolism—"what
people might think" as opposed to
"what we really mean"—should influence College policy to this extent.
If there are legitimate reasons for
having the weekend, thatis one thing;
if appearances alone are' at issue, it
might be worth considering how that
reflects the institution's ideals.
There are certainly merits to helping students find peers and potential
friends by dint of common experience, but trying to establish common
experience by nonwhite status is not
a reliable way of going about things,
nor are there obvious reasons why
that common ground cannot be found
within the "regular" occasion. Given
the drawbacks inherent in separating
out minority pre-frosh, your columnist urges the admissions committee
to consider integrating those activities into the general weekend, symbolism be damned.

Leos are usually so loving and loyal towards their
friends, but sometimes there are exceptions. For
example, while you are working on your big
project, a kindhearted Capricorn tries to lend a

acampus as small as Swarthmore's,
you tend to get to know peers as
individuals. This explains the shock
on finding out that a friend who you knew as
a unique person has a twin. Instantly, you
assume the twins are the same person—personality, interests, physical appearance. It is
not until you delve deeper and possibly meet
the mysterious twin that you realize, most
often, that your friend and his or her twin are
distinct individuals.
Swarthmore's class of 1997 has nine twins
and the class of 1999 has three twins; two of
the twins in each class make up a set. Considering this large number of twins, what attracts
both twins to Swarthmore, and what makes
twins decide to attend different schools?
Diana and Susan Hunt '99 never wanted to
go to college together, but they both applied
early to Swat and thenrefused to give it up. "I
think that one of the hardest things about
being a twin is that you constantly reiterate
things for each other. I may not be interested
in a class at first, but once Diana starts talking
about it, I want to take it also. So, she'd
mention how beautiful the ampitheater was,
and soon we were both dying to come here,"

said Susan.
Being a part of the same school does have
its little perks, however. "We don't have
identical friends or activities, so we're able to
live as individual people here," said Diana.
"But, it still gets frustrating when people mix
us up or assume that we're exactly the same
in every way."
Future roommates? Not quite. "We aren't
rooming together next year because then
people would really think that we're the same
and we'd have no social life because everyone would assume that we couldn'tbear to be
apart," said Susan.
A dual Swattie existence has had its ups
and downs. Neither Diana nor Susan wanted
to have classes together this year. They decided that one would take biology and one
would take chemistry in the fall, and then
they would switch. What they didn't realize
is that Chem 10 isn't offered in the spring,
and now Susan is a year behind. "I'm still
really ticked off," said Susan.
There have, however, been some fringe
benefits: a steadfast dinnercompanion, double
the friends, the halls, the study breaks, the
food...and a great support system. "We don't
fight often and this year I have really needed
her support. Our grandmother and my favorite teacher both died in the falland it was good
to have her here," said Diana. For the Hunts,
going to college together has meant a bunch
of mix-ups and stupid twin jokes, but it has
been worth it in the end, especially when
neither of them can resist four years of Sunday dinners at Sharpies.

relationship with each other.
Jeremy Weinstein '97, an honors political
science major, has a fraternal twin, Joshua,
who attends Vassar where he studies theater
and music. When they applied to college,
there was no overlap due to their different
intended fields of study, even though Joshua
applied to eleven schools.
"Growing up with someone you were supposed to be similar to makes you want to be
your own person," said Jeremy. He cites
parental encouragement as well as his and
Joshua's lack of resemblance—Joshua has
blond hair and blue eyes while Jeremy has
brown hair and eyes—as reasons why it has
been easier to develop into independent
people.
As a result, people at Swat are shocked to
learn of Joshua's existence. Jeremy enjoys
theirreactions and likes to drop this piece of
information randomly into conversations.
Both Jeremy and Joshua feel that attending
different colleges has made their friendship
much stronger.
Being a twin seems to bring about some
trademark concerns. Each set of twins has
had similar experiences of not wanting to be
considered the same person and a desire to be
individual and avoid competition. "The trick
to being a twin," said Jeremy, "is to be independent but still be friends." The ways in
which Swarthmore twins have achieved this
balance vary greatly. The key to success is a
comfortable distance and individual space,
whether it be found several cities, Wawas, or
dorms apart.

Logistical Dilemma Sparked
'69 Proposal for Coed Dorms
By

Emily Mott (Swarthmore '97) and Alison
Mott (Bryn Mawr '97) are identical twins
who intentionally did not attend the same
college, but wanted to be in close proximity
to each other. Striving to avoid academic
competition and people's tendency not to see
the differences between them, they established their own peer communities at their
respective schools.
Emily considered spending a semester at
Bryn Mawr because the warm environment
really appeals to her. Even though in the past
Emily and Alison might have viewed this as
an encroachment on the other's home turf,
their fear of being compared has largely disappeared since they have been at college.
They now understand that a semester on the
same college campus might not be as difficult
as going to high school together.
They see each other about two times a
month and, as a result, Alison has made
several friends at Swat. Emily, who lives offcampus, says ofher twin: "She eats at Sharpies
more than I do."
Being apart from Alison has made Emily
realize that, "Life is a state of being in relationships with other people and that all relationships require maintenance. Just .because
you are twins doesn'tmeanyou are automatically friends. You have to work at it."
Emily explained that when her peers find
out she has a twin, they are "enchanted and
express a desire to meet her. They also assume I miss her—which is true." Luckily,
being a part of the Tri-co system has made
them close enough to be able to pursue a

I noticed during that summer at RMBL
that I'd been living in a pretty sheltered
environment, in terms ofthe people I'dhad
the privilege of being with, and it took a
little while to get over my disappointment.
It's a really great thing for us to be here and
for us to be with all these people. At the
same time, I think we need to remember
this isn't the real world. It's easy to be
intolerant and judgmental, and I hope that
we don't leave this place feeling like that.

LEISURE

Nobel Prize Winner To Present Lecture
By

John Freeman

Nobel prize winning poet and playwright Derek Walcott will
read from his work this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. The reading will
be held in the cinema of the Lang Performing Arts Center.
One of the most distinguished West Indian poets today,
Walcott mixes island rhythms with English verse forms to
create lyrical and provocative poetry.
Born in 1930 on the island ofSt. Lucia, Walcott published his
first work, "In a Green Night" in 1961. Since then, he has gone
on to publish numerous volumes of verse including several
long narrative poems such as "Another Life" and "Osmeros"
which deal somewhat with Caribbean history. His work, especially his poetry, is generally complemented by landscape
imagery from the Caribbean.
Walcott has also worked to promote the development of
West Indian theatre, to which he has contributed several plays
including "Henri Christophe," "Dreams and Colours," "Dream
on Monkey Mountain," and many others.
Walcott won the 1992 Nobel Prize for literature. He now
splits his time between his home in Trinidad and his home in
Boston, where he teaches literature at Boston University. A
Harvard College dean, also a colleague of Walcott's commented about Walcott's teaching style in a recent article in The
Chronicle ofHigher Education: His success as a teacher is due
largelyto his ability to develop close personal relationships to
his students, and to 'drive' them to include 'everything in their
lives' in their poetry." Earlier today Walcott displayed this in an
informal poetry workshop for students and faculty.
This evening's event is sponsored by Students of Caribbean
Ancestry (SOCA) and the William J. Cooper Foundation. The
reading is free and open to thepublic.

On-Campus Movies

It's a Good Weekend For a Movie.. .or Two
By

Jonathan Evans & Jessica Keith

Jonathan: Oooh. Theme for the week:
Cool Buddy Flicks.
Jessica: Oh, good Jon. That's the best you
could come up with? How about, "Really
good movies, that you might not have thought
of seeing but you really should, especially
when you are stressed from finals, because
they'll make you happy" weekend.
Jonathan: Uh...right. Anyway, there is no
true theme for this weekend. Guess movie
committee just gave up. Ticks me off. Either
do themes, or don't. Geez!
Jessica: Both movies for this weekend are
first-rate, so I can't complain that much.
Jonathan: Oh, I'm sure you could. Okeedokee.. ."Toy Story." If you haven't seen this
movie, you haven't seen modern-day animation.This is the first fully computer animated
feature movie. Now I know you Luddites out
there are probably going, "Oh God! What
happened to good old animation? Even
claymation? 'Nightmare Before Christmas,'
and 'Akira,' is what modern pop-animation
is all about!" Well, you can absolutely hate
computers and even just animation in general, and still love this movie. This was just a
great movie, for all ages. The script even had
great lines like, "The word I'm searching for,
I can't say, because there's preschool toys
present." This movie is a must-see.
You have to love this movie. I can't think
of anything to DISLIKE about it. The cast is
even well-done. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen
play the lead toys, rivals for a young boy's
affection. Voices for other toys are done by
John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin), Wallace
Shawn ("Inconceivable" guy from Princess
Bride), Don Rickles, Annie Potts, Jim Varney
("Ernest"), etc. See if you can guess who's
who.
Okay, the plot. Toys come to life when
humans leave the room. If you can't accept
that, don'tbother coming to this movie. The
movie begins with Woody (Tom Hanks) as
leader, and lovable favorite Cowboy toy of a

kid named Andy. It's Andy' s birthday, though,
and he gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen). So, the jealous Woody arranges a
little accident for Buzz. When the other toys
realize this, they turn on Woody. So Woody
has to get Buzz back before Andy's family
moves, in order to save face with the other
toys. This leads to an adventure for Buzz and
Woody that only toys could experience in the
world outside of a bedroom (I actually don't
mean to imply anything with this, for once).
See this movie. If not now, then for fun on
your own (although I have to say seeing the

animation
on a big
is
screen
It's
Kuool).
an all-time,
all-time.

Jessica:
Okay, next
movie. Well,
after the violence of last
week's movies, "The
Brothers
,«hh^^^b
McMullen,"-is a refreshing change. Edward
Burns 11,the 27 year-old who wrote, directed,
and starred in the movie, describes it well,
"I'm writing about people I know," he says,
"they do not cut off people's ears." Yes, this
movie is a down-to-earth, realistic portrayal
of daily life. It's about love, religion, relationships, and family, in a very poignant way
that makes you say, "Yeah, I've felt like that
too!"
"The Brothers McMullen," is the story of
three Irish-Catholic brothers: Jack, Patrick,
and Barry. Patrick finishes college, Barry
breaks up with his girlfriend, and both end up
living in their childhood home in Long Island
with Jack and his wife Molly. The three
brothers face various relationship problems.
Jack has an affair and suffers mucho guilt.
Patrick, the most stridently Catholic of the
three, breaks up with his long-time Jewish

girlfriend instead of marrying her, and finds
a new side ofhimself with an old high school
friend, Leslie. Barry, a struggling screenwriter who is deathly afraid of commitment,
finds himself trying to choose between his
newly successful career and the beautiful
Audrey with whom he has fallen in love.
These three plot lines are all tied together by
the common bond of brothers who care about
each other and try to help each other as best
they can.
It's a simple movie. The actors are all
decent, but nothing spectacular. Seamus
Egan's Irish
music is also
simple, but
very beautiThe
ful.

$24,000
movie was
shot on weekends and was
virtually unknown until it
won the 1995
Sundance
Film Festival.
And, this movie was, without a doubt, one the
best I've seen in a long while. For some, this
movie may seem too "real life" and hence not
interesting enough. But I liked this simplicity—nothing flashy, just good solid plot and
dialogue. When Patrick wondered, "What am
I going to do with my life? You know, I didn't
think college was actually going to end,"
man, I knew where he was coming from.
Most of all, watching, "The Brothers
McMullen," just made me feel good.
Oh, one more thing: stickaround at the end.
There's an awesome Sarah McLaughlin song
that's not on any of her albums during the
credits. Excellent.
Jonathan: Mmm. Sarah. A great movie,
with a song by Sarah. Just fulfilledmy weekend. Hope it does the same for you folk.
Jessica: If the Swarthmore slump has hit
you, you've got two great options for escape!

Off-Campus Movie

"Flirting With Disaster" Hilariously Zany
By

Mel

lan Bricke

and Nancy Coplin (Ben Stiller
and
Patricia
Arquette,
respectively), young New York etymologists, don't know what to name their
newborn child. Nancy suggests Ethan. Mel,
adopted as a baby, suggests that they track
down his real parents. Maybe they'll have a
suggestion. Mel enlists the services of adoption agent, psychology grad student, and exdancerTina Kalb (TeaLeoni). Neither Nancy
nor Mel's adoptive parents (Mary Tyler Moore
and George Segal) are particularly enthusiastic about this little junket, not to mention
Tina's participation. But Mel thinksthe search
will do him a great deal of good. Meeting his
real parents might help him work through a
few of his various neuroses. His problems
with oral sex, for example.
So begins David O. Russell's "Flirting
With Disaster," the quirkiest American comedy in years. The quest for Mel's real parents
leads Mel, Nancy, Tina, and the as-yet-unnamed baby on an epic journey across
America: from San Diego to Detroit to a
house somewhere in the New Mexico mountains. Along the way, Mel will bounce in and
out of lust with Tina, Nancy will be reunited
with an old high-school friend (Josh Brolin),
a United States Post office will be destroyed,
vast quantities ofLSD will be consumed, and
three different sets of parents, real and notso-real, will be auditioned (the adoption

agency's records are wildly inaccurate).
"Flirting With Disaster" is almost militantly zany, hurtling with manic energy from
bizarre set-piece to bizarre set-piece. Russell,
who made an impressive debut with the very
Oedipal "Spanking the Monkey," has a wonderful way with comic dialogue, bringing to
mind the best work of Woody Allen and
Andrew Bergman, with a dash of Quentin
Tarantino thrown in for good measure. His
characters talk nonstop, kvetching about everything from support bras to the Grateful
Dead, returning time and time again to the
timeless themes of sex (in all of its varieties)
and truck-driving. This has to be the funniest
screenplay since "The Freshman," and Russell
directs it with unobtrusive flair, including a
lot of faux-documentary hand-held
camerawork.
His all-star cast rips into this material with
obvious gusto. Ben Stiller is considerably
less annoying here than he was in his own
"Reality Bites," doing a passable Woody
Allen impersonation as Mel is confronted
with his supposed Finnish-Scottish-American heritage. Patricia Arquette brings a nicely
skewed sense oftiming to therelatively thankless role of Nancy. Tea Leoni is sensational as
the disturbingly chic Tina, whose mental
health is precarious, at best. But "Flirting
With Disaster" belongs to its supporting cast.
Mary Tyler Moore steals scene after scene,
flashing herbreasts at an alarmed Mel, threatening her food-phobic husband with an enor-

mous hunk of brie, and fuming through a
New Mexico jail. As the husband, George
Segal wallows in neurosis, to great effect (it
helps that Segal has an inherently funny face,
probably one of the funniest in all of Hollywood). As the Schlictings, Mel's real real
parents, die-hard (and acid-damaged) ex-hippies, Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda make
Russell's dialogue positively crackle, even as
their supremely strange younger son (Glenn
Fitzgerald) does diabolical things to the
braised quail.
Nancy' s old high school flame (Josh Brolin)
turns out to be half of a spectacularly semifunctional gay couple, both of whom turn out
to be federal agents. As the other half of this
couple, the erstwhile and much put-upon
Paul, Richard Jenkins is a comic miracle. In
a movie crammed with deliriously eccentric
characters, Jenkins' Paul is the stand-out, one
of the funniest bits of character acting that
I've ever seen.
"Flirting With Disaster" isn't quite perfect.
The soundtrack, featuring everyone from Dr.
John to Urge Overkill, is haphazardly utilized, and the first ten or so minutes are
presented in a remarkably confusing fashion.
More significantly, Russell's pacing is just
slightly too slow—he's more interested in
observing these characters than going for big
comic points. But that's perfectly understandable. The company of these lunatics, played
with such relish and such exuberance, is an
utterly original treat, not to be missed.

Music Preview

Saturday Night at the Olde Club
By Greg Ingber

Music

is a good thing. Live music is a
good thing. There is live music this
Saturday night at the Olde Club.
Thus, it seems pretty certain that being at the
Olde Club this Saturday night is a good thing.
That being said, I suppose I might as well
pad my way through the rest of this manifesto
with a short description of what you can
expect to see at Saturday's concert. The four
bands —DQE, Mecca Normal, 2Foot Flame,
and the Bunnybrains—will be playing their
various instruments in various styles and with
various degrees of technical prowess. DQE,
for instance, consists of a singer/guitarist and
a drummer. They play a bouncy, twangy,
variety of stripped down rock 'n roll. This
group blends elements of old-school country
and blues with the sheer grooviness offifties'
rock. I suppose you could even dance to it if
such behavior was within the "morals of your
decency." DQE, in the fine tradition of the
comedic style of Sally Struthers, should be a
seriously entertaining live act.
Mecca Normal and 2 Foot Flame will also
be gracing the embarrassingly minute stage
of the Olde Club. It has been rumored that
these two bands contain most of the same
musicians. Considering this, I am inclined to
believe these bands made an excellent choice

•

ARTS

when they decided to tour together. I have
had the opportunity to listen to 2 FootFlame's
self-titled Matador release. This band's music is hard-edged and rhythmic without ever
degenerating to meaningless noise. 2FF also
manages to slip in a few quiet songs, mainly
dominated by delicate, melodic piano and
keyboard phrases. This is band is a must-hear
for all fans of alien abduction, a very real
phenomenon which is featured prominently
in their lyrics!
Finally, the Bunnybrains! Some less enlightened music listeners may think that the
Bunnybrains sound like two eels asphyxiating in a bucket ofmucus. I, for one, disagree.
This band plays outrageous, bizarre, and often psychotic music, but they always do it
with a sense of humor. Although the music is
frequently noisy, the music is well supported
by a surprisingly solid rhythm section. Do not
befooled... thefolks in Bunnybrains really do
know how to play their instruments! By all
means, find out for yourself.
At this point, I think I have rattled on
sufficiently so that I can conclude without
shame. This Saturday: Olde Club. Free admittance pays for the whole seat but you'll
only need the edge!!! Seriously, this show is
going to be very much worth seeing... and
there is a distinct possibility of free
Pathmark™ soda if you show up!

Out and About

A Visit to Tom Jones' Diner
By

Nothing

John Freeman

can sop up weekend debauchery or late night anxiety like griddle
grease and buttermilk, both of which
can be found in abundance at Tom Jones'
Diner on route 420.
Whether it's a BLT, steak and potatoes, or
the traditional late night pulmonary kamikaze into pork fat and maple syrup, Tom
Jones will deliver 24 hours a day with speedy
service and low tabs. My favorite time to visit
is during the after-church hours or after 1 a.m.
on a weekend night.
After church, all the locals come in late
model Buicks and Oldsmobiles to rehash
their pastor's sermon over a variety of coronary-inducing staples of the overfed American diet—football-sized omelettes, stacks of
french toast, pigs in a blanket, and the very
famous Tom Jones' Blue Ribbon special.
For $2.79, you get three pancakes, eggs
(done your way), sausage patties, coffee,
juice, and toast. If you don't give proper
warning, your toast will come buttered with
enough dairy fat to lube up a moving van for
a cross-country haul. The pancakes are light
and fluffy and achieve that authentic diner
taste when you ladle the synthetic maple
syrup on after every bite. The juice comes in
one of those half shot-sized glasses, as if to
remind you that you're not there for your
health. While the coffee isn't gourmet, it can
rejuvenate your personality in the wee hours
of the morning.
Tom Jones is best enjoyed en masse; it's
fun to pile into one of those vinyl booths
which are always a bit cold and a shade too
bright for the night owl's sensibilities. I always overestimate my party so that I can be
ensured one ofthe wraparound booths against
the window.

At night, it is also fun to sample one ofTom
Jones' cheap and tasty milkshakes; they come
in all traditional flavors plus some specialty
such as Snickers, Barney-Crunch, and my
favorite—Rocky Road. I always like the challenge of keeping my eyes averted from the
habitual drunk thick necks looking for fights.
There is something voluptuous about sipping
down a chocolate shake and taking in the
tension of all the contained testosterone of
Delaware County adolescents eager to prove
theirmanhood to their girl and the rest ofthe
late night crowd.
Some items to avoid on the menu are the
rather anemic-looking french fries and dry
carrot cake, heart-rending disappointments
when the spirits are low. The turkey club and
ice-cream sundae make an excellent lunchtime feast for around five dollars.
In comparison to Denny's, IHOP, and the
RWay Dinner (located on the Baltimore Pike
across from Borders), Tom Jones has the best
hours and lowest prices. Take a chance and
patronize this family restaurant one late night
with friends and you'll be rewarded with a
fatter wallet and that deep tranquil sleep only
grease can give.

How to Get There:
Travel down 320 and take a right
on Yale. Follow Yale down the hill
as it forks left under the overpass of
476. At the first light take a right on
ProvidenceRoad—travel 100 meters
and fork left. Travel two miles; at the
first light, take a right and travel 200
yards and it will be on the left.

Swarthmore Men's Tennis Women's Ultimate Frisbee
FUNKENGRÜVEN: AN ODE
Qualifies for Nationals
By

The Tennis Team

On a blustery April afternoon the
highly respected Trenton State men's
tennis team paid the $2 toll across the
Walt Whitman bridge fromNew Jersey and met the Garnet on the Ed
Faulkner Tennis Courts. Four hours
later Trenton was on its way home
victims of a 7-0 defeat.
Swarthmore took all doubles and
singles matches, including a win by
Barry Mook' 96 over Trenton's Eastern Rolex winner Mark Wallace 6-2,
3-6, 6-4. Ed Ernst '9B, at fourth
singles, won the day's most exciting
mate over Trenton's Phil Stevenson
in the final set tie-breaker.
Saturdays match-up with SUNYBinghamton, again on the home
courts, brought together two nationally ranked teams and the number 2
(Bingamton) and 4 (Swarthmore)
ranked teams in the Northeast region
ofNCAA Division 111.
Swarthmore again won the doubles
point with the steady play ofnumber
three John Derdarian '97 and Greg
Emkey '99 and the improved play of
number two Nick Slimack '99 and
Ernst. The day's heroics, however,
belonged to Swarthmore's third
singles player, Roger Werner '9B,
who defeated Ron Sussman in three
tight sets, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. The match
turned on an official's overule of
Sussman' s out call which gave Roger

match point. Werner served the last
point out and was lifted onto the
shoulders of appreciative students
shouting "ole\ ole\"
OnSunday, Rochester and Swarthmore met for the 18th consecutive
year in men's tennis. This time the
match belonged to Swarthmore. Behind 2-7 in doubles with Rochester
needing one more gamefor the match,
Emkey and Derdarian pulled off an
amazing comeback to take the match
and give Swarthmore a one-point
cushion in doubles. Mook also had an
impressive win over Ethan Morris of
Rochester 6-4,7-5 and steady George
Khalaf '96 won again at second
singles over Oscar Martin 6-3, 6-2.
Derdarian added his point in singles
winning his 10th match of the season
without losing.
It's often difficult to get a reaction
from Garnet coach Mike Mullan but
he could be overheard actually praising the team for their three wins.
However, he was also heard to warn
against complacency and over-confidence before the all-important Haverford match!
Winning these three matches
bumps the Garnet up to the third seed
in the NCAA regionals to be held in
Bingamton, NY. Williams and
Amherst are the top seeds. Remaining on the men's schedule is Haverford at home on Tuesday and
Princeton, Penn and Bloomsburgh.

Drops Season Finale

There once was a team from Swarthmore
Their roster was big but could only get four
To join the Earthworms on a trip to VA

They met at the fieldhouse to load up the van.
But were halted by the uttering of their captain: "Oh, man."
Photographs of the discovered large dent were taken
Yet responsible Lena was still badly shaken.
The players were soon on their way.
It was only an hour and half delay!
Arriving at W&M shortly after 2,

Swarthmore!

By George Matula

In an emotionally charged atmosphere Swarthmore College took the
court against a tough, experienced
Philadelphia College of the Bible
team. Because it was the last game of
the season, the team was determined
to win. However, the talent of the
Bible team proved too much for the
young Garnet..
The energy in the air was evident
from the very outset of the match: the
fans were cheering and the Garnet
bench was off their feet yelling and

screaming in support of the team.
Dave O'Brien '96, playing his last

Jill Eaton

home game as a Swarthmore volleyball player, hit extremely well to start
the match. However, it seemed that
all the energy in the air made the team
tense and anxious for they lost three
quick points due to bad passes.
The talent of the opposing team
was evident from the outset. They
had two extremely good hitters, and
their deceptive plays allowed them to
hit without effective blocks. Despite
all of their positive energy, the Garnet lost the first game 15-5.

Evil Buzzards Ruck
Over Shippensburg
By

Andrew Caffrey

Swarthmore Men's Rugby handily
defeated Shippensburg last Saturday
by the margin of 27-5. Shippensburg
Rugby Club was Swarthmore's strongest opponent thus far, known for
their fearsome back lines, which had
earned them a number two spot in the
union last season. The Evil Buzzards
dominated them.
"We thought thatShippensburg was
going to be a tough
team," said hooker
Tony Sturm '99, "but
we were ready for
them and came out
strong. The play of the
backs was impressive.They put together
an almost flawless

game."

Swarthmore struck
often and early, and
had the game won by
half time. The first try was scored
fifteen minutes into the game after a
great display of skill by the back line.
After the whole line was able to get
the ball out wide to wing Dan Barrick
'9B, Barrick was able to pop kick it
downfield.The kick was caught by
Guy Danilowitz '96, who pulled it
away from the opposing back, and
touched down by Ricky Philips '96.
The Evil Buzzard's lineouts have
become their most potent weapon,
leading to three trieslast week against
Millersville, and another this week,
put in by Jason Dougal '96 three
minutes after the first try. Soon after,
some fine agressive play by Jason
Sturm 97 on his opposing scrum half

set up a try by the younger Sturm of

of a ruck. He caught the ball in the
back line and got by three defenders
for the score. Danilowitz's conversion gave Swarthmore a 19-0 lead to
end the first half.
The second halfstarted slowly for
the Evil Buzzards, until a Danilowitz
penalty kick extended their lead
Shortly after this penalty
Shippensburg got on the scoreboan
by scoring a try in the corner.
Swarthmore continued to put the
pressure on, and
five minutes before
the final whistle
they were rewarded
Danilowitz managed to take out two
defending players
while passing off to
Adam Blescia '97
who streaked 30
yards downthe sideline and scored an amazing flying try
A depleted B-side, with a new forward pack, was outplayed by a more
seasoned side. Although many tries
were scored against the Swarthmore
second team, the game was wel
played.
Shippensburg
Swarthmore

"The team wanted to win so badly
that we impaired our play by being so
excited." said co-captain Dylan
Humphrey '9B. "We all wanted to
win for our three seniors." The team
ended up falling 7-15 in the third, and

final, set.
The team finished with a 4-6 record,
a great improvement over last year's
one-win season. They are looking
forward to next year as a promising
season.

Although they had to drive six hours
and then sleep in Mephistos the night
before the game, the Wellesley
women's rugby team played well and
claimed two victories in last
Saturday's game. It was the first Aside Swarthmore loss this season. The
A-side was defeated 12-7 and the Bside 15-5.
"Our rucks weren't nearly as good
as they were in our past games" said
Kelly Shannon '96. The forwards
hesitated a little too long when going
into rucks and formed a few too many
train rucks, rather than binding in
evenly.
One thing that did seem to work
well for the team was the line-outs.
Trying a new tactic learned this week
in practice, the one and three players,
Margaret Cohen '96 and Annie Bacon '99, claimed the tunnel by stepping into it just as the ball was thrown
in. They bound and rucked in front of
the jumper instead of behind her.
The size match-up in the scrums
was very unequal. The Wellesley
props were quite a bit bigger than
Swarthmore's props. Although
Swarthmore's scrums were much
stronger in the second half of the
game, in the first half they did get
driven back quite a bit. But, when the
team sunk low enough, they were
able to lock against Wellesley' s drive
more effectively.
"We dominated them in the second
half ofthe game" said Rebecca Cole
'96. The second half, Swarthmore
really did play its own kind of game.
The backs did a great job of support-

ing each other in the lines and the
scrums showed improvement.
The game was altogether not extremely clean, as Hanan Hussein '97
discovered when she was punched
while still on the ground after a ruck
by one of Wellesley's flankers. She
had to get four stitches. Hussein was
replaced by Leora Cohen McKeon
'9B who right away made some great
tackles, as Swarthmore continued to
fight hard. Amidst the pinching and
punching Swarthmore did manage to
keep itself up and in the lead 7-5 until
literally the last minute of the game.
After two line-outs at the five meter
mark in front of Wellesley's try zone,
thereferee called a penalty on Swarthmore, after which Wellesley was allowed to move to the center of the
field, at the five meter mark. They
then proceeded to cover the distance
and score a try before anyone really
realized what was going on. After the
conversion kick went through the
uprights, the game ended abruptly,
much to Swarthmore's disappointment.

As usual, the Swarthmore B-side
had to play against mostly A-side
players. However they did manage to
play well and were only defeated by
two tries, 15-5. Lisa Hilgendorf '99
played an extraordinary game. She
made a fifty meter run off of a kickoff, and proceeded to break away

down the field, dodging tacklers to
score her first try.
Now that Pippin is over, and four
members of the team are able to practice again, the team hopes to be a bit
stronger with a full squad this Saturday when they play at York.

Unfortunately, the game didn't
improve for the Garnet. The Bible's
powerful hitting was just too much.
They played as if they really did have
God on their side. John Voss '96 and
Benjamin Heuston '96 both played
extremely well in the second set. However, their good play was not enough,
as the Garnet fell 7-15.
The third set was more of the same

Gehlbach

An extended string of matches in
the past week has the women's tennis
team feeling exhausted and somewhat dejected. Last Thursday, the
team suffered a decisive defeat to the
powerful women of Trenton State, 09. With a number one player who
could have bench-pressed the entire
Swat team, intimidation was not an
irrelevantfactor in the match. Though
Swarthmore battled impressively in
the unpleasantly windy conditions,
no one was able to pull out a win.
The beautiful weather on Saturday, however, did little to improve
the women's match against Dickinson . After a controversy over the starting time of the match left the Garnet
players with no time to warm up and,
in several cases, rather bitter, Swarthmore fell to Dickinson 2-7.
At first doubles, Hilary Gehlbach
'96 and Michelle Martinez '97 suffered a tragic loss, losing 7-9 in their
pro-set. Neena Shenai '9B and Rani
Shankar '9B, however, pulled out a
win at second doubles with a score of
8-2. Shenai was also the sole singles
winner of the day, defeating her opponent 6-2, 6-3 at fourth singles. Playing at third singles, Shankar fought a
tough match, but eventually lost in a
tiebreaker, 6-1,7-6(7-5).
Tuesday brought the team to Muhlenberg, this time with a significantly
weakened line-up. While it was anticipated that Martinez and Shankar
would be absent, ElenaRosenbaum' s
'9B pre-match ankle-spraining left
the teamwith only five players to
travel west. With Rosenbaum's absence, the team began the match with
a 2-0 deficit. Further frustration set in
as the team struggled to adjust to
another indoor surface and to cope
with an umpire who was visually
challenged; Swarthmore was defeated
by a score of 3-6. Gehlbachand Shenai
partnered up for the first time to form
the #1 doubles team, pulling out a
win, 8-2. Shenai then crushed her
opponent at second singles, 6-1,6-0.
Wendy Kemp '99 scored the third
point for Swarthmore, downing her
opponent 6-4, 6-2. Gehlbach came
close to a victory at first singles but
finally fell 7-5, 6-4.
The Garnet Tide plays their last
two matches next week. On Monday,
the women travel to Johns Hopkins;
Wednesday will see the archrival
Fords showing up on Swarthmore's
home turf to end the season.

"The heavier therainstorm, the bigger the rainbow when it's over" was
the message Coach Karen Borbee
sent to her players before the Ursinus
game. The women's lacrosse team
has dropped three of its last five decisions, resulting in a (6-3) record. Having lost an important conference game
to Johns Hopkins, the team members
collected themselves to face the nationally fifth-ranked team, the Ursinus
Bears, in a rain-postponed contest on
Thursday, April 11. Then they encountered two more conference rivals, the Gettysburg Bullets and the
Muhlenberg Mules, the following
week.
Before the Ursinus game, co-captain Lara Ewens '96 stressed the importance of the team increasing communication on the field and playing
"as a team instead of as individuals."

3:30 p.m. vs Ursinus

The men's track team of Johns
Hopkins showed up last Saturday on
Skallerup track for the annual dual
meet with Swarthmore. Swarthmore
soundly spanked Hokpins and sent
them back home to Baltimore, ending the scoring season with a 16-1
record.
Swarthmore Coach Ted Dixon
knew how weak Hopkins' team was
and used that fact to give his athletes
a more relaxing day at the races.
Mike Turner '96, for instance, sacrificed sure first-place points in the
200 meters and 400 meters to try his
hand at an 800 meters, while four
long-distance men stepped up to give
our women's team a race in the
4xloom.
Despite the huge loss of potential
points from moves like this,
Swarthmore still won the meet by 20
points. Hopkins did manage to salvage a sliver of pride only through a
solid performances from their one
good sprinter, Zaki Alam, and their
throws squad.
Sam Paschel '96, Brian Baird '99,
and Shan Sutherland '97 went 1-2-3
in the pole vault, with Sutherland
doubling up to take second in the
long jump behind Eric Pakurar '97.
Pakurar then won the triple jump.
Benj Heuston '96 did well to take
second in the high jump to Ryan
Bobko of Hopkins, a national qualifier in the event.
It's rumored that Hopkins picks up
members of their football team specifically to bolster their throws squad
for this dual meet. True or not,

Men's Lacrosse
Pat

rallied back and outscored the Bears
6-1, to take a 6-3 lead. As momentum
of the game shifted back and forth
between Swarthmore and Ursinus,
the teams entered half-time with an
8-6 Swarthmore lead. The Ursinus
Bears tied the Garnet within the first
ten minutes of the second half and
thus gained momentum and control
of the game.
With six minutes left in the game,
Ursinus took the lead. The Lady Garnet fought back with 11 seconds left
on the clock, when Jen Hagan '99
scored the tying goal to send the
game into overtime. In the first overtime (there are two 3minuteovertimes
in women's lacrosse), the Bears were
able to capitalize on what Coach
Borbee described as a "...questionable shooting space call." After that
goal, the Bears stalled the game with
the neutral zone trap made famous by
ice hockey players Roger Neilson
and Jacques Lemaire. The game
ended with Ursinus 12 and
Swarthmore 11.

In that loss, the Lady Garnet saw
the superior performance of several
players. In addition to the goal that
sent the game into overtime, Hagan
contributed seven of the team's 56
interceptions. One of her teammates
had commented on Hagan's great
abilities to block, check and control
draws. Kelly Wilcox '97 had a superb defensive game, where she created two turnovers and collected one
block and 12 interceptions. Lia Ernst
'97 had a marvelous game both offensively and defensively. She
scored five goals out of six chances,
assisted on one goal, made three
blocks and eight interceptions. Said
her teammate, Danielle"Thomas'99,
"Lia's got crazy skills and she makes
it [lacrosse] look easy."
The following game, against
Gettysburg' s Bullets, featured a rather
flat Swarthmore team. The Garnet
took a quick 2-1 lead but allowed the
Bullets to outscore them 6-1 in the
first half. By the second half, the
Garnet, who were able to garner a 7-

7 tie, seemed to have surrendered
underthe Bullets'pressure and ended
the game with a 15-9 loss. Afterwards, Thomas commented that "right
now we just have to channel
everyone's skillsand potential so that
it is all focused and going in the same
direction, toward the same goal."
Having three straight losses, the
Garnet faced the Mules of
Muhlenberg. With more than the will
and desire to end their downward
slide, the Lady Garnet were able to
crush the Mules 18-8. In this game,
the Mules used three different goalies versus Swarthmore's one, Jill
Maybee'96. (Back-up goalie Jaclyn
Coutts '99 was injured.) The Lady
Garnet scored 18 goals on 30 attempts. Seven of these goals came
from Holly Baker' 99, whom one of
teammate has described as having
"hard, accurate shooting abilities."
Defensively, the Garnet had a spectacular game: they collected 24 more
interceptions and interceptions than
the Mules did (81-57). Having expe-

rienced their first losing streak of the
season, the Lady Garnet should be
more determined than ever to win all
their remaining games.

Swarthmore continued its downward spiral this week by dropping
two games against conference opponents Dickinson and Washington. The
Garnet (2-8, 0-4 in the conference),
have now lost five in a row after an
impressive start. Coach Gress is still
optimistic heading into the final week
of the season, however, citing the
fact that the men never give up and
play hard for all sixty minutes of
every game.
Last Saturday, the Garnet had their
best chance at a conference win to
date as they hosted
Dickinson College.
The teams were
evenly matched as

conference officials
predicted an extremely close game.
Although
Dickinson held the
lead from the beginning, it wasn't until
the final minute that
the game was put
away.
The tone of the game was set in the
first minutes of the opening quarter.
The Garnet controlled the ball for
most of the time, rifling a multitude
of shots at the Dickinson goalie, but
were unable to find the back of the
net. Meanwhile, Dickinson relied on
a quick offense which used picks on
the crease to open up the scoring.
Even though the Garnet was controlling the game, Dickinson took control of the scoreboard. The Red Devils took a 5-2 lead into halftime, shocking those present at the gamebecause
of the huge number of shots the Garnet were able to make.
In the second half, Swarthmore saw
more of the same. Dickinson kept
piling up the points by feeding the

J.

crease. Even the zone defense highly
regarded by the Swarthmore didn't
throw offthe Dickinson offensemuch.
But with seven minutes left in the
game, the Garnet got a break. The
score was 10-7 at the time, and the
Garnet offense was finally getting
shots past the Dickinson keeper. The
referee called a penalty on the opponents for leaving the penalty area too
early. The ref added three more minutes to the clock and gave Swarthmore
a man-up advantage. The Garnet
could not capitalize on the huge break
and ended up on the losing end of a
12-7 score. Dave Sturtevant '96, Pat
Donaghy
'9B,
Adam Macßeth
'99, Erik Griffin
'96, Will Craig

'96,BenSeigel'96
and Andy Place
'96 all figured in
the offense for
Swarthmore.
On Wednesday,

Swarthmore
hosted #4 ranked
Washington, a
team likely to advance to the NCAA final four this
year. As one would assume, the game
ended in a blowout as Washington
was just too much for the
undermanned Garnet to handle, ending in a 20-2 score. The Garnet never
gave up, and received praise from
both the referees and Washington
coaches for their efforts. Seniors
Kevin Frazer and Ben Seigel scored
the Garnet goals.
Seigel has been playing extremely
well this year and is second in the
conference in assists with 18 and is
ninth among league scorers in overall
games. Next week, the Garnet travel
to Gettysburg and Widener before
the all-important final duel against
Haverford at home next Saturday.

S warthmoredid well to take the points
they did. Eric Walton '97 took second in the discus with a personal best
of 121 feet, and first in the javelin,
with Chris Fowler '97 taking third.
In a picturesque display of teamwork, Scott Reents '96 captured first
place in the 1500 meters with a time
of 4:05. Wyn Strotdbeck '9B was
close on his shoulder in second place,
with an all-time personal record of
4:06. Fred Gerson '99 put on the
finishing touches, coming in fourth
at 4:16.7.
Hopkins runners found themselves
setting foot into a veritable oceattol
Garnet for the 800 meters. Reents
placed first for the second time that
day at 2:00, while close on his heels
were JohnFreeman '96, Eric Pakurar
'97, Gordon Roble '99, and Tim
Sibley '9B, going 3-4-5-6, respectively. Turner iced the cake with
eighth place, followed a second later
by Nevin Katz '99 in ninth.
Al Molnar '97 had a huge day in
the hurdles, winning both the 110
meters high hurdles and the 400
meters intermediate hurdles against
the Hopkins competition.
Baird and Giovi Grasso-Knight '97
took the top two spots in the open 100
meters, Baird winning in 12.04 seconds. Baird went on to take second in
the open 200 meters, with Walid
Gellad '97 coming third. Paschel and
Reuben Canada '99 also took second
and third spots respectively in the
open 400 meters.
Rounding out the day, Swarthmore
easily won the two relay races:
Grasso-Knight, Turner, Baird, and
Canada in the 4xloo meters relay,
while Pakurar, Paschel, Canada, and
Turner finished the meet with a win
in the 4x400 meters.
Though there aren't any more scoring meets this season, Swarthmore
will be seen at the Widener Invitational this weekend, and then at the
biggest meet on the east coast, the
Penn Relays, the following weekend.

Hordes of students, Including Roger Bock '99 (center), Carl Wellington '99 (with hat) and Carl Helberg
'96 (right), as well as more than a few prospectlves visiting campus for the weekend, ran In the McCabe
Mile on Sunday night. The annual race consists of 17 laps around the library basement. The victor, Scott
Reents '96, won a roll of toiletpaper; the prize honors Thomas McCabe 'l5, the Scott Paper executive for
whom the library Is named.

Allentown Slips by Softball Team

This week, women's softball faced
a wide variety of skill levels in both
conference and non-conference play.
While the losses keep rolling in, the
team is closing in on a win as players
are becoming more comfortable in
their positions and hitting is becoming more consistent.
Friday night, the softball team
hopped on the bus to Allentown to
play Muhlenberg under the lights. It
was a long doubleheader for
Swarthmore as the mostly freshman
Mule team hauled Swarthmore's cart
to the market. Swat only recorded
three errors in the first game, but

Women's Track Conquers
Bryn Mawr, Hopkins
By Betsy Davis

Alison Schirmer

The women's track and field team
ran away with this week's meet
against Bryn Mawr and Johns
Hopkins, extending their undefeated
season. Inspired by the good weather
and groovy tunes, they pulled away
with great times and distances despite the scant competition.
The women zipped through the
sprinting events, with Stephanie Herring '99 taking second in the 100
meters, and Danielle Duffy '9B winning the 200 meters with Catherine
Laine' 98 finishing a close second. In
the 400 meters, Laine finished first in
blazing time. Betsy Davis '96 took
second in both the 100 meter and 400
meter hurdle races.
In the middle and long distances,
Donna Griffin '99 ran a fantastic 800
meters, followed by hordes of quickfooted harriers. Alison Schirmer '97
was nudged out of first place in the
final stretch of the 1500meters thanks
to a rambunctious stomach virus.And
in the lengthiest race of the day,
Danielle Wall' 98 blew away the competition in the 3000 meters to grab
first place.
Swat women dominated the field
events as well. Herring and Laine
scared off the competition to win the
long and triple jumps, respectively.
In the javelin, Heather Mateyak '97
placed second, Lucy Hunt '96 placed
fourth, with Amy Cuthrell '97 in fifth.

Muhlenberg's consistently powerful
hits gave them the 8-1 win. In the
second game, Swarthmore had as
many hits as errors (five) but the tight
Muhlenberg defense never let them
score and the team was shut out by a
score of 15-0.
On a beautiful Saturday afternoon,
the Garnet faced Franklin and
Marshall in the best conference
matchup all season, but it was sloppy
defense that gave F&M the wins.
Swarthmore recorded more hits in
both games, but key errors in the field
allowed the Diplomats to dominate
all day with7-2 and 8-2 wins. Pitcher/
Captain Dana Lehman '9B showed
offensive aggressiveness by batting
four for six in the doubleheader. in
addition to her fierce and consistent—or should I say constant?— pitching.
But theschedule did not stop there.
The team went back to Allentown on
Monday to face Allentown College.
Captain Vanessa Motto '96 said, "It
really worries an infielder when a
pop fly is hit, and they see an outfielder circling their position with
their gloves in the air." Despite the
wind, the outfield was errorless in
this single game—a feat which had

Baseball Brief

The women throwers also placed in
the top four in the discus, with
Mateyak taking first. The projectile
triple crown was rounded out with
Mateyak again taking first in the shot
put, followed by her teammates.
Finally, the 4xloo meters relay
team, composed of Duffy, Herring,
Laine, and Davis, ran swiftly, finishing second only to a team composed
ofSwat distance men. The same team
later outdistanced a challenge from
Johns Hopkins to win the 4x400
meters relay.
This weekend, the women's track
and field team faces much tougher
competition at Widener University
against such powerhouses as
Villanova. Adding to the week's excitement, the relay teams will be travelling to the 101st Penn Relays next
Thursday. The women eagerly await
their return to the home field for the
Centennial Conference Championship, May 4 and 5.

Swarthmore scored 14 runs in
the bottom of the 6th inning to
come back from a 13-5 deficit
and defeat Muhlenberg on Tuesday. Frank Santora '96 and Rob
Mascia '96 had four RBl's apiece
for Swat.

Allentown had no earned runs while
Swat had three.For once, Swarthmore
outhit their error count with six hits
and four errors.
All in all it was a tough weekend
for the Garnet.Lehman got the chance
to beef upher position as leader in the
conference in innings pitched. Athletic Director Bob Williams asked
the question, "Dana, do you have a
pitching rotation something like the
baseball team?" Lehman's only reply was "What's a pitching rotation?"
Offensively, the star this weekend
has to be Mollie Davis '96, who
racked up an impressive .461 batting
average on Friday and Saturday.
Unfortunately, she was not able to
appear against Allentown.
There is bad news as well for
Swarthmore softball. Rookie Nette
Witgert's '97 defensive momentum
was stopped abruptly in the game
against Allentown as she broke her
right distal metacarpal in an impressive dive to third. It should heal
quickly, but not in time to appear
before the season ends.

No Mascot

After All
"No mascot" was the winner in the second round of
Swarthmore's mascot election, with a comfortable
majority of 58 percent, the
College announced yesterday in the Weekly News.
More than three quarters
of on-campus voters
checked "no mascot" on
their ballots.
Off-campus voters also
