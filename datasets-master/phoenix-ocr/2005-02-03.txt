Parrish construction faces minor setbacks
Residents required to vacate rooms temporarily because of unexpected structural work
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW

bbradlol@swarthmore.edu

The schedule for construction on Parrish ran into
some roadblocks over winter break. As a result, two
students had to evacuate their rooms yesterday and
Tuesday for the entire day while dangerous
machines, including cranes, were used for work that
was originally scheduled for during break.
Alexey Rostapshov 'O6, one of the students who
was asked to move, expressed frustration at the
inconveniences caused by the construction. "This is
not what I signed up for," he said.
The students were asked to be out of their rooms
from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Tuesday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
yesterday.
Rostashov, who only moved into his Parrish room
at the beginning of this semester after studying
abroad last semester, said that his experience in his
new room has been less than ideal. "I've only been
here for 17 days and four of those days I couldn't be
in my room," he said, referring to the last two days as
well as two other days within the past three weeks,
when he was asked to vacate his room.
"We have to ask them [the students] to vacate
their rooms when a crane is on-site," Susan Sayer,
project manager for the Parrish renovation, said.
According to Sayer, the construction schedule
was based around certain assumptions about the
architecture of the attic in Parrish that turned out to
be incorrect when work began on the room at the end
of last year. "We discovered structural conditions in
the attic that had to be corrected," she said.
Associate Dean of Student Life Myrt Westphal
said that inconveniences due to the construction
should be expected. "Any time you are living in a construction zone, you know there are going to be glitches," she said.

However, she noted that the evacuation was unexpected. "I don't think any of us expected that [the two

students] would have to evacuate their rooms for a
couple of days," she said.
"It's a nuisance. I hear that. It was what hade to be
done for safe construction practices," Westphal said.
According to Westphal, she notified the two students about three to five days before they were meant
to move. "I just made a suggestion [that the two students move], but I didn't make any formal arrangements for them," she said.
Sanska, the construction company, did not antici-

pate that there would be steelrods around the base of
the attic, which made work in the room harder than
expected. Such work included having to mix concrete
in the attic, with certain materials being lifted into
the room's windows with cranes, according to

Westphal.
"It's a lot of hard work and it takes time," she said.
However, the delays were only temporary, according to Sayer. "Now we're back on track," she said.
Sayer also noted that Sanska has undertaken new
safety precautions in the wake of a small pipe fire
that occurred last semester, as reported in The
Phoenix. "They tightened their procedures for fire
safety when welding and other hot work is done," she

said.

Currently, administrative offices in Parrish are

their new final locations. "There are a lot
of intermediate move dates," Sayer said.
Vice President Larry Schall '75 said the construction has not been hampered by any major delays.
"Most of [the delays] have been standard kinds of
issues," he said.
moving to

According to Schall, funding for the construction
is going according to plan after the donation of a $1
million Kresge challenge grant, which requires the
college to raise an additional $4.6 million to fully
fund the construction. "We certainly expect that
we're going to be able to do it," he said.
Sayer said that construction in Parrish is still
planned to be completed by the fall.

Tutton leaves Dining Services post
trainer when he hired a personal trainer a few years ago.
He was soon training people and working in Dining

BY ERIC MILES GLOVER

egloverl@swarthmore.edu

Dining Services Manager Scott Tutton left Swarthmore
in December to be a personal trainer. Augustine "Gusti"
Ehgertner-Lipp and Jamar Jones were promoted to the
positions of cash operations manager and Sharpies utility
manager to fill the void left by his departure.
Tutton had been working in Dining Services since the
19905.
"In the early 19905, I worked for two years as a manager and catering chef for the contract food service on campus, Morrisons," Tutton said in e-mail. "I left when their
contract expired and [Swarthmore] went self-op," he said,
referring to how Dining Services is independently-run.
Tutton returned to Swarthmore in the late 1990s when
Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall hired him as
Sharpies utility manager. His position grew to include performing accounting duties in his Sharpies office, administering the meal plan and managing cash operations for the

snack and coffee bars.
Tutton was instrumental in changes to both the meal
plan and the campus software provider during his employment in Dining Services.
"We added the 17 meal plan and the off-campus [five]

meal plan," he said.
He was also instrumental in changes to the Essie Mae's
Snack Bar hours of operation among other changes.
But Tutton has always had an interest in sports.
"Sports have always been part of my family and my life,"
he said.
He started giving serious thought to being a personal

After more than a semester of technical difficulties and broadcasting problems, WSRN is set to
begin broadcasting on Monday.
The setbacks started at the beginning of last
semester when the station was forced to move its
offices from the top floor of Parrish, now under
renovation, to the third floor of Parrish North.
The moving process took longer than was anticipated by WSRN general manager Alexander
Flurie 'O5, and the station was unable to begin
broadcasting until Nov. 1

The station then encountered further complications when no sound was being broadcast in the
beginning of that month, a problem that was not
noticed for a week. "We realized we weren't doing
a very good job of building a broadcast studio
from scratch," Flurie said.
To deal with some of these problems, the college
has hired a professional engineer to get the station

off the ground this semester and address further
complications. "We just had him double-check all
the work we did last semester, and if we had a problem we didn't understand, he helped us figure it
out," he said. "He'll be working throughout the
semester on some different projects for us."
The largest of the station's problems have been
associated with the move to Parrish North,
according to program director and chief engineer
Mark Handler 'O5. "The temporary space is not
ideal," he said. "There've been problems with a
kink in the cable from the old studio on Parrish
4th, we've had trouble getting a signal, the overhead lighting is bad, we've had problems with the
lock, and there's a lot of dust from the renovations."
Pro Digital, Inc. engineer Paul Plotnick, hired
to fix the technological problems, agreed that
work was needed to maintain the studio. "The
equipment they were using was certainly not ideal
for broadcasting," he said. "We're working on
refurbishing all the equipment, including the CD

Services at the same time.
"I got a lesser certification and trained people part-time
after work for about two years," he said. "Then I decided to
upgrade to a recognized certification and make it official."

"I'll miss my friends and all of the
free coffee and food!"
Scott Tutton,
former dining services manager
...

Tutton took courses at Temple University and completed home study in preparation for two examinations he
needed to take to receive his American Council of Exercise
certification. He now works at Hatfield Athletic Club in
Hatfield, Pennsylvania, where he enjoys both the work
environment and people.
Tutton described the typical day in the life of a personal trainer as "always changing."
"Each hour is spent with a different client. New clients
start with a health [screening] and fitness evaluation.
Then their trainer will discuss personal goals and design
an exercise program for them. Every client is unique, so is
every program, and thus [so is] every hour of the day," he
said.
Nevertheless, Tutton said he will miss Dining Services.

"I'll miss my friends
food!" he said.
"[Tutton] had a good work ethic and a wonderful sense
of humor with those who reported to him," McDougall
said.
Ehgertner-Lipp and Jones have assumed positions
Tutton originally held.
Ehgertner-Lipp is the new cash operations manager.
Ehgertner-Lipp most recently trained chefs at the
University of Pennsylvania, where she worked for two
years as both a manager and executive sous chef before
being hired three years ago as a Sharpies chef.
She said she enjoys her new position overseeing the
training of employees, the purchase of presentations and
the budget.
"I have to take care of the snack bar and the two coffee
bars," she said. "I love it. I think it's great."
From his beginnings as a Sharpies dishwasher, Jones

players, the tape decks and the mixing console."

Both Handler and Flurie are confident that
Plotnick's work will help WSRN, and make its
studios a more attractive place for radio show
hosts. "I wouldn't do this if I didn't think it would
solve all the little problems from last semester
that made the studio a little less comfortable to be
in and a little less enjoyable to operate. If we do
that, I will be satisfied."
Facilities, .not. Plotnick, will be dealing with
some of the particular problems that prevented
the station from broadcasting at full power last
semester, Flurie said.
"The problems we were having aren't at our
end. The problem is somewhere in the cable or the
antenna
either of those could have been disturbed during construction," Flurie said. "If it's
one of those things, facilities is going to fix it for
us. They've been very good about working with
us."
Plotnick will nonetheless be available in the
event that larger technical difficulties arise, and
he and Flurie have discussed the creation of an
additional broadcast studio separate from the one
that currently exists.
Applications for hosting radio shows were due
yesterday, and Handler and Flurie look forward to
a campus enthusiasm similar to last semester's,
when there were more than 100 shows. "We had our
big meeting on Sunday, and we're looking forward
to being on the air on Monday," Handler said. "If
there are still technical difficulties at that point,
we'll broadcast on the Swarthmore Web site."
"My goal this semester is solid, uninterrupted,
good broadcasting," Flurie said. "I want the campus to know that we're going to sound good this
semester. We're correcting all the mistakes we
made last semester."
Flurie said that it is possible that Plotnick's
work may end up costing WSRN slightly more
than the funds available in its budget would cover,
but no great amount will need to be requested of
SBC. "There are certain projects we can easily put
off until next year if cost becomes a problem," he

has climbed to the top of the management chain.
"I was pretty much all over [the place]," he said. "I've

been here for ten years."
Jones enjoys his new position, especially because it
presents him with challenges. One of his many objectives
and challenges as Sharpies utility manager is to have the
dishwashers work as a unit.
"[The position] is more responsibility," he said. "But
it's something I always knew I could do."
Though Tutton will be missed, McDougall saw Tutton's
departure as a chance to promote other employees.
"I think it is really good to promote people whenever
the opportunity presents itself," she said. "This was a perfect opportunity."

on Social Justice and Activism on
Saturday. "And although I'll admit to
being a 'Sex and the City' addict, there
needs to be more access to different forms
of media. It's a challenge for us documentary filmmakers."
Simmons' discussion was just part of
the Intercultural Center's Forum on
Social Justice and Activism, held
Saturday afternoon.
The day included four .workshops,
including Simmons', followed by a light
dinner with performances by spokenword artists and was attended by about 60
students, faculty and community members. Simmons, founder and president of
AfroLez Productions, LLC, an arts company dedicated to unveiling the issues
that marginalize and disenfranchise
groups of people, lectured a group of students, faculty and friends of the college
on her experience as a black lesbian in
the documentary film business.
During the workshop, she showed
clips from her forthcoming feature-length
documentary, "NO!," which addresses the

experts such as former chairman of the
Black Panther Party Elaine Brown and
human rights activist Michael Simmons,
the film focused on the personal experiences of black women and the injustices
they face in the black community and in
the national community.
The event itself was produced by the
Intercultural Center, but was sponsored
by the IC along with the Black Cultural
Center, the Gender Education Office and
the Office for MulticulturalAffairs.
Assistant Dean and IC Director Rafael
Zapata, who created a similar forum last
year, was the event's chief organizer. "It's

Fellow IC intern Piper Hy 'O5 echoed

(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis.
On college campuses around the
country Tuesday, students and
faculty

joined

together

to

release State Public Interest
Research Group's new report
"Ripoff 101: 2nd Edition."
The report is a follow-up to
another document, the CPIRG,
California's version of UWMadison's WisPIRG, released
last year.

This newly released report
extended its research nationwide, interviewing faculty at 59
universities.
According to the state
Higher
PIRG's
Education
xProject report, students are
spending an average of $9OO on
books each year, equaling onefifth of total tuition costs.
Consequently, textbook publishing companies are adding to
the already rising cost of higher
education, said UW-Madison
sophomore Jay Hover, who was
UW-Madison's representative at
the release.
According to the study, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics
Producer Price Index found
textbook prices have risen 62
percent since 1994, in comparison to a 14 percent increase in
other finished goods.
"Textbook prices are sky-

like CD-ROM and workbooks,"
said Lara Dreier, the WPIRG
campus coordinator.
The companies are issuing
unnecessary new editions with
no new educational information
in them and bundling extras
that only 67 percent of professors said they actually use,

reported Ripoff 10L
Companies also overcharge
American students specifically,
according to Dreier.

"American students on aver-

age are paying 20 percent more
than our counterparts overseas," she said.

Publishing companies are
getting away with this because
American students are willing
to pay the higher prices, according to Hover.
"They are American publishers so the books are published

here and manufactured here
and sold here," said Scheibel.
"This is the original market for
almost everything they sell. So
it's not that they are priced up
here, they are priced here based
on their market."

The report calls for publishing companies to refrain from
producing new textbooks unnecessarily and offer unbundled
materials instead of only bundled sets.

Glamour magazine editor urges persistence

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY SARA SARGENT

ssargenl@swarthmore.edu

Intellectual? Without question. Stylish?
Doubtful. Glamorous?
Probably not at the top of anyone's list
of descriptions about Swarthmore.
In light of this less-than-fashion-forward image of the college, it may come as a
surprise that Cynthia Leive, one of the
most prominent figures in the world of
women's magazines, graduated from the
college in 1988.
With a degree in English literature from
Swarthmore, Leive went on to become the
editor in chief of Glamour Magazine and a
worthy role model for aspiring professionals everywhere.
Leive addressed a group of 12 students
last Thursday evening as part of Career
Services' series of alumni dinners.
Created to give students an opportunity

to meet alumni who specialize in various
professions, "the program is a joint venture between Career Services and Alumni
Relations," Laura Sibson, assistant director of Alumni Relations, said in an e-mail.
"The alumni we invite are typically
well-established in their careers, so that
they can speak from experience on how
their careers have evolved since graduation. We try to invite alums of different
fields, so as to appeal to the diverse interests of our students," she said.
After Career Services sets up a date
with an alumnus, an e-mail is sent to students who have contacted Career Services

and expressed an interest in that particular
professional field.
Since the dinners are intended to be
intimate gatherings where students can
speak with the guest one-on-one, invitations are limited."
The dinner with Cynthia Leive was the
third held this academic year.

"There are many Swatties
who express an interest in
magazine publishing... [lt]
was the most requested
field for externships this

year."
Laura Sibson

Resource Center in New Jersey.
"There are many Swatties who express
an interest in magazine publishing. In fact,

publishing was the most requested field for
externships this year, so the Career
Services staff was thrilled to bring Cindi to
campus," Sibson said. "Her schedule is
incredibly busy.
Sue Lathrop, in
Development, booked Cindi for the dinner
back in August."
Fortunately for students, Leive was able
to find time for the two-hour gathering,
held at the Ashton House on Elm Street.
"She was extremely welcoming and responsive to all of our questions," said Chelsea
Ferrell 'O5, a Political Science major interested in book publishing. "Unlike what you

On Tuesday night, Student
Council passed a resolution sponsored by the members of TREC.
The resolution stated that the
Student Council supports the implementation of dedicated funding for
SEPTA and urges the administration
to take a firm position.
"In the past Student Council has
shied away from this sort of political

resolution,"

Council co-President

Tom Evnen 'O7 said. "However, the
current Student Council feels that
it's important to become involved in
the Pennsylvania politics that affect
us. In this case, SEPTA is extremely
important to students."
"[Student Council] had spoken to
the administration and they felt the
same way, so we Council felt the need
to reflect that by endorsing this resolution," he said.
"The first goal of the resolution is
to secure the support of the student
body for a dedicated funding source

for SEPTA. The second goal is to
secure the eventual support of the
administration and ask them to
investigate the situation," said
Petkun, who authored the resolution.
Both Evnen and Petkun emphasized that the resolution does not
take antagonistic position toward the
college administration, but asks the
President's office to confirm its support for dedicated funding for SEPTA
and pressure the state legislature to

act accordingly.
"We want the administration to

look into the impacts of the SEPTA
crisis on the student body; but also,
we think it's important that
Swarthmore take the lead in supporting the community around us that
depends on SEPTA."
At last Wednesday's meeting,
TREC discussed attacking its other
issues, chiefly ANWR, in the long

Sussman said that new
members of SAC may not have

budgeting for student events.
"No one had a sense of the
budget," he said, referring to
Monday night's SAC meeting.
Though Sussman and Patel
had made recommendations
for specific appointments to
SAC, Sussman recognized that
it was not abnormal for such
recommendations to go unfulfilled. "Everyone supports
their people for the committee
and sometimes they get
appointed and sometimes they
don't," he said.
Ucker said that the Council

hopes to use the process to find
people with new ideas for SAC.

"We were looking for students
with new ideas that they're
wiling to propose. Those are
the kind of people that will
help SAC be more balanced,"
he said. "The more groups represented in SAC's funding
decisions the better."

As this semester's dating
guru, I must admit I was
stumped when it came to chosing a topic

for this week. How to

handle long distance relationships? The sweet little things
you can do on campus for your
significant other? My personal
opinion on pick-up lines? I was
lost. It wasn't 9 p.m. yet, meaning I couldn't call my boyfriend
to complain, so I got a friend to
take me to McDonald's instead.
As we sat down with the

alcohol we'd brought with us,
my friend randomly mentioned

Kaiko Shimura

that he liked my sweater. My ini-

tialreaction: "Huh?"

Love Bites

"Your sweater. I like it," he
repeated. "Uh, why?" I demandEd, a little confrontationally. "I
don't know, I just do," he said.
"Shut up, liar. You don't have to be nice to me because I'm providing the booze," I snapped. But he continued to insist that he simply
liked my sweater, and I finally grudgingly accepted the compliment.
The incident got me thinking: Why do students here seem so
unwilling to accept compliments concerning their physical
appearance? A lot of it can be chalked up to simple, stubborn
modesty, but what about the people who shoot you a weird look
when you comment positively on their appearance? Flattery is a
crucial tool in any relationship, a timeless method of expressing
romantic interest.

What about the people who shoot you a
weird look when you comment positively
on their appearance?
_

:

,

So why do Swatties seem so averse to flattery? I've had numerous friends complain despairingly of people who've either avoided
them completely or tagged at their heels after being complimented,
which turned my once compliment-giving friends into less-nicecompliment-giving friends. Now they feel a need to shackle their
compliments with qualifiers such as, "Don't take this the wrong
way but..." and, "I totally don't mean this in a weird way, but..."
This behavior extends to potential dating partners as well, which
essentially means my friends' comments are brushed off as simply
friendly compliments rather than expressions of deeper interest.
At the same time, you may have noticed how all
and I mean
Swatties will light up at a compliment on how good their
ALL
presentation/paper/discussion question was. All of a sudden
they're all smiles; they might even compliment you back on that
really interesting point you made in class. Why the discrepancy?
Why is, "Hey, I really enjoyed your presentation; it was really well
put together" taken so differently from, "Wow, I like your t-shirt"?
The Carrie Bradshaw to my Miranda suggested that we feel such
compliments are acceptable because we worked hard for them and
we secretly feel we deserve them. She has a point. That said, my
previous observation becomes all the more disturbing what, we
don't think we deserve compliments regarding our physical
appearances?

I refuse to accept this. Everyone likes him- or herself to a certain extent, and even if we don't all spend an hour (or even a
minute) primping before class, that doesn't necessarily mean that
the girl or guy who comments on how good you look in your most
unflattering jeans is only trying to get into them, or worse, is
obsessed with you. So please, don't shrug them off and avoid them
indefinitely: What do you lose by being nice? And for all of my
friends who still use the same lame prefix to every one of their
compliments: Chill out. If you compliment someone who's immature enough to run away from you for the next four years, forget
about it. It's their loss. So maybe that kid in your econ class who
commented on your new shirt likes you, and maybe he doesn't
but in the end, he wasn't asking you out. So maybe you should just
smile, say "Thanks!" and at least give him the chance to charm
those jeans off.

Singing in the sunlight
BY ALYSSA WORK

aworkl@swarthmore.edu

As the final rays of daylight filtered into Lang
Concert Hall last Sunday, Dawn was just beginning:
Dawn Upshaw, that is. In a concert that brought an
audience of Swarthmore students, faculty, community members and orchestra patrons to its feet, the
world-renowned soprano performed selections by

20th-century composers alongside Philadelphia's

Orchestra 200
L
"We've been trying for three to five years to get
[Dawn Upshaw]," said Jim Freeman, Orchestra 2001's
artistic director. "She only gives two to three recitals
a year. She very consciously limits her opportunities
for performance, so it's really exciting when an artist
like that is able to make us one of her two to three
yearly performances."

When it was founded 17 years ago, the orchestra
"sort of fulfilled a dream of an orchestra that would
introduce people to 20th century composers," said
concert manager Jim Moskowitz. A performance with
Upshaw, who according to Moskowitz is known for
specializing in 20th-century song, then, was ideal.
"Artists who collaborate with us do so because
they know they can do repertoire they won't do otherwise," said Jim Freeman, artistic director of
Orchestra 200 L "We do repertoire of a more intimate
nature, and we're doing 20th-, 21st-century music that
a lot of people don't go to hear."
Lack of attendance wasn't a problem at this performance, however. According to Orchestra 2001 's
executive director Barbara Murray, people began calling for tickets as soon as the orchestra's mailing went
out in early January. A block of tickets was set aside
for Swarthmore faculty and students, although many
interested people were still not able to get a ticket.
"Our first allegiance is to the Swarthmore community," said Murray, "but it's been really tight."
Mark Skaden 'OB got a ticket off a stand-by list. "I
heard people talking that had paid $l5O for a performance like this," he said, "so I definitely feel like it was
worth seeing for free."
As the college's official ensemble-in-residence for
the last nine years, Orchestra 2001 gives a repeat performance at Swarthmore of every program performed
in Philadelphia.
February 3,

2005

Freeman characterized Sunday's concert, which
was split at intermission between Orchestra 2001 and
Upshaw as a "semi-collaboration."
"Its a shared performance," he explained, "because
she doesn't have time to rehearse."
Alec Wilder's six "Airs" for solo winds, string
orchestra and harpsichord made up the first half of the
concert. Wilder's music, noted by Eric Bruskin in the
program as being marked by an "urbane, sophisticated
wit and delicate emotional tenor," punctuated sweeping, classically orchestral sounds with syncopated
jazzy interludes and playful harpsichord melody.
Upshaw began her section of the program with
selections from Gustav Mahler's "Des Knaben
Wunderhorn," a lively collection of German folk
poetry set to music. She then sang three works from
Debussy's "Chansons de Bilitis," an arrangement of
romantic, free-flowing songs based on prose poetry
by the late 19th century symbolist poet Pierre Loiiy,
finishing the concert with five throaty, spirited
"Cabaret Songs" composed by William Bolcom.
"My dad told me that Dawn Upshaw is known as
the best singer in her voice category," said Rachel
Huneryager 'O5. "I'm not really in a position to judge,
but I was entranced by the variety of music she sang."
Upshaw quickly dispelled any expectations audience members might have had of a traditional operatic performance. Her eyes wide, her arms in constant

motion, Upshaw presented each of her thirteen songs
as a storyteller intimately connected to the audience.
Clenched fists and an anguished expression combined with cascading, dramatic accompaniment
brought life to Mahler's "Das irdische Leben," a troubling song about a child who dies waiting for a loaf of
bread; playful smiles and spoken character portrayal
interspersed "Black Max" and "Toothbrush Time,"
two of Bolcom's jazzy pieces.
Another of Bolcom's works, "Amor," perfectly
encapsulated Upshaw's style: a laugh, a whisper, and a
seemingly random smattering of "dee-dee-dum"s
brought the concert to a close as the sunset filtered
through Lang's windows to highlight the soloist
a
perfect ending to "Dawn at Dusk."
Orchestra 2001 will perform Mozart's "Zaide"
March 20 at Swarthmore, and will return April 10
with Swarthmore faculty member Melinda Wagner
for "Three Premieres and a Masked Ball."

All he wants to do is
dance (dangerously)
BY AYAN CHATTERJEE

achattel@swarthmore.edu

"We're going to take it to Broadway," Joe Raciti 'O5 boasted of his
latest project. He and his director, Ethan Ucker 'O7, have very high
hopes for their musical, "Dance Dangerously." Indeed, this student
written theatrical production has generated considerable buzz in the

college community.
What began as a few songs composed for piano during the fall semester grew slowly into a full-fledged musical comedy. Raciti has always had
a passion for songwriting, but had never embarked on a project of this
magnitude. When he told Ucker last year that if he wrote a musical he
would like Ucker to direct it, the two of them took it somewhat lightly.
But Raciti began writing the script in the fall of 2004, completed most of
"Dance Dangerously" over winter break, and came back to Swat with
something to show for his work.
Raciti first contacted Drama Board around late October, and in
January he and Ucker formally proposed the project. Drama Board gladly offered assistance in getting the show performed. For those of you not
familiar with the Drama Board sanctioning process, the board requires a
director to submit a formal proposal for funding, which is contingent
upon holding open auditions. On Jan. 28, Raciti and his team began auditions, with callbacks taking place last Sunday.

All I really wanted to do was spend the night
in my own bed. But I had an out-of-dorm experience to write about, and no one ever said journalistic integrity would be pleasant. In these
days of Jayson Blair and CBS scandals, it's up to
us little guys to fight for honor. So on Thursday
night, after running out of drinks at Pub Nite, I
slept out as promised. This week's location: the
game room.
It was a one-night odyssey. While readying
myself for what promised to be an unforgiving
night, one thing nagged at me. You know when
you want to hear a certain song but every version
on DC++ is the wrong one? I spent 40 frustrating
minutes searching for Bonnie Tyler's version of
"Total Eclipse of the Heart" from the movie "Old
School"
the one with the line, "I fucking need
you more than ever." Thwarted in that goal, I
updated the music on my iPod and asked myself, if
iPods and humans could make babies, would the
babies be able to play music in their brains as a
blue backlight blazed from their eyes? I watched
an episode of "South Park" and brushed my teeth.
At last, I felt ready to go out and risk my most valued possession: my sleep.

to take a walk and check out early-morning
Tarble. I discovered several secret passageways
in the bowels of Tarble and Clothier bell tower.
(This is where SWIL used to host the pterodactyl
hunt, but a horrible disaster involving an actual
minotaur resulted in a new location.) Upper
Tarble was home to a grossly oversized John
Kerry poster and a pair of foam egg-crate mattress pads which, for some reason, lay strewn
and tangled salaciously. Bored enough to sleep, I
went downstairs, put "Heat of the Moment" on
my iPod, and stretched out on my makeshift bed.
It wasn't very comfortable; I should've taken the

egg-crates.
As I nodded off, troubled thoughts crossed my
mind. Would I be punished if I were found? The
last thing I remember thinking about was my first
memory of getting in trouble at home: After
in
watching Looney Tunes, I told my father
to "Ahh, shut up," and
Bugs Bunny's words
then ran up the stairs screaming as he chased me
to my room. I dreamt of being similarly pursued
by an angry administrator.
Fortunately, I wasn't accosted by any deans,
although I was woken several times: first by a 2003
graduate who woke me to ask if I had seen his blue
jacket. (I hadn't.) Later, a guy from Environmental
Services woke me as he cleaned. I acted quickly.
Without prompting, I got up, introduced myself,
shook his hand, said, "Sleeping here on newspaper business, sorry for the inconvenience," and
got back in bed before he could reply. Now there's
some quick thinking for ya.
I successfully woke up early enough to be first
on the breakfast line, eat in bed, return my blanket and pillow to my room, and make it to class.
Though not the perfect spot to pass the night,
the game room wasn't a half-bad place to sleep. If
necessary, I would do it again.
Game room gets 3/5 pillows.

Some of the action will take place in the
aisles of the theater, surrounding and pulling
in the audience
"Dance Dangerously" focuses on a love triangle that consists of the
gifted dancer Bella; her womanizing boyfriend, Billy; and the sweet,
quirky boy-next-door, George. The story is set in motion when Bella's
dancing rival and friend, Jen, wanting to distract Bella from her work,
bets a thousand dollars for Billy to propose marriage to Bella. Narrating
the tale are two witty, British-accented puppets. Raciti explained that
inspiration for this idea came from The Muppets. The music Raciti composed for the show is not in typical Broadway show-tune style, but incorporates elements of rock, pop, jazz and blues. The musical's title comes
from the fact that Bella's dancing is technically brilliant but lacks that
extra bit of panache, that element of 'danger' that would make it divine.
Directing a musical poses a creative challenge for Ucker, who directed Samuel Beckett's "Footfalls" in last year's Night of Scenes. "There's
all these components that have to come together
besides the acting, like the orchestra or the
choreography
directing a musical means
creating synergy between all these things,"

The creative team has taken on the task
with considerable gusto, with great ideas for
the aesthetic elements of the show. With a
certain self-consciousness regarding the
familiarity and predictability of the plot,
"Dance Dangerously" will have a color
scheme of black, white and grey (hence the flyers presenting the show as 'a musical in black
and white"). The sets, lighting, costumes and even
makeup will be in black and white. In contrast, certain characters and scenes will take place in vivid
color, reflecting the quirky personalities and une'
pected events that cross the stage. In
addition, Raciti hopes to make this a

more interactive production than

the
most musicals. Some

script needs finishing touches and the score has yet
to be finalized. Raciti seems to be aware of the risk
he is taking with his play. "If ['Dance Dangerously']

to be an engaging and entertaining work. The play

'Million Dollar Baby' almost a knockout
BY ABIGAIL GRABER
agraberl@swarthmore.edu

In the land where the slow Southern
drawl dictates not only the pace of dialogue
but the pace of life, where the only colors of
prominence are brown, beige and taupe,
and where the Warner Brothers logo is in

black and white: in these fertile asphalt
pastures Clint Eastwood reigns god, king
and emperor. And don't you forget it,
young whippersnapper.
In
this deceptively and almost
anachronistically simple world, Eastwood
once again brings his formidable powers

of melodrama to bear. "Million Dollar
Baby" sports many classic Eastwood hallmarks, not the least of which is the sense
that the director (who is also the producer, composer and star) repeatedly pummeled his actors with a dictionary open to
the page defining "gritty." This movie is
so gritty you can feel the dirt under your
fingernails. But

where sometimes grit

seems spackled on for extra "realism," in
an Eastwood film it occurs as naturally as

breathing.

Eastwood plays gritty boxing trainer
Frankie Dunn, a gruff Man with a Past.
Though he continues to train talented
fighters at the gym run by his friend
Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris (Morgan
Freeman, also gritty), events have made
Frankie overly cautious and unwilling to
take therisks necessary to bring a fighter
to the top. His partnership with Maggie
Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, doing her darndest to prove that she, too, can be gritty),
an untrained, older female fighter, is as
much about getting over his closet skeletons as bringing her to the championship.
Though viewers may be skeptical that

there is anything left to add to the under-

dog-sports-movie genre, lumping "Million
Dollar Baby" into that category does it a
disservice. Eastwood focuses far more on
the bonds forged between Frankie, Eddie,
and Maggie than on Maggie's boxing triumphs. If anything, he views the sports
aspect of the movie with a kind of wry tol-

erance, treating Maggie's astounding success humorously instead of inspirationally. The film contains one genre-defying
musical montage, and Eastwood's plinkity piano will have the "Rocky" theme out
of your head in no time.
The pacing of "Million Dollar Baby,"
enhanced by its calming score, showcases
the skill of the filmmakers more than any
other aspect of the film. Sofia Coppola,
take note: "Million Dollar Baby" may be

meditative,

but

it

is rarely

slow.

Screenwriter Paul Haggis knows he has a
lot of believability barriers to overcome,

and he takes his sweet time with each
obstacle. Frankie originally rejects the
idea of training a girl, and the script
resists a showy, unexplained about-face.
He doesn't change his mind so quickly
that it undermines his character, yet neither is the transformation so long in coming that it creates a false climax.
Haggis deals out humor with an equally deft hand, although here he is helped
by a committed cast. Freeman is especially powerful and able to line his grizzled
voice with both irony and amusement. He
and Eastwood play off each other well,
aided by a script that seems unspoiled by
either cliches or the smooth brilliance
that translates as overly theatrical.
Swank is better suited to Maggie's sweaty
grunginess than she was to the cleaner
Alice Paul, in whose shoes she never
appeared entirely comfortable in HBO's
"Iron Jawed Angels." The character of

Clint Eastwood coaches Hilary Swank during a fight scene from "Million Dollar Baby"
Maggie, however, fits Swank like a
glove—a boxing glove, if you will—and

she holds her own with Freeman and
Eastwood, no small triumph in itself.
Because two-thirds of the film is handled so skillfully, it's truly a shame that
the ending doesn't live up to the rest of
the movie's promise. Alas, it's drawn-out
and overdone, demanding emotion from
the viewers where the rest of the film was
able to subtly entice it. After nearly two
hours, the emotional buildup would have
been better served by a much shorter,

simpler and less over-the-top resolution
than "Million Dollar Baby" delivers.
Though one can fault Eastwood's ending for slipping over into the yawning
abyss of unwelcome emotional manipulation that lurks menacingly between the
lines of every drama, effortless and easy
flowing drama is one of the most difficult
mediums of moviemaking, and Eastwood
is looking to corner the market. The
script and acting largely deliver a one-two
punch that even a misstep in the final
round can't eradicate.

ROCKIN' OUT AT OLDE CLUB
by Alexis Pernas

With music

to pop to unclassifiable,
Olde Club is the flac e to be this semester.

ranging

from rock

Olde Club has a promising lineup of shows planned for this semester. If you were there Friday night, you know
firsthand that it was impossible not to violate four people's space at once. The crowd was massive; many were
redirected to the side door as people came pouring out from the front. Asobi Seksu and the Walkmen were a
success, firing up the crowd to raucous levels of enthusiasm and the lead singer was so enthusiastic that he
literally fell off the stage. Fortunately, this is the first of many high-profile shows scheduled to appear at Olde Club
this semester. Here are some upcoming dates to remember:
Feb. 25: As part of Ratatat, Mike "Snake" Stroud
and Evan "E*Vax" Mast combine guitar riffs with what
XL Recordings called a "love of Jay-Z, The Rolling
Stones, Timbaland and Beethoven." Not only do these
guys have diverse musical interests, but they also have
talent. Stroud, for instance, has spent time touring with
Ben Kweller and Dashboard Confessional. Prepare to
get engaged at this show. According to Olde Club
facilities director Ben Ewen-Campen 'O6, "they
make you dance and [they] bring industrial
strobe lights."
Opening for Ratatat will be

rockers Sonic Youth,

featuring Mr. Lif and Akrobatik will be
treat. The Perceptionists are a three-man
band from Boston comprised of Mr. Lif,
xrobatik and DJ Fakts One, from Definitive Juks
jords. For those of you who enjoy Bush-bashing and
dve "reality rap," be sure to give these guys some love.
According to The Windish Agency, "Lif, Ak and Fakts are
creating music that doesn't talk to one set of people, and
doesn't ever come at you the same way twice," which
sounds perfectly fit to Swarthmore's diverse audience,
w ww. theperceptionists. com
April 23: Bonnie "Prince" Billy, aka songwriter
Will Oldham, teams up with guitarist Matt Sweeney
(formerly of Billy Corgan's Zwan) to create the album
"Superwolf." The Guardian favored this duo on Domino
Records, pointing out their uniqueness and interesting
stylistic forms. According to a review in the Guardian,
Oldham's "spectral voice and spooky American storytelling suggest a musical vision that isn't easily shared,"
and together with Sweeney, "feature(s) a menagerie of
symbolic animals, death, whistling." An album review on
deo2.com gives this rather complicated but appropriate
description of the artists' combined work: "This ain't linear music, but occasional complex arrangements, delightful dynamics and gorgeous interplays secure dais for
vocals that touch emo-endings with such power to shatter
paranoia."

Other shows: Other events planned for the near future
include the Rose Tattoo Cafe next Friday, Feb. 11, a battle
of the bands and one more major show by a yet-to-be-chosen band.
So there you have it, folks. The semester's schedule
isn't final yet, but the shows that are already set are
guaranteed to please. If the upcoming shows compare to
Friday, we're in for some real entertainment.

MUSIC REVIEW!

Enchanting Parisian songs
Coco Rosie frenchifies their unique musical sensibilities
BY JOE KILLE
jkillel@swarthmore.edu
The line between being quirky and original or quirky and just really damn irritating
is a fine one. In the entertainment industry,
where true uniqueness and authenticity are
punished, weird for weird's sake seems to be
as good as anyone's going to get. Tom Waits
is one of my favorite artists, but I'd be fooling
myself if I didn't realize that his voice is an
affectation. He makes it work though, and on
each subsequent album his songs are always
different enough so that his gruff delivery
acts as a compliment to, the music and never
upstages it.
Coco Rosie is made up of Parisian sisters
Sierra and Bianca Cassidy. Their new album
"La Maison de mon Reve" (which my submiddle-school French leads me to believe
means "The House of My Dream") was
recorded this last spring in Paris, a fact
which is evident even after one listen. On
their album, the Cassidys bring together elements of the blues, hip-hop, and children's
music, all sung in English but decidedly
forced through a Franco-filter.
The album waxes and wanes like a drunk

arrangement makes each song its own. Most
of the time it's hard to listen to any one particular aspect of Coco Rosie's sound.
Unidentifiable percussion and sound effects
litter each song without ever becoming obtru-

sive.
The sisters' particular style of delivery
also makes it difficult to hear exactly what
they are singing most of the time, which just
lends each song an even more dreamy and
otherworldly presence. The sound of human
voices is present and familiar, but their message is far away, and most of the time, beautiful.
Songs like "By Your Side," "Madonna"
and "Haitian Love Songs" are each wonderfully multi-layered, each with a beat their
own that no other aspect of the music particularly follows. The efforts that suffer are the
ones that try to hard to be "regular" songs.
"Terrible Angels" endures only because of
the Cassidys' unique style of harmonizing
with each other, and not because of the
song's lyrics, which probably seemed a lot
more profound when they were originally
written(which was probably late at night and
with a bottle or two of wine). Again, it's the
production and arrangement that makes this
album.
I'm sure that Coco Rosie's publicist has
worked up quite a backstory on the sisters,
and the girls are certainly pretty enough to
carry their own in any publicity photo. I'd
prefer not to know anything about them
though, as it allows me to further pursue my
naive fantasy that this album just came to
exist without expertly deliberated fabrication, the same fantasy in which Tom Waits is
really 200 years old, and that's why he sings
like that.

Saving SEPTA
There are probably few institutions as dependent on
SEPTA service as Swarthmore. To the degree that we
want to resist the tendency of our campus community to
maintain the often-cited self-involved bubble, we depend
on SEPTA to provide students with access to the outside
world. Students who take classes at the University of
Pennsylvania, who regularly go to museums and other
cultural attractions, or who spend their free time shopping and socializing in the city all depend on SEPTA.
And like any major employer in the area, we have a
large number of employees without easy access to cars,
who depend on SEPTA service to come to work every
day. Yet the government continues to snub us and others
who depend on public transit, and our administration
isn't doing much about it.
Thanks to the many vagaries of SEPTA's funding
process and the Pennsylvania legislature, we pay a pretty high price as metro rail systems go for one of the least
modernized and least reliable systems in the Northeast.
Of course, this is before the threatened service cuts and
funding hikes come into play, at which point SEPTA will
be the most expensive system in the country with hours
that will make it unusable. The college will have no
choice but to replace SEPTA with its own city shuttle
system for students who need to travel in the evenings
and on weekends
a huge cost and logistical burden we
can ill afford.
This college, along with other educational institutions, makes up a large part of greater Philadelphia's
economy and cultural history. We have a degree of clout
in the media and, we hope, respect from the government. Is there any reason why the administration
appears to be sitting on its hands, for the most part, and
waiting for the disaster to happen? Institutions that
purport to represent the student population in general,
like Campus Philly, are shouting their anger at the state
government's abandonment of public transit and the

people it serves loud and clear
why is Swarthmore
itself being so quiet?
The administration needs to take action, and take it
now. Not only should the administration throw all the
political weight it can against the coming cuts, but it
should be preparing for the worst now, making plans to
create a school-basedtransit system in the event that the
cuts come to pass this month. It'll be painful for the budgetmakers, but a lot less painful than the massive inconvenience to the campus community if we reach the transition away from SEPTA-dependence unprepared.

Making music
With the limited size of our student body and the limited resources available to us, we find it all too difficult,
even with the notoriously overambitious nature of the
average Swattie, to find students able and willing to create original, self-directed projects that can truly engage
and involve the whole campus. This is especially true of
anything creative or artistic. Students can come together to protest the war or to feed the homeless, yes, but
when there's less of a clear moral imperative, our artistic endeavors tend toward the quirky, cliquey and insular. Much of art is anchored in the grand tradition of big,
far-reaching projects of collaboration between many disparate minds and voices intended to bring something

impressive and lasting to the masses, but Swarthmore
students seem to prefer obscure pieces created alone in a
garret, intended to impress one's professors and small

group of friends.
This may be a tradition that works well for paintings,
short classical music compositions and avant-garde oneact plays, but it's antithetical to the tradition of the
American musical, which requires a huge degree of
cooperation between playwrights, composers and choreographers to manage huge numbers of actors, singers
and dancers. Those of us who have been starving at the
dearth of creative new musical theater at Swarthmore
therefore have a lot to admire in Joe Raciti 'O5, who has
not only written a musical but wrangled the massive
number of talented people at all levels needed to make it
happen. Let's hope more people follow in his footsteps.

GIF supports UN action, not mercenaries
Dear Editor:
Two rumors have been flying around campus about the

Genocide Intervention Fund (GIF) that I would like to
clear up once and for all. First, some people are claiming
that the GIF will fund a
mercenary army. This is
not true. The GIF will help
fund the African Union
Mission in Sudan (AMIS
II)
the only force with a
mandate from the United
Nations to provide security to the victims of the

genocide.

Second, some people

will effect a political cost for inaction by signaling to
world governments that citizens are committed to ending
genocide. The GIF will use the funds raised for AMIS II as
a leveraging tool to advocate for increased financial, logistical and diplomatic support

The GIF seeks to complement and
catalyze government action, not to
replace it.

I

are claiming that the GIF seeks to
completely privatize the funding of peacekeeping missions. This is also not true. The GIF seeks to complement
and catalyze government action, not to replace it. The GIF

for the AMIS 11.
I hope that this letter helps
clear up any confusion about
the GIF. If you have additional questions, please e-mail me

(cangelol@swarthmore.edu).
Also, please come to Sudan
Saturdays (1:30 Trotter 201) to
take action. All faculty, staff
and students are welcome. You can also email Susannah
Gund 'OB (sgundl@swarthmore.edu). We need your support to help end the genocide in Darfur!

it came along "on its

idea of what I wanted to

(which seem either like

Facilitated Diffusion of the veryforgotten
meaningful
realizations I wanted to
share. Ironically, this
leads me to remember one of my main points: this
school distorts all notions of time, space and experiential reality. Swarthmore College is the antithesis of living in the moment.
Sometimes, when I'm here, I feel like I'm alive. But
usually, I spend my time planning on being alive at a
later date. Oftentimes I will even put it on my to-do list:
Thursday, 9 p.m." I'm not sure what I
"Be alive
would do without my to-do list.
...

For this I blame myself, mostly, but also you, and

some professors, and Williams and Amherst, and capitalism in general, Rene Descartes in particular. But to
keep things simple (I'm really in a desperate hurry
right now) I'll focus on how and why I just cringed as
the Clothier bell tower tolled the next hour. That is,
this incredible pressure I feel to always do something
with my time. To be efficient at Swarthmore means
that there can be hardly a minute that is not apportioned in some abstractly effective way. In this manner, our school is sort of like a regimented medieval
monastery, except that our days are not marked by
communications with the eternal, but by the neurotic
consumption of a very particular type of intellectual
knowledge that could quite possibly prove to be relatively useless and backwards in the schema of Western
thought some tangible years down the line.
Please stop reading this, and look outside for a
minute. From my experience, the best ideas come
while not doing anything at all, while simply walking,
while daydreaming, while sleeping. When it snowed
last Saturday, I put away my reading and spent the
entire day outside, without time, nearly ecstatic in the

letter

to

enlightenment of my snow-frolicking. When I came
back to my room, glowing polar joy, the thought
occurred to me that I had accomplished nothing all

day. Another thought followed: is happiness not an
accomplishment? Is being alive not being productive?
Does Swarthmore foster daydreaming? Or is idleness

base?

In a school full of overachievers, insatiability is
almost cool: The self-abnegating (but paradoxically
self-absorbed) urge to aspire is something to be proud
of. But it is this thirsty drive, in part, that burdens us
with the pressure to utilize time, rather than experience it. "Guilt Without Sex" is an understatement.
This is funny but also emotionally damaging, mentally
and physically unhealthy, spiritually murderous, generally stupid and by many cultures would be considered a form of serious insanity.
Do professors help us out? I think some of them do,
and I'm saner and wiser from my time learning with
them, whether or not I remember everything they said.
But as an institution, I don't think that Swarthmore
sufficiently promotes and nurtures the development of
the kind of emotional intelligence that is necessary in
order to be healthily satisfied with what we have here
and now, with what we know and what we are in this
moment. Too few professors emphasize the importance
of the happiness and well-being of their students, and
despite all of our talk of context
even fewer
make
it a part of the lesson to give their students a sense that
what they are studying just might not be the most

important thing in the world, and that life is, quite possibly, much larger than this course. Classrooms are
windows to the world, not the world itself.
Losing sight of this perspective is existentially dangerous, and I know quite a few students who have literally freaked the hell out at this place. We can't go on
sweeping all issues of mental health under "maybe you
should see Psych Services" sympathy. Swarthmore
needs to take its "Learning for Life" ideals to heart.
Yes, it is "work" that we all have so much of all the
time. And "work" is good and satisfying and edifying
and everything. But education is not supposed to be
extended periods of drudge labor. Remember: we are
here because we want to be here
we're even paying
money for it. We're supposed to be learning, not suffering. These two don't (always) have to come together,
and they should never exclude living, which is what
we are all really learning about in the end, because,
after all, what else is there?

Biology neither explains nor excuses bias
Dear Editor:
We are writing in response to
Garth Sheldon-Coulson 'o7's column
"Yes, boys and girls are different"
(Jan. 27, pg. 15). We disagree with
him on most of his key points.
First, he asserts that since men's
and women's brains are different,
so we should expect different levels
of performance from both sexes.
Yes, men's and women's brains are
biologically different, but it's hard
to assign a quantitative value to
these differences and argue they
result in one sex outperforming the
other in a given field. Dr. Elizabeth
Spelke, a psychology professor at
Harvard, said of her research on
intelligence in 5-month-olds to 7year-olds in a recent New York
Times article,
while we always
test for gender differences in our
studies, we never find them."
"...

Adolescent boys, however, typically
outperform adolescent girls on standardized tests like the SATs by
about 30 points. This likely indicates that some sort of societal con-

THE PHOENIX

struct is influencing test results.
Men's and women's brains are so

similar that even if there is a difference that would somehow mean

that men are "smarter" than women

at sciences, this could not account
for the disparity in employment levels of women in the sciences. If this
disparity were closer to 20 percent
instead of the 80-90 percent we currently document, then arguing that
biological differences played an
important role in aptitude in the
sciences might be relevant. Looking
at data from other countries, you'll
see that they have higher rates of
female employment than the U.S.
Surely women in these countries
are not smarter than women in the
U.S. at these rates.
We do agree that we need to

remove the barriers that exist in
order for equal employment patterns to become the norm. These
barriers include, most importantly,
discriminationand systematic bias.
We can look to Larry Summers as a
good example of this bias: The num-

ber of new tenured female faculty
has declined every year under his
leadership as president of Harvard.
Last year, 12.5 percent of new
tenured faculty hired at Harvard
were women, compared with
approximately 36 percent the year
before Larry Summers became pres-

ident. If he wants to be controversial, that's his prerogative. If he
wants to promote debate, then he
should not have used his unscientific method of proposing a hypothesis, without doing any research, and
placing the burden on his critics to
prove him wrong.
We are all members of SWAP
(Swarthmore Women in Astronomy
and Physics), and we welcome anyone who would like to discuss
women in science further to attend
our meetings. We meet every Friday
for lunch in Sharpies Room Four.

the electoral clout of the elderly. Instead, Bush's plan will put
the guarantee of financial security for future retirees at risk
and we, the young people of today, will end up paying the price
In a way, it is difficult to write about Bush's plan, since he
has not formally announced it yet. From what the White House
has said so far, though, the general contours are clear: Once the
so-called Social Security reforms are passed, people will be able
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market, rather

than have all their payroll taxes automatically diverted to the
Social Security trust fund. Bush has not explicitly said that he
will cut guaranteed benefits for future retirees, but it seems
obvious that under his plan, benefits will have to be cut you
cannot divert a huge amount of payroll taxes from funding for
Social Security benefits and maintain those benefits at the same
level. Future retirees would be left with a much smaller guaranteed benefit and the return on their investments, whatever it
may be (if there even is a positive return).
Bush has not formally announced his plan, but given everything that he has said and observers have written, I believe my
above assessment of what his privatization effort would look
like is a fair one. It is easy to see that people our age have the
most to lose from such a plan. Do any ofus want to reach old age
with the uncertain markets as the only way to true financial
security? I doubt it; many people have made money on the market, of course, but people have also lost money in speculation,
and the point of Social Security is not to probably, maybe, or
perhaps give us some unspecified monetary boost in our old
age. Social Security is an agreement that we as a nation have
made that our elderly, after spending a long life working,
deserve a financially secure retirement. The President is asking
us to renege on that commitment.
He is not making that request up front and honestly. Rather,
in a strategy that many pundits have compared to Bush's runup to the invasion of Iraq, he is using catchy slogans like
"reform" and "saving Social Security" to obscure what he is
actually trying to do, which is fundamentally weaken a sound
program that has come close to ending poverty among the elderly in this country. It is true that Social Security will be more
difficult to finance as the baby boomers retire, but that difficulty is certainly not the crisis that some conservatives claim it is;
it can be met fairly easily by either reducing benefits to the
extremely wealthy or increasing the amount of income covered
by the payroll tax. Sooner or later, we may need to make those
or similar adjustments, but the explosive crisis cited by Bush
and his supporters is simply not there.
Social Security has its problems, but by and large, it has
been the most successful American social program ever
devised. Franklin Roosevelt and the other New Dealers who created Social Security set out to create a program that would
guarantee financial security for the elderly not financial security if the markets are doing well or if the political winds are
-

blowing in the right direction, but financial security. Period. If
we allow President Bush and his allies to make a dent in that
guarantee, it will be our generation that suffers the most.

have never been content to simJEREMY CRISTOL
ply ignore, or God forbid, delete
such e-mails. This overwhelming
Here's the Beef
sentiment, combined with a
Swatmail slowdown, has led to
the creation of the reserved-students digests we've been fed this semester. Contrary to claims
made in the Phoenix staff editorial "Digest Indigestion" (Jan. 20,
pg. 14) that the digest is problematic but a step in the right direction, this new system is in fact a step in the entirely wrong direction. Despite occasional abuses, the method ofreserved-students email distribution was at its best in its original form.
In one of the many heated Sharpies arguments I've had about
this issue (pathetic, I know), my self-proclaimed libertarian opponent suggested that he viewed his e-mail account as. a private
space. The staff editorial suggests a similar sentiment, that we
should be treated as adults and trusted to seek out this important
information rather than having it shoved in our faces. To me, the
beauty of the Swarthmore e-mail system is the community it fosters and represents. Everyone uses it and everyone needs it. Use
of a Swarthmore e-mail address is an unwritten acceptance of
your role in the Swarthmore community. Your e-mail address lets
you get on Thefacebook and reserve They Might Be Giants tickets.
It also gives you the special right to have your announcements of
events presented to the rest of the community in a manner they
are guaranteed to see. In return you have agreed to receive such
information, whether it is useful or annoying to you personally.
The new digest takes away this right, as the number of people who
actually see announcements drops exponentially with this system.
The subject line was the most important part of the average
reserved-students e-mail. If the subject line looked important, you
read it. If it didn't, you deleted it. If the subject line was "found
glasses," and you didn't lose your glasses, all you had to do was
delete it. If it was announcing an internship in a chem lab and
you're a French major, you deleted it. The minor hassle of deleting
the email was outweighed by the positives that could come of it. I
am happy to have to delete an e-mail if someone gets their 400-dollar glasses back or finds a summer job as a result.
The misguided attempt to make reserved-students e-mails

more convenient deprives us of this tool. Now I must open an email, which, on Swatmail, is known to often take more than a few
seconds, to find out that it contains nothing interesting. When the
"digest" has been so kind to digest only one e-mail for me, it's an
extra slap in the face. Why should I have to open an e-mail just to
see another subject line telling me someone lost a glove? If something interests me, I would much rather have that mentioned in a
subject line I could see in my inbox. If I ever want to go back to
that e-mail, the way it is now I would have to remember the volume and number of the digest, then scroll down through a mess of
information that would have otherwise been deleted.
Honestly, it was really nice to get e-mails all the time. It's awful
to check your e-mail and find no new messages. Even if it was an
announcement for a lecture you would never go to, you have to
admit that seeing that unopened envelope icon made the frequent
e-mail check a satisfying experience.
I understand that a large part of the justification for this
change was the load on the Information Technology Services mail
servers. Though my perspective on computing issues is largely
uneducated, this problem seems easily remedied to me through
increasing the use of e-mail programs which download mail to a
local folder, like Eudora or the Mail program included on every
Mac, or through an investment by ITS in a larger mail server,
which would be entirely worthwhile for other reasons as well.
Ultimately, the current system benefits only the truly indiscriminate e-mail deleters and the ITS mail server. Many
announcements will go unseen and requests unanswered. The
truly lazy can vouch for the fact that despite its mask of convenience, this system is anything but. It leaves those of us who accept
our roles in the campus community with a bad case of indigestion
that only a regular dosage of reserved-students e-mails can cure.

More to samurai than romanticized image
BY MIKIO AKAGI

makagil@swarthmore.edu

After reading Taru Taylor's "No dilemmas for men of
honor" (Jan. 20, pg. 15) it seems to me that there are sev-

eral things about Japanese feudal culture that should be
clarified. Ordinarily, I'm not inclined to put a damper on
the excitement of Japanophiles (I like Japan, too), but the
history of Japanese cultural ideology, while sometimes
refreshingly different from the history of Western
thought, has its own very serious drawbacks.
It is often said that the feudal culture of Japan, as well
as its modern culture in many respects, was a shame culture. This means that rather than enforcing a state conception of morality and etiquette upon society through
force, Japanese men and women grew up in such a stiflingly homogeneous atmosphere that this conception
was enforced through their own psychology. Throughout
their lives, these individuals were told and came to
strongly believe thatthe exemplary life was one in which
all personal desires were furiously suppressed. It was not
necessary, at least for the most "exemplary" of samurai,
to be punished for grave failures or transgressions; their
their
self-revulsion and sense of moral propriety
shame incited them to cut open their own stomachs in
a grotesque and intensely painful manner.
Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) is something of a
national hero to the modern Japanese. His treatise "The
Book ofFive Rings," on the principles of tactical swordsmanship, is read today by all serious Japanese businessmen and professionals. The romantic vision of Musashi
is enhanced in a novel by Yoshikawa Eiji ("Musashi"),
about his life. Yoshikawa depicts Musashi as a paragon of
Japanese virtue, which does have its attractions, but
which also over the course of the story requires Musashi
to live a life of unhappiness, unrequited love, and almost
continuous killing (including the murder of a frightened
and unarmed 2-year-old).
Another problem I find with the Japanese conception
of shame culture is its emphasis on duty not to other individuals but to "society," represented by bushido, the warrior's code of honor. Those who err are not asked to fix

the problems they create; they are simply asked to suffer
for their transgressions. It even becomes permissible for
people to be fantastically disloyal or immoral if they
immediately atone through suicide. In fact, there is no
part ofbushido which demands that men be their "brother's keepers." It is not part of a samurai's duty to save a
drowning peasant. Shame culture demands that individuals do their duty to an abstract concept of society, but
not to other individuals specifically.
This should bring up another observation: that the
extent of bushido and the effective reach of Japanese
shame culture before the Meiji era was the samurai
class, which lived and died on the backs of an oppressed
peasantry. Bushido was a bourgeois morality; the fantastic excesses of the samurai lifestyle and of bushido were
possible in feudal Japan only by using overwhelming
force and fear, not shame, to keep farmers in their place.
Just as shame did not operate strongly within the
peasantry as a form of social control, neither did the privileges of bushido extend to them. Japanese farmers had
no right to property, self-ownership or even life if those
rights were challenged by a member of the samurai class.
Often praised are the strong themes of "loyalty and
brotherhood" in the lives of samurai or others whose
principle motivator is shame. However, it is important to
distinguish between these themes and more universal
concepts of compassion. A samurai might go to great
lengths, even sacrifice himself, for the sake of aiding an
ally to destroy an enemy. This is "bonding" social capital,
in which individuals come closer by distinguishing
between themselves as a group and other groups. This
"loyalty and brotherhood" exists only because there is
genuine animosity towards others.
Of much more use to society and the interests of peace
is the existence of "bridging" social capital, which breaks
down barriers between groups and encourages cooperation on a much broader scale. The idea of men and
women as their "brother's keepers" is an appealing one,
but care must be taken that this bonding between individuals not be at the expense ofothers. How compassionate is my self-image as my brother's keeper ifI don't consider you my brother?

New Dorm name choice flawed
BY ARTHUR CHU

achul@swarthmore.edu

I'd like to take a few minutes just to register my personal protest against the choice of Alice Paul as the
namesake of the New Dorm.
Yes, Alice Paul was a suffragist and feminist politician remembered in the history books. However, apart
from, being an alumna she has little direct connection
with Swarthmore or the Swarthmore community.
Furthermore, it's questionable whether her life really
embodies the values we want to associate with the
Swarthmore name. Swarthmore students seem eager to
laud anyone whose job title includes the term 'activist,"
even though Paul's brand of activism espoused antiSemitic and racist views and bore all the negative strains
of elitist planned-society Progressivism of the early 20th
Century.

Swarthmore recognized the problems with openly
identifying our institution with Paul when it removed
her name from the WRC, a building that had already
been named for her at its founding (contrary to Student
Council's assertion that no Swarthmore building has
ever been named for a woman). If the college has changed
its mind about her, then the most appropriate action
would be to put her name back on the WRC in honor of
her work in women's rights and name the residence hall
after someone who actually stayed involved with
Swarthmore after graduation. Residency hall names
ought to reflect our school's sense of community and history, not be a litany of celebrities who happen to have
graduated from here else I'd expect to see many more

landmarks named after Michael Dukakis.
If we want to rectify the lamentable lack of buildings
named after females, there are better choices. Anyone
who knows anything about the history of Swarthmore
should know the name of Martha Ellicott Tyson, the
woman who organized the initial committee to create a
school on the banks of the Crum, without whom none of
us would be here. If Tyson is too obscure a choice, there's
also Lucretia Mott, who not only worked as an abolitionist and early suffragist but also worked on that initial
February 3, 2005

committee to found our school.
And if the current gender imbalance in building
names still allows us to recognize deserving males,
Frank Aydelotte, the founder of modern Swarthmore
the president who turned Swat from a football-and-cheerleaders party school for local Quaker kids into an academic powerhouse
deserves to have one building on
campus named for him, since he currently has none. And
there's certainly an argument to be made that commemorating Bernie Saffran with a dorm name would fulfill
the goal of choosing someone unconventional, honoring
a hardworking, passionate member of our community
who sought few personal honors
rather than a famous
alum who's had several books written about her life and
been played by Hilary Swank in a movie.
In any case I would respect the choice of Paul's name
more if it had both been better justified and if we as a student body had had more input. I acknowledge the donor
has purchased the right to make the final choice; however, if any "narrowing down" of names to a final list or
arguing pros and cons had to be done, I fail to see why
Student Council had the unilateral right to do it without
consulting us. It's our school, after all, and I'd think we'd
be intelligent enough to openlyparticipate in the process

rather than passively submitting names and letting our
student representatives deal with it, especially since
from their comments I find little to convince me that they
know or care much about the history of the school. I
mostly wonder why none of them seemed to be aware of
the history surrounding the removal of Paul's name from
the WRC or thought it important to present a strong
argument for putting Paul's name on the New Dorm

regardless.
Maybe I'm making a big deal out of a small issue, but
insofar as I care about being a Swattie and bearing the
Swarthmore name I care about whom we do and don't
honor. Was there no reason they couldn't have told us
what the final choices were and allowed us to publicly
comment on them, and put us in some kind of closer contact with the donor? I don't think I'm alone in feeling
myself poorly represented by Student Council in this
affair.

Lessons from Kenya: Coming to terms with identity
ERIKA DUPREE

Kenya is a land of many
contrasts. After living my
(Khendi's) whole life strictly

inside the U.S., the differences between living in
Kenya are many and vast.
Values R Us
The wonderful food along
with the beautiful environment and wildlife sets the
ironic backdrop for a legacy ofpoverty and corruption. My
experience, however, being an African-American whose
ancestors were slaves in the U.S. is much different from that
of my white colleagues or any person with living relatives
from Africa. I have spent a great deal of time in the rural
area ofKabondo from which Senator Barack Obama's father
originates as well as the city of Nairobi. My excitement
about getting out in Nairobi quickly turned to disappointment and confusion, mainly because of how I was treated by
Africans. I usually got ignored or glared at when I went into
stores, as opposed to my white companion, who was always
greeted. The most frustrating observation occurred when I
joined my white friends at a restaurant and I had to pay
before my drink was served, while they paid only after they
had finished and the bill had arrived. It gets worse. Some
places refuse to even serve Africans. In America, we would
call that discrimination, but I never imagined it would come

KHENDI WHITE

THE PHOENIX

from people who share my skin color. I have not been accustomed to this type of treatment in the U.S., though it does
exist between some whites and blacks. The interesting fact
is that I received much better treatment from whites (usually Europeans) in Africa. Something's awry.
Kenya, like most African countries, depends on tourism.
It makes up their second largest source of income, after agricultural exports like tea and coffee. White people are easy
targets, since they tend to be tourists with money to spend.
Everyone assumed I was Kenyan, thereby linking my color
and heritage to a lower socioeconomic status. In the rural
areas less visibly affected by the thrust of globalization, I
was generally received warmly. However, I was still perplexed by the fact that most people there did not even know
there was such a thing as a "real black American." It's not
about my treatment, however. The bigger picture is that
sweeping globalization and modernization have only
strained the unity between blacks in the greater diaspora.
On Swarthmore's campus, fortunately, we do have cohesion
between the African American and African students.
However, the global scene does not share this precedent. It is
clear to me that being black does not make me closer to
Africans than my white friends. Unfortunately, my experience so far has been that price comes before pride. These
Kenyans were willing to discriminate against their own people in order to preserve their profits, because of their per-

February 3, 2005

ception that Kenyans were poorer and more likely to steal.
Relating this back to Swarthmore College raises some
important questions. How does identity factor into different
aspects of the campus? What does the college sacrifice to
keep its identity? Isn't there some conflict in keeping this
identity while keeping the college running? Of course there
is, and even though that topic is most relevant to Khendi's
Kenyan experience, we will not discuss those issues now.
What we will discuss is how important it is that we go out of
our way to learn about one another. Sure, the discrimination
against one's own race going on in Kenyan towns is one that
is extreme, but Swatties are guilty of it too. That is, many of
us tend to form our small group offriends and never seek to
learn anything else about our own racial group.
Yes, I do realize that social interaction is not the strong
point of many of us here, but that is not a real excuse. Some
of us never really learn about one another, and that is too
bad, because several of us could benefit from the 'diversity"

that Swarthmore offers here. Some views students hold here
on diversity would be changed significantly if they got to
know their fellow Swattie. The college has a lot more to offer
than its academic program, and it's socially responsible to
take advantage of it while you are here.

The Garnet track teams faced a difficult chalon Sunday at the McElligott Invite at
Haverford College. Swarthmore's athletes not only
saw familiar rivals Haverford, but also went up
against The College of New Jersey, Elizabethtown,
Widener College and Bryn Mawr. Each school
brought an array of talented athletes to challenge
the Garnet in every event.
The men's squad showed promising team results
as it placed sixth in the distance medley. Even as
the runners look to improve their individual times,
they still form a cohesive unit for every relay. The
performance of each member on a relay team is just
as important as the overall group's unified mindset,
so the harriers develop a closeness while they try
different combinations during this indoor track

After my iced tea experiment, I witnessed one of the ultimate gastrointestinally-taxing battles of the year: The Glutton Bowl. Critics write off
this two-hour gorge-fest as an equivalent to programming failures like
Temptation Island. But I for one will stand up, unbuckle my belt and
agree with one of the commentators. It was truly "poetry in motion."
Thirty-five grown men and women were split into seven preliminary
rounds. The winner ofeach round chomped his way into the final round,
and the second place finishers squared off in a fight for the wild card
position. But the path to first place was no cakewalk (pun completely
intended). The prelims introduced vats of mayonnaise, tubs of hardboiled eggs and mountains of hotdogs, hamburgers and (a personal
favorite) a 15-footroll of sushi with two one-foot sections of pure wasabi.
Can you eat six sticks of butter in one minute? Not good enough;
the winner ate seven. Lard not your taste? How about over three
pounds of beef tongue? You wouldn't be the only one gagging.
According to commentators, some of the contestants had to deal with
lockjaw and "urges contrary to swallowing." Wild card qualifiers went
•m only to discover the passage to the final round was paved with
Rocky Mountain Oysters. Raw buffalo junk, indeed.
...

After surviving the onslaught of groceries, those possessing stom-

achs of slate moved on to the final. Vegans, vegetarians and those with
any morals, stop reading now. The final food of the evening: Cow

brain. Gray matter, white matter, it doesn't really matter. These guys
were in the zone, and they probably would have consumed my left arm
had they been given the opportunity.
At the end of two glorious hours, the number-one competitive
eater, 23-year-old, 130-pound Takeru "Tsunami" Kobayashi of Japan,
consumed 57 cow brains in 15 minutes to win the title. Declared by
some as the greatest athlete ever
because, hey, Michael Jordan
owns a steak house but doesn't consume six cows each night
Kobayashi added another medal to a pile that includes Nathan's Hot
Dog eating champ (52 hotdogs and buns in 12 minutes) and Rice Ball
champ (20 pounds in 30 minutes).
Not sick yet? Well, then joining the International Federation of
Competitive Eating (www.ifoce.com) might be for you. But are you old
enough, hungry enough, and do you really want to train with Tarble
chicken finger wraps? According to the IFOCE, speed-eating is for
those who are over 18 years old. "The IFOCE is against at-home training of any kind. The IFOCE strongly discourages younger individuals
from eating for speed or quantity under any circumstances." So the
first-years among us better chew at least 25 times before swallowing
anything from quiche bar.
I, for one, won't be training for anything Glutton-esque. Even if I
did, I think volleyball spring season training will ward off my efforts.
But as a fan of over-indulgence, I will support those who try.
Tomorrow at 6 a.m., I'll join some Willets Basement girls for a trip to
Philly's annual Wing Bowl. Last year Sonya "The Black Widow"
Thomas captured the $20,000 first-prize, consuming 167 wings. Can you
really pass up the opportunity to see a man who ate a one-and-a-half
pound Yankee Candle to qualify? What about the guy who ate 25
Twinkies in under five minutes? He needs love, too!
So skip the morning coffee and get a rush from the digestive delights
offered in Philly. Head over to the Wachovia Center around 7 a.m for
some barbeque goodness (or did I mean "grossness")? And look for me
with some bottles of Arizona Green Tea; I might just play along.

season.

On Sunday, the women mirrored the men as
their distance medley team finished strong, falling
just short of beating Bryn Mawr and settling for
second. The competition also gave Swat runners a
chance to participate in some events different than
what they are used to. "Last weekend's meet was a
good way to shake things up," Kavita Hardy 'OB
said.

The encouraging finish reflected the runners'
development, and the athletes are quickly improving in a short amount of time. While most runners
may enter the indoor season out of shape and looking to use the meets as practice for the spring season, Swarthmore's teams are demonstrating their
fast learning curve as they noticeably improve
from week to week.
The field athletes got their first opportunity to
shake off the winter rust and begin their indoor
season last weekend. With new faces in many
events, look for new stars to emerge as the Garnet
continues to build its field team. The squad hopes to
take a cue from the runners and start their own
"fast track" to success.
"The team's off to a wonderful start," Hardy
said, noting that a lack of injuries has been key to
the Garnet's success.

Is bowling a sport? Mysteries of the pins
The other day, I decided to solve all the pressing problems of the world. After working my way through hunger,
social inequality, God and love, I was about to declare success when I suddenly
found myself confronted
with
the
biggest question of all:
Is bowling a sport?
"Now, come on!" I
hear you say "That is,
like, the first thing
people think about

MATTHEW DRAPER

Rocks with Sticks

when they enter this
world. Before you
even know how to
walk, you've decided
if bowling is a sport or
not. Jeez! If you don't
have an answer by
now, meathead, why
should you even bother?" Be that as it may,
I believe that it is

always good to critique one's deep value systems, so here goes.
To begin, it is important to realize that, yes, we should
care if bowling is a sport. After all, I want you to read the
rest of this column. For one thing, the word "sport" is an
essential part of the English language, a word that has
come, in some respects, to replace "war." Distinguishing
bowling as a sport, therefore, automatically confers upon
bowlers the prestige afforded to others who, in our modern
world, represent and fight for the interests of people
you

know, like lawyers and politicians. To relegate bowling, on
the other hand, to the mere status of 'a game" makes it a
sideshow, something played by eccentrics in order to give
meaning to their otherwise drab and dull lives. On top of
that, calling bowling a sport will invariably help us to pad
our resumes. As the wise sage Jody Fisher 'O5 once said, "I
wish it were a sport. Then I could be a five-sport athlete."
Plus, if it is a sport, more people will come to bowling night
every Monday at 9 p.m. (Meet at Parrish Circle.)
There are two main arguments regarding the question
of bowling as sport or non-sport. The first school of thought
is based on the cultural principle that I just proposed,
namely that sports have come to replace war in our society, and so anything glorified as such should fall into the category of sport. You don't see any pro bowlers in those Nike
For Warriors," but I'd
ads advertising "Nike Apparel
wager that many of you have secretly wasted a Saturday
afternoon or two watching pro bowling on ESPN (you
know who you are!) and have, on occasion, become
engrossed in the battle, finding it almost as compelling as
that Eagles-Bengals game you once watched. It's not exactly the Super Bowl or the NCAA tournament, but bowling is
on TV, and it is occasionally interesting. According to
school of thought number one, TV brings bowling some
glory, so bowling is a sport. In this way, pro bowlers are
perhaps the war equivalent to those nerdy fighters who
spend hours in the forest fighting each other with booby
traps while the "real" battle takes place on the plain
between the cavalry and the Marines. In general, I like this
argument because it is sociological and because I made it
up. On the other hand, it has the tendency to become too
functionalist, i.e., if it's on ESPN it must be a sport, which
isn't necessarily true. (See bass fishing.)

The other school of thought comes from Eddie, my erstwhile tennis coach and resident of that beautiful state that
lies just across the U.S. border, between Arizona and Texas.
Eddie would argue passionately that a sport was only something in which one competitor could directly affect the performance of the other. In other words, in basketball, your
defense affects your opponent's offense, your offense their
defense and so on, making it a quintessential sport. In bowling, however, your shot never directly affects your opponent's shot, so it is not a sport; it is simply a game or a competition. This school of thought is made much stronger
when you add that a sport is not something that can be done
while smoking or eating, thus eliminating ping-pong and
beer pong from the list of sports, and simultaneously giving

bowling a second strike. The one flaw in this theory is that
it trivializes the mental gamesmanship that goes on in all
competitions. Bowling, like all other individual sports, can,
at the right moments, place its competitors under unique
pressure, pressure that is usually created by the performance of the other competitors.
Which leads me to the final answer. As those of you
who took Intro Psych with Barry Schwartz may know,
whenever there are proponents of two schools of thought
arguing over a question, the answer is invariably "Yes!"
Bowling is a sport and yet it isn't quite, because it is
rather like a competition that has taken on the form of a
sport because of cultural forces. In other words, my fellow
serenity seekers, the answers to life's questions are never

Stop complaining about the lack of attractive girls
at Swarthmore and head down to Tarble Pavilion
sometime, because the women's basketball team isn't
just hot, it's on fire. The Garnet has now won seven
games in a row, a streak that moves it into the fourthplace spot in the Centennial Conference standings as
the race toward the playoffs begins. With wins in the
last week against Bryn Mawr and Lincoln, the Garnet
improved to 12-6, 84 in conference play.
Against the Owls on Saturday, Karen Berk 'OB continued her hot-handed shooting, leading the team by
far with 27 points and contributing eight rebounds.
The Garnet got off to a quick start in the game, shooting 50 percent in the first half and going into the break
leading 38-20 over a Bryn Mawr team that has struggled with scoring all season. Despite struggling with
shooting in the second half, Swarthmore handily
wrapped up the game by a score of 63-36, almost mirroring their 64-32 victory over the Owls at home earli-

er last month. Jennifer Stevenson 'O6 added nine

points against the Owls, and Alison Wolff 'O5 led the
Garnet with 10 rebounds.
"We were able to handle [Bryn Mawr] pretty easily," Wolff said. The Garnet's large margin of victory
allowed many of the younger players a chance to get
off the bench for significant playing time. "Everyone
stepped up and got to play," Wolff said.
On Tuesday night, the Garnet traveled to Lincoln
University for a non-conference matchup against the 410 Lyons. Once again, Swarthmore took control of the
game early and led at halftime by a 34-22 margin. The
Garnet capitalized on free throw opportunities in the
second halfand put the Lyons away 66-49. Jessica Fuhr
'O7 had a career high 17 points, and Stevenson also finished in double figures with 1L Berk led the team with
10 rebounds, eight of them on the defensive end.
"Our attitude is really positive right now," Erica
Lukoski 'OB said. "We're working well together."
The Garnet's success is even more impressive
considering that Radiance Walters 'O6, the team's
leading scorer and rebounder, has been out for the
past three games with a head injury. Walters, who
with 10.6 boards per game is second in the conference, may be back for Saturday's game, and the team
will definitely need her.
Swarthmore will be counting on momentum to

carry it through the weekend, when the team travels
to Dickinson to take on the conference-leading Red
Devils in a key match. The Garnet last faced off
against Dickinson on Jan. 8 and lost a heartbreaking
home game by a slim margin of 54-52. This time, emotions will be running high as Swarthmore looks to
avenge that loss.
"We just have to come in focused and not be intimidated," Wolff said.
Swarthmore will be counting on the continued big
play of its defense to stop the Red Devils. With an average of 49.2 points allowed in conference games and 501
overall, the Garnet are leading the conference in
defense and ranked 14th among all Division 111 teams.
Swarthmore's next home game will be Tuesday at
7 p.m. against Muhlenberg, so stop your whining and

head down to the court. That's where the fire's at.

Garnet displays mastery of shuttlecock in win
BY MARIA CRISTINA HERRERA

Domination. That's what the varsity bad-

minton team is all about at Swat. The squad
went into "dominatrix mode" on Monday

night, whipping Albright and Haverford.
Ninja-like lunges and panther-quick reflexes
allowed the Garnet to execute an efficient,
painless victory.

Jessica Larson 'O6 and Candice Cherk 'O7
demonstrated their flawless game with accuracy and nimble offense in the doubles game
against Albright. "Jessica and Candice had a
great rhythm. They made great decisions
and they never let their opponents into the
match. They were ready to play," Assistant
Coach Jeremy Loomis said. Their powerful

blows and zen-like teamwork took over the
match right away, resulting in a 15-2 shellacking in both games.
The fans were as excited as Loomis. "Shut
down!" Andrew Lim 'O5 said after the shuttlecock was powerfully returned to the
Albright side. According to Loomis, the pair
is known for their shot-making ability.
Larson won the first two matches in the
singles set against an Albright platyer, 11-6
and 11-2 in the second game. "The girl I
played from Albright I had played several
times before," Larson said. "I'm used to playing her; I was confident. The rest of Albright
seemed competitive but I think we played
well. Our doubles team came through."
In her set against Haverford, Larson
showed a Darth Vader-esque lack of mercy,
prevailing by a score of 11-0 in both games.
Larson attributed her slaying to her passionate feelings about the Fords.
Cherk also tallied a quick victory with a
score of 11-1 in both Albright singles games.
Her games against Haverford were equally
brutal. "It was quick and painless for us,"

In the Haverford doubles match, Patricia
Kelly 'OB and Kannie Chim 'O7 suffered the
wrath of a ruthless pair and scores of 0-15
and 1-15.
Despite these two hard losses, the match
felt "really good," according to Parikh.

Gettysburg brings Swat swimmers' win streaks to a halt
BY PHIL LEE
pleel@swarthmore.edu
Not all winning streaks last forever.

Both the men's and women's swim teams
suffered their first conference losses of the
season last weekend against undefeated
Gettysburg squads.

The Garnet women fell by a score 144-61
against the Bullets on Saturday, falling to 54 and 3-1 in the Centennial Conference,
while the men lost 143-63 to even their
record at 4-4, with a 3-1 conference record.
Both squads were not in the best condition
they were not able to win more than
three events thoughout the entire meet.
In the men's events, Andrew Frampton
'OB won both the 500 and 1000 yard freestyle
in times of 5:00.24 and 10:09.90, respectively.
Unfortunately, though, he was the only
winner on the team, as the Garnet lost nine
out of 11 events.
In the women's events, Michelle Horn
'O7 won the 200 breaststroke with a time of
2:3412, marking the only win for the Garnet
women.
What could possibly account for this
heavy a loss? "It has been two weeks since
we left the training trip. We did some
heavy training there, and so our muscles
are slowly starting to recover," Coach Sue

Davis said. "The Gettysburg meet has had
a history of being frustrating just because
of the timing. Our players cannot be at
their best conditions after only two weeks

of rest," she said.
This explains the Garnet's record of winning three of its past 22 contest against the

Bullets. Gettysburg's strength is illustrated
by its conference-leading record of 4-0 for
the men and 5-0 for the women. For the
Garnet to have been able to win, they needed to be in peak condition, both physically
and mentally. Yet, with the harsh workouts
the swimmers endured during the winter
training session, the swimmers' weren't yet
able to match the powerful Bullets.
With this in mind, the outlook for the
upcoming Dickinson meet is not particularly positive either. "Dickinson is going
to be another close one," Davis said.
"Again, the timing of this meet is going to
have a huge affect on our performance."

The Garnet will host Dickinson this
coming Saturday at Ware Pool. Like
Gettsyburg, the Red Devils are one of the
stronger squads in the conference. A
Garnet win in this meet will depend on a
mixture of muscular recovery and psy-

chological strength.
Yet, despite the slightly negative outlook toward the next meet, the Garnet is
