BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Sherman Alexie's literature,
biting and lyrical, is a mainstay
of the modern American Indian

of Indian identity and reservation life. In his most recent poetry collection, "One Stick Song,"
Alexie writes, "Thesis: I have
never met a Native American.
Thesis repeated: I have met thousands of Indians." The word, he

film screenwriter and, most
recently, film director, Alexie
pairs up with Jim Boyd, the songwriter and lead singer of the allIndian band Rez Bound, for a performance in LPAC at 7:30 tonight.
The event is sold out, but "there
will be a waiting list at the theatre
on the night of the event for any
unclaimed seats," according to
the LPAC reservations Web site.
His appearance at Haverford

last year seemed less an academic lecture than a cynical stand-up
comedy routine shot through
with bitter politics. Alexie affect-

to vegetarians for not knowing
what starvation was like, and put
the troublesome topic of newagey Indian imitators on display
for the audience, which he
addressed as though it were made

up of all white Christian men.
Alexie, who lives in Seattle

Student Council launches
pilot for new course guide
SC plans to make evaluation guide for courses by this fall

When Swarthmore students check their mailboxes this afternoon, they will find the first of what
Student Council hopes to be many initiatives this
semester.

The council is distributing four class recommendation forms per student in an attempt to create a course evaluation book.
This form, the product of months of debate
among the council mebers, will provide students
with the opportunity to rate the quality of the classes they took last semester in numerous categories,
along with a chance for students to provide addi-

classes and discussion classes and to rate the
assigned readings. Then, the form asks students to
estimate the of hours of work assigned outside of
class. Finally, the form asks the students to rate the
availability of the professor and the difficulty of the
class. There is ample space for other comments on
the form.
Council members claim these forms are really
just a rough draft for a larger project. "We don't
think they are perfect," Rice said. "We want to get
feedback on the form. We want know what we've
left out and if they are confusing."
Once the forms are returned to the council by

This nearby reservoir is just one of the many water beds between
here and upstate New York that is suffering from drought conditions.

Water restrictions
affect college fields
Gov. announced emergency last Tuesday
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
After months of little precipitation and increasingly dry weather,
Pennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker declared a drought emergency throughout the eastern counties of the state on Feb. 12. This
measure will have adverse effects on Swarthmore's grounds and athletic facilities.
Here in Delaware County, within the area of drought emergency, the
college is facing numerous water restrictions with the threat of more
to come if the region does not see above-average rainfall soon.
Currently, the maintenance of athletic facilities is the most pressing
water-related issue facing the college. According to the Chester Water
Authority, grass athletic fields can only be watered once a week
between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., according to a predetermined

schedule.

"This drought puts a tremendous amount of stress on the athletic
fields," Associate Director of Athletics Adam Hertz said. "This also
increases the potential for long term damage to the fields and can pose
a serious injury risk to athletes."
Hertz explained that, if the drought were to worsen over the next
few months, the field conditions would deteriorate drastically. He cited
a lack of grass regrowth and redevelopment as well as the threat of
extremely dry and hard patches of ground developing on the fields. The
latter, he said, could represent an injury risk if "an athlete were to step
on one of these patches and twist [his or her] ankle."
For the Scott Arboretum, however, the drought has minimal consequences. Jeffrey Jabco, assistant director of horticulture for the
arboretum, explained that, as a museum collection, the arboretum has
special water exemptions. "In terms of drought restrictions, we can
still water arboretum collections," Jabco said. "However, we are only
allowed to water plants and trees that are part of the collection.
Anything on campus outside of the arboretum must adhere to the

drought restrictions."
Jabco explained that the biggest issue facing grounds maintenance
will be the replanting process beginning in a few weeks. "We're concerned that, if we don't have much rain soon, it will affect plants later
this season," he said. "When we go to do planting in the spring, we're
worried about how we're going to sustain the plant life through the

summer."
If drought conditions do not improve, grounds maintenace will be
the least of students' concerns. With water levels close to all-time lows,
people living in the drought area will soon be faced with very harsh
water restrictions.
The region's drinking water comes from the Delaware River Basin.

Lifelong Learning program debuts

Retiring professor heads up college effort to offer not-for-credit classes to local adults and alumni
BY SETH SIAS
ssiasl@swarthmore.edu

As physics professor John Boccio dissected Newton's laws of conservation of
momentum, student Ed Harris jumped in
with a thought about relativity. His comment inspired a question from another

student: "What about frames of reference?"
Boccio, who has been teaching physics
for 35 years, was happy to mediate the
lively discussion that followed among the
14 students in this class
some in their
seventies and eighties
who are participating in the first semester of classes
offered at Swarthmore for alumni and

local residents.
The brainchild of classics professor Gil
Rose, the new Lifelong Learning program
is starting with two courses, Boccio's
"Aristotle, Galileo and Einstein: Spacetime, Gravity and Black Holes," or classics professor Gil Rose's "Homeric Models
of Heroism." The two courses garnered a
total of 28 students, each of whom is paying $5OO in tuition. Classes are held on
evenings and weekends on campus.
"There's a lot of desire for reinvigorating one's life by means of education," said
Rose. And, as he approached his own
retirement, he thought, "Wouldn't it be
nice to have this added variety in my
teaching?"
Originally, the program had scheduled
a third multidisciplinary course on the
post-Sept. 11 world, but it was cancelled
due to lack of enrollment. Rose said he
thought that people may have "had it up
to here with discussion of these events."

But he's hoping to expand the program

next semester.
Lifelong Learning students, unlike
undergraduates, are not taking classes to
satisfy a requirement. "There is no
reward structure. The reward is purely
learning," Boccio said. His students, who
ranged in age from about 30 to 80, said
they enrolled to satisfy old yearnings, to
exercise their minds or to have fun.
Dale Larrimore '72 is taking Boccio's
physics class, he said, because he "would
like to be able to understand" what his
daughter, a physics major, will be doing
for the rest of her life.
"I never really knew I was interested
in physics until after I graduated from
college," said May Lynn Rossi, who made
time for the Saturday afternoon class
between the demands of her job and her
children. While she is "a little worried
about the paper" that all students are
expected to write at the end of the class,
she figures she manage it if she devotes
four hours a week to course work.
For Harris, who noticed he wasn't as

sharp after a serious car accident a few
years ago, the class is a way to keep in
shape mentally. "The brain is like any
other muscle," he said. "If you exercise it
you can make it stronger."
Shep Houston '66 echoed Harris' comments. She is taking the class to give her
"brain a kick in the pants," The first day
of class, she said, she sensed that the "old
synapses were firing again."
Houston, who lives in Philadelphia,
said her only complaint is that the program hasn't been publicized enough to
alums in the rest of the area.

Deans question merits of outdoor orientation program
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
Members of the Tri-College Outdoor Orientation
Program (TrOOP) have continued their push to become an
established, institutionally run organization. Despite the
panel presentation TrOOP hosted last Tuesday, their
future remains in doubt.
The mixed views given by the panel's members reflect
the mixed reaction that TrOOP has received since its
founding in fall 2000. Christine Hancock 'O2, with the help
of Ari Houser 'Ol, began TrOOP by proposing the idea of a
wilderness orientation program to the Outsiders Club.
The students felt that similar programs had been successfully established at many other colleges and would be
a beneficial addition to the current orientation program at
Swarthmore. Since then, they have trained leaders, run a
pilot program over fall break, expanded the program to
Bryn Mawr and Haverford, met with deans and faculty at
all three schools and begun their leader training course for
the coming year.

The panel, called "Creating a Tri-College Wilderness
was composed of speakers from the three colleges and Gettysburg
College. Christine Hancock 'O2, one of the founders of
TrOOP, spoke about its history. Then lan Kysel 'O4 gave a
speech on the group's philosophy and how it relates to the
Quaker ideals on which the three colleges were founded.
Kysel described his speech as connecting "outdoor education to the three schools' conception of learning."
After Kysel spoke, the director of the Gettysburg
College outdoor program and two of his student leaders
explained how their program works.
Amy Campbell, director of athletics and physical education at Bryn Mawr, then voiced her support of instituting a more permanent program. Later, Campbell said,
"There are challenges of resources, funding and leadership, defining the kind and scope of programs that are
appropriate. These issues are important and must be

addressed but are structural and don't take away from or
in any way minimize the value of outdoor programs."
Steven Watter, a Haverford dean, felt very differently.
Although he mentioned the structural challenges
Campbell had talked about, Watter focused not on the positive value of TrOOP but on the reasons not to have a
wilderness program. He seemed discouraged and was especially concerned with the problem of funding. A prepared
statement from Adrienne Shibles, Swarthmore's staff representative for TrOOP, was also read.
The group's goal for next year is to run six trips this
fall, each with 10 freshmen. TrOOP has the leaders and the
interest from other students, Hancock said. They just need
to secure financial backing from all three schools.

"I wouldn't say [TrOOP] pertains
directly to Swarthmore's central mission. We are very much an intellectual community, and that's our niche."
Dean Tedd Goundie
This backing will not be easy to obtain. Hancock said
that, while TrOOP's fall break trip was funded through the
discretionary fund of Dean of the College Bob Gross '62, it
has been difficult to find support since then. According to
Hancock, the deans have refused to fund them, citing
budget freezes. "We have been asking to present at the
Dean's Advisory Committee all fall and all semester thus
far," she said. "But the meeting has apparently not been
scheduled, and we have not been directed toward other
funding sources."
Gross admitted that, due to budget problems, the college probably would not be able to fund the program. "The
funding issue is a serious one right now," he said. Gross

February

2% 2002

explained that his discretionary fund is quite limited,.
Right now SL2 million worth of projects are competing for
the $200,000 available in the budget, he said.

Zac Steele 'O4, another one of TrOOP's chief coordinators, is frustrated with the deans' response. He feels that
TrOOP could broaden the learning experience at
Swarthmore considerably. "Swarthmore and other colleges talk a lot about what it is to learn as a full person,
but, at least at Swarthmore, it's kind of one-sided," he said.
Steele is concerned that the school has become far too
focused on academics, to the exclusion of other important
elements of education. "I've talked to people, both students
and administrators, that are frustrated with the lack of
money for student funding," he said. "I feel that there is so
much emphasis on maintaining academic standards, other
things get trashed."
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie did not say much to
dispute Steele's claim that the college is overly focused on
academics. Where institutional support is concerned, he
said, academics will always come first. In reference to
wilderness programs, he said, "I do think there's value in
all of that, but I wouldn't say it pertains directly to
Swarthmore's central mission. We are very much an intellectual community, and that's our niche."

Goundie discredited Tr OOP's claim that the program
could be tied to the central mission of this school. "To me,
that's a bit of a stretch," he said.
Another complaint Steele had was that the deans are
often unclear, making it hard to tell if they even want this
program to happen. "It's hard for us to know what direction we should go in and what we need to do to make the
program happen, because we don't get a lot of feedback
from the deans," he said.
Rachel Thomas 'O5 has met with Gross to discuss
TrOOP and agreed with Steele's sentiments. "I'm very confused where we stand with the deans," she said. "I don't
feel that we've gotten a clear response about the future of
TrOOP." Thomas feels that this lack of communication is
hindering TrOOP's development process.

A Story of Self-Determination

Borough residents attack
college plans for land use
BY ELIZBABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

The presentation to Borough
Council of the college's long-term
recomendations for using its land last
night was prefaced by the hope that a
"win-win outcome" would be reached
after extensive dialogue.
But several borough residents with
varying degrees of connection to the
college noted their concerns about the
college's plans, some vehemently.
Concerns involved mainting the
integrity of residential neighborhoods
on the college periphery, traffic and
parking problems, as well as the lack of
clarity on the connection between land
plans and the proposed inn.
The college recommendations, prepared by the Land Use Planning
Committee, point to pieces of collegeowned land where it may be possible to
expand the campus in the future. The
committee also outlined a set of principles, such as maintaining the green and
residential character of the campus,
that the college will use to guide landuse policy in the future.
The majority opinion of the committee is available online at www.lanMichael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

duse.swarthmore.edu. Religion professor Mark Wallace was the dissenting
member of the committee. Last night,

he presented his specific opposition to
the college's recommendations to place

insitutional buildings in currently resi-

dential neighborhoods.
Students had an opportunity to hear

the recommendations last Wednesday
night. Those who attended posed questions about possible plans to increase
enrollment and the likelihood of turn-

into athletic fields.
Committee Co-Chairs Larry Schall
'75, vice president of facilities, and
ing land

engineering professor Carr Everbach

both emphasized that there are no concrete plans to expand the college or
build anything beyond the projects now
underway, such as the science center.
Use of the Crum Woods is not currently before the land use committee,
but Everbach, who is also a member of
the Crum Stewardship Committee, said
there would be very careful consideration before recommendations are made
about the undeveloped land the college
owns across Crum Creek.
Faculty, some of whom would be
directly affected by one of the committee's recommendations that could pave
the way for permitting academic or

office buildings on land currently used

for faculty housing, had heard the recommendations two weeks before.

Staff, students discuss financial aid policies
BY REIKO TESHIBA

keshibl@swarthmore.edu
College administrators and students
a fireside chat Tuesday night to
discuss how financial aid works beyond the
pass of paperwork that students are
required to fill out.
Student Council sponsored the fireside
chat in light of its new commitment to various financial aid issues this semester. With
about 20 students in attendance, Jim Bock
90, dean of admissions and financial aid,
and Laura Talbot, director of financial aid,
answered questions from both students who
receive aid and those who do not.
Among key concerns addressed were
how financial aid is determined, how the
amount changes from year to year, and compensation for students whose aid from the
federal government has been restricted
because of drug-related convictions. Other
gathered at

concerns

included international admis-

sions, what happens when parents refuse to
Pay or are separated, and how financial aid
evaluations can be appealed.
A number of factors are important in
determining how much financial aid students receive. In addition to the students'
summer earnings and savings, the parents'
ability to pay is measured. Talbot said the
[Parents' share is dependent on their "capacto pay over time." Family size, where the
family resides, medical expenses and care
fer the elderly are also important factors.
In response to the recent interest in stulosing their federal aid because of
convictions, Talbot said the college

have faced past drug convictions will have
financial aid suspended for either one or two
years. The penalty depends upon the severity of the conviction. However, the Board of
Managers intends to review this policy
soon.
"We are committed to meeting demonstrated need," Talbot said. "Swarthmore will
aid students who have forfeited the funds."
Ryan Budish 'O4 brought up the issue of
whether financial aid is reduced from the
first year to subsequent years. Talbot
explained that every student is evaluated
every year, taking into account that a family's financial situation changes from year to
year. The financial aid office assesses students' summer earnings, earnings from
work during the academic year, loans and
scholarships. Students' summer earnings
are projected higher starting sophomore
year because college summers are longer.
Depending on the family's financial situation, the loan component of an aid package
can fluctuate.
Talbot said there is no financial aid
appeal process, but for families that request
reconsideration a similar process takes

Bloodletting in Upper Tarble

College begins
search for new
director of IC
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
nbrundal@swarthmore.edu

In the coming weeks, the college will begin its search for
director for the Intercultural Center on campus.
Though the Intercultural Center Director Search
Committee, which will spearhead the process, has yet to
have its first meeting, several members who have already
been chosen shared a common vision of the critical character traits they look for in the new director. Most important were sensitivity, creativity and the ability to deal with
the various cultures, ethnicities and sexual preferences
that inhabit the Swarthmore campus.
Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw
will head the committee, which will also include three student members, William Tran 'O3, Sonal Bhatia 'O2 and
Elinore Kaufman 'O4. Student Council appointed the students earlier this week, but Smaw said the other staff and
administrative members of the committee are yet to be
determined,
"The director is very important to the goals and mission
of the IC," Tran said. "I want someone who will commit."
The new director will be the permanent replacement for
Anna Maria Cobo, who resigned in the spring of 2001, and
will take on all her previous responsibilities, serving both
as the director of the IC and as an assistant dean. Current
IC Director Meghna Bhagat was hired as a temporary
replacement for the 2001 - 2002 academic year, but she was
not given the position of assistant dean. The college did not
hire a permenant replacement at the time because the
administration wanted to wait until they had hired a dean
of multicultural affairs.
Committee members stressed that the IC director is a
vital component of both the IC and the Swarthmore campus, and they want make sure he or she will be capable of
dealing with all of Swarthmore's multicultural community.
"We're looking for a person who has a sound understanding of the issues faced by groups in the center and
someone who is sensitive to the needs and emotions of multicultural students on the Swarthmore campus," Smaw

Early decision grows at Ivies
BY N.F.S. KNIGHT
The Dartmouth (Dartmouth College)
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.
Despite growing concerns about the fairness of early decision, its use continues to proliferate throughout the Ivy League, with some
schools filling half of their incoming freshman slots with

early applicants.
The most dramatic increase came at the University of
Pennsylvania, where 50 percent of its freshman class will
be admitted early this year, up from 43 percent last year.
Columbia, accepting 490 students, admitted 49 percent of
its incoming class early. It saw a 6.5 percent increase in
the number of early applicants and its early admission
acceptance rate was 29 percent.
The growing popularity of early decision has raised
many serious questions. Recent criticism has arisen that
early decision favors affluent students over students in
financial need. This is because early decision does not
allow students in need of financial aid to weigh offers
from other schools. Once accepted under the program, a
student must attend regardless of better financial aid
offers at other institutions. For this reason, most early
decision applicants tend to be from relatively affluent
backgrounds.
"My own feeling is that we should not go beyond 35
percent because we want to keep a large proportion of the
freshman pool open to regular decision applicants. Some
schools go higher because they want to make their admissions statistics better," Dartmouth Dean of Admissions
Karl Furstenburg said.
Dartmouth accepted 387 early applicants out of a pool
of UlB. At 35.5 percent of the Class of 2006, that's 2.5 percent more than were admitted under the early decision
program last year. Harvard accepted 1J.72 early applicants
out of a pool of 6,126. Last year, it accepted UO5 early applicants out of a total 6,096. Brown, which this year switched
from an early action program to an early decision program, accepted 510 'o6s early. It witnessed a decrease in

the number of early applicants, probably as a result of its
admission policy switch. On the other hand, Brown's

early acceptance rate increased by 5 percent to 26 percent.
Now that Brown has adopted an early decision policy,
the only remaining Ivy League school not to offer such a
program is Harvard.
"We have a non-binding program," Harvard Director of
Admissions Marilyn McGrath Lewis said. "We oppose
early decision because it causes a student's chance to compare financial aid to be a problem. It is a rich kid's game
if there ever was one."
Despite such criticism, most of the nation's top schools
continue to implement early decision programs, which
Lewis said results from concerns about student yield.
Furstenburg agrees that early decision slants in favor of
the more affluent applicants. For that reason, he believes
that it is important not to take a large percentage of the

freshman class early.
"On the other hand," he said, "if we took fewer students early than we do now, that would undermine our
whole program. If we artificially cut back, then we will be
hurting students who had done their homework and chosen Dartmouth as their first choice."
While acknowledging in a USA Today opinion column
that "the early decision program is not for everyone,"
University of Pennsylvania Dean of Admissions Lee
Stetson supports early decision.
Stetson defended early decision as an opportunity for
the students who most want to attend a university to do
so.
"It is a lot like a happy relationship. Both parties are in
it because they want to be and because each party knows
the other wants it just as much," he wrote.
Ultimately, Furstenburg said that the early decision
game is about the self-preservation of schools that are
worried about maintaining their reputations in the competitive admissions environment of today.
"Colleges are looking out for themselves more than
anything else," he said.

said.

Tran agreed, emphasizing the need for a director who
was "familiar with and comfortable with working with different types of students."
He also stressed that the new director should be someone able to effectively circumvent the somtimes tricky
waters between students and administration. "I personally
feel that, for the IC students, the IC director is the person
they're in contact with all the time," he said. "So the IC
director has to be able to work with the students, not just
the administration."
Bhatia expressed similar sentiments. "The new director
should be able to be a part of every group in some way," she
said.
Tran said he felt that it was particularly important that
the new IC Director be comfortable with dealing with the
needs and issues associated with Swarthmore's queer community. He stressed that, at many other schools, intercultural centers do not include student queer groups, but that
SQU's inclusion in the college's IC is "one thing that is special about Swat that needs to be considered."
In addition, Bhatia said, it is important that the new IC
director recognize that there are other minority groups on
campus who don't work with the IC, such as Deshi and the
student Korean organization.
"I want to make sure that the interests of these groups
don't get ignored," she said, emphasizing that the new
director should be "very approachable and creative" in
order to effectively meet the needs of these smaller but
equally important cultural groups.
Though the IC's two previous directors were both members of one or more of the minority groups represented
within the IC, Smaw said this was not a prerequisite for the

position.
"We're looking for the best person for the job," he said.
According to Smaw, the college hopes to have a new
director hired and settled in at the college by the start of the
next academic year. Though he stressed that the process
was just starting, he said he planned to "move the search as
quickly as possible to have someone on for Sept. L"

Mediators try to move away from 'faceless' image SC plans
BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu

After six years of faculty and staff direction, a new student leadership is revamping
the peer mediation program in an effort to
give it a broader appeal among the student
body.

"If you look at our old brochure, it's not
very sexy, not very appealing to students,"
said Kat Melville 'O4, who sits on the program's steering committee. "It really looks
like it came from the administration."

The peer mediation program, which typically handles four to five cases per semester,
matches two trained student, faculty or staff
mediators with members of the college community who request the free service. The
actual process begins with an hour- to an
hour-and-a-half-long mediation session at
which all parties are present.
The leadership, composed entirely of students, assumed control of the group at the
beginning of last semester, when Dean of
Residential
Life Myrt Westphal and
Administrative Assistant Rose Maio, who

both created the program six years ago,
stepped down from the organization's steering committee.
"In the fall, Rose and I said 'We're ready to
hand over the reins,' Westphal said. "It was
kind of like a 'been there, done that' sort of
thing. At first, there wasn't particularly any"

one on the faculty or staff who would take it
on, but then the students that were on the
steering committee with us came forward
and said, 'We want to take control and make
this group more approachable, less mysterious.'

"

The new leadership has attempted to draw
more cases by publicizing the fact that the
program is now student-run.
"I think there was somewhat of a stigma
that was attached to program because it went
through the deans' office," steering committee member Frank Sersale 'O2 said. "The idea
is to make it more accessible to students by
getting rid of that. It's now a service for students, by students."
Although staff and faculty members are
still available to serve as mediators, the new
student leadership believes that it is crucial
for students to view the program as peer-

run.

"As a result of it being run by members of
the staff and faculty, students didn't feel as
comfortable coming to us," steering commit-

tee member Andy Wong 'O2 said. "The idea
was that, if it was student-run, students
would feel more compelled to use it."
The steering committee has made a number of significant changes to the program,
such as posting the names, numbers and email accounts of mediators in an effort to
make the program more user-friendly.
"The way the program was run, you didn't

know the names of the mediators. They were
just these anonymous people," Melville said.
"It would be very hard to trust some faceless
person. This way, if you'd feel most comfortable contacting someone you know or have
just seen around and know by reputation, you
have that option. We're trying to emphasize
that these are real people."
The new system is also far more time-efficient compared to the old one.
"The whole process is different," Melville
said. "We had a special voice mailbox that we
checked, but it was never a live person on the
phone, and whoever got the message would
have to contact the person who called, the
other person in the dispute, the mediators,
and then the mediators would have to call the
disputants, and all in all, it just took too long

A RENTER'S WQRST NIGHTMARE:

Dry fields a possible threat to athletes
From DROUGHT, pg. 3
federal official and the governors of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware, reported water deficiencies of up to 11
inches in Delaware County over the last few months.
"Some Pennsylvania counties need to receive amounts of precipitation up to six to 12 inches above normal," Clarke Rupert,
spokesman for the Delaware River Basin Commission, said.
"Unfortunately, since the middle of December, we have not even
received normal amounts of precipitation, let alone the above normal
that we need."

Though the water shortage does not affect most people now, the
commission warns that signs point to a severe drought as spring
approaches. "This is a bad time of year for a drought," Rupert said. "It
might be hard for some people to fully understand the drought situation we are in because we don't have the visual clues such as brown
lawns and leaves falling in the middle of the summer."

"We're worried about how we're going to
sustain the plant life through the summer."
Jeff Jabco, arboretum assistant director
If the situation does not drastically improve over the next few
weeks, the commonwealth will have to impose severe water restrictions and rationing, Theodore Pawlik said. Pawlik, the director of
human resources at the Chester Water Authority, explained that, if
drought conditions do not subside, Pennsylvania citizens will probably face restrictions across the board on everyday water usage, including showers, dish washing and tap water use.
Although officials are optimistic in their predictions of future
water restrictions, Rupert said that recent precipitation forecasts do
not bode well for the area. "Delaware county has received three-tenths
of an inch of precipitation in February," he said. "Departure from normal is greater than 75 percent below the monthly average. If this trend
does not improve, we may be in for a long-term water emergency."
For now, people residing in the drought areas are reminded to use
water wisely. "It is important for everyone to realize that this is a
severe drought situation," Rupert said. "We ask people not to take that
long shower and not to let the tap water run throughout bathroom

It's part of the anxiety and thrill of course
selection. Swatties everywhere anxiously
hang on every word of that upperclassman
ranting or raving about a seminar, PDC or
other class, hoping the small tidbits of wisdom will translate into a great course schedule for the upcoming semeseter. Before you
register for any class, you want some assurance that the reading is interesting and that
the professor is not a sadist. You ask your
friends and try to talk to people who have
taken the class before, but eventually you
need to take a leap of faith that the class is
what you want.

have some tragic flaw or annoying feature.
But there's one thing Screw has that course
selection doesn't: The Cygnet.
No, we're not suggesting the creation of a
booklet with pictures and bios of Swarthmore
professors. We're talking about a course evaluation guide, where students evaluate classes
they've taken so that others might benefit
from the advance knowledge that one course
has reams and reams of reading or that
another is mostly lecture. It is under this
premise that Student Council is attempting to
put together a comprehensive guide to this

year's classes. Today you'll be getting sheets
in your mailbox asking you to rate the classes
you took last semester in categories such as

the instructor's approachablility or the quality of the readings. It also asks how many
hours of work were required outside of class.
The idea is that the book would tell you what
to expect from a course before you get there
on the first day of classes.
Although the course evaluation booklet
sounds great in theory, there are some problems with the pilot the council has started.
Although it is useful to know whether the
student rating the course was a major or nonmajor, and for whom the course is recommended, the form seems geared only toward
humanities and social sciences classes.
The course evaluation booklet would be
made available in places like McCabe and the
registrar's office, but not online. Although it
might be harder to start, an online version of
the guide would be easier maintain and
update, and more students would be likely to
use it. It would also waste less paper.
And, finally, there are some who are
against having the course evaluations at all.
They suspect that students would only evaluate courses vindictively, skewing the
results.
Despite a few faults, it is a positive step to
institutionalize the system of course evaluation that we all practice.

V-Day only a guise of feminism
Dear Editor:
"If your vagina could talk, what would it say?" This is
among the questions that were asked of us by provocative
sidewalk chalkings promoting this past weekend's presentation of "The Vagina Monologues" and the observance of "V-

Day."
But perhaps a better question might be: Why do we want to
hear vaginas talk instead of women? Why have we, despite
our best efforts to empower and celebrate women, instead conflated,
or worse, replaced,

women's identity with women's
sexuality?
I, like many other people on
this campus, adamantly support
the
sexual empowerment
of
women. Throughout
history,
women's sexuality has been cornmodified, stigmatized or denied,
of
and despite significant advances
our society still feels the impact of
this repression. Attempts
and clearly there have been
many
to liberate women from confining sexual roles are
both necessary and commendable. Women should, of course,
take the same pride in their bodies and their sexualities that
men do. But even well-intentioned attempts to legitimize and
celebrate female sexuality risk obscuring the most essential
truth about it: Female sexuality does not represent a woman
any more completely than male sexuality represents a man.

One of the primary ills decried by feminists is the objectification of women: treating a woman's body or a part of a
woman's body as though it represented her, thus treating that
woman as little more than a sexual object. Objectification lies
at the foundation of troubling phenomena such as violence
against women and the disproportionate number of women
diagnosed with depression in the United States (about twice
as many as men).
V-Day was intended to be an event that celebrated female
i^^^^^™l
empowerment and fought to end violence against women. Yet the women
seemed to recede into the background,
replaced by the vagina in the public
consciousness. Although V-Day included an impressive number of constructive feminist events, these events were

lost in the emphasis on sex; the sad
fact is that we pay more attention to
sex than to the constellation of other
issues related to sexual inequality.
Despite its good intentions, V-Day allowed the vagina to represent the woman, unwittingly reducing women to the status
of sexual objects. This particular brand of "pussy power"
objectification, under its current guise as feminism, is more
pernicious even than a direct attack against women, since it
is so willingly accepted without critical thought being given
to its true implications and consequences.

Opinions

The vandal within
It's easy to tell when Swarthmore is about to celebrate a gender politics holiday. Just look down. When Coming Out Week
approaches, the colored chalk comes out of the closet and the
sidewalks pay homage to homosexuality. On V-Day, the pavement was festooned with vagina tributes. Ordinarily, one must
call a 1-900 number in order to hear a woman's nether regions
praised so explicitly.
When chalkings of this sort appear on campus, there are
inevitably some complaints about offensiveness. According to
this theory, students at elite liberal arts colleges are fragile little angels who must be protected from seeing that which is
upsetting. Folks, it's time to learn how to toughen up. The real
world is full of disturbing ideas and imagery. The sooner you
learn how to ignore things
which offend you, the better off

you will be.
Nor do I buy the argument
that explicit chalkings should be
forbidden because children walk
around this campus. Any kid old
enough to read the V-Day chalkings already hears worse in the
schoolyard. To borrow a phrase
from Hobbes, children are nasty,
brutish and short. Anyone who
thinks otherwise has been reading too many Hallmark cards.
The

pretty messed up. At the same
time, we ought to look into the

motivations behind vulgar
chalkings and what, if any, purpose they serve.
The chalkings aren't uplifting or awareness-raising. Both
those terms imply that they are changing people's minds. In reality, they have no detectable persuasive value. No self-respecting
misogynist will re-evaluate his attitudes toward women on the
basis of some dirty words he saw on the pavement. Just as
nobody followed the command of the graffiti on the Intercultural
Center to "Destory [sic] everything," the V-Day chalkings are not
going to change opinions about female reproductive organs.

To borrow a phrase from Hobbes,
children are nasty, brutish and short.
Anyone who thinks otherwise has been
reading too many Hallmark cards.
Sometimes chalkings are defended on the grounds that they
spark discussion. It is definitely true that they attract attention
and get people talking. However, I'm not sure these discussions

are all that productive. At least in my experience, most of the
conversations inspired by chalkings have revolved around
themes like "These activists are nuts" or "I hope it rains soon."
It's like that great Onion headline "Gay Pride Parade Sets Gay
Rights Movement Back 50 Years." If you're promoting a cause,
getting outsiders to doubt your sanity is not a good way to start.
Graphic chalkings are not written because the writers
believe that they will impact people's thoughts. Sure, they will
claim that as their motivation. Maybe they've even convinced
themselves of it. But, ultimately, I suspect that "awareness-raising" is just rationalization. Obscene chalkings are popular
because it is fun to say vulgar things. Breaking the rules can be
exciting, and society's prohibition on certain words is one of
the safest, easiest rules to break.
We may look down upon the sort of people who write on
bathroom walls, but who among us can honestly say that he or
she has never laughed at a dirty limerick or admired an audacious post on The Daily Jolt? That's the secret appeal of things
like V-Day and Coming Out Week. They give people an excuse
to indulge that hidden part of their characters by allowing
them to pretend that behavior they would otherwise look down
upon has an important message and is therefore acceptable.
It's Mr. Hyde playing Dr. Jekyll, the id pretending to be the
superego.
So go ahead, activists. Chalk the living daylights out of this
place. Cover every inch of pavement with sexually explicit
statements. It won't offend me. But at least be honest about it.
These messages are not about identity politics or awarenessraising. When a group wants to get a point across, they use
films and lectures. Chalkings are about indulging the foulmouthed little vandal who lurks inside all our hearts.

V-Day chalkings elicit little response
Dear Editor:

When the SQU "Coming Out Week" chalkings
were criticized as being obscene, I heard many say,
"I'd be offended if straight people wrote the same

thing." WeU, in the chalkings to promote "The Vagina
Monologues," similarly graphic expressions were
used, and I haven't heard one person say a thing
about it on many walks up and down to Sharpies, on
The Daily Jolt or anywhere else.
I'm sure there are people who do feel both sets of
chalkings went over the line, but the point is, many

Many who were uncomfortable
with SQU have taken no issues
with "The Vagina Monologues,"
indicating a heterosexist bias.

time (and I hope they will again), let's not -hear that
as an excuse for why it makes you feel uncomfortable, and start dealing with the realities that we're
not all as comfortable as we claim to be. It would be

Dear Editor:
In light of the initial exclusion
of
Students
Swarthmore
Advocating Life (SSAL) from the
recently proposed Forum for
Activism, we would like to share a

description of our beliefs and

work
with
the
Swarthmore community.
SSAL urges society to find and
implement alternatives to abortion, the death penalty, euthanasia and other practices that take
lives. We oppose all forms of violence. We are not affiliated with
any religious or political organization. We welcome like-minded
activist

people to join us, regardless of
race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, political loyalty or way
of life.
Because our position on abortion is the most likely to excite
controversy on campus, the

philosophy and mission. We do

pressures that prevent women
from exercising their reproductive rights.
We believe that
women who have children should
not be forced to sacrifice their
education, career, home, economic viability, or relationships in
order to do so. Our objective is to
aid the young, single mother who

the mother who will lose her job

activist organization, SSAL challenges that status quo and works
to make abortion alternatives feasible and widely accepted both
here at Swarthmore and in the
world at large, with the hope of
eliminating the supposed "need"
for abortion. Toward this end,
SSAL has volunteered at Amnion
Crisis Pregnancy Center near
Bryn Mawr, collected monetary

donations for Amnion, volunteered through Women's Way in
Philadelphia, and raised awareness at Swat through posters and
our bulletin board.
Recent revisions of the FA proposal make membership and budgeting privileges available to all
activist groups on campus, though
SSAL was not initially invited to
join the FA. However, we feel that
our objections to the initial proposal are important even in light
of this change, as they have not yet
been raised in a public forum.
First, if an FA is to exist at
Swarthmore, it must be an inclusive organization, unaffiliated
with any political stance. Social
activism is not determined by
one's supposed philosophical position on a polarized, contrived political spectrum. Rather, it is determined by one's commitment to
working for societal transformation. The criterion set forth of

a "progressive" activist
group led to the exclusion of SSAL
and other groups on campus. But
as our platform and activities
demonstrate, we are promoters of
social change, rejecting the status
quo that tells women they can
"choose" but supports only one
choice. The decision to exclude
SSAL did not seem to be based
upon knowledge of our actual
beliefs or work.
Secondly, the FA proposal
included the creation of special
budgeting rules for member organizations. It is unjust for Student
Council to sanction the creation of
a group that would provide extra
or emergency financial support to
some groups while excluding others based upon supposed political
alignment. This would result in
the possible silencing of groups
that do not fit into the desired
political scheme.
Many students believe this
campus suffers from a lack of
political diversity. The FA (as initially proposed) would have exac-

being

erbated this condition further

by

unpopular minority
voices. This college is known for
silencing

its respect for the beliefs ofothers.
The recent revision of the FA proposal will help ensure that this
commendable tradition is pre-

served.

Activist group calls on students to
work proactively, redefine whiteness

I

Dear Editor:
Racism in America, especially when talking about
white people, is a delicate topic. The controversial
nature of white people becoming involved in antiracist organizing in their own white communities
can lead to quick judgments and misunderstandings.
With this in mind, I would like to respond to a recent
letter by Katherine Bridges 'O5 and a story published
in The Phoenix on Feb. 7. Both contained miscommunications and gave tentative ideas more weight then
they deserved. In brief, I'd like to start from scratch.
Why concentrate on anti-racist organizing targeted to white people? First, white people hold a ton of
power in regards to racism. The beneficiaries of skin
privilege, white people are the group with the most
ability to end racism. Second, white people are often
missing from discussions of racism. White folks have
a hard time thinking of themselves as a racial group

White people need to

without guilt, in order to take

rather then the racial norm, and often feel they have
no place in the struggle against racism. Third, white
people need to acknowledge their privilege, without
guilt, in order to take steps to end racism. White people are in a special place to discuss racism with other
white people: We share a common experience and

have historically taken (or stolen) leadership positions, which gives our white voices an unearned
authority that can be used to attack racism found in

society and in ourselves.
Like a Men Against Rape group, a White People
Against Racism group is a strong statement in and of
itself. It takes ownership of the important role white
people need to play in dismantling racism. White people organizing against racism sends the message that
you don't have to feel your privilege as a burden, but
rather as an ability. With that ability comes responsibility, and you can invest yourself in using uneared
power and skin privilege to fight against racism.

The Haverford Students' Initiative on Racism and
Whiteness is a group devoted to anti-racist education
and organizing, open to all, but with a focus on white
peoples' abilities to end racism. This students' initiative will bring speakers and workshops to Haverford
to address how white people can work against racism
and will be open to people who identify as white as
well as people who identify as non-white. Our group

aims to work with white people toward acknowledging and admitting the problem of racism and the crucial role that white people play in perpetuating systemic racism, even if their actions of the individuals
are not directly racist.
This means that, while we will allow ourselves to
deal with our own issues of white identity, we welcome the attendance, support and input of people of
color. We hope to intrigue and constructively challenge the Haverford community, and white people
especially, to find constructive ways to end internal
and societal racism. This includes creating a safe
space that can be non-judgmental and free from guilt
for white people interested in addressing these
issues.
As a group, we propose to work toward taking the
commonly used view of whiteness (as a basis of racial
comparison) and replace it with the formation of a
positive white identity that is anti-racist, open to
multiculturalism, gender, sexuality and class equalities. With these goals in mind, we aim to empower
participants with the ability to end racism through
their personal and professional lives beyond
Haverford.

Staff wage issue
not going away
The greatest part of human free will, so say the philosophers
is the capacity to choose the cause and direction toward which we
are living. Ideally, we choose the objects and ends of our lives
according to what we think our mission is in the world.
This choice isn't really even a choice but a moral obligation
explicit or implicit not to choose is also
because the decision
a declaration of intents and purposes. This is true of individuals
and is perhaps the greatest challenge facing mortal life: to pursue
our ends while still allowing for chance and indecision, humor
and affection, humility and resolve.
What is true of individuals must also be true of institutions
Swarthmore College is hardly
devoid of grand enunciations
about its meaning and purpose,
from
"Meaning
the
of
Swarthmore" promotional video
to President Bloom's favorite
phrase, "ethical intelligence." It is
the latter that I think merits consideration, with the potential to
be the realized spirit of
Swarthmore. I can see the cynics
sniggering at this, and I would
count myself among them to a
point, but Swarthmore should
definitely have an aim, and I feel
this is as good as any.
DANN NASEEMULLAH
What I think is often missed
between alumni donations and
In Search of Values
building new science centers is
that "ethical intelligence" is actually a very hard concept to real-

ize. Without the hard work that is inherent in that realization, the
phrase is just a trite emptiness to put on admissions brochures
and bandy about at commencement in a self-congratulatory man
ner.

What the concept should involve, paraphrasing Al Bloom's
commencement speech of two years back, is to think critically
about and always be aware of the complexities inherent in a deci
sion but to retain the will to act ethically and come to the righ
decision even despite the fog of intricacies and inconsistencies. I
implies inclusiveness, acceptance of difference, humility and a
communal commitment to a greater objective good, which is to be
reached by working together. This ethical decisiveness has been
markedly lacking on this campus of late, and here I am referring
to Swarthmore's failing drive toward securing a living wage for
all college staff. I know this issue is a complex one, and I am no
going to be simply moralistic about it, but I do believe that it is a
the very heart of our community and should be treated with the
respect and care that it deserves.
This is where the "ethical intelligence" ideal comes in. This is

a decision that reflects on the moral character of this institution
and thus should not be decided merely based on the direction o
market forces, the sensibilities of influential alumni, speculations
on what would happen to the college rankings, or wha
Swarthmore's peer institutions are doing. Instead, it should be a

decision that, although taking into account practical complexities

and other issues, should be based on the values and reflections of
concerned members of the community. While it is granted that
the 2,000-plus members of the Swarthmore community cannot be
actively in on the decision, it should not be a closed-shop admin
istration deal, without any real discussion or engagement of the
issues beforehand or even afterwards. If Swarthmore decides this
issue without meaningful broad-based consultation with faculty
students and especially different groups within the staff, some
thing vital would be lost from this institution.
If the administration continues to act independently and sin
gle-mindedly on the issue of granting a living wage, it must be
recognized that "ethical intelligence" can no longer be used in a
description this college. Otherwise, there would be a hypocritica
disconnect between what students are expected to learn and what

the alma mater teaches through its actions. If "ethical intelli
gence" is to radiate from Swarthmore and be inculcated to every
student that enters this august institution, there needs to be a
greater commitment made for inclusion and a general communi
ty solidarity toward finding the right answer together.
Come June, I'd like to leave this place feeling like Swarthmore
is somehow different, somehow special. It's true we learn a lot
here, but I hope we can feel that this place makes us into better peo
pie. If that aspiration is to become a reality for all students who
pass by these hallowed halls, Swarthmore must put its money
where its mouth is and address issues central to the community in
an inclusive and ethical manner, no matter the repercussions.

Before DuPont was constructed, this area of campus
has served various purposes.
When the college was founded,
it was part of the Crum Woods.
"Old pottery and glassware
were found; they were propbably
from a fire in Parrish," explained
Jan Semler, a staffperson from
Facilities Management who is on
the building committee.
Leftover materials from previous construction projects,
including wood and bricks, were
also stored in the area. "They
just dumped all of the debris out
here," Semler said. The materials were eventually used, but
remnants of them remain, only
to be unearthed in the past few

months.
The site of DuPont then functioned as the college's athletic
fields, and Semler said evidence
of this had also been found.
In the course of excavation,
"we're finding some interesting
things," she said. Much of the
fall semester was spent digging
out and clearing the area, as well
as the placement of pipes and
electrical wiring.

Laying foundations

Construction workers are busy put-

ting in the footing and foundation for
the Science Commons, a glassed-in

area that will be similar in appearance
to Kohlberg Coffee Bar, and a new front
to Cornell Library that will include two
40-seat classrooms and the introductory biology laboratory. The two additions, plus the construction of a chiller
plant behind DuPont, constitute "phase
one" of the science center construction.
If it proceeds on schedule, these
projects will be completed by
December of this year.
"There are about 20 people at the
construction site right now," Chas
Ricciardi said. Ricciardi is an official
from Barclay-White, Inc., who are
directing the project. After the first
delievery of structural steel will be in
March, the workforce will grow to
about 100.
Also in March, Semler said, "we'll
take off the roof of Cornell and create
one roof with the Commons." The two
buildings will only be connected at
ground level, however.
The Commons will have a "twostory glass wall facing the woods,"

Ricciardi said. Between the Commons
and DuPont will be an enlargement of
the Harry Wood gardens. "We want to
tie it more in with the Crum Woods,"
Semler said.
Building of the new complex is also

recognizing conservation principles.
Besides using recycled materials in
construction, the building will reuse
both energy and water, the latter by
collecting rainwater in an underground tank for irrigation.

Construction and renovation
After phase one is completed,
"entrances to Cornell and DuPont will
revert to the front of the buildings,"
Ricciardi said. Beginning in the summer of 2003, "the access will be only
from the front, and not the back," until
the project is completed.
During that summer, Kirby lecture hall in Martin will be demolished and replaced with offices and
seminar space. "The Martin interior
will have new mechanical equipment,

new corridors and new lighting,"
Ricciardi said.

"Most of the work on Martin is in
the summer, since demolishing inside
a building is messy," Semler said. A
second-story skywalk will also be constructed between Martin and Cornell.
This will cause disruption among the
rooms on the north side of the biology
building because of the installation of
fire shutters, which prevent flames
from spreading in the event of a fire.
In addition, "the new buildings wil be
totally sprinklered, as will Cornell,"
Semler said.
These renovations and the addition
of the chemistry wing will comprise
the second phase of the project. The
chemistry department will be housed
in a building parallel to the existing
research wing of DuPont, where a pile
of fill dirt now sits.
A new lecture hall will be constructed roughly where DuPont 190
once stood. The astronomy dome will
sit on top of the chemistry lecture hall.
"The project prepares for the dome
but does not itself construct the

movement," she

Completion and restoration
The final phase of the project will
see the construction of the physics and
astronomy wing and the renovation of
the existing "research wing" of
DuPont to house the mathematics and
statistics and computer science
departments. "The last piece will be
[finished] in the spring of 2004,"

Semler said.
The inside of DuPont will be demolished "down to the structure," she
said. The present exterior will be preserved, although windows will be
replaced and new ones added. "For the
first time, there will be daylight on the
bottom floor," Semler said.
Once all construction is completed,
the quadrangle between the new complex and Beardsley and Kohlberg will
be restored.
When the new parking lots were

built last summer, Semler said, "we
wanted to preserve as much college
parking as there was before." She said

they had explored the possibility of
busing workers in, but decided it "just
wasn't feasible."
The parking lot built on the former rugby field will likely remain in
its current state for at least the next

five years.

"It's possible that we'll use the
rugby parking lot during the construction in Parrish," Semler said.
The renovations are scheduled to
begin as soon as the science center
and new dorm are completed, by the
fall of 2004.

"We don't see a need for it past
that," she said. If the parking were
removed, however, the area could
still not be used for rugby. Because

the road was shifted over several
yards when the lot was built; the field
would be too small for regulation

Night of dreams
Students direct evening of farce
BY CARLA GREENBERG

cgreenbl@swarthmore.edu

The Frear is a black-box theater, which means that the
actors and the audience share the same space; there is no
separation except where the chairs end. In the Frear, the
audience is arranged on three sides of the stage area, allowing the action to take on a much more three-dimensional
quality than in a traditional setting.
This setup can be especially conducive to certain plays,
like the two pieces to be performed in this weekend's
Directing II Night of Scenes. The theme of the night is
"farce," which also lends itself quite nicely to the extra
amount of interaction allowed between audience and actors
by the black-box framework.
The first piece, directed by Jessica Nakamura 'O3, is
excerpted from

Moliere's "Tartuffe." Alex Edelson 'O4 plays
the title character, an impostor who convinces master of the
house Orgon (Free Williams 'O3) that he is a person of high
moral stature as well as a religious zealot.
Orgon's son, Damis (Collin Peng-Sue 'O3), attempts to
show Orgon that Tartuffe is fraud, which leads to Orgon disowning Damis. Orgon's new wife, Elmire (Rachel Best 'O4),
whom Tartuffe has repeatedly tried to seduce, also wants to
make Orgon see the light. Eventually she does, by convincing Orgon to hide under a table at a time when she is sure
that Tartuffe will make another attempt. Moliere's play ends
on happily, but this excerpt does not carry us that far. Thus,
despite the farcical tone of the piece, we are left on strangely bitter note.
The second piece, directed by Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3, is

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Rajaa Shakir delivers a monologue in "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered

Despite its title, the play "For Colored Girls Who Have
Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf' is inspirational for people of all ethnic backgrounds and genders;
a male, Andy Wong 'O2, is producing the Swarthmore production, and the small ensemble cast includes women of
several different ethnicities.
"[The piece] is about making yourself whole in spite of
all the problems you face. It reaches out to women of color.
To all women. To all people, really," Khadijah White 'O4,
first-time director, said.
Written by Ntozake Shange in 1974, "For Colored Girls
is a "choreopoem," a cohesive blend of spoken-word
performance, dancing and drums. Though non-narrative
in the traditional sense, various scenes are linked by
themes of emotional strength and grace in spite of raceand gender-based oppression. The piece will take place in

8 p.m. Maria Alvarez 'O4 has acted in "For Colored Girls

Alvarez will take on the role of Lady in Blue for this weekend's performance.
"There's less scenery than in a normal play, which
makes it more challenging," White said. "The lighting and
acting are more important, and the girls on stage have to
create the scenes for the audience to imagine. This can be
really powerful atmosphere for telling a story, if it's done

White, who was also involved with the recent
Swarthmore production of "The Vagina Monologues,"
noted similarities between the works apart from the setless stage and monologue component. "It's similar to 'The
Vagina Monologues' because it encourages you to define
yourself by who you are, not by other people," she said.
But where "The Vagina Monologues" sometimes seems
like brash bits of stand-up comedy, "For Colored Girls
is quiet, contemplative and smooth; its humor is subtle
and melancholy.

'cause I'm sorry."
"You know I love you, but I ain't never gonna love you
like you want me to love you. I'm sorry."
"Shut up, bitch. I told you I was sorry."
The girls' pained yet high-spirited banter seems completely natural. "Watching the actresses grow and watching them pull the words from themselves has been really
rewarding," White said. "I've seen them grab onto this
play and make the piece theirs, and that's fascinating for
any director. [The actresses] really put their hearts and
souls into this. I think that'll come through, and the audience will appreciate and enjoy it."

Christopher Durang's "The Actor's Nightmare." Matt
Fitting 'O5 plays George Spelvin, an accountant who wanders backstage of a production with thirty minutes 'til showtime and an injured principal actor. The other members of
the production seem to think that George is the understudy
for the role, so he, protesting, is pushed on stage to take the
spotlight. Conveniently, George is a theater buff, and thus
does better than the common man would in keeping up with
his fellow actors, played by Samantha Bartner 'O4, Ben
Camp 'O5 and Juliet Lashinsky-Revene 'O4. He also gets some
help from the stage manager, Celia Paris 'O5.
As the show proceeds, he finds himself inexplicably
thrown into four different plays: first Noel Coward's
"Private Lives," then Shakespeare's "Hamlet," then a
Beckett-style play referred to as "Checkmate," and finally

Robert Bolt's "A Man for All Seasons."
As Hamlet, George is required to recite a soliloquy;
though he knows plenty of individual lines from many different plays, he doesn't know one entire speech. So we
watch him move from "To be or not to be," to
"Steeeeellllllaaaaa!" to "I have always depended on the
kindness of strangers" to "Out! Out, damn spot!" Finally he
runs out of pre-written dialogue and begins telling the audience about his relationship with Catholicism.
The piece is nightmarish, but what makes it interesting
are the different ways to interpret that nightmare. Perhaps
George is in fact the understudy, with a severe case of amnesia. Director Nelson-Lee suggests that "Durang is fascinated
with Catholicism and sin, so perhaps George is a lapsed
Catholic and is in purgatory making up for his sins, or perhaps he is just a normal guy who has a vivid and slightly
traumatic dream."
All of this leads to the classic elementary-school book
report ending: to find out what happens, see the show. The
one-hour production will take place in the Frear Ensemble
Theatre, Saturday, Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. and Sunday, Feb. 24 at 6

a game of Jenga, and not just any old game of Jenga, but
gimmicky Truth or Dare Jenga, the game to turn initially
compatible people into bitter old foes.
Cheever's specialty is actually bioengineering, a word
"so broad as to be almost meaningless." When he graduated
from Swarthmore, there was a lot of military spending
going on. He could have either gotten an easy job in defense
or spent his life "building the next generation of computers
to go 20 percent faster." Instead, he chose bioengineering,
which was "at the very least not malicious, and also potentially helpful." He went on to the University of Pennsylvania
and got all the fancy highfalutin' degrees, writing his dissertation on the "Capabilities ofMicrowave Radiometry for
the Detection of Subcutaneous Targets," which means so little to me as to be completely nonsensical. He explained
some of his research to me in lay terms, and though it is
really fascinating, all that really adheres to my brain are the
words "enlarged heart" and "sock," the latter not even referring to his own research, but rather to a competing theory
on how to keep an enlarged heart contained. He's never

only two people playing, this means we have inadvertently
stumbled on some bizarre version of a third-grade birthday
party, we decide to be bad sports and selective rule followers. "My first kiss was fairly unpleasant," he recalls, forced
to relive repressed memories in a completely constructed
setting with strangers. "We were playing spin-the-bottle and
it was one of those coercive things."
We scrap the dares and, since my stories aren't nearly as
interesting as Cheever's, he answers all the truths. We also

Cheever has two sons, and a good portion of his answers
seem to revolve around his family. The most daring thing
he's ever done? Wandering out during the storm two winters ago to look for his son and almost being hit by a falling

"Who in the room has the worst haircut?"
"Well, I certainly feel more comfortable with my haircut than I would with yours," he says with a grin. That
clinches it: Eric Cheever is not only a good person, honest
and slightly awkward like everybody should be, but also
funny. I search my mind for a comeback, but finding none,
decide that my victory will be my insult. There aren't
many easy moves left and Cheever, despite his initial
analysis of the Jenga structure, has pulled some of the side
pieces. I, thinking he was on to something that he wasn't
sharing, have followed suit on the other sides, leaving the
tower balancing on one block at several points. Cheever
employs the tapping method, and slowly forces out one of
the last possible middle pieces, despite my strong exhales
in the general direction of the tower during his turn. I'm
doomed. We both know it. "If you get a piece out, I've lost,"
Cheever says.
I slowly look over the entire tower, searching for one
more, just one more place I can weasel a block out. I tug
gently on several pieces, and the whole tower sways (you
can insert your own tasteless World Trade Center joke
here, because I'm not in the mood to do it). And then, miracle of miracles, I find a piece that gives just enough for me
to pull it out and place it with strained effort on the top of
the pile. I have my victory dance all ready, which means,
of course, that Cheever, calling on his reserve of engineering genius, manages to work out yet another piece. "It's all
about the parts of the system that you need to learn," he
had said earlier, referring to his lack of biology knowledge

before attempting to use engineering to find a solution to
congestive heart failure. "It's like a big mathematical problem."
Not that looking at it that way makes things any easier
for me. I turn to Michael, my trusted photographer, to help
me out.
'lThe top is unstable," he says. "Pull from the bottom." So
I do, and the tower and I both crumble. Michael looks at
Cheever and says, "Well, of course that is closer to the center of gravity." The two both chortle, one geek to another.

they say! No academic basis for your conclusions! While I
normally would not give weight to the words of anyone who
thinks polar fleece is the height of fashion, I will nonetheless, for the purpose of preserving my reputation as protector of the people, address
the fluff allegation by using

more academic sources.
My claims are based on

the dusty study carrels facing (of all places!) the Scott

is surrounded by that atrommm
cious red carpet, and while
my fashion-forward roommate typically has half of its books checked out himself, I
make a point of taking advantage of this valuable resource.
Our filthy rich parents didn't pay $30,000 for nothing, doll!
It is thus that I have found such gems as "Nylon: The
Story of a Fashion Revolution." Imagine my surprise, then,
when I checked out the innocuous-looking "Economics of
Fashion" and found it simply horrible. No, doll, it is not a
guide to finding designer clothes at bargain prices. Rather,
it is ridden with boring graphs and statements like, "Since
a fashion is a widespread adoption by imitation of a style,
it is as such a fact of social life, and what is the fashion at

any time can be determined by physical count and need not

at all be a matter of opinion."
"Need not at all be a matter of opinion!" Dahling, no!
What is style if not a reflection of good choices? Two seasons ago every gal and her mother paraded around in that
horrible, overly suggestive triangle top, but did it become
good style? No, dahling, no!
This week's question pertains to this very issue:

Dear Style Queen:
What is the new black?
Postmodern Philosopher in Paces
Dear Philosopher:
Ah, yes, the new black

a timeless question that has
left generations of normally confident fashion enthusiasts
genuinely stumped. Will we ever again find, they wonder,
an excellent, all-purpose color that looks good day and
night? What, pray tell, could it be?
And you call yourself a postmodernist! Doll, you have
clearly been too busy smoking your clove cigarettes to read
my columns closely. Last week I mentioned the phrase "signature color."
Still confused? It means deconstruct, dahling! Derail
authority! Bring it back to the self! I cannot, in good faith,
tell you to wear a color that might clash with your skin
tone or, worse, with your hair color. While I can tell you

that your signature color is most likely not navy blue, puce
or bright orange, the rest is up to you. Do some soul-searching. Take an inventory of your wardrobe. Find out what
makes you feel good.
Put more simply, there will never be a new black. But
for ages I have been wanting to tell you and your messyhaired, iiber-intellectual type this: variety is the spice of
life. As Michel Foucault himself once wrote: "Nowadays I
prefer to remain silent about Nietzsche."
Get it, dahling? He underwent a change. Allow yourself
to change, too, dahling! I myself have watched my signature color evolve from purple (excess idolization of Prince)
to pink (pseudo-sorority-girl identity assumed in defiance

of Swarthmore culture) to red (vampiress?). Anyway,
dahling, get to it! Turn some heads! Go!

Swarthmopology 101: traditions unmasked
Our columnist dissects the meaning of nude running and campus-wide blind dates in a strictly academic study
College life is confusing. I can barely explain the PDC system to my friends from
other schools, and these friends don't even have problems grasping things that would
almost certainly befuddle the mythical man-on-the-street, like the popularity of naked
hairy rugby players and a cappella music. Fact is, it's way too easy to forget how much
of what we do doesn't really make that much sense. In an only somewhat bogus sense,
we who attend Swarthmore have something resembling a separate culture.
I don't want to say we have a more of a culture-like thing
than any other large group of people who spend all their
time in a smallish vicinity, participating in similar activities; we probably don't. But, frankly, if a large part of my life
is spent in the midst of a society that has its own customs,
rules, etiquette and the like, then, goddammit, that's interesting to me.

Traditions already in place
Taking a cue from this British guy, E. E. EvansPritchard, whose book about cows I was just reading, it
seemed like it might be kind of neat to examine "the function of the structure" of a few of the weird ritualistic things
that Swarthies do as a group. So let's do a couple topics'
worth, i.e., as long as this flimsy premise can stretch, of

Swarthmopological analysis.
First topic: Screw Your Roommate. Screw, from a structural-functionalist perspective, or just from a Captain

Another "ritual" that, as

far as I know, happens nowhere but Swarthmore, is the
recently semi-controversial Dash for Cash. Contrary to certain critics' opinions, I've
been to every single one in the last two years, and there is no way the Dash is sexual. It
is far too fast and surreal to be a turn-on, unless you have some kind of bizarre "running around shouting" fetish. I think it serves more of a social purpose, to get people to
gather for a completely non-intellectual and also non-conventionally recreational spectacle. In addition, running naked through administration buildings is a perfect symbol-

ic stance on something, though I can't put my finger on what. Thirdly, it makes the
rugby team a bunch of money, and we love our ruggers. Other events that have group
nudity in a not-very-sexual context include the not-too-practiced Dip of the Month. I've
never done this one, but you should. Nakedness is good, people. Good.
This could go on for a while, as you can see. Feel free to continue to analyze aspects
of Swat culture on your own spare time. Another worthy topic is linguistic oddities:
words like "sketchy" and the ambiguous "SwAßthmore" vs. "SwAthmore" debate. Also
deserving of a look: parties, Sharpies tabling, Sharpies eating (who eats in whatrooms?
why?), SWIL stuff (Pterodactyl hunt, the Valentine's Day Massacre) and the inevitable,
"The Sexual Life of Swarthies." However, rather than blather on right now about what
already exists, I'm going to move, briefly, into the speculative, mainly because it provides an opportunity to do one of my favorite things: make a list. Here goes:
Swarthmore traditions I'd like to see
The Mayday Levitation: On May First, to honor the radical and bohemian tradition
of Swarthmore, students gather around Sharpies, join hands, and try really hard to levitate it. Motivational speakers, terrible folk singers, fire eaters and the like should of
course be present.
Dorm Rivalries: This probably already happens, but not enough by a long stretch.
If nothing else, Dana and Hallowell should be on the verge of firebombing each other
right now. I'd also like to see Pitt. vs. Palmer vs. Roberts, Wharton vs. Willets, and
everyone vs. Parrish. It could be just like the Houses in Harry Potter, except without the
magic spells or the fate of the world in the balance.
Nude Beach: Following the tradition of nudity, on some sunny day near the end of
classes people chill naked on Parrish beach. Great fun for specs, administrators and
small children who happen to be on campus.
Goth Day: Self-explanatory but would be soooo fun. Even better if we could get professors into it. Imagine your favorite physics professors. Now imagine them in black lipstick. Aren't they just that much cooler?
The November Listening: People actually listen to WSRN for a day near the end of

November. Far-fetched, I know.
Sounds great, right? Of course it does. But this stuff can only start with your help. So
come on. Tradition is a beautifully mutable thing, and someone must have invented it.
start your own wacky college tradition
Why not us? The future is in your hands

Political Peruvian sculptor to give lecture Monday
BY DEIRDRE CONNER

dconner2@swarthmore.edu

It only took a photograph for Kukuli Velarde to be
inspired by the 2,000-year-old Mexican statue that resides
in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. She has
never seen the statue in person, but her most recent
series, called "Isichapuitu," is made up of 36 clay sculptures resembling the Huastecan relic. Velarde draws on
the indigenous culture of her native Peru as well as her
own personal history to create works of art: Each figure
in the series represents one of her memories or beliefs.
Now a resident of Philadelphia, she will give a lecture
and slide show presentation on Monday at 4:30 p.m. in the

LPAC Cinema.
This is not Velarde's first connection with
Swarthmore. Last year, she taught ceramics while art
professor Syd Carpenter was on leave. That's how
Spanish professor Joan Friedman became familiar with
her and her work.
"It's definitely the work of a woman," Friedman said.

"It's very embryonic."
The "Isichapuitu" installation consists of several versions of the statue presented on the floor, next to each
other as what Velarde calls "a metaphor of wholeness."
Much of Velarde's work addresses the crossing of boundaries. "It is said that every art work is a self-portrait," she
said in a statement about the series. "I imagine the
Huastecan artist modeling the clay: giving it his or her
eyes, his or her full cheeks, his or her protruding upper
jaw. I imagine him or her looking like me. And then, I
imagine myself making the Huastecan piece two thousand years ago."
Velarde crosses not only time but cultures. Her medium, clay in various colors, helps her "link my nonWestern cultural background and my Western reality. It
is also a way to approach surviving artistic traditions
and aesthetic values of the native populations of the

Morghan's Oscar picks: And the winners are

BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu
It's that time again: Oscar nominations are out, and everyone is scrambling to see the
nominated films so they can be in the know come the awards ceremony March 25. The past
year's films are being systematically classified and re-advertised according to the number
of nominations received. Making the pages of The New York Times, Business Week, Time
Magazine and a vast array of other periodicals, this year's Academy Award nominations

are a huge, record-breaking, unprecedented deal. Throughout the rest of the rest of the
world, the candidate announcements have not been taken lightly. Trapped within the claustrophobic confines of our Swarthmore bubble, however, we're a little more sheltered, a little less aware, a little more consumed by our intellectual pursuits, which, generally speaking, do not involve frequent cinematic outings. Here, in plain text and in a neatly organized
manner, is everything important you need to know about the 74th Annual Academy
Awards. You may now convincingly pretend you didn't spend all of last year poring over
your linear algebra textbook and successfully feign some semblance ofconnection with the
outer (entertainment) world when you plop onto your lounge couch for study break while
viewing the ceremony with your work-weary hallmates.
Who, besides die-hard film critics and students, is really interested in the best film editing category? Ditto on the best animated shorts, and, for the most part, the documentaries.
No one, here at least, really has time to become familiar with either of these obscure categories. The significant categories, the ones you need to know to prepare yourself properly
for the coming ceremony and its trail-blazing nature, are as follows:

Best Picture
"A Beautiful Mind"
"Gosford Park"
"In the Bedroom"
"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"
"Moulin Rouge"

Best Director
Ron Howard, "A Beautiful Mind"
Robert Altaian, "Gosford Park"
David Lynch, "Mulholland Drive"
Peter Jackson, "Lord of the Rings"
Ridley Scott, "Black Hawk Down"

It's worth noting that, including the two nominations above, "The Lord of the Rings"
racked in a grand total of 13 Academy Award nominations, making it the dominant film of
the year. Not too shabby for a fantasy flick. I almost choked when I saw that "Gosford Park"
had received five nominations. Is there a best last-minute redemption category? Definitely
a comment on the quality of Hollywood's 2002 output.
Best Actor
Denzel Washington, "Training Day"
Russell Crowe, "A Beautiful Mind"
Sean Penn, "I Am Sam"
Tom Wilkinson, "In the Bedroom"
Will Smith, "Ali"

Best Actress
Halle Berry, "Monster's Ball"
Judi Dench, "Iris"
Nicole Kidman, "Moulin Rouge"
Sissy Spacek, "In the Bedroom"

Renee Zelwegger, "Bridget Jones' Diary"

The nominations for best actor and best actress are particularly notable for their relative plethora of minority actors. For the first time ever, two black males have simultaneously been nominated for best actor, and, for the first time since 1993, a black female has

THE PHOENIX

February

...

been nominated for best actress. Not since 1972 have so many black performers been nominated, and that year was the first time in history that as many nonwhite actors had been
nominated, even though none of them won. Until now, the Academy Awards have been a
nagging reminder of the snail-like pace of Hollywood's diversification. From 1990 to 1999,
only 19 minority actors, about eight percent of the total nominees, were included in the top
five categories, and only two of those (Whoopi Goldberg, best supporting actress in "Ghost,"
and Cuba Gooding Jr., best supporting actor in "Jerry Maguire") won. Only one black actor
has ever received an Oscar for best actor, and the best actress Oscar has yet to be claimed
by an African-American actress. The 74th Academy Awards, 2002, could be minority actors'

time to shine.

Best Supporting Actor
Ben Kingsley, "Sexy Beast"

Ethan Hawke, "Training Day"
lan McKellen, "The Lord of the Rings"
Jim Broadbent, "Iris"
Jon Voight, "Ali"

Best Supporting Actress
Helen Mirren, "Gosford Park"
Jennifer Connelly, "A Beautiful Mind"
Maggie Smith, "Gosford Park"
Kate Winslet, "Iris"
Marisa Tomei, "In the Bedroom"

It's good to know the smaller roles, too, I guess, and it's just as important that they are
represented along with the major roles listed above. Still, I wonder about the quality of the
discretion that went into these nominations: Does Ethan Hawke really stack with Jon
Voight? And everyone is already amply aware of how I feel about "Gosford Park," but I have
to admit that Maggie Smith belongs on this list, if only because she salvaged the film.
Best Original Screenplay
"Amelie,"

Best Adapted Screenplay
"A Beautiful Mind"

"Gosford Park,"
"Monster's Ball"

"Ghost World"

"Memento"
"The Royal Tenenbaums"

"In the Bedroom"
"The Lord of the Rings,"
"Shrek"

"Gosford Park" aside, the original screenplay nominations are promising. And, for the
most part, the adapted screenplay nominations look well-deserved, with the marked exception of "Shrek." Was there really no better adapted screenplay than that detailing the trials
and tribulations of an animated ogre determined to regain his isolated swampland from a
buzzing horde of outcast fairytale creatures, without even the perks of a Disney original

soundtrack?
There you have it, this year's meaningful top picks. Even if you don't have time to spend
the next month rushing to area theaters and Blockbuster stores in a desperate attempt to
better inform yourself of the candidates and personally assess the worthiness of their candidacy, you'll at least know what to expect, sort of. You'll know what people will be anxiously anticipating (will Denzel or Will take best actor? Will Halle become the first black
best actress in the history of the Oscars?) when the star-studded night arrives, the red carpet rolls out before the glamour of the biggest names in Hollywood, and you, unshowered,
clad in flannel pajama pants, traipse down the beige-carpeted, vomit-stained hallway to
claim your spot before the communal tube.

might be called, to quote one of the track titles, a micro-disneycal world tour. It was undeniably fun at times, but
there was simply too much going on for it to work as a real
album. In light of this, the title of Cornelius' newest release
is unimaginably appropriate. Where "Fantasma" was
splintering in a thousand different directions, this new

record is cohesive, compelling and meaningful: It very

much has a point.
To begin with, Cornelius works with a surprisingly
simple and consistent sonic palette. Almost all of the
tracks here are built on combinations of precisely plucked
acoustic guitar chords, sparse but caressing breathy vocal
snippets, and crisp percussion that sounds like it actually
comes from a real drum set. Sure, he changes things up a
bit: "Another View Point" gets rocky with spiraling electric guitars and a solid bass groove; the playful "Drop"
masterfully incorporates the sounds of water dripping and
splashing (a terrific accompanying video shows a young
boy washing his hand); elsewhere we find bird calls, subtle banjo plucks, tastefully arranged electronic clicks and
beeps, and snatches of theremin. But all of this is carefully reined in and channeled toward an overarching sense of
unity and calm that prevails throughout. Even on the frantic, fractured, faux-metal "I Hate Hate," glimpses of melodic majesty emerge from of the chaos.
The album also flows in a literal sense
many of the
tracks merge into one another, linked by rhythmic and textural motifs as well as a unified sound. Although

Oyamada's stunning voice dominates the album, usually
multitracked in dense harmonies on sustained "aaahs," it's
easy to lose sight of the fact that these are individual songs
(no doubt in part because even the English lyrics are largely undecipherable
the chorus of "Smoke," which simply
repeats the title four times, comes off as "soo-moooohg").
One highlight is an update ofbossa nova classic and Terry
Gilliam theme song, "Brazil," with a mellifluous computer
warble taking on the soaring melody. Besides its lush
beauty, the album is intensely rhythmic and consistently
danceable (if you dance like I dance), alluding to Brazilian
samba, upbeat house-like grooves and complex funk while
never quite giving way to one genre absolutely. Promo
material for this album suggests that it's equally appropriate for listening to through headphones or in the car,
though my friend said it would make her pee. I would add
the dance floor and a late-night lounge sofa to that list, but
the point stands that this is a versatile record, capable of
providing immense listening pleasure in any number of
situations. "Point" is gorgeous, engaging and magical.

to distance themselves from their brash and raucous early work (epitomized by "!,"
whose title is unfortunately not pronounced as a Bantu click). But so what what's
so mind-blowing about a group evolving their sound? It used to be, in the days of Talking Heads, Stevie
Wonder, Joni Mitchell and even Led Zeppelin (all of whose influence, incidentally, is apparent on this album),
that nearly every album an artist released would involve some distinct stylistic change.
So if "Change" is not noteworthy in that respect, then what does it have to recommend it? Well, there are
some dandy songs: the chiming, propulsive opener "Sentimental Plan," the majestic and driving "Time
Bomb," the fast and funky "The Other Side." Morrison's lyrics continue to be delightfully literate and often
abstruse ("I'm an old-testament type of guy/I like my coffee black/and my parole denied"). The band continues to demonstrate deft musicianship, smartly upholding the proud tradition of intelligent guitar bands in a
world that has all but forsaken them. I was excited, when I first heard it, at the thought that it would prove
everybody wrong and show that a band like this can continue to improve even as they edge gradually
towards a maturity beyond their "mature masterpiece." But, sadly, this record, as good as it is, doesn't live
up to the standard of excellence set by "Emergency." And I can't help but think that that failure comes not
simply from the quality of the songs, but from the dissolution of some of the rough edges of the last record
rough edges which, come to think of it, are perfectly described in its title. (6/10)

some of the best band names on record (besides the flagship MagFields, there are
the Future Bible Heroes, the Gothic Archies, and 6ths), he's decided to resort to his
birth moniker for the first time on his latest release.
That's not the only thing that makes this unusual for a Stephin Merritt record

ical piece, a downcast folky tune about postponed love, but similarly odd, "experi
mental" tracks continue throughout the majority of the album. Naturally, the pre
ponderance of mood pieces (including dulcimer-sounding renditions of "Greensleeves" and "O
Tannenbaum") is due to the fact that this is a soundtrack. (The film, set for release in July, apparently chron
icles a gay relationship between a fifteen-year-old and an "ex-soccer coach," who sounds like a real loser.) It's
hard to know if Merritt put together the instrumental fragments to augment and justify the inclusion of his
other songs in the movie, or if he was more interested in experimenting with filmic incidentals and includ
ed the pop tunes out of obligation to his fans. Though there's nothing wrong with the instrumentals, I sus
pect that most people are more interested in the songs. There are six of them, and they are very much worth
your time. The hummable melodies are very typical of Merritt, as are the quirky, reverb-laden arrange
ments. Standouts include the gorgeously sung "Maria Maria Maria" and the appropriately titled "This Little
Ukelele," but the best thing here is probably "Poppyland," a bouncy ode to a Utopia where, in a line whose
authorship is unmistakable, "all your favorite things/are painted on the wings/of the butterflies." In com
parison with other Merritt releases (say, oh, 1999's staggering "69 Love Songs"), these six pretty little ditties
hardly make this a must-purchase. But they should serve perfectly adequately to tide fans over for now. I
won't be surprised to hear them blasting out of some dorm windows this spring. (6/10)

Garnet men knock off
three Div. I opponents
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu
After dropping their first match of the spring

against a formidable University of
Pennsylvania opponent, the Garnet Tide are currently riding a three-game winning streak, with
victories over Division I foes Mt. Saint Mary's, St.
Joseph's and Temple.
Traditionally one of Swarthmore's strongest
varsity sports, the men's tennis team has won
three NCAA Division 111 titles and qualified for
nationals 24 of the past 25 seasons.
This year, 24-year veteran coach Mike Mullan
and senior captain John Thomas 'O2 hope to lead
the team back to the Big Dance this spring.
"Our team expectations are to go to nationals,"
Ben Rae 'O4 said. To reach this goal, the Tide often
face top-flight Division I opponents early in the
year to gain crucial experience for the rest of the

season

season.
After an off-season that focused on protecting
their bodies from injury by working out in the
Mullan Tennis Center (named after Mullan himself)

and practicing to create more aggressive, attacking
play, the team opened its season Jan. 25 against the
Penn Quakers, one of the better Division I teams in
the nation. The overmatched squad won only 10
games in a 7-0 drubbing. "In our first match, we lost
to UPenn, but we didn't expect to do very well

against them, because they are a good Division I
team," Rae said. He lost in the No. 4 singles match,
3-6, 3-6, against freshman Todd Lecher.
But on Feb. 9, the Tide rebounded in a dual
meet by notching a 5-0 victory over Mt. St. Mary's
and edging out St. Joseph's with a 3-2 win. No. 2
and 3 seeds Justin Singer 'O3 and Jayson Yost 'O3
paved the way with easy wins over the Mt. St.
Mary Mountaineers.
"Justin and Jayson provide

some experience,
because they are juniors," Rae said.
Since real match play does not begin until after
spring break, players are treating these matches as
warmups for their Division 111 schedule. However,
Rae added, "We still want to do well in these
matches so we have some confidence going in to
the rest of the season."
Since tennis teams only utilize a six-man roster
during regular match play, Mullan also faces the
difficult decision in these warmup matches of
choosing the sixth man. With upperclassmen
Thomas, Singer and Yost a virtual lock for the top
seeds and sophomores Rae and Frank Visciano 'O4
stepping up their play this year, the last spot boils
down to a three-player race between Aaron Rubin
'O4, Justin Durand 'O5 and Joey Spadola 'O4. Mike
Noreika 'O4, a talented doubles player, will also see
playing time in doubles matches.
The next game for the Tide is this Saturday
against Fairleigh-Dickinson University.

Forward Bayne Heersink shoots a layup in traffic during
Swarthmore's 59-53 win over Haverford on Saturday.
Heersink had 11 points and seven rebounds off the bench for
the Garnet, who split the season series with Haverford. The
Garnet won the game with strong team defense, forcing
Haverford into 24 turnovers. Swarthmore finished the season
with a 2-11 conference record and a 6-19 record overall.

After trouncing the opposition at the Northeast
Collegiate tournament last weekend, Garnet badminton suffered its worst loss of the season against
Bryn Mawr on Tuesday. The Garnet collected 43
points en route to their first Northeast Collegiate
championship but managed to win only one match in
the 1-4 loss to Bryn Mawr.
"The weekend was marvelous. It was all
Swarthmore," Karen Lange 'O2 said. Lange defeated
Surbhi Gupta 'O4 in the women's singles finals.
In her semifinals match, Gupta edged out Bryn
Mawr's Meredith Stoll, the most dominant player in
the Philadelphia Area Intercollegiate Association for
Women (PAIAW). "I went into the match just hoping I
could get a few more than four points off of her,"
Gupta said. That would have matched her previous
best effort against Stoll. Gupta realized her goal in just
the first set, which she dropped 7-1 L She then won the
second set 11-9."The whole team crowded around me
and gave me lots of support," Gupta said.
. In the dramatic third and final set,
Gupta fell
behind 0-4 before rallying to an 11-5 victory. "[StolTJ's
an amazing player, but she was getting really angry,
frustrated and tired," Gupta said. "It was a stamina
game, and I had the willpower to win. It was definitely the best match of my life."
Lange expounded on the significance of Gupta's
win. "Beating Meredith is a huge accomplishment,"
Lange said. "Surbhi's drops were marvelous, and she
has a beautiful cross-court dip. She really wanted it."
Gupta's teammates also had some notable performances at the tournament. Brendan Karch 'O2 captured the men's singles title and teamed up with Chris
Ang 'O2 to win the men's doubles championship. Ang
also captured the mixed doubles title with teammate
Olga Rostapshova 'O2.
The Garnet were not as capable versus Bryn Mawr
on Tuesday. After being handled by Swarthmore over
the weekend, "Bryn Mawr was obviously psyched
up," Lange said. She posted her best effort versus Stoll
in a 6-11, 4-11 defeat.
The first doubles team of Liz Leininger 'O4 and
Wury Morris 'O4 also dropped their match. One can
usually expect a three-set nail-biter when Leininger
and Morris take on Bryn Mawr's top doubles squad.
But the Swarthmore pair lost in straight sets on
Tuesday. "I think we were just really nervous going
in," Morris said. "We were just doing a lot of stupid
things, like smashing it into the net."
Gupta, coming off Sunday's emotional win, lost a
close match in three sets. "I was sore from Sunday and

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Surbhi Gupta lines up a smash Tuesday against
Bryn Mawr. Gupta lost, and the Garnet fell 4-1
made a couple of bad shots," Gupta said. "[My opponent] also started exploiting a couple of my weakness-

es" in the third set, she said.

The outcome was disappointing for the Garnet.
Only Rostapshova, at No. 3 singles, won her match.
Bryn Mawr's win kept them undefeated in the
PAIAW conference and assured them the conference
championship. Swarthmore dropped to 5-2 with the
loss and will clinch second place in the conference
with a win tonight at Albright.

Swimmers ready to storm conferences
BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
The Garnet Tide endured a two-and-a-halfhour drive Feb. 13 to compete against
Washington College. The men's meet was no
different from the ride; the Garnet men

lounged in chairs by the pool during their 13762 rout of Washington. The women, however,
came up against tougher competition, losing
by a score of 139-66.
Christie Tbmm 'O5 was the only winner for
the women, swimming the 200 backstroke in
2:17.26. "I think the meet against Washington
wasn't really an accurate indicator of our preparedness for conferences," Meredith Leigh
'O4 said. "We kind of conceded the meet as
unwinnable and used it as an opportunity to
figure out our conference events instead of
creating the best lineup to go against them."
The men's team downed Washington easily, winning eight of the 11 events. David
Whitehead 'O3 was a triple winner, swimming
the 50-yard freestyle in 22.33, the 100-yard
freestyle in 4912 and the 400-yard medley
relay. This winning relay included Ben
Morgan 'O5, Mike Dudley 'O3 and John Lillvis

THE PHOENIX

'O4 and finished with a time of 3:30.97.
The 400-yard freestyle relay of Jake Ross
'O5, Morgan, Mike Auerbach 'O5 and Chris

Bussard 'O3 also won. Other winners included
Dudley in the 200-yard IM (2:0L59), Lillvis in
the 200-yard butterfly (2:0133), Auerbach in the

500-yard freestyle (5:05.66) and Bussard in the
200-yard freestyle (1:5419).

Eighteen women will attend conferences,
all of them accomplished swimmers. But one
stands out for her rapid progress: Maila Sepri
'O5. Although she had never swum competitively before this year, Sepri has become a conference-quality swimmer, which is an
unprecedented feat, in part because swimming usually demands years of practice.
The seniors on the team, Amy Auerbach
'O2, Lisa Ladewski 'O2 and Allison Lyons 'O2,
have all made significant contributions.
Auerbach is a versatile swimmer who can
compete in almost every event. Her speed in
the water and her pink goggles distinguish her
from her teammates. Ladewski is a breaststroker and one of the team captains. She was not
only supportive in the pool but also out of the
pool, offering her services as a Student
Academic Mentor (SAM) to the first-years on

the team. Lyons is the second team captain as
well as a breaststroker and a butterflier. She
was also a very supportive teammate.
"They all made it a very easy transition
from high school to college," Tomm said.
"They were supportive and welcoming and
will be greatly missed next year."
On Friday, the team will leave for the
Centennial Conference Championships at
Franklin & Marshall. For the next three days,
the swimmers will compete twice a day. The
morning preliminaries will determine who is
qualified to swim in finals that evening. For
the team to do well, they will need to have
depth both in the finals and the consolations.
For Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, the stakes rid-

ing on this one meet are high. "The hardest

part of all this is that all the months of training come down to one meet. That is what

makes swimming so tough," Rodriguez said.
"We train for hours for less than a minute of
success. Something as simple as a bad cold the
week before can really mess things up."
Despite the pressure, Rodriguez has high
expectations for the team. "We are tapering
well and we are all trying to focus," he said.
"I'm confident we will do well."

settle patterns." Most importantly, the surface is "very
resilient and can be used year-round, regardless of weather." Hertz is enthralled with the idea that "you can even
plow snow off it."
Most important for men's lacrosse and field hockey
the two sports that will officially use the resurfaced field
is that the surface has the length and feel of grass and

"plays true to grass," Borbee said.
Field hockey captain-elect Katie Cloonan 'O3 was one of
a handful of student-athletes that had a chance to test out
a similar synthetic grass surface at Rutgers-Camden a few
weeks ago. "I was pleasantly surprised at how grass-like it
was," she said. "It seems like the new turfs are a compromise between traditional turf and hard-to-predict grass."
The field hockey program looks to benefit significantly
from the project because of the nature of the sport. "Field
hockey as a sport is moving toward artificial surfaces,"
said Borbee, who resigned as field hockey coach after the
end of last season. "[The new surface] plays to our
strengths as a team. We have skilled players and a good
grass game. It's definitely an advantage."
Cloonan agreed with Borbee and thought the team
would not suffer from adjusting to both a new surface and
a new coach. "I feel like it's best to change everything at
once," Cloonan said. "If we go into the season with an open
mind and a good mindset, then the program will go far."
Men's lacrosse head coach Pat Gress is also excited
about playing on a new surface. "I think it's a better surface, and it seems like it's safer. People who have it say
that it's safe and consistent, and they're very happy with
it." He also said that his team "seems to be excited about
it."
While men's lacrosse and field hockey will have the
new-and-improved Clothier Field as their official game
field, the use of the facility won't be limited to the two
sports. According to Hertz, "We'll be able to expand practice schedules, expand intramurals. [The facility] will satisfy those demands." Borbee also emphasized the importance of schedule flexibility, noting that "lights are key.
We're going to have to be able to use the field a lot."
The department is banking on the use of new lighting
systems that are more friendly to the surrounding human
and animal communities. Traditionally, "spill light" produces light pollution, something that tends to irk nearby
homeowners. "Lighting technology has improved dramatically in the past few years," Hertz said. "You could be 20
feet from the field and not know there are lights on the

field." He also said the college would adhere to any and all
of the borough's codes and regulations.
The project awaits final Board of Managers approval
this weekend. Hertz said that the estimated cost for the
project, $2 million, falls within the expected range, and he
thinks there will be little resistance among board members. The company the athletic department is recommending as contractor to the BOM is local Beynon Sports. The
contractor will install and maintain the field while it is
under warrantee and will also oversee the pouring and
resurfacing of the track in late August and early
September.
After the extensive delays in last summer's athletic

quick to emphasize that this is not the final solution to the
continued field usage problem. "Everyone needs to have a
place to do their thing," Borbee said. "The resurfaced field
will help, but we can't stop at this, think that it's all we
need, because it's not."
Hertz made it clear that "we're not gaining anything.
We're satisfying a need that existed." The athletic department includes the club teams and intramurals program in
their long-term vision. "We will need to have more fields
because of overlap issues and because of the added stress
from sports camps," Hertz said.
Borbee, who serves on a large number of committees,

including the Athletic Review Committee, mentioned the
possibility of expansion across the Crum but stressed that
such a move is still in the "research and investigation
phase."
But while the decision behind the possibility of Crum

dering if they'll be able to use the field next fall. "I'm optimistically realistic," said Borbee. "I'm optimistic that it'll
get done, but I'm realistic in that it's inevitable that things
will happen."
The department has been discussing a project schedule
fairly extensively with the contractors to minimize the
impact construction will have on student-athletes. "We're
waiting to get a revised construction schedule from
Beynon Sports Surfaces," Hertz said. "My understanding
is that to delay starting the beginning of May after track
season will push back the final completion date until midSeptember. The goal for when student-athletes get back in
mid-August is to be able to use the field already."
The main factor in the timing of construction is the
track. If Beynon were to start earlier than the beginning of
May, the track and field team would find themselves without a home. Hertz also mentioned that the pouring of the
new track is extremely dependent on weather conditions,
and that the college would have a better, longer lasting
track if the base was poured in late August rather than
mid-July.
Despite the uncertainty, Hertz is adamant that the field
will be ready for the fall season. "It will be done," he said.
While awaiting the BOM's approval, the department is

Garnet women hold
off F&M to make
conference finals
Tide to defend Centennial Conference
title against Green Terror on Saturday
BY BRENDAN KARCH
bkarchl@swarthmore.edu
Katie Robinson 'O4 may have been
named the Centennial Conference Player
of the Year, but in last night's semifinal
playoff game at Franklin & Marshall, it
was forward Heather Kile 'O2 who played
the starring role.
Kile scored the game's final six points
as women's basketball weathered a dangerous second-half comeback, pulling out
a 61-56 win over F&M.
The win gives the Garnet a chance to
defend last year's conference title at
Western Maryland on Saturday. The

last night, 53-52.
Swarthmore had a 55-40 lead with six
minutes left in the game, but the
Diplomats went on a 16-0 run to take a 5655 lead with 1:30 remaining.
Kile broke the run on a layup with 56
seconds left and then grabbed two
rebounds on consecutive defensive stops.
She converted four freethrows in the final
minute to seal the victory.
Kile led the Garnet with 18 points and
13 rebounds. Ali Furman 'O3 contributed
18 points, going 3-for-4 from three-point
range in the first half, and Robinson

added 14 points.
Swarthmore shot 46 percent from the
field in the game and 54.5 percent in the
first half. Much of the team's scoring
came on outside jumpers, especially in
the first half.
The Garnet's success hinged on their
ability to break the F&M full-court press.
Swarthmore worked on the press extensively in practice Monday and Tuesday,
and the work paid off
the team was
able to break the press the entire game.
Both teams showed high intensity on
defense, resulting in a lot of hustle plays
and jump balls.
The Garnet went up 18-10 in the first
half. But F&M took a three-point lead
with 30 seconds remaining before
Furman hit a three-point shot in the closing seconds to tie the game at the half, 2828.

Senior guard Amy Kreitz led F&M
with 18 points, while senior center Amy
Abernathy netted 14 points and grabbed
20 rebounds.
The win for Swarthmore avenged a 6244 loss at F&M earlier in the season. The
team shot just 21 percent from the floor in
that game, its worst shooting performance on the season. Robinson sat out the
game to attend to a personal matter. Last
season, the Garnet beat the Diplomats in

semifinal game.
The loss was just the second for F&M
in the team's last 17 games. The

the regular season, 62-42 at Johns
Hopkins, but had won their previous 15
games.
Earlier in the week, Robinson was
named Centennial Conference Player of
the Year. She and teammate Kile are the
only two sophomores to ever win the
award. Voting is conducted by the coaches of the 11 conference teams, and coaches cannot vote for players on their own

team.

Robinson led the conference in scoring
with 19.6 points per game and steals with
4.21 per game. She was named Conference
Player of the Week four times and set the
all-time single-game scoring record this
season with a 40-point performance
against Johns Hopkins.
Kile was voted to the all-conference
team for her fourth consecutive year. She
is the only player ever to make the firstteam all conference squad each of her
four years. Kile was third in the conference in scoring with 18.7 points per game
and second in rebounding with 10.7 per

The Garnet finished the regular season at home Saturday with a dominating
win over Haverford, 59-35. Robinson led

the

Centennial Conference playoffs.
Western Maryland has never won the
conference title and was not expected to
make the playoffs just two weeks ago. But
strong play down the stretch lifted the
Green Terror to a seven-game winning
streak, including a victory over Johns
Hopkins Monday in a tiebreaker game for
the final playoff spot. The team now has a

21-6 record (12-4 conference) and is 11-1 at
home. Swarthmore's record stands at 20-6
(13-3 conference).
The Garnet beat Western Maryland at
home on Nov. 20, 60-58, in the only
matchup this season between the two
teams. Last season Swarthmore lost to
the Green Terror away, 64-59.
A win on Saturday would give the
Garnet a berth in the NCAA Division 111

tournament. A win would also make
Swarthmore the second consecutive team
to win the conference title two years in a
row. Johns Hopkins took the conference
championship in 1999 and 2000.

Tide rising for Centennial
Conference playoff game

College to replace

Clothier Field with
synthetic turf field
$2 million facilities revamp to include
resurfacing of track, expansion of field
BY KATE NELSON-LEE

knelson2@swarthmore.edu

Associate Athletic Director Adam
Hertz has seen a lot of turf. "We have
been to Elizabethtown College, Rutgers
The
Haverford
University-Camden,
School, Messiah College, Bucknell
University, Cherry Hill Sports Complex,
Friends Select, Wyomissing High ..."
Since August, Hertz, along with Athletic
Director Bob Williams, have been
researching synthetic surfaces in hopes
of upgrading Clothier Field.
Enclosed by the outdoor track,
Clothier Field has been an obvious focal
point for the athletic department over the
past year. Sometimes referred to as "the
old football field," it sits in a prime location for showcasing the athletic department's facilities. But the field is unsuitable for sports other than football and
men's lacrosse because it is too narrow.
With football gone, the department was
left with a big question: what to do with
Clothier Field?
Additionally, the surrounding track
has reached the end of its life expectancy:
Bubbles and rippling leave the surface

nearly unusable. Originally scheduled to
be resurfaced last summer, the project
was postponed, according to head
lacrosse coach Karen Borbee, "because
we were waiting on this kind of decision.
We wanted to do [the field and track] projects together because it was more con-

venient."
Add a newly hired Hertz to the equation, and you get a soon-to-be finalized $2
million facility. Scheduled for this summer is an expanding field with a new-generation synthetic surface enclosed by a
resurfaced track. After looking at over 13
different kinds of synthetic surfaces,
including the more traditional Astroturf
fields at Centennial Conference members
Johns Hopkins and Muhlenberg College,
the athletic department has decided to go
with a synthetic surface known as
Sofsport.

The benefits of the new generation of
turfs leave little to be desired. "It's difficult to call the new generation of turfs
turf. They're more of a synthetic grass,"
Hertz said. "They are safer than grass: no
ruts, no inconsistencies in texture or
