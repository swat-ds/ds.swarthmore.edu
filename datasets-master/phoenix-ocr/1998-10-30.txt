On Monday, October 19, the

to Charter Committee for a charter soit could receive money from
Budget Committee. The club,
however, did not receive a charterbecause the committee had adjourned before Ballroom &
Swing's set appointment time.
The Ballroom & Swing Club
meets on Mondays and Tuesdays,
usually attracting 80 to 100 dancers to Tarble All-Campus Space
for swing dancing, and 15 to 30
dancers for ballroom dancing.
This semester, students have
volunteered as dance instructors.
The student instructors, however,
no longer have time to give and
have taught all the steps they
know. The club's leaders decided
that they must hire professional
instructors to maintain the club .
"After students have learned
the basic steps, there's little anyone can do until we can hire new
instructors," said Allan Friedman

president.

Swing Club seeks charter, funding

hire the professional instructors.
Yura Shubin '99, President of
the Ballroom & Swing Club, contacted Jared Solomon 'Ol, Charter Committee Chair, and asked
him when he could meet with
Charter Committee to have Ballroom & Swing's charter proposal
reviewed. Solomon scheduled an
8:30 pm appointment for Shubin
on Monday, October 19, but later
rescheduled the appointment for
9:30.
When Shubin arrived for the
9:30 meeting, however, he found
Solomon waiting for him with the
news that several committee
members had had to leave before
Shubin's scheduled appointment,
so the meeting had adjourned earlier than expected, and his charter could not be reviewed that
night.
"We had a lot of proposals to
go through. I thought [the meeting] would run until 9:30.1 was
wrong," said Solomon.
Solomon, who accepts responsibility for the mistake, contacted Charter Committee members and asked if they could vote
on the charter over e-mail before
the Budget Committee meeting
on Sunday, October 25. If the
charter were approved, Shubin
could still go before Budget Committee that week.

Around 11:00 pm, Solomon
emailed Shubin, saying that the
committee had not approved his
charter. Solomon said that the
Ballroom & Swing Club would
have to wait two weeks until after the next meeting of Charter
Committee before going before
Budget Committee.
Most ofthe Charter Committee members abstained in the email vote, citing concerns with the
proposed budget that they wished
to discuss in person Solomon
defended this decision.
"It's justreally trying to help,
a two-tier process [of Charter
Committee reviewing a proposed
budget before Budget Committee] to make things run smoother.
It's not trying to slow down the
process, it's trying to make it more
efficient so when it gets to Budget Committee it expedites the
process," he explained.
His explanation did not satisfy Shubin. "Why does Charter
Committee care about our budget? Isn't that Budget
Committee's concern?" Shubin
said.
On Sunday, Shubin went before Budget Committee anyway,
but without a charter, he could not
obtain a budget.
Solomon hopes to improve
the two-step process of applying
.

for a charter and then a budget.
"[I hope to] introduce new rules
to enhance the charter process to
make it efficient and comprehensive," he said. I think that by the
end ofthe semester, Charter Committee will be more able to help

organizations."

The Ballroom & Swing
Club continues to wait for a
charter. Shubin will bring the
charter proposal before Charter
Committee this Monday, where
Solomon feels it will likely be
approved. If it is approved, Ballroom & Swing could go before
Budget Committee at their next
meeting, on Sunday, November
8.
However, if the charter is not
approved, the Ballroom & Swing
Club may be forced to fold.
"If our charter is not approved, the club would sadly not
succeed for too long because
we're running out of resources,"
said Friedman.

Public Safety announces dog ordinance crackdown

Wharton residents enjoy new courtyard

Students enjoy Wharton cats
by Jeff Heckelman
Staff Writer

In the hectic mayhem of

daily life we call college, it is

sometimes easy to lose sight of
some of the simpler pleasures in
life. But for Wharton residents,
there is a constant source of a
simple smile, if nothing else. By
now most of the campus has at
least heard about the cats that
hang out in Wharton courtyard,
but few are aware of just what a
calming effect they can have on
a stressed-out soul through just a
few minutes of attention.
Brought here by an unidentified Wharton resident, there are
two cats: a white cat rumored to
be deaf but friendly and a calico
with a total of 24 toes, six on each
paw. Their "disabilities" take
nothing away from their person-

alities, and perhaps even give
them character. There are rumors
about a third cat, calico with
white paws and normal toes and
friendlier than the other two, but
they have yet to be confirmed.
The cats remind observers of
a simpler life. They frolic together, chase squirrels (their primary purpose, it seems) and have
a good time in general. Some
even derive entertainment from
theirfrequent playfulroughhousing.
"I'll bet the white one could
kick the s*** out of the other
one," offered Kuan Chin 'O2.
Silly as it may sound, this is
just one of those things, like the
leaves changing color, that serve
as a reminder to us that certain
things in life are here merely to
be enjoyed, and that we should
enjoy them while we can.

Swat Public Safety issued
a warning in the Oct. 15
Weekly News as a result of
state and borough dog ordinance laws being disobeyed
by members of the Swarthmore community. The brief
notice stated that members of
the Swarthmore community
are obligated to conform to
both state and borough dog ordinances which require that
dogs be confined within an
enclosure, firmly secured by
means of a collar and leash,
or be under the control of and
in close proximity to their
owners or custodians. Dogs
are also prohibited from pur-

suing, menacing, or harassing

persons lawfully going about
their business, whether on
public or private property.
This recent crackdown on
enforcement of the dog ordinance is a result of infractions
to the ordinance brought to the
attention of Public Safety by
members of the Swarthmore
community, primarily faculty
and visitors.
There have been no serious incidents such as bites or
injuries as a result of ordinance negligence; the most
common and visible violation
is that of dogs running freely
across Parrish Beach in the
presence of their owners.

Cram masturbator subverts
dominant sexual ideology
Dear Editor:
The recent manhunt for the Crum masturbator raises significant questions regarding the priorities of our community. Our
question is: What the hell? We all realize the years of trauma
that the "victim" of this "crime" is destined to suffer, but what
about the lonely, compulsive, unsatisfied, scrawny man who was
left unsatiated?
Given the pressures on our limited Public Safety Department, is it prudent for us to devote precious time and resources
chasing down this reclusive woodsman when there are illegally
parked cars begging to be booted all over campus?
Our Public Safety officers should discharge their proper
duties and leave this man to discharge his. After all, he is doing
society a favor by not perpetuating the constructs society has
established regarding sexual.relationships. By coming back to
nature, he has avoided the seemingly inescapable dynamic of the
two-person relationship, wherein one inevitably establishes
emotional hegemony over the other.
Although it was noted that "Swarthmore has had an average
of two or three indecent exposure incidents a year," we believe
that this figure is much higher.
Coincidentally, one of these incidents occurred the same day
the Crum encounter was reported by the Phoenix. It involved
over 20 buck naked exhibitionists and fully 300 willing victims,
many of whom offered financial support for this parallel act.
As the recent 'Dactyl and Tibet chalkings on this campus
show, Swarthmore still has a vibrant political life. We urge
everyone to stand tall and defend the rights of a man who is
single-handedly blazing a path towards a new sexual paradigm.

Hate speech deserves same
exposure as Crum incident
Dear Editor:
Last Wednesday afternoon, every student, faculty, and staff
member received a "public safety awareness bulletin" from Terri
Narkin concerning the presence of a naked man in Crum woods
five days previously. Later, I learned from the Phoenix that the
man had been masturbating. Even given this additional info, it is
unclear to me in what way his actions posed a threat to the
college community.
Last year, queer and queer-friendly students held a series of
meetings with the dean's staff to discuss the college's response
to anti-gay incidents. One of our achievements was to secure the
deans' agreement that anti-gay incidents pose a threat to public
safety, and that when they occur, a public safety bulletin should
be sent out. There have been several anti-gay incidents this year,
and none of them has resulted in a public safety bulletin.
It has been argued that sending out emails about anti-gay
incidents will result in students no longer taking such bulletins
seriously. But we've gotten two bulletins in the last year about
cases of indecent exposure with no apparent harassing intent. So
that argument doesn't make sense to me.
It has been fulfilling to watch the administration take so
many steps to make Swarthmore more queer-friendly. I hope
that following through on the classification of anti-gay incidents
as a threat to public safety will be the next step.

Manipulative mass media holds up
Shepard as mainstream, acceptable gay
by Corey Datz-Greenberg
Opinions Editor
Two weeks ago, Matthew
Shepard was brutally lynched
in Wyoming. His death was
sensational—his body was
tied to a wooden fence, beaten
and torn, in the cold Wyoming
autumn —and the ensuing media reaction was no less sensational. In response, vigils
for Matthew—as we've come
to call him—were held in cities and at colleges across the
country. The vigil in Washington,
D.C.,
served as a
grunting
arena
for
savvy politicians, while
the vigil in
New
York
City became a
much more
emotionally
intense expression of
anger towards
——-,

nessof gay rights issues? Tim
Stewart-Winter wrote last
week, in part, that one of the
lessons of Matthew is that we
aren't as safe here as we think
we are. After all—and forgive
me, Tim, for a slight manipulation of your words, but the
point must be made —he was
a white college student like
many of us (did anybody notice the racial makeup of the
Matthew Shepard vigil? It
wasn't all white, but it was
close), and look what happened. Are we really all so
dense as to need to be reminded that
people are
killed
for
their sexual
practices and
their gender
bents by being hit over
the head with
the story of
Matthew, the
model gay?
The answer,
apparently, is
yes.
I don't
deny that the
story of Matthew will be a
boon to the gay rights movement and will create national
sympathy for the plights of
gays (men at least) more than
any other event in world history ever has. I am perfectly
fine with laying my chin on
my chest and resignedly saying that this country has a
messed up sense of what love
means and who deserves it, but
that, for many people, this is
the only way they will listen.
However, why is it that
Swatties must play the same
game and be just as much the
pawns of media manipulations
as everyone else? After years
of discussions about identity
politics, to the point that
people were tired of even the
mention, it is time that we start
incorporating our heightened
awareness into the way we
look at the everyday world.
After all, we didn't need the
story of Matthew to remind us
that gay people are murdered —we know this. Many
of us are politically active in
the gay rights movement any__—

We don't need

Certainly, our

collective
consciousness was in high
gear—the gay rights movement has a martyr, and we all
love him, and we all understand his humanity in a way
that we've never understood
anybody else's particular humanity in the history of our
movement.
Of course—and this is the
part nobody wants to think too
much about—Matthew is not
just any ordinary queer. He is,
in fact, the model American,
the Aryan ideals—Matthew
was white, middle class,
Christian, well-mannered,
(heretofore white, etc.) and
yeah, he happened to be gay.
One newspaper article described him as someone who
you would feel comfortable
taking care of your grandmother —whoa, there's a lot of
political and social history tied
up in that statement, huh? The
fact is that we were all duped
by the media into feeling remorse for their prototype.
The question is, what does
this say about the motivations
for our current acute aware-

Ambrose Bierce, who periodically published satirical definitions of a multitude of words in newspapers for about ten

ideal to awaken our consciousness. Is this elitist? Yes, of
course it is. But SQU and

might have.

The vigil was for Matthew.
We chose to send our collective sadness to the creation of
a corrupt media manipulation
and the product of a soulless
society.
Ben Maulbeck shared an
amazing and powerful peace,
with whose content I had no
quarrel. He said that Matthew
made the hardest choice of all:
he chose love. Love, here, is
the romantic love of his natural proclivities. He loved men
romantically because he was
gay. He was courageous because he did not let a homophobic society tell him who
he could love. However, the
kind of love expressed for
Matthew at the vigil was not
the kind of love which is determined by sexual orientation
(or was it? How important is
it to this discussion that he was
cute enough to be a model for
the most elite web porn?).
This was the love we are supposed to give to all humans,
regardless of their sexual orientation or any other quality
thereof. Nonetheless, the
presence of his spirit can only
be attributed to the fact that
he's white, etc. The only reason we love Matthew more

by David King

Staff Writer
Dear Prospective Applicant,

Thank you for requesting information about Swarthmore College. Enclosed in this packet you'll find the
standard documentation about the college: nice glossy brochures with statistical information, a book of classes
we offer and a form letter from our
president extolling the virtues of this
school.

However, we'd like to take this

opportunity to express to you our own

feelings about Swarthmore. First and
foremost, we believe that this school,
located in a picturesque suburb of
Philadelphia with a low crime rate, provides a safe, supportive atmosphere for
its students. Granted, the Swarthmore
borough police bought a high-powered
rifle last year. And yes, we have had
problems with unidentified men exposing themselves and performing indecent acts in various locations around
the college. But Swarthmore still remains a place where all students can
feel secure and comfortable in being
themselves.
■' Well, okay, there was that incident
last year between some Spanish-speaking students walking the campus and
an unknown person who yelled, "Why
don't you go back to where you came
from?" Yes, the Swarthmore Queer
Union's board was vandalized several

times over the course of this year. And
one student did find some homophobic words scrawled on his door (and
he wasn't even gay!).
Otherwise, though, this secluded
campus is a warm environment where
students can have fun without worrying about their safety. And in relation to other comparable schools,
Swarthmore has few alcohol-related
problems.
Of course, it would be only fair
to tell you that our much-anticipated
annual Halloween party was canceled
this year because of concerns over
underage drinking and physical damage that might be caused to the dorm
where it's held. Also, three sophomores were arrested at the beginning
of the semester on alcohol-related
charges. And... sigh... an intoxicated
individual did jump out of a window
\s&\ IS9Bthj and another did urinate
on an RA's door last year.
• But Swarthmore is nonetheless a
wonderful place to spend four years.
Our dedicated student government
works very hard for the student
body—despite the fact that the Student Council Treasurer resigned at
the beginning of the semester out of
lack of enthusiasm. And, again, we
have a safe community, where students can leave their doors unlocked
without a second thought (although
several unattended laptops were stolen from the library last year, and the
company that provides and services
the college's laundry machines has
threatened to remove them because

of vandalism).

Now, one thing on which we
pride ourselves immensely is our
campus. Oh, our wide, sweeping
lawns and beautiful trees do make for
an ideal physical environment. Unfortunately, not every rising sophomore who wants a room on campus
gets one, and parking has been a miner source of contention. But every
school has its slight inconveniences,
right?
Please, take a moment now to
browse through our slick, neatly laid
out brochures. If you still have questions, don't hesitate to call or e-mail
us. The aforementioned problems
notwithstanding, we think you'll find
Swarthmore to be the supportive,
tight-knit, community which we
claim.

Sincerely,

The Admissions Staff

majority of American children.
Al doesn't even support broadened sexual education, a must
for any effort to increase
awareness of and acceptance
for issues which affect sexual
minorities. But on a broader
level, as a member of the Republican Senate, D'Amato will
have the opportunity to restrict
abortion services, decrease
educational opportunities for
the nation's majorities (per
capita, not per dollar—per dollar, the nation's majorities will
have better education), create
more prisons and feed the atmosphere which allowed the
police of New York to brutalize a group of peaceful Matthew vigil keepers this last
week. Having a Republican
friend to the gays in this case
means going against the endorsements of other liberal
lobbyists—the ACLU, NOW,
the NAACP and more. Apparently, we should realize, gay
rights do NOT stand alone.
So, while the story of Matthew will increase positive
press for gay rights, it will also
serve to further alienate the
non-ideal from the gay rights

movement. We hear the message loud and clear: gay people
have every right to exist as long

Well, my point has been
made—Swarthmore's visible
queers have a terrible case of selective amnesia. Do we not remember when we too were oppressed? And how we felt when
feminists denied lesbians a place
in their movement, or when radical leftists fighting for racial
equality advanced the heterosexual paradigm at our expense?
While it is an opportune
time to join a rising gay movement, Swatties need to beware
they do not forget the political
implications of feeding the institutional oppressions of those
not as privileged as they are. We
don't need the death of a pretty
white boy to raise our awareness
that injustice fights back against
our liberal rhetoric. Or else
maybe we do. And in 30 years
when we're comfortable queer
yuppies, and the active racism,
etc., continues to fight back
against our nation's youth,
maybe we won't care then either. Perhaps gay rights are our
only cause. In that case, screw
justice.

I, like everyone at Swarthmore, love this
dear little college with all my heart, soul
and mind. But every once in a while, you
just have to let it out. So here's a brief list
of things that drive me crazy as I try to navigate this beautiful and arboreal campus
while just minding my own business.
1) People who decide that they need to
have a long and expressively-gestured conversations in the narrow passage-ways of
Sharpies. If you need to talk to your friends,
do so in large areas where I, with my tray
of breakable objects, can pass by you. When
you stand in the dessert/fruit bar and discuss why you couldn't write your twelvepage paper on liberation theology in modern Liechtenstein, you're in my way. I believe one of the cardinal virtues of liberalism is a concern for your fellow man, so be
concerned for some one you can actual help
here and now. This also applies to people
who have long and fascinating discussions
in between the soda fountains and the main
stairs. Again, no one can pass by you there.
Move, and be a friend to your fellow man/
woman/squirrel.
2) Chalkings
any kind, anywhere. I
don't care if they proclaim me, as a member of the white race, to have divine power
over everyone else in or under the earth; I
don't like them. Their primary function, it
seems to me, is provide The Phoenix with
stories.And while I'm sure the editorial staff
would consider this a noble goal, I am supremely skeptical. Also, to address the most
recent chalkings briefly, regardless of my
personal position on homosexuality, I don't
think drawing explicit pictures of intimate
acts of a gay or heterosexual nature is appropriate. Call me a Puritan, but I think
some people might be offended by that, regardless of what sex was doing what to
whomever. And clean up the language, too.
If I can't hear the word on NBC, I don't
want to see it walking to French.

space in all of this great world, it is the bath-

very important and demands my immediate
and thorough attention, but for just three
minutes out of my entire life, I want to read
the sports section and forget that all of the
reporting in it is colored by the racist and
classist peccadillos of a Anglo-centric, patriarchal society. I just want to see the score
of the Steelers game, because local television has to show the Eagles and whatever
terrible New York team happens to be losing.
4) Your music. I like U2; I love U2; I
have every freaking album U2 has ever made
and most of the singles. But right now, I
don't want to listen to U2 because I am trying to write a paper on something I don't
understand. I know this is hard for many of
you to understand, but some of us less smart
people can't listen to music and work at the
same time. Call it a genetic fault. I can only
concentrate on one thing at a time, and right
now, sadly, that has to be to what extent Plato
and Aristotle would agree on the moral lesson of "Antigone." And the bass line to
"Semi-Charmed Life" isn't helping.
5)Your soul is worth more than a T-shirt
or a sticker. I'm all for whatever agitprop
group is sitting at the table in the Sharpies
lobby pronouncing the imminent downfall
of civilization if we continue to allow callous and heartless ocean waves destroy the
rocks of our beaches, turning them into sand.
But if you don't believe in what they're saying, don't sign your name to their petition
for a t-shirt. I know you like t-shirts; so do
I. But you conscience should be worth more
than a 50-50 poly/cotton blend. This is the
typical conversation I have after walking
through the lobby:
Me: What did you sign in there?
Bob: A petition to enforce vegetarianism on the entire world. You want a hamburger?
Me: (crying) Sure.

Proposed Hate Crimes Act is problematic
Jonathan Pyle
Contributing Writer

In the wake of Matt Shepard's
death, gay activist groups have clamored for the passage ofthe Federal Hate
Crimes Act. But before we write to our
congresspeople, we should read the bill
and consider whether we really want
"hate crime" laws.
Congress defines a "hate crime" as
"a crime in which the defendant intentionally selects a victim... because of
the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation of any person." The emotion of hate is neither a
sufficient nor necessary condition. One
could assault a yuppie, a Vietnam War
veteran, or a woman out of prejudicial
hate, and law would add no penalty.
Like all laws that apply to specific
groups, hate crime laws are bound to
be under-inclusive. They raise the risk
that different groups in society will
compete for protection. For example,
some advocacy groups opposed the inclusion of gender as a protected category, because there are so many
mysogynistic crimes against women
that resources would be taken away
from combatting racial hate crime.
But this sort of competition contradicts the premise of the Federal hate
crimes bill, which is that violence
against these protected groups "poses
a serious national problem." Violence
targeted at women is clearly a serious
problem. So why should gender not
be a category?
The bill further claims that "such
violence disrupts the tranquility and
safety of communities and is deeply
divisive." Many supporters agree, and
argue that "hate crimes" deserve
greater penalties because violence targeted at a member of a group injures
everyone in that group.
But American law does not normally respect the concept of group
rights. Much free speech, from slogans
like "hate is not a family value," to
statements like "homosexuality is a
sin" makes large groups of people feel
offended and uncomfortable.
Hate crime laws try to achieve a
kind of social justice, but at the expense
of individual notions of justice. Nearly
all crimes are committed with socially
deplorable intents. But if I am attacked
by someone who thinks I am a "fag,"
and my friend is attacked for holding
a pro-choice placard, why do I deserve
to see my assailant stay in jail for ten
years longer than my friend's assailant?
Hate crime laws might be susceptible to First Amendment challenges.
Although speech is action and actions
speak, government cannot normally
punish illegal actions for their speech
content. For instance, cross-burning is
both vandalism and hate speech, but
the Supreme Court has said that it is
unconstitutional for states to punish it

as anything more than vandalism. Government can side-step theFirst Amend-

ment, however, by increasing penalties
for crimes committed with hateful intent, just as it can give different penalties for different degrees of murder.
But there is a fine line between intent and thought, and hate crime investigations can intrude on legitimate liberties. Prosecutors looking for extra
penalties can try to expose defendants
as racists or homophobes. In one hate
crime case involving an inter-racial dispute at a campground, a white defendant was asked to prove that he was
not a racist by naming good friends of
his who were black. Hate crime investigations can tend to put the
defendant's beliefs on trial, prejudicing juries to deliver a judgment against
the hate rather than against the crime.
In the political arena, hate crime
laws send a powerful message about
our country's values, but in the courtroom, they are merely a powerful tool
for lawyers to increase penalties. Disregarding the intentions of the law,
many white victims and white juries
have used hate crime law to get increased penalties for black offenders
(After all, in 15% of violent crimes,
the victim is white with a black offender, compared to just 2% in which
the victim is black and the offender
white.)
It is easy to demand that Congress do something about the problem of hate crime, but it is hardly
obvious that the Federal government
has jurisdiction over this area of
criminal law. Does anti-gay crime
really interfere with interstate commerce, as it must if the bill is to be
Constitutional? In the South during
the 19605, prejudiced police forces
needed Federal oversight. But is
there evidence that local authorities

in the 1990s have not properly investigated crimes against homosexuals?
Even if the Federal government
had jurisdiction, it would make little
concrete difference. Under the current
Federal hate crime law, the government
has prosecuted fewer than six out of
10,000 cases of hate crime each year,
and nothing suggests that the new bill
would increase that figure significantly.
Thus, the bill is chiefly symbolic.
Far from cracking down on hate crime,
it would merely give the Federal government a chance to send in the F.8.1.
to investigate the highest-profile cases,
so that Congress and the President can
take credit for fighting bigotry.
But some supporters argue that the
bill's symbolism is its value. Because
law can influence morality, perhaps the
mere existence ofhate crime laws will
dampen anti-gay rhetoric. If teenagers
could watch hate crime trials on Court
TV, and see how words like "fag" are
so closely associated with evil deeds,
then perhaps they would taunt each
other less with anti-gay insults.
Employing a vague notion of
harm, some argue that repugnant biases make a crime more harmful to
society. Using similarly vague notions
of harm, others have argued that sodomy, which a majority of people also
find repugnant, is ultimately detrimental to society. Hate and homosexuality
are not punishable, the arguments go,
but the actions that result from them
are. If we allow government to protect
us from ineffable harms, and we accept the idea that government can punish actions without punishing the ideas
behind them, then sodomy laws will
always exist alongside hate crimelaws,
and homosexuals will find no refuge
in the law's tradition of civil liberty,
because law will merely reflect our
society's confused values.

Swarthmore was the only school in
the nation to have an undefeated
record against the Navy, and all students took great pride in this fact.
Before the days of SAC funding and
College-sponsored parties were the
days of the fraternities and the highly
influential Greek scene.
The first fraternities were formed
as secret societies without faculty
support in 1888. These included
Kappa Beta Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi
(now known as Phi Psi), Delta Upsilon (which was the product of a
merging of two fraternities, Pi Kappa
Omicron and Delta Upsilon), Phi
Sigma Kappa, and Phi Delta Theta.
Not to be outdone, women also
formed fraternities of their own, including Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi
Beta Phi. Over the years the number
of women's fraternities would come
to six, and the men's would fluctuate between five and seven.

fraternities and the rest of the campus continues to this day, although

Swarthmore's oldest and most illustrious association of students isn't a support group, a theater company, or a campus club. Its members don't chalk the

fact, this group is not associated with any
department or specific social cause. It is
the Delta Upsilon Fraternity, and without a doubt, a mainstay on the Swarthmore campus.
I know what you're thinking, but DU
is more than just a place to hang out and
get drunk on a Saturday night.
Swarthmore's chapter of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity is over a hundred years
old and part of a national fraternity that
is even older. Past rosters are chock full
infamous names including Hallowell,
McCabe and Sharpies. Current DU president Charley Parlapanides '99 says that
the frat is all about brotherhood, service,
and fellowship. When the frat was
founded a 107 years ago as Pi Kappa
Omicron it was primarily comprised of
farmers' sons, and based on blue-collar
values. Times have changed,
Parlapanides explains, but the fraternity
members still hold these same values.
Accordingly, DU is involved in several service projects, including SHIP,
blood drives on campus and the Big
Brother/Big Sisters program ofDelaware
County. "We do a lot ofthings we're not
obligated to do," Parlapanides says.
DU also maintains a strong connection to its alumni, some of the college's
most well-known graduates, including
Lamb Miller (for whom the field house
is named), commissioner of the NFL.
The frat hosts monthly meetings for area
DU alumni and Parlapanides says that

typically five to six alumni attend. The
frat also hosts annual alumni pig roasts
that usually draw about 35 graduates.
Despite this, DU still can't seem to
kick their negative reputation around
campus. Parlapanides feels that there is
a general anti-frat sentiment amongst
Swatties. "It's cool among Swatties to
dis the frats," he says. "They'll come to
our parties but then talk about how they
hate DU."
"I think it is really a shame that the
campus perceives us as being only football players and jocks," says
Parlapanides. "People see one or two
guys who play football and they think
everyone in the frat does. But that's not
true." He points out that only 12 of the
30 brothers are actually on die football
team.
Nevertheless, DU's somewhat amorphous relationship to the football team
has cast the frat as a bunch of dumb jocks?
Parlapanides maintains that this view is
just not true, pointing out that all of the
DU brothers got into Swat just like the;
rest ofthe student body. "I play football,*!:
he says, "but I'm really into film and I
can sit and talk to you about art history."
But Parlapanides can talk about art
history all day and still not convince some
members of the tri-co community that
DU members won't harass women who
go to their parties. "We don't condone;

We don't condone it."
But to Parlapanides, none of this is

to show up for a coat and tie event with
the alumni that weekend, and the treasurer was incensed. We walked across
campus to the fraternity house. None
of us knew what was coming.

small back room about 10 feet by 10

led me into a bright room and took off
my pillowcase. I couldn't see anything,
but I could hear the guys behind me in
the room, all cussing and screaming. I
could hear everyone just a few feet in
front of me, but all I could see was the
blinding light. Next, they held out my
arms in the crucified position and put
something in my hands. Then they
asked me questions "Pledge ****, why
did you join?" etc. No matter what I
answered, I was wrong and was yelled
at. "You fucking dumb shit, that's your
pledge pin", "you
fucking idiot." Finally when they
got tired of harassing me and were
ready for the next
pledge, they led
me into a room
and knelt me in
front of a static TV
screen with a pole
in my hands. They
left me there for
15 minutes and
told me to think
about what the fraternity meant to me.
2:30 a.m. Finally we were released. But before I could go, I was
pulled me back into the ten by ten with
5 or 6 other guys. I was sure I was in
trouble, but it turned out the president
wanted to give us a speech about us
being the leaders of the fraternity, the
guys who could keep everyone bonded
together through all the hazing. Afterwards, I walked home along in the
damp night, feeling totally exhausted
but somehow cleansed.
Tuesday: 6:00 p.m. Study hall. On
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
nights all pledges have mandatory
study hall for three hours in the library.
In order to stay in the frat, you have to
earn at least a 2.5. GPA. Not really so
bad, but you can't totally slack off either.
9:00 p.m. Tonight was big brother
reviewing night, a tradition at most fraternities where you find out who your
"big brother" mentor will be for the rest
ofthe semester, the guy who will guide
you through all the activities.
We were led into a small room,
dimly lit, covered all over in black trash
bags and separated from another room
where the active members were. We
could hear them screaming, but we
couldn't see them. This time I was actually pretty scared. I felt like a moving target.
They lined us up in four teams of
six, walking around the lines and
screaming as they did it. I was fourth
in my line. The active members brought
out four pots of alcohol, one for each
line. We got instructions "Drink as
much as you can, then pass it back."
the president said, pacing around us "I
don't want it in your shirt, I want it in
your stomach. The first person to spill
has to stick their head in the trash can."
We waited tensely for a few moments,
then the race began. The actives passed
the container, a large handled cooking
pot filled with beer, to the first person
in line. "Down that right now" they
screamed in our faces as we drank
"Your big bro is watching!" Each person in line had to drink as much as he
could and pass it on to the next person
as soon as possible. Our line won the
first round, and the pledge in front of
me in line threw up. The other guys
took this opportunity to yell at him

"You pussy! I can't believe you're
throwing up!" shoving him back in line.
10:30 p.m. I settled down and
started to get buzzed, it was almost fun.
After the first round, the hidden actives
in the other room sent out cups filled
with special drinks. They would stand
in front of you and intimidate you while
you were drinking. That's all it was
about, total intimidation.
11:00 p.m. The second round
started. This time it was beer and tequila mixed together. That was when I
realized that the whole point ofthis was
to make everyone puke. By the time the
race was over, 7
or 8 guys were
chucking, and the
smell was starting
to fill the room.
One guy in my
line was like chug
chug chug barf,
and he didn't
even try to make
it to the trash can.
Chunks of vomit
caked the floor.
Between* the second and third
rounds I was one
of the guys that had to drink from the
cup. It was disgusting, but I was too
drunk to care.
11:30 p.m. When the third round
started, about half the guys were
yacking. Everybody was falling out of
line drunk. This round it was beer and
whisky in the pot. I drank a crapload.
By the end ofthe game, everybody but
me was throwing up. Everybody. It was
total sick chaos. Pretty soon I was leaning against the coke machine. "Have
you thrown up yet?" the actives asked
me. I bragged drunkenly that I hadn't.
At the end they starting going easier
on the people that were obviously
drunk, but they gave me more drinks.
Eventually, probably fearing alcohol
poisoning, they gave me water. Finally
I spit up a little. Now my nickname is
"Vietnam Vet".
12:30 a.m. They brought the
pledges into the back room, and we
had to go around to all the actives,
tasting their drinks to find out which
one was the mixed drink they had put
in the cup for us between rounds.
Whichever person had our drink was
our "big brother." Most pledges were
too drunk to taste too well, and when
they guessed wrong, all the actives
at the table would stand up and shout
"Bull fucking shit! Bull fucking
shit!" in their face.
??
a.m. Eventually, I blacked out.
When I woke up I must have told the
president that I wanted to go home. He
drove me home in my car. I guess he
helped me to the door, and my roommate took care of me. He told me the
next day I threw up on the couch.
That was big brother. Next
Wednesday is big sister. That's where
you meet your other mentor, in the sorority. I've heard the girls dress you up
in leotards and make you take a shot,
then 10 sit ups, then another shot etc.
Big sister is supposed to be a lot like
big brother, only more wild.
Wednesday 11:00 a.m.: Chore
today was what is called a "special
duty." I had to go buy a 40 oz. of Bud
Light for the house manager and get it
to him by 3:00 p.m. Five minute walk
to the local 7-11. Pretty easy.
6:00 p.m. Study Hall. Some people
say if you join a frat your grades will

you don't want them to. You just have
to use your judgement. No parties tonight.
Friday 10:00 p.m. Big party tonight with 3 fraternities and 4 sororities. Since I've been in the fraternity,
I've gone to some of the best parties of
my life. I used to get mad when I
couldn't get into frat parties because
I'm a guy. But you know what? I understand it now. Fraternity guys have
to pay the dues (about $75 a month for
us), and they don't want other guys
coming in and messing up the male
female ratio.
As usual, it was pretty good at this
party. In fact, there was a girl coming
on to me tonight. She started on the bus
between parties, grinding her hips
against me, licking my ear, etc. I kept
pulling back, which of course made her
call me a gentleman and try harder. I
swear that women have some sort of
desperation radar. Finally at the end of
the night, when I walked her back to
her room and she invited me in, I had
to tell her I had a girlfriend. She still
wanted me to call her. Ever since I
joined the fraternity, I can't believe how
many girls are attracted to me. I keep
kicking myself for not joining last semester, when I wasn't with my girlfriend. I won't give in to temptation
though.
Saturday 12:00 a.m. Tonight is
the homecoming game, and lots of the
frat alumni are back on campus. The
pledges have to hang out in the stadium
all day in our uniforms, saving spots
for the actives. We aren't allowed to
drink, in case we embarrass ourselves
in front of the alumni
7:30 p.m. I wander into the football game. We're a Division 1 school,
big stadium and everything, and the
game was really great. You can see the
alumni reverting to old times the more
drunk they get. At one point they
whipped out a beer bong and were
pouring the cans of Coors into it. Guys
in their late 20's and 30's bust out with
crazy stories.
12:00 p.m. In bed early tonight,
and sober.
Sunday: A quiet day. There's choir
practice tonight, but nothing today.
Overall, if I was asked to describe the fraternity, I would say it's
a good thing. Sometimes it gets old.
The whole semester, every day you
have to do stuff. But its worth it.
You've got cool fun stuff to do whenever you want. If you need to study,
they'll let you study. There's all kinds
of sex, and partying, and everybody
drinks. And there's lots of hazing,
which some people would say is unnecessary. But the thing is, its works.
It brings you closer together. Its the
same kind of thing as when a gang
jumps someone in, or guys go
through war together, although obviously to a much lesser extent. If
you go through shit together with
your friends, it brings you closer.
And I see it with our frat. We have
more hazing, but the guys in the frat
take it more seriously, and we're
tighter than the other frats. I've only
been a member since September, and
I already know these guys pretty
well. I see the alumni, and they're
friends for life.
I'm not a "frat boy." I like sex, but
I'm not a womanizer. But I like to party,
and I like to socialize. So the fraternity
is a good place to be. Next year, I'm
planning on moving into the house.
There are twelve bedrooms and twenty
four guys. I'm bringing my drum set.

of brotherhood, service, and scholarship, Phi Beta Sigma has constantly remained a force of change
in the African American Community. Phi Beta Sigma's focus in the
past on social issues included being instrumental in the establishing
of national and state anti-lynching
legislation in the 30's and 40's, the
elimination ofracial discrimination
and segregation in federal, state,
municipal, and county employment
in the 50's and 60's, along with the

Austin Powers, the ultimate overthe-top symbol of the swinging '6os,
will be back next year in his second

Who Shagged Me." Again with a script
by and starring Mike Myers, you can
pretty much count on more ofthe same

to be funny and sexy (lighten up, Pierce
Brosnan!) and just how little it takes in

working on the 15th draft of a middling
romantic comedy script, it's all about
lines like "and I can't believe Liberace
was gay! I mean, who was expecting
that?"). Super-spy Powers gets two
babe-elicious co-stars this time 'round,
including Heather Graham (Rollergirl
in "Boogie Nights") as his new partner, Felicity Shagwell—"Shag well by

Graham is joined by Kristen Johnson

Stability is not Their Strong Suit
It's been an entire month since the
beginning ofthe fall TV season, so nervous network execs are once again
shifting, pulling and thrusting their
shows in the neverending attempt to get
the public to stay in the sack with network TV. Fox's "Costello" and CBS's
"The Brian Ben Show" are already permanent casualties, while "Living in
Captivity," Fox's attempt to find humor
in modern race relations, and "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,"
UPN's attempt to find humor in the
bawdy Lincoln White House (which
many protesters claimed was racially
offensive, but in my opinion was just
intellectually offensive) are among the
many entrants into television's equivalent of academic probation, hiatus.
Whether they return is anyone's guess,
and although I would say let's pray they
don't, I have very little faith there's
anything decent with which to replace
them. Meanwhile, one of the few quality shows on the air, "King of the Hill,"
is getting hammered in its new spot opposite "Home Improvement." And the
big hits of the new season? The Shannon Doherty-starred "Charmed" and
"That '7os Show," two ofthe few shows
to be picked up for an entire season.

One of the most dominant forces in

week, however, that given how out of
touch we all are at Swarthmore, I may
be spending a little bit too much time
analyzing and not enough informing.
Herewith, some of the most amusing and
interesting bits of news from the entertainment world in recent weeks.

Phoenix

The Murder City Devils
Broken Bottles, Empty Hearts
Sub/Pop

These men are angry. Very angry. The only bunch of punks I can
fruitfully compare to this bunch of
punks to are the riot grrrls of bands
like Bikini Kill and Sleater Kinney.
TheDevils' music may be more tonal,
but they are just as, if not more, incensed at things, and maintain the
same kind of kiss-off attitude. There
are four men in the band, and they
are screaming—sometimes they all
scream at the same time. This album
is very raw, so much so that it might
be mistaken for a live recording. In a
way, this album almost seems retro,
at least in the sense that it is going
back to the roots of punk. There is
also a feeling, and I can't really isolate it, that this return-to-the-roots
thing is a quite calculated maneuver.
However, that really isn't much of a
stumbling block for the album, which
is most remarkable for its feeling (absent in a lot of angry hardcore bands)
and for its vigorousness.
Moe
Tin Cans and Car Tires
Sony 550
After listening to Moe's new release, Tin Cans and Car Tires, I
wondered,"Why haven't I ever heard
ofthis band before?" Moe carves out

twelve wonderfully original songs,
combining the musicality of a southern rock band like Lynrd Skynrd with
the versatile jamming style and eccentric lyrics of Phish. In addition to these
two main styles, Moe breaks into transitory fusion,funk, dixieland, and
rockabilly jams, which are tight and
masterfully executed. Vocal harmonies
and functional guitar solos highlight
most tracks. The core of the band consists of a lead guitar, rhythm guitar,
bassist/lead vocalist, drums, and uses
horns, strings, and an organ on various
songs for added depth. This album appears on the Sony 550 Music Label.

The Surfers
Songs from the Pipe
Sony

The main difference between The
Surfers and your run-of-the-mill modern rock band is that The Surfers evoke
the beauties of the natural worldof surfing in their music. On their album,
Songs From the Pipe (Sony label), this
multi-faceted trio relies on a host of
technology and on many other musicians to cut 11 songs with standard, earfriendly, verses that primarily address
subjects such as love and inner-feelings
before surfing. There are moments in
this album, specifically introductions
and breaks during the songs where the
true essence of surfing emerges. During these moments, the music takes the
listener on contemplative journeys that
conjure images of water, beaches, and
sunsets. Despite the bore of the common modern rock lyrics that occur in
large quantities on thisalbum, the music still remains almost sublime in some
songs. Having the highest possible
qualifications of ambassadors who
bridge the worlds of surfing and music, The Surfers originated in Hawaii
as three buds who surfed their brains
out during the day and wrote songs at
night. Vocalist Kelly Slater has been
described as the "Michael Jordan of
surfing," winning many of the highest
accolades possible in the surfing world.

Highly anticipated Joyner
concert not disappointing
by Patrick Boe

Staff Writer
Omaha singer-songwriter Simon
Joyner showed up at Olde Club this
Saturday night and made us all proud.
He's been a favorite among the DJs on
Swarthmore's WSRN for quite a while,
and there were quite a few people who
had been eagerly anticipating the event.
Joyner's. performance was bookended
by two other bands, Bird Dog and The
Renderers, who both also made a
strong showing. The whole evening
was an enjoyable one, if a little toned
down from the usual Olde Club fare.
Bird Dog consisted of two guys, a
drummer and the guitarist/singer. The
drummer might not be a normal part
of the band; he played with Joyner also.
The songs were mostly minor-y folk
ballads, a lot of which had an interesting kind of military pace. The singer
had a very quiet, country-boy attitude
about him; he acted like he had just
spent hundreds of hours woodshedding
in a barn in preparation for his first gig.
He seemed very self-assured, though,
and his quietness just made him more
likable. The guy playing the drums was
also very good. I found myself paying
more attention to him than to the guitarist. His style was very brush-heavy,
and he usually added more texture than
rhythm to the songs they were playing.
I got really excited when he took out a
seemingly home made shaker instrument, strapped it on to his cymbals, and
started worrying it with his drumstics.
So, though it wasn't clear exactly which
band the drummer belonged to, at least
the Bird Dog setup allowed him some
prominence on stage that he couldn't
get in Joyner's larger ensemble.
Joyner was just incredible. He
came on with a full-sized band, but he
didn't necessarily have a fuller sound
than Bird Dog did. The instrumental
work, in general, was very angular and
sparse, and only during the rousing
choruses of some of his songs did it
fill out any. When I listened to Joyner,
however, I forgot the instrumentation

While the world of surfing music is
largely associated with hardcore bands
today, this group forgoes this paradigm
and musically delineates surfing in a
more traditional manner, vaguely in the
direction ofthe Beach Boys. The Surfers are a truly unique group that produces some of themost genuine surfing, music that mainstream music has
seen. The beauty of their music far outweighs the banality of their lyricism
and modern rock influence.

cal tangents. Initially, I found this album very exciting,but my ears eventually grew weary from their charged,
elephantine sound which lacks
subtlety.

Clutch

The Elephant Riders
Sony
Contrary to the civil war motif of
their CD cover and booklet, the music
and lyrics of Clutch for the most part
lack any political or historic connections. Clutch's album, The Elephant
Riders, (Sony label) contains ten tracks
of hard rock and intermittent heavy
metal with thick, masculine vocals that
add breadth to their momentum. Clutch
consists of vocals, bass, drum and guitar, with the addition of Defeayo
Marsalis playing trombone on two
tracks. The southern plantation house
in which the band members lived while
creating this album served as the impetus for the theme of their album and
many of their songs. "Ship of Gold," a
song about the slave trade, was conceptualized when they realized that the
tool shed in their back yard was a slave
cabin.
The subject matter of each song on
this album represents a random feeling or idea that fits into rhythmically
subdivided verses, corresponding directly to the music. Clutch avoids the
controversial aspects of politics and
past events, but random historical
statements permeate their lyrics. Their
songs are littered with text-book facts,
allusions to antebellum America, and
dialects from different regions of the
country. The band regards the past as a
very important influence, with the clear
cut lyrical beginning of most of their
songs branching out on random histori-

Lisa Germano
Slide
4AD
She does such a good job, every
time! Lisa Germano, with the help
of production artist Tchad Blake, has
made another beautiful gem of pop
and noise.
"Slide" rubs you the right way
every time with its perfect electronic
textures, and then its glowing acoustic meditations. Germano gives us a
taste of what we're in for in the first
track, "Way Below the Radio" where
she grabs us with her delicate, gritty
voice and rolls us over Blake's spacy,
liquid atmosphere of sound as a driving beat straight out of a protest
march moves us on in steadfast determination.
These exquisite roomfuls of
sound pop up all over the album,
most effectively in "If I Think of
Love" and "Reptile." Germano is
equally impressive in the sparse,
lonely atmosphere of songs like "No
Color Here" and "Wood Floors." But
it is really difficult to pick out the
'good' songs on an album full of pristine, remarkable beauty. Jesus, it's
such a joy to hear!

some sense to outlaw a testosterone booster in a sport such
as running, in which sheer
strength is more or less the
whole issue, but physical fitness
plays less of a role in baseball
thin in other sports. The skills
involved in baseball are complex, especially at the bat. The
strongest man in the world
couldn't hit 70 homeruns if he
couldn't connect. McGwire's
numbers tell the story of one
who has what it takes to anticipate the whim ofthe pitcher, to
go after the hard pitches, and to
stand up in the face of incredible pressure.
The other part of this argument rests on history. Not only

that's a bad example. But the
point is, people go to the stadium to see their teams win.
They go to watch their favorite
players throw a no-hitter, turn a

go to see the visiting team get

being accepted by future generations would be for major
league baseball to outlaw the
use of andro in future seasons.
Then perhaps it could be argued
that McGwire had an artificial
advantage, especially if his
record were to stand for a long
time. However, Sammy Sosa
will always be there, only four
long balls away, and it is likely
that his record will stand as long
as McGwire's. As long as his remains, it's unlikely that fans of
future home run heroes will bitterly question the validity of
McGwire's feat, even if andro
is outlawed in the future ofMajor League ballplaying.
And what exactly does it
mean to keep the "purity" of
baseball records? Are these
people trying to imply that
keeping Cal Ripkin in the
starting lineup when he had
been batting under .200, simply in order to break the
record, was done with "purity?" I don't think so. But no
one is questioning his heroism.
Are they implying that trophies are made to collect dust
in some glass case somewhere?
Records are made to be broken,
and people do everything they
can every day of their lives to
break them. New and old heroes
might be something like new
and old friends in that old girl
scout song, "make new friends
but keep the old, one is silver
and the other's gold."
I don't think people are going to forget Roger Maris just
because he's now third on the
list. He was a legend, and he
will remain a legend. But now
we have a new hero, a hero who
is quickly becoming a legend in
his own right. Mark McGwire
did everything he could to break
that record, and he deserved every ball that flew out of the park,
even the record-breaker which
barely sailed over the fence.

first win against PCOM

by Rhiana Swartz and
Danielle Thomas
Staff Writers
The women's rugby team
travelled into Philadelphia on
Saturday to play the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic
Medicine (PCOM) and returned
to Swarthmore with their first
win.
When the final whistle blew
of the A-side game, the score
was a dominating 20-7. The Bside game was a nail-biter and
ended in a tie score of 0-0. In
both games, Swarthmore
outplayed their opponent.
The A-side game was an exciting match throughout the sixty
minutes. Swarthmore came out
strong and with aggression. The
ball was in PCOM's defensive
half for the majority of the game
and Swarthmore had many powerful pushes right at the try line
before the first try was actually
scored.
The first try was well worth
the persistence, however, and
the ball was touched down in the
try zone by forward Rhiana
Swartz 'OO after a beautiful
hand-off by back Noelle Goodin
'OO. Swarthmore's forwards and
backs continued to unite
throughout the game, but the
two different halves of the team
also dominated separate from
each other.
The backs, led by scrumhalf Meghan Brennan 'OO, tackled amazingly well throughout
the game. Cathy Vaughan 'Ol
and Abigail Stewart-Teitelbaum
'Ol were standouts in this department. The forward pack had
a great game also. Nancy Craig
'Ol and Ann Finkelstein 'Ol

played especially well and both
scrums and line-outs belonged
to the women in maroon.
The second try of the game
was scored by PCOM on a lucky
break-away. PCOM hit their
conversion kick to put themselves up by two points, but this
lead was only temporary. The
game had hardly begun for
Swarthmore.
Forward Alexa Miller 'OO
scored the next Swat try in commanding style by picking up the
ball out of a scrum and exploding through some unsuspecting
PCOM players.
At halftime, the score was
10-7 with Swat in the lead. After the break, co-captain Sarah
Cross '99 added a big chip of
insurance by taking a handoff by
Swartz and breaking the line of
defense during a penalty play.
The icing on the cake was put
on by rookie Laura Blume 'Ol
as she scored her first try in picture-book fashion after a
Vaughan assist.
The B-side game brought

standouts. Alice Hershey 'O2
propped like a pro against the

side, not allowing them to move

Laura Louison 'O2 and
Tamara Manik-Perlman 'O2
were tackling machines for
Swarthmore, bringing PCOM
women to the ground again and
again. Goodin tried her hand at
scrumhalf and looked like a
natural.
Swarthmore will try to extend their winning streak to two
games as they venture to University of Pennsylvania on Saturday. Kickoff time is 11:00 am.

Led once again by Joko

field of six behind Wellesley

Holyoke (89). Smith and Vassar
finished in fifth and sixthrespectively.
Agunloye placed second
overall in a time of 19:38, just

Later, in the first consolation
round, Emkey faced Cole

Newman's steady baseline game

all day and Emkey eventually
succumbed 6-3, 6-2. In the 7th
place playoff Emkey won by

Khurana of Brooklyn College,
at the end of his previous match.
In the first round of doubles,
Emkey and Schilla were pitted
against the 2nd seeded team of
Ben Cooke and Eric Chen, an
Ail-American last year, from
MIT. Against MlT's solid returns Emkey and Schilla could
not hold serve consistently and
lost 6-4, 6-1. The first consolation round did not prove much
easier as they were up against

the Gustavus Adolphus team of
Ryan Dussault, an Ail-American ranked #3 nationally in
doubles last year, and his partner Matt Lundmark. Emkey and
Schilla fought hard the whole
way, but Gustavus was too strong
in the end, winning 7-5,7-6.
In the 7th place playoff
Emkey and Schilla struggled in
the first set against John Hugo
and Matt Dougherty of
Middlebury, but then woke up
in the second set and went on to
win 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. According to
assistant coach Chris Pearson,
"Greg and Pete can get away
with less than perfect shots most
of the time, butany mistake here
will cost you. Against Gustavus
and Middlebury they showed
they have what it takes to win at
this level."

Why McGwire is still a hero

the Randy Johnson trade to
frame the 1998 season. Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa
gave that to me.
And they gave it to the rest
of America as well. Interest in
the "nation's pastime" rose as
the race to take the record became closer and closer. Attendance at McGwire games
soared as the hero became a legend, and cameras flashed more
frequently as he stepped up to
bat.
But hidden beneath this
home run race was a slightly
darker side of the game. Debated every now and then in the
press, mentioned every now and
again amongst the fans, the
"andro" issue was always lurking somewhere beneath the
headlines. As most of you probably know, McGwire performed
his great feats while taking the
drug androstenedione, more

commonly known as andro. Illegal in most sports because of
the way in which it increases
performance, this testosterone
increaser (the body converts the
drug into testosterone in the
liver) is completely legal in
baseball. But is it acceptable?
Opinions vary.
Arguments that McGwire
isn't the hero he seems attack
