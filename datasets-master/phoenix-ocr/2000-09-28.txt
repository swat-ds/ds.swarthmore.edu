Ville ice cream parlor melting away
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Hoagies will replace water ice after Saturday, when one
of the few Ville shops to provide an off-campus hangout for
Swatties changes ownership. Sugarplums, Swarthmore's
only ice cream and sweet shop, will be converted into a
New York-style deli-cafe.
Susan Surplus opened Sugarplums 14 months ago, and
she has since become a very familiar face to students who
frequent her shop.

She has put a lot ofmoney, heart and soul intoher business, often working fourteen to sixteen hours a day every
day of the week. Her intention was for the store to be a
place for families during the day and a hangout for Swatties

at night.
Surplus said she did much to make Sugarplums inviting
for Swarthmore students and kept the store open until 11 p.m.
most nights to satisfy late-night cravings for ice cream. She
encouraged students to hold birthday parties at Sugarplums;
if they brought cake, she would supply ice cream. One of Surplus' favorite memories was when Sixteen Feet, a campus a
cappella group, held a concert at Sugarplums last year.
Surplus said she felt the Ville needed a business where students would be welcome to go sit, talk and hang out. "I didn't
care if students stayed here for a long time or brought their
books and studied," she said. "There should be places like that

Bonner lectures on life as a Soviet dissident
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
Elena Bonner does not smile. It is hardly
surprising.
She speaks in a hoarse tired voice with
an astonishing authority, impatiently interrupting her translator. She speaks of the
Soviet dissident movement. She speaks of
people who risked their freedom and their
lives in a country marked by prolonged
bouts of tyranny to hold theirrulers to their
promises.

Dr. Bonner, after all, is one of
those individuals who chooses to speak despite the advantages of remaining silent, of
watching and waiting for others to act. She
is one of the most prominent human rights
activists of the twentieth century.
A wife of the Soviet dissident and Noble
Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, the
frail 77-year-old woman who spoke last
Thursday in the Lang Performing Arts Center suffered through many hardships. Although both of her parents were dedicated
members of the Communist Party in the
Soviet Union, they were arrested during the
Stalinist era, when she was only 14. Bonner's
father was executed two years after the arrest. Her mother spent 17 years in prison.
Bonner's dedication to her cause and her
husband is a good deed that has not gone
unpunished. She was banished to Gorky
with Sakharov in 1984. Both of them were

denied all means of contact with the world
outside the city, their apartment lacking
commodities as basic as a telephone. Despite
Bonner's worsening heart condition, the
government was reluctant to allow her to
leave Gorky for a vital surgery performed
only in Western countries.
She was released only after Sakharov
undertook three hunger strikes that together
lasted nearly 200 days. Perhaps even more
heroic, however, was Bonner's return to
Gorky to rejoin her husband in a seemingly
indefinite confinement.
Which is exactly why it is all the more
surprising that Elena Bonner does not like
to speak about the dissident movement.
"I ask that you address all of your questions to Russia's present rather than her
past," went the loose translation of Dr.
Bonner's opening remarks.
Indeed, the most interesting part of the
lecture to most was the question-and-answer
session in the end.
"I felt like the answers gave me more insight into her own perspective. I wish she
had spoken more from her own as opposed
to the historical point of view," said Amanda
Cravens 'O4, one of the students who attended the lecture.
When Bonner spoke last Thursday, many

of laughter preceding the interpreter's

did not need any translation. But
Bonner spoke in an even, passionless voice,
which acquired intonation only after she
started to talk about Russia's present.
The lecture, which was sponsored by the
Russian Club, left many disappointed.
Some students were disenchanted by the
content of the lecture: "I wish she [would

have] talked more about modern Russia,"

said David Berger 'O4.
Some, like Cravens, felt they left without fully comprehending all of the issues: "I

New student space approved
BY NICOLE BRUNOA

BY NICOLE BRUNDA

Following complaints about the lack of
student space on campus and a subsequent
offerof funding by the administration, Student Council this week began seeking
plans for the renovation of the old
gameroom, located in the basement of

Student Council is planning to host
an all-campus study break on Monday
night. The event, which will take place
at 10 p.m. in Parrish Parlours, will offer
students both free pizza and a chance
to voice concerns before the council.
"One of Student Council's biggest
goals this semester is to create a sense
of community to bring students together," said JordanBrackett 'Ol, council co-chair. "Hopefully we will be a Student Council not ofParrish Parlours but
of the community."
The meeting will begin with a brief
mingling period intended for students
to meet the current members of the
council, including the newly elected
secretary and College Budget Commit-

Tarble.
The proposal and referendum campaign
come in the wake of campus enthusiasm
for last year's renovation of Sharpies 111
into a student art space. This year's process will follow the pattern established by
last year's campus-wide referendum on the
renovation of Sharpies 111.
College Planning Committee representative Brandon Silverman 'O2 said student
space is one of the most important issues
currently facing Student Council.
Last year's campaign, he said, was "the

most definitive, platonic example of the administration and Student Council working
together to address a student issue which
in my mind is one of the biggest, the lack
of student space."
According to Silverman, the strongest
competitor for the space could be the Swarthmore College Computing Society, which
lost last year's referendum of Sharpies 111
to the combined proposal of the Photo Club

and Student Art Association.
Proposals for the gameroom renovation
may be submitted by any student or student group on campus and must include a
detailed plan for the use and management
of the space as well as an estimated cost.
All proposals are due by midnight on
Oct. 8. They will thenbe passed to Student
Council and the administrationfor a discussion of their feasibility.
The proposals that are considered plausible will be put to a campus-wide vote on
Nov. 1-3 which will narrow the accepted
proposals down to two finalists.
On November 15-17 there will be a second campus-wide vote to decide between
the two final proposals.

Renovations to the gameroom in the basement of Tarble to be used as student space.
The authors of the winning proposal will
have the opportunity to sit down with architects, interior designers, and engineers to design the specifics of the new space.
Construction will most likely commence
in early spring and could be completed sometime in March or April.
The pool tables and video game machines
of the old gameroom have been moved to the
student lounge on the main floorofTarble and
are now officially open for use.
In other business Monday night, Delonte
Gholston 'O2, observer to the Board of Managers, discussed recent proposals to change the

hours of Paces cafe.
According to Gholston, "Both John Paul
Christy 'Ol and Lisa Adler 'Ol [Paces co-directors for 2000-2001] are in general agreement that
the hours should be made more agreeable to
the lifestyle of students."
A current suggestion is to change Paces
hours to be from 9 or 10 p.m. until 1 a.m. The
three constraints to the proposal are funding,

staffing, and security.
The proposal for amended Paces hours will
be taken to the deans by the managers ofPaces
sometime in the next few weeks, but changes
are not likely to occur until next semester.

meetings.
The study break is the latest in a series of attempts by Student Council to
make itself more accessible to the student body. Not all have been successful, such as last year's open mic night.
"Right now we're hoping to create an
atmosphere where students really want
to come share their input with Student
Council," Brackett said.

Conservative group invites anti-Mumia speaker to campus
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Swarthmore Conservative Foundation has invited Dan

Flynn to speak next Wednesday

on Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former
journalist from Philadelphia
who has been on death row since
he was convicted of murdering
policeman Daniel Faulkner in
1982. No protests are planned for
the event, which even proMumia activists plan to approach with a spirit of dialogue.
“Anything that is going to
bring attention to the case of
Mumia Abu-Jamal is helpful,”

said Sarah Drescher ’O3, a member of Just Cause, a pro-Mumia
group with about 20 members.
“We certainly wantto encourage
dialogue. We hope he will present
the facts thoroughly.”
Though Flynn intends to
speak to both sides of the issue,
his book, “Cop Killer; How
Mumia Abu-Jamal Conned Millions into Believing He Was
Framed,” and the platform of the
Swarthmore Conservative Foundation make his stance on the
issue clear.
“We firmly believe that A,

SEPTEMBER 28, 2000

[Mumia] got a fair trial and B, he's
guilty," Dave Thomas 'O2, co-founder
of the foundation, said.
Flynn is executive director of
Accuracy in Academia, a group that
sends speakers to college campuses
around the US. He has also written

articles about higher education for
the Boston Globe and Washington
Times and appeared as a frequent
guest on talk radio shows.
A frenzy of controversy has surrounded the Mumia case since 1995,
when National Public Radio began
to air testimonies about prison life
from Abu-Jamal, who spoke from a
maximum security, 23-hour
lockdown cell in Philadelphia. The
publication of his book, "Live from
Death Row," reached an even
greater audience and further publicized his assertion that he was the
victim of a tainted trial.
Citing witness coercion, racism
and police brutality as crucial components of the jury's decision to sentence him to death, Abu-Jamal
alerted organizations such as the
AmericanCivil Liberties Union, the
NAACP and Amnesty International
to his cause. It soon caught on with
student organizations and private
groups around the world.
THE PHOENIX

Both abroad and in the US, AbuJamal has effectively become a
poster boy for the movement to abolish the death penalty and to amend
the criminal justice system. A crowd
of 6,000 gathered at Madison Square
Garden in New York City this May
to protest on his behalf, and public
figures such as Nobel Peace Prizewinning Bishop Desmond Tutu and
novelist Alice Walker have taken up
his fight.
"We believe [Mumia's case] encapsulates a lot of the problems we
see in the criminal justice systems,"
said Drescher.
Flynn is part of an opposing
movement that favors the execution
of Abu-Jamal and claims that his
trial was fair. Members of the opposition movement champion justice
for the friends and family of
Faulkner, the victim in the case,
claiming that Abu-Jamal's crime
was premeditated and that his death
sentence was backed by a legitimate
confession of murder.
On Wednesday, Flynn plans to
present the case as both sides interpret it and to discuss witness recantation and the conspiracy theory to

which Mumia's supporters adhere.
His talk will be followed by a ques-

tion-and-answer session.
The Swarthmore Conservative
Foundation came into existence in
late 1999. Founded by Tony Hillery
'Ol and Thomas, the nonprofit organization is one of many conservative college groups around the country that is partially funded by The
Leadership Institute, a Washington
DC-based organization. Swarthmore
Conservative Foundation does not
receive funding from the college but
is partially subsidized by Young
America, a division of The Leadership Institute, whose sole purpose
is to sponsor conservative speakers
at colleges.

The foundation brought Ward
Connerly to campus as its main
event last spring. Connerly was a
leading proponent of Proposition
209, a California bill that sought to
ban racial quotas in its state-funded
universities.

Although Connerly was also a
controversial figure and many

Swarthmore students heartily disputed his views on affirmative action, the event filled the LPAC Cinema and, according to Thomas,
stimulated healthy dialogue on the
topic. Thomas hopes that Flynn's
Mumia presentation will do the

will sit down and hear him out,"

because it falls within the confines of the borough," he said.
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave agreed.
"Swarthmore police [have] full jurisdiction [over the college] and officers can stop and question someone as long
as they have probable cause," he said.
According to Redgrave, the borough police often work
closely with Public Safety. In certain instances, he said,
Public Safety takes the lead in handling cases dealing more

who spent the summer creating personalities for him and two robotic

increased presence of ville police on campus recently at

"The presence of cops on campus is, at first glance, too
much," council Co-Chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol said.
Police presence on campus has been especially conspicu-

On Thursday Mario successfully

Specifically, the act would allow the legislature to vote

Commencement date
changed to Sunday
Taking final action on a recommendation that
was made over a year ago, Swarthmore's Board of
Managers approved changing commencement
from Monday to Sunday.
This decision was recommended by the
Curriculum Committee and approved by the
faculty prior to going before the board at its
quarterly meeting last weekend.
The change is intended to make it easier for
working family members to attend
commencement. "The sentiment was expressed
over recent years that Monday imposed some sort
of hardship on families," Vice President for
College and Community Relations Maurice

Eldridge said.
Under the new arrangement, events that
generally take place the day before
commencement, such as baccalaureate and Phi
Beta Kappa ceremonies, will be moved to
Saturday.
The board will not decide when to implement
the change until its meeting in December,
according to Eldridge. It could go into effect
beginning with the class of 2002 at the earliest,
and possibly beginning with the class of 2003.
The graduation date for this year's senior class
remains Monday, June 4.
In other business, the board addressed the
ongoing capital campaign and the architectural
plans for the new science center.
According to student observer Delonte
Gholston 'O2, President Al Bloom's report on the
state of the college highlighted the hiring of new
professors and particularly minority faculty, as well
as the expanded curricular options such as a
greater variety of concentrations and the
introduction of minors which will be available to
students in the future.
Bloom also emphasized the importance of
campaigning to the health of the institution, noted
an increase in foundational support for
undergraduate minority fellow and faculty
research and teaching, and praised the work of
Robin Mamlet, Swarthmore's outgoing dean of
admissions.
Gholston said that Vice President of Facilities
and Services Larry Schall set the board's
upcoming agenda, which will focus on the issues
of a new residence hall, student space, athletics,
and the college's relationship to the borough,
particularly as it relates to the possibility of
building a hotel.
SONIA SCHERR

New dorm planned
The Architectural Firm Selection Committee
began meeting with representatives of seven
architectural firms this week to decide which one
will be selected to plan the construction of a new
dorm.
"By Monday, we expect to have narrowed them
down to a smaller group, and make the selection
from there," committee member Stuart Hain said.
The committee, which is comprised of five
students and eight faculty members, is in the very
preliminary stages of the process and has only laid
out the initial details of the new building, according
to committee member Pablo Montagnes 'O2.
Montagnes said construction is expected to be
completed by 2004, but the dorm will not be used
to house students until 2007. During the three-year
gap, it will be used as interim housing for groups
displaced by the upcoming Parrish renovation.
The sites being considered for placement of the
new building are near Old Tarble, PPR, Sharpies
and Wharton. The building is expected to house
100-150 students, including freshmen, and may be
built with the flexibility to allow for other activities.

Some students experience
problems with financial aid
$8,550.

BY JON EHRENFELD
Ben Merkel would have been a junior this year. Instead, he is
now living 45 minutes away from campus, working to raise money

for school. During last year's winter break, after realizing that
he would be unable to afford the coming year's tuition, Merkel
decided to take at least one semester off. Next semester, if he still
cannot meet the cost of the college, he will attend a less expensive school.
According to Merkel, his financial troubles are rooted in the
cutting of his financial aid package between his freshman and
sophomore years. As a freshman, Merkel said he was given a
student aid scholarship of $19,640, primarily because he had two
brothers in college one at Swarthmore and one elsewhere. In
his sophomore year, Merkel's brothers had both graduated, at
which point the scholarship portion of his aid package was cut
significantly. The scholarship offer Merkel received for that year
was less than $3,000.
While in theory Merkel's parents should have been able to
send him to Swarthmore with the money that had been used to
send his brothers to school, he said that in practice they could
not afford it.
Swarthmore is generally recognized by people within and
outside the college as having an excellent financial aid program.
Some students, however, have raised concerns over the way in
which financial aid is awarded. This concern stems both from
looking at the financial aid program and from students whose
financial aid situation reflects the process used to grant aid.
A complaint that some have regards the college's policy on
loans. The loan component of the aid package begins at $2,560 in
freshman year and rises to $5,390 by senior year. While every aid
package includes a loan component, the financial aid office does
not consider outstanding student loans when gauging a family's
ability to pay. "The financial aid office told us that outstanding
loans didn't factor in," Ben said. Since repayment of the
Swarthmore loan (federal Stafford loans and a Perkins loan are
also available) need not begin until nine months after a student
has left the college, many families still have outstanding loans
during the time their child is in school.
This is the main criticism that Merkel and others have with
the financial aid policy. The school's formula for awarding aid
came into conflict with the reality of Merkel's situation. He felt
that despite his attempts to bring his personal circumstances to
light, it was the formula which determined his aid package.
Every student who applies for financial aid is considered in
the same manner. The financial aid office decides the family's

board, fees, books, and living expenses. The average aid offer is

The office determines a family's ability to pay college
expenses by looking at several aspects of a family's financial situation, and deciding how much each family can con-

tribute. Several of the most important factors that the financial aid office looks at are a family's total assets, including liquid ones, both parents' incomes, whether the
student has siblings in college (but not graduate school),
medical issues, and other family members dependent on
the student's parents. Most students on financial aid have
no major problems with theiraid packages. But some feel
that no single policy can work well for all students' situations.
Despite questions as to whether the formula used to
generate aid packages is sound, Director of Financial Aid
Laura Talbot says that the school's financial aid policy is
generally recognized to be excellent. Swarthmore is currently ranked at the top of U.S. News and World Report's
"best values" financial aid rankings. Regardless ofhow the
loan is dealt with by the financial aid office, the college
has among the lowest loan component of any school in its
bracket, said Talbot.
In addition, it has been discussed often in the past how
to lower the loan even further, the product of which is the
school's comparatively low loan component. In the future,
the financial aid office and the deans hope that the loan
might be lowered even further.
Eleanor Salgado 'O3 also found her financialaid changed
due to formulas. This year, her financial aid package was
substantially increased, due to a sibling entering college.
"I wasn't expecting to get any extra help," she said, and is
farfrom complaining about the financial aid process.
The financial aid office is pleased with how the college
stands in terms of the aid packages it gives, said Talbot.
For the work-study component, in which the student is
expected to help shoulder part of the financial responsibility, the college currently asks students to work seven- to
eight-hour weeks, for the most part a lower number than
comparable schools. As far as a high scholarship, low loans,
and a financial aid office willing to consider such factors
as a parent unwilling to pay for college, and siblings in
graduate school, Swarthmore has long been far ahead other
schools, Talbot said.
The college's desire to make the aid program more attractive stems from more than the desire to bring to
Swarthmore anyone who is qualified, regardless ofhis or
herfinancial situation, Dean Bob Gross said. With colleges
such as Amherst, Williams, Harvard, and Princeton all
searching from the same academic group, financial aid is
one way to attract would-be students. "Oneof the real challenges has been in recent years a competitive marketplace
for financial aid," Dean Gross noted.

Swatties struggle with overcommitment
Students are dedicated first to their classes, so the time left over is usually only enough for one or two clubs. But students often want to do more.
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
One of the issues Student Council intends to explore in its investigation of wellness at Swarthmore
this year is students' involvement
with large numbers ofactivities and
overcommitting their time.
Many students describe themselves as not always able to follow
through on the commitments they
make to activities outside of class.
Students' reasons vary with the
situation and the activity, but there

"people

everything:'

is a general sense that it is easy for
Swatties to become overwhelmed
and stressed out by activities beyond their coursework.
When students who are already
stretched thin experience a crunch
for time, student groups they have
previously committed to can be left
in the lurch.
According to Student CouncilCoChair JordanBrackett 'Ol, the problem is not a lack of commitment on
thepart of students. Instead, he said,
the problem is overcommitment.
There are 94 recognized groups
that students can become involved
with on campus in addition to sports
and jobs.
"Sometimes I am surprised that
our campus can support so many
groups," said Student Budget Committee treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2.
He explained that in any given
class of students, only so many will
be interested in leadership positions, and most organizations need
about four active leaders in order to
sustain themselves. Student leaders,
in particular, are stretched thin.
According to Barron, every year
about 25 student groups are effectively inactive because they do not
spend the money given them by the
Budget Committee.
He estimated that the average
student is involved in three or four
student groups and actively involved in one or two.
Brackett theorized that high initial enthusiasm on the part of
Swarthmore students is later subject to a reality check where students realize they can't be involved
in so many activities.
"Generally speaking, the attrition rate of student organizations is
relatively high," he said. "It might
be higher than at other campuses
because people here are so eager to
get involved in so many things. It's
difficult if not impossible to maintain that level of involvement in a
large number of organizations,"
Brackett said.
Students join a number of activities to begin with, but only end up
loving some. The others get dropped.
"You only have four years here;
you want to try as much as you can,"
he said. "People here want to be active. The people who come here are
people who try to do everything."
That isn't always possible, Brackett

said, because students are also very
academically committed and are
faced with a large workload.
When students become involved
with activities and organizations at
the beginning of a year, Barron said,
they do not realize what they are getting themselves into, and how much
work it takes to keep an organization going.
Barron, however, said he does
not think that academic pressure is

the reason that students fail to follow through on their commitments,
explaining that some of the most
active students he knows are ones
who are taking tough course loads
of five classes.
Student Council itself is one of
the many time-consuming activities
that students can commit to outside
of classes. In previous years, resignations from the council have occurred with a notable frequency.
Last year, two members of student council resigned
one last
September, and the other last February. An extra election was held
last fallbecause of the first resignation. This semester, however,

Brackett does not anticipate any
resignations, both because of the
high level of commitment on the
part of current Student Council
members and because of the way
they work well together as a group.
Brackett said the resignations of
a few years ago were due to a former
"state of disharmony" on the coun-

SWATHES IN THE COMMUNITY

Campus groups encourage local high schoolers to vote
The College Democrats are spearheading an effort to register voting-age students from area high schools as part of the YO! Project
BY IVAN BOOTHE
When people think of the young adult voting crowd, one
thing usually comes to mind: apathy. The College Democrats, however, are looking to change that notion.
Over the course of the next two weeks, the Democrats
will travel to two local high schools, encouraging votingage seniors to register to vote through the Youth Outreach,
or YO! Project.
YO! is supported by the national "Rock the Vote" cam-

"ULTIMATELY, THIS IS ABOUT
EMPOWERING FOLKS, ENCOURAGING
THEM TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE
ISSUES."
paign, and the Democrats are working with local radio stations Power 99 and YIOO FM, as well as with a number of
other groups, including the College Republicans, three fraternities, and the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship. Individual college students are also welcome to participate.
Volunteers plan to travel to Ridley and Strath Haven
high schools on September 29 and October 4, respectively.
They will set up registration booths during lunchtime
in different areas at the schools, and will encourage 18-yearold seniors to register to vote.
They will also distribute free posters, CDs, and voter
information guides, provided by Rock the Vote and WSRN.
The giveaways, however, are not bribes. "It's not at all
that we're rewarding them for registering," College Demo-

crats president Delonte Gholston said, explaining that the
items would be distributed free regardless of whether a student registers.
The volunteers' goal is to register at least 300 students over
the course of the next few weeks.
Once young adults are registered, the next step is to encourage them to show up on election day. "It is one thing to
get folks registered," Gholston explained, "[and] another entirely to ensure that they will show up at the polls."
Gholston said that he had considered a number of options
when addressing this problem.
"One idea that I have that I haven't pursued just yet is
providing transportation to the polls," he said, reasoning that
more students would show up if they didn't have to worry
about how to get to the voting booth.
The idea is akin to a future project ofthe Democrats, bringing college a capella groups to the local retirement community, and advertising free rides to the polls at the same time.
"Ultimately, this is about empowering folks, encouraging
them to be informed about the issues," Gholston said.
Although the registration will be non-partisan, Gholston
did not say that he would keep his political affiliation entirely
under wraps. "If someone were to ask me personally... I would,
of course, encourage them to vote Democratic."
Adding to his political party is not Gholston's primary
aim, however. Due to the variety of organizations involved,
he is optimistic about the unity that this project will help

Other organizations that were invited to participate
in the project included nearly every group housed in the
Intercultural Center, as well as numerous community service groups, such as the Chester Tutorial Program, CIVIC,
Empty the Shelters, and the Upward Bound Program.
Rounding out the list were the Swarthmore Protestant
Community and the Swarthmore Progressive Action Coalition.
Originally, an additional visit was planned to nearby
parochial school Cardinal O'Hara, but the high school
changed its mind about the project. "Since they're a private institution," Gholston explained, "They have different laws and rules that apply."
Although college groups were invited as a whole to participate, any student wishing to volunteer is welcome to
become a part of the project.
"We are especially interested in finding certified van

drivers," Gholston said.
The visit to Ridley High School is scheduled for tomorrow, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Strath Haven High School will
also host the project, from 10:30 a.m. to 1:00p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 4.

For more information, students may contact
Delonte Ghotstonatdgholstl@swarthmore.edu or

there is enough room on the vans, students
should express interest as early as possible.

foster.

"Too often, politics is seen as divisive, instead of something
that can bring together people of different backgrounds,"
Gholston said, noting that in asking particular campus groups
to help, he was trying to build a sense of community.

Hotel reservations
The way things seem to be going, the hotel on the
college's athletic fields is practically already open for
business. Sure, in orderfor the deal to happen, the
alcohol laws ofboth the Borough of Swarthmore and the
state of Pennsylvania have to change, the college needs
some land rezoned and a developer has to formally
commit to the project. But with the momentum the idea
already has, those are nothing but mere technicalities.
There might be benefits to a hotel within the borough
on land owned by the college. Presently, there is no
convenient place for guests of students, faculty and staff
to stay near campus, and for a few weekends of the year
like Commencement, the problem is severe. Having a
hotel nearby could alleviate some of that problem.

The other benefits of the hotel, however, are often
overstated. It is incorrect to assume that adding a hotel to
the downtown of theville will improve relations between
the college and the town. And while a hotel might be a
lucrative source of tax revenue for the borough, any belief
that adding an 80-room hotel would immediately and
single-handedly solve the town's economic woes is wrong.
Even more unclear are what benefits, other than the
nearby hotel space, the college wouldreceive from leasing
several acres of its land to a developer. Assuming the
hotel is profitable enough, the terms of the lease might be
favorable to the college. But even in today's economy, it is
hard to believe that a small share of the profits of an 80room hotel would be a significant windfall.
For those reasons, it is disturbing to note how far
along the project has come the developer prepared a
sketch months ago, and traffic engineers will soon be
brought in
without any public debate on the issue.
Only through reasoned discussion with all the stakeholders
not the least of whom should be Swarthmore
students, the hotel's nearest neighbors can potential
problems be identified early and doubts be cleared up.
Because no real discussion has taken place, we
haven't heard enough evidence to earn our support
for the hotel plan, especially when the college has
more pressing building needs, like more dorm rooms
and additional student space. Until there is substantial public debate over whether the college actually
needs a hotel, the college should not move forward
with something so peripheral to its core mission.

A winning streak?
Since 1996, Swarthmore football has been something
of an oxymoron. As recently as last week, The Phoenix
compared the team to the Washington Generals, the

famously inept opponents of the Harlem Globetrotters.
This week, we saw thefirst stirrings of success from a
program that has beenboth showered with and plagued
by attention. Al5-10 win over Gettysburg College broke a
31-game Centennial Conference losing streak and
temporarily silenced critics who insisted the GarnetTide
just wasn't up to snuffwith its conference competitors.
Now the question on everyone's mind is whether the
Tide can win again. It seems eminently possible that the
team could emerge from the season with victories
against Franklin & Marshalland Dickinson, and with a
few lucky bounces, it's even within the realm of
imagination to envision a .500 or better season.
But larger questions loom on the horizon for the
football team, and beyond the short term, the ramifications of this win aren't clear. How will success affect the
college's evaluation of the football program? Even a
conference championship won't quell the rumors that
football and other sports may soon face the executioner's
ax, but winning certainly helps the case of athletics.
In the court of public opinion, however, it's hard to
imagine a few wins, or even a winning season, reversing
the firmly entrenched apathy of students toward the
football team. While people may be pleased that the team
is winning, chances are only a few will be at the games
or believing that the Tide will keep up its winning ways.
Regardless of what goes on behind closed doors on

the second floor of Parrish and behind backs in

Sharpies, the football team deserves everyone's praise
for doing what seemed inconceivable only three years
ago. And as your biggest public critics, we offer our

sincere congratulations.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

SCCS disk crash overdramatized
Dear Editor:
We'd like to add a few notes to the article about the SCCS
disk failure in last week's Phoenix ("New drive fails; SCCS
loses data," pg. 3). While we've certainly suffered a spate of
bad luck in the past few weeks, things aren't nearly as bad
as the article implies.
First, contrary to the headline, very few Webpages were lost.
We have been able to recover 90 percent of the missing images
and text from archives. We have restored almostall ofthe text of
theremaining 10percent from caching Internet search engines.
The images that accompany these last few pages are gone, and
this we regret greatly, but often (more often thanwith text) these
images have been saved on users' personal hard drives.
Users can create web page text on our servers and never
have a local copy, but they must save these images on another computer before they upload it to the SCCS. This is
why it is so important (and why we are so relieved) to have
recovered the text data.
As far as the missing image data is concerned, we have
the option of performing a very expensive ($4,300 if successful) data recovery procedure on our ailing drive. We have

discussed emergency funding for this service with the college administration, and we are fortunate enough to have
the option to go ahead with it if our users deem it necessary. This is a very difficult choice to make, and we should
have a decision made on Friday.
We should mention that not only does our new backup
scheme save all content from both of our servers every other
day, but that our new Web server (coming in the next month)
will be protected by a fault-tolerant RAID disk array which
is able to sustain a complete disk failure without data loss.
Finally, we should point out thatthe real reason we continue to use the outdated version of our Web page so long
after the crash is because we are hard at work on our new
there will be a big change in the next
page. Stay tuned
three weeks, on our Web page and elsewhere.
If anyone has any questions about the recent crash or
our new plans, we encourage them to drop us a note at

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Debates and differences in
economics inherently political
Dear Editor:
I was gratified to see the question
of the divides between majors in economics brought up in terms of a serious, well-researched debate about
their goals and interests ("A Tale of
Two Majors," Sept. 21). However, I
felt that the reasons behind such a
split
between "theoreticians" and
"businesspeople"
were not given
an adequate airing.
What most people forget when
they equate economics with business
(and indeed political science with
pre-law) is that the social sciences in
general, and policy-oriented social
studies like economics in particular,
are political. That's right, political.
When you walk into an economics classroom, you do see a lot of
graphs and equations on the board.
You will perhaps start thinking that
there's nothing to argue: there's just

one 'economics' point of view, and
that different ways of studying it
leads you to math-based theory or
real-world business, depending on
your background or preferences. It
looks like it's mostly conservative, so
you'd better start attacking the discipline.

This is probably the impression

of the average Swattie taking Econ
L It's deceptive, though: even core
courses like microeconomics and
macroeconomics open the doors to
differing camps in the battleground

of ideas.
In Intermediate Microeconomics
(Econ 11), the most business-oriented
of the core requirements, arguments
about the ability of free markets to
solve problems of distribution are
raised. There is room enough in economic theory for redistribution of
wealth, socialization of industry and
massive government intervention,
as well as the more familiar laissezfaire libertarianism.
Economics is primarily a study of
how we distribute
or allocate our
material lives among our wants. I
freely concede that this does not include questions ofcharacter or virtue,
yet there is still more than enough to
be discussed about the nature of ourselves, our priorities and our society
in the discipline. Economics has produced people as far to the right as
Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas,
as far to the left as John Maynard
Keynes and Amartya Sen.

Professor admits
e-mail inappropriate

As an economics minor, I welcome
the debate, though admittedly it
doesn't occur often. The set of assumptions made by one person can and
should be questioned by another with
a different moral or philosophical
point of view. Such is the joy and the

Dear Editor:
I am writing to apologize to the community for sending out my recent all-college e-mail including the attachment with the list of words for female sex organs. I sent
it out in the hope, even expectation (how vain it seems to
me now), that the following issues might have been discussed in The Phoenix and/or elsewhere:
L Is this not degrading to women, indeed to everyone? Here is a question I used to hear incessantly, but
now, nothing; except for a few hints that equality might
have been served if men had been equally degraded in

an undeniable truth.
2. While I have no doubt that nothing is given credit
in this college which does not deserve it, there is a certain obscurity here that I personally would have liked to
have had cleared up. Just exactly what is the value to the
student of compiling or studying such a list, the value
which explains the credit being given?
3. It is my understanding that the course carries physical education credit. This raises the question of whether
there is some physical activity that is part of this course
that is not part of other courses at the college. If so, what
exactly is it? If not, should we not give physical education credit to other courses which discuss similar material, such as certain courses in biology, psychology, linguistics, literature or film?
Though I would still welcome it, it now seems clear that
I was foolish to expect discussion of any such issues, and
that all I actually did was to further pollute, in a small way,
the moral atmosphere of the community. My apologies.

value of studying the social sciences

in a liberal arts framework. As econ
majors branch out and take courses
they like, the wealth of the debate continues, as a conversation between a

person taking Economic Development
and a person taking Banking and Fi-

nancial Markets would demonstrate.
The main point is that economics
is not a monolithic discipline, no matter how solid it looks from the outside.
Is it any wonder, then, that two individuals within the same department
could be as different as is possible at
Swarthmore?
We are not just separated by background, career goal, or parental expectations; we are separated implicitly by
our philosophies, the way we look at
the world. We impoverish ourselves
by trying to dissolve these distinctions into career patterns and afterschool incomes.

CDC condom report not conclusive

Steinem criticism nothing but infighting

Dear Editor:
I was rather disturbedby the Sexual Health
Counselor's column in last week's Phoenix
("N-9 condoms not so safe," Sept. 21). In particular, the statements madeabout nonoxynol-9 (N-9) are unclear and, in some cases, false.
The "report" by the CDC was actually a
study released on July 12 by the 13th International AIDS Conference. The gist of the study
was this: starting in 1996, 990 prostitutes in
South Africa, Benin, Thailand and Cote
d'lvoire were given either Advantage-S (a
common spermicide) or a similar-looking placebo gel. In addition, the prostitutes were
given a continuous supply and "urged" to use
them.
When the study ended this May, the following results were released: 15 percent of those
using the spermicide had become infected
with HIV, while only 10 percent of those using the placebo gel became infected. To put
this into raw numbers, about 75 prostitutes
using the spermicides became infected, and
about 50 of those using the placebo became
infected.
To the best of my knowledge, there were
no controls for actual use of condoms, frequency of sexual intercourse, infection rates
in each of the countries or numerous other
variables that could have a significant effect
on the results of the study.
People around the world are now being

Dear Editor:
Like Christine Leahey, I attended
Gloria Steinem's talk, and I would like
to respond to Leahey's letter regarding
that presentation.
First, I would like to address her uneasiness with Steinem's power. I used to
be an anarchist, too, back in ninth grade.
Then I realized that groups of humans
must have leaders if they want to accomplish anything. Yes, questioning the who,
how and why of leadership is great, but
ultimately, someone must lead. Perhaps

discouraged from using spermicides because
25 more prostitutes (from non-Western countries) that used spermicide became infected
with HIV than those who didn't use a spermicide. The very statement that N-9 increases
risk of HIV infection in this specific population is tenuous at best.
But even by assuming that this is true,
this study is meaningless for the vast majority of the world. There is no comparison to
be made between the sexual habits of prostitutes in Africa and Southeast Asia (who,
during the study, applied N-9 up to twenty
times a day) and the students at Swarthmore
College.
N-9 has been proven effective in killing
HIV both in the test tube and when used in
moderation (up to four times a day). The average college student should not risk infection merely because some prostitutes on the
other side of the world with vastly different

People like power. I like power. Gloria
Steinem likes power, much as she may have
downplayed it. And Leahey likes power. If
she doesn't, why did she step to the microphone or write a letter? At the very least,
someone has to have power in any movement, including the feminist movements.
Steinem was willing to sacrifice her
personal life to become the public face of

feminism. If she didn't, someone else

Furthermore, I'd like to question
why magazines without advertising are
morally superior. Yes, our capitalist system discriminates in many ways, including advertising, but, like leadership,
capitalism is not going to disappear
overnight. I am fairly confident that the
people at MS are aware of the problems
with advertising and choose advertisers
with these problems in mind.
Leahey seems to think the best way
to think outside of the box is to destroy
the box completely. Humans need boxes.
We need some sort of grounding for so-

cial behavior

Questioning what that grounding is,
on what that grounding is based, and
who decides which grounding we use is
commendable, but we cannot drop the
grounding completely. You want hierarchy and privilege? Consider the source
of these fancy post-structuralist ideas
and those they influence.
The infighting of Leahey's letter is
what destroys movements. If we're busy
imploding ourselves, the opposition
doesn't even have to bother exploding us.

A PRO AND
A CON

Signs of our times
I am being blasted with information. From a reserved-students e-mailfilled withphysiological slang
to a pet dog's endorsement of a CJC candidate, I am
absorbing the most ridiculous pieces of information
among the most earnest of intentions. The only relief comes from the sensory overload (been near the
Admissions office recently?) that now causes me to
subconsciously block out virtually all parts of information.
Student Council candidate posters are always a
joy to be hit with on the way to class. I am still unclear as to how a picture of Cher saying "Oh, I believe" followed by a "Vote for X" is going to convince
me of, well, anything beyond Cher's continuing cultlike popularity in certain circles.
I must admit, however, that I do appreciate the
nostalgic trip back to elementary school elections
with the ever-creative "Vote for ME!" poster thatlists
some trite platitudes about a person's drive to work
hard and help the community.
To all who plan to run for Student Council (SC)
if you wrote in smaller letters at the bottom of your
poster a list of objectives or issues that you would
like to deal with in order to improve the quality of
life, you might be able to beat my favorite candidate,
Abstain.
And since you can't afford to pay professor Keith
Reeves to conduct a poll to let you know what the
student body wants, I'll offer a few suggestions.
First, I will vote for anyone who promises they
will not resign under any circumstances. From my
memory, about 95 percent of all elected students resign from the council before theirterm is completed.
Usually, the reason cited in ThePhoenix is something
totally lame like "lack of enthusiasm" (note to freshmen: this is Swat-speak for "laziness" or "the other
SC members found me intolerable and axed me"). My
reasoning goes as follows: if you don't resign, I don't
have to vote again and deal with another round of
obnoxious posters.
Second, I will vote for anyone who advocates the
creation of a regulatory body to stop superfluous reserved-students e-mails. Now, I've never met Rose
Maio or Sharon Friedler, but I'm sure they're very
nice people who truly believe that sending seven reserved-students e-mails to announce a time change
for a random upper-level course really does impact
the whole student body.
They are, however, wrong. And I mean that in a
very "even a post-modernist would agree that this is
Truth-with-a-capital-T" way. They and their kind
must be stopped.
I'm not quite sure why people who send out floods
of reserved-students e-mails can't use other forums
to inform potential students (like posting a sign at
the registrar's office or using a list of majors' e-mail
addresses). But since they aren't being logical, I implore the new SC candidates to try to give them some
other alternatives.
Speaking of logic, can anyone tell me why a professor would send out a reserved-students e-mail with
a large list of slang terms for a certain body part? Me
neither.
But I'm still stuck on two things. First, wouldn't
it take a really long time to manually type in all of
those slang terms on a computer and then send them
out? Second, did no one find this subject worthy of a
joke or two in last week's Phoenix?
Amidst all this depressing lowering of the bar, I
found one highlight that rejuvenates my hopes. A
certain political group made a tacky, hypocritical,
ineffective attack on a current presidential candidate.
The sign concluded with the patronizing advice that
I should be "disturbed."
But just as I rolled my eyes and decided to
switch my presidential vote to punish this student group, I noticed another identically-constructed sign parodying the attack by asking
whether I was "disturbed" by the tacky, hypocritical, ineffective sign. Now that's worth a reservedstudents e-mail.

Fond memories of Sugarplums
BY TED CHAN

Sometimes when an intimate rela-

tionship is spiraling towards an inevi-

table termination, you can sense it, you
can feel it in every ounce of your being
and begin to prepare yourself for the
moment where dread becomes reality. I
think those who were around Sugarplums and the politics and economics of
the Ville enough knew that the love af-

fair couldn't last forever.
Nevertheless, when Susan (the sweet
lady who runs the place) told me they'd
be closing at the end of the month, I felt
as if I'd been eviscerated.
We all came to Swarthmore for different reasons. I'm here because I want
to grow, expand and learn, not only academically but as a person. With respect
to the latter, Sugarplums was akin to a
good afternoon seminar with a rotating
professor schedule.
There was Frank, a local World War
II veteran who's been everywhere. He
taught me the secret to never getting old
(it involves drinking some brews and not
caring about your cholesterol all that
much). There were all the locals: the guy
who tries to sell you cosmetics, the
pretty single mother and the packs of
bright-eyed, candy-craving kids.
My heart goes out to Susan and her
husband, two of the nicest people you

could ever meet. Having watched my
own parents close three restaurants of
their own, I can't begin to describe the
heartbreak of seeing your dreams
dashed.
Long afterward, when issues offinancial solvency are resolved and all the
things you didn't want to deal with are
gone, what's left are the memories.
Maybe the next James Michener sat
there and ate three pounds of fudge just
like he must have in the Ingleneuk. In
any case, I know that long after Sugarplums has been replaced by a destinedto-be-soulless deli catering to early
morning commuters, the memory and
advice of the people I met at Sugarplums
will remain.
And there are good people out in the
Ville it's too bad that some are xenophobic townies who remember the college as the hippie joint it was 15 years
ago, when, according to Susan, "Everyone needed a bath." Now the college is
more yuppie than hippie. If the business board in the Ville realized that,
they might realize that the majority of
us are decentkids looking for things to
do, places to eat and things to decorate
our room with, not reefer and loose
women.
My parents did open one successful
restaurant in the Wellesley area, where
I grew up. Unless you've been there, it's

difficult to imagine how different
Wellesley is from Swarthmore.
Wellesley, like Swarthmore, is a wealthy
town that isn't going to have nightclubs
or bars any time soon.
But what they do have is a friendly
attitude towards students. Everyone
welcomes them with open arms. In
Wellesley, a place like the White Mtn.
Creamery (with infinitely less charm
and selection than Sugarplums at about

the same walking distance) thrives because if you have nothing to do at 9 p.m.,
you go out, shop some and have ice
cream.
Stores, coffee shops and restaurants

there are all geared towards students,
and the welcoming atmosphere brings
everyone into town. It's not like that
here, and it's something I genuinely feel
is missing from my college experience.
Sugarplums was a victim of that lack of

atmosphere.
And I'm sorry to see it go. I regret all
those times I had a craving for fudge or
water ice or a root beer float (and there
were a lot of times) but I was too lazy to
walk into the Ville just for it.
I'll miss Sugarplums, and even more,
I'll miss the people I met there. It's a
melancholy reminder that the best
things in life are as ephemeral as the earto-ear grin on the kid who got a quarter's
worth of candy with two dimes.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Releasing oil reserves risky
BY TSONG LIN

Hardly a day goes by now without
having oil in the news. The math is
the world consumes oil at a
simple
rate of 77 million barrels per day while
it is only pumping out 75 million.
Despite the decision of OPEC (the international oil cartel) to increase output by 800,000 barrels per day, oil prices
are still at a 10-year high of $37 a barrel. Last Friday, the Clinton administration gave in and decided to release
30 million barrels of reserves.
The release was meant to help build
up heating oil stock for America's
northeastern states, which are most
vulnerable to an early winter freeze.
However, such market intervention is
costly, providing the wrong incentives
and taking on additional risks.
Economics teaches its pupils that
government intervention is only ben-

eficial when there is a market failure.
Even so, the intervention should be
aimed at solving the failure, not ma-

nipulating prices. OPEC's constant
meddling in the oilmarket is clearly the
reason why oil prices rose from a low
of $lO a barrel in 1998 to over $3O this

summer.
However, unless the United States
has the power to break up OPEC, the
best alternative is to do nothing. Even
with 40 years of experience, OPEC has
failed to establish a stable oil price. It
is unlikely that the United States will
do abetter job.
After the Arab oil embargo in the

'7os, the United States established a
"Strategic Petroleum Reserve" of 751
million barrels. It was designed to act
as a buffer against future embargoes.
With OPEC losing its credibility to curb
the skyrocketing oil prices, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the last trump
card against hoarders or extraordinary
events.
Clinton's plan of releasing oil in
batches of six million barrels is hardly
enough for a country that consumes 18
million barrels a day. Yet this exposes
America to a greater danger
if the
reserves fail to cool prices and the U.S.
experiences a cold winter, prices will
be driven even higher as speculators
rush in to "squeeze" the market. If 30
million barrels is not enough, how
much more should the U.S. tap into its

reserves?
And once the U.S. stops supplying
the market, the trump card is lost.
Saddam Hussein, sensing a golden opportunity, has even hinted that Iraq
might counter "America's superpower
pressure" by cutting back its produc-

tion of three million barrels per day.
High oil prices, while painful in the
short run, provide significant long-term
benefits. Because of the previous oil

shock, America only uses about half as
much oil for every dollar of GDP as it
did in the 19705. OPEC will soon taste
its own poison as high oil prices will
invariably lead to a slump in demand.
Regulations have forced cars to have
a certain level of efficiency. As a result,

My African-American friend Audrey was going, so I thought
I would see what the group had to offer.
But I couldn't go.
SASS, like many other ethnic associations on campus,

This was the start of a column that I was going to write
attacking the racially closed support groups' meetings
on campus. But, after a wonderful conversation with Assistant Dean and Black Cultural Center (BCC) Director
Timothy Sams, I'm not going to write that column any-

more.

Mr. Sams explained to me why, in the case of the BCC,
such support group meetings were necessary in order to
provide "a safeand supportive space" ("Welcome to the Black
Cultural Center of Swarthmore College," pg. 3) for only black
students. His explanation made sense
certain members
of a racial community identify with each other on an intrinsic and cultural level and need, at least sometimes, an
environment ofmutual understanding.
So now that I understand why these groups exist, I'm
not going to attack such groups. No, now I'm going to write
asking them for a favor.
I'm asking for a favor because I'm worried. I'm worried
about two problems. First, I'm worried that the strictly racial definitionof entrance to certain groups might exclude
people who belong at the meetings yet cannot gain entrance
due to their skin color.
While skin color is, on some level, a bonding factor, the

Confused," cars now are cleaner and
burn less fossil fuel. (SUVs are the result of a loophole in the regulation, as
they are classified as "light trucks," not
cars.) In Europe, where people pay three
to four times the U.S. price for gasoline,
their cars are even more efficient.
High oil prices, in fact, are consistent with the Democratic environmental agenda. A second oil shock this winter will provide a strong incentive for
Americans to use alternative sources to
heat their homes and minimize their
vulnerability to oil prices. A bailout, on
the other hand, will give the wrong impression that the government will always be able to drive prices back down.
High oil prices are indeed painful, but
soothing the pain will only reduce the
incentive to change.
I had a lot of respect for the Clinton
administration when it resisted pressures to release oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, the
decision to purposely hold out until six
weeks before the presidential election
has raised a few eyebrows (especially
when Pennsylvania is a key battle-

ground state).

When France caved in to farmers
and truck drivers, riots quickly spread
across Europe. The United States government will face greater pressure if its
first meddling does not bring results.
The Clinton administration is gambling
that the prices will fall in the coming
months, but I have every reason to believe such risk-taking is unnecessary
and dangerous.

straight on questioning
Dear Editor:
I'm writing to voice my extreme displeasure with
the article that appeared in last week's Phoenix, "Student questioned by police." I was the student supposedly interrogated by the police.
Although the information contained in the article
is for the most part factually correct, the tone was very
misleading and incriminating. For instance, the natural inference one drawsfrom the title "Student questioned by police" is that the student was a suspect.
Furthermore, the article makes it sound as if the cops
came to campus specifically to nab me. It closes with,
"The officers came to campus after receiving information from a female who said she had spotted the
suspect," clearly implying that I was the one spotted.
In fact, the female had contacted the police earlier in
the day, long before I arrived on campus.
My sense that this was the impression conveyed
by the article was confirmed when scores of people
came up to me asking, "Have you been cleared of
charges yet?" In fact, this has been just about the
only thing I've talked about for the last week. I've
even been approached by two of my professors who
were concerned about the article.
To be sure: I was not arrested. I am not, nor have I
ever been, a suspect. I was stopped briefly by the ville
police on my way to class last Wednesday solely because
ofthe type of glasses I wear and my hairstyle (which, by
the way, is the wrong color). I know ofat least one other
person who was similarly accosted by the police.
I understand that mistakes get made sometimes,
and I accept The Phoenix's apology. But I would implore The Phoenix to be more mindful in the future
of the impact its stories can have in this small, tightly
knit community, where nasty rumors and mistaken
impressions spread like wildfire.

Support groups should alter
admission requirements
groups provide cultural support. So if a person exists who
is culturally, in his own mind, of a certain race, he can be
denied valuable support due to the color of his skin. An example of such a student would be a white student adopted
by black parents who wishes to attend a BCC support group
but cannot.
Second, I'm worried about the message that any type of
racial barrier sends to the majority of students on campus.
Sams himself contended that part of the justification for
closed meetings is that "there is a need to be among people
that you are like and have shared similar experience with
as opposed to those who symbolically look or represent
...

IF THE DEFINED PURPOSE OF THE GROUPS
WERE KEPT THE SAME AND THE CRITERIA
FOR ATTENDANCE WERE A SELF-DEFINED
CULTURAL STANDARD RATHER THAN AN EXTERNALLY DEFINED RACIAL ONE, WOULD
THE GROUPS REALLY LOSE ANYTHING?
the kind of oppression you are trying to thwart."
This type of message, while I certainly do not, for the
record, find at all offensive, does promulgate a culture of
separation and division; after all, the premise that people
oppression" is a
can "symbolically look or represent
premise that categorizes people based on race.
In order to maintain the success of support groups, one
might argue, such a message will simply have to be sent.
However, I question this logic.
If the defined purpose of the groups were kept the same
and the criteria for attendance were a self-defined cultural
standard rather thanan externally definedracial one, would
the groups really lose anything?
I, for one, don't think so. Sams said that he has "never
...

seen white students who define themselves culturally as
black." From this perspective, the changing definition of
admittance to the groups would really have no tangible effect on membership and therefore no effect on the effectiveness of the groups.
If it ever did, as I believe it would, it would merely serve
to provide cultural support to those extra few who need it.
Such students, since self-defined as the race of their support
group, would not detract from the aura of support and comfort at meetings.

No, the effect would be subtler. The effect would be to
destroy the last remnants of officially defined racial separation at Swarthmore.
Still, Sams argued, the minority community's self-interest can be easily justified. He said, "I would say that absolutely when people of color are working in their own interest, they should do that work among themselves with their
own goals as their primary concern, and then later link up

with allies in support of their work."
I agree. The black (or any other racial minority) community is in no way obligated to change theirracial standard
for admittance to support groups. In fact, I even believe that
they have earned the right to act in their own self-interest
without first considering this self-interest's impacts on the
larger community.
So whatI ask for, respectfully, is a favor. Understanding
its right to exclude based on race, the favor I ask of the minority community is that it not exercise this right. Choosing to change the definitionof who can attend meetings from
a racial one to a cultural one would, I think, contribute to a
feeling of acceptance and multi-culturalism on campus while
depriving support groups of nothing.
In this way, the groups will still be acting primarily in
their own interests while secondarily benefitting
Swarthmore as a whole. So to the support groups on campus, I ask you to thinkabout it, just as a favor— not one you
owe, by any means, but one you can easily give.

UN DEPTHI

With a developer already selected, discussions beginning about how the college could
be compensated for giving up its athletic fields, and a referendum to change the borough's
liquor laws planned for the spring, the college and the borough are taking concrete steps toward a hotel
on college-owned lane .
College and borough officials emphasized that plans for a hotel depend on the as-yet uncertain outcome of many key
factors. But they are working together to facilitate what they describe as a common goal for both of them.
"A lot of things have to happen for this inn to happen, and I don'tknow if those things will line up," said Swarthmore borough council
member Don Delson. But, he added, "I think people would like it to happen."
Those close to the project say that the hotel, to be built west ofChester Road on the college's athletic fields, would benefit both the town
and gown contingencies of Swarthmore by providing a much-needed place for college visitors to stay while helping to revitalize the
borough's declining downtown. The development of a hotel is part of a town revitalization report prepared for the borough in Septem,
ber 1999 by a consultant team.
"The college and the borough are very closely linked and I believe that it's in everybody's interest to stabilize the economy in the
borough, rather than end up with a town without any vitality," college Vice President for Facilities and Services Larry Schall said.
Neither the college nor the town would actually build or operate the hotel; rather, the college would lease its land to a developer
who would construct and run the hotel. The college would have control over the design of the building, however, and the town
would have input into the building size and appearance. The hotel would also have to receive zoning approval from the borough
council.
Preliminary plans for the hotel call for a three-story structure with approximately 80 rooms, a restaurant seating up to 200
people and conference space; a separate but adjacent building would have retail space for the college bookstore and a cafe. These
two structures would total about 65,000 square feet. A multi-level parking garage with approximately 220 spaces would also be
built next to the hotel. An additional 60 or so spots would be provided. In addition to the hotel itself, the southern entrance to the
college would be renovated completely and substantial road work would be done to create a smoother traffic flow and to
minimize the impact of extra vehicles. No decisions have been made about the architectural design of the building.
Intended "to help the developerand the college conceptualize the footprint ofwhat thehotelwould be like," according to Schall, this
initial design was created by the Haverford Hotel Group, a developer that the college selected this spring after a nine-month search.
"We wanted someone who wanted to do [the project], who was able to do it financially, and who had a vision similar to
ours," Schall said.
If the project continues to move forward, Schall said the college would begin serious conversations with this developer
about the proposed development.
Excluding the parking garage and road rehabilitation, the hotel would cost slightly more than $lO million and would be
paid for by the developer. It has not yet been determined who would pay for the other components of the project. Although
the borough has repeatedly said that it will not use tax revenues to pay for a hotel, Schall and borough officials said that
some state and federal grants might be available for the road work. Schall also said that the college could decide to do
part of the project itself.

From HOTEL, pg. 15
The college would receive some sort of com-

pensation
which could be a monetary sum or a
rebate in room nights from the developer for
leasing its land.
"We don't see this as an economic risk nor do
we plan to get rich off this project," Schall said.
"We want it to stand on its own, returning reasonable profits to the developer."
The college, which shared the cost of the revitalization strategy, has spent about $50,000 on the
project so far
"very little," according to Schall.
The plans for a hotel face several hurdles before they can be made a reality. First, because the
college would lose the use of several acres of institutionally zoned property if it were to lease that
land for a hotel, the borough must agree to rezone some college property for institutional use
that is currently zoned only for residential use.
The location of that land and its potential uses
are yet to be determined through discussions between the college and the borough. Moreover, in
orderfor a hotel to be economically feasible, residents would have to vote to change the borough's
liquor laws, which currently do not allow businesses to sell alcohol. Finally, the college would
have to reach an agreement with its developer on
exactly how the project would be carried out.
And while no scientific survey has been done
of how Swarthmore residents, faculty and students feel about a hotel on college land, informal
interviews conducted this week revealed an overall ambivalence toward the project. Responses to
the proposed hotel ranged from wholehearted
support to strong opposition, with many people
lukewarm or indifferent. Some felt that a hotel
would provide a place for guests to stay and bring
more activity to the town, while others questioned
whether a hotel should be a priority for the college or doubted such a venture would be profitable. A frequent concern expressed by students,
faculty and borough residents was the loss of open
space that would occur if a hotel were built on
the athletic fields.

The

impetus for developing a hotel came out
of the 1999 report of the borough's Revital
ization Task Force, though there have been
discussions for years about such a possibility, according to Borough Manager Jane Billings.

The revitalization effort was influenced in part
by a talk on urban decay and revitalization that
Chris Leinberger '72, a former member of the
board of managers, gave to the college and town
residents in January 1998. Soon afterwards the

town formed the task force that explored some of
the same recommendations including the dethat Leinberger made in
velopment of a hotel

his talk.
But the talk also created the perception that
the college was trying to master-mind the revitalization effort, Vice President Maurice Eldridge.
Eldridge, who was a memberof the task force,
said, "A lot of my timeand effort was spent making clear thatthe college had no agenda we wanted
to impose and that we would be willing to collaborate to the extent we could. I think that succeeded."
Public input gathered from focus groups and
town meetings indicated that there was support
for an inn. Moreover, in an informal survey conducted by borough council memberAlice "Putty"
Willetts in 1998, 38 percent of respondents mentioned the development of a hotel in Swarthmore.
Of that figure, 36 percent said they would support
such a venture.

SEPTEMBER 28, 2000

THE PHOENIX

"Many, many people said we needed an inn," said Willetts.
"It came up over and over."
The task force's 1999 report contains 34 recommendations
for town revitalization, several of which involved development
on college land. But borough officials emphasized that these
improvements can be implemented independently of each
other.
After the task force made its report, an implementation
committee was formed to oversee the process of carrying out
the report's recommendations. Consisting of borough officials,
business owners, and Schall as a representative of the college, it currently meets every three or four weeks.

The

reasons given in support of a hotel begin with the
pragmatic: The lack of a comfortable place to stay that
is located close to the college and the borough. Cur
rently, visitors to Swarthmore, including parents and
prospective students, must find rooms at least 15 minutes away
in Media or at the airport.
"From the college's perspective, we feel like not being able
to provide space for families and alumni is not a good thing,"

Schall said.

Not only those affiliated with the college, but guests of
Swarthmore residents could also benefit from being able to
stay locally, according to town officials.
Students and town residents even those who questioned
overwhelmingly cited
some aspect of the proposed hotel
the need for a hotel or inn to accommodate out-of-town-guests.
"I think it's something that's desperately needed," said
Steven Salter 'O2. "I know my parents often have trouble finding a place to stay."
Professors also mentioned their current difficulties find-

ing convenient accommodations for external examiners and
visiting speakers.
Although Schall said the hotel would be "comfortable and
attractive," he did not think that its average rate of about $l2O
per night, which is more expensive than the airport but
cheaper than downtown Philadelphia
would be a deterrent
for most people. By comparison, two other hotelslisted on the
Swarthmore Web site, the Airport Hilton and the Pace One
Restaurant and Country Inn in Thornton, cost about $ll5 and
$lO5 per night respectively.
But the construction of a hotel is also linked to the larger
goal of revitalizing the borough's downtown, which has suffered a serious decline over the past 50 years and will continue this downward trend unless something is done to stop
it, according to Schall.
"We naturally tend to say what's here today will be here
tomorrow," he said. "But unless everyone is continually proactive about it, I think it will decline and face greater pres-

sure.

According to college and town officials, making the downtown area more economically healthy is essential both for the
borough itself and for the college. "What's good for the town
is what's good for the college, and what's good for the college
is what's good for the town," borough council member Anne

Seidman said.

Economics professor Steve O'Connell and history professor Bob Weinberg also felt that the hotel could contribute to
revitalization ofSwarthmore's downtown. "It might help keep
the downtown part of Swarthmore alive" by creating more
business there, Weinberg said.
Schall and some town officials felt that the hotel and restaurant might draw more customers to the downtown shops;
however, Billings conceded that the consultants involved in
the project did not think that an inn of 65 or 70 rooms (its
original proposed size) would generate a substantial amount
of new business.
Gary Hack, a professor of city and regional planning at the
University of Pennsylvania, believes that such a hotel would
have a "modestly positive effect." He predicts that if each hotel guest spends $2O in local shops for every night ofhis or her
stay, and if the hotel is at 70 percent occupancy year-round,
then the hotel would contribute $332,000 in revenues to nearby
stores. This figure "is only a smallfraction ofthe sales needed
to keep them in business," Hack said. "The project will help,
even if it is not decisive in revitalization efforts."
Some people interviewed felt that a hotel is not the best

way for the college to help Swarthmore's downtown if that is

what it wants to do.
"The Ville is dead; everyone knows that," said Jared
Solomon 'OL "We could do a lot of other things with investment in the Ville besides the hotel." He suggested more student-friendly shops as a place to start.
But while the hotel might not significantly boost the
borough's economy, it could have the positive effect ofexpanding its tax base and easing the high tax burden on residents.
(Although the college is tax-exempt because of its status as a
nonprofit institution of higher learning, the site of the hotel
would be rezoned so it could be taxed commercially.) Since
local taxes consist solely of real estate taxes and Swarthmore
has few commercial businesses, the current tax base is primarily residential. "If you had any significant commercial
real estate tax, everybody would pay less," Delson said.
Students and faculty and town officials also cited the hotel's
potential to help integrate the college and the town.
Jordan Brackett 'Ol said, "I think it's the only chance to
turn the Ville from what it is now
a place students don't
to something that integrates the campus into
really visit
the community."
Delson was more cautious in his predictions. "It will bring
more people from the borough closer to campus," he said.
"Whether it will also bring more people from the college closer
to the borough, I don'tknow."
Although Billings was not sure if the hotel alone would
forge a connection between the campus and the community,
she said the road work to be done as part of the project would
eliminate some of the physical barriers separating the college from Swarthmore's downtown.

But

the development of a hotel cannot happen until the
college and the borough work out what the college
will receive in exchange for allowing its land to be
used for the hotel, Schall said. Since a hotel on college property would require leasing four or five acres of institutionally zonedland that is, land that can be used for dorms,
classrooms, and other institutional purposes
the college
has told borough officials it would require a zoning variance
on other college-owned land that is currently zoned only for

residential use.
"The hotel is a good idea," Schall said, "but we don't think
that a hotelis so critical to the college's mission that we would
give up land without some compensatory land."
Town officials said they were aware of this request, though
the college had not yet given them specific details. "We expect
that the college will ask that some of its existing land that is
not institutionally zoned be rezoned for institutional use,"
Billings said.
According to Schall, the college would probably ask for the
zoning variance on a similar amount of land to that which
would be rezoned for the hotel. The residential area of Elm
and Cedar Avenues is a possible candidate for the rezoning,
Schall said.
At the same time as it begins rezoning discussions related
to the proposed hotel, the college is entering discussions with
the borough's Senior Citizen Task Force on establishing a lease
for about six acres of institutionally zoned land that it owns
past the MaryLyon residence hall. The land wouldbe used to
expand an existing retirement community, Morganwood, that
is owned by a branch of the Presbyterian Church.
And as with land for a hotel, Schall said, "if the college
gave up that institutionally zoned land it would need a further zoningreadjustment." Once again, the college would want
a similar amount ofland rezoned from residential to institutional use.
Schall said the college will send a letter to the Implementation Task Force within the next week to begin the zoning variance discussions. Addressing both the zoning variances related to the hotel and to Morganwood, "the letter tries to walk
a line between being too specific and not specific enough,"
Schall said.
"We have some thoughts about what would be reasonable,"
Schall said. But "exactly how we use the land needs to be the
result of thoughtful conversations. We don't wantto preclude
that by saying that this is how we're going to use it, period,"
Schall said.

"THE HOTEL IS A GOOD IDEA/' SCHALL SAID, "BUT
WE DON'T THINK THAT A HOTEL IS SO CRITICAL TO
THE COLLEGE'S MISSION THAT WE WOULD GIVE
UP LAND WITHOUT SOME COMPENSATORY LAND."
The letter is in part a response to the borough's request
that the college be more specific about its rezoning requests,
Schall said. However, the college also does not want to cut off
any of its options by being too specific. For instance, Schall
said that a borough official who objected to having a residence
hall on the rezoned land might not mind having an academic
building there.
Schall emphasized that the college wouldn't lease either
parcel ofland "unless we get readjustments that are very valuable for the college in the long run."
Moreover, he said, "about 50 things must happen" before
any rezoning changes would be made.
According to Schall, the college does not yet have specific
plans for the institutionally zoned land it could gain through
a deal with the borough, and nothing would likely be done on
that land for many years. Nevertheless, the zoning variance
is significant because it gives the college more flexibility with
regard to how it could use the rezoned land.
If the college and the borough come to an agreement on the
rezoning issue, the Board of Managers would have to approve
the use of college land for the hotel, according to Eldridge.
"The board...would have to hear very good reasons why it's
in the college's best interest to do that," he said.

The

success of the project also depends on whether the
borough can change its liquor laws, since the economic
feasibility of a hotel restaurant depends on being able
to serve alcohol.
"If the liquor [change] doesn't go through, the developer is

not interested," Schall said.
In 1949, the borough voted Ull to 55 to become a dry town.
In May 2001, the borough council plans to ask voters in a referendum whether they wish to change the town's liquor laws
so that alcohol can be served only in a hotel on college property. Restricting the sale of liquor so narrowly would prevent
the establishment of bars in the borough, council members
say, and the college would be able to regulate the conditions

under which alcohol would be served.
"It's my belief that the college will be a good neighbor and
that we have similar goals," Seidman said. "I don't think [serving alcohol] will have any negative consequences for the community."

However, the state liquor code currently does not allow
towns to put a question on the ballot that restricts the sale of
liquor to such an extent. As a result, the borough is trying to
amend the state liquor code. The state is expected to vote on
the issue sometime before Thanksgiving.
Borough officials were confident that their amendment
would pass in the legislature. "My understanding is that most
amendments to the liquor code if they're well-supported
do pass, and this one appears to be well-supported," Billings

said
But they were less sure whether borough residents would
vote in favor of the change. "I think it will pass. I don't think
it will be a landslide, but I think it will slip through," Seidman
said.
Interviews with residents and faculty revealed a range of
attitudes toward the possible change in the borough's liquor
code.
"I think that in a hotel it would be fine," resident Michael
Hathaway said of selling liquor. "I believe Swarthmore's trustees would be responsible in making sure it was well-managed."
Others felt that even the very restricted saleofalcohol could
change the atmosphere of the borough. "I oppose it," resident
David Hall said. "At the moment, the borough is a wonderful
place to raise children. Bars and children don't mix."
History professor Roger DuPlessis and political science
professor Rick Valelly were uncomfortable with the ethical
implications of the college becoming the sole supplier of liquor in the borough. In a working paper they wrote on the
issue of hotel in Swarthmore, they asked, "Given widespread
alcohol abuse among high school and college students around
the country, ought we as an institution to go into the history
of American higher education as a prime mover in facilitating the sale of liquor in the borough?"
Schall acknowledged that serving alcohol on a college campus could be an issue for some people. But he said the restaurant generally would not be a place where students would go
to eat. "This is not where underage drinking is going to happen," he said.
Brackett was worried about the opposite problem: that students' social lives might be curtailed by the proximity of the
hotel. While saying that he would support a hotel if it did not

impact student life, he wondered, "Would police be more likely
to nab drunk students walking back to their dorms? Could we
still have parties in Olde Club?"
Schall said that student socialactivities would not be much
impacted by the hotel and that he doubted there would not be
a greater police presence on campus. But, he said, "I suppose
if a student were going to Palmer or Pittenger, walking under
the tunnel with beer, that might possibly create some issues,
but it would likely create an issue now anyway."

More

than alcohol, however, a concern repeatedly
expressed by students, faculty, and residents was
the potential loss of open space thatwould occur if

the hotel were located on the athletic fields.
"When you drive by it's nice to see big, open fields with
people doing stuff on them as opposed to a hotel and parking
lot," said Tim Gray 'OL
But borough officials said that college property is the only
open space available for the development of a hotel.
"There is no other property for the hotel," Delson said.
Billings said that renovating an existing building was not
an option because there was no structure that would be large
enough for the hotel.
Maintaining that those working on the building design
were "very conscious" of the views across the athletic fields,
Schall said that the design of the hotel would try to maintain
as much open space as possible.
And not everybody felt that a hotel wouldn't be able to
achieve some sort of satisfactory balance. "I'm relying on the
planners to preserve as much they can of that view while gaining some of the advantages of a hotel," O'Connell said.
The construction of the hotel would not only mean covering open space, however; it would also lead to the loss of several athletic fields and student parking in C-lot.
However, Schall said that 60 or 70 spots would be built for
students.
As for the athletic fields, Schall said they probably would
be relocated to the an area across Crum Creek where the college has a nursery and also leases land for a leaf recycling
facility. This site is currently zoned for residential use, and
Schall said he was not sure if putting the athletic fields there
would require a zoning change.
Athletic director Bob Williams, who said thathe and Schall
had had one discussion about the issue, felt that the plan for
relocating the athletic fields was sound. The new softball, football, and soccer fields would have more space than the existing ones, as well as a support facility similar to the one at
Cunningham Field. And unlikethe current fields, they would
also have synthetic playing surfaces and lights.
Although the fields would be farther away than they are
now, they would still be closer to the fieldhouse than
Cunningham fields. "I think in terms of the positive gains
synthetic surfaces and lights
it would be a fair tradeoff,"
Willams said. "It seems as though we'd be well taken care of."
However, Williams said that he was concerned about the
possible impact on the athletic program between when construction on a hotel would begin and the completion of new
fields. "I'm sure we'd have to do without some field space for
a while," he said.
A related issue is the effect that the fields could have on
the environment in the Crum. Roger Latham, a former professor of biology at the college, said that the proposed relocation site wouldresult in a fairly minimal environmental impact. "The athletic fields would have no more impact than the
compost facility, maybe even less," he said. But, he added, "the
college needs to be really careful where they locate the fields

and seek advice from those who know the pedagogical and
environmental values of the Crum."
Even if the location has little effect, the infrastructure
needed to get to the fields could create problems. "If they were
to build a bridge over the Crum, that could conceivably be an
environmental disaster," Latham said.
While there would be some environmental impact wherever a bridge wouldbe built, according to Latham, the college
could choose to minimize that impact by locating a bridge at
certain places rather than others. Alternatively, the college
could avoid the issue altogether by using a shuttle to transport people to the fields on existing roads.
Latham said that after talking to college officials, he felt
confident that environmental concerns would be taken into
account for this project.
Another question that has yet to be answered is whether
the hotelwouldbe profitable. Before committing to the project,

UN DEPTHI

the developer will conduct a detailed market supply-and-demand analysis that will look at who would come to stay at the
hotel and what price could be charged. Schall said that the
analysis, which will probably occur before the end of next
summer, will study sources of demand from the college and
borough, as well as from the surrounding region.
The analysis is critical, according to Schall, because it must
be used to secure a bank loan.
But while the analysis will not be done until later, "the
developer feels very strongly that there's nothing like this in
the county," Schall said. "If you're offering a small, comfortable inn at the campus as an option to the chains at the airport, it will attract a lot of clients."
O'Connell, who teaches economics, holds a similar view.
"Given the lack of comparable hotels nearby, I think there's a
market niche here," he said.
Schall said that 30 percent of the hotel'sbeds wouldbe filled
by guests affiliated by the college.
But not everybody is convinced that a hotel would be economically viable.
Resident Ezra Krendel said that the 30 percent figure is
misleading because it does not represent the average college
demand. "Although the Hotel would be occupied 100 percent
for alumni events and graduation—for which it couldn't come
close to meeting the needs therewould be an economic need
to fill the many vacant rooms during the rest of the time."
A draft of the task force's report concludes that demand
from the college would fill the hotel on at least 42 nights per
year between late March and early October. For all other
nights, the demand from the college would fill 16 or 17 rooms.
According to the report, alternative sources of demand might
come from the borough or other institutions, such as Wid>
ener University.
A hotel can be profitable at about a 70 percent occupancy
rate, according to Schall.
The report also said that, from 1992 to 1998, the average
occupancy rates at 19 area hotels have increased from 66.7
percent to 74.9 percent, while room rates rose from an average of $70.41 to $100.04.

Hack said that while the college demand would not nearly
produce the necessary occupancy rates, "every suburban area
has a latent demand for hotel space.... I would not worry about
assuming the hotel is priced right
the market for rooms
and managed well," he said.
Sidney Wong, also a professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, said, "If a developer
decides that it is a reasonable risk to put large amount of investment in this project without any subsidy, there must be
some good reasons for that."
Schall said that there was the possibility of offering a developer a property tax concession but that it had not been
discussed specifically.
Regardless of whether it is profitable, however, Valelly and
DuPlessis felt that the project would fail to promote the best
use of college money.
"While eventual relocation of the athletic fields may be
desirable, building an inn and associated structures on the
field means that such relocation must go to the top of the list
of projects, necessarily displacing other more pressing uses
of funds," they said.

Meanwhile,

the project is moving ahead. The bor
ough has authorized a traffic study to look at the
best way for traffic to flow in the Chester Road and
College Avenue area. Schall said that the college
and the borough, as well as perhaps the developer, will pay
for the study.
As discussions about land rezoning get underway and the
borough prepares for a spring referendum on the alcohol issue, the town and gown contingencies of Swarthmore seem to
be waiting for each other to reach a decision.
"It's pretty much in the borough's hands," Schall said of the
project. "The borough must decide if they want it to happen."
But Delson said, "From my perspective a lot of the final
consideration of this inn is at the college level. The ball's in
their court."
So how likely are we to see a hotel in Swarthmore?
College and borough officials say it's too early to tell and
that there are too many variables involved.
But Schall said, "As long we're having conversations about
it, as long as it's progressing and people maintain their good
will, it could happen."

Case study: Lessons in dating
BY MARY CAMPBELL
So I am single now. Free. Extricated. Unfettered, like the
wind. Free to roam around campus, bemoaning the fact that I
am, once again, singularly single. Oh, the horror of it all.
That is, of course, whatI was doing last Friday evening,
while lying on Parrish Beach with my Phoenix buddy, Dee
blowing up my inflatable chair and waxing poetic about
the tortures of being single. Not that I'm bothered about
being single or anything. It's just that Dee was reading the
October edition of Cosmo, and there was this article, you
see. And, as everyone knows, Cosmo is the unintuitive gal's
guide to being intuitive when it comes to dealing with men.
A veritable how-to guide. The article was all about how a
lonely, singularly single woman, like me, who doesn't care
about being single, can snag a hulking hunk of her own, in
nine easy steps. Apparently, as my other buddy Erica confirmed, the followingfail-proof tactics, when employed, will
make him fall him fall head-over-heels for you:
L Make him think y'all were meant to be using ESP.
Ohhh...psychic connections.
2. Mimic his conversational mannerisms, so that you will have
something in common when you try to have a discussion.
3. Forget about yourself and use "we" statements. That way,
he will forget you ever weren't together.
4. Thrill him until he can't run away and has no choice but
to be with you (e.g., go Whitewater rafting
and get lost).
5. Wear hot colors. Make him melt into your shirt.
6. Play mirror mimic his every move. After all, what do
guys like more than themselves?
7. Along the same lines, use his name like seasoning in
your conversational concoction.
8. Touch him. Touch him. Touch him!
9. Play telephone psychic and say things like "Yeah, I can
tell you are really insightful." He'll think you are like, a
prognosticator or something.
"Hmm...," I thought, resting my chin upon my relaxed
fist. Contemplative. Rodin.
Dressed to the nines in my once-pit-stained, now-hotpink-dyed T-shirt, I showed up at Olde Club, ready to party
rugby-style and equipped with sure-fire tactics to transform myself into sexual rubber cement and reduce any man
to whatever sticks to rubber cement.
After a few cups ofhot pink junglepunch, I selected my
test case. (Note: Names have been altered to protect the
victim. Facts have been embellished for purposes of entertainmentand to fill in gaps in my faltering memory. I think
I have Alzheimer's.)
Mary: Hey, I have been staring at you all night, Unnamed
Freshman To Whom I Was Remotely Attracted [UFTWIWRA].
are you drunk? Aren't
yeah, um
UFTWIWRA: Um
you like, a senior?
Mary: Nope, I am another s-word, a sophomore. [Mary, the
smooth operator, places her hand on UFTWIWRA's shoulder.] We must have a psychic connection, UFTWIWRA.
You're from Unnamed State, right?
UFTWIWRA: Yeah, that'sright. How did you remember that?
Mary: Well, UFTWIWRA, I just remembered. [He touches
his head. I touch my head.] So, you know, we should dance
a little bit closer. Am I making you nervous? [Mary removes
her hand from her head and places it on his arm.]
UFTWIWRA: Oh, um... no. No. You aren't making me nervous. [He gulps.]
Mary: I see. You know, we should go mountain climbing
some time. That would be fun.
UFTWIWRA: Mary, right? That is your name.
Mary: Yeah, UFTWIWRA. Like I said, we are psychically
linked.
UFTWIWRA: Well, I gotta go now. I promised my friend I
would meet her at like, 1:00, and I really need to go.
Mary: Oh, but don't go now. Please. Please. We were just
beginning to have fun.
UFTWIWRA: Nope, I really have to go. See you around.
Boy, are you going to be embarrassed on Monday.
I saw him again at 1:30 a.m.
So, my little experiment was a failure. I guess it just
goes to show that even when applied in the correct situation and carried out with the utmost finesse, Cosmo dating tips just plain don't send him into libidinal convulsions.
But, then again, it always works for Erica, right? Right. So
maybe I should amend that statement. Here is the moral of
this little spiel (Papers and pencils out?): Don't read Cosmo
if you are a socially awkward gal, bemoaning the fact that
you are free, unfettered, and have gas.

The dating dynamics at Swat
If everybody wants some, how come no one gets any?
BY MORGHAN HOLT
There's a definite aura that lingers
on our campus: an almost palpable tension, hunger, lust, that skulksbetween
words and lurks deep within seemingly
meaningless glances all week. The
tension's waiting patiently for its imminent weekend release, whenall hell
breaks loose and the sex-starved
Swatties rise to the surface, no longer
able to mask their desire, frustrated by
their lack of action, and raring to do
something about it. It's odd, this little
phenomenon, because it so easily
evades attention. If you weren't a part
of the Swat community, or weren't socially aware enough to observe its existence, it might go by unnoticed. In
small ways, this quiescent yearning
emerges during the week, but remains
so pathetically passive that only the
keenest of keen onlookers can see
through its many guises: his casual
check-out at the Pizza Bar as she hurriedly slops grease-soaked cheese slices
onto her tray, worried that she won't
manage to eat and make it to seminar
on time; her longing gaze across
ParrishParlors at the guy too absorbed
in his Engineering homework to noticeher existence, muchless her interest; the tangible energy shared by a
couple for the briefsecond oftheir pass-

ing in the Kohlberg stairwell. If you
weren't actively looking for outward
signs of attraction, you'd never see
them, which, when you listen to any

random conversation or walk into
sweltering, bumping Paces on a Friday
night and watch as guy after stupidly

drunken guy staggers up to girls he hopes
are halfas drunk as he, or watch as people
who have never exchanged words thread
their inebriated tongues down each other's
throats as they grind barbarically to the
Thong Song, seems, well, completely contradictory.
In my quest for understanding, my
attempt to find the missing pieces, to fill

the gap between our celibate weeks and
our rampant weekends, I passed out surveys. Ten guys and ten girls reluctantly
responded to my questions about their
positions on and opinions about the dating scene at Swat. I could have predicted
it from my past experience with everyday conversation, which seems somehow forever hinged upon how badly she
wants him, but doesn't have him, or how
badly he wants someone
a companion, an intimate partner with whom to
pass his time
but hasn't been able to
be find them. The student body, in general, wishes it were dating. Why, then, I
asked myself, is it that so few Swatties
are in serious relationships, that so few
Swatties share this intimate bond they
all seem to so desperately want?
Maybe it's that we're not following
Emilia's sage advice for singles, or
maybe it's that we are. At any rate, some
thing isn't working. I found, in surveying, thatthe vast majority of the respondents had been involved in at least one
serious relationship since they'd been
students at Swat. However, it also held
that most ofsaid relationships had ended
in disaster. A number of my respondents
were dumped; others bemoaned scheduling problems, workload, timecommitments, and divergent goals as the decidTHE PHOENIX

ing factors for the split. Nearly all of
those who had been in a relationship
at Swat felt that they benefited from
it in some way or another and,
whether they had been dumpee or
dumper, would seriously consider
dating another Swattie. So why aren't
our relationships working?
One thing that's certain is that, in
general, we Swatties like booty, and
most of us are willing to not only drop
our dating standards, butalso desperately seek out drunken hook-ups to
fulfill our sexual urges. Eighty percent of my respondents admitted to
having (repeated) random hook-ups,
and, of those, 60 percent said they actually prefer random hook-ups to
long-term, committed relationships.
Still, not one of those surveyed denied
the fact that they, on some deeper
level, have a certain degree of desire
to date someone at Swat, provided the
right person/situation presents itself.
So what's our deal? Why can't we get
it together enough to prevent our
classes from obstructing our social
lives? Why do we postpone or avoid
serious interpersonal relationships
and "real chemistry" for the sake of
our classes? We're too distracted by
chemistry class, as Mike Smith 'O3
points out, to do anything but satiate
our most primal urges, getting horny
and drunk, or vice versa, and hopping

into bed with another person (an
amazing 75 percent of my respondents named alcohol as the core catalyst for our random hook-ups).

What are the gravitationally
challenged to do in this modern
world of popularized, high-gloss
emaciation? It is difficult to say
what caused the current paradigm
of beauty to value fatlessness so
greatly, but the fact must be accepted that to be considered beautiful by the general population, you
must be skinny.
Goneare the days when being rotund signified wealth and status,
while thinness implied poverty.
What avenues can the prospective
thin person travel to reach the
pearly gates of waifdom?Before we
enumerate these, a warning must
be given, boys and girls: being thin
will greatly increase your chances
of being propositioned by dirty old
men. On the plus side, it will probably be easier to get jobs.
Thanks to modern medicine, it
is now possible to remove fat using a high-powered, sub-dermal
blubber vacuum. Liposuction has
the seductive quality of removing
unwanted fat cells in targeted areas, so that those areas lose the
ability to store fat effectively. Unfortunately, liposuction does nothing to modify the patient's metabolism, so the sinister body craftily

diverts new fat into un-sucked areas, causing those regions to grow
grotesquely. So, like that mythical

Goddess, who wished her

mortal

lover to never die but vacantly
overlooked the fact that he would

perpetually, the process of
liposuction is near-sighted.
A great number of people have found
that self-imposed starvation and self-induced vomiting are also effective methods for losing and keeping off weight.
Some even regularly ingest laxatives to
induce "rectal vomiting." Too bad these
strategies inevitably lead to unattractive
age

frailness, enamel-less teethand chronic
shit stains, as well as a mangled digestive tract.
A more realistic approach to weight
control is to become a smoker. Smoking a large number of cigarettes before
a meal greatly reduces appetite, and becoming a smoker is very easy. Plus, all
the money you wouldhave spent on food
can be spent on your cigarette addiction,
so this method entails no additional expenses. Of course, many are repulsed by
this approach because of the odor and
the inevitable bronchial filth, which are
symptoms of a successful smoker.
The only truly effective way to lose
weight is commonly known but is rarely
adhered to for the amount of time necessary for it to work. This strategy involves eating modest, healthful meals
and exercising frequently. The problem
withthis strategy is that it requires psychological toughness and persistence,
and those desiring girth reduction often
entrench themselves in false optimism
instead of approaching it like the intensivemental and physical labor it is. The
reason so many people are in a state of
self-loathing about their physiques is
that losing weight is difficult. Those who

are apathetic towards you (strangers
and acquaintances) won't support you,
while your friends run therisk of seeming shallow if they encourage you. If
your friends accept you, your weight
should be inconsequential.
Losing weight is like crossing a sweltering desert. The journey is long, monotonous, punctuated with massive
dunes and the traveler is deprived of
nourishment. But in the weight loss
desert, if the traveler looks behind, he
or she sees lush, expansive candy meadows in whichtootsie pops and ice cream
cones jut from the earth like flowers,
streams of thick chocolate milk and
Coca-Cola meander through the landscape, gardens with rich, frosty cupcake
trees and bon-bon bushes bloom prolifically and Willy Wonka river-dances in
the background. The border between
these worldsfollows the traveler so that
every step he or she takes toward the
land of plenty is one step that must be
retraced through the desert of deprivation. Fortunately, the desert eventually
ends and gives way to a moderate,
peaceful climate. But the land of plenty
never disappears; it beckons endlessly
to the traveler who, should he or she
pursue this mirage, will quickly find he
or she has re-entered the desert.
If you can't deal with this rigorous
journey, then just learn to accept your
body. There are plenty of people in the
world who don't care that your dimensions aren't acceptable by society's
standards.Find one of these people and
get hitched.

How to buff
up your sex
muscles
BY THE SEXUAL HEALTH COUNSELORS
What are Kegel exercises and why should you
do them? In 1952 Arnold Kegel (pronounced "KayGill"), a gynecologist, developed this set of
exercises for women who had trouble controlling
their bladders after childbirth. However, it was
later discovered that Kegel exercises can be
practiced by both men and women and actually
increase sexual pleasure for both. These exercises
are designed to tone the pubococcygeus (P-C), or
pelvic floor, muscles. These are the muscles that
automatically and quickly contract during both
male and female orgasm. If these muscles are
toned, it can increase the intensity and pleasure
of an orgasm.
This is how to perform the Kegel exercises: First
it is necessary to determine where the P-C
muscles are and how to control them. Try stopping
the flow of urine when you pee. The muscles you
use to do this are your P-C muscles. Women can
also find them by inserting a finger in the vagina
and squeezing the walls of the vagina around it. If
a man is erect, contraction of the P-C muscles will
cause the penis to move. However, once he has
identified the muscles, he can contract them when
not erect.

*

Once you have found the P-C muscles, practice
contracting them hard for one second. Do a set of
ten repetitions. Then try contracting and holding for
three seconds. Do a set often of these. Next, try
contracting and releasing the muscles as fast as
you can (this is what happens during orgasm). To
gain buff sexual organs, it is necessary to do some
combination of these three exercises every day. The
good news is that you can do them in class, while
studying, in the car, or while on the computer and
no one will know. Start with five sets often a day,
but as you get better at them, you can work up to
doing twenty sets a day. Don't get discouraged if it
is hard at first once you whip yourself into shape,
the exercises will be easier.
What's the point? Besides better orgasms,
Kegel exercises can increase the enjoyment of
your partner. If a man has well-toned P-C muscles
the force of ejaculation is usually greater. Also,
contracting these muscles during vaginal or anal
sex is often very pleasurable for your partner. By
relaxing these muscles before orgasm a man may
be able to delay orgasm and continue sex for a
longer period of time. By contracting the muscles
during orgasm, many men are able to have
multiple orgasms. During male-female sex, both
partners can contract and release their P-C
muscles to the delight of their partners.
The P-C muscles can also make for slow and
intense sex. During penetration, after foreplay, or
in the middle of sex, try slowing down and
experimenting with what is often called tantric sex.
Don't engage in penile thrusting; with the penis
inside the vagina or anus, concentrate on slow,
synchronized breathing and constant eye contact.
This can be a very intense and loving experience.
With the penis inside (remember no thrusting!),
either partner can begin to slowly contract the P-C
muscles. Try using the same rhythm as your
breathing and remember to maintain eye contact.
This can be very physically exciting as well as
provide a profound way to connect with your
partner. With strong P-C muscles, it is possible for
both men and women to orgasm in response to
their partners' movement of those muscles. It
takes practice and lots of communication between
partners, but it can be a lot of fun.

DATING

Romance on campus
From DATING, pg. 18
Given that the Swarthmore dating scene is

decidedly non-existent, bizarre, ridiculous, lame and
absurd, and that it is, survey says, quite difficult to
establish meaningful relationships on this campus,
some allowances must be made. And the fact that,
as most of my respondents were quick to note, there
exists no romantic happy medium on our campus,
doesn't help the issue. It seems that people here
can't manage to find the middle ground between
simulated marriage and occasional, meaningless
hook-ups. The consensus among the sophomore
male respondents was that the lack of pretty faces
on campus made it especially difficult for them to
find the motivation for instigating a long-term
relationship, but they admitted to, on finding a pretty
girl, clinging to her with all they had, for fear of losing
their exceptional chance. Well, guys, you're not alone
an overwhelming majority of your female
counterparts topped their lists of reasons they
weren't dating with the fact that Swarthmore has
very few males worth dating. Still, we want
relationships, we want true love, we want
companionship, and we want booty on a bi-nightly
basis. It is just that we can't find the right face to

match the ass.
How then, do we change the sad state of our
current dating scene? How do we drag ourselves out
of the drudgery that our single lives have become?
The answer lies in separating ourselves from
ourselves, in stepping outside of our own precious
worlds long enough to let another person in. It's
about eliminating our characteristic analretentiveness and looking beyond the pretty faces, or
lack thereof. Come on guys (and girls, for that
matter), if what you're-really looking for is
companionship, a higher-order relationship with a
truly interesting, invigorating person, forget her face
and look for her. One of my respondents used the
phrase "choice individual," when describing the kind
of girl he was looking for. Honey, you're surrounded
by choice individuals, even if they don't belong on
Glamour covers or Playboy centerfolds. If that's what
you want, stick to hooking up and forget the
relationship scene, because you're wallowing in
fantasy, not living in reality.
By the same token, if we want to functionally date,
we need to discard the notion that our classes are the
most important aspect of our time spent at Swat.
Basically, they're not. We are in a world like no other
and will likely never encounter a setting in which we
are completely surrounded by intelligent people as
eager to learn as we are, and people as capable of
having stimulating and coherent conversations as we.
For one night, forget your books and papers and have
those conversations, let your classmates, hallmates,
fellow Swatties penetrate your world. Stop
complaining about loneliness and make a date with a
living, breathing human being instead of your Art
History book. The sex is much better.
Easier said than done, I know. I'm idealistic: I
believe that relationships at Swarthmore could work,
if only we'd implement a few vital changes, if only
we'd stop stifling ourselves, limiting ourselves to the
personal interaction of weekend hook-ups because
they're not so personal and are, therefore, easier to
deal with, if only we'd stop obsessing. Lighten up,
Swarthmore. Things don't have to be perfect, people
don't have to be perfect, and the work gets done,
even in the presence of a love life. Break the
engagement with Nietzsche and extricate yourself
from your insane romantic criteria, and the world will
look a whole lot better, the people will look a whole
lot better, and the potential for your developing a
serious, workable relationship will be a whole lot
better. Or perhaps, I'm dreamy, quixotic, blinded by
my own Swarthmore Sliding Scale, which has
recently convinced me that Swattie-Swattie
relationships are not only doable, but desirable. And
for God's sake, stop wondering why "everyone else is
doing it, so why aren't we?"

Once upon a fund cut:
A tale of Swat parties
BY JOANNA CURTIS
Once upon a time—say, last springthere were free parties at Swarthmore
almost every weekend. Yes, free, and
they were generally not thrown by fraternities. The scene was variations on
the same elements week after week: token food, dance music, one or two students from other schools google-eyed
over our kegs of freely flowingbeer and
fine wine-in-a-box, Swattie bodies
flaunting our common lack ofcoordination in an orgy of stress release. Occasionally there was some indication of
the student group that had thrown the
party
reggae music or free condoms
or whatever but most of us went for
the basics. Swarthmore has never been
a number-one-party-school kind of institution, but Bryn Mawr women seemed
to like the scene well enough. And so
did plenty of us, regardless of our eternal whining about the lameness and monotony of it all.
Okay, so officially, none of the above
is history. Nothing has happened to prevent the classic Swarthmore party from
continuing its weekly reincarnation,
but even so, in the first three weekends
of the semester, the Student Activities
Committee (SAC)-funded scene has been
dismal. Take this past weekend. Friday
night: nothing. Saturday night: a rugby
party in Olde Club for 3 bucks a head—a good time, but not SAC-funded, and
therefore not free. There were rumors
that a posse of 50 accumulated in Paces
without a permit and scrammed at midnight when Public Safety arrived.
The lone SAC-funded event, Poetry
Slam, took place on Thursday—fun, free,
but not a party, and Thursday doesn't
quite make it as a weekend night around
here. There have been three SAC-funded

IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE
ABSENCE OF PROACTIVE STUDENTS,
THE JOB OF A STUDENT ACTIVITIES
COMMITTEE WOULD BE, WELL, TO
PLAN SOME STUDENTACTIVITIES.
parties so far this semester, all in previous weekends, and all thrown by fraternities. Fraternities have as much right
to throw SAC-funded parties as anyone
else, and DU's Margaritaville is a

Swarthmore institution, but the fact is
thatlots of us are here because we don't
want to go to a school where social life is
predominantly Greek life. SAC has been
an important source of alternatives.
Granted, the recent stagnation of the
SAC-funded scene is not such a tragedy
for upperclass folks. Age in Swarthmore
years is inversely proportional to dependence on SAC for a social life. Getting
older here isn't just about smaller
classes and escalating future-trauma;
it's also a story of building social networks, acquiring wheels, learning

Philly, throwing private parties, checking out clubs, becoming bored with
variations on an all-campus party,
spending Saturday night in a friend's

room with a hard cider in one hand and
seminar reading in the other
all of
which make the SAC-funded party scene

expendable.

So this issue is really about the class
of 'O4. What are first-years doing with
their down time during this socially
critical pass-fail semester? Masturbating? Eh, even genital stimulation gets
old after awhile. No doubt plenty of
them are paying for parties and wondering what that $425 student activities
fee was for, and of course, there are always Swatties with no interest in a
party scene. But several RAs have mentioned that the frosh on their halls
spend inordinate amounts of weekend
hours in their rooms. I hope they aren't
taking their work too seriously so soon.
And maybe they aren't. I've heardmultiple upperclassmen astounded by the
amount of first-year drinking happening in student rooms so far this semester. Hard to doubt that a lack of free,
safe parties is a major cause of that phe-

nomenon.
•
So what's behind the recent SACscene stagnation? Budget cuts? Fears
that our too-cool alcohol policy is slipping away? Difficult to say. No one was
especially enthused by the 19 percent
budget slashes last spring. (For one
thing, what was up with the number 19?
It was like the budget committee had
bought into evil capitalist psychological number games. No, kids, not a fifth
of your budget gone, just 19/100ths.) Responses were vague or unsure when I
asked SAC members about the specs of
their budget. Meg Lippincott 'Ol, SAC
secretary, told me only that "SAC took
the budget cut such that there is a little
less money for all events." But my understanding is that post-budget cut SAC
still has $740 for the weekly party dole

to student groups, enough for two
standard-fare events. So the explanatory power of budget cuts in producing the lack of SAC funded events is
limited. As for the alcohol policy,
nothing has changed. Which leads
me to the obvious explanation of the
party dearth: students just aren't applying to host.
Obvious, yes, and true, but completely unsatisfying. It justs leads to
the equally pressing issue of why students should be any less willing to
throw parties this year than before.
In the end, my only explanation is
psychological. Budget cuts may not
have made parties financially impossible, and the alcohol policy may not
have changed as a result of state police crashing the Margaritaville
party in the spring of 1999, but both
events have made students more cautious about being responsible for parties at Swarthmore. Glibly stated,

never underestimate the power of
fear, whether the object is the police
or one's own inability to throw a
kick-ass party on a shoestring.
If students aren't standing in line
to host parties this semester, it would
seem that in the absence of pro-active students, the job ofa Student Activities Committeewould be, well, to
plan some student activities. But for
now, that may not be necessary.
News is in that SAC-funded partying
will be making its return to
Swarthmore in style this weekend.
Perennial favorite, has moved its
party plans from post-break to next
weekend. Let's hope the drought is
over.

BOOK REVIEW

Literary love found in
Irish 'Small World'
BY CATHERINE OSBORNE

Photo courtesy of Gregory Crane

The painting "Three Kinds of Paths," by Gregory Crane, is currently on display

BY KATE O'DONNELL
You know when you're standing
in front of a piece of art and the people

next to you are babbling pseudo-intellectual comments, inspiring a mixture of sheer disgust and smugness
in you? I find those situations particularly irritating and those types of
people nauseatingly pompous. So
does Gregory Crane.
His wacky paintings beg some
sort of insight, but the artist certainly doesn't stand for that kind of
pretension. In response to a question
regarding the "metaphysical significance" of the three roads in his painting in theList Gallery, "Three Kinds
of Paths," he responded, "Sure,
there's some significance. I mean,
you've got arailroad, a highway, and
a footpath. That's pretty important."

That's it.
The thing is that Crane's paintings are so uncomfortably strange
that you feel that you must come up
with some earth-shattering insight.
It was, admittedly, my initial
agenda. Until I actually saw the
paintings, that is. My first response
was,"what is this guy on?". He is unequivocally probably certifiably
crazy.
Look at any painting; we'll take
the "ThreeKinds of Paths" as an example. It depicts a busy landscape
of a world that doesn't quite fit reality but looks too familiar to be
strictly fantastical. There are indeed three paths
one of which
shoots up, becoming an orange and
fuchsia streak across the sky. The
color palette is sometimes radiant,
as in the bright green trees and the
patches of light in the middleground
and background, and other times

in the List Gallery in LPAC.

murky. The paint is applied thickly,
almost soupily, in some sections, such
as on the wispy willow, which is reminiscent of an illustration from a Dr.

Seuss story.
In other sections, such as in the right
hand side of the sky, the technique is
more pointillist (an artistic technique
that achieves the effect of "evenness"
from a distance, but up close reveals the
painting to be comprised of a dispersion
of tiny dots). The sky is in fact as busy
as the landscape. There is a moon and
the
some sort of other heavenly body

the sky.

"ONE PLUS ONE DOESN'T
EQUAL TWO; IT EQUALS FIVE
MINUS THREE, AND SOMEHOW
YOU GET A TWO IN THERE,"
Around the lower disc sweeps the pre-

viously mentioned road, jutting off as if
propelled by an energy source inherent
in the painting. Directly behind the main
willow tree, there appears to be a sunrise or sunset. If nothing else, Crane is
clearly playing with time. Indeed, the

scene is saturated with details and activities observed and recorded over the
course of a month, according to Crane.
He is fascinated with how much he can
get into one scene without scaring off the
viewer.
There is a sense of timelessness in
this complicated scene. We have different times of day, different weather conditions, different sources of light and

different ambiances, all packed into
these 26 by 78 inches. Foolish is she,
though, who thinks that we are looking at a fantasy world. Well, according

to the artist, anyway. He is completely convinced that what he
paints is "real." He admits to
making a lot of things up, taking
artistic liberty with the time dimension, if you will, but claims
that he is still "one and a half feet
anchored in realism."
Now I realize that, to most
people, the idea that even one half
a foot is not in reality (where it
might be, I will not venture to
guess) would suggest that the
scenes are at least not real.
But this is very much not the
case. Not to Mr. Crane. To be fully
taken by his work, you have to
first surrender disbelief. His vision is a documentary of what is
no longer there.
Many of his scenes are based
in the Northwest, and from this region, Crane takes the essence and
works it out. To him, it is this essence that is "real." He seeks to
"give you a little bit of something
to challenge you with. It's good for
you."
Like good for you in that mindboggling-what-on-earth-is-goingon-here way? Maybe. Or maybe
just good for you in that refreshingly provincial sort of way. Good
for you in that sort of way that reminds you that life isn't just about

naturalism.
That life is more than just a
documentary of scenes, moments
and events. That there is life outside of Swarthmore, even if it is
trippy. That this life requires more
than just living; it requires artistic license. Because, as Crane says,
one plus one doesn't equal two. It
equals five minus three and somehow you get a two in there.

When the young Irish academic, Persse McGarrigle, is
asked on page 6 if his name is short for Percival, David Lodge
demonstrates thathe will not hesitate to pile on the Arthurian
references, which continue to fall thick and fast throughout
the British novelist's fantasia of contemporary academic life
qua Grail Quest. His utterly improbable, utterly charming
book is, after all, subtitled "An Academic Romance." Indeed,
in an epigraph, he employs the same Nathaniel Hawthorne
passage on the "latitude" allowed romance writers that A.S.
Byatt quotes at the beginning ofher work "Possession." Like
"Possession," though in a more obviously comic mode, "Small
World" documents an assortment of English literary scholars
encounters with love and life.
It's 1984 and Persse, a lecturer in the backwater University of Limerick's three-man English department, has never
heard of structuralism, deconstructionism, or Foucault. (Incoming first-years should sympathize.) He resolves to learn
fast, however. For he meets the stunningly beautiful arid
theory-mad Angelica Pabst at his first-ever academic conference and, like any romantic hero worth his starry eyes,
falls desperately in love with her. She, just as predictably,
proves elusive, flitting seconds ahead of him for virtually
the entire novel. But of course that doesn't matter: the Grail
Quest is about the hero's search and deeds, not the cup itself.
In the case of Persse that means obtaining his first credit
card and circling the globe, haunting literature conferences
from Amsterdam to Tokyo in search of his increasingly mysterious lady-love. Along the way, he acquires a wide circle of
friends and enemies, a good, though skeptical, command of
structuralism, arid a certain measure of maturity.
Lodge has a deft and witty style. When Angelica is riitroduced, an unattractive academic is chatting her up while "she
wears the slightly fixed smile of someone who is being sung
at in a musical comedy." Lodge is obviously having the time
ofhis life concocting the bizzare surrealism of the jet-setting
academic world in which Persse finds himself almost by
chance. A scene in which professors and graduate students
take over the town for a street-theater performance of "The
Waste Land" is particularly well-done, seen through Persse's
uninitiated eyes with all the unsettling half-humor of a Dali
painting.
Just as the young Persse is chasing his own romantic fantasy, his older colleagues have a goal of their own. In their
case, the Grail is a semi-mythical literature chair carrying no
teaching responsibilities, to be endowed by UNESCO with
$lOO,OOO annually. For Lodge, "scholars these days are like the
errant knights of old, wandering the ways of the world in
search of adventure and glory." As contemporary analogues

to Percival's legendary fellow knights, Lodge gives us Philip
Swallow, Robin Dempsey, Rudyard Parkinson, and Arthur
Kingfisher. The latter, the ancientand currently impotent king
of literary theorists (here Lodge is perhaps pushing the metaphor a bit too obviously), is searching for an heir winner to
take all in the form of the endowed chair. Swallow, Dempsey,
and Zapp each fall prey to one of the many pitfalls on the path
to the Grail.
Like Thomas Malory or Chretien deTroyes, Lodge has produced a cast of a thousand archetypes. Each is only slightly
fuller than one-dimensional, but comes equipped with a quirky
and clever individualizing trait. We meet the Chorus in the
form of übiquitous American professor Morris Zapp, the evil
female magician as played by the Italian Fulvia Morgana, and
thevillain of the piece, the German Siegfried von Turpitz, who
never takes off the black leather glove on his right hand. Sylvia
Maiden, an elderly lady who studied under the famous folklorist Jessie Weston (the source of T.S. Eliot's Grail interpretation), pops up continually to provide psychosexual commentary on the action.
Will Persse ever manage to be in the same room with Angelica again? Which of the half-dozen contenders for the
UNESCO chair will snatch the prize? Everything comes to a
head at the MLA conference in New York, where all our aca-

demics are reunited and all their dark secrets revealed. The
denouement is a dizzying whirl of preposterous coincidence,
whichleaves the rightful king on his throne (sort of) and nearly
everyone else reeling. The exception is Persse, who, with the
stamina of the young, is off again immediately on the next
quest. Like every good romance, "Small World" ends with a
beginning: the Grail is always brighter when seen from far
away.

Major changes to baseball would ruin an American institution
BY ANDY KARR
Baseball. To even call it an
American institution is to wallow
in cliche. It's a part of all of us
Americans, whether we like it or
not. I would hesitate to change it
too much—it's really a great game
as is.
One usual complaint is that it
moves too slowly. I think this attitude stems from televised baseball,
which, though entertaining, is a
poor substitute for actually being
at the game. Nothing compares to
the atmosphere ofa baseball game.
I usually make a comparison
between soccer and boxing, my
two favorite sports, but baseball

can easily replace soccer in the
analysis. Baseball and boxing are
the two opposite ends of the sports
spectrum. First, boxing. What is
more simple, brutal, primal, essential to man than beating the crud
out ofanother guy? Even the timed

rounds, the gloves, and other elements that have been imple-

mented for the safety of the boxers (ha!) cannot take away from the
sport's basic character. It's the purest test of strength and endurance,
two essential elements in any

sport. Who will last longer, you or
him? Who will fall first? Who will lose
consciousness (consciousness is life)
first? It plays off the basic competitive

(and perhaps violent) nature of man,
and in our overly complicated contemporary society, such a return to
the basics is a very important form of
release and regression.
Now, contrast boxing with baseball. There is nothing simple about the
latter, nothing intuitive. The only basic similarity between the two is that
they are forms of regulated physical
competition. The contact permitted in
baseball is ancillary to the game,
whereas, in boxing, contact is the
point of the competition. The offense
does not even make direct contact
with or control the ball, as it does in
baseball or football. The defense has
the ball, and, when the bat makes contact with it and puts it into play, that
is a briefchange of possession and redirection of the ball and thus the entire focus ofplay. You hit the ball with
a stick, not a part of your body. You
catch the ball with a glove, not your
bare hand. You do not try to get the
ball into any sort of goal (except

maybe the bleachers in the outfield);
you just try to keep it away from the

defense while you run as far as you

can around the bases.
It involves a set of physical skills
more disparate than any other, even
football. Hitting is not at all like fielding, and neither is at all like intelligent base-running. Baseball is obviously highly strategic, and that goes
hand in hand with the slow pace of
the game. (Boxing is strategic, too, but
it is also more instinctual, less intellectual.) The game is not nearly as
simple or intuitive as many others. It
has no application to the world outside of the game, except for the overall physical strength its players may
acquire to better play the game. The
game is entirely constructed, separate
from the real world, yet still an essential part of it. That is how all the best
games are: a total escape from reality. For those hours on a summer afternoon, you escape whatever is going on in your lifeand enter the world
ofbaseball. Whereas boxing is escape
as regression, baseball is escape as
construction. It is not a move back to
a simpler time, but a move forward
into a more complex and richer human society, and it is perhaps one of
the greatest creations to come out of
the UnitedStates.
In case you can't tell, I really like
baseball. I like almost all sports, in

fact, which may surprise some of you
since about the only sport I play is
throwing things at people in Sharpies.
So I would be very hesitant to suggest
changes to such a storied institution.
I don't think the game needs to be
shortened in any way. To do so would
be to rob it of a major part of its es-

sence. When you watch a baseball
game, it's not just the game that is
slow. Time slows down in the world
of the game and those who watch it.
Things are more relaxed, and you can
be more relaxed. That is part of its
escapist charm.
If you think it moves too slowly, I
would venture to say you don'tunderstand the nature of the game. The only
changes I would suggest to make the
already great game more interesting
are the traditional changes that are
frequently made or suggested, such as
economically manipulating the game
in the back offices to make small markets more competitive; I should admit
that I'm a KC Royals fan. Changing
the ball so it can't be hit so far is another change. (This has been done frequently in the past, as have changes
to make the ball go farther. Contradiction? Hey, it's a complicated game.)
Over the past couple of seasons, ithas
seemed as if the home run would come

to dominate the game. Still, with
some of the pitching I've seen so
far this season, it may not be such
a shift in the game's center after
all. You still have to score runs to
win, and homers are only one way
to do that. The old philosophy of
getting the first guys on base so
your bigger hitters can bring then;
home still seems to be working.
Perhaps building bigger parks
would cut down on homers and

increase interest with more inside
the park hits. Probably more
triples, which I think are more
exciting than homers most of the
time. Some might argue that home

runs make the game more interesting, but if I wanted to watch a
home run derby, I'd just as soon
participate in one myself. Homers
are only one part of a very complex game.
I find baseball to be plenty interesting. The only changes I

would suggest are conservative
ones: economic restructuring so
small market teams are more competitive, changing the ball so homers don't dominate. It's a great
game as it is. If you're not a fan,
maybe you should check it out
again for the first time.

SariAltschuler 'Ol has definitely done
her duty in the box. The women's soccer captain has been a goalkeeper for the
team for the past four years.
"It's a great position because every
decision you make is instantaneous; you
never have that extra second to think and
decide what to do," she said. She also
plays attack wing for lacrosse and she
ran track her freshman year.
Altschuler started playing soccer in
the ninth grade and began playing goalie
when her team need a backup in the eleventh grade. "I used to be a gymnast, so I
didn't mind hitting the ground all the

time and I thought it would be really fun to
try." In fact, playing goalie is a family af-

fair
she has a younger brother, Daniel,
who plays for Amherst.
Altschuler appreciates the responsibility that her stationary location gives her.
"I've an opportunity to be of assistance to
our other players because I have the advantage of seeing the whole field so I can help
them with positioning."
In addition, she feels more immune from
the wrath of the referees than the other
players. "It's nice because you can get away
fouls
with a lot more than field players
you often, aldon't get called on

SARI

w

though when they do, they are much more

serious."
The uniqueness of her position is what
makes the game challenging and exciting
for Altschuler. "All the other players are
running around whereas when you're in
the box, it's not the same as being part of
the action," she said. "You have to be one
hundred percent aware despite the fact that
you're not one hundred percent physically
involved in the game."
It's a whole new game for Altschuler each
time she steps out onto thefield. "Every game
and every shot is different and you have to
make a different decision every time."

Different backgrounds, same job.
Same after game, these Swat goalies
serve as the last line of defense.

Mind the net

CHRIS MILLA
For Chris Milla 'O3 the goalkeeper for

the men's soccer team, soccer has formed
the background of life. He started playing
the sport when he was five.
"I grew up with soccer. We came to

school and during recess we'd play soccer.
We'd eat a quick lunch and spend the rest
of the time playing soccer and then we
played soccer after school and into the
evening." He stepped into the box when he
turned twelve. "I'm a goalie because I like
diving
it's really fun."
Milla, who is originally from Honduras,
lived in Taiwan for six years where he was
named Most Valued Goalie Under 18 in
Asia. When he was in tenth grade, he was
knocked unconscious for five minutes
while blocking the ball. He's not letting any
ofhis intensity slip at Swarthmore; he once
had 31 saves during a game here. However,
captain
he credits his defensive team

Cam MacDearmid 'O3, Ryan Neiheiser 'Ol,
Charles Withers 'O2, and Spencer Paine 'O4.
"Many a time, Charles has saved my
ass," he said. "I would run out of the
k
box to grab a ball and he would back
me up and cover for me."
Milla's pre-game ritual is

to love the posts. During one game, he was shot at five
times in rapid succession. He
blocked the first shot; the opposing team got the rebound, but the

1

ball bounced off the left post. The
second rebound bounced off the
right post and Milla blocked the
fourth ball. Finally, the fifth ball hit
the crossbarand went out ofbounds.
"Ever since then, I have been really

i

appreciative of the posts."
Although he's at home in the box,
Milla admits to feeling occasional frustration. "It's upsetting because I can't
help the team win, I can only tie a game,"
he said. "I feel helpless at times."
The one thing he never wants to upset
him is the pressure of playing on a college
team. "You just get so caught up with in how
many goals you saved each game or whatever and you justneed to take a breather and
remember what this game is really about. It's
supposed to befun—it's a game for kids."

Strong first-year players make
for a solid showing at tourney
BY BEN KEYS
The men's tennis team entered
last weekend's Tim Berman Memorial Tournament with the hopes of a
strong showing against tough Division I and II competitors. The Berman
annually serves as a preparation for
the Division 111 regional national
tournament, which happens two
weeks later.
This year's downsized Berman
featured Division I Delaware, Division II powerhouse Kutztown and
Division 111 Rochester. The tournament was formatted with five singles
flights and two doubles flights, or levels of competition, with Swarthmore
entering two singles players or two
doubles teams at each level.
Pete Schilla 'Ol and JohnThomas
'O2 finished second and third in the
tough-as-hell A-flight singles, the
highest level of competition, both
losing to the eventual winner, but
they teamed up in the doubles to take
out all the competition. Schilla and
Thomas rose above migraine headaches and partial blindness, respec-

tively, to defeat a tough Rochester doubles
team.
Thomas was impressed with the bold
leadership and aggressive play of his partner, senior captain Schilla. "He really rose
to the occasion against Division I caliber
competition and has been an animal out

there," he said.
The doublesteam ofSchilla and Thomas
will look to secure a top-ten finish in the
nation at the Division 111 regional national
tournament. The other A doubles team for
Swarthmore, consisting of Jayson Yost 'O3
and Scott Grant 'Ol, finished in fifth place
after a first-round heartbreaker.
In the B flight, Yost finished third, losing a hard-fought match to the B-winner,
while Justin Singer 'O3 battled a fever and
was forced to default in the backdraw and
save his strength for doubles. With the B
doubles success of Singer and Frank
Visciano 'O4, who pounded teams from all
three schools en route to the doubles championship, one can only ponder the dominance this pair will display in the spring
season. Joey Spadola 'O4 and Ben Rae 'O4
finished fifth in the B doubles.
The story of the C-flight singles was once
again first-year sensation Visciano. He

breezed to the title match and pulled off
an outstanding come-from-behind victory in the final. Grant finished third in
the C bracket after a big first-round win
against Division I Delaware.
D-flight and E-flight singles gave the
other freshmen on the team a chance to
strut their stuff. In the D singles Rae and
Aaron Rubin 'O4 tied for third place,
while in the E singles Spadola was the
runner-up and MikeNoreika 'O4 finished
third. Joseph Dickerson 'O4 lost a firstround match to the eventual winner in
a valiant effort. Ben Keys 'Ol also played
E flight. The doubles teams of Dickerson/
Noreika and Rubin/Keys battled hard in
the C doubles, but both pairs fell short
in their matches against the same Rochester opponents.
The horrible rains of the two-day
tournament made for long waits between
matches and adverse indoor playing conditions, but the team's post-tourney outlook is nothing but positive. "This is
definitely our best showing in the
Berman in recent history," said Thomas.
"We were solid throughout the lineup,
and this team can really do some damage at the regional nationals."

Supersub Pastor
sparks offensive drive
BY TED CHAN
Against Gwynedd Mercy College, Swarthmore
dominated throughout, but it wasn't until supersub
Kevin Pastor 'O4 entered the game that the Garnet
broke the score open.
Pastor, a midfielder playing in just his second collegiate game, came in and contributed a goal and an
assist in a scant 1:18 to lead the Garnet to a 3-0 victory.
"We finally saw our hard work pay off. I would
like to keep this momentum for the rest of the games,"

said Charles Withers 'O2.
Kent Bassett 'O4 played one of the strongest individual games of the season, scoring a goal in the
eighth minute. Taking a pass from tri-captain
Cameron MacDearmid 'O3, Bassett took advantage of
the Gwynedd Mercy goalkeeper being out of position
and tucked the first goal in the back of the net.
Pastor tallied again in the fifty-sixth minute, heading in a cross from Frank Sersale di Cerisano 'O2.
Justin Stanisky 'O3 also scored. In the second half,
he made a strong run, fending off several Gwynedd
Mercy defenders before booming a shot by the
goaltender. Pastor assisted on that tally.
"We were finally doing what we were supposed to
be doing
creating offensive chances," said Spencer Paine 'O4. "It was awesome to see."
Chris Milla 'O3 made six saves to earn his second
shutout of the season in goal.

The men's and women's cross country teams traveled to Lebanon Valley this past Saturday for the
annual quad meet with Allentown College,
Muhlenburg College, and host Lebanon Valley. The
cloudy, cool weather provided excellent conditions
for the scenic 5K and 8.5K races.
The women's team shined as it beat all three teams
with ease. Leading the way in the 5K race for the
Garnet Harriers was Jokotade Agunloye 'Ol, who won
with a time of 20:10. Agunloye enjoyed Lebanon
Valley's undulating terrain. "The rolling hills suited
my running style," she said.
The hills were also advantageous to the other
women runners, as Maria Elena Young 'O4 finished
fourth (21:04), Alissa Parmelee 'Ol finished seventh
(21:17), Christen Lungren 'O2 finishedninth (21:30) and
Tara Trout 'O4 finished seventeenth (21:58). This
marked the women Harriers' second consecutive win.
"We are heading in the right direction to do well in
the conference meet," said Coach Carroll, citing how
the team has improved. The conference meet is on
October 28.
The men's team lost a close race, but Marc Jeuland
'ol's first place finish in 27 minutes and eight sec-

onds was a highlight. Leading the rest of the men's
team were Joe Makin 'O3, who finished seventh
(28:11); Sam Evans 'Ol who finished eighth (28:39); Don
Nguyen 'O3, who finished eighteenth (30:12); and
Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol, who finished nineteenth
(30:17). Coach Carroll said that his training program
is designed for its runners to peak at the right times,
conferences and regionals, which will be held on
October 28 and November 14, respectively.
As the month of September comes to a close, the
men's and women's teams have an off week to recover from the month's training. Racing will resume
on October 7 at the Dickinson Invitational in Carlisle,
Penn. This course

will be the site for both the men's
and women's regional races and should prove to be a
preview of the rest of the season.

Ultimate teams see mixed
results at weekend tourneys
BY PAUL WULFSBERG
The ultimate frisbee fall season kicked off with the Earthworms playing two tournaments and the Warmothers staying in Swarthmore to prepare for sectionals. The Earthworms,
Swarthmore's men's team, divided their forces, sending their
veterans off on a fourteen-hour drive to Chicago for a massive national tournament and a younger, more rational squad
to nearby Lehigh on Saturday.
The nine men and one woman (Jenny Hoedeman '01) who
traveled to Chicago faced off mainly against club teams, emerging with a respectable 3-and-3 record. The Smart Whores, the
co-ed team, faced Carleton College of Northfield, Minnesota
as its only collegiate opponent. Carleton fell in a 13-3 blowout
before James Muspratt 'ol's legendarily long hucks and some
impressive swill throws from Misha Horowitz 'O3. As is common during the fall season, most of the teams at the tournament were "club" teams composed of experienced, hardcore
frisbee fanatics.
As the Smart Whores amused themselves in faraway Chicago, a second group of young Earthworms left for an important East Coast competition in Lehigh, Pennsylvania. The
men's team shocked regional powerhouse Susquehanna before finally succumbing to Rutgers, UPenn, Princeton, and
Haverford in fairly close games. Ben Hamilton 'O3 summarized the Earthworms' offensive mindset as "get it to [Dan]
Schwartz 'O2 and then watch it fly to Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 for a
score."
But the real story of the Lehigh tournament was the fresh-

men. Andrew Gregory 'O4, Andrew Rosskam 'O4 and David
Paideia 'O4 all turned in excellent days and got some good
experience playing all positions on the field against even
Susquehanna and Princeton. Gregory's perfectly controlled
forehands, Rosskam's outstanding speed and Paideia's tight
defense all contributed significantly to the Earthworms' solid
showing at Lehigh. Earthworm upperclassmen Charles Small
'O3, Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 and Ari Hauser 'Ol coached the younger
players in their transition from the friendly fields of Mertz
to the imposing chasm of Lehigh Valley.
The Warmothers, who finished last year ranked ninth
in the nation, did not have a tournament last weekend but
began official practices on Monday in preparation for the
fall sectionals the September 16 and 17. With nearly all of
their critical junior class abroad for this semester, the
Warmothers do not expect as easy a route through
sectionals and regionals as they are sure to enjoy in the
spring. Megan Moerke 'O3, one of a number of walk-onsfor
the Mothers this season, said, "I'm psyched for a great season, even though we're missing some of our strongest players this weekend [the juniors as well as senior leaders
Jenny Hoedeman and Lindsay Goldsmith]. Above all, the
fall season is about having fun."
Sophomore captain Alyssa Bell concurred, calling the attitude this fall "much more laid back than last season" and
encouraging any Swatties who like fun to come out and be
trained in the ways of the disc. Both the Warmothers and
Earthworms practice Tuesdays through Thursdays at 4:30 on
Mertz field and warmly welcome walk-ons.

THE
SWEET SPOT

BY TED CHAN
Two years ago, when the men's football team reached
the depths of its despair, hardly anyone noticed the
struggles of the volleyball players, who had slumped to a
winless season. But this season, with a strong core of upperclassmen, expertise delivered with enthusiasm from a
new pair of coaches, and a slew offresh faces, the Garnet
has risen from the ashes like the mythical phoenix.
With a recent three-game winning streak that consisted
of conference wins over Bryn Mawr (15-4, 15-7, 15-5) and
Washington College (15-8,15-10,15-12) in addition to a nonleague thumping of Cabrini (15-3, 15-3, and 15-8), the Garnet have started off5-7. The five wins are already one more
than they had last season in a 4-20 campaign, and they've
doubled last year's single win in Centennial Conference
play. Two years ago, the team was winless in 16 matches.
At that point, a .500 record in the conference seemed im-

Questionable
judgement
Am I the only person left dazed and confused
by the Patrick Ewing trade? In the final analysis,
neither the Knicks nor the Sonics improved their
nonexistent chances to win an NBA title in the

possible.

Now the team is on a roll, as new coaching and success

has brought a fresh attitude to the team.
"Practice is fun. We're excited about volleyball where
losing was wearing on us before," said middle blocker Lily
Marsh 'Ol, a tri-captain. "We've become more confident now
and we're no longer satisfied with losing."
The heart of the team is its senior tri-captains, consisting of Marsh, offside hitter Fran Smith and setter Bonnie
French. The three have stuck it out through the tough
times, and success is especially sweet for them.
"We have a great group and we're having fun. It was
really awesome to have three wins in a row," said Marsh.
In addition to the three seniors, underclassmen have
contributed significantly. Christine Hancock 'O2 has performed well, and Emma Benn 'O4 has stepped right in during her first season as middle blocker.
The sixth and final starter, 5'9" outside hitter Bryn
Rosenfeld 'O3, has really stepped it up this season, particu-

larly during the recent winning streak. Against Cabrini,
Rosenfeld had 10 kills, which followed a tremendous allAnastasia Kolendo around performance against Washington, where sherecorded two aces, five digs and seven kills.
Her efforts garnered her a spot on the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for the week.
The women are quick to credit their new coaches for the
team's rapid improvement. They say Chang Han and Elvin
Ottley have brought experience, expertise and enthusiasm
to the team. "Chang lives and breathes volleyball, and his
enthusiasm rubs off on us," said Marsh.
Han was a setter at Villanova and has worked all over
the country, including contributing to the national team.
Meanwhile, Ottley was a hitter during 'OL Hitting and
setting in volleyball are two vastly different skills, and
having coaches to specialize in each is a tremendous
asset.
"Having a hitter and a setter to work with us at each

position really helps," said Marsh.
Also important are the goals the coaches and team have set
together. The team hopes to continue on its exponential growth
curve and finish in the top four in the conference, allowing it to
move on to the playoffs. At the rate at which it is improving, that
is certainly not out of the question.
"Our coaches have really high expectations for this season,

The next step for the team will be games against Muhlenberg
and Hopkins this weekend and the Seven Sisters Tournament at
Smith College the weekend after that. For the first time in awhile,
the team feels it can be competitive, and it's a feeling it has every
time it goes out. The best part for the Garnet is that it's only
going to get better from here. Said Marsh, "We have big hopes
for the future of this program."

Despite accumulating 347 yards in of-

getting into the end zone, failing to convert long drives into touchdowns and
turning the ball over three times. Although Castellucci's threefield goals and
Andres' fake punt magic were enough to
top Gettysburg, Alvanos admitted the offense could have put more points on the
scoreboard.
"The score could have been more lopsided in our favor," Alvanos said. "We still

near future.
The Sonics have teamed up Ewing and Baker to
create the slowest front line in the history of the
game, and they fortified the forward position of
their divisional rival Lakers. The Knicks, who have
had huge rebounding problems the past two
years, face more of a rebounding challenge this
year against the new-look Heat. Ingeniously, the
Knicks dumped Ewing, a sure ten rebounds per
game, and tough guy Chris Dudley, who isn't
exactly known for his offensive presence. In
return, they received Luc Longley and Travis
Knight, who average a combined 6.5 rebounds per
game.
If the Knicks are lucky, though, Glen Rice will do
exactly what he has done his entire career: not
rebound and not play defense. If the Sonics are
lucky, Ewing will turn away critically ill and
disadvantaged Seattle children who ask him for
autographs on game days (yes, he did this in New
York). But enough about recent examples of idiocy
in sports; let's move on to more irrelevant ones.
(Ground rules: I will not discuss any lockouts or
strikes, such as those which plagued professional
football, basketball, baseball, and hockey in the
past 20 years.)
The NFL's decision to grant an expansion team
to Houston should be at the top of anyone's list of
sports blunders.
Sure, the new owner promised state-of-the-art
facilities for the new team, creatively nicknamed
the "Texans," but Houston does not exactly have a
reputation of supporting franchises. Does anyone
remember when only 30 people showed up for
Houston's "Keep the Oilers" rally? I'm sure the
NFL owners did, but the prospect of splitting
Houston's $7OO million dollar expansion fee
between them was much more enticing—so
enticing that the vote to accept Houston's bid was
29 for, 0 against, and 2 abstentions. Sure, Los
Angeles failed to promise a brand-new stadium,
but as the nation's second-biggest television
market, they could certainly muster more fan
support for an NFL franchise than Houston could.
People in L.A. even go to Clippers games. I
suppose a football team will eventually move
there. Perhaps Al Davis could keep the Raiders in
a state of perpetual oscillation between L.A. and
Oakland...
Insert weekly shot at the Montreal Expos here.
At least the NBA isn't as pig-headed as the NFL
or MLB (I don't need to rant and rave about
baseball's lack of a salary cap now, do I?).
Remember when the NBA considered expanding
to Mexico City? I was thankful when issue quickly
faded away, but now I'm reconsidering. I think the
distribution of sports franchises is a bit lopsided in
L.A. Two basketball teams and no football teams?
Why don't we move the Clippers to Mexico City to
make room for an NFL franchise? Maybe Maurice
Taylor would be more willing to resign with the Clip
if he could make a home for himself in Mexico.
After all, since Vancouver attracts so many star
players, why wouldn't Mexico City? Err...
nevermind.

A strong challenge

Olympic coverage
too sappy, cultural
Don't get me wrong. I think interpretative dance is
wonderful and majestic, but when I turn on the tube
during primetime to watch the Olympics, I want to
see people playing goddamn sports.
For those who didn't notice, NBC showed almost
two hours of cultural dance and festivities early in the
week in the middle of prime time, including a
seemingly endless pseudo-Peter Pan little-girl-at-thebottom-of-the-ocean piece. I kept flipping back and
forth between that and "Dumb and Dumber" on Fox's
"Comedy Olympics" (I only get Fox and NBC in my
dorm room), hoping they would soon show two
people beating the sin out of each other, but the
fluttering cloth jellyfish never relented.
Look, don't get me wrong I know the Olympics
are a spectacle, and part of that is local culture and
flavor, and it's fine that that's included. But it's
almost as if the human interest stories and
interpretive dance have overtaken the actual
competition.

THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE OLYMPICS
IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONLY NON-SWIMMING SPORT NBC SHOWED WAS ALONZO
MOURNING DUNKING OVER A 2'B" POWER
FORWARD FROM EAST TURKMENISTAN IN

The first three days of the Olympics it seemed like
the only non-swimming sport NBC showed was
Alonzo Mourning dunking over a 2'B" "power"
forward from East Turkmenistan in a 158-14 Team
USA win. Everything else was politics, drugs or some
sort of redemption for being slow as hell four years
ago.
Here's one thing I've been hearing: the Olympics
coverage is geared towards what NBC thinks women
want to see. They figure the men will tune in
anyways. I don't know if I buy it all the way, but there
sure are a lot of gymnastics, swimming and human
interest stories. And I don't see very much wrestling,
boxing, judo and baseball, which just about every guy
I've talked to wants to see more of.
I mean, those who follow wrestling and baseball
really carefully know just how exciting those events
have been for Americans thusfar. There was Garrett
Lowney, a 20-year-old, throwing a several-time world
champion in a Rocky-like upset, and the ragtag
American baseball team winning a bunch of wild
games, including one where they almost rumbled
with Fidel's Commies from Cuba.
If Disney/ESPN/ABC/SuperOmniCorp had the
Olympics, you would see coverage on ESPN, ESPN2,
ESPN69, etc. NBC has just as many connections,
and the Olympics are such huge business, they
should be on multiple channels. Even if you want to
call the events I'd like to watch "secondary" events,
wouldn't they be more worth watching than beach
rollerhockey on ESPN2? (They really show it).
My point? Well, it's pretty simple. Either cut the
culture and cover the events, or get a second
network to cover the stuff so I can see my fair share
of Americans beating the brains out of a red commie
devil.
Note: This article attempts to reassert my
masculinity, which was clearly ravaged on page 12.

Garnet Tide defeats Gettysburg
to record first conference win
15-10 victory breaks Swarthmore's 31-game
Centennial Conference losing streak, gives
team winning record after three games
BY JUSTIN KANE
Sometimes a little sleight of hand makes a big difference.
Down 10-3 in the second quarter to a Gettysburg team looking for its first win this season, Swarthmore found itself facing a short fourth down near midfield. A week earlier,
Swarthmore lost what little momentum it had against Johns
Hopkins when it failed to convert an early fourth down. This
week, it seemed, the Garnet Tide would play it safe.
On came the punting squad. Moments later, wide receiver
Rich Andres 'O3 was racing down the field 51 yards after catching a throw from punter Jared Passmore 'O4 for a touchdown
that brought Swarthmore within a point and completely
changed the direction of the game.

With the addition ofthe second of three field goals from
Rob Castellucci 'Ol later in the quarter, the Garnet Tide
went to the locker room on top 12-10, a lead the team would
not relinquish for the rest of the game.
"We found ourselves in a hole to start the game, but we
didn't throw the towel in early," said head coach Pete
Alvanos, who got hisfirst Centennial Conference win since
coming on as coach in 1998. "We just inched back in, slowly
but surely. We had worked on that punt all week, and the
punt team executed the play exactly as we had drawn it
up."

Alvanos had noticed that opponents hadn't been ac-

counting for Andres' position in the punting scheme, so
the coaches had designed a fake punt to take advantage of
the lax defense as well as the quarterback background of
Passmore, who started at the position in high school.
"That play made a huge difference," Alvanos said. "It
