In recent years, television has been

'Dash for Cash' ends due to concerns about nudity

swarthmorephoenix.com

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

For many years, rugby
players from the men's and

women's teams have run
naked through the first floor
of Parrish Hall at the biannual fundraiser called "The
Dash for Cash."
At separate intervals, members of the women's and men's
teams would run naked across
the first floor of Parrish as
onlookers held out money to
support the teams. Dash for
Cash was held once in the fall
and once during Family
Weekend.
Yet this year, Family
Weekend passed without any
public nudity, and the only
hint of Dash for Cash was an
unrelated event of the same
name in the Mr. Swarthmore
competition, where the participants were fully clothed.
The indefinite cancellation
of Dash for Cash came out of
the deans' disapproval of pubMyrt

lic
Westphal, associate dean for
student life.
"We just want the whole
campus to know that being
naked in public is like underage drinking. It's against the
law, and you can get in trouble," Westphal said. "You can
be put on a sex offenders list
and some terrible things can
happen."
Westphal said the decision
for the cancellation and a ban
on alcohol for three semesters
for all rugby events arose
after members of the men's
rugby team went streaking

around campus after a banquet last fall.
"They just had a wild and
crazy night after their banquet, and they just really disrupted the library and the
dorms. And there were concerns about how they disturbed people's sense of safety," Westphal said.
Even though Dash for Cash
was not what precipitated the
troubles, Acting Dean of
Students Garikai Campbell '9O
said that allowing it to happen
makes students think that
nudity is allowed in other
instances.

"Because being nude in the

behaviors. One way was to

ment. All contacted members
and a captain of the women's
team declined to be interviewed, but social coordinator
Elizabeth Hamilton 12 replied
with a statement from the
team in an e-mail.
The email said that Dash
for Cash was different from
streaking since it is based on
trust, not surprise. The e-mail
said that the women's team
was disappointed that it was
not involved in conversations
regarding the event's cancellation and were not informed
of the cancellation until the
team asked the deans.
"For the women's rugby
team, Dash for Cash was
always a celebration of that
trust. It was a bi-annual
reminder that we live in a
community where we can feel
safe appearing naked in public, and where our fellow
members of the community
could feel comfortable showing up for this event," the email said.
While the e-mail said that
the loss of trust within the college community has made it
necessary for Dash for Cash to
end, it also noted that the
team will have to find other
ways to raise money. Since
the women's rugby team is a
club team, it does not receive
the same money that a varsity
team does.
"For Dash for Cash to be
successful, it must be an event
that the entire community
would like to sustain, whether
or not they choose to dash
themselves or even to attend.
The women's rugby team
acknowledges that the time
has come for Dash for Cash to
end," the e-mail said.
Although it was only the
men's team who caused the
disruptions last semester,
Westphal said that because
drinking and nudity can
sometimes be part of the
rugby culture, the bans on
alcohol were put into place for
both the men's and the
women's rugby teams.
Assistant Dean and Gender
Education Advisor Karen
Henry 'B7 said that public
nudity on campus is especially offensive for survivors of
sexual assault on campus.
"Anytime we have an event
such as a Dash for Cash or
other instances in dorms
where there have been naked
people, there's always been a
concern for survivors on campus who feel really unsafe,"
Henry said.
Ally Grein 'lO, a facilitator
for Swat Survivors and a former rugby team member, said
that while Dash for Cash is
not as scary for survivors
because they are forewarned,
unplanned streaking could be
especially frightening for sur-

"As a facilitator of Swat
Survivors, I've had numerous
occasions of people complaining about the rugby team and
their nudity in their drunken
debauchery," Grein said. "I
know they don't mean to make
people scared but the result is
that they scare people and put
people in a lot of pain."
Grein said that seeing people in the nude can be traumatizing for survivors, and
unplanned streaking, especially common amongst the
men's rugby team, is even
worse since it is unavoidable.
"The men's rugby team, in
recent years, has had a history of getting naked, streaking
on the halls of dorms, jingling
door knobs and occasionally
vandalizing hallways," Grein
said.
"That really just creates an
unsafe environment and it's
hard because you live in the
dorm, and they go all across
the campus, and you don't
know when they're coming
into your dorm."
Campbell, however, said
that the problem was not simply with the rugby team or
any other groups on campus.

"This is a community-wide
reporting that we've gotten
[about streaking]. It's prob-

lematic in a space where you
ought to feel safe and comfortable," Campbell said.
Campbell also said the discouragement of Dash for Cash
by the deans rose more from a
concern for the safety of students,"especially with the discovery of an off-campus man
taking pictures of Dash for
Cash last semester.
"Last year was the first
time I heard of a person on
campus, a man that no one
"taking
pictures,"
knew,
Campbell said. "We owe it to
our students to protect them
that way from some outside
person doing we don't know
what with those pictures."
When asked why Dash for
Cash has been allowed to happen for so long and is only
now being ended, Campbell
said that Dash for Cash has
been a long tradition, and
there was never a reason to
end it before.
"It has a long tradition of
existing before any of us
here," Campbell said. "Like
many traditions, there period...

ically needs to be looking
back."
Westphal also said that the
deans expect students to act as
adults and will punish them
only when problems rise.
"We can't deal with everything all the time, so you kind
of have to pick and choose
your battles," Westphal said.
"We're not a police state, we
can't get around and poke our
noses in everything."

Campbell said. "Right now,

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS

Poll on campus issues proves inconclusive
After the work study and
breakfast poll closed at 4 p.m.
on Tuesday, Student Council
convened for an emergency
meeting to discuss the results.
According to an e-mail to
the student body from Vice
President Deivid Rojas 'll, survey results regarding StuCo
payment were close, and the
data proved inconclusive.
The question will be posed
to students again as a referendum on the upcoming ballot.
The issue of offering breakfast on Sundays was largely
supported in the survey. StuCo
plans to talk with the Dining
Services Committee about
these results, Rojas said in the
e-mail.

Bike Share
The Bike Share program
will be up and running by this
weekend or at the beginning of
next week.
"The locks that were donated to us are combinationlocks,
this complicates the 'checking
out' bike process," Rojas said
in an e-mail. "We are looking
into getting key locks instead."
McCabe, which will be handling the checkout system, is

Activist seeks to make history, spearhead change

BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

While canvassing through
the city of Chester, Tina
Johnson met a woman struggling to get state support and
funding to build a safe haven
for homeless women. When
Johnson told her that she
would offer her support if elected into the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives, the woman
responded, "I have been waiting for you."
Johnson is trying to secure a
seat in the Pennsylvania House
Representatives
of
159th
District in Delaware County in
the first contested Democratic
primary race ever held in the
District.
Johnson will be challenging
incumbent Thaddeus Kirkland,
a Democrat who has served as
state representative in the
159th district for 18 years.
Although Johnson does not
have political experience, she
said that, as an activist in
Chester, she is ready to help an
area that is frequently ignored
by politicians.
"I decided that I was sick of
complaining about the things
that were wrong and I was
either going to be quiet about
that or to do something.
I'm
not one to be quiet," Johnson
said. "If you want something to
change, you have to change the
winds, you have to change the
political conversation."
...

Swarthmore involvement
On campus, Johnson's relationships with several students
and faculty have helped her
campaign get off the ground.
Many of these relationships at
college have been formed out of
the Chester's Community
Grocery Co-op, a community
owned and operated grocery
store that Johnson spearheaded five years ago.
Right
after
Johnson
announced her candidacy earlier this year, she reached out
to Alice Evans 'lO, who worked
with her last summer through
the Lang Center at the Chester
Co-op.

"She called me to see if she
could meet with me to talk
about using Swarthmore students as a resource in campaigning," Evans said. "She
doesn't have a huge treasury
and doesn't have a whole lot of
existing political backing and
so she's really using a lot ofher
personal connections and connections she's made through
her previous work with the Co...

op."

For the Community-Based
Learning component of professor of religion Mark Wallace's
Religion and Ecology class,

Evans and others will have a
booth this Sunday at the
Swarthmore Charity Fun Fair
to raise money for the Co-op.
Associate professor of political science Keith Reeves has

Mr. 'SmIley and Bubbly
BY DINA

ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday night, at the Mr.

Swarthmore competition, Omari
Faakye 10 took to the runway
smiling shyly and dressed in a

traditional white Ghanaian
dress. By the conclusion of the.
two-hour pageant hosted by the
Ladies' Soiree Society (LaSS),
Faakye was chosen as Mr.
Swarthmore 2010 from among 10
other competitors.

His arrival at Swarthmore as
a first-year for soccer pre-season
in 2006 was only his second visit
to the United States. Looking
back, Faakye explained that it
was the "best way to welcome
[himself] into the Swarthmore
community."
"They taught me about how to
approach the Swarthmore society
being able to carry yourself as

a confident person here," Faakye
said of his teammates. "[They
also taught me] about being able
to relate to people despite the fact
that they are so different from
you because we are all so differ-

ent."

Faakye, after two years of
resisting participation in Mr.
Swarthmore, agreed to it this
year when he recognized the
importance of promoting organi-

zations. He represented both the
men's soccer team and the
Christian
Swarthmore
Fellowship (SCF), both of which
he has participated in since his
first year.
"Those two groups have really
defined my existence here. They
define my lifestyle and that's why
I'm really committed to both of
them," Faakye said.
Earlier in the fall semester,
when the soccer team lost to
Transylvania University in the
final game of the season, Faakye
remembers returning to his dorm
in tears. He realized his response
demonstrated the deep connections he had with his teammates.
"It was an intense moment for

me and it all made so much sense

[as to] why I sacrificed so much
time for practice. It was my love
for the team," Faakye said.
Faakye felt inspired by the Mr.

only after attending the reading, commented on the
differences in reading and listening to Kuipers'
poetry.
"[S]he feels to me like a really solid presence,
like she herself she has just a gorgeous voice and

Outsmarting crooks has never been so funny
BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT
qgounotl@swarthmore.edu
Around this time of year, as papers pile
up and exams loom close, we Swatties are
in dire need of entertainment. As this
weekend's performance of "The Butter and
Egg Man" showed, our peers are excellent
at providing us this fun break.
Although set in the 19205, "The Butter
and Egg Man" successfully immerses the
audience in its environment: the corrupt
and hectic milieu of show business. This

play was likely one of the inspirations for

„

the famous musical "The Producers."
When Peter Jones, played by Harry
Apostoleris 'l2, a sweet and naive boy from
Ohio, comes to New York self-consciously
bearing a large inheritance, he finds himself caught in the rapid traffic of a language that he does not speak: the language
of show biz
and of money. It does not
take much convincing for him to invest the
bulk of his assets in a play produced by a
certain Joe Lehman, played by Avilash
Pahi 13. But Lehman turns out to be a
shameless crook who is not nearly as sure
of the play he is presenting to Jones as he
claims to be. Jones soon risks losing both
the funds and the trust that he had invested into the project.
This familiar tale of the outsider being

duped by the city men comes as no sur-

prise.

The

interesting twist

comes when

the plays turns out to be unexpectedly successful, with Jones having obtained the
controlling share. He is finally in a position to give the former producers a taste of
their own medicine.
The play's wacky cast of characters
gives it all its comedic brillianc, and the
actors breathed new life into recognizable

types and made each character into an
original creation. Pahi, with his booming
voice and mysterious hat, was great in the
role of the crook, Lehman. His animation
when selling his play generated an energy

completely
waned.
that
never
Apostoleris's candor shone in his sympathetic portrayal of Jones. Elizabeth Keck
'l3 was the grandiose femme fatale Mary
Martin, shining with glitter and overdramatic in her every gesture. Zack Wiener
'l2 put his linguistics training to good use,
enunciating his words just as a pretentious
British director would. Every single actor
demonstrated an ability to take his or her
character completely over the top, winning the audience's laughter and apprecia-

tion.

Assistant Director Will Treece 11 was
in charge of the not-so-small feat of "keeping things light and funny." As a purely
comedic play, "The Butter and Egg Man"
was very different from "Outrage," the
play Treece helped direct in the fall. Treece
enjoyed this new challenge.
"It's a lot of acting concepts and seeing

them through comedic lenses," he said.
Commenting on the humor of the play,
Treece added that he thinks that it is mainly a "big character play."
"All the characters are just ridiculous.
It's all about throwing them into the same
room and seeing what happens," Treece

said.

Much of the comic effect here, he
explained, was based on people failing to
match the expectations others have for
them. For example, the producers expect
Jones to be a complete idiot, but he eventually outsmarts them.
While the play's humor definitely has
much appeal, director Anne Coleman 10
saw much more to "The Butter and Egg
Man" than mere entertainment. For her, it
was an invaluable opportunity to showcase the work of playwright George
Kaufman. This particular play was an
especially interesting choice, because it is
the only one that Kaufman wrote without a

collaborator.

Coleman pointed out that "The Butter
and Egg Man" bears many parallels to
Kaufman's life. The character of the literary agent is an echo of the many people
who plagued Kaufman's career with plagiarism accusations. Coleman also interpreted Kaufman's humor as a response to
those people around him. Kaufman had
entertained a somewhat dysfunctional
relationship with a prestigious circle of

New York intellectuals, who constantly
sought to impress, outstrip and tease each
other. Coleman saw Kaufman's use of oneliners as well as his characters as inspired
by that relationship.
"He loved looking around him and
turning people into material. His friends
knew who they were in his scripts. It was
all about how to insult each other within a
circle of friends," Coleman said.
Members of the cast seem to have
enjoyed making the play, thanks in part to
Treece and Coleman. Aside from playing
acting games, the cast found the directors'
knowledge of theory to be impressive and
helpful.
"This must be a Swarthmore thing, but
I'd never unpacked things that much
before, like comedy and what is funny,"

Keck said.
Keck felt challenged by the pervasive
physicality of her role, but relished the
opportunity to try out a character quite
different from the villains and musical
characters she played in high school.
"You have to make [your character]

human. I understand what [Mary Martin]
wants," she said. "It might seem vapid and
shallow to me, but I can see where she is
coming from."

"The Butter and Egg Man" offered a
powerful glimpse into the 1920s world of
show business and into Kaufman's own
relationship

with other intellectuals.

From: Auburn, AL
Current Residence: Roberts
What She's Wearing:
"My leggings are from the Gap. My gray shirt is from

that's the way I like it fitting," Zhuang said. She layered
two tank dresses: one from Zara and the other Alexander
Wang. "My jacket is from Alexander McQueen, the McQ
line," Zhuang said. Her black boots are from Behind the
Glass, a boutique in Auburn owned by her friend's mother. Her necklace is from Zachary's Smile and she bought
her bright lime green watch in China. Her leather carryall bag is from a thrift store.
While her big, black, wide-rimmed glasses may be a
distinguishing factor in many of her outfits, Zhuang's
beloved McQ sweater catches the eye instantly. Black and
white stripes are mixed with a bold zigzag and oversized
diamond pattern in true Alexander McQueen style. It
takes the traditional, oversized sweater and amps it up
with the bold print. The smooth transition from each
design makes for quite a dynamic piece.
How She Describes Her Style:
"Classic but quirky," Zhuang said an email. "I like
things that have some sort of tradition to them, but a
unique take on things, whether if s like an unexpected fabsomething that stands out
ric or a different seaming
and has a bit of spark to it." In reference to her style,
Zhuang feels that it's "flexible and fluid."
...

Fashion Influences & Inspirations:
"What guides me is I just pay attention to small
details," Zhuang said. "I also really like good fabrics." She
also enjoys taking inspiration from all over, whether it's a
unique lighting fixture to a look in a magazine. "I think
it's really cool that you can apply that in your style."
Zhuang also feels her interests in fashion began when
she took art lessons at age seven. In her e-mail, Zhuang
also said that her "near-obsession" with fashion was
inspired by her first purchase of Vogue magazine.
...

Where She Shops:
"I shop everywhere and anywhere," Zhuang said. Her
shopping haunts ranges from discount shopping at
Loehmann's or thrift stores, to buying basics at stores like

Gap, J.Crew and Zara, or finding
items at higher end stores. "I really
like small, well-curated boutiques
because I like to see the vision and
the different style that each one has,"
she said. Zhuang, like many others,
relishes in finding good bargains, but
she looks for clothes that aren't too
trendy. "What I look for [are] things

& Blogs She Follows:
"I've been into different designers
since I was really young, but now with
blogs and stuff, it's easier to see how they
apply to real life or carry it from the runway [into] reality," Zhuang said. Among
some of her favorite designers are Rick
Owns, Ann Demeulemeester, Jil Sander,
Karl Lagerfield, Alexander McQueen, Rag &
Bone and Givenchy. Zhuang gravitates

toward "forward-thinking European designers" as well as up-and-coming designers like
Joseph Altuzarra 'O5 or Rodarte. Her favorite
blog is Jak and Jil.

Favorite Items in Closet:

Zhuang loves her McQ sweater as well as
her Earnest Sewn jeans, a J.Crew blazer, silk
scarves with abstract designs that she found for
.99 cents and a Vince jumpsuit. "The things that
I like in my closet always have some sort of story
to them," she said. "I can tell you where I got all
my clothes and the circumstances behind that."

Wardrobe Staples:
"I have tons of jackets and I never have the
opportunity to wear them," Zhuang said, but she
loves the look of a well-fitted blazer. She also tends
to combine "simple tank tops in drapey fabrics" with a
jacket, her Earnest Sewn jeans and sandals. "I usually
wear sandals, but sometimes I break out the occasional
loafers or boat shoes." Zhuang also loves the effortlessnes
and easiness of a "black cotton dress with a scarf
draped over my shoulders."

Students' book collections garner prestigious prize
ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Considered the oldest book collecting competition in
the United States, the A. Edward Newton Book
Collection Competition rewards those Swarthmore students with the best, most creative and most stimulating
book collections. The competition started in 1930, when a
Swarthmore professor, Robert E. Spiller, introduced his
class to Newton, an avid book collector. According to the
Swarthmore website, Newton liked a student's idea of
awarding a prize to the student with the best book collection and began funding the competition.
This year's first place winner is Meredith Firetog 'lO
for her collection titled "Tangled in Bob Dylan." Second
place went to Myles Dakan 'lO for his collection called
"Notes Almost Divine: American Shape Hymnody."
Third place went to Ben Goossen 13 for his collection
named "A History of the Future: A Literary Evolution of
Science Fiction." A talk and reception will be held today
at 4:30 p.m. in the McCabe Reading Room to honor the
winners.
Meredith Firetog 'lO
Isaac Han: What was the inspiration for your book collection?
Meredith Firetog: Bob Dylan.
IH: How did you collect the books in your collection?
Was it a long process?
MF: I actually started collecting the books
about
five years ago when I took a class on Dylan and the collection was inadvertently created. I would just go to a
bookstore and go to the music collection and be drawn to
all the books about Dylan, by Dylan or somehow tangentially related to Bob Dylan. And gradually I realized I
was collecting quite a number of books about this one
...

topic.
IH: Are there any books in the collection that you find
most interesting or special in your collection?
MF: Well, in terms of books about Dylan's career and
Dylan as a cultural icon, I think Greil Marcus's "Like a
Rolling Stone: Bob Dylan at the Crossroads" is one of my
favorite books. Greil Marcus is this awesome rock journalist and it's this book that traces the recording of the
song "Like a Rolling Stone" and kind of traces the cultural milieu of the '6os. Another really cool book that is
actually one of the more recent books I got is "Bob Dylan
Revisited" and it's a book that has 16 graphic artists who
did graphic novel representations of Dylan's songs and
it's really beautiful.
IH: Do you think your collection reflects your personality in some way?
MF: In as much as your car reflects your personality.
But, I think what you mean or what you're getting at is

what you can see from my collection is that I have something that I'm passionate about and I have a very emotionaland aesthetic attachment to, and at the same time
have an intellectual attachment to which is obvious in
its literary counterpart. A lot of the books are criticisms
of Dylan's writing as poetry. So a lot of it is literary criticism or looking at how the Bible works in Dylan's
books. So it also shows my love for academia at the same
time how I'm integrating my emotional and aesthetic
passion into my intellectual passions.
IH: What can you say about book collecting as a hobby?
MF: I guess I didn't really consider book collecting as
a hobby until really coming across this competition and
realizing how established the contest is and how a lot of
people do collect books for very specific themes. And at
first it was like, 'I have a lot of books about Dylan,' and
now I think that I am much more focused on where I
want expand my collection. For example I want to
expand to include influences of Dylan and what he got
from Hank Williams and Lead Belly and the other artists
from the '3os, who really influenced his style in the 'sos,
'6os and '7os or mainly 'sos and '6os. I wouldn't really
count the stuff from when he was in high school. So I
think as a hobby it's something that I'm excited to be a
part of as I expand my collection.

Ben Goossen 'l3
IH: What was the inspiration for your book collection?
Ben Goossen: The specific collection is about the literary evolution of science fiction. And I'm inspired to
look into science fiction books because I'm interested in

Barbie's legacy: female beauty ideals overextended
swarthmorephoenix.com

Barbie dolls. Plastic
surgery. The Plastics from
"Mean Girls." Over the
past 50 years, give or take,
the metaphor of an idealized female body as "plastic" has become ingrained
as part of society's popular
vocabulary, and the examples of this effect are endless.
When
women's
appearances are either literally too fake, through
Emily Crawford
plastic surgery, or when
Into the Abyss
they simply present themselves in a too perfect way,
they get called fake and
plastic, like doUs. I'll admit that I am fully complicit in
this system; many a time have I fallen too easily into the
habit of calling someone who wears too much makeup a
"doll-girl" or "doll-face." But where do we draw the line?
At what point does criticizing varying levels of altering
one's appearance, ranging from a flick of mascara to fullon invasive surgery, become misogynistic rather than
productive?
A prime example of this cultural trend is Heidi
Montag, of (debatable) reality show fame from the MTV
show "The Hills," which is currently airing its sixth and
final season. I'm unclear about what Montag actually
does, but for whatever reason she is still floating around
in celebrity world, and has recently come out with a
brand-spanking new, surgically enhanced body.
Literally, I mean her whole body. In the way that some
women might talk about have their nose or boobs "done,"
Montag had everything done. My only real source of
information about this has been through such reputable
news sources as "Gawker" and their feminist offshoot
blog "Jezebel," but seeing .one before-and-after picture
really gives "you all the information that you need. The
girl no longer looks human, to put it bluntly. Somewhat
understandably, the media buzz around her aUeged 10

Montag has been particularly vocal about the benefits of
plastic surgery. Unlike most stars, who tend to deny that

she has actively announced and discussed the procedures she underwent and the insecurities that drove her
to select them. To be fair, there's no way that Montag
could have denied her surgeries, given that she looks
like a completely different person now.
Not surprisingly, Montag has received a lot of criticism for undergoing such invasive procedures at such a
young age, particularly to such extremes. Her methods
were also extreme. She underwent extensive liposuction,

to society's unattainable and unhealthy beauty standards, except for the fact that I don't think anyone was
ever calling Heidi fat. Not to mention the fact that she
also had fat injected in various other body parts, including her cheeks, of all places. No, Heidi Montag wasn't
trying to emulate skeletal fashion models or even largebreasted porn stars, although elements of both are present. Rather, her goal seems to have literally been to
reshape her whole body into an inhuman form, closest to
the original "plastic": Barbie.
You know how you read all those reports about how if
Barbie were a real person, she'd be eight feet tall and
wouldn't be able to stand upright? Well, Montag appears
to be approaching such distortions. She reportedly is no
longer able to go jogging because of her surgeries, a side
effect for which many of the aforementioned blogs have
mocked her. But at what point does such mockery
become offensive, even anti-feminist? OK, Montag is
clearly delusional about what is aesthetically pleasing, a
practical use of money or advisable under any circumstances. She is setting a bad example, her priorities are
terrifyingly skewed and she probably has some form of a
psychological disorder at this point. But rather than
laughable, isn't ah of that just saddening? After all, isn't
she really just a product of her environment? Sure, by
normal standards Montag already fit the stereotypical
definition of beauty: thin, big boobs, long blonde hair,
etc. One might argue she wasn't really conforming to a
common ideal, but rather a delusional and disproportionate one. But really, all she has done is taken ideas
that are already floating around in our culture and
extrapolated on them. For instance, we all know the

scene from "Mean Girls" in which Regina George and
company all criticize their objectively attractive appearances in front of a mirror. Well, all Heidi has done is
taken that idea and acted upon it. She grew up in a society, as we all have, in which we are increasingly told that
even the most stereotypically "attractive" of us should
still find fault with our bodies; that plastic surgery is ok,
almost a "natural" course to take for those who can
afford it; that the appropriate way of dealing with insecurities or an ugly-duckling syndrome is to undergo a
makeover, rather than accept our flaws, real or imagined.
In short, what Montag has done is taken all these messages projected by society and literalized them. Sure, we
can criticize her for being too susceptible to such things,
but much of the mockery that the media has subjected
her to goes past that. There has been a "dumb blonde,"
"human Barbie," plastic-y rhetoric surrounding her new
body that has a decidedly gender-based tone to it. After
all, she was subjected to society's expectation of self-criticism and acceptance of elective surgery precisely
because she is a woman in the entertainment industry.
That's not say that men don't receive plastic surgery as
well (anyone else remember the calf-implant craze of a
few years ago?), but it remains a far less acceptable
option for male-identifiers. After all, Montag's husband
Spencer Pratt may be an idiot who gets mocked all the
time too, but not for his appearance and he has not felt
compelled to undergo any surgery (yet).
A desire to defend Heidi Montag's psychotic actions,
which I would at the very least put in the same ballpark

as severe self-mutilation, has been furthest from my
mind in this column. But rather than criticism and
mockery, I think pity is a more apropos reaction to her
behavior. Or at the very least, we might strive for criticism on the basis of the disturbing social messages that
she is enacting. After all, I played with Barbie dolls. We
*all did, with the exception of some individuals who probably had both very intelligent parents and very stunted
childhoods. So before mocking a woman for playing into
society's superficial Barbie-doll stereotypes and ideals, I
suggest that we consider whatrole we have taken in creating the conditions that aUow the Heidi Montags of the
world to exist.

Thanks, HBO, for a glorious new era of television
I've spent
the past few
weeks
extremely

excitedfor the

of

the new HBO
show "Treme"
(pronounced

of the writing

of

this col-

worry; I'll review it in the coming weeks.)

"Treme" is creator David Simon's follow
up to the breathtaking "The Wire," a
sprawling series that spent five stellar
seasons chronicling crime and corruption
in Baltimore, and which many critics
(myself included) have dubbed the best
show in the history of television.
Simon's hotly anticipated return to
HBO got me thinking about the range of
incredible television the network has produced everything from the cosmo-andManolo-obsessed "Sex and the City," to the
soapy vampire drama "True Blood," to the
critically acclaimed "The Sopranos," not
to mention "John Adams," "Entourage,"

"Oz," "Six Feet Under," "Band of
"Big
Love,"
"Hung,"
Brothers,"
"Carnivale," and so on. Some of these
shows were true hits, some faded in their
later seasons notably "Six Feet Under,"
and
"Entourage," and now "Big Love"
some, like "Carnivale," were only beloved
moved on to
by crazy people who, like
even weirder things after the show's two
short seasons were lost. (Was "Carnivale"
a precursor to my love for "Lost"? Why
yes, I believe it was.X Thinking about the
diversity of HBO s lineup, and the almost
unbelievable proportion of quality shows
on the network, made me think both
about how HBO's programming model
managed to generate so much great work
and about how television as a whole has
changed as a result of a small subscription
channel called Home Box Office.
When professional critics and avid televisions fans (I include myself in the latter category) talk about why HBO is so
great, they tend to point to the fact that, as
a subscription channel, HBO is not subject to the fmicky rules of the FCC and can
include as much sex and swearing as they
want in their shows. Now, I'm not arguing
that this may be part of the appeal of, say,
"True Blood"
which is as close to softcore porn as you can get without actually
watching porn and I'll also concede that
the mobsters of "The Sopranos" and the
cops and drug dealers of "The Wire" were
much more authentic than they would
have'been had they been forced by the
?

censors to use "freak" and "crap" instead
of "fuck" and "shit." However, the sex and
swearing are only part of the appeal of any
given HBO show, and as evidence I will
point you toward the A&E reruns of "The
Sopranos," which are scrubbed of all cursing and much of the violence and still
manage to be intriguing.
No, the real reason that HBO shows are
of a much higher quality than almost any-

thing else on TV is that HBO values quality over quantity. This.means both that
shows have much shorter seasons, often
only around 12 episodes (although some-

times shorter: the most recent season of
"Big Love" ended after episode nine,
which ended up being a blessing for the
fans who were disheartened by how far
the once-great polygamy drama had fallen). This also means that they can have
much lower ratings in order to be considered successful. Indeed, because HBO is a
subscription channel, ratings don't really
matter that much and shows with
mediocre ratings, such "The Wire"
(which, I will mention again, is the best
show ever to be seen on television) are
allowed to continue long after they would
have been cancelled by other networks.
This focus on quality, coupled with the
shorter seasons, means that HBO shows
tend to have much higher production values than many network shows, although
the networks are now picking up on the
trends. The excellent cinematography of
"Lost" and "24," and the beautifully

ApriHs,-20K)
I lb

detailed art direction and.costume design
on "Mad Men," are really due to the influence of HBO. Indeed, I would argue that
television has been elevated to an art form
that can compete with cinema and that
often surpasses it, largely because of the
new standard of quality that the network
has set. I have not yet seen anything in
any movie that equals the fourth season of
"The Wire," which examined the failing
public school system in Baltimore in a
way that inspired fury, heartbreak and
the tiniest bit of hope. (Seriously, will you
all just go watch "The Wire" already?
You'll thank me later.) I'm not sure there
has ever been a movie .ending as polarizing and brilliant as the cut to black that
closed the curtain on "The Sopranos."
The point of all my ramblings is that
HBO gave birth to a new era in television,
one that has given us such gems as "Lost,"
"Mad Men," "Dexter" and "Arrested
Development." These kind of obsessively
detailed, deftly written and brilliantly
acted shows are, like those of HBO,
unique in that they don't pander to their
audience, but instead expect viewers to
invest their time and energy into the
show's world, and hopefully be rewarded
for their investment. So Don Draper, raise
your glass to Tony Soprano, because without him, you probably wouldn't have a leg
encased in a beautifully tailored suit
to stand on.

Performing multiple selves: peering inside Lorca's box
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY NINA PELAEZ
npelaezl@swarthmore. edu

This coming weekend, the theater
department will be putting on a production of"Bodas de Sangre," a tragedy written by Spanish poet and dramatist
Federico Garcia Lorca. The play is the
culminating honors directing thesis of
McFeely Sam Goodman's 'lO.
"Bodas de Sangre," translated into
English as "Blood Wedding," is a chronicle of violence, passion and mayhem.
Lorca's play recounts the story of a man
and a woman who are about to be married. However, the Bride is in love with
Leonardo, the son of an enemy family,
and she runs off with him on the wedding
night. The Groom pursues the pair into
the forest where the events reach a tragic conclusion.
Goodman's adaptation, however, goes
far beyond the text of Lorca's play. "We
are performing Lorca's play as written
but we have added on top of that," Nell
Bang-Jensen 'll said.
His adaptation uses Lorca's text as a
vehicle to explore the ways that people
create realities, try to shape their lives
into narrative and "perform" multiple
selves. The result is a complex performance that moves the text from a removed
event to something much more universal.
"Sam's adaptation celebrates reflexivity, celebrates theater, without being
solely about reflexivity or theater,"
Nolan Gear 'l2, another one of the production's actors, said.

The play also utilizes the idea of
"inside" and "outside" of "the box."
"I really wanted to create a performance that lets the audience see the people
underneath these archetypal characters," Goodman said. Goodman does this
by making all of the characters visible to
the audience at all times through the use
of screens, through which the audience
can see.
"The idea is that the characters are
'acting' as themselves because they can't
be seen by the audience, but really they
can," Bang-Jensen said.
"It has a very performative quality,"
Goodman said. "I hope that the audience
can take away that the people 'outside of
the box' are performing these archetypes
'inside of the box' as a way of expressing
themselves."
The play recounts the events in
Lorca's play and looks into what the
characters are left to deal with in the
aftermath of the events. In this adaptation, the events take place in a Las Vegas
wedding chapel, which is also reminiscent of an old movie theatre. The characters too have been transformed from
the original, into "a group of punkish
neo-flappers," as described by BangJensen.
Goodman did his own English translation of Lorca's text, making changes to
some of the language and tone, which
vacillates between modern and more
dated speech.
"The language helped shape the way
we wanted the designs to look,"
Samantha Panepinto 'l3, the production's

PEASLEE DEBATE SNAPSHOT

costume designer, said. The designs,

which are often anachronistic, reflect
some of the play's motifs.
"The costumes go with the disjoined
sense of reality in the play, Bang-Jensen
said.
The costumes also took influence from
surrealism, which heavily influenced
Lorca's writing. Panepinto also drew
inspiration from popular culture in creating the designs for the play.
"I was also inspired by Lady Gaga
because anybody who says they aren't
inspired by her is lying," she said.
Goodman also sees the play as a
metaphor for Lorca's own experience as
a poet and playwright. "Bodas de Sangre"
explores sexual politics and shows the
experiences of individuals with passions
that are repressed and constrained by
"

society.

Lorca's own repressed sexual identity
can be seen reflected in the narrative of
his play. Goodman's adaptation looks
closely at the way that these characters
in the play, and all people, attempt to
weave stories, in order to create an identity.

"We need stories so badly, so that we
can feel like we belong in the world,"
Goodman said. "That's what we like
about stories and theater; we identify
with them." The play promises to be an
evocative and complex adaptation of this
Spanish theater classic.
"Where other shows (tritely) collapse
the divide between audience and actor,
Sam is instead collapsing the interface
between interior narratives and exterior

"Bodas de Sangre" will explore sexual politics and the problem of repressed desires.
realities, exploring how we write our
own plays and perform them, what happens when our private narratives get
screwed up, how we pick up the pieces,"
Gear said in an e-mail.
The play will debut this Friday, April
16, at 8 p.m. with additional performances on Saturday, April 17 at 8 p.m. and
Sunday, April 19th at 3 p.m. It will be performed in the Frear Ensemble Theatre.

Lng overdue summit
tackles nuclear issues
The past two weeks have been a hopeful
time for those who worry about the continued existence of nuclear weapons and
their proliferation. Since the end of the
Second World War, a number of states
have built up nuclear arsenals and the
United States and Russia literally built
thousands of nuclear weapons each.
Despite the Cold War ending two decades
ago, nuclear weapons remain a global
problem. We are happy to see, however,
that President Obama has used his leadership to begin to tackle three of the most difficult problems nuclear weapons still pose.
Most dangerous to international security is the determination of what have been
named "rogue" states such as Iran and
North Korea to acquire the capability to
produce and deploy nuclear weapons.
While North Korea is known to have tested nuclear weapons in the past few years,
the Iranian leadership maintains that it
wants to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The United States and to a
lesser extent the international community
as a whole are worried, rightly, that Iran
might acquire a nuclear weapon, or worse,
the capability of deploying it. If this were
to be the case, regional stability in the
Middle East, already extremely fragile,
would almost certainly be upset as Israel
would be faced with the uncomfortable
question of intervening in Iran.
Until now, efforts to restrain Iran's
nuclear ambitions have been unsuccessful
despite strict United Nations-endorsed
sanctions on trading with the country. The
Obama administration has been looking to
further tighten sanctions to pressure Iran
into abandoning its nuclear program.
Until now, this has been difficult as support in the United Nations Security
Council has not been unanimous, with
China often threatening to veto any resolution unless it was watered down.
President Obama reportedly secured a
promise from President Hu Jintao of
China that the latter would join negotia-

tions.
A second problem, which is becoming
increasingly urgent, is the lack of a universal monitoring system for the whereabouts of nuclear weapons. While countries- such as the United States and the
United Kingdom face no problems protecting their arsenals, concerns have been
raised by the U.S. administration of the

letter

to

accountability and security especially of
the Pakistani stockpile as well as those of
countries that were formerly part of the
Soviet Union. In Pakistan, the worry is
that a terrorist organization might obtain
a nuclear weapon, which would have dramatic consequences for world stability.
After the fall of the Soviet Union,
Ukraine was left with enough nuclear
material to create an estimated seven warheads, according to The New York Times.
The United States signed a deal with
Ukraine to remove the material from the
country in exchange for U.S. assistance in
providing Ukraine with materials for
nuclear power reactors. Deals such as
these make us hopeful that further nuclear
proliferation can be curbed through international agreements.
On Monday and Tuesday this week,
world leaders gathered in Washington,
D.C. and agreed that by 2014, all nuclear
weapons must be safely stored and
accounted for. Such agreements had earlier proved elusive as some countries see
them as infringing on their sovereignty.
This is an understandable concern, but the
threat posed by further proliferation of
nuclear weapons is too great to be left

unchecked.
The last problem is less imminent than
the others, but shows the extent to which
nuclear warfare is still a possibility. Both
the United States and Russia have sharply
cut the numbers of weapons they own and
the numbers ready for instantaneous
deployment by thousands of warheads.
Despite this, each country still retains
enough nuclear weapons to annihilate the
other or, for that matter, most of the world.
The summit in Washington this week
received a strong initial push when in the
week before the summit, the United States
and Russia signed a bilateral agreement
agreeing to significantly reduce their
stockpiles of nuclear weapons. While this
agreement has correctly been criticized for
not changing the capabilities of either
nation, we believe that it contributed to a
closer relationship between the United
States and Russia, which is necessary
after the unproductive relationship under
President Bush. While this is only a small
step, The Phoenix believes that it can be
the start of what a writer in the magazine
Foreign Affairs recently called "the road to
zero."

Remembering an inspiring professor
To the Editor,
I never knew Professor Ostwald; I only
exchanged fleeting greetings with him
when opening the door to McCabe or
Parrish. Yet, I have long admired his figure as a great scholar who embodied the
dedication to intellectual work that is
ingrained in the core of Swarthmore. I
remember freshman year after reading
his version of Nichomachean Ethics being
told by Professor Sharpe that the translator, though retired for over a decade,
could be seen around campus dutifully
engaged with his research. I cannot fully
express here how much that inspired and
continues to inspire me, that a man in his

16

eighth decade of life would still approach

the world with a desire for further

inquiry.

The class motto of 1927, which is next to
the doors of Parrish where I would cross
his path, states, "Use Well Thy Freedom"
and I can think of few who embody its
words more fully than my vision of
Professor Ostwald, a seemingly joyful
octogenarian who would smile on his way
to study. My deepest condolences to his

family, to his colleagues and to the countless pupils he affected. The Swarthmore
community is now a poorer place without

him.

Aid remains exceptionally generous
Over the course of this
semester, this column has
tracked many of the
aspects of the college's
budget that can seem disconnected from students'
day-to-day lives. Financial
aid, however, is one aspect
that deeply, directly affects
students. This week, we'll
explore what financial aid
costs, where it goes, and
how Swat stacks up
Molly Weston
against peer schools.
Budget Break-down I
Parsing what the college "spends" on financial
mmmmm^^^^mmmm^^m
aid is a tricky business
because it isn't really "spending" in the conventional
sense. Instead, financial aid represents the additional
portion of the college's spending that it must fund from
its own resources. Thus, when the college plans its
budget, it calculates the amount it would gross from
tuition and fees if all students paid the full amount,
then subtracts the amount it expects to spend in financial aid. For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the college would
expect to receive $76.5 million in student revenues
without financial aid, but instead only expects to
receive $48.8 million, a $27.7-million difference. The
combination of increased tuition and fees for next year
with an estimated 11 percent increase in scholarship
expenses will push this amount up from $24.9 million
for the 2009-2010 budget year, with expected net students' revenues rising from $48.2 million to $48.8 million.
What does this mean on a per-student basis? In the
2008-2009 fiscal year (the last for which a financial
report has been released), 49 percent of Swarthmore
students received need-based scholarship from
Swarthmore. The average scholarship amount was
$29,151, up from $25,008 the previous year. As a percentage of charges, the average scholarship amount was 61
percent in 2008-2009, up from 55 percent in 2007-2008.
Year to year variation partially reflects the way
Swarthmore articulates its commitment to financial
aid. The college is committed to meeting 100 percent of
demonstrated need, as determined by the financial aid
office (on the basis of a number of standards, including
the FAFSA's expected family contribution). For many
students, the college's definition of their family's ability to pay (and therefore their need for financial aid) differs from their own interpretation, often by several
thousands of dollars. Thus, throughout this column,
please note that the college's definition ofneed may not
be (and often is not) the same as students and their families would define it.
Even the fact that the college meets full demonstrated need puts Swarthmore in an elite and generous
group: as of 2008, just 63 college and universities in the
US even claimed to meet full demonstrated need. This
list is composed mostly of private schools, with some
prominent public exceptions, like the University of
Virginia and the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, and includes all three Tri-Co schools, all
eight Ivy League universities, and all of US News &
World Report's Top 10 Liberal Arts Colleges. The last is
a bit tautological, as part of the ranking system
includes the financial resources of schools (which are,
obviously, closely related to ability to commit to meeting need).

Another very expensive and much-discussed portion
of the way Swarthmore does financial aid is the no-loan
initiative, announced on December 8, 2007 and begun
for the 2008-2009 academic year. This provision followed
what was at the time a growing trend among peer
schools and extended a commitment the college had
already made to Swarthmore Scholars, Evan Scholars,
McCabe Scholars and Lang Scholars (like myself). As
with the full-need commitment, "no-loan" in this case
does not necessarily mean that students and their families take out no loans. Instead, it means that when the
college makes its financial aid offer to meet all of what
it considers to be a student's need, it does so entirely
with grants and work-study. Prior to the no-loan initiative, the college still pledged to meet all of demonstrated need, but it sometimes did so by offering students
and families loans. The price tag on this initiative was
hefty: when the college announced the loan-free policy,

THE PHOENIX

it estimated that per-year cost would be about $1.7 million.
Only about 40 US colleges and universities claim to
be loan-free and just 14, including Swarthmore, place
no income or residence limitations on eligibility (many
schools, like UPenn, are loan-free for students whose
families have incomes below a certain threshold, while
many state schools offer loan-free packages only to instate students). Williams College and Dartmouth
College, both of which began their loan-free financial
aid programs around the same time as Swarthmore,
have recently begun reintroducing loans. As of this
writing, Swarthmore remains committed to its loanfree policy, a commitment it reaffirmed in the operating
budget released in February for next budget year.
Swarthmore's exceptional generosity and attention
to affordability, even among wealthy peers, has not
gone unnoticed. The Princeton Review, in their most
recent release, named Swarthmore one of just 13 colleges and universities on their "Financial Aid Honor
Roll" for earning a 99 (the highest score) for financial
aid. The Princeton Review's Best 371 Colleges also
named Swarthmore number one in the country for student satisfaction with their financial aid packages. In
conjunction with USA Today, The Princeton Review
also named Swarthmore number one among all private
colleges and universities as a "Best Value," beating out
even schools with larger per-student endowments, such
as Harvard and Yale Universities. Kiplinger ranked
Swarthmore second (to Pomona College) in the country
among liberal arts colleges as a "Best Value" for quality and affordability.
In the recommendations for adjusting the college's
spending proposed by the Ad Hoc Financial Planning
Group and approved by the Board of Manager in
December 2009, $457,000 in changes to financial aid were
approved. The only change to financial aid specified
was an increase in expected student summer earnings
from the previous rates ($1450 for first-year students
and $lB9O for returning students) to an unspecified
higher rate, after many years of no increase. The
Financial Aid Office's website reports that the college
now expects students to earn at least $2OOO in the summer prior to beginning Swarthmore and $2,500 during
each of the subsequent summers.
For the future beyond next fiscal year, however, it is
possible that more changes will need to be made.
According to the previously mentioned proposal,
Swarthmore's scholarship expenses have risen steadily
and significantly at a rate that may prove unsustainable. In 1993, scholarship expenses made up 24 percent
of gross student charges (i.e. students and their families
covered 76 percent of tuition and fees). In 2009, scholarship expenses made up 34 percent of gross student
charges. These rising costs have been covered through
increases in endowment income and the capital campaign and the Financial Planning Group noted that,
"growth is unlikely to be sustainable in the future." As
a result, the Planning Group recommended that the
possible lack of sustainability ofrecent growth in financial aid spending be considered in the college's longterm financial planning and adjustments to spending.
In light of all this information about how exceptionally fortunate we are as Swarthmore students, it is
worth considering the blurry line between "financial
aid" and general college spending. As we saw a few
weeks ago, tuitionand fees do not cover the per-student
cost of a Swarthmore education even for those students
who do not receive formal financial aid. For the 20102011 fiscal year, the college's operating budget projects
per-student spending of approximately $72,448 ($108.6
million total spending, spread over an expected 1499

be $51,500, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. This

Fusing anonymity
and safety online
The anonymity of the Internet acts as a
shield for most college students. It lends a sense
of security to users, allowing them to get advice
on private issues in a public forum without
ever having to disclose who they are. Websites
such as the college anonymous confession
boards (ACBs) serve as a place where frustrations are vented, crushes are made public, and
campus gossip is divulged. Often, the threads
are characterized by their incoherence, but
they do offer a window into the intellectual
maturity of Bryn Mawr and Haverford students.
Most people benefit from the opportunity to
share their views without any accountability
on the Internet. They know the chances of verbal retaliation are minimal and that their
thoughts are supposedly confined to the virtual
abyss of online discussion.
These websites demonstrate an undeniable
truth about not only ourselves but people in
general: anonymity makes us very honest. The
absence of personal repercussions for admissions made on online forums, much like bathroom walls, gives people access to an unfettered
expression of themselves.
Paradoxically, this makes websites like
Chatroulette all the more alarming, because the
opposite is true. With no registration process
and minimal safeguards, people have no idea
who they are really talking to. While engaging
in conversation with random strangers might
seem more exhilarating than typical Tuesday
night activities, the dangers are more profound
than simply being flashed.
While building an online relationship with
someone anonymous, you don't know what
their motivation is, and what, if any, of the
things they say about themselves are true.
Remember that when sharing personal
information on such sites, the person you're
talking to probably already knows what you
look like. A detail that seems vague and unimportant that you wouldn't think twice about
mentioning could make it very easy for someone to figure out where you live, who you hang
out with, or what your schedule might look
like.
Never give out names, phone numbers or
any other details that could give lead a person
to figure out who you are.
Even something as generic as a phone number gives access to your area code, which could
have detrimental consequences for not only
oneself but one's family as well.
And although Internet homicide may seem
more likely to be the plot of a bad movie than a
tangible reality, there have been instances of
people meeting in chat rooms that have ended
in tragedy.
According to Michael Largo, the author of
"Final Exits: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of
How We Die," Internet dating has become "very
popular, but since 1995, there's been...over 400
instances where a homicide has been related to
the person that [the victim] met online."
While not all cases may have such dramatic
outcomes as an encounter with a "Craigslist
killer," remember that it's easy to take a
screen/recording of incriminating Chatroulette
screens and activities. No one wants to be
caught doing something stupid or embarrassing, especially when online background checks
will probably be part of the hiring process for
future employers.
And remember, there is something infinitely
more satisfying about living in reality than
burying oneself in cyberspace.

Week in sports: Tiger's fade, the Jets' trade, an MVP vote stayed
Some of my thoughts

from the week in sports

...

A phony like no other
Sue me, but I wanted to
see Tiger win the Masters, I
really did. No more judgment can be passed on his
transgressions than has
been
already
passed,
including a particularly
nasty piece of hypocrisy
Timothy Bernstein courtesy of the chairman of
Augusta National (a golf
Bullet Points
club that does not admit
women) who opined that
Woods "disappointed all of
us" with his treatment of women. All the same, I would
have gladly accepted another excuse to marvel at the way
Woods is able to reduce these mental mountains to molehills and store them on the back burner while he's playing.
For about three days, it looked like there was a shot, even
though Woods, perhaps as a byproduct of his greatness,
struggles to come from behind at the end of major tournaments. In the end, it was not to be, as Tiger played himself
out of contention early on Sunday, and allowed Phil
Mickelson to pull away. Certainly, it's hard to root against
Mickelson in light of what his family has endured this
year (his wife was diagnosed with cancer), but I wasn't
quite ready to start pulling for the Jay Leno of golf, whose
affected populist act I always found much more grating
than Tiger's aloofness. Ultimately, his win left me in neutral, wishing instead that K.J. Choi had done a little bit better job off the tee and become the second straight South
Korean to win a major (Y.E. Yang won the PGA
Championship last year).

True, Choi likely never had 15 mistresses, but no one's
perfect.

"Talented but troubled"
is the apparent motto for the 2010 New York Jets, who
seem to be doing everything they can to emulate the Dallas
Cowboys of two years previous, right down to acquiring
well-known head cases and letting the "Hard Knocks" cameras document their training camp. Santonio Holmes,
Antonio Cromartie, and Braylon Edwards all came to the
Meadowlands prepackaged with the "talented but troubled" label, the one that seems to function as a repellent for
some teams and a nonfactor for others. The Jets are fast
putting themselves in the latter category, amassing an All"talented but troubled Pro" roster the likes of which hasn't
been since
well, since the "Hard Knocks" 2008 Cowboys.
That team, of course, imploded on itself when it turned out
that Terrell Owens and Pacman Jones weren't ready to
buy into the concept of team (yes, really) and the near-consensus preseason Super Bowl pick missed the playoffs. To
be sure, none of the Jets' recent acquisitions are as polarizing as Owens, nor do any of them come with quite the
excess baggage of a Pacman Jones. All the same, the success or failure of any NFL reclamation project falls squarely on the head coach. Cowboys coach Wade Phillips, with
his avuncular attitude and (in)famously easygoing training camps, proved ill-equipped to extract the potential
from a player like Pacman Jones. On the other end is New
England's Bill Belichick, who stole Randy Moss for a
fourth-round draft pick and immediately coaxed from him
the best season a receiver has had since Jerry Rice's
prime. How will Rex Ryan fare as manager of the most
high-profile day-care center in New York? One thing we
know already: he lets talented players loose, and he's got a
lot of talent now. And if Moss's experience in 2007 tells us
anything, it's that when talented players translate into
...

...

team success, the "troubled" tends to fall off the end on its
own. Either way, of course, it should make for some
incredible television this summer. Between "Entourage"
and "Hard Knocks," now HBO has well, only one show
I can't wait to watch this summer.
...

Arrogance at its worst
Sportswriters' willingness to treat their votes for seasonal awards and Hall of Fame berths like the key to a
chastity belt has become the most nauseatingly self-righteous trend in sports journalism today. There's no longer
an MVP or Hall of Fame race in any major sport that isn't
accompanied by a columnist feeling the need to explain
the tangential reason for why they won't just "give away"
their vote to the front-runner. It began in earnest when
Ann Killion of the San Jose Mercury News refused to vote

Mark McGwire into the Hall of Fame because she wouldn't know how to explain it to her children, then continued
when a prominent writer withheld his Hall vote from
Ricky Henderson because, having covered him for a number of years, he saw how he "dogged it" on some days. The
latest entry to this cult of bloated self-importance is NBA
writer Tim Povtak, who penned a column on Monday for
Fanhouse.com letting everyone know that Leßron James's
disrespect of his team's fan base by skipping the season's
final two games has cost him his MVP vote. Povtak's logic
is beyond laughable—surely Cleveland fans could care less
if James is in good shape for the playoffs, just as long as he
suits up for those two meaningless games—but the superiority at play here, the willingness to "punish" athletes by
withholding these votes, is even more startling.
Fortunately, Povtak himself supplies the appropriate summation: "Arrogance at its worst." He was referring to
James, of course, but it does the job on both ends.

improved

capacities

functions, such as an improved ability to multitask and to think creatively. According to
Stacy Z of Associated Content Online, lefthanded individuals experience perks such
as the ability to celebrate their own holiday
(International Left-Handers' Day, August
13th!), earn paychecks up to 26 percent
higher than right-handed individuals (as
seen from the study comparing men who
graduated from college, "Sinister and Rich:
The evidence that lefties earn more") and
experience an advantage at toll booths over
us lesser right-handed individuals, who
find ourselves struggling throwing change
into the toll booth buckets with our weaker
and

hand.
To offset these incredible benefits, studies have also shown that lefties are "more
likely to be schizophrenic, alcoholic, delinquent, dyslexic and have Crohn's disease
and ulcerative colitis, as well as mental disabilities" and "more likely to die young and
get into accidents" (Amanda Onion, ABC
News Online). One commonly held perception is that being left-handed gives you an
advantage in sports where athletes are frequently matched with just a single opponent (sports such as baseball, tennis, and

boxing). The reason for this advantage

18

stems from the fact that only about 10 percent of the adult population in the world is
left-handed. As a result, righties face lefties
less often than they face other righties, and

are less familiar with striking patterns and
tennis angles that come from these "southpaws." Are these perceptions supported by
the numbers?

Fact or Myth: It is advantageous to box

using a southpaw stance.

Fact. It appears that the "left-handed

advantage" holds in boxing, as four of the
current top 10poundrfor-pound boxers fight
in a southpaw stance as opposed to an
orthodox (right-handed) stance. This proportion oflefties in the top 10 is much larger than the proportion of lefties in the normal adult population.
Fact or Myth: It is advantageous to play
tennis with your left-hand as your fore-

hand side.

Myth. The lefty-advantage seems to fall
when looking at the best tennis players in
the world. Only two left-handed players, in

the past four years have finished at least
once in the top 10 in the end of year rankings for the Association of Tennis
Professionals. Fernando Verdasco and
Rafael Nadal finished in the top 10 in 2009,
but only Nadal managed to reach the top 10
from 2006-2008. (It's also interesting to note
that Nadal did not naturally favor a lefthanded forehand. His uncle convinced him
to switch from playing with his right to his
left hand when he was young as an attempt
to gain an advantage over other players. If
only he had read my column.) Of 40 potential spots in the men's top 10 these past four
years, only half of them were lefties, a percentage about equal to the amount oflefties
in the general adult population. Similarly,

only one left-handed player (Pattie
Schnyder, 2006) has managed to finish the
year ranked in the top 10 of the Women's

Tennis Association in the past four years.
Fact or Myth: It is advantageous to be a
left-handed batter in baseball.
Fact. Besides the incredible historic
examples that exist (Barry Bonds, Babe
Ruth, Ted Williams), the notion that lefties

are more successful batters in baseball is
supported by two facts. One, left-handed
hitters have an innate advantage over
right-handed pitchers because the pitcher
is breaking balls in general sweep towards
the lefty batter, and they are easier to see.
(An optical illusion occurs when a lefty
faces a lefty. The left-handed batter sees the
release of the pitch to be in line with him
because it comes from the same side.)
Because most pitchers are right-handed
(242 of the 328 pitchers on the current MLB
rosters pitch with their right hand), being a
lefty batter is a boon. Second, left-handed
hitters are a step closer to first base than
right-handed hitters. As a result, less time
is necessary to safely record a hit.
This perception that lefty batters are
more successful batters in baseball holds:
for the past four years, lefties have had wild
success in achieving a top-10 ranking in OnBase Percentage (a statistic that essentially
measures how often a batter records an
out). Of 40 potential spots in the MLB's top
10 leaders in OBP these past four years, lefties have comprised of 22 of them, a percentage way above both the percentage of lefthanded adults in the general population
and the percentage ofleft-handed batters in
the MLB (122 of 336 batters are left-handed
on current MLB rosters). For consistency's
sake, I did not include switch-hitters in my
analysis.
Fact or Myth: It is advantageous to be a
left-handed pitcher in baseball.

Myth. If we assume the previous statement about left-handed batters to be true, it
seems that left-handed pitchers should be at

April 15,2010

a disadvantage in baseball as the majority
of the batters they face will be right-handed.
Even the fact thatright-handed batters may
not be as experienced facing southpaws
doesn't seem to give a benefit to these pitchers, as seen in the top 10 leaders in Earned
Run Average (a statistic that measures the
frequency a pitcher gives up runs) these
past four years in the MLB. Of 40 potential
spots in the MLB's top-10 leaders in ERA

from 2006-2009, southpaws have comprised
only 11 of them. This percentage is more or
less equal to the percentage of left-handed
pitchers that throw in the MLB.
One argument that might challenge the

lack of success left-handed tennis players or
left-handed pitchers have had in their
respective sports is that there are just a
lower number of left-handed athletes that
do either of those activities in the population. But as we've seen in particular with
left-handed pitchers, the percentage of successful southpaws isn't even greater than
the percentage of left-handed pitchers in
general playing in the MLB.
It would also seem to be true that, if lefthanded athletes in these sports did hold
some natural advantage due to their physical orientation, there would be an influx of
successful southpaws into their respective
sports, as coaches would groom lefty tennis
players, and teams would draft more lefty
hitters and batters. As tennis and baseball

(pitching, at least) show, this simply just
doesn't always seem to be the case.
So, at least in respect to sports, the commonly held perception that being left-handed is advantageous isn't completely true.
While lefty batters in baseball may be better hitters and might have easier times at
toll booths, there's no denying that only six
of the top 25 highest-paid baseball players

are left-handed.

Young fencing team performing on national level
BY MARCUS MELLO
mmello2@swarthmore.edu
Last weekend, during Family and
Friends Weekend 2010, roughly 750 fencers
from 41 college fencing teams around the
country flooded into the Lamb-Miller Field
House for a two-day national fencing tournament
the United States Association of
Collegiate Fencing Clubs (USACFC)
National Championships, the largest colle-

giate fencing tournament in the world.
On Saturday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and
Sunday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Swarthmore
fencers dueled fencers from other colleges,
putting into action everything they had
learned as members of a young team. The
last tournament of the year ended in fine
fashion for the Swarthmore fencing team as
several squads placed respectably well and
two individuals, Jing Yi Ng 11 and sabre
captain Rodrigo Luger 10 qualified for the
individual tournament with Ng winning a

medal.
Before coming to the tournament, the
teams were seeded based on the results of
previous conference championships. With
seven different conferences in collegiate
fencing, it is the national Seeding
Committee's job to produce the seeded tournament brackets. The teams were seeded
epee, sabre and foil
and
by weapon
then by gender. To qualify for the individual tournament, the fencers had to perform
well in separate pools and then move on to
face other fencers in their event who also
qualified.
According to Swarthmore fencing head

coach Marshal Davis, the Swarthmore
USACFC Tournament was a result of basically two years of planning. Swarthmore
was officially made the host of the 2010
USACFC Championships in 2008, partly
due to Davis's well-known status in the collegiate fencing world.
"Fencing is a traditional type of sport,"
Davis said. "A new team with no experience
cannot expect to be able to participate at
large, reputable tournaments. You have to
be invited in order to participate."
As both the co-commissioner of the
Southern Atlantic Conference and the
Chief General Legal Counsel of the
USACFC, Davis has been able to get
Swarthmore experience hosting nationals
and invited to other big fencing schools
such as UCLA and Northwestern
as a
young team. The president of USACFC
came to Swarthmore and validated that
Swarthmore would be able to keep up with
the other teams at nationals.
And he was not mistaken.
At three years of age, the Swarthmore
College fencing team has witnessed extraordinary growth and has already reached several milestones. Swarthmore is part of the
Southern Atlantic Conference (SAC), which
is historically the largest and most dominant fencing conference in the country, and
includes many powerhouse Division I
schools such as Clemson, Georgia Tech,
Florida State, Virginia Tech and Navy.
Though a small liberal arts college,
Swarthmore has proven that its team can
keep up with teams from the bigger, more
athlete-oriented schools. Last month, the
Swarthmore team traveled to the 2010 SAC
Championships in Knoxville, Tennessee
and won the overall combined competition.
The team also placed 11 individual medalists, three of whom won gold medals.
The team started out in 2006 as what
Luger described a "small group of people

who met casually twice a week to practice
foil." Luger began fencing during his first
year. In his sophomore year, the club was
able to recruit several new sabreists and
hire Coach Davis. The team attended a few
open tournaments, one of which was held at
Temple University, where Davis was head
coach of the men's team. Davis came into
contact with the Swarthmore fencers and
the rest is history. Luger said, "Since then,
we've grown almost exponentially in size.
Our recent victories show that our level of
fencing has also increased dramatically,
and that in just three years we've earned a
place among the top collegiate fencing
teams in the country."

Davis knew that he would put a lot of
time into coaching and push the
Swarthmore fencers to become better when
he first began coaching. "I told them that I
do things right or not at all. I said I would
have Swarthmore fence a full schedule and
treat the team as a Dl [Division 1] squad
that had been around for a hundred years."
Davis modeled Swarthmore's schedule
closely after Temple's. "Now, we are the
strongest team in the SAC, which is basically the best conference in the country,"
Davis said. While many state schools that
have student bodies in the tens of thousands struggle to fill up a fencing team,
Swarthmore has put together a full one'
and a strong one that is
in a short span of
—

time.

Under the coaching of Davis, an accomplished fencer himself, the Garnet fencers
have improved tremendously. "The Swat
fencers are extremely dedicated and work
very hard," Davis said. "Fencing is a sport
that requires intelligence and the intellectual capacity of Swarthmore students
makes them great fencers. They can learn
and strategize easily."
While most other coaches teach their
fencers more about the blade, Davis focuses
on movement. The Swarthmore fencers
learn how to fence using the Soviet system,
a style that requires quickly thinking multiple steps in advance and making decisions
based on the happenings of the duel. Davis

brought the Soviet style with him from the
University of Florida, where Bruce Capin
coached him. World-class Olympic fencing
master Emmanuil Kaidanov from Penn
State trained Capin. "Swarthmore students
love the Soviet system. They are bright and
can absorb a style that takes other people
several years to learn," Davis said.
With most fencers walking on to the
Swarthmore team with no experience, it
takes a lot of work for them to reach the
level of fencers from other teams, a lot of
whom are recruits. Epee captain Quang
Huynh 10, who began fencing during his
first year, said that the epeeists have been
dedicating a lot of time to fencing. "On average, we've attended practice three to four
times a week working on tactics and drills
and hit the gym once to twice a week for
conditioning. The epeeists have worked
extremely hard over the past year and it
has shown in how they fence and in compe-

tition results."

According to Davis, a majority of the
fencers are continuing to practice until
finals and some are staying over the summer to train. With many fencers graduating

in the next two years, practice is important
for the Swarthmore team. Davis said that
he also plans to try to recruit more firstyears from the incoming class.
The fencing team certainly has a lot to
be proud of. The team has transformed
from a small group of students who fenced
for fun to a Southern Atlantic Conference
(SAC) powerhouse in just three years of
existence. "I am extremely proud of them,"
Davis said of his fencers. "I am especially
proud of the women to finish seventh in the
country overall considering they just began
fencing three years ago." On a more specific level, the women's sabre squad came in
sixth place, the women's epee squad came
in 14th place, and the women's foil squad
rounded up in the top 16. Overall, the men
were in the top 30 teams. The sabre quad
walked away with a tenth place finish
while the epee quad took 27th. The
University of Florida won the overall tournament.

April 15,2010

Luger, Swarthmore's sabre captain,
believes that this was the best year for the
sabre squad so far. "It's certainly the best
fencing I've seen in the three years the club
has been in existence, and if we keep
improving at this rate, I have no doubt that
we will be strong contenders for the gold
medal in Chicago next year." Last month,
the Swarthmore sabre squad secured a gold
in Tennessee at the SAC Championships
and the squad is continuing to improve.
"Our A squad consistently does well at
tournaments, and each year we become
more and more competitive. Our B squad is
entirely made of freshmen who had never
picked up a sword before. They've
improved dramatically in the past six
months and have been winning bouts at all
the tournaments we've been to this year,"
Luger said.
Ng and Luger were the only two
Swarthmore fencers to move on individually. Ng earned herself a seventh place finish,
establishing herself as one of the best
female epeeists in collegiate fencing in the
country. Davis acknowledged that a number of the fencers in Ng's individual tournament had Olympic or national points.
With the season over, the fencing team
will be losing five seniors. One of them,
Huynh, said that fencing has been a large
part of his life at Swarthmore. "It's been a
wonderful experience and I've developed
close relationships with many of my teammates." He plans to continue fencing after
leaving Swarthmore.
Luger agreed that it has been a fun experience to be a part of the Swarthmore fencing team. Although he said that it is a big

"Fencing is just as intellectual as it is athletic. When you're on the strip, it's just you

continue with fencing after Swarthmore.
Davis said, "We would like to give special thanks to the administration and the
athletic department for making the hosting
of nationals possible."
