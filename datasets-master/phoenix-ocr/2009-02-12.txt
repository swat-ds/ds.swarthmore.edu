Black History Month

in protest
1969: SASS occupies Admissions Office
In

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

This article is the second of a four
part series celebrating Black History
Month. Accompanying this article is
a 1969 Phoenix editorial defending the
members of SASS and supporting
their cause.
Perhaps one of the most memooccur
on
rable
events to
Swarthmore's campus is what eventually came to be known as "The
Crisis of 1969." In January of 1969, a
group of over 40 black students, led
by then-president of the Swarthmore
Afro-American Student Society
Clinton Etheridge '69, staged a sit-in
in the Admissions Office to protest
the lack of attention they felt they
were being given as students clearly
in the racial minority. Seven days
after the sit-in had started, then-president of the college Courtney Smith
died of a heart attack.
Between the years of 1953 and
1956, there was an average of two
black students in each class. By the
time of the graduating class of 1969,
that number had risen to nineteen,
but with the 1968 matriculation of
only eight black freshmen, black
upperclassmen questioned how committed the college was to increasing
black admissions. "There were
maybe 10 black students before my
class. With my class, there were
maybe seven or eight who came in
that year," Joyce Baynes '6B said. At
Swarthmore, Baynes was one of the
Seven Sisters, a group of seven
women who, according to Baynes,
"were the most passionate and active
about black student power and recognizing our history." The other Sisters
included Aundrea White Kelley '72,
Myra Rose '7O, Marilyn Holifield '69,
Jannette Domingo '7O, Bridget Van
Gronigen-Warren '7O and Marilyn
Allman Maye '69.
In October of 1968, Etheridge and
Don Mizell '7l, vice-chairman of
SASS, expressed these concerns in a
letter that was sent to then-Dean of
Admissions Hargadon and The
Phoenix. Unsatisfied with the administration's response, SASS then
issued a report to The Phoenix,
including a list of demands they had
for the college, which was supported
by the Student Council. Included in
that list was the creation of a Black
Interest Committee and a SASS
Recruitment Committee to promote
outreach to black students. Because
then-President Smith asked for clarification of the demands, SASS
released another report, this one calling for two black Deans to be hired
and enrollment of 100 black students
within the next three years. Smith
distributed these demands to the
entire student body with his
response, but SASS felt he had not
given sufficient attention to the matter.

"We decided to make demands to
institutionalize the things we had
we weren't
done before we left
looking for attention or a grand
standing," Marilyn Allman Maye '69
said.
...

THE PHOENIX

One of the main things black students wanted was increased representation on the campus. "We were
generally not happy with the support
we were pushing for
system for us
black faculty people we could talk
to and relate to," Baynes said.
According to Maye, "all of the
black workers were maids or janitors. There were no black white-collar workers." She was most angered
that black adults were called by their
first names and started addressing
them more formally. "We weren't
accustomed to calling grown folks by
their first names. It was offensive to
us. The class and culture [of
Swarthmore] started to hit you."
By Jan. 9,1969 the sit-in had started. And as the days passed and the
sit-in continued, almost all 47 black
students joined. "Moreblack students
joined us over time probably because
they saw three things: 1) the administration did not call the police on us, 2)
the administration did not move to
expel us, and 3) the moral legitimacy
of our position emerged over time,
the kind of moral legitimacy Martin
Luther King and other non-violent
protesters summoned," Etheridge
said in an e-mail.
And of the black custodial staff,
Maye said, "They were for us. Maybe
they couldn't say it out loud, but they
would bring us soap, toilet paper,
food. They weren't militant people
with afros; they were at the grassroots level."
Even with all the support, the
members of SASS do not deny that
there was much concern among the
students by taking so big of a risk.
"[Students] struggled with whether to
join or not... There was a lot of anxiety. People had scholarships. But you
have to decide what risks you are
willing to take. Most decided they
would rather be with us inside than
be on the outside," Maye said.
Maye said that she did not know
what to expect once the sit-in was
well underway.
"Even then, I knew I did not want
to be a moral coward, if I could help
it. I've lived long enough to realize
also that, sometimes, the things we
regret the most are not the things we
did, but the things we didn't do,"
Etheridge said in an e-mail. "In Jan.
1969, my parents were scared to death
for me: that I would be expelled from
Swarthmore, or beaten by the police,
or arrested. However, over the years,
I came to realize how proud of me
they were for what I did in Jan. 1969."
When Smith died on Jan. 16, the
SASS takeover reached national coverage and the sit-in was called off.
Many blamed SASS for Smith's
death, but Ellen Schall '69, then-president of Student Council, released
this statement to the college community: "There is no question in our
mind of blame or guilt; there is room
only for sorrow, not bitterness."
Still, there was huge backlash
from the community directed at
SASS. "I heard so many veiled
threats and so many unjust statements by members of this community that my faith in Swarthmore was

shaken," Asmarom Legesse, visiting
professor and African anthropologist,

said in an open letter.
Memhers of SASS remembered
having to be taken to neighboring
black churches until things settled
down. "I was saddened by [Smith's]
death and that they blamed it on students," Baynes said.
After the sit-in, a liaison committee was formed to address the situation between SASS and the faculty.
"This was by far the most worthwhile
experience being on a committee I've
ever had. Not that there wasn't tension, but everyone worked constructively," said Steven Piker, Professor
of Anthropology, who had joined
Swarthmore in 1966 and served as a
member of this liaison committee.
By the time of the sit-in, SASS had
existed for three years. The group
involved in the sit-in was among the
first cohort of SASS members with
Sam Shepherd '6B as the chairman.
"Sam was very eager to advance this
fledging organization which, after
some discussion, the black students
decided to name the "Swarthmore
Afro-American Students Society,"
Etheridge said in a letter to Vice
President of Community and College
relations Maurice Eldridge '6l
SASS, as an entity, was very community-oriented. "We participated in
anti-war activities and became
involved with Upward Bound and
voter registration in Chester. We
became quite active," Baynes said.
Though she had graduated by the
time of the sit-in, Baynes was very
involved in black student life in other
ways.
"We did some kinds of radical

things," Baynes said. Remembering
one incident in which the college
invited a white South African to
speak to the students in a mandatory
assembly on the anniversary of the
Sharpeville Massacre, Baynes said,

not all blacks, but
"We walked out
those of us who were really committed to the movement. We felt it was
insensitive of the college to bring a
white South African, and I was proud
we could do this. Nobody knew how
many would actually get up and walk
out."
Maye looks back on the SASS
takeover as "necessary because we
felt like we didn't have a voice. When
there's nobody in power to help you,
you have to be activists. Now, you
don't necessarily have to take over
the building anymore."
When she returned to Swarthmore
years later and saw the BCC gospel
choir perform, she said she was filled
with joy. "It is rare in your life that
you do something so risky and you
get vindicated," Maye said.
Etheridge has written his memories of the SASS sit-in in an article
entitled "The Crucible of Character:
A Personal Account of Swarthmore's
Crisis of 1969." In it, he writes, "On
the surface, the crisis was about
black admissions at Swarthmore.
However, at a deeper level, it was
really about the relationship of
Swarthmore College to black
America and the American dream."

extraneous contingencies. While demands may have been initially, tinciear to some, every effort was made to communicate the black grievances to the College community and to the outside press. SASS, by
presenting a united front of Swarthmore blacks, well demonstrated
the potential power "of black student solidarity. What could have
developed into a stalemate- (or worse) instead retained both ideological and political legitimacy. SASS invited reconciliation rather

to be right for Swarthmore. The amount of energy they were willing
to expend in solving the crisis and the speed with which they formulated proposals played a major role in de-fusing the explosive situation,
The students, while not directly involved in the continuing negotiations between faculty and SASS, still were, vital in-determining the
direction of the crisis. They had a wider variety of possible modes of
action than did SASS or the faculty. Essentially there were three

Two types of progression .are evident in the student body's actions: a progression from chaos to organization, and from extremism
to moderation. The student plenums epitomized the first progression.

in the decision-making process at Swarthmore. Factions inevitably
arose, ranging from those groups who spent; the five days in the

After students returned to campus,
Jewish Student Adviser Jake Rubin
held a closed-group discussion for
Jewish students about Gaza. He said
that the discussion was closed in order
to provide a safe space for discussion
and reflection for Jewish students,
many of whom, as Rubin said, felt "conflicted about what had happened."
"It was hard for them to think about
it and process," Rubin said, mentioning
how many have ties to Israel and support Israel's existence but were confounded by some of the "horrendous"
things that the country was doing.
Rubin said that people who attended
the meeting would not be willing to

Though he organized the closed discussion, Rubin stressed the importance

of open-group discussions and said that
he has been in discussion with Deans'
Offices to hire a trained facilitator to
host an open dialogue for the college
community this semester. "There's a lot

of truth on both sides," he said, adding
that the issue is not at all cut-and-dried.
Rubin added that he and Jewish students value an exchange of ideas, especially in a complex issue like this.
Brecher said that the organized proIsrael communities at Swarthmore and
across the world "are far from monolithic, especially regarding Israeli secu-

rity policy."
Being Jewish and pro-Israel, others
said, aren't synonymous. Although she
is Jewish, Brajtbord said that she finds
no contradiction in also being pro-

Palestine.
Summer Miller-Walfish 'll, who is
Jewish and supports Israel, said at the
meeting that she was "embarrassed" by
Israel's recent actions.
"Judaism is so much about peace
and loving your neighbor, and Israel is
not exemplifying that right now," she
said after the discussion. "They're not
representing what Judaism is and
they're not representing what I, as a
Jew, would like to see of the state."
About 40 people attended SFP's discussion last Wednesday night in a
Kohlberg classroom.

Post-election fallout in Iraqi Al-Anbar province
BY ELIZABETH THRELKELD
ethrelkl@swarthmore.edu

The story Maan Khater tells about voting in Anbar's recent provincial election
is a happily uneventful one. He and his
father and brother walked from their
house in downtown Ramadi to a nearby
polling station, found their names on the
registration list, waited in line for a few
minutes and cast their ballots. Khater, a
unit manager with USAID, says this election stands in stark contrast to the previous provincial elections in January of
2005. Thinking back to those elections,
Khater recounts, "the insurgents had
closed off the neighborhoods. I was lucky
to vote because I lived next to a school that
is an election center. It was not a very
good thing to talk about the 2005 election."
This time around, voting was far more
secure, with vehicle curfews in place and
a large police presence. Voter participation understandably increased, up to
around 40 percent in Anbar province as a
whole.
There were still flaws in the election
system this time around. Voter registration lists were based on the government
food ration cards, and some Iraqis (especially those displaced from their former
neighborhoods) searched in vain for a
polling station that would let them vote.
Election monitors also report being
denied entry to some polling centers. But
the more alarming developments in AlAnbar Province came after the polls were
closed and two rival parties started Claiming victory. The party viewed as frontrunners before election day threatened
that, if their opposition were to be certified as the winners, "Al-Anbar will be the
new Darfur." Thaar Al-Dulaimi, a Ramadi
English teacher, said he was frustrated by
what he saw as political posturing.
"Everyone accuses the other of faking the
elections. I think there is a confusion and
both parties are nervous."

What happened in Anbar after the polls
were closed provides a window into the
present state of democracy in Iraq.
Understanding exactly what happened
requires a little history, from the 2005
provincial elections.
In 2005, many Sunnis chose to boycott
the vote, some to protest the invasion and
their ouster from power and others in
response to threats against voters made
by Sunni religious leaders and insurgent
groups. Out of over a million people in the
largely Sunni province, not even 4,000 cast
ballots. Only one major party, the Iraqi
Islamic Party, or lIP, campaigned in
Anbar. It won all 41 council seats in the
province. According to Dr. Michael
Knights, head of the Iraq program at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy,
this was hardly a recipe for success.
"Anbar province has been in a political
cloud since 2005 because of the very
unusual circumstances under which the
provincial council was formed," he says.
"The Iraqi Islamic party has come under
attack by the various tribal groups who
contended that the lIP cooperated with the
U.S. military and should not have been
given control of the provincial council."
Those tribal groups are the traditional
power brokers in Anbar, and resented losing out to a political party that many saw
as being closely tied to Baghdad. "Before
2005," Al-Dulaimi explains, "the [IIP] was
the most popular in Ramadi and in Anbar.
But it does nothing for tribal counties. It
just stays in Baghdad involved in the

cial councils. Knights says that thanks to
this approach, "Many of the tribal groups
felt they had some stake in the system and
that their voices were being listened to."
But, he continues, that didn't stop them
from looking to take over the provincial
council and formal control of the
province. The Awakening groups received
support from the U.S. in theirfight against
Al-Qaeda, and both the groups and officials in Washington saw the 2009 provincial elections as a chance for them to turn
their influence into political power.
But the road to victory wasn't a smooth
one. Knights says the Awakening councils
and their militias quickly started fracturing into rival factions. "They have never
been a particularly homogeneous force,
and have always been run by tribal leaders that have strong personalities and
rivalries with each other. As a result, it
was very easy for these various
Awakening movements to be split apart
by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which is a fairly well-organized party." The splintering
of the tribal coalition was seen to blame
for their loss in the elections when the lIP
announced early in the week that, against
the odds, they had defeated the tribal
groups yet again. That announcement was
what touched off the storm of accusations
and threats from the Awakening leaders.

But when the Independent High Electoral
Commission released preliminary results

a few days later, the political landscape
changed. A moderate, more secularist list
called the Iraqi National Project took the
most votes, with the Awakening tribal
coalition in second and the lIP a close
third. Met with this mixed result in which
neither the tribes nor the lIP won outright, the parties backed off their threats
of violence and began the work of negotiating a coalition to run the governing
council. Reflecting upon the political
upheaval Anbar faced last week, Electoral
Commission Chairman Faraj Al-Hayderi
expressed frustration, but not surprise.
"In Iraq's elections, you have 14,500 candidates competing for 440 seats. This means
that about 14,100 will lose. This is not the
United States, where the loser congratulates the winner. They will blame me and
the electoral commission for their loss,
and will accuse the winning political
slates."
With more voters going to the polls,
more parties on the ballot, and better
security all around, there is no question
that this round of provincial elections was
an improvement on the last in Anbar. But
it might be a while before concession
speeches will replace threats and accusations on the political stage.

political movement."
Beginning in late 2005, many of
Anbar's tribal groups joined forces in the
fight against Al-Qaeda in the province as
Iraq saw the beginnings of its so-called
Awakening Movement take form. As the
groups started to gain widespread support, they began to enter Anbar's political
process through the back door, through

Seniors build hydrogen-powered motorcycle

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY KATHERINE ERNST

kernstl@swarthmore.edu,

Engineering students Alex Bell 'O9 and Andres
Pacheco 'O9 are just weeks away from obtaining the
final data on their thesis project: a hydrogen fuel cell
motorcycle.

"A lot of people push for electric cars because they
have this neighbor who built a battery powered vehicle," Bell said. "But the fuel cell still has the stigma,
like it's this Hindenburg. [We'll do] anything we can
to make it more mainstream."
Bell and Pacheco began designing their hydrogen
fuel cell motorcycle two years ago. Although the project started as an "extracurricular" experiment, the
pair found themselves devoting increasing amounts
of time and effort to its development. When senior
year came around, the two students were too invested
in the motorcycle's completion to switch to another
project for their engineering theses.
With a two-year head start (engineering students
usually only have a semester to design and build their
senior projects), Bell and Pacheco have completed all
of the motorcycle's major elements, even though they
devoted the extra time to making their project more
complex than is the norm for an engineering thesis.
"Now it's just a matter of testing and analyzing all the
data," Pacheco said.
Intent on proving the viability of alternative energy sources as early on as their freshman year,
Pacheco and Bell originally focused their efforts on a
partially completed electric car that had been left
behind by graduating seniors.
They worked on completing the vehicle with the
hopes of entering it in a driving contest for electric

cars, but when the expensive motors burned out during a test run, they decided to redirect their attention
to hydrogen fuel cell technology.
The engineering pair is working on a limited budget provided by the Swarthmore Engineering
Department, as well as the Halpern Family
Foundation Engineering Design Fund. Instead of
going with the conventional car, they decided to work
on a motorcycle.
The hydrogen fuel cell itself constituted most of the
expense, and the priciest one they could afford was
"only L 6 horsepower, and that
could basically never drive a
car," Pacheco explained.
Next, they contemplated
designing a Vespa or scooter
type of vehicle, but the hydrogen fuel cell is so large that those kinds of vehicles cannot
cope with its weight or volume.

highlight Swarthmore's engineering program.
"I think it would be hard for other undergraduates
to come up with their own idea and [have it be] fully
funded," Bell said. "It's nice to see Swarthmore
College getting some press saying 'look what's possi-

ble at a smaller school.'"
The positive press is also increasing public awareness of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Both Pacheo and
Bell hope their success will make the idea of a usable

Willets breakfast hopes to ease mice pains

CREAM RISES TO THE TOP.
THIS IS WHERE I l's

Willets residents congregated in
Mephistos last Monday morning
for a free breakfast and a meeting
that addressed the dorm's mice
problem. The breakfast, which provided students with the opportunity to fill out surveys detailing their
mice encounters, was the latest in
the administration's, efforts to
respond to student complaints
about the infestation.
The chief organizer of the event
was Assistant Dean for Residential
Life Rachel Head. "It's been a
rough couple of weeks," she said.
"We just want to show [the students] we haven't forgotten about

it

an alternative to killing the mice,"
she said.
Students at the event generally
agreed that the breakfast was a
start, but hoped that there would be
more to come from the administration on the problem. "I think the
breakfast shows that the school is
taking the problem seriously, and I
hope that it's followed up with serious action," Sara Forster 11, a resident of Willets, said.
Forster
has had multiple
encounters with the mice in the
hall, despite her adherence to the
prevention guidelines.

Another Willets resident, Nicole
Cox 'l2, said of the breakfast, "I
think a lot of people have already
done those things
have gotten
bins and gotten peppermint oil.
Generally, I think there needs to be
a bigger response to the problem."
Head met Tuesday with representatives
of
Environmental
Services, Workbox and with others
in the administration to discuss the
results of the surveys and evaluate
current and potential responses to
the infestation.
"It's just a time to meet and see
if everyone's doing everything they
can," Head said.
In the meantime, Head stressed
the importance of maintaining
communication between students
and the administration. The best
thing for students to do at this
point, Head said, is to keep diligent
and specific in reporting encounters with the mice.

Labor Action Project to bring workers to campus

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

The

Swarthmore

Labor

Action

Project (SLAP) is bringing four local

mushroom farm workers from Kennett
Square to campus this Thursday to
speak about their labor experiences in a
panel and discussion session. Kennett
Square farmers produce 60 perdent of the
mushrooms grown in the U.S., and immigrants much of the labor.
"We just want to educate the campus
about this issue because it's close," said
Ruth Schultz 'O9, a member of SLAP.
Farm workers are subject to poorly
enforced labor condition standards and
receive wages that keep them below the
poverty line. SLAP's desire to educate
fits in with its larger goal, which is to
help local groups engaged in struggles
for better labor conditions and fair
wages.

In the long-term, SLAP hopes to do
more than just educate the community

about the problems that the farm workers face. "I think [the panel is the] first
step towards a union between SLAP and
the organization CATA," said Alfredo
Chuquihuara 'lO, another member of
SLAP. CATA is a Spanish acronym that
translates to Farm Workers Support
Committee. It is one of two groups that
give the mushroom farm workers a collective voice to raise their concerns. The
other, the Kaolin Workers Union, is an
independent union that was formed in
1994.
A union between CATA and SLAP
could help CATA in its efforts to purchase a community meeting space.
"CATA is focusing on building a home, a
space for [the workers] to have to unite
as an organization, a space for solidarity," Chuquihuara said. A year ago the
group was kicked out of its offices and
has been running out of worker owned
houses and cars ever since. Purchasing a
house or renting an apartment in
Kennett Square is an important goal for

the workers because in addition to giving them a meeting space it would also
give them a footing in an area whose
properties are mainly controlled by
mushroom factory owners and their families.
SLAP is helping CATA in its efforts to
raise the money necessary for making
such a large investment. The group has
invited the college faculty to the panel
and has sent them letters asking for
donations. They are also creating a documentary to raise awareness about the
difficulties workers face in pursuing
unionization and translating CATA's
Spanish campaign
literature into
English.
But this relationship isn't entirely
new. Professor Aurora Camacho de
Schmidt will be introducing the panel
this Thursday. Part of her introduction
will focus on the plight of the farm worker and the way in which low farm wages
are used as a strategy to keep food prices
low. But her introduction will also draw
on of her connections to the Kennett
Square community.

Iconic civil rights activist Angela Davis speaks at BMC
BY SHANNON MURPHY
BICONEWS.COM, FEBRUARY 10, 2009
Angela Davis, civil-rights icon and political
activist spoke in a packed Thomas Great Hall on
February 4. Davis gave this year's Black History
Month keynote address. The event was hosted by
the Multicultural Center, Intercultural Affairs,
and The Sisterhood, and was organized by
Conferences and Events.
Davis was introduced by Christopher
MacDonald-Dennis, Assistant Dean and Director
of Cultural Affairs at Bryn Mawr. MacDonald
reflected on the recent historic presidential election of Barack Obama as well as the themes of
"resistance, survival, and liberation" that were a
strong part of the civil rights movement in the
19605.
Much of Davis's speech was focused on the
recent election of President Obama.
"The idea of having a president willing to
make bold, progressive moves is still very new,"
she said.
Davis thenrecounted the recent actions taken
by President Obama and his cabinet in reforming
the country. In regards to the election, Davis
reflected, "many people have said that Martin
Luther King Jr.'s dream has been realized...but
has [it]?"
She responded, "the Black man has now
become Head of State...so, what is the significance of the election?...How far have we come as
a country?...lt has not brought liberation to us
but it does tell something about this particular
political conjecture...the election did not prevent
a police officer from shooting an unarmed black
man but the election ofBarack Obama gives us
hope that we will be able to overcome in this new
terrain."
Davis reflected on the concept of civil rights
within the nation, saying, "many people assume
that even if this election is not a realization of a
dream, it is the final realization of civil rights...
the term civil rights has become a synonym for
racial equality. But, of course, we know that
other groups have been and continue to be
denied the rights of citizens, for instance the
right to marry."
"The problems that continue to emerge with
this tendency to equate civil rights with racial
equality are many," she said.
In regards to the civil rights movement, Davis
had the following to say: "I find it very revealing

that what was once known as the Freedom
Movement is now known as the civil rights

members of the
Swarthmore faculty

movement. Civil rights was only one aspect of

the Freedom Movement."
Davis, who paused to ask the audience exactly
what kind of women's institution was Bryn
Mawr, also discussed the significance of women
in the movement.
"Women played an important r01e...1t was
women who invited Dr. King to be a spokesperson for the civil rights movement. We just don't
know how to acknowledge the agency of everyday people in history. We have to figure out how
to recognize the work that ordinary people did."
By "ordinary people", Davis was describing
the masses of people involved in the movement
whose names never appeared in textbooks, who
never became iconic representatives of the movement such as Dr. King and Malcolm X.
Davis concluded her speech by returning to
President Obama.
"Many of us have said that we never expected
an African American president in our lifetime.
Why did so many people say that they never
expected to see a black president?" she asked the
audience. "When Dr. King was asked...he said it
shouldn't take more than twenty-five years."
"I was amazed that he talked about it so casually and yet we thought of it as such a big deal,"
Davis said.
On the appeal of Obama, she admitted, "I don't
think its so much about his racial or economic
position as about his political ideas of freedom.
[The civil rights movement] has always been an
engagement with the State. We couldn't imagine
a person who was part of these movements to
challenge the State to be the Head of State. We
have to figure out how to revitalize our movements, they cannot be governmental."
"We have to push the government and push
Obama, but I think he's invited that push," said
Davis. The audience, rapt with attention by the
convivial and calm Davis, gave her a standing
ovation when she concluded her talk.
"I was really struck by connections she made
between individuals and the population. I really
appreciate the fact that it wasn't just being a
Black American in history, it was about uniting
everyone and proving that racial barriers, sexual barriers and identity should be a united front,"
said Blair Smith 'l2 about Davis' speech.
Holly Webb 'l2 reflected, "I thought it was
interesting that Dr. Davis was so focused on
Barack Obama and I thought it was good that she
focused on acceptance and progress of the entire
country. I hope that it will spark discussions
about change on Bryn Mawr's campus."

and student body marched with farm
workers asking for the right to unionize.
In addition, they aided the cause of the
farm workers by spreading the word to
others in the community, painting banners and acting as translators for the
immigrants.

"There was a great deal of solidarity
between the students and the faculty
members and the workers," Camacho de
Schmidt said. Although the connection
has not been as strong in recent years,
Camacho de Schmidt has kept contacts
and passed them along to SLAP.
SLAP members spent last semester,
the group's first, using these contacts to
build the foundations for a strong collaboration with CATA. They met with workers in Kennett Square and got to know
the farm workers' labor organizations.
The group hopes to host more events
on campus this semester to raise awareness and involve more of the student
body. But they have already succeeded in
constructing a relationship between the
farm workers and the members of SLAP.
"It's a good relationship because there's
a lot of communication. It's not us doing
something for them, and it's not them
doing something for us, but us collaborating on this project," Schultz said.

'Baraka,' a 'About Face' tackles white identity
meditation
BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

A Japanese man walks down a busy

street in Tokyo, his face covered by a straw

hat, his robes swinging back andforth. He's
ringing a bell as he walks so that it chimes
at a constant interval, calling people to pay
attention and join him on his religious journey. His movements clash with the fastpaced city life around him, where people
leave stores wearing the latest fashions
and businessmen in expensive suits catch
their next meeting. Amidst all this hustle
and bustle the man is barely noticed. This
sense of spirituality out of context
in the
wrong place and time
is presented in the

film "Baraka," which was shown on campus Saturday night as the culmination of
Religion and Spirituality Week.
"Baraka," directed by Ron Fricke, is a
1992 experimental film devoid of any dialogue, let alone any sort of plot. While these
qualities seem to spell disaster for a film,
they are ultimately what make "Baraka"
powerful. Shot with 70mm film, the same
format used for IMAX films, "Baraka" feels
like a Discovery Channel documentary,
only without the annoying voiceover. The
film is made up of beautiful images from
the most picturesque places in the world,
which are spliced together to create a spectacular purview of the different ways that
people
live and practice religion.
Complemented by a wonderfully composed
score, the film becomes an expression of
spirituality as experienced around the

world.
Brice Jordan 'l2, who worked with the
Religion and Spirituality Week Committee
to show "Baraka," said, "It seems that the
entire movie is not only about religious
practice but life, and how it is: the good and
bad, horrible and beautiful."
One scene that focuses on the cadences
of industrial life reflects the whole of the
experience that is "Baraka." Images of life
in the metropolitan environs of Tokyo and
Los Angeles are intercut with shots of a
chicken-processing plant. The sight of thousands of chickens is matched with timelapse images of millions of Japanese people
going through turnstiles and packing into
trains during their daily commutes. Cars
start and stop at set intervals in conjunction with traffic lights in much the same
way that factory workers checks each chick
before placing it on its own sheet. A beatdriven score reinforces the monotonous
cycles seen on the screen.
The experience of watching "Baraka" is
unique to film. "Baraka" uses the medium
less as a mode of dialogue-driven storytelling than as a uniquely tinted window to
the world. Watching the film, it is clear that
Fricke's editing instincts are as sharp as
his cinematography. The images, breathtaking as they may be, are neutral and
meaningless on their own, but the way they
are interlaced creates a very particular
experience of the world.
"Baraka" strives to treat film as art in its
purest form. It doesn't put a premium on
narrative, score or individual images;
rather, its inclinations are entirely filmic.
For the viewer, the film resonates on an
emotional level and ultimately becomes a
meditation of sorts, allowing one to reflect
and achieve a truce with one's own spirituality.

LOS CAMPESINOS! AT OLDE CLUB

Any band with an exclamation point in its name is
setting itself up for the
expectation of being fun.
And by most indications,
Los Campesinos!, who hail
from Wales and will be performing at Olde Club this
Thursday, Feb. 12 at 8 p.m.,
won't disappoint. While it
may seem like Olde Club is
a haven for obscure indie
bands whose music can be
just as easily be forgotten,
this band seems to take a

whimsy to their act that
sets them above the crowd.

First

off,

Los

Campesinos! have spunk.
On their blog, which they
actually update, they had
the chutzpah to write a post
none too positive about
Swarthmore, in which they
claimed that they did not
want to play at a school
which was for "gifted/rich

kids" and that it is "Not
Cool" that Olde Club only
allows Tri-Co students.

February 12, 2009

Thankfully, this issue has
been smoothed over (It was
a misunderstanding, guys!)
and, according to Olde Club
booking director Charlie
Decker 'O9, everything is
"peachy keen." This is fortunate
because
Los
Campesinos! are generating
an incredible amount of
excitement. A glance at the
event's Facebook group
proves that they have fans
from all around who are
dying to come.
Alas, we who actually go
to this school and get the
chance to see this much-indemand band are the lucky
ones. If the critical praise
showered
Los
upon
Campesinos! for their two
albums released last year
doesn't seal the deal for you,
maybe their precious Welsh
accents will. (Anglophiles,
we know you're out there.)
Sure, it's completely shallow to like music based on
its vocalist's interesting
accent, but if you hear how
they speak-sing the line,

"Do you kiss your mother's
lips with that mouth?" in
"Documented
Minor
Emotional Breakdown #l,"
it's hard not to be charmed.
With seven members in
the band, there's the chance
that Los Campesinos! could
create either some really
awesome, layered sounds or
a cacophonous mess. What
I've heard displays a lot of
the former. I'm especially
pleased by the background
female vocals mixing with
the male lead singer's tone.
But they're also bold
enough to experiment with
their sound.
Plus, this is a band you
can dance to, and they are

Bad cancellation decisions, part II: save our Bluths!
In

Yorker's Nancy Franklin liked it, and I'm
certain that she actually hates television).
Despite never having an audience,
"Arrested" stands as one of the funniest
shows ever filmed (I wouldrank only "The
Simpsons" and "Seinfeld" on the same
tier). The action, for those of you who
missed out, centers on the Bluth Family,
specifically
Michael Bluth (Jason
Bateman), the family's middle son, who is
the only sane person in the family, as well
as the father of the Ã¼ber-dorky George
Michael Bluth (Michel Cera, in the role
that made him into the hipster heartthrob
he is today). These two characters form the
epicenter of the family and the force that
ultimately keeps them all together.
The show's plot is set in motion in the
first episode, when patriarch George Sr.
(Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested for embezzling
money from the Bluth Company, of which
he was the CEO. His arrest leaves his family broke and scrambling to save the company name. Well, actually, Michael is the
only one trying to save anything; the rest
of his family is too busy trying to preserve
their own lifestyles to be of much help.
"Arrested" was the home of one of the
best ensemble casts on television, and the
family is the nucleus. Portia de Rossi is
appropriately selfish as Michael's twin (?)
sister (??) Lindsay Bluth-Fiinke, while
David Cross is wonderfully self-delusional
as her husband Tobias, a former psychologist who is now trying to make his way as
an actor. (He's terrible). Michael's older
brother, Gob (pronounced "jobe," short for
George Oscar Bluth n, and played by Mr.
Amy Poehler himself, Will Arnett) is a
hilariously failed magician, while younger
brother Buster (Tony Hale) is an emotionally stunted perpetual grad student who
still lives with his mother.
Ah yes, his mother. As embodied by the
sublime Jessica Walters, Lucille Bluth is as

I've spent a lot of time speculating over
why "Arrested" never managed to find an

'American Boy(s)' and girls prepare for Estelle

"Take me to New York, I'd like

last Sunday, Grammy-winning
"American Boy." Estelle might

"We looked more in the field of

hip-hop and R&B," Committee
member Reid Wilkening 19 said.
"In the fall, the LSE was more of
an indie, folk-rock style artist. We
decided to tread away from that
genre
We only hold two of
these, so we try to cater to as
many [tastes] as possible."
There's a lot to anticipate
...

about the LSE. Estelle ensures a
solidly hip-hop and R&B set,
brings

a

fresh international flavor, and
will likely be one of the most zeitgeist-y performers to come to
Swarthmore in the college's
recent memory. Ayanna Johnson
'O9 said, "I'm pretty excited. I
think it's amazing that we're having such a big performer come on
campus. I think her music is really great."

Still, much of the anticipation
that the student body has for this

coming act is less all-out fandom
and more curiosity. "I think most
of the [LSE Committee knows]
that single that came out over
break," Andrew Hwang 10,
another member, said. "I guess
she was pretty well-liked, so we
came to decide on her. But I don't
know of any die-hard fans."
To blame for her relative
obscurity may be the very single

that rocketed Estelle to worldwide fame. The public may be for-

given for mistaking Estelle to be

the featured artist to Kanye West
in last summer's "American
Boy," rather than the other way
around. Estelle's hip but slight
vocals are undercut by the tradition of personality-less vocals in
rap/sung collaborations. While

Estelle gives says little about herself in the song, West has to get all
self-reflective on us with lines
like, "Reluctantly, because most
of this press don't fuck with me."
(We know, Kanye, it always has to
be about you).
One shouldn't overlook the
critical success of Estelle's work.
Her 2008 sophomore album
"Shine" fared well, with reviewers celebrating the breadth ofher
vocals (eschewing diva belting for
effortless
"jazzy
crooning,"
according to the Boston Globe's
Sarah Rodman) and her rapping..
There's an unabashed pop sen-

sibility to Estelle's work, as evidenced by her army of big-name
producers,
including
John
Legend, will.i.am, Cee-Lo and
Swizz Beatz, and her many shoutouts to pop classics
her song

"No Substitute Love" is a reggaefied sampling of George Michael's
"Faith." But Estelle also puts herself out there in her music, con-

trary to the impression given by
"American Boy" It's too bad that
her U.S. debut wasn't "1980," the
first single off her first album
"The 18th Day" and a hit in the
UK in 2004. Bolder than the lovin'

and materialism territory that
"Shine" covers, "1980" is a hell of
an introduction for Estelle, who
presents herself here as a rapper
first and singer second who grew
up in an immigrant family.

Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen
asserts that Estelle is for "anyone
who never warmed to Erykah
Badu's Egyptology or still
mourns Lauryn Hill's disappearance." In comparison to mainstream R&B and hip-hop,

Johnson said, "I think her songs
are different... They're a bit more
down to earth, kind of realistic."
Even "American Boy" is pretty refreshing in the realm of pop
music. Unfortunate subordination under Heartbreak K's ego
aside, "American Boy" bucks
trends by portraying the U.S. as
the "Other" and probably making
America more palatable to the
rest of the world.
Though the rest of the world
might need a few more albums to
get to know Estelle better, we
Swarthmoreans have the treat of
seeing her live, which will give us
a better sense of the artist as
more than that English girl who
was liking this American boy.

see. And yes, we- are all terrible dancers. We have all
heard so many satirical references to "the Paces hookup"
or "awkward Paces dancing" that writing about Paces is
just as lame and overdone as going there is. But redundancy aside, the throbbing beats and gyrating hips of
Paces parties are such a presence on campus that, cringeinducing as they may be, excluding them would render
my already dubious portrayal of the Swarthmore social
scene completely inaccurate. So here it is: my token Paces
column.
The premise of a Paces party is essentially this: take a
random assortment of Swarthmore students, put them in
a small room with loud rap and a significant quantity of
alcohol, and see what happens. Bewildered, these students

will first mill about aimlessly, perhaps bob their heads
and bounce in a strange manner that vaguely resembles
dancing, or cluster in standing groups near the bar,
throwing back as much "red drank" as they can before it
gets crowded. Little do these poor bar-dwellers know that
the drinks often contain so little alcohol that if you drink
too much, you will be in danger not so much of alcohol
poisoning, but of severe juice overload, resulting in an
incessant need to urinate and a strange sloshing sound
that will follow you around when you walk.
Luckily, the party always progresses with time, and
eventually it will get so crowded that people will start
bumping into each other in their aimless milling, and perhaps will think "Hmm, I've already bumped into you.
Perhaps, I should just grab your ass. And then maybe
start dancing." And so, Paces takes on its renowned clublike atmosphere
like a really tiny club, full of poorly
dressed people.
While I have already significantly derided the dancing
abilities of Swarthmore students, I will concede that when
we're on top of our games, most of us can at least manage
to look ironically endearing in an "I'm actually just mocking people who dance like this" kind of way. But every
once in awhile, I am positively blown away by the bizarre
mating rituals that people engage in on the Paces dance
floor. Last weekend, I saw a pair of students in the back
half of Paces who honestly looked like they were playing
a contact sport, except they couldn't have been playing it
correctly, and they really should have been wearing pads
and helmets according to conference regulations. In their
giddy state of inexperienced inebriation, they sort of periodically flung themselves at each other, bouncing back
out from the shock of the collision, but then magnetically
were drawn back in. Upon re-collision, they would then
clutch at one another's pasty bodies and try to steady one
another with their tongues, only to be foiled by the effects
of gravity. They would then stumble and fall apart, and
start all over again. Attempt sexy dance, fail, repeat.
At this point, you may be wondering how this makes

an argument for Paces as p
solution to your pseudoexistential crisis. First of
all, Paces has endless
comedic absurdity to
fuel your reconciliation
with the futility of pursuing a meaningful existence.

dancing, then next thing
you know you've had the equivalent of a few drinks
(which is probably like eight Paces drinks these days
because they're so weak) and you finally succumb to the
irrationality of it all and you dance your sorrows away.
Or, if your existential crisis manifested itself in a more
munchies-inducing way, you can always feast upon the
mandatory drunk-snacks kept next to the bar. Although I
will warn you: beware of the generic tubs of "Party Mix."
They are clearly designed to lure stoned college kids into
ingesting lethal doses offake cheese and sodium.
If you do not buy this, then you can always wallow in
your academic frustrations and continue to struggle with
determining exactly why you are spending your Saturday
nights trying to disprove Foucault, or any French theorist
for that matter. But I say, do not take the proximity of free
booze and a safe environment in which to drink it for
granted. Even if you prefer to remain booze-free, you can
at least revel in how positively awful current pop music is
and express your contempt by dancing ironically to it.
There, I've done it, I have written my obligatory Paces
column. It had to happen. I have reinforced the cliche and
critiqued Swarthmore's most stereotypically mainstream
social institution. Don't judge me.

that culturally-sanctioned napping was
right up my alley. But siestas haven't
translated into the hours of blissful sleep I
imagined. What I didn't realize is that the
siesta exists because the Spanish do NOT

sleep at night. Everyone, regardless of age,
stays up until at least 2 a.m.on weekdays.
I'm still living down the shame I felt my
first few nights here when I would get into
my jammies as my Senora was busting out
her fur coat to go chillax with her amigas.
On weekends, it's worse with Spanish
young'uns. After a light dinner around 10
p.m., they don't head out to the discotecas
until well after 2 a.m. It's standard to party
until closing time at 6 a.m., and then go out
for chocolates con churros.

THE PHOENIX

As someone who regularly chooses
sleep over lesser things like reading and
eating, I've found that staying up until 9
a.m. has been surprisingly easy since it's

one of the few times that madrilenos
become really forthcoming. Who knew
that a backdrop of god-awful techno music
and lukewarm cuba libres was perfect for
illuminating conversations?
Over the past few weeks, I've managed
to amass quite the vocabulary from the
jovenes. Because I love you and because
lists are easy and I forgot I needed to write
a column this week, I present to you the
basic working vocab of the madrileno:
Culo: Basically, 'lass," but not quite as
strong since even my Senora uses it. From
my experiences, there's a national obsession with the culo. Unlike in the States,
where there's a wider albeit equally
sketchy range of fawning, the piropos (catcalls) and creepy stares directed at girls all
center around the round thing in yo face.
The culo obsession is so pervasive that
it exists even when the culo itself does not.
I am not being modest when I say that I literally have no ass. On particularly gusty
days, the seat of my pants is prone to flapping in the breeze. I almost feel bad for the
guys who try and grab my culo, only to
come away with a fistful of jeans.
Vale: This is the Spanish equivalent of
"okay." (For Spanish speakers outside of
Spain, an equivalent is "bueno"). It's basically used to express agreement or just to
fill in any random space in the conversation. Or to disguise frequent moments of
complete lack of language comprehension.
Buitre: Literally "vulture," this term is
used for a sketchy guy who keeps hovering
around a girl. As I wasn't getting their def-

mitions of "vulture," a guy had to actually
flap his arms up and down like a bird and

squawk. Several. Times. Maybe this
Swawkward thing is contagious.
Tio/a: Literally "uncle"/"aunt," this
means "guy"/"girl." To say the girl or guy
in question is hot, add a "guapisimo/a" or
"buenisimo/a." Yeah, that made for some
incest-y confusion for a few weeks.
Puta Madre: I'm sure the majority of
you know this one already, but I had no
grasp of its sheer versatility until I arrived
on the Spanish shores. Literally "whore
mother," it can take on a ridiculous range
of meaning with a few handy prepositions.
jMejor juega con tu puta madre!:
Worried about fending off sexual predators, one guy wrote this rule in my pretentious moleskine: "If anyone asks you if you
want to play the dolphin, eat a snack,
sweep the dust, yell this." Basically, it
means "I'd rather play with your whore
mother." Nice.
jEres de puta madre!: Adding "de"
turns this grave insult into a compliment
of the highest order. This is what you say
to someone who has just found all-youcan-eat paella for 5 euros. Seriously,
paella is the best thing I have ever
shoved into my mouth. Yes, it is so

good that I typed that sentence even as I heard the

faint chorus of "That's
what
she said!"
crossing
Atlantic.

Riquisimo/a!: Basically, "Very deli-

cious!" If a much beloved Senora cooks for
you, you say this. It does not matter if you
do not like it. It does not matter if it is murcilla (blood sausage.) You say it. You say it
even though it actually tastes and, holy
god, feels like dried blood in your mouth.
Zanahoria, Churro...: The key to
Spanish sexual innuendos is to revert into
your mental state in fourth grade when
you still couldn't say "sex" without giggling. I understand that for some of you,
this may be a lot less of a mental stretch.

from a basic consumer anxiety: the issues

So far, I've managed to be selective.

The United States government, on the
other hand, has no such luxury. So this
week's topic is how the executive branch
and its chief executive should go about
confronting such a broad panorama of
international issues without working
itself to exhaustion or neglecting other
important facets of executive leadership.
It, and he, must do this by delegating.
Delegating is key because, realistically,
there isn't time enough in his four- (or
eight-) year presidency for Barack Obama
to micromanage the plethora of internationaland domestic issues that need to be
tackled. The other day I was asked to summarize a few of these to a friend. So here,
in radically condensed form, is a primer of

to

within their own borders, possibly
because the government is riddled with
sympathizers more loyal to local interests
than to any Western-allied president. A
weak and infiltrated central government
means that the country's nuclear arsenal,
and nuclear information, is vulnerable.
A.Q. Khan, recently released from house
arrest, sold nuclear information to Iran,
North Korea and Libya; the terrifying
prospect is that other engineers could be
selling similar information to even more
malevolent customers.
Readers will notice that the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the international
economy (or the domestic economy, for
that matter) are not on the list; neither is
Medicare, education, or other campaign
promises. These omissions only further
underscore the point that Obama cannot
singlehandedly lead on all these issues.
Not directly.
A favorite book of mine growing up
was Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card.
In one passage, Card explains the successful strategy young Ender employed in
leading his "Dragon Army" to victory: his
army won not because Ender was a brilliant tactician, but because his officers
were excellent leaders in of themselves.
They were confident in giving orders
without constant affirmation from the
chief.
Like Ender, Barack Obama must be
wise enough to put competent people in
the right diplomatic positions, and give
them sufficient autonomy to get the job
done. Robert Livingston vastly overstepped his bounds in France when he
negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, but
only because he realized a tremendous
opportunity when he saw one. And the
more space American diplomats get to
work with, the more vigorously and creatively they will work for peace in places
where peace has been forsaken.

Employee free choice act vital
To the Editor:

The Employee Free Choice Act will be
one of the most important pieces of legislation protecting American workers, including young workers just entering the work-

place.

The current economic crisis is no

longer news to workers struggling to support themselves and their families, or to
young people entering the workforce who
find that they are making less than their
parents did. Many job seekers are finding
that job security and employer-provided

New legislation called the Employee
Free Choice Act will tip the balance a little
bit away from the pro-big business labor
laws.
As a member of Swarthmore Labor
Action Project, I am writing in support of
the Employee Free Choice Act. The
Employee Free Choice Act would level the
playing field by strengthening penalties
against offending employers; requiring

mediation and arbitration to help employers and employees
reach a first contract in a reasonable period of time; and, permitting workers to
form a union through "majority sign-up"
or card check, a process in which workers
present signed authorization cards as
demonstration of their choice to belong to
a union.
President Obama pledged his support
for the Employee Free Choice Act during
his campaign. We thank Senator Casey
and Representative Sestak for their support of the Employee Free Choice Act in
the last Congressional session, and we call
on Senators Casey and Specter and
Representative Sestak to ensure the swift
passage of this legislation.

Pass the stimulus bill, but drop the protectionism
After ironing out a few remaining differences on
Wednesday afternoon, the Senate and the House negotiated a final stimulus bill that, according to the The New
York Times, "stands to become the most expansive antirecession effort by the United States since World War II."
Members of Congress are hopeful that the House and the
Senate will vote on therevised stimulus package as early
as Thursday.
There is little doubt that a stimulus bill is necessary.

Republicans and an increasingly vocal Democratic
minority had suggested that it should be. But as glad as
we are that the stimulus package is a step closer to being
enacted, there are some provisions in the original House
and Senate bills that, if they made it into the final bill,
should be drastically altered.
A section of the Senate's proposed stimulus package
mandated that the funds from the stimulus package could
not be used "unless all of the iron, steel and manufactured goods used in the projects are produced in the

included a similar protectionist measure. Both bills disincreases in food stamps and

erected their own tariffs and worked to develop new
avenues of trade. Not surprisingly, it appears that
America's sudden embrace of protectionism has prompted similar complaints by our trading partners, and similar threats of retaliation.
European Union Ambassador John Bruton expressed
worry about the protectionist measures proposed by the
United States, noting that Americans had promised not to
resort to protectionism at an earlier meeting in
November and that failure to abide by the earlier agreement could cause the world to "enter into a spiral of protectionist measures around the globe that can only hurt
our economies further." He added later, "There is always
the possibility of retaliatory measures to be taken."
Indeed, many politicians involved with the stimulus
bill have come out strongly against the proposed measures.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, rightly
acknowledged the danger of the earlier stimulus plan's
"Buy American" clause and suggested that it would set
off "trade wars." Already, European steel manufacturers
have laid out plans for suing the United States at the
World Trade Organization if the protectionist clause is
not dropped.

And President Obama, who had previously displayed
a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards free trade, has
come out strongly against the "Buy American" clause. "I
think it would be a mistake, though, at a time when
worldwide trade is declining, for us to start sending a
message that somehow we're just looking after ourselves
and not concerned with world trade," he said in an interview on Fox News. Obama must tread very carefully if,
indeed, some of the earlier "Buy American" measures
have crept into the final bill.
We do not know enough about the final stimulus bill to
make any concrete recommendations. But we will be
clear: The stimulus bill needs to be passed as quickly a
possible, and it must be passed without any protectionist
measures.

Bold squash team stuns Bard
BY ANDREW GREENBLATT

agreen3@swarthmore.edu

Among the athletic facilities on Swarthmore's
quiet campus lies an old building. The dirty windows shroud the inside, covering the relatively
unknown squash courts, the relatively unused
squash courts. This mysterious building is where
Swarthmore's newly formed club squash team does
not practice. The facility goes unused altogether
except by the soccer and lacrosse teams, who run

drills there when the field house is taken and the
fields are out of commission.
Usually, something new draws a lot of attention.
A new television show is met with commercial
hype. Movies are the same way. Most impressive of
all are the new faces in sports. Rookie phenoms get
eaten up by the press. From the debut of Sidney
Crosby to those of Lebron James and Carmelo
Anthony, there are few things more exciting than a
new sensation.
Now, Swarthmore College has a new sensation of
its own, but much like their facility, they are overlooked. The Swarthmore club squash team was
founded last semester by Tarit Rao-Chakravorti 'l2.
Now, he and teammates Manuk Garg 'l2, Rahul
Garg 11, Jason Yun 'l2, Rakan Nimr 'l2 and Jora
Dhaliwal 'l2 have made history. These six students
did something extraordinary last weekend: despite
having come into existence only in late November,
they took down a Bard college squash team that has
been a varsity program for 18 years. Even more
impressive than the victory was the effort and
resolve it took to hold the match in the first place.
Rao-Chakravorti has been playing squash since
his youth and came to Swarthmore from the
acclaimed Milton Academy in Boston, which is
home to one of the most successful high school
squash programs of all-time. "If I couldn't play
squash, I don'tknow if I could have stayed at Swat,"
Rao-Chakravorti said. "I started by e-mailing the
ADs at both Haverford and Swarthmore." He initially tried to play for Haverford's team, but was
denied because he isn't a student there. "So I tried
to start my own team," he said. He put an ad in the
RSD and held a meeting for anyone interested, but
to his dismay, "only two other people showed up."
Rao-Chakravorti found more interested students
by talking to classmates and generally spreading
interest. The six-player team is registered under
the Collegiate Squash Association as an "emerging

team," which is a label specifically for schools with
newly-formed squash programs, and it plays matches with their top five players rather than their top
seven, like standard varsity programs. But numbers weren't the new team's only obstacle.
"We had to take over the charter from the
already existing squash club. I had to e-mail a ton of
people at Haverford and figure out our practice
schedule there, and we had to front the money for
the CSA registration," Rao-Chakravorti explained.
The challenges seemed to never end. In addition to
these obstacles, transportation has also been a main
concern.
Because of insufficient funds and the unavailability of any school vans, the team had to borrow a
car just to make it to Bard, and had to play Lafayette
College on the same day to avoid the hassle of
another travel day. "The two matches we had to
play in one day was not a normal thing. Squash is
exhausting so that's pretty tough," Rao-Chakravorti
said.
Bard agreed to play Swarthmore under emerging team rules, so Bard played their top five against
the Swarthmore only five. Swarthmore blew them
out of the water, taking four out of five matches.
The excitement of this team's accomplishments
thus far is only outshined by their prospective
future. Despite late registration, the Swarthmore
team will be competing in this year's Collegiate
Squash Nationals at Princeton University in New
Jersey, February 20-22. "After reading Tarit's RSD
post, this team has been much more successful than
I thought it would be. I thought it would just be like
a club where we played each other. I never thought
we'd go to nationals and I'm really happy about it,"
Yun said.
"It's incredible how this has evolved into a varsity team," added Garg, who has been through this
before; his high school didn't have a varsity squash
team. "With no courts and no coach, just a couple of
guys, in just a few months we've formed this competitive team."

Nationals will pose a new challenge to the young
team. Currently, the team has no way of getting to
Princeton. Even with SBC funding, the team has
$2OO to allot to jerseys and transportation.
Despite these challenges, such an opportunity is
truly phenomenal. Competing at nationals will be a
challenge, but finding a way to get to Princeton will
be even more of one. Still, something about this
team's history says they'll figure it out.

Still winless in conference, men's basketball struggles
BY JARED NOLAN

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore men's basketball continued to experience difficulties in the
Centennial Conference last week, dropping games at McDaniel (16-5,11-3 CC) and
Dickinson (10-10, 4-10 CC). The two losses
kept the Garnet winless in-conference
while the overall record sank to 1-19 (0-14
CC).

In both games Swarthmore played
stretches of solid, competitive basketball,
but a season-long epidemic eventually put
both games out ofreach: in the two games
combined the Garnet shot 32.8 percent,
making only 39 of their 119 attempted field
goals. McDaniel and Dickinson together
sank 52 of 116 shots, or 44.8 percent.
Swarthmore simply could not score
enough baskets to have a chance at winning.

The shooting percentage really does
tell the whole story. In the Dickinson
game particularly, the Garnet addressed
the other main areas of concern in their
play. The Garnet committed three fewer
turnovers, scored the same number of
points in the paint, scored seven more
points off turnovers, and allowed only one
more second chance point than the Red

also lacked potency. Ordonez identified
Dickinson senior Tom Leszczynski, who
recorded game highs of 19 points and 19
rebounds, as the main source of trouble.
"We had a very difficult time with their 6'

to push him off the block, which is what I
usually do against my opponents,"
Ordonez said, noting that his inability to
do so "allowed them to get him the ball
deep in the post, where he was able to take
advantage of his height."
After sitting out the last five games,
Danny Walker 'lO returned to the hardwood against Dickinson and gave the
Garnet a boost. Coming off the bench,
Walker registered 24 minutes with nine
points and three blocks. "I think he is getting his legs back, but for the most part he
didn't miss a beat," Allen said.
The next game for Swarthmore is back
at home in Tarble Pavilion. The Garnet
face off against Gettysburg (14-6,9-5 CC) at
4 PM. Even though the Garnet have been
eliminated from playoff contention, they
plan on finishing the season strong. "We
need to focus in, have pride, and play
hard, especially for our lone senior, Raul,"
Allen said. "He has played so hard for us
all year and we owe it to him."

Track makes big strides The downside of winning
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu

Usually, track runners train outdoors even during the indoor season,
but lately, icy conditions have relegated them to the indoor track. Despite
the recent bouts of inclement weather, the men's and women's indoor
track teams have logged impressive

results over the past two weeks. After
competing at Haverford's Seamus
McElligott Invitational two weekends
University
ago,
the
Widener
Invitational last Saturday, and once
again at Haverford for a quad meet on
Monday, the teams are now preparing
for
the Centennial Conference
Championship on Feb. 27-28, and ultimately, for the upcoming spring season.
The winter season serves as an
extended tune-up for many athletes as
they prepare to compete in their premier events in the spring. Ashley
Davies 'lO, who ran a top time for the
Garnet in the 5K at the Haverford
Invitational, explains that the prevailing attitude is to "use indoor mainly
as a training ground." As such, she
explains, the athletes focus less on
speed and more on keeping fresh and
getting into top condition for the
spring. For some, the indoor track
season serves as a transition between
the fall and spring sports seasons that
allows lacrosse, baseball or softball
players to get a jump-start on spring
training.

sive finishes in the endurance events.
Top distance runner Nyika Corbett 'lO

returned to the track with a win in
the 5000, running a top time of
18:40.23. Meanwhile, Hannah Rose 'l2,
Ada Okun 11 and Rebecca Woo 'll ran
2-3-4 in the 3000. Natalie Stone 'O9 was
fourth in the 800 in 2:30.47, while
Davies ran fifth in the mile with a
time of 5:46.35.
Also running well for the Garnet
this season is Kenyetta Givans 'l2.
The hurdles specialist clocked a time
of 8.81 in the 55m hurdles, launching
her into second place. Givans was
also sixth in the 200 m with a time of
28.05 and had a fifth-place finish in
the 400 with 1:04.84, behind Stone,
who was third with 1:03.38. Bess
Ritter 'O9 was the top Garnet finisher
in the mile, finishing fifth in a solid
5:19.72.
Givans has been a pleasant surprise for the Garnet. Her early-season
times have gotten her within a tenth
of a second of the school record for the
55m hurdles, which bodes well for the
rest of this season and her career. Her
time of 8.81 at Haverford was a career
best. For good measure, Givans added
a victory at the Widener Invitational
last weekend, running a respectable
8.9 L But she isn't satisfied yet. "I
would really, really love to run somewhere in 8.6 range," she said. As for
keeping fresh, Givans and head coach
Pete Carroll have decided not to quit
while they are ahead. Although she
has talked about taking a couple of
weeks off from the hurdles, she won't
be doing so anytime soon.
In addition to their stellar performances on the track, the women

runner, Davies hopes to run both the

later this month. Davies believes that
it is strategy, rather than individual
specialties, that determines entrants
for the Centennial meet. Athletes are
often entered in events that they are
able to score in, depending on the
strengths of the conference, in order
to maximize team points.
A number of the women have been
running well this winter, a promising
sign for the spring season. Caitlin
Mullarkey 'O9 has continued to dominate the 800, establishing a
Centennial-leading time of 2:19.59 on
her way to second place in the 30woman field. Mullarkey hopes to
regain her 2007 800 m Centennial
Conference title, after finishing second in the event at last year's conference meet.

Swimming bids adieu to seniors, drowns Dickinson

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MADDIE WILLIAMS

mwillil@swarthmore.edu

When asked to name some standout
swimmers at the Dickinson meet, Garnet
head coach Sue Davis simply replied,
"Everyone."

The Swarthmore men's and women's
swim teams certainly had a strong showing at this Saturday's home meet against
Dickinson College. The men's team finished out the day with a score of 119-86.
On the women's side, the team secured a
Garnet victory with a final score of 11194. "Both the men's and women's teams,
across the board, swam their hearts out,"
Coach Davis said. Neil Palmer "12 echoed
this sentiment, saying "we all swam well.
You can pick out individuals who did the
best, but everyone had really good performances overall."
The meet commenced with a small
ceremony honoring the team's seniors
and their numerous accomplishments.
The team bid goodbyes to Jessica
Pritchett 'O9 and Laura Rainey 'O9 from
the women's team, and to Doug GilchristScott 'O9, Thomas Kelleher 'O9, Blaise
Sheridan 'O9, Guy Seaton 'O9 and Stephan
Shymon 'O9 from the men's squad.
"The seniors as a whole will be sorely
missed," Davis said. Specifically, she
continued, "Doug Gilchrist-Scott is one
of the best swimmers we've had at
Swarthmore." She also cited Shymon as
"one of the best distance swimmers in
the history of Swarthmore." Indeed, the
talented pair account for five of six
school records in the freestyle. Shymon
has recorded the Swarthmore top times
in the 500-, 1000- and 1650-yard freestyles,
while Gilchrist-Scott has Swarthmore
bests in the 50- and 100-yard sprints to his
credit.

Distance swimmers Stephen Shymon (center) and Derrick Kao (far right) at the start of the 1000-yard freestyle. Shymon's seasonbest time of 10:15.37 leads the Centennial Conference.

In the 200-yard butterfly, Miller eked
out the win with a time of 2:16.11.
Finishing just barely behind her were
teammates Casey Osborn 'lO and Naomi
Glassman 'l2, clocking in respectively at
2:16.42 and 2:17.41.
Both Miller and

Osborn posted season-best times in this
event.

Miller completed her trio of triumphs
in the 500-yard freestyle, finishing first
at 5:26.78. Right behind her was Bishop
in a time of 5:29.12. Bedolfe came in
fourth at 5:38.66. Once again, all three
swimmers achieved season-best times in
this event.
In the women's 200-yard IM,
Swarthmore fixed a solid victory, sweeping the top three spots. Osborn claimed
the win at 2:20.56. Su finished next with
a time of 2:2L22, followed by Rosalie
Su and
Lawrence 'l2 at 2:23.96.
Lawrence continued their success in the

All eyes on Swarthmore as fencing hosts tourney
BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@s warthmore.edu
While most Swarthmore students spent Sunday reflecting on
their weekends and beginning to
prepare for another week of class-

es, the Swarthmore club fencing
team
hosted the Southern
Atlantic
Conference Fencing
Championship at the Lamb Miller

Field House.
The competition, called SAC
for short, is the largest of four

regional tournaments used to
seed competitors in the upcoming
United States Association of

University, U.S. Naval Academy,
University of Pittsburgh, SUNY

and the College of William and

in addition to host

Swarthmore.

The tournament was held over
the course of two days. The
women competed at Strath Haven
Middle School on Saturday, while
competition resumed on Sunday
as the men took to the floor in the

the national tournament in 2010.

Indeed, the atmosphere in the

average sports fan might expect to

"The electricity in the crowd

seemed more like a football or

Women's basketball aims for big send-off for Grigs
BY ANDREW GREENBLATT
agreen3@swarthmore.edu

"There are a couple of games that we
would really like to have back, but our
focus is now on these last few, none of
which will be easy," said the Garnet
women's basketball team's lone senior,
Melissa Grigsby 'O9. The most recent of
those "last few" to which she referred was
a game against Muhlenberg who has
already clinched a playoff spot and is
ranked in the top 25 teams in the country.
The Garnet suffered a 78-55 loss on Tuesday
to the Mules.
Grigsby eyes the playoff picture as simple: "Win and we're in." However, with an
8-7 record in the conference, the Garnet
may not have that luxury for the remainder of their season. Currently, Muhlenberg,
Johns Hopkins, and McDaniel sit at the top
of the standings, with Dickinson, Franklin
and Marshall and Gettysburg behind them,
all tied with a record of 9-6, Swarthmore
sits at 8-7, short of a playoff spot by a couple
of games. Three games remain in the regular season for Swarthmore, including con-

tests against Gettysburg, Washington and

rival Haverford. Grigsby will be honored at
the Washington game, Senior Day for the
Garnet.
When asked about the season, Grigsby
had nothing but positive things to say.
"This year's team has been phenomenal.
We have had our share of rough spots, but
I have been really impressed with the way
that different people, especially underclassmen, have stepped up to get us
through those," she said. Her nostalgia was
quickly replaced by the intensity that has
characterized her senior season, as she
went on to add, "[ln] the next two weeks,
we need to take one game at a time and
earn ourselves a playoff spot. It comes
down to putting all of our hard work
together and really believing that we can

win."
Coach Renee

DeVarney spoke only in
the highest regard of her senior point

guard. "Melissa's hard work and leadership during pre-season conditioning workouts to her consistent intensity everyday
in practice is the reason we have good team
flow and chemistry. She made a conscious
decision to raise her game, have high
expectations of herself and has shown it by

her work ethic everyday," she said.
DeVarney described Grigsby's impact
throughout her four years on the team as
"profound."
The Garnet have lost two conference
games in a row and must win all three of
their remaining games for their best shot
at the playoffs, but neither the coach nor
the players seem phased. "We have a saying: 'A shot, a stop, one percent.' It means
to strive to get a shot off on every offensive
possession, strive to get a stop on every
defensive possession and strive to be one
percent better everyday. If we really try to
focus on that, we will win some games,"
said DeVarney.
Co-captain Pam Costello 10 is hopeful,
pointing out that the team's mentality was
"still positive" despite the tough losses at
Dickinson and Muhlenberg.
As for Grigsby, the team has truly rallied around their senior leader and point
guard. Costello cited Grigsby's vocal leadership and work ethic as "essential" to the
point guard position. Her teammates
respect her intensity and hard work with
her leadership by example. "You can
always count on that," Ceylan Bodur 'll

remarked. Bodur added that "both the
effort she shows and the speeches she
makes bring out the best in us. She gets
pissed if she thinks we are not giving all we
have. That's why hearing a nice comment,
a 'Good job kid,' from her is worth more
than anything. She makes me want to be
the best I can be. And that's the most
important thing I learned from her."
Grigsby just wants to finish the season
strong and wants more than anything to
see this team make the playoffs. The final
Gettysburg,
