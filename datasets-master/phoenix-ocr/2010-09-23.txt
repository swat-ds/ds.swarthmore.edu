Elizabeth Anker lectures about the effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on modern culture.

BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmalll@swarthmore.edu

Few people would name literature as
one of the things that was impacted by
the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11th,
but according to Elizabeth Anker, assistant professor of English at Cornell
University, modern novels are very
much influenced by the effects of terrorism.
On Monday afternoon, Anker gave a
lecture to a small number of students
and professors titled "Mad Men, Falling
Men, and the 9/11 Novel," describing
the effects of terrorism and how it is
reflected in modern popular culture.
According to Anker, books like
"Saturday,"
by
MacEwan,
lan
"Netherlands by Joseph O'Neill and
the critically-acclaimed television
series "Mad Men" are all influenced by
changing world views following the
attacks. Eric Song, an English professor
who helped bring Anker to campus,
attributed the low attendance to the
time of the lecture, and said people
were probably eating dinner between
4:15 and 6:15.
Anker graduated from Hope College,
received a J.D. from the University of
Chicago and practiced law before
becoming "disillusioned by it," according to English professor Eric Song, who
introduced her. She then received a
Ph.D in English from the University of
Virginia. Now she is working on an
article about novels based around Sept.
Uth. At the end of the lecture, she welcomed questions and criticisms, which
she called "very helpful" in clarifying

20oi

September

her argument.
Anker primarily discussed the way
the "9/11 novels" depict life on the
changed home front after war.
Specifically, she said, "These novels
focus on the crises that arise from meditating on the legacy of American-ness
in the aftermath of 9/1 L" One of the
most important of these crises is that of
frustrated masculinity. She pointed out
that in the fall of the World Trade
Center, even stereotypically masculine
heroic workers, such as firefighters and
police officers, were unable to prevent
much of the devastation.
"In fact, some might say that the
word 'hero' is rendered farcical by the
attacks," Anker said, before quoting
from a novel in which one character
implores another not to use the word to
describe him.
Don Draper, the philandering protagonist of "Mad Men," is a sort of antidote to this dilemma. Though the show
is set in the 19605, Anker claims that it
exemplifies a sort of nostalgic yearning
for a more innocent time. Although Don
Draper is able to engage in many
immoral activities, he is still seen as a
kind of hero.
Anker also said that the 1960s are
now seen as a golden age by many people, who remember it as a simpler time.
Even the Obama family has drawn parallels between themselves and the
Kennedys: both presidents were young,
offered hopeful messages, and were outside the traditional mold of the white
Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
Song enjoyed the lecture, and called
it "fantastic," but not everyone was as

pleased. Danielle Charette 'l4, a student

who had a conversation with Anker
during the question and answer period,
found the talk polarizing. "[Anker]
seemed so hell-bent on believing every
author agreed with her that the West
was at fault for' 9/11 that I think she may
have overlooked crucial aspects of the
novels.
It's possible to enter a sociological/literary discussion of America
in the post 9/11 world without inherently blaming Americans for 9/1 L I found it
peculiar that there was no mention of
terrorism [or] religious extremism,"
she said in an e-mail.
Patrick Ammerman 'l4 thought the
lecture was edifying.
"I thought her presentation was a
very good and... her talk showed its
potential in becoming a great article,"
Ammerman said.
Song, who was responsible for bringing Anker to campus,
initially
approached her to ask for a lecture on
her work in her field of study, human
...

rights.

"The English Department thought
Professor Anker would be a great guest
lecturer at Swarthmore because of the
primary focus of her scholarship."
Anker asked to speak on this topic
instead, since it was more relevant to
her current research.
"She told me that she'd be happy to
share her scholarship, but that she'd
also be excited to share new work about
Mad Men and the 9/11 novel," Song said.
"The English Department thought that
this was such a tantalizing and timely
subject that we took her up on the
offer."

Cosby Courtyard to be
changed into garden

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY AARON FREEDMAN

afreedl@swarthmore.edu

For years, students going to or coming from class in Kohlberg Hall have
passed by the landscaped Cosby
Courtyard that, on good days, provides
a welcoming outdoor sanctuary from
the adjacent classrooms. But students
this year may see some new changes to
the space in honor of the late Spanish

lecturer Joan Friedman.
Friedman, who passed away over
the summer, is being honored by the
college for her many years of service
through a transformation of Cosby
Courtyard into the Joan Friedman Memorial Courtyard.
Currently the project consists of a
conversion of some of the grassy turf in
Cosby Courtyard into a stabilized stone
surface capable of accommodating
benches and potted plants, many of

"This space [the original Cosby
to provide a nearly
seamless extension of the social functions at the ground floor of Kohlberg,
and to invite individuals or groups to
linger in planned or impromptu gatherings," she said. This idea carries on
into the new garden design, according
to Baird, who said that the stone surface "not only accommodates pedestrian flow, but provides an opportunity
for additional gathering space."
But the meaning of the memorial is
not just its garden component. For one,
the space on which it is being created is
the site of the old Parrish Annex, the
building that, until Kohlberg Hall's
(and Cosby Courtyard's) construction
in 1994, held the Modern Languages
department, and thus was Friedman's
first teaching space when she came to
the college in 1987.
Additionally, Friedman was known
to have taken her classes out to Cosby
Courtyard on a number of occasions to
teach them in a more relaxing, more
beautiful outdoor setting. The extension and memorialization of that space
seem's to invite other professors to do
the same with their classes.

itself the most

"We

Joan Friedman as a lecturer is part of
that, leaving a legacy, a memory. But
even when that memory is gone, there
will still be a Swarthmore College that
in some way bears her mark," said
Camacho de Schmidt.
But what this memorial garden
shows is more than just an effort to
properly remember a lost faculty member; it's also a physical indicator of
how dearly appreciated one member of
the Swarthmore community really
was.
"Joan was a dear friend. We met in
the college swimming pool and soon
discovered we shared not only a love of
swimming but a love of gardens. I
shared many wonderful evenings with
Joan and her husband, Joel, in their
garden. As do all her friends I am sure,
I deeply miss her warmth and effervescence," Baird said in an e-mail.
In this sense, probably the truest
intention of the Memorial Garden,
along with the tango concert and
recital to be held in her honor on
October X is to allow those who didn't
know Friedman to try and understand
who she was through something she
loved so much gardening.
"Generations beyond the present
one will know that this college still
bears the imprint of a woman who gave
her full self to the teaching of the
Spanish language," Camacho de
Schmidt said.

Swarthmore is no different. In general,
such a process provides an opportunity for the institution to consider trends
and big issues and to develop future
directions and initiatives. This
process usually involves a generous
period of discourse balanced with a
drive to keep conversations moving
forward.
These conversations are expected to
conclude with a plan for the institution. Most changes would be long-term

college needs to adapt with growing

Chopp also emphasized the importance of alumni involvement.
"We have a little under 20,000 alumni. I see these as resources to be used
for students. We need to think about
how we help students get better network with our alumni," Chopp said.
In order to address the abundance
of issues facing the college, Chopp said
the whole community has to be
involved. StuCo will be playing a large
role in facilitating student involvement in discussions through many
avenues such open meetings, fireside
chats, faculty meetings, town halls and
a new interactive website. The administration hopes that everyone will
share an interest in doing some common readings, including some essays
that will be posted regarding issues
that are impacting higher education.
Chopp wants members of the community to both read these essays and to
bring their own knowledge and experience to the conversations.
In the midst of this influx of change,
Chopp said it is essential that we not
lose sight of our core values. "We want
to continue our long tradition of creating an environment where students
can gain a rigorous and robust academic preparation; at the same time,
we want to foster a sense of service to
the world in many ways and professions," Chopp said.
Chopp said that the community
should feel a sense of readiness and
excitement as we head into this campus-wide discussion.
"This is a great community
process," Chopp said. "It's a time for
everybody to have these big conversations and dream these bold visions and
at the same time keep conversations
about what the essence of Swarthmore
is. It's a wonderful way to bring students, staff, faculty and alumni together and look forward."

Student death on campus prompts changes in PSU
BY MEGAN ROGERS
Dally Collegian, Sept 21
One year after Joe Dado's

the tragedy both heightened

and prompted major risk

(IFC) Vice President for Risk

said the death prompted
changes to existing social

policies. The IFC social policy overhaul last December
was influenced by the aftermath of the incident, Piarulli
(senior-security and risk
analysis) said.
"That incident did have a
lot of impact
on all student
and the way
organizations
we think about risk management," he said.
The social policy enacted
in December
which instituted guest lists and bouncers
and eliminated away bars
and Wednesday social functions
was aimed at lowering emphasis on alcohol and
raising awareness of risk
management.
The tragedy was reflective
of some of the problems within the greek community, former IFC President Luke
Pierce said. Dado's death
allowed the IFC's executive
board to reflect on possible

changes needed, he said.
Dado's death brought common unsafe drinking practices to light, but was not the
sole reason behind social policy changes, IFC President
Max Wendkos said.
"We don't say to ourselves
'Wow, we need to do this or
this because a student passed
away after drinking last
fall,'" Wendkos (senior-marketing and psychology) said.
"We say, 'We need to make
change because overall the
drinking culture at Penn
State is problematic for a
slew of different parties,
including the students themselves.'"
Regardless of whether the
policies were direct results of
Dado's death, Wendkos said
early signs show the policies
imposed over the past year
have been beneficial. But
Pierce
(senior-economics)

said the policy has been "softened," making it more difficult to measure its success.
Dado's death has affected
more than just the greek community, with change coming
at the administrative level,

too.

Before detailing new alcohol mitigation policies at
Friday's Board of Trustees
meeting, Sims touched on the
profound impact of Dado's
death on the community.
Sims said the new alcohol
policies he presented were
crafted with the intention of
preventing a similar incident.
"All students deserve what

talking about what they could

Former Japanese ambassador shares career stories
BY LAUREN KIM
lkiml@swarthmore.edu

.

From Japan's diplomat to
internationalambassador to private secretary to the royal family, Swarthmore alum Makoto
Watanabe '6l has faithfully
served his country from a
diverse array of important positions.
In a roundtable discussion
with students and faculty at the
college last Friday, Watanabe
shared his experiences and
thoughts about being involved
in international diplomacy and
in the services of the Japanese
royal family.

His career began even before
he graduated from Swarthmore.

Watanabe

studied at the
University of Tokyo and became
a part of the Japanese Foreign

Service before he entered
Swarthmore in 1959 as an international student.
Students present at Friday's
talk were impressed with
Watanabe's career and his experiences. The fact that he is a
Swarthmore
alum further
served to add to their wonder
and admiration.
"I was surprised to find out
that he held such respected positions as diplomat and close advisor to the emperor," Michio
Taya 'l3 said after hearing
Watanabe's talk. "It's definitely
encouraging to think that he
came from our school too."
But even this prominent man
had recollections of the challenging academics at Swarthmore
College.
"I think I had never worked

so-hard as I did when I was at
Swarthmore," Watanabe said. "I
had huge reading assignments
that I never could completely
finish."
Aside from the heavy workload at Swarthmore, Watanabe
felt the biggest difference
between, the college and Japan's
educational system was found in
the classroom.
"I was very impressed by the
way classes were carried out in
Swarthmore,"
he
said.

Swarthmore and described how
they helped him in his career.
For him, the ability to see from
many different angles and to
have "broader perspective" was
especially beneficial. The social
knowledge he gained while in
the US also proved to be just as
important.

"The main purpose of my
studying here was to learn about
American society, the American
way of life and the Americans,"
Watanabe said. "In a way, this
knowledge helped me very
much in my career and my dealings with people in the US. I
have many friends from

Swarthmore, but I also developed many relations with others
from over America, which I
think was due to Swarthmore."
Maurice Eldridge, vice president for college and community
relations and executive assistant to the president, was one of
Watanabe's fellow classmates.
Although he had not known
Watanabe on a deep level,
Eldridge said in an interview
that they were both part of what
was then a considerably smaller
international community.
"Some of us were known
enough because we were more
different, because the diversity
of today's Swarthmore is much
richer than the diversity of bur'
Swarthmore," Eldridge said.
Watanabe said that there
were happy moments and difficulties in each stage of his long
career, but that overall, all of
them were very rewarding. He
described what he considers to
be the key traits to his success.
"I think that someone interested in international relations,
or maybe in the government or
the business areas, should consider that the most important
things are human relations and
the desire to understand what
the other side thinks and feels,"
Watanabe said. "It's not just
about what you want. And such
empathy will help develop good
human relations and thus international relations."
The value that Watanabe
placed in establishing meaning-

ful relationships based on deep
thought and care reflected on
him during his school years in
the eyes of classmates. His calm
and dignified attitude from the
past also continues to be displayed to this day.
"He's warm and interested in
people," Eldridge said. "He was,
I think, pretty comfortable and
at ease with himself as a person.
He's somebody who has a certainkind of dignity about him."

After
from
Swarthmore with a major in
political science, he went on to
Washington, D.C. to work at the

making him chief of protocol
and foreign relations advisor to
the emperor of Japan. His most
recently job was grand chamberlain to the current Emperor
Akihito, which lasted from
November of 1996 to 2007.
In an interview, Watanabe
shared his thoughts on the royal
family, saying that they are very
serious about serving their
country and people. He preferred not to view them in such
a light that would alienate them
from being the otherwise "normal" people they are, aside from
being rulers of a nation.
He also visited one of the
introductory Japanese seminar
classes,
led by Professor
Gardner, associate professor of
Japanese and section head of the
department a day prior to the
roundtable discussion.
"[A person in the class] asked
me if I consider them [the royal
family] as God," Watanabe said.
"I never thought about it,
because everyone in Japan just
considers them to be normal
human beings."
The royal family also means
something more for Watanabe.
The special relationship he
shares with them stretches far
back beyond generations.
"In my case, my father was a
friend of [the emperor's] father,"
Watanabe said. "And my greatgrandfather was minister for the
imperial court, and his great-

grandfather before him as well.
So I have some sort of relation to
the family to serve the Emperor.
And because [the Emperor] is
such a humble, genuine and sincere person, it wasn't very
intimidating at all to work for
him."
Watanabe's

Aside from his
Watanabe said that he enjoyed
art-related pastimes as well. At
the roundtable, he shared one of
his hobbies he had started

recently..
"I started to learn Utai, a
singing part of Noh," Watanabe
said. "Noh is a very interesting,
fascinating form of drama that is

a combination of music and
dancing and singing."
Professor and Lecturer of
Japanese Yshiko Jo, however,
said that she had found more in
common with him even before
Friday's talk.
"Many students might forget
the [Japanese] language after
learning, but the experience will
stay, even if at least in some
small part of their body, a muscle, or a memory," Jo said. "That
is one of my goals in teaching
Japanese. One of the things
[Watanabe] pointed out was
exactly what I'm trying to do
here with the students. So I was
very happy to see somebody who
shared some overlap with me."

Paris, the City of Love, lives up to its reputation

Maki Somosot
Small But Classe

I

mmmm

cultural
Certain
stereotypes survive simply for the reason that
they remain true at their
base. Of course, this
grain of truth is often
lampooned and exaggerated beyond recognition
into the shallow caricatures of popular culture.
However, I've quickly
discovered
that
the
stereotype of Paris as the
most romantic city in the
world is much, much
closer to the daily reality
that I experience here

than you would think.
The City of Love transcends its name. Paris is a
city brimming with lovers full of hopes, dreams, and
most of all, raging hormones, regardless of age or
appearance. It is a living, breathing panorama of publicly, and often flagrantly, displayed affection.
In every possible direction, couples are making out
and touching each other in the name of love. I once
witnessed a sophisticated twosome in the Jardin des
Tuileries indulge in a public, half-hour long enlacement, wrapped in each other's well-tailored coats,
murmuring sweet nothings and exchanging kisses.
This stereotypical Parisian scenario never ceases
to delight tourists, even seasoned voyeurs like me.
But it is actually considered a banality here, due to its
frequent occurrence in the Parisian landscape.
Coupledom reigns supreme in Paris as a daily reality,
just like the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame
Cathedral.
The French have apparently learned en masse to
acculturate to this romantic spectacle since birth.
The dynamic propensity for PDA in Paris has also
birthed les drageurs infameux, eager to express their
declarations of love to complete strangers on the
street. Roughly translated into "infamous flirts," this
description refers to Frenchmen on the prowl for
naive foreign women who stroll around Paris alone
and unaccompanied.
Paris is best discovered by hours of aimless wandering through its streets, but adventurous females
doing so remain vulnerable to unwanted male attention.
The most stereotypical incident of this nature happened during my first ever excursion in Paris.
One splendid Parisian afternoon, I sought out some
well-deserved alone time to read for a class project at
the beautiful Jardin des Tuileries. The Jardin is located right next to the Louvre, which guarantees a
tourist population
and therefore drageurs
in the
same overflowing abundance as the flowers, fountains
and marble statues.
In a quiet, shaded spot under a tree, I was busy
reading about the geopolitical divisions of the French
capital when a voice blasted through my happy bubble. The conversation went as follows (verbatim):
"Excuse me if I'm disturbing you, Mademoiselle,
but I find that your face is just so beautiful; I've never
seen anything quite like it," the man ventured in
accented French.
"Merci monsieur, but I'm busy here working. Good
night," I replied ineffectively, too stunned to- remember that the best expression to ward off such men was
'Laissez-moi tranquille,' the equivalent of 'Leave me
alone' in English.
Sensing my shock, the man would not be deterred.
"I don't want to disturb you, mademoiselle, but I
just want to get to know you. Can I please sit down
next to you just for five minutes?"
"I already told you that I'm busy, and I have a book
to read for class. It's not possible," I retorted, but then
made the fatal mistake of laughing and smiling at
him. The man pouted, misreading my smiles as reciprocal flirtation. "Can I please have your number any-

way?" he pursued. Only after shaking my head
numerous times did he finally process the rejection
and walk away.
While flattering, the novelty of the situation soon
wears off after encountering even dodgier types of the
Frenchman drague. Barely two days later, I experienced something that could be classified as sexual
harassment by American statute and something that
apparently happens often for no reason in French elevators.
One night, two guys and a girl who were smokinr

smirked but recoiled in his corner.
So far, this had been the most blatantly tactile act
of drague that had ever been attempted on me. I was
left unimpressed by my close encounters, whose utter
heights of absurdity surpassed even my strongest psychological barriers.
My cultural stupefaction was shared by most of the
other foreign students in my program. An American
friend was also having trouble staving off male interest from several mecs chelous, otherwise known as
"sketchy" men, who lived in our dormitory. She was
continuously bothered for her cell-phone number,
hounded about her romantic availability and propositioned to participate in dubious activities.
A certain Hershey (name changed for obvious reasons), with whom I also had the pleasure of a person-

al encounter, urged us to "never hesitate to pass by
his room," if and whenever we were "in need" of
something.
/

Another rule of thumb for foreign women
sojourning in Paris: Never engage in a conversation with a friendly, talkative stranger at
night, as much as you want to practice your
French and forge new local acquaintances. In
other words, do not expect that your conversational tendencies will translate sa fluidly across
cultural borders. If you fall prey to this situation,
you will more than likely find yourself followed
back to your dorm in the dead of night by a
stranger claiming to want to get to know you.
Another well-meaning American friend of

her French with a real flesh-and-blood
Parisian, had engaged in this kind of nocturnal conversation on the Metro. Much to her
horror, the friendly stranger, whom she found
she couldn't evade, followed her all the way back
to her dorm at three in the morning.
A possible antidote to this situation would
be to feign an inability to speak French, or a
much better solution, as I've found, would be
to ignore the attention altogether, which
i doesn't require any interaction with the mec
\ chelou concerned.
\
These anecdotes don't disprove, or
much less, deconstruct the stereotype; however, they are nevertheless veritable
accounts. It has been refreshing to find the
wholesome few Frenchmen in Paris who can
keep their hands to themselves. Through random
encounters, I have made the acquaintance of several
male college students who do not live up to the mec
chelou stereotype. Far from being drageurs, they are
nice and sweet and frequently invite us out to socialize with the French university crowd.
Whether I will continue to meet more of this
blessed non-stereotypical kind remains to be seen. All
hope is not lost.
In the meantime, I am going to seriously reconsider my partiality toward taking the elevator over the
stairs in this city.

Emmy-nominated film preserves dying languages
On average, one world language disappears every two
weeks. Half of the world's 7,000 languages are on the
verge of extinction and scientists warn that these dialects
will disappear by the end of the century.
Dr. David Harrison, associate professor of linguistics,
along with fellow researcher Dr. Gregory Anderson,
chronicled their journey around the globe to preserve
dying languages in their documentary "The.Linguists."
Before its television debut on PBS, "The Linguists" was
an official selection at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.
Recently, the National Academy of Television Arts &
Sciences nominated the film for an Emmy award for
Outstanding Science and Technology Programming. The
results will be announced next week on September 27.
The pair of linguists met in the U.S. prior to their year
abroad in Siberia for dissertation research in graduate
school. Their collaboration, now nearing ten years, began
upon their return to the States. Now, the duo travels
extensively on a series of expeditions under The
Enduring Voices Project, which is a partnership between
the National Geographic Mission Programs and the
Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages.
Living Tongues, led by Harrison and Anderson, is a nonprofit dedicated to language preservation.
Harrison, as a phonologist, specializes in the study of
languages' sound patterns and the rules for combining
such sounds. He is also an advocate of the need to
approach -a language holistically by coupling abstract
study with field expeditions. "Languages have great
to the speakimportance to the people who own them
ers
because they encode cultural knowledge that has
been passed down and that isn't available anywhere else,
hasn't been written down and cannot be 'googled',"
Harrison said in an interview.
Preservation methods, as demonstrated in "The
Linguists," can be streamlined into two categories: documentation and revitalization. Using digital voices to create high quality recordings, the linguists begin by first
sitting down to speak with native speakers. Other measures follow, such as transcription and the building of
word lists, all of which fall under documentation. In revitalization, linguists aid communities that have made a
strategic decision to preserve their endangered language.
Expedition teams help natives publish books, and also
develop talking dictionaries and other digital technologies.

One of Harrison's students, Theresa Sepulveda 'll,
built a computerized talking dictionary for a language
with only 600 speakers in Papua, New Guinea. Since the
community will have internet access within the year, the
speakers will be able to both see and hear their dialect
online. "I think it will send a very powerful message that
theirlanguage is just as good as any other, that they don't
have to give it up," Harrison said.
In the film, Harrison and Anderson travel from
Siberia to India and Bolivia in an effort to preserve three
moribund languages: Chulym in Siberia; Sora in Orissa,
India; and Kallawaya in Bolivia. "The Linguists" also features one of the last remaining speakers of Chemehuevi,
which is spoken by only three to five speakers in the
Colorado River Indian Reservation in western Arizona.
Spoken in Russia, Chulym has fewer than 25 speakers
and is considered the most endangered language native
to Siberia. Though Sora, native to east India, has between
150,000 and 300,000 speakers, its future is bleak. Due to the
violent Maoist insurgency, the tribal youth have been
driven from their native communities to boarding
schools where they are taught Hindi and English and are
discouraged from using their native tongue. Harrison
and Anderson stressed the challenges of traveling in the
province amidst the armed insurgency.
Venturing into the challenging terrain of the Andes
Mountains in Bolivia, the team studied Kallawaya. The
language is taught primarily to males and has survived
for centuries, but now has fewer than 100 speakers.
In Bolivia, in addition to the challenge of the difficult
terrain, the team had to make a few special arrangements
to establish a contact language, which is used when two
groups who share no native language need to communicate. The contact language in Bolivia was Spanish, and
since neither Harrison nor Anderson are particularly
competent in the language, the duo was accompanied by

THE PHOENIX

a Bolivian linguist and also a Spanish-speaking student.
In Siberia and India, the contact languages were more
easily established since Anderson and Harrison both
speak Russian and in India, the majority of natives vary
in degrees of competency in English.
Considering some of the site's challenges, Harrison
stressed that any and all of the obstacles are "counterbalanced by the fact that all these communities that we work
with are incredibly hospitable."
The cultural knowledge specific to these communities
contributes to a global knowledge base, since dialects
relay information about indigenous environments and
traditions. "So, if we care about things like climate
change, global warming and scarcity, we should care
about the human knowledge base, which is encoded in
these languages," said Harrison.
Charlie Huntington 'l2 worked in Harrison's
Endangered Languages Lab over the summer. In a recent
e-mail, he said, "Each language reflects the ways in which
its people perceive the world, and thus offers insight into
the unique character of its culture; when a language is
lost, so is that knowledge."
Language preservation, although a scientific endeavor, is also an important human rights issue. "What language you speak on the street or in business are determined by large social factors, but people shouldn't be discriminated against because of what language they choose
to speak at home," Anderson said.
"I'm delighted that the film has found a global audi-

are now aware of language endangerment and extinction," said Harrison. "I think that's a great thing!"

Swat Style Snapshot
Current Residence: Willets
What He's Wearing:
"I'm wearing Ralph Lauren, folded cropped shorts,"
Onyekwuluje said. His black button-down shirt is Calvin
Klein and his leather jacket is from Express. His mother
gave him the colorful, feminine scarf worn as a headband.

His bracelets are from Venezuela and Nigeria, and his
favorite necklace is from Venezuela as well.
It may be the autumnal equinox on Thursday, but
we're still in the transition from summer to fall in terms
offashion. Onyekwuluje hits the transitional look perfectly, with his edgy, leather jacket and black button-down
paired with the rolled-up summer shorts.
How He Describes His Style:
"Last year, it was almost completely different,"
Onyekwuluje said of his style. "It was less of me and more
of what I thought was cool and in." But after his recent volunteer trip in a rural village in Venezuela, Onyekwuluje
has a completely different outlook. "I was working a lot
and it was very hot in the sun, so comfort really took a big
forefront," he said. After visiting a more metropolitan city,
Onyekwuluje realized that he couldn't always' walk
around looking like, as he puts it, "a hot mess."
Onyekwuluje developed a comfortable chic style and tries
to "jazz up this tiber-comfortable look." Others describe
his new style as "The Survivalist," (a play on The
Sartorialist for those who aren't blog friendly), because of
his love of the outdoors look.
"I like finding random materials and making things up
myself;" Onyekwuluje said, adding that he also mixes
more expensive items, like Lacoste or Dolce and Gabbana
with something from the Gap or Abercrombie.
Fashion Influences/Inspiration:
"I'm really into androgyny," Onyekwuluje said. "I'll
take very masculine things, like very masculine shirts or
shoes or shirts
and just add feminine touches to it and
it comes out very androgynous.w *He cited Lindsey Lohan,
Naomi Campbell, Beyonce and Brad Pitt as sources of
inspiration, all of which have very fierce personal styles
though Pitt rocks the scruffier and more outdoor look.
Onyekwuluje also loves Marc Jacobs.

admits he loses things frequently.
"Recently, I'm really into Moose Jaw.
It's like all this outdoor gear, it's very

North Face affiliated brand. "That's
how I feel lately" very adventurous."

tice," Onyekwuluje loves the feminine
aspects of the scarf, which fits in well with
his androgynous style in pairing It with the,,
edgier, masculine leather jacket.
Wardrobe Staples:
"Definitely one of my favorite things to
wear are my cowboy boots," Onyekwuluje
said. Hailing from Kentucky, it's fitting that he
loves pairing his "legit" cowboy boots with
more modern items, like skinny jeans. He pur-

chased his boots in Kentucky and uses them t(

"My necklaces
and my cell phone,"
Onyekwuluje said. His favorite necklaces are a
leather string with a crocodile tooth and the necklace in
the picture, with an elephant carved into a tooth. "They're
both from South America and it's kind of like an inspiration because I want to go to medical school and when
I'm done, I want to do Doctors Without Borders in South
America," Onyekwuluje said.

TEXT AND PHOTO BY CAMILA RYDER

Teaching the campus to breathe through art
BY SERA JEONG
sjeongl@swarthmore.edu

"Layered, interconnected and inquisi-

tive" are three words artist, educator, and
cultural worker Pato Hebert uses to

describe his work. The artist utilizes an
extensive range of media, from photography to text-based installation, but always
strives toward a synthesis of aesthetics
and ethics. This unique approach to art is
what brings the artist to Swarthmore.

Based in Los Angeles, Hebert teaches at
Art Center College of Design in Pasadena
and works at the AIDS service organization "Aids Project Los Angeles." For the
next 10 days, Hebert's art installation,
"Signing On: Creative Interventions and
the Mobilization of the Imagination," will
be on campus as part of the Cooper Series.
Hebert's work will be exhibited in McCabe
Library, the Scott Arboretum and other
sites on campus.
Sarah Willie-Leßreton, associate professor of sociology, met Hebert two years
ago at Haverford College and was drawn to
his "authentic compassion for other people." It was this quality and his desire to
"help people figure out who they best are"
that motivated Willie-Leßreton to nominate Hebert to take part in the Cooper

Series.

Vice-President Maurice Eldridge, who

10

oversees the Cooper Series, explains that
the William J. Cooper Foundation is used

to bring annual series of preeminent lecturers, artists and performers to the college to "enrich the academic and cultural
life on campus." Access to the wide-ranging series is not limited to students, but is
open to the wider community.
The exhibition in _ McCabe mainly
focuses on a photographic project "Trying
to Catch Your Breath," a series of images of
air. Photographs from these series have
been placed throughout the main floor of
the library and a text-based installation
has been placed on the doors of McCabe.
The arboretum installation "Intentional
Grounding" will be an ongoing project

compiled by members of the college and
will be installed on Thursday evening after
5 p.m. Hebert will also speak to his previous works, his work in HIV prevention
and his installations at Swarthmore at a
campus-wide lecture today, Thursday
Sept. 23 at 4 p.m. in the Scheuer Room.
Hebert said that as an undergraduate,
his interests in art, politics and progressive social change led him to realize "art
could be part of social change." Hebert primarily concerns himself with the synthesis of these interests into a sociallyengaged art practice. Specifically, Hebert
defines his work as the "intersection of
ethics, aesthetics and the poetics of

things."

It
is
fitting that
Hebert's unconventional
work has been brought to
Swarthmore in an inter-

disciplinary fashion. The
installation is a collabora-

tive effort between Andrea
Packard
of the List
Gallery, Willie Leßreton
and McCabe librarian
Pamela Harris.
However, the unconventional exhibition sites
were not part of Hebert's
initial intention; the List
Gallery was not available

due to scheduling reasons.

Yet Hebert describes "site

and space" as important

The above piece, found on the second floor of Kohlberg,
is an example of Hebert's work across campus.

components of his work,
and there was always an
intention for his exhibition
to have both indoor and outdoor aspects.
Hebert hopes the exhibition will
deliver to the student body a "space
where they can push themselves and one
another to deepen their own practice"
but is ready to accept the possibility that

"the work fails to do anything for
Swarthmore.'" On the other hand, WillieLeßreton has no doubt the exhibition
will

have

"great

synergy

with

Swarthmore students and the college's

values."
Willie-Leßreton says that Hebert has
"taken education, art, concern for larger
society, public health and made a wonderful thing." There may yet be hope for

Swatties to contrive a valid career from

their varied interests.
The exhibition in McCabe will run
through Oct. 22 and the Arboretum installation will be up until Oct. 3.

Energy-saving green roofs spruce up buildings
BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT
qgounotl@swarthmore.edu
As awareness of environmental issues has increased,
student groups such as Good Food, Earthlust and the
Green Advisors have formed and grown in order to tackle
these issues. But in addition to student efforts, the college
has also been attempting to increase its commitment to
green technology through the installation of green roofs
on campus.
There are currently three main green roofs at
Swarthmore: the storage building adjacent to Papazian
has one, as do residence halls Alice Paul and David Kemp.
A first roof was installed on Papazion in 2002; a smaller
roof, covering only 630 square feet, it allowed the college a
low-scale trial before undertaking any larger projects.
Shortly thereafter, plans were made for a 5,100 square foot
green roof, above the third floor of Alice Paul, which was
installed in 2004. In 2008, David Kemp was equipped with
a five-level, 8,600 square foot green roof.
According to Scott Arboretum literature on green
design, green roofs are "vegetated roof tops, comprised of
a waterproof synthetic membrane topped with growing
media and plants." The kind of green roof at Swarthmore
is known as "extensive." As opposed to "intensive" green
roofs, which support much thicker layers of foliage and
even trees, "extensive" roofs accommodate a thinner, more
modest set of plants and no trees. Intensive roofs are also

sometimes used to grow fruit and vegetables.
A variety of vegetation can be
are-^-^gj.—j—,*planted on these roofs. The
Arboretum staff recommends "low growing, shalI) low rooted, perennial"

\

plants. They emphasize

the need for these plants
to be resilient, withstanding such natural
Ife adversities as temperature variations, wind,
drought, disease and
insects. It is also important to

I

™

consider the proximity of a water source and the water
retention capacities of the selected plants.
The main plant on the Papazian green roof is the
Sedum sarmentosum, which has taken over virtually all
other plants. "It's a good and a bad thing," said Gus
Eriksen, garden supervisor of the Scott Arboretum. As a
sedum, he explained, this plant is highly succulent, which
is a major aim of a green roof, but the invasive plant could
affect other plants from growing successfully.
In contrast, the vegetation on the green roofs on Alice
Paul and David Kemp is more varied, spanning a wide
assortment of species and colors. David Kemp boasts red
sedum rupestre and Deslosperma nubigerum, which is a
bright yellow flower. The careful selection process at play
here looks for plants that are both biologically diverse and
aesthetically pleasing.
From an environmental standpoint, these roofs are
beneficial insofar as they mitigate the effects of stormwater runoff. Eriksen explained that before we lived in
such densely constructed urban areas, rain water had a lot
more opportunities to seep back into the ground. But the
current landscape results in more erosion and runoff.
Green roofs also present significant financial advantages. While the initial investment is higher than for other
roofs, green roofs enjoy a much longer life. By reducing
temperature variations and protecting the actual roof
from the negative effects of ultraviolet light, the vegetation on green roofs extends their life by two to three times.
These roofs also have a significant cooling and insulating
effect. As such, the Arboretum estimates that they allow
for as much as a 25% reduction in cooling energy requirements for the top floor of multi-storey buildings like David

Kemp.
Swarthmore's green roofs are also visually appealing,
and the roofs boast a habitat for all kinds of songbirds and
insects, like'grasshoppers, bees and dragonflies. Yet safety
measures forbid access to the roofs outside of guided

tours.

Claire Sawyers, the director of the Scott Arboretum,
shared her dream of having green roofs that can be open
to the community in the future. "It'd be great to have a
green roof that is a living space for students to study and"*

Olivia Natan Phoenix Staff

The green roof on David Kemp residential hall was
installed in 2008 and is among the three green roofs
currently on campus.
hang out in," Sawyers said.
However, the roofs remain fairly unknown to many
members of the college community. Even though there are
tours and the College has received extensive praise for the
roofs, many students have yet to learn about the roofs.
Several residents of Alice Paul and David Kemp who were
asked about the roofs reported knowing "very little" about
.them.

Engineering professor Carr Everbach was the one who
first asked to have green roofs installed on campus residence halls. In a 2003 Environmental Studies Capstone
Seminar, Everbach and others made clear Swarthmore's
opportunity and responsibility to lead in this area. There
has been discussion of giving several other Swarthmore
buildings new green roofs.
These plans are mostly uncertain for the time being,
but the next green roof on campus will be on the Wister
Center, near the Arboretum.

Both Phoenix and Gazette should have list of e-mails
As The Phoenix finished creating an
electronic "news digest" last semester, we
asked the dean's office for the ability to
send our news in a weekly, opt-out e-mail
to students.
Since The Daily Gazette has had this
privilege for years, The Phoenix figured
this was a simple request. But now,
months later, we have been met with
senseless delays and roadblocks.
Dean of Students Liz Braun has the
final say on the issue. She did, however,
ask Student Council to make a recommendation based on student opinion.
At its Sunday meeting, StuCo voted
that only the Gazette should have access
to the student e-mail list. We, The
Phoenix, ask Braun to consider our case
and grant both The Phoenix and Daily
Gazette access.
Not granting The Phoenix access
would nullify the timeand energy that we
as a student group have put toward our
expanding website and digest. In turn,
denying The Phoenix this privilege would
wrongly halt a transition that we, like
every other newspaper in the world,
unequivocally need to make. Improving
adding multimeThe Phoenix website
dia resources and more up-to-date content, for instance
is a vital way to keep
up with a constantly evolving journalism
industry now driven by a 24-hour news
cycle.

And The Phoenix's focus on a website
is hardly a new initiative; we have been
working on it since the fall of 1995, one
year before the launch of The Daily
Gazette.
Sending out a weekly opt-out Phoenix
news digest to students would heighten
traffic on our website, a project we have
worked on tirelessly and the Student
Budget Commitee has provided money
for but many students don't even know
exists.

letter

to

We, along with the rest of the world's
newspapers, understand the importance
of having a strong website to complement

the print edition, yet it is difficult to
understand why some StuCo members do
not. If anything, the digest would allow
The Phoenix to fulfill a mission it has had
since 1881: serve the campus by dissemi-

nating quality journalism.
At their Sunday night meeting, StuCo
voted unanimously to grant The Daily
Gazette automatic access to students' emails; members voted 7-3 to not allow The
Phoenix the same privilege. [See Page 7]
StuCo Vice President Deivid Rojas 'll
stated at the meeting, "It is clearly spelled
out in the Daily Gazette mission statement that they rely on e-mail and The
Phoenix, they rely on the print version....
We spend a lot of money for The Phoenix
to get printed and if they want to have
that privilege.... I would want to see them
have less printing."
Rojas fails to recognize that, in fact,
cutting printing is a negligible way to
save money. Most of The Phoenix's printing costs are in set-up. Last year, for

instance, The Phoenix reduced its circulation by 100 copies per week at the
request of SBC out of concern for paper
usage. Yet this reduction only saved about
$lOO from a total printing cost of about
$26,000 per year. If we noticed a serious
uptake in web usage and less interest in
print, we would certainly reduce our
print run with the changing demand.
In terms of the website, The Phoenix
initially spent $750 of Phoenix money to
improve our server, but that was insufficient to have a secure and fast website.
We requested, and were granted, SBC
money to host our server off-campus,
which costs $48.95 per month, or $587.40
per year.

Student voice can influence inn project
To the Editor:
I believe that the college made the
right choice when it announced that the
college bookstore would stay collegeowned and operated under the proposed
hotel project, instead of being turned
over to Barnes & Noble.
However, I think that we need to
clear up some details relating to the history of the hotel project's bookstore
plan, which have been skewed in a
recent op-ed piece written by Vice
President of Facilities and Services Stu
Hain.
In February 2008, college administrators announced tentative plans to hand
over our beloved, homey college bookstore to Barnes & Noble, America's
largest bookstore chain. In fact, a Daily
Gazette article called "The Swarthmore
Inn Project" (2/20/2008) reported this
plan along with Hain's comment on it.
The article said that "the proposed bookstore is enormous...The developers tentatively proposed it be run by Barnes &
Noble." Hain pointed out that "Barnes &
Noble runs many college bookstores."
Many Swarthmore students and residents found these plans troubling, how-

ever, and expressed their concerns to
the borough council and college admin-

istrators.
These efforts are starting to pay off.
Last week in an op-ed published in both
the Phoenix and the Daily Gazette, Hain
assured our community that "there are
no plans, as I've heard suggested recently, to 'sell' our Bookstore to a larger
chain." His language, however, makes it
sounds like these plans were a viral
rumor instead of an actual plan the
College was contemplating merely two
and half years ago.
We need to set therecord straight: the
college was, until relatively recently,
considering turning over our bookstore
to a huge chain. Even though it has now
(thankfully!) decided against these
plans, we students need to be aware of
the near realities of this hotel project.
This laudable decision to keep our
bookstore college-owned and operated
shows that students have real power
when we speak up and work together. As
this project progresses, we will need to
strengthen our efforts in order to make
it a positive change for our community.

list would, indeed, save money: In bringing more people to the website, the electronic digest would make SBC's investment in the website a more worthwhile
one.
Had StuCo legitimately attempted to
hear The Phoenix's position, we could
have laid out these essential facts.
The Phoenix is also constantly investing time into the site. We have web developers upgrading our services. We have
editors uploading stories and photos
every week. We even have new web staff
positions in an effort to update the site
more frequently.
But with StuCo's latest decision, it
feels as if its members are telling us we
are wasting our time.
StuCo purportedly based its recommendation on theresults of a student survey. A very decisive plurality of respondents
4L3 percent
voted that The
Phoenix and The Daily Gazette should be
allowed to automatically subscribe students to their mailing list. Only 22.8 percent of respondents said The Daily
Gazette alone should have this privelege.
StuCo cited the fact that 48.7 percent of
polled students said they receive "just the
right amount of unsolicited e-mails a day"
and 43.2 percent said they receive "too
many" when they made their decision.
But this is likely indicative of issues
unrelated to The Phoenix digest. Every
week the student body receives a slew of
unsoliticted e-mails.
This week there were two RSDs and
one Daily Gazette every day, a China
Education Initiative Session, a Study
Abroad Info Session, a Pub Nite advertisement, info about Study Abroad in
Cape Town, a request for a flute and an
Olde Club advertisement. Aside from the
RSD and the Daily Gazette e-mails, these
all come from mailing lists that students
cannot unsubscribe from.

Importantly, students could unsubscribe from The Phoenix digest.
A full 58.3 percent of polled students
thought that RSD should be once-a-day,
which if implemented would cut seven emails a week. Adding one e-mail from The
Phoenix per week then would still mean a
reduction of six e-mails a week.
The crux of this issue, in fact, was epitomized by an e-mail yesterday from Rojas
to the student body entitled "Efforts for
Pakistan Floor [sic] Relief." If StuCo
members want to use the argument that
students get too many unsolicited emails
a week, they should reprimand their own
vice president for using the mailing list to
support a cause. However good the cause
may be, there are countless other student
groups doing similarly other positive
campaigns that do not have the privilege
to send out to the student body.
The Phoenix aggregates and, to the
best of our abilities, fairly reports the
important news and initiatives around
campus as a service to the community.
We do not single out a campaign because
we support it or attempt to influence students to join it. StuCo should be facilitating open information through e-mails
instead of allowing one of its members to
advertise and support a singular campaign or effort.
Student Council President Simon Zhu
'll indicated at Sunday's meeting that he
understands The Phoenix's reasons for
wanting an e-mail digest. "In a world
where journalism is more and more not
print-based, I think we'd be doing a huge
disservice to The Phoenix to say, 'You
can't do it as well,'" he said.
We commend Zhu's words. And as we
await Braun's decision, we hope she sees
that our rationale is well-grounded and
understands that it is more important
than ever to stay in tune with rapid
changes in the dissemination of news.

Women tie twice prior to key Centennial contest

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY AND LAYLA HELWA
vbradyX lhelwal@swarthmore.edu

Twelve days ago, the Swarthmore
women's soccer team won a critical match
at Dickinson 2-L The victory evened the
Garnet's record at 2-2, stopped a two-game
skid, and set the tone for Centennial
Conference play.
But even behind quality play, the team
has struggled for results since, falling 2-0 on
the road at second-ranked TCNJ and settling for a tie Sunday at home against NYU.
Both teams struggled to create rhythm

and gain momentum in the first-half of play
on Sunday, and the first 45 minutes ended
without a goal.
Swarthmore opened the scoring on
Sunday with a goal from Megan Colombo
'll, off an assist from Alexa Ross 'l3,'the
first assist in her collegiate career. Kirsten
Peterson 'll scored her team-leading second
goal of the year minutes later.
Colombo's goal was her first of the season and the 23rd of her collegiate career,
placing her just three goals behind the
Swarthmore women's soccer all-time goalscoring record.
But the Garnet could not hold onto the
lead as the Bobcats rallied to draw even at
2-2. The teams played through two overtime
sessions as both squads, despite scoring
opportunities, failed to find the back of the
net. NYU dominated the first overtime period, nearly claiming victory with a long
drive that goaltender Marie Mutryn 'l2
tipped off her crossbar.
In the second overtime, Garnet firstyears Amber Famiglietti
and Aly
Passanante led the Garnet attack, but
NYU's senior keeper, Alex Walters, was up
to the challenge. She finished the game
with six saves.
The games against TCNJ and NYU were
the first two in a stretch of three brutal nonconference games. Swarthmore concluded
that stretch with a 1-1 tie against Eastern,
ranked No. 23 by the National Soccer
Coaches Association of America (NSCAA),

in a game called in the first overtime
because of lightning.
Aly Passanante 'l4 tied the game late in
the second halffor the Garnet with her first
collegiate goal.

"One of the reasons we put together the
grueling schedule that we have is so we are
prepared to compete at the highest level
possible in conference. By the time this
weekend is over, we'll have faced off
against four of the top 25 teams in the country: No. 10 Rowan, No. 2 TCNJ, No. 23
Eastern and No. 7 Hopkins," said Anckaitis.
(The Garnet defeated Rowan 2-0 in a preseason scrimmage).
Swarthmore returns to action on
Saturday against another NSCAA-ranked
team, Johns Hopkins, which was ranked
No. 7 in the latest poll. Hopkins opened
Centennial Conference play with a 7-0 victory over Washington, and the Blue Jays'
lone loss came to the top-ranked Messiah.
"Dickinson is one of [the] top teams in
our conference that we prepared for, and
we've passed that test. They were picked
by the coaches to finish second in the conference. Hopkins is another, picked to finish first, and we're pushing ourselves to be
ready for that one too," added Anckaitis.
Anckaitis knows that the team is capable of competing with the top teams in the
country, and says the match with TCNJ

confirmed that knowledge.
"The TCNJ game confirmed what we
already knew
that we can compete
against the best teams in the country. We
didn't have the speed or quickness of the
Lions, but we knew that going in, and we
played a smart game, neutralizing those
strengths," said Anckaitis.
"We need to be more hungry in the final
third because we had several opportunities
there that we didn't take advantage of.
We're really hesitant sometimes and with a
team that has their quickness, you're going

to get shots blocked if you're not shooting
the first time. Other than a seven/eight
minute span in the first half, it was a pretty

back-and-forth game," Anckaitis added.

Men's tennis opens season at Swat Invitational

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's tennis team opened the
2010 fall season this weekend, facing off against
defending Centennial Conference Champions Johns
Hopkins and Division I University of Delaware on
Saturday and Sunday.
The Swarthmore Invitational is the first tournament of the fall season for the men's tennis team, the
first chance to face competition in preparation for the
spring season.
In their first collegiate action, the first-year players fought hard this weekend, with MaximillianKaye
'l4 posting a 6-3, 6-3 win over University of Delaware
senior Chris Hincker. Preston Poon 'l4 fell just short
in a three set loss, 3-6, 6-1, 7-10.
Poon and Kaye were also the only Swarthmore
competitors in the tournament finals on Sunday.
They fell to the University of Delaware in a doubles
match.
The first-years showed they can play well against
some of the toughest competition that the team will
face all year.
"The [first-year players] fought pretty hard; they
kept their calm
better than I did [in my first college game]," said James Wieler 'l3.
This year, the team has a balance of youth and
experience which could prove a major asset for
spring play.

Senior Mark Wee won 6-3, 6-1 against University of
Delaware's Nick Piacente in a Flight C match. "[The
upperclassmen] will be more ready to step up when
the times come because we're smarter and better
than last year," said Malik Mubeen 'l3.
Against their Division I opponents, the Garnet
remained competitive in doubles too. Wieler and
Mubeen fell in a close 8-5 match to University of
Delaware's Jason Derene and Timothy Lozinak.
Wieler thinks that the Swarthmore Invitational is
a good preparatory step for the team. "It's good to see
we get a better feeling
the college game in the fall
of what to expect [in spring play]."
The stiff competition this weekend is just a taste of
what the Garnet men's tennis has to face in the
spring season. "It exposed our weaknesses in a high
level of competition," added Mubeen.
Last year, the Garnet men fell to Johns Hopkins
University in the Centennial Conference Tournament
finals by a score of 6-0. The Blue Jays handed
Swarthmore its only regular-season conference loss
as well, 8-1, as Swarthmore finished 8-1 in Centennial
play. The team's goal this year is to beat Johns
Hopkins in Centennial Tournament play.
"Skill-wise, we're every bit as good as Hopkins. We
just need to keep doing what we're doing," said
Mubeen.
"I think we showed Hopkins that not only are we
improved over last year, but that they should be worried about us when the spring comes around," said

junior Max Bressman in an e-mail.

The results from this past weekend show that
Swarthmore men's tennis may be prepared to take
the step to the next level of play in the spring. "We're
going to push Hopkins this year," said Wieler.
The returning players from the 2010 season have
one more year of experience under their belts.
Mubeen and Wieler agree that the experience from
last year will translate to the 2010-11 season. "I expect
us to get better and better," said Wieler.
The team is confident in its growth from last season, though the players recognize that their competitors also have another year of preparation as well.
The year looks to be shaping up to a match of wills.
Equally matched with Hopkins, it comes down to
which team puts its best foot forward in spring play
and the Centennial Conference tournament.
"Historically, the Swat Invitational has been a
tournament that we have struggled with," said
Bressman. Now that the initial tournament is over,
the team can see what needs to be improved. The
Garnet is looking forward to returning to the courts
in the ITA Regionals in just a couple weeks.
The overall attitude of the team is positive. "The
sky's the limit for us," said Wieler. With minds pointed in that direction, the team is ready to really get the
season started.
The Swarthmore men's tennis team wraps up the
fall season October 2 at Mary Washington in the ITA
Regionals.

agency following its merger with a
British firm. Ultimately, Draper is
deemed too valuable to release, but the
decision isn't unanimous. "Let him go,"
fumes one of the executives. "It'll take a
second to find some kid who can write a
prose poem to a potato chip."
For reasons that still aren't clear to
me, I kept coming back to that scene, and
to Draper himself, when I heard the
news that the Torre narrative might be
coming to an end when he steps down as
Dodgers manager at the end of this year.
I was reminded of that scene when I reread the episode in Torre's book, The
Yankee Years, where Torre snaps at

Yankees' president, to "shut the f— up"

on."

Mad Men is, of course, far from over,
and the eventual fate of Don Draper as he
hurtles (or, considering the opening
credits/plummets) toward the end of the
Sixties is still very much up in the air.
But if the emergence of cracks in Torre's
relationship with the Yankees can serve
as a parallel to an executive not so willing to embrace Draper's genius, just how
deep does the analogy run?
Let's start not at the beginning but at
the rebirth. Torre was able to shed the

THE PHOENIX

skin from a career managing mediocre
National League clubs when the Yankees
hired him before the 1996 season. The
move, you may remember, paid immediate dividends for everybody, setting off a
six-year run from '96 to 2001 in which the
Yankees won four championships and
failed to reach the World Series only
once. Having returned from Korea with
a literally new identity, Don Draper was
chosen from the obscurity and cheap
suits of salesmanship—first used car,
then fur coat—by Roger Sterling so that
he could take his talents to Sterling's
burgeoning ad agency. That move also
worked out pretty well for everyone
involved; Don was able to upgrade the
quality of his excessive drinking and
adultery, and Sterling Cooper had its
secret weapon to land clients, like Kodak
and American Tobacco.
The relationship between Sterling
and Draper isn't too different from the
one Torre allegedly experienced with
George Steinbrenner. There was the
barely latent resentment on the part of
the boss for the credit and fame his
employee

enjoyed—watch

Sterling's

reaction in the "Waldorf Stories" episode
when Don is the firm's sole recipient of a
prestigious advertising award. Both
Torre and Draper recognized the fragile
egos of their superiors and used that
leverage to get what they wanted, as
when Torre would get the owner to back
off a contentious decision by threatening
to reveal to the press that it had, in fact,
been Steinbrenner's call.
Ironically, the dissolution of the reallife partnership may provide an inadvertent blueprint for how the fictional one
will play itself out; Torre and
Steinbrenner parted ways after too many
years without a championship had weakened the manager's once-bulletproofreputation in New York. The current run of
Mad Men finds Don in personal and professional freefall; for the first time ever,
he's a liability to his employer instead of
his biggest asset. His gifts haven't deserted him yet, but the cracks are beginning
to appear, just as they seemed to each

time Torre's Yankees went home emptyhanded.
Both men elevated themselves above
the organization that put them on the
map. Don Draper achieved this with just
about everything he did, from berating
unimpressed clients to missing meetings
to sleep with married women to jetting
off to Los Angeles to find mental clarity*
at a moment's notice. Torre put on the
face of a loyal soldier until the end and
never forgot to give Steinbrenner his
due, but privately expressed the belief
that Steinbrenner's success was more
due to his efforts than the other way
around. Bill Madden, in his recent biography on the owner, recounts the final
meeting between the manager and the
Yankees executives in which Torre
absurdly cited advertising and marketing revenue from the Yankees' regional
TV network as evidence of his value to
the team. The Yankees, as it turned out,
were unwilling to credit a manager with
the success of their billion-dollar empire,
especially one who had made his pedigree on the team they owned. "My dad
was crucified for hiring [Torre]," said
Steinbrenner's son, Hank, after the meeting. "Where was his career before my
dad hired him?"
*You could make the case, ifyou wanted to take it that far, that Torre did this as
well.
Whether Torre actually got 'fired'
from the Yankees is more a matter of
semantics than anything else. Perhaps,
like Draper, he saw the writing on the
wall before the die was cast and resolved
to cut his losses. Or maybe the Yankees
simply felt that, with a $2OO million payroll at his disposal, there would be more
than one manager who could write a
prose poem to a potato chip. Either way,
he was gone after the 2007 season, severing one of the great partnerships in baseball history. Realizing that Sterling
Cooper's second merger in a year would
render him a victim of housecleaning,
Don defected to set up his own shop and
took many of his soldiers with him.
When Torre left for Los Angeles, he

September 23, 2010

brought along Don Mattingly and Larry
Bowa from the Yankees to coach for him.
The journeys certainly share similarities, but to me, the comparison goes
even beyond common occurrences.
Maybe it's the nature of the two jobs,
both founded on intangible, hard-todefine talents where it sometimes seems
as if the most important aspect is convincing other people that everything will
work out just fine. It's a credit to Torre's
leadership that the majority of the
drama and turmoil from his tenure with
the Yankees was kept under wraps
enough so that it could even be considered a revelation when detailed in his
book. Likewise, it's a credit to Draper
that, as much of a mess as he has
become, the expectations of the clients
continue to be regularly surpassed. Even
the pervasive air of duplicity that surrounds Draper's every action is a natural fit for a man running the most popular sports franchise in America. Torre
never quite put the distance between
himself and others the way Draper has,
but the charge that self-interest governs
his every action has been levied against
him enough that it can no longer be dismissed as the slander of envious employees.
There is, of course, no guarantee that
Torre is finished managing baseball.
Should the Mets come crawling during
the winter, who's to say he isn't in
Flushing next season? If he is done, his
legacy is set as one- of the greatest managers ever, but the end of his career has
not seen a return to his earlier glory. The
last years of the Torre Era in baseball
have seen him exiled from the town
where he made his name, only to wash
up on the shores of California and
almost, but not quite, take another team
to the heights he reached in New York.
It's always dangerous looking too deep
for subtext where there is none, but if art
really does imitate life, then Don Draper
might not be thrilled at the way Joe
Torre has left the game of baseball.

Field hockey suffers two close defeats at home

BY DANIEL DUNCAN

The Garnet field hockey

team faced stiff competition

this past weekend at home
against Drew and nationally
ranked Eastern University,
showing good progress but ultimately falling just short in both
contests. The Garnet lost 2-0 to
No. 14 Eastern and 1-0 to Drew,
bringing their record to 2-4 on
the season.
The Eastern Eagles shut out
the Garnet offense on Saturday.

Despite successfully holding
possession for long stretches,
the Garnet managed just four
shots, three on goal. The
Eagles' Laura Ressler came up
with three saves to deny the
team.
The defense held together
well throughout the game, preventing opportunities to score
and slowing down its opponent,
a team which handed No. 1

year. Katie Ashmore

'll was

superb in goal, making eight
saves to almost single-handedly
keep the Garnet in the game.
The Eagles scored quickly to
begin each half. They scored in

the sixth minute of the first
with a well-timed cross from
Brittany Moyer to a waiting
Lisa Gocht. In the ninth minute
of the second, they struck
again, with Abby Wagner winning a one-on-one confrontation
with Ashmore.
After the second Eastern
goal, Ashmore grew more
aggressive in goal, coming off
her line to squash scoring
opportunities. She made several sprawling saves, including
one dive across an open net
from out of position.
The 2-0 Eastern victory
moved the now ninth-ranked
Eagles to 5-1 on the season.

Coach Lauren Fuchs said
that the entire team played well
against Eastern, but failed to
score on the chances it had. She
added, "When you're playing a
nationally ranked opponent
like that, when you have opportunities, you need to convert."
Fuchs said that a goal for the
next game was to have a better
organized defense and offense.
Specifically, the offense needed
to work more to the strong
right side and be more balanced
in the offensive circle.
On Sunday, the Garnet came
out swinging against the Drew
Rangers, only to fall short
again. The offense was more
productive, taking 13 shots, 10
on goal, including four from
Sophia Agathis 'l3 and three
from Katie Teleky 'l3. However,
an exceptional ten-save performance by Drew goalie
Christiana Carlini would leave
the Garnet goalless.
The defense was solid again,
led by five saves from Ashmore
and a defensive save from Catie
Meador 'l3. Just one goal
slipped through, but that
proved to be the difference.
After Meador's save, the ball
ended up in front of Drew's
Mary Esposito, who passed to
Jessica Johnson to create the
goal.

Drew's 1-0 victory moved the
Rangers to 5-1 on the season.

The second loss of the weekend
dropped the Garnet to 2-4.
Despite the consecutive losses, the Garnet found satisfaction in the quality of its play. "I
think we really stepped up to
the level of our competition
and, even though we lost,
played very well," Teleky said.
Ashmore added that the play
on Sunday was a good sign. "We

Garnet men win battle in Baltimore, No. 1 in region

Fabian Castro, 17, heads a ball in the Johns Hopkins box. Micah Rose, 14, and Henry Ainley scored for the Garnet to secure a victory over the Blue Jays 2-1 on Saturday.
BY SAM LACY
slacyl@swarthmore.edu
In 1993, Clothier Field was a grass field
and had football goalposts on either end.
That year, Swarthmore beat the Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays 3-1 in the first ever
Centennial Conference matchup between
the two schools.
Since then, the Blue Jays have controlled
the series with a record of 16-3-1 and have
outscored the Garnet 56-5, not once allowing
more than one goal in a match.
On Saturday, Swarthmore bucked all of
these trends, winning 2-1 at Homewood
Field in Baltimore, where Hopkins has been
especially dominant. Saturday's loss was
just the sixth at home in the history of
Centennial Conference play for the Blue
Jays.
"Great teams play extremely

well at
home. In soccer, homefield advantage is
enormous," said head coach Eric Wagner.
"[The win] answered one of my biggest questions about this team: 'How will we do on the

road?'"
And what a convincing answer it was.
Brilliant first half goals by Micah Rose 'l2
and Henry Ainley 'l2 put the Garnet up 2-0
at the half. A smothering defensive effort in
the second half conceded a lone goal on a

controversial penalty, protecting the lead for
a 2-1 victory. With the win, Swarthmore
jumped from No. 13 to No. 5 in the National
Soccer Coaches Association of America

(NSCAA) national rankings and dropped
Hopkins from No. 4 for No. 17.

Swarthmore is now ranked as the top

team in the Mid-Atlantic regional rankings
for the first time in program history.
The rowdy Hopkins crowd was particularly critical of Garnet hairstyles on
Saturday, but it was Swarthmore's Rose and
his blond ponytail who struck first in the
26th minute for the all-important early lead.

the Blue Jay faithful. No player touched the
ball more than twice in the scoring
sequence, showcasing the quick pinpoint

After the first goal, "we could feel the tide
turn and rode the wave of silencing the
crowd," Rose said. The Garnet dominated
possession and controlled the pace for the
rest of the half. For the half, the Garnet had
14 shots while limiting Hopkins to five.
Henry Ainley 'l2 entered the game late in
the half to spell Castro and quickly made the
most of his opportunity. In the 39th minute,
Pierre Dyer 'l2 played a long ball to Langley
up the left side of the field. After beating two

"If we are allowing [the opposition] to

nerves out of the way, I realized its still a

As Hopkins put the pressure on late in

player in the last 15 minutes," Wagner said.
If all else fails on defense, the Garnet-still

D'Annunzio's four saves on Saturday was
actually a season high. Although the Garnet
keeper is rarely tested because of the
strength of the defense, he is ever present as
a communicator and defensive orchestrator.

Swarthmore returned to action on
Tuesday, picking up a victory in a tightly

contested non-conference match with the
Arcadia Knights 3-1 at Clothier Field. The
Knights' Jeff McDonald scored off a Nick
Morris corner in the 12th minute as the
Garnet went behind for the first time all
year.
But Swarthmore would answer with
three second-half goals from Langley 57',
Rose 62' and Castro 84' to improve to 7-0-0 on
the year. Langley had his eighth assist of the
year on Rose's goal, already tying him with
Doug Gramiak for the most assists for the
Garnet in a season.
The win was the 100th of Wagner's
Swarthmore career.

But despite the significance of the
