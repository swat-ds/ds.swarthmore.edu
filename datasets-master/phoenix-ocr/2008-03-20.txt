SBC's funds run low with new groups; not a 'crisis'
BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu
The past few years have been witness to an increasing
number of chartered student groups on campus.
Especially as the Charter Committee prepares to make a

decision on the chartering of Punc/tum!!!, a proposed student-run visual arts magazine that will, according to
Student Council Student Groups Advisor Paul Apollo 'O9,
cost approximately $14,000 to publish two times per year,
calculated efforts will be made on the part of the Student
Budget Committee to accommodate any additional student group budget proposals while ensuring that large
end-of-the-year events, like Worthstock, are still adequately funded and do not cause major setbacks in the

year's remaining budget.
Essentially a subcommittee of Student Council, SBC's
purpose is to fund chartered student groups and to oversee the student budget, which is comprised of the student
activity fees students pay each year. This year alone the
Charter Committee has granted charters to 13 new
groups, including the Swarthmore Ping Pong Club,
Swarthmore Organization for Israel and the Russian
Club, requiring SBC to fund more than 100 groups within
their limited budget.
This has been part of a recent trend of an increasing
number of groups forming and expanding on campus.
"Our primary priority is to ensure that these funds are
dispersed to as many groups as possible for the remainder of the year," SBC Manager Giannina Esquivel 'OB

said. "I think [the increasing number of student groups]
has been a huge impact on our budget because we weren't
anticipating such a large number of groups."
While Esquivel said that SBC was glad to provide
funding that would benefit both expanding and new student groups, she said it was not possible to anticipate the
large number of new student groups that formed this
year, and the subsequently large amount of funding that
was required.
Currently, $20,000 remains in SBC's budget for the
remainder of the academic year with which they are

responsible for funding budget proposals and supplementary requests, according to Esquivel.
In addition to funding student groups, another strain on
SBC's remaining funds is Worthstock, a large-scale, end-ofthe-year music event held at the college, which will require
a large chunk of the remaining budget. "I don't think what
we're facing is a crisis," Esquivel said. "It's just a budget
crunch that we need to work with right now."

All About (SBC) Accounts
SBC holds four large accounts through which they
can access and deposit funds including the student activities account, the Contingency fund, the Capital
Replacement Fund and the FUNFund.
According to Esquivel the Contingency Fund, which
currently holds $23,000, acts as a reserve of funds in the
case of a budgetary emergency in which the student
activities account were to deplete, whereas the Capital
Replacement Fund is used to fund a replacement schedule for equipment held by student groups on campus
whose value may depreciate over time. This includes student vans, SCCS equipment, WSRN studio equipment
and other expensive, hard-to-replace items.
Unlike the Contingency Fund, the Capital
Replacement Fund is not tapped into for any purpose
other than the capital replacement objective, according
to Esquivel. It is a separate fund to ensure that financial
burden of capital replacement does not threaten the
budgets of student groups, as well as to ensure that there
are sufficient funds to replace important equipment over
time.
The FUNFund is different than the Contingency Fund
and the Capital Replacement Fund in that it provides
funding to unchartered student groups. Established two
years ago, FUNFund funding has been used for purposes
as diverse as the financing of a photo exhibit to the purchase of a ping-pong table for Willets.
According to Apollo, who is chair of the Charter
Committee and Student Council's Representative on
SBC, unspent student group funds have historically gone
from the student activities account into the FUNFund,

Photocopying: $3,827.90
Group Supplies: $28,08159
Individual Supplies: $2,300.00
Registration Fees: $28,399.00
Services: $11X006.47
Student Labor: $56,849.80
Transportation: $20,499.75
All-Campus Events: $10,62156
Group Events: $1040.00
Closed Events: $450.00
GENERAL SUBCODE TOTAL: $263,073.07
Budget figures were provided by SBC Manager
Giannina Esquivei 'OB. Note that these general
categories do not include group-specific subcodes
(such as "Performances" for Drama Board) or
budgetary requests that were made and approved
to SBC during the academic year. The total money
allocated during the budgeting process for groupspecific subcodes and special projects was
$156,980.

though that remaining money now automatically goes
towards the Capital Replacement Fund.
"Historically, [this amount of money] has been pretty
high," Apollo said. "I certainly would like to see money
in the FUNFund. I would like to see as much of that
to ensure that we can
money in the hands of groups
give out as much money as possible."
...

This "rollover" money can also be used towards

replacing the Contingency Fund when necessary. In the

case of Punc/tum!!! magazine, if chartered, SBC would
dedicate $lO,OOO of the rollover funds towards funding
their budget proposal, according to Apollo. This would
aid in offsetting the high cost, which would otherwise
take a large toll on the regular student activities account.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Without warning, Da Vinci's cafe in the Viile closes permanently; new restaurant to potentially take the space

Hena Choi Phoenix Staff

Da Vinci's Cafe, located at 1 Park
Avenue in the Ville, has closed as of
March \ according to Chris Bruno, the
cafe's owner. In an e-mail message sent to
The Phoenix, Bruno confirmed the closing of his store, but declined to comment
further at this time. Over the last few
weeks, the status of Da Vinci's had been
questioned by observers who noticed that
the store had been closed for an extended
period of time and that many pieces of

THE PHOENIX

decoration and furniture were visibly
missing.
In early February, Bruno bad told The

Phoenix that he had no intention of selling the store, and that an anonymous
"for-sale" advertisement of the cafe,
which had appeared on the online classifieds site Craigslist, had not been posted
by him. The identity of the individual
who posted that advertisement is still
unknown.

According to former employee Sasha
Grenier 'OB, who worked at Da Vinci's up
to the closing, Bruno had told his employees that the-store's lease ran out and that
"some other people were going to take
over" in June. Grenier said that Bruno
had told her of this a few weeks after the
anonymous ad was placed on Craigslist.
Though Grenier said that Bruno had
informed one employee the night before
Da Vinci's closing, she said that Bruno
had not told anyone else that the store
would be closing earlier than June.
Grenier had been under the impression
that "[Bruno] was surviving" and that the
restaurant would continue running the
way it was until June. "It's really disappointing, considering that I became
unemployed from one day to the next
without warning," Grenier said.
Bruno did not reply by press time to
further requests for comment on Grenier's
remarks or for further context as to the
restaurant's closing.
The closing of Da Vinci's was further
confirmed by Carol Savefy, administrative assistant at the Swarthmore Borough
Administrative Office, and by Marty
Spiegel, the Town Center Coordinator for
the borough.
According to Spiegel, plans are underway for another business to fill the space
vacated by Da Vinci's. "There's nothing
definite in terms of timeframe or anything

March 20, 2008

else that I think would be appropriate to
discuss at this point, but as those plans
unfold, I'm sure that much more will
become available for publication," Spiegel
said.
Aside from ensuring that the next business occupying the space is compliant
with all necessary ordinances and regulations, Spiegel said, "the borough doesn't
have any more role [in this case] thanthey
would for any other specific business."
While the future of the vacant space at
is not yet certain, Spiegel said that it is the
hope of the borough that the space will be
used for a new restaurant.
According to Grenier, Bruno had told
his employees that come June the space
would host a "fancy" restaurant with
Mediterranean cuisine, and that the new
tenants were planning on renovating Da
Vinci's kitchen.
However, William J. Pastuszek Real
Estate, the agency that owns the property
at 1 Park Avenue, would not confirm any
information about who will be leasing the
property next. A representative of the
agency who declined to be identified said
that the "details are in the works" regarding the future of the property. The individual declined to confirm whetherthe property was undergoirig a change in ownership, but said that more information may
be forthcoming.

SBC, Student Council set to increase SAC oversight
BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

The Student Budget Committee has recently expressed
an interest in assuming responsibility for the hiring of the
Student Activities Committee's co-directors, rather than
allow the Student Activities Office to acquire new members
through an internal process. A structural change of this
nature would shift the accountability of SAC to students in
SBC/Student Council as opposed to the Student Activites
Office.
The funds that SAC eventually allocates for parties, study
breaks and other social activities originate within the SBC's
annual spring budgeting process, which determines the
amount of money that SAC can disburse at its discretion.
This procedure mirrors that of the other sub-committees
such as the Forum for Free Speech and the Movie
Committee, with one notable exception: while the vast
majority of student committee directors are hired by
Student Council, the co-directors of SAC are hired by the
Student Activities Office. Because the salaries of SAC codirectors are financed by the Student Activities Office, these
co-directors are not accountable to SBC or Student Council.
"This has been in the works for years but there have been
different mitigating circumstances for why it's never been
able to come up before," SBC member and Student Council
student groups advisor Paul Apollo 'O9 said.
"There has been a lot of animosity between SBC and
SAC," Apollo said. "This year relations were cordial enough
that SBC came to Student Council with the idea that since all
the SAC money is student allocated, the SAC co-directors
should be answerable to the student body rather than to the
administration."

This change would include paying for the salaries of the
co-directors. According to Apollo, SBC's desire to change the
process was not sparked by any problems with the current
co-directors.
"We just felt that philosophically it was a step that needed to be taken," Apollo said. "It was initially misconstrued
on the Activities Office's side and initially [Administrative
Coordinator for Student Activities Paury Flowers] and the
co-directors were pretty against the idea."
-Flowers said that much of what SAC does requires
administrative support. Tasks she identified as requiring
such support included communication with vendors, contracts and working with various departments on campus.
"Given that set of responsibilities, the [Student Activities
Office] are the professional staff members most inclined to
manage and support the co-directors and we see it as a great
way to forge a long-term relationship with SBC and Student
Council," she said.
According to Flowers, there had been a miscommunication with SBC, as in the past SBC leaders have sat on the
committee for hiring SAC co-directors.
"What I do think is that this issue highlights the need for
more communication between SAO and SBC," Flowers said.
"Our various responsibilities just don't give us the opportunity to do that as frequently as we should. My hope is that
we can come together to change that."
Student council president Peter Gardner 'OB indicated
that Student Council recognizes the Student Activities
Office's opposition.
"SAC is different than the other focus funding groups in
that the school has a perhaps more vested interest in the
allocation of that money for student activities on campus,"
Gardner said. "Therefore, entirely understandably, the

Dean's Office should have a large part to play in the function
of SAC," he said.
Student Council wanted to clarify their objective to the
Activities Office so the two could reach an agreement.
"I think what is important to distinguish, where some
confusion came from, was that we don't want to change the
relationship between SAC and the Activities Office,"
Gardner said. "All we are trying to do is increase the
involvement of the student body in the goings on ofthat committee," Gardner said.
The groups have come to an agreement that all of the
involved parties (SAC, SBC, Student Council and SAO), will
come together and write an official agreement that the SAC
co-directors will sign that stipulates exactly what their
duties and responsibilities were and how their committee
will interact with SBC and the Student Activities Office.
Gardner explained that this way, the involvement of the
various committees will be formally established, and Apollo
agrees that producing a written agreement is the best way to
solve the problem.
"The way we went about it is, just because everyone who
is in the game now has an understanding of what is supposed to happen, there is no guarantee of continuity because
there is no contract. Maybe when the next director takes
over the Activities Office, they won't know how to handle

things as well as Paury does or when the next co-directors
come they might know exactly what to do," Apollo said.
The groups have recently met to discuss plans for better
communication in the future.
"I am very satisfied to have had the opportunity to sit
down with Student Council, SAC and SBC since we are all
here in one capacity or another to ensure that the wider student body has fun," Flowers said.

McCabe library.

The thefts range from a computer monitor, property of the college
to a student's backpack, full of textbooks and notes. While the increasing number of thefts surprised
many students, Redgrave said the
thefts were "not out of character for
a library setting open to the public."
In recent months, crime in
other places around campus has
been starting to attract more
attention. While McCabe still
leads in number of crimes, with 8
out of the 28 reported thefts
between Sept. L 2007 and March 17,
2008, Tarble is close behind with
five, and Parrish has had four. The
other crimes have been in various
locations around campus, including several dorms.

According to Redgrave, "Most,
if not all, of the thefts were valu-

ables that were unsecured and
unattended."
Redgrave cites several locations around campus where students can secure their valuables
in lockers,
including Lang
Concert Hall, LPAC and a new set
of lockers in Parrish. Both Seiden
and Redgrave brought up the
addition of lockers in McCabe,
which will take place this summer. Redgrave also mentioned the
possibility of installing additional
lockers in Tarble, a proposal that

is still under review.
Since the first string of crimes
this year, the library staff has
taken several preventative measures against what College
Librarian Peggy Seiden calls
"opportunistic property thefts."
Measures include posting signs
warning about the recent thefts

March 20, 2008

and additional laptop locks, which
can be used on both library-owned
laptops and on personal laptops.
Seiden hopes to "raise student
awareness about possible thefts and
their own personal responsibility to
help deter thefts."
In this spirit, the library staff
has begun the "toilet papers" and
the "if I were a thief campaigns. In
the latter campaign, staff put notes
on desks where people had left valuable items like cell phones, laptops
and purses unattended.
While the incidence of crime this

year is statistically comparable to
rates reported in previous years,
Redgrave is still worried about the
likelihood of future thefts by repeat

offenders.
"Crime begets additional crime
a criminal who has been successful may return numerous times to
the same location," Redgrave said.
He also worries about the violent
escalation of property thefts, specifically when an individual is "caught
in the act."
In addition to crimes in public
...

spaces, students have reported acts
of larceny occurring in residence
halls. While many thefts involve
bathroom products like toothpaste,
soap and shampoo, other, more serious crimes, including the theft of a
laptop from Mertz, have also been

reported.
Mertz RA Nicole Nfonoyim 'OB
expressed concern and tried to com-

bat the

increasing crimes with

signs, e-mail and a hall meeting.

She

and her hallmates were
"shocked at how quickly and mysteriously such a valuable object was
stolen out of a person's room."
Mertz has several issues with
security including a perpetually
propped lounge door, close proximity to Chester Road and a tradition of

entering

the dorm through win-

dows.
"It's not until you go to another
larger college or university that you

just
exposed
realize
how
Swarthmore is with its multiple
open points of-entry, lack of gates
and other systems to regulate who
is on the campus at any given time,"
Nfonoyim said.
said
that
Nfonoyim
also
increased security may be beneficial for preserving a "sense of privacy and safety."

"Crime begets
additional crime... a
criminal who has been
successful may return
to the same location."
Owen Redgrave
Director of Public
Safety
The necessary measures to carry
out this increase in security, which
possibly
would
include
an
increased presence of public safety

around campus, may be disconcerting to many students.
Redgrave said that the number
of thefts has not risen enough in
recent years to warrant additional
safety measures.
He stressed personal responsibility and the importance of securing
valuables.
However, these measures may
prove

unpopular.

"Culturally,

Swatties are accustomed to leaving
doors open and belongings unattended," Nfonoyim said.

MULTi week questions constructs of ethnicity, race
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

Designed to increase campus awareness of the student group and the issues it
represents, MULTi week (hosted by
to bring multicultural
issues into the greater campus consciousness. The weeklong schedule of activities
includes a gallery opening in Shane
iMULTi) plans

a ring discussion and a lecture.
MULTi Week began
with the
MULTiFACEted Gallery Opening, which
occurred on Monday, March 17 in the
Shane Lounge. Given the tagline "Find
pictures of yourself or your friends and
how they approached the question 'what
are you?"', the event unveiled photos of
Swarthmore students accompanied by
words or phrases that they felt described
themselves.
Yesterday the week continued with a
ring discussion entitled "Trapped in a
Box" during which students debated their
ethnic and cultural origins.
Thursday
features
the lecture
"America Beyond Black and White" by Dr.
Ronald Fernandez, a Professor of
Sociology at Central Connecticut State
University. "Not Just Fetishes and Race

led by Carmen Van Kerckhove of New

is co-sponsored by SAO. Friday also
wraps up with a party held in the WRC
later that evening.

"I'd like people to start

The entire week then concludes with
the opening of the McCabe exhibit,
"MULTea."
MULTi Co-President Robert Manduca
10 cites the lecture as the event he anticipates the most. "Dr. Ronald Fernandez
will be talking about the way race is
viewed in the United States. Right now,
here is a dichotomy between white and
ion-white He will also talk about why
he feels the recent wave of immigration
and the rise of [multicultural] people is
going to be helpful," Manduca said.
MULTi member Joslyn Young 'lO also
showed enthusiasm for the lecture. "I'm

because it speaks to multi issues and
because of the black-white dichotomy and

because

there are so many other races

said.

For both Manduca and Young, this

fear is the first time they've participated

They pinpoint their desires to raise

thought that people didn't really know
what MULTi is or what we're about,
and we wanted to tell them this is who
we are, this is what we're doing, this is
why we're cool and this is why you

should be interested in this stuff,"
Manduca said.
"I feel that every group that has a
week or a month or whatever is trying
to spread awareness or understanding
of that culture or group or whatever
they're doing. I think with [multicultural] people and issues becoming more
prevalent in the present, it's important
to bring the issues to campus and say to
the campus that it's something you
should and will think about in the
future," Young said.
Similarly, MULTi public relations

week's events will be a catalyst for

thought.

Some students began meeting in a

more informal manner to discuss and
supplement their class work, and decided
others would benefit from similar meetings.

appeal to anyone who has any interest in

and large-scale events. Smaller events
will include general meetings, which

focus on talking to members of the club
for input on activities, and study sessions
to help students who are currently in
Japanese classes. "At the study sessions,
we will have all of the electronic and
print resources of the members of the
club," Matthews said. "It's an opportunity for us to pool our resources and help
each other."
Several students in Japanese language
courses said they would be glad to have
the opportunity to review material covered in class and further their understanding of Japanese culture.
"It sounds like a great idea," Japanese
language student Nikhil Sharma 'O9 said.
"I would be interested in going to the
movie showings and I think many students would attend the study sessions,"
Sharma said.
The club will also be holding larger,
school-wide events, including weekly
screenings of Japanese dramas and other
Japanese movies, as well as Japanese
food nights and perhaps a Sharpies takeover, according to Matthews.
In addition, the club will be providing

The intellectual resources and expertise of the department's faculty members
have enabled the club to extend its activities off campus.

as giving us some ideas to help us branch
out and get out of just the Swat bubble,"
Matthews said.

the language and culture of Japan.
Furthermore, Jo stressed the importance of allowing students to retain creative control over the club's mission and

SBC tight, but OK
From SBC, p. 3
The Activity Fee

Traditionally,

budget-

ary strains have been ame-

liorated by a small annual
increase in the student
activity fee, the component

of the college tuition that
serves the purpose offunding student groups on campus. In the past three
years, Student Council had
continuously agreed with
SBC's proposal not to
increase the student activity fee, although the decision was recently made to
raise the fee by $l6 for the
2008-2009 academic year,
which will bring in more
than an additional $20,000
for student groups funding
next year.
According to Student

Council President Peter
Gardner 'OB, the previous
decisions not to increase
the student activity fee
were based on the fact that
each year, SBC could
always depend on unspent
funds to balance the budg-

et, leading them to believe
that an increase in the student activity fee was
unnecessary.
"This year we were put
in the position of having a
lot less money that we had
in the past and more
demand in the number of
groups," Gardner said. "...
I understand that there
were legitimate reasons for

not increasing [the fee],
although I would always
say that it's wise to
increase it at least with

inflation. But it has put us
in a tough position now."

said.

There's no other

there is interest on campus
in visual arts, but that
doesn't have an outlet
through a magazine. So, in
theory, I'm a big fan of the
idea. I think it would be
well received. Practically, I
don't know if it's feasible to
have two issues a year

THE PHOENIX

Another example of an
expensive
publication
funded by SBC is the college's
yearbook
The
Halcyon. Between $50,000
to $60,000 of the student
activities budget is spent to
publish the yearbook each
year.
Although some
concerns as to the quality of
the yearbook have been
raised, recent structural
changes have occurred
within the editorial staff of
the yearbook, including

reallocating the responsi-

bilities of editor-in-chief
position among four separate editors. According to
Esquivel, these changes
have been made by SBC in
recognition of the heavy
workload that prevented
the staff from meeting
deadline and will hopefully
make the process easier for
student editors.

The new changes are
overseen by the Halcyon's
previous editor Sung Choi
'OB who is acting as a liaison to SBC.
The Future of the Budget

Although precautionary
funds like the Contingency
Fund are put aside for
times like now when the
budget is unusually tight,

is a limited budget with
which they can work,

according to the OIR Web site. The
number of women accepted in the
same time period stayed in the range
of 6,720 to 7,282.
Two-thirds of colleges and universities report that they get more
female than male applicants, said
Jennifer Delahunty Britz, the dean

wrote for The New York Times.

"We

women that the world is their oyster; the problem is, so many of them

admission to today's most selective
colleges are stiffer for women than
men," Britz wrote.
But many colleges are hesitant to

population notice less interest from

college, according to the NBC special.
"It would be horribly unfair for
them to lower the standards for men
to accommodate a balance," said
Kelly Nedimyer, a pre-dentistry
major at UCF. "I say, men, step it up,
because if you don't, we women will."
Gender balance is more of an issue
at smaller liberal arts colleges where
programs appeal more to female
applicants.
"In a large public university like
ours, where we have almost 48,000
students with 93 different college
majors, you really have to be as even
handed as you can across the board to
be able to build a community of students who can satisfy all those interests," said Chavis, who has worked in
admissions at various schools for 23
years.
But if the trend continues and girls
consistently perform better then their
male counterparts, gender balance
could be an issue that plagues all
schools, even the largest universities,
forcing them to choose between a pri-

marily female student body or having

different admissions standards for
men and women.
"Acceptance to any program or
institution should be based solely
t
upon the performance and abilities of
the applicants in question," said
Brent Wakelin, a musical theater
major at UCF. "Lowering standards
for men is the same as accepting a student because they belong to a certain
minority. Affirmative action is no
longer necessary in America.
Opportunities should be given to
those who deserve them, period."

Sinologists at Swat Vampire Weekend uninspired, hyped-up
BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

As China, after a century of
political misdirection, finally
begins to emerge as a full-fledged
superpower, and the forthcoming
Beijing Olympics promises to
give, the Middle Kingdom the
most worldwide attention it's
had since Tiananmen, it's a more
exciting time than ever for scholarship on China. From March
7th to 9th, while most Swatties
fled the campus for break, 36
undergraduate Chinese scholars
from 24 schools around the
world, including Swarthmore
itself, converged upon the
College to present their research
in the 7th Annual Junior

Scholars'

Conference

on

Sinology.
Presentation topics over the
two days of panels ran the gamut
from analyses of literature, old
("Outlaws of the Marsh") and
new ("The Old Capital"), to popular music to Chinese copyright
laws. But the theme unifying the
presentations was an emphasis
on "Self and Society," with the
two often standing in opposition
to one another. With the Tibet
protests being a recent reminder,
China has a long history of conflict between individuals and ideology.

Tedmund

Leung

from the

University of Hawaii at Manoa
took the co-opting of advertising
into state ideology in his presentation "Olympic Sponsors and
the Chinese Government." Leung
argued that various sponsors for
the summer events, from CocaCola to Samsung, have become
the unwitting advertisers of state
doctrine. In contrast to the culture

modern China is under threat of
westernization and if anything
China will be sino-fying the rest
of the world a little. "The Chinese
want to be modern but remain

fundamentally Chinese," Leung
said. History professor Lillian Li,
who moderated Leung's panel,
noted that "Perhaps few realize
how long it has taken Chinese
people to come to this point
where modernization and westernization can be conceptually
separate and when modernization does not pose a threat
because it is not necessarily [in
the form of a] stronger Western
imperialist influence."
The relation between art and
political ideology was explored
in the presentation "The Politics
of Censorship and Cultural
Expression:
Zhang Yimou's
Films
in Translation" by
Vanessa Hongsathavi from the
University
of
Southern
California. Hongsathavi compared Zhang Yimou's filmography from their sources in literature, so as to explore how Zhang
negotiates the stories with the
political and cultural climate of
his time.
Leung's presentation was
drawn heavily from firsthand
research from his experiences in
Beijing with him and his Chinese
professors looking through various clips from CCTV, China's
most prominent television channel. Field research directed
many of the students' presentations, including Christopher
Green 'O9, who interviewed
many from the massive population of undocumented migrant
workers in Beijing. Green found
that, in spite of hardships or dangers that these workers face, the
majority of his interviewees did
not feel that globalization was
unfavorably affecting them.
These were among the various topics on sinology that were
discussed during the conference,
which shed light on everything
from exploring the origins of the
Chinese Cinderella story to
Fletcher Coleman's 'O9 unveiling
of the tattoo he got in Beijing to
describe the new tattoo culture
in modern China.

"terse clockwork constructions" you mean two
uncomplicated chords, and by "equate cooperation
with mutual avoidance" you mean repeat those
chords for the duration of one entire song and vary
them only slightly on each subsequent track, then,
sure, Vampire Weekend's songs are undoubtedly
"terse clockwork constructions that equate cooperation with mutual avoidance."
But somehow, I have my doubts that Vampire
Weekend is as talented, thoughtful, or sophisticated as
all this media attention makes them seem, especially
with lyrics like "I wake up / My shoulder's cold / I've
got to leave here / Before I go /1 pull my shirt on," and
the more I hear, the more Pitchfork's 8.8 rating starts
to seem like it may just rival the 0.8 rating they gave
The Boy With The Arab (because even in 1998 I was
the coolest cat around and read tons of stuff about
music, and I totally mean this in a completely serious
non-post-ironic way, obviously) for the most baseless,
short-sighted piece of writing that website has ever
published (which is saying a lot, considering that
we're talking about the bane ofall human evil and terrible judgment right now, so take me seriously for just
a little while and then we can go back to fun and
games and bad jokes).
Though Pitchfork's nocturnal emission of a review
over Vampire Weekend's debut CD should have been
a clear and definitive sign to everyone that this band
is just not very good, the entire world has, apparently,
missed the small point that every child who watched
Lamb Chop, probably made better music with an
empty tissue box, a cardboard paper towel and a few
rubber bands than these guys can make with their
real instruments. The songs are boring, repetitive,
uninspired, immature and untalented. Not only do
these guys play the most commonplace instruments
you could possibly combine in one band, but they
even don't know how to play them well. And though

March 20, 2008

you might expect a group of four Columbia alumni to
at least write some moderately creative, poetic or literary lyrics, they cannot, apparently, come up with
anything better than "Take the chapstick / Put it on
your lips / Crack a smile / Adjust my tie."
There is absolutely nothing different or memorable about Vampire Weekend (and please don't spout
some bullshit about old Western African pop influences, because their sound is, really, nothing special).

Both musically and lyrically, they are utterly generic,

overly simplistic, mindlessly immature, completely

unskilled and entirely uncreative. The first time I listened to their self-titled debut album, I spent the first
three songs trying to figure out who I thought they
sounded like until I finally realized that the only reason they seemed so familiar was because they sound
like every single other pop group that exists right
now. When I told a friend what I was writing my column about and played "Oxford Comma" for them to
hear, they had the same reaction of "Oh, oh, wait, do
you know who this sounds like? It's like ... um ... hold
on," words that so closely mirrored my own initial
reaction to the music and confirmed, to me at least,
how markedly generic Vampire Weekend actually is.
And that, more than anything, is what Vampire
Weekend is markedly generic. Though their music
may not be the most jarring, terrible collection of
songs, there is nothing about this band that would
ever merit the sort of praise they've been receiving.
While music blogs and online resources do facilitate
and expand the circulation of new music to previously unattainableand unimaginable lengths, the competition between web sources to not fall behind the rest
or miss out on "the next big thing" can lead to an
almost self-sustainable, unstoppable chain of unmerited praise and inflated hype. One prominent and popular blog gives a mediocre band a glowing review, and
within just a few hours infinite other well-respected
blogs are updating their own websites, praising a
band that doesn't deserve praise just because a voice
that is perceived as authoritative singled out this one
band as remarkable and because they want to keep up
with the crowd. When one group starts to be singled
out as different and better than the rest, their name
travels so rapidly that within just a few weeks, they've
already established a reputation and start to attract
attention by name recognition alone.
While these online music sources do reach out to
hundreds of thousands of people and expose them to
new, alternative music, they also, often enough, contribute to the build up of the insatiable hype machine
information travels quickly enough, blogs are too
interdependent and rely too much on the opinions of
their affiliates and music websites care too much
about their reputations for being able to recognize
only the best music out of a mess ofbad demo tapes for
unfounded hype to not be an undesired byproduct.
With the praise surrounding Vampire Weekend, that
is precisely the case
there's not much more to this
band than unfounded internet hype.

TC Boyle, renowned author and creative writing professor of 30 years,
that he had not heard many times
before? Yet Boyle, dressed in punk
rock red Converse and a black
leather jacket, soon put me at ease
with his soft voice and stories of his
addiction to the craft of writing.
Although he has attained an
intimidating amount of critical suc-

when completing a story, he wanted
only to write creatively and to teach.
Today, Boyle has published 19 books
of fiction on a broad range of topics.
For Boyle, a story is "an exercise in
the imagination. It's a spark, it's a
riff, it's like playing jazz." Using a
mix of comedy, tragedy and fantasy,
his stories reach beyond the everyday to find a universal nub of truth.
Defying the old cliche "Write what

was never predestined or narrow. As
a high school student in New York's
Hudson Valley, he struggled to discover where his interests lay. "There
was always this pressure to be a

Boyle's eclectic fiction has garnered him an equally diverse group
of fans. "One reason that I think that
my stories have had wide appeal is
that there is nothing that I won't

Bent on a career in music, Boyle

in 1999, he has had the opportunity
to interact with his readers via a
monthly blog and a discussion
forum. "The best thing about it
is...when you have contact with people who have read your work in a
way that is interpretive and they get
what you are doing," Boyle said.
Although the forum has endured its
fair share of hackers, Boyle takes
great pleasure in watching the creation of an active community
focused on but not limited to his
work.
Before the Internet age, "if you

and finally found his passion. "I didn't care in the slightest bit about [the
future]. I just thought, 'I am going to
do what I am going to do.'"
With an MFA and a PhD in nineteenth century British literature

Unveiling the inspiration for Marc Jacobs' Fall 2008 collection
In interviews, Mr. Jacobs' demeanor was
coy, remarking, "I wasn't very inspired this
season. I just live my life." This marked a
distinct change from his behavior at last
season's shows, when, fresh out of rehab, he

MEAGAN HU

It's a Scientific Lifestyle
I've managed to get halfway through the
semester without even alluding to Marc
Jacobs, but that's about to end because of
the recent New York Fashion Week show for
his Fall 2008 collection. One disclaimer
here: my interpretation of the show is limited to what YouTube will offer. Nonetheless,
I was able to experience enough of the show
for it to have inspired a column. It wasn't
just a fashion show. It was also a live Sonic
Youth concert. Models in suits, skirts, coats
and gowns all constructed with the unifying motif of a bubble silhouette, with voluminous balloons of fabric gathered at the
lower back, paraded in a semi-circle around
the band as they performed "Jams Run
Free" and "Kool Thing."

THE PHOENIX

was two hours late in starting the Marc
Jacobs show, and at the end of his Louis
Vuitton show, stuck out his tongue at the
fashion critic Suzy Menkes for a rather
unfavorable review she wrote of him.
Needless to say, he became an easy target of
media criticism. This time around, however, Mr. Jacobs seemed intent on not creating
a spectacle of himself and his show, which
only started 17 minutes late. The designer
himself even came out beforehand to tell
guests to hurry up and take their seats. And
for the finale, rather than have the models
come back out for an encore parade, they
merely stood on a balcony suspended from
the dimly lit rafters while Kim Gordon
chanted the last few lines of "Kool Thing."
The clothes, like Marc Jacobs' approach
to this show, were rather calm and subdued,
enveloping the models in a muted pallete of
grays and pastels that in stark contrast to

his last collection for Spring 2008. There, the
clothes were deconstructed, revealing and
pulsating with color, necessary to inviting a
strong reaction from the audience in order
to exact their full effect. The pieces for the
Fall 2008 collection, however, were more
self-contained and inward-looking, relying
neither on the audience nor on the manipulation of previous ideas to derive meaning.

The clothes encased the models in a cocoon
of sorts, creating a sense of distance

between the viewer and the model, a sense
that was emphasized by the dissonant riffs
ofSonic Youth. And the juxtaposition of the
models, stiff and stately while marching
across the stage, with Kim Gordon, gyrating
in a black and white sequined mini-dress,
compounded a sense of detachment.
One of the most striking looks of the collection was one in which the model's face
was enshrouded in a sheer white veil, whicb
to me recalled the Magritte
"The Lovers" in which a
man and woman kisr
from behind white
cloths which cover
each of their heads.
In both cases, the
cloth over the face

The clothes suggested a safe haven for
those days when you would rather not step
outside the house but must. This message
seemed particularly appropriate, considering Mr. Jacob's high-profile celebrity clientele, who at times could probably benefit
from this type of anonymity. During the

song "Kool Thing," after Kim Gordon sang
the line "Are you gonna liberate us girls
from male, white, corporate domination?"
she ad-libbed, "Are you gonna liberate
Britney?" I don't have the time (or
care) to figure out all the drama
going on in that poor
woman's life. All I know is
that

context
of
"The
Lovers," that's quite a
bleak prospect. But within the context
of the fashion show and the recent controversy surrounding Mr. Jacob's personal life,
it's somewhat comforting. In this way, his
approach to this show stands as a sort of
retreat from all the flashiness and often
mindless hype that fashion can induce. Of
course, a Marc Jacobs show never fails to be
a spectacle, but here the spectacle had more
to do with Kim Gordon's presence (as probably the hottest 54-year-old you'll ever see)
rather than with the clothes.

this Fall 2008 collection, Mr. Jacobs seems to

lights. Here, he proposed a sartorial shield,
a way to avoid constantly being on display

MSA challenges need for spiritual advisors

At the end of last
year, members of the
Students
Muslim

Association sat down
with
Dean
for
Multicultural Affairs

Darryl Smaw to dis-

cuss how the year
went for the Muslim
students
of
Swarthmore. It had
been a rough one.
They felt marginalized, Humzah Soofi
'lO recounted, thanks
JULIAN CHENDER
in part to the Phoenix
printing an advertiseThe Spiritual Scene
ment that equated the
crescent with the
swastika.
The students wanted an advisor, someone to stand up
for them and to help them navigate the difficult channels
of Swarthmore's bureaucracy. How about an Imam? After
all, the other monotheistic groups
and only the
monotheistic groups
had religious advisors. Dean
Smaw supported the idea, and all agreed to pursue it further in the fall.
According to Dean Smaw, religious advisors exist at
Swarthmore "to help maintain the religious traditions
that many of the students bring to the campus and also to
guide them in the questions and the answers, and in the
programming." An Imam in this capacity, it seemed,
would fulfill MSA's needs.
Currently there' are three advisors on campus:
Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. Though they receive the
majority of their salaries from outside sources, the
College does chip in. Furthermore, Swarthmore furnishes
the religious advisors with offices, supplies and access to
students. The school exchanges these carrots for control
over "how religious groups should or should not act on
campus," requiring the religious advisors to meet regu-

With this network of faculty and the continued support of Dean Smaw, MSA has gotten the help it needed
without sacrificing the integrity of the group. These fac-

ulty members nurture the students and provide logistical

support, while the students themselves can stand up for
the group.
This raises an interesting question: If MSA doesn't

need a religious advisor, then do the Catholics,

Protestants and Jews? And if they do, then don't the
Hindus, Baha'is and Pastafarians need religious advisors
too? Also, how come other groups on campus don't have

advisors? I'd love to meet the Boy Meets Tractor comedy
guru.

The college and its religious community benefit greatly
from Protestant religious advisor Joyce Tompkin's interfaith advising. She provides all religious groups with the
nurturing and logistical support that MSA found in the
Muslim faculty and Dean Smaw. Perhaps she couldbecome
Assistant Dean for Religious Affairs and work further on
cultivating a strong interfaith community.

When MSA reconvened after summer break, the students voted unanimously against adding an Imam to the
roster of religious advisors. They realized that they
weren't looking for spiritual guidance or clarification on
religious doctrine, but someone to help them nurture the

"The Phoenix ad had just been printed and Nonie
Darwish spoke on campus. We just really felt like we
needed support and someone who could stand up for us,"
Ailya Vajid 'O9 explained. "We laterrealized that an Imam
was not that person, and now we've finally come to see
that we support one another and that we ourselves need
to stand up for MSA."
This sense of community and personal responsibility
pervades MSA and makes it a role model for religious
groups on campus. The students refused the offer of an
Imam because such a person would undermine this fundamental aspect of their group.
Religion can serve a central role in the lives of college
students, who, having moved away from home, look to
forge their own identities. For members of the MSA, questions such as "What does it mean to be Muslim in this
world, at Swarthmore, at this age?" receive significant
attention. For questions like these, there are as many
answers as there are people asking.
In finding one's own answers to such questions, dis-

cussion is invaluable. Members of MSA come together to
talk about their experiences as Muslims and share their
views on various issues concerning their, religion. In this
way, they explore these questions together, from many
different angles. They feared that having an Imam, a religious figurehead, would take away from the community
effort on which all college religious groups should base
themselves.
MSA found the external help it needed in Muslim faculty. The students have received a lot of help from
Assistant Professor of Religion Tariq al-Jamil, Associate
Professor of Sociology and Anthropology Farha Ghannam
and Professor of Engineering Faruq Siddiqui, who helps
the students lead their weekly prayer meeting. Arabic
Lecturer Yamine Mermer has become the group's unofficial advisor. She leads the weekly Qur'anic Circle, which

You are what you eat, and how you behave
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

After dealing with arcane juice regulations, mandatory servings of miscellaneous vegetables and arbitrary definitions of 'dessert,' Sharpies is a paradise of
fresh fruit, second helpings of pasta and

burrito makings.

Technically, Sharpies is all-you-caneat. This means, just to review, all the
food you can expect to consume over the
course of the meal. Just because Sharpies
has something special, like Ben and
Jerry's ice cream or pluots, doesn't turn
"all-you-can-eat" into "all-you-might-eatin-the-next-week." These are special
treats for everyone, and if you take more
than Sharpies thought each student

MOLLY PIELS
MAIRIN ODLE
The Etiquette Fairy

It's hard to beat Sharpies for convenience: it's close, it's fast and you don't
have to wash the dishes. Compared to
fending for yourself, it's a pretty sweet
deal. But alas, with familiarity comes contempt, or something like that. We understand that all the complaining is a feeble

attempt to build interpersonal relationships, just like talking about the weather,
or playing misery poker. But much like
your mother used to remind you about all
the starving children somewhere who
would really like those Brussels sprouts
(you ungrateful wretch), we suggest a
tiny, tiny side dish of perspective. We'll
admit that after four years we don't get
jazz hands at the thought of appetizer bar.
But if you're into experiential learning,
try a Scottish dining hall for months.

would, you're effectively taking someone

else's. And don't think that we didn't see
you with five containers of Phish Food.
Because we did, and we haven't forgotten.
Silverware, cups, plates and salt shak-

ers are not special treats, but it is still
"unacceptable to take more than you need.
Specifically, whoever has taken all the
salt shakers from Sharpies needs to
return them pronto. If you are doing
tequila shots so often that it seems impossible to go without your own personal salt
shaker, please seek help. Every time we
get hash browns, we have to go on a mad
hunt around the dining hall looking for
salt and pepper, and it's starting to get
old. If you find yourself in the same situation, please remember to ask others nicely if you can use their salt shaker. The
same goes for chairs. We promise they
won't say no, and it's always better to ask
than to appropriate.
Taking excessively is bad, but so is giving. It's a small campus, germs spread
quickly, and we can only assume that the
popular practice of grabbing every apple
in turn until the perfect apple is discov-

ered contributes to this. Yes, some apples
do have bad spots, but that's why we have
knives. Additionally, the Goldilocks-like
practice of handling three hundred bowls
until you find just the right one for your
cereal needs to stop, please. Do not use
your hands to grab cheese for your sandwich. Do not crawl under the sneeze
guard to get your olives. That sneeze
guard is all that stands between us and
another round of the Garnet Plague, so
desist.

If we see you clapping
when someone drops their
plate, we will only assume
that you never graduated
from fourth grade.
What about "giving" your food, in projectile form, to a friend at a nearby table?
Not OK. Not in elementary school, not
ever. If you are indoors, someone will
have to clean that up; since we have never
seen a food fighter scrambling under the
table to pick up any (let alone every) pea
they have thrown, we will assume that
that someone is not you. Given that no
one has perfect aim, there are also likely
to be innocent bystanders, or at the very
least people are likely to have to change
direction to avoid getting hit. Maybe that
guy from math class enjoys fishing
banana slices out of his pasta, but most
likely he doesn't, and experimenting is
not, in this case, the best way to find out.
Speaking of elementary school, if we
see you clapping when someone drops

their plate, we will only assume that you
never graduated from fourth grade.
Unless you drop something, and then start
clapping for yourself, and turn it into an
elaborate bit of performance art, this
behavior is rude. Even in the scenario
above it's still annoying.
Let's say you did graduate fourth
grade. In fact, your etiquette skills are so
advanced that you'd like to ask someone
to share a meal with you at Sharpies. This
is already tricky, but it gets trickier; at
some point, one of the two of you will have
an awkward decision to make: do you
start to eat before the other person gets
back, or wait? Starting can be risky,
because then you may end up finished and
itching for a cookie when your friend is
only halfway through their Pad Thai.
At the same time, waiting can seem
creepy and your perfectly constructed
burrito can unwrap itself and get cold.
Despite this, we're fans of waiting; it can
often be a good idea to invent an activity,
like getting a cup of tea, or if you're really concerned about food getting cold you
could microwave it, to pass the time.
Added bonus: you won't have to suffer
through the awkwardness of watching
your dining partner make their way
toward the table. In a group, of course, it's
absurd to wait for every single person,
because you never know who is going to
run in to their lab partner and need to tell
them something really complicated. So go
ahead and start, but eat slowly. Tell stories about the person who's taking so
long. But don't get any ideas about taking
extra servings of Ben and Jerry's while
you wait.

Lifestyles of the rich and famous, on a student budget
BY JOAN KIM

jkiml@swarthmore.edu

So you've already seen the Liberty Bell, eaten a Philly
cheese steak and walked up the Philadelphia Museum steps
humming the theme to Rocky
what else could you possibly find to do in the great city of Philadelphia with your meager savings and continuously thinning wallet? While it
might seem like there's nothing affordable left to do beyond
Swarthmore's borders, there are, believe it or not, quite a
few other activities in Philadelphia that won't break your
especially if you're looking at the arts. Although
wallet
plays and operas may seem out of your price range, they are
cheaper than you might expect, especially if you make use of
student discounts.
Though the opera might seem intimidating, there truly is
no better time than the present to try it out. This so-calleddying art is now more accessible than ever. The libretto,
whether it is in French, Spanish or Italian, is supplemented
with supertitles above the stage. The Philadelphia Opera
Company, which regularly performs at the Kimmel Center,
will next be performing Norma with tickets on sale at prices
of $7 to $205. The Opera Club on campus provided a limited
number of college-subsidized opera tickets for $6 a pop for
the past opera "Cyrano" and the upcoming "Norma." "We
don't do Student Rush Tickets. We buy them in advance so
there is no risk [of not getting a ticket]," Treasurer of the
Opera Club Mattie Gregor 'lO said. With the funding the
Opera Club received from SBC, the Opera Club purchased a
number of tickets and advertised them through Reserved
Students Digest and posters on campus. "There was way
more interestthan the number of tickets," Gregor added. For
those unable to receive tickets, Student Rush tickets are
available at the Academy of Music Box Office with a student
ID. The tickets are $5 for seats in the Amphitheater or half
price to sit anywhere else if your wallet allows.
The Kimmel Center offers Student Rush tickets on a
"show-by-show basis" that can be purchased 30 minutes
before each performance for $lO per ticket with a student ID.
THE PHOENIX

These tickets are only one per person. If the Kttnmel Center
does not provide Student Rush for a particular show, they
also offer the community rush program where a number of
$lO tickets go on sale two and a half hours before the performance, cash only, one per person. This includes the
Philadelphia Orchestra's performances. "It was really simple and we got really great seats to see a great concert for a
low price," Alyssa Van Thoen 'OB said.
The Pennsylvania Ballet also provides Student Rush tickets one hour before each performance for $2O in the Parquet
Circle, sections A, B, H, and I. "It was a very spontaneous
move for us to see the Messiah at the Academy of Music.
Originally, we were supposed to see the orchestra at the
Kimmel Center but they ran out of rush tickets," Javier
Camacho 'O9 said. But the abrupt change of plans was not too
out of the way since these performances were all in the same
area. Camacho found rush tickets were still available 30
minutes prior to the dance performance.
The Cadillac Broadway Series at the Kimmel Center
offers only Community Rush tickets on a "show-by-show
basis," not Student Rush tickets. These tickets are available
two and halfhours before the show for $2B and must be paid
for in cash. According to Camacho, this method was more of
a hassle since it was cash only and more expensive.
However, if you need your Broadway fix, this is one of many
places to get it.
If you are looking for free performances, there are a variety of free but not as exciting events at the Kimmel Center
all found on their website including pre-performance talks,
an American Composers Forum and various DJs all in the
Commonwealth Plaza Stage.
The Curtis Institute of Music also provides many performances, some of which are at the Kimmel Center. Curtis
hosts performances with some of the up and coming musical
talents. The Curtis Opera Theater sells single tickets for $22$33 per show. The repertoire of the 2007-2008 season included
Mozarts Le Nozze di Figaro, Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore and
the Golijov's Ainadamar. The Curtis Symphony Orchestra
at the Kimmel Center sells tickets from $5-$36 and often have

March 20, 2008

world renowned soloists such as the pianist Leon Fleisher,
who played with the New York Philharmonic at age 16 and
famously lost the use of his right hand in 1965, but has
recently regained the use of it. Alumni Recital Concerts are
$2B and Student Recitals are usually held Monday through
Wednesday and on Fridays at Bpm, which are free. The ticket office, located on 1726 Locust St., Philadelphia is convenient and easy to find.

Although plays and operas may
seem out of your price range, they
are cheaper than you might expect
if you make use of
student discounts.
Although New York's Broadway and London's West End
cannot be rivaled, the Philadelphia theater scene is thriving.
Theaters such as the Walnut Street Theater, the Arden
Theater Company and the New Freedom Theater are only a
few of the many theaters in Philadelphia showing Man of La
Mancha, The Odd Couple, Les Miserables and My Fair Lady.
The Walnut Street Theater sells day-of-show tickets from $3O
to $4O that can be purchased online, by phone or in person.
For the Youth Tickets program, tickets are $l5 for buyers 24
years and younger, per ID per person purchased only in person. $lO tickets are available for every performance in the
Upper Mezzanine. These too can be purchased in advance.
Theaters through Philadelphia all offer special deals such as
the Walnut Street Theater but be sure to call the box office
for complete details.

All of these deals are subject to change and it is advisable
to call the box office in advance to ensure availability of tickets and for information on when and where to purchase
them.

the most pertinent
issues
of
Swarthmore's institutional development. My impression is that the Council
served a kind of advisory role to the
Board of Managers and the President's
Office in the decision to eliminate loans
from the College as part of a student's
financial aid package (federal loans are
still on the table). The Council also
served as a sounding board for student
opinion in its well-attended open meeting about institutional development last
month.

BENJAMIN BRADLOW
Clothes Line Saga
Current Student Council President
Gardner 'OB entered his office
under a cloud of controversy and a slight
win over "none of the above" in last
spring's elections. Many were skeptical
of the future role of a Council that had
just received a thorough browbeating,
mainly on the part of the campus's cultural groups. In the controversy's aftermath, I think most students have been
pleasantly surprised on some counts by
both the agenda and effectiveness of the
Council under Gardner's leadership.
Before I go any further, I should disclose that Gardner is a good friend of
mine. Still, I have to admit that I understood some of the concerns the cultural
groups brought up during what one student dubbed "Peter-gate" on a Daily
Gazette comments section. The basic
fact was and is that the most important student-run organizations have a
spotty record in their responsiveness to
Peter

all kinds of minority groups.
What was frustrating for some stu-

dents about last spring's debate speaks
to a greater concern about the role of
Student Council. While Gardner has
gained some respect for the Council by
casting it as an effective agent of change
in day-to-day student life (extended
Kohlberg coffee bar hours, extended
McCabe library hours, etc.), the Council
appears to have ceded any claim to a
greater policy agenda.

Too much of the
student body remains
either willfully or
unintentionally ignorant
about these issues...
When cultural groups lambasted the
presidential candidates for their lack of
familiarity with the groups' policy concerns, the debate, became too much
about how many minority friends a candidate had or how many cultural events

they attended, instead of challenging the
candidates to develop a clear policy
agenda that spoke to these groups'

desires.

Coming out of this haze, it might
have been unfair to expect this year's
Council to pursue a concrete agenda on

THE PHOENIX

These were good steps to regain credibility and visibility for an organization
that had been slipping into a malaise of
apathy and resume-padding. But the
upcoming Council should not be content
to follow in the footsteps of its predecessors. Last semester's vice-presidential
race hinted at both the possibilities and
potential shortcomings of this semester's elections.
Each candidate ran on a platform
that made vague policy pronouncements, though there appeared to be no
consensus about what the policy agenda
should even be, let alone what kinds of
differences the candidates had on a
given policy. Too much of the debate
focused on continued student life concerns or misguided policy initiatives
like "Thanksgiving in Spring," which,
as was obvious to anybody following the
issue, would never reach approval by
the
faculty
or Provost
Connie
Hungerford.
To build on both the successes and

limitations of this year's Council, the
new crop of as yet undeclared presidential candidates should craft a policy
agenda that indicates an understanding
of the Council's potential as an engine
for policy change in Swarthmore's longterm institutional development, its centrality to the operation of all student
government institutions and its role as
an advocate for basic student life needs.
Too much of the student body remains
either willfully or unintentionally ignorant about these issues, and this ends up
extending to much of the candidate pool

the

editor

for Council positions.
So allow me to propose a new set of
criteria for presidential platforms. At
the very least, students should know
what each candidate believes is the most
important issue for the Council to pursue under their leadership under three

Apt questions by protesters

different categories: (1) long-term institutional development, (2) operations of
student government and (3) student life.
What do candidates think about the con-

tinuing goals of the college to attract and

retain racial and socio-economic minority students?
How much oversight should the
Council have over the funding decisions
of the Student Budget Committee? What
should be the nature of common student
space on campus? These are just examples of questions candidates could
address in each category.
It is time for the Council to reach its

long-abdicated potential as an effective

leader of students and student government at Swarthmore. The upcoming
elections are the right time to build on
the harrowing elections of a year ago, as
well as the smaller successes that came
out of their wake.

To the Editor:
I would like to thank Swarthmore for

the panel discussion entitled

Meets the World: Olympics,
Modernization, and Transformation" and
for making the event free and open to the

"China

public.

We should remember
that some of the
"clutter" that China is
shoving into the
closet is human.
I enjoyed reading the summary by
Rosario Paz, which I thought was accurate
except on one important point. The two

Falun Gong practitioners who spoke did
not make comments that were "only loose-

March 20, 2008

ly related to the topics discussed at the
event."
They were, in fact, responding to slander created by the Chinese government
and repeated by the Chinese students

about the practice.
The question of religious freedom had
been brought up by a Swarthmore student,
so the practitioners' comments were in no
way irrelevant.
One of the Chinese students, in
response to another question, likened
China's preparations for the Olympics to
the situation of a student who has guests
coming to a messy dorm room. The solu-

tion is to shove the clutter into a closet.
While that is a cute and appealing analogy, we should remember that some of the
"clutter" that China is shoving into the
closet is human.

perhaps

the

man. What is this all about? Well surely you must have
heard by now!? Why, Barack Obama finally came out as
a black man!
And thank goodness, since I was starting to feel a bit
hopeless about the man. For quite some time now, I've been
listening to Marvin Gaye croon away in "I Want You" and
fancying the song to be a coded account of my feelings for

Barack. Marvin pines: "I want you / But I want you to want
me, too / Want you to want me, baby / Just like I want you.
/1 give you all the love that I want in return, sweet darlin' /
But half a love is all I feel."
And so too do I yearn for Barack. I don't mean in a sexual sense, mind you, at least not for the purposes of this column. No, the feelings that Gaye so poetically captures for
me are not so much passionately romantic as they are passionately political.

political

You see, I've wanted Barack for the black community
and people of color everywhere for awhile. In fact, I've wanted Barack ever since I heard him speak at the Democratic
National Convention in 2004. With so much of the lightsand-smoke media blitz spotlighting following the convention, I just knew he was the one for me —err, us. I was sure,
what's more, that he was the real deal, a born leader and
champion if I ever saw one. I wanted him to want to lead the

black community, and I wanted him to want me

err, us
too. We'd been invigorated in the past, most recently by the
hoopla surrounding Harold Ford, Jr. and Condoleezza Rice,
but eventually, it always became apparent that these ones
were for one reason or another just not meant to be.
Now that I mention it, Barack initially seemed like he
was heading the way of Condoleezzauntil this Tuesday, and
that's what had me so hopeless. It seems to be the trend that
once you reach the heights of power and get a whiff of the
air up there, the political stratosphere becomes your world.
Try as people might, it's hard to live in that world and not
be of it; sooner or later, they forget where they came from
and why they started out on the path of power in the first
place. That's the explanation I like to believe for the
Condoleezza types, anyways.

As for the Harold Ford, Jr. cut of black political superstars, they're the type that try to assert themselves —their
concerns and their agenda, as informed by their upbringing
and their communities
but they are politically persecuted and maimed for doing so, casualties of a sublimated but
still-vibrant undercurrent of racism in our society.
This Tuesday, however, Barack proved that he is it, the
one: the lucky guy who beat the odds to champion our community and our causes. Sure, the media and other political
players have been trying to narrowly define his candidacy
in terms of race, continually hijacking the debate with exit
poll demographic breakdowns and allegations of phantom

'race cards' left and right. The Obama campaign, for thenpart, always downplayed Barack's race, sometimes evading
the issue altogether. These tactics led some people (myself
included) to fear that he did not want to have anything to do
with the majority of black people. Following some testy and
pressing questions about his pastor, though, Barack, rather
than continuing this evasive action, did an about-face and
addressed 'the race issue' head-on, delivering a truly inspirational speech.
Granted, he invoked his blackness inadvertently, masterfully casting the issues of race and the black community
as a part of the nation's issues, American issues, but now,
whether he intended to or not, he has indisputably thrown
himself in with the lot of black people everywhere. Some
analysts say that this speech could pave the way for his

effective marginalization, and by extension, the downfall of
his candidacy.
Heck, I say he's more likely now to get my vote in
November than ever. (For the record, I haven't yet decided
between the candidates.) Some people say that his cushy,
cosmopolitan upbringing under the care of white relatives
means he isn't really black, but I'll be the last person to
make any point about authenticity. I say I'm just glad to

have him on board!
He said, "I can no more disown [Reverend Wright] than
I can disown the black community." I say hallelujerr, man,
you're finally some makin' sense! I'm glad he has claimed
blackness in a public and decisive fashion. Barack, if you're
out there, thanks for coming out as a black man. Lots of us
have been wanting you for a long time now, and I sure am
glad to know for sure that you want us, too, just like we
want you. Now if only you could get your girl Oprah to come
out...err, as a black woman, that is.

Downtown Swat 2020
The Ville offers many great services to Swarthmore students,
such as the Co-Op, Co-Ed Salon, PNC Bank, dry cleaners, library, post
office and hardware store. Yet, when we more thoroughly examine
the Ville's recreational and commercial offerings, we find few attractions compelling enough to lure Swatties away from the well-beaten
stomping grounds of McCabe and Sharpies. This past week, Da
Vinci's Cafe closed, signaling the somewhat baffling failure of a highly accessible establishment whose proprietor publicized no small
numberof promotional deals designed explicitly to accommodate the
collegiate consumer
exemplified by the frugal yet caffeine-dependent Swarthmore students who rarely go under the SEPTA tracks.
Da Vinci's inability to turn a profit speaks to the utilitarian character of the Ville's commercial climate, which sustains businesses
that offer vital and pragmatic services, but little else. It is true that
a town like Swarthmore would certainly not function very well without most of the business mentioned above, but if the borough wants
to have a pedestrian culture
one that encourages students and borough residents alike to browse storefronts recreationally and not necessarily with a specific destination in mind
the Ville and the college should collaborate to incentivize businesses that provide desirable, but not necessarily essential, services. Although we are lucky to
have Cheng Hing, Renato's, Dunkin Donuts and Vicky's to remedy
our Sharpies fatigue, we find ourselves wishing for other options.
What Swarthmore lacks is a pedestrian culture, and part of the
problem is that there are just not many places to visit in the townfor
diversion from the onslaught of classes. Students and locals need
places in the Ville that they can go to both to fulfill their errands and
to relax. The Swarthmore that we see in 2020 will still have a smalltown feel, but with more features common to a college town. At the
very least, the town should have a pharmacy, bookstore, cafe and a
nice sit-down restaurant, along with a few more shopping opportuni-

ties. By 2020, the Ville will hopefully also include the stores built in
the Swarthmore Inn Project, maybe even helping along the town in
its future development.
Akey hurdle we see to future development in the Ville is the lack
of commercial zoning, which is unfortunate given some of the vacancies in the town. Since we believe in the ability of the market to meet
the demands of our consumerist tendencies, we, students and residents, are the ones to blame for the lack of traditional college town
businesses. Maybe one option the College could explore is facilitating
student use of their student IDs in the Ville, though there are many
other options that could have a great affect on the Ville. With the
right planning, however, we are optimistic that the town will be able
to support more student-friendly destinations and still retain its
friendly character and small-town charm.

No-hitter highlights softball's sweet spring break trip
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY BEN RAPHEL
braphell@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore Softball team had a busy spring break,
playing ten games in five days and traveling to North
Carolina and Maryland.
After struggling to a 2-4 start, the team won three of
their last four games to finish its break with a 5-5 record.
Highlights of the trip included a no-hitter from Kathryn
Riley 10 against Wilson College and impressive offensive
output from first-years Maggie Vizcarra 11 and Melissa
Emmerson 1L
"I'm really happy with where we are right now [5-5],"
Riley said in an e-mail. "I think that we played well and
held our own against very talented and established pro-

grams."

"The competition was really amazing; it was the best
we had ever faced on spring break," Christine Sendelsky
'O9 said.
The Garnet began its break by traveling to North
Carolina to play a series of three doubleheaders in three
days. The first doubleheader was on March 11 at Methodist
University. The Monarchs, who are the two-time defending
USA South conference tournament champions, proved to
be too tough for the Garnet, winning both games. In the
first game, Swarthmore was shut out, 5-0. Despite a strong
complete game by pitcher Al Zelaski 'O9, the Garnet could
never get its offense rolling, and only managed four hits
during the game.
In the second game of the doubleheader, Swarthmore
was able to get on the board, thanks to a two-run single by
Vizcarra in the sixth inning. However, the Garnet still fell
short by the score of 4-2. Riley pitched a complete game in
the losing effort.
On March 12, the team played a twin bill against Peace
College, losing a heartbreaking first game but rebounding
to win the second game.
The Garnet jumped outto a 4-0 lead in game one, thanks
to a two-run home run by Vizcarra in the first inning, followed by a two-run single in the fifth by Katherine Gold
'OB. Peace cut Swarthmore's lead in half with two runs in
the bottom of the fifth. The Pacers delivered a knockout
punch by scoring three runs in the seventh and final
inning, winning the first game 5-4.
The second game was a different story though, as the
resilient Garnet squad never trailed to earn its first victory of the season, by the score of 8-2. Leading the way
for Swarthmore were Lauren - Walker 'O9, Riley,
Sendelsky and Vizcarra, all of whom had two hits and
one RBI.

"Spring break is always a little different than the rest of
the season because you don't get the opportunity to make
corrections the next day at practice because you play consecutive days," Riley said in an e-mail. "I think that the
team did a great job of making corrections and adjustments from game to game and showed how resilient this
team is."

"We're a serious hitting team with
good depth, so other teams
will have to watch out."
Christine Sendelsky 'O9

pitched a two-hit complete game to pick up her first win of
the season. "Our hitting started to click, but we didn't
make any errors on Saturday, so our defense really was
key," Emmerson said.
Saturday afternoon's game, however, was a different
story, and Swarthmore could never get the offense going
against Salisbury. The Sea Gulls scored six runs in the second inning en route to a 7-0 victory.
Swarthmore also played two on Sunday, first against
Capital College, followed by another game against Wilson.
With the score tied at two during the first game with
Capital, Emmerson hit a home run in the top of the sixth
inning, bringing Gold home with her in the process, to
put the Garnet over the edge. Swarthmore scored four
more runs in the top of the seventh, and won by the
count of 8-2. Zelaski picked up her second win of the
weekend, giving up only three runs during her complete
game.

Last Thursday, March 13, Swarthmore split a doubleheader against Guilford College, losing 5-4 in the first
game but coming back to take the nightcap, 7-1
In the first game, the Quakers jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the first inning, and added two more in the bottom of the
fourth. Swarthmore attempted to come back in the top of
the fifth, as Vizcarra and Emmerson each hit doubles for
one and two RBIs, respectively. Emmerson herself would
later score in the inning. However, this strong effort was
still not enough to overcome the previous deficit, and the
Garnet lost the first game to Quakers, 5-4.
In game two, Swarthmore struck in the first inning

when Gold hit a two-run single and later scored herself
on a wild pitch, to put the Garnet up 3-0. The Garnet
never looked back, scoring four more runs during the
game and winning 7-L Riley had another great outing on
the mound, giving up only five hits and one run over
seven innings.
"The fact that we came through and won our second
game was a big deal, because the loss didn't keep us down,"
Emmerson said.
On Saturday, March 15 and Sunday, March 16, the
Garnet spent the weekend at Salisbury University in
Maryland to compete in the 2008 Sea Gull Tournament.
Swarthmore went 3-1 on the weekend, losing only to the
host school.
The first game, on Saturday morning against Wilson
College, was no contest from the start, and the Garnet
rolled to a 3-0 victory. Emmerson hit a two-run single in
the top of the first to score Riley and Sendelsky. The
Garnet added an insurance run in the fifth, when Walker
scored off a Vizcarra single. On the mound, Zelaski

"Al [Zelaski] and Riley both pitched really well,"
we only have two pitchers,
both can hold their own and are capable of winning games
Sendelsky said. "Even though

themselves."
In its second game of the day, Riley pitched the first nohitter for Swarthmore softball since 1988, as the Garnet
cruised to a 17-0 victory over Wilson. The game was
stopped short after five innings due to the mercy rule,
since Swarthmore had racked up four, five and eight runs
in the second, third and fourth innings, respectively.
Riley also led the way offensively, going 3-for-4 with 7
RBIs on the day. In addition, Walker and Lauren Marczi 'll
hit 4-for-4 and 3-for-3 respectively on the day. In the bottom
of the fourth, Emmerson hit her second home run of the
day, and went 3-for-4 on the game. Overall, the Garnet had
17 total hits during this stellar performance.
"By the end of the week, everyone was contributing to
the wins; it was a team effort for sure," Emmerson said.
The team's performance over break should be a good
sign of things to come.
"This spring break was the next step in building our
program here and was great preparation for the remainder
of this season, especially conference play, as well as the
postseason," Riley said.
Next up for the Garnet is a doubleheader at Penn StateBerks on Saturday at 1 p.m. The team will be at home next
Tuesday for two games against Arcadia University.
"I'm hoping that the harder competition we faced this
week prepares us for our upcoming conference games,"
Sendelsky said. "I think we'll be really competitive; we're
a serious hitting team with good depth, so other teams will
have to watch out."

Miller and Lewis earn Ail-American Honors

Jennie Lewis 'OB and Anne Miller 'lO

competed in the 2008 NCAA Division 111
Swimming and Diving Championships from
March 13-15 at the Corwin Nixon Aquatic
Center at Miami (OH) University.
Between Miller's 2nd and 10th place finishes and Lewis's 13th place finish, they
scored 28 points, bringing home a tie for
30th place for Swarthmore. This is the thirdhighest placing that the Swarthmore
women's swim team has ever achieved at
Nationals.

Swarthmore also finished ahead of all its
conference rivals: "It's very difficult to get
into Nationals, and I'm proud of what they
did. Both in the season and after conferences, they stayed focused on competing at
Nationals, not just going there," said Coach

ing the race in 57.36 seconds. "I was really
impressed with Jennie's morning swim
she works so hard, she really deserves it
[the record] and it was a beautiful swim,"

Miller said.
"I am definitely getting a picture of it
before I leave Swat as it [the record] won't
be there for long
I'm looking forward to
Anne challenging that record next year,"
Lewis said.

"What they did

was spectacular."

Miller, a sophomore standout, brought
home second place in the 200-yard butterfly, the best individual finish for a
Swarthmore swimmer in the history of the
program (Jill Belding '99 finished 6th in
1996 and Bth in 1997, and Sky Fulkerson-Tar
'96 finished 7th in 1995 and 6th in 1996).
She earned All-American Honors for the
second consecutive year, improving on her
fifth place finish in the 200-yard butterfly
last year. "When I finished, I thought that I
had read the score board wrong, but I
looked down to the other end of the pool
and saw Jennie screaming and was just in
shock. It was so much fun I was on a natural high for the rest of the night," gushed
Miller.
Her time, an impressively fast 2:02:44, is
both a Swarthmore College and Centennial

Lacrosse teams kick season into high gear
Men’s team stays hot through spring break
BY LAUREN WALKER
lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore men’s lacrosse team con-

tinued its success this spring break and had
some fun at the same time, coming home from
their trip to Florida with a still flawless record
of 4-0.
Before their departure, the Garnet took on
the United States Merchant Marine Academy
on Saturday, March 8, overcoming the harsh
weather conditions to defeat the Mariners 9-8.
On Monday they flew south to Sanford,
Florida, where they trained and played
through Sunday, March 16. The weather in the
south welcomed the team pleasantly, a stark
contrast to the cold winds and rain that they
had previously fought at home. “It was sunny,
and it stayed in the 70s pretty much all week,”
Alex Hahn ’OB said.

"It's really nice to come out of
spring break with such a
strong record so we can go
into our conference games
with confidence."
Ben Young 'O9
This allowed the team to enjoy their down
time outdoors, spending time together without
the academic stresses of the usual Swat environment. "We hung out by the pool, and some
guys played some intense whiffle ball in the
parking lot," Hahn said. "We get along pretty
well as a team so it was fun goofing around
with the guys on top of playing lacrosse."
The players also enjoyed the company of

some of their parents, a cookout at a family
friend's house and watching college basketball.
The week brought with it a fairly normal

amount of training time and competition, with
a total of five practices and two games.
The only abnormal scheduling for the week
was the two-a-day practices on Tuesday. The
team underwent some minor adjustments to
play on grass instead of turf, but they didn't let
the conditions affect their level of play. "The
training went well and everyone on the team
had a great work ethic; they all treated our
practice situations seriously, and as if it were
a game situation," Gavin Musynske 'lO.
This focused training helped the Garnet to
notch two more victories. On Wednesday they
faced the Seahawks of St. Mary's College,

defeating them 9-6, and on Saturday afternoon
they wrapped up their trip with a win against
New England College, outscoring the Pilgrims

13-4.

In the game against St. Mary’s, the
Seahawks were the first to strike, and
although the Garnet tied it up soon after with
a goal from Stelios Wilson ’O9, the Seahawks
had netted three more by the beginning of the
second quarter, making it 4-L Swarthmore
answered with a vengeance, tallying five unanswered goals, regaining the lead, and taking
the score to 6-4 by halftime. During the run,
Musynske contributed three goals and an
assist, while Todd Friedman ’O9 scored his second goal of the season and Anthony Phalen ’lO
converted one of his own off the pass from
Musynske.

The second half was more of a defensive
battle. Both teams were held to one goal each
in the third quarter. Phalen finished a pass
from Tyler Bradshaw ’lO for the Garnet, maintaining the lead for Swarthmore, and in the
fourth quarter Musynske put yet another past
the Seahawks’ goalie, his eighth of the season.
With only a minute remaining in the game,
Ivano Ventresca ’OB put the game on ice with
one more goal bringing the final score to 9-6 in
favor of the Garnet.
On Saturday, Swarthmore continued its
perfect season, finishing spring break with
another win against the Pilgrims of New
England College. It was a decisive victory, and

11 players recorded points for Swarthmore in
the match-up. Will Predun ’O9 netted a goal and
notched two assists, while Wilson and Brian
Baum ’ll each tallied a goal and an assist.
Bradshaw, Dave DeSimone ’O9, Friedman,
Hahn and Ventresca each put one past the
Pilgrim goaltender. Phalen recorded his first
ever hat trick and Musynske continued his
scoring streak with two goals of his own.
The win against New England College
brings the Garnet to a flawless 4-0, the best season start for the program since 2000, when the
team began the season 5-0 and eventually competed in the ECAC tournament. “It’s really
nice to come out of spring break with such a
strong record so we can go into our conference
games with confidence,” Ben Young ’O9 said.
The team is also aware, however, that the
upcoming games will be challenging. “We’re
proud of what we’ve done su far,” said Hahn,
“but as a team we understand that we need to
get better with each game and take it up a level
for conference games, because the opponents
in conference are generally much tougher than
most of the teams we’ve played so far.”
The Garnet opens up conference action on
Wednesday in Collegeville, PA, where they will
take on the Ursinus College Bears at 7:00 p.m.

Women's team stumbles, recovers
nicely to open up spring campaign
BY SETH GREEN
sgreen3@swarthmore.edu
After a training trip in San
Antonio, TX, the Women's Lacrosse
team (4-2) is off to a roaring start,
defeating Gwynedd-Mercy College
13-12 on Saturday afternoon and
Moravian College in a 15-4 romp on
Sunday.
Spring break brought the team
to Texas for what Amy Vachal 'll
called "really good weather," three
games and "team bonding."
The Garnet started off with a 152 slaughter of the University of
Dallas, including four goals by
Emily Evans 'll. At one point,
Swarthmore led 15-0.
The Garnet then lost a 19-10
game against Drew University, who
at that point was 4-0 on the season.

Vachal scored her first of four hat
tricks of the season and Susannah
Blair 'OB played the whole game in
goal, racking up 12 saves.
In its next game, the Garnet fell
21-16 to St. Mary's College of
Maryland; the game featured a
tightly contestedfirst half, with the
Garnet at one point leading 7-6
before being overcome.
Vachal accounted for the team's
recent success to the training trip.
The trip was meant for the team "to
get to know each other," and it's
"starting to show on the field; we're
playing pretty well." Vachal feels
like they "really bonded as a team."
She had been "a little nervous, coming in as a freshman," before the
trip, but said the trip was great.
She called it "relaxing" and "not as
ridiculous" as her high school
trips.
Unfortunately, the Garnet has
been downed by what the team,
according to Vachal, calls "the
sniper," a stomach bug that
"catch[es] people out of nowhere."
Though they were down a few players over the weekend, they still
managed to triumph.
Head Coach Karen Borbee called
the trip "a huge success."
"We
came away with one win and two
losses but we learned the most from
the two losses
The competition
we faced in Texas has prepared us
...

IN

to enter a very tough part of our

schedule," she said.
Saturday's
game
against
Gwynedd-Mercy was hotly contested. Following a hat trick by Vachal
and two goals by Marissa Schaffer
'O9 and Anna De Regt 'O9, the
Garnet led 9-4 after the half. The
Griffins responded to tie the game
at 12, before Vachal finished it off
with the final goal.
Schaffer and Vachal both scored
hat tricks the next day against
Moravian, as well as two from Alex
Gilbert-Bono 'lO. Captain Megan
Sanborn 'OB assisted Abbe Muller
'lO for a goal. Evans and Abbie
Fischer 'OB also posted goals; Blair

and Allison Grein 'lO shared the

goaltending load and the win.
Speaking about
the trip,
Schaffer said, "Spring break was a
great opportunity for our team to
get to know each other and bond
away from the distractions from
school. We had an awesome time in
Texas, and our first few games really showed us our strengths as a

team and what we need to work on
throughout the season." She hoped
that the spring break trip would
show on the field. So far, it clearly

has.
On Tuesday evening, the Garnet
at
played
Widener College.
Swarthmore came away with a 13-8

an overwhelming 9-2 lead by halftime. After the break, they managed the game and held on for a
five-goal margin of victory.
Evans and Muller each put up a
hat trick and then some scoring

Hosting such an event is a major endeavor, as 11
schools and 112 players are expected to participate.
However, Swarthmore's badminton team is very excited to he hosting this grand finale to its season. "The
whole team is really, really excited about the tournament this weekend," Kim Kramer 10 said. "I think our
goal is to play the best that we can and to help run a
successful tournament that we cap. be proud of
These are going to be some amazing matches," she
said.
Patricia Kelly 'OB is also very excited about the
opportunity to showcase the event right here at
Swarthmore. "As the least recognized varsity sport, it
is nice to showcase our sport at its best and we hope
that many Swatties will not only attend, but support

us, making posters and just coming and making some
noise," she said.

The badminton team's season has been a success so
far this season, highlighted by back-to-back victories
over Haverford College and Bryn Mawr College on Feb.
19 and Feb. 20, respectively. The latter was particularly sweet, as it avenged a previous loss to Bryn Mawr.
The Garnet hopes to keep riding that success
through Nationals. "We expect that our team should
be very competitive. We will work as hard as we can
to make sure we come away with some of those [individual] medals and even a [team] trophy," said Kelly.
And remember, as Kramer put it, "The Swat badminton loves having an audience."

Track runs a little, chills a lot over break
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO
AND NIYIKA CORBETT

Putting the cold Pennsylvania weather

behind them, the men's and women's outdoor track-and-field teams spent their
spring break in Florida, the Sunshine
State, soaking up some rays and tossing
down a couple of intense games of beach
volleyball.

When asked about the logic behind a
spring break trip, Coach Pete Carroll
said, "It's definitely a combination of
training, education and team bonding.
Spring break is kind of a barometer coming out of indoors. We have to have a
meet, it's got to be warm and it needs to fit
our budget."

"We don't just run fast;
we can pound it in
the sand, too."
Caitlin Russell 'll
weather at
the meet did not reflect the venue's southern location. In fact, conditions in
Tallahassee were quite similar to conditions in Philadelphia.
According to Carroll, "The meet was
very cold, very uncharacteristic of
Florida. We were about eight hours
behind a tornado so the weather patterns
changed. It was forty degrees with twenty
mile-per-hour winds. Our performances
were reflective of the conditions, but the
efforts were the same. We were looking
for hard efforts."
The beginning of break was business
as usual for the Garnet as they competed
at the FAMU Relays, hosted March 7-8 by
Florida Agricultural and Mechanical
University. The early season meet served
as a rust-buster, allowing athletes to get
Ironically, the inclement

used to the feel of racing on a full-sized,
400 meter outdoor track.
The meet opened up on Friday with the
5000 meter run. Nyika Corbett 'lO and
Bess Ritter 'O9 each had strong performances, finishing third and fourth respectively against Division I competition.
Jonathan Shoop 'OB represented the men's
side in the sk, surviving the less than
ideal conditions to finish his first outdoor

race of the season.
Saturday started nice and early, with
Lauren Deluca 'lO racing the 800 meters,
followed on the men's side by the sophomore duo of Andrew Vanßuren and
Jonnie Tompkins. Next up was the

women's 4 x 800 meters squad, consisting
of Faith Pampel 'O9, Rebecca Woo 'll,
Caitlin Russell 'll and Melina Healey 'OB.
The quartet came together for a solid
third place finish. The men's sprint medley relay also had a good showing, with
Vanßuren, Dan Hodson 'O9, Seth Green 'lO
and Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll racing to a
fourth place finish.
Mayer-Bacon and Hodson also competed individually, running the 400 hurdles
and 1500 meters respectively. For Mayer-

Bacon it was a liberating experience of
sorts
he was a solid prep 400 hurdler,
an event not contested on the 200 meter
indoor track. Hodson also turned in a
solid performance, posting a respectable
finish in the 1500 despite being a distance

specialist.

The Garnet was also well represented
in the field events. Heather Hightower 'O9
and Neel Prakash 'O9 proved to be the
workhorses of the day, making their discus throw debut as well as competing in
the shot put. Nathalie De Gaiffier 'lO also
turned in a strong performance, making
her outdoor debut in the long jump.
In addition to the student-athletes,
throws Coach Tom Reynolds also competed, dominating the discus throw and winning by an incredible four feet. He also
had a strong showing in the shot put, placing fourth.
But, as the saying goes, "All work and
no play makes Swat track a dull team."

The squad found plenty of time for fun,
with team activities ranging from surfing
to beach volleyball and the viewing of a
rocket launch. As Healey described, "We
had great team bonding. We played a lot of
intimate games. It got pretty competitive;
I went surfing and kicked Dan [Hodson]'s
butt, but I got my butt kicked in beach

volleyball."
Perhaps the reason for Healey's aching
posterior were the combined efforts of
Shoop and Coach Reynolds. As Shoop
explained, "I think I missed my athletic
calling. Instead of running I should have
been a beach volleyball player alongside
Coach Tom." Van Buren also praised
Coach Reynold's volleyball skills, as well
as his impressive physique, as he said,
"Tom has one hot body. I'm a lucky man
to have seen it in action during beach volleyball." Russell echoed the spirit of
beach volleyball competition among the
team, as she stated, "Our beach volleyball
game showed that our team is multitalented. We don't just run fast; we can
pound it in the sand, too."
What were the trip's highlights?
According to Coach Carroll, the trip had
two. The first was a new team record by
Seth Green 'lO of being lost for three hours
and twelve minutes on trails while listening

to an iPod. Life lesson here: do not listen to
an iPod while running. Green also kept the
team entertained, as he extended his streak
of bad luck to exploding Gatorade.
The second highlight was when the team

attended the Endeavor shuttle launch. Not
only did the launch serve as a metaphor for
the team launch into the outdoor season, but
it was also a great team bonding experience.
As Carroll explained, "It was kind of exciting because it was really anticipatory. It didjust twenty-three secn't last very long
onds but a lot of it was getting up in the
middle of the night and getting to the causeway. It was a type of harmonic convergence,
a type of Americana. It lifted off and everyit was
one was clapping and cheering
patriotic yet humanistic, an international
endeavor with Japan and some other countries."

The Garnet also provided a highlight
for the workers at the hotel. As Coach
Noon described, "The guys had a pushup
competition at the track meet and it carried over into the hotel lobby for Jonnie
it was the
[Jonathan Tompkins 'lo]
highlight of the trip for the concierge."
Connor Darby 'O9 provided an in-depth
closing analysis of the trip, stating, "So
to sum up spring break, it's best to refer
to a team favorite
an inspirational
...

movie called "So Fine." The heart and
will power of Amy the Gorilla in her quest
to save mankind against tigers with
lasers is a testament to the work ethic of

our team and what we want to accomplish
not only as runners, but also throughout
our lives."

"We had great team
bonding. We played a lot of
intimate games. It got
pretty competitive."
Melina Healey 'OB
But not all members of the track teams
competed in Florida, and some expressed
considerable regret at their absence from
the events. Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 spent
spring break abroad and missed her team
for the duration. "I just sat crying in a dorm
room in Ireland, pining for the track team
for nine days," she said.

The men's and women's teams will next
be in action on Saturday, March 29th, when
their first meet in PA kicks of at 10:00 a.m. at
Widener University's Danny Curran
Invitational.

Top football clubs bringing sport down to bottom line
Last week saw the pro-

gression of four English
clubs into the quarterfinal
stage of the Champions
League. That's half of all
the clubs of "Europe"'s premier football competition.
The year before, three
made it to the semis!
It's just... boring seeing

the same clubs over and
over again and unfair for

DHEERAJ RAVI
Red Card

the

rest

of

the

teams.

Granted, there are surprises like Schalke
and

Fenerbahce, but they'll
probably be knocked out by
Barcelona and Chelsea,
respectively (though let's hope not).
The reason is undoubtedly due to the fact that money
grows on trees over there. English clubs spent more than
£5OO million the summer of 2007 on purchasing new talent. The previous summer they spent around £3OO mil-

lion.
That's just ridiculous. Firstly, that inflates the cost of
players, making it seem acceptable to spend many millions on players. Secondly, it makes life much harder for
the clubs that do not spend arid constrains their expectations for the season. How are they supposed to compete
with significantly better teams? It sucks because this
makes it acceptable for these clubs to have low expecta-

THE PHOENIX

tions and that's what they adjust their mentality towards.
Instead of winning their national leagues and international competitions, their goal becomes not to get relegated to a lower division.
The recent takeovers of many clubs in England (first
Chelsea, then others like Liverpool, Aston Villa,
Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, and
West Ham) by rich businessmen who know close to nothing about the beautiful game offootball has obviously not
helped.
If they had 100 percent control, they would run the
club like a business, players would be commodities to be
bought and sold (it's getting there), and the bottom-line is
to ensure long-term profit, accepting a huge short-term

loss.
So what if they financed their takeover by borrowing
a shitload of money
I mean, what could go wrong with
that? It's an easy solution
all you have to do is raise
ticket prices! This ensures that only people who can
afford it can attend games and the real supporters can
watch it on tele (they rightly burnt effigies of the Glazers
after the huge hike last summer). And how do you
appease these fans? By buying up Europe's best! Like
clockwork.
More than half of £5OO million spent last summer was
devoted to foreign players. I mean if your sole claim to
fame is your spending power, what does that say? Can
you even be called a 'team'?
...

Looking at the starting lineups of the big four in
England, there aren't more than two or three players that
are actually English (except Man Utd. at times). Here I

March 20, 2008

blame the players slightly. It would mean so much more
playing and competing for your native club. I'm sure the
allure of higher salaries is a powerful motivator as is the
increased likelihood of silverware, but it almost seems
empty and pointless.
You're not going to find many more Maldinis, Rauls, or
Del Pieros anymore and that's sad because these players
were exceptional role models who were true to their clubs
and actually knew what it really means to play for a team.
The English national "team" is made up of the highest
earning group of players and they have never been a
potent threat in major competitions. Maybe there's no
relationship, but I truly believe that a materialistic focus
lessens the values of what truly matters, such as playing
for your country.
I guess it's unfair for me to pick on England as clubs
like Milan, Inter, Barcelona and Real Madrid also indulge
in wasteful spending. Real Madrid spent the most out of
any club in Europe last summer, £BO million (I don't know

what Calderon was doing spending big on Pepe and
Robben). In fact, Barcelona and Real Madrid are the top
two spenders consistently in La Liga and they always
grab either first or second.
In England, the top four is also constant and hardly
ever changes by the end of the season. Some might say
that this leads to a monopoly and should even be illegal.
We should impose some sort of limit to ensure a fairer
balance as well as focus more on homegrown players, as
that is what a football team's success should be based on.

Baseball has successful spring break tour
BY MELINDA PETRE
mpetrel@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore
baseball team (6-4)
nicely
rebounded
from its hard-fought
opening day loss,
sweeping
State
University of New

York

Institute

of

Technology (0-2) 1716 and 8-3 during its
first doubleheader
Sunday, March 9 in
Tampa.
In the first game,

Swarthmore trailed
as it headed into the
bottom of the seventh inning, but ral-

lied to score 6 runs,
earning its first win
of
the
season.
Garnet pitchers Justin Hughes 'lO and Neil Mejia 'll
earned their first collegiate wins in the first and second
games respectively.
"I'm very proud that we are competing day in and day
out against everyone we play. In the past, we've had
some good days (and plenty of bad ones) but this year we
go into every game the same way: play hard in order to
win," team co-captain Scott Dalane 'OB said.

The trip continued with a double-header Tuesday,
March 11 against Cazenovia College (3-2). Swarthmore

won the first game 11-8, after trailing 8-5 at the top of the
seventh inning. Pitcher Zach Sinemus 'lO picked up the
win, and Dalane his first save. Swarthmore lost the second game 12-7 after Cazenovia took an early lead.
Swarthmore swept Daniel Webster College (1-7) 16-0
and 6-5 on Thursday, March 13. Pitcher Andy Allen 'll
picked up his first career win, Issac Han 'll made his
first collegiate appearance and first baseman Matt Corso
'lO hit his first collegiate home run. In the second game,
Ben Scheiderman 'll got his first start and Mejia picked
up his second win.
"Its great to play alongside [the freshmen], and based
on the work they have put forth this year, our team feels
collectively as confident with them in the spotlight in
cruchtime as they would with a veteran player," first
baseman and team co-captain Travis Allen 'OB said.
On their final day of competition in Florida,
Swarthmore lost 14-4 to Centenary College (1-2) on
Friday, March 14, lead by Mejia's pitching on a dismal
and rainy afternoon.
Back at Swat, the Garnet shut out City College of New
York 7-0 on Sunday afternoon. Pitchers Jimmy Gill 'lO
and Sinemus shared the shutout against CCNY, which
led Division 111 in hitting last year.
"The moments that stand out are a progression of
more and more impressive performances on the field.
We are of a mind to each day take a step forward, as individuals developing skills and as members of a team
working within a well-defined system, and so far we have
continued to advance," Allen said.
Dalane shares his teammate's enthusiasm. "The
games were great, especially since we played a high level
of baseball," he said. "But the moments that stood out
most to me were random times just hanging out with the

head coach Stan Exeter.

I'm very proud that we are

“This was a very successful trip and the best thing
that came out of it was how the team used the time to

bond and get to know each other as people and players,”
Exeter said.
“The wins we have compiled so far have resulted from
significant contributions from everyone on the team. It’s
been a great team effort so far, and we look to maintain
that mentality heading into conference play,” Allen said.
“What we expect of ourselves is to get better each day,
enjoy our time on the field, play our hearts out and execute the system at the highest level we possibly can,”
Dalane said. “Three come-from-behind wins are a good
indication that we have learned never to stop fighting.”
“Our expectations? Play our best each day,” Exeter
said.
Swarthmore suffered a tough loss on Tuesday to PSUBerks 7-5. They play away at Philadelphia Biblical
Thursday at 3.
