College responds to terrorist
attacks on New York, Pentagon
Support services try
to help students cope
BY MATTHEW FITTING

She lit a candle with a match

mid-morning, and set it down
next to the windows, where sunlight spilled into the room. Then

Pauline Allen waited. She looked
around, making sure there were
enough chairs for what she knew
was coming.
Soon the campus' Protestant
religious adviser was joined by
many students. She had dealt
with some of them extensively in
the past; some she'd never seen
before. Many of her visitors just

sat, staring. Others clasped their
hands and squeezed their eyes
shut. A few prayers were said
aloud; there was mostly silence.
"In some ways it's not a time

for theological musings," Allen
said. "It's a time to be there for
one another, and we'll have to
sort out in our own hearts what
this means to each of us."
In response to the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center
and in Washington, D.C. two days
ago, college support services

Allen and the other religious
advisers among them
tried to
help students come to terms with
the day's events in various ways.
While the college officially closed
at noon on Tuesday, counseling
was available in the admissions
office, and psychological services
and the deans also remained open
for anyone who needed help coping. "We know there were students who had family in New

Dr. David Ramirez, director
of psychological services,
said answering yes to any
of these questions may
suggest that a person
should seek additional
counseling support:

who were hurt or remain
unaccounted for?
Is this event bringing up
recollections of previous
loss, trauma or crisis that
you or a loved one have
faced?

anxiety, fear for your
safety or rage?
Are you crying more
than usual in response to

York, and other students concerned for them," said Dean of the
College Bob Gross, adding that all
the deans have an implicit agreement to stay open to counsel students during emergencies like
Tuesday's. Gross saw several students throughout the day, each
"trying to deal with the shock,
the enormity of it all, trying to
make sense of it."
Allen tried to help students
however she could: by talking
with some, praying with others.
For those who came from the
affected areas, she tried contacting relatives who might have

been impacted by the tragedy,

often unsuccessfully due to limited phone service. "We are here to
support students and faculty and

staff," she said. "In their sorrow,
in their anger, in whatever this
brings up with them."

Rachel Kobrin, the adviser for

Jewish life, also saw several peo-

ple who felt overwhelmed by the
tragedy. "Most students I've spoken to have just wanted a space to
talk in, to be heard," she said.
"Most people have just really
wanted to speak with a person
they know will be there to listen."
"It is my impression that most
people use one another for support," said Dr. David Ramirez,
director of psychological services.
Still, Ramirez was also available

to help students get through the
day's events. "The witnessing of
this is something that everyone is
going through together, but people can have wide variations in
the way they react," he said. "For
people that have their own traumas in their past, events like this
can be reminders of previous
traumas. That's not necessarily a
bad thing, it's just something to
expect and a way of dealing with
that is being open to one's emotional experience and finding a
place to express that."
Gross added that he, for one,
could only lend a sympathetic ear.
"I don't have any more answers
than anybody else does," he said.
On Wednesday, Ramirez said
that after a day of digestion, psychological services was starting
to see more students in need of
support. "The shock begins to
wear off, and more feelings may
emerge,

such as sadness and

anger," he said. "This delayed
reaction is typical, as it often
takes time to go from being
shocked to having the emotional

distress register."

College shuts down, classes canceled
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon Tuesday morning, college
administrators declared the college closed shortly
before noon that day, sending all non-essential staff
home. As administrators and faculty canceled classes, the academic buildings grew dark and empty.
McCabe, ever a symbol of the college's constancy,
remained open. But it was, for once, not a study center, as students and staff gathered around the television awaiting the latest news and searching for
explanations.
Sharpies, public safety and other operations
deemed essential to the function of the college also
remained open, but employees concerned about

endangered family members were allowed to leave.

President Al Bloom, who was in Manhattan on

Tuesday, called a senior staff meeting at 11 a.m. that
day, addressing deans and top administrators via
speaker-phone. After agreeing to close the college,
the administrators turned their concern to providing support to the community, said Dean of the
College Bob Gross. They arranged for counseling
services and Tuesday night's Collection in the
Friends Meetinghouse.
Classes resumed and staff trudged back to work
Wednesday, but for Gross, the reopening of the college did not mean a return to normalcy. "We would
expect that [faculty] may want to depart from the
syllabus and spend some time talking about things,"
he said.

Campaign finance
forum 'up in the air'
Following the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon
Tuesday morning, Vice President of College and Community Relations
Maurice Eldridge has placed on hold the conference for campaign
finance reform, originally scheduled for Sept. 24.
"The event is up in the air," Eldridge said.
The conference was slated to feature speakers John McCain (RAriz.) and Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who sponsored the campaign
finance bill in the Senate, as well as Christopher Shays (D-Conn.) and
Martin Meehan (D-Mass.), the House sponsors for the bill.
But McCain is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Forces
Committee, and the remaining three congressmen are likely to find
themselves caught up in an emergency flurry of planning and debate
in he wake of the destruction in New York City and Washington,. D.C.
Prior to Tuesday's disasters, Eldridge said he hoped the conference
would "give the bill refreshed visibility in the eyes of our community
and, hopefully, the nation."
Campaign for America, a nonprofit group founded by Board of
Managers member emeritus Jerry Kohlberg '46, was planning to sponsor the conference. Its mission involves "working to pass meaningful
campaign reform legislation" in a nonpartisan setting, the group's

Web site said.
Construction of the temporary structure intended for the campaign launch may be postponed

College puts indefinite hold
on capital campaign launch
BY BRENDAN KARCH
The college decided yesterday to postpone indefinitely the national launch of its capital fundraising
campaign.

"Because of the gravity of our national crisis and
out of respect for those who have suffered personal
loss, the college has decided to postpone the campaign launch event scheduled for Sept. 22,"
President Al Bloom said in a written statement.
According to college officials, the decision was
made after a series of meetings stretching through
yesterday morning and afternoon.
At least one meeting involved members of the
Campaign Leadership Council, a committee of the
Board of Managers.
Vice President for Alumni Relations and Public
Development Dan West, who was part of the decision-making process, said yesterday, "It just seemed
that this campus event at this time is not the right

thing to do." He expressed concern over tragic news
about alumni and family members of those at the
college that might surface in the days to come.
Director of Development John Malcolm, also
present at yesterday's meetings, said most other
scheduled campaign events would go on, including
regional launches across the country. He stressed
that the on-campus launch has been "postponed, but
not cancelled."
According to Malcolm, about 250 guests had
already registered to come for the launch activities
and dinner scheduled for next Saturday. He said no
decision was reached at the meetings about the
future of the partially-built temporary structure on

Parrish Beach.
"I think it was the gravity of the situation, the
seriousness of the crisis" that prompted the decision, West said. "We need to do things symbolically
as a college that express our sorrow and our sympathy with people who have suffered."

International students express
fear, concern about attacks
BY JARED LENOW

Swarthmore international students were
shocked and surprised by the terrorist attacks
Tuesday morning on the Pentagon and World
Trade Center and the apparent ease with which
terrorists bypassed what is viewed as one of the
world's best domestic defense and intelligence
networks.
Students raised concerns about the global implications of the apparently coordinated terrorist
attacks.
"How could this happen in the U.S.?" said Joseph
Altuzarra 'O5, a native of Paris. "Bombing the U.S. is
like bombing the mother ship.
"I thought it was a joke," he said. "I thought it
was impossible."
Raghu Karnad 'O5, who has lived in India all his
life, believes the attack will cause Americans to be
more sympathetic and lend more resources to international anti-terrorist efforts.
"I won't say the U.S. has been unsympathetic
so far," he said. "But I do think the U.S. will be
more sympathetic to countries like India, who
experience acts of terrorism on a regular basis. I
think how the Indians feel about this is similar to
how Britain felt when the Japanese bombed Pearl

Harbor."
Christine Shin 'O4, who has lived in South Korea
for the majority of her life, had a similar reaction.
"America is always the one helping fight wars in
other countries to make them secure," she said.
"You don't think of it happening here."
Many said they didn't feel as personally affected
by the tragedy as many of their classmates.
"I think I take it less seriously than someone
from the States," said Gyanu Sharma 'O4, who is
from Nepal.
Although some did not feel as personally affected
as their peers, most students said the apparent helplessness of the world's number one military power
to prevent such a massive and effective coordinated
act sets a frightening and far-reaching precedent in
the global fight against terrorism.
"If they can hit the U.S., and to this extent, that is
very scary to the international community," said
Andy Scarborough 'O4, who is from Bolivia. "If they
can hit the Pentagon, where can't they hit?"
Other students shared Scarborough's concerns.
"An attack on America is viewed as an attack on

the world," said Altuzarra.
"Everyone knows the Pentagon and the Trade
Center towers. They're world symbols. If this can
happen to America, it can happen anywhere."

Bloom witnesses
New York attacks
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
As two hijacked planes
crashed into the Twin Towers
Tuesday morning, setting them
ablaze and eventually leveling
them, President Al Bloom
watched from a 12th-floor apartment in lower Manhattan with a
direct view of the towers.
"At about five of nine, there
was just this huge hole with
flames shooting out from the

side" of the first tower hit, he
said.

The president had traveled to
New York City with his wife,
Peggi Bloom, as well as Treasurer
Sue Welsh and Vice President for

and
College
Community
Relations Maurice Eldridge. They

were planning to meet with board
member Jerry Kohlberg '46.
Bloom described a chilling
image of a shining, fiery building
against a crystalline blue sky. "I
had rarely seen a day that beautiful," he said. "And juxtaposed
against this was this huge fireball, with flames shooting out of
the gaping hole in the tower." The
buildings even seemed to sparkle
because of their myriad glass
panels, Bloom said.
After the first plane crashed
into a tower, Bloom said, he was
in another room. It was Peggi

Bloom who screamed when the
second plane flew in.
"I heard my wife saying, 'My
God, my God, there's another
plane coming, there's another
plane coming and it just hit!'
Bloom said. "Then there was
this huge gash in the second
tower."
Following the two crashes,
Bloom went onto the subway to
go to a meeting.
The city, however, became
"stunned within 15 minutes."
"New York was

"I was very sad to not have

been able to be at the collection
last night because of how much I
treasure being part of this community when I'm looking for the
kind of personal connections
which I know were so intensely
expressed," he said.

As he was leaving the city via
the West Side Highway, Bloom
saw 20 to 30 blocks of solid ambulances, which had come in from
Long Island, Westchester and
New Jersey to help.

Bloom expressed esteem for
students and staff and confidence that the community would
do what it could to improve the
world in the wake of the disas-

ter.
"I feel deeply proud to be a
member of a community that
feels so profoundly the human

loss and the societal and world
implications of this crisis,"

Bloom said.

"I know that, as an educational community, we will do all we
can to better understand how to
create a world in which such

Faculty responds to Tuesday tragedies
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
In response to the national
tragedies Tuesday, Swarthmore
faculty expressed shock and horror, but also provided commentary on the identity of the attackers, the roots of terrorism and the
predicted national and international response.
"I think we've all recognized
that terrorist attacks were going
to be part of our future, but it's
still staggering, the scope and the
orchestration of this set of
events," said Carol Nackenoff,
chair of the political science
department.
Nackenoff thought the attacks
were likely to alter the American
perception of invulnerability.
"It will tend to change the

debate about defense and defense

priorities," Nackenoff said.

"We've been a very fortunate
nation in the sense that the Civil
War and Revolutionary War have
been the only wars fought on
American soil," she continued.
"We have a sense of security that
very few other peoples in the
world have. Though the former
World
Trade
and
Center
Oklahoma City bombings shattered that, this will really drive
home that we are none of us
secure."
Political science professor
Robert Boatright speculated that
the events might cause President
Bush to reconsider his budget,
since there have already been
calls for him to revise it.
"This is pretty concrete evidence we're not doing enough to
prevent terrorism. Maybe he will
take that into account," Boatright
said.

He also pointed out, however,
that assumptions that Islamic terrorists coordinated the attacks
might be premature. "It's important to remember that after the
Oklahoma City bombing, people
jumped to conclusions that were

not just wrong but drop-dead

racist."

Hopkins, professor of
originally
science,
political
thought that the attacks were
beyond the capabilities of "substate-sponsored terrorism," but
reversed his opinion after hearing rumors that flight simulators
Ray

are available online.
"The big issue is: is a state
involved, even semi-officially?"
Hopkins said. He noted that
North Korea once carried out a
large-scale assassination of the
South Korean government and
that Iraq might be a possible
suspect.
"If it's true that the fourth
plane was headed for Camp
David, then I would definitely say
the attacks were coordinated by
people who feel the United States
has played a malign role in the

Middle East."
Hopkins is not surprised that
no one has taken responsibility
for the attacks. "This is classic
terrorism
making people go
nuts trying to figure out who did

it," he said.

He speculated the attacks
may have been carried out to

"release personal and widely
shared feelings of hatred toward
the United States, and also to
cause us to draw back from the
world."
"The motivation for the
attacks could be some kind of

publicity campaign to change
how people see the world in order
to advantage them," Hopkins
said.

"We obviously live in a world
in which there are some people
committed to causes who don't
think there's anything to talk
about," Nackenoff added.
For this reason, Hopkins
emphasized that the best way to
combat terrorism is to focus on
its socioeconomic roots. "People
are totally desperate, but normally we've been protected from

that."

Hopkins believes that, in
nations without an established
political authority or functioning
infrastructure, people who ought
to be dealt with by the judicial or
mental health system may end up
terrorists.
"What we have to do is change
what we do in the world to get
people in proper institutional
environments. In our country,
these people end up in mental
institutions.
"The classical notion of
defense is to deter terrorism by
pre-empting attacks. Over and
above this, as an issue of sustainability we must address the
cancer of terrorism," he said,
referring to the proliferation of
groups worldwide who feel that
tactics of terrorism are the only
way to achieve their goals.
"The military is like a heart
surgeon. If you've got cancer, it's
not really helping to operate on
your heart," he said.
Nackenoff agreed that traditional military
or security
responses might not be adequate.
"The scale and scope of this is
staggering, and I think it's very
difficult how to begin to protect
ourselves from this kind of
assault. It leaves conventional

thinking behind.
"I think a retaliation by the
United States will only escalate
the violence, and yet I suspect
that's what we're likely to see."
Hopkins advocates "deeper,
more informed engagement in

internationalaffairs."
"We're not as engaged constructively as we were from the

'3os through the '6os," he pointed
out.
"We ought to rethink more
protectorates like Kosovo" in
nations that do not have a stable
political authority.

However, he and Nackenoff
both admitted that deterring terrorist attacks is difficult.

Political science professor Carol Nackenoff said of Tuesday's attacks
that there are "some people committed to causes who don't think
there's anything to talk about."
She spent Tuesday in her

began to comprehend their magnitude.
"I'm from New York City, I have friends
who work at the World Trade Center. This
is just so ridiculous!" Imo Akpan 'O2 said.
Aponte added, "After [the attacks] my
day consisted of utter shock, with much
sobbing, much fear for family and friends
in New York City, just total terror of what
else might happen."
"After my psychology class I decided to
write to my family and let them know that I
was OK," said Tsiri Abenyega 'O3, who is
from Ghana. "After sending the e-mail, I
began to think about the thousands of frantic, frightened families in New.York and
DC. that will try to call all theirrelatives to
find out if they are still alive. Some will find
out that all their relatives are alive, others
will find their relatives in hospitals, others
will find their relatives dead, others will not
find answers till the next day or perhaps
after a number of days. My heart grieves for
all those who suffered in this tragic event."
While some struggled with the shock of
the tragedy, others expressed opinions on
what could possibly have led to such an

attack. Not all students saw the events as
wholly unexpected.
"What happened today is, of course, horrific. But while emotionally jarring, what
happened could not rationally have been
unexpected. Only the scale and precision of

these attacks is truly unsettling," said Greg
Jablonski 'O2.
"It seems that the United States has
underestimated the abilities of those on
whom it so dutifully tried to project its own
will," Jablonski said, "and I hope that ulti-

mately the lesson learned is that the best
interests of the United States lie not in trying to mold the world into its own image,
but rather in letting the world evolve as it
may and then working to fit itself into

whatever the world does become."
However, other students were too overcome with their emotions to begin grappling
withthe political and economic policies that
some say may have led to this event.
"The political implications of this have
barely seeped into my mind." said Aponte.
"Frankly, right now I don't care. Right
now, for me, it's not about the U.S. government screwing up, it's not time for finger
pointing.
It is time for mourning the
tremendous loss of human life."
Several students said that they feared
the hate that caused this terror and the
hate that may perpetuate a violent reaction. "As the dust settled over Manhattan
and the shock of the early morning events
settled, I realized more and more how
much I hate the word retaliation," Erin
Dwyer-Frazier 'O5 said. "My gut reaction is
to want revenge, but we have to think
beyond our instincts. We call this an attack
on civilization, yet can we truly call our-

selves civilized if we react in the same
exact way?"
"I think the real terror is not in buildings collapsing or even in people dying,"

added Jenn Barefoot 'O5, "but in the hearts
of every one of us
the hatred and delusion that could cause someone to do this,
the lust for vengeance it will produce."
Pari Deshpande 'O4 feels a similar fear
of what occurred and what is to come. "I
think we all feel a new fear, a new monster
under the bed." she said. "And unfortunately, this time we aren't dreaming."

Swarthmore, Amherst
tie for first in rankings
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
After alternating positions for the past several years,
Swarthmore and Amherst have tied for number one in the
annual U.S. News & World Report college rankings.
In both 1998 and 2000, Amherst received the first-place
ranking, while Swarthmore received the top honors as the
best "national liberal arts college" in 1997 and 1999. Now,
in 2001, Swarthmore and Amherst both hold the highest
ranking among liberal arts colleges granting bachelor's

degrees.

Dean of the College Bob Gross said that while the rankings were useful in distinguishing between liberal arts
colleges and universities, "we don't live our lives by
them." Gross, like many critics of the rankings, thinks
that the magazine should study the undergraduate experience rather than factors such as the salaries of faculty
members. He called the rankings as "annoying and somewhat bogus."
Factors such as academic reputation, retention rates,
faculty resources, graduation rates and gifts from alumni
are factored into an equation thatdetermines each college's
score. U.S. News uses this score to rank the colleges, adjusting the highest score to 100 and all the rest accordingly.
This year, U.S. News & World Report changed its
method in assigning its annual rankings. For example,
most educational institutions once designated as "national universities" are now designated "national universities
doctoral." A group once categorized as "national liberal
arts colleges" is now termed "national liberal arts
bachelor's." After this round of reclassification, 200 colleges
changed categories and are no longer ranked with their
former counterparts. Also, 50 new institutions joined the
pool this year. These changes have prompted many to criticize the worth of such rankings.
Allison Rung, a freshman at Amherst College, said that
the rankings had no effect on her decision to attend
Amherst, "I came to Amherst not only because it is a good
academic match, but because I felt comfortable on campus.
The people here seemed happy," she said. Noting one advantage of the rankings, Rung said, "The most significance that
I can award to being the highest-ranked liberal arts school
is the convenience of coming from a well-respected school
when applying for jobs or graduate studies."
Kate Conover 'O2 also sees the rankings as insignificant. "People put too much credit in them," she said.
Other organizations put out rankings of colleges and

universities as well. The Princeton Review, a company
that publishes study aids, recently printed a new edition
of "331 Best Colleges," which includes rankings that pertain to other qualities of the undergraduate experience.
At each school, editors survey an average of 200 students, picked at random, who answer 70 questions concerning academics, quality of life, diversity and politics.
The top 20 schools in each category are listed. In this new
edition, Swarthmore ranks sixth as having "the best overall experience for undergraduates," eighth under "their
students never stop studying" and seventh as "most politically active."

College sees jump in transfers
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Transfer students are not the rare species they
usually are at Swarthmore this year. Twenty transfers
arrived in August. In recent years, the number has usually remained below five.
For the 12 women and eight men joining the classes of
2004 and 2003, being a transfer student means an existence in a precarious position.
"As hard as it is to be a freshman, it is as hard or
harder to be a transfer. You're caught in an in-between
place," Ann Owens 'O4 said. She spent one semester at
the University ofIllinois at Champaign-Urbana last year,
then took the spring semester off.
Transfers relive some of the anxieties of the freshman

experience
getting used to a different place, connecting with new people
while struggling to meld in with
already established upperclassmen.
"Beginning and getting settled is always the hardest
part-of college," said Jessie Dryden 'O4, a transfer student
from Boston University. "To do it twice is even rougher."
Transfers must learn to navigate an often confusing
mix ofrules. Unlike upperclassmen, they must start off on
the 20-meal plan, but, unlike first-years, they may not take
their first semester pass/fail. While no freshmen must live
in the basement of Mary Lyon, some transfers do.
There is also the difficulty of determining which credits from previous schools Swarthmore will accept.
Transfer students are not admitted to a particular class
year. Rather, the deans determine their class standing
after they enroll.
For many of these students, it is comforting to know
that there are 19 other transfers in a similar situation. "I

Dryden said, "We all hang out together. My roommate is
a transfer. I can't imagine how it would be if there were
only two of us."

The view from the admissions office
Twenty transfer students were not part of the plan for
this year. Dean of Admissions Jim Bock aimed to admit
about 15 transfer students, anticipating that a number of
current Swarthmore students might wish to leave
because they were unhappy with the decision the college
made last December to cut football, wrestling and badminton. He said it was a concern that a number of students who played football might leave the college.
The board of managers sets an enrollment target for
the school which Bock and the admissions staff must try
to meet. Yet it is guessing game for the admissions staff
to know how many spaces in the non-freshman classes
are open, as the college does not track the number of students who transfer away to other colleges.
According to Assistant Registrar Dianne Collings, 36
students who left Swarthmore last year are not expected
to return. Some have transferred, but some may have left
for other reasons. According to the dean's office, only
nine players from the former football team have left the
college since last winter.
Unlike first-year applicants, transfers do not have the
option of applying early and they are not notified of
admissions decision until June. Thus, most transfer students were aware of the discord that surrounded the
elimination of the football team when they applied in the
early spring.

Transfers have found that some students consider

New passenger limits on college vans may inconvenience campus groups

College-owned vans that once carried 15

adherence to a new safety regulation. The

new passenger limit, created in response
to a national report deeming the vans likely to overturn when carrying too much
weight, has left many student groups wondering how they will cope with reserving
and paying for
an extra van whenever they need to leave campus.
"As it stands, the restrictions have the
potential to cause serious problems for
groups, mainly club sports, that use vans
frequently," said Peter Austin 'O2, Student
Council van coordinator.
"It makes it more difficult to get to and

Activist groups will also feel the effects
of the limit. Jessica Sheldon 'O4, who is

group had "often taken full vans of students to places that are difficult to reach by

public transportation."
Two Student Council vans are available
on weekends, with three on hand during
the week. The majority of students who use
the van rental system are Student

club sports, academic departments and
occasional individuals.

The safety study, which the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration

released, said the 15-passenger vans commonly used here as shuttles are "unusually
susceptible" to rolling over in the event of
a crash, especially when loaded.
The college decided that limiting passengers to 10 would make the weight inside
easier to distribute safely, said Auxiliary
Servies Assistant Karen Mazza.

explained that such rollovers occur due to
excess weight on the side or back of the
van, which causes the back wheels to spin
more quickly and can result in fishtailing.
"We're asking that drivers monitor,
that equipment is not replaced in that

space," Mazza said.
The back seat has been removed from
every large van, except those used for
nighttimes shuttles, reducing the capacity
to 11, McKenna said. For safety reasons,
however, the college no more than 10 people inside, with one seat in the van empty.
"We're depending on the students to

reading, "This van holds only 10 people,"

Although public safety and McKenna prefer to monitor van use, he does not believe
it is possible to oversee the loading of
every vehicle.

Students caught ignoring the 10-passenger limit will have their van licenses
removed, McKenna said.

Psychology research delves
into personal decision-making
BY REIKO TESHIBA
Imagine walking around in a shop
where there are 500 flavors of ice cream. In
addition to the all-time favorites, there are
flavors that boggle the mind. Balsamic
vinegar. Basmati rice. How do you decide
which flavor you want?
According

to

psychology professor
Barry Schwartz, different people take different approaches in making decisions.
In his research, for which he collaborated with colleague Andrew Ward and three
other professors, Schwartz tested the relationship between psychology and economics using surveys and simulations.
According to Schwartz, the 15-minute,
17-question survey covered a wide range of
questions to which respondents answered
on a seven-point scale.
The simulations were hypothetical situations in which people had to make choic-

es.

Schwartz's research is based one-third
on university students and two-thirds on
adults. Schwartz uses two broad categories
of decision-makers, "maximizers" and "satisficers," coined by economist Herbert
Simon nearly 50 years ago.
The so-called "maximizers" aim to make
the best choice possible. For example, had a
maximizer been thrown in the aforementioned ice cream shop, he would be lost in
indecision.
Even after much pondering and choosing a flavor, he or she would most likely
reflect that he or she could have made a better choice.
Maximizers worry about
regretting their choices afterward.
Research also reveals that these maximizers are also more prone to social comparisons.

And there are the "satisficers," those
satisfied with "good enough." For them,

adding more options doesn't make a differ-

ence. They don't worry about having the
best of everything.
"The average person in this culture is
happy," Schwartz said, "but the maximizers tend to be pretty miserable."
In a world where we are bombarded
with decisions, big and small, it's important to know how to deal with them in a

sane way.
"We're onto something potentially
important," Schwartz said. "We're finding
that being miserable can be corrected."
It's an unlikely marriage between psychology and economics, raising eyebrows
from both sides.
the study of the mind and
Psychology
behavior
is helping to explain how
human beings make rational decisions.
How people weigh potential gains and
losses has traditionally been the domain of
economics.
As many economists hate to admit,
"rationality" isn't as simple a concept as
they would like to think.

Economics major Wayne Cabradilla 'O2
worked in Schwartz's laboratory this summer. He became interested in the process
of decision-making from a psychological
perspective after taking Schwartz's class
on the subject.
"People in different social science disciplines make fun of each other," Cabradilla
said. "But I think making decisions is an
interesting topic that requires several different angles."
Schwartz himself says that he was "completely overwhelmed" when his collaborator at the University of British Columbia
took him to the 500-flavor ice cream shop in
Vancouver.

"I ended up getting chocolate," he said,
laughing. When asked if he was a maximizer or not, he replied, "I'm set with 'good
enough.' I don't worry about having the

best."

universities face this fall.
The situation at Dartmouth College, where a
record 52.3 percent of admitted students chose to
enroll, gained prominence this summer when the

college announced that it would offer free board for
a year to any incoming freshman who would defer.
According to The Brown Daily Herald, housing was
already tight, and a few students took the college up
on the deal, which was worth about $5,000.
Northeastern University in Boston accepted 3,400
freshmen instead of the usual 2,800, according to

dents who enrolled, the college used housing in two
other colleges in addition to two floors of a local
YMCA. The Eagle also reported that George
Washington University in Washington, D.C. housed
60 freshmen in the State Plaza Hotel and that some
single-occupancy dorms were converted to doubles.

Though enrollment numbers caught most colleges by surprise this year, statistics indicate that
an increasing number of students are eager and able
to attend college. The National Center for Education
estimates that 151 million students are attending
undergraduate or graduate schools this year. The
center projects that, by 2010, that number will
increase to 17.5 million. As a result, overcrowded
campus housing is likely to become a recurrent

issue across the country.

The decision to remove a seat from every large

implemented because of budgetary constraints. "We

said.

Dorm computers,
laptops available
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Students will find several new additions to public computing on
semester. Over the summer, staff from Information
Technology Services and McCabe library installed computer clusters
in dorms around campus as well as wireless laptops and a laptopcheckout system for McCabe.
Five laptops will be available to students for use within McCabe
library this semester. The laptops, two Dell Latitudes and three Apple
iMacs, all contain a wireless card that transmits to one of five wireless
hubs set up throughout McCabe. The wireless connection enables network connection without the hassle of an ethernet card and bulky
campus this

cables.

According to Donny Smith, the electronic reserves coordinator, the
wireless hubs will transmit to a laptop located anywhere in McCabe,
"with the possible exception of the stairwells and the Friends Library
and Peace Collection." Two of the hubs are located on the fourth floor,
two on the second and one in the basement. Thus, a student can now
perform research on the Internet from almost any desk in the library,
a luxury that has not been available in past years.
Once a student has completed and signed a short application form,
he or she can check out a laptop from the circulations desk, with a
valid Swarthmore ID card, for a period of four hours. Students can also
reserve laptops up to one day in advance by signing one out at tripod.brynmawr.edu/search/r?SEAßCH=laptop.
For every hour, or part of an hour, that the laptop is overdue, the
student accrues 50 penalty points. When he or she has accumulated
1,000 points, McCabe staff sends a warning letter. If the student accumulates another 1,000 points, his or her laptop privileges are revoked
for the remainder of the semester.
Additionally, if a laptop or peripheral is damaged beyond normal
wear and tear, lost, stolen or not returned in a timely manner, the student who checked it out must pay its replacement cost, which, in the
case of a new laptop, could be well over $2,500.
Students wishing to use their own laptops in McCabe can also connect to the wireless system if they have a wireless card on their computer. These cards, which cost about $llO and can are available in the
college bookstore, enable any laptop to transmit with the wireless
hubs in McCabe. In addition, students who wish to use their own laptops will still have access to the approximately 60 ethernet connection
portals located throughout the library.
Smith said this year would be a test run for the wireless laptop system. "If all goes well, I'm assuming the college will buy more," Smith
said.
Another technology improvement made this summer comes in the
form of computer clusters installed in public areas of several dorms.
Willets, Dana, Hallowell, Wharton and Worth all have contain clusters
in their shared student space this semester, and a new computer cluster
is scheduled to go up in Mertz soon. In addition, new computer clusters
were installed in the public areas in Kohlberg and Parrish.
"The number of computers varies by dorm," said Robin Jacobsen,
manager of user services. "Some clusters are smaller and some are
bigger, and that's based on the number of students in that dorm."
Willets, one of the largest dorms on campus, currently has two PCs and
one iMac in its first floor lounge, while the smaller student population
living in Dana only has one PC at its disposal.
Jacobsen said that the new dorm cluster computers will be put on
the college's annual computer replacement cycle. This cycle, which
also includes the computers in the Beardsley and McCabe public access
areas, ensures that all computers are upgraded every two to two and a
half years.
Dorm computing centers are not a new phenomenon on campus.
Three years ago, the first cluster was set up in Mary Lyon, and last
year dorm computer clusters were made available for students living
in Woolman and PPR. These clusters were updated with new computers and printers this fall.
This year is the first time, however, that all students will have
access to public computers at all times, a resource that Jacobsen said
students have been continually demanding. "The nice thing is that students no longer have to walk around late at night to get to a computer," Jacobsen said. "Now a student will be able to walk down the hall
in their slippers and have access to a computer."
Liana Lum 'O4, who has already taken advantage of the computer
cluster in Willets a half dozen times this semester, said, "For someone
who doesn't own her own computer, it's a really nice convenience to
have computers available so nearby. All I have to do is take the elevator downstairs any time day or night and I have access to a computer
and printer."
In addition, this summer, as part of the annual computer replacement cycle, 101 computers were replaced in various areas around campus, including the public computing area in Beardsley, where 32 iMacs
and 2 PCs were replaced with 17 PCs and iMacs each. Jacobsen
explained the shift by saying that "students were asking to have a
more mixed environment in Beardsley."

SCCS lounge
opening delayed
BY CATHY DANH
After achieving a solid victory
in the runoff round of the Tarble
gameroom referendum last fall,
College
the
Swarthmore
Computing Society (SCCS) plans
to open its doors "within the next
four weeks," SCCS staff member
Tom Stepleton 'O2 said. This new
computing center will be located
on the lower level of Clothier,
beneath Paces.
"We would have been open
since the beginning of the school
year" Stepleton said, "but we did
not have access to our Student
Budget Committee funds over the
summer." SCCS staff member Al
Bui 'O2 said students may not
draw funds from the school when
it is not in session.
This setback, along with technical difficulties, has caused the
SCCS room to remain closed.
Though it would have been ideal
for the center to be open when
school began, SCCS would rather
"get things right rather than get

things open fast," Stepleton said.
Despite the delays, Stepleton
assures that SCCS is "making
progress" and plans on making
good on all of their campaign
promises made last fall.
These promises include purchasing digital cameras, a Sony
Play Station, a big-screen televiall this in
sion and a projector
addition to computers.
Maria Elena Young 'O4 feels
that having a new computing center will be positive "because no
one likes to hike up to Beardsley
at 2 a.m."
Although the details of the
brand new center are yet to be
settled, "the big picture has been
set since last spring" stated Bui.
This bigger picture revolves
around the idea of building an
"interactive environment meant to
immerse students" said Bui, "SCCS
wants students to view computers
as fun rather than an intimidating
box. We want students to carry out

artistic endeavors and have fun
with technology."

Indecision in common

exchanging tales of how they ended up at

"We came to the conclusion that for all of us there

first year. Four years is a long time. I feel less enthusiastic and idealistic now. I feel like a jaded upperclassman. So it's good I'm only going to be here for
a little while."

New, but not fresh
With the shared experience of having started college once already, then becoming unsatisfied, many
transfers feel distanced from freshmen and their
enthusiasm.
"I didn't come here thinking, 'This is the perfect
place for me.' I didn't come with stars in my eyes,"
Dryden said. "We'll see."
Claire Vancik 'O4, however, said she enjoys feeling just like a freshman again. "I'm not as cynical as
other transfers," she said.
Vancik did not attend an academic college last

arts school in the East Village of New York City that
provides free tuition. Though she loves art, Vancik
felt limited and decided she was in the wrong place.
During orientation at Cooper, students played
games, introducing themselves as either artists,
engineers or architects, the three programs of study
the school offered. "I felt this strange desire to say I
liked English too," Vancik said. As the year went on,
Vancik said, "I was spending 20 hours a day doing
all these things I did not want to be doing," she said.
"Yet is was still really hard to leave. I had put so
much effort into getting in."

First impressions
Most transfers have enjoyed their time here so
far. The college has made a strong impression on
Dryden, who grew up in Berkeley, California.
Students here are of a different sort than the people

she was used to, something she noticed at the 'Bos
party during orientation. "I've never been to a party
like that," she said. "Nobody cared what they looked
like. It was just truly bizarre and cool."
Fort mentioned a conversation he had with some
students he barely knew at dinner about the nature
of evil. He ran into them later in the evening and the
discussion was still continuing.
Dryden noted, however, that Swarthmore hasn't
seemed prepared to welcome a large group of transfers. The last time a sizable group of them came to
the college was in 1995, when 13 arrived. "They're
not used to having so many transfers. I feel like
we're getting a little shafted," she said. In particular,
Dryden said, she is not enthralled about spending
her first year in Mary Lyon basement.

Committee seeks

The
Committee is soliciting nominations from all members of the college community for individuals
who will speak at graduation.
From the initial pool, several
individuals are awarded a degree,
and then give advice to the graduating seniors concerning their
life choices and values beyond
the college sphere.
The committee, chaired by
President Al Bloom and Vice
President for College and
Community Relations Maurice

biographies of public servants
and professionals whom they
think exemplify the values and
ideals of Swarthmore.

Community reacts
to national tragedy
Dear Swarthmore,
We saw you this week. As Tuesday morning's
classes drew to a close, you gathered around televi-

sions scattered throughout the campus, staring fixedly at the screens, slowly realizing that the information you so desperately needed earlier you would now
prefer not to know.
Amid reports that thousands had probably died in
terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, you ran to your rooms in hopes of contacting friends and family, anxious for assurances
that they were safe.
Clutching often useless cell phones and changing
channels to catch the right mix ofKatie Couric and
Dan Rather, you listed those you knew in New York

Dear Editor:

smile greetings as usual, and instead exchanged
somber looks. The question "How are you doing
today?" took on a new, less flippant meaning. You
hugged, wept, held each other; you searched for
words ofcomfort and looked to each other to find
some glimmer of hope in the darkest of days.
You showed the best of this community this week.
When you gathered that night at Collection, you
sought to support not merely those you knew before,
but also those you suddenly grew close to.
Most of all, you were eager to find out if there was
something, anything you could do to help. You asked
to donate blood, and you will. You put politics and
divisiveness aside and instead focused on comforting
those around you.
So many of us feel compelled to respond to
tragedies ofall kinds with action, but perhaps half
the terror we felt was the helplessness
everywhere
people expressed a need to jump in, make things bet-

ter.

Unable to rush off to New York or Washington,
instead you helped each other right here at home,
rediscovering how important it is to value the people
around you, on two very differentlevels.
In a very direct sense, you were reminded not to
take anyone for granted. In the most everyday sense,
this means people like friends, family, like one
person who spoke at collection about the very emotional experience of calling his mother to tell her he
loved her.
And in another, broader way, you went beyond
that. Many of you determined that you must feel the
same level of compassion for people in distant places
constantly affected by other tragedies.
If, as one woman said at Collection, you felt as
though you were a New Yorker this week, then you
must be challenged to feel as strongly like someone
from Rwanda, Sierra Leone or Kosovo. The value of
human life is the same everywhere.

OPINIONS
DAN KOROBKIN
In Public

Where do we
go from here?
When my mother was in elementary school, classes

were interrupted periodically to conduct air-raid drills.
The children were told to crouch under their desks with
their hands over their heads, and that this is what they
would do if there were ever a nuclear attack. Only when
she was older did my mother realize how silly those airraid drills were, how little protection a desk would provide during a nuclear attack and what sad commentary
they were on the vulnerability of school-age children at
the dawn of a Cold War.
That Cold War is over now, but it appears that one terrible specter of nuclear annihilation has been replaced by
a new pall of uncertainty over how much security we can
expect, where our enemies lie and how powerful we are to
fight back.
We can also see, now, thatlike those air-raid drills from
the 19505, our day-to-day lives magically create an illusion
of security out of thin air. We now know that intelligence
operations, airport security and vigilance can prove about
as useful a protection against terrorism as school desks
were against nuclear bombs.
A friend of mine, caught in the mayhem of lower
Manhattan on Tuesday, e-mailed his account of the terror
to anxious friends and relatives whom he could not reach
by phone: "The scariest thing was that it didn't seem
clear whether the attack was over. After the first plane
hit, and then after the second plane hit, and then after the
towers collapsed
after each earth-shaking impact it
seemed like the disaster was over and the rescue could
begin, but each time there was more. No one knew what
to do."
Indeed, many of us are also frightened, unsure what
the future holds or whatkind of action to take. Where do
we go from here?
It is difficult, of course, to have perspective on a horrific event the day, or week, it occurs. But I think I could
hazard a guess or two as to what kind of choices our country and its leadership will face once the dust clears, quite
literally, from this tragedy.
Was this a terrorist attack or the beginning of a war?
The last time the U.S. was attacked on its own soil was
Dec. 7,1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The attack
led directly to the United States' entrance into World War
11, the deadliest conflict of that century.
Now, we must decide if Tuesday's attack, more costly
in lives than Pearl Harbor but carried out with commercial airliners rather than warplanes, should be met with a
powerful, sustained military retaliation. The Bush administration, already hawkish on missile defense and international relations, risks propelling the country into a long
fight against an unseen enemy with no rules of engagement. But many Americans, no doubt, now think that it is
a war worth fighting.
Whose liberties are up for grabs? Even in a country
where liberty is paramount, Americans have long tolerated certain restrictions on their freedom, especially in
times of national peril, for the sake of a greater free-

dom.

In principle, this trade-off is the subject of an ongoing
and balanced national dialogue; in practice, the civil liberties of certain types of people are often sacrificed to satisfy the bigotry of some and feed the fear of many others.
The Bush administration, I would wager, is not too concerned about this problem. But we must be.
When do we discuss ideology? Most people in other
parts of the world are expressing shock and sympathy for
this catastrophe; they think it was a terrible event, and
rightly so.
But they are also willing to talk a little bit about why
something like this might happen in the United States, a
subject that few Americans are willing to broach. Our
bravest public figures will condemn terrorism always,
but they will also point out that questioning our international policies, a healthy exercise in democracy, may be
part of what it takes to fight terrorism and win.

Missile defense now
BY DAVID THOMAS
AND CARLTON DAVIS

The nature of democracy seems
to require a system of national
defense that is more reactive than

proactive. The history of America is
filled with examples of our systematic approach; times like Pearl

Harbor and the Cuban Missile Crisis
show the way in which our defense
policy has been and is reactive by
nature. While it is true that no free
nation can fully prepare nor completely prevent catastrophes on the
scale of Pearl Harbor and the events

of Tuesday, our nation usually finds
itself completely caught off guard.
Because the United States is a
democracy that tends to value civil
liberties over most issues of national security, we cannot rely on the
intrusiveness of a police state, as did
the Eastern Bloc during the Cold
War. We, as Americans, value our
freedom of movement and personal
choice too highly to accept more
restrictive security measures in the
long term. As such, we rely almost
completely on intelligence to warn
us of coming attacks.
Even the most advanced intelligence is not foolproof, and there are
times, such as Tuesday, when we are
caught unaware. The results are
sometimes disastrous.
Even though our country has
always had a reactive defense policy,
that does not mean that we must
have one in the future. It is possible
for the United States government to
protect the freedoms and civil liberties that make America great while
at the same time shifting our nation-

al defense policy to a more proactive
stance.
The national missile defense sys-

tem (NMD) is a good example of this
kind of proactive shift. Too often we
have waited

until

disaster has

already struck to devise a means of
preventing what has already happened. Two weeks ago most
Americans would have scoffed at the
idea of strengthening airport security as too time-consuming and inconvenient, and thus ultimately unnecessary. Asking again today, however, one would be hard-pressed to find
anyone who still feels the same. It is

impossible to determine whether
tightened security would have pre-

vented or lessened Tuesday's disaster, though we suspect it would have
at least had some effect. At the very
least, however, it could not have
made Tuesday worse than it already
was. The NMD is a similar kind of
preventative measure.
Opponents of a NMD will argue
that it is too costly, unnecessary and
ultimately ineffective. Even if the

opponents' claims are mostly true,
NMD is still an idea whose time has
come. The first issue is that of cost.
NMD could be expensive; possibly
costing as much as $lOO billion with
results that, as of right now, are not
clear. However, compare this to pub-

lie education, the cost of which has

more than quadrupled in the last
decade and a half, with no measurable improvement by students.
Nobody is suggesting that funds for
public education be cut; education is
too important to Americans. We suggest that avoiding a possible terrorist nuclear strike is equally important. What cost can be put on
Tuesday's disaster?

The second issue is that of neces-

sity. It is clear that there are elements within the world community
that America cannot police. If we
cannot control them, then we must
be prepared to defend ourselves
against them. Our current policy of
proportional response cannot erase

the disaster and death that follows,
but a strong defense would prevent
the loss of life in the first place.

Missile defense may currently be
only 50 percent effective, but with
the rate of improvement in modern
technology, computer and otherwise, this effectiveness can only
increase. Even at 50 percent, missile
defense gives us a chance that we
otherwise might not have. As its
effectiveness increases, the relative
cost of such a system seems less and

less.

America can no longer afford to
be reactive in an age when terrorism, and even war, can happen in
the blink of an eye. We must be prepared to defend ourselves against
those that

(MAD) may have been the standard

guaranteeing the safety and freedom
of all Americans.

Don't declare war on the innocents
BY DANN NASEEMULLAH
There isn't any other way to start this article but to
express the maelstrom of sorrow, regret, anger, outrage,
confusion and sheer disbelief that everyone in this community
and indeed everyone in this nation and the
world over have been feeling since 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
I won't presume to feel or understand the pain of the
many families affected, but I do feel hurt that any people
would ever think that causing this amount of pain would
be worth it, for anything.
With that said, this is the hardest article I've ever had
to write. The tremendous sorrow that this nation feels
right now is accompanied by a lot of anger, and that
anger will probably be manifested in the space of a few
days in a retaliatory military offensive the likes of which
the world has never seen. I write to urge against this

U.S. should not shrink
before terrorism's evil
Tuesday morning at 9:50 I walked to class. I cheerfully
greeted my friends along the way as I always do. Some
responded amiably, but others just stared ahead silently.
These were the ones who already knew.
I found out in class. While about half the class and the
professor proceeded to outline our new strategic paradigm, the rest of us retreated into ourselves, shell-

shocked. Toward the end of class, a student said some-

stationing of United States troops in the Muslim Holy
Land. Innocent lives were taken on an unprecedented

scale for the advancement of an ideological position.
Now is not the time to argue ideology. Instead, I think
today is the day we must bring out our humanity in spite
ofloss and anger, to not turn into terrorists ourselves, as
Craig Williamson put it at Collection on Tuesday night.
For my part, I have a very personal concern: my Dad's
safety. My father is a Muslim, a medical professor and a
good, peace-loving man. He lives in Islamabad, Pakistan.
If the United States government decides to start bombing
Pakistan as an identified "terrorist state" and an ally to
the Taliban regime, then my home, my family and my
pre-Swarthmore life could all be destroyed. Humanity
and humility are essential to avoid an escalating cycle of
loss and pain that could only end in utter tragedy for all
the world's people. The United States government's current rhetoric
"war of civilization against evil"
makes me fear for my family and for all those innocents
who could suffer the consequences.
Tuesday night's meeting was a time in which those
essential qualities of humanity and humility were
brought forth by a community still reeling from the pain,
loss and anger of the day. Swarthmore's spirit of conscience, reflection and compassion came out more for me
in that one night than ever before in my three years here.
For that I am thankful. I only hope that the spirit of
Tuesday's meeting may be reflected in the nation as we
all come to grips with what has occurred.

Revenge must come, but carefully
BY TED CHAN
When the pandemonium subsides, and the healing process from
the attack on New York City and
Washington, D.C. begins, the lens
will turn to what America will do as
it takes to the offensive. The United
States, a sleeping giant with nearly
unlimited destructive power, has
awakened, and for many of its citizens, only one thing will be in their
minds and hearts: revenge.
But what will be appropriate?
Surely, America cannot do nothing.
But launching a counterattack
against an enemy as invisible and
übiquitous as a terrorist group is
problematic, especially against one
organized and powerful enough to

hijack four airplanes and attack the

hearts of our trade and defense.
We should leave no stone
unturned, no available resource
unused, to track down these animals.
They must be found in order to prevent the same party from attempting
something like this again. In the past,
the "evil" United States has usedforce
where there was some debate as to
whether it was appropriate or any of
its business. But in the last 20 years,

the American military has been
extremely cautious and tactical about
protecting civilians. Attacking the
World Trade Center using commercial planes obviously shows a flagrant disregard for civilian life. This
is the murder of civilians, as much a
mini-Holocaust as a military attack.
However, President Bush and his
advisers must also consider the consequences of any retaliation. Bush's
decision to make no distinction
between the terrorists and the nations
that harbor them is the proper first
step, but how that is carried out is far
more important. If Osama bin Laden
is responsible, the Taliban will likely
protect him by refusing extradition
without a fair trial or hiding him to
the best of its ability. The United
States will require sufficient evidence
to bring a terrorist to trial in order to
justify attacking a nation that harbors
him. The judge of this will be the
international community. A wrong
move in this regard could lead to any-

counter-terrorist Delta Force taking
out a guilty terrorist organization and
its leaders. However, United States
policy prohibits the assassination of
political individuals, and this could
be construed as such. Congress has
the ability to override this, and that
might make sense, since this is a not
political enemy we are dealing with,
but instead heartless murderers.
We must deal with this as forcefully and swiftly as America sees fit.
We must put aside economic interests and act the way the American
community as a whole believes is
appropriate. My belief is that these
actions would be just, and could be
rationalized by the rest of the international community. And yet we
must still be careful. There is
absolutely no justification for the
use of a neutron bomb or tactical
nuclear strike, even if the damage to
the environment was nil. There is no
justification for an invasion of
another nation unless that country

thing from the shunning of the United
States economically or politically to,

East. Osama bin Laden, who as of this the time of this submission appears to be the perpetrator of Tuesday's murders, has repeatedly expressed his desire for the United
States to depart the region.
We have a choice before us. We can shrink and shrivel
before terrorism, which represents the last resort of the
weak. We can adopt the mentality that the television networks seem to want to impose on us: that we can never
feel safe again. We can forsake our dearest friends in order
to cower in fear. We can embrace Pat Buchanan's isola-,
tionist foreign policy, justified by his fear of inviting the
wrath of tomorrow's terrorists. We can surrender our
principles and let our enemies win.
Let there be no doubt that we all grieve for the victims
of Tuesday's attacks. Many of us knew them and loved

them. But while we mourn their deaths, we also must realize that it could have been far worse. Weapons of mass
destruction could have been used, and in the coming years
they will be unless we choose the other option. We must
elect to fight.
We must awaken from our decade-long slumber of petty
political bickering. Needless to say, this column was originally a partisan treatise on the narrow political differences
that peaceful nations can afford to have. How petty that
seems in retrospect. A lot of people in our generation have
felt a national apathy, and we've longed for the days of past
crusades where right and wrong were clearly defined.
As of Tuesday, we have a new national mission just as
integral to the defense of civilization as our fight against
the Nazis. If we listen to Tuesday's clarion call, we'll recognize that the time has come to actually start fighting a
war we're already intricately involved in. That means
empowering the CIA and FBI with both our funds and our
confidence. That means systematically obliterating the
complex, decentralized terrorist network that bin Laden
heads. That means taking on any foreign government,
such as Iraq, that may have contributed to this tragedy.
That means declaring war against our enemies, and mobilizing our national resources toward their eradication.
But the right choice doesn't involve altering our
blessed way of life. And it doesn't involve abandoning
Israel. And while we'll need to strengthen our Arab
alliances, we also now realize how innocent our
"restraint" advice to Israel really was. We'll now have to
live with terrorism the same way that Israel and Europe
have for years. And we'll learn what they already know:
the right response to terrorism is channeled indignation
directed at our enemies.
We're generally taught at Swarthmore that there is no
right or wr,ong, and that we must have compassion for the
nuances of differing ideologies! But that übiquitous empty
stare that blanketed Swarthmore Tuesday morning was
evidence that we're all now witnesses to evil. We should
choose to fight back.

retaliation.
As I write
a mere 12 hours after the first plane
crashed into the World Trade Center
no one knows
anything for certain. Most commentators, policy-makers
and individuals think that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
millionaire who runs a multinational network of terrorists and is currently staying in Taliban-ruled
Afghanistan, is behind the attack. While at this point
nothing has been confirmed, the combined military
might of the United States will in all likelihood be
unleashed against bin Laden (just as soon as the intelligence services find a link, however tenuous), and against
the Taliban regime as bin Laden's "host" nation.
The big problem with retaliation in these circumstances is that, however much the parallels do apply, this
is not Pearl Harbor. The United States would be declaring a war against an individual, not a nation and would
be fighting against an ideology as opposed to a geopolitical interest. Nonetheless, declaring war is always actually done in a territorial space with real places and real
people that have to face the stinger missiles and maybe
even, God forbid, a nuclear device. This is why I hope the
American nation can find it in its heart to reject the
notion that to declare war against terrorism is to declare
war against the nations (and peoples) only indirectly
associated with the terrorists themselves. This move
would provide tangible targets for Navy and Air Force
strikes, and lead to the death of a large number of civilians who have nothing to do with terrorism.
To be sure, hundreds and thousands of American civilians have died in the attacks on the World Trade Center,
the Pentagon, the State Department and elsewhere. The
vast majority of these people had very little influence on

f

Chechnya

BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

Extremist Muslim terrorist groups blame you for decades
of persecution and wage war upon you in the only way they
can. They bomb your government's buildings in their capital.
They execute on the spot all persons of your nation found
within theirborders, or maybe they take a little while. Maybe
they ask for ransoms or torture the captives first. They hijack
an airplane (or two, or three or eight). Buildings explode.
They explode in the very capital of your country, collapsing.
People die.
You rush to the phone to call your aunt, who commutes to
that city for work from the suburbs, and her two daughters,

Terror is infectious. It spreads like
cholera. It permeates your every
single cell.
and her husband, and her friends, and your friends and all
those people you barely remember. The world pauses over an
abyss in freefall, weightless, mere moments before the entirety of its weight crushes down upon your shoulders. And then,
your world explodes and burns before your eyes. Time stops.
You see boys on television; boys without moustaches. Boys
from your hometown. They say there is only one way to stop
terrorism: to obliterate them all. After all, once you feel that
twitch of terror down your spine, you never feel safe again.
Your nation aches for revenge, thirsts for blood and looks
for someone to blame. Anyone, in fact. And revenge is one of
those things: you never get enough. So, when your own troops
those boys without moustaches kill civilians and quarter a female enemy sniper somewhere deep within the
Caucasian mountains, you feel satisfied. When there are mass
executions in your enemy's small settlements, which may or
may not harbor the terrorists, you are happy. You taste their
blood. You see pictures of them dead by the hundreds, their
lands turned into post-apocalyptic nightmarish visions, and
your heart soars. You are happy, because you hate them all.
You are happy, because where they are now, they cannot
harm you or yours.
Or at least that is what my grandmother, an ethnic
Russian living in Caucasian mountains had been telling me
for the last ten years about the war with Chechnya. All these
things happened. Russia, my native country, is being slowly
bled by terror. The horrid atrocities committed by Russians
in Chechnya are its exasperated last attempt to regain its sanity in light of a dead economy and a foe that is as ruthless as
it is fearless and dedicated to its cause.
Terror is infectious. It spreads like cholera. It permeates
your every single cell. And most of all, it drives people insane
with rage, anger, frustration and desperation, and it turns
them into a scared and irrational mob.
On Tuesday, the country that I have chosen to call my
home and that I cherish above my life was attacked. The
destruction of the World Trade Center was an act of war
against this country and its citizens. It anguishes and tortures me and, perhaps, makes me slightly wonder why,
despite all my frantic searches for a new homeland, I have yet
to find one that is not being constantly pestered by violent terrorist acts of one kind or another. The gifts this country has
given me surpassed my most sacred girlish desires and
dreams; things like true freedom and a semblance of equality.
To attack America is to attack its sacraments, its guarded
truths and liberties. And, in this age of the one and only true
superpower, it is also to invoke upon oneself a wrath more
fearsome than even God's own: he only made soot and ashes
rain on Sodom and Gomorra. That was New York, Tuesday. It
only gets worse from here. What terrible resolutions to this
plot concocted by some village idiot seeking his own imminent destruction tomorrow will bring, I do not dare guess. But
I do dare hope it not be as horrible as the one decided upon by
my motherland, for in-waging a vengeful and bloody war with
only an eye for an eye as a nation's objective, a nation forever scars itself. In seeking retribution for the lives lost and a
nation brought to a halt, America must seek only punishment
for the guilty and security for its borders and citizens. All
else, the past proves, will be nothing more than a wounded
beast's blind rage.

PLATFORMS
Platforms for Campus Life Representative

Ryan Chahrour '04

A special election is needed to fill a Student Council position of
Campus Life Representative, which was vacated by Lauren Tobias
'O2 when she was elected co-chair. Since the terms of the two
Campus Life Representatives last for one year and are staggered
by semester, this term will end in December at the end of this
semester. According to the description provided by the council, the
Campus Life Representative has the responsibility to initiate and
participate in projects designed to improve the quality of life at
Swarthmore and work with Student Council to advocate effectively
for students' concerns and opinions about life on campus.
These platforms are submitted by the candidates and represent
their views only, and not the views of The Phoenix.

If you've found yourself disappointed with the low
priority quality oflife issues receive on Swarthmore's
campus, then we have something in common. We
come to Swarthmore expecting an intense academics,
but we should also expect to enjoy the experience. As
your campus life representative, I would make
increasing your day to day enjoyment oflife on campus my priority. I will be an advocate for you in your
attempt to make the most of your time on campus.
As your representative, I will begin by focusing
on one simple but important goal: creating a space

that students can go to any time and expect to find
other students interested in socializing, relaxing and
having fun. We definitely do not have such a place at
the moment. The space ought to be well-maintained,
have a variety of activities and be readily accessible
at all times. This is the first step in creating a more
healthy, relaxed atmosphere.
I want to be your quality of life advocate at
Swarthmore. You deserve meal plans more suited to
your lifestyle; athletic facilities that are more available
for athletes and non-athletes alike; and you should
always feel safe on campus. These concerns are of high
importance and deserve powerful representation. I ask
to be your voice in advocating these important issues.

Voting will take place in Sharpies on Sept. 19-21

making Kohlberg open 24 hours,

NCAA Woman of the Year?
BY ANNA MASILELA AND KATE NELSONLEE

A fierce defender, recent Swarthmore graduate Kristen English has been named

as one of the 10 finalists for the NCAA Woman of the Year.

Kristen English 'Ol was named one of ten
finalists for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Woman of the Year Award. She
was nominatedfor the award by the athletic
department and was selected as a finalist
from among the winners from each state. The
award recognizes women in intercollegiate
athletics for their outstanding achievements
in athletics, academics and community service. English, who graduated with a degree in
psychology, played lacrosse, field hockey and
basketball.
In lacrosse, English was named the 2001
Division 111 Defender of the Year, a United
States Lacrosse/Brine All-American in 2001
and 2000 and a US Lacrosse All-American in
2001 and 2000. Always a presence on the field,
she was a first-team Centennial Conference
selection three years running.
English was no stranger on the field hockey pitch, earning Centennial Conference
Player of the Year in 2000 as well as first-team
Centennial Conference in 2000 and 1999. She
was also selected as a National Field Hockey
Coaches Association All-American. A clear
leader both on and off the field, she was recognized by the Swarthmore athletic depart-

ment with the Gladys Irish Award at the close
of her tenure as Garnet Tide no. 20.
Head field hockey and lacrosse coach
Karen Borbee spearheaded English's nomination to be the NCAA Woman of the Year. "It's
obvious from all her accolades that she's an
outstanding athlete, and it's obvious she's an
outstanding student. But what most people
don't know about [English] is what an outstanding individual she is."
Many of her former teammates and classmates have felt her absence this fall. Katie
Tarr 'O2 who played all three sports with
English, said "English was a great mentor for
me throughout the three years we played
together, and I'm very excited for her having
this recognition for all her hard work. It's
great that a Swarthmore student-athlete is
being recognized for such a prestigious
award."
Having graduated, English is headed out
to southern California for the year. She's taking a comedy writing program from an
improv troupe inLA, as well as serving as the
head coach for the club lacrosse program at
Claremont McKenna College.
The winner of the award will be
announced on Oct. 2L Tarr hopes English
wins; "It would be a great end to a fabulous
career at

Swarthmore."

Cross country on track to win
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
Just a few seconds after the bang of the gun in
Swarthmore's Cross Country Alumni Meet on Sept. 8, Krista

Gigone 'O4 found herself struggling to regain her footing. After
and bleeding, she managed to stand
up and complete the race. Cross country team members hope
that they will be able to do the same in the coming season.
Following the departure of several talented seniors, including
two-time Centennial Conference Runner of the Year Joko
Agunloye 'Ol and Centennial Conference First Team member
Marc Jeuland 'Ol, the cross country team sees this year as one
of rebuilding.
But even while developing strength, endurance and team
solidarity, the cross country team looks to defy expectations.
Though both the men's and women's teams were ranked sixth
out of nine and ten teams respectively in a preseason coaches'
poll of Centennial Conference prospects, Swat runners may be
poised to surprise a few people. "The season looks like it will
be an intense one because we have a shot of finishing in the
top three in the conference this year," said men's co-captain
Don Nguyen 'O3.
Armed with a youthful composition that should make the
team consistent in coming years, the team is working to
develop the depth of its runners. Coach Pete Carroll agreed
that the team is a strong one, and also predicted long-term
improvement. "Even though we lose two really solid runners,
I think our team as a whole will be better. A lot of that contribution will come from first-year [students]," he said. "It's hard
to improve on age. Only time can do that. The future is going
an initial misstep, bruised

to be very positive. We just need time to gel."
Additionally, several team members stressed the enthusiasm of first-year students as a contributing factor to the overall strength of the team. "This team has several talented, but
young guys. It'll be interesting to see how things progress. As
the freshmen get used to the differences between high school
and college-cross country, this team could become great," said
men's team member Ryan Budish 'O4.
Women's co-captain Loring Pfeiffer 'O2 said the women's
team has also benefited from new blood. "The women's team
got a huge crop of first-years, who have been really psyched
about training since they arrived on campus for preseason,"
she said.
In addition to first-year students, several upperclassmen
have returned from injury after being sidelined during last
year's women's fourth-place Conference finish and men's
sixth-place Conference finish. Among these, Gigone and

Maria-Elena Young 'O4 look to have impressive seasons.
In explaining why Swat has a chance of winning the big
contests this year, runners are quick to cite the overall character of this year's team. "Cross country is talent, but it's also
guts and desire; I think [we] have all three of those things.
Distance running also involves a bit of self-hatred, but we've
got that down, too," men's co-captain Joe Makin 'O3 said.
Though the women may have a tough time beating out
first-ranked Dickinson, and the men may have difficulty
upsetting heavy favorite Haverford, the Swarthmore cross
country team will definitely be a contender for high conference standings, and promises to give any opponent a run for
its money.

GAME OF THE WEEK
Volleyball Tournament
When: Sept. 15
Where: Tarble Pavillion in Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse
Coming off a 3-0 victory over Albright on Sept 5, the women's volleyball team is prepared to challenge Caltech and Lincoln at the
Swarthmore Invitational tournament. The current lineup of the
Caltech team, which finished 5-17 last year in the Southern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, has not yet been tested this season, but Swat is going to try to ensure that they fail. The
volleyball team has both the offensive and defensive side of the
game covered, with co-captain Bryn Rosenfefd 'O3 bringing in the
kills and Katrina Morrison 'O4 blocking any attempts by opponents.
Watch for Natalie Dunphy 'O5, a new talent on the team, to contribute on the offensive as well.

BY DERRICK WU

The field hockey team, a perennial title contender in
the Centennial Conference, is facing a mini-offensive crisis that it hopes to set straight at the Seven Sisters tournament on Sept. 15 and 16.
The team suffered a 4-0 loss to the Rowan Profs, the currently fourth-ranked Division 111 team in the nation, on
Sept. 6. In the first half of the game, Swat was able to neutralize Rowan's high-flying offense with solid plays in the
backfield and quick counterattacks down the sidelines.
However, Swat's defense faltered twenty minutes into the
game, when Rowan was able to knock the ball past Swat
goalie Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 twice in one minute.
Nelson-Lee, named to this week's Centennial
Conference Honor Roll, finished the game with 15 saves.
The netminder currently boasts a 90.0 percent save percentage, the third best in the conference. "Kate [NelsonLee] has been amazing," said forward Kim Cariello 'O2.
With Swat unable to mount a consistent offensive
attack, Rowan turned up the heat and dominated the rest
of the game with excellent ball-handling skills and constant pressure on the Swat defense. Rowan finished the
game with an 11-1 advantage on penalty corners and a 253 advantage on shots.
Cariello blames Swat's recent lack of offensive production on the small amount of playing time the new frontline
has seen together. "We're having trouble scoring right
now," she said. "Our offense has yet to gel."
Swat's best opportunity to score came during the second half when Cariello used her speed to advance the ball
on the right side of the field into Rowan territory and
cross the ball to co-captain Amy Dißenedetto 'O2.
Dißenedetto was able to get a quick shot off despite heavy
traffic in the middle of the field.
"I thought we played well in stretches. Rowan did the
same thing we did to Widener," said head coach Karen
Borbee. Swat beat Widener 1-0 on Sept. L

The Garnet's conference opener did not go quite as
planned. Swat lost to undefeated Western Maryland on
Sept. 8
the first loss to Western Maryland in eight years
of conference play. The Garnet dominated the first half,
holding a 12-6 shot advantage and 3-1 advantage in penalty
corners. Alison Gaffney 'O2 tried to light a Swat offensive
spark with her team-high five shots on goal, but the Tide
wac unable to capitalize. Five minutes into the second half,
the Greui Terror caught the Swat defense off guard on a
penalty corner for the eventual 1-0 win. Western
Maryland's Clara Hollingsworth 'O5 tallied her first collegiate game-winner off a pass from Tracy Kessler 'O3. The
Green Terror broke into the Division 111 national rankings

this week and are tied for 14th with William Patterson.
Though the Garnet made a run to the inaugural
Centennial Conference Championship Finals last season,
the team was tied for third in a conference preseason
coaches poll. A big reason for the dip in rankings this season is the graduation of five starters, including Centennial
Conference Player of the Year Kristen English 'OL The 2000
team, led by English, was runner-up in the conference last
year, when it lost 1-0 in a bitterly fought match against
conference rival Johns Hopkins. Had they won that game,
Swat would have gained an automatic bid to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
"Every year we graduate great seniors. This year isn't
particularly different," said Dißenedetto. "We won't be
satisfied unless we have a winning season."
Borbee is setting her sights for another run in the playoffs: "We're looking to be competitive and finish in the top
four so we can make the playoffs," she said.
Look for Swat field hockey to bounce back at the Seven
Sisters tournament at Mount Holyoke this weekend,
where they have traditionally fared well. In 1998, the team
took home the championship trophy and has reached the
finals in both 1999 and 200 L "Everybody needs to step up,"
said co-captain Katie Tarr 'O2. "Everyone's always out to
get Swarthmore."
