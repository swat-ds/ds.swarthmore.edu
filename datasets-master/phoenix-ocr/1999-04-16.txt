Students question
rock concert cost
by Carly Hammond
Staff Writer

The night of April 3
Swarthmore came face to face
with the $B5OO Waylon Experience, a party, dance, and multimedia event featuring the
band Waylon, funded instead
of the annual Worthstock tradition. Complete with moving
lights, video feeds and projection screens as well as some
fireworks, the concert entertained the crowd but produced
some mixed reactions. Students enjoyed the show, but
several questioned the cost.
"It was something new in
terms of the big band production, but $B5OO is a lot to
spend," said Matt Davis 'Ol.

The diplomas Swarthmore graduates earn, including the ones given to these 1977
graduates, contain the clause "in the year of our Lord." After finding mixed student opinion,

After a plethora of polls

Swarthmore's College Bowl team placed as the second national undergraduate team when they traveled to the University of Michigan to compete in the
national quiz bowl competition held April 9-10. Swarthmore's four man comprised of Ed Cohn '99, Josh Miller 'OO, Jessica Harbour '99, Peter Austin 'O2
competed with teams from 48 other schools that included the University of Chicago, Harvard, Stanford and the University of Maryland. Carleton College won
the undergraduate title, and the University of Chicago won the overall title.
In college bowl competitions there are toss up questions which any member of

his or her is awarded a bonus question.

Von Wettberg wins Fulbright Fellowship
Three months after winning a Rotary scholarship, Eric Von Wettberg '99 has
also won a Fulbright Fellowship for a year's study in Copenhagen.
Von Wettberg said this week that he will probably decline the Rotary scholarship in favor of the Fulbright, which covers travel, tuition, room and board and
Denmark's national health insurance.
Von Wettberg is planning to study at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural
University in Copenhagen and return to the U.S. for graduate school a year later.
Associate Dean Gil Stott said about 15 Swarthmore students apply forFulbrights
each year, and about four to seven of them win.

India tested a version of its intermediate-range missile Sunday, defying U.S.
appeals toput its nuclear program on hold. Information Minister Mahajan told a
news conference that the Agni II ballistic missile, with a range of 1,240 miles,
was successfully launched off India's eastern coast.
Government officials said Pakistan was given advanced warning ofthe launch,
under an agreement signed in February when Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee
traveled to Pakistan. In the Pakistani capital, Foreign Minister Aziz confirmed
that Pakistan had received the warning on Saturday.
"We will examine how to respond to the Indian tests," he told The Associated
Press.
Wednesday and Thursday, Pakistan tested the Ghauri and Shaheen ballistic missiles, upping the ante in the missile race. The latter, the Shaheen I, with arange of
450 miles, comes nowhere close to India's possible range. These tests arrive amidst
political instability in India, with the government possibly losing its parliamentary
majority after the legislature reconvenes Thursday. Pakistan has said it doesn't
want an arms race, but won't be left behind if India begins developing arms.

Bryn Mawr emergency voting still short
of quorum

The lack of quorum at this semester's Plenary had a repeat when quorum was
again still unattained at the emergency Plenary voting to pass the remaining
twelve resolutions. Only Resolution 1 for the affirmation of self-government
and Resolution 8 regarding toilet paper were passed for Plenary 1999.
On the Monday following the dismal attendance at Plenary, student mailboxes
were stuffed with announcements regarding emergency voting. The emergency
voting was held concurrently with elections for some Student Government Association (SGA) positions but on separate ballots. Votes were counted Tuesday
and Wednesday night, and the final tally showed 620 votes, which was short of
the 784 votes (2/3 of the student body) needed for quorum.
The Bryn Mawr SGA Constitution does not have any specific provisions for
special Plenary sessions. According to SGA Vice-President Katie Long 'OO, the
Plenary Committee was not required to hold an emergency vote, but decided to
do so because "we felt compelled to give the community a second chance." Plenary Committee Member Akino Yamashita 'Ol says that Bryn Mawr can hold as
many voting sessions for changes to the Constitution as it wants, because making changes to the Constitution by a campus-wide 2/3 vote ofthe population is a
general provision ofthe Constitution, and not justa backup for when other resolutions fail to get passed during Plenary.
However, the failure to reach quorum a second time signaled that there still
was not enough interest to hold another emergency voting procedure.

President rejects new Haverford SC
constitution

On Wednesday, March 31, Haverford President Tom Tritton announced his
rejection of the new Students' Council Constitution that was passed by voice
vote at last month's Plenary, arguing that it failed to sufficiently acknowledge
the relationship between student government and the rest of the College.
This action prompted several students including the resolution presenters
and Honor Council Chairs to consider protesting the decision outside the Office of Admission, before backing down and deciding to express their concerns to the Board of Managers at their April 23 and 24 meeting. These students believe that Tritton has misrepresented the issues surrounding the Constitution and failed to take student opinion into account, and they disagree
with his decision to overturn a resolution passed by the student body at Plenary.

Starr comes out against independent
counsel act

Ken Starr told Congress Wednesday that the independent counsel act should be
allowed to die. As he sat alone before die Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
for more than three hours, Starr called the statute responsible for his current position "structurally unsound, constitutionally dubious" and even "disingenuous."
And, he argued, the independent counsel law raises balance of power issues
as it "tries to cram a fourth branch of government into our three-branch system."
"The statute should not be reauthorized," Starrrecommended in testimony. "Jurisdiction and authority overthese cases ought to bereturned to the Justice Department...A
duly authorized federal law-enforcement investigation [the independent counsel] came
to be characterized as yet another political game.Law became politics by othermeans,"
Starr said. "The impact on public attitudes was unmistakable."
It is a position that surprised Democrats and Republicans alike, and put Starr
in the odd position of agreeing with liberal Democrats. The politicization of his
investigation into President Clinton, Starr argued, led to the erosion ofthe public
trust. The last time the measure lapsed, it was Republicans who were pressing
for the law's demise.The independent counsel probe of the Reagan
administration's Iran-Contra scandal cost roughly $47 million, lasted six years
and dragged on past the Reagan era and into the Bush White House.

DNA evidence frees inmates after 12
years
ADA, Okla., April 15—Thursday two men who served 12 years in prison on
a murder conviction were freed in court on the basis that recent DNA tests from
the crime scene did not match either man.Dennis Fritz, 49, had been serving a

life sentence, and Ron Williamson, 46, had been sentenced to death.
"I wouldn't say I'm angry at this point," Fritz said at an impromptu courthouse
news conference. "I am upset to the point I would like to do everything I can to
prevent this from happening to someone else."
The investigation now centers a man who testified against them. A district judge
dismissed the murder charges against both men in the brutal slaying and sexual
assault of Debra Carter in her apartment. The charges were dismissed after Mary
Long, a criminologist with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, testified
that hair and semen samples submitted for DNA testing did not match either man.
"This case should have never been prosecuted," Fritz said. "The evidence they
had against me was insufficient and if the police had done an adequate investigation of all the suspects, this may have never happened."
The dismissal was set in motion in 1995, when Fritz contacted the Innocence
Project, an organization that reviews hundreds of cases of people who claim
false conviction, usually of rape or murder, and helps arrange for DNA tests for
them that were unavailable until recent years. The dismissals were the 61st and
62nd cases where prisoners in the United States had been exonerated after postconviction DNA testing.

Maintenance fixes some of Fieldhouse's leaks
by Mimi Hanaoka

Managing Editor

Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse suffers from the perennial problem of awkward lighting and
leaking ceilings, both of which
are the unfortunate results of
having skylights. This term no
faculty, staff or students have
lodged any official complaints
with Maintenance about the
condition of the field house
ceiling, yet students often
voice frustration about its condition.
"Of all the things we complain about, the athletic facilities are the worst. A fieldhouse
with a leaking roof is an ex-

ample ofhow poor our athletic
facilities are," stated Elizabeth
Hansen 'O2.
The fieldhouse ceiling is primarily composed ofa massive
skylight that has continually
leaked since it was first installed in the early 1980s. The
fieldhouse ceiling leaks because the skylight is made of
aluminum and plastic, and both
materials are highly sensitive
to the heat and to the cold. The
aluminum and plastic expand
in hot weather and contract in
cold weather, causing the gaskets in the ceiling to shift.
When the gaskets which hold
together the different panels of
the skylight shift excessively

the ceiling leaks.
Faculty and students lodged
complaints with Facilities
about the ceiling during the fall
semester. In response to these
complaints Maintenance performed "a significant amount
of repair work in the fall,"
stated Ralph Thayer, Director
of Maintenance. Maintenance
discovered that the ceiling's
flashing was the source of the
leakage. The flashing, which is
the metal that is used as a
shield around the panels ofthe
skylight in order to divert water so that all the water will
channel down between the
windows, had cracked. The
cracks in the flashing allowed

rain to seep through the ceiling.
While the constant leaking
did not damage any Fieldhouse
equipment it did damage the
planking underneath the roof.
Standard costs indicate that it
would cost well in excess of
half a million dollars to completely replace the skylight,
and Maintenance currently has
no plans to do so.
Members ofthe athletic faculty are becoming increasingly
concerned about the condition
of the Fieldhouse ceiling, and
are currently engaged in a discussion with Facilities over
how to resolve the issue. However, all discussion is informal

and there is currently no official panel or group responsible
for deciding how to resolve the
issue of whether or not to keep
the skylight or replace it with
artificial lighting. Thayer said,
"We won't be coming to a decision for at least another six
months."
If the College were to replace
the current skylight with a system of artificial lighting the
problem of leakage would be
eliminated. Proponents of artificial lighting state that artificial lighting would not alter
according to the weather but
would instead be able to offer
consistent lighting and less
glare.

The Dean's Office sent out
the first all-student survey at
Swarthmore March 23. Students who did not respond to
the survey last month received
a second copy this week.
Swarthmore was one of
many schools in the Consortium of Financing Higher Education (COFHE) to send out
the survey. According to Dean
of the College Bob Gross, the
purpose of the survey was to
obtain comparative data from
all of the schools in COFHE, a
group of prestigious colleges
and universities originally
formed to obtain comparative
data on the quality offinancial
aid at different educational institutions.
Swarthmore could do independent surveys to ascertain

the quality of various aspects
of the school, according to
Gross. However, Gross emphasized the value ofcomparative
data.
He gave the example of the
quality of dining services at
Swarthmore, where 9 percent
of all students think that food
services are excellent. "This
would be cause for alarm,"
Gross said, if the data was not
similar for other schools. However, an average of only 6 percent of students from a comparison group of three small
liberal arts colleges think that
food services are excellent.
"Fifty percent more students
think food services are excellent at Swarthmore," Gross
said, but added that these differences are not statistically
significant.
The supplemental survey,

History professor Pieter

along with NATO's misreading

Religion professor Jerry

Student Council Elections
student council
POSITIONS
Two-year positions
(Note: These representatives serve on both
Council and the specified committee the first
year but only serve as a member of the committee the second year)
College Budget Committee: The CBC
Representative participates in setting the
College's Annual Budget (approx
$3,000,000). Irregular discussion meetings
(sometimes weekly) focus on allocations for
programs, tuition, salary, and other disbursements. The Committee also works on endowment spending, investments and long range
planning. The candidate must be able to
articulate student concerns to administrators
in formal settings and understand basic
financial policy.

Board of Managers Observer: Responsibilities include attending two BOM meetings per
semester, chronicling BOM deliberations and
reporting to Student Council, the College
Student Committee and other interested
parties. Occasionally, the Observer must
represent student opinion to the Board and
its Student Life Committees.

One-year positions
Council on Educational Policy: The CEP
representative must voice student concerns in
weekly meetings which discusses educational
policy. Current issues include language and
graduation requirements, new areas of study,
faculty hiring, freshman seminars and nonhonors minors. Recommendations are then
presented to faculty, administrators and the
student body.

Curriculum Committee: The Curriculum
Committee representative discusses preexisting curriculum issues including the honors
program. Current issues include the honors
program, class scheduling and the wording of
the diplomas.
Secretary: The Secretary shall be responsible for recording all Council minutes at all
Council meetings, making them available for
all Council members and posting them on the
Council bulletin board. The Secretary is
responsible for all other documentation as
well.
College Planning Committee: The CPC
representative participates in the committee
which discusses long range planning. The
issues discussed affect the college community, setting policy concerning facilities, particularly renovations of buildings, and student
body population.

One-semester positions

(Note: These representatives serve the rest of

this semester and fall 1999.)

Appointments Chair: This member shall
head a five-member committee and organize
deliberations concerning student appointments
to college committees. The Appointments
Chair must also supervise and establish
channels of communication between the
student representatives of college committees
and Student Council. Finally, the Appointments
Chair is also a member of all hiring commit-

tees.

Elections will be held April 19-21 during lunch
and dinner hours in the Sharpies lobby.

Matt Schwartz 'Ol

BOM Observer

I plan to use the BOM position to focus on three key issues:
financial aid, endowment
spending and student space.
Aid: Swarthmore's financial
aid program is marginally better than all our competitor schools, but not nearly
what it could be given our endowment. A few irrationalities could be cleared up quickly. As of now, students are being paid six dollars an hour to do advanced horticultural work, perform clerical tasks and
administrate web pages. If you are on aid, the Government picks up halfthe tab, reducing the College's
cost to three dollars for jobs that normally command
ten to thirty dollars an hour. I would fight for new,
higher wage classes so students can be paid the wage
their skills demand. Term-time work expectations
need to be reduced to fulfill the College's promise of
seven hours of work a week. Financial aid students
must be given one summer's relief from summer earning expectations to pursue volunteerism and unpaid
internships.
Student Space: It seems that after bolstering spec
yield by promising a new athletic center, there's no
real reason to actually build it. I would keep the administration honest to its current timeline of Spring
2000, and push for funding to refurbish Tarble, Olde
Club, and Sharpies 111. The student space that burned
with Old Tarble is yet to be replaced.
Endowment Spending: I've educated myself on the
endowment and have come to the conclusion that our
current policies are too conservative, sacrificing many
new programs and facilities for the sake of future
generations of students. We can't continue to attract
present generations of students without basic programs and facilities like a student center, new faculty and enhanced financial aid. As BOM Observer,
I would work with faculty and administration to propose changes to the spending rule so we can see a bit
more of that $B4O million before we graduate.
I'm not running for BOM Observer to chat up CEOs
and network. I'm not running to fatten my thighs or
my resume by way of a few gourmet meals. Nor am
I running to observe. What I would like to do is fight
for a few basic, common sense issues, issues that I ve
been involved with throughout my timehere and that
I'm ready to take to the Board. I ask for your support.

Brandon Silverman 'O2
BOM Observer
As the Observer to the Board
of Managers, I would have two
responsibilities: fulfilling the
duties of the Observer as best
as I can and being a responsible
member of Student Council,
which means playing an active
role in improving the school. The following is what I
would do in each of those positions.
As a Student Council member, I would work to
give Student Council a more tangible voice in the
Board of Managers, through the expansion of current positions and/or the creation of new ones. This
is following the work of Trang Pham who has already procured active student roles in the Student Life
Committee and the Properties Committee. I am not
interested increasing the voice ofthe actual Observer,
however. I think it is just as necessary to have an objective witness at the meetings as it is to have an active representative at the meetings.
I would also explore the possibilities of submitting
a State of the School report to the Board of Managers, prior to each meeting, detailing the concerns of
the school from the perspective of the student body.
To be as effective as possible, preparing this report
would probably take up most of the Observer's time
before the two meetings. Ideally, it should address
the overall attitude of die Council, the various inde-

pendent organizations, and the student population as
a whole.
As the Observer to the Board of Managers, I would
follow up each meeting with another report, detailing what happened, what decisions were made, and
what my impressions of the event were, to the Student Council and the student body. The two reports
written each semester would be published in the Phoenix and hopefully, on the Student Council web page.
Finally and most importantly, I would use the meetings to gain a fundamental understanding of how
Swarthmore works in the interests of improving the
overall efficiency of the Student Council. Because
the position is inherently passive, there exists an incredible opportunity to witness, first-hand, what really goes on and how things happen. There are other
positions more suitable to enacting change at
Swarthmore, but there are no positions more suited
to gaining the knowledge required to making those
changes a reality. Attaining this understanding and
passing it on would be my primary goal as the Observer to the Board of Managers.
If you any questions or suggestions, please feel free
to call or e-mail me. Thank you.
Marvin Barron 'O2
College Budget Committee
It is unusual among schools for there to be a student position on a committee with such influence on
the policy and planning of the institution as the Col-

lege Budget Committee.
Through my semester as Student Budget Committee liaison to Student Council, I've been made aware
of several issues that I would like to address from the
CBC position.
Of foremost concern is student labor, especially as
a part of work-study. Though the financial aid office
expects that a certain amount be made throughout
the academic year, given the campus labor market,
this amount is often practically impossible to meet.
The financial office has also increased by one hour
the expected weekly time commitment.
Student Council has identified the process, means
and appeals offinancial aid to be a primary concern
to be addressed. In addition, the Council is pushing
for more student space. I would hope to further these
concerns as CBC will be central in discussions
such.
In general, I hope to fill the duties ofthe CBC rep
by promoting the budgetary desires of students to the
committee while communicating the constraints to
the students.
Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2
Council on Educational Policy

I went to three high schools. Among the many things
my experience taught me is the effect of graduation and
curriculum requirements on one's quality of life. One
school had a very rigid curriculum with httle choice
and many mandatory courses. Students often complained about these mandatory classes and put much
less effort into them. In turn, the teachers ofthese classes
dumbed them down until all we learned was the most
rudimentary basics of the class and how to BS a good
essay in it. Now I am not saying that this is what PDCs
are like at Swarthmore. I have taken some very rewarding PDCs. However, this is the danger of PDCs. When
we force students to take certain classes, we lower the
level of overall engagement with the class. The instructor then responds to this lower level. The instructor's
response can thus further lower the level of student engagement, and the downward spiral continues.
This, among other things, is why I am fully behind
the abolition of the current system of PDCs and will
work, if elected, to see this process through. Furthermore, I believe the new system ofWICs and QRCs now
being debated needs to be further clarified and made
more easily understood.

Eutting

Hello, my name is Kwabena
Adu and I am asking you to vote
for me as the Appointments
Chair of Student Council.
After these two years of active participation in all spheres
of college life, I have come to
the conclusion that the principal qualities that members ofStudent Council ought to possess is openness
and an unwavering sense of duty.
I am offering to serve the student body in this position because I firmly believe that I am the candidate
in whom you and the rest of Swarthmore can trust to
serve you diligently as Appointments Chair.

Dave Thomas 'OO
Appointments Chair
As Appointments Chair, my job would consist of
two separate parts. First, improving the appointments
process. And second, improving student council overall.
First, the appointments process. Everyone complains that committees like SAC are either DU-dominated, or all guy, or just not diverse enough. The problem is not with the appointments process, but rather
with the diversity of the applicants pool. The reason
there is only one woman on SAC is because only one
woman applied. As Appointments Chair, I would
work witn the Outreach Chair to ensure that more
people are interested in applying, giving the committees more diversity.
As for Student Council itself, I think it would be
interesting to take a look at revamping the system entirely. As I see it, there are two things about the Council that could be changed. First of all, because of the
structure, there is no accountability. If Student Council fails to accomplish something, it is impossible to
know who is responsible, just as it is difficult to know
who to credit with successes. I think it would be interesting to look at the possibility ofchanging council so
it more resembled the senior class officers, who are
far more efficient. This efficiency is the second problem. The time lag on our system is so great that the
council can not quickly respond to problems that arise.
This problem is inherent in the 12-member structure.
Under this new system, there would be a school
wide elected President, Vice-President and Treasurer.
In addition, each class would elect two Senators to
represent class interests. In this way, we could have
more responsible and accountable leadership, as the
president would be allowed to form more personal
relationships with the administration. Senators could
meet with theirclasses once or twice a month to make
sure they keep in touch.
If elected, I will try to have Student Council consider all that I have proposed. And more importantly,
I will listen to you.

Jon Bartner 'O2

Appointments Chair
Every candidate is preaching for reform in Student
Council and so am I. As Student Council works, there
are problems, but before you vote ask yourself something. is the person you're voting for concerned with
improving the situation at Swarthmore or improving
theirresume? Do you want a politician for Appointments Chair or do you want someone who actually
cares about appointing students with initiative? Do you
want someone who wants to appoint people who have
a genuine concern for improving the school, or do you
want to elect someone who will preach about the lack
of diversity while bashing white male athletes?
Too often positions in Student Council are babysat
by individuals who have no interest in transcending
the college. As Appointments Chair I will weed out
these individuals in favor of those truly dedicated to
reform. This is what you should come to expect from
elected leadership. If you want someone who truly
wants to solve the problems of Student Council
through work and not ego, if you want someone who
won't perpetuate the flawed Student Council as it is,
then consider voting for me.

College should put
money to better use
There is no doubt in our mind that Swarthmore is a financially
sound institution. Whether the College has its priorities straight is
another question altogether.
A quick glance at the 1997-1998 College Treasurer's Report
will confirm this assertion. When compared to 1997 expenses,
College spending increased in 1998 in all but one category: student services. While total expenditures increased 7.5 percent overall, expenditures on student services dropped four percent.
Such a decrease might be understandable if the college was in
dire financial straits. However, as the increased expenditureses
and robust $833.7 million endowment show, this is not the case.
So why is the College decreasing the funds allocated to student
services?
The Treasurer's Report states, "Although it has been tempting
over the past several years to spend more of the gains from the
endowment, we take seriously our fiduciary duty to both present
and future generations and have not felt that a 'new paradigm'
justifying a higher level of stock valuations has emerged in the
investment world."
While it is commendable that the College is concerned about
its future financial well-being, this does not justify the fact that
the College is ignoring the current generation of students. Dorms
are overcrowded, student groups have no offices or storage space
and the space and equipment they do have is old and decrepit.
Student concern over these issues has gone largely unanswered.
In the Nov. 20, 1998, edition of The Swarthmore Phoenix, students cited a student center as the most pressing need. Beyond
the student center, which stillremains at the bottom of the College's
long-range plans, student preferences coincided with those of the
Facilities Planning Sub-Group.
Even if the student center cost $3O million, a massive overestimate of the actual cost, and the funding came straight out ofthe
endowment, the College's finances could easily absorb the expense. In fact, assuming a real return of only ten percent, significantly less than real returns of the past 20 years, the College could
more than recover a $lOO million loss in two years.
While a $1 billion endowment is certainly impressive, a new
student center and increased student services would undoubtedly
be more appealing to both current and future students. If the College forgot about the ridiculous endowment war in which it is
currently engaged and began focusing on improving the average
Swarthmore student's experience here, Swarthmore as a whole
would improve immensely.
Yet a student center is only the most basic need. The College
should, at the very least, help support student activities by contributing a significant amount to the Student Activities Fund and
renovating existing student spaces.
Parrish Fifth, home to WSRN, The Swarthmore Phoenix and
12 other publications, has not seen significant renovations since
1964. All the equipment, including WSRN's Studio B, has been
paid for with student money, which is simply not sufficient to
provide the caliber of equipment needed to produce results comparable to colleges of Swarthmore's standing.
And after all, isn't that what this isall about? The College should
be helping students to achieve the best work and to have the best
college experience possible. Rather than sitting on the endowment, the College should actively seek out situations in which
money could make a difference and make them reality.

media cannot be overemphasized. As the NATO air campaign over Yugoslavia got underway, polls taken of the
American populace indicated
only a small percentage in favor
of the attacks. Since the bombing and the consequent Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, however, Americans
have been exposed to growing
accounts of atrocities and forced
expulsion. Reports of "genocide" and "ethnic cleansing"
have been used quite liberally
and are now taken as fact. Essentially, the American media
has taken sides in the conflict,
choosing to vilify the Serbs and
promote the interests of the
Kosovars. Their reporting has
had a noticeable impact on ordinary Americans: the latest
polls by The Washington Post
seemed to indicate over half of
those surveyed were in favor of
sending ground troops.
Alas, there is much evidence
to question the validity of the
media's reports. As Yugoslavia
has expelled those members of
the mediafrom NATO countries,
any reports of the situation in
Kosovo arrive from questionable sources, mainly the Albanian refugees. These people,
however, possess an understand-

able bias against the Serbs,
which would prompt wiser
heads torefrain from taking thenaccounts of the conflict at face
value, at least in the absence of
sufficient evidence. This has
sadly not been the case with the

horror in the
Balkans. A
closer look at
the situation
reveals enormous holes in the
media's reporting.
First of all, many of the Albanian refugees with tales of
atrocities were, under closer
scrutiny, forced to reveal that
their accounts really were just
tales. Apparently, many of those
so eager to speak with the press
did not actually witness the violence that they were describing
but "heard that was happening
from my uncle who heard it
from his friend in a village forty
miles away from mine." One
must also address the reported
executions by Serb troops of Albanian political leaders, some
of whom were specifically
named by the media. Well, the
accounts of their violent deaths
proved to be news to many of
the supposedly dead leaders
who, as it turns out, were alive
and well.

The list of the media's inaccuracies stretches on. There was
a report, for instance, that Albanian men were being separated
from their families and shot by
Serb police. And yet the media's
own pictures of the refugee columns clearly reveal many persons with the physiques, dress,
and facial hair to imply that they
are...yes, men! Such photos can
only imply two possibilities: that
Albanian women have rather unusual outer appearances; or that
the media was incorrect and
those are truly Albanian men in
the pictures.

Despite this point, I must be
fair—some Albanian men have
been separated from their families. Alas, while the media was
quick to point its fingers at Serb
authorities, there is new evidence to indicate that the men
were stopped and conscripted by
the Kosovar guerillas.
I make no effort to defend the
Serb government's crackdown.
Serb troops are expelling Albanians from Kosovo and are illegally confiscating property.
Yet there is a grave difference
between roughing someone up
and the bloody genocide that the
media has been claiming. Are
there atrocities taking place in
Kosovo? Most likely, but to
what extent we do not know and
have no way of finding out. In
the absence of this information,
we should guard ourselves from
wholeheartedly accepting the
accounts of a media whose reporting has been questionable at
best. After all, it isbetter to have
no information at all then to be
fed inaccuracies.
So, why has the media been
so biased in its coverage?
Money is always a factor. Let's
face it, some editors obviously
feel that words such as "genocide" generate greater mass interest than boring old "expulsion." Yellow journalism is
nothing new to this country and
precluded our entry into the
Spanish-American War. Furthermore, after the murderous
behavior of the Serb Army in
Bosnia, most people are all too
ready to label all Serbs as fanatically nationalistic killers.
Yet where we have the bad
guy, we also need the good guy,
a title that the media bestowed
upon the "freedom fighters" of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Yet, just what is the KLA? An
organization truly worthy of respect, or a terrorist group
founded on Marxist principles
that has funded itself through
drug trafficking? Not exactly a
fact that the media has
scrambled head over heels to
emphasize, is it?

Institutionalization ruins diversity
by Min Lee
Editorial Board Director

Several weeks ago the Dean's Advisory Committee (DAC) issued its report on the state of
diversity at Swarthmore, an initiative sparked
by the IC incident this fall.
Just like any bureaucratic document, the report contained the usual inflated language and
vague recommendations. But this report was esworrisome because it effectively emodies our common approach to diversity-related problems on campus, an approach that I
believe deserves serious reconsideration. That
approach, for lack of a better description, is institutional overkill.
The single dominating impression that one
comes away with after reading the report is this:
Swarthmore is a perpetual Diversity Machine.
The report documents at least a dozen committees, task forces and programs dedicated to the
promotion of diversity on campus. The problems commonly associated with decentralization aside, the sheer number of diversity-promoting institutions and their sometimes overlapping functions is downright confusing. If I
want to share an unpleasant classroom experience with the community, who should I turn
to? The Diversity Task Force? Or should I talk
to the Interculrural Education Team first? What
about the Diversity Coalition?
It's one thing if all these institutions and miniinsitutions were doing their job, but unfortu-

Eecially

nately they are not. The Diversity Machine is
at its peak, but the number of hate crimes has
stayed consistent, if not increased, and racial
tensions persist. But the proliferation of committees gives the illusion that the problem is
being tackled when in fact all we are doing is
churning out red tape by the ton.
To seek an institutional solution to the diversity issues we face is a natural response, especially in a higher education setting like ours.
But because of the unique nature and political
leanings of Swarthmore, this approach ultimately alienates the people it purports to engage, those who we label "bigots," "racists" or
"sexists."
Our campus is a predominantly liberal campus. Most of us, myself included, firmly believe
in the merits of diversity. But this political
makeup puts opponents of diversity in the minority. It is inherently conducive to "us vs.
them" adversarial relationships. Add to that the
massive mobilization of resources to convert
"them." What are the odds of a "bigot" speaking up at Swarthmore? What are the odds of a
"bigot" speaking up at Swarthmore with both a
Diversity Coalition AND a Diversity Task
Force?
Hence the "bigot" resorts to more abrasive
means of communication. And we respond to
vehemence with vehemence. The IC incident
is a case in point.

Student Council
rejects proposed
diploma change
To the Editor:
We recognize the Curriculum's Committee's desire to make every facet of Swarthmore's academic
program as inclusive as possible and appreciate the
chance to give our input into regarding possible
changes to the diploma.
After a great deal of deliberation, Student Council
has decided that we cannot sanction any changes to
the current language of the Swarthmore College diploma. Our most recent poll revealed a divided student population, with 236 students desiring a change
and 228 students opposed to one. Those desiring a
change were most divided on what changes they
wanted. Previous polls have shown forty to sixty percent of the student body to oppose any and all changes
to the diploma's language.
Unless the students have united in a clear mandate
for change, the College is obliged to abide by the
status quo. To do otherwise would dishonor the venerable Swarthmore practice of making community
decisions by community consensus, a practice we
have come to treasure.

four bucks —I agree that state-of-the-art microphones
and amplifiers are needed to hear him. Clinton forgot the lyrics to his trademark songs and so mumbled
through half an hour's worth of uninspiring, inaudible drivel.
My brother got the formidable crowd to chant
"Play Chocolate City!" We were only partly vindicated when a recording ofthe song sputtered through
the PA system because Clinton merely lip-synched a
few random lyrics. If my hometown of Kansas City
can't motivate Clinton and his entourage, what made
anyone think that the funk-illiterate bores of
Swarthmore could have done so?
Straining over the obnoxiously loud bass, with
which Clinton could not keep rhythm, I occasionally
discerned the word "funky." Yet Clinton's cracking
squawk of a chorus line could not have been more
antithetical to such an adjective. Let's face it, unlike
the geriatric spasms of the Rolling Stones or the interminable vivacity of James Brown, Clinton cannot
muster the vocal chords or the stage presence to pull
off a full-scale production.
What was once an eccentric vestige is now fitting:
Clinton should troll around in over-sized diapers. It
is unreasonable, however, for Swarthmore to coddle
his second infancy with our money.

Complaints about
Sharples unfounded
To the Editor

Hey, Waylon:
Where's the beef?
by Jonathan Shainin

Back Page Editor

It's been almost two weeks now since the
Swarthmore campus "experienced" Waylon, and I
suspect people are beginning to forget the glorious
five to ten minutes they spent inside ofLPAC scoffing before turning around and leaving. Apparently
everyone who put on the show and got paid for it
had a really fucking great time robbing us all blind,
but from what I can tell, just about everyone else
was more than a little underwhelmed. Not a single
person I've spoken to—and I've asked a lot of
people, not just fellow radio station employees or
interpretation theory majors—had anything good to
say at all about what one junior I spoke to called
"this tiny garage band's sad wet dream."
So let's go over what exactly was wrong with the
planning and execution of this ugly spectacle, and
why it should never happen again. It's not that the
Waylon experience was a lot of money, or that the
music was shit, but precisely that it was both at once.
It's difficult to debate these subjective matters of
taste (although opinion overwhelmingly seems to
side with my assessment), but the money question
is pretty black-and-white: a band ofWaylon's stature (that is, invisible) hardly deserves anything in
the neighborhood of $l6OO, their paycheck for the
evening, nor does their presence justify an extra
$7,000 expenditure on lighting and sound and some
half-assed "multimedia" presentation. We, the students of Swarthmore College, paid almost $lO,OOO
to see a second-rate, high-school Phish cover band
at the center of a costly and gaudy spectacle, no
less.
And while I'll admit that a lot of people came to
Waylon, "400 or 500," according to Nick Kourtides,
who helped plan the event—I'd venture all of those
people came and went pretty quickly, because over
the course of my stint enduring Waylon, there were
never more than about 75 people in the audience,
and I can't find anyone who says they were there
for more than 15 minutes of actual music.
A lot of money was spent, and a lot of people
showed up to see where the hell all the money went,
and a lot of people left pretty unhappy with what
they found. This, we see, is one way to create an
"event," but an important step was overlooked—the
actual attraction. Nobody went to see Waylon, we
all went to see our thousands of dollars and what
they became. Great sound and a light show mean
very little to the audience if not in the service of
music people are interested in hearing. By putting
the show in the LPAC, about the least fun place on
campus, the organizers eliminated any chance that
the crappy music would take a backseat to being
outside, having fun and eating hot dogs and drinking beer.
The way I see it, there are two alternatives to this
debacle—one larger and one smaller. Essentially,
to create an all-campus event, some attraction is
needed: a big name, music, food, drinks, fun, the
outdoors—preferably a combination of all of these
things. The essence of the "larger" alternative is a
big name—not George Clinton and 60-person-entourage-sized, exactly—but someone who you'd go
see just to go. Gettysburg College, which is smaller
and more remote man even Swarthmore, is getting
Busta Rhymes to come play this month. Now, I'm
not the biggest Busta fan in the world, but I'd certainly get off my ass and walk across campus to see
him perform, and so would you. I'd reckon Mr.
Rhymes or someone of his stature probably costs
upwards of $20,000, meaning a lot more than merely
student money would be necessary, but I think it's
about time a little more than student money went
into supporting cultural events at the college.
The 'smaller" alternative goes like this: we get a
number of bands less famous than Busta Rhymes
but more well-known (and better) than Waylon, and
they play outside one afternoon. Plentiful amounts
of barbecue and snacks and alcohol are made available. Fun ensues. This is the essence of the traditional Worthstock concert usually held at the end of
classes each spring. This year, WSRN and Olde Club
submitted such a proposal, but SAC chose to fund
Waylon instead, citing "a desire to break with tradition." Olde Club, without SAC funds, is still having
a big outdoor concert, which will take place this
Saturday, and which —all four bands and all the
sound and all the food included—is costing only
$2,000.

Charles Fischette's piece on Sharpies published in
the April 1st edition ofthe Phoenix should have been
printed along side the article announcing Jared
Solomon trouncing a young paraplegic boy in a game
of basketball. The difference, though, is that Mr.
Fishette's beratement of Sharpies claims to be based
in fact, when it was actually (like the Solomon piece)
based in fiction.
Since the beginning of the year, this Swarthmore
student has recognized a marked improvement in the
quality, diversity, and general appeal ofSharpies food.
After offering suggestions via a post board at the dining hall's entrance students have gotten everything
they've asked for except naked servers. This year
many students have been enjoying a wider variety of
food options at the grill, fewer fried foods, a varied
and more satisfying range ofchoices on the Vegetarian bar, lemonade, and in general a more positive
eating experience. Though we tend to criticize anything that isn't perfection (as in, there is always something that could be complained about) I can't help
but notice how many advances have been made in
food service this year. It is also clear that Sharpies
management is very committed to hearing and responding to student input.
As far as Mr. Fischette's complaints about the bowls
are concerned, all I can say is "home-training 101."
A bowl is not considered dirty when it has a permanent discoloration as do many of the bowls in
Sharpies. Many ofthe bowls in Sharpies have a brown
tinge as a result of long periods of use. They're not
dirty, just not white. Corn puffs in brown bowls taste
just like corn puffs in white bowls. If some of us really can't stand the thought of eating out of a bowl
that isn't (in our eyes) spotless, then I suggest we
seek out the new, recently purchased cream colored
bowls or sift through the others until we find one that
worty of being a temporary home for our edibles.
In response to the rest of Mr. Fischette's misinformed statemnets I would suggest that he join the
dining services committee. The dining services committee has unlimited membership and all interested
students should contact jloesell, mtrakiml, or
lmcdougl.
I suggest that Mr. Fischette take the time to communicate his grievances to the dining services committee. I take Mr. Fischette's dismissal of Sharpies
as "inconvenient" and "annoying" very seriously because I have gotten to know many of the truly fine
people who work in Sharpies. I respect them highly
for their character and for the enthusiasm they put
into their work. A tremendous amount of time and
effort go into "making Sharpies work." I can't help
but acknowledge how far Sharpies has come since
my first year here. Eventually, I hope that we (Mr.
Fischette included) will learn mat constructive criticism gets us much farther than mere complaining.
Sometimes, all you have to do is ask.

Campaign finance reform

GOP: Reform desired but
politically next to impossible
by Dave Thomas
Contributing Writer
It is clear that this country and this
electoral system need campaign finance reform. The people demand it
by an overwhelming margin, and politicians seem to agree. So, if everyone
agrees, why can't we get some campaign finance reform?
The answer to both this question and
many others brought up by a divided
government should be clear: because
no one can agree
on what isreform.
But before we try
to define reform,
let us first discuss
why lasting reform is next to impossible.
If you follow
politics, you will
notice that the minority party always calls for
campaign finance
reform. This is because incumbents are better able to
raise money than their challengers.
Thus, without reform, incumbents
have an excellent chance of re-election, and the majority party stays in
power longer. This was true in the 80s
when Republicans were in the minority, and it is still true now.
Then, when the minority party succeeds and gains the majority, it fights
reform of any type, because it wishes
to keep its advantage. So any legislation designed to reform the system
would be quickly amended into uselessness as soon as the majority
switched hands.
Now that we know why lasting reform is impossible, let's discuss why
it might not be such a great thing after
all. Let's first deal with the idea of issue advocacy. Under the McCainFeingold reform bill, there would be

strict limits on campaign spending on
specific issues around election time. Essentially, the government wanted to restrict the right of groups to advertise and
present theirideas and opinions in a public forum, a clear violation of First
Amendment rights. If left as such, any
reform legislation that passed would
likely be ruled unconstitutional.
However, if we still demand reform,
thereare two issues thatare central to any
such reform legislation. First, the legislation must set forth stricter penalties for
accepting contribufrom foreign
minority tions
nationals.
Recently, one of
Clinton's primary
fund raisers for his
1996 presidential
campaign was
charged with funneling more than
$300,000 into his
campaign from
one foreign inditvidual. As our recent problems
with China and national security secrets
prove, we must not allow foreign nationals to directly influence the election pro-

When the
party succeeds and
gains the majority,

any type, because it

advantage.

cess.

Second, workers in this country are
forced to contribute to campaigns without any choice in the matter. Unions subtract a portion of each paycheck to support different candidates, regardless of
whether or not the union members support that candidate. The secondkey point
to reform must be to extend the Paycheck Protection Act to political campaigns. People should not be forced to
contribute to a candidate whom they
would not support otherwise.
In conclusion, campaign finance reform is near impossible and not necessarily constitutional. But if it must occur,
it should be done with an eye toward protecting national security and preserving
the free choice of all those involved.

Contributing Writer
There can be little doubt that money
buys influence in Washington. Campaigns are becoming increasingly expensive, and only those candidates who can
raise large amounts of money are likely
to win office. By making large contributions to candidates, rich donors can provide money to ensure that candidates get
elected and then invoke past favors to
ensure that the donor's wishes weigh
heavily.
The influence of
the average American pales in comparison to that of
the rich elite. Campaign finance reform will distance
money from the
system, and candidates will have
more time to spend on the issues and with
the people they represent.
One argument against campaign finance reform isthat no matter how much
money a person spends on a campaign,
every person is still able to vote his conscience equally. In modem America this
logic falls down on several grounds.
First, if money does not buy influence,
then whyis it so importantfor people who
can to donate so much to political campaigns? And if money cannot win elections, then why do candidates work so
hard to raise so much money?
Second, in an age of low voter turnouts, the essential part ofwinning an election is to motivate people to come outto
vote. Only with large amounts ofmoney
can candidates buy the expensive TV
time and conduct other publicity measures to bring people to the polls.
Third,people are not likely to givehuge
sums of money unless they can expect
something in return, priority is given to
the donor's concerns.
Another argument against campaign

finance reform is that donating money
to a campaign is protected under free
speech. This argument is a perversion
of the First Amendment. Limiting campaign contributions would not deny the
rich the right to political expression,
but would simply give them a voice no
louder than anyone else's.
America needs campaign finance reform and we need it now. First, there
should be a cap on donations from any
source. Sen.Paul Wellstone of Minnesota accepts no donations over $lOOO
from organizations and none
over $5OO from
individuals. This
could be taken as
a national model.
Second, there
should be a ban
on "soft money,"
the unregulated
donations that are
made to party committees for issue ads
which are nothing more than thinly
veiled campaign ads.
Third, all political parties that registered more than a certain percentage of
the vote in the last election (say, 5%)
should be given equal amounts offree
air time and an equal amount of money
from the government to run their campaigns.
Qi the Senate floor last Sept., Sen.
Wellstone declared, "[The American
people] have reached the conclusion
that this political process isn't theirpolitical process. I mean, my God, what
happens in a representative democracy
when people reach the conclusion that
they are not stakeholders in the system,
that when it comes to their concerns
about themselves, about their families
and their communities, their concerns
are of little concern in the corridors of
power in Washington? What is at stake
is nothing less than our very noble, wonderful, 222-year experiment in self-rule
and representative democracy."

The influence of the
average American
pales in
comparison to the

rich elite.

College needs Ethnic GOP moderates powerful
Studies Concentration force in upcoming election

by Gloria Chan and JinFang "Jenny" Yang
Contributing Writers

Swarthmore College needs an
Ethnic Studies Concentration
because it would offer an analytical framework for understanding the increasingly
multicultural American society
and the movement of people
around the globe.
Earlier this semester, Advocating Diversity and a Variety of
Ideologies in a College Environment (ADVICE) hosted a
roundtable on ethnic studies.
About 30-40 students, faculty
and administration attended.
One week after this roundtable,
the Curricular Change Working
Group (CCWG), formerly
known as the Ethnic Studies
Working Group, was formed.
This group, which is composed
of students and faculty, includes
Professors Timothy Burke, Ken
Saragosa, Peter Schmidt, Sarah
Willie, Bruce Grant and James
Kurth. Their main goal is to learn
about ethnic studies and to see
if ethnic studies would be compatible with Swarthmore
College's academic programs.
Ethnic studies is not just the
study of oppression, nor is it
merely the study of specific racial or ethnic identities. It is a
lens through which one analyzes
the dynamic processes of social
movement and cultural change
with regard to issues ofrace and
ethnicity. Beyond simply examining the history and culture of
specific minority groups, ethnic
studies focuses on how the concept of ethnicity has changed.
For example, why are some
groups "ethnic" at a certain point
but "mainstream" at another?

How do groups become minorities? How are the processes of
becoming a minority different
and similar in various countries
and communities? What happens when cultures migrate, assimilate and are in opposition to
dominant cultures?
These questions are central to
understanding a highly globalized world. Ethnic studies is just
one of the ways in which higher
education institutions like
Swarthmore College can keep
pace with a quickly diversifying
America.
Diversifying the curriculum at
Swarthmore is an essential part
of this institution's commitment
to this project. This does not
have to entail a significant rechanneling of resources. The
College already has many professors and resources committed to this area of analysis.
For example, we can explore
the prospects for Swarthmore
professors to create new courses
that address the questions central to ethnic studies. Also, President Bloom has remarked that
the College can provide in-house
or outside grants as incentives
for Swarthmore professors to research new areas in their fields
for an Ethnic Studies program.
In the short term, students can
compile a list ofEthnic Studiestype courses at the Tri-Colleges
and University of Pennsylvania
for distribution and organize
Swarthmore professors to speak
on their ethnic studies work.
Given that faculty resources
already exist for an Ethnic Studies Concentration, consolidating
and focusing such resources will
provide our academic community with the attention that the
field of ethnic studies deserves.

With New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announcing
her candidacy for U.S. Senate
in 2000, the Republican Party
is hoping to have the edge in
this and other elections. The
GOP hopes to win because of
the plethora of
moderate candidates challenging the
hard-line ideology that has
dominated the
party in recent
elections.
Whitman's
announce-

ment received broad popular
support, as did previous announcements of Presidential
candidacy by moderates
George W. Bush and John
McCain.
Whitman is one of the most
moderate high-profile Republicans in the country because of
a single issue: abortion. It seems
these days that she stands nearly
alone in her party as a prochoice Republican, though she
is considered fiscally conservative. That is a winning combination for Republicans among
Americans at large, even
though the GOP itself rarely
supports it.
McCain's claim to moderation is campaign finance reform, an issue championed by
many Democrats but generally
dodged by Republicans. It is
amazing that so many Republicans are able to get away with
ignoring national calls for campaign finance reform, and it is
likely to be a point of vulnerability for Republicans in the
next elections. But McCain is

hardly vulnerable here: he coauthored the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance reform bill,
which was killed by the Republicans in the Senate last year.
As for Bush, few Americans
really know what he thinks. He
is beating Vice
President Gore
in early polls
for the 2000
Dan
White House
Korobkin
race, so he is
Phoenix
certainly
Columnist popular; but he
remains somewhat evasive
on many issues. When pressed, though,
Bush follows the political center as closely as possible, navigating just to the right ofPresident Clinton.
He identifies himself as prolife, for example, but opposes a
Constitutional amendment on
the issue and refuses to comment on whether his runningmate will necessarily be prolife. Bush has stated that sexual
orientation should not be a relevant factor in presidential appointments, referring to President Clinton's nomination of
JamesHormel as ambassador to
Luxembourg, which was
blocked by the Republican Senate leadership because Hormel
is gay. Bush also walks the center line on affirmative action,
denouncing quotas but promoting "affirmative access."
Do these tactics sound familiar? They should: they were
what brought Bill Clinton and
the "New Democrats" success
in 1992 and 1996. While
Clinton was criticized by diehard liberals as being too con.

ciliatory, often to the point of
being called a Republican, this
was the strategy that pulled in
the most votes from Americans
across the political spectrum.
Republicans know this strategy
works, and they are more desperate than ever to reshape their
image after conservative party
leaders brought President
Clinton to trial in the Senate.
But can they? The Republican Party leadership is solidly
conservative and less friendly
to politicians like Bush,
McCain and Whitman than are
American voters. And primaries tend to be dominated more
by hard-liners since only party
loyalists vote. As the chairman
of the New Jersey state Democratic Party was quoted in The
New York Times, "When
[Whitman] decides to marry up
to the Republican platform,
which is run by arch conservatives, she's going to be taking
money from folks whose philosophy is opposed to what her
personal beliefsare. That ought
to be interesting."
Bush is also having trouble
with conservatives in his party.
He recently met with Christian
Coalition leader Pat Robertson
but came away without anything close to an endorsement.
McCain, meanwhile, angered
many Republican leaders with
his vigorous support of campaign finance reform.
Time will tell if these candidates can gamer enough party
support to be serious contenders against Democrats in 2000.
If they can, their political moderation poses a serious threat to
the Democrats, heretofore
dominating the political center.

Movie references crucial to humor Worthless
The recent "Matrix" craze that has
permeated the campus has brought to
my knowledge a significant lack—that
of contemporary movie vernacular references.

A great deal of humor is to be found
in allusions; to bring
one to mind, I am reminded of the anecdote of, I believe, Winston Churchill, who
was presentat the banquet of a great prince.
All those around the
table stood and offered
praises to the prince.
The first man compared him to the sun, the second to the
moon. When Churchill stood, he said
that he could think of only one superlative toast over those that had gone before. So he said, 'To Your Highness,
Joshua." This is both clever and trumps
the other toasts because it refers to an
event with which the company would
have been familiar in an unfamiliar setting while at the same timerefers to the
prior toasts. Far be it from anyone to
compare "The Three Amigos" to the
book of Joshua, but the point is still
there.
What I'm saying is that movie references provide a touchstone for our
modern humor. Where we would once
quote the Bible or Shakespeare, for
good or evil wenow quote movies. And
I am sorry to say that too few of you
are getting my references.
So, as a service to you once you leave

this institution of movieless humor, I
am going to provide a list of several
movies that it will help if you have seen
before your unfortunate escape from
the matrix. And I'll not mention "Star
Wars"; no points for that.

Dan Aykroyd portrays a
loony Vietnam veteran assigned to
knock off Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason). His ridiculous voice alone is worth
a rental. Includes the immortal lines:

"Sorry I can't stay. I got a thing."
"Ghostbusters": I didn't see nearly

beat the quintessential 80's comedy—there's something just not right about
that. To sample an infinitesimal fraction of the available multi-purpose
lines: "So, she's a dog," "I think he can

How the Budget Breaks Down:
Presented here are the final Spring Budgeting allocations for 1999-2000. The committee allocated over $320,000.00, more than 86% of what
was requested of them. This is in excess of the estimated $310,000.00 in income for next year. SBC has yet to decide whether there will be
across the board cuts, or if they will pursue another course of action to make up the difference. Groups that are not listed did not submit a
budget for this year (unless there was a mistake). If budgeted from now on, it is likely that their funds will be cut in half, barring any
persuading mitigating circumstances. Ifanyone has any questions regarding a group’s budget or the budgeting process as a whole, they should
feel free to contact the SBC Office. All information is public and we are glad to answer any questions.

Where does
your money go?
Student Budget Committee
The Student Budget Committee is the fiscal arm of Student Council. The 10-person body, appointed by SC, has the responsibility of allocating and managing the $300,000.00 Student Activities
Fund. SBC meets once per week, at Sunday dinner in Sharpies 6. All meetings that concern budget
proposals are open to the public.
Only SAF-funded, SC-chartered student organizations may make proposals to SBC. If you are
interested in starting a new organization, you first need to contact SC Charter Chair Jared Solomon
'Ol. He will brief you on the chartering process and the requirements for consideration. If you are
already a SAF group and want to schedule a meeting with SBC, contact SBC Treasurer Joshua Bess
'OO, who coordinates the SBC meetings. The SBC Treasurer's Office can give you details on what to
include in your proposal and what types of questions the committee may ask. The office can be
reached at x8348 or <bctreasl>.

Who do I ask for funds?
1) Is it for a speaker? If no, go to 2. If yes, contact Forum for Free Speech (lan Huntington).
2) Is it for a publication? If no, go to 3. If yes, contact Forum for Free Press (Brendan Nyhan).
3) Is it for a party or other social event? If no, go to 4. If yes, contact SAC (Ansa Yiadom or Chris

Sajdera).

4) Are you an SC-chartered group that wants to do something not covered above? If no, go to 5. If
yes, contact the Student Budget Committee (Joshua Bess).
5) Are you not an SC-chartered group and would like to be chartered? If no, go to 6. If yes,

contact SC Chartering Committee (Jared Solomon).

6) Are you not an SC-chartered group and would still like money to do something that doesn't fall
into any of the above catagories. If yes, contact Joshua Bess anyway and he can point you in
the right direction.

S.A.C.
The Social Affairs Committee is an organization ofthe S warthmore College whose purpose is to allocate funds from the
SAP to students taking the initiative to provide activites and
entertainment to the campus. All funds allocated by the committee must be to campus-wide and free events designed for
the purpose of entertainment. The committee is composed of
twelve members all of whom must currently be students of
the college. Of these twelve members, ten are selected by
Student Council and two Co-Directors are hired by the Concessions Committee.
Proposal Review Criteria:
The following are the criteria by which party proposals will
be reviewed to determine the amount of funding that each
group will receive. Each proposal should inclulde an outline
of the event, an itemization of all expenses, and the date and
location (which should be reserved before allocation can be
given). Each proposal is critiqued by all SAC members unless there is a conflict ofinterest between a member and their
affiliation with a proposal, upon which the member will abstain from voting.

4) Is the proposal accompanied by a presentation? Presentations are not mandatory, but are encouraged.

5) Is the event original? Innovative events are strongly encouraged and looked forward to, although it is understood

that not every event will be so.
6) Does the event appeal to a large portion of the student
body?
7) How does the event compare, in terms of similarity, to
others occurring that day, night, weekend, etc.? Does the
event compliment any others that weekend?
8) Pending the funding of another event at the same time as
another, the flexibility of the second event to move to another night will be considered (The flexibility of an event
will also be considered upon the absence of an event on
either a Friday or Saturday).
9) Does the group have a BC budget and/or subcode for the
type of event in question? If this is so, have they contributed from this budget to the event or for past events?
10) Has the group sought additional sources of funding or is
SAC the determining factor of funding? (This usually applies to events requesting large sums of money.)

„

SAC only funds activites designed for the purpose of en-

tertainment, i.e. parties, band performances, open-mic nights,

poetry readings, etc., though there are exceptions. The committee does not provide funding for the following:

1) Receptions
2) Preformals, or other events on the night of a SAC formal.

3)Activities directlyrelated to religious ceremonies or events
which advance political ideologies. (However, all-Campus parties/socials hosted by religious or political groups
are an exception).
4) Advertisements
5) Cleaning Supplies
6) Deposits
7) Transportation Costs
8) The purchase of CD's, Records, Tapes, Grills, etc.

As you can see, the picture
that is often painted of Swarthmore by administration and
students alike —a tolerant, diverse, open-minded place
where things like this just
couldn't happen—is not an
accurate depiction. We cannot
continue to have the attitude
of naivete that I spoke of earlier. This campus is not an isolated Utopia that is immune
from the problems of the real
world, and it is not an ivory
tower where we can hide away
behind our books and our
equations and our theories. It
is impossible to ignore the
plain truth: that incidents like
these can and have happened
at Swarthmore on far too
many occasions. But the question I pose to you today is this:
will we continue, through our
apathy, blindness and failure
to take a stand, to allow these
things to happen at Swarthmore? Or, will we try to live
up to the vision of peace, tolerance and justice presented
by the Quaker founders? Because I am sure that it is not
an "Inner Light" that guides
the people who commit these
acts of hate, prejudice and ignorance.

Diversity Coalition promotes student dialogue

Contributing Writer

It's Sunday morning, 11:30.
The Diversity Coalition Steering Committee members
straggle into Sharpies 3 for
another week's meeting. In the
course of the meeting the
members discuss the upcoming Diversity Fair, delegates to
a conference at Wellesley, the
Free Speech Board, the screening of the rally documentary,
OURStory (the DC magazine),
Dialogues, preparations for
freshman orientation next year,
outreach to various parts of
campus, and our position towards a Multicultural Dean,
ethnic studies and a social justice requirement. Clearly the
Diversity Coalition (DC) takes
its commitment to building a
more diverse, accepting community very seriously.
DC, a member of ADVICE,
works to maintain ties with

groups

proactively reaching out to the
rest of campus and creating a
better environment for differing viewpoints.
At any given time this year,
the group has been juggling
many different projects. At all
times Dialogues, dorm-based
discussion groups about issues
of diversity and social justice,
is running. At the beginning of
the year, DC wrote and put on
a play for freshman orientation
and led diversity workshops
for all the dorms. Each semester, DC puts out OURStory, a
magazine with art, poetry and
prose about issues of identity
and diversity.
Diversity Coalition is a relatively young organization at
Swarthmore, started in the
spring of 1996. The group has
its origins in two different
projects whose coordinators
came together to form the organization which exists today.
In the fall of 1995, Rebecca
Bennet '96, along with other
student leaders, formed a

couple of discussion groups
which met weekly to talk about
issues of race and ethnicity.
They felt that no such forum
existed on campus and decided
to create this space themselves.
These groups were later
named Dialogues. That same
year, or perhaps the year before,
Hewlett Packard gave Swarthmore a grant to fund programs
which promoted discussion
about diversity. One of these
programs was the Multicultural
Winter Institute, an annual open
workshop that occurs at the end
of Winter Break.
After attending the Winter
Institute in 1995, Amy Albert
'9B, Maurisa Thompson '9B
and Erin Ruble '9B decided that
the type of dialogue that occurred at the workshop had to
continue. That spring, they
founded the publication
OURStory. It was soon decided
that some of the Hewlett Grant
money would fund both the discussion groups and OURStory,
and the projects would be the

responsibilities of a new group
called Diversity Umbrella. Diversity Umbrella was started as
a coalition of students from a
variety of backgrounds who
were interested in diversity issues on campus.
The organization was not
started as an "umbrella" group
for students, but as a group that
worked in conjunction with
support groups. After much
discussion, the students decided to form a steering committee which would meet
weekly. The larger group consisted of students who would
meet periodically at general
meetings or for committee
work on more political issues.
Diversity Umbrella did not
want to be overly political and
developed this structure to include those who were not interested in politics.
The members of the first
steering committee were Amy
Albert '9B, Anne Potter '99,
Eric Freedman '99, Miho
Tsujii '99 and Vincent Jones

'9B. Once the structure was all
figured out, the group began
expanding and working on
other projects for the 19961997 year. After the 1996Winter Institute, Albert, Freedman
and Tina Gourd '99 decided to
establish and plan the freshman
orientation workshops for the
1997-1998 year. The steering
committee also decided to plan
a conference for the spring of
1998 about diversity in small
liberal arts colleges. In the
1997-1998 school year, the
group worked on the faculty
diversity resolution, admissions policies, Dialogues discussion groups, planning for
1998 Freshman Orientation,
OURStory and hosted the Beyond the Box Conference in
February.
Last spring, when the
Hewlett grant ran out, Diversity Umbrella changed its
name to Diversity Coalition,
started being funded by Student Council and became a
chartered campus group.

Minority specs visit Swat
by Tanya Wansom,

Staff Writers
Swarthmore welcomed "students of color" along with
other members of the 2003
class for its pre-frosh weekend
last Friday. As part of the
school's commitment to diversity, students ofcolor were invited to come early.
There is controversy as to
whether having a particular
students of color program for
the weekend promotes collectivism or reinforces separatism. Over the course of the
weekend, approximately 300
admitted high school seniors
were on campus. Numerous
events were planned by the
Admissions Office and the
support groups HOLA, SQU,
SAO, SASS, and SOCA to
show the pre-frosh what Swarthmore is all about.
Beginning with the SOCA
Party held in Upper Tarble Friday night, the parties continued on Saturday with a DJ
Party sponsored by SASS,
SAO and HOLA and a Swing
Party held at the same time.
More events were held during
the day on Saturday to occupy
the pre-frosh, and these included a barbecue/field day on
Parrish Beach with a Latin
band, a screening of the IC
rally documentary, an African
Cultural and Fashion Show,
and a coffeehouse/open mike
event sponsored by SQU.

On Sunday and Monday,
pre-frosh participated in panels and discussions to introduce them to faculty and students. They also attended various classes on Monday across
campus. This year, the
Capstone Student-Faculty
Panel was entitled, "The
Meaning of Life and Other
Simple Questions." Other information sessions and tours
were held throughout the
weekend to give specs a picture of life at Swartnmore. Different organizations showcased their clubs in an activities fair held on Sunday night
in Parrish.
Did pre-frosh feel that this

particular students of color
program promotes a feeling of
separatism at the school? Some
argue it does because many
support groups such as HOLA,
SQU, SASS, SAO, and SOCA
sponsored diversity-specific
activities.
For one prospective student,
it was not a matter of dividing
students of color from the rest
of the class or within specific
cultural groups. It was more
about having fun: "I wasn't
expecting to have any fun this
weekend, because I really
bought into the myth that
Swatties study all the timeand
have no social life. However,
the SOCA party Friday night
totally dispelled that myth, and
I actually had a really good
time."

Earlier this semester, Advocating Diversity and a Variety
of Ideologies in a College Environment (ADVICE) hosted a
roundtable on Ethnic Studies.
About 30-40 students, faculty
and administration attended.
Within those two hours, students attempted to define Ethnic Studies. One week after
this roundtable, the Curricular
Change Working Group
(CCWG), formerly known as
the Ethnic Studies Working
Group, was formed. This
group is composed of students
and faculty members including
Timothy Burke, Ken Saragosa,
Peter Schmidt, Sarah Willie,
Bruce Grant and James Kurth.
the main goal is to learn about
Ethnic Studies, and to see if
Ethnic Studies would be compatible with Swarthmore
College's academic programs.
A general history of Ethnic
Studies begins in the 1960s and
1970s movements at San Francisco State University and University of California at Berkeley. The movements were in
direct opposition to traditional
academia. Primarily, Ethnic
Studies began with studying
and comparing the history and
status of a variety of peoples,
especially ofpeoples who have
been and are now still
marginalized. Ethnic Studies

seeks to rewrite history, tell
untold stories as well as provide new critical ways of seeing the world. The CCWG
does not intend Ethnic Studies
to be a study of oppression or
the study of specific racial or
ethnic identities.
Through conversations with
faculty members, the CCWG
has learned that, like any field,
Ethnic Studies organizes the
world in its own way. This
field is organized through asking questions, such as:
How is a group ethnicized?
How are people minoritized?
How are ethnicizing and
minoritizing processes different
and similar in various countries
and communities? (The United
States versus Latin America or
France, for example)
What happens when cultures
migrate, assimilate and are in
opposition to dominant cultures?
There is more to Ethnic Studies than diversifying the curriculum. Ethnic Studies wants
to understand the increasingly
With
globalized world.
America's diversification, the
CCWG is trying to get the institutions ofhigher education to
commit to the multicultural
project. The group believes diversifying the curriculum at
Swarthmore is an essential part
of this institution's commitment
to this project. To this end the
CCWG is pursuing a number of
possibilities for increasing Ethnic Studies opportunities..

SLAG highlights failings of College staffing
by Meredith Hegg
Contributing Writer
Since the open meeting of
the Long Range Planning Subgroup on Staffing last May,
College staff have a stronger
voice in some areas of College
policy but other recommendations remain virtually untouched.
Earlier this semester, the Student Labor Action Group highlighted six oftheserecommendations on a chart in front of
the Admissions Office. "The
purpose ofthe board is to alert
the college community to the
concerns staffraised at the end
of last year and the
administration's response or
non-response," said SLAG
member Janice Gallagher '99.
The key topics of concern
were the creation of a new
grievance procedure, the creation of a consistent policy for
review of staff compensation,
the adoption of a voluntary affirmative action policy, the creation of a representative body
for staff to communicate with
administration and increasing
the availability of opportunities
for job training and continued
education.
Currently, the only completed element of the SLAG
display is the formation ofthe
StaffAdvisory Council (SAC)
as a representative body for
staff. Members are elected
from each of the nine circles
of staff on campus. This body
currently meets once a month
for 90 minutes, although special meetings can be called.

The groupreviews issues such
as the grievance procedure and
communicates staff opinions to
the President and other senior
officials.
Progress on other elements
is extremely varied. One element on the College's "wish
list" for the capital campaign
is a $5 million endowment to
finance more aggressive recruiting of staff of color, and
greater education and job training opportunities for staff. A
survey of staff priorities conducted this year found that
training and education opportunities were a serious concern
for most staff, and that current
opportunities were inadequate.
The nature of these programs
has not been determined; however the Equal Opportunity
Committee has discussed the
possibility of writing an affirmative action policy.
The Office for Community
Learning and the Department
of Human Resources are currently co-sponsoring a program called Learning for Life,
where interested staff can be
matched up with student, faculty, or staff mentors. Co-coordinator Susie Ansell 'O2 said
the program had suffered from
"lack of participation on the
students' part" this semester,
but she has high hopes for success and renewed strength next
semester.
Staffcompensation was also
a subject ofconcern. According
to Paul Aslanian, VicePresident
for Finance and Planning, the
College has a commitment to
pay approximately 102.5 per-

cent of the average faculty sal$20,000, and 7.5% for all income beyond that. This was

ever since. One change in the
procedure allows staff to go to
either Human Resources or the
Equal Opportunity officer with
their complaint.
Since Human Resources is
responsible for hiring staff, the
old process, which called for
staff to report to HR, led to a
potential conflict of interest.
The new procedure also includes mediation as a possible
solution for grievances. Finally, the procedure also allows
complainants to have a "campus support person" accompany them through the process.
Kalwaic says the length of
the document (9 pages) and its
awkward wording are still
troubling barriers. "No one
given 45 minutes could understand all the details." She is
also concerned that the Equal
Opportunity officer would not
be required to maintain complete confidentiality. While
some discussion of the situation with involved parties
would be necessary, Kalwaic
believes no information should
be shared without the
complainant's permission.
A procedure written by Ad
Hoc, an informal committee of
concerned staff, was submitted
to HR and was not used. SLAG
member Eric Freedman '99
emphasized, "Staffneed to be
involved in actually drafting
the procedure." He added that
this was not an isolated problem. "Until there's some kind
of means to ensure that staff
concerns are heard, I am not
terribly optimistic that these
demands will be met."

In the vast morass of Hollywood crap,
once in a while something both great and

"The Matrix."
By the time you read this, it should be
old news. But since this is the paper of

I've got to talk about it, if only for posterity.

Contributing Writer

Russian conductor makes his
debut with Orchestra,

Debussy and Bartok
Valery Gergiev, director
of the Mariinsky Theatre in
St. Petersburg, made his debut with the Philadelphia
Orchestra on the weekend
of March 27th. He conducted "Le Chant du
rossignol" and "Symphony
in Three Movements," by
Stravinsky, Debussy's "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un
faune," and Bartok's Suite
from "The Miraculous
Mandarin."
Principal
Conductor
of
the
Rotterdam
Philharmonic and
Principal
Guest Conductor of
the Metropolitan Opera, Gergiev's recordings include a large
body of operas and orchestral works by composers
such as Rachmaninoff,
Shostakovich, Borodin,
Tchaikovsky, and Verdi. He
has appeared with nearly
every major orchestra and
conducts the Kirov Opera
on a regular basis.
Stravinksy began work
on "Le Chant du rossignol"
or "The Song of the Nightingale" in 1908. Distracted
by commissions for major
ballets such as "Firebird,"
"Petrushka," and "The Rite
of Spring," "which would
thrust him into fame, he resumed work on this piece
in 1913, with a very different composing style than
when he had started five
years earlier.
Based on the Hans Christian Anderson story, "The
Chinese Emperor's Nightingale," this orchestral
nearly-turned-opera
ollows a theme of an enchanted bird singing to a
Chinese Emperor. Solos by
flutes, bells, violins, and
trumpets mimic the sound
of this nightingale.
The piece begins with a
series of rapid exchanges
between the strings, woodwinds and harps. The tempo
slows and the whimsical air

one with beautifully rampant pentatonics, with an

in the strings bear resemblances to the ballets completed during the period in

because of the dress of the

Beulah
When Your Heartstrings Break
Sugar Free Records
This is really awesome electronic, organic, human pop.
Beulah (BYOU-la) is sometimes
raucous, sometimes smooth, and
always exciting. There are too
many instruments used on this
record to name (there's even a
french horn!) but the core band
members are Miles Kurosky,
Steve La Follette, Pat Noel, Steve
St. Cin, and Bill Swan, some of
whom are, I think, former members of Elephant Six. It's kind
of unclear how all the instruments are used, because the music is usually pretty unitary, big
chords of beautiful noise shifting
around with the energy of a kindergarten class. Some tracks on
this album are just incredible.
"Emma Blowgun's Last Stand"
begins with a tabla and then proceeds into a long drone with this
great electronic sound that seems
to thunder on every register at
once, rumbling deep and buzzing
high. Then the brass section
pipes up, and it's perfect, ecstatic, energetic beauty for the
next three minutes. How can you
not love a bunch of music kids
who tug you just the right way at
every turn? It's too bad the ride
is really short; the album is just
over half an hour long.

Gale Wind Transistor
Hit or Miss

On first listen, a lot ofthe work
on this album (from ex-Explod-

ing Kind member Adam Bayer
and his new friend Maria
Pitallano) is nice but not very
interesting.
It's kind of
minimalist duo-guitar pop, traditional indie sounds stripped
down to the brisk, quiet essentials. There's enough energy to
keep a steady beat; it is, in fact,
unnervingly steady. That's
where the energy ends. The singing is apathetic, and there are
only about two or three repeated
lyrics per song. In "Radio Argo,"
they sing, "Radio Argo, Radio
Argo, Radio Argo, ergo I go radio," several times. There are a
few extra words thrown in, but
basically that's the song.
With more consideration, this
music becomes more interesting
and cool on a couple of different
levels. First, as in just about any
understated work, there's an expanded opportunity to consider
the core qualities of the genre,
sing-song pop in this case. There
are only a few elements to it, and
they are totally nude here. The
guitar, the past and future star of
rock and roll, opens itself up here
for really close examination. It's
gurgly, it's straight, it carries, and
it's like a choir of human voices.

Mark my words: "The Matrix" will go
down in history as revolutionary cinema,
an intense molding of genres that transformed the way we look at the big screen.
Though the film, written and directed by
the Wachowski brothers, ultimately lacks
the recipe for a true masterpiece, it nonetheless succeeds as an awesome visual
experience.
In his most convincing role to date,
Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas Anderson (a.k.a. Neo), a part-time computer
hacker and
sci-fi protagonist
extraordinaire who has a sixth sense that
his world, a current day Orwellian megalopolis, is a little out of whack and that
the Matrix has something to do with it.
Neo is soon contacted by Morpheus
(Laurence Fishburne), the enigmatic and
criminal leader of an underground cult
that knows what the Matrix is. In the
form of tacky little red and blue Nyquil
pills, Morpheus confronts Neo with the

choice to either swallow and awake with
full knowledge of the Matrix or to swallow and awake a naive, tortured, futureless corporate drone. Venture a guess as
to which route Neo takes.
Discovering the true nature of the
Matrix, and watching this well-crafted
sci-fi world unfold, is halfthe fun of the
movie. The otherhalfis watching Keanu
Reeves kick cyborg
and human ass with
equal verve. Admittedly, the scenes in
between fighting
can easily turn
schmaltzy, lame, or
both. The dialogue
equal
is also lacking in I
places, though it occasionally rewards with some sci-fi wit.
And unfortunately, the ending is a vapid
shootout; even "Speed" had more creativity than that.
But "The Matrix" flourishes despite its
sappy plot, spots of lame dialogue, and
ultra-annoying character names simply

because it gives the moviegoer one hell
of a visual ride. Never before have there
been such technologically dazzling fight
scenes; slow-motion, fast-forward, cutouts, sharp camera angles, and the special effect of freezing a frame and changing the viewpoint (like in the Gap Swing
commercial), are all combined
seamlessly. The result is a bombardment
'
of stunning visual
sequences that will
have you reeling
and eagerly awaiting the next eyebattle
popping
scene.
For some, "The
Matrix" can be a
very easy movie to
dislike; it is a premise and a style of cinema ripe for catastrophe. But for most, this
movie simply rocks. In taking special effects ingenuity to the next level, "The Matrix" has created what is perhaps the most
seamless visual tour-de-force since the
days of "Star Wars" and "2001."

As if sci-fi wasn't already a guy

plot and throws in a whole lot of overt
testosterone, like Keanu Reeves. Don't
get the wrong impression, though: so

In this 1997 release, John Hurt
plays Giles De'Ath, an English
novelist and widower who has a
general distaste for things modern.
Imagine his surprise, then, when
after actually going to the movies he
becomes obsessed with Ronnie
Bostock (Jason Priestley), the film's
young star. After much research and
obsessing, De'Ath travels to Long
Island to confront Priestly and
express his tender admiration. "Love
and Death" has been hailed as a
delightful comedy and an intriguing
character study, with an especially
strong performance by Hurt. Most of
all, it is a movie that even your
parents can enjoy.

Woody Harrelson busts a move as
a Billy, a white basketball hustler

Antz opened to critical and popular acclaim last fall but was overshadowed in the long run by "A
Bug's Life." This animated tale stars
(the voice of) Woody Allen as a
worker-ant striving for individuality.
His adventures in the ant kingdom
involve falling in love the princess of
the ant colony, played by Sharon
Stone, making social inroads, and
ultimately saving his peers from a
treacherous ant-coup. Unlike most of
Woody Allen's work, this film
appeals to a wider audience that
includes adults and kids. The result
is a delightful work that is a must-

who himself gets hustled by his
partner Sidney (Wesley Snipes).
Billy's problems are compounded by
infamous L.A. gangsters who pursue
him over a bad debt and relationship
problems with his Latino girlfriend,
played by Rosie Perez. This movie is
perhaps more memorable for its
attitude and catchy title than for any
mark of fine filmmaking. Nonetheless, it is pretty standard popular
film material, and if you haven't
seen it, then give it a shot.

Biology Prof. Hiebert
fiddles for contra dance
by Jennifer Tyson
Contributing Writer

Contra dance is an experience that can't properly be

described in words alone.

The origins of contra dance
lie in centuries past,when the
first English settlers brought
contra dance to the New
World when they arrived in
New England, and yet now
contra dance is an experience
that is"American as apple pie."
Consisting of simple figures done with a smooth
walking step, contra dancing
welcomes beginners and experienced dancers alike.
There are no worries about
remembering figures, either,
because the dance is first
walked through, then called
as you dance. The calling becomes part of the music, a
singing rhythm that is juxtaposed against the tunes. Contra dancing is energetic, fastpaced, flirtatious, and completely gender-neutral so
you'll probably end up dancing with everyone by the time
the evening is over.
The best instrument to
match the fast-moving vigor
of the dance is probably the
fiddle, and one of the best
contra dance fiddlers, Dr.
Sara Hiebert, is found right

ment.

With her father an artist
and her mother a musician,
Hiebert took to music and art
as easily as she did to breathing. Born and raised until the
age of seven in Switzerland,
Hiebert gained her love of
nature early on, spending
much of her time outdoors
with her parents. When it
came time to chose a career
she created a life that included both nature and music.
Like many classical violinists, Hiebert began playing at
a young age, when she was
in the fourth grade. She
played virtually all through
college until, one day, it
wasn't really fun any more.
So into the closet the violin
went, for seven years.
It was while doing graduate school research in biology that a friend told Hiebert
that she should go to a folk
festival called Fiddletunes in
Washington state. She went
and loved what she heard.
Hiebert admitted, "I loved
what I was hearing, but it
took a lot of letting go of
fixed ideas" before she could
begin to play again. With a lot
of hard work Hiebert went
from being an "incredibly
shy" performer to a contra
dance fiddler known across
the country.

Today Hiebert plays for
dances on both coasts, although she prefers the West
Coast. "Seattle is my other
home," says Hiebert. The
other two members of her
band live on the West Coast,
and Hiebert typically spends
all summer in Seattle. In addition Hiebert visits the West
Coast somewhere between
once and three times during
the year.
For Hiebert, music is about
life. "As long as your music
has life, it doesn't matter" if
it's note-perfect. "It's all
about swing and lilt and making the music move," she
says, leaning forward eagerly, blond hair swinging in
her face. "There's an energy
between dancers and players.... It's about lifting dancers' feet off the ground." You
can see that energy in
Hiebert's movements; like
her fiddling idols, Kevin
Burke, Ruthie Dornfield,
Martin Hayes, and Liz
Carroll, she's full of bounce
and spring.
There will be a contra
dance, sponsored by the Folk
Dance Club, on Wednesday,
April 21st, 7-10 p.m. in Upper Tarble.

and Stallone scenes with few
laughs.
Great action, amazing visual
effects, a kick-ass concept
you can't help but love "The
Matrix." If you haven't seen it
at least twice, you're studying
way too much. Trust me, this
is one you'll be talking about
in ten years and be pissed if
you missed.
"Futurama."
OK, so far this is no
"Simpsons" (using that word
to refer to when "The
Simpsons" was good, of
course, not its current pathetic
incarnation). But in only three
episodes it has gone past where
"The Simpsons" was in its first
year and has all the potential
to be a new "Simpsons" for an
age when the show with that
moniker has lost its sense of
satire and character.
Like "The Simpsons,"
"Futurama" has at its center a
working-class everyman trying
to cope with an absurd world.
In this case, his name is Fry
and the world truly is absurd;
it's 2999 and everybody travels by pneumatic tube, the
moon has become an amusement park, and the severed
heads of famous historical figures like Leonard Nimoy and
Richard Nixon are kept in a
museum. It's kind of like
"Blade Runner" meets "Monty
Python."
Also like "The Simpsons,"
the first character to stand out
is not our hero, but a sidekick.
For the former it was Bart and
for "Futurama" it's Bender,
Fry's roommate and best friend
who is an alcoholic robot prone
to lapses in what we in 1999
would consider public morality. The funniest segment so far
was in the second episode and
involved Bender's bedding the
robot daughters of a moon
farmer, one of whom is a monster truck.
Most ofthe other supporting
characters are underdeveloped
still, most notably Fry's
cycloptic boss (voiced by
Peggy Segal of "Married with
Children"), but they look
promising and could easily
form the basis of a Simpsonian
universe ofamusing personalities. Given the future setting
and Fry's job as a delivery boy
(the same job he escaped in
1999), there really is no limit
to what the writers under Matt
Groening's guidance can come
up with. If they show even half
as much imagination and originality as the "Simpsons" writers ten years ago, I think this
could be the prime-time satire
for the first decade of the
twenty-first century.
"Futurama" airs Tuesdays at
8:30 on Fox 29, right after
"King ofthe Hill." Watch them
both from 8-9 if you only take
one hour a week to watch TV.
No other hour compares.

A Certain Hostility

Hidden Agenda/Parasol

Synth-pop forever! Featuring Hewson Chen and Joshua
Klein of Aden, this CD can
make your day. Nothing new
here. It's in the direct tradition of twenty different bands
(ten of them with Stephen
Merritt in the lineup) that feature fine, fine synths and
chimy sounds, sedate singing
and romantic savvy. Take
your crush on a car ride with
this in the deck, and by the
time you hit the first Wa-Wa
you'll be an item. You can't
resist someone who's got
these smooth tones and that
deep, crooning voice jiggling
the speakers. It's heartbreaking, emotionless, sultry, and
beautiful, like post-breakup
sex or the swamp of despair
in The Neverending Story.
The fact that the sound is inherited does nothing to diminish this record's genuine
appeal. It certainly deserves

Ultimate team witnessed the
impossible. Playing in the annual Haverford Pigout Layout
tournament, Swarthmore
sophomore Matt Murphy not
only brought in eleven points,
one assist, five defensive
blocks, and twenty-three completed backhands, but he
pulled off a play so rare and
infamous it is only known as
"The Play."
Down 0-1 in the second
game of the day, Murphy
ripped a throw from about halffield. Rising quickly, the
frisbee teased the sideline as it
made its way down the field.
As he entered the end zone

Murphy sprinted several yards
beneath the frisbee and
watched the frisbee float out of
his reach and away from the
field. It seemed that following
the frisbee would only have
taken him out of bounds and
made scoring impossible.
Matt Murphy, acting purely
on instinct and adrenaline,
planted his right foot just
within the sideline of the end
zone and leaped out of bounds
towards the disk. Catching it
with his right hand, while in the
air and completely horizontal,
he gracefully tossed the frisbee
over his left shoulder back towards the endzone. Not only
did Murphy successfully throw
the disk in the complete opposite direction of his body's

movement, he threw it directly

into the hands of Matt
Coddington '99. In a
maneuver,
Jordanesque
Murphy did what many an Ul- player has contemplate d
but very few have ever pulled
off, let alone for a score.
The Swarming Earthworms
went on to win the game, eventually closing the day with
three victories and one loss,
followed by an early elimination on Sunday. The Earthworms UPA ranking went
from 102, before the tournament, to 89 this week. The
team,

the
Warmothers, went 3-3 winning, one and losing one on
Sunday. Both teams are heading to Yale Cup on April 9.

Men's lacrosse disappointed as record falls
to 2-8 overall, 0-2 in Centennial Conference
by Anne Frankenfield

Staff Writer

Swarthmore men's lacrosse
suffered defeats in all ofits past
three games. On April 3 men's
lacrosse dropped its first Conference match up against Western Maryland. Swarthmore acquired the lead on a goal by
Blake Atkins 'O2 with 2:46 left
in the fourth quarter, but the
Green Terror quickly countered, evening the score and
sending the game into overtime. Despite the Garnet's effort, Western Maryland scored
the winning goal with just 1:10
left in OT. Mark Dingfield 'Ol
was the Garnet's leading scorer
with five goals, while Atkins
'O2 added three. Darren Wood
'Ol and Mike Lloyd 'Ol each
contributed with one goal.
Goalkeeper Sid Rydquist 'OO
played a stellar game with 23
saves.

The following weekend the
Garnet traveled to West Point
fora non-conference match-up
against Bates College, only to
suffer a crushing 14-4 defeat.
Dingfield, Atkins, Adam
Dickinson 'OO and Coby
Smith 'O2 each contributed a
goal. Rydquist finished the
game with 15 saves and Pat
Murray 'OO added five more
saves.

This past Wednesday the
Garnet lost its second Conference game with a 19-6 loss
against Franklin and Marshall
College. Swat was down only
7-6 at the half but could not
seem to find its offensive
groove and went scoreless for
the last two quarters. Dingfield
and Atkins led Swarthmore's
scoring with two goals each,
while Dickinson and Joel Weber 'Ol each added one.

Leading season scorers for
Swarthmore are Dingfield (26
goals and 16 assists), Atkins

Lloyd (12 goals and 15 assists),

and Dickinson (17 goals and 8

Women's lacrosse plagued by injury,
suffers four losses in two weeks

Women regain confidence after defeating Muhlenberg 15-11

by Sari Altschuler

Staff Writer

The past few games were
difficult for the women's
lacrosse team. Beginning
with the Dickinson game on
April 3, the team suffered a
series of losses to Ursinus,
College of New Jersey and
Gettysburg, mostly teams
with superior records. Swat
women are on the upswing, however, as evidenced by their win in their
most recent game against
Muhlenberg on Tuesday.
Though Swarthmore is still
plagued by injury, the rest
of the season looks promising for the Garnet.
The Dickinson game was
the most disappointing of
the four difficult games.
Individuals performed well,
but the team failed to play
well as a unit. Ursinus was
equally
disappointing,
though Katie Harper 'O2,
Mavis Biss 'O2, Erika Williams 'Ol and Holly Baker

'99 each contributed goals
in the 17-5 loss.
The College of New Jersey game, however, represented what the team hopes
to be a real turning point in
the season. Swarthmore
competed against TCNJ,
the No.l Division 111 school
in the nation, on Princeton
University's home field for
a night game. Swarthmore
coaches and players alike
were excited by the challenge and saw it as an opportunity to practice their
skills against a formidable
opponent. With much of the
pressure of victory removed,
Swarthmore
stepped up their play, playing with more unity than
the team had seen in a few
games, although the game
ended in a 19-3 loss. The
defense, especially Sarah
Singleton '99, Jen Hagan
'99, Kristen English 'Ol
and Kim Cariello 'O2
played outstandingly well,
and the entire team returned

home pleased with their effort.
The team's next game
against Gettysburg showcased continued strong play
by the Swarthmore squad.
The women fought hard
against their opponent with
Holly Baker '99 scoring
four goals, Katie Tarr 'O2
and Alicia Googins 'OO
contributing two each and
Katie Harper 'O2 with another.
Unfortunately,
Gettysburg pulled off a 169 victory over the Garnet.
Instead of being disappointed by its losses to
Gettysburg and the College
of New Jersey, both impressive opponents, the squad
optimistically viewed the
matchups as opportunities
to display their skills and
practice new strategies of
play.
The Garnet pulled off an
important victory against
Muhlenberg this Tuesday
on the Mules' home turf
under the lights. After a

close first half, Swarthmore
was able to pull off a 15-11
victory through consistently strong play and good
teamwork by all field players. As illustrated by this
last game, the team has begun to show a level of skill
which is a dramatic improvement from the previous week's play.
Defense has been the key
to the Swarthmore squad in
its past few matchups. The
entire defensive end has
performed excellently, receiving high praise from
coaches and spectators.
Notable defensive play has
been
demonstrated
bySingleton, Hagan, Becca
Stites 'OO, English, Tarr,
Cariello
and
Amy
Dißenedetto 'O2.
Swarthmore's overall
record is now 5-5, 2-3 in the
conference. The next home
game is against Western
Maryland at 1:00 p.m. on
Saturday April 24.

game will be at 1:30 p.m. on
Saturday, April 24, on Clothier

against rival Haverford is scheduled for Saturday, May 1,away

Mook was serving for the
match when he suffered a bad

After the win over Rochester the team only had two days

Thomas both jumped out to
big leads in their doubles
matches, but the Lions began
to battle back. Everyone real-

doubles point, however, and
hung on; Schilla and Emkey
won 8-6, and Mook and Thomas took their match in a tie
breaker. Slimack was overpowered at N0.2 singles and
both Emkey and Schilla lost
their first sets, making the
match look extremely close.

Women's rugby defeats
two Division One teams
by Cathy Vaughn
and Nancy Craig
Contributing Writers
Halfway through the season,

Swarthmore women's rugby fi-

nally hit its stride and rucked over
two Division 1 teams in two
weeks.
On April 3 Swarthmore played
a home game against Franklin and
Marshall and defeated them easily 30-0.
Swarthmore lost captain Sarah
Cross '99 early in the first half
when she was forced to leave the
game because of a recurring knee
injury. Back captain Meghan
Brennan 'OO scored twice before
she too had to leave the field because of repercussions from a
previous head injury.
Despite losing both captains
and missing their inside center
Laura Blume 'Ol, Swarthmore
dominated throughout the game.
Lisa Jenkins 'O2 shined as an inside during her A-side debut by
managing to catch consistently.
Swarthmore's balanced scoring in
the second half was evidence that
F&M was clearly outmatched
both in terms of both strength and
speed. The tries scored by forwards Nancy Craig 'Ol and
Meredith Hegg 'OO were matched
by those of backs Noelle Goodin
'OO and Danielle D'Olivera 'OO.
Swarthmore's B-side also dem-

onstrated their athletic prowess.
Craig scored off a penalty play
and shortly thereafter pulled the
ball out of the scrum and passed
it off to Goodin, who ran around
F&M's poorly positioned backs
into the try zone.
Last Saturday Swat women
played excellently again, crushing
Millersville 19-5. The backs were
in particularly fine form, looping
around Millersville throughout
the game and scoring all three of
Swarthmore's tries. D'Olivera
scored early in the game, putting
the ball down within the first
minute. Blume followed suit and
put the ball down in the center of
the try zone early in the game in
addition to setting up Craig to
make the conversion.
Although Millersville was able
to push down field into the
tryzone, Swarthmore was undaunted. Craig was able to make
another conversion off a try,
scored by Cathy Vaughan 'Ol in
her first game as A-side fly-half
in the second half of the game.
Though neither Swarthmore nor
Millersville put many new players in their B-side game,
Swarthmore's endurance allowed
them to play through and keep its
advantage to win 15-0. Flyhalf
Goodin scored off a pass from the
scrum half and Erica Anderson
'Ol, in her new position as a forward, also scored.

The men's tennis team solidified its hold on the number two
regional ranking in their last
three matches. The team suffered a setback against Williams
College but regained composure
and fought off improved teams
fromRochester and The College
of New Jersey.
When Williams came to town
two weeks ago the team had
hopes for an upset, but the preseason N0.2 Ephs did not take
the match for granted and
outmatched the Garnet. Williams took all three doubles
matches and clearly had the
momentum going into the
singles. Jon Temin 'OO, John
Thomas 'O2, and Dennis Mook
'Ol all went to three sets, but
after Williams clinched the
match with wins at No.l, N0.2
and N0.3 singles, none were
able to finish offtheir opponents.
After a week of tough practicing the team had an opportunity for redemption. Rochester was ranked N0.6 in the region and looking for an upset,
so no one was expecting an
easy match. Emkey and
Schilla led the way with an 80 win at No. 1 doubles, and the
teams of Temin and Scott
Grant 'Ol and Mook and Thomas soon followed with wins
of their own to sweep the
doubles. Thomas and Schilla
won their matches quickly to
give the Garnet a 3-0 lead, but
then the matches soon developed into a series of dead

As has become their hallmark, the club displayed
mental intensity and a command of the net which have
taken the young team further than they expected just
a few months ago.
LaSalle proved no match
for the Garnet last Thursday
as strong serves and blocking combined with aggressive defense and consistent
sets carried Swarthmore to
a 3-0 victory, 15-8, 15-10,
15-7. Outside hitter R.J.

itters needed it. Outside
hitter Charlie Ellis 'OO

Dzevad Sukilovic '99 and
middle blockers Imran
Posner '99 and Ben Fritz
'99 took advantage to
pound kill after kill onto the
LaSalle side of the court.
Saturday proved a more disappointing day as Swat took
off to an early lead with a 158 win in the first set against
TCNJ but quickly fell apart
against the quicker and more
focused opposition. The front
line, led by Berger, Fritz,
Posner and Sukilovic, scored
numerous blocks but in the end
proved too slow for the constant chutes run by TCNJ. The
Garnet defense also proved
unable to keep the ball in center court for Nathan to set,
which prevented Swat's powerful hitters from getting solid
hands on many balls. After a
hard fought second set in
which Swarthmore fell 15-8,
the club lost focus and lost 153, 15-3 in the third and fourth
sets.
The men's volleyball team
has two remaining games in
the regular season against
Philadelphia College ofBible
and West Chester, after which
they will hopefully advance
to conference championships
next week.
