Staff informally polled on wage
BY DEIRDRE CONNER

One employee's effort to

"So I asked Michelle if

he said.
Hartel was convinced
that the generalization was
not true, but she wanted

devised an informal survey

"I'm certainly in favor of

though I don't think it

"If you could actually

On March 30 the committee sent an e-mail to

she had printed the e-mail

said, the Dining Services

well attended.
When it comes to eliciting further response from
the staff, "I don't know what
more we can do," she said.
One of the biggest questions in the minds of
Dining Services workers
has been where the funding
for the proposal would
come from, Grady and
Dining Services employee
Andre Singleton said.
"I think that is really
very confusing to everyone," Grady said, especially
because the funding question has not yet been
answered.
Singleton, who supports
the $10.72 proposal, said not
knowing where the funding
for raising the minimum
wage would come from
made him wonder if a higher wage might mean fewer
jobs.
"If there's no money to
give, I think there's the
likelihood there could be
cuts from somewhere and
people might be affected. I'd
rather have a bird in the
hand than two in the bushes," he said.
In its report, the committee said it was important the college take steps
to prevent this.
"To a large extent, we
have to count on the college's goodwill that barring
financial emergency, job
reduction, should it occur,
will be driven by changes
in college needs rather than
efforts to save money," the
report said.
In a way, Hartel said,
she thinks all the recent
focus on having discussions
and emphasis on potential
improvements to the benefits system are just ways to
skirt the wage issue.
"They'll negotiate anychild care or whatthing
just not to give you
ever
that money," she said. "Just

The college will examine the legality of funding for closed groups, such as the
Swarthmore Asian Organization, above, this summer.

Closed support group
funding under review
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Student Council has decided to postpone discussion on whether closed support
groups should continue receiving Student
Budget Committee funding for closed
events. The council believes further debate
should wait until after the college reviews
the legality of closed groups this summer.
In a recent report, Sharmaine LaMar,
the college's equal opportunity officer,
said the college had begun a review
process to examine programs that might
be affected by the Michigan decision,
according
to Associate
Dean
of
MulticulturalAffairs Darryl Smaw.

Last June, the Supreme Court ruled
University of Michigan undergraduate admissions policy of awarding
points to applicants belonging to certain
minority groups was an unconstitutional
quota system. This decision forced many

that the

schools to consider whether their own policies were in keeping with the decision.
Swarthmore groups are funded by the
Student Budget Committee, which oversees a common account paid for by the

student activities fee.
Student Council has been debating the
fairness of allocating student activities
fund money to events only some attend.
But "there is no reason for us to consider
making any major changes until we see the
result of the college review this summer,"
Student Council Co-President Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 said. "Depending on the
results, the changes might be done for us."
Despite the postponement, funding for
closed support groups remains a heated
issue. Many members of closed groups
believe closed events play an essential role.
"Social events are crucial to SASS' ability to perform its primary goal of supporting students through creating a community on campus," Swarthmore AfroAmerican Students' Society member
Rajaa Shakir 'O4 said.
Closed support groups provide many

2004

students with a necessary safe space,
according to Shakir. She said the presenpe
of these support networks actually benefit
all students, since they often help minority students to participate more fully in
campus life.
"I think there is a benefit to having
socially and emotionally healthy black
students on campus," she said.
Council
Student
Student
Life
Representive Wee Chua 'O6 said he believed
institutionalized support groups were not
necessary and could actually result in a
perpetuation of poor racial integration on
campus.
"People are going to support each other
based on their needs and based on their
common ground without the school taking
the initiative of having these groups," he
said.
Chua said he understood the importance of recognizing racial diversity and

expressing cultural pride but believed
hosting closed events was not the most
effective way of doing this. "The culture
you come from is very important, and you
need to celebrate that culture," Chua said.
"But this doesn't mean you need a closed
group. It's better to be a group that is more
accessible to the student body."
It is this lack of openness that has Chua
most concerned. He argued that groups
chartered by the council and SBC-funded
events needed to be accessible. "A student
can choose to not go to an event, but the
option to go should still be there," he said.
For now, closed support groups will
continue to receive funding. The committee did propose one bylaw change April 6
that will be put to a vote at the next council meeting. The bylaw would only affect
open support groups that apply for closedevent funding. SBC wants to clarify an
existing rule to specify that only closed
groups can apply for closed-event funding.
In the past, Deshi, an open support
group for Asian students, has received
closed-event funding. If the new bylaw
passed, this will not continue.

Alumna urges students to engage in politics

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangjel@swarthmore.edu
Mattie Weiss 'Ol believes politics should be fun. In fact,
she thinks putting "the joy back in politics" may be the only
way to beat incumbent George W. Bush in November.
Weiss, who addressed approximately 100 students on
Tuesday night, is the Midwest regional coordinator for the
League of Independent Voters, also known as the League of
Pissed-Off Voters.
Weiss also wrote a chapter in "How to Get Stupid White
Men Out of Office," a book that profiles 22 young people
across the country who have been elected into office.

"I think a lot of people at Swarthmore feel guilty about privilege. They
shouldn't maybe it's not a good
thing but while you have it, you
should use it and own it."
Mattie Weiss 'Ol
The league's primary goal is to get Bush out of office , but
"our more long-term goal is to make the Democratic party
more progressive and create more room for progressive politics," Weiss said.
Weiss spent most of her lecture detailing the strategies of
the League of Pissed-Off Voters. The League will focus on 11
swing states and plans to bring more young people, ethnic
minorities and immigrants into electoral politics.
"We don't have a lot of money," Weiss said, "so we have to
use what we do have
social networks, talent, commit-

ment."

A lot of people are turned away from politics because "so
many activists are people who believe the world is going to
come to an end," Weiss said. "They have some reasons to feel
that way, but terror and desperation doesn't inspire everyone. We have to make it about things people want to be part
of. At a recent book release, we had hip-hop, dancing and

drinking."
Weiss also organized a talent show in her hometown of
Minneapolis, in which high school students performed
skits about why they hated Bush. Her high school classmate, actor Josh Hartnett, judged the acts. The League's

Web site, www.indyvoter.org, promotes activities such as
asking a cute nonvoter out for a Valentine's Day drink.
The presentation, entitled "Why You and Your Friends
Are America's Best Hope to Save Politics in the 21st

Century," was at many points more of a rally than a lecture.
"Who knows someone in Iraq? Who knows someone who
recently has had a paycheck cut? Who knows a women who
might, at some point in her life, need an abortion? Who's
pissed off?" Weiss asked until the majority of the audience
had their hands in the air.
She gave Swarthmore students guidelines on how to get
organized to make a difference in the 2004 election and
passed out surveys to collect contact information. After
the lecture, Weiss's book was available on sale.
"It was cool to have a Swattie back here who is doing
stuff on national level," Aaron Strong 'O6 said. "She seemed
really down to earth. She didn't seem full of herself, either."
Strong brought voter regristration forms to Weiss' presentation on behalf of the fledging Swarthmore Voter
Registration Coalition.
The coalition plans to work to register voters in Chester
and at Swarthmore.
Strong is in charge of the "Every Student Votes" campaign, which hopes to get every eligible Swarthmore student to vote. "Twelve-hundred to 1,300 votes in a swing
state is significant," said Strong, who would also like to try
to help non-citizens register.
"Everything is focused on people who are citizens. We
have over 100 students who are not citizens; they are foreign students. It would be a great exercise to truly have
every student vote, to learn about absentee ballots and
electoral systems in other countries to make sure they are
able to vote in their own country," Strong said.
Emily Wistar 'O6 said she "liked what she was talking
about in terms of the joy of politics. Getting people excited
is the important point."
Nate Wessler 'O4, who booked Weiss, said there was "a
very impressive turnout for a rainy Tuesday night. I'm
psyched she gave us concrete ways for college students to
get involved. It clearly shows it is time to get our noses out
of McCabe and into the ballot booth."

Wesslerknew Weiss from when she was a senior and he

a first-year.

"I worked with her a lot on the living wage campaign. I
was very impressed by her energy and her skill as an
organizer," he said.
Weiss was a political science major at Swarthmore. "I
liked activists but hung out with other people," Weiss said.
In addition to working with the living wage campaign and
trying to improve racial politics on campus, Mattie was in
Grapevine and played soccer.
After graduating, Mattie worked as a labor union
organizer for half a year. After that, she worked for a
research center based in Oakland, Calif, studying immigration policy and youth activism around the country.

Block applications are down for the fall

Dozens
of students crowded
around the housing board Monday at
noon, eager to find out whether they

had received a block or would have

to enter the housing lottery next

Neema Patel 'O7, who received a
popular doubles block in the new
dorm, said she was "really, really
excited about living in the new dorm.
I realize that we are very lucky."
Patel's individual housing number
was 967, and her block's average was
880.5. Patel was attracted to the new
dorm because of "the fact that it was
new. The location also helped."
Myrt Westphal said the block
applications were fairly consistent
with past trends. "The total number of

applications was

Students applied for 123 blocks and

class now has their room set for next

together because of the trend to go
away during junior year' and the
need to cover the occupancy of the
block for the entire year," Westphal

said.
Of the 61 awarded blocks, 31 stu-

dents got their first choice.
Westphal received 24 applications

for six Wharton blocks, the most popular first choice.
"Wharton blocks remain very popular, and juniors shouldn't even try to
get one of them, at least as far as history from the past couple of years
demonstrates," Westphal said.
Other popular dorms included the
two new dorm singles and doubles
blocks, which received 15 and 13

applications respectively.

said Paksoy, who plans to room with

"There is some confusion about

"Your cohort number doesn't indicate

Mattie Weiss encouraged students to get involved in
electoral politics.

"I think a lot of people at Swarthmore feel guilty about
privilege. They shouldn't. Maybe it's not a good thing, but
while you have it, you should use it and own it. Get speakers to come to campus, take a semester off to work on the
election, or do an independent study with a professor.
Also, use your privilege as a young person in America.

Kevin Lull 'O6 underwent reconstructive surgery
on his forehead and jaw yesterday to repair fractures sustained in a car accident April 8.
"That's good news, because they were waiting

"He's doing unbelievably well for just two weeks

"He's making a remarkable recovery, and his family

and he wrote "I love you, Mom" with a heart.
He is able to breathe on his own but is usually

Perennial Adirondacks return with spring
BY MEGO LIEN
mlienl@swarthmore.edu

They have endured pranks and vandalism and fire. After a winter's
hiatus, the college's iconic Adirondack chairs are back on Parrish beach
to welcome the spring.
"It's nice to be able to sit there on a sunny day," said George Hang 'O7,
who described himself as "one of the more compulsive users" of the
chairs. "I read or just sit there and relax," he said. "They're awesome."
Adirondack chairs date back to 1903, when a man named Thomas Lee
"wanted a truly comfortable lawn chair to furnish his summer home" in
upstate New York, according to adirondackchairs.com.
After nailing boards together and testing prototypes, Lee produced
the Adirondack chair, which was made out of a single pine plank and featured wide armrests and a sloping seat. The chairs originally sold for $4,
but they can cost up to $1,250 today.
In their 20-plus years on Parrish beach, the chairs have inspired trickery and art. During one April Fools' prank in the 1980s, someone hung all
the Adirondack chairs on trees around campus, economics professor Larry
Westphal remembered.'The pranks got to being pretty devilish," he said.
Jake Beckman 'O4 said he had heard stories of students in the late 1970s
who positioned the Adirondack chairs in various ways, from up in the
trees on Christmas morning to one hodgepodge pile in the middle of the
lawn.
The chairs inspired Beckman during an art project in the spring of 2002.
A giant version of the Adirondack chair, scaled 2.6 times larger than the
original, became part of his series of "fun outdoor sculptures," he said.
Beckman created his chair out of large pieces of cut plywood.
Today, when Beckman spots children and Swarthmore students
sprawled on his creation, he feels the reward of his creative efforts. It's
wonderful to watch as "people put their own meaning" to his ever-changing piece of public art, Beckman said. The chair will stay here after he
graduates.
It seems that, pre-Adirondacks, the campus was not quite what it is
today. "We didn't have Adirondack chairs in the '7os," political science
professor Richard Valelly '75 said. "We didn't have much of anything. It

was an incredibly low-key campus."
Other than "the usual Senior Week vandalism," Valelly recalled "two
things" during his time at Swarthmore: a Roxy concert his junior year
and a Bruce Springsteen concert in the amphitheater his senior year.'
"Other than that was work, work, work with a little bit of ping-pong
and foosball and Frisbee thrown in
and no Adirondack chairs," he said.
For the amount of enjoyment they offer to students and outsiders
alike
"visitors love the idea of having them out on the front lawn,"
Director of Grounds Jeff Jabco said
the chairs require little maintenance. They are stored underneath the bleachers in the athletic field in
the winter, protected from the elements.
In the spring, they reappear on Parrish Beach and are pressure-

The Adirondack chairs, which have been part of Swarthmore for over

20

years, are back for the spring.

washed and re-painted in time for Commencement in May. As pieces
break, campus carpenters replace them, Jabco said.
Jabco estimated that, each year, six to eight chairs are vandalized
when students jump, stand or lean on the arms and legs. Several chairs
mysteriously disappear every year, and are only replaced when the
budget allows, Jabco said.
The Scott Arboretum is organizing a "dedicated Adirondack chair
program," where friends or alumni can donate money for chairs in their
names, Jabco said. The program is expected to begin this summer.
Rumor has it that the college had 40 Adirondack chairs until the 1982
fire, which also burned down most of Tarble, destroyed almost half of
them, but Jabco could not confirm or deny the claim.
Today, about 25 chairs remain. "They're the focal point on the Beach,"
Beckman said. "It's a good gathering place."

"It's understood that [the fund] shouldn't be used on a regular basis," Hungerford
said.

The reason SBC will no longer receive
funding from the discretionary fund "is not
because the president has withdrawn his
support," Hungerford said. The decision to
stop financial support did "absolutely not"
Bloom,
come from President Al
Hungerford said.
Next year, SBC will fund club sports
alone because "we're in better financial

now and we can handle

it,"

The committee has a capital replacement fund with which to replace computer
equipment and vans. Within this fund,
there is a buffer used to pay for unexpected
contigencies. This year, because SBC did
not have to replenish the buffer fund, it can
fund club sports, Traczynski said.
But SBC will put a freeze on funding for
coaches' salaries, according to Alberti. "We
have put a cap on all the coaches' salaries,"
he said, so that clubs will not receive an
increase in funding for the salaries. Club
sports will receive approximately the same
amount of funding as last year, he said.
Members of club sports teams do not seem
too concerned about the changes in funding.
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, captain of the
men's rugby team, said it was a good thing

April 15, 2004

that club sports funding was "moving away
from emergency sources," like the discretionary fund.

"It's going to give us a chance to press
again for institutional financial support for
club sports," he said, citing the Dean's
Office or the athletics department as possi-

ble sources for permanent financial support. As for funding for next year, Rodriguez
said that he was "not so concerned."
Marie Laurenza 'O6, treasurer of the

women's ultimate Frisbee team, said her
team had not received its budget for next
year yet but that, "in the past, we've always
gotten full funding. Usually [SBC is] pretty
good about it, but we'll see."
SBC member Elizabeth Vogel 'O7 said
the loss of money from the presidential discretionary fund did not affect SBC funding
decisions for other groups.

Mark Hanis 'O5 and Abena Mainoo 'O6 organized Genocide Awareness Month to educate students on genocide and
to help its victims.

Ten years after Rwanda, Swat
promotes genocide awareness
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

"Silence is Complicity" and "Never Forget" are among
the chalkings scattered around campus for Genocide
Awareness Month.
Mark Hanis 'O5 and Abena Mainoo 'O6 organized the
event "to promote awareness of genocide and show the
campus community it doesn't just affect faraway places
but our everyday lives as well,"Mainoo said.
"Genocide Awareness Month is about understanding
the implications of our actions and inactions. It is not
about feeling sad and frustrated about past atrocities but

responsible and optimistic," Hanis said.
The month is "multi-faceted," according to Hanis, and
features a variety of events including lectures, student
talks, panels, film showings, a teach-in and an art exhibit.
It will focus on genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia as well

as the Holocaust.
Hanis said the initial planning stemmed from realization that this April marked the 10th anniversary of genocide in Rwanda. Several events were planned on campus to
commemorate the anniversary, such as the screening of
the PBS special, "Frontline: Ghosts of Rwanda," and a talk
by Jospeh Seberenzi, the former speaker of the Rwandan
House of Parliament.
The turnout for both events was good, according to
Mainoo. "The Scheuer Room was packed" for Seberenzi's
speech, she added.
Upon contacting several student groups and departments about these events and receiving a lot of support,
the month "seemed to have grown from there" and more
events were added, Mainoo said.
"The great part about the whole thing is so many
groups, students and individuals have joined in," Hanis
said. These groups include the Swarthmore chapter of
Amnesty
International,
the Swarthmore Asian
Organization, Ruach, the International Club and many
others, according to Mainoo.
In addition to raising awareness of genocide, the organizers also hope to "provide initial venues for constructive
action," according to Hanis. One way is through the sale of
black ribbons for $1 on Fridays during lunch in Sharpies
to benefit the Victims' Trust Fund. The fund is set up by

6

the International Criminal Court and seeks to help victims
of genocide.
"The money will go directly to victims of genocide,
crimes against humanity and war crimes and their families. It may also be paid to international and non-governmental organizations for projects, such as rehabilitation
projects, that will directly help victims of these crimes and
their families," Hanis said in an e-mail.
According to Mainoo, about $l3O has been made so far
by the sale of these ribbons, and they will continue to be
sold for the rest of April.
Another way the students are taking direct action is

through a letter-writing campaign, which is sponsored by
Amnesty International and will be held in Paces April 19.
Through this event, students will write to politicians to
show support for the International Criminal Court and "to

inform our national leaders that we care about international justice and retribution for victims of atrocities,"
according to Hanis. This will also include writing letters
about Sudan, where ethnic cleansing is taking place.
One of the next events for the month is the observation
of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which will include a vigil
and a 24-hour reading of the names of Holocaust victims in

front of Parrish this Saturday and Sunday.
Organizer Susan Roth 'O4 said Holocaust Remembrance
Day events were usually held every year, though she was
"excited about it being during Genocide Awareness
Month."
In addition to the vigil and name reading, the symbols
of oppression that the Nazis made Jews, homosexuals, disabled people, political dissidents and other oppressed
groups wear will be passed out during the vigil and at
brunch on Sunday for students to wear, according to Roth.
"I'm really excited about this
I think it's really
important to educate about it. I'm hoping it can be really
powerful
those symbols have an oomph that ribbons do
not," she said.
Events will continue throughout the month, and the
organizers hope Genocide Awareness month will continue
after this year, according to Mainoo.

(U-WIRE) NEW YORK
Just months after
Columbia University severed its contractwith clothing
manufacturer Lands' End, the brand has pledged to
make up for some of the labor law violations that lost
it Columbia's business.
Columbia ended Land's End's contract as a licensee
of the university in response to charges of blacklisting
in its El Salvador supplier factory, as well as a serious
breech the company's contract with Columbia.
Providing $53,000 in machinery and materials as
well as 100 hours of expert advice, Lands' End will help
the first union-friendly factory in the history of El
Salvador's export apparel industry get off the ground.
The new factory "Just Garments," which will
employ many of the workers who were illegally blacklisted by Lands' End's former supplier, Primo S.A. de
C.V., is the first in the history of the export apparel
industry in El Salvador to sign a contract with a union.
The victory for El Salvadoran labor, negotiated
through the Workers Rights Consortium and the Fair
Labor Association, is also a victory for the* Columbia
chapter of SEEJ, Students for Environmental and
Economic Justice.
For SEEJ member Nate Treadwell, who first asked
the university to consider terminating its contract
with Lands' End, the successful resolution came surprisingly quickly. "I expected the workers would win
the dispute; I didn't expect that it would be done with a
relatively small amount of fuss," he said. "Not after

two contracts!"
Another contract severed in response to the workers rights violations was with the University of
Michigan. Neither action individually was financially
damaging for Lands' End—in Columbia's case, Lands'
End produced no apparel at all, but was merely listed
as a licensee through LRG, the university's licensing

agent.
Even if the contract had been financially meaningful, most of Lands' End's sales are not from its collegiate apparel market.
When Columbia cut its contract with Lands' End,
the issue began to get international press in textile
magazines. "Once that sort of coverage starts to leak
into the mainstream media they have to think about
the sales that they'll be losing in other sectors,"
Treadwell said.
A bad name is singularly damning for a company
like Lands' End, Treadwell believes, because "they subcontract everything. They don't produce anything
except an image. A logo. A brand. We make their brand
look bad, and they know they're going to lose money,
because that's the only thing they make."
Seizing upon this advantage, SEEJ is currently asking the University Senate to demand that its licensees
disclose the wages of their employees. "We feel
Columbia could take a lead on that," Treadwell said,
pointing out that Indiana University and Michigan
have already done the same. "Columbia is in a good
position because it gets the attention of other schools,"

he said.

Two years ago, Columbia joined the Workers Rights
Consortium, a non-profit that works to assist in the
enforcement of manufacturing Codes of Conduct
adopted by colleges and universities. The Consortium
is composed of college and university administrations,

Stress services may expand
BY TERESA KELLEY
tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu
As finals draw closer, stress has become a part of
life, and colleges are trying ways to help their students cope.
At Washington University in St. Louis, students
relax in established stress-free zones and play with

puppies. Harvard offers graduate students training
in combating perfectionism, The New York Times
reported

this month.

At Swarthmore, students may relieve stress with
a massage at Worth Health Center from masseuse
Barbara McGee for $4O an hour or $25 for half an
hour.
McGee has been on staff since October 2003,
according to Director of Worth Health Center Linda
Echols. She holds hours on Tuesdays and Fridays
and typically has seven appointments per week.

"I think the best form of
stress relief is talking with
friends commiserating with
them because everyone
is in the same boat."
Matthew Tom 'O7
Lifestyle Counselor Mari Clements, a trained
nutritionist, and acupressure therapist Jin Shin Do
work with students with 'acute medical stress issues."
Students must have a medical referral to be treated by Clements. Clements has worked at Worth for
about 10 years, and demand for her services has
remained relatively stable over the years, according
to Echols.
"I'm a limited resource," Clements said. On average, she provides 12 hours a week to students. Echols
estimated that around 10 to 15 students come in for
massages, acupressure therapy or nutritional advice
every week.
During the beginning of the semester and exam
times, student demand for these services is lowest,
according to Echols. She said that students have no
time to de-stress during the end-of-semester crunch.
"Folks seem to need those hours to get their work

done," Echols said.
Echols said many stress-relief responsibilities
had shifted to the dorm residential life program
through activities like RAs leading study breaks.
Kelly Wilcox '97, women's field hockey coach and
a member of the Wellness Committee, said she
believed stress management was a very individualized process. "We don't want one blanket solution,"
Wilcox said.
According to Wilcox, while Swarthmore offers a
lot for students who need to deal with stress, not
everyone takes advantage of the services.

"I regret that I didn't take advantage of my surroundings when I was here," Wilcox said. Methods
of stress relief can be highly physical, such as hitting
a punching bag for 20 minutes, or they can be relaxing, like a walk through the Crum, she said.
Wilcox is looking to expand class offerings in the
physical education department.
These classes can be a valuable stress release,
since they require thinking and using one's body in
non-academic ways. According to Wilcox, personalized stress release is a "life skill students should
graduate with along with analytical and academic
skills."

Echols is also hoping to start a new program to
train students in massage technique, giving them "a
packet of skills to make them useful," offering their
services to fellow students.
Echols would like to be able to compensate students for providing this service, although currently
Worth does not have a budget to do so.
Last semester, Nick Martin 'O4 and Nicole
Adelman 'O5 organized two massage workshops, one

on traditional Swedish massage and the other on
acupressure technique. According to Martin, over
200 students wanted to participate.
"Few things are as relaxing [as] getting a massage
and I can say with some degree of certainty that
massage done well can change your life," Martin
said in an e-mail.
"I am trying to get something together, either a
workshop or a massage night/study break with a
professional, sometime during reading week. My
other thought is to do a massage night during Senior
Week for interested seniors, but by then there won't
be as much stress," Martin said.
Psychological Services is also available for students, with office hours Monday through Friday, 8:30
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., in addition to after-hours emergency appointments.
Psychological Services has a staff of 10 and provides over 100 hours of counseling per week with up
to five hours a week of individual consultation time,
according the 2002-03 annual report.
During the last academic year, Psychological
Services saw a total of 242 students, or 16 percent of
the average enrollment for that year. Of the 2003
graduating seniors, 126 students, or 35 percent of the
class, used Psychological Services at some point during their Swarthmore career, according to the
report.
Additionally, Psychological Services is involved
in training for Student Academic Mentors and RAs
to further reach out to the student body.
Some students prefer a less formal way to cope
with stress.
"Generally, the stress level is what you make it,
although professors can assign ludicrous amounts of
readings and ridiculously long problem sets, allowing little time for students to have fun," Matthew
Tom 'O7 said. "I think the best form of stress relief is
commiserating with them
talking with friends
because everyone is in the same boat."

April showers bring delays
The rainy weather of the last two weeks has hindered the
progress of the new dorm construction, Director of Facilities
Management Stu Hain said.
"[The weather's] certainly slowing us down, but I don't think
it's going to delay the end date" of Aug. 27, Hain said.
In order to finish on time, additional workers and hours may
have to be added. "We've already added some days and will
have to add more," Hain said. This will add the cost of paying
workers overtime, but the project has a "built-in contigency
and we're still in that," Hain said.
"If the weather persists, there is a possibility that we will
not make it... I hate to think of that possibility, but it exists,"
Hain said. Right now, "we have to count on everything happening just right" for the construction to be completed in time, he
said. "It's a very hard thing to predict... but, we believe from a
lot of experience that we can [finish in time], and we're still
going to try."

What I was wearing when I was in Drama Club
I joined Drama Club during my freshman year of high
school because Sean Boda was in Drama Club, and I hadn't
figured out yet that all the other girls in Drama Club had
joined for the same, hopeless reason. Sean, a senior and
the heartthrob friend of my best friend's brother (and
homecoming king!) recommended that the whole Drama
Club take a trip to the Ohio Renaissance Festival, whereat
we flirted mildly and he commented that the snood I was
contemplating buying was "cute." For those who are fortunate enough not to know what a snood is, it is a medievallooking hairnet you pin onto your hair and let your long,
golden locks flow into prettily a la Rapunzel. This began
my "wench" phase, as I built entire medieval-inspired outskirts
and
blouses
with
long
fits
of
romantic/hideously puffy sleeves around the snood, the

one item of clothing I knew Sean liked. Sean also liked
Lilli
boys, so my entire wardrobe was, alack, for naught.
Just like that Savage Garden song can instantly bring
back the furtive gropings of the seventh-grade sockhop, the
clothes we wear or wore have a nostalgic power.
Somewhere in a St. Paul closet, there is a pair of black
Pleather pants that will bring back the day Annie got her
nose pierced, and the snood sits in a drawer as a memento
of Lilli's dramatic past. An outfit is as good as a photograph of the naive or creative or enthusiastic people we
have been in the past. If life has a soundtrack, it can have
a wardrobe. That's why it can be fun to look back at what
you were wearing when, and to save those items of clothing and appreciate the nostalgic or story-telling value of
vintage stuff. Even if a piece of clothing might not evoke
your proudest moments, happily, time heals all wounds.

Annie has exorcised her demons, Lilli has developed better
gaydar, and, for the Swatties we interviewed, any embarrassing memories have receded into amused affection for
the people they were. Judge not, lest ye be exposed as the
owner of several mini-backpacks.

What I was wearing at my babysitter's house
It was early elementary school, somewhere between
second and fourth grade, and I basically wore these MC
Hammer pants all the time. I would go to my babysitter's
house after school, and I remember being at her house and
telling her all about my pants. I think I said that they were
good pants because MC Hammer wore them and he could
dance really well. I probably tried to dance, but it didn't

What I was wearing while blending in with the natives
I don't know if I should say this in The Phoenix, but oh
well. Well, a few years ago, I went for a trip to Brazil, and
the friend I went with was very anxious that we wouldn't
look like tourists, because she was afraid that we would get
robbed. So, she made sure that I dressed Brazilian, even on
you know
the beach, which meant
one of those very
small, Speedo-type bathing suits. That was definitely a
memorable outfit. Andrew Ward, psychology professor

What I was wearing when I was in junior high
I was really into JNCOs [those really baggy skater
pants]. The best style, I thought at the time, was the
"colossal" model of JNCOs each model had a "J" on it,
and this one was the one with the hook on the "J" curled
around, like, five times, and it was on the back pocket. I
made my mom hem them for me. I don't know how she
felt about that; she was pretty progressive.
Ben Ewen-Campen 'O6
What I was wearing when I left junior high
To my eighth-grade graduation, I wore this black dress
with a black slinky layer underneath and a black gauzy
layer on top. It was the shortest dress my mom had ever
let me buy, and there was this black-and-white butterfly
attached to one of the straps, because that was really popular then. The spots on the butterfly were white stars. I
just remember looking around at graduation and not listening to anything that people were saying because I just
kept thinking about how sexy I looked. Then I wore that
to our eighth-grade graduation dance, and that was the
first time that I ever grinded with a boy, and I remember
thinking that the dress was a direct cause of that wonderful event. Tiana Pyer-Pereira 'O7

What I was wearing when I became "the guy with the
rainbow hat"
My ex-girlfriend gave me a rainbow hat for my birthday. It had been her hat, and when I was flirting with her
before we were together I would always steal her hat. She
knew I liked it and she gave it to me, but I lost the original hat when I came to school. Then she knit me another
one. It makes me easy to find in a crowd. People ask if I
wear it to bed or wear it in the shower, but I don't go to
bed or take showers. I get approached and asked to buy
drugs a lot because of the hat, and I also end up talking to
people I otherwise wouldn't talk to because they comment
on it, and we end up having a conversation.

Answers to the questions you wish you'd asked
Sarah says:
So, I broke my foot. As you can probably
imagine, this had a pretty large impact on
my desire to do anything except sit around
and groan about how lousy it is to have a
broken foot. Ergo, there will be no review
this week. I know you will be crushed by
this news, but try to be noble in your suffering, like Coriolanus. I hate Coriolanus.
Also Shakespeare. Also stairs and any dis-

tance longer than two feet.
Actually, it's not that bad. Besides, now
we get to present our Emergency Backup

Column, the one where we answer all the
questions you would have sent us if our
primary audience were not, well, us.

Q: I have a 20-page paper due tomorrow
and two jobs and six internships, and I
have $5 in my bank account. Where can
I get a great meal for $5 in 30 seconds
or less?

Sarah: Nowhere. However, it is possible
to get good food quickly and cheaply in
Philly. If you're in Center City, your best
bet is Reading Terminal Market, which has
dozens of small shops and lunch counters
selling everything from oysters to tabbouleh. The other day I had a nice bowl of
vegetarian stew at Basic Four Vegetarian
Juice Bar for $2.50, which was a good deal.
If you're near South Street, try Gianna's
Grille at Sixth and Lombard for vegetarian
and non-vegetarian cheesesteaks, pizzas

and desserts.

THE PHOENIX

Ben: Also, if you can't find a $5 or $6
lunch special in Chinatown, you must be
blind.

Q: What's your favorite

restaurant?

Ben: Genji, on 17th
and Sansom. It's the
best Japanese I've
ever had and a good

date-restaurant

money on the food as they did making the

restaurant look like a set from "Flash
Gordon meets the Sashimi People," it'd be
a lot better. This place always gets hyped,
and I always take great pleasure in smacking it down.

Q: Hey, does The Phoenix pay
for your meals?
Sarah: Alas, no. Now stop ask-

to

boot. I was actually
paranoid that if we
put this one in the

column thousands of
Swatties would flock
there and I'd never
get a table. That's
why
we
haven't
reviewed it.

words, because you're

Q: You guys are great! I read

your column every week!
Ben: I love you too, Mom.

Q: What's your least

as that. All we hear is, "Hey, does The

did ask, I would probably say IHOP or

Technically pan-Asian or Japanese fusion,

Q: So why should I go to any of
these places? SEPTA is expensive, food is expensive, and I
fear social contact.
Sarah: I look at it this way:
Food is art, and it's art everyone
can appreciate. That's why I
wanted to do this column. I think
it's great to go out and explore

new tastes. Why spend $lO at Cheng Hing
when you could go out and try Burmese
noodles or Jamaican barbecue?
Ben: You should go because bad
Chinese takeout and Acapulco's get old
real fast, and I speak as someone for whom
Chinese and pizza constituted two major
food groups in the not-too-distant past.
Plus it gets you out of the Swat bubble for
a couple precious hours.

April 15, 2004

Q: What Jamaican barbecue?

Ben: Funny you should mention that.
Jamaican Jerk Hut, at 1436 South St.,
almost got reviewed for this week. It serves
jerk chicken, barbecue or curry for around
10 bucks a plate, with portions the size of
your head. They've even got a big vegetarian menu.

Q: Are there any decent restaurants in
the Ville?

Ben: No.
Sarah: I think Occasionally Yours is OK,
although its name raises some questions.
Are you really mine? If so, why only occasionally? Are you seeing someone else? Or
maybe we're just "friends with benefits"?

Q: Don't you guys ever go out for a burger and fries?

Ben: I do. You could do a lot worse than
Iron Hill Restaurant and Brewery over in
Media. They've got good burgers, wings and
way, waaay above-average beer. If it were
possible to frame a plate of nachos for posterity, I would frame theirs. They even have
good hummus for my vegetarian colleague.

Q: What's wrong with Coriolanus?

Sarah: Nothing, actually. Having a broken foot just makes me generally resentful.
Also, Coriolanus doesn't suffer nobly. He

mostly just kills people.
Ben: Much like Shakespeare, references
will kill a restaurant column.

It's time for an Aimless Graduates Club

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Stringent requirements will keep out anyone who already has a plan for next year
One of the great things about being a Phoenix columnist, besides the money and fame, is the chicks. The
chicks and the unlimited pizza toppings. Sometimes I
walk around campus with a girl on each arm and a pizza
in each hand and think to myself, "This is it. I've
arrived." And then someone asks me about my plans for

after graduation.
I consistently find myself faced with a fellow student
inquiring about what I'll
"be up to next year," with
seeming good nature. It's
like being the kid who forgot it was show-and-tell
and has to present a
bologna sandwich as a
puppet. I am forced to

start

mumbling about
"still exploring my possibilities" while the other
person pretends to care.

The question seems at

first to be a good opener,
an innocuous replacement

ELIZABETH HOLMAN

The Awkward Silence

for the "What classes are
you taking?" when you
find yourself stalled for

conversation. The problem is, though, that the
only students who ask me
this question are those

who already have plans.

They have incredible, concrete plans. Plans that usually involve realizing both their lifelong dream and those of
50 others. Plans that, were they to take form, would spit on
me and make biting remarks about my last seminar paper.
Their plans could beat my plans at basketball, or chess, or
tiddlywinks. Their plans get better grades than my plans
and always do all the reading.

And it's not enough,for me to speak vaguely about my
ambiguous future. That's just the beginning. After I finish
rambling about how "I don't want to tie myself down just
yet" and am "anything but desperate" comes the pause.
Now I'm supposed to ask about their future. It's like the
humiliation frosting on the seven-tier chocolate humiliation cake.
I am tired of cake.

I consistently find myself faced with
a fellow student asking me what I'll
"be up to next year," with seeming
good nature. It's like being the kid
who forgot it was show-and-tell and
has to present a bologna sandwich

So I am starting a club for people who have no idea
what they're doing after graduation. It will have stringent membership requirements. This club is not for people who:
L Have to choose between being editor of The New
York Times and first chair violin in the Philadelphia

Philharmonic.

2. Or between being a senior investment banker at J.P.
Morgan or getting tenure at Harvard Law School.

3. Have any viable prospects as of this moment.
This club will meet weekly in Parrish Parlours, where
we will complain about all the jerks we know who have
bright futures and how much better we are than they.
When people ask us what our plans are, we will tell
them we don't know, and then
we won't ask about

theirs. No matter how awkward it is, no matter how tense
the silence. We will smile and start talking about something else, and they will never get to tell us about how
they're going to be executive director of Amnesty
International.
We will also have a bitter club song, like Radiohead's
"Creep" or Britney Spears' "Lucky." We will sing it loudly
and angrily at the beginning of each meeting while glaring
at everyone around us. We will go to the Women's
Resource Center coffee house and sarcastically intone
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" without any musical accompaniment. We will stand outside Career Services and sneer.
Our club will have many sponsored activities, like a letter-writing campaign to tell fellow Swatties that their job
offers have been rescinded and a 2 a.m. phone-a-thon'that
involves dialing randomly, yelling, "Hey, loser! You loser!"
and hanging up. We will also read aloud the resumes of
people who have jobs and make fun of them, saying things
like, "Ooooh, relevant experience! What a nerd." We will
throw water balloons at freshmen because they look so

damn happy.
At the beginning of each meeting, we will check in to
make sure no one has even the slightest possibility of
doing something after graduation. If someone gets a job
offer, or gets into grad school, or buys a ticket to a place
they want to visit, or decides they want to work on their
art, they're out. Then they have to buy all of us pizza. And
root beer. And lollipops.
To get into this club, you need a signed letter from
your adviser and Career Services certifying that you
have no opportunities and probably will not in the near
future. You need to have a dejected sigh and a cynical outlook. You need to have outstanding library fines. Once
you have all those, we'll talk. We are also currently
accepting summer internship applications from
unqualified juniors.

Film festival shows documentary on Muslim nomads
time Koch devotes to them lends a mysterious importance to seemingly small
tasks.

BY EVA HOLMAN
eholman2@swarthmore.edu

The film quality is grainy, the camerawork is primitive and the plot features a
runaway camel, but "Asshak: Tales from
the Sahara," written and directed by
Ulrike Koch, is a visually stunning documentary centering on a family of Muslim
Tuareg nomads in Africa. Examining
their lives through clips of the family's
storytelling, musical performances and
daily routine, Koch brings to screen a
tribe's miraculous survival in the harsh
Sahara desert.
The unique ways through which Koch
relates the daily tasks of the Tuareg holds
the audience's interest. Sprinkled
throughout the film are images of hands,
often engaged in excruciatingly exact
processes. One scene is of a pair of hands
methodically shaping a piece of bread by
pressing it into the ground, scraping the
sand off and repeating the process.
Similarly, another pair of hands scoops

sand from a

widening hole

with a tin pot,

pausing at times to carefully smooth the
hole's edges. These clips are especially
engaging because of the meticulousness

with which the hands engage in processes
new to the viewer. The amount of

likely

Koch respectfully presents
an African tribe that
survives the harshest
conditions by utilizing its
terrain in more ways
than seem possible.
Especially interesting is the time Koch
devotes to the women of the tribe through

candid interviews. One entertaining
scene features the family's stern matriarch, who declares that "a husband is like
the shadow of a tree. The morning leaves
you under the scorching sun. Such men
are no good," she declares before throwing a subtly reproachful look at her husband sitting beside her. In another interview, her granddaughter shyly reveals
that she loves her goats. This last fact is
amusingly displayed through clips of her

interacting with her many baby goats,
who playfully bleat and jump on her back
when she's feeding them.

Though no single person is the focus of
Koch's story, the family's adolescent
teenage girl comes close. The film features footage of her daily chores that
brave the sandy, windy desert plane.
Tracking the young girl's progression
into womanhood gives the film most of its
limited chronological order. We see her
progress from timidly deciding against
raising her hand in the classroom
doodling on her slate instead
to applying
makeup and dressing in women's clothing
for a baptismal ceremony.
And, of course, the focus on camels

completes this documentary. One man
swears by the legend of the camel who
became the origin of all life. Another man
muses that, "when you fall asleep on a
camel's back and awaken, you look up at
the stars and know where you are." From
footage of camels running across the
desert to simple close-ups of their faces
staring back at the camera, the mysticism
of and respect with which the Tuareg

treat camels shines through. Perhaps the
best camel moment is when the man who
is missing his camel stops at a market to
ask if anyone has seen it. One of the mer-

chants looks at him reproachfully and
says, "We're car people here."
The most stunning aspect of the docu-

mentary is Koch's rendering the simplest
sights as beautiful. Even the desert sand is
presented in a way completely unique to
the viewer, as it is used for making water
holes, burying one's feet and even scraping
a simple school alphabet lesson. A flood
after a long-anticipated rainstorm becomes
even more powerful as the camera situated
in the water causes it to rush toward the
audience. Koch gives even the most basic

elements a new life.
Near the end of the film, the origin of
the mysterious word "Asshak" is revealed
as "the deepest respect for a code of conduct." Koch respectfully presents an
African tribe that survives the harshest
conditions by utilizing its terrain in more
ways than seem possible. Some phrases

resonate with striking familiarity (the
matriarch's declaration that "a woman's
work is never done at all"), but the Tuareg
legends told throughout the documentary
give magic to the mundane. One may not
see the finished product of the snippets of
Tuareg tasks seen throughout the movie,
but Koch balances both the mystic and the
familiar in his presentation of everyday
life in the Sahara desert.

The mind behind the housing madness
one of their roommates.
Westphal tries not to match

BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Who is this weirdo in my
room, anyway? Admit it. Every so
often, you've wondered. How did I
end up living with her?
Housing season is in full
swing. Blocks have been assigned
or denied, lottery numbers have
been distributed (don't you complain, I got U4B) and roommate
alliances are being made and broken on a daily basis. Now is a
good time to take a break from
plotting how to finagle your way
into the new dorm and take a look
back to the good old days of your
first year, when you could look at
the person in the next bed and
think, "It's not my fault I'm living
with him. Myrt chose for me."

As it turns out, the mysterious

incoming first-years with people
they already know. That means
roommate requests usually don't
get honored. She especially worries about people who met at
Ride the Tide and then ask to be
placed together. "Meeting some-

one for one weekend and maybe

talking over e-mail isn't a good
basis for a friendship," she said.
"I tell them, 'You'll meet someone
new, and your friendship will
survive.'"
But there are exceptions.

Wonderland

SENIOR ART EXHIBIT

Week
by Claire Ruud

cruudl@swarthmore.edu

Emily Alvarez's senior exhibition will transform the List Gallery into an
elementary-school wonderland this week. The show opens tomorrow from 4 to 6 p.m.
Viewers will experience their second childhood as they wander through memories
of cafeteria lunches, circle time and craft projects. Alvarez's exhibition includes
found-object art, milk-carton "sculptures," colorful paintings of life-sized children
and mobile-collages hanging on low clotheslines like the classroom display of a firstgrade craft project. The multi-sensory installation is even rumored to include a running refrigerator and appropriately themed refreshments. (I am imagining the scent
ofPB&J wafting through the gallery, and the familiar crunch of Goldfish ringing in
our ears.) In these diverse media, Alvarez explores play, childhood and tainted innocence. She creates a world of sinister playfulness and impish laughter.
When you visit the show, you will probably hear Alvarez's own guilty laugh drifting through the gallery. She matches her
naughty-child aesthetic with mischievous

and Cygnets. Happily cutting, pasting and giggling, we looked like kindergarteners
during arts-and-crafts time. While working on a collage of my own, I chatted with
Alvarez about her work.
When I asked why she had organized this collage party, she laughed through one
having people do [the colof her typical two-pronged answers. "This is the art
lages]." She paused. "And I just wanted more mobiles, and people kept bringing me
stuff [to put in them], and I realized I wasn't going to have time to do it all myself, so
I was like, 'Why don't you do it?' I'm exploiting the viewers, exposing their thoughts
in my show." Here she stopped and laughed hysterically. Does Alvarez genuinely
want us to participate in creating the art, or is she simply using us to do her work for
her? Cleverly, her answers kept us guessing.
I asked about the viewer response she tries to elicit, and she shot back puckishly,
"I just want a room of happy people." Again, a duplicitous response. Her work twists
those words into barbs. In the exhibition, she has piles of candy hearts singed with a lighter, brown-bag lunches stuffed with beer
bottles, canvases painted with sleeping children tangled in a half-playful, half-erotic clump and milk cartons silk-screened with
images of babies, Swat students and celebrities that look like ads for missing persons. Her art interweaves childish play with threatening, upsetting undercurrents.
Alvarez has a therapeuticphilosophy of art that partly accounts for the way she mixes playfulness and serious issues in her work. Ideally, she sees art as a way for individuals to relax and
express themselves. This includes both having fun and dealing with pain and fear. At one time, she
wanted to become an art therapist, because, she said, "Art is therapy." Unfortunately, Alvarez has
discovered an elitism in the art therapy world that disappoints her. She believes strongly in the
potential restorative power of art, if only we could rid it of cold intellectualism, academic rigor and
snobby avant-gardism. Instead, art should be fun so that everyone can use it to process their emotions and ideas free of rules and judgments. In her future, Alvarez now pictures herself as "an
advocate for art in the real world." She's not sure yet into what this will practically translate.
Alvarez both resists the rigorous theoretical and formal standards of the art world and
depends on them for the potency of her artwork. She recognizes the self-contradictory position she holds but clings to it tightly. If she limited her art to being personal therapy, it

art, or is she just goofing off and laughing at us when we draw solemn conclusions? It's a
little bit ofboth. There's no manifest in her artwork, but Alvarez isn't as naive as she sometimes pretends. Her work is bittersweet. She struggles with the confusion and complexity
of life experience and juxtaposes happiness and pain without flinching.

Assassins storms campus, 31 bottoms grabbed
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

At a school as small as
Swarthmore, there are very few
secrets. Perhaps one of the bestkept is what goes on in a game
called Assassins, in which students "assassinate" each other by,
literally, grabbing each other's
asses. All proceedings are kept
securely hush-hush. I knew writing an expose on this would be no
easy feat, as anonymity is the players' greatest ally. I managed to
obtain a secret list of several players, and e-mailed them asking for
their anonymous participation.
Only one player, who asked to be
referred to as Ms. X, replied.
The process of securing an
interview with this player was
surreal. Ms. X sent me a series of
severely paranoid, strictly guarded e-mails. "As a player I am currently extremely careful of where I
not
am and who is around me
knowing you, nor your possible
affiliation with other players
makes me highly suspicious of a
set up," she wrote in her first
reply. Her tone did not soften even
after we had established that I was
from a neutral party. "You will
receive an e-mail from me between
9 and 10 p.m., we will meet 15 minutes to half an hour later at a location designated by me in that email," she later wrote.
When I arrived at our interview, I was surprised to find that
Ms. X was good-natured and
approachable, nothing at all like
her clandestine e-mails. "We're
all intent on being paranoid," she
said. "It's a good thing." She let
her guard down for half an hour
to give me an eye-opening look
into the world of Assassins.
We began with the rules, which
are simple but provocative.
Seasoned players invite novices to
attend a meeting about the game,

which is supervised by the
Assmaster and Assmistress. They
secretly assign each player anoth-

er player to "assassinate" within
three days. Players must kill their
target by squeezing their ass with
two hands. "It has to be a palpable
squeeze, so that the person notices

and so that there isn't a dispute,"
Ms. X said. Once that happens, the
dead player is out the game, and
the killer's new target is the dead
player's target. Again, they are
given three days for their new target. This continues on with the
circle getting smaller and smaller,
until the last player is killed and a
winner is declared. On a lighthearted note, "We'll have a party
and there will be awards for most
paranoid, best conspiracy, that
sort of thing," Ms. X said.
If a player does not manage to
kill their target within the three
days, a predetermined "death
squad" comes after the player. By
this time, safe zones no longer
apply. "They mostly act in the
dead of night," Ms. X said. To help
make the paranoia more manageable, players are given a complete
list of the people playing.
There are a number of designated safe spaces where one can
be free of danger. Dorm areas are
safe, but common areas such as
Parrish Parlours are not. Neither
are libraries, labs, studios, non-

dorm restrooms or even classes.
An exception would be a class
where free movement is required,
such as a dance class. The same

goes for sports practices. While
the practice itself is off-limits,
preparation time and post-practice showers are not.
Mealtimes are tricky situations, as well. "Sharpies is safe if
you're holding a tray in such a
way that, if your hand were to
move, the tray would fall," Ms. X
said. Players are not allowed protection. "You can't wear a tray on

your ass," she said. The Assmaster

The current game, however, is the

and Assmistress have declared the
Passover kitchen in Bond safe during holiday meals. Tarble is not
safe, because players can choose
not to eat there, whereas it is more

largest on record. "It's just a fantastic game. It's really exciting to
play and really well designed,"

difficult to avoid Sharpies.
I was also privileged to have
the honor of an e-mail correspon-

dence with the current Assmaster
or Assmisstress. (The e-mail was
signed with a simple "a.m.," so I
cannot be sure which "m" I was
writing to.) Assassins has been
played each semester since the
spring of 2001, when it started as a
study break game on Hallowell
Ist, a.m. said. Since then, it has
branched out into other dorms
(there's been a Mary Lyons version) and various social groups.

the a.m. said.
In this year's game, daily email updates are sent by the
Assmaster and Assmistress about
how many assassins have been
killed. However, no specific names
are disclosed. The initial round
began at sunup Saturday morning
with 81 players. As of noon on
Tuesday, there had been 31 kills,

several of which took place during

the Battle of the Bands at Olde

Club on Saturday evening.
The constant paranoia keeps
Ms. X on her toes. "I've been really careful

when I'm moving
around. I've tried to make sure

that no one knows when I've been

working in lab or in the music
building. I've modified a couple of
the places where I study," she
said. She has even taken to peeking around corners before turning, and she walks with the sun

behind her so she can identify the
shadows of anyone approaching.
For the next few days, expect
the rest of the players to be constantly on the move as well, looking out for their targets, and dodging any situations where they will
be left vulnerable. Unsurprising
for such an intense, all-consuming
event, the game has larger impli-

cations. "A friend ofmine said that
this is a game that allows you to
feel that your life is more valuable
than it really is," Ms. X said.

"They Were Wrong So We Drowned"

Liars
(Mute, 2004)

Last week I described the cover of the Elected's "Me
First" as one of the ugliest I'd seen in ages. I take it back.
The artwork for "They Were Wrong
So We Drowned" is so hideous it's
almost painful to look at. And I
must say it's strikingly appropri-

Liars' debut, but nobody's going to call that pop. From
any angle, "They Were Wrong So We Drowned" is a
damn scary record. It's about witches. Did I mention
that? In some sense it's a timeless, faceless terror, but
at base it comes across as a compelling artifact of our
ambiguously fearful age. Can you hear the sound of
fear?

here, there's plenty to hold on to
spastic-funkly riddims, hypnotic chants and sadistically entrancing
synth textures
amid the screams, guitar gurgles,
squalling electro-sonics, maddening drones and almost
relentless head-on abrasion. "Read the Book that wrote

comes off as creepy, to be sure, but not terrifying.

Staff polling
One of the most telling characteristics of the
Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
is the circumstances of its founding. Though it is a
campaign whose goals center around the college's
staff, attempting to improve their quality of life and
enact standards offairness in their compensation, students originally started it, and they have continued to
run it. Similarly, most open opposition to the living
wage proposals has come from other students.
This is not particularly surprising; many social
movements involve one group fighting over issues
that affect another. Along with having more free time
and financial resources than most staff members, students who would not directly benefit from the reforms
they propose are thus free to act without the appearance of bias and without experiencing institutional or
peer pressure to take a particular stance.
This works from both ends. Some cite fears of

incurring the ill will of supervisors and managers as
a reason staff members don't enter the debate in favor
of a wage increase. Others claim staff members who
oppose a wage increase are pressured by the opinions

of students and fellow staff members to keep silent.
Whichever way the majority of staff members actually fall on this issue, both sides of the debate have the
power to cite their perception of staff opinion to bolster their side of the argument.
Doing so can be a mistake; the staff aren't the only
people who would be affected by the adoption of a
wage increase, and any major change in the budget
will have significant effects on the college as a whole
that need to be discussed and are too often overlooked.
However, the basic reasoning behind these proposals does depend entirely on what wage level is fair and

adequate compensation for staff, and that is a question
that hinges on staff perceptions of the issue. And,
unfortunately, staff perceptions are the gaping hole in
the information available to those having to make this

decision.

It may seem logical to presume that because a wage
increase is intended to benefit the staff, staff members
would be in favor of it, but we should not rely on this

presumption. Wage compression, increased competition for college jobs, the possibility of future job cuts
and other potentially unforeseen consequences of a
wage increase stand to actively harm staff, if opponents' arguments are to be believed, and from the perspective of some staff members who have spoken out,
these are real concerns. Staff members should not be

treated as a monolithic interest group; staff members
have as much capacity to weigh each side's arguments
as anyone else. Neither side should have the power to
simply invoke them as supporters for their position.
We find it unlikely that many staff members

haven't spoken out simply because of lack of interest
in the issue; the difficulties of speaking out about a
position one is so close to are a much more likely reason for their relative silence on the issue. If the college
is to make a fair decision on this issue in the near
future, the administration must find some way to give
staff members a chance to respond without the fear of
social and institutional reprisal. A neutral, independent polling company could be commissioned to conduct a study here, as has been done in other workplaces, or the college could look for a more secure and
comprehensive method of distributing and collecting
secret ballots among staff members than e-mails and
mailbox stuffing.
We shouldn'tfall into the trap of thinking that staff
opinions will settle the decision the college ought to
make. Staff members are just as capable of anyone else
of being misinformed about the issue or making poor
decisions based on social pressures and the limits of
their own perspectives. However, as the central figures
in this debate, staff members must at least be allowed
to contribute their own perspective and let the Board
of Managers know what facts might be missing from
arguments that, so far, have been made mostly by people for whom the living wage issue is a question over

Hometown friends hope Lull gets well soon
Dear Editor:
My name is Samantha Laudert. I am from Valdez,
Alaska, and a friend of Kevin Lull 'O6. I sincerely would
like to thank The Phoenix Online for having articles on
this wonderful man who has been there for me through
the hard times.
We are from a small town, and rumors happen, but I
can rely on going to a source for more information; that
source is your online newspaper. Being still at his high
school, the teachers and students are all really worried
about Kevin and have had people signing cards in the

library for him since Monday.
One night I decided to go to the Swarthmore Web site
to see if I could find more information about the accident, and I did. Since that night I have been checking
every day for more updates on how he is doing.
Teachers from when he was in high school are pleased
to have been able to see the articles on his recovery.
Reading about his mother being by his side all of this

time is something that brought tears to the eyes of those
who originally read the article in the library when I
found it. His mother is awesome and strong, just like

Kevin.

His high school drama and English teacher has been
extremely supportive and was more than pleased when I
let her know what I have found. So many of us are worried, but knowing that he is getting better day by day is
reassuring to the small community of Valdez, Alaska.
Once again I would like to thank you for the information that has been posted, and all of his friends here at
home are excited to hopefully see him sometime soon.
There are no words that could describe how meaningful
these articles have been to those who have grown up
with him, and there are also no words that could ever

describe how wonderful Kevin is. Thank you.

popular discourse, at least when blacks enter the dispardon me, Africancussion, are: "Why are Negroes

Americans are still victims? Why do AfricanAmericans still fit the Uncle Tom and Sambo stereotypes?" Just as the bachelor who answers and fails to
challenge his questioner's assumptions thereby incriminates himself as a wife beater, the Negro who answers
the questions of American popular discourse without
thoroughly challenging its assumptions thereby
incriminates himself as an inferior, as a hapless victim,
as an Uncle Tom or Sambo. Since our popular discourse
is dominated by the tyranny of white majority public
opinion, the Negro must question and challenge white
supremacist propaganda and its corollary black inferi-

the myths that legitimize
tyranny
in Marx's case
"class," in X's case "race."
They exposed propaganda in order to "bear witness unto truth," to quote
Jesus' epitome of the philosophic vocation. They were
logic-choppers, but not of the ivory-tower variety. They
got down and dirty by analyzing, literally "breaking
down," propaganda. The philosopher is the logic-chopping champion of the people.
Tyranny is upheld, first and foremost, by propaganda, which, to use Noam Chomsky's phrase, "manufactures consent" of the public. Propaganda sets the
parameters of popular discourse. It brackets public
opinion. It is pure politics. It is not about ethics. The
reason the philosopher is the tyrant's worst nightmare
is because he questions the legitimacy of arbitrary
authority. He is a logic-chopping David single-handedly
confronting tyrannical Goliath and his fellow
Philistines. He pits ethics and objective truth against
politics and propaganda.
The tyrant's apologists, the sophists, try to silence
the philosopher by demanding that he stop asking questions and provide some answers. The original Sophists
were constantly trying to get Socrates to stop questioning, to start answering. You see, once the philosopher
stops questioning, he's lost, and the sophist knows it.
Any statement which fails to challenge the assumptions
of any given discourse thereby endorses that discourse.
For example, if you ask me, "How often do you beat
your wife?" I have the right to challenge the assumptions of your question. Any answer that I give which

discourse not his own.
The philosopher negates
propaganda as a point of

departure for his own search
for truth. Yes, the philosopher believes in objective
truth. He believes that the
truth of denotation and etymology conquers the propaganda of connotation and

political correctness. Socrates was given hemlock to

drink as a token of his conquest. Jesus was crucified.
Spinoza was excommunicated. After giving his then
heretical, now celebrated "Divinity School Address,"
Ralph Waldo Emerson was banned from speaking at
Harvard for 30 years. Marcus Garvey was deported
from the U.S.A. Malcolm X was gunned down.
The philosopher simply wants to know the truth.
Philistines hate the philosopher, for, like Tom Cruise in
"A Few Good Men," they can't handle the truth. They
see human motivation in terms of emotion and politics,
little knowing that everything they do, everything they
think, is based on philosophy, or as Marx would say,
ideology. To challenge the philosophy rooted in white
bourgeois propaganda is to challenge the core and foundation of white bourgeois being. Philistines both black
and white hate the philosopher who reveals them as
beneficiaries of Manifest Destiny and the New World
Order, part and parcel of the "tyranny of the majority."
Philistines reduce volitional willpower to emotional
motivation. They dismiss the gadfly as an "angry black
man." They vainly try to psychoanalyze him when they
should be trying to analyze his arguments. They do not
understand, and they do not even try to understand.

...

(5:20).
Jesus' teachings were so
frightening to those in power
at the time that
as we all

fellow worker and murdered.
The fascinating thing about
the story of Jesus is not that it makes a gory movie but that,
after his death, the teachings of Jesus were co-opted by the
very elite that he preached against. Jesus preached universal
love, cooperation, egalitarianism and peace. Now, his name is
invoked to justify acts of war. The religious right commands
all "good Christians" to obey their leaders and not question
authority. Whenever there is a person
or a movement
that is so strong that the rulers cannot fight it head-on, they
co-opt it and turn it for their own purposes. Jesus' teachings
were so dangerous for the ruling class that they had to be
assimilated into the existing hierarchy in order to remove
their potency. All of a sudden, Jesus is not a preacher of
peace and harmony; he is little more than a multi-million dollar blockbuster hit, an excuse to hate gay people and a figurehead for authority. The dollar bill, a symbol of capitalism
and inequality, proclaims "In God we Trust."
Other movements have experienced the same effect.
Martin Luther King Jr., best known, of course, for his work
in the civil rights movement, was only assassinated after he
started working on class issues instead of simply legislative
civil rights. His anti-poverty work has been erased from history, and he has been given a holiday and lauded as a perfect
example of a patriotic American. His words and the movement he represented were so powerful that the elite retreated, but, as they did, they continued to govern the rules of perception. The postmodern police state, rather than destroying
the civil rights movement, merely altered the perception of it,
embracing the words, "civil rights," while economic oppression and systemic racism remained completely intact. In the
same vein, the women's liberation movement proved too
strong for the patriarchal powers of the elite. Unable to
squash it, they refrained the debate, shifting it away from
dangerous topics for the
issues of class and oppression
elite. Instead, they introduced consumer feminism: capitalism used to exploit us, so now we'll exploit it. This circumvents the notion and possibility that the system is inherently
patriarchal and must be changed at the fundamental level.
The discussion has been made "safe" by limiting it to narrow
brackets of pro-life vs. pro-choice and equal wages for

women.

To say that the media is responsible for this de-radicalizaignore the stranglehold
that the elite maintain over the flow of information.
However, the media often serves as a willing (or even unwilling) ally to the sensationalism and simplification that is
involved in removing the revolutionary potency of a social
movement. The media places the bookends on the discussion
and determines what is "inside the box" and what is not. The
editors of a newspaper determine what fits within their fixed
notion of the Political and decide that other material
designed to ask questions and make people think rather than
engage in left-right ping-pong
has no place on the opinions
page. They want bombastic and sensational caricatures: a
conservative with no soul, a radical with no brain, a partyline liberal to tell the campus what it wants to hear. They
wish that the radical would just shut up about those extraneous issues and talk about what radicals are supposed to talk
about: police brutality, prison abolition, globalization and
war. The notion that political action might take place outside
their closely defined box of what is acceptable is too frightening to print. Thus, they sensationalize and co-opt radical
thought, stripping it of its potency and refraining it safely
within the walls of capital-P "issue" politics.

Newsweek poll
showed that, while the
public approves of his
handling of terrorism, they disapprove of both his handling of the economy and of Iraq. But most Americans
feel they know Bush and what he stands for. The same
cannot be said for Kerry.
Voters' questions about Kerry will be answered, but
will they be answered by Kerry himself or by the Bush
campaign? So far, Bush has raised more money on the
campaign trail than Kerry has, and he has used that
money to put out ads attacking Kerry. The ads, which hit
Kerry on taxes and defense issues, project a clear vision
of Kerry as an out-of-touch, tax-raising, soft-on-defense
liberal.

ideas for the nation. He needs more, though. He needs to
define himself and show himself to the nation as a strong
and capable leader. The truth is that, like it or not, character often matters in American elections. In 2000, the
voters preferred the policies advocated by Al Gore. They
voted for Bush in large part because they saw him as a

compassionate, trustworthy and nice person, while they
viewed Gore as dishonest. Although voters' trust of Bush
has been hurt by the lack of weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq, he still maintains a distinct edge on character
and leadership issues. A Pew Poll released March 29
shows that, while opinions of Bush's character have
slipped, people still think he is more "willing to take a
stand" than Kerry (59 to 28 percent). People also give
Bush better ratings on "can get things done" (49 to 30), "a
strong leader" (51 to 33) and "good judgment in a crisis"
(46 to 36).

There's no silver bullet that Kerry can use to instantly
change voters' opinions of him, but there are certainly
things he could be doing. He could, for instance, make
more out of his 19-year Senate career. Some have complained that Kerry's Senate career has been marked by
flip-flops, and even the most die-hard Kerry fan cannot
ignore the grain of truth in that accusation: Kerry's posion the Iraq war showcase pandering and indecisiveness at their worst. There are also instances of real
leadership and courage in Kerry's Senate career, though,
on the POW-MIA question in the early 19905, for instance,
or on the Bush administration's recent attempts to drill in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Frankly, I would love
to hear Kerry respond to Bush's recent attacks on his past
support for gas tax increases by saying, "Yes, Mr.
President, I did support a gas tax increase, because I
believed it to be the right thing for the economy. Your Web
site notes that the tax hike I supported was unpopular, as
if that should be a source of shame. I would contend that
my support for a gas tax increase at a time when it was
unpopular should be taken as a sign of political courage."

You get the idea.
Instead, Kerry put up a fact sheet on his Web site criticizing the accuracy of Bush's gas tax ad. There's nothing
wrong with that, of course, but Kerry's scrambling to
assure voters that he "never sponsored or voted for a 50cent gas tax increase" lends credence to the idea that he's
a flip-flopping panderer who does not want to offend anyone. There's a lot more to John Kerry than flip-flops, but
it's about time that he starts showing that to the voters.

Though I've been in Prague this semester, in the year
prior I was the Student Council secretary. I learned how to
run a Student Council meeting, how to get things done and
also what mistakes not to make. If elected, I will use my
Student Council experience to help expand Swarthmore's
social scene by reaching out to Tri-Co students and to help
campus groups do more and function more smoothly by

In my first year at Swarthmore, I have become an
active member of our community, taking part in student
activities, organizations and sports. I love Swarthmore,
and as campus life representative I will work with the
Deans' Advisory Council to ensure that your interests are
represented. I promise that I will do everything in my
power to make our school environment as fun, interesting
and exciting as it can possibly be by listening to my fellow
students and enacting several specific policies.
L I will work to increase the quality and availability of
food on campus. We must be able to get food at Tarble after

2. I will suggest that the administration take steps to
increase the availability of parking on campus. Larger
parking facilities will allow us to increase our options
beyond the bustling metropolis that is the Ville.

halls on campus. I believe that every student should have
a key that allows them to go into any other dorm without

Hey, there. I'm Richard, and I'm running for student
groups advisor.
I was recently perusing the list of student groups at
Swarthmore online and was surprised to find some I had
never heard of before. If I'm elected, I'll create booklets
consisting of descriptions of all the student groups and
what each of them has to offer to the Swarthmore community, to be posted in each dorm. This will help publicize
student groups and get Swatties more involved in activities on campus.
If elected, I would ease the restrictions that exist concerning the creation of new student groups. We have a
very diverse student body at Swarthmore, with a wide
variety of interests, and it is important that we have student groups that cater to as many of these interests as possible. I would also increase the amount of seed funds (startup money) available so that students would be more willing to consider starting up a new student organization.
I promise you that I'll try my utmost to implement
these and other ideas that I have. I also promise you that
I'll be very receptive to any exciting ideas that you may
have for me. Thanks.

I also know that there are currently many areas in
which students are unable to have their voices heard. In

Board of Managers acknowledge student input ceremonially, if at all. While I realize that non-student bodies must

Jonathan Fombonne 'O5

What is often dismissed as a passing complaint can
frequently be an important criticism of our campus life
or a suggestion as to how it could be made better. With
almost three years under my belt at Swat, I have heard
my fair share of complaints. Whether at Sharpies, the
library or Parrish Parlours, I often hear students say
things like "I wish we had [insert suggestion here] on
campus" or things like that. As campus life representative, it will be my job to try my best to bring these things
to the student body. For example, I have heard students
say that they would like a lit walkway to PPR, an outdoor
basketball court, a cheaper book buying and exchange
system and the use of points at the McCabe coffee bar,
amongst other suggestions. These daily concerns may be
more than just passing ideas, and I will strive to have
them implemented. I will hold weekly office hours where
students can come voice their complaints and ideas. I
will also be an effective Student Council member, as I
have had experience on council, having served as campus life representative for 2003. I would like to serve
another term, as I believe that there is much more that
can be done. With my past experience and good knowledge of campus issues, I believe I will have a successful
term as campus life representative. Thus, vote for Jon
Fombonne 'O5 for campus life representative and bring
actual change to the campus.

Hey, hey! My name is Etan Cohen (aka Aton, Antoine
or Coco), and I am running for campus relations representative. Many exclaim, "Eat a prune and start a movement!" From leaving Cornell open for a few more hours to
increasing the selection of TastyKakes at Tarble, the campus relations representative answers the concerns of
Swatties and fights to start a movement to improve the
communication around Swarthmore. Throughout my
time here, I've been frustrated to see that there are
unhappy students that remain unhappy for four years.
Not under my watch! It is not hopeless. Creating a credi-

ble and useful class recommendation book is possible.
And a book fair is essential. Frankly, I can't deal with
buying a $4O book just to sell it back for $5 so they can sell
it to a friend of mine for $35. Other things I'm passionate
about (oh, you know it!) are a snack time, points in
McCabe, and just making Swat a better place (awwww). I
would be honored to be a voice that represents my peers.
So, just do it. Vote for Etan.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read my
platform.

On Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2003, tragedy struck. On
Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2003, disaster occurred. On
Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2003, hundreds of students arrived at
Sharpies dinner only to find that PASTA BAR WAS
GONE. A Student Council takeover had eliminated this
dining hall institution, and no make-up pasta bar was
planned—an entirely unacceptable situation. If elected to
the position of campus relations representative, I promise that such a tragedy will never happen again. I will
work with Dining Services to ensure that Student
Council's Sharpies takeovers happen only on non-pasta
bar nights. No more will spaghetti-starved Swatties
bemoan Student Council's replacing their favorite meals.
Pasta, marinara sauce and garlic bread will be in abundance every Wednesday and Sunday night, just as they
should be. The world will be made right. So use your noodle. Vote for the one candidate who won't take away

Rich Jaronczyk 'O7
Hello, my name is Rich Jaronczyk, and I am running
for campus life representative. I am a student athlete and
very much a part of campus life. Being as involved as I
am, I am concerned with the status of campus life just as
much as anyone. As the job description dictates, I will
keep a close relationship with the students so that I am
able to address all of the concerns that you have. My list
to improve campus life includes are creating more park-

ing spaces for student parking and extending serving
hours at Sharpies, especially at dinnertime. If elected, I
will be a representative of the students and will be open
to any suggestions that you may have. I plan to be very
active in Student Council and do all I can so that your
voice is heard and so that we can accomplish as much as
we want. Together we can make the Swarthmore experience an easier and more enjoyable one.

Student groups are among the most pivotal aspects of
student life at Swarthmore. They enable students to interact with other students who possess similar interests or
talents and enable students who identify with a similar
group to interact with each other. With student groups at
Swarthmore being as important to campus life as they are,
it is imperative that the student groups advisor allows students the opportunity to get the most from such groups
and facilitate the creation of any new groups. For this reason, I am running for the position of student groups advisor. For those of you who do not know me, my name is
Saeed Ola 'O7. As a current member of the Student Budget
Committee, I am part of a process that ensures that the student activities fee is allocated in a fair manner among all
student groups. As the student groups advisor, I will work
closely with Student Council and continue to work closely

with the Student Budget Committee to ensure that students get the most from existing groups and to facilitate
the creation of new groups. I would greatly appreciate
your vote as I run for student groups advisor. Thank you.

Eric Zwick 'O7
The question is, "Why E.Z. for student groups advisor?"
Well, let's start with the fact that I've got what I like to call
"personal skills." In other words, I can talk to people. I'll
have no problems communicating with the leaders of
groups and clubs, telling them what they need to do to hold
their charters and obtain funds, and working with the
other members of the student government to make every
aspect of student-run grouping as efficient and painless as
possible. I like saving time, and I like saving money. Those
of you who know me know this. I think it's very important
for every member of student government to fight the timewasting and cash-squandering that bureaucracy tends to
invite. I will not be an exception to this rule. Furthermore,
I promise that I'll entertain and perhaps even consider the
suggestion ofDave Gentry 'O5 suggestion to have a bowling
club. So, vote Eric Zwick (SEZS; Dollar, Dollar, Bills, Y'aU;
etc.) for student groups advisor. Thanks.

I am definitely your best choice for the position of
financial policy representative. I will outline for you
three reasons though there are many more, but I know
you are pressed for time.
1. My concern and interests not only lie in economics
and money management but as a social scientist and
humanitarian, I will use the different aspects of my abilities to gain knowledge and insight about the inner workings of the College Budget Committee especially with
regards to the College's financial policies and priorities
and ensure that YOUR best interests are being appropri-

number of Tri-Co students who must commute to Penn to
take upper level Arabic classes and those who study
abroad in Arabic-speaking countries indicate the necessity
for a policy change. With the recent hirings of Middle East
specialists in the political science and history departments
and an Andrew W. Mellon grant awarded to the college to
build its Islamic studies program, the college must recognize the immediate need to expand its current two-year
Arabic program into a fully funded four-year program.
The Curriculum Committee also needs to reexamine the
current faculty review processes and possibly even standardize these processes across all departments. Since
many students are unaware of departmental plans concerning future expansion and course developments, another of my goals is to make educational policy and curriculum decisions more transparent to the student body.
And finally, I hope to recruit someone from the Willets
and Lodges area to teach a class on horticulture.

run them.

2. More substantive and accessible course evaluations
online and on paper.
3. In the tradition of liberal arts, increasing awareness
and access to class audits.
4. Department-sponsored workshops to give students
the opportunity to learn from every department without
committing to a course.*
5. Creating an academic help center that would bring
TAs, natural science clinicians, WAs and SAMs together in

one place.
Thank you.

FINANCIAL POLICY REP.

My goal as educational policy representative will be to
continue and further the student relations with the
Curriculum Committee and the Council of Educational
Policy and to make sure the students' voices are heard. I
will help ensure that the inclusion of Writing courses in
the curriculum will run smoothly and that there will be a
plentiful variance of such courses in each department. I
will continue the work that my predecessors have started,
such as updating and maintaining the online index of syllabi. I will also make it my goal to explore further improvements to the educational system, such as the possibility of
self-administered final exams.

Lizzy Vogel 'O7

Garth Sheldon-Coulson 'O7
I believe Swarthmore may be arriving at an ominous
fork in the road of its institutional journey. Before now,
the tripartite "Swarthmore Way" of educating students
the combination of unparalleled intensity, great intimacy
has served the instituand the unique honors program
tion extremely well. If it hadn't, how could we have kept
pace with institutions like Amherst and Yale despite the
pathetic name recognition Swat endures and our lower

levels of alumni giving?
But it's becoming harder to maintain the Swarthmore
Way. Unfortunately, the influence admissions and academics have on each other has never been stronger. Because of
rankings and financial bond ratings, our admissions successes and failures increasingly have a direct impact on
our ability to secure the top students, professors and facilities. There's a big temptation to conform, to become more
like Yale and Amherst.
But we must not. Our strength is in our uniqueness.
I'm greatly disturbed by grade inflation and the marked
dilution of the honors curriculum over the last 30 years;
both must actively be attacked. I'm greatly disturbed by
our new admissions strategies, because Swarthmore
shouldn't be sold on the "fun" we have, but on the merits
of our system (such as our graduate school admit rates),
which I will work to increase.
As educational policy representative, I will safeguard
what is vital to Swarthmore's future, for if we take the
middle road then we lose our greatest strengths while
truly ameliorating no weaknesses. I will also advocate

smaller changes like a Leadership curriculum similar to
Williams' and, in the Writing Program, a greater focus on
students who need help, instead of casting the WA net too
widely as is currently the practice.

My first year at Swarthmore has shown me that
finances are integral to the student life and academic character of Swarthmore. Controversial issues such as the living wage and funding-closed groups have proven to be
quite polarizing, and I know that these decisions must be
dealt with responsibly and even-handedly. I have never
been afraid to tackle the hard issues, but I also consider
everyone's point of view when doing so. As the financial
policy representative, I would be meeting regularly with
the College Budget Committee and presenting Student
Council's financial propositions. Fortunately, as a member
of the Student Budget Committee this year, I have learned
an immense amount about the financial policies at
Swarthmore and the best methods for working with a committee to make our priorities a reality. I realize that, as a
member of Student Council, I would be one of a small
group of students expected to represent the priorities and
views of the entire student body, so I would engage in conversations with my fellow Swatties to identify our collective priorities and make these concerns paramount when
making decisions. Thank you for your consideration and
support.

Anthony Orazio 'O7
I'm Anthony Orazio, and I am running for financial policy representative. As an economics major, I find myself
interested and qualified for this position. This past summer, I held an internship in the Financial District, and this
upcoming summer I will be doing returns on investment
analysis for Pepsi Co. If elected, I will take the time to gain
a working knowledge of the college's financial system.
With this knowledge and as a participant in the budget
meetings, I will promote what is in the best interest of the
student body. I have several initial concerns which I will
address. One is how college tuition continues to rise at
more than twice the inflation rate. If elected I will ensure
tuition is raised responsibly. I am also concerned with the
college requiring students to pay full tuition while studying abroad, even when program costs are significantly
lower than Swarthmore tuition. I propose that the college
practice a fairer policy, perhaps asking students to pay the
average of the program and Swarthmore tuition. I have
several other concerns, such as the costs of laundry and
see problems in the current meal program. Of course, if
elected I will always be open to student suggestions.

ately and justly addressed.

2. My ability to absorb and understand large quanti-

ties of information in a short period of time will allow me
to not only be an attendee of the College Board
Committee meetings but will also ensure that I can contribute effectively and be an active participant in the
proceedings.
3. My written and especially oral skills will definitely
be an asset to the position as the position of financial policy representative needs someone who can eloquently
and respectfully present the propositions of the STUDENTS and ensure that our views and concerns are paid
the attention and respect that they deserve as
Swarthmore would not be the place it is without the STUDENTS.
I know that you will consider your choices wisely and
make the right decision.
Vote Deborah for financial policy representative!!!

Jason Yamada-Hanff 'O7
The Swarthmore academic curriculum is currently
experiencing great changes. The switch from PDC to W
courses, the associated changes to distribution and
course requirements, and departmental additions and
growth (e.g., Africana and Islamic studies) are pressing
issues that directly affect the student body and the
nature of Swarthmore's education. I have an appreciation for the importance of these issues and a belief in
strong student participation in curricular decisions. As
educational policy representative, I will act as a voice of
the student body in administrative and faculty discussions on these issues and will work to ensure that stu-

dents remain informed about the substance of those discussions.
Broad curricular changes have also heightened the
need for communication of pertinent and timely information on departmental websites. I would like to work
with the council on a plan to improve the usefulness and
availability of such information on Web sites and to give
departments the resources necessary to implement this
plan. Also, recent changes to policy have made the van
and shuttle system unable to meet the needs of student
groups and off-campus dorm residents. I would work to
make sure that all concerned students have consistent
and convenient access to van and shuttle service.

Bryan Lantz 'O6
The financial policy representative is a vital cog in
this giant educational factory known as Swarthmore.
This position calls for someone with strong leadership
qualities, a deep knowledge of campus operations and
gusto. I am that someone. My goals as financial policy
representative will be to act as the voice of the student
body in College Budget Committee meetings and to
ensure that an open channel of communication exists
between the College Budget Committee and Student
Council. Please vote for me, Bryan Lantz, the man with
gusto.

"I think we should be able to

The Garnet Tide has been

moves to 2-2 in Centennial
Conference action. Jackie Kahn
'O4 and Ele Forbes 'O5 each tallied four goals to lead the

Swarthmore also overpow

game against Cedar Crest was
cancelled, and the Mules will not
have participated in a playdate

"We're looking to take each

and play our best game every

since, his quickness around the tackles and his ease

in hitting the holes in a four-carry, 30-yard performance

against Muhlenberg in 2000 really turned scouts' heads.
The Patriots think he's worth the risk.
10. Steve Cook, Houston Texans, DL. Cook is not

the prototypical defensive lineman. Entering college as
the backup kickoff specialist and running back, the s'l"
Cook switched to the defensive line after his first year.
A wrestling champion in high school, Cook displayed
the power to match up against 325-lb. offensive lineman.

'Cook is the originator of the widely known but seldom
used "Cook Move," where he crawls under the legs of
the offensive lineman and pressures the quarterback.
Only tackles as spry as Cook's are able to perfect the

maneuver.

With the NFL Draft right around the corner on April 24 and 25,
teams are beginning to hone in on their potential draft picks, as
individual workouts are scheduled and teams are focusing on their
areas of need.

Unfortunately, this year, as in all previous years of the draft, no

Swarthmore athletes will be selected. With the elimination of the
football program three years ago,
our school's top prospects were
unable to develop to their full potential. However, below I have included
a mock draft for this year's top 10
picks, a what-would-have-been had
Benedict Bloom kept the program
intact. Though my hair may not be
as tall or as sleeked as Mel Kiper
Jr.'s, my knack for evaluating college talent is right on par.

1. Ryan Pannorfi, Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, OLB. In a stunning
move, the Bucs will trade Brad
Johnson and their first-round pick

CARLTON DAVIS

Rounding Third

to the

Chargers to draft Ryan

Pannorfi, a four-year starter and a
hard-hitting, quick, intelligent linebacker out of Monsignor Donovan
High School in Toms River, N.J.
One hurdle the Bucs must over-

come is a commitment from Pannorfi to focus exclusively on foot-

ball. A two-sport athlete, he is expected to be drafted in the middle
rounds of baseball's amateur draft in June.
*
2. Matt Williams, Oakland Raiders, WR. In a draft deep in
receiving, the Raiders will fill a position of need by choosing the
best Williams, Matt, who eclipses Roy, Mike and Reggie. A track
star as well, the versatile 6'5" Williams combines his speed and

height with excellent hands and will make for a formidable deep
threat in Norv Turner's offense.
3. Chris Loeffler, Arizona Cardinals, QB. Chris is the top-rated
quarterback on this year's draft board, and the Cardinals need
somebody who can consistently get the ball to Anquan Boldin. If
Chris can make passing decisions half as good on the football field
as he does on the basketball court, he will be a shoo-in for Offensive

Rookie of the Year.
4. Nick Borunda, New York Giants, OL. The Giants desperately
need help on the offensive line, and they are kicking themselves for
passing over three-time All-American Matt Rapoza in last year's
draft. Though Borunda has been known to take plays off and is
somewhat out of shape, he is a promising prospect who should help
the depleted Giants line immediately.
i»
5. Wes Sconce, Washington Redskins, S. Although Sean
Taylor is considered by many the best athlete and overall top
prospect in this year's draft, the fifth pick is considered high to
draft a safety. Enter Wes Sconce, known in draft circles as the White
Ronnie Lott. The Redskins won't be able to pass up this hometown
favorite, as Sconce will step in and immediately make a strong
impact on this Joe Gibbs-coached defense.
6. Kevin Perry, Detroit Lions, OLB. A year after drafting linebacker Boss Bailey, the Lions will again turn heads and upgrade the
middle of their defense with Kevin Perry. KP reminds scouts of
pre-ACL tear Jeremiah Trotter, who was one of the best in the game
at hitting the hole and stopping the run. Look for an immensely
improved Lions defense with this strong linebacking corps.
7. Michael DeFillipo, Cleveland Browns, TE. Originally a wide
receiver, "The Flip Show" made the switch to tight end his sophomore year in college after putting on 45ibs. of muscle in the off-season. An outstanding pass blocker who can also be used as a fullback
Jn running situations, DeFillipo promises to be a welcomed addition to a depleted Browns offense. Though DeFillipo drops more
passes than Jeremy Shockey, Browns President and CEO Carmen
Policy has been quoted as saying DeFillipo has more raw talent
than anyone at the position since John Mackey, and he is not concerned in the least.

8. Jared Passmore, Buffalo Bills, QB. The backup quarterback
his first two seasons at Swarthmore, Passmore got his chance to
play his junior year when starter Chris Loeffler 'O4 suffered a torn
labrum. He quickly impressed, garnering Conference Player of the
Year recognition as well as an Honorable Mention All-America.
Also a punter in college with the leg and smarts to kick in the pros,
Passmore is the second-rated passer in this year's draft. His versatility will be a strong addition to the Bills, who could also use him
as a member of the special teams.
9. Dan Chamberlain, New England Patriots, RB. The Patriots
will trade their two first round picks to the Jaguars for the ninth
overall pick in order to acquire local running back star Dan
Chamberlain. Though Chamberlain was rumored to have failed a
drug test his sophomore year in college and hasn't played a snap

Evil Buzzards falter against Ursinus

Rugby to take on Susquehana at home Saturday
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's rugby team lost to Ursinus last
Saturday, falling to the Bears 19-5 in an overall lackluster performance at Cunningham Field.
Throughout the match the Evil Buzzards failed to
capitalize on several large opportunities to record
tries, as Ursinus played tough defense within the
ten-yard mark. While Swarthmore had the opportunities to change the game, Ursinus managed to hold

off the more talented Evil Buzzards for the entire
game.
After falling behind 5-0 at the half, Swarthmore
managed to tie the game at the start of the second half
with a try by Michael DeFillipo 'O4, but then Ursinus
ran away with game, scoring 14 unanswered points to
swamp the team.
Tevye Kelman 'O6 noted the team's lack of energy
and motivation, rather than talent, as deciding factors
in the game. "We didn't have any passion," he said. "In
terms of skill, we were much better than Ursinus, but
every opportunity that we had to score we just came
up short on. We didn't ruck very well, and they were
April

15, 2004

able to stop us. Every time they got close they were
able to bowl over us. They just wanted to win more
than we did."
Many on the team blamed the loss on a lack of focus
and desire, as it seemed the team didn't have the
desire needed to win the match over an Ursinus team
they had consistently beaten over the past couple seasons.
"Everyone had a bad game; that was my take,"
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 said. "We've beat this team
before, I think we were just too confident going into
the game. I think it was more of a mental loss than a

physical loss."
The Evil Buzzards are preparing to take on
Susquehanna this Saturday in what promises to be a
hard fought game. The team will take to Cunningham
Field at 1 p.m.
"Individually, a lot of guys have played well, but
we've had difficulty coming together as a unit," Randy
Goldstein 'O5 said. "We've been working hard this
week; Susquehanna is a team we're capable of beating.
It's a matter of putting the work into it."
The Evil Buzzards are also scheduled to finish out
the season against Widener April 24.

Softball unable to overcome Gettysburg, Rutgers-Camden
BY COLTON BANGS

cbangsl@swarthmore.edu

In an 0-3 week, Garnet softball (5-15-1,16-1 CC) dropped a pair of games on
Saturday to Gettysburg and was shut out
against Rutgers-Camden last Thursday.
The Tide has now dropped its past five
games, giving up 35 runs and scoring only
two. Despite a lack of offensive prowess ,
a strong showing in the second game of
the Gettysburg doubleheader left the team
confident heading into the second half of
the season.
The Garnet has been plagued by poor
fielding errors and hitting in the past few
games. Gettysburg came into the doubleheader at 4-0 in the conference and left the
field chalking up another win. In the first
game, Gettysburg used a six-run third
inning, to blow by the Garnet, eventually
taking the game 8-0. Strong pitching by
Bullets pitcher Shannon Kiry limited the
Garnet to only four hits to the Tide.
The second game was a different story.
Marianne Klingaman 'O7 carried the
Swarthmore defense with great pitching,
holding the Bullets scoreless in the second through ninth innings. After the first
nine innings she had only given up six
hits. The Swarthmore bats also served the
Garnet Tide well for the first time in five
games. After the Bullets took the lead
with a first inning solo home run, the
Garnet fired back in the third inning
when Klingaman drove in Kelly Siano 'O7
with a two-out single to take the lead at 21. The Garnet carried the close game all
the way into the 10th inning until the
Bullets broke free. Gettysburg exploded
for a five-hit, five-run inning to take the
game with a final score of 7-2.
"We played really solid defense from the
second to the ninth innings. It was a mental battle and we kind of lost focus in the
10th and allowed them to capitalize by getting people on base. From that, the momentum kind of switched over to them,"
Klingaman said.
Klingaman pitched all 10 innings in the

game, giving up six earned runs on 10 hits.
Siano led the offensive charge going
three for five with one run. Mary Mintel
'O5 had a pair of hits and a run for the
Garnet, who had the most offensive production in five games.
"I think [the lack of offense] has been a
lack of confidence and some good pitch-

The Garnet faced a strong RutgersCamden squad last Thursday. Scarlet

Danielle Miller 'O6 hit the spoiler, forcing an error in the top of the seventh with
two outs to ruin the perfect game. The

Tide didn't have a snippet of offense
in the meeting and lost 6-0 in the
non-conference game.
"We did face a couple of really good

pitchers, especially at Rutgers, but we have
either been hitting the ball right to people
or not hitting the ball when we have runners on base," Klingaman said.
As far as defense, the Garnet certainly
has a few loose ends to tie up. Errors have

Mickelson Big
Last weekend we saw an event so improbable, so amazing, so
unthinkable that it easily ranks as the biggest sports story so far this
year. Yes, we are referring to the victory by Phil Mickelson in the
Masters golf tournament last Sunday. And yes, we mean it when we say
it was the biggest story this year. College football ended with a split
championship. Lame. The Patriots won the Super Bowl. Boring. UConn
won the men's and women's basketball championships. OK, that's a
pretty big story. But c'mon. It's UConn. They have the best female bas
ketball player in the country, and they got the best male basketball play
er in the country. So, yeah, winning both championships the same year
is big, but not Mickelson Big. Let's see 'em go 0-for-42 in championship
games and then win a championship. That would be Mickelson Big. (By
the way, by "biggest sports story so far this year," we meant "biggest
good sports story so far this year." So keep the steroids out of this.)
So does Mickelson's win change every
thing in the sports world? Yes, it does

Everything has changed completely, and
we cannot go back. The repercussions are
enormous and unpredictable. But we are
now living in a new world. A world post

Mickelson. For now, the last shall be first
and the meek shall inherit champi
onships. It is now the Year of the
Mickelson.

BEN WHARTON
90% Half Mental

And to inaugurate the Year of the
Mickelson, we here at 90% Half Menta
will give you, our loyal readers, some
thing of a history lesson. For in the shad
ows of the Dark Ages pre-Mickelson, we
shall find the harbingers of an uncertain

future.
In the Year of the Mickelson, certain
teams, from now on known as Mickelson
Teams, will follow the example of their
prophet and shall throw off their chains o
defeat. The definition of the Mickelson Team is not precise and is prone
to the vagaries of interpretation. One possible definition of a Mickelson
Team is a team that has never Won the Big One. No championships since
birth. Another definition is the team that has kept its fans suffering for

an arbitrarily long period of time.

Here at 90% Half Mental, the period is set at 48 years, thus stretching
Among these categories there exist many Mickelson
Teams. Fifty-five, actually. Thirteen in the MLB, 11 in the NFL, 15 in the
NBA and 16 in the NHL. But of these 55 there can only be a few that fit
ihe most narrow definition of the Mickelson Team. The Best Team That
Has Never Won the Big One. And now that it is the Year of the
Mickelson, it is these select Mickelson Teams that shall follow
Mickelson's Path to greatness.
In the NHL, the Mickelson Team is the Tampa Bay Lightning. After 12
years of mostly abject misery, the Lightning are poised to make a deep run
at the playoffs. Now that we are post-Mickelson, it seems inevitable that
the Lightning will take the Cup. Which would be a shame for the Los
Angeles Kings and the St. Louis Blues, both of which have been Cupless
since they were birthed in 1967.
In the NBA, Mickelson seems to have paved the way for the Minnesota
Timberwolves to rise from 15 years of disappointment. With the NBA's
likely MVP, Kevin Garnett, and a top-flight supporting cast, the T-Wolves
have got to be the Mickelson-Age favorites. Too bad for the Nuggets,
who've been out in the cold since they were born as the ABA Denver
Rockets in 1967.
The NFL has the fewest Mickelson Teams, thanks to a new age of parity and a history of NFL and pre-merger-AFL championships. With that
in mind, the Indianapolis Colts are the Mickelson Heirs. Yes, they won
plenty of championships in Baltimore. But a team is only a team in relation to a fan base, and there aren't too many Indianapolitans who cared
about the 1958, 1959 and 1970 championships that the Baltimore Colts
won. They probably care more about the 20 years the Colts have been in
Indianapolis sans championship. The Vikings, however, win the prize
for eternal suffering, having been an empty, hollow franchise since their
inception in 1961.
At last, baseball. The American pastime, where the tradition of
tragedy is unyielding amongst a certain three franchises. The miserable
fans of the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox have
seen in Mickelson a true prophet, whose appearance heralds the arrival
of postseason triumphs. Sadly for these fans, with their combined 269
years of despair, the coming of Mickelson does not spell an end to their
grief. For the true heir to Mickelson among the MLB teams is not the
Cubs, or the Sox or the Sox. It is instead the Astros, the Best Team to
Never Win the Big One. So come October, the first October PostTickelson, the suffering shall surely continue for Boston and Chicago,
while the city of Houston thanks Phil Mickelson for changing the world
of sports forever.

Dan Chamberlain waits for the pitch during the Garnet's 0-13 loss to Ursinus last Friday.

Tide falls to Terror, Bears
BY MATT SCHILLER

mschilll@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet baseball team could not end conference woes this week as it struggled through a
stretch of four games against conference opponents. Ursinus took the second half of the season
series, shutting out the Tide 0-13, while McDaniel
swept the Tide 12-3 and 5-2 in a double header.
Swarthmore was scheduled to play six games
in eight days, but contests against Muhlenberg
and Washington were rained out. The team still
has four postponed games to make up during the
remainder of the season, which will test its
endurance.

"Getting rained out doesn't hurt. What hurts
is when we have to reschedule the games," Cliff
Sosin 'O4 said. "Instead of playing four games a
week, we're playing six games a week, and that's

a Major League schedule."

On Friday afternoon, Ursinus caught fire
against Swarthmore. Their bats lit up the Garnet
pitching staff, and Bear pitching ace Ryan Bowen
threw a complete game one-hit shutout that
included 18 strikeouts.
"He was the best pitcher we've seen this
year," coach Frank Agovino said. "The kid
pitched a good ballgame."
Starter Matt Goldstein 'O4 (0-4) allowed four
earned runs and struck out six in seven and a
third innings of work to keep the game close for
the first few innings.
The Tide traveled to western Maryland for a
doubleheader against McDaniel but came home
empty. Sloppy fielding got the best of
Swarthmore in the first game. Seven errors led to

three unearned runs, and Jared Leiderman 'O5 (24) could not hold back the floodgates as the Green
Terror scored seven runs in the first three
innings to put the game away. Leiderman was
erratic, throwing nine strikeouts but also giving
up 12 hits and two walks. Ryan Pannorfi 'O4 provided the offense going 2-for-4 with an RBI double.
"It was a strange game, because while we had
some errors we made some great plays, too,"
Ago vino said.
During the early stages of the second game,
luck appeared to turn around for the Tide.
Pannorfi got the bats going with a lead-off triple,
and Carlton Davis 'O4 brought him home with an
RBI single. Later in the inning Sam Faeder 'O7
singled in Davis, and Swarthmore was off and
running with a 2-0 lead.
In an all-too-familiar occurrence, errors
became the Garnet's undoing. McDaniel tied the
game with two unearned runs in the third. It
added two more unearned runs in the fourth to
take the lead for good. The Tide committed four

total errors. Noah Cooper-Harris 'O7 (0-2) allowed
only one earned run over six innings but still
took the loss. Pannorfi continued to have the hot

bat, going three-for-four from the plate.
"We have to hit the ball," Leiderman said.
"Every game we have one or two guys hitting,
but that's not enough to put runs on the board.
We need to get loose at the plate and start hitting
as a team."
Swarthmore (2-13,1-8 CC) took on Washington
yesterday, but results were unavailable at press
time. The Garnet clash with the Shoremen again
on Friday afternoon.
