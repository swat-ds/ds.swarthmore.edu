Students protest
invasion of Iraq
No 'business as usual' for
those against the war
BY SARAH STANTON

stanton@sccs.swarthmore.edu

Since the United States began the invasion of Iraq last
week, student responses have ranged from large protests
to candlelight vigils to confusion and uncertainty. Yet
many students agree that, even though the Bush administration appeared to ignore the peace movement prior to
the war, now is not the time to remain silent about concern over conflict in Iraq and U.S. foreign policy.
In the early days of the war, two Swarthmore students
were arrested for acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the
Philadelphia area. On Wednesday, March 19, Micah White
'O4 was arrested and released for obstructing traffic on the
Baltimore Pike.
The next day, Matt Armstrong 'O5 joined a group of
about a hundred people who blocked the entrances to the
Philadelphia federal building last Thursday morning. He
was arrested, detained for several hours and released the
same day on charges of "unreasonably obstructing a building," according to Armstrong.
Harris Kornstein 'O6 was also present at the federal
building, joining several Swarthmore students who
protested or served as trained legal observers for the
American Civil Liberties Union. "The idea was no business as usual," Kornstein said.
Armstrong and fellow protesters gathered in groups at
each of the entrances to the federal building, effectively
barring both officials and people who had business in the
building from entering. Throughout the morning, protesters stationed at Armstrong's door wove together strips
from Iraqi and U.S. flags as a symbolic gesture of human
connection. "It was important to present a constructive
vision of hope instead of only a negative cry of revolt,"
Armstrong said.
While Armstrong's group agreed to cooperate with
police officers, other protesters made their bodies limp

during the arrest, causing reports of police officers dragging people around. In general, Armstrong found the
police to be fairly easy to work with and had several con-

versations with officers about the war and their lives. He
was released with a maximum of a $250 fine and a court
date to follow.
Armstrong said that he did not take the decision to
engage in civil disobedience lightly but had been considering it for months. Although Armstrong had wondered
whether civil disobedience might be counterproductive,
when the United States attacked Iraq last week, he felt he
wanted to be involved "in a way that pushes the lawfulness of dissent." He said that he joined the group blocking
the federal building "in an effort to bear witness to the
depth of injustice, unlawfulness, violence and criminality

of this war."

Engaging in civil disobedience takes "great personal
risk," Al Bradbury 'O5 said. "It's not just about a statement, but about making it harder for the machine to operate." While she hasn't participated in any acts of civil dis-

obedience herself, Bradbury says she is considering it.
"The president doesn't even pretend he's listening to the
opinion of the populace," so people may have to begin to

take more drastic actions, she said.
Armstrong speaks positively about his experience, both
in terms of the conversations he had with people who
approached the building and in terms of his own relationship with the peace movement. He described a close connection with other protesters, who he said was "unbelievably humble" about their role in the larger realm of antiwar activities. "I feel like the time I spent helped me
rethink my relationship to the war and the U.S. government and what my actions will be about," he said.
White declined to comment on his arrest.

Student Council
approves next
year's budget
Student groups will receive

$384,887.60 next year under the

budget approved 8 to 2 by Student
Council Tuesday night.
Student Budget Committee presented the budget to the council
after hearing appeals. Most small
groups had a "negligible" increase in
funding, according to SBC Treasurer
Jeff Traczynski 'O4.
Unlike in past years, only one
group came before the council to
appeal the amount of money SBC
had alloted it. SASA, the group for
African students on campus, had its
budget cut in half after failing to
send a representative to spring
budgeting. The council denied the
appeal, though some council members expressed concerns that he
penalty for failing to show at spring
budgeting was unfair. The penalty is
intended to encourage groups to
show up for some face time to discuss their group's budget with SBC
members, Traczynski said at the
meeting.

Williams resigns as athletic director
College selects associate director as replacement
BY ULLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Bob Williams stepped down as athletic director this week, opting to continue as chair of the physical education department but
give up his administrative duties. Adam Hertz, hired two years
ago as associate athletic director, will fill the position.
Hertz said he was happy with how Williams had run the
department for the last 16 years. "I don't see the need for anything
to change significantly at this time," he said. "We're going to continue improving the culture of athletics, the quality of the programs, and the facilities."
Baseball coach Frank Agovino said the whole athletic department was behind Hertz, whose appointment is effective immedi-

ately. "Everybody likes him," Agovino said.
According to Agovino, Hertz's understands the college's "limited resources" in terms of attracting prospective student athletes
but still wants to field winning teams. "Winning is an important
part of athletics," Agovino said, and Hertz recognizes that "you
can't have a positive experience if you're always losing."
Karen Borbee, assistant athletics director and women's
lacrosse coach, said she thought the department has shown a
greater commitment to competitiveness since the Athletic
Review Committee's decision to cut football. Men's soccer coach
Eric Wagner said that "the iron is hot for us to make a lot of
progress in terms of competitiveness."
Amy Brunner, women's soccer coach and intramurals director,
said the athletic department "knew Bob was going to retire" and
hoped Hertz would give the department a higher profile among
high school students and develop the strength of the program.
The college did not conduct a job search before hiring Hertz.
According to President Al Bloom, "normal procedure for a staff
position is, through consultation, to decide whether there are
current staffmembers who have the qualifications and the potential for excellence to fill an open staff position and, if there are
internal candidates, then to give first consideration to them."
In this case, Provost Connie Hungerford interviewed all athletic department staff and several people from outside the department, including JimBock '9O, admissions dean, after finding out
two months ago that Williams wanted to resign.
According to Bloom, there was a "strong consensus of those

interviewed that Adam would be an excellent choice."
Students did not take part in the process, but Bloom said some
had come to him on their own. "Those who came made enthusi-

astic comments about Hertz," he said. Bloom praised Hertz, saying he had a "remarkable ability to work with and inspire others,
quickly earns their trust for his fairness and integrity, loves
sports, values excellence, brings high energy and good humor,
and understands the ways in which athletics can maximally support and contribute to fine liberal arts education."
Students did take part in the committee that hired Hertz as
associate athletic director in a national search two years ago.
Hertz said his two years at Swarthmore had revealed to him
that it takes a "very special person" to balance academic and athletic demands at Swarthmore.
"From an athletic standpoint, I think Swarthmore is different from any other campus in the country," he said. For example, he said, it is rare for student athletes at other colleges to
take time offfrom their teams for study abroad, which is com-

mon at Swarthmore.
The position of athletic director, a staff job, now holds "faculty status," which means the director will attend faculty meetings,

vote on faculty measures and report to the provost. Though the
status is new, Bob Williams did have faculty responsibilities,
since was a physical education professor while athletic director.
The college implemented this change for the sake of continuity
and because physical education faculty report to the athletic

director as well as the provost.
Other college staff who hold "faculty status" are Registrar
Martin Warner and College Librarian Peggy Seiden, whose work
the college recognizes as having a "direct relationship to the educational mission." The college wanted to provide the same recog-

nition to athletics.
Hertz said teaching or coaching were "certainly a possibility"
but that he wanted to take time to settle into his administrative
work first. Hertz coached soccer and golf and taught sports management for five years at Alvernia College in Reading, where he
was also athletic director.
Karen Borbee said Williams' resignation was not a surprise

and that she was "looking forward to Adam taking over" since he
would look for new ways to improve the department.
Williams said he had stepped down as athletic director
because he thought it would be "a good time to give the department a chance for new leadership."
"We've been through a challenging time with the restructuring of our intercollegiate athletic program that followed the football cut," Williams said.

Since the cuts, the department Williams directed has improved
facilities, renovating the Mullan Fitness Center lobby, installing a
new floor in Tarble Pavilion, starting renovation on the track, and
resurfacing Clothier field with a synthetic grass surface (see story,
pg. 22). Williams has also hired head coaches in field hockey,
men's soccer, volleyball, women's tennis and baseball.
Baseball coach Frank Agovino said his impression was that
Williams "understands that it's time for a new approach."
Williams will now function as the athletic department adviser
to club sports and continue as a Ware professor of physical education and athletics, the endowed position he held while athletic
director. He will also function as the faculty athletic representative to athletic conferences, such as the NCAA and ECAC.
Bloom praised the work Williams had done, saying he had
"built a very strong department and took central leadership in
the recent restructuring and re-energizing of our intercollegiate
athletics program, including the hiring ofadditional coaches and
the renewal of facilities."
Men's basketball coach Lee Wimberly said, "Bob Williams has
done a fine job during his tenure as athletic director at
Swarthmore. The student athletes at Swarthmore are much better funded, equipped, coached, and transported than they were
prior to Bob's arrival here."
The college hired Williams 16 years ago as head men's track
and field coach and athletic director, but he soon moved to fulltime administrative work, overseeing the college's intercollegiate athletics, intramurals, recreational sports, athletic facilities
and physical education department as the athletic director. Still,
he remained a part ofthe track coaching staff until two years ago,
most recently acting as coach for the jumpers.
Williams described the highlights of his time here as "seeing
our student athletes being successful with handling the rigors of
academics here and doing an excellent job in athletics" as well as
"being a witness to how they've always displayed excellent
sportsmanship." He is most proud, he said, of "putting together
one of the best coaching staffs in the country."

windows give it an open, bright feel. The
room has a view onto the campus and the
front of old Dupont, where a woodland
fhemed garden will be landscaped.

Some students might remember the
pieces of glass with dot grids of varying sizes
that were displayed in Kohlberg last year.
Merz explained that it is called frigid glass,
and it appears opaque from the outside preventing birds from flying into it. Not all the
glass panels are frigid glass, but the difference is barely noticeable. Concern that these
panels would make the indoor light splotchy
or murky has been assuaged. "It's pretty
innocuous," Merz said.

While the walls, ceiling and floors of the

commons are roughly complete, more
detailed work like finishing the coffee bar

and putting in furniture remains to be done.
Despite the dust, Merz said that the opening
of a sushi bar is not much further in the
campus's

future.
Other than new eating opportunities,
some special features of this section of the
building include a study nook off to the side
of the main room with the same floor-to-ceiling windows. On the other side, there is a
large classroom that also takes advantage of
these windows and one wall of silver stone
like that on the outdoor walls of Kohlberg.
The plants in the garden will be local to
incorporate it into the Crum's ecosystem.

The outside walls along the garden are
black granite that can be used as chalkboards for sunny days when classes are held
outdoors.
The building also includes a 200-seat lecture room featuring large, comfortable
chairs with wider tablet arms than Kirby's,
an extensive sound system and down lights
over every seat, Merz said. For teaching and
entertainment, the room also has one large

screen or two smaller screens that come
down from the ceiling. This, along with
three panels of sliding chalkboards, will help
facilitate professors' complex multimedia
presentations. All seats are wired so that
they can be installed with power ports for
laptops, though this option is being reserved

March 27, 2003

for the future.
Walking out from the lecturehall there is
another garden area in front of the old
Dupont building.

A monolithic awning
structure marks the entrance to this area.
Semler described it as looking the same as
the old entrance to Dupont only "on

steroids."

Across the way is the new chemistry
wing, with an 80-seat lecture room and
upstairs observation room with a large telescope. There is also a terrace that provides
an impressive view of the tops of Kohlberg,
Martin, Beardsley and Trotter. There are
small shoulder height columns where moveble telescopes can be brought out by students to observe the stars.

Multicultural Education Hall faces criticism

Group of students circulating petition in protest brings concerns to Housing Committee

lottery

Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal

held two meetings Monday to clarify new
housing options, a substance-free dorm and
a multicultural education hall.
The first meeting dealt with Woolman
House, designated as substance-free for
this year's housing lottery. There are eight
doubles and three singles in the dorm. The
rooms in Woolman will be grouped as block
housing, and students who apply to live
there will not be able to apply for other
blocks.
The deans had approved the dorm on
the condition that that its students commit
to a "substance-free lifestyle" rather than
just substance-free living space. Several

students at the meeting did not understand
what this term meant, and Westphal said
the vagueness would allow next year's
group of substance-free students to define
it more clearly.
Seven students at the meeting indicated
that they were interested in substance-free
housing. If the 22 spaces in the dorm are
not filled, or if there is not an even gender
balance, the housing would no longer be a

numbers.

Westphal did not take the low turnout as
a show of low interest in substance-free
housing. "It's hard to tell who came versus
how many were interested," she said.

Multicultural Education Hall
Jonathan Rosa 'O3, a creator of the multicultural education hall, acknowledged
that the meeting was held partly to deal
with confusion over the purpose of the hall.
Rosa said he wanted to clarify that the
hall was not specifically "for people who
are multiracial or for minorities. It's for

bringing different people together."
Bill Wanjohi 'O5, who was also involved
in the creation of the hall, said the goal of
the hall was social justice. He said students
living in the hall would have discussions
related to multiculturalism.
Two students who were opposed to the
hall's creation came to the meeting to
explain their concerns. Anna Morgan 'O4
and William Tran 'O3 had circled a petition
opposing the hall, garnering 324 signatures
from students and faculty.
When asked about the petition,

Westphal said, "It's never crossed my desk,
but they asked me to sign it when I walked
into Sharpies."
Morgan said she would give the petition
to the deans within the next two days.
Morgan and Tran said they had five
major problems with the multicultural
education hall, all of which they had listed
on their petition. One problem was with
the process, Tran said. They thought the
deans should have polled the student body
about the hall, which a group of students

did for substance-free housing.
Tran said another problem was the college's general policy of opposing "themed"
housing. He cited difficulties that he and
other students who had campaigned for
coed rooms had encountered several years
ago. The administration's argument had
been that coed rooms were a form of
themed housing. Tran said he and Morgan
were surprised at how quickly the administration had approved the multicultural
education hall.
Tran and Morgan also had questions
about the criteria for selecting students
but that seeing the application prepared
for the hall had cleared this up somewhat.
Another complaint was that the isolation

quality of valuable informal discussions"
on the topic, according to their petition.
In the petition, Tran and Morgan also
said the hall was an example of students
supplementing attempts that the administration should make to promote multicul-

turalism.

Morgan said that the meeting was helpful but that "a lot of issues weren't
addressed."
In response

to Morgan and Tran's
questions, Wanjohi stressed that the
implementation of the hall this year

would be a trial.
Westphal added that, while Housing
Committee had not unanimously supported the hall, collectively it had felt that the
hall was "more worth the trying than not
trying."

Westphal said that, because the housing
had already been approved, "the petition is
too late to affect this year." Westphal
acknowledged that the petition had "got
people talking," and said that she was
"glad people cared enough" to petition
against it.

Although the scope of this group

Pope said she hoped to "focus

"perhaps there should be more of

"Even though this is a
moment of crisis," Hetland said,
"it is also a moment of opportunity" to examine important
questions of how this war came

Hetland still sees large anti-

HOPING FOR AN END TO WAR
On the night of Thursday, March 20, when the United States began its invasion of Iraq, students gathered in a vigil for peace. Gatherers held candles
and sang "This Little Light of Mine."

A Public Safety e-mail on
March 19 said that two more
thefts of a wallet and a credit card, one in Parrish and
one in Martin, were reported
on March 17.
The e-mail said that
"theft of unattended property has always been the most
frequently committed crime

our campus."
It advised students to
"always secure your personal (and college) belongings."
Public Safety has been
looking into trails of credit
card use, as each of the six

He has "always loved the music of
Scotland," though he didn't learn to play
the bagpipes until the summer after he
graduated from high school. While he was
often too busy at Swarthmore to devote
much time to practicing, he played extensively in the summer, often traveling to
Ontario from his native Potsdam, N.Y., for
lessons.
Easter was also able to travel to Scotland
in January 2002 to study bagpipe music. It
was this trip that inspired him to apply for a
Watson Fellowship.
After a rigorous application process,
including two personal interviews, Easter
was notified in mid-March that he had been
selected from a national pool of 200 appli-

cants.

Easter described the realization that he
would be going to Scotland to pursue his

exciting and slightly terrifying."

Easter has many goals for next year,
which he sums up as "exploring the topic of
bagpiping." A central objective is to improve
his musical skills by studying under master
bagpipers. In addition, Easter wants to experience the life and culture of Scotland, conduct historical research and perhaps even
study Scotch Gaelic.
"I am hoping to talk to the carriers of the
tradition to get at what's in the music I've
been studying from afar," he said.
One of his central concerns is the written
music of the bagpipe. "Piping generally suffers from one major problem," Easter said.
"The music written down doesn't correspond to what is actually played. Often, the
rhythm and phrasing are completely different, and the written notes serve only as a
The bagpipe tradition, however, is not a
form of improvisation. Instead, it is a strict
auditory tradition that cannot be mastered
through sheet music alone. Easter hopes to
learn from masters how they pass the tradition down through generations.
"The kinds of things that I want to learn
about aren't taught in universities," Easter
said.
The Watson Fellowship, established in
1968, awards up to 60 individuals from 50 participating colleges and universities nationwide a stipend of $22,000 for one year of travel outside of the United States to pursue an

culture," he said.

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

In honor of retiring philosophy professor Hugh Lacey, a
symposium entitled "Science, Values and Society" took
place last Friday and Saturday. The symposium covered a
wide range of topics, from the social role of the university
to the values of popular movements. There were five topics
overall, with a different visiting scholar speaking on each.
The conference themes were all subjects that Lacey has
done a large amount of work on. Lacey was very pleased
with the conference.
"It was to me a real pleasure to hear people talking on
a range of topics all of which have been important to me,"
he said.
The conference generated a fair amount of original
thought that Lacey found particularly exciting. "I am
always delighted when people take my ideas and go further
with them," he said.
Dr. Richard Lewontin, from the Harvard University
Museum of Comparative Zoology, spoke first on Saturday.
He commented on the political economy of agricultural
research.
He began by making the point that agriculture is a capitalistic endeavor and should be considered as such.
"Agriculture is as penetrated by capital as anything," he

said.

To increase profits, Lewontin said, many organizations
invest in agricultural research. Lewontin questioned the
merits of biology being used as a way to secure one's prop-

erty rights.
He gave the example of seed "terminator technology,"
where seeds are genetically modified so that subsequent
generations can't reproduce. This way, "seed-men" can
make a better profit. These stories are not exceptions, but
part of what Lewontin finds to be a disturbing trend.

Lewontin said that only seed producers benefit from
this new technology, which actually puts farmers and consumers at a disadvantage. Lewontin noted the fact that the
production of the "terminator technology" was government funded, and he questioned the value system of the
United States Department of Agriculture in making such

an investment.

"I am always delighted when people
take my ideas and go
further with them."
Hugh Lacey, philosophy professor
"Why would the USDA invest money to research something whose only effect is to protect the property of its creators?" he said.

Amy Vollmer, a Swarthmore professor of biology, commented on Lewontin's speech. She agreed that it was
important to consider why scientists conduct certain
research. She suggested everyone ask, "How did we as
biologists get here, and where are we going?"
Vollmer noted that recent progress in agriculture is due
to advances made in molecular biology. Unfortunately,
molecular biology is a highly specialized field, and, consequently, these specialists often don't consider the moral
consequences of their work.
"Specialization has served them well, but the myopia
that has resulted has been pretty devastating," Vollmer

said.

It was Vollmer's hope that students learn from Lacey's

College condemns
meddling with flag
BY SUE CHEN
schenl@swarthmore.edu

In response to the black flag that flew
atop Parrish Hall last week, Maurice
Eldridge '6l, a college vice president, issued
a statement clarifying the college's policy
toward flying the flag.

"I think it's bloody foolish
to climb out of the window
over there. I'm scared to
death someone's going to
fall off."
Maurice Eldridge '6l,
vice president
The statement stressed that student
action involving the American flag, such as
lowering the flag to half-staff, "would
require the administration's approval.
Swarthmore does not intend to grant such

approval."
As an American institution, the college
accepts federal protocol when it flies the
country's flag. It is inappropriate to fly
another flag with the American flag, accord-

ing to federal regulations.
Safety was another concern. There were
no signs of break-in on the door leading to
the flagpole, but Eldridge thought somebody
must have climbed out of a window and
walked across the ledge to get to the flagpole.
"I think it's bloody foolish to climb out of
the window over there," Eldridge said. "I'm

March 27, 2003

scared to death somebody is going to
fall off."
Although no one has claimed responsi-

bility for early Thursday's incident, the tim-

ing indicated that students had flown the
black flag under the American one in
protest of the war in Iraq, Eldridge said.
Eldridge's statement encourages students to find more "appropriate means of
expressing their concern about, support for
or disapproval of the military action in Iraq.
The college fully supports campus initiatives which lead to informed debate and
opportunities to learn more about the war

and its likely aftermath."
The college also received a call from a
Swarthmore parent who has a child in the
war and was "shocked and mortified at the
thought the college might sanction something disrespectful of other people's feelings," Eldridge said.

Eldridge added that there had been a
rumor in the press that the college would do
something with the flag in protest of the
war, another factor in the college's decision
to release the statement.
The black flag was removed as soon as it
came to the administration's attention.
"Should our students manage to lower the
flag without our permission, Swarthmore
will immediately restore it to full-staff," the
statement concluded.
Last month, Why War? flew a peace flag
under the American flag flying at half-staff,

which had been lowered in wake of the
Columbia explosion. When the administration became aware of the peace flag's presence, it was removed.
Swarthmore has only flown the flag for
the previous six years, following a 20 year
hiatus that began in the '6os.

Safety at N. Chester Road and College Avenue. Upon arrival, he was met by a Public
Safety officer who observed a person spray painting the intersection and was able to
point out where the person was located. The person was identified and issued two citations.
Officer Kline observed the street sign at Strath Haven and Mt. Holyoke lying along
the curb at 11:55 a.m. on March 19. The highway department was notified to recover
the pole and sign. Officer Kline was later informed that the Mt. Holyoke portion of the
sign had been stolen.
Public Works Department personnel discovered the street sign and pole stolen from
the corner of Widener Way and Swarthmore Avenue. The theft was reported to Officer
Kline on March 19 at 11:58 a.m.
On March 20 at 6:40 p.m., a passerby informed Officer Kline that there were various
graffiti at the SEPTA train station. Upon arrival at the station, he discovered the damage
along the train platform, on advertisements and along the pedestrian tunnel to Magill
Walk. The information was passed along to SEPTA and Public Safety.
Sergeant Stufflet was on routine patrol on March 23 at 1:42 a.m., traveling north on
IN. Chester Road. He observed a vehicle also traveling north continually drifting over the
yellow centerline and then driving to the shoulder of the roadway. As the car continued
on Rte. 320, it was observed making jerky and sudden turns. A substance was also
observed on the left side door of the vehicle. The operator was signaled to stop. Upon
approaching the car a strong odor of alcoholic beverage was detected. The operator
was given several field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was then placed under arrest
and charged with driving under the influence.

the fact that we make generalizations about both men and

we
were
"shocked and awed" into
watching
countless
episodes of "Sorority Life"
and Sundance Festival
champs like "Sweet Home
Alabama." Admittedly, we
didn't learn much over
break, but we did realize
this: Men and women have

very conflicting views of
what is and isn't funny. To
delve deeper into this issue, we though it best to analyze
two stereotypical girl and guy comedies.

How to Lose our Attention in ID Minutes:
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" is your typical romantic comedy. A guy and girl meet under incredible circumstances but are secretly manipulating each other, then
they fall in love, then they get mad at each other when they
realize they were manipulating each other, and then there

10

is a high-speed car chase and they fall in love again.
Credits pan in before the divorce. If you haven't seen it,
don't. We'll tell you how to lose a guy in ten days. Hang out
with him for nine days and then take him to go see "How
to Lose a Guy in 10 Days." Women across America, however, fell in love with the movie. In our recent poll, 99 percent
of women thought this movie was great! They used words
like "funny, cute and what a great butt" 1 to define this fine
cinematic accomplishment.
"Old School": Humor molded in the eyes of god2
"Old School," however, epitomizes comedic genius. For
those of you who haven't seen it, "Old School" is the story
of a bunch of 30-something guys who start a fraternity.
There was also a high-speed car chase. Not much else, nice
and simple. The movie's beauty is in its jokes. On the first
night of pledging, the members of the pledge class have
cinderblocks secured to their huevos via rope and have to
drop the cinderblocks off a ledge. Just when you think all
is safe, one cinder block goes through a manhole and the
fat kid gets pulled off a 20-foot ledge by his balls. Now that
is funny. It fits the reduced form equation for humor: a fall,
genitals, pain and a fat kid. Chris Farley won the Nobel
Peace Prize for its creation in 199 L (He beat out Mother
Theresa that year.)
So why would women rather watch "Sweet Home
Alabama" than fine cinema like "Kung Pow: Enter the
Fist"? After a few interviews, the truth about cats and dogs
was finally revealed. As Myra Vallianos 'O5 put it, "Boys
like making fun of each other because of their own inadequacies." Emiliano's mom succinctly noted, "Women are
just more sophisticated." These two comments represent
March 27, 2003

the general trend of why women think their senses of
humor are better: Men are immature, insensitive and
unsophisticated.
Needless to say, the men responded. Sonam Liberman
'O4 noted that "women don't realize that pain and suffering
can be funny." Understandably, the general male consensus was that women are too uptight and, as males, we feel
it necessary to defend this.
Girls can have problems making fun of each other without feeling hurt. We, on the other hand, refer to each other
as "fatty" or "lardo" without the least bit of hesitation.
Unfortunately for women, to truly appreciate movies like
"Old School," you have to be comfortable with a little bit of
name-calling.
The idea that women are more sophisticated really hits
the nail on the head. "Sex in the City" isn't sophisticated;
it's just about a bunch of people having lots of sex. We men
call that porn. News flash, ladies: We all watch stupid
movies. It's just that yours are about us. There is very little sophisticated humor in the world today, and most of it
can't be found in Hollywood, much less in "Sweet Home

How flicks get to campus
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

It's a Friday night. You're just not in the
mood to go into Philly, and, as for partying, your
dorm room isn't very appealing. But, of course,
you don't want to be completely socially inept,
and if you don't get an evening off, you're pretty sure you'll explode.
Then you see a poster for tonight's movie.
Maybe it's "Road to Perdition." Maybe it's "The
Hours." But whatever it is, it isn't "Principles of
Economic Policy in Post-Colonial Zimbabwe,"
and, for that reason, you'll go.
Your night of relaxation was brought to you
by 15 Swarthmore students who want nothing
more than to bring you quality entertainment
on a weekly basis: Movie Committee.
Movie Committee for the spring 2003 semester is made up of Ben Bagley 'O4, Robert Berman
'O4, Laurel Evans 'O4, Kai Xu 'O3, Gabriel
Hankins 'O3, Danielle Silverman 'O4, Christine
James 'O3, Amanda Brown-Inz 'O6, Alexis Reedy

'O5, Lauren Chiang 'O5, Kristina Pao 'O4, Andrew
Scarborough'o4 and Christine Shin 'O4.
Woot Lervisit 'O4 leads the group as chairperson and treasurer with Jonah Volk 'O3, who
is responsible for publicity. The students work
alone, without a faculty adviser, to select
movies for the college community.
So what is it that Movie Committee does?
"We don't really have an official mission statement," Lervisit said.
"But our purpose is to choose movies for the
entire campus without showing the same movie
within a four-year period." The process begins

with a committee meeting before every semester, in which committee members review
movies they have selected.
"We all select about 15 movies that we'd like
to see on campus," Robert Berman said. "From
these 15, we select any movies that were common among our choices and vote on them. If we
don't have enough movies to fill the time slots
through that process, we present other movies
at the committee meeting for review."
From these movies, the committee gets the
movies you see in the cinema or Kirby Lecture
Hall from distributors.
"We usually get our movies from a film distributor called Swink," Lervisit said. "Their
selections are usually within three movie com-

Movie Committee attempts to draw a wide

Oscar Wilde's
An Ideal
Husband
BY HEATHER DOYLE
hdoylel@swarthmore.edu

Oscar Wilde's witty drawing room
comedy opens in 1890 in aristocratic

London and finds a young Viscount
Goring preening himself before a fulllength looking glass. He declares,
"Fashion is what one wears oneself. What
is unfashionable is what other people
wear." He then takes a head-first dive into
the curling and light-hearted plot of this
weekend's production of "An Ideal
Husband."
Goring's father, the Earl of Caversham

(Ben Bagley 'O4) pesters him to marry a
wife who ought to, according to the Earl,
have some measure of "common sense."
The notion of a wife with common sense,
though distasteful to Goring (Evan
Bauxbaum 'O6), nevertheless describes his
friend Robert's wife, Lady Chiltern Robert
(Ariana Nash 'O6). Alas, Sir Robert
Chiltern (Adam Bisno 'O6) has, in his
youth, committed an indecency against
her. Unfortunately, this dangerous fact is
overheard by the seductive, manipulative
Lady Cheveley (Felicia Leicht 'O4). What

ensues is a turmoil of stolen letters, blackmail, affected affection and, above all,
Wilde's typically witty one-liners. The
result is an idyllic ending where all the
right people finally end up together.
Director Ester Bloom 'O4, active in theater since her arrival at Swarthmore, is
thoroughly pleased with her handpicked
cast. Though composed largely of firstyears, the group is "incredibly talented."
"[They're] fun to be around, confident and

innovative," Bloom said.
Set designer and stage manager Sarah
Cohodes 'O5 said the production set "provides an excellent frame for the action"
and felt excited that all the hard work had
finally paid off for the cast and crew.
According to Danny Loss 'O4, who plays
the character Mason, the "wit of Wilde
infuse[d] rehearsals with a certain energy."

Rebecca Ennen 'O4 designed and helped
to produce the costumes. Because the set
is deliberately simple, colorful fashion is a
perfect complement. Bisno put it more
succinctly: "We look good." With a hardworking, devoted crew at her fingertips,
Ennen forewent the simpler possibilities
and chose to produce the luxurious garments by hand. The costumes are based on
the approximate time period, with the
exception of Viscount Goring's, which has
a suave, shiny, blue "Great Gatsby" look.
Regardless, the effect is sheer time travel.
If all the vibrancy of Mrs. Cheveley's violet gown and provocative hat isn't testimony to this fact, perhaps her sharply
delivered remark indicates as much: "A
woman's first duty is to her dressmaker."

First-class work in the mailroom
BY ELENA CUFFARI

ecuffarl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore mailroom workers are
a lot like Swarthmore students. Both workers and students complain about the size of
mailboxes; both work hard while jokingly
accusing their colleagues of not doing anything; both cherish their vacation time and
care a lot about politics. Both are goodnatured, fun to talk to largely made up of

guys I spoke to were not only welcoming
and frank but also conscious of and committed to the day-to-day existence of the

school.
Supervisor
Mailroom
Vincent
Vagnozzi, who has been working at
Swarthmore since January of 1994, cites
students and a positive relationship with
the management as the best aspects of his
job. A former banker, Vince has "never

worked anywhere this long." Vagnozzi
explained his current career contentment:
"I like the students, the campus, and, most
importantly, I like who I work for," he said.
"The vacations are great, too; can't forget
half-day Fridays."
John Steel and John T. Quinn, a mail
clerk and a window clerk respectively,
have both been at Swarthmore for a few
more years than Vagnozzi, and both came
to the school after lengthy careers in the

service. The two men enjoy the
reduced pressure and pleasant atmosphere
of the college mailroom.
Quinn, whose career history includes
jobs with railway mail in the 'sos, an airmail facility in Philadelphia, and a 38-year
run with a post office, said, "If I had to
postal

THE PHOENIX

work with the public as I used to, I would
have left by now." Quinn elaborated, "The

students are so inventive; they create electricity in the air."
A former letter carrier for a post office
in Lansdowne, Steel said the "good rapport" mail

workers have with students

"keeps us young."

For Quinn, there is no downside to his
job at the mailroom. "I've reached the point
where, if there's a downside, I leave," he
laughed, referring to his option of retiring.
"I enjoy getting up and going to work and
coming home to do homework with my
grandkids," he said of his routine.
Although more cheerful than most
when discussing their daily responsibili-

ties, all three workers see room for
improvement in the college mail system.
Literally, what's needed is simply more
room.
Vince was the first to mention the pending renovation of Parrish Hall, but John
and John also spoke to the need for space
in the mailroom. "Depending on available
funds, we'll hopefully get a new mailroom,
bigger mailboxes and more of them,"
Vagnozzi said of the projected plan. He
explained some of the difficulties of the
current arrangement, describing the window room, narrow halls behind mailboxes
and single office as "a tiny place."
Additionally, he said, "the mailboxes barely hold a newspaper, and since students
have started ordering things on the
Internet, we get tons of packages every day,
from Amazon, Dell, other places."
Steel pointed out that the plethora of
packages shipped to school at the beginning of every year have to be stored at Old
Tarble due to lack of storage space in
Parrish. He also would like to see more and

bigger boxes for students, many of whom
currently share mailboxes. This can sometimes create cause for student complaint,
Steel explained, as "some kids don't pick up
their mail often enough," annoying their
perhaps more conscientious mailbox part-

ners.

Though Quinn admitted that he thought
the mail facilities "were built for the 1900s

and are now outmoded," he reminded me of
the laid-back attitude of the mailroom: "We
all work together with what we have; I
don't think anyone gets upset [about lack of
space]." The mailroom workers are
looking forward to the renovations but understand the current
financial constraints of the situation, according to Quinn.
While the mailroom guys
enjoy the good news in the
lives of students, such as the
"loud cheers in the hallway"
when various acceptance letters arrive, they also share in
the
reactions
of
the

in all of their four years here." Steel, who
notices when "kids are tense at exam time
[and] seniors get particularly strung out,"
demonstrated again how much the mailroom staff is aware of the travails of college

life.

So the next time you buy stamps, feel
free to chat for a minute or two with the
window clerk or other mailroom worker.
They like you, and don't kid yourself
they know how excited you get over those
white package slips.

more serious issues. Quinn,
who feels strongly that the current action in Iraq is "immoral,
unwise and counterproductive
for ages to come," is glad to
engage his views with the "wellinformed philosophies" of people
at Swarthmore. He feels "completely
in tune with members of the student
body, staff and professors" with whom

he has discussed his anti-war sentiment.
More generally, all mailroom workers
agree that they sincerely appreciate students who talk openly with them at the

mail window. Steel expressed disappointment that "some students don't talk [to us]

[reserved-students] Blatant abuse of
reserved-students e-mail power

To:
Re:

We get them everyday. They advertise lectures, film
series, community service opportunities and even lost
wallets, jackets or backpacks. The endless stream of
reserved-students e-mails continually clutter our
inboxes.
We're projected to receive 138 reserved-students emails this month. Three years ago, the last time The
Phoenix wrote on these all-campus e-mails, students
had received a meager 79 in March. Facing a 75 percent increase in these e-mails over the last three years,
it is time for faculty and staff members to stop abusing
their reserved-students e-mails privileges.
Granted, some of these messages provide important
information; Registrar Martin Warner frequently
updates students on vital academic announcements.
But the vast majority serve merely to broadcast issues
such as film festivals, lectures or lost change purses
that are of interest to small groups of students (or none
at all).
Paging through recent reserved-students e-mails,
replete with spelling errors and missing information,
it is clear that most senders do not think twice about
sending out their e-mails. They act as though it is not
a nuisance for us to receive 10 reserved-students emails each day, many of which are not helpful, informative or important.
While it is true that reserved-students e-mails are
supposed to cut down on paper usage, many lectures
announced through the Internet are advertised on
paper fliers throughout campus. Furthermore, The
Weekly News serves as a single place for students to
get all the information they need about upcoming lectures.
Yet some faculty and staff may not trust that students read The Weekly News. They fail to see that we
would be more likely to do so if there were no
reserved-students e-mails about events. Students will
seek out lectures and would be more inclined to do so
if the announcements were not pesky e-mails.
Furthermore, many reserved-students e-mails occasionally arise out of laziness on behalf of the senders.
Similar to one appealing to a cappella groups sent out
today, some e-mails would be better served sent to a
specific group of students. However, those with
reserved-students e-mail access would rather send out
one e-mail than take the time to look up the names of
the handful of appropriate recipients.
To avoid the clutter of reserved-students e-mails, we
propose that one person be in charge of all non-essential reserved-students e-mails. That is, all e-mails not
containing important information from the registrar.
This person would review each submission and send
out a reserved-students digest each day. Such a message would eliminate inbox clutter, screen out the
more poorly conceived messages and maintain the
rights of faculty and staff to have their announcements
heard.
Faculty and staff probably think these e-mails are
an insignificant issue, but, in terms of daily student
life, they are the unnecessary annoyances that tax the
shrinking limits of the Swatmail accounts. Why not
think before hitting "send"?

N-word not the key to black power
Dear Editor:
Let's talk about the I-word
"IGNORANCE."

Ignorance in believing that the N-

word is the secret to black power;
ignorance in equating the N-word to
"Quaker" or "Yankee" and ignorance
in ignoring the historical etymology

of the N-word.
The heart of the Black Power
Movement is black love and black
pride, positive affirmations of blacks
to combat stereotypes that instances
such as use of the N-word promote. If
it were simply about showing that
blacks have overcome the "inferiority complex associated with slavery"
and the N-word, it would have been
called the Nigger Power Movement.
Historically, the N-word has been
used to subjugate blacks to whites,

intellectually, culturally and in all
other ways inferior. Unlike "Quaker"
and "Yankee," under the guise of
racial
the
N-word
superiority,
applies to an entire race of people,
not a segment of the population
based on religious differences or outlash against the oppressor by the
oppressed. The proper comparison
would be between the N-word and
"cracker" or "honky," and I don't see

white people trying to reclaim these
words.
The use of the N-word is still hotly
debated in the black community.
"Black" and "nigger" are not inter-

ries a negative connotation. Until a
consensus is reached within the
black community, if one ever is
reached, I suggest nobody begins
calling black institutions "nigger
institutions," unless you really are as

racist as outside use of the N-word
implies.

The fact that white slave owners
applied the N-word to blacks and that
we still live in a white-dominated
society makes it difficult to reclaim
the word, because the oppressive

love black people, but I hate niggas,"

conditions under which it was established still exist. Allowing whites to

To whoever carved "nigger table" and to everyone else,
please think of whatever table you see me sitting at as the
Nigger table. When you sit with me, you sit with a Nigger.
Forget black, African-American, Afro-American, Negro and,
god forbid, colored, or, even worse, person of color. When you
talk to me, look at me, shake my hand, roll your eyes at me,
smile at me, disagree with me, give me a C, whatever you
do so to a Nigger. Know that "nigger table" referred to at least
one student at Swarthmore. To whoever carved "nigger
table," thanks for the acknowledgement.
If it was up to me, "nigger table" would not have been sanded
out. Every month would be Nigger History Month. I would be a
Nigger studies major. Howard and Tuskegee would be Nigger
schools. The Washington Niggers would crush the New York
Yankees. The Washington Rednecks (I do believe in multiculturalism) would crush the Dallas Cowboys. And the Washington
Maroons would still have Chris Webber. But it's not up to me.
It's up to "colored people," sorry, "persons of color," like
NAACP president Kweisi Mfume,
to lobby for Merriam-Webster to
whitewash "nigger" from its dictionary. He has even threatened a
boycott if Merriam-Webster doesn't change its definition. Never

I

mind historical accuracy, which
Merriam-Webster reflects by
defining "nigger" as "a black perusually taken to be offenson
sive." Kweisi Mfume is in selfdenial of the truth that to be
black is to be Negro is to be a
Nigger. "Nigger" is a synonym,
basically a mispronunciation, of
"Negro," which in turn is
TARU TAYLOR
Spanish for "black." MerriamGadfly
Webster, don't allow your dictionary to lapse from cold hard
fact into political correctness.
You're right to define "nigger" as
usually offensive, for it is not always offensive. I don't take
offense, for "nigger" denotes "black person," which I am.

"Nigger" is a synonym, basically a mispronunciation, of "Negro," which in
turn is Spanish for "black."
In North America, from the 1500s to 1865, "Nigger" connoted "slave" but also "Maroon." From then on to the 1965 Voting
Rights Act that ended Jim Crow, "Nigger" connoted "secondclass citizen" as well as "Maroon." But in the U.S.A., in the
year 2000, blacks made $543 billion, thus black America is one
of the 10 or 15 richest nations in the world insofar as it is
Booker T. Washington's "nation within a nation." In the year
2003, "Nigger" would connote "black power" half a trillion
dollars strong if blacks would master credit, think more like
producers and less like bling-bling conspicuous consumers,
and pool their resources so as to invest and build infrastructures in their communities. Alas, "Nigger" connotes "token
bourgeois house niggers in the suburbs" and "lumpen proletarian field niggers in the ghetto." In the year 2003, "Nigger"
should connote "black self-help" and "black self-reliance."
Alas, "Nigger" connotes "hapless victim of white oppression."
Black history in the Americas is the history of house niggers and field niggers, but it's first and foremost the history
of freedom-fighting Niggers called Maroons (see "The Maroon
Narrative," Feb. 6, pg. 15). The difference between Kweisi
Mfume and me is that for him there are only house niggers
and field niggers, whereas for me there are house niggers and
field niggers and Maroons. "Nigger" offends Mfume because
it echoes his victim mentality, his slave mentality. "Nigger"
does not offend but rather delights me because it echoes my
Garveyite mentality, my Maroon mentality. For Mfume,
"Nigger" is about Uncle Tom and Sambo stereotypes. For me,
"Nigger" is first and foremost about the Maroon archetype.
Just sit me down with 11 other Niggers worthy of Booker T.
Washington's economics and Marcus Garvey's ideology and
Malcolm X's dialectics; we'd be Maroons of the Nigger Table.

used second-trimester abortion procedure. Clearly, the bill
makes it difficult for doctors to use their own judgment
about which types of abortion are safest and most appro
priate for their patients.
The dangerous vagueness of "partial birth" has rearec
its fuzzy head before. In 1998, when a state "partial-birth'
abortion ban passed in Wisconsin, every abortion clinic in
the state shut down. Doctors feared life imprisonment for
performing any abortion at all, and didn't resume the pro
cedure until prosecutors promised not to go after doctors
performing first-trimester abortions.

Women whose fetuses are

may be out of luck.
Though unconstitutionality seems not to bother the
administration too badly as of late, the ban on partial-birth
abortion flounders in this regard, too. According to the
Supreme Court, the bill is unconstitutional on the grounds
of overbroadness alone. Yet it also flaunts the constitutional mandate that any restriction on abortion must include an
exception to protect women's health and safety. There will
always be women for whom the banned procedures are
safest. If the ban passes the House, women whose fetuses are
endangering their health or life may be out of luck.
Ironically, Republicans promoting the bill said they
were concerned for the "safety" and "health" of women and
babies. Welcome to the new realm of American legalspeak:
not only does "disarmament" mean war, but "safety"
means increased risk of death.
Although last week's Senate vote gave overwhelming
approval to the "Partial-Birth Abortion Ban of 2003," most
Americans aren't so enthusiastic. The Center for
Reproductive Rights' national poll reveals that over 75 percent of Americans oppose the ban the way it currently
stands. Though 31 states have passed partial-birth abortion
bans, the bans have been overturned in every state where
their constitutionality has been challenged.
When it comes down to it, the American people are
wary of systematically endangering women's health and
violating the Constitution. The question is, why isn't the

Ideologies back human shield programs

Human shields do deter destruction
they do, not because they're racist

Dear Editor:

In "Human shields a flawed concept" (March 20, pg. 15), Randy
Goldstein is so caught up in his own
vitriol that he misses the basic strategy
underlying the work of human shields.
He condemns Corrie's actions as "selfrighteous" and "ill-conceived." While
he may not share her motivations or
moral values, he should recognize that
human shields from abroad
and the
United States in particular
have successfully deterred the destruction of
Palestinians' homes and other violations of their rights. Given the effectiveness of this method, it's absurd to
label it "futile."
Goldstein deems it "unconditionally
racist" that Western human shields
have operated primarily in the Muslim
world. Muslims do not form a race but
a religious group, and the Palestinian
Arab population includes prominent
Christians Edward Said and Hanan
Ashrawi. Human shields act where

of [lsrael and the United States] with. .
. Islamic terrorist groups" but because
that's where they are most effective.
Simply put, Israel and the United
States do hesitate to take the lives of
Americans

but

not

of

Palestinians or Iraqis, whom they
dehumanize as "collateral damage."
Whether this is a result of Israeli and
American racism or political self-interest is open to debate. In Goldstein's

Kurdish, Sudanese and Israeli examthe strategy wouldn't work,
because the human shields don't originate among the aggressors.
In destroying the homes Goldstein
euphemistically refers to as "strategic
targets," Israel violates the Fourth
Geneva Convention protecting civilians against collective punishment. On
March 3, Nuha Sweidan, nine months
pregnant and holding her 18-month-old
child, bled to death under a pile of rub-

that Corrie and others were protecting
was to be bulldozed not because of any
connection to militancy but because it

wall. Why
does
Goldstein place Palestinian innocence
in scare quotes while asserting Israeli
innocence as unquestionable? Israel is
currently in breach of 31 U.N.
Resolutions, excluding more than 30
others vetoed by the United States.
Four hundred militant Jewish settlers
living illegally over the green line in
Hebron and mounting attacks on their
130,000 Palestinian neighbors is selfrighteous stupidity on a far greater
scale than standing in the path of a
bulldozer. Still, when settlers are
killed, I mourn the loss of human life.
Randy Goldstein should have the
empathy to do the same for Rachel
Corrie.

Tamara Manik-Perlman 'O3

Shields effective in Muslim world, not racist
Furthermore, Israel is not innocent of the practice either,

Dear Editor:
In his column from last week, Randy Goldstein goes of his
way to overstate and undermine his case and misses the fun-

damental intent of Rachel Corrie and other members of the

International Solidarity Movement (ISM). He suggests that
these people should also protect the Iraqi Kurds, the
Sudanese Christians and animists, the Israeli targets of
Palestinian terrorism. Since they do not protect these
groups, he concludes that they will only protect Muslims
from non-Muslims, their efforts are "unconditionally
racist," and says "it is no coincidence that human shields
share a common hatred of [the United States and Israel] with
al-Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist groups."
What the author fails to understand is that protest is only
effective against a group responsive to it. Palestinian terrorist organizations, the Sudanese military and Saddam
Hussein's regime have shown no interest in protecting civilian lives and are all strongly anti-American. For American
and European protesters to try to defend these targets nonviolently would indeed be suicide, for the aggressors have
shown little regard for human life. If Corrie was "foolish,"
her error was not in expecting to be unharmed but in expecting that Israeli forces were not interested in killing non-combatants.

as the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has on repeated occasions
forced Palestinian civilians to act as shields for their troops
in armed conflicts (according to the Guardian Unlimited). If
they expect the Palestinians to respect the lives of civilians
and hold their fire, why is it foolish to suppose that the IDF

would do the same?
The author's insistence that the protesters' actions were
racist and somehow sympathetic to terrorist groups is preposterous. There is no rational basis for asserting that the
activities of voluntary human shields are racist or particularly used in the defense of Muslims; organizations have in
the past defended targets in other U.S. bombing campaigns
(most recently in Serbia). The ISM is an organization devoted to nonviolence and peace. Idealist though they may be,
their aims are utterly incompatible with al-Qaeda and

racism.
While the author is correct in asserting that Corrie's
actions were dangerous and that she should have been prepared to suffer injury or worse, she should not have expected it, and his allegation that she "killed herself in an ill-conceived act of stupidity" merely underscores his own irrational, and objectionable, viewpoint.

Evan Hensleigh 'O4

Goldstein misunderstands human shields
Dear Editor:
I am writing to respond to Randy Goldstein's last column,
which was unnecessarily offensive and factually incorrect,
demonstrating Goldstein's misperception of the nature of
accompaniment movements as well as a lack of understanding of the politics of the conflicts between Palestine and
Israel, and between Iraq and the United States.
Goldstein begins his column by stating that "Rachel
Corrie's death was her own fault." While Corrie made decisions that put her life in jeopardy, it is heinously disrespectful to suggest that her death was "an ill-conceived act of stupidity" or suicide. Rachel Corrie was murdered in an attempt
to defend the well-being of other innocent people
regardless of one's political beliefs, Corrie should be revered for her
courage and dedication to her ideals. Goldstein then challenges the effectiveness and motivation of accompaniment
movements, claiming that they are "racist," as they typically
protect Muslims. While racism is present in any organization
(due to its prevalence in modern society), Goldstein's choice
of the word reflects an incorrect classification, confusing
race with religion, and thus demonstrates his misperception
of the people, and also of the power dynamics, involved in
Middle Eastern conflicts. The use of this method in Palestine
and Iraq is not a conscious decision to protect people of

March 27, 2003

Muslim faith, but rather to reflect the urgency of the situations. The idea behind such movements is to use one's privilege as an American citizen to protect the lives of those who
are being systematically oppressed (in these cases,
Palestinians and Iraqis) in ways which danger their lives.
The assumption is made that the oppressor (i.e., the Israeli or
U.S. government) would not injure or kill a U.S. citizen for
fear of public outrage or loss of military funding. Because
acts of "terrorism" associated with "religious fundamentalists" are isolated and indiscriminate, the human shield
model does not readily apply to the situation of "Israeli buses
full of schoolchildren," as Goldstein suggests they should.
While this model does utilize privilege, which is arguably
problematic, its ultimate goal is to use this privilege against
the oppressor in order to allow for the survival of targeted
groups and to prove the superiority of those acting as shields.
Finally, Goldstein's attempt to label activists and other
groups as "America-hating" again demonstrates his desire to
speak for other people in a way that is misrepresenting and
offensive. Perhaps if he were to take the time to listen, he
would better understand the motivations of individuals like
Rachel Corrie, who did not "die for nothing," but rather for
those she truly loved.

Bombs over
Baghdad
Can the U.S. build a postwar government in Iraq?
It is no secret that the United States can win this war. With
more military might than it knows what to do with, the United
States can play "Bombs over Baghdad" until all of Iraq is
destroyed. When the United States really wants to, it is able to
dismantle regimes, crumble nations and override foreign
resistance. But what the United States has never been able to
do well is the one thing that this war seems to be riding on:
rebuilding or creating a stable democracy.
Recently, in his New York Times op-ed, Thomas Friedman
once again claimed that, if the United States is able to build
Iraq into a "decent, democratizing nation," then opponents of
the war, such as France, will
have no choice but to salute the
American war effort. Those
who share Friedman's rebuilding fantasies seem to be under

The hunt for the Wild West
I could write about Gulf War 11, but, honestly,
what's the point? Let's face it; no matter how much lip
service the Swarthmore community might pay to
open-mindedness, by now we've all decided how we
feel about Iraq. Nothing that I say in this column will
convince the Why War? crowd that Bush is doing the
right thing, and nothing that they say will convince
me that Saddam should
be left in power. I could
comment on the progress
of the war, but that would

of Sergio Leone's movies. Some of the greatest
Westerns are about vicious killers, and even heroic
characters often have darker elements to them.
However, there are some moral values that keep on
popping up throughout the genre. One of them is selfreliance. The Western hero doesn't necessarily shun
others, but he doesn't need the approval of society to
do what he feels is right.

like

Another important value is honor. Even outlaw
anti-heroes often have strongly held convictions on
what's right and what's wrong, and they're willing to
fight for what they believe in.
Unfortunately, a lot of the things the Western stood
for are now seen as pathologies. Rugged individualism
has been redefined as immaturity. If John Wayne were
to rise from the grave today, we'd probably try to hustle him into group therapy and dope him up on Paxil.
Meanwhile, we go out of our way to understand
acts of barbarism as the result of forces beyond the
evildoer's control or even as resistance against the
dastardly powers that be. I'd hate to see how the classic Westerns would turn out if they were remade

lnstead, I'd like to discuss one of the ideas that
have been circulating in the discussion surrounding
the war, specifically the notion that Bush is a "cowboy." Oddly enough, that's supposed to be taken as an
insult rather than a compliment.
When the administration's critics refer to Bush as
a cowboy, they're using that phrase as shorthand to
accuse him of callousness, recklessness and stupidity.
Not only are these charges false, but they reveal
something unflattering about the people who make
them. Now, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but this
practice of denigrating the Wild West is a direct
attack on some of American culture's finest values
and a sign that our society is becoming decadent and
corrupt.
It's a vast oversimplification to say that Westerns
offer a simple good-versus-evil view of the world.

tory.
Of all the rebuilding efforts
the United States has undertakVERONICA HERRERA
en throughout the world, few
have delivered the promised
results
understandably so,
since creating a stable democracy, free elections and nonauthoritarian political systems in a paternal political culture
is not easy work. No nation can just take a cookie-cutter political system and press it onto another nation, especially if the
nation doing the cutting is a developed nation and its mold is
being forced onto a developing nation that has not had the time
or political space to build its own functioning economic and
political system. But time and time again, the United States
promises to work miracles that not all the money and military
might in the world could deliver. Take Cambodia, for example.
The United States Air Force dropped 539,129 tons of bombs on
Cambodia between 1969 and 1973 (more than all of the bombs
dropped on Japan in World War II), killing about 700,000 people, according to the CIA, and driving half of the rural population into the cities as refugees. The bombing and flood of
refugees led to the collapse of the agricultural system and
induced a famine in which hundreds of thousands died from
starvation. In fact, many of the deaths after 1975 that are attributed to the Khmer Rouge were actually caused by starvation
from the famine induced by U.S. bombing before 1975.
However, what most Americans do not understand is that the
Khmer Rouge itself was a reaction against the brutality of the
United States-backed Lon Nol years of 1970-1975. Not to mention regime-building, election-tinkering efforts in El Salvador,
Vietnam, Nicaragua
and the list goes on.
Besides the logistical and ideological improbability that the
United States will be able to automatically create democracy
and stability, there is also the issue of money. On Monday, the
Bush Administration was forced to estimate war costs, to the
tune of $7O-90 billion! About $62 billion would be used for military operations and the rest for rebuilding Iraq and homeland
security. This is going to be an interesting rebuilding process,
one that will most likely be short on money, homeland support
and political intuitiveness and sensibility on the part of the
builders.
If the destroying and building process were measured by
money alone, the rebuilding of Iraq would already be doomed
$62 billion to destroy and less than $lO billion to rebuild. It
looks like the road ahead will be a tough one; even aid to Iraq
has slowed down from unexpected opposition from parts of
Iraq. If aid is not distributed soon, even more resentment will
build up against the United States, and the president will have
to dig deeper into his bag of tricks in order to convince the
American people that this war is, in fact, a good idea.

Eight players score in 11-4 rout of DeSales
BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore. edu

They wait with their sticks held firmly in their hands. Their spirits
are running high. The Garnet squad split 1-1 this week, with a sweeping
away victory against DeSales University, falling to fourth-ranked
Gettysburg College earlier in the week. The Garnet fought to hold their
record at .500, with a current season standing of 3-3, as they await two
conference matchups against Ursinus and McDaniel Colleges in the
upcoming week.
On Sunday afternoon, the Garnet men traveled to Center Valley, Pa.,
to face off against DeSales. The bus rode in with the Garnet men anxious and more than ready to play as they tore apart the DeSales
Bulldogs with an energetic 11-4 win. Than Court 'O3 scored three goals
to lead a balanced Tide offense that allowed eight players to hit the back
of the net in this conquest at DeSales. "We are all working really hard
together as a team. Our offense is taking aggressive shots, allowing us
to gain valuable scoring opportunities," said Court, a co-captain on the
team.

Swarthmore leapt out to a 9-0 lead and never turned back in its nonconference victory over DeSales (1-3). The Garnet Tide led 4-0 after the
first quarter, and 6-0 at the half. The Tide offense spread widely over six
different players, with John Cleaver 'O4, Tom Coughlin 'O5, John
Murphy 'O3, Tim Chryssikos 'O5, Chung Lee 'O5 and Court each scoring
in the first half. Pat Friel 'O3, Court and Joe DeSimone 'O4 made it 9-0
with goals in the third quarter before Brian Bottini broke up the nearshutout for the Bulldogs with 1:57 remaining in the third. As the close
drew near, Cleaver and Court chipped in a goal each to make it 11-L
Earlier in the week, Swat fell to nationally ranked Gettysburg
College, 8-4, although the score is not indicative of how the Garnet challenged this fierce competitor with their intense defense in the second
half. The Bullets' offense, however, proved too tough for the Garnet
when they scored five straight goals in the second quarter to take an 82 advantage. They pulled away, and the Garnet squad was unable to
catch up. After DeSimone scored a goal, cutting the Bullets lead to 3-2
with 11:49 remaining in the second quarter, Kevin Smith countered with
the first of his two goals just 17 seconds later to spark the Bullet attack.
Sean McTernan made it 8-2, hitting the back of the net with 24 seconds
left in the half.
In the second half, the Garnet Tide defense rendered the Bullets
scoreless. Chryssikos scored the lone goal of the third quarter, and
DeSimone tallied a man-up goal with 17 seconds remaining in the game.
Swarthmore goalkeeper Ryan Croken 'O5 denied 17 Bullet shots. By the
end of the game, Gettysburg had outshot the Garnet 45-29.
The Garnet squad looked back on the Gettysburg game not as a loss
but as an opportunity to notice what they did well. "Defense was our
strong point, especially in the second half," head coach Pat Gress said.
They will hold this aggressive defensive picture fresh in their minds as
they head into this coming week facing two Centennial Conference
games. "When you start getting stuck in focusing on the losses, it's hard
to move forward," co-captain John Murphy said. They will take with
them what they have learned this far into the season. "Over the past few
weeks, we have put in the work to build the team's strong offense and
defense, as well as overall attitude and dedicated work ethic," he added.
The Garnet faced a conference matchup against Ursinus yesterday.
This Saturday, they challenge conference competitor McDaniel College.
With spirits soaring, the Garnet men await the challenge with eagerness. "Team morale is high. We are sharing the ball offensively and

playing good team defense," Gress said."

Women's tennis remains unbeaten in CC play
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

The women's tennis team has been on a tear lately,
defeating all three Centennial Conference opponents it
faced last week by a combined score of 24-3, including an
impressive 7-2 victory over reigning CC champ
Washington College.
"This week was a good test for the team. We had three
tough conference matches, two of which were the cochampions last year, Washington and Muhlenberg," head
coach Jeremy Loomis said. "Our team prepared very
well for these matches and it showed up and down the
lineup."
The Garnet's record is 5-2 overall and a perfect 3-0 in CC
play. Included in those wins is an early season victory over
nationally ranked Mary Washington College. The two losses have both been to teams ranked in the top 15 nationally.
"The team is strong," Kristina Pao 'O4.
Last Tuesday, Swarthmore easily defeated Washington
College, the reigning CC champ, 7-2 in a match away from

home. The Tide jumped out to an early lead when thirdseeded doubles team Sarah Fritsch 'O4 and Katherine Voll
'O3 picked up a doubles point. "Against Washington,
Katherine Voll and Sarah Fritsch made quick work at
number-three doubles and got us an early point which was
huge for momentum and set the tone for the rest of the
match," head coach Loomis said.
Third-seeded Caroline Celano 'O4 and fifth-seeded
Emily Townsend 'O6 both won at singles and also teamed
up to win a doubles point. "The Garnet won 7-2 with strong
second and third doubles teams," Pao said, referring to the
doubles teams of Celano and Townsend as well as Voll and
Fritsch. "The women's tennis team had a great win on
Tuesday against Washington College, the defending conference champs."
Top-seeded Anjani Reddy 'O4 kept her CC winning
streak alive at 33 consecutive singles matches when she
handed her Washington opponent a 6-0, 6-2 defeat.
On March 19, the team defeated co-CC champ

She was down a set and was feeling
sick and miserable, but she didn't quit and managed to
turn the momentum around and get the victory in the

Loomis attributes the team's success to the players'
commitment to working and practicing hard. "The commitment from the whole team is outstanding. Everyone
plays hard in practice and this shows when we play a

The Garnet will host Franklin and Marshall on

Saturday at 1 p.m. After the F&M match, the squad's next
five matches will be away. "The next two weekends will be
another test for us. Two solid conference teams this weekend, and then next weekend we go down to Tennessee to
play two of the top teams in our region. I have complete
confidence that we will be ready for them all," Loomis
said.
"Hopefully, we can carry our momentum into the weekend's matches against Franklin and Marshall on Saturday
and Dickinson on Sunday," Pao said.

New field brings improvements, inconveniences
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
knelson2@swarthmore.edu
Ryan Croken's spring season is shaping up to be a
good one. The sophomore goalie is starting for the 4-3
Swarthmore men's lacrosse team and is third in the conference with a 64.9 save percentage. One factor in

Croken's and the team's success so far this season has
been the use of the resurfaced Clothier Field. While the
rest of the campus was covered in feet of snow, Croken
was fielding shots on the synthetic grass surface that now
crowns the team's home field.
"We love the new surface," Croken said. "It's great
because it's long enough to have the feel of grass but has
the consistency of a turf."
But for Matt Williams 'O4, this spring isn't all that he
had hoped for. Instead of spending his afternoons training on a brand new track, the hurdler has found himself
riding a yellow school bus to Widener two days a week for
sprint workouts. An extensive delay in the completion of
the project leaves the new field surrounded by blacktop
rather than a track.
"Bad weather delayed the final segment of renovation," Athletic Director Adam Hertz said. "The pour of
the track is very sensitive, and the field would be unusable for about a month."
After a long discussion involving the contractors,
facilities and the athletic department, the decision was
made, said Hertz, "to postpone the track portion until
after the spring season because of the access to the field."
And while both the men's and women's teams find
themselves without a home on campus, they have taken
the obstacles in stride, so to speak, and are focusing on
what they have rather than what they don't.
"The team understands that logistical issues have
delayed the whole project down there, not just the track,"
Williams said. "At this point, whatever the reasons that
led the current circumstances are irrelevant. It just
means that an extra 45 minutes of our day goes to commuting rather than running."
Jumper Jessica Zagory 'O5 noted that "Widener's really generous. We practice at the same time, and they're

really nice to us."
Track coach Peter Carroll understands the situation
that the administration was in when it came to the final
decision but regrets the loss of opportunity for his graduating

runners.

"I feel really feel bad for this year's seniors that they
didn't get a chance to run on a new track before they
graduated," he said. "Fortunately, Widener is gracious
enough to allow us to use their facility."
However, Hertz has made a point of expressing that
the athletic department will do "whatever it takes" to get
the team to Widener, noting that "cost is not an issue."
While the field is officially the home field of the men's
lacrosse team, other teams have benefited from the new
surface. In early February, local high school teams, other
college teams, and even the Philadelphia Charge, the
local women's professional soccer team, have had practices or games on Clothier.
"Once the facility was available, everyone wanted to
use it," Hertz said. "Most of the requests we turned away
because we do not have a firm policy on field rental yet.
We tried to accommodate other Centennial Conference
schools and other programs we have an arrangement
with, like Widener, for example."
The college has yet to charge any outside group any
fees for the use of the field. While there are plans for a
future policy on field rental, the athletic department is
taking the time to draft a sound policy rather than rushing, Hertz said.
"It's definitely a work in progress. We're not looking to
make millions of dollars from the field. Our main use for
the facility is for our own teams and clubs," he said.
The athletic community has high hopes for the potential showcase aspect of the field. This Saturday, the men's
and women's lacrosse teams host key Centennial
Conference teams in a double header, and last weekend
the women laxers hosted the 13th annual Seven Sisters
Tournament on Clothier.
"If it hadn't been for the new turf, we wouldn't have
been able to hold the tournament," head women's
lacrosse coach Karen Borbee said. "Every other school
was very impressed with the surface.'
Borbee's team will have approximately half of their
home games on the field.

The new synhetic grass field serves as the home turf of the men's lacrosse team, but it has been used by non-Swarthmore
teams as well. The track, to be situated below the field in the top picture, will not be completed this academic year.
"It's a wonderful venue and helps the athletes to feel
more appreciated," she said.
Williams still wonders why they have had to forgo
their own home season while there is a seemingly endless

supply of fields.

"The bottom line is that the lack of a track affects both

March 27, 2003

our performance as track athletes and as Swat students to
a serious enough degree that, if it can be fixed during the
season, it should be. Any other team here would expect the
same if its playing surface were taken away," she said.
After all, Williams said, "The track team are athletes
just like everyone else."

us a chance to play in front of our friends and family." Coach Karen Borbee said it was "very exciting to
host the tournament. There were some stressful
moments due to the weather, but it all worked out
well, and we had a great weekend."
The Garnet went 2-1 on the weekend, placing fifth
in the tournament overall. The team started off the

weekend with a three-goal loss to The College of
Notre Dame (Md.), 8-1 L All-tournament team member Jackie Kahn 'O4 scored a career-tying five goals
in the match. While Swarthmore jumped out to a 4-2
lead at the beginning of the game, Notre Dame could
not be contained, as they answered with four goals.
A goal by Jamie Larson 'O6 and a followup by Kahn
at the 28:38 mark tied the game, 6-6. But the Gators
took a mental edge and ran, scoring the final four
goals to secure victory. Goalkeeper Sam Uslan 'O3
recorded 15 saves on the day.
"I think we were all disappointed after the first
game," Borbee said, "but the team really rallied in
the second and gained a great deal of confidence."
Swarthmore returned to the field later that afternoon and demolished Smith College 16-3.
"Defensively, our goal is to hold teams to less than 10
goals per game, and offensively, we want to score 10
or more goals per game," Cara Tigue 'O6 said. "We
also wanted to be aggressive on the turf and get more
ground balls than the other team. It shows that we
can out-hustle them."
In the Smith game, Kahn continued to dominate
on the offensive end, as she netted five goals and two
assists. First-years Niamh Shortt 'O6 and Heidi
Fieselmann 'O6 each contributed three goals to the
cause. With 15 minutes left in the first half, the
Garnet were tied with Smith. It didn't last long. With
a surge of energy, Swarthmore took control of the
game, both offensively and defensively, by completing 13 goals and shutting out their opponents for the
rest of the game.
But it was Sunday's third game, where the Garnet
bled maroon and gray and proved their talent. In an
aggressive and energetic fashion, the Swarthmore
women beat Vassar College 9-8 in overtime.
Swarthmore started the game well, but Vassar
took over and controlled the momentum for much of
the second half. "Vassar took the momentum away
in the second half when they made their comeback
and took the lead," Tigue said. Kahn led the team to
overtime as she scored the seventh (5:34) and eighth

(0:34) goals

for Swarthmore. At the end of regulation
time, the scoreboardread: Swarthmore 8, Vassar 8.
Coach Borbee supplied the team with confidence
and encouragement heading into the overtime play.
"Right before we went out into the overtime, our
coach told us it was a great learning experience,"
Salussolia said. "As a young team, it would really
test us and give us the experience we will need later
down the road." The team rallied together, and their
cohesiveness paid off. With 1:36 remaining in the
first overtime, Fieselmann netted the game-winner
and gave Swarthmore fifth place on the weekend.
Said Fieselmann, "I wouldn't say I scored the
game-winning goal; rather, I would say that it was
completely a team effort. The team's intensity and
energy caused the series of passes, and I was in the
right spot to finish." Indeed, the effort could be seen
all over the turf. Salussolia said, "Sam Uslan had
great saves against Vassar. She was huge in ensuring
the win." Uslan finished the game with 17 saves. In
addition, Christina Vu 'O6 scored two goals during
the contest.
Tigue agreed that the victory was one the entire
team had earned. "It felt great to win a close game
like that, because I think we proved a lot about the
potential this team has," she said. "More importantly, we proved to ourselves what we are capable of,
and it's a big confidence booster heading into the
rest of the season."
Leadership from the veterans was crucial in both
the Vassar game and Saturday's games. Kahn, Meg
Woodworth 'O3 and Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 are the only
players on the team with experience from last year.
"They all stepped up during the tournament,"
Borbee said. Woodworth was named to the AllTournament team along with Kahn.
Haverford won this year's title game with help
from tournament MVP Mindy Walman. The Fords
took the game 12-10 from Wellesley.
The Garnet are eager to continue their success
and improve upon their skills. "I am very proud of
the effort of the entire team, and we improved a great
deal throughout the weekend," Borbee said.
Salussolia added that "this weekend allowed for us to
grow as a team. With each game, we learn something
new about ourselves and take that with us into our
next game. Each game we play, we become more
cohesive."

JOSH LOEFFLER
thing is? It is the best weekend
of the year.
Riding the Pine
The opening weekend of the
tournament is filled with 12
straight hours of ball each day.
The best basketball of the season consumes your entire day,
your whole existence. Here are some highlights.
DAYI
For God's sake, the first game was, like, the best thing ever.
I mean, not many people hype up the tournament like I do. It is
all I can think about for the whole week before it happens. If the
first few games are not good, I start getting all nervous and
twitchy. Cal vs. N.C. State went down to the wire. Two straight
threes in the last 10 seconds, then a missed bomb to end the
game at the buzzer. I mean, all of us were jumping around the
apartment like lunatics, screaming directions to the teams. I
was winded by the end, and it was not even two o'clock in the
afternoon. It was by far the best opening game of my life.
The day just got better from there. The ups and downs were
too much to bear. Personally, I thought the Notre Dame-U.W.
Milwaukee matchup was almost enough to induce a coronary.
You want to hyperventilate? Watch one of your Final Four
teams almost lose a first round game. Whew.
Top moment of the first day: everyone jumping on Joey's
Maryland bandwagon (partially for our own brackets, partially
for the superfan) and then running around the apartment like
middle school girls on a sleepover when Drew Nicholas hit the
25-foot runner to win. Surreal, absolutely surreal.
DAY 2
While watching one of your Final Four teams struggle in the
first round is the worst, there is no higher comedy than watching someone else do the same. I have to say that watching
Wheeler almost cry as Mississippi State took a dive to Butler,
then have him defend his ludicrous choice to put MSU in the
Final Four was one of the funniest things I have ever seen. But
I digress.
Day two also saw the birth of the greatest comedic theme of
the weekend. In our five-person player draft pool, all that matters is how many points the players on your team score.
Wendell apparently did not realize this when drafting his team.
Instead, his team combined for more turnovers than points,
leaving Wendell to blame his woes on a semester in Rome.
Finally, the weekend would not be complete without a brief
recap of the second round. Two games sum up these two days.
The first involve Marquette and Missouri and found the room
with only one fan for Marquette: me. Needless to say, gracious
winner that I am, Marquette's victory caused Eran to nearly
jump out of his chair and strangle me as the room fell eerily
silent and I uttered quietly: "Mar-QUETTE?"
Two hours later, the room was jumping as all of us hooted
and hollered during the Arizona-Gonzaga game. I can say that
this was the best college game in at least five years without
question. At the end of the game, having watched Arizona win
and keeping all our brackets intact, everyone in the room collectively high-fived each other.
It all made sense. None of the occurrences of the day mattered. We had bonded around the game, that moment. It was a
basketball love-fest. The tourney does strange things to people.
