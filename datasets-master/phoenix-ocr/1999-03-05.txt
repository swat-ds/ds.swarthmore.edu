Clinton performance

by Vanessa Jann-Jordan
Contributing Writer

Hoping to promote college
spirit, Student Budget Committee member Horatiu
Stefan 'Ol has worked tirelessly over the past three
weeks to bring entertainer
to
Clinton
George
Swarthmore on May 1. But
despite popular support,
Stefan said the proposed concert is unlikely.
For Stefan, time is key because Clinton will not stay
unreserved for long. Stefan
still does not know if money
will be available from the
President's Fund to support
the event. He also needs to
get final quotes for technical
equipment and resolve the
most pressing insurance and
security problems. Moreover,
according to Social Affairs
Committee coordinator Brian
Bell '99, SAC will withdraw
its support for the event if the
details are not resolved by
today.
George Clinton's managers
estimated overall expenses
for the performance at over
$30,000. This appraisal includes the artist fees for a
twenty-person band, sound
equipment, activities surrounding the concert, possible insurance needs, and
room and board expenses for
the artists.

This week, the Housing
Committee confirmed three
decisions to be enacted this
fall. The off-campus dorm
Woolman will be coed, Mary
Lyon basement will go from
segregated men's and women's
to completely coed halls, and
joint tenancy is undergoing
slight reform.
The Housing Committee, led
by Director of Residential Life
Myrt Westphal and containing
over a dozen student members,
met Monday night to review its
plans for the fall with students
invited for an open half-hour
session beforehand. Housing
Interns Stacey Bearden '99 and
Gerry Kaufman '99 took minutes.
According to Bearden, floor
plans for Woolman House
made it "logistically possible"
to be coed with its existing
bathrooms. Thus, the spring
lottery will see Woolman listed
with all floors coed.
"It was basically a move to
make Woolman more desirable, which usually falls to the
bottom of the list for housing.
We're hoping this sweet offcampus space will get more attention now that it's coed," said
Kaufman.
Woolman will also be completely non-smoking this year,
according to this week's recommendations.

CEP recommends no PDCs Attempt to gain liquor
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
News Editor
Though too late to help current students, future Swatties
may not have to experience the
pain and suffering associated
with Primary Distribution
Courses, or PDCs, but it is also
likely that they will be spending more time in the language
lab.

Under preliminary recommendations from the Council
on Educational Policy, the requirement may be eliminated.
PDCs would be replaced with
a combination of Writing Intensive Courses and Quantitative Reasoning Courses. The
language requirement would
be increased from two semesters to four semesters or their
equivalent.

The council is seeking student input on the proposed
changes to graduation requirements. Any changes, the council said, would not take effect
before all current students
graduate.

recommendations by May to

Black Panther Seale speaks

Last Friday Black Panther
Party founder Bobby Seale visited campus to speak at Lang
Performing Arts Center.
A large crowd of predominantly students turned out to
hear Seale speak about his days
as a grassroots activist during
the 1960's and the future of
grassroots activism.
Seale stayed on campus for

the entire day and had lunch
at the Black Cultural Center
with a group of students and
faculty.
Seale's speech focused on
debunking the misconceptions
ofthe Black Panther Party perpetrated by the government
and the popular press. Seale
also railed against the profiteering of the movie studios
attempting to exploit the image
of the group.
Speaking in a highly ani-

mated fashion and liberally
spicing his talk with humorous anecdotes, Seale spoke for
over two hours after his introduction by Professor Meta
Mendel-Reyes and Vincent
Kelly'oo.
Some students complained
that Seale's speech was largely
self-aggrandizing, but others
appreciated his efforts to cut
through the mystique surrounding the Black Panther
Party.

SWARTHMORE INTERNATIONAL BEGO
Debaters successful at tourney Albright visits China

This past weekend the Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society claimed
success at the University of Virginia's debate tournament held
at the University of Maryland at College Park.
Approximately 50 teams of two debaters each attended.
Swarthmore sent five teams.
The team of society president Darius Ornston 'OO and vicepresident TenayaScheinman 'Ol were one of only two undefeated
teams in preliminary rounds. The pair lost in the quarterfinals to a
team from Princeton and finished in fifth place overall.
The team of Damon Taaffe '99 and Allan Friedman 'O2 had a
4-1 record in preliminary rounds but lost in the semifinals to a
team from Columbia, finishing in fourth place overall.
Individually, Taaffe finished second overall, and Ornston took
the No. 10ranking. Friedman and David Kamin 'O2 both earned
novice speaker awards, placing second and fourth respectively.
These successes come after a dry-spell broken earlier this year
by the duo of Taaffe and John Dolan 'Ol, who together placed
second at the UPenn tournament and first at Bucknell, propelling the pair to a No. 4 national ranking.
Unfortunately, Dolan is studying abroad in Bejing, China, for
the remainder of the semester but looks forward to continued
success next year. In addition to these successes, Swarthmore
boasts several talented novice debaters, including the team of
Mimi Hanaoka 'O2 and Dave Ellis 'O2, which has recently posted
winning records and novice team awards.
The debate society will be hosting a tournament the weekend
of March 19-20. Teams will be coming from as far as Stanford
and Canada.

Burglar strikes Phi Psi

Last Wednesday evening Phi Psi fell victim to a burglary.
A student's room in the fraternity house, officially known as
Sharpies Five, was forcibly entered sometime between 4 p.m.

Secretary of State Albright urged Chinese officials to release
political dissidents and ratify human rights covenants.
"It's very important for there to be a change in atmosphere
and an end to the crackdown," Albright said Tuesday at a news
conference ending her visit to China.
The Chinese said it was an internal affair and complained about
a State Department report that condemned the crackdown on
leaders of a banned democratic party. However, Albright said
the Clinton administration wants to develop a "strategic partnership" with China and attempt a deal for China to join the
World Trade Organization.
A deal could help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which
is a record $57 billion. Joining the WTO would give China lowtariffaccess to export markets and protect it from any sanctions.

Nigerians elect president

Monday General Olusegun Obasanjo, a traditional Baptist
Christian and the only Nigerian military ruler to have voluntarily relinquished power, won the country's presidential election.
The 61-year-old Obasanjo is the flag bearer of the People's
Democratic Party. The party has swept the vote in local, state
and national elections preceding the presidential election, which
is the climax of Nigeria's latest transition to democracy program. He was backed by retired generals and other wealthy Nigerians who ensured his campaign was well-funded.
"We can make a better country; we should make a better country and the only way to do it is for all of us to resolve that this
time around, we wi11... come what may," he said last year after
finally deciding to stand.
In a country riven by tribal grievances, Obasanjo is one of the
few politicians who can claim to be more popular among others
than with his own Yoruba group of southwest Nigeria.

Fake web site for mayoral
candidate merits investigation
The District Attorney, State Attorney and U.S. Attorney's Offor Philadelphia
fice are all looking into the bogus web
Democratic mayoral candidate John White Jr. The phony web
page looked like an official site of White's campaign.
It was traced last week to David Sirota of Huntington Valley,
Massachusetts, who was friendly with State Rep. and mayoral
candidate Dwight Evans, and web designer Robert Richman of
Cambridge, who paid for storage of the site with his Visa card.
The apparent purpose of the site was to damage White's appeal to white voters by highlighting a remark made for a Spanish weekly newspaper: "The black and the brown, if we unite,
we're going to control this city."
White said the quote did not reflect his meaning that blacks and
Latinos could have more political power if they worked together.
State election code prohibits advertising to influence elections
without a disclaimer indicating who sponsored the ad. The web
page was registered under the pseudonym Brock Landers, a fictitious character in the movie "Boogie Nights."

Welfare reforms protested
Hundreds of demonstrators walked down Broad Street on
Wednesday to protest the changes in Pennsylvania's welfare
system that took effect at midnight. The protest was led by the
Kensington Welfare Rights Union.
The march started at the State Office Building and proceeded
down Broad Street towards Philadelphia City Hall. The demonstration came to a stop in front of the Liberty Bell, where protesters wearing skull masks staged a mock funeral. Traffic was blocked
off from the protest site for a short time, but there were no arrests.
Thousands of welfare recipients faced a cutoff of cash benefits if they were not at a job working at least 20 hours per week
by the deadline. The change is part of the two-year limit on
benefits written into the state welfare reform bill, which became law two years ago.

NATIONAL
Panel demands IOC reform

Court debates Title VII case

An ethics panel headed by former Senator George Mitchell
demanded reform to avoid a repeat ofthe million-dollar bribery
case of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games.
Mitchell stated that the Salt Lake case arose from a history
of weak structure and a lag in "ethical governance" in the International Olympics Committee (IOC) due to the influence
of "big business." Mitchell recommended that the lOC drop
its tradition of appointing members for life and instead have
them elected by member national committees and other constituent bodies.
He also called for the lOC to make its financial records public
and to put an end to taking financial gifts from cities bidding to
host the Olympic Games.

Monday, the Supreme Court continued debating the case of
Carol Kolstad, who has sued under Title VII for punitive damages against her employers in the American Dental Association
(ADA) for sexual discrimination in not being promoted.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars discrimination
in employment based on race, sex, religion, or nationality.
Kolstad has won a back-pay award in her suit, but in seeking
punitive damages to prevent further employer misconduct, she
has been told that they require proof that her employers showed
"egregious conduct" in discrimination. A lawyer for the ADA
said that U.S. law has always had a "more difficult standard of
proof when it comes to punitive damages.

Haverford
Board changes
diversity plan

The Haverford Board of
Managers passed a resolution
on Saturday, February 27 calling for the College administration to create a "clear and measurable plan" to increase the
number of students, faculty
and administrators of color at
Haverford, and to improve the
quality of life for students of
color on campus.
The administration is expected to report back to the
Board by April and present a
final version of its plan by next
fall. The Board's actions were
in response to a recent letter
circulated around the college
by a group of students calling
itself the Sons of Africa. The
letter called for increased funding for the Office of
Multicultural Affairs (OMA)
as well as a revised mission for
it and for the College's other
diversity efforts.
The Sons of Africa called
for the OMA to switch its focus from the "celebration of
diversity" to the improvement
of support for students of
color. They also called for the
Summer Tri-Co program to be
restructured to focus on the
development of leadership
and communication skills
among students of color,
rather than preparing them for
a "racially hostile college experience."

Honor Code

ratification

deemed invalid
After the process for collecting ratification cards was
deemed flawed, Haverford's
Honor Council decided late
Sunday night to rerun the card
collection in an attempt to
ratify the Honor Code.
Two thirds of the student
body is required to vote in favor of the Code each spring,
in order to ensure its passage
for the next year. Initially, the
Code did not appear to receive enough votes in the balloting process, but Students'
Council Presidents Jesse
Ehrenfeld 'OO and Judson
Redmond 'Ol went door-todoor to collect the remaining
votes, a process many members of Honor Council found
problematic.
Additionally, many students
did not receive ratification
cards in their mailboxes until
right before they were due.
Because of these flaws,
Honor Council decided to rerun the process after spring
break. However, the Honor
Code does not provide for rerunning the ratification process after it has failed—the
only option in the Code is to
call a Special Plenary, which
2/3 of the student body would
need to attend in person in order for the Code to be voted
upon.
Despite Council's decision,
several students, including
some members of Honor
Council, have begun to circulate a petition calling for such
a Special Plenary.

On Saturday, February 20,

female space, the Committee
turned to the Lodges as all-female housing. At least three
ofthe five lodges must now be
all-female, and these lodges
will be offered by blocks.
Bearden explained the move in
the hope that the Lodges "alleviate the female housing
crunch," given the higher proportion of women now at Swat.
The second issue was gender
splits in ML basement, an area
that traditionally attracts more
females than males. ML basement provides one male hall
and one female on the side
closer to campus; they are
separated by a boiler room type
of space.
According to Bearden,
"more females seem to find
ML basement appealing,"
both because they desire the
single-sex situation more and
due to rumors that the men's
rooms are worse on the left
side. Once committee discussions confirmed the idea that
men, in Parrish 4th West as
well, were not particular
about single-sex housing, the

Committee decided to equalize ML basement by making
both halls coed. The one
bathroom on each side will
now likewise be coed and will
be used with flip signs, as in
the famed prototype of the
PPR experience.
The Committee finally
agreed that joint tenancy will
be reformed slightly. Joint
tenancy allows for people to
go abroad and keep a place
on campus for when they return. First, joint tenancy will
no longer be allowed in
singles.
Secondly, it will be suggested that immediately after
the housing lottery, those
wanting joint tenancy for
shared spaces (triples, quads,
and doubles) speak to a representative of the Housing
committee present at the lottery. Any discussion there of
joint tenancy will be informal
and non-binding but will at
least make the Committee
aware ofthose persons' interest. For blocks, as in previous years, joint tenancy will
be done ahead of time on the
block application.

Managers this semester, though it is not yet
known when the changes might be implemented.
Under the tentative recommendations, students would be required to take only two courses
in each division, down from three in each of
the three divisions under current policy. One of
those two in each division must be a Writing
Intensive Course, the recommendations say.
Students would also be required to take any two
Quantitative Reasoning Courses. The recommendations also require that two of the WICs
and one of the QRCs be completed by the end
of the sophomore year.
Students would be required to take four semesters or the equivalent of a foreign language,
up from two semesters under current rules.
Scores of 700 or better on a language achievement test would be necessary to place out of
the language requirement completely; a score
of 600 is now sufficient to avoid the two-semester requirement. Three years of high school
study of a foreign language would no longer
automatically waive the language requirement,
although students could still place into higherlevel classes and complete the four-semester
requirement earlier. Students could also meet
the requirement by studying abroad in a program with Swarthmore-approved language
study.
Other graduation requirements, such as the
total of 32 academic credits and enough physical education credit, will remain under the proposal.
"The fact that students must take PDCs in the
Division in which they major is criticized as
preventing students from taking more advanced
courses from which they would benefit more.
"Many PDCs are in fact most notable for their
writing component, the element we tentatively

propose to maintain," the council wrote in an
e-mail memo to students.
The proposed changes would allow departments to continue to offer PDCs, but the graduation requirement of two PDCs in each of the
college's three divisions would be eliminated
in favor of the WICs and QRCs.
While the WICs would continue the writing
requirement of the PDCs, the QRC requirement is new. "The goal of the quantitative requirement, parallel to that of the WIC for writing, would be to expose every student to frequent involvement in both interpretation and
production of quantitative analysis," the memo
said.
Division chairs would continue to determine
whether classes could qualify as WICs cr QRCs.
"The current language requirement for graduation seems to us to require exposure rather than
proficiency.. .we believe that the faculty should
either strengthen the existing requirement or
abandon it," continued the memo.
The council is also considering implementing and requiring first-year seminars, although
it is continuing to discuss the issue and has made
no recommendations yet. "Since the core characteristics ofa seminar are for many faculty and
students the core characteristics of a
Swarthmore education, it seems persuasive that
students should be oriented to this mode of
learning early,rather than 'saving it for dessert,'
the memo to students said.
PDCs were first added to the curriculum in
1986, but a more intensive language requirement had existed for many years before. Until
1970, Swarthmore required four semesters of
foreign language study or a score of 600 on a
language achievement test. Between 1970 and
1982, the college did not have a foreign language requirement. The Class of 1987 was the
first to graduate under the current language requirement of two semesters or the equivalent.

never outlawed retail beer es-

tablishments, beverage distributors and state stores.
Though the board has not yet
officially rejected his application, Flanigan was informed
that it will do so because Delaware County already has far
more licensed beer distributorships than called for by the
county's population.
"We were not going to put a
beer distributorship here,"
Flanigan said this week in his
South Chester Road store,
where the windows are plastered with a large orange public notice ofhis application and
newspaper clips about it.
Flanigan said he was instead
considering selling the license
in the future or destroying it "if
the town decided to stay dry."
Swarthmore Borough Council has not taken action to close
the loophole, which was made
public in a January report from
Urban Partners and Kise Straw
& Kolodner. The consultants,
hired by the borough to develop a town center revitalization strategy, suggested that
Swarthmore would be eligible
for three liquor licenses based
on its population. But they did
not know that the county's
quota of licenses was already

filled.
According to the liquor control board, Delaware County is
eligible for 18 beer distributorships, one for every 30,000
people. The county already has
55 current licenses, most of
which predate the quota, and
the board will not approve
more licenses. A Swarthmore
merchant would therefore have
to buy another store's license
to open a liquor store here.
Before he knew the control
board would deny his application, Flanigan wrote in an email to Swarthmore council
members, "It would be economically remiss not to pursue
possible access to a limited
market with windfall potential
given our shop location."
Flanigan said that he is not
interested in buying another
store to obtain a license. But
the loophole concerns him, he
said, because someone else
might be.
Maurice Eldridge, vice
president for college and community relations, was pleased
Flanigan would have prevented
others from acquiring a license
if the town remained dry. "He's
a very public-minded citizen,"
Eldridge said.
Swarthmore may soon reach
a fork in the road, said
Flanigan, who believes a new
referendum may be coming.

The supposed cause of
this shortage is that all drivers must be van-certified by
the school before they can

this policy one year ago,
according to Karen Mazza,
who is in charge of van-certification.
In order to become certified, students must fill out
driver information forms
and present their driver's
licenses. A copy of the license is sent to the
student's home state to obtain a motor vehicle report,
which shows a record of
any moving violations that
person has had. This is sent
to the department for which
the student will be driving,
and then that department
gives the student a van driving test.
Mazza stressed that this
test is beneficial to the student, because it is helpful
for them to practice driving
a vehicle so much larger
than a regular car. The
whole process takes from 710 days and is relatively
easy.
"There are over 350 certified drivers on campus,"
Mazza noted..
For the time being, the
problem is solved.
"As of now every shift is
taken care of," said
Dawson.

Oboler lectures on
multi-culturalism
by Alma Ortiz
Contributing Writer
Brown University Professor
Suzanne Oboler lectured on
the codification of Latinos as
a group at Swarthmore Feb.
22. The lecture, entitled "Rethinking 'Multiracialism' in
the Americas: The Case of
Latinos in the United States,"
also addressed the role of the
U.S. Census in perpetuating
racial codification.
The lecture, which was
sponsored by the Latin American Studies Concentration, the
Provost's Office, ALANA,
HOLA, and the Intercultural
Center was held in the Scheuer
Room and a drew a large audience.
Oboler explained that after
the Civil Rights Movement of
the 19605, the U.S. Census began to include racial identification in order to better identify the inequalities between
certain racial groups and to be
able to track their progress.
However, Professor Oboler
believes that this segmentation
of the population has backfired. The demarcations of
"race," she explained, are general categories that do not accurately identify anyone.
Within the group demarcations, cultural specificities are
completely erased.
For example, she called the
word "Hispanic" a "masterpiece of ambiguity."

Moreover, she stated that the
definitions of "racial groups"
have only created an organized
social hierarchy in which
whites are on top. In many instances, persons of other "racial" origins are not considered
citizens of the United States.
For instance, she cited that
Mexican Americans who had
lived in the United States for
many generations are still
asked by others: "Where are
you from?" They are forever
associated with the Hispanic
label.
According to Oboler, the
census has also caused
many people to further their
own assertive self-identification with a certain racial
group. The categories have
become an ingrained part of
daily life for most Americans. Moreover, these "racial" restrictions have
brought about less interaction among members of the
ethnic groups. She claimed
that in U.S. society, it is up
to racial groups to speak out
when injustices have been
incurred against their own
members. She added that
these racial categories have
only enabled racism to persist, as specific labels are
attached to certain general
"races."
So, are there any answers?
While Professor Oboler does
not believe that affirmative action is perfect, because she

thinks it segregates persons
into racial groups, she does
believe that its destruction cannot be allowed because there
are not any better substitutes
available. It attacks intolerance, says Oboler, and is imperative because there are no
other current proposals that
would fight against ongoing
discrimination.
However, at the same time,
racism and division among
pre-assigned ethnic groups
continues to exist. Oboler
blames this partially on the
fact that ethnic groups, already so isolated from one
another, will not work together to fight injustices in
society. Oboler sees little
hope for the future, especially given the recent defeat
of the movement to include a
multi-racial category in the
2000 census.
Tania S. Ochoa 'O2 found
Oboler's speech to be interesting. "She raised a lot of issues
that are very pertinent to the
Latino community. Her stand
on the subject was different
from others I've heard before,"
she said.
Jenny Yang 'OO also found
Oboler's speech different from
many others. "What she is asking for is important... real
quality of life improvements."
Yang found Oboler's talk to be
practical, commonsense, and
"very refreshing in the
academia."

Darlo, who was bom in Tibet,
emigrated to Nepal at age 11 but
maintained high hopes ofreturning to Tibet. Having worked in
both India and Nepal, Darlo currently lives in New York where
he serves for the Tibet Fund and
the Office for Tibet.
There are six primary goals of
the Office of Tibet: to nurture a
grass-roots movement for
awareness ofthe Tibet plight; to
lobby in Congress on behalf of
the Tibetan cause; to serve as a
liaison for all Tibetans; to look
after Tibetan interests in Central
and Latin America; to coordinate the visits of His Holiness
the Dalai Lama; and to raise
funds for the needs of Tibetans.
Following the invasion of Tibet and the devastation of the
Tibetan national uprising by
the Chinese People's Liberation
Army in 1959, thousands of Tibetans have fled their nation to live
in exile. Of the 130,000 Tibetans

SPRING BUDGETING REMINDER
In order to be as equitable and efficient as possible in their allocations
of student money, Student
Budget Committee holds
two marathon budgeting
sessions in mid-March
called "spring budgeting." By allocating the
majority of the funds for
the next fiscal year at
spring budgeting, the
committee can practice
the advance planning and
forward thinking that is
expected of a responsible
money-managing body.
By doing it right the first
time, the committee will
have more time in April
and next fall to listen to
emergency requests and
to improve the budgeting
processes even further.
Cooperation of the group
treasurers will allow the
process to run very
smoothly and will minimize the number of misunderstandings that result
in unhappy groups and
appeals. Please keep the
following points in mind
as you and your group
prepare for spring budgeting:

Contact your liaison
to set up an appointment.
These people will be your
primary resource throughout the process. They will
be on your side during your
hearing, but can only speak
for you effectively if they
are informed about your
groups wants and needs. If
you do not have a liaison,
contact the SBC office at
x8348 or <bctreasl>.
Write your proposal
in the suggested format.
While they would like to,
the committee will not be
able to take the time to read
many paragraphs of text
before getting to the heart
of the proposal, which to
them is the numbers. Be
forward and clear in your
proposals. Be prepared to
justify all requests, but do
not bring a three page proposal for $lO.OO in photocopying. The committee
will ask you the questions
it deems relevant.
Turn your proposal in
on time. Proposals are due
at 11:59 "p.m. on Wednesday, Mar. 17. If for some
reason you can not turn in
your proposal by that time,
—

—

—

you must contact the SBC
office. There are penalties
for missing budgeting and
for being late with proposals. While it may seem
harsh, it is extremely important to the committee
that ALL of the groups go
through at the same time. It
works to youx benefit, because the committee budgets "blindly" (without
consideration of other
groups) during spring budgeting.
Sign up for an appointment. Sign-up sheets
will be posted on the door
of the office. There are 15minute time slots from midmorning to late evening.
Sign-up for only one unless
your group was designated
as one that needs two slots.
(You know who you are.)
—Come to spring budgeting. Budgeting sessions
are on Saturday, Mar. 20
and Saturday, Mar. 27 in
Sharpies 111 (the little
building by the frats.) Show
up 5-10 minutes early for
your appointment, you may
be put of there quicker than
you expect. If you are going to miss your appoint—

ment for some unavoidable reason, please have
the courtesy to call x8348
and leave a message. The
committee will have a
packed schedule and sitting around waiting for
you does not help it to
budget other groups efficiently.
If you follow these
steps, your budgeting
process for the 19992000 school year will be
a success. After the whole
process is complete, the
committee will review its
allocations and compare
them to the funds they expect to bring in. If acrossthe-board cuts are necessary, you will be informed of your new allocations before the full
budget goes to Student
Council for approval.
Only after that approval
is granted are the budgets
actually final. Please contact the office if you have
any questions or visit the
SBC website at <http//

Swarthmore needs an

active support system
Freshman honeymoon came to an abrupt end for the Class of 99 in
the Fall of 1995.
OnNovember 15,1995, the late Gabriel Cavallari '97 hung himself
on a tree in the Crum woods. While almost three years have gone by,
the event has not been forgotten. The day ofthe suicide, a senior who
graduated last yearrecalled recendy, the usual rancor in Sharpies was
conspicuously absent and a profound feeling of griefemanated from
the crowd. "You could tell that something bad had happened," the
senior said.
Unfortunately, that death didnot mark the end ofwhat many considered the class of '99's brief fling with tragedy. Last month, Duncan
Kirkpatrick '9B, who entered Swarthmore with the Class of '99, was
found dead in nearby Media. The cause of death: suicide.
While two suicides in the past three years and only three in the past
twenty years hardly qualifies as statistically significant we believe
these most unfortunate incidents provide a good backdrop for the discussion ofwhat we think may be an emerging problem: the lack of an
active support system.
Everyone knows that Swarthmore is a hard school; workaholism is
our trademark. Yet the way we have sought to shape our public image
has purposefully, though understandably, glossed over the downside of
academic rigor. The intensity ofSwarthmore ismarketed under a facade
of non-competitiveness. Rarely will a campus tour end without the
tourguide mentioning that we don't care about our GPAs at Swarthmore
in fact, we are so indifferent towards GPA that the school does not
even compute it for you. It does not appear on your transcript.
But the fact is, grades do matter. All majors cany a GPA requirement. Getting into a good grad school requires an impeccable transcript. Getting a good job demands top-notch grades as well. Swat
students face an incredible amount of stress on a daily basis.
So who do they turn to whenthey get theirfirst-ever B on a paper? Their
friends?Are they even willing to swallow theirpride in order to admit that
they got a B ? And ifthey are, do theirfriends have time to listen?
Deans claim that their doors are always open and students are welcome to discuss anything with them. Indeed, the administration and
faculty are very accessible. Yet the pride factor again comes into play.
How do Swarthmore students relieve pressure? By partying hard at
OldeClub or DU over the weekend? That hardly suffices. And a onenight stand is not exactly the most proper way to deal with pressure.
As any psychologist will tell you, keeping your grievances to yourselfis not a good thing.
Deans would argue that a support system is, in fact, in place. President
Al Bloom in response to this editorial, will no doubtreflexively recite
with unparalleled precision the statistic that one in three Swatties consults Psych. Services during theirtime here.
Opponents of an activist support system will no doubtrespond with
the privacy argument what right does the school have to meddle
with a student's private matters? Where does privacy end and neglect begin?
What we are proposing here is of course not the resurrection ofBig
Brother but a systematic cultivation of a compassionate awareness
beyond the token stressmanagement workshops that are offered now.
We need to confront the fact that Swarthmore is a high-stress place,
and that stress can potentially be very destructive. And the campus
community needs to know this and learn how to deal with it, both in
their own personal fives, and more importantly, in the lives of people
they care about.
Knowing when to interfere with other people's business is an art,
which makes it even more important that we learn how to do so now.
It is clear that a blanket hands-off attitude is not the solution, and its
consequences can be devastating.

Why I hate the East Coast
by Josh Bess
Contributing Writer
I want to let you in on a little
secret: I hate the East Coast.
Well, maybe it's not that I hate
the East Coast (or even the
Middle Atlantic or the suburbs
of Philadelphia), but there are
things in this region of the
country that definitely piss me
off. I want to address three specifically, but there are plenty
more where these come from.
First, very few people here are
actually able to operate an automobile in a safe, competent
manner. Yes, I understand that I
am probably more easily angered while attempting the
"death-merge" from South
Street onto the Schuykill than
while sitting in Kohlberg, but
come on people, use your turnsignals! The minuscule effort
required to flip a little lever is
small compared to the benefit of
keeping your SUV dent-free.
Furthermore, where I come
from, the red octagon means
"stop." Whatever opinions you
have of us corn-producing
states that start with "I," people
there know that crashing their
new pickup truck into a combine can make you the laughing-stock of the 4:30 a.m.
breakfast group at the Farmer's
Cafe. Therefore, those sensible
folks actually stop at stop
signs. Obvidbsly, my friend
from Connecticut doesn't
worry about crashing her small
import auto into a combine,
which is why during a trip from
Wharton to John Harvard's,
she has the amazing ability to

run more stop signs than I can

count on one hand.

See, here's another advantage to living in one of the flat

In 2000 elections, it's all in the name
But Bush and Dole will need more than
name recognition to aid GOP in 2000
and 2004 White House bids
Americans will not cast their votes
for President for another year and a
half, but already the race has front-runners. Most pundits assume that Vice
President Gore will easily capture the
Democratic nomination, and the Republican nomination seems to be a tossup between Bush and Dole.
Wait a minute. Bush and Dole?
Wasn't that in 1988?
No, not the Bush and Dole who lost
elections in 1992
and 1996. The
presidential contenders this time
around are Texas
y
Gov. George W.
Bush and former
Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole.
That Bush's fa-.
E
ther was President
just six years ago and Dole's husband
ran for president two years ago seem
to have done them some good. In fact,
name recognition is arguably the only
thing pushing these two candidates far
ahead in the polls.
Ordinarily, Elizabeth Dole wouldn't
stand a chance. First, she is a woman,
and most Americans, let alone Republicans, aren't ready to make one commander-in-chief. More importantly, her
political experience is sketchy: her
(unelected) cabinet positions as Secretary of Transportation and Labor may
owe more to her husband's legendary
status in the U.S. Senate than anything
else. Even if she has broad popular appeal, primaries are usually dominated
by political insiders.
Gov. Bush, too, would not ordinarily
be a front-runner in the presidential elections. He has not even declared his can-

didacy, and he rarely leaves his home
state of Texas for publicity stunts. As a
result, few Americans—ordinary voters
and prominent politicos alike—know
where he stands on the issues. Bush is
less of a candidate than he is an icon.
Nevertheless, Bush and Dole are doing well. At a governors' conference
last week, The New York Times reover half of the United States'

Needless to say, Elizabeth and George W. are already outperforming their same-named
predecessors. Bob Dole, despite being the
Republican front-runner in 1996, was humiliated in the New Hampshire primary
by Pat Buchanan and went on to lose the
general election to President Clinton by
a large margin.
George Bush was Vice-President
when he ran for President in 1988, but
even then he did not have the popular
support his son has so long before Election Day. Dole and Bush have paved
the way for Dole and Bush.
However, it is important to note that
both Elizabeth Dole and George W.
Bush have strengths as candidates unrelated to name recognition. Dole, for
example, proved herself to be an extraordinarily talented speaker in the
1996 election. Her charisma more than

detriment. Dole has solid conservative
values, which Republicans insiders
want, and personal charm, which the
Republican Party desperately needs.
Bush, meanwhile, has a solid record
as chief executive in Texas, and he is
more moderate than most of the more
powerful Republicans. What is perhaps
most important is Bush's popularity
among Hispanic voters, who, as a
group, are increasingly becoming both
Democratic and influential at the polls.
Bush, who speaks Spanish fluently,
may be able to court Hispanic voters in
California and Florida in 2000.
These credentials are not enough,
though. There is a real danger that Bush
and Dole will quickly fade as the election nears and these candidates will remain silent or simply say the wrong
thing. Sooner or later, for example, it
will become well-known that Bush is
pro-life; this is inevitably alienate the
voters who are pro-choice and do not
yet know Bush's position on the issue.
And with Dole, women who were initially excited by the prospect of a female president may have trouble when
they compare her views to Gore's,
whose seem more in line with social
equality and women's rights.
Either candidate, of course, could
make a terrible mistake over the course
of the next 18 months. If the entire Republican Party becomes invested in one
candidate too early, a Dole or Bush
misstep could spoil GOP chances for
the White House in 2000 and 2004.
Voters should be wary of the Dole
and Bush behind the Dole and Bush,
but their scrutiny need not be limited
to the Republican Party. Al Gore is in
Washington (and has been most of his
child and adult life) mainly thanks to
his father, Sen. Al Gore, Sr. of Tennessee. And Hillary Clinton is considering a bid for Senator ofNew York.
With Bush, Dole, Gore and Clinton
in 2000, the millennium will have voters wondering what year itreally is.

Semester should be lengthened
by Andrew Fefferman
Contributing Writer
As I take my mid-term exams, the
realization that the semester is half over
sinks in. There is a body of people who
deep down believe that the semester is
too short. Believe it or not, there are
people here who would like to be in
school longer. This desire seems heretical to any student and especially for
those at Swarthmore, where learning is
often jokingly compared to torture.
Despite this, I believe that many students at Swarthmore do want to be in
school longer. I had a choice over
whether I would go to college, as did
everyone else who goes here. The suggestions of those around me coincided
with my own desires, so I didn't do
much thinking about whether I should
go to college, but it is true that I had a
choice. So the fact that I, and all the
other students here, are going to college suggests that we desire to be here.
The fact that we desire to be here does
not mean we that want to be here any
longer than we have to. After all, college can be thought of as just a means
to an end. However, some people would
like a longer semester. Some people
enjoy themselves more when they work
in fits and starts. If the work time is intense, the relaxation time feels all the
better. Others enjoy a more constant
and more leisurely pace of learning.
From my experience, neither way is
more efficient.
I enjoy a more leisurely and constant
pace of learning, so I am curious about
why the college semester is so much
shorter than the high school semester;

where does the decision about the
semester's length come from?
It could be tradition. Yet every tradition has an initial practical concern behind it. I can suggest a reason why the
college is shut down during January, the
coldest month of the year. By shutting
down the school, the college saves on
heating costs. This explains why the
winter break is so long. Though this is
one possible justification for a long
winter break, I wonder why the summer break is so long.
The summer is a time for research in
the science labs on campus, so those
that are involved in this protest any encroachment on the time they have during the summer. However, there may
be a fair amount ofair space surrounding the usually ten-week period of summer research. I do not know enough
about this issue to comment.
Although there would be some obstacles to lengthening the semester, it
might be possible. I wonder who would
be most opposed to lengthening the semester and for what reasons? Some
might object because the costs of a
longer semester would be too great.
After all, Swarthmore already spends
an average of $60,000 on each student.
However, it seems that the marginal
cost of operation over time would not
be very high.
It may be that much of this $60,000
sum is spent on getting the college
started again after a long break. For
instance, the maintenance workers must
be paid to go turn on the radiators at
PPR. Although the maintenance workers are not paid on a per radiator basis,
the total number ofman-hours required

to keep the campus going would go
down if the campus were not shut down
for winter break.
There are reasons to keep the campus closed over winter break, but it is
possible that there are analogous onetime costs of starting the school after
summer break. Another example is that
the number of days that school is in session does not affect the amount of time
spent by the grounds workers tending
to the plants. The one-time-only costs
ofrunning a school are not affected by
the total operating time.
This low marginal cost of operation
is similar to the operation of a train.
Once a train is started and is moving at
its cruising speed, there isn't much friction slowing the train down so not much
fuel is needed to keep the massive thing
going. At Swarthmore, working in fits
and starts is more expensive.
Assuming that Swarthmore is like a
train, those who have it in their interest
that the College work as efficiently as
possible might support the lengthening
of the semester. It is possible that some
people here don't want to work any
more hours than they have to, but this
does not seem to be the case. Many students would be in favor of a more leisurely pace of learning. Others, who
work in a cycle offits and starts, might
use the extra week to add another bout
of learning and then relaxation to their
sfemester.
There are many potential obstacles
to lengthening the semester, but there
are many benefits as well. Both the
College and its students can save costs
and headaches by going to school just
a little longer.

Sanctions
shouldn't be
lifted yet
from IRAQ, pg. 7
As for Mr. Halliday's motives, I felt
that he spoke from the heart in desiring
to end the suffering ofthe Iraqi people.
Nevertheless, in proposing that the sanctions on Iraq be lifted, he quite simply
failed to offer a viable alternative solution. Although I am not of the persuasion that the sanctions are helping to drive
Saddam from power, I do believe that
they have helped to weaken the dictator
militarily. Evidence of such can be seen
in the diminished amounts of conventionalarms wielded by the Iraqi military,
and in recent events in which Iraqi forces
attempted to shoot down American fighters with missiles designed for ground
combat, the reason being that the Iraqis
were simply out ofsurface-to-airmissiles
and had no way to obtain more.
In his lecture, Mr. Halliday in effect
demanded that sanctions on Iraq be
lifted purely on humanitarian grounds,
and damned be it if we have to shake
hands with the devil himself. Coming
from a realist perspective, however, I
simply cannot condone lifting the sanctions until someone offers a viable alternative to contain Hussein. As Iraq is
yet a nation engaged in the foul business of manufacturing terrorist weapons of mass destruction, I believe that
the interests of the American people
must come first in this case. There are
those who will take this view as a condemnation of the people of Iraq. Let
us remember, however, that it is
Saddam Hussein who started this mess,
not the United States.

Besides, with all of the telecommunications technology that is being
thrown at our generation, who needs
to live where everyone else does? It
makes perfect sense that states like
Pennsylvania are experiencing a
mass exodus of young people.
Would-be yuppies are finally figuring out that they can make their millions and live in Topeka. And
Beemers are cheaper in Topeka.
In closing, I have to throw in the
disclaimer that I love Swarthmore
College and its students and (unless
specifically noted) am not trying to
insult anyone personally. Now that I
have hopefully at least reduced the
hate mail response, I will say that I
have considered that it should be an
educational requirement to do a semester "abroad" in one of the 37
states (except California) that was
not an original colony, and preferably
one in the middle of the country.
Even people who disagree with everything in this piece agree that Swat
students lack a sense of reality.
There's nothing more real than driving down a wet road, thinking about
how happy you are that you don't live
in New York, then skidding through
a stop sign that you tried too hard to
stop at and crashing your reasonablypriced car into a pigpen. Not that I've
done that or anything.

Swarthmore and the Real World:
how to feel good about apathy

by Melissa Morrell
Contributing Writer

Swarthmore bubble shields students from the real world
by Mark Charette
Staff Writer
You've probably heard
someone on the Swarthmore
campus say something like
this recently: "That might be
true, but you always have to
remember that in the real
world most people wouldn't
do that."
This statement could have
been a response to a variety of
"politically correct" propositions: an argument in favor of
affirmative action, a call for
greater income equity or the
suggestion that someone not
use homophobic language.
All of these "idealistic" notions are "unrealistic" products of the leftist laboratory
we call Swarthmore College.
Outside the College's Pearly
Gates, no one is interested in
talking about affirmative action, income inequity or homophobia. Outside our hallowed arena of intellectual
gymnastics (in the "Real
World") people only think
about three things: alcohol,
hetero sex and cars.
Right?
The "Real World." In the
Real World, people read USA
Today (if they read at all). In
the Real World, one in ten
words uttered by men is "fag"
and women hate "feminazis."
Rush Limbaugh is daily
fare, and the television show
"Politically Incorrect" is the
closest thing to serious intellectual inquiry. "Community
building" takes place in
sports bars, and "diversity"

means planting a wide variety of farm crops.
To many Swarthmoreans,
the inhabitants of the Real
World are blind, simpleminded Noble Savages who
follow America's status quo
like a seeing-eye dog. They
work, come home, drink beer,
watch some TV and go to
sleep. Not one critical thought
crosses the mind of the Real
World Noble Savage, just visions of Miller Time on a

This mentality is reflected
in the treatment of environmental staff, who currently
do not receive many basic
benefits, such as child care.

rather than challenge it, regardless ofhow many controversial classes it teaches. In
this sense, Swarthmore is
completely out of touch with
the needs of most Americans,
who have not benefited from
the profit maximization of
companies like Philip Morris, nor the low-wage
economy created by employers like the College.
Opposing Swarthmore to
the "Real World" ofbeer and
sex is an excellent way to
avoid annoying arguments
about race, sexuality and
class. As many would have it,

colleges like Swarthmore are
the only places in America
where serious discussions of
social change take place.
If we conveniently ignore
the fact that some of the most
important social movements
in American history were
(and are) initiated by members of the working class
many of whom did (and do)
not attend elite institutions
this seems like a great theory.
In reality, institutions like
Swarthmore do not prepare
students to change society,
but instead to earn as much
money as possible in the
"Real World" and then give
a portion of it back to their
alma mater, which they have
been tricked into believing is
a force for social change (and
if nothing else, a tax break).
My point is not that the political activism and theorizon
ing taking
place
Swarthmore's campus are
unimportant, but that the College does not have a monopoly on complex thought
and political action. In an isolated environment like
Swarthmore, it becomes very
easy to generalize about a
"Real World" of simpletons
who follow directions and
keep their minds closed and
mouths shut.
By telling ourselves we
think much more deeply and
act much more responsibly
than the rest of society, we
create a wonderful excuse to
stop thinking critically about
the world and live like the
Noble Savage, who considers
only beer, sex and cars.

So, how did the trial affect me? Not at all! Although I got a kick out of

fact that nobody cared about whether

more often than not I dismissed it.
After all, what good is

While

that we are bombing their

I find this far more terrifying than ignoring morality, because morality will

I do not know if the

We are killing
people and we
do not care.

Most of you may not have
noticed, but there is a beautiful meadow of asphalt that has
been left fallow: the
Cunningham lot.
Those of you who even know
where it is, across from Trinity Church, on the corner of
College Ave. and SR 320,
probably don't know that it is
owned by the College, not the
church across the street.
The Cunningham lot, which
is close to Worth, Willets and
Mertz, is for faculty/staff permits only, unless you are one
of the lucky ones who managed to get a temporary permit
for the semester. However,
hardly any of the faculty and
staff ever use this lot, so most
of the time it is nearly empty.
While there is a major parking problem for students on
this campus, there is an apparent overabundance of parking
for faculty and staff. As written in a Phoenix article last issue, the lack of student permits
is forcing students to either
park illegally, move their car
around the Ville and onto College Ave., or pay the steep fees
the Ville is now asking for legitimate parking on Myers
Ave., $2O a month (though they
are already out of spaces for
this semester).
Meanwhile, a new lot was
added to upper campus near
the water tower, a lot which remains at best half empty. In a
survey ofthe water tower lot, I
found that there were 27 cars,
21 with permits, out of 51
spaces available, at 2:30 p.m.
on a Friday afternoon.
When I parked my car in
Cunningham recently, I was surprised to see how many cars
were parked there, since usually
there are so few. So I decided to
count cars. Out of the 34 cars
parked in the lot at 11:30 a.m.
on a Friday morning, only 3 of
them had faculty/staff permits.
Ten of the remaining cars were
students like me, blessed with a
temporary pass.
As for the rest, two or three
were students (my guess from
the out-of-state licenses and
the C-lot permit on the
bumper), and the rest appeared
to have no affiliation with the
College. I wonder how many
of them paid $30,000 to come
here to get denied a permit?
It seems irrational that we
have so many problems with
parking when there are spaces
that go unused. The irony, of
course, is that faculty and staff
do not want to park in
Cunningham because of its distance from the center ofcampus.
To make matters worse, students park in the places faculty
and staff don't want to park,
like College Ave. and other college lots, because there are not
enough spaces for students.
Itis important to note that the
blame for the mismanagement
of our parking should not be
placed on the enforcers of the
rules, such as Public Safety, but
rather on the College administrators who have chosen to let
good parking go to waste.

Maya Seligman ’99 leads highly
successful female-focused web tutorial
Seligman was particularly enthusiastic about teaching this class because of what she feels are the
unique opportunities of web publishing. She sees it as a medium
that “isn’t bound by traditional limits.”
Because web publishing is new
and has few set rules, Seligman
sees it as ideal for creative expression and exploration of one’s own
identity. She also highly values the
ability of the web to establish contact with people who would otherwise be inaccessible, noting that
she has received e-mails from
people all over the world who have
visited her web page.
In creating a web page, she advised, “Don’t be afraid of being
yourself.” She also encourages
people not to be intimidated by the
myth that HTML is difficult to
learn.
In particular, Maya is interested
in helping women, a group she
feels is underrepresented in web
publishing, overcome the misconception that creating a web site re-

quires impossible levels of technical wizardry.
She feels that learning about web
publishing is empowering, both
through its creative potential and
through the job opportunities that
proficiency in this method of communication can provide.
Seligman believes this can be especially important for women.
“I feel that it’s empowering that
I’m teaching the class myself and
I’m a woman”, she said.
She feels that more female involvement in web publishing simply involves breaking down the traditional belief system that perpetuates the idea that men are more interested in computers than women
are. She has found the turnout for
the classes heartening—approximately equal numbers of men and
women have attended.
The classes, which aim to encourage participants to share
knowledge, meet in the Dupont
computer cluster. The next meeting will take place the weekend

Studying Women:
The creation of the Women’s Studies
concentraton at Swarthmore
by Hilary Rice
Contributing Writer

For many years, the Women’s
Studies program has been an established and accepted part of
the College’s academic offerings. But that was not always
the case.
The idea for the program grew
out of the 1982 report of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Women’s
Concerns. The Committee originally included divisions to study
the quality of life of female students, women in the academic
program, women faculty members, women on the staff, equal
opportunity and security and
safety. Its 1982 report to the
President of the College, David
Fraser, included more than 60
recommendations, among which
was “the necessity of laying a
groundwork for the Women’s
Studies Program.”
Women’s Studies was not a new
idea. The Women’s Studies movement had been growing since the
19605, a product of the “general
reexamination of broad social issues” that occurred in that decade.
By the time Swarthmore began
debating creating a program, over
30,000 Women’s Studies courses
were offered on campuses across
the nation, and Women’s Studies
programs were in place at over
300 institutions, including, says
the proposal given to the faculty,
“many colleges and universities to
which Swarthmore is often compared.”
Modeled on the Black Studies
Concentration, the proposal emphasized the existing support
for the program, and how few
additional resources would be
necessary for its implementation. Since traditional monetary
support from the College for
such programs ranged from zero
to fifty dollars (a shoestring
budget at any time), the committee attempted to create a program that could be largely supported by existing faculty and
course offerings.
While their formal proposal
lay within existing resources,
the committee also urged the
future hiring of new faculty
members who could teach
courses in the program, and the
support of existing faculty’s research and development of new
courses. The original program
included about a dozen courses
per year in six to eleven depart-

ments. Today the program regularly offers nearly seventy
courses in sixteen different departments.
Although the existing Women’s
Studies courses were popular
with students, not everyone on
campus fully favored the new
concentration. Editorials from
The Phoenix during the debate
highlight some students’ suspicion of the political ideology behind the program.
One relatively positive editorial gives a sense of the ideological division within the student
body. It states, “Women’s Studies is a rapidly expanding field
of intellectual inquiry, and it is
something that should be studied
by everyone, not just the same
core group of feminists who take
all available Women’s Studies
courses together.”
Expressing the fear many
people shared about feminism, a
later editorial asks, “Why does it
seem that every teacher and student of Women’s Studies shares
not just a concern for women, but
an interest in fundamentally restructuring society?”
The structure and goals of the
program have changed little in
the nearly fifteen years since jts
inception. Concentrators are still
required to take a minimum|pf
five credits, including Women’s
Studies 91, the3senior Seminar,
though the Introduction >to
Women’s Studies (WS 1) course
is a newer offering.
The purpose of the program has
changed slightly, though. While
the original proposal alludes to
the relation of women to race,
class, nationality, and sexuality,
the study of these areas was not
explicitly stated in the goals of
the program, as it is now. This
change was one of several revisions of the Program in the early
19905, revisions that also included a re-evaluation of the
capstone, or Senior Seminar.
One of the students on the proposal Committee, Melanie
Phillpot ‘B6, believed the concentration was necessary “because it will be easier than to get
a [Women’s Studies] major.” She
added, however, that “given the
time it’s taking to get a concentration, I don’t know how long it
will be before we get a major.”
As the Women’s Studies Program
enters its fifteenth year without
any signs of becoming a major,
it appears that Phillpot was correct in her judgment.

THE SWAKTHMORE PHOENIX

ARTS &

LIVING

SCREWED!

Conan victor in latenight talk show wars
A long time ago (1993) in a
galaxy far, far away (whatever
your hometown may be) there
was a momentous battle. Forget the Persian GulfWar, civil
war in the
former Yugoslavia,
or
Keanu Reeves'
war on good
acting. When
we look back
in twenty years
on the great
conflicts of the
'9os, there will
be one battle royale that stands
out above all others: the latenight talk show wars.
You remember them, don't
you. In just two months, August and September, four major late-night talk shows debuted actually Leno debuted
in like May, but let's not let the
facts get in the way of a good
phrase and faced off both for
audience ratings and positive
spin in the over-hyped entertainment press. NBC had just
recently given the "Gee whiz
I'm a nice guy who's earned
my spot" Jay Leno the role
he'd been kissing ass for for
almost a decade as Johnny
Carson's replacement on "The
Tonight Show."
Meanwhile, CBS lured
David Letterman, the man who
brought in the younger crowd
with what was then original
sardonic humor, away with an
insanely generous contract
around $8 million or so—after
he was seriously miffed over
not getting the "Tonight Show"
berth he thought was rightfully
his.
And Fox, always known for
pushing the envelope, brought
the man America couldn't get
enough of, Chevy Chase, to the
airwaves with a show that embarrassed every American save
perhaps Joan Rivers, whose
own 1985 Fox late night show
has previously been heralded
as the worst pollution of the
airwaves after 11:00.
Oh, and that fourth competitor in the race? Well he was
barely noticed by most. Just
this goofy, lanky, former
"Simpsons" writer who inexplicably got the job taking over
"Late Night" following David
Letterman's defection to CBS.
But he was on after all the other
guys, at 12:30, and he certainly
didn't seem to have much talent. Critics dismissed him as
awkward and inaccessible, and
the biggest name he could nab
for his debut show was B-lister
John Goodman. Nobody gave
Conan O'Brien much ofa shot,
not even his bosses at NBC
who were renewing his contract in minuscule increments
of a couple of months.
In the high pressure entertainment industry, however, a
lack of attention is often the
best thing you can ask for (at
least if you already have your
own TV show, which is perhaps more than most struggling actors and writers can ask
for).
Since Conan was the lowest
man on the late-night totem
pole, he had both the least
amount of press attention and
the lowest expectations. That

Lesbian rocks the proverbial house
by Mimi Hanaoka
Managing Editor
"You can't expect everything to go perfectly in experimental, radical, queer puppet
theater, can you?" joked Jess
Dobkin, director and lead in
"From the Waist Up and
Down", a lesbian performance-art piece presented by
the Sager Committee on Monday, March 1, in the Scheuer
Room. Dobkin's essentially
one-woman show may have
been disjointed, but the performance proved highly entertaining and successfully projected an unflinching message
of lesbian liberation.
Dobkin's performance
opened to quizzical laughter
which later built to a dull roar
as Dobkin continued her rambling and neurotic monologue
spoken to the pitch-black
room. The segue to the next
section ofthe piece failed due
to technical difficulties to
which Dobkin freely admit-

ted, a lapse which was symptomatic of the informal and
conversational nature of the
performance.
While Dobkin experienced
several such blunders during
her show, the humor of the
piece coupled with the forgiving nature of the audience carried "From the Waist Up and
Down" through to its successful conclusion.
Dobkin and the two other
members of her ensemble primarily used paper mache
masks and sculptures as
props; the props resembled
grade-school art projects—colorful, uneven, garish,
kitsch—rather like the show
itself.
Costumes ranged from a
man sporting prosthetic
breasts from which water
spouted to an electronic pencil sharpener hidden beneath
Dobkin's red taffeta skirt
which she used to sharpen
pencils belonging to members
of the audience. Props in-

eluded an extremely large
hand which served Purim
cookies, a wreath of light
bulbs worn as a hat that
perched precariously on
Dobkin's head and a miniature
puppet stage, complete with
stage curtains, balanced on
Dobkin's head.
A giant story book constructed from textured paper
titled "The Joys of Singlehood" exemplified Dobkin's
style of presenting material in
a simplified and exaggerated
style to communicate the humorous banalities of life.
Dobkin brought forth the massive book, with large rectangles cut through its pages so
that each page formed a
frame, and projected images
from a slide projector onto the
story book to engage the audience in the simplistic story
of a self-deprecating woman
celebrating her singlehood.

little pressure
gave Conan
time to find his audience. That
was a luxury the others didn't
have, which is why poor Chevy
Chase came and went in a humiliating six weeks during
which he was unflaggingly
made fun of by the venomous
entertainment press and
avoided by decent guests like
Bill Clinton at a debutante ball.
Chevy actually did have a few
funny moments—yes, I admit
it, I did watch his show —but
like Poland in World War 11, he
was an early casualty in a war
between much better equipped
powers.
Both Letterman and Leno
did manage to survive and
carve out their own niche audiences: Leno with middleaged middle-class parents who
want their humor as un-risque
as possible before they go to
bed; and Letterman with aging
Gen X-ers who think irony and
smarminess are still the greatest innovations in TV comedy.
Along with "Nightline," they
have been part of a teetering
triumvirate of 11:35-12:35
shows, none of which has ever
been able to pull ahead enough
to put the others out of commission.
As everyone focused on the
battle,
Leno-Letterman
though, Conan stole the trophy
out from under their noses. No,
he hasn't grabbed higuer ratings or public recognition than
those two; that would be impossible in the 12:35-1:35 time
slot. He did, however, take the
critical trophy as by far the
most original and consistently
hilarious show on TV. His
"Late Night" has turned out to
be the most clever, relevant and
ballsy show on in late-night.
Conan and his writing staff
are willing to try just about
anything, with skits with ridiculously poor production
values that either hit the mark
hilariously or are so bad that
you can't help but smile anyway, both at the wackiness of

Wigglesworth, Sawallish lead Philly Orchestra
On February 20 the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Wolfgang
Sawallish, performed some of Mozart
and Beethoven's richest works. This
program of orchestral lustre featured
acclaimed pianist
Murray Perahia performing Beethoven's
"Piano Concerto 4."
The concert began
with Beethoven's
"Overture to Konig
Stephan." Rapidly
composed during a
three week period in )
which he produced
nineteen hasty works to satisfy royal
demands, this work somewhat reflects
the urgency of its production. This overture contains many of the same basic
elements of "Ode to Joy," such as its
open sound and the way it spreads on
such a large scale. Composed shortly
before his final symphony, Beethoven's
grandest mindset emerges from this
work.
Composed several years before
"Konig Stephan" amidst a storm of
gushing musical invention, the Fourth
Piano Concerto stands on a different
ledge. It conveys a heartfelt message
with a remarkable degree of subtly and
places a great load upon the performer.
Unlike his prior piano concertos, this
work begins with the piano. Throughout the performance, the orchestra
played with restraint, which made
Perahiah more than an integral part of
the performance. In fact this concerto
almost seemed like a pianist's solitary
meditation.
He performed the opening theme
softly withremarkable sensitivity. Once
accompanied by some very thin orchestration, the vague mystery of the work
began. What followed was an amazing
flow ofthe contemplative theme in the
first movement, Allegro moderato.
The second movement, Andante con
moto, began with a robust introduction
followed by an anemic reply from the
piano—a remarkable juxtaposition.
The pianist escaped into a meditative
bubble and his solitary movements
were wisps of smoke. The musical ges-

tures ofthis movement were extremely Shostakovich's "Cello Concerto No. 1,"

[craftier,

Isserlis represented the common stereotype of the brilliant performer; his
modicum of curly hair bounced with
his passionate attacks on the cello,
some of them executed with enough
force to not make a sound. Such extreme gestures provoked a comical response from the audience. Many made
comments about his hair as he walked
onto the stage.
The piece began immediately with
the roving theme, played on the cello
with an unbelievably abrasive sound.
Throughout most of the opening Allegretto, the cellist played arduously resting only during the brief and razzled
orchestral outbursts. Yet this piece not
only featured the cellist, but a host of
other instruments, such as the horns and
woodwinds, who introduced the ideas
that the cello would answer.
After the forceful ending of the first
movement, the slow tempo of the
Moderato presented a dramatic difference, as the billowing french horns give
way to the strings who lyrically evoked
a slow disintegration. The cellist played
with his thinnest sound yet in this
movement, with a large part of this
movement in the higher register. The
theme returned in this movement, surrounded by a fortified sound in the
strings, before the movement ended
with bells and the soft playing of the
cello in the highest register.
The rich lower register of the Cadenza immediately contrasted with the
end of the last movement. The
pizzicatos seemed to be the greatest
moments of Isserlis's concentration
within this movement. He played this
frenzied movement designed to showcase his skills with astonishing power
and agility at the same time. The orchestra returned and repeated the
theme, for the briefand highly charged
Adagio lamentoso.
For his performance, Isserlis received
a near standing ovation, and an interesting reaction from the cellists in the
orchestra. Some smiled, possibly out of
amazement, while others remained
stolid as if intimidated by him. The
greatest applause occurred when the
cello itself bowed.

hard to endure. They could be

group of people with surly or
timid looks, I'd imagine, playing in a palace, probably, on a
marble stage among pillars
with ivy hanging off. They
shouldn't have a crowd, but
crowds, acting hectic and busy,
doing palace things like carrying pails of water and strewing petals, under torch light.
The concert would be frightening and oppressive, though
that is not to say I wouldn't
jump at the chance for a ticket.

Once again, not halfbad. Actually, the Danielson Family is
really cool. They really are a
big Christian family, brothers
and sisters and whatnot, but
their name is not Danielson,
it's Smith. Big brother
Danielson started the punk-inflected folk band for his senior
thesis at Rutgers, and it just has
not stopped.
Sometimes the family sings
together, and sometimes
brother tours and sings alone.
Apparently, in concert,
brother Danielson will frequently don a big papier
mache "Tree of Life" and play
and sing about God inside of
it. Given all this background,
you shouldn't be too surprised
when you first hear their music. It's all right to be a little
surprised though.
Brother and all his siblings
are screechy-voiced dweebs.
From its conception in the
questionable mind of Brother,
the band's primary motif, I
guess, has consisted of a se-

riousness forced upon youth
and twisted into inanity. In a
fine interpretation of the Sunday school classic, "He's Got
the Whole World in His
Hands," recorded before a
live audience, they sing,
"He's got the brothers and the
sisters in his hands
He's
got the mommas and the
He's
poppas in his hands
got the junkies and the flunkies and the flunkies in his
hands
He's got the eyeballs at the beach in his
hands, he's got the eyeballs
at the beach in his hands."
What does it mean?
The instrumentals (Brother's
guitar and some percussion)
are kind of weak, but once
music is taken past a certain
line, these things become unimportant. One should not listen to this music for music, or
for "novelty," for that matter.
The Danielson Family is just
too interesting a cultural phenomenon to be lumped into either of these categories. So
what to do with this? How to
approach it? Well, when we
watch a movie that isn't a comedy or an action flick or a tearjerker, we call it a character
study or a documentary. That
seems fitting.

conferences with the team
was an awesome experience," she said. "I love the
team as a whole and was
very excited to be there
with everyone. Even if I
hadn't swum well it still
would have been a great to
see everyone else compete.
"Last year I didn't swim
at all and I had forgotten
what it was like to be a
member of a team, and this
year has been fun because
our team is so close and
fun to be with."
Instead of going home to
Greece over spring break,
Bonarou will be traveling
to Miami of Ohio to compete at Nationals in 200 fly
and 200 IM. Joining her
will be Cathy Po.linsky
'99, who will be competing in 100 fly.

Women ruggers trounce
Widener, 43-0

Contributing Writers

The women's rugby team shutout Widener in their first scrimmage of the season,
file photo

The Women's Rugby team annihilated Widener by a score of
43-0 last Saturday in their first
scrimmage of the season.
Widener was unprepared for
the game, showing up to the
field with only 12 players, the
result of whic was Swarthmore
having to donate a few of their
own players to keep the game in
motion.
Although forced to play
against their own teammates, the
Swarthmore ruggers got off to a
quick start when Danielle
D'Olivera 'OO looped into the
try zone after only a minute and
a half of playing time. Widener
attempted to regroup, but it was
soon apparent that it was not
their day. Noelle Goodin 'OO
swooped into the try zone to
score again, and Nancy Craig
'Ol hit the conversion, bringing
the score to 12-0.
Back co-captain Meghan
Brennan 'OO scored the final try

of the first of three twenty
minute periods.
It became clear by the second
period that Widener's inexperienced scrum, which kept collapsing, was endangering players,
prompting the referee call for uncontested scrums. Swat forwards
kept their heads despite this setback, and when senior co-captain
Sarah Cross pulled the ball from
a ruck and barreled into the try
zone, Craig brought the score to
24-0 by nailing the conversion.
Refusing to be outdone, Cathy
Vaughan 'Ol answered Cross' try
with one of her own.
Elizabeth Meehan 'Ol put the
ball down for another five points
in the third and final period, and
rookie flanker Meredith Hegg
'OO ran one in herself. Craig
kicked two more conversions for
an extra four points, widening
the gap between the struggling
Widener team and the Garnet.
The team's next game is scheduled
for March 20th. Swarthmore will be
hosting Williams, one of the strongest teams in the league. Itpromises
to be an exciting match.

Swimmers take 2nd in conf.
by Jill Belding
Sports Editor
Garnet swimming concluded
its regular season with second
place finishes for both the men
and women's teams at the Centennial Conference Championship. Only the Gettysburg Bullets finished ahead of the
Swarthmore squad.
The intense three-day meet
began with the 200 freestyle
relay. For the women, Jenny
Harvey '99, Cathy Polinsky
'99, Alice Bonarou 'O2 and
Amy Auerbach 'O2 sprinted to
a fourth-place finish. On the
men's side, Keith Earley '99,
Ryan Fruh '99, Yasu Denda 'O2
and Ted Sherer 'Ol changed the
image of the former Bomb
Squad relay by setting a college record and placing third.
The individual events began
with a bang for the women
when Auerbach won the 500
freestyle and Mari McCrann
'OO finished fourteenth.
Bonarou won the next event for
the Garnet, the 200 individual
medley, with a college record
and National B cut. Alissa
Parmelee 'Ol rounded out the
final heat in eighth place while
co-captains Harvey and Jill
Belding '99 finished tenth and
twelfth respectively. Lisa
Ladewski 'O2 finished 16th in
a personal best time.
Later in the meet, Claire
Arbour 'OO proved herself to be
powerful sprinter, taking home
the bronze in the 50 freestyle,
while Polinsky placed eleventh. Sarah Marsh 'OO continued to be consistent, swim-

ming a solid time in prelims.
Auerbach, Harvey, Polinsky
and Arbour combined in the
400 medley relay for a silver
medal.
The women also touched in
second place in the 200 medley relay with Auerbach, Melissa Amir-Arjomand 'OO,
Polinsky and Arbour representing Swarthmore. In the 400
individual medley, Bonarou
took another gold medal in college record and a National B
cut time. Erica Rosenthal 'OO
finished eighth in an outstanding time, while McCrann took
eleventh in a personal best
time. Allison Lyons 'O2 displayed both physical and mental endurance, finishing sixteenth in the event.

took second place, while
Belding finished fifth.
Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO placed
tenth. JoDe Hendrick 'OO
achieved personal best time in
the 100 butterfly. With sole

she could and won the event in
a national qualifying time.
Amir-Arjomand shocked the
conference competition with a
National B cut on her way to
gold in the 100 breaststroke.
Harvey rounded out the top 8,
while Ladewski finished 10th.
In the 100 backstroke
Auerbach and Becca HowesMischel 'Ol placed first and
second. The powerhouse team
of Arbour, Harvey, Bonarou
and Auerbach combined to win
the 800 freestyle relay.
Auerbach concluded her

meet with a silver in the 1650
freestyle, while McCrann
broke the 19 minute mark, finishing fifth in the grueling
event. Shari Linden '99 recorded a personal best time in
the same event. Backstroker
Howes-Mischel took silver
again in the 200, while
Parmelee finished 7th in race
out of pure dedication and
heart.
Rosenthal and
Newcomb finished 12th and
14th respectively. Swimming
another B cut, Arbour touched
out her competition and won
the 100 freestyle.
Amir-Arjomand, Harvey and
Ladewski all had strong swims
in the 200 breaststroke, placing fifth, sixth and twelfth respectively. The final heat ofthe

the final event, the Garnet team
of Arbour, Harvey, Bonarou
and Polinsky finished second
in the 400 freestyle relay.
The women finished with
593 points, with Bonarou,
Auerbach and Arbour topping
the individual scorers in first,
second and fourth place.
Bonarou was named the
woman Swimmer of the Meet.
The men's meet was more
exciting with regard to team
scores. While Gettysburg ran
away with victory on both
sides, a battle brewed between
Swarthmore and Franklin &
Marshall for second place. The
Garnet pulled ahead on the final day to beat F&M by 13.5

points. The importance of every point the men scored from
first to sixtheeenth was only
more
profound
when
Swarthmore's sign was raised
above the Diplomats'.
Josh Farber 'O2 began the
individual competition with a
fourteenth-place finish in the
500 freestyle. Co-Captains
Earley and Fruh both swam
well in the 200 individual medley, garnering third and fifth

Dickson 'OO rounded out the
final heat in seventh and
eighth, while Aymeric Pansu
'Ol swam an outstanding time
to finish 10th. Nik Johnson 'Ol
and Tsong Lin 'OO both swam
personal bests in the 100 butterfly, placing 12th and 14th.
Fruh took on tough competition in the 200 freestyle, but
ended up finishing fifth in one
of the deepest events.
The men continued the reign
of Swarthmore breaststrokers,
finishing first, second and third

in the 100. Sherer led the way
in National B cut time, while
Gerson and Denda were close
behind. Dickson swam a personal best time in the 100 backstroke to touch in at sixth place,
while Gabe Turzo 'Ol finished
thirteenth. The 800 freestyle
relay team of Sherer, Johnson,
Denda and Dickson finished
sixth with strong swims by all.
The mile proved to be a
strong event for the Garnet
with Seaman taking 10th while
Pansu touched in 12th and Lin
in 14th. All three men later
went on to succeed in the 200
Butterfly with Seaman taking
Bth, Pansu 9th and Lin 10th.
Each man proved to have the
might to double up two of the
hardest events on the same day.
Johnson also swam the 200
butterfly in a lifetime best time,
finishing fourth.
Earley took silver with a personal best time in the 200 backstroke, and Dickson accomplished another personal best,
placing 6th. Turzo and Farber

breaststroke with a college and
conference record, a National
B cut and a gold medal. Gerson
took silver while Denda placed
fourth. In the 400 freestyle relay, Denda, Earley, Dickson
and Fruh finished fourth.
While most swimmers are
drying offfor a while, Bonarou
and Polinsky are on their way
to Nationals in Ohio over
Spring Break.

Women's basketball ends
season with a .500 season
by Jean Quinn

Sports Editor

The women's basketball
team ended their season with
a 55-47 victory over arch-rival
Haverford to give the team
their first .500 season since the
mid-1980s. In addition,
Heather Kile' 02 became the
first Swarthmore player and
the first rookie in the history
of the Centennial Conference
to win first team All-Conference honors.
Between the team's rout of
Muhlenberg and the final contest with the Fords though, the
Garnet traveled to Gwynedd
Mercy where they dropped a
one-sided contest, 72-43. The
height and overall athleticism
of the Griffins proved too
much for Swat. The squad
trailed by 20 at the half and
never pulled within reach. Kile
led the way with 15 points and
19 rebounds, while Katie Tarr
'O2 added 11 points and 5
boards.
The team regrouped and
pulled out a 55-47 victory to
close the season at Haverford.
The Fords were without their
premiere player, Carmen
Crow, who has gone abroad.
The Garnet could not shake the
tenacious Fords until the closing minutes however, when

Swarthmore's full court pressure coupled with key steals
and baskets by Heather
Marandola 'Ol put the game
permanently out of reach.
Marandola finished the night
with 18 points and 5 assists,
while Kile added 17 points and
17 rebounds.
"It showed the character of
the team that we were able to
shake the loss to Gwynedd
Mercy off and pull out a win
in our last game to help us
reach our .500 goal. Everyone
knew at the beginning that we
could be .500, but it was not
an easy road to get there. We
remained focused on our goal
and our persistence paid off,"
commented Kile.
Coach Adrienne Shibles
added, "I do not think we
played especially well at
Haverford. The women were
really tired from two extremely
tough games on Tuesday and
Thursday. However, they really
picked it up at the end of the
game. The Haverford crowd
was intense, but the women did
not let the pressure get to them.
It really showed how much our
team has matured over the
course of the season."
The Haverford game was
the final contest for senior
Jean Quinn. "Jean has made
a huge difference to our bas-

ketball program," said
Shibles. "She leaves as one
of just six women to tally
over 500 points, 500 rebounds and 100 steals, and
she has certainly set the example for the younger players as someone with a great
work ethic, determination
and desire. There aren't many
players out there who enjoy
stepping in front of someone
to take the charge. Jean is
one of those rare individuals."
The win placed the Garnet
in third place in the Eastern
division of the conference,
tied with Ursinus, and behind
Muhlenberg and Washington.
The 7-8 conference record
was the squad's best showing
since the formation of the
conference. Forward Kile,
who recorded 22 out of 24
possible double-doubles this
year, was named to the
conference's first team. The
other members of the elite
team include forward Megan

Men's rugby wins
two to topple
Widener, Albright
by Tony Sturm
Contributing Writer
The men's rugby team convincingly won two matches
this weekend, handily defeating the squads ofWidener and
Albright. Swarthmore led off
the day with a dominating 205 victory that's point total
could have been even higher
had they converted their conversions. After a brief break,
in which they witnessed
Albright slip by Widener 130, Swarthmore completed the
sweep with a 22-0 victory
against Widener.
In the first match,
Swarthmore got on the board
early with a try from Tony
Sturm '99, who slid into the
corner of the try zone with the
ball for the score. Soon after,
Adam Booth 'OO chased down
his own kick and ran in for a
try of his own, making the
score f 0-O. Albright got on
the board late in the first half
with a long run by one of thenbacks who broke several tackles
scoring.
before
Swarthmore answered soon
after with another try from
Sturm, who corralled a fluttering pass from Booth and
loped in for points.
The second half saw
Swarthmore shore up their de-

fense and score again. This
try was by newly-convertedback-to-forward Mike Sheer
'99. He caught the ball on one
of the Evil Buzzards' favorite plays, a short line out, and
dove in from five meters out
for the score.
Despite the persistent rain
and obscenely muddy pitch,
Swarthmore did a good job of
keeping the ball in their possession and did not commit
many errors. They kept this
up and then some in their second game against a disappointed Widener team.
Jerome Bushnell '99 scored
early when he pulled the ball
out of a ruck and scrambled
in for the try. Booth enjoyed
a shot at fly half, blocking a
kick which was touched
down by Sheer for five more
points.
Dan Green '99 adjusted to
a position long abandoned,
setting up Booth for Booth's
second try on the day. Rookies Matt Kahn '99 and Wilson Muy 'OO both nearly became Zulu warriors very early
in their first campaign, while
the rest of the rookies who
saw their first significant action also had strong showings. In sum, it was deemed a
successful afternoon for the
home team.

your modern liberal arts education.
Funny forges a community spirit by
bringing together diverse groups in
laughter. But a funny program needs
funny students. Clearly, the lot of you
aren't pulling your weight; ergo, something drastic needs to be done. And that
something has the sweet stench of recruiting.
Here's what we propose:
The administration would prove its
love to us by getting "funny" tattooed
on its ass. That, and by recruiting promising funny high-schoolers and letting

them into the college with substantially
lower standards than we expect from
ordinary applicants. Oh, and they'll get
sweet financial aid packages. And keys
to the student council vans, until cars
are donated by a wealthy, shadowy
alumni figure who owns either a car
dealership or a chop shop.
Spike went to have a few words
with well-known Presidential figure
President Alfred H. Bloom about the
future of the funny program, monkeys, and his upcoming role in The
Phantom Menace.

AB: Maybe all you need is for the
College Budget Committee to allocate
maybe $200,000 out of its $300,000
budget and give it to you.
S: We could change how people
thought of Swarthmore and start to establish us as a school with a worldclass funny program.
AB: But I mean, we're an educational
institution. The point is to bring people
in with the talent to be educated, to
become a great humorist if they want,
and I think that's wonderful.
S: 50...n0 breaks in the admissions
process?
AB: I think it would be difficult at
this point to conceive of that.
S: And Financial Aid breaks, you
think we shouldn't even ask for that?
AB: Well, they're getting such wonderful packages already. I mean we're
picking in the smartest and cleverest court jester, maybe as an intern position ?
