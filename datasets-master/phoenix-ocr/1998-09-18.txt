PC influx causing big problems
for college Computing Center

The company that provides
laundry machines for the college is threatening to pull out because students are tampering
with their washers and dryers.
Caleco Services, the outside
company who owns the machines, says that the level of
vandalism by Swarthmore students was one higher than at
other institutions. It complains
that Swarthmore students are
jamming the coin and time
mechanism in the washers and
dryers, which in turns allow
them to run continuously.
Caleco will start installing
sleeves onto the machines to
prevent future vandalism, but if
this is unsuccessful, the company may remove the machines
from all the dormitories.
The Facilities Office and
the Office of Residential Life
have received increasing reports
this past year about vandalism
to the laundry machines in the
residence halls, especially at
Willets, Wharton, and Mertz.
"People are using butter
knives and sticking them into
the side panels of the coin slots,"
said one student who wished to
have his name withheld. "They
then jiggle them around attempting to hit a lever which
causes the machine to operate."

Tampering with the coin
slots not only damages the machines, but robs Caleco ofrevenue, said Myrt Westphal, Assistant Dean of the College, in
an e-mail she sent to resident
advisors.
"Not only is this bad for the
machines," she said, "but it is
also theft. Yes, theft of energy
and income to the laundry machine company."
She warned that students
who are caught tampering with
the machines can be tried under
a court of law for stealing.
If the incidents continue and
none of the criminals are apprehended, Westphal suggests that
all the students in that particular dorm might be penalized and
have to pay for the repair ofthe
machines.
Aran Mohan 'OO, a residential advisor in Hallowell,
speculates that one of the reasons why students engage in
such activities is the high costs
and low quality of laundry service.
"I empathize with these students," said Mohan. "If you
could dry clothes with fifty cents
instead of costing two dollars,
there wouldn't be the problem.
The company should face up to
the facts that laundry machines
aren't functioning up to par."
Caleco was unavailable to
respond to Mohan

Paris article admittedly
culturally ignorant
Dear Editors,
Since my article about my trip to Paris appeared last
week, I've gotten a lot of strong feedback from people,
both personally and indirectly. Several friends approached me and said they liked it; others, from what I
was told, interpreted the article as narrow-minded and
insensitive, a skewed portrayal of Paris prompted by
some negative experiences I had.
Upon first hearing of the criticism, I decided that I
wouldn't respond to it, reasoning that journalists can't
please everyone. However, I came to realize that what I
wrote was bigger than that. Looking at the article from
the point of view of the people who found it offensive, I
suddenly saw it as they did. And I admit, I now feel
ashamed of it.
As I sat down to write the article, my main objective
was to convey my impression of Paris, as a first-time
visitor, in a humorous way. Thinking of Dave Barry, the
hilarious syndicated columnist, as my role model, I tried
to make my article into something at which readers would
laugh.
As I pushed the humor aspect, though, I lost sight of
the piece from a neutral perspective. What I didn't realize
then was that I was inadvertently trashing the French. My
amusing comparisons, as I saw them, were actually meanspirited denouncements of French culture as seen by an
insecure and somewhat resentful visitor.
So, those of you who were offended by the piece,
please accept my apologies. What I presented was a onesided view of Paris, tainted by my foreignness to the city
and its culture—and I'm sorry. For the record, I firmly
believe that no way of life is inferior to any other and
that none should be put down by a foreigner. I don't know
what came over me.
An extraordinary man by the name of Azouz Begag
put it best when he said, "Man is the enemy of what he
ignores."
I shouldn't have been so ignorant, and I'm sorry.

dents feel pressured by the overwhelming liberal spirit and are
either absorbed, silenced, or
pushed to extremism. In classrooms, conservative students are
silent or feel forced to compromise their beliefs; either is a loss
of unique ideas and original
thought, which hurts discussion
and weakens arguments. As aresult, liberal students are left with
nobody to question their beliefs,
and grow deluded into thinking
that their idea is the only one,
and therefore correct.
So, what's the big deal?Well
that depends on your perspective. I think the beauty of learning is the interchange of different ideas. To consider watering
ideas down, distorting them or
suppressing them is harmful to
learning. In order to promote a
free exchange of ideas, I suggest
eliminating Swarthmore's liberal majority. I am not asking
everyone to switch their political orientation, but I would
strongly suggest three things.
First, examine what you truly
believe about politics, discard
what has been imposed upon you,
and make decisions for yourself.
Second, tell people these opinions! Do not be selfish, keeping
all of these original opinions to
yourself. Share them with the rest
of us so everybody can benefit
from original thoughts. Finally,
realize that other people are doing the same thing you are and
recognize that their opinions are
just as valid as yours. The effort
involved in keeping yourself open
to new ideas is definitely worth
the gain of a superior campus en-

As the collapse of the Soviet empire ushered in the
19905, the United States became
the world's sole superpower, a
title it retains to this day. This
terminology initially seemed
strange, as the two superpowers
had been defined in terms of the
other as the adversary. To this
day, the existence of a single superpower has remained a somewhat oxymoronic concept. A
single superpower operates on
a thin line, balancing between
using its power for responsible
leadership and misusing it in its
own interests. While hoping to
garner respect for its special status as the sole superpower, the
United States has been faced
with this very dilemma in recent
years.
The Persian Gulf War of
1990-1991 presented the first
real test of the so-called New
World Order. Although it was
essentially a war over oil, the
alliance created and led by the
United States was impressive in
its scope; much of NATO,
former Warsaw Pact countries,
and even Arab League states

were included. This ability to
unite, however, was due in part
to the country's exceptional status as a superpower.
However, after a bloody but
short war, Saddam Hussein remained in power. Measures to
protect groups whom Saddam
had persecuted such as the
Kurds and Shiite Muslims broke
down. In later years, around the
world where there were no safeguards, bloody diplomatic intervention to mediate internecine
conflicts in Bosnia, Somalia,
and Rwanda was tardy and inadequate, a pattern repeated today in Kosovo.
Quite reasonably, American
officials are loathe to sacrifice
American lives in wars abroad
which lack the political payoff
or economic immediacy of the
Persian Gulf War. At the same
time, however, the lack of attention given to diplomacy in these
hotspots does not reflect well
upon the status of the United
States as a superpower. The
United States has been further
weakened by the Clinton
administration's repeated insistence on a double standard in international treaties.

On Monday, three supporters of murdered Albanian

with two others killed with him
last week outside the capital's

the office of conservative Prime

guards fired upon and killed the

This sparked protesters to seize

that the government resign. The

by Jessica Carew Kraft
Contributing Writer

This semester, Rabbi David
Steinberg replaces Cheryl Cook
as director of Hillel. Steinberg
has an undergraduate degree in
music, a law degree from
Harvard, and a Rabbinic ordination from the Reconstructionist
Rabbinical College in Philadelphia. He has traveled and studied in Israel, practiced corporate
law, played in an east-coast
klezmer band, and interned at a
gay-and-lesbian synagogue in
Manhattan.
As a liaison to the college
administration, Steinberg will
manage finances on campus and
provide spiritual counsel. He is
also hopes to bring a klezmer
band to Swarthmore and educate students about Reconstructionism, a progressive movement in Judaism that began in
Philadelphia.
Rebecca Grabiner, the new
Jewish Campus Service Corps
fellow, will assist Steinberg.

Grabiner graduated from the
University of Chicago where
she studied French and Spanish
literature. Her primary objective this year is getting students
involved in Hillel and Ruach
activities, and creating a supportive environment in which
more peripherally involved students can feel comfortable participating.
The admissions office states
that 20 to 25 percent of the student body self-identifies as Jewish, so supporting the Jewish
community at Swat is a timeconsuming job. Steinberg and
Grabiner are currently making
arrangements for students to
observe the High Holidays,
planning weekly Shabbat services and organizing the Bagel
Brunches held on Sundays in
Bond.They look forward to
meeting and talking with as
many students as possible.

Visit from nine yearold prospective elicits

by Janine Gibbons
Contributing Writer
High school senior Gregory
Smith caused a stir on campus
when he visited last week, accompanied by his parents, Tom
Krattenmaker, Director of Public Relations, and a crew from
60 Minutes.
Smith, a student at Orange
Park High School in Florida, is
only nine years old and intends
to apply to Swarthmore this fall.
He attended Professor
Pieter Judson's Modern Europe
class during his visit. He said
that wished he could come back
on Wednesday to hear the conclusion of Judson's lecture.

Swarthmore's admissions

policies do not discriminate on
the basis of age, therefore it will
base its decision entirely on his

of a nine-year old college student have been mixed. Some
question his parents' motivations and his own mental and
emotional maturity. Many feel
that Smith would feel lonely at
college because he could not
acclimate himself to the community.
Yet some students, like
Kristine Moore 'Ol, say that
while college may not be the
best option for a nine-year old,
Smith could benefit from a community as small-knit and nurturing as Swarthmore.
If Smith is accepted to the
college, his parents will relocate
their home and careers to Pennsylvania so he live with them
while he attends classes. Several years ago, Smith and his
family lived in Lancaster, Pa.,
but he could not progress
through the county's public
school system at a speed wellsuited to his abilities, so the
Smiths moved to a community
where the schools challenged
him.

A small amount of the endowment is spent on a yearly
basis. The general maxim ofthe
investment committee is to
spend between 3.75% and
4.75% annually.
Thus, Swarthmore appears
to be well-situated to withstand
the Dow's latest drop. Spending
is generally designed torise with
inflation, plus an additional 1 %.
In 1997, each student

the cost of tuition, the fund allows Swarthmore to spend over
$50,000 per student each year.

how love
rekindled one
woman's life
by Carly Hammond
Contributing Writer
"The sap is rising."

In the recent world premiere of the opera "The Black Swan,"
this phrase was often used to describe both the coming of spring
and a woman's renewal.
The production, which opened in Swarthmore's Lang Performing Arts Center Sept. 11,
was supported
by a strong
foundation.
English profess or
Nathalie
Anderson
wrote the libretto based
on Thomas
Mann's novella
The
Black Swan
and Richard
Selzer's '"The
Black Swan'
Revisited."
Anderson
has written
much about
aging women,
and their conflicts with desire and age,
and was interested in writing the piece
because she

pro-

ducer Sarah Caldwell directed the drama, bringing to the task her
years of experience in the United States. Anderson said it was
fascinating to work with Caldwell and watch the production build
through rehearsals; Caldwell knew what particular stagings would
convey, which angles would fit the scene, and how to portray a
certain message.
The sets, designed by Helen Pond and Herbert Senn, were
both innovative and unobtrusive. Many of the backgrounds and
landscapes were projected onto a screen onstage from a slide projector.
At times the screen reflected the thoughts of a character, providing insight for the audience into his or her mind. This new use
of projected images for set design made set changes simple; in
one scene, an actress pretended to open the windows with a sweep
of her hand, and the screen magically showed the blinds opening
and sunlight streaming into the room.
A powerful musical score was the driving force behind this
production. Assistant Professor of Music Thomas Whitman 'B2
composed the music for "The Black Swan," his first opera. Music

The Other

World

Some of you may remember television. Probably not the
juniors or seniors, but sophomores may have a dim memory
and first-years can probably still
speak with fondness about the
mesmerizing, patronizing,
numbly satisfying tube that
unites people across America in
shared evenings of programmed
responses and, occasionally,
quality entertainment (note that
Swarthmore does not really
count as America, at least when
it comes to pop culture).
We may not have much time
to watch TV at Swat (although I
have noticed this year's frosh

guilt-ridden viewing of ER, Ally
Mcßeal, or, probably most commonly, The Simpsons (which, as
I will address in a future column,
has gone to shit in the past few
years). But it's a new year on
two of the most important calendars in my life, Swarthmore
and TV programming, which
means it's time for us to learn
what will be on the tube and
when, so we can figure out when
those guilt-ridden moments of
pure entertainment will be in
1998-99 (noting, of course, that
TV shows do come and go and
change time slots throughout the
year).
The backbone of network
television is, of course, the everinsipid and occasionally clever
sitcom. Most situation comedies

are faulty not in premise (because if you look at history,
some of the most mundane and

ridiculous premises like Seinfeld
have made for excellent shows),
but simply in execution they
aren't funny. This year promises
much of the same, but there are
a few shows with enough promise to maybe occasionally
glance at while you do a problem set. I'm most excited about
Encore, Encore (NBC, Tuesday
8:30-9:00), which brings brilliant comedic actor Nathan
Lane, who seems like a cross
between Harvey Fierstein and
Jackie Gleason, to the small
screen for the first time. He
plays an opera singer whose career has gone the way of the average Swattie's GPA after taking microeconomics, who has to

The Birdcage can attest, is simply divine at giving a heart to
characters constantly in histrionics. The show also benefits by
coming from the creators of

student rehearsals. This creates
increasing difficulties as the
number of majors grows and
students encounter scheduling
problems when having to share
the space in LPAC for both performances and rehearsals.
Professor Allen Kuharski further explained that students taking his directing workshop alone
require 40 hours of rehearsal
space each week throughout the
semester. Also, when one group
of students is using Frear Ensemble Theatre for a performance
no one else can use the space for
days. This has forced theatre students to use other spaces such as
the Hicks mural room or Parrish
370 to hold their rehearsals.
•
Now, much to the delight of
the Theatre Department, they are
looking forward to having their
own rehearsal space in Old
Tarble. Although it will not be
used for performances, the space
will be available for all theater students to use 24 hours a day for
their rehearsals or classes.
In addition to the Theatre
Department, the Art Department, currently housed in
Beardsley, will also enjoy space
in Old Tarble. Beardsley Hall

A fully renovated Old
Tarble is finally back in service.
After many years of consideration, the College decided to
renovate the condemned building and reopen it for student use.
Although Old Tarble was
the student activities' center in
its day, it will now be an academic space used by the Theatre and Art Departments.
The Theatre Department
has been in need of rehearsal
space for years. When the Theatre program began offering
majors ten years ago, they had
enough rehearsal and performance space available in
Pearson Hall to accommodate
the one or two students who
majored in Theatre.
Since 1990, however, the
number of full time faculty members in the department grew as
well as the popularity of the major. In 1991 the theatre facilities
in Pearson became insufficient to
support the growing theatre program therefore they moved to the
newly opened Lang Performing
Arts Center (LPAC).
Despite the fact that LPAC
offers good performing spaces
in the Frear Ensemble Theatre
and LPAC's main stage, it lacks
the essential space needed for

List Gallery reveals new gallery schedule
by Tannia Jauregui
Contributing Writer
"Intimate Visions" is currently showing at the List Gallery. This exhibit presents
works by professional artists
Diana Horowitz, Michael
Norton, Marjorie Portnow,
Stuart Shils, and John Smalley
and will be open until Sept. 27.
Although these five artists
use different mediums for
their works, they share the
common trait of working on a
small scale.
Director of the L'st Gallery Andrea Packard explained
that lately many artists prefer
to work on a large scale as a
means to demonstrate their
capability and ambition.
"Intimate Visions," however, shows works that portray
the artists' ambitions by focusing on depth rather than scale.
The artists try to evoke large
sensory perceptions and ideas
through small, discreet means.
The themes in List's exhibit range from urban views
to rural landscapes, to abstract
paintings. Marjorie Portnow's
works are tiny yet detailed
landscapes of the Vermont,
New York, and California
countrysides set on an oil and
Masonite medium.
•Stuart Shils also portrays
nature scenes but uses a style
described by the Tibor de
Nagy Gallery in New York as
a variety of abstract expressionism. Shils focuses on tonality to express the dynamic
quality of nature's scenes, us-

Michael Norton is the
most abstract painter in the
show, working with egg tempera on panel and presenting
works that solely focus on
tones and hues to strikingly
evoke very personal emotions
and ideas. Diana Horowitz, on
the other hand, has more representational works as she
paints mainly urbanite
cityscapes through an oil on
linen medium.
John Smalley also has representational works, though he
mainly chooses a rural setting,
and uses both graphite on paper and oil on paper for his
mediums. Smalley's works are
surprisingly intricate, filled

with tiny, delicate details of
quaint country scenes. Small
as the artists' works may be,
they all portray and evoke very
powerful ideas and emotions.
"Intimate Visions" is the
first of four professional art exhibits Andrea Packard has
scheduled for the List Gallery
this semester. In addition to the
works shown in List, there will
also be shows in McCabe Library which will focus on the
art of books.
Alongside these exhibits,
the List Gallery will be featuring "The Art of Books and Poetry" by David Bunn from Oct.

social commentary. It attacks

many of my assumptions about
the homeless, as I like many oth-

ers often equated the homeless
with unkemptness. For a homeless person, though, Walton sure
looked like she had showered recently. Johnson shed some light
on the matter, explaining Walton
uses the money she makes by
selling flowers to stay at a shelter. It costs three dollars a night,
Johnson adds, explaining
that"lt's not the closest shelter
to where she works, but it's the
one at which she feels safest."
While homelessness as a
topic has come disturbingly
close to become a cliche, any
weakness ismade up by the candor of the de facto heroine. "I
don't mess around with nobody
that's not from the heart,"
Walton proclaims, as she is seen
laughing with a homeless friend.
Johnson, an artiste with the
most enigmatic smile I've ever
seen, doesn't seem to be asking
for anything, but but it's obvious that a lot of thought went
into the film.
Johnson built a more-thanpassing relationship with
Walton before filming began.
"At first I spent some time alone
with her before I began recording and before I began filming
just to get to know her and to
get to know what her days were
like," she says. The filming itself took only three days, she
recalls, and "[Then] I suppose
I spent about a month total [editing]."
An accidental beginning led
to a film that hooked me all the
way. From stark opening credits, followed by an unsophisticated guitar track (that's unsophisticated in a good way) to its
closing, Hello, My Friend, was
nothing but a worthwhile viewing experience.

Student Council special election candidate platforms announced
Jason Caldwell

CJC

I believe the CJC plays an important role in
Swarthmore's infrastructure. It's not only a jury
of administrators, but a jury of your peers. The
elected members of the CJC have an enormous
responsibility to listen to every case that comes
before them with the utmost c.are to the person's individual situation, keeping in mind that the decisions of the committee could
have a huge effect on the person's academic career. It takes a fair,
honest, attentive, and most importantly, trustworthy person to sit
on such a committee. I believe I am that person. I believe that a
student is innocent until proven guilty, no matter how bad the
eharges brought against the student may sound. I want to actively
get involved in one of the many institutional bodies on campus
that effect students' lives. As a result of being head ofthe Minority Student Union, Orientation Committee and an Ambassador at
my high school, I've learned to relate to both students and faculty.
Because I've never held a political position at Swarthmore, I would
bring a fresh new face to the committee.

Darby Kopp
There are many factors which make me a
strong candidate for Treasurer of Student Council. First of all, I am a senior, and so I recognize
that each of the classes here are slightly different, and therefore might want student council
funds allocated to different areas. I am also an athlete, and can see
that Swarthmore's support of its athletes could be far more involved. I am also a musician-I would like to see more support
given to the various artists here at Swarthmore, and would encourage spending more to have guest artists come to our campus. Finally, I have studied abroad for a semester, which showed me that
at other colleges, there is significantly more use of student council
funds to balance student's social life with their academic life.
Swarthmore is a great college because ofthe many different types
of people here. I will be sensitive to this, and will encourage the
student council to spend its money in the numerous places that our
student body demands it.
William Williams 111
Treasurer

Joel Weber
CJC
What character traits do you possess that will make you a trustworthy member of the CJC?
Aside from having blood in my veins, and ears on my head, I
can't spew off a list of credentials for the job or proclaim my virtues over the next person. I think all that you can ask of a CJC
candidate is a desire to befair, patient, and reserve judgement until
all the facts are in. I do not think eloquence or slickness is useful
for the job, but rather honest presentation and a little iron in the
gullet. I will be fair, and I will listen. There's nothing else to say.
I hope you have a good year and that I can represent you on the
CJC. Thanks.
Amber Adamson
CJC
What character traits do you posses that will
make you a trustworthy memberof the CJC?
I, Amber Adamson, believe in my convictions no matter where they stand. I do not base
my opinions on small school rumors nor do I
sway toward public opinion. I believe in innocent before proven
guilty which illustrates my democractic stance on each issue. Therefore I believe that I should be given a chance to serve our college
community, in a fair and just manner.

The way I would go about distributing student council funds would be to first get the opinion of the student body. Since SC representatives are not the only people on campus, I feel
that it is appropriate to find out how other stuwould
like
dents
to see their money spent. I would have a survey
and
distributed
to students, this survey would ask difcomposed
ferent types of questions. However, the questions that I, as treasure, would look at is how would students like to see funds spent
and are they happy with the way funds are being spent now. It is
imperative that we find out if students are happy with the current
distribution of funds. Once this is accomplished, then I would help
come up with ways to dispense the proper funds to different clubs,
the community, social functions, and to our school.This is what
should happen with SC funds.

Ashley DeMello
Treasurer

,

Treasurer is an important position and much
time and consideration must be given in order
to properly address the question of how funds
should be allocated within student council. Luckily I have had many soul-drenching, hot days to
sweat though this question and the answer is obviously more money
to the idea of AIR-CONDITIONING. In a school which supposAaron Carlisle

to be as honest and as fair as possible at all times; this insanity and some one must make it stop!
trustworthiness is a prerequisite for the job. Personally, I pride
myself on being a reliable person. I will approach each case with
the utmost respect and consideration, and with the same serious

mittee.
Appointments Chair
Rebecca Paul
CJC

I like to think that I have an impartially favorable view of everyone, on meeting them and
afterward. I have been accused on optimism and
ignoring the bad sides, of people, but I consider
this a flaw preferable to cynicism and general
dislike of people. Because of this character trait, I see being on
the CJC as an opportunity to help people who have made mistakes, instead of as a means to punish people harshly.
As for trustworthiness, I believe that is something I cannot
judge for myself. Ido my best to help people and keep my word,
but whether I succeed is hard for me to know. No one has complained yet of my lackof trustworthiness, so I will take that as a
good sign. Thank you.

Josh Tropp
CJC
Being a good member of the College Judicial
Committee is about, no surprise, judging. Fairly.
In all cases. Regardless of whether the person
in front of you is your best friend, someone
you've never seen before, or someone that you'd
normally wish lived a million miles away, when you're sitting on
that Committee, that person is a member of the Swarthmore community—subject to the same rules and bias free judgement as anyone else. That's a hard thins to do—swallow your biases in the
interest of justice. But I can do that. Ask my friends and even
those who aren't as close-when a question of right and wrong
comes up, I give the answer straight. Sometimes that's rough, but
its the key to being just and fair and right to everyone. I can do
that-and I will when you give me the opportunity.
(

Cathryn Polinsky

Treasurer

During the next year, SC will be revising its
constitution and its processes. How would you
improve the appointments process at Swat? I'm
not sure the appointments process needs much
changing. The required letter, then interview, is
the best way to guarantee that the council members choose the
person best qualified for the job. I think the human contact (the
interview) is important in the appointing process. Though this approach might mean a lot of work, non-elected councils are too
important to receive just an impersonal letter. As appointments
chair, I would be willing to spend the extra hours a week to make
sure the non-elected committees are staffed by the best people for
the job.

David Ellis

Appointments Chair
The appointments at Swarthmore can be
improved immeasurably by providing fresh
leadership. And this does not merely mean
leadership coming from the hackneyed, elitist, corrupt power structure that has been ruling Swarthmore for too long. No, the new generation of leadership must come from outside the old institutions
that have grown comfortable in complacency. Swarthmore has
waited too long for new ideas, and too many people have been
hurt as the old leadership has idled their time away.
The appointments process has abandoned those who deserve
it the most: you, the students. When is the last time that you
heard who was going to be appointed to the newest position? If
you elect me appointments chair, I vow to involve students in all
aspects of the process.
The students of Swarthmore deserve better representation.
And I, David Ellis, with the help of the Almighty, hope to serve
my fellow Swatties.

Appointments Chair

Student Council needs to expand the Appointments Chair beyond selecting new appointees to facilitating communication between Student Council and committee appointees. From
personal experiences, I learned that many students serve their entire term without ever talking to anyone from
Student Council. Although Swarthmore College is good at including students in decisions and meetings, the student body rarely
hears about committee meetings. We clearly need to improve communication between appointees and Student Council. Meetings
need to be organized between Student Council and student representatives. Directories of student appointees should be accessible
to the student body. Archives of committee meetings and agendas
should be made available on the web. These improvements will
increase the effectiveness of student appointees so that they may
become a voice for the campus.

Selma Hassan
Appointments Chair
Even though I am a freshman and am not experienced with the

appointments process here at Swarthmore, I do have one suggestion that I would like to put forth. I realized that the election pro-

cess for an Appointments Chair starts relatively late in the Fall
Semester. Because an appointments committee is needed to assign positions in various subcommittees within the Student Council, this would mean, that the Student Council as a whole body will
not start functioning effectively until quite late into the year. Therefore, one of the things that I would like to improve is the efficiency
and timing of the electoral processes in the appointments committee itself in order to allow the Student Council to become active as
early as possible.

Emily Sigalow

Appointment Chair
Hey, they call me Emily Sigalow. I am running for the appointment's chair, which basically appoints the heads of each student council committee. Because I am a first year student, I have like ten friends. So, I can assure
you that my appointments will be impartial and
won't be based on my friendship or allegiance to another student.
I will try my hardest to appoint the best man/woman for each
committee head. And, I promise to avoid appointing interns as
committee heads based on our kinky, sexual relations.

Sersale 'O2 comments on the
last game of the tournament.
On Wednesday, Sept 16, the
team traveled to Millersville
University (PA) to partake in a
contest under the lights.
Millersville, a Division II institution, proceeded to dominate
the majority of the game from
the very beginning. "After they
scored 2 goals on us in the first
four minutes, we were mentally
defeated," Matt Kaelin 'O2 describes the attitude felt on the
field. The score was 5-0 at half
time and the Garnet returned to
the field psyched after a uplifting halftime talk. The men's
team struggled through out the
rest game but did manage to
score one goal (9-1). Frank Yeo
'Ol was attributed for the lone
goal. The Garnet finish off the
week with a 1-5 record.
The men travel to Johns

On Sept. 12, the Garnet
traveled to Walton Field home
of our friendly neighbor,
Haverford College, for the
Jimmy Mills Tournament. This
tournament consisted of four
institutions: Goucher College
(Md.) "Gophers," Haverford
College (PA) "Fords," St.
Mary's College of Maryland
"Seahawks," and Swarthmore
College "Garnet."
Swat kicked off the tournament with a contest against St.
Mary's on Saturday. They came
out with an early aggression
with the smooth soccer skills of
Scott Samels '99 and the fancy
footwork of freshman Frank
Sersale 'O2. Goalie Andrew
Kramer 'O2also had several excellent saves in this first part of
the game. At halftime, the game
was scoreless for either team but
alas! The Garnet lost to St.
Mary's 1-0 as the Seahawks
scored with less than seven minutes left in the contest.

Donna Griffin '99 scored off
Baker. Lurah Hess '99 scored
five minutes later, with help
from Finnegan and Becca Stites
'OO, and Finnegan collected her
third assist of the day with 49
seconds remaining in the half
when she aided Krista Hollis 'Ol
on her first goal of the season.
The Garnet were not yet done
with their offensive attack

though, and Baker scored the
team's fifth goal, off Griffin, in
the second half. Swat outshot
the Green Terror by a 20-1 margin. Goalie Jane Kendall 'OO,
who has not yet allowed a goal,
picked up her third shut-out.
"The Western Maryland
game was awesome. Our team
was feeling a bit sluggish at the
end of last week, but miraculously the entire team managed to be

said Christine

"The offense

It took the Garnet considerably longer to post a goal
over the Diplomats. Hess

The upcoming season for
women's soccer at Swat should not be
"slept on." The team has had six
games already, and the implications
from these seem to be positive. The
team began the season against
Immaculata and embarrassed them 70. They then whipped Alvernia 8-0.
The next two games were a disappointment as they lost to Beaver College
and Widener, 0-3, and 1-4, respectively. However, the team did not allow themselves to become discouraged, and they promptly defeated Villa
Julie 1-0, and Ursinus 1-0.
The team is looking forward to a
promising season. Some of the key
players are midfielder Sarah Jay 'Ol,
defender Amy Phillips 'OO, and attacking Amy Markey '99. Markey has already stepped up her play in clutch
situations this season by scoring a goal
against Widener and the game-winning shot against Villa Julie. Captain
Kirsten Knox '99 has also used her
talent for great long-distance shots to

keep opposing goaltenders frightened.
Along with this returning unit comes
a group of gifted freshmen, who are
already being called upon to set into
starting roles. Phillips remarked,

great soccer sense."
Molding this entire unit into a collective juggernaut is new coach Shawn
Ferris. He has much coaching experience, having instructed men's and
women's teams at various levels of
competition. His biggest contribution
to the new season is organization. He
also has introduced a new passing attack to confuse defendersand move the
ball quickly around the field. These
new drills force everyone to be able to
effectively handle the ball. This new
style is a big change from last year's
run and kick method of play.
The general goal for the season is
improvement upon last year's six victories. The've already talliedfour. Two
important goals are the play of the
freshman starters and the quick learning of the new offensive system. Everyone must adopt Coach Ferris' new
system. A change in game-plan is very
difficultfor any team to make: the duration that it takes this team to adjust
will impact their win-loss total. The
next few games should serve as a good
indicator for the team's future.
The team travels to Cabrini tomorrow for a Ipm contest, but returns to
their home-field Monday to meet Drew
