Controversial
speakers bring
views to campus
Wise and Horowitz's views have
sparked controversy in the past
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore. edu

Tim Wise and David Horowitz, two people at opposite ends of the
political spectrum, will both be bringing their controversial views to
Swarthmore in the coming weeks.
The two have actually faced off in the past, after Wise wrote an arti-

cle entitled "Gore-vey," about Senator Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, who was Vice President Al Gore's running mate in the
2000 Presidential election.

Some time after it was written, Horowitz wrote to Wise: "You're a
patronizing racist who thinks American blacks are inferior and can't
live by the same standards as everyone else. What would you think of
Jews who blamed every community and individual failing on 2,000"

years of persecution by Christians? You would probably understand
conservative arguments better if you took time to listen instead of
knee-jerk name-calling." The two exchanged correspondence on the
subject for several weeks.

"They love to promote racial diversity, but
the second you mention political diversity,
anything right of communist is deemed
inappropriate for campus policy."

Halloween incident spurs
campus debate, controversy
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@Swarthmore.edu

William Kraig 'O4 claims he was not looking to
offend anyone, or to even challenge generally
accepted notions of what is or is not offensive,
when he chose to dress up in "black-face" at the
annual Mary Lyons Halloween party on Saturday,

Oct. 26.
But many people in attendance were offended,
and Kraig's behavior has caused a controversy
that has played itself out in the form of Daily Jolt
postings and campus wide e-mails, and is the impetus for tonight's screening of "Bamboozled" at the

Black Cultural Center.
Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs Daryl
Smaw, who wrote a campus wide e-mail condemning Kraig's behavior. "In recent conversation with
the student, while it is clear that his intent was not
hateful or intended to be offensive," Smaw said, "it
has been made clear that good intentions do not
erase the negative effect of his actions."
Kraig said the idea for painting his face black
was inspired by his short-comings as a dancer. "I

figured (obviously jokingly), that if I painted my
face black, I would thus gain some super powers
that would enable me to dance," he wrote in letter
addressed to
the
"General Swarthmore
Community." In the letter, which was posted on the
Daily Jolt forum and ran over 2,000 words, Kraig

for offending people at the party but
also said he felt some had overreacted to what he
described as an innocent, spontaneous action.
"This was NOT an attempt to start racial warfare," Kraig wrote in his Daily Jolt post. "It was a
spur of the moment thing. I did not come to the
party in this make-up, or in any sort of pre-meditated fashion," Kraig wrote. "Unfortunately, I DID
piss people off. And I sincerely apologize for that
and as soon as I realized my mistake, I removed the
color from my face. But I was also disgusted that
even here people are so high-strung about certain
issues that they would take massive amounts of
offense at an action that was completed in total

innocence without inquiring first as to why the

action was perpetrated." His letter continued, "If
my little joke last night invokes such a display of
hatred towards a white man from the African
American population, how can we ever expect to
live together in peace."
Smaw also wrote that
the fact that the student did not have an understanding of the history
or offensive nature/impact that wearing blackface
would have is troubling."

Horowitz's site also asks visitors to "Help David Expose the Leftist
Plot to Control America's Young Minds," announcing a continuing
campaign for Horowitz that has brought him to campuses across the
country. His visits often include lectures that claim campuses are dominated by leftist thinking, in both students and professors alike.
Recently his lectures have focused on how the political left on college
campuses is a threat to national security.
Other recent controversies Horowitz has sparked include a debate
during spring 2001 over an advertisement he sent to campus newspapers across the country, in which he gave 10 reasons arguing against
reparations for African-Americans, entitled "Why Reparations for
and Racist Too." The ad included
Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks
arguments that Black Africans and Arabs were'the ones truly responsible for slavery in America.

Wise, who is the director of the newly-formed Association for White
Anti-Racist Education (AWARE) and considered an expert on
American racism, will speak Nov. 20. His topic will relate to Zionism,
"in order for us to think about how Jewish people everywhere are
being constantly recruited to support Israel and its policies, even
though that might be difficult for some us," said Amalle Dublon 'O4, a
member of the group Jews Against the Occupation (JATO).
JATO, along with Students Against The Occupation (SATO) and the
Swarthmore Progressive Action Coalition (SPAC) are together paying
for Wise's visit, along with funding from the President's Office.
Horowitz, an author and self-described "lifelong civil rights
activist" will come to campus two weeks later, on Dec. 3. A biography
available at his Web site (www.frontpagemag.com) says he "is an outspoken opponent of censorship and racial preferences, and a defender
of the rights of minorities and other groups under attack
including
the rights of blacks, gays, women, Jews, Muslims, Christians and white

males."

"One of my missions in visiting campuses is to show conservative
students that they need to fight back and not just take the abuse that is
daily heaped on them," he wrote in a recent entry in his Web blog, after
visiting the University of lUinois, Chicago. "The university is a hostile

Senior charged with DUI after crashing into five other vehicles
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Steven Ciraolo 'O3 was arrested and charged last Friday
with driving under the influence (DUI) after losing control
of his car and damaging five other vehicles.
No one was physically injured in the accident, which
occurred at around 4:20 am.
Ciraolo said he had been "hanging out with a few
friends" for the evening and then decided to move his car
from Wharton to the C lot. He was traveling south on
Fieldhouse Lane when he lost control of his car. The vehicle hit the guardrail, crossed the road and slammed into
five other vehicles parked in the student parking lot located by the South Entrance of the college.
Although his car was "totaled," Ciraolo was not hurt
and quickly called police to report the accident.
Ciarlo immediately called Public Safety and told them
he had been in accident. Public Safety then notified the
Swarthmore Police Department in accordance with their
policy involving auto incidents on campus.
When Swarthmore Police officers arrived on the scene,
Ciraolo was arrested and charged with DUI after failing a
breathalyzer test, with a blood alcohol content over .2,
twice the legal limit. "He had failed several field sobriety
tests," said Brian Craig, chief of the Swarthmore Police
department. "We're still waiting the blood test results from

Student letters weigh heavily in tenure decisions
Offering the only perspective of a professor's teaching, recommendations reviewed closely
BY AVIVA

ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu

The tenure review process is strictly confidential; students usually come in contact with the process only when

they receive requests for letters assessing candidates'
teaching. These letters, which are due to departments in
the next few weeks, are students' one chance to affect what
English department chair Charles James calls "perhaps
the most important decisions made by the college."
Tenure guarantees a professor a permanent position at
a college or university. It was designed to protect students'
academic freedom. Professors who receive tenure remain
at Swarthmore unless they choose to leave.
Five department chairs and three current or former

members of the Committee on Promotion and Tenure
(CPT) all agreed that student letters play a central role in
the tenure review process. "I've been here twenty-seven
years, and I've seen tenure decisions that went negative
pretty much on the basis of student letters," said biology
professor and CPT member Mark Jacobs.
All faculty members said that teaching was weighted
equally, if not more, with scholarship in tenure decisions—and that student letters were the primary means of
assessing teaching.
"In most departments, faculty members do not sit in on
one another's classes," said psychology professor and two-

probably the most effective way we have of assessing
teaching."
CPT members read letters looking for themes. "The
committee is trying to put together a personality," physics
department chair Amy Bug said. "Ultimately, it's got to be
a process of consensus. You take the letters as a body and
try to read a student consensus."
All faculty members interviewed stressed that most of
the time, a clear picture does emerge. When a letter
appears that does not fit that picture, it receives substantial consideration. "You worry terribly when you find one
letter that violates the picture," Bug said. "A lot of effort
goes into understanding that letter. There's lots of discussion. You go back to other sources. [The CPT] will go to
the department members and say, 'Why might someone
have the impression that this person is like this?'"
...

is from students."

While CPT members can look at course syllabi, and
some departments examine other, additional information
(the education department, for instance, looks at student
course evaluations), student letters are key. Even in the
biology department, where introductory courses are teamtaught and professors sit in on their colleagues' lectures,
department chair John Jenkins said, "Student input is

tenure," he said.
All faculty members said such situations were surprisingly uncommon. "You'd be surprised how rarely that situation arises," Kemler-Nelson said.
"We hope we never get in that situation," Bug said. "It
would be terrible in our department because you have to
teach at all levels. We don't have work for you for thirty
years just teaching one kind of student."
James felt slightly differently. "If someone has some
specialization that we really require, then we might just
say that this person should not teach intro courses," he

In other words, the CPT does not question the writers of

emphasized willingness to mentor individual students and

"It varies a little from division to division and department to department," Jacobs said. "I have the impression
that managing the class discussion is [more important] in
the humanities and social sciences. For a person in natural science it might be more negative to have unclear or
disorganized lectures."
Most faculty members interviewed said they would be
very worried by a candidate who received highly positive
reviews from upper-level students but largely negative
feedback from students in introductory level courses.
Jenkins recalled that, a few years ago, a candidate for

On Election Day, student accused of intimidating voters

Election inspector goes to court over posting a sign near the polls discouraging voting twice
the phrase: "Students, please vote, just don't vote twice."

BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompettl@swarthmore.edu
While performing his duties as the only Republican
the Borough of Swarthmore's
Northern Precinct on Tuesday, Matt Rubin 'O3 found himself in a brief legal skirmish with Democratic Party officials over methods of preventing voter fraud.
Swarthmore students can choose to register in their
hometowns or here in the Borough of Swarthmore.
Because there is no nationwide database for voter registration, it is possible for people to violate the law by voting
twice.
In the case of college students here, the concern is that
they may be voting both by absentee ballot in their hometown and by going to the polls in Swarthmore. The role of
election officials is to supervise the vote and to attempt to
prevent such fraud from occurring.
"There are hundreds of people registered at 500 College
Ave., many of them no longer living there," Rubin said. He
added that "there's a legitimate concern" about people
being registered in more than one place.
One step taken to prevent this was a sign posted at the
Northern Precinct polls "instructing college students of
the penalties for voting both by absentee voting and in
Swarthmore," Rubin said. He noted that the sign included
overseeing voting in

Rubin said that "a bunch of Democratic Party officials
came to the Northern Precinct and demanded that the sign
be torn down" on the basis that it intimidated voters.
"The judge of elections agreed with this and when I
tried to raise concerns about the judiciousness or legality
of her decision I was promptly shut down," Rubin said.
He believed the sign was "instructing them what the

"There are hundreds of people registered at 500 College Avenue, many
of them no longer living there."
Matt Rubin 'O3

Rubin said he believed that his role as an election official was threatened during the dispute. Rubin said
Democratic precinct officials told him "that if I were to
challenge Swarthmore students that they could be voting
in two places, that that was discriminatory practice, and I
would see them in court."
"I was offended on a legal and moral level," Rubin said
of the Democratic officials' threat. He saw their actions as
a request for him to ignore his duty as a fellow official.
Rubin explained that in order to ensure that those voting were doing so legally he was asking students "a series
of questions that were factual and from that making a decision. I didn't end up challenging any students, but I did
leave this possibility open."
If anything, Rubin said, he wants to encourage all students to vote and is concerned that so few do.

Claudia Sell 'O3 attested that "Matt did not growl at
people or warn them that they'd be thrown in jail or
something
all he did for each person was ask, 'Are you
registered anywhere else in the U.S. besides here?'
Unless I missed something, the intimidation thing is

problem was, not inhibiting them. I don't find that intimidating; it's only intimidating to people voting twice."
Based on this belief, Rubin "informed a lawyer and we
went to the Delaware County Courthouse. We worked out

bullshit."

The court eventually decided that Rubin did in fact
have the right to question students in a nondiscriminatory manner about their voting status.

People should not be committing voter fraud, and Matt was
there because students have done it in the past, and it
shouldn'tbe happening."

a solution that allowed an altered form of the notice."

Sell said she believed the situation was "ridiculous.

speakers, the speakers are attacked
and treated with no respect."
Randy Goldstein 'O5, a member of
the College Republicans, said
Horowitz's $5,000 fee was paid for in
part by
the Young America
Foundation, a group not affiliated
with the college that helps sponsor
conservative speakers on American
campuses. The foundation contributed $1,500, the Forum for Free
Speech (FFS) gave $l,OOO and the
President's Office, through the
Charles Boone Houston Fund, provided the remaining $2,500. That fund is
reserved for bringing specifically
conservative speakers to campus.
Goldstein,
who described
Horowitz as one of the most popular speakers on the college circuit
today, said his group's goal in
bringing Horowitz was to promote
an ideological diversity on campus
he feels is lacking. He anticipated
many students would come to the
....

lecture with preconceptions about

Horowitz, due to his high profile as
a conservative, and that they
would most likely disagree with
what he says.
"[Swarthmore students] love to
promote racial diversity, but the
second you mention political diver-

sity, anything right of communist
is deemed inappropriate for campus policy," he said. "They want
diversity in that everyone they

know has a different color skin,
but they don't want diversity when
everyone they know has a different
political ideology."

Horowitz becomes involved in

controversy at the campuses he
visits, and a recent trip on Tuesday
to the University of Illinois,
Chicago was no exception.
According to The Chicago
Flame, that campus newspaper,
parts of Horowitz's speech given
there included a call for more con-

servative professors on college
campuses, as well as "statements
about life choices and the failures
he sees in welfare programs." As

he did, "the noise level began to
increase as many in the audience
became angry at his answers."
Goldstein said he hoped
Swarthmore would offer a more
polite response to Horowitz's speech.
"This is Swarthmore, so I'm
sure some people will come in with
closed minds," he said. "But I tend
to expect that the majority of the
Swarthmore community is open to
the diversity of politics, and,
frankly, people have come up to me
and told me how excited they are to
see David Horowitz, people I know
are liberals but are still excited to
hear his message. They've heard
his lectures are great." Goldstein
also pointed out that Horowitz's
lectures are known for being thoroughly researched, as well as tailored specifically to the campus at
which he is speaking.
While it was relatively easy for
College
Goldstein and
the
Republicans to bring Horowitz to
campus. JATO, SATO and SPAC's

efforts to bring Wise ran into more
difficulty, largely due to efforts
from Im Tirtzu, students for a twostate solution, a Zionist student
group.

For

Vice

President

of

Community and College Relations
Maurice Eldridge '6l, who handles
all requests to the President's
Office to receive funding for
events, the two speakers represent
some of the main difficulties with
the administration's process for
students to request and receive
funds for outside speakers.
Eldridge said he was especially

troubled over the need for some
groups, as JATO, SATO and SPAC
to go to several different departments for funding, what he calls a
exercise,
"nickel-and-dime-ing"
which can waste both the students'

and departments' time.
Dublon said JATO hoped Wise's

coming to campus would inform

found his views offensive, and that

students about what American
Jews can do about making a
socially conscious investment in
Israel. She made a point of saying that her view only represented herself as a Jew. JATO's goal,
to promote dialogue on issues

presenting him as an expert on the
Middle East was misleading.
"Tim Wise is not an expert on

pertinent to the Jewish community, might be different from

those of SATO or SPAC.
"We need to say there is a
Jewish voice against occupation,

that there is a Jewish voice
against human rights abuses,"
she said. "We need to say that
this is our state."
The effort to receive funding
for Wise's visit was a complicated one for JATO, SATO and
SPAC, and one that brought them
into some disagreement with Im
Tirtzu.
When JATO, SATO and SPAC
attempted to receive funding
from the religion, history and
political science department to
get Wise on campus, Im Tirtzu
also sent letters to those departments, asking them not to spon-

sor Wise. Such sponsorship,
according to Dina Aronzon 'O5,
an Im Tirztu member, would
have lent Wise a credibility she
did not feel he deserves.
Carol Nackenoff, political science department chair, said she
did not take into account Im
Tirtzu's letter in her decision,
though political science did deny
the request for funds. According
to Nackenoff, the decision was
based entirely on her department's limited budget to fund
speakers and that what Wise will
speak on is not directly related to
any courses taught currently by
the department.
Robert
History
chair
Duplessis said his department's
decision to deny funding was
likewise based on limited funds.
'I don't even remember how
small ours is because I'm embarrassed by it," he said, referring to
history's budget for funding
speakers. Duplessis also said the

department felt Wise did not

ggggtCT

Graduate School oi Education

have sufficient credentials as a
historian to justify funding him.

After being turned down by

EDUCATION IS MUCH
MORE THAN TEACHING

the departments, the three
groups trying to bring Wise to
campus turned to the President's
Office, specifically to Eldridge.
Im Tirtzu, Aronzon said, decided hot to write a letter to Eldridge
this time because it does not contest Wise's coming to campus.
"It's a common misconception
that we wanted to stop Tim Wise
from coming here," she said.
"That's not true."
She did say, however, that she

the Middle East," she said. "He's
an expert on racism, and we'd be
fine if he spoke on race."
Most offensive, she added,
was his opposition to Israel as a
Jewish state. His opposition to
the occupation of Palestinian termost
ritories wasn't the issue
of Im Tirtzu, she said, is anti-

occupation.
"I find him inflammatory
because he's not going to foster
dialogue on this campus," she

said. "What he says is hurtful."
Wise has been an activist for
social justice for the past two
decades, and has spoken to more
than 75,000 people in 46 states, on
more than 275 college campuses,
and to hundreds of community
groups. He has also trained journalists on how to eliminate

JATO's goal, and Im Tirztu's
goal as well, according to Dublon,
is to foster dialogue. "My goal is
always more dialogue rather

than less," as well as more view-

points, she added. "Even if their
letter writing campaign wasn't
explicitly intended to keep Tim
Wise from coming to campus at
the point they did it, it could've

had that effect." That would have
been detrimental to both groups.
"More voices, more Jewish voices, are what everyone wants."
Responding to concerns that
both Horowitz and Wise could
prove offensive to some campus
groups, Eldridge said, "I'm not
given to censorship, in my institutional response or my personal

one. I've certainly provided
funds to groups bringing people
whose views don't match mine.
...I almost never say no unless I
feel people are asking for excessive amounts of money."

"We need to say there is a Jewish voice
against occupation, that there is a Jewish
voice against human rights abuses. "We
need to say that this is our state."

in

Petersburg, Florida.
According to Dublon, JATO,
SATO and Space chose Wise
"rather than another speaker
because he's an American Jew,
because he has training, fostering dialogue." She added that he
has extensive work in the
American South, trying to get
people to talk about issues dealing with race relations.
"He's trained to foster dialogue. He's trained to work in
...

these communities

...

and we

hope he'll speak to a large Jewish
community here that often doesn't get spoken to, and to the community in general," Dublon said.
She also cited the disagreement
between JATO and Im Tirtzu as

another reason Wise should come
to speak at Swarthmore.
"I think that one of the things
we need to do, the Jewish community as a whole needs to do, in
order to foster dialogue and in
order to sort of grow as a community, is to be willing to engage
each other respectfully on issues
that are very high stakes for
everyone," she said. "That's
something I hope Tim Wise will
spark

here."

Multicultural Dean Darryl
Smaw held a similar view. "I think
any speaker, whether controver-

sial or not, can always contribute
to the intellectual rigor and critical thinking of our campus community," he said. "Such individuals help us question our position
on an issue, and that's good."
He admitted the risk that a

speaker might take advantage of
the campus' generally open
atmosphere, and twist facts. "But

I also believe that our students
are able to discern when they are
getting factual information from
when they're not."
Eldridge also expressed hesitation that a speaker might offer an
oft-repeated, or "canned" speech,
expressing a desire for speakers
who won't give "the same speech
they gave up the street and across
the country and on six other camwhere's the intellectual
puses
excitement in that?"
Eldridge admitted that in the
case of Horowitz, though he
granted funding, "I said
'This
guy gives canned speeches.'"
He felt the campus should
withstand any speech not in line
with an open atmosphere for dialogue. "We have to keep our discourse civil and agreeable.," he

Joan Breton Connelly attempted what has eluded historians for years: interpreting the meaning

behind the Parthenon's frieze, a 525-foot, sculptured band on the temple's central chamber.

Lecturer dissects meanings
behind Parthenon's frieze
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu
"It is understandable why, in the absence of a

myth recognizable to us, we have chosen to inter-

pret the [Parthenon] frieze in terms of what we
know best," Joan Breton Connelly said to 100 students, faculty and staff on Monday afternoon.
An associate professor of fine arts at the
Institute of Fine Arts of New York University
(NYU), Connelly gave her lecture "Beyond the
Icon: The Parthenon and Its Sculptured Frieze" in
the LPAC cinema.
Connelly shared her interpretation of the
Parthenon frieze, a 525-foot, sculptured horizontal
band located on the outside of the central cham-

ber of the temple.

No historian has been able to match all of the
characters shown in the frieze to a particular
myth, leading to controversy over what the frieze
represents. Many experts have claimed it depicts
a victory during the time of Pericles or that it is a
recreation of a scene from the Panatheneic procession (in which Athena received a new peplos, a
kind of tunic worn by Athenian women).
Connelly agreed with the latter interpretation
but added that the frieze represents a human sacrifice during the Panathaneic procession, particularly Erechtheus' sacrifice of his youngest daugh-

ter. Erechtheus, an Athenian king, followed the
advice of an oracle to perform this sacrifice to win
a battle and save Athens. Connelly supported her

claim that the frieze depicts this act by referring
to historical, cultural and gender studies.
Members of the audience had diverse opinions
concerning Connelly's lecture. "I felt very persuaded," Janine Mileaf, an art history professor,
said. "She used a lot of visual and textual sup-

porting evidence for such a radical interpreta-

November 7, 2002

tion."
"I thought the lecture was scholarly, ground-

breaking and witty," art history Professor
Patricia Reilly said. "She is reconsidering a fundamental icon of democracy, as well as modeling
true scholarly research and analysis."
Joanie Lipson 'O5 also expressed some positive
aspects of Connelly's lecture. "I thought it was
neat the way she drew on the cultural context of
the art to understand its meaning and then used
that meaning to reevaluate other aspects of that
cultural context," she said. "I was definitely
struck by and intrigued by the role of gender and
culture as frameworks for re-evaluating a piece of
art for which so much scholarship has been
done."

Other members of the audience, however,
responded to Connelly's talk less positively.
Lipson also expressed disappointment by saying
that "it was interesting material, but not a very
engaging talk to listen to." Concerning the appropriateness of the lecture for the general college
community, she said, "I feel like it served that
purpose to some degree, but that it could have
served that purpose better."

Other students also found the information in
the talk difficult to comprehend. "It didn't really
gear toward undergraduate, 'non-art history' students," Pari Deshpande 'O4 said. She then added,
"There was almost nothing from the opposite

side."

Connelly's talk was this year's Benjamin West
Memorial Lecture in Art History, an annual lecture funded by gifts from the Class of 1905 and
other donors. Students enrolled in Critical Study
in the Visual Arts (Art History 1), Greece and the
Barbarians (Classics 31), and The Art and
Architecture of Ancient Greece and Rome (Art
History 13) were required to attend.

A woman taught by Mother Theresa, a center caring for women
BY PREETY SIDHU

ssidhul@Swarthmore.edu

Almost nine years ago, a destitute young woman
walked into the Ankur Kala Centre in the heart of Kolkata
(formerly Calcutta), India. She was an orphan, pregnant
and abandoned by her husband. She had nowhere else to
go, and so the staff at the centre took turns sleeping in the
office with her. They saw her through delivery and then
helped her move to a house in the suburbs. Today she is a
supervisor at Ankur Kala, heading the department that
teaches women how to make jams, squash, and pickles.
Founded in 1982 by Annie Joseph, Ankur Kala is an organization dedicated to the economic empowerment of women from
Kolkata's slums. Joseph came to Swarthmore on Monday, and
led a dialogue and showed a video about her work.
The purpose of Ankur Kala, which means "Sowing the
Seeds of Hope," is to provide single, abandoned, destitute,
orphaned, and widowed women with self-employment
training. There are currently 150 students in the program,
which has served approximately one thousand women
over the past twenty years. They come from slums all over
the city, usually about twenty minutes away, but some do
commute nearly two hours in from the suburbs. Most are
aged 18-25, but a few are even in their 50s.
"I am really thankful that something which I started has
sown so many seeds of hope," Joseph said. "It is wonderful
to see these women blossoming, and empowered. I want
them to expand, to reach out, and to touch many more lives."
Women are selected through a process that involves an
interview, application, and home visit to make sure they are
truly needy. After this, they are given a one month trial
period to get comfortable with the program, followed by a
six month probationary period during which they are cared
for intensively and taught basic writing and other skills.
Approximately 95% of the women stay on past this period. They receive a monthly stipend of Rs. 800 (roughly $l6

US), to cover the expenses of attending the program, in addition to covering educational and medical expenses for their
children, and any other emergency needs. Ankur Kala also
opens and monitors a bank account for each woman, requiring she save a portion of her money every month.
The program provides training in four basic areas: tailoring, catering, batik craft, and making jams, squash and
pickles. It also ensures functional literacy and trains in
basic business management skills such as budgeting and
pricing. Certain values, such as not buying into consumerism, are imparted to the women in the hope that
they will be internalized and spread to other communities.
Discipline is deemed important, and the women are taught
to respect time and be punctual. A penalty for tardiness
applies to everyone in the program, including senior level
managers. There is an emphasis on spirituality, too. Each
morning is begun with a meditation in which Hindu, Muslim,
and Christian women all come together and recite prayers for
blessing and protection they have composed themselves.
Formal training usually lasts two years, though the program is committed to working with a woman until she is
able to stand on her feet. Some students are encouraged to
continue on for two more years of senior level training and
join the management of Ankur Kala. There are approximately a dozen top-level managers at the centre, all women
except for two male accountants. "We want women to do the
home visits, handle crises, and reach out," Joseph explained.
Program workers stay in touch with about 90 percent of
Ankur Kala graduates, following the training up with
home visits once a month. Twice a month an open house is
held during which the women can return to have tea, talk,
sing, dance, and pray together. Housing expenses make it
difficult for many of the women to move out of the slums,
but some do move out eventually, and all are at least economically empowered enough to support themselves.
Joseph, a Catholic who was born and raised in Kolkata,
was deeply influenced by the work of Mother Theresa. As a

young girl, Joseph went to her chapel and watched her pray.
She was touched by Mother Theresa's astounding simplicity
and conin Ghandian fashion she only owned two saris
stant sensitivity for the poor. Joseph completed her basic
schooling at the Irish Queen of Our Lady and of the Missions
convent, and then went on to get a degree in English
Literature from the secular Rani Birla College in Kolkata.
She stayed in the city and did a year of work toward a
masters in English Lit at Jadavpur University before
being invited to the Taize Community in France, where
she was also deeply influenced by Brother Roger Taize.

Joseph then switched to a major in Social Sciences at the

Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai (formerly
Bombay), India. After a year of volunteer work, at the age
of 25, she started Ankor Kala with Mother's Theresa's
blessings and support. The first school was even located in
Mother Theresa's compound. For the first few years,
Joseph struggled without a salary. While some relatives

believed that she was wasting her university education by
not earning a salary, her close family supported her, especially her father who was a wealthy businessman.
Joseph's current six-week tour of Canada and United
States, the first time she has been to the latter country, was
sponsored entirely by the Mennonite Church. She has
already visited New York City and plans to travel around
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Texas, and Arizona.
The trip's purpose is to fund raise and collect market surveys, as well as to form associations with like-minded people,
and talk to exporters. Joseph wants to build a stronger financial base for her organization, so its actions will not be subject to the whims of donors. In the future she hopes to add to
the one training building that they currently have a production unit or workshop, and a showroom in which to sell goods
produced by their women and by similar groups that work in
Kolkata and the villages of Bengal.

Low student response rates, though,

department to well under 50% in physics

Grinstead hypothesized that his
department's low rate of return might
have to do with the high percentage of its
students who take only introductory
courses. "The level of loyalty to the

According to Kemler-Nelson, the rate

James said. "But in the case of a tenure

When the rate of return is especially

low, department chairs send students

said that, in his experience, there are no

trend towards more negative letters [in

But Kemler-Nelson said CTP members
still worry when return rates are low. And

several students interviewed said that

they were less inclined to write letters for
professors they viewed as poor teachers,
especially if they liked the professors as
individuals.

"No one letter is going to torpedo somebody's case," Provost Connie Hungerford said.
"We would much prefer that [students]

THE PEN IS MIGHTIER

Shakir said that "the students who
have been organizing to call for an
administrative response to the events
that Darryl Smaw mentioned in his letter
are reacting to more than what took place
at the Halloween party. On my part, I was
also upset by the apology that was written and by student responses to the
events and to the apology. After speaking
with people about these events and about
reactions to these events it seemed clear
that despite our liberal leanings and our
proclamations of appreciating diversity,
most of us on this campus have a lot to
learn about race relations and about how
we can effectively create a multicultural
community."
In an e-mail to the Phoenix, Kraig said
that the letter he posted on the Daily Jolt
was "written soon after the incident at
the Halloween Party and reflects, through
my feelings at the time, the many emotions that can be brought to the surface
by an incident such as this. While the letter contained more than just an apology,
the apology contained within that letter

was indeed sincere. At the time that was
written, however, I did not fully understand the depth of the issue, or the extent
of the offense I had caused. I still do not
entirely understand the issues at heart,
but I now know that they are far greater
than I could have imagined."

A death is faked, sex is taped and gun owners go sour
Boston U. alum fakes his own death
to avoid paying back loans
(U-WIRE) BOSTON
After attempting to fake his own death to
avoid repaying student loans, Boston University graduate David
Michael Venezia recently settled a civil court case of student loan
fraud for $55,000, according to court documents from the U.S.
Attorney's office. He is also alleged to have kept money he received
for education.
Venezia was found making a "materially false fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation to the United States government" when authorities noticed he was not paying his student
loans, and after investigators found he had pocketed another
$17,000 in Army funding.
Prosecutors said Venezia had fraudulently taken $32,91198
from the government.
Venezia told the Army he was not receiving funds from any other
organization, when in fact he received two education grants from BU
totaling $13,000, according to court documents. Venezia was
already aware of the merit scholarships, and was receiving the
Army's grants when he should not have been, prosecutors alleged.
Venezia had received a "refund" check for $17,031 from BU,
because the loans and grants he received covered more than his
education costs. Prosecutors said he then proceeded to deposit the
"refund" into his account without notifying the Army.
Venezia also attended Brandeis University, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Northeastern University between 1982
and 1989. He received $23,000 in student loans from the former
Boston Five Cents Savings Bank.
At the time of his arrest Venezia was suspected of owning a
condo worth almost $lOO,OOO in Charlestown, a 1989 Cadillac
Allante, and a 26-foot Bayliner boat.

Texas A&M student charged with taping
sex without consent
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE STATION, Texas
Texas A&M University student.Brennan Jasper Bice was arrested Oct. 31 after he admitted to
videotaping intercourse with a female student without her knowledge and then showing the tape to fraternity members.
Bice, 21 a junior information and operations management major
and member of Lambda Chi Alpha, told police that he videotaped himself and a sorority member having consensual sex at his home last
month, said Lt. Rodney Sigler of the College Station Police Department.
"The woman was completely unaware they were being videotaped at the time," Sigler said.
Court papers show that up to 15 people saw the videotape on different occasions at the fraternity house, which is located at 1400 Athens Dr.
Bice told College Station police that he showed the videotape to
his fraternity brothers as a way to brag about the encounter.
Incidents similar to this one, involving secretly videotaping others,
were not illegal until this year, Sigler said. In several cases, people
installed cameras while tenants were gone and then videotaped them.
"What those people did wasn't burglary or trespassing, so the
Legislature had to pass a new law making this type of activity illegal," Sigler said.
Bice could not be reached for comment.

Harvard University study.
Recently published in the Journal of American College
of Health, the study, titled, "Guns and Gun Threats at
College," shows an association of firearm owners to risky
behaviors, but does not list the cause for the action.
Lead author Matthew Miller and co-authors David
Hemenway and Henry Wechsler compiled the selfresponse surveys of 10,000 students from 119 public and private colleges across the country.
Researches reported that 4.3 percent of college
students own a firearm half of whom say they carry
the gun for protection.
Only 11 percent of females own firearms compared to 8.8 percent of males, and 5.3 percent of
whites carry guns compared to 16 percent of blacks,
according to the study.
Student gun owners are more likely to put others
and themselves in harm's way by binge drinking and
using illegal drugs. Of those who drink, 12 percent of
college gun owners admit to driving drunk compared
to 2.7 percent of their unarmed peers.

"Bowling for Columbine": A leftist blast

New Moore documentary rallies against guns, Charlton Heston and the NRA
BY ESTER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu

Michael Moore movies are only shown
where they do not need to be shown. The
people who could theoretically benefit
most from seeing them either don't get a
chance to, or just don't.
It's a sad paradox of American life, one
that Moore himself uses to great comic
effect in his
if ultimately depressing
humorous and sobering documentaries

about American social ills.
"Bowling for Columbine," Moore's latest, draws on many of the techniques he
has made famous over the years. He interviews folks in video arcades and folks in
the Michigan Militia
everyone from
John "Terry's Brother" Nichols to Matt
"South Park" Stone, from Marilyn
"Actually Articulate" Manson to Charlton
"From My Cold Dead Hands" Heston.
Disarmed by Moore's unassuming manner, people respond with a surprising and

enlightening frankness about the subject at
hand: in this case, guns and the staggering

themselves.
What prompted them to do this?
America's long history of swatting foreign policy flies with a chainsaw? The
huge Lockheed Martin weapons facilities
in town? The NRA? The KKK? Or, as parents feared, heavy metal?
The aftermath of Columbine turned
everyone into a pundit. While Moore's
opinions aren't necessarily more valid
than anyone else's, he at least had the
good taste to turn his views into an
engrossing, if biased, film.
Moore, who wrote as well as produced
and directed, handles the material so
skillfully that the first hour or so flies by.
He intersperses images of horror with
acerbic clips from "South Park" and
Chris Rock sound bites. He visits Canada
to contrast cultures. Fear, he decides at
last, is to blame: the
fathomless fear of the American people, cultivated primarily by network TV.
Once he establishes that this is his big
ol' axe to grind, however, the movie
becomes less focused and more preachy.
He takes the camera back to Flint,

Moore splits his time between interviewing residents and attempting to track
down Mr. Smith. Though his attempts are
sometimes funny, more often they come

tion of "Roger and Me." His first and most

notorious film, "Roger and Me" details
the descent of Flint into abject poverty
when Roger Smith, CEO of General
Motors, decides to close the plants that

off as contrived and pointless.
In the same way, this section of
"Columbine," followed by Moore's parallel attempt to converse with Moses himself, Charlton Heston, does not move the
story forward. The graying, slow-moving
Heston is such an easy target that
Moore's badgering of him perversely
arouses sympathy for the fool.
In another late sequence, Moore presents his successful efforts to coerce K-

Mart to faze out their sale of handgun
ammunition. Two survivors from
Columbine, both permanently scarred
from 99-cent K-Mart bullets, plead for the
change in policy. After attracting media
attention, K-Mart agrees to a change in
policy. This is certainly a victory and
more constructive than anything Heston
could have done. But in light of how
entrenched gun love is in the United
States,
according to Moore's own
research, the victory pales.
Despite the unevenness of the second
half, "Columbine" remains a worthwhile
message movie. Considering how important the subject matter is, it's possible to
ignore Moore's occasional sanctimony.

Long live El Vez! Mexican Elvis claims the throne
BY KATE DUFFY
kduffyl@swarthmore.edu

One billion, seven hundred fifty million jump-suited
crooners may roam the globe within a decade. According
to USA Today, the Elvis impersonation industry will
employ 25 percent of the world's population by 2012, provided the rate of Elvis impersonators increases as it has
since the original's 1977 death.
In America, unruly pelvises already exist in overabundance. "Making it big" for an Elvis impersonator means
performing a few Las Vegas wedding ceremonies or landing regular lounge gigs. An Andy Kaufman or two rise to
the very top; otherwise, few dream of expressing novel
ideas through their art.
In that respect, El Vez, "The Mexican Elvis," doesn't rank
among the teeming millions. A search for cultural identity
combined with a love ofElvis and a knack for song led to the
debut of his part-homage, part-politics persona in 1988.
Today El Vez tours with his own band and the El Vette
backup singers: Priscilita, Gladysita, Lisa Maria, and Que
Linda Thompson. Behind the sequins and lame, ethnic
commentary lurks: "Viva Las Vegas" becomes "Viva la
Raza" and "Suspicious Minds" is "Immigration Time." Fan
club members receive official El Vez green cards.
Offstage, El Vez is Robert Lopez, 42, a MexicanAmerican anti-gang activist originally from Chula Vista,
California. In 1977, he sang and played guitar for the Zeros,
the L.A. punk band that gave the Germs their first show as
an opening act. He was recently ordained as a minister and
presided over longtime friend and X vocalist Exene
Cervenka's wedding. Kid in the Hall Dave Foley's upcoming TV special features El Vez performing with surf legend
Dick Dale.
Why did El Vez choose to emulate Elvis?
"When I was a kid in the '6os, I had uncles with continental slacks and slight pompadours in that Elvis style,"
he told an interviewer in 1994. "I thought Elvis looked like
my uncles. He lookedLatin. The first movie I ever saw him
in was 'Fun in Acapulco.' I found out later that wasn't even

THE PHOENIX

filmed in Mexico, but on a sound stage."
Due to touring complications, El Vez could not schedule
a phone interview; he answered the following questions
through e-mail.
Kate Duffy: What's the biggest compliment you've

ever received for your performances?
El Vez: To [be able to] make a living out of being just El
Vez for 15 years.

What would you say to those who would dismiss El
Vez as a kitschy joke?
Sure it is. But it's a millions things else also.
What are your live performances like?
Socio-political Vegas cabaret with seven costume
changes, background singers and a rocking band. If Cesar
Chavez had a punk band. If Liberace taught Chicano studies.
What advice would you give to other Elvis impersonators hoping to make it big?
Find another job. I've been very lucky but I do something very different.

Where do you think all the Elvis impersonators
come from?
All over the world, of course. Illinois has the most per
capita. Really.

What's your favorite Elvis costume to wear and why?

UNRAVELLING A CAMPUS ENIGMA
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE
sbeveril@swarthmore.edu
Prior to - this week I had only seen
Crumhenge a couple of times, let alone
ruminated on it, but this enigma in miniature began to make me wonder. First, I
asked students about Crumhenge to gauge
campus knowledge. A typical conversation
went as follows:
Me: Hey, what do you know about the
Crumhenge?

Student: Uh...
Me: You know, those rocks down in the

Crum Meadow?
Student 1: Oh, yeah, I saw them during
that orientation trust walk thing, but not
since then. Wow, that was four years ago.
I'm getting old; I need a job next year...
Me: Yeah, thanks for your help. Gotta go.
Most of the faculty and staff members
that I spoke with were friendly but did not

have much more information than the students did. They happily referred me to
other people who might know more, but
these individuals oftenreferred me back to
the original interviewees.

The firsthand experience
After my hard-hitting interviews, I realized that the origin and significance of
Crumhenge is not common knowledge to
the Swarthmore community. Even the
Friends Historical Library had little information on these exceptional rocks. Armed
with a pen, paper and my cell phone (in
case I got lost), I headed down to the meadows for a little inspiration.
As I passed through two graffiti-covered
pillars, I saw the stones, leaning in as
many directions as the overgrown grass
grew. Twenty or so stones of varying
heights stood around an old campfire. I
walked past squatty rocks and came noseto-nose with rectangular posts nearly as
tall as I am (and I'm pretty tall). I was neither awe-inspired nor scared, but a little
intrigued. After soaking up the ambiance
and checking my phone, I strolled back to
campus.

The history
According to Arboretum Horticulture
Jeff Jabco, Crumhenge
appeared in the late 1980s, around the time

Although it is assumed that Crumhenge was built by the Arboretum workers and a former member of the facilities staff, some people think that either aliens or a race of "cow people" are responsible for the strange stone formation found in the Crum.

even drove down there "with the convertible open—in the winter!"

Professor Art McGarity commented, "I
don't ever remember it not being here."

Former Arboretum Director Steve
Wheaton is the structure's creator.
Hopkins explained, "He thought it'd be a
neat idea." Wheaton was elusive in my
attempts to contact him. So as with the
mystery of Stonehenge, the origin of
Crumhenge may never fully be known.

For the Engineering professor and
Crum Creek Watershed expert, Crumhenge
is a quiet part of the landscape. He added
that Hurricane Floyd flooded the rock formation a few years ago.

buildings, the formation is made of local

Create your own meaning

Crumhenge is just one of those
Swarthmore things—a little quirky, and as
meaningful as you want it to be. For many
students, it is little more than an orientation pit stop. To Kellam Conover 'O3, it is

evenings with friends, while to Natalie
Briones 'O3 it looks like a cemetery. In a
Phoenix article, Joel Blecher 'O4 even heralds it as a great study spot.

The mystery lives on
With the romance of the Crum comes
the mystery of Crumhenge. An October 3,
1986, Phoenix article about the meadow
details the myth of "Cow People"—" blind,
albino, nocturnal beasts with amazing
senses of smell and hearing" that have
people heads and cow bodies. According to
one sophomore source, these cultish creatures enslaved the facilities staff and
forced them to assemble the stones.
Students continue to speculate on
Crumhenge and were curious about what I
might discover. One unnamed senior spoke
of a myth about "some dude getting killed
down there." A shy freshman suggested
that aliens may be trying to communicate
with us through elaborate rock and grass
patterns.
Similar to theories about Stonehenge,
the stones may have had sacrificial or

astronomical uses.

Even at its most mythical, Crumhenge

Hopkins receives occasional phone calls

She recommends that they not visit unless
they are in the area.
The campus stones of Crumhenge punctuate the Crum Meadow without overwhelming the scenery. Blending nature
with the remnants of building construction, the rocks offer an adventure or hideaway for some and a source of speculation
for all.

Dreams of a Swat
free from stress
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollinsl@swarthmore.edu

Poetic Lust

"Do you ever feel just... just... claustrophobic?" she said. In a stupor, I nodded.
A Danawell resident sat with us and told me I had no right to feel

claustrophobic as a Wharton resident.
"Try living in riot-proof halls for a while," she said.
Anyway, we knew exactly what she was talking about: "the bubble,"
"the time warp," "the anti-Prozac," "the terrordome." (Cue "Jaws"
theme)... SWARTHMORE!!!!
Thus I began my interview with Mari Clements, Swarthmore's own
holistic therapist, nutritionist and director of last week's stress management workshop. Out of breath and pressed for time, I flopped
myself in front of her at Sharpies.
"Go get something to eat," she said reassuringly. "Elizabeth, I have
all the time in the world." She said the words so serenely, so deliberholistically.
hmm
ately, so
I returned with my food. Thank God it was falafel bar day. I felt so
nutritional. A nutritionist like Clements would be so pleased with my
pita and hummus.
In fact, that day, I felt more like a "before" picture in one of
Clements's many stress-education brochures. I had about 20 minutes
for our interview and lunch, a time that seems quite generous in my
recent time allotment, and they had played Creed one too many times
in Kohlberg that day. I was ready to punch something or yell at somewell, just do something unpleasant.
thing or throw-up or
Perhaps you've felt like this in the past? Perhaps you breathe?
According to Clements, members of the Student Academic Mentor program recognized this problem and turned to her for support. In
response, Clements gave a workshop on stress management, yoga and
acupressure on Monday, Oct. 28. Acupressure uses meridian points to
gently relieve chronic tension, free suppressed emotions and promote
relaxation. According to Clements, the point of acupressure is to allow
the hornet's nest that is the Swarthmore mind to disperse and share
the energy trapped in the mind and heart throughout the body.
Clements presented her techniques to help Swarthmore students
something that, according to
focus, concentrate and breathe

the most powerful tool we have to bring focus and spaciousness back

into our minds," says Clements.
Clements provided what I found to be the most insightful
metaphors about what happens to a body under stress. "Imagine the
difference between living in a feng shui dream, a house whose chi is
flowing, and a cluttered house whose doorway is blocked," she said.
"Our minds become cluttered, almost claustrophobic under stress. We
can't concentrate and focus because we have no capacity to."
Clements was quite attuned to the stress Swarthmore students
undergo everyday. "I apologize if my speech is a bit slurred or I'm not
working up to my potential today. I didn't get enough sleep last night
and now I'm working at your level," she said. "Swarthmore students
have powerful minds, some of the best minds in the world, and that
power can be destructive when it feels trapped."
But, according to Clements, there's hope. "When you all focus your
concentration to body /mind techniques, you do it better than anyone I

know," she said of Swatties.
Education is the key to knowing how to relax. My roommate and I
have a relaxation technique in the form of a sign in our dorm room
that reads, "Dammit, it's pass/fail!" We've thought of changing the sign
next semester to "Dammit, it's only the rest of your life!" Obviously,
amateur attempts at relaxation can be dangerous. Clements has considered continuing the stress-management workshops at Swarthmore
but realizes she needs the support of administration and students.
"The college, I think, was a bit surprised by the turnout at the last
workshop," Clements said. "They didn'tthink there would be nearly as
many students as there were. [There were about 40-45 students at the
workshop.] To that, I have one thing to say: DUH!"

How to handle stress
1 Talk to someone you trust about your concerns
2. Exercise!
3. Practice deep breathing, count to ten or scream into a pillow.
4. Daydream. Use your imagination to take you away from your

stressful situation.
5. Get at least 8 (yes, eight) hours of sleep every night.
6. Use positive self-affirmations to stay optimistic.
7. Accept your imperfections as you accept others.
8. Never compare yourself to others.
9. Focus on NOW! Then breeeaaaatttthhhhhhhe!!
ID. Have fun! We were born to enjoy life.

THE PHOENIX

I slip
In
To the Intercultural Center; the warm air like
soft paper caresses my skin. I am here to witness
something beautiful and erotic and sort of cheesy, a
true expression of the repressed Swat sexual psyche: the annual Ourstory Erotic Poetry reading.
I am here, accompanied by a dark-haired, mysterious lady of Willets, Sonia Vallabh 'O6, a couple of
minutes before the advertised starting timeof 8 p.m.
She is here to do some beautiful reading. I am here
to do some nasty journalism. To thatend I have also
brought with me my two romantic partners for the
night: a pad of paper and a digital camera. I note
that there seem to be only seven other people here
enough for an orgy, perhaps, but a poetry
so far
reading? By 8:22, when the IC has finally filled to
capacity and the reading is ready to begin, I have
come to realize thatErotic Poetry cannot be rushed.
It can only by stimulated.
By lights and flowers and incense spread about
the room by the Ourstory editors, silk sheets and
voluptuous pillows, raunchily red strawberries and
Sweet Tarts®? I feel ensconced in intimacy, and I
listen to the words tripping off my fellow explorers
of lyrical eroticism, trying to get a sense of what to
expect: "... It's interesting, it's written from a guy's
perspective...," '"...Open your legs to your 300
lovers simultaneously...'," and "... yeah, I was just
...

watching 'Jackass'...."

Then, like-the first thrusting, pulsing movements of a cylinder in an internal combustion
engine, it begins. "Welcome, Poets and Perverts,"
says Cindy Briano 'O3, one of the editors of Ourstory
magazine, which is hosting this delightful night.
"We hope that this will be hot and sassy."
Oh, it is. Well, somewhat. Many have their own
writing to read, others use sample poetry that they
have picked up around the room, such as the one
that Vallabh has picked up and will eventually read:
"The Writing" by Jenn Wilson, with such delicacies
as "I've had trains rush through my tunnel, coaxed
open petals, seen God, and writhed atop," and "It
mostly boils down to fruit. Limp brown bananas
and the ass-crack of every peach." Damn, with that
kind of corny, exuberant imagery, how could you go
wrong? Joe Roth 'O6 reads first, something about
frogs and enzymes and slugs and other sexy things,
and I wonder:

That is erotic?
Yes, this is still Swarthmore, my friend: the next
reader gives us an account of the mating habits of
dragons and a lesson about olfactory bulbs. Yep. But

November 7, 2002

at least she does use the word breastplate. Lisa
Hunter 'O6 is up next, and she reads from some old
Roman poet, Catullus, and hey, I realize this is actually pretty good: "shriveled testicles" nice! Aaron
is everyone here a freshman?
Strong 'O6
reads
some good stuff, but what is "snowballing"? It
sounds gross. For a change of pace, Jonathan
Schneider 'O5 recites one of his Dada-esque Daily

Jolt "The Chicken" posts. It is entitled "Michael In
A Tunnel," and it is strange, as expected. Yet, when
it's over, all I can think is: Jonathan, you're so hot.
Oh yes, now sexy Cindy steps up to announce a
'contest,' coyly inviting us to write a piece of
impromptu poetry using the starter line "Secretly, I
want...." Oh baby, you know what / secretly want.
I want this camera to work, actually; I seem to have
grown technologically inept since I stepped in here
and it doesn't help that I have no photomertagraphy
skills to begin with. Yes, I admit it: I don't know how
to use my tool.
Oh well, for soon steps up Jody Fisher 'O5, a man
of such legend that no film could accurately capture
him. But his friends, who have collaboratively written his poem for him, one friend doing a line each,
seem to have made a stab at it. He pauses, having
read the poem for the first time only minutes before,
almost refusing to read it. Thankfully he decides
against this and starts with the (what will soon be)
immortal lines: "I love my penis / It is beautiful."
Brilliant.

Steve Bhardwaj 'O6 rends the air with some furious spoken word poetry, and I am stunned. If this
guy ever gives recitals or appears at any poetry
slams, I'll be there. But the best (totally subjective,
everyone was really good), was yet to come: Arthur
Chu 'O6. He gives his take on the "World's Shortest
Haiku", which is reproduced, as well as I can
remember, below.

Moan moan moan moan mooaaan
Moan moan moan moan moan moan moan
moooaaaan
Moan moan moan moan mooaaannnnnn
The room goes wild. I am now very happy, lost in
the swirl of erotic poetry, and the next half-an-hour
rushes past me, the gasps for breath after the climaxing line of a poem the only time for reflection
on the little pearls of sensual language being
spewed on me. It is quite a night, and I don't think I
could tell it all.
You'll just have to go to it next year.
Oh yes.

WHERE DID ALL THIS DOG HAIR COME FROM?
A pet expert argues that parrots, turtles and even the Willets eat make us all happier people
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu
The last time a large tan and white rabbit e-mailed
Assistant Dean and Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal, she responded as she has to numerous dorm
dwellers over the years. No pets are allowed. The rule
stands, despite the bunny's stated wishes.
Ariana Lindermayer 'O3, one of the Worth residents who
once enjoyed the bunny's company and helped it sign the email, said the bunny now makes its home with a college staff
member.
I know about pets. Maybe not about bunnies, but my family has a dog. His name is Indy. The Guiding Eyes for the
Blind program bred him, but he flunked out and it shows.
Six weeks after moving in, Indy swallowed half a bottle's
worth of Advil and had to be rushed to the animal hospital
to have his stomach pumped, right about the time Hurricane
Floyd happened to hit. It's hard to drive to a hospital in the
midst of hurricane, trust me. That was the worst stunt Indy

ever pulled, followed by the time he swallowed a stick ofbutter whole.
Nevertheless, I love Indy. He does this really cute thing
on walks where he'll take the leash in his mouth and direct
you where he wants to go. Sometimes, especially when I
think about this stunt
like right now
I miss Indy a lot.
I miss him so much that I wouldn't mind having him spending his nights on my dorm room floor. Indy and my roommate's dog (who is really, really big) could both come to campus and hang out together. It would be really cool. (I've also
heard that dogs are great chick magnets.)

Unfortunately, this dream can never be realized because
of this little rule in our student handbooks the same rule
that disrupted the life and habits of the Worth bunny. It's
pretty long, and I don't want to bore y'all, so I'm not going to
recite its entire length. Myrt Westphal was kind enough to
provide me with an informative synopsis: Whenever she or

another member of the housing and residential life committee hears about a resident pet on campus, its owner is notified and given a few days to remove the pet, or otherwise the
SPCA is called in. That's pretty serious; I mean that there's
the need for an acronym and everything. However, as students here at this wonderful campus, is it fair that we're subjected to such a harsh law regarding our soft spot for furry,
adorable cuteness?
As a child, Westphal had a bunny she won at a magic
show and "the usual turtles and fish." She also had a dog
named Sam for 16 years who died 15 months ago. (I offer my
deepest condolences to the Westphal family. I can't imagine
losing Indy. It must have been really hard on her femily).
Obviously, this residential rule does not exist because of lingering childhood resentments. It's not like Westphal asked
her parents for a hamster for Christmas at the age of 9 and
they didn't pull through. She has been living a happy, petpopulated life and I congratulate her for that.
However, Westphal told me, "Pets are a burden to folks
with allergies and the environmental services staff who
must clean up after them. Some pets create fears."
Andrew Gisselquist 'O5, an insightful fellow, concurs.
"There's already enough crap in the hall and hair in the
showers," he said. "I don't need anybody's cute, furry, little
pe(s)ts getting in things and adding to the mess." Ouch!
Erica Siegel 'O5, a girl in my Spanish class, said that her
RA last year had a bald rat in her room. She never saw the
rat, nor does she want to. That sounds scary enough to me.
So pets can be both menacing and messy. Points taken.
However, after that, Dean Westphal's logic became a little
fuzzy. She wrote to me, "You do have a lot of friends living
down the hall, usually with their doors open, so you have
access to a lot of company in a residence hall." I like my
friends on my hall and all over campus a lot; they're really
cool and usually have their doors open. But, can I really pet
them? I mean, I would probably get a lot of strange looks if I
started to stroke Holice Kil 'o4's chin repeatedly, or throw a

tennis ball at Tedi Asher 'O5 and expect her to return it to me.
Caroline Bermudez 'O3 has patted me on the head a couple of
times, but I don't think this qualifies. There is obviously
something missing here on campus that can only be fulfilled
by the cuddly company of pets.
There are definitely people in Worth and Willets who
agree with me. There was the aforementionedWorth bunny;
Dean Westphal discovered it and the acronyms almost
arrived, but not before a series of e-mails transpired between
and the bunny and Dean Westphal.
Stephanie Lee 'O6, an awesome hallmate of mine, definitely supports the addition of pets to the Swarthmore community. She eloquently stated, "Each hall should definitely
have its own communal pet, like a small kitty. We can have
a hall litter-box and it wouldn't be a big issue. And if someone's allergic, we can just get a damnfish."
As luck would have it, a cat haunts Willets. He's apparently been here for years, but no one seems to know very
much about him. He's actually starting to freak me out a bit.
Whenever I pass him, he is always completely motionless; I
feel strangely compelled to toss him a few quarters, as I
would to the street performers in Times Square. I'm not a cat
person, so I can't imagine what it must have been like when
he got into Willets last year and snuggled up next to Maya
Schenwar 'O5 while she was asleep.
Despite this, the Willets cat is a step in the right direction. Our campus needs more pets. As Ruben Juarez 'O3,
says, "I don'tknow what the big deal is. In Thailand, you can
do whatever you want."

Inspired by his comments, I propose a "Pets Week." We
can have dogs sniffing each other in McCabe, bunnies cleaning the trays in Sharpies, turtles on the treadmills in the
Mullan Center and parrots giving comments during my
sociology course in Kohlberg. It might be distracting at first,
but very quickly everyone will notice an exponential
increase in general campus happiness, and for that week,
we'd have the coolest school ever. Trust me on this one.

Open minds
We Swatties are not known for political apathy;
an outspoken defender of any political opinion is
sure to draw a crowd. Whether the crowd comes
carrying fresh roses or rotten tomatoes, though, is
often hard to control; one sometimes wishes campus groups would try harder to prevent the latter,
rather than explicitly provoking controversy.
For instance, Tim Wise, a radical antiracist
activist, has been engaged by JATO/SATO to speak
on the situation in the Middle East. Wise has, in
his writings, referred to Zionism as the newest
form ofanti-Semitism held by self-hating Jews,
criticized Joseph Lieberman as "hardly recognizable as Jewish" and generally attacked mainstream
American Jewish pro-Israel politics as a form of

assimilationism and cultural self-destruction in the

service of white establishment interests.

From the other side, David Horowitz, an outspoken conservative critic ofliberal academia (of
which Swarthmore is the local capital), has been
asked by several campus Republicans to come to
campus. He has described the anti-war protests in
Washington as 'a movement of America-hating
communists," run a series ofads in campus newspapers blaming civil rights organizations for
African-American poverty and generally held that
liberalism is the enemy of freedom and responsible
for most of the world's suffering.
Anyone got their hackles up yet?
One thing both speakers' sponsors have in common is that they seem to expect closed-mindedness
from Swatties as a matter of course. Maybe JATO
hopes a few broadsides from Wise will wake us up
to the fact that there are Jewish people who don't
like Israel; some College Republicans seem to think
that without a shakeup from Horowitz our troop of
Swat liberal clones won't have any dialogue to
break our smug mutual back-patting routine.
Debates are still raging over whetherthe college's funding these voices from the extremes is
beneficial for our campus. It is hard for many students to justify limited student funds going to these
tomato-target speakers, yet most agree that true

political dialogue doesn't exist if we don't try to
hear out both radical and reactionary voices.
What seems clear, though, is that the best thing
any Swattie can do, whether a Zionist zealot,
Arafat apologist, standard Swat socialist, renegade
Republican rabblerouser or anything in between,
is to prove these spokespeople for campus political
groups wrong in their doubts. Show them that our
egos can survive one inflammatory attack on our
belief systems. Let's listen to them, be civil, be outspoken; let's stand up for our beliefs and prove our
security and maturity as intellectual adults.

If you don't get it, then we need to talk
Dear Editor:
The following is a version of the letter that we sent to the Administration
Monday, November 4th. It has been
edited to address the general campus
community. We are sharing this letter
with the campus community in the
hopes that we may all take part in the
dialogue with our administration and
each other concerning these issues.
On Saturday, October 26, four offensive incidents transpired on campus.
We are writing to address these incidents and the subsequent reactions of
our college community.
During the Mary Lyon Halloween
party, a white student painted his face
black. He approached several black students at the party and jokingly claimed
to be black.
Two other white students attended
the party dressed as "lazy Mexicans,"
wearing sombreros and ponchos, holding beers and feigning drunkenness.
A Jewish student attended in what
he claims was an "Arab male" costume.
Other students at the party construed
his costume to be of a Palestinian terrorist.
In addition, three African-American
Muslim students received an anonymous e-mail titled "Happy Halloween,
F***ing Terrorists." The text read,

"Happy Halloween, f***ing black terror-

ists. May Allah burn you alive with the
Devil."
Though we recognize that not all of
these events were perpetrated with the
intent of harming others, several issues
have surfaced as a result of them.
First, we feel that communication
and dialogue around racial/cultural
sensitivity has been fragmented and
inadequate.
Second, no one discouraged these
students from committing these offenses; some were even encouraged by thenpeers. The fact that certain students

were not aware or did not care that
these actions were inappropriate and
hurtful to some on this campus necessitates serious cooperative effort to educate the general campus.

Third, these actions perpetuated
stereotypes that have historically been

harmful to other members of the com-

munity. The performances of blackface,
"lazy" Mexicans and "Palestinian terrorist" are hurtful in particular
because the perpetuation of these
images is used to justify violence and
racism toward black, Latino and Arab

peoples. In committing these acts, stu-

dents have alienated and in some cases
threatened the security of other members of Swarthmore community.

Advertise in the Phoenix.

phoenix@swarthmore.edu.

November 7. 2002

Finally, members of the administration, after being informed about at least
one of these incidents, failed to
acknowledge and address the effects of
these occurrences within the student
community.
The above grievances stem from two
main issues: 1) that as students of color
we are not provided with an open space

for discussion within and amidst the
greater college community, and 2) that
the administration, once aware of these
incidents, must respond appropriately.

The perpetuation of racist images,
whether performed with intent to
offend or not, is a matter that must be
discussed beyond circles of activists
and students of color.
We would like to suggest a course of
action. First, we call for administrators
to acknowledge and address the incidents publicly. Second, we encourage
them to support ah open campus educational as well as promotion of continued campus wide dialogue. We would
like the administration to take a strong
role in promoting a healthier campus
environment for all of us.

Reelections are easy

The 2002 election has been a
depressing one. The American people are not very happy with their
elected representatives. We're stuck
in economic malaise, we may be

the public thinks that things will get
even worse. But although we don't
like our Congresspeople, it's unlikely that we're going to throw the rascals out. Polls show that barely a
handful of Congressional races are
remotely competitive this year.

Chalkings embody nonviolence
Dear Editor:
I am troubled by Jesse Hartigan's suggestion that
the Coming Out Week chalkings renounced the tradition of nonviolent social change as a result of their
"insensitivity" and "sexual forcefulness" ("Insensitive
chalkings give Swat bad name," Oct. 31). As someone
who, like Jesse, feels an affinity for the tradition of
nonviolence, I want to argue that the chalkings are a
form of nonviolent social action.
Gandhi teaches us to confront systems of violence

using nonviolent tactics. Queer activism does this by
opposing the system of heterosexism. This system is
built on the invalidation and policing of gender performances and sexualities that do not fit the dominant
model of straightness. By creating a queer-positive
space —one that validates marginalized gender performances and/or sexualities—the chalkings challenge heterosexist violence.
So, do the chalkings fight violence with violence?
Jesse highlights two chalkings that he sees as doing

this. The first, "Mmm

...

Jesus loves me

...

uh huh!"

supposedly "displays a lack of sensitivity towards all
Christians." Instead, isn't it possible that the chalking
expresses the radical theological position that erotic
love can be sacred? Throughout its history,
Christianity has presented divine love as infinitely
higher than erotic love —a position that has allowed

the church to present sexuality, especially sexuality
that doesn't follow God's command to "be fruitful and
multiply," as something that is sinful as it alienates us
from God. This anti-erotic and anti-queer position is

opposed by radical theologians who want to eroticize
our relationship with the divine. I see this theological
position as sensitizing Christianity to its own violence, allowing us to more fully realize the beloved
community.
Jesse identifies the chalking of "bend over, young
man," as not following the doctrine of ethical intelligence popularized by our very own President. While
there is no reason given in the letter for this argument, the implied argument is that anal sex, even in
the context of a consensual sexual relationship, is not
ethically intelligent —an argument that validates heterosexism. The only way to read this chalking as violent is to see it as demanding that the reader engage in
nonconsensual anal sex —a reading which, taken in
context, is patently absurd.
At the end of his letter, Jesse asks us to reevaluate
the chalkings in reference to the tradition of nonviolence. Instead, I think that we should allow the chalkings to call into question our own internalized queerphobia —a process that will help us to build a more
nonviolent community.

'Congratulations' on queer coverage
Dear Editor:
I would like to thank The Phoenix in general and
Matthew Fitting, Greg Nelson and Aviva Aron-Dine in
particular for their sensitive coverage of queer issues
at Swarthmore.
This year's Coming Out Week issue offered the
right blend of hearty congratulation to those of us in
the queer community who are assimilationists and
tactful reproach to those who are not.
As a queer person, I was especially grateful to find
a sizeable chunk of Nelson's article ("Homophobia and
SQU," Oct. 31) devoted to the lively opinions of sopho-

more Jeff Rogg, who last year verbally assaulted a
queer student here because he found her support of the

chalkings "disgusting" ("Chalkings spur 'homophobic

harrassment'," Oct. 25, 2001). Jeffs generous change of
heart regarding the chalkings was truly touching; if he
supports us, we must surely be on the right track.
Like Brian Nolan ("Homophobia and SQU," "What

I would sooner get into a drinking contest with an Irish novelist than I would run for office against an incumbent politician.
At least I can trust the Irishman to play the game fairly. If I lose,
it is because he is the better man, not because the rules were

rigged in his favor from the get-go. That simple principle' does
not hold in politics. As long as a politician does not get involved
in some grotesque, Fatty Arbuckle sex farce, run his fund-raising
committee like Don Corleone's olive oil company, or start spreading rumors about how George W. Bush blew up the Twin Towers
at the behest of international Jewry, he or she is virtually guaranteed reelection. When politicians do lose their seats due to
glaring personal defects, it is usually in the primaries.
This represents a giant leap backwards for political discourse. Since the parties don't have to make much of an effort to
convert swing voters, they don't have an incentive to vigorously
debate their positions or to build broad coalitions. And since it's
almost impossible for either party to win a resounding victory,
the marginal elections which do make a difference will become
much more vicious. I hope you enjoyed the controversy of the
Florida recounts, because we're probably going to see lots more
of it. The very idea of having a sweeping "mandate from the people" may soon be a relic.
This makes Watergate look like small potatoes. Richard
Milhouse Nixon was indeed a crook, but he never did this much
damage to American democracy. Bugging the McGovern campaign was a very bad thing to do, but it didn't cause a perpetual
stalemate in Congress and it certainly didn't transform the
nation into a series of feudal fiefdoms.
Unfortunately, we can't expect that the reaction to this scandal will be comparable to Watergate. In 1974 there were plenty
of people who were willing to make Nixon's chicanery into a
major issue, because they hated him and stood to profit from
his fall. Nobody has a strong incentive to step forward regarding this mess. No major politician will make election reform
into a part of his or her campaign, because the current situation benefits both of the major parties. A third-party candidate
might bring the issue up, but nobody listens to them, as they
tend to be cranks.
Even the media will not give gerrymandering more than a
cursory examination. Unlike Watergate, which had the romance
of burglary, conspiracies and an informer named 'Deep Throat,'
this issue involves the driest, most technical aspects of the political system. It is worse than a high-school civics class. Can you
imagine what would happen if the networks were to stop covering matters like the Winona Ryder trial so as to free up airtime
for in-depth coverage of redistricting? The TV-viewing public
would rise up, storm the studios, and behead Dan Rather as a
warning to his fellow newsmen. If only there were a way to link
sexy girls in handcuffs with election reform, the Republic might
be saved.

Deeds, not creeds,
should define Scouts
A college freshman in Seattle
doesn't believe in God, like hundreds of thousands of other college freshmen nationwide. For
him, however, the issue's a little
more loaded, because, until
recently, he was about to become
an Eagle Scout, the highest
honor in the Boy Scout tradition.
For having the courage to tell
the scouting officials, during an
unconventional religious discus-

sion, that he did not believe in
God, this Boy Scout is being
rejected from the association
and told that he needs to find

L. Never mind that this kid has
orchestrated numerous community service projects in the
Seattle area and volunteered his time and energy to the scouting program and his community. Never mind that this kid
more strongly represents all other supposed tenets of the Boy

Scouts of America than any Boy Scout I've ever encountered.
He doesn't believe in God. Stick a fork in him. He's done.
The officials defend their position, saying that belief in
God is a central concept of the Scouts program, primarily in
the rehearsal of their creed
"On my honor, I will try to do
my duty to serve God and my country
and rarely, if
ever, in discussion of what God means to them and how God
influences the ways in which they live their lives.

'Offensive' chalkings expression of queer identity
Dear Editor:
Greg Nelson's article "Homophobia and SQU" (Oct.
31) misrepresents homophobia on campus and queer
communities here by quoting only one conversation
with a queer student. I do not know if Nelson
approached queers besides Nolan and myself. He called
me the night his article was due, and he was gone by the
time I could return his call.
So let me say now that if Nolan has not experienced
significant queerphobia or transphobia on this campus,
I have, from students, faculty, and staff, in written, spoken, and physical form. Calling homophobia "blown out
of proportion" belittles that experience.
Any homophobia is too much homophobia for the
accepting community Swarthmore claims and (perhaps) strives to be.
It is possible to argue responsibly for integrationism. To do so, it is essential to recognize that choosing integrationism is a privilege. Nolan's ideal of a
queer couple and a straight couple sharing a white picket fence is not just integrationist. It is also racist, classist, transphobic, and ablist, to name a few. Similarly,
lauding the shared "humanity" of straights and queers
trivializes the differences which determine the unequal
terms under which real humans live

Irresponsible integrationism benefits from exclusion,

from saying to mainstream (straight) society "We are like
you" by saying "We are not like them." I would rather try
to stand with sex queers, gender queers, working-class
queers, queers of color, disabled queers, fat queers, and
anyone who can stand my company than with my white,
upper middle-class, conservative neighbors.
In his letter, Jesse Hartigan says that the chalkings
"Mmm...Jesus loves me" and "Bend over, young man"
injure Swarthmore's reputation for "ethical intelligence." There are queer Christians. There are also
Christians who say "Jesus loves you" as part of antiqueer rhetoric spoofed in that chalking. There are
smart people who have sex. There are ethical people
who have sex. They may even have implied anal sex
with a young man in a standing position while thinking
ethically intelligent thoughts. I fail to see the contradiction. This is not "sexual forcefulness." It is one among
many representations of sexual acts and identities.
Even so, there may be some visitors who are turned
off by the chalkings. Certainly there are visitors (I was
one) who feel relieved, accepted, and safe because-of a
wide-ranging, self-contradictory, fun-loving, attemptedinclusive, colorful depiction of queer and sexual identity.

that God was part of the program because he said the creed;
they even go so far as to accuse him of fraudulent participaBasically, it's a vacuous, meaningless affirmation, but

tion, because he went through the motions of the two-second
statement without ever believing what he was claiming. But
the same creed includes such virtues as courage, compassion
and preparedness, all of which the atheist Scout seems to
have in abundance, and all of which I'd be willing to bet
many other Boy Scouts don't. Are they going to kick some kid
out for being a wuss?
When I think of Boy Scouts, I don't automatically think of
Christianity, or any religion. That's sort of trifling in comparison to the more ambitious, practical applications of the program. God's just background noise. The Boy Scout organization seems to be more fundamentally about acquiring skills
that can later be used in service projects and fostering a sense
ofcommitment to the group and the greater community.
Should this Scout, really, at the age of seven, when he
joined Cub Scouts, have been thinking about his understanding of and relationship with God and how that would bear on
his ability to act as an Eagle Scout? Obviously, what he
lacked wasn't detrimental. The newspaper descriptions of the
kid's devotion to the program are amazing. He really cares
about Boy Scouts, even as they're trying to kick him out.
The scouting program has obviously enriched this Scout's
life, and he, in turn, is working to enrich the program, but I
wonder if his energy might have been better expended elsewhere, if there were alternative programs established to help
achieve the same goals and targeted at the same population.
Maybe then his position on God and the cosmos wouldn't
matter so much. Maybe then his devotion and good works,
those things that truly matter, would be recognized and appreciated for what they are, not shrouded in some "if you say you
believe in God, we'll give you your birdie pin" bullshit.
The kid deserves highest honors for all the things he's
done out of the goodness of his heart, but also for saying no
to his mom when she told him to just lie and say he believed
in God so he could get his Eagle. He deserves recognition that
extends beyond some patch or pin because he has established
himself as a leader and model citizen for everyone, Boy
Scouts, college students and designated officials alike.

Dear Editor:

Nelson's article "Homophobia and SQU" (Oct.
31) focused on political conflict within the queer community and "straight male bashing," not on homophobia. I found this trivializing and offensive because real
homophobia exists here. Nelson quoted Jeff Rogg extensively. Last year, Rogg called a Coming Out Week tabler
"an evil and disgusting person" and asserted that "if all
queer people were like 'that', then [they] don't deserve
to have any rights." He accused queer people of being
"belligerent" and stepped threateningly towards her,
telling her to "bring it on." Those are quotes that belong
in an article about homophobia at Swarthmore.
Nelson also stated that no straight males took part in
the discussion of straight male flirting at the QS A meetGreg

ing last week. I go to QSA every week and didn't know
the sexual orientations of several people who spoke.
Nelson, apparently, was able to tell just by looking. His
assumption included at least two straight men whose
comments were received without hostility or antagonism. Just because someone at a Queer Straight
Alliance meeting doesn't preface every comment with
"As a straight male" doesn't mean they aren't one.

As a straight anti-integrationist, I was also disturbed that the article conflated integrationism and rec-

ognizing straight people's humanity. The goal of integrationism is to participate fully in mainstream culture, which perpetuates all sorts of oppression, including sexism, racism, classism, economic injustice and
homophobia. It oppresses not only those it excludes, but
those who participate in it and those who try not to.
Queer people can live in communities with straight
people without buying SUVs and expensive houses in
white middle-class neighborhoods. Brian Nolan's idea
that "straight people" have white picket fences offends
me, partly because I reject that ideal for myself. More
importantly, poor people and many people of color,
among others, cannot live in those neighborhoods. That
ideal depends implicitly on their exclusion.
Finally, just one of the many flaws in the chalking
article: the assumption that all chalkers were "SQU members." There were straight chalkers, as well as queer
chalkers who aren't in SQU. Apparently the author didn't
read the chalkings carefully enough to notice the large,
pink "STRAIGHT PEOPLE CHALK TOO."

Chalking has purpose beyond SQU PR
Dear Editor:

As two Coming Out Week chalkers, we felt the need to
respond to last week's Phoenix. Last year we confronted

this issue with different viewpoints; Jessica supported the
chalkings, while Steve was disgusted by what he saw as a
public celebration of gay sex. We both chalked this year
because Steve decided he was

fed up with having been
exposed to the inappropriate
Multiple
and offensive remarks that
are part and parcel of everyday heterosexist discourse to
the point where he is still
uncomfortable with the idea
of ever having sex.
Queer people aren't sup'-I^^^^^^^^^^^^M
posed to be offensive because
that alienates straight people from the cause. We should
smile, be friendly and make good neighbors, so that we
are not so vilified. Someone growing up straight doesn't
have to make the same conciliatory effort to survive
socially; this is a form of oppression.
In taking offense to a remark directed at Jesus, Jesse
Hartigan reveals his powerful position in Christian-dominated America. Being offended, ignored and ostracized is
a daily ritual for many queer people and we're not that
bothered if Jesse had to endure a couple of days of it. As
the authors of the "Jesus LOVES me" chalking, we were

surprised to hear that Steve wasn't sensitive to his own
religion. Like Jesse, he and several other chalkers are
Christian, but we didn't find the chalking particularly
upsetting. Maybe we have more practice getting over it.
In "What to Chalk and Why," some SQU members were
quoted as having a problem with the chalking of graphic
statements. They complained

that all chalkers are SQU members or, indeed, are even
permitted to attend SQU meetings. It implies that SQU is
the epicenter of "the" queer community on campus.
It is true that because this perception is widely
held,any explicitly queer action potentially reflects upon
SQU. But this is not the fault of those who do not or cannot attend SQU meetings. Personally, we believe that multiple and contradicting queer communities exist, not all of
which have a responsibility to the concerns of SQU.

Not everyone can assimilate
Dear Editor:
It is strange thatKatie Davenport chose to depict the
range of sexual identity among queers with the statement "It is possible to be queer without identifying as a

pervert, a deviant or a butt pirate" (letter, Oct. 31).
These terms appeared on the slew of stickers and buttons handed out in Sharpies alongside breeder, lesbian,
assimilationist and anything someone decided to write
on a blank sticker. Similarly, the chalkings ranged from
"we love our queer profs" (the majority) to the nowinfamous "eating pussy is the
mm^mm
new first base" (Attentiongrabbing. Titillating!).
Davenport's
fear,
it
seems, is not that there is
only one radical, explicit

of queers, but that
there is an explicit one at all.

Are the SQU/QSA chalkings any more explicit than
the Dash-for-Cash "penis, vagina, boobs, ass?" Is it the
sexual topic which some, such as Jeff Rogg, find so
antagonizing, or is it the queer setting? Which is, of
course, the whole point. To enter queers into the sexual
discourse in a positive way, for once. You cannot condemn queer sex in public yet try to support your queer

friends in private.

them dirtying your queer or straight name, you will
merely perpetuate hatred of those who do not deserve

Rather than talking to me and finding out the real

are the real reasons:
L It gets extremely cold in Olde Club in later months,
making it highly unpleasant for audiences and acts to
be inside for a three to four hour show due to the fact
that people constantly go in and out of the club.
Furthermore, our heater isn't always reliable.
2. Scheduling. I cannot always get acts when I want

using Olde Club for parties and artistic and musical performances (including the Swat Band extravaganza) in
November and December. We have to keep the space open
so other students can use it. Paces can only be used so much.
Next time, ask questions. That is what reporting is
about. The editorial you made against Olde Club was
unjustified and unfounded.

Hey, I have publishable comedic gold too
Dear Editor:
Regarding Rachel Burstein's article in last week's
Phoenix and the backlash that followed, I would just
like to state for the record that I actually felt a bit of
jealousy toward all the attention that the Mertz Football
fans received. I should also state right now that this letter, like most of my stories, goes nowhere and is laced
with the sort of grouchiness and self-deprecation that
lead me to believe that I am actually an 80-year-old man.
With that said, I shall now use this sentence as an awkward segue into my stupid and convoluted point.
They almost hit the sprinkler with their football!? So
what? I once hit my sister in the face with a rubber
Frisbee and got my birthday party cancelled. Nobody
wrote about that little incident! But looking back on it

Safety made sure to inform me that this was, in reality,
an undesirable situation. Perhaps the best example,
however, was the time when a hallmate asked me to
keep my voice down while I was in a video-gameinduced haze. My swift response was a resounding
"NOPE." Aren't you impressed?
I wish I had Rachel Burstein at my side to chronicle
every single instance of me doing something stupid or
ridiculous. I would even kill you, O loyal Phoenix reader, to get this opportunity.
At this point you may be wondering whether I'm
being sarcastic or am actually supportive of Rachel's
article. I'm kinda wondering too. I think my original
point was that I really didn't care either way and neither should anyone else but at this point I've gotten too
distracted thinking about eating my next chicken salad
bag lunch that everything seems pretty unimportant.
Oh well. Funny article though.

every $lO we spend at the grocery store is the cost of packaging. Choose the products with
the least packaging. Bring reusable bags for shopping, carry
your own cutlery for on-the-go meals, and refill your pencils
and pens with graphite and ink rather than tossing them. The
best defense is a good offense.

U.S. farmers produce 280 million tons
of excess agricultural fiber, which
could be made into paper.
But once you've used something, you should recycle it.
Recycling gives many people the satisfaction that they are preventing the extraction of virgin materials, conserving natural
resources, and creating raw materials for manufacturing that
are cheaper than virgin raw materials and therefore ostensibly lead to lower consumer costs. Recycling is also economically sound.
It is challenging but possible to calculate a precise costbenefit analysis that accounts for every bottle and battery. (I'm
not the person you're looking for on that one). But there are
direct financial benefits. The Borough of Swarthmore has 6170
citizens (including students, according to the 2000 census). In
2001, the borough recycled 832.8 total tons, 94.35 of which was
from Swarthmore College. This performance earned the borough a check for $21,883 from the Pennsylvania state government
to help subsidize its recycling program. Then, the Borough of
Swarthmore's recycled aluminum in 1998 was sold at $660/ ton.
All of Swarthmore's trash, on the other hand, goes to the
American Ref-Fuel incinerator in Chester, which produces electricity from the combustion process. Aluminum and glass are
melted in the incinerator, ending up as ash, which is transported to a landfill. Landfill and incineration fees are generally
upwards of $lOO/ton (Passaic County, N. J.), and cannot generate
revenue like recycled materials.
In Goldstein's column, he stated that "[reasoning that secycling paper saves trees] neglects the fact that the vast majority
of trees used in paper manufacturing are planted for exactly
that purpose." Statistics are difficult to find, and for that reason,
this overarching statement has no credibility. By recycling
paper and creating consumer demand for non-wood-derived
fibers, we could dramatically reduce clear-cutting that increases the probability of wildfires, mudslides and species extinction.
U.S. farmers produce 280 million tons of excess agricultural
fiber, which could be made into paper. These materials (crops
such as kenaf) require fewer chemicals, less water and less
energy to pulp, and they result in a higher fiber yield than
wood. They can be grown sustainabiy, without pesticides and
with little or no fertilizer or chemicals.
As I run out of space, let me just say that 1) old-growth forests
are still being logged 2) a tree farm is not a forest ecosystem 3) logging our national forests is not economically profitable. The
National Forest Service is wasting our tax dollars. Please conserve paper.
Swarthmore College has approximately doubled the
amount of its recycling over the past two weeks, after the new
recycling signs were put up. We should be proud of ourselves
and keep it up. Efficiency is the watchword for consumption.
Once we've already consumed something, we need to act for
everyone's benefit and recycle.

BY ARTHUR CHU

As a neophyte rugger, I've recently been exposed to many
exciting facets of rugby culture: cute nicknames, hourlong
sprints, giant dogpile tackles and rookie lifts (don't ask). I've
almost gotten the beer smell out of my T-shirt, and the double
vision has cleared up enough for me to recognize some of my
teammates. I've almost begun to feel at home in the culture (that
song mocking Christianity is pretty catchy).
But then there are those embarrassing moments when as a
rugger, even a nascent one, I feel unfairly singled out, and
become defensive of certain less-than-tasteful rugby traditions
out of a Voltairesque sense of free speech and fair play.
Like this Dash for Cash thing.
Well
that name is inaccurate. First of all, it's no longer officially the Dash for Cash. The Dash for Cash has been discontinued by the administration. What we had last Friday was the Cash
for Dash.

(Shh!)

Secondly, it's no longer really a rugby team event. It can't be,
because the Dash for Cash was a rugby event, and this isn't the
Dash for Cash. It's just a general campus fundraising event open
to all comers who have a predilection for sprinting around campus au naturale. All comers being, for the most part, rugby team
members, and the funds raised, for the most part, going to the
rugby teams. But it's all aboveboard, trust me.
Why this admittedly halfhearted attempt at subterfuge? It
dates back to a letter to the Phoenix written by religion professor
Jerry Frost last year, in which he argued that the Dash for Cash,
a longstanding rugby tradition involving streaking through
Parrish for money, counted as a form of exploitation of sexuality
for monetary gain, a form of soft porn, if you will.

Lord knows the men's rugby team
indulges in this hobby completely
gratis on multiple other occasions
throughout the year.
This argument is tenuous, at best. The fundraising aspect of the
Dash for Cash was an afterthought addition to a streaking tradition that already existed. It seems to me to have no more to do with
the nature of the event than selling stickers and little poetry booklets has to do with the purpose of SAO's Yellow Rage poetry slams.
Lord knows the men's rugby team indulges in this hobby completely gratis on multiple other occasions throughout the year.
As for exploitation? Well, aside from the fact that these people
do this entirely voluntarily (quite a few team members don't participate, including myself), I don't think it's considered that
much of a titillating experience. Streaking is, frankly, not very
erotic. The sight of a herd of ruggers of all shapes and sizes rapidly streaming past is far more likely to provoke giggles or
groans than any sort of deep, primal arousal.
Frost's letter was really nothing more than the typical judgmentaf denunciation of a certain subculture's traditions based
on one's own aesthetic tastes. What's unfortunate is the fact that
the scandal-hungry media jumped so hard on Frost's letter and
made it a centerpiece of a widely distributed AP article on
debauchery in American colleges. Apparently many people
shared Frost's distaste, and were willing to throw their support
behind his arguments in an issue that had almost nothing to do
with them.
They say there's no such thing as bad press, but apparently
the EPRU (Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union) hasn't liked this
form of exposure, and has ordered that the tradition halt. The
college, despite its stated commitment to preserving college traditions and protecting student self-expression, has decided to
meekly go along with this and avoid its own bad PR.
Well, I wish them the best, even if it means the only substantive change is that the name gets switched around to a less
grammatically correct form and that everyone who knows anything about the situationloses respect for the administration. It's
just disheartening to know how easily a supposedly objective,
democratic league of athletic teams gets taken over by a few
loud, strident, prudish voices, and how quickly a supposed bastion of free speech, free thought, and social liberty caves in the
pressure of those voices once the cameras start rolling.

Young volleyball squad finishes tough season
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY DEBBIE FARRELLY

dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's volleyball team ended a
tough 2002 season this past Saturday, finishing with an
overall record of 5-21 and 1-9 in Centennial Conference
competition.
After a successful 2001 season in which the Garnet finished with a winning record (13-11) for the first time since
1994, the team brought back only three veterans to the
2002 squad, including co-captains Erika Doyle 'O3 and
Emma Benn 'O4. These returning veterans, combined
with six first-year players, three upper-class additions,
and a brand new coach made for a highly inexperienced
yet enthusiastic team.
"[The team] was awesome, especially in their relentless pursuit to excel by working as hard as they could in
every practice by hustling and demonstrating a willingness to learn the game," coach Harleigh Leach said.

The challenge of so many new players proved to be
both an obstacle and an asset for the Garnet Tide. The
season got off to a slow start as the eclectic components
of the team got to know each other and developed a
stronger sense of unity. Halfway through the season,
with a record of 2-12, Swat jumped into a two-game winning streak, with wins over St. Joseph College and

Dickinson

College.

The victory against Dickinson, the first Centennial
Conference win of the season for Swarthmore, was one of
the team's high points. After four hard-fought games,
Swat emerged with the win. Four players, Patrice Berry
'O6, Yaprak Sariisik 'O6, Tanya Gonzalez 'O6, and Benn,
ended the match with double-digit figures. Offensively,
Benn and Natalie Dunphy 'O5 combined for 26 kills, while
setter Emily "E-Con" Conlon 'O6 contributed 37 assists.
"Most important was the desire in our team to go for
every ball every player on the court hit the floor first
before any ball. We were outsized in height, but not in
-

heart or aggressiveness," Leach said.
Team members learned to appreciate their own
improvements, even if they did not always result in a
notch in the win column. In a loss to Haverford College,
the Garnet displayed one of their best all-around efforts of
the season. "A huge achievement for us in this match was
the fact that we achieved one of our team goals for the
season in regards to serving. We were perfect on first
service opportunities, meaning we served every first
serve in after every side out," Leach said. Despite the
loss, the Garnet Tide made Haverford truly earn the win.
The squad will lose two seniors, Erika Doyle and
Elizabeth Nolte, to graduation this spring. However, the
hard work to alleviate the team's growing pains this season will certainly carry over to what promises to be a
strong and unified 2003 volleyball team.
"We have such a young team and a strong commitment
to training and playing volleyball," Leach said. "I am
excited and hopeful for the future of this program."

Young places third at CC championships
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

Looking for the athletic equivalent to those infamous

Swarthmore students who devote all of their waking hours
to study? Try cross-country runners. "We're the most hardcore team on campus," Sara Kate Selling 'O3 declared. "Our

sport is your sport's punishment."
After two months of grueling training, including weekly
11-mile runs at 8:30 in the morning, gratification finally
arrived last Saturday for Maria-Elena Young 'O4 and her
cross-country team at the Centennial Conference
Championships. Young placed third and Swarthmore placed
fourth in a field of 10 teams.
Rigorous training paid off for the Swarthmore runners,

as hilly and muddy course conditions prevailed at Ursinus
College. "It was definitely the most challenging course
we've run on all year," Young said. "It physically and mentally challenged all of the runners on all of the teams."
Swarthmore, however, was well prepared for the event.
The mud was barely an afterthought for most of the
Swarthmore runners because earlier in the semester, the
team competed in much worse conditions on several occasions. "We're the one sport that never cancels [due to
weather conditions]. Our race at Seven Sisters earlier in
the semester was in the low 50s and in pouring rain,"
Selling said.
As for the challenging terrain, the runners stuck to their
simple yet effective strategy. "Our racing strategy was to
pace ourselves in the beginning," Young said.
By maintaining her pace, Young was able to distance
herself from a pack of 10 runners early in the race and
keep pace with the top three runners in the conference at
the end of the race. Young beat out Ursinus' top runner,
Katie Dougherty, on her home turf and finished behind
only Dickinson's Callie Bradley and Haverford's Sarah
LaMoy. "There was definitely a sort of competition
[among the top runners in the conference]" Young said.

"When I was out there running, I was going after people I
knew."
Unlike many of its Swarthmore counterparts, the team
does have a post-season to look forward to. In two weeks,
Young will travel with the top six runners on the Garnet
Tide squad to Salisbury College in Maryland to compete in
the Division 111 Mid-East Regional Tournament. If the Tide
finish first or second, they will automatically qualify for a
national bid at the NCAA championships.
"Regionals determines who goes to nationals," Selling
said. "There will be several strong teams competing at
Salisbury. Dickinson is nationally ranked, and both
Moravian and Haverford are very strong teams."
Although it is unlikely the Tide will qualify for a national bid, Young does have a chance to qualify for an individ-

ual bid. "Maria, our top runner, has a very good chance of
qualifying," Selling said.
According to Young, the team's coaches have her and the
rest of the runners well prepared for this culminating event.
"The coaches have it down to a science," Young said. After
beginning the season with strenuous practices, the coaches
backed off the intensity of practices in the past few weeks to
keep runners fresh for the conference championships and
regionals. "By the time of the big race, your body is in great

shape," Young said.
Besides training on Mondays through Fridays and competing at meets on Saturdays, the team participates in a
weekly run on Sunday called "Money in the Bank." In order
to build their endurance, the Tide travel to Valley Green in
Fairmount Park and run for 11 miles at 8 a.m. '"Money in
the Bank day' makes a big difference at the end of the season," Selling said.
Perhaps more important than the physical endurance,
though, is the mental endurance required to train seven

days a week, compete in weekly six-kilometer races, run
through pain and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
"We take very good care of our bodies. We're very cautious about sleep, eating, and we support each other,"
Selling said. "It takes a certain kind of personality to be a
cross country runner. It's like a lifestyle."
For most runners, it means not only building their
schedules around their running, but also competing
through numerous painful and nagging injures. "Everyone
at different points of the season is injured. It takes so much
mental ability to go out and run when you know you're
going to hurt. It's the most challenging part of the sport,"
Young said.
So why do cross-country

runners exist? "Running gives

you an amazing feeling of being in touch with your body.
You can really see how your mental state connects with
your physical state," Young said.
"It's a bit masochistic too," Young added.
Yeah, duh.

Reynolds, Makin lead injury-plagued men's squad
Seeing the men's cross country team before the
Centennial Conference Championships, you would have
thought they had been stricken by an epidemic. Injuries
slowed Garrett Ash 'O5, tortured Lang Reynolds 'O5,
and flat-out prevented James Golden 'O5 from competing in the chamionships. But somehow, the squad managed to bite the bullet, finishing fifth at the Centennial
Conference showdown.
"People don't think of cross-country as an injuryridden sport," captain Joe Makin 'O3 said. "But it definitely is."
The Garnet were paced by Reynolds, who, in spite of
his strained adductor muscle, finished tenth at the tournament with a time of 28:13.91 "I've only been able to
train in two week blocks during the semester," he said.
"I ended up feeling terrible throughout the race. But
somehow I was able to sustain myself with my summer
training."

Though Reynolds' tenth-place finish was tops on the
Swarthmore squad, he still felt he could have done better. "I definitely can be top five," he said. "It was actually disappointing."
Considering the rash of injuries, Makin was pleased
with the team's performance. "One of our top guys was
out, and Lang has been battling injuries all year. He's
been doing 35-mile weeks, not 70-mile weeks. So, considering that, it was good," Makin said.

Makin was the second-best finisher for the Garnet,

taking 17th place at the championships, which were
held at Ursinus. Poor field conditions made the already
difficult course even harder. "It was a really tough
course, very hilly," Reynolds said. "My strategy on those
types of courses is to go out slower than normal and
just try to hold on."
And the conditions made Reynolds and the rest of
the leaders start out even slower than usual. "The
whole race came out very slow," Reynolds said. "The
first mile came in at about 5:30 as opposed to 5:00

or 5:15."
Newcomers Adam Hunt 'O6, Jones Nauseef 'O6, and
Keefe Keeley 'O6 rounded out the top five for the
Garnet Tide, and Makin could only sing the praises of
the trio. "Keefe, in particular, had a spectacular race,"
Makin said. "Adam's going to be a real stud in a few
years. Actually, in three years, when they're seniors,
they'll all be pretty great."
On Nov. 16, the team will travel to Salisbury, Md., to
compete in the NCAA Division 111 Mid-East Regional
Tournament. According to Reynolds, everyone on the
squad should be healthy enough to run by then.
Reynolds himself has a good shot at qualifying for
nationals at the tournament; he finished 18th at regionals last year, failing to qualify by only two places.

Skateboarding: Ollies, piercings and 14-year-olds
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

rburstel@swarthmore.edu
My kid brother Will, age 14, likes to read a skateboarding magazine called "Thrasher." I'm not making this name
up. From what I can gather, this publication mainly consists of pictures of individuals who like to raise their middle fingers for the camera. Interviews involve questions
like, "Who gets you stoked on skating?" Interviewees use
words like "sick," "totally" and "dude." As in, "Dude, I was
like so totally represent, it was sick." For the layman, this
can be translated to, "Nananananana, you can't catch me!
Ha!" Will assures me that the use of such language is
designed to "mock mainstream culture."
Discussion with these interviewed skaters generally centers around tricks called kick-flips, ollies and front-side-feebles. For those of you who aren't familiar with the skating
lingo, the Oxford Dictionary defines an ollie, the most basic
skating trick, as "bad knees later in life." Will, who on command can generate a list of curbs around town on which he
can practice this feat, calls it "an art form." In fact, according to Will, skateboarding in general is "an art form."
they're in
"It's alternative," he shrugs. "All the skaters

it for the love."
Surprisingly, "the love" often coincides with shoe contracts. Will does not see a conflict in this arrangement. He
admits that some skateboarders exhibit completely outrageous behavior. Tony Hawk, for instance. "You can't give

22

the general public Tony Hawk all the time," Will says. "He
has his own shoe company. It's a core skateboard shoe company, too. I mean, come on, can you say 'sell-out?'" This is
unfortunate for me, since Tony Hawk is the only skateboarder whose name I know. Note to self: Find the name of
another skateboarder to casually drop into conversation
with brother. Pretend that you know something.
There is a lot to know, though. "You have to be really
smart to skateboard," Will says. "You really have to know

what you're doing." Luckily for me, cataloging information
about skateboarders doesn't require the same aptitude as
actually skateboarding. Will offers me some pointers. "Ali
Boulala. He's punk. He's Arabic, and he's Swedish." Um, is
punk a nationality? "Nutting yourself. That's when you sustain injury to the groin area," he adds. Uh yeah, enough
said. "And you have to write about Rodney Mullan. He has
a master's degree in mechanical engineering."
But it doesn't end there, folks. One need only take a
look at the closets of 14 year-old boys to figure that out.
(Okay, okay you'd rather not. Just take my word for it.)
Cost of skateboarding pants: $6O. Cost of skateboarding Tshirt: $2O. Cost of easily worn-out skateboarding shoes: $75.
Cost of free advertising for merchandise companies:
Priceless. (Cost of ripping off MasterCard commercials for
a reporter trying to fill her word quota: Beyond Priceless.)
But you get my point. Flip, Girl, Baker, Anti-hero,
Krooked, and my personal favorite, the Cummings-esque
eS hell, they're so alternative you might even be able to

November 7, 2002

forgive the occasional irregular spelling. When the name's
displayed across the chest of a kid who's shelled out 40
bucks for the privilege, it really does read like art.
Museum quality, in fact.
But I digress. This is the sports section, after all, and no
doubt you want to hear something about electrifying dismounts and death-defying leaps. Or maybe you just want to
read about blood. According to a newly released medical
study, the average 14-year-old boy loses half the weight of
his daily food intake in blood spilt at skateboard parks.
Now we can move on to more pertinent issues, like,
say, body piercings. Will claims that "cops stereotype people who skateboard as people who have piercings."
Because it is illegal for 14-year-old boys who skateboard to
get piercings in any state but Idaho, Will is devoid of gaping holes. (If you've heard of any alterations to the law,
please don't pass it on to a certain sibling of mine.)
Yet, according to Thrasher Magazine, the supreme
authority on anything and everything alternative and artful, Will is hardly representative. Skaters must have a
prominent nose piercing (preferably of the interlocking
nostril variety), a sufficiently tacky tattoo (with a sponsor's name permanently etched into the skin), and a swagger commensurate with what I've affectionately termed
"thigh-hugger" pants.
You know the type. You know the look. You know the
moves. Come on, dude. Let's go skate. That'd be totally
sick, man. Now that's art.

NBA preview: CWebb,
Jay, Jason and Yao
Last week's article found our fair journalist sifting through the many
teams that make up the NBA, sorting contenders from pretenders, debating
off-season moves, and making many predictions that probably will not be
fulfilled. However, the apparent futility of an NBA preview article shall not
persuade said fair journalist from continuing to make bold predictions, bad
jokes and an ass of himself. This week, the predictions will turn to the individuals who make the NBA go 'round: the players.
It seems natural that a segment of this preview be focused on players
instead of teams. First, the NBA revolutionized sports marketing by promoting marquee player match-ups rather
than simply focusing on team battles. This
move is arguably the second greatest rea-

son for the emergence of pro basketball as
a major sport, trailing only the existence of
Bird, Magic and Jordan. Second, the NBA
has a glut of young talent. This is the renaissance of the pro game, as the league has
been flooded with more young and exciting
players. A great portion of these talented
youngsters have something to prove, too.

In short, if you were ever going to tune into
the league, this is the season. I shall now
explain my predictions in further detail,
using the same format as last week's arti-

Chelsea Ferrell makes a move for the ball during Tuesday's season-ending loss to Haverford.

Door closes on field hockey
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu
The Garnet Tide finished the season on
with a heartbreaking 2-1 loss to
Haverford. It was a tough week for the Tide, as
they lost three critical conference matches to fall
out of playoff contention in the Centennial

Tuesday

Conference.
The team, who was playing without key players
Ingrid Kaszas 'O3 and Katherine Athanasiades 'O5
for much of the second half of the season, refuse to
make any excuses for their disappointing finish.
Instead, the coaches and players are proud of the
team's character and development throughout the
season. "Every single player improved. Out of 20
goals the team set, we made 19 of them," assistant
coach Maureen Vernon 'Ol said, suggesting that
the team's only shortcoming was its failure to
make the Centennial Conference playoffs.
"What's most impressive, even though we lost
our lastfour games, is that our team kept perspective of goals beyond winning and losing, and came
to realize the importance of character," first-year
head coach Kelly Wilcox '97 said. "We were always
respectful, classy and poised despite playing
unsportsmanlike teams,"
Many fans, players, and coaches wonder about
the team's failure to make the playoffs. After
years of dominance in the Centennial Conference,
including an NCAA playoff appearance in 1996, the
team had one of its most disappointing seasons in
years. According to coaches, the team's record is
not due to a lack of talent. "We beat two of the
teams in the playoffs," Wilcox said.

So what was Swat's problem this season? Why
couldn't they get themselves over the hump?
According to Wilcox, one possible reason could be
Swarthmore students' attitude. "[As coaches],
we're focusing on giving players confidence.
Swarthmore players have the skill, and we need to
back it up with attitude," Wilcox said.
"There are times when confidence shows
through, but it needs to be uniform. You need to
believe in yourself and the person you're passing
to," she added.
Certainly, the academic rigor at Swarthmore
factors into the equation as well. "Don't underestimate the difficulty of focusing at Swarthmore, but
I don't want to use that as an excuse," Wilcox said.
Don't get Wilcox wrong. Despite a 7-11 overall
record, and a 3-6 record in the Centennial
Conference, she wouldn't trade her first head
coaching experience for anything. "It was just an
amazing experience," she said. "I wouldn't trade it
for any game, any player or any coach. I wouldn't
trade it for anything, not even a playoff spot."
One ofher greatest joys was to be able to work
with the seniors, who leave behind the
Swarthmore field hockey legacy. Epitomized by
Kaszas' return to the playing field in the final
game of the season after being out for almost the
entire season due to injury, the seniors, more than
anything, are a testament to the team's heart, dedication and unity. The underclassmen will have
big shoes to fill in the upcoming years, when they
have to replace graduating players like Kaszas,
Kasia Koziol-Dube, Katie Cloonan, Kate NelsonLee, Heather Doyle, Lindsay VanSciver and Jenn
Hart.

Swimming falls to NYU in season opener
The Swarthmore

men's and women's swim

teams opened up their season with a road trip to

the Violets of NYU last weekend. The traditional opening meet "didn't go as well as we had
hoped," Tara Trout 'O4 said. The women lost 14560, while the men were just edged 111-94.
Outpaced by the rested Violet women, the
Garnet finished no higher than second in any
event. Distance swimmer Katherine Reid 'O5
brought home 8 total points with her second in
the 1000-yard freestyle and in the 500 free. The
women's side of events also saw Violet rookie
Erika Norris break a 14 year old NYU record in
the 200 butterfly, finishing first in 2:10.34, an

NCAA "B" cut.
The Garnet men were paced by veteran
triple-winners David Whitehead 'O3 and Mike
Dudley 'O3. Whitehead won the 200 free (1:48.39)
and the 100 free (4911), while Dudley had a winning time of 2:03.2 in the 200 Individual Medley
and 2:18.93. Ben Morgan 'O5 took home the 200
backstroke in 2:08.77. The other Garnet win was
in the 400-medley relay, with Whitehead and
Dudley joining Mike Auerbach 'O5 and John
Lillvis 'O3.
Events of both teams' home opener against
cross-town rival Widener start at 2 p.m. this
Saturday, Nov. 9.

cle (I'm not that creative).
"Who has to put up or shut up?"
It is the time of reckoning for many a
Riding the Pine
young star. One need only look at power
forwards in the Western Conference to see
a wealth of talent that have achieved next
to nothing, though. Specifically, Kevin Garnett and Chris Webber must
show that they can carry a team to the next level or forever jeopardize their
status as superstars.
The problem is more dire for Garnett, who, despite being the highestpaid player in the NBA, has never led his T-Wolves past the first round of
the playoffs. The press has eaten KG alive, stating that he is not worth the
money, that he cannot produce in crunch time and that he simply does not
have the heart. This is a crucial season for him, but his team lacks the firepower to advance in the stacked West. It seems as though Garnett is destined to be an also-ran for the duration of his career.
Webber has accomplished more with his team than Garnett has with his,
but Webber is also playing on the most talented team in basketball. Though
his team made the conference finals last year, Webber disappeared often in
the fourth quarter and always with the game on the line. The entireLakers
series was an exhibition of Webber's absolute refusal to take clutch shots.
"Which team's point guards could lead them to the playoffs or let
them fall by the wayside?"
There are three that come to mind right offhand. The first may have the
most difficult task and the greatest expectations. Andre Miller comes to the
Clippers as the reigning NBA assists leader
and without any record of
winning. He arrives in L.A. with an ultra-talented, ultra-young team, who
at times last year looked as though they would much rather be playing NBA
Live than NBA in real life. If he cannot deliver, watch as Donald Sterling
dismantles the team and continues the running joke we call the Clips.
The artist formerly known Jason Williams and delinquent still known as
Jason Williams are the other two points with a full plate. The Bulls have
barely a shot at the playoffs and are simply building for the future. But Jay
Williams needs to step in as a rookie and lead this franchise. The Bulls may
be young, but this is a big year. Jay needs to give direction and lead the way.
Jason Williams of Memphis, on the other hand, is surrounded by young
talent that could actually make a run. Of course, I am willing to bet that they
will not. Simple reason: Williams is clueless as to how to win. He's not a
leader, makes stupid decisions, shoots a bad percentage and once in a while
does something to show up on Sportscenter. The only hope the Grizzlies
have is to confiscate his paraphernalia and hope that he grows up.
"Who will have a breakout season?"
My first two selections are no-brainers. Jason Richardson and Richard
Jefferson are going to explode. Richardson has been putting up crazy num-

bers in Oaktown, and Jefferson is JasonKidd's new favorite running buddy.
Also, there are two rookies in Memphis who are set to blow up. Gordan
Giricek and Drew Gooden are the real deal. Athletic and big, Gooden will
get the starting spot in just a few weeks.Look for consistent double-doubles.
Meanwhile, Giricek looks like the second coming of Peja.
Finally, I promised that I would announce the worst player in the NBA.
I did this mostly as a ploy to draw in readers. I am desperate for attention.
However, anyone who caught the Houston opener witnessed the same thing
that I did. Yao Ming looked terrible! He was, for that night, the worst player
in the NBA. Do not get me wrong; I think that he will eventually be fine, but
this is going to be a long process. The kid has no idea what the NBA is about,
as seen by him getting taken to the hole by 6'2" guards. The next Rik Smits?
Probably. The next Shaq? Please.

There is one date circled on every Garnet soccer player's calendar each season. There is one game on the schedule that holds more clout than all the other games combined. Of course it would be nice to have a winning season,
to be a title contender. It would be great to knock off a
nationally-ranked powerhouse such as Johns Hopkins or
Gettysburg. But there's something about that final
Centennial Conference game against those pesky Fords
that undoubtedly separates it from the rest.
In the 80th meeting between the nation's two oldest continuous intercollegiate rivals, the Garnet Tide men's soccer team squared off with their arch nemesis Haverford.
The Garnet battled the Fords tirelessly, keeping the
game tied going into halftime. The Tide's 4-5-1 formation
was able to keep Haverford's offense in check until
Haverford forward Terry Kegel scored the game's only
goal in the 67th minute. His score came from the top of the
box after the Tide's defense failed to clear the ball.
Swarthmore keeper Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 recorded 7
saves in the net, allowing only 1 goal out of 14 shots.
Although Haverford outshot the Tide 14-4, the Garnet
had a number of second half opportunities to at least tie
the game up at one. Swarthmore came close to scoring
when Nick Graham 'O6 led teammate Scott Long 'O6 with a
breakaway pass that was then fired off the crossbar midway through the second half. A number of other shots were
cleared by the defense or fired past the net. The near miss-

tinued the pattern of misfortune suffered by the Tide.
Season scoring leader Charlie Taylor 'O6 commented on
the missed opportunities, "We were unlucky not to tie the
game up. Scott Long ['o6] hit the crossbar, and a few others
had great chances," he said. "There was so much emotion
out on the field. The seniors gave it everything they had,
along with the rest of the team. We were very evenly
matched, but I'm sure we'll take them next year."
Nick Graham put the game into perspective. "The
Haverford game was a tough loss," he said. "Although I
didn't think we were the better team of the day, I didn't feel
they deserved to win, but maybe that's just because they

are our archrivals."
The Garnet Tide finished their season against the reign-

ing NCAA Division 111 national champions, Richard

Stockton College in New Jersey. Stockton, ranked No. 13 in
the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of
America, defeated the Tide 3-1 in the season finale. The
Ospreys scored at 11:57 off of a John Epley penalty kick
conversion. Jamie Nelson headed a cross at 42:41 to put
Stockton up 2-0, and Mike Harner scored the Ospreys third
and final goal in the 51st minute.
Five minutes later, senior Goreleigh Willis scored his
first career goal in his final collegiate match for the Garnet
Tide. The senior forward scored the Tide's lone goal when
he cut by two Osprey defenders and fired a shot off of a
Nick Graham 'O6 lead pass early in the second half. Nate
Shupe 'O5 made six saves in the net as Richard Stockton
CoUege out shot the Tide 17-4.

"To finish our season against Richard Stockton was

exciting," Graham said. "We did well against the reigning
national champions and the fact that we were able to score
against them was uplifting as putting the ball in the back
of the net has been one of our main issues this season. If
anything I think the game made us realize what our standard level of play and performance should be, and that if
we are able to consistently play at the level we exemplified
against Stockton,

The Garnet Tide finished the season with a record of
5-14-1 overall and 0-9 in Centennial Conference play.
After jumping out to a 3-1 start, its best since 1993, the
Tide lost a number of heartbreakers that could have
been won. Although their record might indicate otherwise, the Tide improved significantly this season under
new head coach Eric Wagner, especially in the final
games of the season, as they were able to hang with
national powerhouses Gettysburg and Richard Stockton
College. Unfortunately, inconsistent scoring and defensive lapses cost the Garnet winnable games. A talented
but young squad, the Tide will look to rebound next
year with one of the deepest teams in the conference.
"Our record doesn't show how much we improved
over the course of the season," Taylor said. We have
learned important lessons about what to expect from
ourselves and each other and that every team is beatable. We will definitely be the hottest team on campus
next year."
