Suspect in

recent thefts
apprehended
Still no suspects in
thefts of DVD players
from Kohlberg
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu

A string of backpack thefts ended
Monday, Nov. 25 with the arrest of an indi-

vidual fitting the description of the thief,
after a student tipped off Public Safety.

The suspect, Brian Hensel, 19, has been
with trespassing. Hensel is
believed to have taken the backpacks of
nearly a dozen Swarthmore students.
Many of the bags were found later with all
valuables removed. It is not clear whether
he is responsible for any of the other, thefts
reported on campus in the last few weeks,
such as the theft of five new DVD players
charged

from Kohlberg classrooms.
The suspect was apprehended by Public
Safety with the help of a tip from Jeff Rogg

David Horowitz, former Communist and member of the Black Panther Party, said Tuesday night in the Swarthmore Friends
Meeting House that the leftist bias in American colleges and universities leaves students with a one-sided education.

Horowitz criticizes 'leftist' academia
and urges pro-America sentiment
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@Swarthmore.edu
David Horowitz was introduced to a packed Swarthmore
Friends Meeting House Tuesday night by Randy Goldstein 'O5 as
"the son of card-carrying members of the Communist party," a
man formerly affiliated with the Black Panther Party and the
New Left, but now owner and head writer of the far-right Web
site Front Page Magazine.
The College Republicans' decision to bring a conservative
known for his incendiary comments and views to Swarthmore
caused heated debate weeks before he arrived.
In response to a pro-war speaker using the Friends Meeting
House, Sarah Wood 'O4 handed out literature on the Quaker tradition of pacifism.
Horowitz began his speech by questioning the education
received at liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore. He described
the college as "part of the academic culture in this country which
is intellectually repressive and retrograde," saying that it teaches only the left's perspective.
"You can't get a good education if they're only telling you half
the story," he said. He questioned the value of any education that
does not provide the opportunity to test one's ideals against an
opposing viewpoints and arguments.
Horowitz said he "spent 25 years on the left" and "knows the
feeling of self-righteousness" that many leftists feel.
During the question-and-answer period, Emiliano Rodriguez

THE PHOENIX

'O5 pointed out that the school might not be as closed-minded as
Horowitz suggested, using Horowitz's invitation to speak here as
an example.
Kent Qian 'O3 sympathized with Horowitz's evaluation that
the college fails to present conservative perspectives. He said a
lot of people here "fall into the trap" of ignoring other perspective. "I read a lot of conservative magazines so that supplements

my education here," he said.
After his preface on the leftist bias in higher education,
Horowitz went on to cover issues ranging from inner-city schools
and welfare to the conflict in the Middle East and American foreign policy.

Addressing America's domestic situation, Horowitz said,
"There is no reason to be poor in America. There are no bars to
opportunity here." He expressed his frustration that the
Democrats control and protect policies which he believes keep
inner city schools and welfare from succeeding.
Horowitz was disgusted by the idea that students "are systematically being exposed to the idea that your country is something to be ashamed of," calling America "God's country."
He supported his view of America's moral superiority by citing instances where American troops have "saved" people in
other countries, particularly Islamic nations such as
Afghanistan and Somalia. He added that the world "votes with its
feet," pointing to the large number of immigrants who have come

backpack thief, which said the suspect had
a large Chinese character tattoo on his
neck. While talking with a staff person in
Sharpies, Rogg observed a person who, he
said, "kind-of glazed by." When Rogg saw a
tattoo on the neck of the man he was watching, he concluded that he had found the
suspect. "I saw him sneak off into one of
the rooms in Sharpies," Rogg said. He
immediately called Public Safety, and
Sergeant Brian Harris arrived in time to
arrest the suspect in front of Sharpies.
Hensel is 19 years old and has no known
residence. Police believe he has local roots.
His arraignment was scheduled for
Monday, Dec. 2, but was postponed because

no officer was available. He is currently

being housed in the Delaware County
Prison.
Before his arrest, Hensel was also wanted for questioning regarding shoplifting in
Collingdale, thefts at the SwarthmoreRutledge School and a variety of small burglaries and thefts in Swarthmore, Morton
and Springfield Township.
According to Brian Craig, Swarthmore
Borough Police Chief, Hensel has not yet
been definitively connected with any offcampus crimes, but police are preparing a
photo array to show to witnesses to determine if he may be a suspect in other thefts.
Swarthmore has taken steps to deter the
suspect from returning to campus. Public
Safety Director Owen Redgrave said the
college gave Hensel a letter formally forbidding him to return to campus property.
This means that if he were seen on campus
again, he could be arrested.
A number of other thefts have been
reported on campus in the last few weeks.
A motor scooter was taken from between
Dana and Hallowell and a laptop was taken
from a Willets dorm room as well as an
iPod computer. "They could be related, but
really only by date," Public Safety Director

New sushi bar, classroom and labs
open in science center next semester
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY

kduongll@swarthmore.edu

Students expecting better lab space and more modern
classrooms when parts of the science center open next
semester will find (in addition) something perhaps unexpected: Swarthmore's first sushi bar.
Sections of the new science center will open the first
day of classes next semester, as well as the day after spring
break. Both "phases" involve the opening of rooms in the
Cornell addition, the section that is located near the front
entrance of the Cornell Science library.
During the Phase I opening on January 20, an introductory biology lab that replaces Lab 101 in Martin will
open, along with a lab technician office and preparatory
room. The lab will have new projection equipment, safety
stations (which will be standard throughout the building),
and an improved ventilation system and movable tables.
The main entrance to Cornell will reopen, allowing students easier access to the building. Also, new restrooms on
the bottom floor of the Cornell addition will be unveiled.
it uses
"The design of the building is imaginative
beautiful materials and I'm very proud of the degree to
which environmental concerns have been addressed," said
biology professor Rachel Merz, co-chair of the planning
committee for the construction of the new science center.
After the Phase II opening on March 17, the first floor
"commons" of the Cornell addition will be available to students and faculty. The commons will be a two-story shared
public space with large, V-shaped glass walls. Even a new

4

sort of lab will be open for student use: the "beverage lab."
Similar to the Kohlberg coffee bar in its operation, the
"lab" will accept meal-plan points. There will, however, be
differences in the menu. Sushi will be served as well as
various types of cold drinks and fountain sodas. There will
also be large tables in the commons area to facilitate group
study sessions.

"The science faculty has been very
involved, more than I have seen any
faculty involved in a building project."
Vice President of Administration
Larry Schall 75
A new elevator serving the three levels of the Cornell
addition will also be running by March 17, after spring break.
New physics research labs will be open on the lower level of
the new structure. A 30-seat classroom open for use by all
departments will also open, along with the new 200-seat lecture hall, which will replace Kirby Lecture Hall in Martin,
scheduled for demolition after Alumni Weekend in June.
Project manager Janet Semler reported that the construction is not only on schedule but progressing better
than expected. Noise, one of the most feared problems, has
been minimal. Commenting on other problems, Semler

said, "There are inconveniences
but we knew that going in."
Semler also attributes the successes of the project to the
relatively dry summer. Since all of the construction during
the winter months will take place inside the new structures, she does not foresee any delays due to inclement
winter weather.
"The science faculty have been very involved, more
than I have seen any faculty involved in a building project," said Larry Schall '75, vice-president for administration and one of the co-chairs of the planning committee for
the project. Schall has worked on the project since it started in 1998. He noted that the science center project is four
times bigger than any other project that the college has
undertaken.
Merz, who will teach a lab section of Biology 2 in the
new biology laboratory, is one faculty member who has
been heavily involved in the project. "The science departments have done a great job of staying engaged with the
project so that their needs and ideas are reflected in the
building," she said. Merz represents the interests of the scientists on the planning committee and has also been taking
groups of students on tours of the construction site. She has
been forced to offer "overflow" tours because so many students have expressed an interest in the new building.
"I think people are going to enjoy being in this building
and that it will serve the sciences well for decades," Merz
said. "I'm very happy that the college has recognized that
it needed to make this fundamental investment that will
benefit about one-third of the college's curriculum."

CIVIC faces change
after losing power
to fund groups
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

A month after the Student Budget Committee (SBC)
took over Cooperative Involvement of Volunteers in
Community (CIVIC)'s responsibility for funding stu-

dent community service groups, the community service organization itself is still in the process of redefining its purpose after being relieved of what was once its

most important responsibility.
"We're actually very glad because budgeting was
taking up so much of our time," said Kai Xu 'O3, a CIVIC

co-coordinator.
According to CIVIC co-coordinator Seeta Sistla 'O4,
the group has known that a change of this nature has
been on the horizon "for about a year," but the effects of
the changes that were eventually decided on are still
unclear. SBC will now directly fund the dozen community service organizations once funded by CIVIC and
will also be responsible for providing transportation for
groups involved in off-campus projects. CIVIC will continue to fund individual students who are involved in
off-campus community service projects.
The change came in response to SBC's call for CIVIC
to make its budgetary process more "transparent,"
Sistla said. On November 24, SBC allotted funds for
each of the 12 community service groups; Sistla
believes the groups were treated fairly. At the very
least, she said, she hasn't heard any complaints. "I
think the CIVIC groups will be fine," she added. She
said, however, that she is still "really not sure" what the
long term effects will be.

Sistla explained that CIVIC will be looking for new

ways to inspire "a spirit of community service" she
"quenched on the campus in the last
few years compared to what its been in the past."

believes has been

"The whole purpose of community
service is to help people that actually need to be helped."
Gregory Lok 'O4
Currently CIVIC is trying to collect a library of children's books which will be made available to students
who volunteer in local schools. Eight of the 12 community service groups formerly funded by CIVIC are tutoring or mentoring programs. Xu said the library will provide these programs with a means of sharing resources.
Xu said that CIVIC is also planning several campuswide community service projects including a project in
Chester on Martin Luther King Day.
He is concerned, however, that CIVIC's budget for
funding individual students' off-campus service projects will be phased out sometime next semester and
won't be available for students next year. This means
that next year, individual students who now volunteer
with groups serving AIDS patients, battered women
and recent immigrants may be paying their SEPTA
fares out of their own pockets.
SBC's budget is drawn from the Student Activities
Fund, and the committee is opposed to paying for activities less directly related to campus life. But Xu believes
that these individuals are doing a "perfectly valid form
of service" and that their efforts should be supported
financially.
Greg Lok 'O4 agrees. Lok is the co-coordinator of two
of the groups who recently began being funded by SBC.
"The whole purpose of community service is to help
people that actually need to be helped," he said. CIVIC,
he said, had "more of an understanding" of the needs of
the community service groups on campus; he is worried that SBC will be overly "scrutinizing."
Earlier this year, Lok, a Phi Psi brother, organized a
joint venture fund raiser with CIVIC and his fraternity.
He hopes that the money raised might be used to create
an endowment that will help fund CIVIC in the future.

Seth Sanders said lesbians were in general better educated than gay men in the United States economy.

Economist probes difficulties
of studying queers in America
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Gathering reliable data about the
socio-economic status of gays and lesbians in the U.S. is far from easy, but
according to researcher Seth Sanders,
meaningful data can be gleaned from

large resources through careful and
creative methods.
Tuesday evening, in a visit sponsored by the economics department,
Sanders, an associate professor at the
University of Maryland specializing
in labor, economics and demography,
discussed his work in a lecture titled
"Research on Gays and Lesbians in
the U.S: Data Sources, Data
Challenges and a Few Findings."
Addressing an audience comprised
mostly of professors and Econ 1 students, Sanders opened his talk by not-

ing that the most important thing to
gain from his talk is the idea that
"econ is just so darn fun."
"Economics is the greatest subject
area because it applies to topics of
everyday life," he continued. "It
serves a really important purpose in

learning about the world."
Sanders offered two reasons for studying gays and lesbians in the United
States. He noted first that "there is an
enormous public policy debate going on"

regarding gay and lesbian civil rights

and whether same-sex domestic partners
are entitled to the domestic and legal benefits of married heterosexual couples.
For his second reason, Sanders
remarked, "As an economist, I am
interested in more general issues
such as why women stay at home in
many societies while men work outside of the home." He believes that the
study of gays and lesbians in the U.S.
may reflect upon these more general
issues and perhaps yield answers to
these questions.
It is hard to obtain data about homo-

December 5, 2002

sexuals in the U.S. because "gays and
lesbians form only a very small fraction
of the population," Sanders said. Thus,
one needs to sample a large population
in order to gain solid data regarding the
homosexual population, and research
can become extremely expensive.
Traditionally, the data used for
this type ofresearch is gathered from
populations known as "convenience
samples." These sources include
responses solicited from readers of
particular gay magazines or newspapers, as well as frequenters of specialinterest Internet sites or gay bars.
But, as Sanders observed, data gathered from these convenience samples
have many drawbacks. "They sample
a special group, not the general population," he said, "and they rarely sample heterosexuals for comparison."
Much of the data used in Sanders'
talk was gleaned from large, systematic data sources such as the U.S. census
to avoid the pitfalls that may come

with using data from convenience
still difficult to
answer basic questions like, "What
percentage of the U.S. population is
homosexual?" As Sanders showed, the
definition of homosexuality can vary
based on the time periods defined by
the survey questions. He noted,
"Sexuality is fluid over one's life
samples. Even so, it is

course" and that "if you let people
have more time, they are more likely
to [have had sex with a same-sex partner]." In fact, his data showed that
"women have more fluidity than
men," meaning that they're more likely to change their preference in the
genders of their partners.
Sanders' findings also revealed
that gay people are often better educated than their heterosexual counterparts. He discussed the possibility
that "maybe only people who could
tell you that they're gay are the ones
with college degrees the others may

not feel that they could stand the discrimination." By looking at the educational history of the subjects' fathers,
however, Sanders and his colleagues
found that "gay men start life with the
same educational background as
other men and they become more educated through life."

He said that another interesting
finding is that, controlling for skills,

gay men earn less than other men
while lesbians earn more than other
women. Furthermore, as Sanders
noted, "lesbians are in many occupations that are traditionally male and
offer greater incomes." While Sanders
noted that the reasons behind this are
controversial and subtle, he could not
help commenting that "[lesbians] go
to college and choose these majors
and careers because [they] know that
[they] are not going to be supported
by a man. Gay men do exactly the
opposite
they know they're going to
be supported by a man."
This disparity extends into the military, where a greater percentage of

lesbians have served than of women
in general. In contrast, "gay men currently serve at about half the rate of
other men." Historically, however, the
rates of service for gay and heterosexual men were about even up until the
Vietnam War. To explain the high rate
of lesbians in service, Sanders noted,
"If you were married or pregnant you
can't go to war, so there is a higher
percentage of lesbians in World War II
and Korea
in a way, lesbians were
exempt from some forms of discrimiespecially for married
nation,

women."

The talk was based on three of 11
papers Sanders has written with his
colleagues on the subject of gays and
lesbians in America. In addition, he

has also conducted research on eco-

nomic issues surrounding Asians and
teenage parents in America.

New officers Jon'Fombonne (top center) and Andrew Gisselquist (top right) attended their first Student Council meeting Monday, as council also said goodbye to departing officers.

lot to show for it at this point," Budish said.
The council did attain an official process through the
President's Office for appealing the lack of student represen-

Newly elected Student Council officers got a glimpse of
some of the negative effects of spending two semesters on
the council when they attended their first meeting this

tation on particular college committees. This came about
through conversations with President Al Bloom, Vice

Monday night.

The last order of business for outgoing officers was to
vote on a bylaw written by Co-President Ryan Budish 'O4.
The bylaw gives the council the power to decide if less than
two weeks is a sufficient amount of time to hold a special
election. The outgoing officers hurriedly voted; many of
them more interested in finally getting to leave than in
whether the bylaw was passed. Some impatient officers
became quite vocal, none so much as Ed Stehlik 'O5. After
Budish explained the bylaw, Stehlik was finally overcome by
frustration. "Who cares? Do we need a bylaw that says

that?!" he exclaimed.

The outgoing officers thenleft, which allowed Budish to

regain order and officially welcome the new officers to the
council. There are four new officers: Student Events

Advisor Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, Secretary/Treasurer

Andrew Gisselquist 'O5, Campus Life Representative Jon
Fombonne 'O5 and Campus Relations Representative Mark
Hanis 'O4. They are taking over for Carmen Barron 'O5,
Anna Morgan 'O4, Stehlik and Marielena Velez 'O4, respectively. Co-President Matt Rubin 'O3 is also departing, and

President Maurice Eldridge and other senior administrators.
In addition, following its desire to change the way in
which the college's ongoing investigation into implementing a living wage was being handled, the council appointed new members to to the Ad Hoc Living Wage Committee.
Students, faculty and staff were also appointed to a new
parking committee that will take effect next semester.

They will be developing a written set of guidelines for
assigning parking spots.
The council hoped to resolve student wage issues, but was
unable to do so adequately this semester. "That wasn't done as
aggressively as it should have been," Budish admitted. He also
added that graduate school advising and increased secure storage are issues that also need to be addressed.
The council would also like to find a better way to help
club sports. "Right now they have to fight for their money
from the athletics department," Budish said. The new officers are now compiling a list of other goals they would like
to attain. "Hopefully those and a wide variety of new ideas
will get done next semester," he added.
Aside from the council's many goals, the first thing that
needs to be accomplished next semester is another elec-

tion. The positions of Appointments Chair and
Educational Policy Representative are not yet filled. A special election will be held one week after students return
from winter break. Nominations for these positions will be

accepted beginning this week.
Budish proposed having a fireside chat with candidates
before elections next semester. It would be like a relaxed
debate, where the candidates would get a chance to
describe their platforms and students could then question
them. Budish was thinking of testing it on a small scale
with the special elections, to see if people would go. "I think
it's worth testing it," he said. "We haven't done anything
like that [in the past]."

The hope is that having a fireside chat might generate
more interest in the elections. In the elections two weeks
ago, SC reported that 653 students voted. Budish was surprised at the low number. Although the roughly 50 percent
voter turnout is consistent with past years, he was expecting it to be higher this semester due to the SPAC resolution
on the possible U.S. war with Iraq.
Budish was careful to explain that the council was simply facilitating the SPAC vote as a body they were not in
favor of or opposed to the resolution. The council felt that
going to war was an important issue and wanted to present
it in the fairest way possible.
"We were doing it to support expression of student

opinion," Budish said.

Morgan will be succeeding him.

The new officers seemed excited and ready to work, vastly different from the jaded departing officers who had just
trudged from the room. Rodriguez wanted to get started
right away, and asked SBC Treasurer Jeff Traczynski 'O4 to
let him come to the Large Scale Events Committee meeting
held on Tuesday. At first Traczynski was against
Rodriguez's coming, preferring that a more experienced
officer attend, but eventually Rodriguez prevailed. "If I'm
not mistaken, in the bylaws it is one of my responsibilities,"
he said. Rodriguez wants to enable students to vote for the
large-scale event they prefer. He said it was one of the major
reasons he ran for the office of Students Events Advisor.
Despite the lack of enthusiasm displayed by some of the
departing council members, they did manage to achieve

some of their goals this semester. One of their most successful ventures was instituting van service to
Philadelphia. "That's been an ongoing project that
required a lot of effort," Budish said.
The council's largest problem, many of its members
agreed, was that they took on many issues that couldn't be
accomplished in one semester, such as self-scheduled exams,
changes to reading week, the credit/no credit process and
PDCs. "A lot of progress has been made, but we don't have a

an individual for investigation. The male matched the
description of a person acting suspiciously and having
been seen in the vicinity of recent thefts. The male was
found in an area clearly posted as private property, no
trespassing. He was transported to Swarthmore Police
headquarters and charged with defiant trespass.
On Sunday, Dec. 1 at 7:40 p.m., Officer Kline was
responding to an emergency assignment. The police
vehicle was traveling north in the 500 block of N.

passing on the left side of the highway, another vehicle
traveling north on N. Chester Road made a right turn to
enter a driveway and contacted the police vehicle.
Officer Kline was transported to Taylor Hospital, treated for neck pain, and released. The other driver did not
seek medical treatment. Both vehicles were towed
from the scene.

Committee plans to solicit more
proposals for large scale event
Last year, it was Nickel Creek. This year, it
could be no one.
The Large Scale Events Committee received
four proposals by Monday's deadline for possible events this year. After reviewing the proposals, however, the committee decided that none
of the events was an appropriate choice for the
2003 Large* Scale Event. In order to continue
the search, the committee has extended the
application deadline until some time after winter vacation.
"We're opening up the Large Scale Event for
a second round of applications because the
committee decided not to take any," said Jeff
Traczynski 'O4, chair of the Large Scale Events
committee.
No deadline has yet to be established for the
second round of proposals. "At this point, I'm going
to say that we're going to open it back up, but as
for a due date [for turning in proposals], we have
yet to establish that," Student Activities
Coordinator Jenny Yim said.
The committee so far has fielded four proposals: two speakers and two musical acts. The
speakers, Boondocks cartoonist Aaron
Magruder and Mystery Science Theater 3000
host Mike Nelson, were deemed inappropriate
for the Large Scale Event. "The two speakers
we decided were more appropriate to a Cooper
Grant and the Forum for Free Speech,"
Traczynski said.
The shortcomings of the musical groups,
according to Traczynski, are their costs. "The
total price tag on the other two were slightly
over budget for what Maurice [Eldridge '6l] is

THE PHOENIX

looking to spend," he said. "We're looking to be
pretty much right at $20,000."
One proposal, calling for the Icelandic band
Sigur Ros, featured an estimated cost of
$35,000, which, according to Traczynski, is
$15,000 over the planned budget for the Large
Scale Event. "Last year, we were at $16,000 for
Nickel Creek and Calvin Weston," he said.

"We're looking to be pretty
much right at $20,000."
Jeff Tracynzski 'O4
The final proposal, hosting the musical group
G. Love and Special Sauce, would seem to be
the most viable. However, this proposal, as presented to the committee, was around $2OOO
over the $20,000 budget, mainly due the rider
demands of the band. Traczynski said the Large
Scale Events Committee will reconsider this proposal if its supporters can "get them to lower
their artist fees."
There is still a chance, however, that students will not enjoy a Large Scale Event this
year. While the committee will accept more submissions, if nothing viable is received by the
still-undetermined submission deadline, in all
likeJihood, there will not be a Large Scale Event.
"By then, we probably just won't have one,
because we'll be out of time," Traczynski said.

CBC won't discuss budget
specifics until January
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

The college is still only starting to prepare its budget for the next
academic year, and this time around it may prove a more difficult
process than in recent years. After insurance rates shot up and endowment returns shrank this past year, the college estimated that it would
have to spend at least $700,000 to $1 million less on other programs next
year in order to avoid running a deficit.
The College Budget Committee (CBC), the group that will put together a proposed budget and present it to the full Board of Managers in
February, met most recently the Thursday before Thanksgiving.
Several members of the finance subcommittee of the Board of
Managers also attended.
According to Jeff Traczynski 'O4, one of four student representatives
to the CBC, board members at the meeting expressed confidence that the
college would be able to find ways to save money painlessly.
The committee did not discuss specifics for next year's budget, since,
as usual, the committee won't know some critical budget information
until January, such as departmental requests or insurance rates.
Instead, Traczynski said, the committee discussed the college's philosophy on drawing money from the endowment each year; it will leave
that strategy unchanged. The college tries to spend less than 4.5 percent
of the total endowment a year. This year, it is spending more than that,
but over the past decade, it has taken less than 4.5 percent from the
endowment a year, on average.
While student representative Matt Rubin 'O3 suggested spending more
from the college's diminished $B3O million endowment as a way to avoid
spending less on certain college programs next year, Traczynski said the
idea is that taking more from the endowment in a given year benefits current students at the expense of future students.

Parrish renovations delayed
by lack of capital funding

High court takes on admissions

Tentative plans would put mailboxes and
new student space in Admissions office
BY PREETY SIDHU
ssidhul@swarthmore.edu
The renovations to Parrish, originally

scheduled to begin in the spring of 2004,
have been pushed back to an unspecified
date, in part because the construction on
the new dorm, to be located near Mertz,
was put on hold for one year. According
to Myrt Westphal, assistant dean of residential life, the Parrish renovations can-

not commence until the new dorm is
there to replace the student rooms.
Westphal cited lack of funding as the
primary reason for the delay of both projects. She insisted, however, that the funding problem has little to do with
Swarthmore's recent budget deficit, as
building projects are funded through the
school's capital campaign. The campaign
is not receiving donations at the rate college administrators originally hoped it
would; this is largely the result of the current economic .climate. The capital campaign, in addition, must raise the money
to complete the new Science Center,
which is not yet completely paid for.

Tedd Goundie, dean of student life,
said that the college solicited estimates
for the Parrish renovations from several
contractors. The firms returned similar
estimates, all of which were higher than

sion in May.

(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich.
A new
national precedent clarifying the use of
race-conscious admissions policies is
forthcoming, with the U.S. Supreme
Court set to hear oral arguments for both
lawsuits filed against the University of
Michigan's admissions policies next
-

the school had originally expected.
Engineers are currently examining
the existing structures in Parrish and
drawing up detailed plans of the building
as it is now. The architectural firm Ayers
Saint Gross will draw up the new plans
once the college has decided where
administrative offices, residential rooms
and student activities spaces will go.
The tentative plans are to move admissions to the second floor and put the post
office, mailboxes and a student lounge in
the old admissions space. The first floor
may also house the deans' area and certain student services spaces. Financial
aid, publications, office services, and the
alumni office may be put on the first or

second floor. The Student Council office,

student publications, and WSRN could
move to the basement.

The fifth floor would then hold dorm
rooms. The fourth floor and half of the
third would remain dorm space. If this
plan is implemented, the fourth floor
would likely be single-sex housing for
women and the third would be single-sex
housing for men, as the overall demand for
female single-sex housing is greater. The
other half of the third floor would probably
contain more administrative offices.
All these plans, however, remain tentative, and there is no deadline for final plans.

spring.

The Court's decision will mark an end

to five years of legal wrangling over the
University's admissions policies and
resolve conflicting opinions issued in the
nation's lower courts.
"We are ready to defend ourselves vigorously," University President Mary Sue
Coleman said after the Court Monday
announced its decision yesterday to hear

the cases.
The University was sued in 1997 by
two white applicants, Barbara Grutter
and Jennifer Gratz, who were denied
admission to the Law School and the
College of Literature, Science and the
Arts, respectively. The plaintiffs claim
they were rejected from the University
while less qualified minority applicants
were admitted.
The Supreme Court will hear both the
Law School and undergraduate admissions cases although the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals has yet to rule on the
undergraduate case.
The 6th Circuit upheld the University's
Law School admissions policies in a deci-

Despite

asking
the
Supreme Court not to hear the cases,
University officials said they were opti-

mistic about the chances for a favorable

University Assistant General Counsel
Jonathan Alger said.
"All along we have developed our
legal strategy with this possibility in
mind," Alger said. "We do believe we

ready to go."

The Center for Individual Rights, a
Washington, D.C.-based law firm, represents the plaintiffs in both cases.
CIR attorney Larry Purdy said they
welcome a new Supreme Court standard
on the use of race in admissions that will

affect the entire nation.
"I would hope that they'll agree unanimously that the use of race and the manner in which the University uses it is inappropriate and wrong," Purdy said. "Such
a ruling, particularly a unanimous ruling
in that regard, would be wonderful for
every student of every race."
Purdy said he was always confident
the Supreme Court would hear the
admissions cases given the division
between the lower courts that have ruled
on cases challenging the admissions
policies of other public universities.
"These are clear splits in the
approaches taken, and that is one reason the Supreme Court will step in to
resolve these cases," Purdy said.

'Heaven' remake turns 1950s dud into success
BY ESTER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu
The original "Far From Heaven," Douglas Sirk's "All
That Heaven Allows" (1955), is a classic melodrama: an
overblown, overacted tear-jerker impossible to take seriously. Its main character is a suburban widow who, in her
loneliness, tentatively begins to see the gardener. The outcry of her children, as well as her community, shames her,
and in the end she must choose between her heart and her
head.
The fact that the film takes place in the 'sos explains the
disproportionate response to her affair. The neighbors gossip maliciously because, as rich women with servants and
no occupations, what else do they have to do? They do not
view class as something to be transcended because they
are already at the top.
The first incarnation of "Heaven" was an excuse for
Rock Hudson, as the gardener, to flex his muscles, and
Jane Wyman, as the widow, to weep. So why bring it back?
Todd Haynes (of "Velvet Goldmine," another period piece
with great costumes) does not exactly answer that question in "Far From Heaven," his resurrection of the film. He
does, however, manage to turn straw into gold, or at least

bottle-blonde.
First off, he changes key details of the story. Julianne
Moore plays the pristine society wife, Cathy, of successful
executive Frank (Dennis Quaid). Instead of dying, Frank
reveals a terrible secret: a lust in his heart for other men.
Initially shaken, Cathy rebounds and staunchly supports
her husband as he seeks therapy.
The purging process, however, does not go as smoothly

as Cathy and Frank hoped. Despite Cathy's optimism and
desire to be helpful in any way she can, Frank cannot seem
to beat this illness. In his frustration, he turns to drink,
avoiding his house, his children (Sis and Junior types, one
of each) and his wife.
Hartford, Conn., their close-knit community, idolizes
Cathy and Frank. The society pages run articles on Cathy;
her parties are always great successes. Cattey struggles to
uphold the veneer for everyone's sake, but the stress on
her begins to show.
Mostly she longs for someone she can confide in honestly. By coincidence, an equally needy person appears in
her backyard. Raymond Deegan (Dennis Haysbert), the
new gardener, arrives, taking the place of his father. He is
capable, sensitive, educated, unjudgmental and removed
from Cathy's world. In short, he is ideal. Only he's black.
Even for Cathy, who considers herself liberal, this
requires some mental adjustment. Soon, however, she
accompanies him out of her comfort zone and into his, dining out with him and dancing at an all-black cafe. Without
ignoring race, they manage to render it unimportant, at
least between them.
Society punishes them for their naivete. Rumors threat-

en to destroy Cathy's reputation and infuriate her husband. Raymond's middle-school-age daughter is chased by
three white boys who pelt her with rocks. Both Cathy and
Raymond's daughters end up literally bruised, and, chastened, Cathy and Raymond disengage.
The added queer and racial dimensions of the story
make "Far From Heaven" more believable to modern audiences than the simple class issue of the original. At the
same time, the film strives to create an authentic sense of

the time period. Cinematographer Ed Lachman sets a gentle visual tone that invokes the 'sos without parody. In the
full of swells and shucks
same way, Haynes' script
allows the characters to fit in the 'sos and still be fully
fleshed-out characters. Moore, particularly, shines.
The film works in large part because the relationship
between Cathy and Raymond avoids stereotypical pitfalls.

Raymond, as a blue-collar African-American man, has the
potential to seem like the virile counterpart to Frank, a
homosexual. But what develops between Cathy and Frank
functions more as a friendship than a romance. They

never so much as kiss. That's the real kicker: even that
interaction is denied them.

Reissue of Pavement debut reveals musical brilliance
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu

The similarities are almost eerie. Both
bands hailed from the Northwest; both
early recordings on
nascent independent labelsâSub Pop and
Drag City; both featured surprisingly

released unheralded

charming, reluctant sex symbols for lead
singers, who also had an incredible knack
for writing catchy songs and hiding them

under distortionâKurt Cobain and Stephen
Malkmus; both embodied the slacker idealâwith a grungy punk-rock and disaffected-artstudent twist, respectively; and in the past
month, both have reentered the music public's consciousnessâa greatest hits collection and an expanded reissue of the transcendent debut full-length.
However, it's harder to find out about the
latter. Yes, Matador Records has organized
its greatest publicity campaign ever around
the reissue of Pavement's debut album,
"Slanted and Enchanted," but this effort
itself serves more effectively as a mechanism to highlight the most important difference between the two best and most influential bands of the 19905, Nirvana and
Pavement. Whereas Nirvana jumped to
GeffenRecords from Sub Pop and the rest is
history, Pavement moved to Matador
Records and the rest is obscured history.
The opening measures of "Smells Like
Teen Spirit" may be the greatest moment
ever recorded in musical history, but it certainly helps to let people know about this
with the support of a major label's multi-million-dollar promotional budget. Billboards
along highways, window-sized posters in
record stores, full-page advertisements in
newspapers, music videos on MTV and
glowing reviews in mass-media publications
can dictate what's cool to the consumer public. According to the liner notes of "Slanted
and Enchanted: Luxe and Reduxe,"
Pavement left Drag City for Matador

But this hook is ironic, considering that
the group isn't trying. Malkmus and
Kanneberg fail to provide an accurate reproduction of the recorded guitar parts, Young
struggles to keep up, and by mid-concert
nearly all the lyrical rhythms and cadences
have been changed and many choruses are

punctuated by pierced squeals.
In retrospect, this reveals why Pavement
probably would never have broken big: they
were just disaffected art-student slackers
who gave only the minimal amount of effort.
The lyrics in "Slanted and Enchanted" are

December 5, 2002

too esoteric: "Trigger Cut" begins, "Lies and
betrayals, fruit-covered nails, electricity and
lust." Too many empty spaces are plugged
with layers of distortion. The liner notes
reveal that the band stopped recording more
than two takes for each song because they
had to run between rooms to operate the
recording equipment, which was too tiring.
The members adopted strange nicknames and rarely conducted interviews.
They found the five most separate parts of
the country to reside in when they weren't
working with the band. After the success of
the single "Cut Your Hair" on the second
album "Crooked Crooked Rain," Pavement
released the excessively experimental
"Wowee Zowee" in 1995. They broke up in
1999 by taking down their Web site. If Cobain
hadn't wanted all the fame, he would have

followed Pavement.

Every

career move the

group executed prevented any movement
towards the spotlight, so that my grandfather knows who Kurt Cobain was, but only
skinny white guys know who Malkmus is.
Then again, maybe this is enough. The
brilliance that pours through the speakers
during "Slanted and Enchanted" can't be
ignored. If you're curious why The Strokes

were more interested in smoking their cigarettes than playing their songs this past
Wednesday night at Roseland Ballroom or
why the sound drops out during crucial
moments of two of the best songs on Spoon's
new album, point your finger at Pavement.
No indie-rock record can be made today
without blatantly borrowing from some part
of Pavement's musical legacy.
During his tenure as The Velvet
Underground's Svengali, Andy Warhol commented that very few people actually bought
the band's debut album, but those who did

formed their own band. The same could be
said for "Slanted and Enchanted." Pavement

is this generation's Velvet Underground and
really, that's not so bad of a historical niche
to occupy.

Goats release another new album
BY ROSS HOFFMAN

khoffmal@swarthmore.edu
So far, this year has seen at least five
releases from John Darnielle (aka the

Mountain Goats): the commendable fulllength "All Hail West Texas," three discs of
reissued rarities, and a collaboration with
Franklin Bruno as "The Extra Glenns." Well,
here's another one. It's almost
as though Darnielle could
anticipate the burning desires

of legions of fans who have
thoroughly digested those first
five releases and are hungry
for more.
That's one conceivable
explanation for the existence
of this album. Another might
be that it's an experiment to
see how long we music critics
will be able to continue writing the same thing about the
same music again and again.
Because this is, essentially,
more of the same from the
infinitely talented Mr. Darnielle: the same
alternately tender and violent guitar technique, the same ineffably pointed lyrical
observations about our everyday realities,
the same penchant for place names (earlier
albums include "Ghana" and "Sweden.")
Actually, this a concept album about an outof-love couple who have "stayed drunk so
long that they're not sure of much else
beyond the mutually destructive urge that
continues to hold their house together."
And they live in Tallahassee. While the
songs here aren't as consistently ingenious
as those collected on the defining classics
"Full Force Galesburg" and "Coroner's

the
Gambit," there are a few true gems
catchy self-loathing "No Children" ("I hope
I cut myself shaving tomorrow /I hope it
bleeds all day long") and the brooding
"International Small Arms Traffic Blues"
("our love is like the border between Greece
and Albania.")

Truth be told, this record does have a few

surprises to offer. There's the unusually professional-looking album art,

which is lush and artsy, with
flowers and spoons and
unidentifiable bits of photomontage in a style markedly similar to all other recent
releases on the 4AD label,
seemingly left over from the
days of the Pixies. (What are
the Mountain Goats doing on
4AD

anyway?)

Musically,

there's a comparable lushness this is more produced

than any other MG record yet
(which isn't saying much
mostly just that there isn't a
buzz threatening to drown
out Darnielle's voice on every song), and it
certainly features more instruments: drums,
piano, harmonica, xylophone and bass guitar all over the freaking place. It's the sort of
thing you'd expect him to do if he were ever
interested in appealing to a wider audience
and certainly some fans will be upset

about even this level of polish (it's still a
pretty minimal sound)
but I don't think
that's what's going on here. This is the 13th
or so Mountain Goats album, and he just
wanted to try something a little different. A
little. Whether or not you're afraid of change
you're not going to go wrong with the
Mountain Goats.

Sex and the Swattie

Sexile in the city
This is the third in a series of columns by various Swarthmore voices about the
subject of sex. One or more of the columnists featured in this section may be
hired to write this column next semester, so let us know what you think at
phoenix@swarthmore.edu.

BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

It was either the second or third time that my roommate saw my (now ex-) girlfriend from Brown, and she had her shirt off. Well, more exactly, she had the
spaghetti straps of her t-shirt down around her arms, but from under the covers,
when he first came in, she looked (he said later) topless. Timidly he knocked on
our door, and (after several seconds of adjustment), when I opened it, he asked if
he could sneak back in for a second to grab his lighter, catching an eyeful of shoulders and skin along the way.
It proved yet another example of how roommate relations can hinder and complicate your Swat sex life. From managing that critical time with your computer
or personal periodical, to carrying out the ultimate act itself, the sexile, talking
about and executing plans with your roommate to accommodate your and their
sex lives can be trickier than presenting in seminar on that book you clearly
haven't read.

The key rule to a roommate relationship that makes sex manageable and pleasurable for you both (and both of your sex partners, should you both be that fortunate) seems pretty simple: talk it out. Unfortunately, I know too many who are
frustrated with their inability to get any or, alternatively, get any work done in
their room as a result of poor communication. Don't shy away from those key fifteen minutes when you and your roommate sit down and hash out when it's OK,
when it's not, and the ever important question on whether lubricant (or sex toys
of a more exotic nature) and/or your birth control of choice are acceptable just sit-

ting out on your desk, next to that damn Dostoevsky.

Give your roommate proper notification of your
intentions to dominate the room that night (and
whatever else you might want to dominate, if
that's your thing).
For personal time in particular, use your academic resources wisely. Stop by
the Registrar's Office to better manage times when sex (with yourself or others) is
convenient for both parties: no, don't go asking Martin Warner (or his harem of
secretaries, no matter how wise they might seem on matters of picking the right
sex schedule). Instead, grab some schedule cards that you both can fill out and
exchange each semester, so you're sure when you've got a guaranteed 20 minutes
to pull out that Playboy or Playgirl before your roommate's back from Econ 1 (and
is probably in no mood to wait around while you zip up), and what days your
roommate is in those critical 1:15-4:00 classes that leave the door wide open (so to
speak) for an afternoon delight with your significant other. (This goes mainly for
those of you in relationships with another Swattie, who find fornication time on a
more regular basis than I did with my ex from Brown. You lucky bastards.)
When the weekend arrives, and you're interested in a little Saturday Night
Fever, go the extra mile. Give your roommate proper notification of your intentions to dominate the room that night (and whatever else you might want to dominate, if that's your thing). A good three days before ought to do. This is, of course,
keeping in mind that heading to a PACES party can sometimes lead to emergency
room needs: both roommates should allow for a few of "Get into the room alone
free" cards each semester for such random hook-ups, but, as with all things involving sex and your roommate (and sex more generally), don't overdo it.
To earn extra points, poll the hall for those rooms where your roommate can find
lodgings that night (he/she might feel more comfortable arranging it for themselves,
but they'll be flattered that you cared enough to go around, admitting to everyone
you were going to be getting some that night and needed a place for them to crash).
Lastly, when you're just getting back from class (or wherever) and do find that
your roommate's sexual games have gone into overtime, keep your cool: knock
politely and allow ample time for reapplying clothes. Most importantly, when you
first walk in and find both your roommate and his/her significant other with rosy
cheeks and shy grins, be discreet: asking how many times exactly that they rode
the pony is a no-no. Later, remember rule number one: make sure your roommate
understands that such spillovers are OK every now and then, but you really need
to come back to an open, welcoming, unlocked room after Chinese drill.
Some situations, like the one where my roommate (Nick, who has always been
nothing but exemplary in his handling of the sexual politics of the roommate rela-

tionship) walked back in our room to find more flesh than he bargained for, may
be unavoidable. But bringing in the RA, who your roommate went to in a fuss
because he/she has a problem set due tomorrow and you've locked the door again,
is unnecessary. In the end, managing a roommate relationship where sex is a nonissue means remembering what makes your romantic relationships work out in
the first place: great communication. That way, you'll find yourself on the same
sexual level with your partner (hopefully leading to occasions where you have to
sexile sooner), and with your roommate, too. And all three of you will be happier,

more satisfied people for it.

A STATUESQUE STROLL
VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL AND MOBILE
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE

sbevehl@swarthmore.edu

After all too many sprints to class, campus art (even the
really big pieces) tends to blend into the scenery, becoming little more than part of the landscape. The nest-like
twig tower in the tree in front of Trotter and the twisted
metal by the train tracks begin to look mundaneand inconspicuous.

But stop and look and you'll wonder just what are these
things? And how did they get here?
The sculptures that dot campus are part of the
Benjamin West Collection. Whenever you go to Sharpies,
say "hi" to the Alekos Kyriakos's "Sappho," a reclined
metal version of the ancient Greek female poet. As you
grumble along to the McCabe library, wander past the
"Urn" by Harry Bertoia, which used to reside in front of
Dupont Hall. And no, that's not an abandoned snowplow,
that's "Garnet" by Robert Murray in front of Lang 1974.
Pass Pearson on a windy day and watch Alexander
Calder's "(Flying) Back from Rio" twirl in the breeze.
Imagine yourself back in 1993, trying to walk from Trotter
to Hicks without wrecking yourself on the tremendous
steel cage of David Stromeyer's "Slide Rock" now located
on the Mertz lawn. Cut across Trotter lawn and see if
Patrick Dougherty's "Abracadabra" might fall on you. Turn
that routine walk into an art-filled adventure.
Provost Connie Hungerford helps to oversee
Swarthmore's art. Her work as a professor of 19th and
20th century art corresponds well with the college's collection. Holdings consist primarily of two-dimensional
works but also include ceramics and tools from around the
world, bequeathed to the college or donated for tax deductions. The collection grew most rapidly with the formation
of the Benjamin West Society, named after the 18th century colonial painter and early resident of the Benjamin
West House. The Society has since transformed into the
endowment for the annual Benjamin West Lecture. The
items reside in the List Gallery, the Friends Library, public
spaces, and occasional administrative walls. Hungerford
described the pieces as ranging from valuable to historical
to "just a touch of color." The college also has one painting
on loan to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Those of you gasping over your tuition bills should be
happy to know that Swarthmore has a "no purchase policy" for its art collections, so the college does not pay a
cent. Donors and even artists bring all kinds of art to
Swarthmore, often in memoriam to alums and professors
or in celebration of new buildings.
While paintings bring art inside, outdoor art like the
Calder Mobile, the Slide Rock figure, and the birds nest
challenge passersby, dog walkers, and the landscape.
In 1967, friends, family and students of economics

of
Hungerford's
favorites.
When you're ready for something a little more stable, wander over to Patrick Dougherty's "Abracadabra," the latest
addition to Swarthmore's sculpture collection.
In
September of 2000, a flock of students, arboretum staff,
and local residents assembled a 45 foot tall nest out of
branches.
Gallery Director Andrea Packard organized the event
with $7OOO worth of help from the Cooper Foundation, the
Scott Arboretum and the art department, including Claire
Sawyers and Professor Sydney Carpenter. A longtime fan
of Dougherty's work, Packard enjoys the sculpture's ability
to point to "the effemorality of the things around us and
their mutability."
This creation wove branches together with a dying tree
to form the massive but natural structure. Dougherty uses
natural and architectural components to redefine the viewer's perception of the underlying elements. This interaction transformed perceptions of a dead tree and some
branches for even the most casual viewer. In House and
Garden magazine Dougherty commented that he "liked
the idea of trash trees turned into something that evokes
emotion." One student volunteer, Catherine Taylor, enjoyed
her experience so much that she went on to work with
Dougherty over the summer.
Made of natural materials, the sculpture is temporary,
though it has already outlived its expected lifespan of one
to two years. Packard assures pedestrians that the branches will not fall, but that people should not climb it. When
the tree underneath is ready to come down, Abracadabra
will be dismantled too.
In the meantime, viewers continue to react to the sculpture on the way to class, on elementary school trips, and
on walks with the dog. A few confused travellers even get
out of their cars to ponder "Abracadabra."
When your neck gets tired of looking at tree tops, head
down Mertz Lawn to David Stromeyer's "Slide Rock."
Stromeyer builds pieces in his Vermont studio and finishes
assembling them on-site, an assembly process one can
describe as "tricky." Stromeyer explains that a lot of his
work is very large, which "grew out of the fact that I'm very
interested in how people move in space." His use of horizontal structures mimics human movement and creates
"interior spaces that you can walk into and feel enclosed

by."
Many students have commented on the intimate feeling that the "Sex Sculpture" creates. Rather than define
what the object was, Stromeyer explained that, "If I wanted to say something that could be described in words I
would have been a writer. I try to explore abstract spaces;
problems."
When I suggested that some view the sculpture as two
(intimate) figures Stromeyer answered that "What ever
gets people to engage with it, I'm happy about."
Engagement is what Swarthmore's scultpures strive to

do.
Erica Cartmill 'O3 remarked that suburban
Swarthmore College is not the type of place you'd expect
much art. Like many students, Cartmill passed by the
sculptures without much thought, but upon learning about
Calder and the background of Sappho, she began to enjoy
the sculptures as well as the flora fauna. For the future,
Cartmill requests that "We should get a Keith Harring
Mural, except that he's dead.'

Your mom digs their show
WSRN game show hosts reveal secrets of Botticelli Your Mom in "top secret interview"
BY JASON PERINI

jperinil@swarthmore.edu
Botticelli Your Mom. No really. Hey, back off man, itâs
the name of a WRSN radio show, hosted by Gabriel Rogers
âO5 and Andrew Gregory âO4. As Gregory puts it, itâs âa
game show where the audience tries to unveil a mystery
person whose identity is known only to Gabriel and me.â
The various rules of âBotticelli Your Momâ are a bit
complicated, but it all starts with a letter: the first letter of
the mystery personâs name. After announcing the letter,
the hosts ask listeners to call up with yes-or-no questions
such as âAre you real?â or âAre you alive?â or âAre you an
entertainer?â The clues pile up, and eventually, Rogers
explained, âThe final call is like, âHa! You are Sequoia, who
wrote the Cherokee alphabet!ââ
Pretty simple, huh? Not so fast. You, the caller, must
first âearnâ the right to ask questions by coming up with a
âstumper.â To do this,, you think of a person and give the
hosts hints that might allow them to guess who it is. Your
person nameâs must start with the announced letter. If
both the first name and last name starts with that letter,
itâs a double, and you stand to win two questions. The
catch is that the person has to be at least as famous as
Botticelli, hence the first part of the showâs name. If
Gregory and Rogers cannot guess a callerâs mystery person, the caller gets to ask them a question about their mystery person. But if the hosts catch your âstumperâ... well,
then theyâll hang up on you and make fun of your mom.
And thatâs the second part of the showâs title.

Ouch.
So Rogers and Gregory are in a sense contestants as
well as hosts. They are forced to prove their knowledge,
and the callers get to put them under the spotlight. Itâs a
neat twist, and it makes for a frequently hilarious and
entertaining hour. I met up with Gregory and Rogers in a
darkened Sharpies booth for a âtop-secret Phoenix interview.â
Jason Perini: Tell me about the show.
Gabriel Rogers: Botticelli Your Mom is WRSNâs one and
only game show. It is WRSNâs best show, because it is composed entirely of calls.

So how do they do it? I mean, they purport to be able to

Literally for the last 20 minutes of each night, the phones
are ringing off the hook. Anyway, we had thought of
"Juliet" before the show as our second person and

Philadelphia offers a lot
to see and do. Some of these
things require you just to
enjoy the simple pleasures

of life. Like what? Like
walking through a giant
heart, sitting in a coffee
shop on South Street and
going to South Philly to eat
Italian pastries. Or even
kayaking on the Schuylkill?
Check out the following.

RASHELLE ISIP

Heart to Heart
One of my favorite
One Stop Out of Swat exhibits at the Franklin
lnstitute is a replica of the
human heart. Sure, this
may sound an awful lot like that movie "The Fantastic
Voyage," and in some ways it is. The heart is designed so
that you can walk through it, mimicking the path through
which blood is pumped in your own heart. There's a constant "lub-dub" sound being played which almost makes you
feel as if you were in some giant's heart (well, minus the
blood and all). For some strange reason it also appears to be
remarkably warm, and incredibly bright (there are lights so
you can find your way around). The heart exhibit is definitely not for the claustrophobic; there are some really tight
spaces and steep stairways. At one point you do get a breath
of fresh air, and there's a part where you can see the entire

exhibit floor from the top of the heart. And of course, there's
that occasional screaming kid running up and down the
staircases, trying to beat his friends to the exit. It really isn't
that bad. Just stand your ground, or better yet, visit the
Institute on a weekday; at least then you can avoid the
school groups by being 20 paces ahead of them.

A Cup of Joe
There's a nice little coffee shop on South Street. They've
got lattes, hot chocolate, biscotti, tea and a variety ofother
beverages and goodies to eat. Is this some new and trendy
coffeehouse? Sort of. Okay, I give in, it's Starbucks. You
might ask, "So what does this Starbucks have that's so amazing?" Well it's not really the coffee or the cookies, but the
view. If you climb the stairs to the second floor you can get a
seat smack dab in the corner of the building that faces out

onto South Street. One of the most interesting Saturday
mornings that I spent in Philly was sitting in this Starbucks
and watching South Street recover from the night before.
Everything literally begins to spring into life before your
very eyes. Storefronts opening, people milling about, the
nonexistent traffic utterly amazing.

Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth
Remember the famed "Cheesesteak Challenge" from last

'Mineola Twins': coming to a Frear Theatre near you
BY BETH COLLINS
ecollinsl@swarthmore.edu

And now, the end is near. The Senior
Company members have but one more
awful week of grueling, gut-wrenching
work before showtime this weekend. It's
tech week, when lights, sound, costumes,
props and sets appear, often for the first
time, in rehearsal as they will appear in
the performances.
Most tech week rehearsals result in frazzled nerves, edgy performers and homicidal
directors. Fortunately,
the
Senior
Company's production ofPaula Vogel's "The
Mineola Twins" has experienced very few of
these practically inevitable symptoms.
Performers remain stable and even optimistic, and directors Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3
and Jessica Nakamura 'O3 have yet to make
death threats to other company members.
Actor Sam Dingman 'O4 said, "This is actually the most comfortable tech experience
I've ever had."
The cast and crew certainly have something to be optimistic about. During an
open run-through a few weeks ago, the cast
put on what proved to be an excellent performance of the show in its early stages.
The rehearsal began as Sam Camp's 'O5
"We Will Rock You" accompanied Hannah
Harvester's 'O5 physical warm-ups. Soon
after group warm-ups and any personal
preparation the actors themselves carried
out, the run-through began.
Complete with sex, drugs and biblical
allusions, "The Mineola Twins" follows two
sisters, Myra and Myrna, through three
decades of the 20th century. The play begins
during the Eisenhower administration at
Mineola High, home of the Mineola
Mustangs. Conservative Myrna works at a
diner frequented by the love of her life, Jim,
whose dream is to live in the suburbs and
have 2.5 children, and laments the life of
her radical sister Myra, who goes to
Greenwich Village far too often. "There are
a lot of girls wearing pants down there,"
after all. The play continues through the
Nixon administration, as the sisters contin-

ue to experience extreme differences. Myra,
now an anti-war radical, has a strong influence on Myrna's son, Kenny. Myrna warns
Kenny of the dangers of listening to an aunt
like that: "What your Aunt Myra did was
wrong. This is America, love it or leave it."
(Myrna's words have a certain resonance

today, huh?)
The play's last period takes place during the Bush Sr. administration. Myrna is
now a right-wing talk show host who
claims, "Ten years from now, we'll take
this country back." (Again, the resonance
thing. Paula Vogel, the next Miss Cleo?)

The ever-liberal Myra is now a lesbian
Planned Parenthood worker living with
her partner, Sarah, and their son, Ben,
who is enamored of his aunt's political
views.
The production is loaded with modern
political, psychological and sexual issues,
which the cast and crew of this year's Senior

"Everything's really starting to pull together
now," director Nelson-Lee said. "After

has been so wonderful about Senior
Company: we, just as students, have done
this by ourselves. I think it says a lot for the
Swarthmore theatre department to have prepared us well enough to pull off, essentially
by ourselves, what I hope will be an excellent performance."
All that stands between the cast and
crew and an outstanding performance is
tech week. The lights and sounds, props,
costumes and sets add another dimension
to the already exceptional performance. (I
know it sounds like I'm fawning over the
Senior Company but it's really that good, I

promise.)
"Tech week adds this presence to the

Dingman said. "You have to rethink the

on sound and light cues, minor costume
changes and other things typical to a tech

So, it's almost the end of the most
important experience of a theatre major's
college career. What were the best and
worst of these times, and are the company
members completely petrified for the per-

setting, I really haven't had enough time to
'get lost' in the experience."
"There is nothing I feel particularly
nervous about this performance," Lazarevic
said. "I just feel a bit pressured, of course, to
support the rest of the ensemble."
"What am I nervous about? Everything!
But in a good way," Dingman said.

Company members, have been given," said

on the stage and realize that the audience
adds another dimension to performance.
What you have been convinced is funny in
the show may not spark a bit of laughter
from the crowd, and, in contrast, what you
might think as mundane could have the
audience rolling in the aisles. It really
catches you off guard sometimes."
From the appearance of the runthrough, Senior Company members have
nothing to worry about. The semester of
hard work has paid off enormously, and the
Senior Company members can rest easy

Terpsichore, the entirely student-based dance organization named for the Greek muse of the art form has
grown from its inception in the Spring of 2001, when Emily Clough 'O3 and Carla Greenberg 'O4 began tabling at
Sharpies and from the inaugural performance in the Boyer dance studio at the end of its first semester to its current incarnation with literally dozens of participants. But its purpose to give people of different experience lev-

els a chance to dance together, and for people to choreograph who might not otherwise do so remains
unchanged. The results of all this creative momentum are yours to view at this semester's Terpsichore performance which will take place for the first time on the LPAC mainstage, on December 10th (next Tuesday) at
around eight o'clock. The hate-America left will be in evidence, as will Metallica played on cellos.

David disappoints
Any Swattie who was on campus in the month
prior to David Horowitz's Tuesday night speech can
attest to the buildup. Some of us eagerly awaited the

arrival of a strong conservative voice on a campus
run by the so-called "Hate-America Left." Some of us
dreaded the appearance of the evil, tyrannical force of
ad fame. Some of us were just anticipating some good, firey entertainment.
We were sorely disappointed on all fronts. David
Horowitz proved unconvincing, sensational, and a
general waste of $3OOO. By bringing Horowitz to campus, the College Republicans did not open the dialogue they were hoping for; they simply provided
more ammunition for the other side. An informed
although perhaps less well-known conservative speakreparations

er would have been more beneficial for all parties
involved.

Horowitz's speech jumped from topic to topic,
always swerving back to the reasons we should love
our country and the reasons why Swarthmore is a
"retrograde, totalitarian institution" but never providing a solid persuasive base. Though Swatties barraged
him with questions, Horowitz did not provide a minimal train of argument from which to begin an
informed dialogue. He failed to provide a shred of evidence for statements such as "The natural state of
human beings is war;" "This [Palestine] is a sick culture;" and "There's no reason to be poor in America,"
preferring to let the statements hang in the air amid
laughter, then move on to the next statement.
We know from Horowitz's writings that he can do

better than this, when he has calmed down a bit.
Where were the detailed exposes of the holes in Noam
Chomsky's criticisms of American action in Iraq?
Where were the case studies of abuses of power by
college administrations following a multicultural
agenda? Where were the firsthand analyses of the
destructive actions by radical left-wing movements
like the Black Panthers that landed Horowitz in the
conservative camp in the first place?
One would also think that in a speech that directly
attacks our campus and our administration, Horowitz
would have at least done some research about our
campus in order to give some real criticisms. His
attempt to attack and defame our college to an audience of Swatties, many who made sacrifices to come
here and be part of Swat culture, was the kind of
point that one should back up with a little evidence.
Horowitz did not even satisfy those of us in search
of a good show. Besides his lack of evidence, Horowitz
displayed a surprising lack of firepower. At times, he
even seemed unsure of himself, at which points he
would revert back to his standard America-is-the-bestcountry-in-the-world rant. Not only was logical argument lacking, so was compelling emotionalrhetoric.
One wonders if he came here to actually effect
change or if he was engaging in the futile, self-congratulatory protesting he so often accuses the left of.
His style of speech was more in keeping with an
angry locker-room rant than a prepared lecture; we
might tolerate or even enjoy it in an informal setting,
from a friend, but we expect more from a professional
speaker paid to be here than a long string of complaints about his pet peeves.
Most importantly, Horowitz failed to fulfill his
promise to fill us in on "the other half of the story"
and bring much-needed political diversity to our campus. By giving us a chain of sensationalist statements
that we could do little with but laugh at, Horowitz
gave us a distorted picture of the conservative perspective, perhaps even reinforcing the campus' leftleaning perspective. Perhaps the College Republicans
are right that as a minority they suffer from our campus' political bias, but if they're serious about fighting
anti-Republican stereotypes they should take active
steps to disprove them, instead of hiring speakers who
personify them.
The dollars it took to reel Horowitz in could have
been spent on a major, non-extremist Republican
leader who could have given an informed account of
the conservative perspective.

Fair vote should be top priority
phrases are very different. While the second may spawn

Dear Editor:
While voting in the Student Council elections last week,
I was surprised and delighted to find a venue to voice my
opinion on the SPAC Iraq Resolution. There seem to be few
other ways of reflecting true campus opinion on current
issues, without conceding to the label "liberal" and generalizing it to the majority of the student body.
However, it puzzled me that the only three options available for voting were "I agree," "I disagree" and "No preference," and perhaps more importantly, written arguments
against the resolution were not present at all of the voting
sites. Regardless of political creed or stance on the resolution, I think we can agree that while voting on such highly
debated issues, both stances of the argument must be given

equal chances to be heard. It is true that the debate has
taken place numerous times around campus, but that cannot justify the absence of arguments against the resolution
at the voting sites, while arguments for the resolution
seemed incorporated into it.
Furthermore, I do not think that it was fair to give those
students still debating the issue an option of "No preference"
rather than an "I do not know." The connotations of the two

from serious thought on the issue, the first is more suggestive of complete apathy. Those students who voted online
were forced to select one of the three given options, and it is
obvious that some Swatties may have felt uncomfortable
using 'No preference' to describe their true feelings.
SPAC did a wonderful job in amassing support for its resolution, but I feel that the structure of the ballot took away
from the credibility of the vote and thereby proceeded to
undermine the solid efforts put forth by SPAC's members to
educate us on the Iraq issue and to hear our real opinions. I
would like to end by sincerely congratulating SPAC on the
outcome of the vote, by thanking Student Council for offering the student body a chance to vote on the issue on the
council's election ballot, and by encouraging more such
votes to take place so that if we are dubbed a "liberal campus" the label has more basis than a simple tag-name
attached to our community.
However, we need to be more aware of the delicate issues
that surround fair voting and take caution in the future to
avoid them, regardless of their apparent triviality.

December: exam month,
and the month in which the
idea of dropping out of school
to become a professional fisherman, fisherperson, or whatever, suddenly seems very
attractive and highly practical. After living with several
different people, I have seen
that there are many ways in

which to approach a final
paper or exam.

paper, will spend the entire

evening making long-distance
phone calls while simultaneously talking to five different
people over AIM and listening to loud punk music until
one in the morning, when she will watch a few old episodes
of The X-Files. At three in the morning, she will turn around
in her chair and ask, "Hey, do you know anything about (fill
in paper topic)?" I don't. She frowns and turns back to her

blank Word document and the stack of unread books. She
stares at the screen, waiting to see which of them will blink

first. She pokes at the keyboard, testing its reflexes. Finally,
she types out a sentence. She reads it over and laughs darkly.
She types out a few more, and reads them aloud to me, still
laughing. When I go to bed, I can hear the rapid clattering of

the keyboard, interrupted by random bursts of cynical laugh-

ter.

Regarding papers and exams at
Swarthmore: They will be harder than
you think. They will take longer than
you think. There is such a thing as
too much chai.
Roommate Number Two will want to brainstorm for her
paper by having a two-hour philosophical discussion over the
efficiency or inefficiency of markets while the rest of us, who
couldn't identify a basic supply and demand curve to save our
lives, clutch our coffee mugs and try to look intelligent. I will
occasionally try to distract her by asking for her help with a
math problem. She will stare at the problem, which begins
something like, "What is the probability that Bob will draw at
least one blue M&M
and immediately perk up, launching
into an explanation of how the universe is really constructed
out of a series of dots, which is why we can never really arrive
anywhere, because the dots just keep dividing in two, and
eventually scrawl out a complex equation full of illegible,
Greek-looking symbols and dash out of the room before I have

a chance to say "pretend I'm in third grade."

Roommate Number Three will meditate in the lotus position for a good portion of an hour before starting a paper. She
is rarely seen working, but somehow her work is always done.
She is in bed by 11 every night, after casting one final disapproving look at the rest of us, who aren't even halfway
through our serious work. Rumor has it that she plans out her
week in advance.
Roommate Number Four is not assigned papers. Instead,
she takes three lab sciences and lives in Cornell. She does
her work, whatever it is that science people do, by not budging from her desk until about four in the morning. Her eerie
efficiency prompts the rest of us to play the distract-theroommate game. "Sang, what do you think of Aristotle?"
"Sang, can we play with your molecular modeling kit?"
"Sang, can you look at this meat and tell me if you think it's
gone bad?"
I have been able to conclude three things regarding papers
and exams at Swarthmore: They will be harder than you
think. They will take longer than you think. There is such a
thing as too much chai. But there is no reason to despair. In
the words of one of my roommates: "Yeah, so she told me I had
no thesis, structure, or analysis." Well, what did you get? "Oh,
I got a B-plus."

Night of Scenes fosters stereotypes
Dear Editor:
When we attended Drama Board's Night of Scenes
last week, we were very troubled by the representation
of the character Manuel in the "Fawlty Towers" sketch.
The character portrayed most of the harmful stereotypes of Hispanic people (defining Hispanic as being of
Spanish and/or Latin American
descent) and did not challenge
them. We are certain that the
directors were not meaning to
offend us and were merely

pointed out.

The main character, Basil, was shown as being very
classist, and much of the (quite good) humor of the
sketch revolved around showing how ridiculous Basil's
classist assumptions were. Because the character o
Manuel was more peripheral to the storyline, the

underlying fallacies in his stereotyp

Wise's biased talk stunts dialogue
BYAVIVA ARON-DINE

gration to the United States and Western Europe
an unpleasant but central truth: the U.S. and
Western Europe shut their doors to Jewish immigration, literally turning back boatloads of Holocaust
refugees. Western countries continued to shut their
doors after the Holocaust was over, which is why
ignore

aarondil@swarthmore.edu

A few hours after Tim Wise finished his talk, a suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus in Jerusalem,
killing 11 people and wounding dozens. A week later,
bombers killed. three vacationing Israelis and 10
Kenyans while a-gunman shot six voters at an Israeli
polling place. The issues Wise dealt with have lifeand-death implications, and I found his treatment of
them irresponsible in light of their seriousness.
Wise's central claim was that Zionism has made
Jews less safe. There isn't space here to address every
aspect of Wise's argument,
much less every statement t^^^^m^mmm^^^^ma
of his I found misleading,
but a few things deserve
special attention.
To me, Wise's argument
that Zionism is bad
because neo-Nazis make
use of it was frankly offensive. I understand that

hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors lanuntil
guished in British displaced persons camps
the founding of the state of Israel.
A third Tim Wise claim that particularly troubled
me was his statement that Israel is a "white people's
democracy." I know a lot of us found Wise's comments on United States racial (injustice pretty on target; I certainly did. But I
want to plead with you not
to accept a simplistic equation between anti-racist
and anti-Israel or antiimplicaZionist. One-sixth of Israeli
citizens are Israeli Arabs,
and eight Israeli Arabs currently serve in the Knesset,
Israel's
Parliament.
Furthermore, one-half of
Israeli Jews are Mizrachi,
Jews from Arab countries who here in the United
States are classified as people of color. They are the
refugees and descendents of refugees forced from
their homes in Arab countries after Israel's creation
(the number of 1948 Jewish refugees from Arab countries was approximately equal to the number of 1948
Palestinian refugees).
Tim Wise admitted during the question-andanswer period that he was only presenting one side of
the Middle East's complicated story. He justified his
deliberate bias partly by saying the anti-Zionist side
normally went unheard. But that's patently false on
this campus. To argue that you need to present a onesidedly anti-Israel view of the Middle East conflict
here because people here never hear what's wrong
with Israel is bizarre and irresponsible. Swarthmore
students are inundated with criticism of Israel. When
someone comes to speak with the avowed intention of
giving an unbalanced presentation, I don't think he's
adding much to campus discourse.

The issues Wise dealt with
have life-and-death
tions, and I found his treatment
of them irresponsible in light of
their seriousness.

Wise condemned neoNazism. But he also said
that Zionism pushes Jews into a "de facto alliance
with neo-Nazis" and "makes it easy to invite that kind
statements which seem to fit right into
of trouble"
the victim-blaming mentality he condemned. Saying
there shouldn't be a Jewish state because hate groups
don't like it sounds an awful lot like saying Jews
or, for that matter,
shouldn't be doctors or lawyers
because it's fodder for conDemocrats or socialists
spiracy theorists.
Wise's statements about early Zionists' complicity
in the Holocaust were at least equally problematic.
For one thing, Wise's assertions are factually questionable. Wise said the Rabbi Stephen S. Wise discouraged the Roosevelt Administration from admitting Jewish immigrants during the Holocaust; an
article in this Sunday's New York Times Book Review
notes that Rabbi Wise was the person who first alerted Roosevelt to the fact that the Holocaust was happening. More to the point, (Tim) Wise's complaints

Stereotyping frats ignores diversity
Dear Editor:
When I started reading Rachel Burstein's Beirut
article in the Phoenix ["Beirut and Burstein: Matter
and antimatter collide," Nov. 14], I expected to find a
humorous yet informational piece on an activity that
a large portion of this campus takes part in. While I
know that a certain group of people plays the game
more than others, I had no expectations that this article would target this group and poke fun at them.
First, I will clear up some of the mistakes that
Rachel made in her article, which were mostly due to
quoting individuals out of context. Zak Gelacek, Ben
Wiles and I never stated that Beirut is a thinking
game. No drinking game in which you can succeed
while being drunk could ever possibly be conceived
as a thinking game.
My quote was meant, in full, to state that Beirut is
as much of a sport as bowling, curling, billiards and
rhythmic gymnastics. Ben Wiles meant to state, in
full, that Beirut is a weekly occurrence or event, such
as watching TV or going to church. (Frankly, I think
both of these quotes are hilarious, and the article
ruined them.)
These quotes were used in the article to make us
seem as if we fit a certain stereotype. Because we
really don't take the game seriously, we added some
humor to our comments. Only later did we find that
these quotes were used in order to make a mockery of

fraternities.
Most of us who decided to attend this school did so
in order to find a diverse community. I came here as
a football and basketball player hoping to major in
art. I am now a basketball player who majors in economics and minors in education. Obviously, somewhere along the way, I was affected by a variety of

opinions and influences.
The Beirut article categorized certain Beirut players as "J.-Crew-wearing-fraternity-belonging-jock"
types. I, like many of my fraternity friends, have
never worn a piece of J. Crew clothing in my life. It
was also stated that DU pledges in McCabe were few
and far between. I can't speak for them, but should
students be mocked because of their study habits?
Also, let us not forget that the esteemed Tom McCabe
was a brother ofDU. While I don't want to argue over
clothing selection or study habits, this type of stereotyping leads nowhere.
The entire campus has argued over the racial
overtones of a Halloween costume for the last three
weeks, while we fail to look at the overall diversity of
Swarthmore College. We call ourselves a diverse campus, but is it really that great to have diversity only
in numbers? What does it matter if percentages show
numerous different backgrounds, but none of these
groups interact?
It seems as if students and administrators alike
take pride in our diverse campus, yet we continue to
categorize people as Swillies, jocks, frat guys, or
engin dorks. Swarthmore students discuss a variety
of issues in the hopes of clearing up what they view
as misperceptions. It often seems, though, that no one
truly listens to each other.
A campus cannot truly be diverse if individuals

state their opinions while never listening to others.
This type of behavior leads to bigotry and stereotyping. It is this sort of behavior that is evident in
Rachel's article. To use something as arbitrary and
silly as Beirut to mock others seems about as ridiculous as the game itself.

BY TARU TAYLOR
ttaylorl@swarthmore.edu
My last Op-Ed detailed my disappointment in the
PC Shakespeare course of Fall 200 L The following
semester I signed up for "Dostoevsky," thinking,
"Surely I can't go wrong now; a credit for studying my
literary god." Alas, what I signed up for turned out to
be not "Dostoevsky," but rather "The New Criticism
(featuring the works of Dostoevsky)." "New Criticism"
is a method of pure textual analysis that ignores biography and social context. At least "Identity Politics
(featuring Shakespeare)" was contextual, if narrow.
"The New Criticism (featuring the works of
Dostoevsky)" closed his novels into a vacuum.
I read "Crime and Punishment" as a high-school
senior and related to the hero, Raskolnikov. I related
his suffering, part and parcel of the phantasmagoria
that was Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg, to my own suffering, part and parcel of the D.C. hood. He was a poor
ambitious law student given to hero-worship of
Napoleon. I was a poor ambitious college-prep student
given to hero-worship of Malcolm X. He invented an
"extraordinary man theory." I was inspired by
Nietzsche's theory of the "superman." He was 20.1 was
18. Raskolnikov and I connected via Dostoevsky, who
spoke to me. I responded by marking up my copy of the
novel and later by writing a 15-page senior thesis on it.
But the New Criticism dismisses such personal
experience, for it dismisses all reading not strictly
impersonal. Considering the author's meaning, his
intended moral, is the "intentional fallacy."
Considering meanings that readers might bring to the

text is the "affective fallacy." But the "Epilogue" of
"Crime and Punishment," through which Dostoevsky
shows Raskolnikov's repentance, is so explicitly the
moral that it reminds one of the morals which end
Aesop's Fables. But New Critics dismiss his "Epilogue"
as a blemish, saying that "Crime and Punishment"
would be greater still without the moral tacked on. To
them, his "Epilogue" distracts us from "close reading,"
i.e. textual analysis that ignores him and all his moral-

19

istic, ideological and personal intent. However, any
reading of Dostoevsky that closes us off to his Russian
Orthodox Christianity and his Slavophile ideology is
not a "close reading" at all. It is a closed reading. To
really understand "Crime and Punishment," one has to
commit "intentional fallacy." Otherwise, one reduces
Dostoevsky to the fate of that disembodied voice named

Echo that haunted the caves of ancient Greek myth.
"The New Criticism (featuring the works of
Dostoevsky)," as well as "Identity Politics (featuring
Shakespeare)," bring to mind an Einstein quote: "It is
the theory which decides what we can observe." The
New Criticism decided that we ignore Dostoevsky lest
we commit "intentional fallacy." It decided we would
observe his texts from a standpoint of pure objectivity
lest we commit "affective fallacy." Its prescribed "close
reading" closed us in to the meanings of the texts per se.
But classics such as "Crime and Punishment" should be
read with an open mind, open to Dostoevsky, open to
our own humanity, open to the larger meaning of life.
Dostoevsky blurred the theoretical and the person-

al. His novels brim with likeminded intellectuals who
make the theoretical intensely personal, e.g.
Raskolnikov, whose "extraordinary man theory"
wreaked such havoc on his personality. Where did his
"extraordinary man theory" end, his personality
begin? His heroes refuse to stop at thinking and feel
their ideologies with deep emotion (see also Ivan

Karamazov, Prince Myshkin). The New Criticism stops
at thinking. It thinks literature, but it doesn't feel it and
doesn't want anybody to feel it. It cleanly breaks the
theoretical and the personal, dismissing as fallacious
any reader who blurs the two. Thus, it defeats a large
part of Dostoevsky's purpose: to show the connection,
sometimes tragic, between theory and personality.
The New Criticism's rigid objectivity obscures a
connection that can only be appreciated subjectively.
"The New Criticism (featuring the works of
Dostoevsky)" forced us to abandon reading as personal experience, we even jettisoned Dostoevsky himself,
so as to read and discuss his works in the vacuum that
is pure textual analysis.

RANDY GOLDSTEIN

Bursting the Bubble
progress in the Middle East than it
is a smear campaign against Israel
as a whole. Whereas liberal groups
have been unable to deceive a significant number of college students into thinking poorly of Israel based on facts, they now turn
to a movement whose underlying purpose is to equate the democratic government of Israel today with the apartheid government of South Africa in the second half of the twentieth century.
In that case, divestment by colleges and universities played
a small role in helping to topple a non-democracy whose explicitly racist laws created two distinct and legally separate social
classes. If it were the goal of divestment advocates to influence
a regime in which the law deems certain people inferior due to
some personal characteristic, perhaps their efforts would best
be focused on the vast number of Islamic countries whose laws
explicitly grant legal inferiority to non-Muslims.
Any individual who supports the divestment campaign is
implicitly putting the entire blame for the current situation on
Israel. That is, supporters want innocent Israeli citizens to
endure a blow to their already struggling economy in the hope
that such an effort will entice the Israeli government to end
what they view as human rights abuses against Palestinians.
Yet somehow when the United States imposes economic
sanctions on Iraq, Cuba, and Serbia for the same purpose, progressives complain that it is overstepping its authority and
that these countries have the right to autonomous rule.
How can divestment, a type of economic sanction, be an
appropriate action for colleges and universities when it is completely inappropriate for the most philanthropic government in
the world? One must wonder what the true intentions of the
divestment campaign are. Apart from those naively ignorant of
the facts, one must assume that supporters of divestment are
either blatantly hypocritical or anti-Semitic (please spare me
the response that Arabs are Semites).
For a myopic proponent of the divestment campaign to
claim that his or her ultimate goal is peace in the Middle East
is to reveal an inability to understand the long-term implications of such a policy.
The campaign punishes Israelis in the hope of reform and
places neither culpability nor demands on the Palestinians or
the Arab states that feed them weapons. It fails to realize that
the conflict will never be solved by assigning blame to one
party or the other, but by expecting negotiation'and concession
from both sides.
A blow to the Israeli economy by divestment could indeed
escalate the conflict. A significant part of the Palestinian economy is dependent on Israeli jobs. In times of economic hardship, one can expect Israeli firms to begin cost cutting by letting go of this expendable labor.
Furthermore, substantial Israeli monetary aid to
Palestinians could be eliminated in lieu of other, more essential
programs in the event of a government budget crisis. Indeed,
any policy which harms the economic standing of Palestinians
can only elicit anger and create further incentives for violence
in the region.
The divestment campaign is an ill-conceived strategy that
will promote turbulence in the Middle East and resentment
towards Israel. There is no conceivable way in which the policy could influence Israel's behavior for the better of the
Palestinian people.
Its true purpose is to do harm to the population of Israel, one
which is coincidentally comprised of a vast Jewish majority. It
is, to use the words of Harvard president Lawrence Summers,
"anti-Semitic in [its] effect if not [its] intent." To encourage colleges and universities to divest solely from Israel is to reveal
the very core of radical hypocrisy.

Horowitz criticizes left for ruining education in urban schools
From Horowitz, pg. 3
to the United States rather than staying in countries where
they risk having their "head sliced off with a machete."
Jessica Colman 'O5 was disturbed by Horowitz's views on
patriotism. "His whole argument is we should be proud of
our country," she said, "but it was more the necessity of
being proud than what you are proud of. It didn't seem like
there was something to be proud of."
Horowitz criticized the pacifist movement and those in
America who are questioning the possibility of war in Iraq,
asserting the view that "the natural state of human beings is

war."

He characterized pacifists as "people who tell you the
world is going to be different than it has been for 5,000
years," adding that "those people are dangerous. If you can
make heaven on earth, what crime would you not commit to
get that?"
He challenged pacifists to go to Israel or Iraq, where he
said people are killed regularly, and charged that theirviews
would be indefensible in such a situation. Colman considered this reasoning misguided, because "he seemed to be
arguing that there were only pacifists in this country, that
it's a privilege. But there are pacifists in Israel. There are

pacifists everywhere."

Horowitz portrayed the United States' decisions to war
with Iraq and support Israel against Palestine as motivated
by a greater good. He cited the United States' interventions
in Somalia, Kosovo and Afghanistan as examples of how
"the United States has risked the lives of its own citizens to
save Muslims."

"You have to get into the world to
see how it works. It's not what they
say, it's what they do."

David Horowitz
Horowitz claimed that "the Middle East conflict is not
about land, state or self-determination. [Palestinians] were
given this in 1948 and their response was to blow up babies
in their baby carriages." He added that Palestinian society
"is a sick culture. This is worse than the Nazis because the
Nazis hid their crimes." In Horowitz's opinion, America is

justified in its intervention.
While Horowitz emphasized that US intervention in the
Middle East is not inspired by oil interests, he also said "if it
wasn't for the oil, people wouldn't look at the Middle East."

Suspect caught in recent backpack thefts,
stolen Kohlberg DVD players still not found
From THEFTS, pg. 3
Redgrave noted.

Public Safety did not initially connect the various
thefts that occurred around campus in the last few weeks
of November, and Redgrave says Public Safety is still
unsure which thefts can be traced to the suspect.
Several of the thefts reported between the Nov. 20 and
25 appear to be unrelated to the backpack thefts. In one
incident, an employee at the snack bar reported an individual who snatched a box of food from an unloading
truck. Three Swarthmore students were caught in the act
and referred to the dean's office. "The 'getaway driver'
appeared to be not involved," Redgrave said.
"There's always theft," Redgrave said. "Property's
'borrowed.' It's not uncommon for someone to pick up
someone else's book bag [accidentally]. Furniture gets
'borrowed'
and it's reported as a theft."
...

"The cheap and easy way to protect
equipment is to lock them [but] we
want to still leave the rooms
available for student use."
Owen Redgrave
Public Safety Director
The couch reported stolen from LPAC and initially

rumored to have been part of the wave of theft was found
to have been simply misplaced.
Public Safety began to see a pattern of theft emerging
late on Saturday, November 23, after a number of backpack thefts had been reported. Students who were victims
of later thefts said Public Safety seemed to be taking the
problem seriously. "My backpack was taken from the top
floor of McCabe," Ursula Whitcher 'O3 said. "I reported it
pretty much the moment it happened. The Public Safety
guy was really upset, because I guess he'd been on the
floor below me at the time."
On Sunday, Nov. 24 several members of Senior
Company had their backpacks taken from LPAC (the bags

were found with the valuables removed). The students
were able to describe an individual they had seen behaving suspiciously, and the description matched that of the
individual wanted in the Collingdale shoplifting case.
Public Safety did not publish the description it
received from the Swarthmore police. Rogg found the
description that he relied on posted on the Daily Jolt; it

was compiled and posted by students. It described the suspect as a 5'9" or 5'10" Caucasian male with brown hair,
with a pierced eyebrow and a big Chinese character tattoo

20

on his neck.

Rogg said he was upset that other students had made
no effort to catch the thief. "People have told me, oh man,
I saw the kid running around. Didn't anyone think 'maybe
I should call someone?'" he asked. "This is something
someone else should have done. As a community we
should have a mutual understanding that we should look
out for each other's welfare." Rogg also felt that a description should have been publicized more widely and earlier.
"Without a description, I might have been suspicious,
because I looked the guy in the eye and I could tell he did-

n't belong here

said.

...

but I might not have done anything," he

Redgrave said that Public Safety might have put out a
photograph had the suspect not been caught as quickly as
he was and "if there was a strong enough indication that
it was the same person." Redgrave said publicizing a
photo of a suspect could raise concern about fairness. "If
it's not the right person, you're putting them perhaps
unfairly in front of the public," he said.
The Swarthmore police had not yet received a photo-

when the suspect was caught.
While no thefts have been reported since the suspect's
arrest, Public Safety is not convinced that he was responsible for the theft of DVD players from Kohlberg. The
equipment was reported stolen between Nov. 15 and 20,
but some of the players could have been missing for a
week before then.
Unlike the backpack thefts and other thefts of valuable
objects reported in the last few weeks, stealing the DVD
players would have required some tools and expertise.
According to Andrew Metherall, Media Services
Coordinator, "four of [the DVD players] were minimally
secured." They were in cabinets, which should have been,
but were not necessarily, locked. Departments have keys
graph

to the cabinets and many make copies for faculty which
sometimes get passed on to students. However, one DVD
player was secure, and, according to Metherall, "the thief
did some damage to the rack there."
Since the DVD player thefts occurred, Media Services
and Public Safety are considering various possible safety
measures. "Currently we're putting on redundant security systems" including cable locks, Metherall said. Media
Services has also changed some of its procedures: a security person now locks the cabinets at night and checks
that all equipment is present in the mornings.
While Public Safety has not yet implemented any
major changes, it is experimenting with different alarms
and more sophisticated electronic protection. Redgrave
noted that some of the rooms had a history of property

loss and that when overhead projectors were taken from
Kohlberg, the college considered locking classrooms.
"We chose not to lock them up," he said. "The cheap

Saed Atshan 'O6 felt this view was indicative of the flawed
United States' role in the Middle East.
"This is what I feel is the crucial mistake of the U.5.," Atshan
said. "The U.S. hasn't looked at the people and so it hasn't
promoted democracies, yet instead chose to support oppressive dictators for oil concerns."
Horowitz concluded his talk by advising the audience
that "you have to get into the world to see how it works. It's
reasoning behind the

not what they say, it's what they do."
Karl Heideck 'O5 responded to the lecture by saying that
"colleges compete for students, and students choose the college they wish to pay for their education. If he's unhappy
with the intellectual monopoly the university system seems
to grant to leftists, why go on the lecture circuit and rant
about it? Why not do something proactive, like founding his
own institution of higher learning? Obviously he's just not
trying hard enough. He'd rather make the buck off the
speech than actually change things."
While some who attended were excited to have the
chance to hear a conservative viewpoint on campus,
whether they agreed with all of Horowitz's opinions or not,
others were disappointed with his demeanor. Lindsay Brin
'O5 said it was not easy to be receptive to the other half of the
story, as Horowitz asked of the students, when it was presented in what she felt was an antagonistic manner.

Men's hoops off to 2-3 start
BY DEBBIE FARRELLY

dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's basketball season
got off to a bumpy yet exciting start as the
Garnet Tide went 2-3 in the first five games
of the 2002-2003 season.

The start of the season has shown off a

talented and well-balanced Garnet squad.
Three players, Matt Gustafson 'O5, David
Pearce 'O3 and Blair Haxel 'O5, have averaged more than 15 points in the first five
games of the season. In addition, point guard
Jacob Letendre 'O4 has already amassed 18

rebounds and 12 steals.
With so many individuals making such
significant offensive contributions, it is evident that the Tide have the talent necessary
to have a highly successful season. "I think,
so far, we have shown ourselves to be a fairly well-balanced team. Each player is learning early on what contributions he can make
to help this team, and as the season progresses, knowing this should really improve
our chances of winning," Pearce said.
The season's first weekend started off
strong as the team won its first two games,
which were part of the Equinox Classic.
On Friday, November 22nd, in what was
third-highest
the
scoring
game
in
Swarthmore men's-basketball history, Swat
defeated the University of the Redlands 11711L Gustafson and Pearce poured in careerhigh point totals, 33 and 32 points respectively, while six players scored in the double
digits. The high scoring can be attributed to
the squad's stratospheric 66.2 field goal percentage during the game.
The next day, Swarthmore faced
Connecticut College. Led by the consistency
of shooting from Gustafson and Haxel, Swat
jumped out to an early 10-0 lead, which the
Camels slowly cut down over the first half.
The final two minutes before halftime were
laden with foul calls and trips to the line for
both teams, but Swat walked off the court

with the 32-28 lead.
In the second half, Swarthmore immediately took control of the offensive game
behind the play of Pearce and Letendre, who

catapulted the Tide to a 16-point lead with
six minutes remaining. An eight-point run
in the final five minutes, sparked by a
charge taken by Josh Loeffler 'O3, ended any

chance of a comeback for Connecticut, and
the game ended with a final score of 64-46.
Following

the

game,

Pearce

and

Gustafson were named to the Equinox
Classic
All-Tournament
Team,
and
Gustafson was also honored as the
Centennial Conference Player of the Week.
But it was head coach Lee Wimberly who
took home the most impressive honor, as the
win versus Connecticut made him the winningest men's
basketball
coach in
Swarthmore College history.
Monday's game at Drew University in
Madison, New Jersey proved a heartbreaker
for the Garnet Tide. Swat opened with a 7-2
lead, which they were able to hold for the
majority of the game. The offense was led by
Haxel, Gustafson and Pearce, who finished
with 19, 16 and 14 points, respectively.
However, Drew went on three separate
offensive runs in the second half that the
Tide could not recover from, resulting in a
76-66 victory for the Rangers.
On Wednesday, the Tide fell to Division I
opponent Lehigh University. Despite the
loss, the team was excited to have had the
experience of playing at the NCAA Division
I level, a chance that most Div. 11l teams
never have. "Playing teams like Lehigh is a
wonderful opportunity to gain access to a
Division I opponent," Pearce said.
Sunday's matchup with the Dutchmen of
Union College rounded out the first two
weeks of the season. Swat started the game
under adverse conditions *as Haxel, who
averaged almost 16 ppg in the first four
games, was unable to play due to illness.
However, Evan Gelacek stepped in to sup-

plant Haxel's presence in the paint.
"[Blair] has worked hard in the offseason
and has really stepped up his game offensively and Evan's defensive presence in the
low post has been especially important for
our team. Their influence has added another
dimension to our team, and has made us a
stronger team at both ends of the floor,"
Pearce said.
Gelacek contributed 10 points and four
blocks to the Garnet effort, but the team was
turnedback by 61-54.
Between now and the start of the spring

semester, the men's basketball team will
nine games, including a two-game trip
to California and three Centennial
Conference games. Regardless of their current 2-3 record, David Pearce is confident
play

that the Garnet Tide will remain unabashedly optimistic for the remainder of the season.

"The team has an extremely positive, upbeat
attitude which will prove to be very important over the course of the season," he said.
"We've started to realize the amount of talent we have on this team and are very excit-

ed to begin Centennial Conference play."

Cricket, cricket, block the wicket
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

rburstel@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday afternoons, passersby on Magill Walk can
be seen craning their necks in order to observe the action
on Mertz Field. Nowhere to be seen are the Frisbee players
who typically populate the landscape. Flying discs have
been replaced by balls. Wickets have been assembled out of
planks of wood and Wawa crates. Bats, shaped like paddles
and wielded like golf clubs, have been dragged out of field

house storage for the affair. For those unfamiliar with the
game of cricket, the Saturday spectacle may seem baffling.
For the members of the newly formed Swarthmore Cricket
Club, though, cricket is a labor of love
and, in many
cases, a reminder of home.
In areas of the world touched by British colonialism,
cricket reigns supreme, according to Raghu Karnad 'O5.
"Everyone in India loves cricket; it is the equivalent of the
summed passions for baseball, basketball, football and ice
hockey in the U.5.," he said. As a native of India, Karnad
could not easily leave his national pastime behind and was
attracted to the prospect of participating in Swarthmore's

Cricket Club.
It was mainly because of the prevalence of cricket
enthusiasts such as Karnad that the Club was originally
conceived of at a Deshi meeting earlier this year. But since
its birth at the beginning of the semester, organizers have
been pleased to discover that it isn't just seasoned veterans
of the game who want to bowl and bat. Game organizers
are doing their best to accommodate the positive response
they've received from unexpected quarters. "Here at Swat,
we play beginner-friendly cricket," said Cricket Club coor-

22

dinator Shiva Thiagarajan 'O5. "At Swat it's different
because back home in India everyone is pretty good. More

played a role in inspiring passion for the sport, saying,
"Ex-colonies have effectively taken possession of [cricket]

importantly they know all the rules and think like cricketers, and so the game is totally different."
But this difference should not be perceived as a negative, according to club participants. The informality of
play and the element of basic instruction that define the
Swarthmore brand of the game are perceived as an asset

from the colonizer."
In this way, cricket serves as a unifying force for some
post-colonial states, Thiagarajan agrees. But, he said, such
an assessment should not imply that camaraderie is the
norm for all such countries, even if individual players
value the athletic competition above all politically gener-

by

cricket newcomers who are picking up the rules as they
go, wicket by wicket, each and every Saturday afternoon.
Bernadette Baird-Zars 'O6, a self-described cricket novice,
explained that the Cricket Club provided her with an
opportunity to play and learn a sport that she had always
admired, but never understood. "The first time I saw real
cricket played was when I was visiting India and everywhere people were chucking balls at the ground," she said.
"Even before I traveled, I always wanted to play cricket,
but there weren't many teams in rural West Virginia and
Texas," Baird-Zars added.
Now that she has a venue for playing the sport with
people well versed in the game and its legacy, Baird-Zars is

ated rivalries. "India-Pakistan games are very dramatic
affairs, and things get quite emotional, but the players are
all very friendly and brotherly, and go on TV together saying stuff like 'We are sportsmen. Let's keep politics out of
sports,'" Thiagarajan said. Despite protests from the fans
and teams, the Indian and Pakistani governments have
prohibited play between the two states, perhaps indicating
the extent to which colonial states have adopted what was
once a sign of British dominance as their own sign of
aggression toward political enemies.
Luckily for the students who routinely make the
Saturday afternoon pilgrimage to the Mertz field when the
weather's good and the ground not too soggy, and the field

beginning to appreciate both the complexity of how cricket is played and the complicated history surrounding its

house when the weather and field conditions are bad, none

introduction into the British colonial world. "I think the
colonial history of cricket does make modern games more
charged and political, especially when the colonized started to play the colonizer," said Baird-Zars.
Given Great Britain's poor cricket showing in recent
years, many have hailed victories in the sport by former
colonial territories as a liberating mechanism for the people living in such regions. While he questions this argument's legitimacy, Karnad explained that colonialism has

of these animosities is present at Swat. The only controversy among this crowd of cricketers is why cricket hasn't
caught on in America. Thiagarajan says cricket "is too
slow," while Karnad contends that because "there is no
trading of players," cricket "must have little critical appeal
to [America's] capitalist souls." Whatever the case, every
Saturday afternoon participants in the Swarthmore
Cricket Club are doing their small part to make sure that
the game is considered not an oddity, but an essential part

of the American sporting world.

First-years help propel Garnet
Tide to 2-0 conference record
From BASKETBALL, pg. 24
Though the team's youth had been pointed to as a
weak spot early on, the upperclassmen on the
team see it as a strength.
"I think having so many young players is an asset,"
Furman said. "They walk into every game with the
same intensity and focus."
Lee referred to a similar comment made by Furman
in the huddle going into the Bryn Mawr game. "We
don't all know what to expect going into any given
game because we don't know the history," Lee said.
"We bring the same energy and focus to McDaniel that
we do to a game against a team like Bryn Mawr, and
that helps us play our game and not be concerned with
the other team's game."
The Tide's game intensity produced a 20-0 opening
run against the struggling Bryn Mawr Owls. The
Garnet defense conceded only 14 points for the first 30
minutes of play. Despite the presence of former
possible

Swarthmore assistant coach Rebecca CusumanoSeidel at the helm of the visiting team, the Garnet
paced out a 61-25 win.
A key factor in the Garnet's early success has been
the increased presence of underclassmen on the court.
The Bryn Mawr matchup highlighted three careerbest performances by underclassmen. Ali Wolff 'O5 has

THE

PHOENIX

started all four games for the Tide as a significant
points contributor. The forward had a career-high 15
points against Bryn Mawr.
"Ali Wolff has been playing with a lot of confidence
this season," said Robinson. "She's been shooting really well."
First-year sensation Zoey Adams-Deutch 'O6 had a
career-high 13 points and four assists. Also a new
starter, the rookie has become a core component of
the team.
"Zoey has all the tools and the mindset to be come
one of the key players on the team." Furman said.
Lee agreed, "Zoey's gaining confidence in our system. She's good at improvising, and Bryn Mawr
allowed her the opportunity to really drive to the bas-

ket."
With the team starting to gel, the Tide will finish
out the first part of their season with two tough road
trips. This weekend the team will travel to Wellesley
College for the annual Seven Sisters Tournament

before heading to Washington College the following
Tuesday for a double-header match up with the

Swarthmore men.
The future looks good for the defending Seven
Sisters champions, with the possibility of a repeat
championship very high. "We definitely have a great
chance of bringing the trophy home again," Lee said.
December 5, 2002

The women's swimming team improved
its stock in the Centennial Conference in
recent weeks by posting consecutive victories over conference foes Bryn Mawr and
McDaniel.
The men's squad, meanwhile, is in the
midst of a three-match winning streak dating back to its Nov. 16 match versus
Franklin and Marshall. With victories over
Franklin and Marshall and McDaniel, the
Tide have perched themselves atop the
Centennial Conference in a first-place tie
with Gettysburg.
Most recently, the men's team defeated
NCAA Division II Kutztown, 112-93, on Nov.
26. Co-captains Mike Dudley 'O3 and David
Whitehead 'O3 paced the team with two
individual victories apiece. Dudley placed
first in the 200-yard IM and 200-yard breaststroke, and Whitehead placed first in the
100-yard and 200-yard freestyle. The two
seniors combined with fellow captain John
Lillvis 'O3 and Eric Shang 'O4 to capture the
400-yard medley relay in 3:4198.
In its final match before the Thanksgiving
holiday, the women's team dominated Bryn
Mawr, 146-95. The match featured five
Garnet double-winners, as Davita BurkheadWeiner 'O3, Tara Trout 'O4, Leah Davis 'O4,
Kathryn Stauffer 'O5 and Patricia Funk 'O6
propelled the Garnet to victory.
Both the men's and women's teams
hope to close out the first half of the winter
season this weekend with a good showing
at the Eastern College Athletic Conference
tournament held at the Gloucester Institute
of Technology. During Winter Break, the
teams will train in Puerto Rico to prepare for
the Centennial Conference Championships
in February. Conference play resumes for
the teams on Feb. 1 with matches against
Gettysburg, a perennial conference powerhouse.

Josh's ruined
Thanksgiving
From LOEFFLER, pg. 24
passing only when the move they have made does not
result in a shot.
This kind of basketball used to be found almost solely
in the NBA. The college game used to develop players.
The youngsters would sit and learn until they were ready
to get on the court and contribute. But in this era of college ball, sitting a talented, clueless youngster means losing games, or losing that player to another school where
the talent will be showcased more readily. So, rather
than face these types of losses, coaches are forced to play

the inexperienced and unprepared.
And we, the college basketball fans, are left to suffer.
We suffer as the talented high school players declare for
the draft, and the talented underclassmen of the college
ranks leave school early for the pros. We suffer because
the system has changed, leaving no time for player
growth or any continuity in a program. We suffer
because the system is flawed. It is ruining my holidays.

Turkeyball Garnet romp Bryn Mawr
Thanksgiving weekend is my favorite of the year. This

should come as no surprise to any of you, given that I am a
notorious face stuffer and couch potato. Thanksgiving provides the perfect outlet for a person like me; all I have to do
is sit back, watch the tube and eat. It all seems so perfect. I
switch from turkey to pie, from football to basketball.
Every year it just does not get much better than turkey day
weekend. Until now.
Unfortunately for sports
fans across the nation, this
Thanksgiving's
athletic
broadcasts proved absolutely unfulfilling. There was little to nothing on the television that passed for a good
game. I cannot hold football
responsible. Tradition holds
that the Cowboys and Lions
must play on the big day,
and recent tradition holds
that the two squads must
suck. I cannot hold the NBA
responsible either. In fact,
JOSH LOEFFLER
professional
basketball
made the most concerted
Riding the Pine
effort to put a fantastic game
on the screen. It was not
David Stern's fault that the
Dallas Mavericks suddenly forgot how to shoot a basketball
against the Pacers. No, none of these organizations should
have to shoulder the blame for the dismal viewing days I
encountered. Instead, my wrath shall turn to my dear old
friend college basketball. College basketball, I'm not sure I
even know who you are anymore.
Do not get me wrong. I love college basketball. I love the
fever, the frenzy, the rivalries, the hustle and the heart. But
we are talking about a game that is now seriously flawed.
The rumors have been out there for a while now: the players are too inexperienced; the coaches do not have time to
teach these kids properly; the game is all about athleticism
and not skill; the talent pool is getting shallower and shallower. I guess it just took until this weekend for me to finally realize that, for the most part, the rumors of college bas-

rely on athletic instinct and ability to carry them through

not even run an offense anymore. Even the motion set,
which relies on individual creativity and a player's ability

Down 30-26 going into the intermission, the Tide turned
on the heat with 22 second-halfpoints from Robinson. The
defending champions from McDaniel were unprepared
for Swarthmore's intense press, turning over the ball 24

Just four games into the season, the Swarthmore

women's basketball team has already set the tone for
another fast-paced Garnet Centennial campaign, now
leading the East division of the conference with a 2-0
Centennial record. After.a 1-1 opening weekend at the
Swarthmore Tip-off Tournament, the team headed to
Westminster, MD in a repeat match-up of last year's conference finals. Swarthmore beat McDaniel 70-60 before
dominating Bryn Mawr 61-25 on Tuesday.
"We're taking things game-by-game," said Kristen Lee
'O5. "Things are starting to come together, and the team is
in a good place right now."
