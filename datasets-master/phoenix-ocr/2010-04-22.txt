Sestak vies for long-held senatorial seat
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu
When Jenn Medeiros 'll was rushed

to the hospital last November after collapsing on the night the old health care
bill was put to a vote
Congressman Joe Sestak took time to
check up on her wellbeing.
"During this historic process, he was
in the House of Representatives and
before he went on the floor to speak for
the bill, he was e-mailing the youngest
person on his staffand saying, 'How are
you doing? How are you feeling?'" said
Medeiros, who is a former junior member ofhis campaign staff.
What really impressed Medeiros,
though, was Sestak's personal visit to
the hospital. "I was in my hospital
room a couple days later still recoverWhat he
ing and he just showed up
does is really about the people; he really does care about individual people,"

she said.

Representative
Congressional District of Pennsylvania
since 2007, Sestak is now running
against incumbent Senator Arlen
Specter of 30 years in the May 18
Pennsylvania Primaries. The winner of
the Democratic primary will face
Republican candidate Pat Toomey, who
lost six years ago in the Republican
nomination to Specter, for a seat in the
U.S. Senate.
"I believe that what is most harmful
to this nation is the lack of trust that
citizens now feel in Washington D.C.
and elected officials there," Sestak said.
"I want to become a public servant as
the next U.S. Senator and gain the trust
of Pennsylvanians."
Just a year ago, incumbent Specter
switched to the Democratic Party after
serving 30 years in the Senate as a
Republican and gained full support

from President Barack
According to' the New York Times,
Specter is currently leading Sestak in
the polls, yet neck-to-neck with Toomey.
Swarthmore has maintained a close
connection with Sestak ever since his
candidacy to run for Congress back in
2006. Having already made numerous
appearances on campus, Sestak came to
campus in October of 2008 before his
reelection for a town hall meeting to
debate Republican challenger Craig
Williams. Students have also canvassed
and worked at the phone bank for his
campaign.

"He has a longstanding and really
amazing relationship with the College
Democrats. I've met with him several
times and have always had a positive
experience," former College Democrats
president Molly Weston 'lO said.
Currently, however, the College
Democrats are not endorsing either
Sestak or Specter. According to College
Democrats President Natalie Litton 'l2,
it is against their policy to endorse candidates during primaries.

Next month, state representative Joe Sestak, whose constituency includes Swarthmore,
will challenge incumbent Arlen Specter for a Senate Seat in the Democratic primary.

can get excited about," Medeiros said.
"I've always believed in Joe Sestak
and thought that he was an excellent
candidate, an excellent Democrat, and
an excellent person," said Doug
Gilchrist-Scott 'O9, who worked in
Sestak's district office last year and
was part of College Democrats.
Sestak decided to run for Congress
when his daughter, who was diagnosed
with brain cancer five years ago, was
told that she only had a few months to
live. In office, Sestak was driven by his
and his daughter's experience with the
health care system to take a particular
interest in our substandard health care
system, targeting to reform those
issues throughout his congressional
career.
"It's what drove me into Congress,"
Sestak said. "I wrote her a letter when
we voted for the health care bill and
said, 'Dear Alex, tonight I am voting on
the bill that your bravery sent me to
Congress to do and now all children
will have the benefit to match your
bravery to do what you did.'"
At an open town hall meeting last
summer in a Philadelphia church,
Sestak encouraged all in attendance to
challenge the current heath care system. According to Medeiros, he told
everyone in the church, "I'm here, I'm
on the stage, ask me anything. I'm not
leaving until everyone here who has a
question or concern has had it
answered or addressed."
The meeting lasted from around 6
p.m. to sometime after midnight.
According to Medeiros, at the end of
the night, Sestak was still out on the
sidewalk answering questions.
"That is a classic example of him
really going above and beyond what is
expected of a member of Congress,"
Medeiros said. "And that really speaks
the
kind
of
volumes
about
Congressman he is and the kind of
Senator he would be."
Last summer, after interning at the
Sestak campaign, Medeiros was promoted to a full-time position as a junior
member of the campaign staff to deal
mostly with communications. Working
closely with Sestak, she developed a

April 22, 2010

close relationship with the congressman.
"He's the most hardworking, driven
person that I've ever met. I know that he
takes a lot of heat for being tough on people who work for him, but he never asks
of anybody anything that he wouldn't do
himself," she said.
The intensity of Sestak's education
and profession before serving on
Congress gives insight into his drive.
Graduating second in his class from the
U.S. Naval Academy, Sestak went on to
Harvard University to obtain both his
master's and doctoral degrees. Then for
31 years, he served in the U.S. Navy,
reaching the status of a three-star admiral and becoming the highest ranking former military officer to ever serve in
Congress, Weston said.
"I learned in the U.S. Navy that you're
not only responsible for the sailors and
achieving in how to achieve a mission
but that you're accountable for them,"
Sestak said. "I will work extremely hard
with a lot of energy but in the most honest, accountable way, because I believe
that you can't just be responsible, you
must be willing to be heldaccountable for
what you say you're going to try to do."
One of the biggest obstacles for Sestak
in preparation for the upcoming primary
is getting his name and story out there,
Gilchrist-Scott said.
With the $5 million that Sestak has on
reserve for television advertisements, he
finally released his first ad this past
Tuesday, with primarily biographically
focused content.
Since the incumbent has been a senator for three decades already, Sestak does
not have as much recognition as Specter.
However, Sestak and his campaign staff
are working very hard to reach out to as
many PA residents as possible before the
primary.

"If he could meet everybody in
Pennsylvania face-to-face, I guarantee he
would do it," Medeiros said. "He really
goes all over the place and meets all kinds
of different groups

...

and works tireless-

ly."

StuCo prepares elections,

BY LINDA HOU

to postpone decisions until the
rollover amount can be determined.

A Q&A session for StuCo candidates originally planned for yesterday was changed to today because of
conflicts with the freshmen lottery
last night.
Financial Policy Representative
Dan Symonds 11 asked whether the
deadline for platforms should be
extended if there were not enough
competitors. Rojas said extension
should only occur if there are no candidates at all. Symonds, however,
said that he thought that this way,

Picnic tables
Before the meeting, StuCo
expressed interest in getting picnic
tables behind Sharpies. Burson said
that the cost per picnic table would
be between $l,OOO and $4,000. This
cost is due to ground treatment for
the tables.
"It's hilly there, so it would be
expensive to even out the ground and
put down crushed stone under the
tables to take care of drainage
issues," Burson said in an e-mail.
Burson said that funding is currently not available for the tables,
and discussions with Grounds and
Dining Services will be necessary
before any other actions are taken.

"People can look at the ballot and
say 'Oh, I can beat them,' and they
can run," Symonds said.

StuCo President Rachel Bell 'lO
and others said that this was unfair,
and the group decided against extensions unless there are no candidates.
There were no extensions. All candidates' platforms can be read on
Page 18, 19 and 20 of The Phoenix.
Voting will take place between April
23 and April 28.
StuCo pay
Since results from a previous survey asking for student opinion on
paying StuCo members were deemed
suggested
inconclusive,
StuCo
adding a referendum to the StuCo
election ballot to ask students about
their opinion on StuCo pay.
Groups
Student
Advisor
Benjamin Francis 'l2 suggested that
they should allow students to pick
more than one option, and the group
agreed. Changing the question was
also discussed, but no conclusion
was reached. The winner will be
based on plurality, which means that
the option receiving the most votes
wins.
Rojas wanted to have an informational segment attached to the ballot
explaining the role of StuCo and the
meaning of StuCo pay. The group
decided to have each StuCo member
write up a paragraph explaining
their thoughts on the issue and to
have those paragraphs appear on the
ballot.
Rollover money
Bell raised the question of what to
do with this year's rollover fund.
Last year, rollover funds in SBC went
to a green fund and a textbook fund.
Symonds said that Wesleyan
University had started a studentinvested endowment which raised
money for the school while the rest of
the school's endowment decreased in
value. Rojas suggested a competition
between student groups to come up
with proposals to improve the school
with the fund. Symonds also suggested a- StuCo grant, but Educational
Policy Representative Esther Burson
'lO disagreed.
"I would feel really uncomfortable
with all this money going to one person. This should go to something that
benefits everyone instead of just one
individual," Burson said.
Bell agreed and the group decided

Book exchange
Symonds talked
to Provost
Constance Hungerford last summer
to propose a book exchange program.
The program would encourage students to loan books to each other for
a semester by insuring them. The
insurance would be paid partly by
StuCo and the other by students.
Symonds said Hungerford encouraged them to follow through and said
she would help. Symonds also said
that StuCo should begin the project
with a few departments first, adding
that he had already talked to the education department, which expressed
interest in the idea. The departments
would ask students to sign up online
for the program.
Bell expressed the concern that
students who would loan their books
will instead just sell them.
Symonds said that the program is
for people who don't want to sell
their books but leave their books
untouched for semesters.
"Part of this program is to have a
really good campaign to convince
them why they want to give their
books away and that their books
would come back safely. I think [it
could be perceived] as a class issue,"
Symonds said.
Movie night
Burson said that the movie committee may not have enough money
in their budget to fund both "Up" and
"The Wiz," the two movies planned
for StuCo's movie night on May 2 at 7
p.m.

Bell said, however, that the movie
committee told StuCo that funding
was short last year, but, in the end,
StuCo was able to show two films.
Posters have already been printed for
the event. StuCo members will sign
up to serve popcorn.

After results from a survey sent
by StuCo indicated a strong preference for the introduction of a Sunday
breakfast, Bell 'said that she talked to

Professor revitalizes endangered languages
BY LINDA HOU

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

By 2100, over half of the world's languages could be gone. According to
associate professor and chair of the

linguistics
department K. David
Harrison, the disappearance of those
languages will bring with them the
loss of important cultures and knowledge.
To help preserve this knowledge,
Harrison and the Living Tongues
Institute for Endangered Languages,
founded by him, along with alumnus

Matthew Thomas 'O9 and his iPhone
applications company BoCoSoft Inc.,
launched the first talking dictionary
an endangered language
for Tuvan
as an iPhone application named the
Tuvan Talking Dictionary in March.
This iPhone app, Harrison said, is
only the first one of a series that he
hopes to launch.
He and his students are working on
talking dictionaries and eventually
iPhone applications for other endangered languages he has studied, including Matugar Panau, Chamacoco, Siletz
Deeni, Sora, Ho and Aka.
"With endangered languages, one
language dies every two weeks, but
almost one million iPhones on average
have been sold every two weeks (over
the past year). Thanks to the Tuvan
Talking Dictionary app, the Tuvan language now has the potential to be
instantly available to over 40 million
devices world-wide," said Thomas,
who is both the founder and president
of BoCoSoft, in an e-mail. "One app can
make a difference."
Harrison's said that his ultimate
goal is to have his model serve as an
example that others can follow in
studying and revitalizing endangered
languages. Eventually, he added, he
would like to set up a database of
endangered languages on the Internet.
"If you look at Wikipedia or Google
translator, Wikipedia has entries in
271 languages, but there are 7000 languages in the word," Harrison said.
"My idea is to have some of those other
languages and to bring them into the
bigger companies like Wikipedia."
Harrison said that having the lan,-:,AT*T

guages available on the Internet or
iPhones as talking dictionaries gives
these languages a chance to survive.
"Every language has a different
knowledge package. We're losing a
part of the human knowledge base
when we lose a language. The idea is to
have an environment where all languages can thrive," Harrison said.
"Having linguistic diversity is good for
all of humanity."
In 2007, Harrison published a book
discussing the effects of language

Die: The Extinction of the World's
and the Erosion of Human
Knowledge," for which he went on
"The Colbert Report."
The application is based on a talking dictionary developed earlier by
Harrison and Director of the Living
Tongues Institute for Endangered
Languages Gregory D. S. Anderson.
Harrison is the Director of Research at
the Living Tongues Institute.
Harrison began to study Tuvan, a
Turkic language spoken by the Tuvan
people, in 1998 for his dissertation.
The majority of Tuvan speakers
live in the Tuva Republic in Russia.
Harrison currently teaches the only
course on Tuvan outside of the republic. He then published a dictionary of
the language, one in the U.S. for sale
and one for free in Tuva. In 2006,
Harrison set up a talking dictionary
online for the language.
Through his self-developed method
of identifying language hotspots,
Harrison, along with the Living
Tongues Institute, has also traveled
around the world to study more endangered languages. Harrison will recount
his encounters with some of the
world's last speakers of their languages in a new book to be published
in December by National Geographic.
The Living Tongues Institute is also
working with National Geographic in
the Enduring Voices Project, a global
collaborative in researching and reviLanguages

talizing endangered languages.
"It's seeing the endangerment of
language as a global issue and trying
to collaborate with people in these
communities rather than coming into
as linguists and 'fixing their prob-

manager of The Enduring
Voices Project.
One of the students working
Harrison in his Endangered Language
Lab is Michael Roswell 'IL He spent
last summer studying Muniche in
Amazonian Peru. At the time of his
visit, there were fewer than 10 people
in the city ofMuniche who knew more
than ten words of the language.
Roswell is working on a talking dictionary for the language as his thesis

project.

"There's not an obvious one-sizefits-all approach for this," Roswell
said. "I think to some extent just building a new database and putting a
dataset with different goals was a way
to make the technology of this work."
Alexandra Israel 'lO is another of
Harrison's students. Israel works at
Harrison's lab transcribing Yokwoim,
a language spoken in Papua New
Guinea. She is also currently taking
his class "Structure of Tuvan."
"Professor Harrison is a really nice
he's my adviser, my professor
guy
and my boss. Working with him is really cool partly because the nature of his
work is so fascinating. You're working
with a language that's never been
recorded and transcribed before," she
said. Israel will spend the summer in
Novgorod, Russia, to study the revitalization of Tatar, another Turkic language.

"Researching endangered languages

is a really vital area for linguistic
research and research in general,"
Israel said. "I think it's often overlooked, but hopefully, in some small
way, I'm helping to change that."

"We also look for diversity
and try to make sure that we
have a good proportion of
community colleges,
Ivy
League schools, and public
and private colleges," Keisha
Senter, director of CGI U, said.
CGI U provides students
with brainstorming opportunities, lectures, panel discussions and advice from specialists, as well as the chance to
communicate
with other
young activists.
"It was just a really good
place to talk to other students
who had similar ideas for initiatives," Downing said.
Pak said that exchanging
ideas with other activists was
the most valuable part of the
conference. "I thought it was a
great opportunity for socially
conscious groups across the
world. There were even older
people too, like graduate students, and leaders of other
organizations. We were able

to
network and communicate with them."
...

The attendees of the conference observed panel discussions about activism and
broke into small groups of
about 10 people, called working sessions, to talk about
"ideas that they had had, topics that had been running
through the discussions,"
Chester said.
Panelists included former
President Bill Clinton, Usher
and Surgeon General Regina
Benjamin. Senter said that
most specialists held office
hours, which allowed them to
meet one on one with students.
Pak, Chester and Downing
said that they have come
away from CGI U with new
goals for the future of the
Global Health Forum but
added that so far their plans
have not been solidified.
Downing described their
current campaign as good but
in need of change.
"We try to do a lot of education [about malaria] on campus, we do fundraising for bed
nets. Bed nets are on the most
cost-effective and the best
malaria prevention tools

available
right
now,"
Downing said.
Global Health Forum and
its partner organizations have
no overhead or administrative costs, so all donated
money goes to buying bed
nets. "You wouldn't think this
would be unusual, but it is,"
she said.
When people donate, they
have the option to sign a letter
to a state representative that
mentions their contribution,
which the group hopes will
encourage them to take the
letter writing campaign seri-

ously.

"The letters say that they
have paid $5, so it shows
politicians that issues of global health are important to
their constituents. This isn't
really a political issue, it's a

humanitarian

issue,"

Downing said.
Most of the bed nets have
been donated so far to one particular chiefdom in Sierra
Leone, but they will probably
soon choose a new area to
sponsor because that chiefdom is "pretty much covered,"
Downing said. They may
move their efforts to India,
Nigeria or another location.

"One of the things you're
always told as part of a social
justice organization is that
you should be trying to work
yourself out of a job, so that's
what we're trying to do
to
become less and less necessary," Downing said.
Pak agreed that their methods were in need of change.
"We know that we have to
make our plans and discuss
the issues better. We will
maybe expand our initiative
to different parts of the world,
because other organizations
work in parts of the world
besides Africa
but we
haven't decided anything concrete yet," he said.
The students said that they
were very enthusiastic about
the people they met over the
weekend, from the other
attendees and panelists to Dr.
Gwenn McLaughlin 'Bl, the
Swarthmore alumna and
University of Miami professor
who hosted them in her
house.
Other students had to pay
for rooms in hotels. "She was
terrific, and it was great that
we got to take advantage of
the Swat alumni network that
way," Chester said.

Deciding on graduate school

Applying to graduate or professional school can be an interesting exciting
tedious and overwhelming process, but there are many helpful people
and
resources at Swarthmore to advise you including faculty, Career Services
and
the
pre-med/pre-law advisor, Gigi Simeone. Deciding to attend graduate
school
requires careful thought. Ask yourself:
� Do I really love the field enough to obtain an advanced degree?
� Is an advanced degree required to enter a particular profession or advance

within the field?

� Do I have the financial resources to cover the cost of graduate school?
� Do I need to take some time off from school because I am burned out?
� Am I postponing making a tough decision about a career by going to gradate school?

children. Undergraduate loans are typically deferred while you are in graduate
school. If you are certain about a career path which requires an advanced degree
choosing to go to graduate school right away will allow you to
enter the profession
sooner than if you took some time off.
Most people who plan to wait a year to explore options actuaUy wait
two or
more years. Senior year is so busy many students are unable to do a
thorough
graduate school search, so having a year to
"shop" around for a school/program
that is best for you would be to your advantage. Exploring
during the faU after
graduation is common, but by then, one finds it best to have the experience
of a
full year of work and exploration before sitting
down to do a highly competitive
application. If you decide to delay grad school admission, consider a postgraduate
work-related fellowship, a post-graduate internship, or a wide range of employment options Career Services and the Fellowship & Prizes office can
help Before
leaving campus, be sure to ask faculty to write letters of
recommendation
on your
behalf- you can set up a file in Career Services and ask faculty to update
the letters in the future.
-

� Do I want to go to school full time or part time?
� Do I have the personal qualities and skills that are needed to be successful in
graduate school?
� What is the opportunity cost for me? Will it change over time?

� What is the cost benefit of attending graduate school in non
financial terms?

When to attend?

Once you have decided that you want to go to graduate school, you need to consider when to attend. Although approximately 90% of Swarthmore College graduates pursue one or more advanced degrees, only about 20% of the
senior class
enrolls in graduate programs immediately
following graduation Most
Swarthmore graduates work for a year or more before beginning an
advanced
degree. There are pros and cons to both choices.
Choosing to attend graduate school immediately allows for a
continuity of your
education which may be advantageous since you will stiU be in "studying
mode
Many students also find it easier to finance graduate school when
there are no
other major financial pressures in their lives such as marriage, mortgages and
"

Timeline

If you hope to enroll in a graduate program the September immediately after
graduation, ideally you wiU begin your graduate school search in
the summer
before your senior year. Application deadlines
for September admission will be
between the first of December and mid-January for most competitive programs
Deadlines to apply for financial aid including assistantships and fellowships are
often earlier. It is best if you apply (with absolutely aU admission materials
submitted) at least a fuU month before the deadline—sooner if possible. 50% of applicants apply in the last month and to improve your competitiveness you need to get
your application considered before the rush. Most
schools admit students on a
rolling basis and it is best to apply when all of the slots and all of
the financial aid
awards are still available. If you wait until the last month, you are competing
with
most of the applicant pool, but with only half of the slots still available

College debate team hosts 40 schools for nationals

Approximately 300 students from

Avi performed a few covers,
along with a number of her original songs including "Just You and
Me," "Honey Bee," and "Poppy."
"Honey Bee" sweetly narrates the
romance between two nonconformists, but Avi transcends any
sort of stereotypical cuteness
with "Poppy," which reflects on
the loss of a lover to heroin.
"I love [Avi's] voice. It is very
unique," Claris Chang, the vocalist of Chang&Chang, said. "She
could make her angle very cutesy,
but she definitely has a bit of a
dark side to her music, and it
gives her music an edge."
Avi writes all of her song

from her interactions with other
people.

"I love people. I love hearing

Actors take on provocative drama in new setting
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY

QUITTERIE GOUNOT

qgounotl@swarthmore.edu
You probably walk through this
place every day, yet you might not even
know its name: Cosby Courtyard, that
small, grassy courtyard between
Parrish and Kohlberg. This coming
weekend, this inconspicuous setting

will become the stage for a student performance of "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?"
Peering into the intimacy of a living
room, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"
centers around two couples with complex histories. George (Dustin Trabert
'10) is a college professor and Martha
(Lori Barkin 'l2) is his wife, the daughter of the college president. Over the
course of 23 years of marriage they
have had their share of disappoint-

ments.

Enter Nick (Brian Huser 13), a new
hotshot professor, and Honey (Jessie
Cannizzaro 12), his wife. At first
glance, Nick and Honey seem like a perfectly happy young couple. However,
when they accept George and Martha's
late night invitation to their home after
a social function, they do not know
what they are getting themselves into.
"The big thing is the way [Nick and
Honey] are drawn into the web of our
lives," Trabert, as George, said.
The play has been challenging for its
four-actor cast, who have remarked on
the physical effects of their difficult
roles. "My voice has gotten deeper
because of this play," Barkin said.
Huser noted that "the way [he] walks
has changed."
Part of the challenge has been playing characters in a character-driven,
four-person play who are so radically

different from the actors. As George,
Trabert must portray a 46-year-old who
looks 50 and whose life is falling apart.
He and Barkin (Martha) must portray
middle-aged people with years of accumulated frustration. Cannizzaro, as
Honey, is a mousy character who
strives to put up the front of a good
housewife, while she struggles with her
husband's neglect and her own inner
turmoil.
As for Nick, Huser must "play a
smug guy who is terrible to his wife and
does terrible things," according to
director James Robinson 10.
Although it may seem grim, "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is actually a
comedy, filled with masterful one-liners, slapstick and physical humor.
Beyond the apparent darkness of the
plot, kinship and caring give the play
depth and charm.
"It's so messed up, but it's beautiful," Robinson said. "On the surface,
[the characters] aren't beautiful people,
they aren't polished, they are rough
but deep down, there is kindness and
decency and warmth."
"It's uncompromising. It's not sentimental; it's exhilarating and in your
face," Robinson added.
Written in 1962, the play lifts the veil
on subjects like gender, marriage and
morality. "It's deconstructing [the
stereotype of] the housewife as a goddess of the domestic space, vacuuming
in pearls," Barkin said.
Although awarded the Pulitzer Prize
in its day, "Who's Afraid of Virgina

Columbia University trustees who oversaw it. The play was deemed controversial and vulgar in its use of"bad words"

provocative piece, but in a different
way.

"What remains shocking now has
more to do with content: characters
being pushed into spaces they're not
comfortable in," Robinson said.
Perhaps one of the most innovative
aspects of this weekend's performance
will be its location. Robinson has chosen the Cosby Courtyard, in front of
Kohlberg, a location never before used
for such a purpose.
"I wanted a place that would do the
play justice, that would take it out of
the representation of just being in a liv-

ing room," he said.
While the courtyard has walls that
give it the feeling of an interior space, it
is also outdoors. Its place in the heart of
campus is symbolic for a play dealing

with academia.
From its creative location to its fourperson cast to its blend of tragedy and
comedy, this performance of "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is an ambitious enterprise in every way.
It will be performed Thursday,
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. in the

Mixing the power of dance with personal stories
BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

As the end of the spring
semester approaches, with
finals and classes coming to a
close, the departments of
music and dance will present
the culminating work that the
students have done over the
past semester.
This year's Spring Student
Dance Concert will consist of
the usual batch of African
dance, flamenco, Kathak, tap

and
However, this year will also
include a couple of student-initiated projects that will
explore different forms of
dance as well as personal identities and heritages.
One of these student projects is junior Amelia Kidd's
exploration of classical and
neoclassical forms of ballet.
She will perform three variations of ballet.
The first is taken from the
opening of "Sleeping Beauty,"
in which Aurora is christened
by six fairy godmothers.
Called the "Hummingbird"
variation, Kidd hopes

explore the dance meant to
express the gift of temperament given to Aurora.

The second variation is
taken from another classic,
"Swan Lake." Performing a
famous "pas de deux" from Act
3 in which the villain Von
Rothbart deceives the prince
with Odile, who looks like the
main character Odette. The
only difference is that Odile
wears black while Odette
wears white.
Kidd's third number will
examine the very nature of
these two variations in a piece
that will attempt to merge the
two into an original piece.
This piece will incorporate
both classical and neoclassical
types of ballet as inspired by
the works of Marius Pepita,

In addition to these personal works, this year's spring
concert will include a new
work by Professor Sharon
Friedler entitled "Solas an

lae," which is Gaelic for daylight.

Friedler's work will explore
the beauty of the contrast
between light and dark in the
Irish landscape and includes
sculptures by Philip Stern,
whose sculptures play with
representations of the human

form.
"The crystalline yet saturated quality of light; the
strength and variation of wind
and wave currents; and the
length of dense shadows I've
experienced along the coast in
Northern Ireland were initial
motivators for this dance,"
Friedler said in an e-mail.
Once again mixing student
talent with faculty experience,
the spring dance concert is
shaping up to be a very meaningful event that hopes to do
more than entertain, but to
also enlighten those who
attend.
The personal experiences of
the performers have inspired
unique pieces, and the concert
will highlight the performers'
innovative ways of expressing
themselves through dance.

that he bought during high school. "The sneakers are
from Nike," he said.
Sticking to mainly purples and blues, Bryant infuses
bright colors into his outfit. With summer just around
the corner, it's time to pack up the dark colors and
hone
in on the great colors of spring and summer clothing.
Bryant hits the mark with his combination of his purple
jacket and similarly hued plaid shirt. Though a relatively simple outfit of a shirt, jeans and jacket, Bryant creates something quite unique with strong purple palette.

How He Describes His Style:
"I just kind of wear what fits," Bryant said. "I don't
really care that much about what's in season, what's out
of season. I just wear what's me." Bryant tends to steer
clear of following trends, focusing more on how the
clothes fit him and the interesting, unique aspects of the

items he buys.
Bryant understands how your personal style can say
much about one's personality. "I take a lot of pride in
how I look and in how I come off to people," he added.
He tries not to dress too flashy and always tries to
look presentable. For the most part, Bryant definitely
enjoys wearing strong, 'abnormal" colors, with purple
being his favorite.

his brother's similar style, which is
wearing "what fits and what you want

He also draws inspiration from style
icons like Kanye West and Sean Combs,
also known as P. Diddy "I think Kanye

more interesting than I could ever think of," Bryant
said. He especially likes Diddy's classic
black tie look.

"It's probably one of my favorites." He also
loves his button down, Dolce & Gabbana shirt

Wardrobe Staples:
"I feel like I can always depend on my jeans,"
Bryant said. Jeans are definitely a staple for
many people, as they can easily be made casual or
dressy.
My jeans are always a staple," he said.

THE PHOENIX

StaffEditorial

The Phoenix articulates role as campus newspaper
At times during the semester, The
Phoenix has given in to demands to with-

hold sensitive information, especially students' names, from news stories both in
print and on the website. Without communicating a clear policy to the community,
confusion about The Phoenix's role and its
policies persists, forcing us to make uncomfortable decisions in individual situations.
For this reason we want to articulate how
we, as student journalists, approach sensitive topics and what the community can
expect from us.
This semester, individuals who had
originally declined comment for stories
asked us to alter them after publication
because the content of the article was not to
their liking. We consistently denied their
requests to alter or retract information,
unless our coverage was demonstrably
wrong, in order to maintain the integrity of
our newspaper. We believe that what was
said on the record should
and will
remain on the record. Likewise, if one side
whether that is one person or
of a story
an entire group
declines to comment, we
do not believe that that side should influence the story after it has been written,
because the opportunity has already been
presented to them. We do our best to represent all sides of a story, but it should be
stressed that this is solely while a story is
being written, not after the fact.
Now, as journalists, we understand that
going on the record is not easy; a person
must have a certain degree of courage to not
only articulate his or her perspective to a
reporter but also to attach his or her name
to this perspective.
That being said, if there are multiple
sides to a story, The Phoenix always contacts representatives on each side to try to
provide our readers with as complete a
story as possible. We will allow space for
everyone's voice, especially on sensitive

issues, but sometimes we have to run a
story with limited information when individuals or groups refuse to comment. We
will not be pressured into withholding
information we feel is relevant to the community.
In the same vein, The Phoenix invests
energy into ensuring that articles covering
arrests within the college and Tri-Co community are always accurate and up-to-date.
Our policy is, and has been for decades, to
inform our readers of every arrest on campus and of Swarthmore students in the
vicinity of the college. Students who are
arrested will be mentioned by name in the
newspaper in the interest of maintaining a
complete news record of campus events.
Our job is to report the facts. As we aim for
fair and accurate coverage, we believe that
it would be unfair and inaccurate to not
report on an arrest, including who was

arrested.
When a student's charges are dropped or
their record is expunged, they should contact us and we will update our online coverage accordingly to reflect the new information. However, from this time forward, The
Phoenix will not remove any names from
our archive for any reason. The Phoenix is
not responsible for covering up the actions
of the adults in this community. Most
importantly, having charges dropped does
not mean the event
such as an arrest or a
charge being filed
never happened.
In terms of The Phoenix's funding, it is
not a secret that we receive financial assistance from the college. We receive funding
for our printing costs from the college via
the Student Budget Committee and the
President's Office. Despite these financial
ties, however, we are editorially and organizationally independent and have no other
formal connection with the administration.
We listen to concerns from the administration as we would any other source and con-

All too often, members of our community forget that The Phoenix is a newspaper
and not a campus journal or a promotional
publication. The editorial board and staff
take journalism seriously. To demonstrate
our commitment to cover news to best of
our ability we follow journalistic guidelines
such as those published by the Associated

as a news organization. Our
aim is first and foremost to report on campus events in the spirit of the freedom of the
press. We fulfill this role by covering events
and, when necessary, investigating stories
that others attempt to keep under wraps.
Fulfilling this role requires a consistent policy, which we have articulated here. We are

Perhaps the sad part is that,
with such a mundaneexplanation, more people haven't
picked up on the easy way
out of this trap.
You see, we're in a special era. The Jewish kinderlach who grow up hearing
the old-school pro-Israel
arguments come to college
and see that Israel is under
siege politically. The typical

reactions are either to disengage, become the cool
"good Jew" who is extremely critical of Israel, or
become Israel's political
knight in shining armor.
There are new movements
cropping up that take

enough, however, because
people need to work across

in order to harness enough
political energy to margin-

alize AIPAC. There is common ground in the middle,
and it's up to the moderates
to dedicate their time and
discussions to finding as
much of it as possible.
So I want to see the lib-

use of experts on the

most important part is that

That's where the young,
pro-Israel Jewish community comes into play. By lending support and convincing

Clarifying the role of the women's rugby team
To the Editor:
We are writing on behalf of the
women's rugby team, to express our disappointment and frustration at the way our

team was misrepresented by last week's

cover article about the cancellation of the
Dash for Cash, and to clarify exactly what
our role in these issues has been. First of
all, we would like to make it known that
the women's rugby team was not involved
in the actions of the men's rugby team on
the night of both teams' banquets last
semester, except, like much of the rest of
the campus, as victims. No punishments
or alcohol bans have been placed on the
women's rugby team, and we do not anticipate that any will be.
We cannot emphasize enough that the
men's and women's rugby teams are separate entities. The article frequently used
phrases like "the rugby team," "rugby culture," or "rugby events," which, in the
ambiguous context of an article that discusses both teams, are misleading. At

Swarthmore, there is no single rugby culture nor any single rugby team. The
women's team puts a great deal of effort
into sustaining a culture that is supportive
and safe both for team members and the
campus at large. We would be very concerned to hear that our occasional nudity

had made anyone feel threatened and

18

would encourage anyone who felt that way
to discuss it with us.
This article unfairly exaggerated the
relevance of the women's team to the cancellation of Dash for Cash. The decision
was not made as a punishment for any
actions of ours and only affects us in that a

fundraiser that we have enjoyed participating in for many years has ended.
However, the article's continual vague references to "the rugby team" obscure the
distinction between the two teams and
their behaviors. We also take issue with
the cover picture for this article. The
choice of a female model seems to blatantly point a finger at the women, while
ignoring the men. Why not a pile of nongendered clothing?
Why not shorts
around hairy ankles? We hope that it was
not meant to portray the women's rugby
team, specifically, but this was unavoidable given the content of the article.

We understand that the Phoenix's decision to publish this article was well-intentioned, but we are concerned at the damage it might have done to our

to their educational niches. In the future,
candidates for hire must explicitly be
considered among the ways they can not
only fit in their department of hire/study
but how they can fit into the larger fabric
of Swarthmore's faculty before a decision

for hire can be made.
Another way in which faculty hiring
can be improved is the inclusion of the
Equal Opportunity Office in these decision making processes. Currently, the
EOO, worked by Sharmaine Lamar, is
underutilized and underrepresented in
these important decisions that are made
department wise. I would like to investigate the ways in which the EOO has historically functioned, how we can envision its use, and how it can best be utilized. Faculty diversity is of as much
import as student diversity.

students should receive more support.

freshman, we must educate students
about the role and potential of studentadvisor relationships, and emphasize the
benefits of close relationships with faculty mentors. By working with SAMS, the
deans, and new ways of gathering student feedback, I believe we can create an

advising system that helps individuals
from all experiences become more comfortable and empowered in all academic
settings.

Another significant issue that works
to facilitate and make cohesive collective
diversity is the investigation of the possibility of a Bridge Program. Such a program would cater to admitted students
who demonstrate and call for support in
the areas of writing and reading before

their official academic career commences.
The Bridge Program would have been
particularly useful for ESL students who
face difficulties in their educational experience here at our institution. A program
similar to the permutation currently
called for existed in the 1970's and was
cut due to budgetary constraints. Reinvestigating this possibility would be
placed, along with the aforementioned
issues, at the forefront of my agenda.

the opportu-

nity to con-

as
Sjt u d en t
Council
President.
As
the
SBC Manager I have worked with representatives from over 100 chartered groups,
and have developed a good understanding
of the activities and events they organize.
Additionally, I am quite familiar with
many of the student run services, and have
worked with representatives from SAC,
Olde Club, FFS and Drama Board, to name
a few. Needless to say, I am very familiar
with the funding process, and can safely
say that I know the student budget like the
back of my hand. As a member of the Ad
Hoc Student Financial Advisory Panel, I
am up to date with the slew of budget cuts
that we will face next year.
I will only make one promise: that I will
bring the same commitment and dedication to Student Council that I brought to
the SBC. Whether during office hours, on
the phone, or randomly at Sharpies, I have
always been willing to answer any questions students may have. Additionally,
some of you may have noticed small
changes that I have implemented over the
course of my term: I created a Google
Calendar and a Twitter account for the
SBC to keep students updated and aware of
student services and any unexpected
changes. I conducted Spring Budgeting
entirely electronically, saving time, money

and paper as compared to previous years.
Though I have made only one promise,
this does not mean that I have no other
ideas. I will start the year by providing students with accessible means to help them
set the Student Council agenda, and
express their concerns or worries. I will
create an online page that students can easily access to (anonymously) jot down some
thoughts, or see what is currently on the

THE PHOENIX

agenda. Similarly, I hope to have giant
poster boards set up at accessible locations

across campus, such as the Science Center
Commons and Kohlberg Coffee Bar, where
students can scribble their thoughts while
waiting in line. The same can be done
specifically for BCC/IC and LGBTQ groups
and locations.
Additionally, the Student Council
Facebook page could be employed more
actively, with members sharing their
thoughts about meetings on notes, and
involving other students, on campus or
studying abroad, in the discussion online.
Due to their busy schedules, many Swat
students simply cannot make it to outreach
events. While I am sure we will host a
handful of these events as well, my focus
will be on minimizing the difficulties students may face in contributing to Student
Council by making use of easily accessible
and interactive online resources.
In addition, I will streamline the funding process for students and minimize

bureaucracy. For example, ideally students
will only need to fill out one form, and send
it along to one person, with more work
being done behind the scenes. A standard
application will also help committee members by allowing them to judge proposals

more fairly, and directly communicate
their concerns about proposals to students.
I also will work with students to implement a new, long-term policy to address the
issue of the SBC budget surplus orrollover.
Whether it will involve better use of
rollover funds, or a plan on how to
decrease the rollover overall, with budget
cuts taking place across the board we simply cannot idly stand by as thousands of
dollars go unused.
Given my experience with the student
budget, I would be in the perfect place to
lead this initiative as Student Council
President.
I hope to involve the administration in
the same or similar online outreach programs that will go out to students, and
encourage them to share their thoughts
with us so that there is an open dialogue
stufor all. This will allow everyone
dents, Student Council, and administrators
to stay in the loop and express any concerns or thoughts.
I hope that my platform has given you a
solid idea of the type of president that I will
strive to be. As always, if anyone has any
questions or concerns, please feel free to let
me know.

StuCo as a way of connecting and empowering students so that we can be involved
in shaping the present and future of
Swarthmore. I am interested in how students can have not only access to, but real
involvement with, the administration.
While I have ideas about ways to change
Swarthmore, my primary interest in the
job of president is not in my own agenda,
but how it is an important role of coordinating and facilitating the work that students already do by making StuCo a more
open and useful channel for student voic-

es.

I am a history/education special major

in the class of 2012; I have been on the
Student Budget Committee and working
in Coalition for a Free Haiti, Swarthmore
Labor Action Project, and White Students
Confronting Racism; I am active in the
Dance Department; I do work study as a
garden assistant in the Arboretum.
The guiding idea of my role as president would be accessibility. Our programs
should exist to meet students where they
are and take their efforts further. From
committees like SBC, to academic
resources like WAs, to the funds for creating new projects, all the resources of
Swarthmore are many angles to get at this
core issue of access. Examples of current
issues that I see at Swarthmore, and ways
for me as president to coordinate work on
them are: efforts to increase the diversity

I would like to pursue making RnM an

clearly on the educational policy representative's agenda.

college services, hiring and financial aid
(continually advocating student involvement in decisions), and really focusing on
the efficiency of StuCo, so that it is capable of making new programs to immediately respond to the daily lives of students
(dining services policies, transportation,
dorm locks) and figuring out ways to take
in student perspectives to consider the
complexity of initiatives like StuCo pay,
which require thoughtful planning and
real efforts to represent the student body.
I also appreciate StuCo's recent initiative
outto group its work into three areas
reach, financial issues, and immediate
response
and I would be interested in
connecting these groups to the broader
student body and bringing in student
groups already involved in these issues.
I also want Swarthmore to be accessible in a more broad sense than the above
important day-to-day channels. I am
interested in more long-term efforts to
think about our financial aid policy, academic accessibility, faculty diversity, program offerings, admissions policies, and
■—

the culture and climate of our school.
I also see next year as an important
moment for StuCo as Liz Braun will begin
her time as Dean of Students. Attending
the dean search sessions this semester

was an important experience for me in
seeing how students can be involved in
college decisions and envisioning different possibilities for the dean of students
role. I would like to work with her to
organize open events to establish comfortable working relationships, but also more
specific meetings that could connect her
to different areas of work on the campus.
I have been involved in multiple student activities here on campus, so not only
do I feel prepared for the, responsibility of
StuCo president and to make a substantial
time commitment outside of my classes, I
have experience with different communities on campus and the different needs

they have.
I see substantial importance in committing to the coordination, facilitation,
and active work of StuCo and next year I
would make it my top priority.
Above all these ideas though, I see the
role of president as supporting efforts to
get started, coordinating them once they
take off, and following them through to
realization, and this is the work that

excites me.

Please contact me (amitterl) with any
feedback and questions.

Student Council Platforms

For financial policy representative:
Ben Hattem 'l2
I'm Ben Hattem and I want to be your next financial policy representative. In my role on Student
Council, I wantto help foster trust between students
and administrators about financial policy decisions.
Doing so would encourage the administration to
more directly involve students in financial decisions made by the college and ensure that students
are heard while decisions are being made and not
just after the fact. This is the only way we can really exercise our influence over the way our college is
run.
Getting students involved in the financial work
of the college requires two things: spreading information about upcoming financial actions and soliciting student input about where arid how we can
most effectively spend our budget. More public
forums and discussions about these issues would
help spread that information
in addition, I will
regularly publish in campus publications about my
committee meetings and conversations with administrators. These articles will have the added benefit
of giving the student body a place to respond directly to me, and I will be diligent about following up on
these ideas and concerns. That way, anyone with a
suggestion will get direct feedback about how thenidea is progressing.
I would bring significant prior experience with
college finances to Student Council. After my somewhat peripheral involvement in the budgeting
process last semester, I've taken on a much more
active role in financial issues this spring. In opening dialogue about the Alliedßarton hiring decision,
I had to familiarize myself with Swarthmore's
Living Wage policy and the surrounding monetary
issues, and my service on the Committee for
Purchaser Responsibility has furthered my understanding of how budgetary and spending decisions
are made. In addition, serving on SBC has given me

fairly thorough knowledge of student budgeting
issues, which, while not directly equivalent to college budgeting processes, are certainly applicable to

them.
I want to especially focus on ensuring that
Swarthmore upholds its commitment to spending
its money responsibly. We have to remember that
Swarthmore is both an academic institution and a
billion dollar business
as a result, ethical concerns too often fall apart in the face of economic
pragmatism or budget neutrality. Saving money
should never supersede our adherence to social justice and environmental responsibility. To fulfill our
ideals, we have to be willing to pay for them. I
would be interested in establishing an explicit
responsible investing policy to help protect our
social values in the recession economy. In developing such a policy, I would be able to make sure that
student voices were heard and could be translated
into a document with lasting effect.
One final point, though. Any show of effective
student power, especially when it comes to financial
decisions made by Swarthmore, requires more than
Student Council initiative. To have any force, or
even to claim to represent student interests, any
such push has to have student support behind it.
Right now, there is a gap of trust between students
and StuCo, as demonstrated by the reactions to the
recent StuCo-pay proposal. I want to ease that
divide so that students can feel more directly represented by and in league with Student Council. But
with that comes responsibility for the student body
as well. Only if students work with their representatives can any meaningful change be created out of
student concerns
it would require effort and
input from you and me both. So I ask you to vote for
me for Financial Policy Representative. Exercising
student control over college finances is a tough challenge
let's take it on together.

For campus life representative:
Elizabeth Bryant 'l3
Hello Swarthmore students, my name is
Elizabeth Bryant and this semester I will be running for campus life representative in hopes of
representing you on
Student Council. I
truly love interacting
with people, and I
have found turning
dialogue
about
change in to veritable
action to be one of the
most
incredible
processes to take part

in. This passion was

recently

developed

last year as I worked
diligently with fellow
dents as president of my high school's Student
Council. Every day I witness the intelligent dialogues that occur oftenbetween students: the conversations that tie us to one another and allow us
to develop ourselves as reactive intellectuals
within Swat's richly diverse and academic space.
The power behind this form of exchange is
extraordinary. I believe that the translation of
these conversations from individuals and professors in the classroom to student groups and
administrators working through Student Council
will serve to further unify and enrich our vibrant
community.

Ifelected, as your campus life representative I
hope to encourage and facilitate more of these
conversations, and strengthen the ties between
student groups across campus. I believe that the
activities put on by student groups have a greater
potential to serve as places for unification among
students.

On Student Council, I would work

towards greater student group collaboration
across the diverse range of organizations while
also serving as a liaison between the student

body and Student Council.
Through communication with students on
campus, I would work to genuinely represent the
diverse student voice in these dialogues, so as to
encourage the planning of events that students
would like to see and take part in. I believe that

Kevin Kim 'll
Dear Fellow Students:
My name is Kevin Kim and I am running to be your next financial
policy representative. In this time offurther uncertainty, where sac
rifices have been made by each and
every one of us, I believe in our studen
body's ability to formulate creative anc
efficient ideas on how to spend our
money. The security of our institution
and its mission to provide for all those
you qualify a liberal arts education that
is second to none depends on it.
As a member of the Student
Financial Advisory Panel (SFAP) and as
a student advisor to Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid, I sat in on countless
meetings with the administration to
analyze (and reanalyze) the numbers
regarding the college's finances. Though we may be in a better position than many of our peer institutions, I know that the cuts that have
been made and the changes that have been instituted have real effects
for each and every one of us. Cuts in student events and services, as
well as in hiring of professors all translate into sacrifices that are tangible. I know of the hardships of finding a summer job that can adequately fill the gap between our financial aid and the growing cost of
tuition. I know of the difficulty of having to choose between giving
more of our time to the cause that we find important versus giving our
time to getting a paycheck to pay for our books. I know because I have
been in that position many times myself as a student on financial aid.
And as your financial policy representative I will work hard to protecting our interests in financial aid, as well as closely monitoring the
cuts made to other services and events that are most important to us.
With more than 6.9 million dollars in cuts approved for the years
the come, this is now the time to shape the future of Swarthmore for
us and for generations to come. I believe that with your help I can help
manage the finances of our institution in these turbulent years to
come. I will work hard to maintain our school's rigorous academic
principles, unwavering commitment to financial aid, and to fight for
those events and traditions that are most dear to us.
-

For student groups advisor:

the organization of such events without input
from the student body is an inefficient use of the
democratic system that we have instated in
Student Council, and that is why a strong student
voice is necessary.
I also hope to work towards creating more
opportunities for students to voice their opinions
and ask questions of both the administration and
Student Council, electronically and personally.
E-mail has become a very useful way for information and opinions to be gathered quickly and
on a broad scale, however, because I believe in
the great merit of human interactions, I would
like to see panels of both Student Council and
administration members that would be open to
student's questions, critiques and suggestions.
Creating this kind of panel and then working
towards addressing the suggestions and concerns
of students would be a major concern to me as
your Campus Life Representative.
I am also concerned about the possible
restructuring of funding between Forum for Free
Speech and the Student Budget Committee. If
elected, I would plan on being active in any discussions and policy changes that might make the
funding process for student events next year different.
I would also make sure there was a reliable
line of communicationbetween these discussions
and the rest of the student body. Yet another goal
for next year would be to institute opportunities
for new leadership in different student groups to
have meetings so as to create a network of leaders that could learn from each other's knowledge
and experiences. This would also be an opportunity for new student leadership to lean about all
of the possible funding bodies on campus.
I believe that Student Council is the medium
through which student concern and creativity
has the opportunity to become concrete initiatives that serve to strengthen, unify and enrich
this campus.
As your Campus Life
Representative, I would take great care in assuring that my service along with other elected positions would work towards the collective goal of
most effectively serving the students of this campus.

April 22, 2010

Anna Stitt 'l3
My name is Anna Stitt and I would like to represent you on Student
Council as student groups advisor this fall.
My experiences so far at Swarthmore have made it clear that
Swatties
have brilliant ideas, take initiative in a wide variety of interests, and want
transparency and information. I am committed to communicating well with
you as students and as members of groups, making sure you're supported
by Student Council, and providing you with information, money, and advising so you can take strong and creative leadership on campus.
If elected as Student Groups Advisor, I will hold a retreat at the beginning of the fall semester for representatives from all student groups. As part
of my commitment to make funding transparent, the retreat
will include
details of available sources of funding and how the applications work for
different sources and events so that you don't have to navigate financial
bureaucracy alone. It will also include support for group leaders and the
opportunity for communication between groups that can strengthen student initiatives.
Throughout the year, I'll prioritize individual meetings with student
group leaders to check in and offer'resources, and I'll organize study breaks
for leaders and members from different groups to talk, build ideas, and coordinate plans. I will also update the Student Activities website with interested groups' accurate contact information to increase accessibility and
better
reflect student life, be available throughout the year for guiding established
and new groups through the process of group formation, development, and
budgeting, and do my best to give each group a stronger voice in the community by opening channels of communication across groups and depart-

ments.
My involvement in Students for a Democratic Society, Swarthmore
Labor Action Project, organizing Rise Up (a new baking group), working to
establish collaborative college classes (with students and inmates) in a
prison in Chester, and several other student projects informs my perspective on the resources and pitfalls for student groups on campus and has
helped me develop many of the skills I will need to be an effective Student
Groups Advisor and member of Student Council. My experience with securing funding, facilitating group meetings, advertising, coordinating transportation and logistics, planning events and lectures, and
navigating the
chartering process makes me prepared for the organizational and facilitating work of the Student Council position, but also gives me a perspective on
what student groups on campus go through.
If elected as Student Groups Advisor, I will commit to representing and
supporting all the student groups at Swarthmore. And as a member of
Student Council, I will commit to developing ways to increase StuCo's
resources as a facilitating and empowering body accountable to your experiences and plans, make budget and funding decisions more transparent,
continue to increase student involvement in making decisions and work to
gain student input in determining what decisions are on the table, and
hold
the administration accountable to prioritizing students and your hopes,
ideas, and needs.

Thrilling comeback tops baseball's historic season
BY MARK CHIN

mchin2@swarthmore.edu

In 2006, Swarthmore's baseball team
went 1-17 against their rivals in the
Centennial Conference, the team's lowest
win total in conference play since the
beginning of the decade. That season, the
Garnet ranked at the bottom of the conference in batting average, slugging percentage, hits and opposing batters struck out

and led the league in striking out, pitchers'
earned run average and walks allowed.
The 2010 Swarthmore baseball team is a
completely different animal from the 2006
team, which did not win a single conference
game until nine games into conference
play. The team was revamped in 2007 with a
new coach and a new set of first-year players, who, as seniors this season, are leading
the team to its first Centennial Conference
playoff in the program's history, the berth

clinched after a thrilling comeback win this

past Saturday.

After taking the first game against
Franklin & Marshall in convincing fashion
at 18-5, the Swarthmore baseball team
shocked the Diplomats in the second game
of a doubleheader on Saturday by scoring
four runs in the final frame of play and
coming back from behind to win it 8-7. With
one out and two on base, Mike Cameron 'l2
hit a double off opposing pitcher Mike Ham
to bring home Anthony Montalbano 'l2 and
Miles Santo 'l2, sealing the game for the
Garnet.
With the two wins against Franklin
Marshall on Saturday, the Swarthmore
baseball team assured itself a spot in postseason play. In doing so, the Garnet
shocked not only the Diplomats, but the
rest of the conference, as the team was
picked to finish eighth out of the 10 teams in
the preseason poll for the Centennial
Conference.
This year's team and season has been
the result of four years of hard work. On the
successes of the team in his senior year season, Captain Wiley Archibald 'lO said, "It's
been great getting a playoff berth this year.
We've gone from a team withfour total wins
my freshman year to having 10 and counting in conference alone. This year really
demonstrates the strides we have taken as
a whole and where we now set the bar for
future seasons."
The strides Archibald mentioned have
separated this year's team in particular
from those of previous years. "This year's
squad has much more depth in the pitching
&

staff compared to previous teams. That's

been really important as the key to winning
games starts with pitching. The staff has
done a great job this year attacking the
opposing hitters with their best stuff knowing that they don'thave to keep anything in
reserve since there are others who can
come in and do just as well," Captain

Jimmy Gill 10 said.
"In addition, our lineup is deeper
throughout and can attack teams many
ways including bunts, homers and being
hit by pitch." Gill himself has had an outstanding season as an offensive menace to
opposing teams, and currently leads the
team in home runs and slugging percentage. He hit a three-run jack to help

.

Swarthmore overcome F&M in the first
game this Saturday, and it was another
home run in the second game that helped
put Cameron in the position for the final
theatrics. Gill was named Centennial
Conference Hitter of the Week for his effort.
The team's success may be unfamiliar to
some of the older players on the team, but it
isn't to Head Coach Stan Exeter. Exeter was
hired to head Swarthmore's baseball team
in 2007 after the disastrous season the previous year, and came to coach the Garnet
the same year seniors Gill and Archibald
started playing for the team.
Even before coming to Swarthmore,
Exeter was named Pennsylvania Athletic
Conference Coach of the Year twice, having
led Arcadia University to two conference
championships in his 10 years serving
there.

Pitcher Zach Weiner winds up to prepare to throw to an awaiting PSU-Abington batter.

Since Coach Exeter stepped into the
head coaching position, the Garnet have
improved year after year, winning more
games against their tough conference foes.
After winning two conference games in
2007, the baseball team had added one more
conference victory each year through the
2009 season, for a total of nine conference
wins in that time period. The Garnet have
exploded this year, and have already captured 10 wins in one of the more competitive divisions in the region.

April 22, 2010

Coach Exeter didn't have to change
much of the Swarthmore baseball team's
philosophy or add any gimmicks to his

coaching style to adapt from Arcadia, however. On what he expected when he first
accepted the head coaching job, Coach
Exeter said, "I knew the guys played hard
at Swarthmore and took pride in what they
did on and off the field. So if we kept that
attitude and added more players to the roster and a bit more talent it would be a great
It's real simple; play well
combination
today is our only goal. All the rest will fall
into place."
But the season has had its own ups and
downs for the Garnet before their significant Saturday win. After winning its fourth
conference game against Washington in
early April, the team suffered a five-game
skid against Centennial Conference opponents to fall under .500 in conference play.
But the team overcame the slide, and rang
off four victories in a row to stay in the
playoff hunt, using those losses as inspiration to perform better.
"We got a little out of stride and were
playing some very good teams that do not
allow you to make mistakes. I think to end
it we just got together and said, 'This is not
how we want our season to go. There's
nobody in this conference we cannot beat',"
Archibald said. "Beating Haverford was
great for our confidence and pride too and
definitely gave us a momentum change.
The great side of that slump is we will likely see those teams again in the playoffs and
have a chance to beat them when it counts."
The Garnet will need that confidence
heading into the playoffs, as they'll face
teams like Johns Hopkins and Haverford
who have already clinched playoff berths as
well. The Garnet may have split the games
against Haverford this season, but they lost
both games that they played against the
...

Blue Jays.
But there may be no better coach that
Coach Exeter in preparation for postseason
play, who led Arcadia to the postseason
every year from 2002 to 2006. On the team's
preparation for its first postseason, Coach
Exeter said, "We are playing pretty tough
teams down the stretch which helps. We'll
treat each game like a playoff game and prepare the team that way."
Looking into next season, it appears that

Swarthmore's baseball team will continue
to be a powerful force in the Centennial
Conference. Despite losing key seniors
such as Archibald, Gill and Zach Sinemus
'lO, the rising sophomores will have gained
playoff experience in their first years on
the roster, and will continue to improve.
"The first-year players have mixed into the

team nicely bringing positive energy to the
team. They all have bright futures as Swat
baseball is starting to establish itself a force
in the Centennial Conference for years to
come. I predict that when they graduate,
they will be the winningest class in Swat
baseball history," Gill said.

But before the Garnet can look toward
the 2011 season and what it may bring, the
team has the ability to do what no other
baseball team in Swarthmore history has
done before: win a playoff game. When
asked about the most memorable moment
of his career, Archibald said, "I've had
some great moments in my. time here, but I
think I will probably have to get back to
you about my best moment. Ask me again
in May when we are playing in the conference championships."
The baseball team finishes its conference schedule at Dickinson this Saturday,
returning home on Sunday for its senior
day and final home game of the season

against Centenary College at 1 p.m.

the Garnet put up a whopping
eight runs in the bottom of the

bigger victory

BY MARCUS MELLO

mmello2@swarthmore.edu

After nearly four years of hard
work and practice, Kathryn Riley
had the weekend of her life in softball. The senior captain achieved
a multitude of accomplishments
this past weekend as the
Swarthmore College softball team
picked up four straight conference victories in two doubleheaders. The Garnet defeated Franklin
& Marshall College with scores of
6-0 and 9-0 and Washington
College with scores of 2-1 and 8-0.
The Garnet now holds an 18-18
record overall and is 9-5 in the
Centennial Conference.
Last Saturday was Senior Day
at Clothier Field and the softball
team played to win. Smacking in
15 runs and shutting out the
opposing team
the Franklin &
over a douMarshall Diplomats
bleheader, the Garnet proved that
they
are
still Centennial
Conference threats. At the plate,
captain Michelle Perch 'lO batted
in a single and Riley delivered
four hits and five RBIs over both
games. Riley, who has been an
enormous asset to the Garnet's
batting order, tied the record for
the most career hits in the history
of the Swarthmore College softball program (157) after earning
her last hit on Saturday.
Riley was not alone in her
excellence at the plate. Krista
Scheirer 11 earned herself a tworun double in the first game and a
homerun in the second game.
Scheirer's double came towards
the end of the third inning during
which the Garnet scored a total of
five runs. When asked how she
has become one of the Garnet's
best hitters, Scheirer said, "I have
listened to Coach Clarke's advice
for my swing, and I have worked
at identifying pitches so I can hit
one in my zone."
The second game against
Franklin & Marshall was an even
'

first. Riley and Scheirer each
doubled and crossed home plate
in the inning. After two and a half
scoreless innings of play, Scheirer
hit a homer and gave the Garnet
their ninth run. This offensive
onslaught gave the Garnet their
15th victory of the season.
Riley, who pitched for the
Garnet, sent 20 Diplomats walking to the dugout on Saturday,
with 12 strikeouts in the first
game and eight in the second. Her
12 strikeouts were a season-best.
Regarding Senior Day, Katie
Teleky, one of ten first-years on
the Garnet softball team, said,
"The seniors are very supportive
of the underclassmen especially
since there are so many of us on
the team. They definitely set the
tone for us and pump up and
inform everyone with the information they know about other
teams and have experienced in
their careers."
Returning to action the following day, the Swarthmore softball
team captured two more victories,
handing the Washington College
Shorewomen two losses.
Put plainly and simply, Riley
established herself as one of the
greatest Garnet athletes in history in the doubleheader against the
Shorewomen. Her performanfce
on Saturday set her up to reach
major accolades on Sunday.
Needing just six strikeouts to
reach 500 in her career, a rare feat
for any softball player, Riley
struck out seven in the first game

500th strikeout came in the sixth

Not only did Riley dominate on
the mound again in the second

The four victories for the
weekend were critical for the
Garnet, whose hopes for the
Centennial Conference playoffs
were bolstered. According to
Scheirer, the successful weekend
was a result of solid playing from
everyone on the team. "Our
games this weekend were truly a
team effort, and I would hand the
win to our defense just as well."
Scheirer also said that it was nice
for the Garnet to defeat the
Diplomats and the Shorewomen
after losing to them last year.
Riley commented that every
person contributed to the successful weekend in some way and that
the team truly came together. "I
feel that this weekend we truly
became the team we are capable
of being. Everyone's selfless attitude, heart and determination
allowed us to accomplish a pretty
significant feat. I think we are
right where we need to be heading
into play-offs and I look forward
to our games this week."
While the team undoubtedly
performed well, the spotlight was
on Riley. Her statistics were more
than impressive for the weekend.
She struck out 32 batters, had a
0.29 ERA, held opposing batters to
a 144 batting average and allowed
just four hits-and one earned run
in 24 innings on the mound, all
while earning her second
Centennial Conference Pitcher of
the Week award this season.
Riley said she was proud of
her accomplishments for the
weekend because it is rare for a
pitcher also gets the opportunity

to hit. "I've been fortunate to play
for a team that allows me to do
both," she said. Riley credited her
teammates and coaches for her
success in reaching her accomplishments at the plate. "I think
my successes this weekend are a
reflection of the people that surround me. My teammates and
coaches have all helped me in
some way to reach these mile-

Anyone who plays the
game knows that many of the hits
you accumulate in your career
are a result of the adrenalinerush
you get from seeing those in front
of you get on base." With regards
to her attainments in pitching,
Riley said, "I have to especially
thank all those who have caught
me over the years. Every teammate that stands in the batter's
stones.

box for me at practice has helped
me to become a better pitcher as
well, whether they are just calling
balls and strikes, or giving me
feedback from the hitter's perspective."
She also thanked
the
Middlestead,
Jeanette
Garnet's pitching coach. "She has
helped me become the pitcher I
am today and I can't thank her
enough."

Teammate Scheirer summed it

up well. "She [Riley] brought us
closer to play-offs, got her 500th
strikeout (a conference record),
tied the school homerun record,
and got the record for most hits all

in one weekend. The girl is legit."
The Garnet will face Rowan
University today in a home doubleheader. The first game is
scheduled to begin at 3 p.m.
