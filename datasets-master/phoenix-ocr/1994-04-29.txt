Swarthmore Debate Claims National Championship

The Championship Trophy Returns to Campus for the First Time in Seven Years as Swarthmore is Again on Top
By Sarah Cebik
Early last Monday morning,
two vehicles full of tired debaters
and big trophies rolled back into
Swarthmore after the American
Parliamentary Debate Association's
National Championships at
Fordham University. Eight members of Swarthmore's Amos J.
Peaslee Debate Society competed
in the most successful Nationals
Swarthmore debate has ever seen.
David Carney '94 and Neal
Potischman '95 brought theNational
Championship back to Swarthmore
for the first time since 1987. In
order to earn this honor, Potischman
and Carney qualified for elimination rounds by earning a 5-1 record
in preliminary competition. Their
performance in "in-rounds" placed
both Carney and Potischman among
the top 25 speakers out of the more
than 140 competing.
In quarterfinals, the pair faced
off against Harvard A, a team of
two debaters who had won Yale's
tournament just two weeks before.
Swarthmore defeated Harvard by a
2-1 decision of the judges to advance to the semifinal round.
In semis, Carney and
Potischman finessed their way past
a hot Princeton team and, by a 3-2
vote of the judges, advanced to compete for the National Championship, simultaneously eliminating the

remaining Princeton team from
competition.
In the final round, Camey and
Potischman met Columbi a's A team,
the top ranked team in overall competition this academic year. Although Columbia had debated well
all year and handled serious topics

matchfor the wit and analysis dished
out by Carney and Potischman
who threw both the audience and
the judges into tearful laughter.
Swarthmore earned the National
Championship with a 9-0 vote of
the judges and 70% of the
audience's support.

Swarthmore teams competing in
quarterfinals was an impressive accomplishment. In fact, the only other
school with multiple teams participating in out-rounds was Princeton
University.
In the quarterfinals, Feuer and
Mallory lost on a 2-1 decision to the
Columbia A team who
later advanced to finals. The round was
extremely close, with
all of the judgesnoting
the difficulty of the
decision. As it turned
out, Columbia's decision to propose a case
regarding formalizing
rights of privacy in the
Constitution might
have earned them a
victory, but certainly
earned them no endearment with the audience as a whole,
manyof whomtermed
the case "unbeatable."
Feuer and Mallory
ended their tournament with seventh
Emily Mindel place, becoming only
the third Swarthmore team to debate in the quarterfinals at Nationals since 1987. Their impressive
performances inpreliminary rounds
proved strong enough to earn

'94 and Michael Scott '97performed
well, earning a 4-2 record and

just missing the
quarterfinals. Scott was the highest
ranking first-year debater among
all of those receiving team awards.
Additionally, Phil Spector '97
and Franklin Rubinstein '97 earned
a 3-3 record, an impressive achievement for two novice debaters considering the difficulty of the competition seen at Nationals.
In addition to the awards
granted for performances at
Fordham, awards were also distributed based on the year's overall
standings. Carney and Potischman
finished in third place for the Team
of the Year award. Additionally,
Potischman finished in eighthplace
for Speaker of the Year, Feuer took
seventh, and Mallory tied a Vassar
senior for fourth. Potischman and
Mallory were the highest ranked
non-seniors for the 1993-94 competitive year from any school.

Recent SJC Decision Announced
The Student Judiciary Committee convened on April 6, 1994,
to hear charges against a student for
holding a party without a permit,
and the theft and possession of a
stolen keg of beer and tap.
Theaccused was found not guilty
on the charges of holding an illegal
party and theft of a keg and tap.
The accused was found guilty of
the possession of a stolenkeg because
the student admitted to knowingly
consuming beer from the keg that
was stolen by the accused's friends.
The committee wants the accused to understand that there is a
distinction between maintaining silence for one's own defense and
maintaining silence in order to protect others (which in turn prevents
the correction of a violation against

members of the College community). By refusing to cooperate and
come forward with the names of
those who stole thekeg, the accused
showed disrespect for his complainants. Swarthmore has long stressed
respect as a quality which students
should hold for each other in their
living arrangements: "S warthmore's
housing philosophy is based on the
belief that residence hall living enhances education by contributing to
an individual's academic, social, and
personal development. Ifresidence
halls are to provide an environment
for personal growth, residents must
accept responsibility for their own
actions and act in a manner which
demonstrates respect for the rights
and concerns of others..." (Student
Handbook, 20).

SJC believes the accused's acdisrespect for the
student'sdorrrritory membersand therefore, we are imposing these sanctions:
•The accused must pay a $3O
fine to be paid to the Business Office, which will in turn be given to
the complainants to cover the cost
of the stolen keg of beer. This fine
must be paid by May 1, or additional fines will be imposed.
•Theaccused is placed on housing probation effective immediately
through the end of the fall semester
of 1994. If at any point during that
time the accused is found guilty of
ANY other offense, no matter how
minor, the accused will be removed
from campus housing for a period to
be determined by the committee
which hears that case.

NetMarket grew out of
Kohn 's junior year abroad at
the London School of Economics, where he came up
with the idea to offer travel
services to Internet users. It
was there that he approached
Roger Lee, currently a senior
at Yale University and the
NetMarket Company's president, with a proposal for the
interactive service. They were
later joined by Eiji Hirai 'BB,
former UNIX system administrator for the Computing
Center, and Haskin was hired
this semester as a programmer/technician.
Haskin and Kohn have
been working steadily on the
NetMarket interface during
this semester, occasionally
travelling to their offices in
Nashua, NH where Hirai
works full-time (but not "nine
to five," he notes). In the face
of theses, projects, and exams,
Kohn and Haskin still put in
many hours a week working
out the bugs of their interface.
"I'm actually pretty amazed at
their timeccHmmitment,'' says
Hirai. "They can still devote a
lot of time to the company."
The NetMarket system
currently consists of 12 DEC

workstations (relatively identical to the Swarthmore College Computer Society's computer,Raptor) and several IBM
and Macintosh machines.
The keystone oftheir operation is the Mosaic software, which Hasknv a computer science and mathematics double major, describes
as "a way of accessing information, pictures, text, and
sound from any computer on
the Internet." Virtually all
information resources on the
Internet are available
through this one interface,

says Kohn, who notes that
"it's just as easy as Eudora
[the Macintosh electronic mail
program], but it's so much
more powerful."
Mosaic is becoming increasinglypopular because of
it's compatibility with other
computer systems and its ease
of use, allowing users to
browse the Internet's offerings without having to use
several differentsoftware programs. Mosaic has been featured in the New York Times
business section.
Hirai and Haskin handle
most of the programming
side of the venture, while
Kohn, an honors economics
major, acts as chief executive officer and product manager by bridging the gap between technology and business. Lee, whom Hirai describes as "the ultimate businessman," is responsible for
raising funds and negotiating contracts. None of these
roles are static, however.
"Withfour people, you wear
many hats," says Haskin.
The programming part of
NetMarket has been the most
difficult part of NetMarket's
journey from idea to reality.
Hirai, who spends most of his
time in from of the computer,
says "the pressure is pretty
intense. I've never really experienced this kind of pressure except while studying for
exams at Swarthmore. Basically, the work that I do can
affect the livelihood of myself and my colleagues."
There are already plans
to expand NetMarket's operations, as the company will
be hiring a summer internfrom
Princeton University to work
with them on the programming side of their business.
"We have everything we need
to make this work," says
Kohn." If we 're going to take
a risk in our lives, it's going to
be now."

Weight Room Atmosphere

To the Editor:

lam writing to comment on the atmosphere in the weight room, If you take a
careful look at the walls, you will find that
all of the posters depict the bulging torsos

play sports about their feelings on the
subject.
Jill Wildongef '97, a sprinter on the

Andy Perrin
I picked up a campus periodical last
weekand found, to my horror, thatthe Conservative Union had decided to raise the American flag over the center ofcampus as part of its
conservative week.
The main thingI associate with the American flag, having spent time in southern Africa,
is the incredible devastation of northern
Namibia and southern Angola carried out
under the auspices of American patriotism.
And that's not to mention the sponsorship of
apartheid in South Africa and the continuing
occupation ofNamibia until 1990—by some
reports, six years after the South Africans
themselves were prepared to give up the country.

I spoke with friends about it; why was
this seemingly minor piece ofcloth bothering
me so much? Why was I prepared to listen
quietly to a lecture by William Buckley or
Dinesh D'Souza, but at the same time so
repulsed by this symbol? As I heard the various storiesof friends' thoughts on the flag, my
reaction started to make sense. Chile, Nicaragua,El Sal vador, Philadelphia, Zaire, Grenada,
Vietnam, Panama,
and so on—for the
past fifty years or so,
the American flag,
whether through
money or arms, has
almost exclusively
stood for oppression,
bloodshed, violence
and exploitation.
This is not my
flag. I live in the
United States, and I'm
glad to live here. But I'm not interested in
patriotism; the freedoms we have because we
live here are not optional. We owe no thanks
to the state that provides what people already
have a right to. And the numerous infringements on those rights—Fßl surveillance of
dissidents, a long history of sedition acts and
political witch hunts, and so on—deserve far
more vociferous opposition than they have
usually received.
I would love to have a flag and a country
of which I could be proud. I would love to
believe, as some Conservative Union members have suggested, that we have freedom
because of, or thanks to, theAmerican flag and
what it stands for. But I don't believe it. I
absolutely refuse to believe that a flag that, for
most of the world, means bloodshed and violence can mean freedom for me. I'm not
prepared to accept this country's paltry version of freedom at that price.
When I talked with President Bloom, he
disagreed that the flag holds an ideological
message; he said the flag's presence was simply a statement of the college's location. The

college's location? Has anyone forgotten recently that we live in the United States? Who,
reading this article, temporarily thought s/he
was in Peru? Poland? Rwanda? Canada,
England, Japan, Australia, or Mexico? I assure you, President Bloom, neither I nor anyone else on this campus needs a reminder of
our physical location.
It is patently bizarre for the Conservative Union and the President to believe—as
they claim they do, that the flag represents no
ideology. The flag, in fact, represents numerous ideologies and carries multiple messages.
To the few membersof theConservative Union,
it means peace, freedom, and whateverother
tropes they trot out. To me, and to many other
people, its message is one of destruction, violence, and injustice. To others, it may carry
other messages. But for a small group of
students to decide, without consulting the vast
majority of the college community, to display
this highly charged symbol in the center of
campus is simply unacceptable.
SwarthmoreCollege owes no allegiance
to the American flag or to the country and
government for whichit stands. Indeed, in my
view it is completely incompatible with the
mission of an independent and critical university to
bow shamelessly to
a government
particularly this
one. The American government
does not have a
good record of protecting academic
freedom, either
here or abroad. The
McCarthy period, the requirement of loyalty
oaths, and complicity in the murders of six
Jesuit intellectuals in El Salvador are just three

In the past, Swarthmore has been courageous enough to stand against these abuses and
others committed in the name of the American
flag. It refused to require loyalty oaths of its
faculty when the rest of the country did so, and
more recently it allowed students to study even
if their conscience forbade them toregister for
the draft. These are the decisions of a college
dedicated to free inquiry and independent
thought. The decision to sanction a symbol of
national chauvinism directly in the middle of
campus is not. It is a symbol of therefusal of
the Conservative Union and the President to
understand the difference between freedom
and nationalism.
The flag should should stay down until a
genuine campus discussion can be held, and the
entire body of students, faculty, and staff can
decide collectively about its display. Any other
course of action makes a mockery of the democratic values the flag's sponsors claim to support.

Nixon Ought Not Become a Hero
To the Editor

that he had a secret plan to end the war in
Vietnam. Such a plan continued to remain
secret throughout his Presidency. Rather than
ending the war, he expanded it with the bombing of Cambodia. The war ended in 1973 with
a settlement that was at best, a marginal improvement over what we could have had in
1968. Saigon fell two years later anyway.
Nixon's war plans allowed numerous more
American soldiers to die when we knew the
war was lost
His policies of detente with the Soviet
Union achieved a minor cooling of tensions,
but had little effect in the long run. Under
Nixon's watch, the CIA helped to overthrow
a democratic government in Chile, bringing
on 16 years of dictatorship. In fairness, the
opening to Chinaremains a singular achievement and only Nixon would have been able
to achieve it with so little controversy. Nixon's
foreign policy record is, however, highly
flawed.
Richard Nixon was the most enduring
political figure of the postwar era. His life
spanned from the early cold warrior days of
the Alger Hiss case to his role as an informal
adviser on foreign policy to President Clinton,
who was bom the same year Nixon was first
elected to Congress. His influence on American history is undeniable. But the influence
is not as rosy as the immediate postmortems
have indicted. Hopefully, the prism of his-

The last week, the entire nation mourned
the death of former President Richard Nixon.
This mourning has seen Nixon eulogized, even
by Eliot Richardson, as a great statesman whose
few flaws overshadowed a great career. This is
an image based on two myths which I hope to
show are nothing but revisionist fallacies.
The first myth is that Watergate was a
minor offense. This has been the most damming of all the statements concerning Nixon. It
must not been forgotten that Nixon caused the
greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil
War. He set up a extralegal group called the
"plumbers" to get at his political opponents on
his "enemies list." In addition to the Watergate
burglary, they broke into Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist office and wrote the famous (and
phony) "Canuck" letter that destroyed Senator
Edmund Muskie's campaign. Nixon engaged
in an effort to cover up these activities by using
the American intelligence community to stop
the FBl's investigation. He blatantly ignored
the system of checks and balances during the
investigation. Moreover, Nixon was not just
doing what ever other political leader had done.
Certainly many presidents, both Democratic
and Republican, have abused the Oval Office.
But none to the degree that Nixon did.
The second myth is that Watergate overshadowed Nixon's impressive record inforeign
policy. No President understood international tory will be more accurate.

Different Perspective:

How to Eat Meat Like a Champ
By Blain Maley
Meat-eating has long been a cause of
blessing and harmony in good quality traditional American households. With the
rise of divorce, single parent families, and
the nuclear household comes the loss of
technique and style required for enjoying
a'good chunk of grade AAA meat. Unfortunately, many in our society do not understand the options available in meat
preparation, and fail to recognize themany
species of meats that can be legally placed
in the cooker. I hope I can brighten up
your day just a little tinsy bit with the
reality that great meat eating can be done
by even the loneliest and talentless of
individuals.
Though not famous for it, I believe it
was Michaelangelo who said, "Without
meat I would be merely a bastard." Though
it has been debated for centuries as to the
meaning of this phrase, I believe that he is
giving meat credit for all of his accomplishments, especially his drawings. I
remember reading somewhere that it was
the taste of a good slab of beef that kept
him chiseling on "DAVID" While he
chistled he thought of the fibrous muscles
that he was creating and the way that they
would melt in his mouth if only they were
real.
To continue the meat time-line, I will
highlight with two of the few performing
geniuses of our time: Chris Elliot and
Bruce Springsteen. The love that these
two men have for meat from tip to tongue
is known far and wide in meat and pork
clubs across the country. At times it has
seemed obsessive, even altruistically passionate the way these two have talked
about meat. While writing for David
Letterman, Chris Elliot purportedly said
to producer Marve Albert, "It is more than
just a myosin-actin fibrous complex to
me, so shove it." Immediately after, he
stormed out of the show never to write for
the "Late Night" again. Elliot's obsession
with meat is believed by many to be the
reason for the shunning ofhis latest works
"Get A Life" and "Cabin Boy." It is too
bad that society could not accept Chris for
what he was and the beliefs he held.
It has been documented timeand time
again that in his classic "Born to Run",
Bruce Springsteen is really talking about a
96-ounce steak rather than a motorcycle.
He was once overheard saying that the
character Sandy in "4th of July, Asbury
Park" is not a woman but his cow.

Most likely, according to historical
record, the first meat-eating was done
with raw meat. While this is always an
option, it is frequently passed over because of overriding fears of contracting
some nasty disease that would make one
feel really...nasty. I myself am very fond
of eating raw meat, especially with my
hands because it makes me feel so manly.
While most people believed that meat
must be cooked to rid it of little bacterias
and plateomenthes, The American Meat
Association (AMA), (as was written in
their 1989 brochure) has "cleaned up the
meat so you don't have to." This makes
it much easier to prepare raw meat for its
pure blissful enjoyment.
Only through education can we end
chopping-block boredom. We were raised
in a generation that was told thar turkey,
chicken, beef and pork were our only
options, and that it all had to be baked
with salt. I don't want to shock anyone,
but the possibilities are endless. One
must be open-minded, able to see through
the darkness into that promised land of
pure pleasure. Where are rodents and
birds on that cute little McDonald' s menu?
What law says we can't eat goats or whale
meat?
I want change, I want results, I want
opossum meat. Who says it has to be
grilled, deep-fried or baked? There is an
entire realm of possibilities not yet explored. It is time that our society's Meat
Cooking Paradigm be changed once and
for all. I propose solar marinations, chemical cooking, and boiling? Did anyone
ever say, "Don't cook that piece of pork
on a marshmallow stick?" I sure hope
not. If they did, they are not your real
friends and you sure as hell don't need
'em. I am sorry ifI sound angry, but damn
it all, I'm pissed. I want results, I want
sauteed grunion.
I believe that it is time that the silent
meat-loving majority take a stand once
and for all to fight against the escalating
pork beef and lamb prices which are a
product of Religious fervor and TV evangelism. I suggest a letter-writing campaign to the CEO of Burger King demanding a flame broiled Ham-Hock on a
biscuit. If we stand tall and proud just this
once and admit our love of hard copy
protein, we shall leave the ring victorious.

Standing at the Crossroads

My first reaction when Ethan called

Phoenix
I have numerous fond memories
(as well as a few, shall we say, less pleasant
ones) ofmy days editing the Phoenix
but
rather because I'm presently one of those
crazed seniors facing external exams starting
next week. Being a second-semester honors
senior feels a lot like serving as editor-inchiefof a campus publication when you have
5 hours to deadlineand no pages laid out of a
100-page issue.
So here I am. And I find myself in a
position quite similar to that in which I found
myself once a week throughout the fall of
1992: with a blank editorial page facing me,
and no pressing issues relevant to the campus
as a whole at the forefront of my mind.
Unless, of course, you count thoughts relating to my chemistry thesis and upcoming
exams, but not too many people on campus
would appreciate my filling this space by
seeing how many times trans-bis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-diphenylporphine
can fit on a page. Instead, I'll attempt to
express the feelings of a second semester
honors senior (namely me, since I haven't yet
perfected the technique of getting into someone else's mind) so that maybe, just maybe,
all those underclasslings out there will understand the frantic expressions on the faces of
some of thepeople about to escapefrom here.
Imagine yourself as coming to a crossroads. The sign at this crossroads onlypoints
one way towards a bridge, upon which that
to

"FUseven-lettered double-edged sword
TURE" is prominently displayed, which immediately conjures up near-paralyzing feelings of uncertainty. Next to the bridge, you
find yourself standing in the shadow of something huge that towers above you for as far as
you can see. Upon further investigation, you
realize you're standing beneath a gigantic book
made of stone. The book has etched into it in
blood red letters, the word "THESIS" and the
names of each and every one of the external
examinations that you'll be taking.
As you're peering upwards trying to understand just why this happens to be perched
right above you, you realize the shadow of the
book is shifting and that the top of the book
isn't quite as far away as it seemed. With a
shock, you begin madly dashing for the bridge,
hoping to get across it in time before the stone
book obliterates all traces of the Future. As
you run, the faces of everyone you've known
swim maddeningly in and out of view in your
mind, and you hear the voices of faculty members from your major department cackling in
the background....

I suppose this nightmare ofmine could be
applied to the experiences of just about any
senior on campus. While some of us know
where we'll be working or studying next fall,
others of us are anxiously mailing out resumes
and cover letters to anyone and everyone that
might have a job opening in their field of
interest. To allofmyfellow seniors, I wish you

At a college where many people take themselves much too seriously, we felt a newspaper
that did the same would be like poopies and doodies. We know we are not The New York
Times. We never wanted to be,and no college paper shouldbe. This isn't to say that wedidn't
care about news, journalism,orquality wesimply didn't think they weremutually exclusive
with a more creative, pleasing and laving paper. We didn'taccomplish all that we wished, but
we did give you Hot Dog Man. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd, thriceand once the hedge
pig whined (Shakespeare, Macßeth; IV;i). I love Hot Dog Man. Nobody else does, but hey,
it's my paper.
As exemplified this semester, anyone interested can play a serious role in helping The
Phoenix in its perpetual rise out of the ashes. You can design the pages of a paper with a
whopping circulating ofjustover2ooo issues. You can even design a sublime new logo. In fact,
if you re really interested, you can be editor-in-chief, and publish whatever you want. There
are ways to make this job quite simple, even enjoyable. Delegating responsibilty to competent

staff is key. We could not have Qotten

without our wise and noble crew of editors.

Of course, editingThe Phoenix is not all love and chicken. Thursday nights are always latenights. There are always some conflicting
personalities on the staff. And (as we have seen) the responsiblity of creating a newspaper becomes more and more cumbersome and less
of an exciting journey with each passing week. Keeping staff morale high is crucial, but it's no easy matter when everyone is getting

bludgeoned by their work. Note this segue.
So, next year Ethan will be pruning trees, naked in Guatemala, and I'll be styling kilts, tooting bag pipes, and hopefully picking up
a Scottish accent at the University of Edinburgh. We now pass the garnet baton to our next co-editors-in-chief John Freeman 96 and Ben
Stern '96. We think they will do a great job, and we encourage the students of Swarthmore to help carry The Phoenix through its 116th
year.
Here's to the end of the 1993-94 academic year at Swarthmore College. Good luck on your finals and best wishes towards a sublime
Graduation. Have a pleasing summer, or life. We hope you've enjoyed the Phoenix Renaissance.

Housing Lottery Conspiracy Discovered... Maybe
-

By Jeremy Weinstein
I know that it's over. I'm sure that you
probably want to forget this year's housing
crisis forever. But I can't let you do that.
Rumors have flown across this campus attempting toexplain what happened with housing—from complicated conspiracy theories
involving foreign countries to an inside coup
by the Conservative Union. On special assignment from The Phoenix, I was charged
with the dangerous job of uncovering the
truth.
I knew that the jobI had ahead would not
be easy. After much consideration, I began

Ming Chan Offers Advice What's On and Off Campus
April 29,1994

Cornell Visiting Professor comments on student life
By Matthew Ram Lee and Ben Salter
"I have no regrets," Professor Chan firmly
states. Ming K. Chan has served as the Julian
and Virginia Cornell Visiting Professor for
the 1993-1994 academic year in the History
Department at Swarthmore. Chan is a professor of history at the University of Hong Kong
as well as the Executive Coordinator of the
Hong Kong Documentary Archives at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University,
where he was a Visiting Professor ofModem
Chinese History during the 1992-93 school
year.
Chan states that "lifehere at Swarthmore
is very delightful, very enjoyable."
Chan has served as a visiting professor at
Duke, UCLA, UC-Santa Cruz, and El Colegio
de Mexico in Mexico City. He currently is a
general editor of the series Hong Kong Becoming China: The Transition to 1997. He
has written many articles and book reviews
for academic journals, and travels almost
every week to present public lectures. Healso
frequently grants interviews regarding public
affairs to the media, including the BBC, the
Wall Street Journal, and Time.

have much time left, nor the mood or psyche,
to indulge in what I think is good clean fun
and gracious living, despite the fact many of
them are gifted and truly talented in other
areas besides formal academic pursuits."
Chan goes on to say that, "The campus as
a community has been a successful thing.
Sometimes the success is not a full blessing,
because people are so [isolated within] it."
It is difficult to find a balance in such a
community. "This particular academic community of good meaning, serious, decent
people runs the risk of a certain tendency
toward over-intellectualization. [Thestudents]
are very bright and perhaps they think of

offering condolences and shaking angry
fists in the general direction of Parrish. Or
maybe it was the dining hall, I can't
remember. Someone even made the
generous offer of loaning their calculator
to the housing committee to help them
with their addition and subtraction. Not a
bad idea (no, I'm not bitter; it must have
been something you ate).
Then, as I sat contemplating my situation, periodically hurtling needle-sharp darts
through the air at a picture of a certain aforementioned housing director, I wondered if I
really did need aroom for next year. There is
plenty of nature on this campus to get in
touch with. Why not rough it? Heck, after my
biology class today, I can identify the edible
may apple, with its three shiny, glove-shaped
leaves, and know to avoid the poison ivy that
looks like an umbrella (or was it the other
way around?).
Just imagine it. A roving band of nomadic Swarthmore students. Living wild,
rugged in the Crum woods. Living off the
land. Eating berries and squirrels. They're
not bad actually; just broil 'em and add
barbecue sauce (the squirrels, not the berries). Periodically raiding the dorms and carrying off clothing and women to broaden the

carried away.
Of course, becoming a hunter-gatherer
isn't our only option. We could always look
for an apartment in the Ville. 1 can picture it
now: a luxurious 10 square foot cubicle with
a gorgeous view of a back alley from one
window, and a lovely brick wall out of the
other. But having an apartment means cooking. And dishes. And cleaning.
First of all, rny cooking repertoire consists of cold cereal, lukewarm Spaghettios,
and overcooked Kraft macaroni and cheese.
Now this may seem like a banquet to the
average bachelor, but you can only live on it
for so long. After a while, you begin to
hallucinate and froth at the mouth. Just think
about how you feel after eating at the nacho
bar. As for dishes, I have enough trouble
keeping my onemug clean (actually, I haven't
cleaned it for a while because there is something growing on the bottom that I think is
sentient, and might not take well to being
scrubbed). And cleaning, well, I don't clean
this year anyway, so I wouldn't have to
worry about it (there are sedimentary rocks
forming out of the dust collecting on my
shelves).
Many of my friends have offered me

Athlete of the Week

Men's Tennis Team Sets Sights on Nationals
George "Spoon" Khalaf '96 turned in a
strong performance at second singles as well.

By Brandt Lincoln
This past Saturday, the men's tennis team
faced the University of Rochester in a very
important Division 111 match. The Garnet
needed a win to maintain their number three
Eastern Region ranking and keep their hopes
for an NCAA National Tournament bid alive.
With their hopes for post-season play depending on this match, the Swarthmore Bandits produced a convincing victory.
The Bandits fine play began at fifth
singles with Chris "Wheels"Pearson '95. He
won the team's first point with6-2,6-3 victories. Despite a weak shoulder, Wheels has
been playing incredible tennis for the past
several weeks. When reached for comment,
he smiled and said, "For the first time in my
twenty years of living, I truly feel that Spring
has arrived. I just feel so good all over."
Hunter Gehlbach '95 at sixth singles was
next to finish his match. He too won convincingly, 6-3,6-4. Hunter has been theCinderella
Story of the year. Having missed the fall
season in order to study abroad, hereturned to
capture the sixth position through hard work
and determination. He has been a valuable
asset to the team by consistently winning
matches at this very important position.
The Bandit's thirdpoint was captured by
Brandt "Meat" Lincoln'9s at third singles.
Despite his nonchalant style of play, Lincoln
was able to dispose of his opponent rather
quickly, 6-2, 6-3.
Chris "2C" Ciunci '95 garnered the
team's fourth point at the fourth singles position. After losing thefirst set, 6-3, he was able
to win the next two 6-4, 6-2. With his
consistent play, 2C has become the backbone
of this year's team. His fine play has improved the play of the other team members .
At first singles, Barry "Fist" Mook '96
lost a close match to a strong opponent.
Unfortunatly, Barry's opponent's strongest
asset was his poor line calling. Despite this
distraction, the Holland Fist of Power was
still able to display incredible tennis skills.
,

Fighting off a cold to play his match, Spoon
was able to win the first set before falling in
the next two. He put forth a valiant effort in
front of the many spectators, including his
father.
Before entering the doubles competition, theBandits were ahead by the score of 42. They needed to win one of the three doubles
matches to clinch the team match. This victory came from the ever-reliablethirddoubles
team of Mook and Paul Purewal '97. Since
the beginning oftheirpartnership afterSpring
Break, the tandem have been undefeated,
including a tremendous victory over the University of Pennsylvania.
At second doubles, Ciunci and Pearson
confronted a very strong Rochester team.
Down a set and then trailing 5-2 in the second,
the dynamic duo were able to extend their
opponents to a tie-break before losing the
match.
At first doubles, the California connection of Vijay Toke '96 and Lincoln produced
another victory. After defeating the number
one ranked team in the Eastern region the
weekend before, the tandem of Toke and
Lincoln were able to maintain their fine play
to beat the number four ranked Rochester
team. With these important victories, theCalifomian tandem should garner an individual
bid to the NCAA National tournament.
With strong play evident in both singles
and doubles, theBandits were able to clinch a
6-3 victory over the University of Rochester.
This improves theirrecord to 4-6 in Division
111 action. The Bandits have one remaining
match this season away at Princeton thisTuesday. After this match, the team will eagerly
await to see if they will be attending the
NCAA tournamentfor the twentieth consecutive year.
The team would like to thank the many
fans that have turned out for their home

Wonder Woman
Spear chucker Jenny Willis '94 hangs
up her size 7 1/2cleats this year, ending her
four year throwing career and leaving her
name tacked on the Swarthmore College
record board not once, but twice. Jenny
holds school records in the javelin and shot:
she's tossed a mighty 108' 11 in the javelin
and heaved all eight pounds of the metal shot
put a tremendous 33' 6 (eight pounds being
the weight of a medium sized cat). Her
Aqua-Man strong arms have also powered
the discus a spectacular 103' 7". "I thow,"
comments Jenny, "because I feel like I have
power over everyone else on the field. I like
seeing things fly far away from me." Jenny's
javelin throw has the grace of waves crashing on an Oregon beach while her discus
spin resembles an ever beautiful gyroscope;
practice for the shot comes from her Sharpies
ice cube battles, where she takes particular
pleasure is seeing the ice slip down a shirt.
Once her final ice battle is completed,
Jenny will travel cross country to the West
Coast, where she will attend graduate school
in thefall. Jenny will pack along her favorite

matches during the season, especially the
ones that supported them this past Saturday.

track memories; building cheering pyramids during the Washington and Lee
4X400m relays and the afternoon she spent
trying to peg G-M'97, another thrower,
with her discus. "We were all trying to hit
him," she explains, laughing. "This was the
best track team" she adds, "thisyear was the
most fun."
The Swarthmore volleyball and basketball teams will also miss Jenny next
year. She ends with the following words of
wisdom: "That which does not kill us
makes us stronger; that pretty much sums
up Swarthmore."

Baseball Prepares for Season End
By Chuck Hudson
The Garnet Tide baseball seawill wind down its 1994 campaign on Saturday with a doubleheader versus Dickinson. The season could be considered a disappointment to most, but for a team
losing just 4 seniors, there are many
bright spots.
Tobin Lanzetta '97 and Patrick
Straub '97 were both impressive in
early pitching outings. Lanzetta
struck out 8 in his only conference
outing vs. Western Maryland. Straub
did some damage with his bat, hitting .289 with 1 HR and 10RBI in
just ten ballgames. Both will be
valuable assets to next year's squad.
Jeremy Bonder '97 managed to stay
healthy and hit .291 while securing
the starting second baseman's job
and a spot in next season's pitching
rotation.
Frank Santora '96 and Chuck
Hudson '96 both avoided the
"sophomore jinx" and followed up
strong freshmen seasons with comson

parable stats. Santora is hitting .316
to date and may be the leading candidate for the shortstopposition next
year. Hudson places in the top 5 in
Centennial Conference rankings in
ERA ( 3.17), Strikeouts (20) and
Innings Pitched(3s 1/3).
Co-captain Bob Mascia '95
battled through his junior year, solidifying the middle of the garnet
Tide batting order by leading in

RBl's (22) and Stolen Bases (13).
He is hitting .301 to date.
Matt Hultman, Gene Lam,
ToddKim, and Shiv Darius Tandon
are the seniors who will be sorely
missed as they finish out their Garnet Tide careers, but the team hopes
to become stronger in their absence,
learning from the experience and
knowledge they shared this season.
Thanks fellows and good luck.

The Worms are coming...the
Worms are coming...more specifically, the Swarming Earthworms,
the Swarthmore men's ultimate
frisbee team, is on the move. Though
plagued by inconsistent play during
the spring, at the sectional tournament held last weekendat Princeton
University, the Worms played well
enough to advance to the regional
tournament tomorrow at Lehigh
University.
After surviving the journey in
the Incredible Fishtailing Van, the
team dropped its first tournament
game to the #2 seed Princeton despite being buoyed by co-captain
Matt Robison's relaxation-technique pep talk ("You are on a field.
You see a disc...")- Remarkably,
however, the team was not discouraged by the setback (as evidenced
by its response to Anam OwiliEger's lounge-act cheer), and resolved to do better in the next game.
And indeed they did. The
Worms came out firing against Perm
State, a team they had lost to earlier
in the season. Swat's zone defense
proved State's undoing. The final
score, after a brief flurry of State
scoring at theend of the game,ended
withSwat on top, 17-9; high scorers
on the game included Mandel with
four scores and Stevens with three.
Just as heartening as the win was the
consistent play and the patience of
the Worm offense.

Jeremy Bonder' 97 snaps out a pitch.

The next game was against
Lehigh, a team that had beaten the
Worms during the fall and had defeated Penn State earlier in the day.
The newly confident Swat team,
however, ran its offense with precision, and bolted to a 9-2 halftime
lead en route to a 17-7 victory. Ali
Momeni led theway with five scores,
giving him a team-high eight for the
day, and provided one of the first
half's key plays when he made a
diving stop on a Lehigh pass, then
broke to the end zone to receive a
pass from Mandel.
The next morning the team
faced opponents from East
Stroudsburg University (yes, that is
East Stroudsburg). A strong wind

archrival Haverford to determine
their place in the rankings.
Having lost to Haverford several times in the fall and once this
spring, the Worms were familiar
with the 'Ford style of play. The
strong wind made for a tight game;
long passes were difficult, short,
crisp throws necessary. Swat fell
in the first
behind 1-0,4-2, and
half, and each time came back, the
last time with three straight scores
to take a 7-5 halftime lead. Rutter's
two scores and steady end-zone play
led the way. In the second half,
however, Haverford's defense
clamped down on the Worm handlers. By forcing repeated turnovers deep in Swarthmore territory,
the 'Fords squeeked out a 13-11

tating more control over the disc.

win. Bright spots amid defeat were
3 scores from Stevens, and 2 each

Co-captain Robison provided another hypnotic pep talk, and when
the play at last began, the magic
from the day beforecontinued: Swat
roared to a 7-0 halftime lead (the
games were only to 13 on the second day), and coasted to a 13-2 win.
Key elements of the strong play
included Ajit Jagdale's two scores,
Mandel's capable handling job, Cocaptain Willie Young's presence at
mid, a score by the inimitableDave
Sobel, and, lest we forget, Mike
"mbrogan3" Brogan's two scores,
giving him three for the weekend.
The victory gave the confident
Worms three wins in a row, officially qualified them for a regional
date, and sent them into a clash with

fromMomeni and Rutter. Momeni 's
scores gave him an impressive 10
for the weekend, while Stevens had
9 and Mandel and Rutter had 6 each.
The Worms thus ended their
weekend with a 3-2 record, a spot in
the regional tournament, and some
hefty motivation for revenge on the
'Fords. The team has improved
greatly over the past months and
hopes to surprise opponents at
regionals. With the power of
Robison's pep talks ("We've got to
play our game!"), humor (Jagdale:
"We've got to play someone else's
game!") and newfound confidence
in its ability to play together, the sky
is indeed the limit.

Track and Field Day at Relays
By Team Captains
Last Saturday we traveled
Western Maryland College for
WMC Invitational. Missing key
runners, we still started off with a
bang, with the Distance Medly Relay team of Megan Cunningham
'95, Jill Wildonger '97, Amy
Klosterman '97, and Alison
Schirmer '97, leaving the competition flailing in the Steeplechase pool.
Following theDMR's lead, the powerful field contingent, Betsy

(Disc, Shot), Jenny Willis'94 (Disc,

*97(Jav), Kim Killeen '97 (Triple
Jump, High Jump),Tina Shepardson
'94(TJ, Long Jump), and Joanna
Vondrasek '94(LJ, HJ,Jav) placed
solidly in all events. Highlighting
the efforts was Willis, with her personal best in discus, a throw of
103 '7", andShepardson with a triple
jump of 35'8.5".
The 4xloom relay team of
Wildonger, Killeen, Shepardson,

who is also a cross country terror, hasadded inchesand pounds

While running, Reents admits to not always focusing on

Shepardson placed fourth in the

Rough Rugby Women
By Pia Houseal
With one game left, the women
Ruggers are about to complete a
successful and tough spring season.
A core of seniors have led the team
this year; last weekend they played
their last home game. This game, a

rugged victory over Bryn Mawr/

Haverford, upped the women's
record to 5-4.
The scoreless first half proved
to be a brutal match between the two
tough A side teams.
Half time pep talk led by cocaptain Jenny Romich '94 fueled
the women as they ran to prepare for
the receiving kickoff. Swat was
psyched and there was no stopping
them. Swat's first try was scored by
Alice Sondheimer '94 followed by
Rachel Johnson '95 kicking a
sucessful conversion. Swat was up
7-0.
Another try, by Deb
Cunningham '94, soon followed.
Never looking back, Swat kept this
lead by playing a powerful second
half and ended victorious!
The B side game was dominated by the Swat women. TheSwat
back line, led by Sandy Schmidt
'94, was unstoppable. Scrums were
dominated by the Swat ruggers. A
pair of trys were scored by Schmidt

as the B side found a fly half in her.
The final score was 10-0.
The afternoon was filled with
more rugby at the Haverford pitch.
Many Swat ruggers traveled there
to join Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and
Penn players to form an Eastern
Pennyslvania Select Side against
Virginia. These ruggers included
Ruscheinsky, Jen McKinnon '95,
Kathy Suyeyasu '94, Becca Cole
'96, Wendy Weiner'94, Kim
Lundgren'94, Cunningham,andPia
Houseal '97. A second select team
also included Sonja Shield '97.
As the women approach their
final game, they can look back over
a season filled with memories. The
team will be losing nine seniors:
Kathy Suyeyasu, Jennifer Eckert,
Kim Lundgren, Alice Sondheimer,
Wendy Weiner, Jen Romich, Deb
Cunningham, Heather Weers, and

"The season went well," adds
Ruscheinsky, "We played a tougher

was a good season for the seniors to
go out on."
