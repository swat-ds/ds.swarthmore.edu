Extended McCabe hours a reality for next semester
BY ELENA CHOPYAK

echopyal@swarthmore.edu

After gauging student interest and working with administrators, Student Council members announced that McCabe
Library will have extended hours next semester. McCabe
will be open from 8 a.m. until 2 a.m. on Monday through
Thursday, from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. on Fridays, from 10 a.m.
until 8 p.m. on Saturdays and from 10 a.m. until 2 a.m. on
Sundays. Additionally, weekend hours at Underhill Music
Library will now match those at Cornell Science and
Engineering Library.
After considering student suggestions and conducting a
student survey, Student Council entered discussions with
the administration to enact the change.
"The original impetus came from the suggestion box,"
said Sam Asarnow 'OB, Student Council Vice President. "I
think that we followed through, from suggestion box to realization."
The recent push for more hours is not the first attempt at
extending library hours. According to College Librarian
Peggy Seiden, a McCabe survey was conducted in the beginning of this decade that demonstrated a student inclination
for longer hours. However, at the time, there was less interest on behalf of the administration to execute the change.
Student Council President Peter Gardner 'OB said that the
administration supported the Council's proposed changes.
Gardner said that, due to scheduling conflicts, the biggest
challenge was actually bringing administrators, librarians
and Student Council members together.
"The process was very quick because we had excellent
data that [showed] there was broad support," Asarnow said.
Seiden, an integral player in the recent change, conducted research on library hours at other colleges similar to
Swarthmore, such as Reed College, Wesleyan University,
Amherst College and Carleton College. "We are open fewer
hours than our peer institutions," Seiden said. Reed's main
library is open 120.5 hours per week, Wesleyan's for 111
hours, Amherst's for 110 hours and Carleton for 116 hours
per week. Currently, McCabe is open for a relatively low-end
102.5 hours per week.

Beginning next semester, students will enjoy longer McCabe hours at a minimal expense to the college

The financial impact of the extended hours is relatively
small. Seiden said that powering the electricity in McCabe
costs around ten dollars an hour. However, McCabe's lights
already remain on throughout the night so that
Environmental Services can work once library patrons
leave. Additionally, the heat never shuts off completely in
McCabe, but cycles on varying temperatures throughout the
day.

Seiden said that McCabe will require an additional 18
hours of student work and five hours of staff work per week.
"We're going to absorb [the cost] in the existing budget for
the trial period, but I will be asking for the additional funds
for the additional hours," Seiden said.
Seiden estimated thatthe additional wage costs will total
approximately $3,300 annually out of the library's $3 million

budget.

Student Council discussed the pros and cons of extending
library hours with Dean of the College Jim Larimore and
Seiden, Asarnow said. "I think that both Jim and Peggy

understand that this is the status quo at our competitors'
[schools]," Asarnow said.
Asarnow and Gardner considered McCabe's multi-functionality as a library, study space and social center. "The fact
that we don't have a student center space means that
McCabe functions as a work and social place that has a deeper significance to students," Gardner said.
Asarnow also noted McCabe's unique library resources
and numerous public computers as additional reasons for
keeping the library open longer so that students may have
access to these services. According to Asarnow and Gardner,
next semester will function as a long trial period for the
changes. "We definitely want to have a way of checking to
see if this is a good idea," Asarnow said. "We are constantly
assessing and reassessing," Gardner said.
Asarnow and Gardner both plan on maximizing their use
ofMcCabe by remaining in the library until 2 a.m. However,
their plans for reform are not quite finished. "We're very
interested in changing the buzzer," Gardner said.

College Republican revival to broaden campus political spectrum
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore chapter of the College
Republicans is in the process of being
revived this year in an attempt to broaden
the spectrum of political perspectives represented on campus. So far, the College
Republicans have had two meetings, a
YouTube Debate watching party, as well as
an informational meeting in early
December. The turnout at the meetings
suggests that the College Republicans may
be experiencing their biggest comeback in
14 years, after formal meetings stopped

being held last year.
According to Justin Shaffer 'OB and
David Pupkin 'O9, the leaders of the College
Republicans, the group began planning the
revival in September. So far, they are in
the brainstorming stage and don't have
any concrete plans to report. Shaffer and
Pupkin declined further comment.
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l
met with the leaders in late November. He
said there are no concrete plans for the
Republicans, but he said that the administration is receptive to possible ideas.
"We're open, we're responsive; we hope the
other agencies on campus will be responsive too," Eldridge said. "I think diversity
of perspectives and views is important for
all of us, and I myself am sort of resistant
to absolute labels
I think it's very misleading, especially in this place."
Two first-year College Republicans
share Eldridge's sentiment. "I was under
the impression that there were both groups
[Democrats and Republicans] on campus. I
THE

PHOENIX

understood that the Republican group was
probably going to be a smaller one, but I
was surprised that it was completely nonexistent," Kate Walton 'll said. Walton first
found out about the College Republicans at
the YouTube Debate party, and signed up
for the mailing list.
Some hope that the comeback of the
College Republicans will contribute to a
more balanced political
scene at
Swarthmore. "I came to Swat expecting a
bit more moderate political views on campus. It seems like discussions are onesided," Sam Griggs 'll said.

"There's this assumption

on campus that everyone
shares the same liberal
perspective."
Sam Griggs 'll
According to an "Enrolled Student
Survey" conducted by Institutional
Research at Swarthmore College, of the 81
percent of students that are registered voters, 17 percent of students identified themselves as "far left" in their political ideology and six 58 percent of students identified
themselves as "liberal." Twenty percent
called themselves "middle" in their political ideology and six percent self-identified
as "conservative." Zero percent called their
political ideology "far right." With the

of students being sharing nonconservative viewpoints, the revival of the
College Republicans gives moderates and
conservatives a forum to express their
political views.
"It's nice to have a place where you're
not constantly being attacked for your
opinions and [not] always having to be on
the defensive for your political views,"
Walton said. "When you do introduce any
conservative point of view, it's almost
immediately refuted because people don't
take it under consideration."
"There's this assumption on campus
that everyone shares the same liberal perspective," Griggs said. "The degree of
diversity of opinion is really how liberal
you are."
If the defiling of College Republican
posters is any indication, the new club
may face some opposition from the student
body. Walton said that a poster in the basement of her dorm had been defaced within
a brief period of time. While defiling had
been done with a humorous slant, Walton
pointed out that had it would mostly likely
not have happened for the poster of another political group.
The College Democrats, however, are
extremely positive about the revival. "The
Republicans on campus felt like they wanted a group and they wanted to get some
political debate on campus," said president
of the College Democrats Daniel Leigh 'O9.
"I think that sometimes Swat can lack
political diversity. There are a lot of issues
we can talk about and discussions we can
have and the College Republicans can really facilitate that."
majority

December 6, 2007

Professor of Political Science Richard

Valelly '75 emphasized the importance of
political diversity on campus. "I think it's
important for students to be politically
active on both sides of the political spectrum," Valelly said.
According to Valelly, the College
Republicans were very active in the 1993-94
academic year, with five or six energetic
students organizing events and a speaker
series featuring big-name conservative fig-

ures.
"This caused a bit of a buzz," Valelly
said, especially among the faculty. It was at
this time that the American flag came to be
flown atop Parrish, Valelly said. After that
academic year, the club seemed to peter
out, likely as a reaction to the election of
President Bill Clinton and the unified
Democratic control of the government.
Valelly predicts that the 'OB elections
will inspire the strengthening of the
Republican party, and that students,
regardless of political orientation, will find
the club's revival interesting and worthwhile. "I hope the College Republicans
grow, I really do, I think it's good for the
college, it's good for the students," he said.
With respect to the upcoming elections,
the College Republicans and Democrats
will likely be working together to involve
Swat students in discussion and debate.
"We look forward to doing civic engagement and working with the College
Republicans," Leigh said.
With regard to the republicans on campus, Griggs said, "We're not the people who
read Ann Coulter we do read her for fun,
but we laugh at her too."

Plan B now available at Worth Health Center

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu
Beth Kotarski, the new director of Worth Health
Center, has worked to make the emergency contraception
method called Plan B, also known as the "morning after
pill," available to Swarthmore students through Worth.
Plan B, described as a "second chance" on the Plan B Web
site, is up to 89 percent effective at reducing the risk of
pregnancy and can be taken up to 72 hours after intercourse, though its effectiveness is greater when used earlier.
Kotarski explains that the product has been on the
market for the past five or six years. "Since my main discipline is reproductive health, I was a little surprised that
it wasn't here yet," Kotarski said. "I think the reproductive services here have a full offering which is impressive
for such a small college. So I see my role in the next year
or so as just kind of tweaking those offerings and just
making sure that we always stay on pace with other colleges and the latest offerings."
According to the McKinley Health Center of
University of Illinois Web site, "Plan B works through
delaying or preventing ovulation, by interfering with fertilization (inhibiting the movement of the egg or the
sperm through the fallopian tube), and may inhibit
implantation by altering the lining of the uterus. It is not
effective if the process of implantation has begun."
Before Plan B became available at the health center,
Worth offered a combination of birth control pills in high
doses for emergency contraception. This, Kotarski
explained, would provide an amount of progesterone comparable to the amount found in Plan B, but also a high
dose of estrogen. "The reason people got very sick with
the older method was because it had high doses of estrogen
but Plan B is just progesterone, and some women
are sensitive to it, so they can experience nausea, but it's
not nearly in the numbers that the older method was,"
Kotarski said. "Thus it's more effective because women
can keep it down long enough for it to work."
The possible side effects, though rare, include nausea,
cramps, menstrual changes, dizziness, breast tenderness,
diarrhea and moodiness. However, Kotarski said, "Plan B
should not make you sick."
"I'm a great believer in a woman's right for choice and
I think it's being offered in an appropriate way. It's not
being proselytized, but it is being offered for women who
choose that," Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
...

Westphal said.
The Plan B pills are now available at the health center
for use in emergencies. "They just come in and are interviewed by the nurse who's here, and it's dispensed right
here," Kotarski said. The college purchases Plan B for $3l
a dose and sells it to students for $l5, absorbing almost
half the cost. Kotarski explains that surrounding pharmacies also have it, but at a higher price, about $4O. "I've
checked at Genuardi's, Target, they all have it. It's just

Worth Health Center recently acquisitioned Plan B, an emergency contraceptive, which is being offered for $l5 a dose.
that it's certainly more expensive," Kotarski said. There
are, however, some concerns about making Plan B available, such as that it might detract from students' use of
other contraceptive devices. "The studies have never
borne that having emergency contraception readily available is going to make women less likely to use another,
more effective method," Kotarski said.
Plan B should not be used as a replacement for other
forms of contraception. "The only thing that comes up
[regarding Plan B] as a Sexual Health Counselor is don't
use Plan B as regular birth control: it's only for emergencies," Sexual Health Councilor Mark Duglash 'OB said.
Kotarski explains that though its rate of effectiveness
is higher than the previous "morning after" method
offered at Worth Health Center, it is still less effective
than condoms, the pill or other more common forms of
birth control. "[Plan B] lowers in effectiveness if used too
often, thus the title 'emergency,'" Kotarski said, "but we
would never prevent a woman who needs it on a monthly
basis from taking it. We would just wonder [if she needs]

better counseling or control methods because it's not as
effective if it's used monthly."
Westphal believes that the new method has been presented in a very considerate fashion. "I appreciate the
way it's being publicized, because it's not in the face of
people who disagree with that method, so I think it's

being handled sensitively," Westphal said.
As for future plans concerning the center, Kotarski
said that college health centers have lost their status as
clinics, preventing them from having access to less
expensive birth control from the manufacturers. "So, in
other words, if it's $4l for a pack of pills, that's what we
have to pay," Kotarksi said. As a result, WHC is switching
their birth control pills to ones on the generic label in
order to save money. "They're just as effective, just as
good," Kotarski said.
Dluglash saw the new additions to WHC as a sign of
the health center's commitment to adapting to change. "I
think Worth is great, I think Beth is great, I think we're
moving up with the times," Dlugash said.

Since its revival earlier this year, Swarthmore's
Students for a Democratic Society has hit the ground
running. Notably, the group has attended a recent protest
at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security
Cooperation, which is better known by its former name,
the School of the Americas, and has actively networked
with SDS groups from area schools. A counter-army
recruitment campaign is also in the works for next

semester.

This is something close to home that

This is a

Markus Schlotterbeck 'ID
SDS Member
...

Ten students from the college, the majority of whom
were SDS members, attended the Vigil to Close the
School of the Americas over the weekend of Nov. 16 in
Fort Benning, GA, where SOA is located. According to
School of the Americas Watch's Web site, the weekend
included speakers such as U.S. presidential candidate
Dennis Kucinich and well-known human rights activist
Adriana Portillo Bartow.
SOA is a United States Department of Defense facility
operated military training institute for Latin American
military leaders.
Perhaps one of the Department of Defense's most controversial projects, the SOA is accused of training its students in methods that violate international human rights
laws
accusations that have been bolstered by select
alumni who later became known for their atrocious

protest.
"It's a cause that I always thought was important, and
I also think that it's for a cause that is achievable. I know
last year there was a bill in Congress to close down the
School of the Americas that came incredibly close to
passing. So I feel that at the national level there is a lot
of support for shutting down the School of the Americas,
so this is an important year to push for that," Kastner
said.
"I felt like I was participating in at least raising
awareness in U.S. involvement in training soldiers who
are the leaders and members of paramilitary group and
death squads in South America. It's a very clear example
of U.S. foreign policy that is contrary to standards of
human rights and contrary to the values that the U.S.
espouses," Schlotterbeck said.
In addition to the SOA protest, Swarthmore SDS has
also been active in regional SDS activities. Just this past
weekend, members attended the Northeast Regional SDS
convention in Philadelphia.

Once the national SDS completes a census, the group
will know more about the numbers and activities of
other SDS chapters. "We talked a lot about the national
SDS and what they're doing. I think they agreed on some
points of unity for the Northeast as a region. Our chapter
of SDS will be receiving a ballot of sorts where we can
have input on what the national SDS is doing," Kastner
said. "We also got a good sense of SDS nationwide, of how
many groups there are and how strong each individual
chapter is."
Looking ahead, SDS is planning a counter-recruitment campaign that it is looking to put into effect next
semester. "Counter-recruitment is going places where
recruiters have a strong presence ... and saying some of
the things that the military doesn't say. It is countering
the message of the recruiters and telling potential
recruits the things the military doesn't want to tell
them," Schlotterbeck said.
Schlotterbeck also described the reasoning behind
this campaign as two-fold.

"The inspiration is that the military is recruiting disproportionately to minority and disadvantaged people
-and that these people are dying overseas," said
Schlotterbeck. "This is something close to home that we
can hope to achieve
This is a way to deal with the
effects of war that is happening in communities around
...

us."
Thus far, SDS has gathered information about schools
that may be potential sites for its campaign and has
drawn upon the counter-recruitment training session
that some members attended at the SOA protest.

"We talked a lot about the national
SDS and what they're doing. I think
they agreed on some points of unity
for the Northeast as a region."
Anna Kastner 'OB
SDS Member
According to Schlotterbeck, the group is generally

interested in going into schools where recruitment is
heavy and either setting up a table in a lunchroom or
passing out information in the halls. He does not foresee
much difficulty in receiving permission from schools for

SDS to carry out its campaign, since schools that allow
recruiters are required to allow counter-recruiters to be
present as well. In addition, schools aren't necessary
resistant to counter-recruitment efforts.
Students at the college have responded favorably to
the group's counter-recruitment campaign.
"I'm glad to see a Swarthmore group doing counterrecruitment because military recruiters sometimes target a very specific group and give them very biased and
misleading information about the military. I think this
campaign will help people make a more balanced decision about whether or not to enlist," C.J. Seitz-Brown 'lO

ITS Director Judy Downing said the

RIAA notified ITS of these illegal activities
approximately two weeks ago. Shortly
afterwards, ITS forwarded the RIAA's
message to the four students.
The RIAA is not able to trace IP
addresses back to individuals it is only
able to contact these students through ITS.
But if ITS does not comply, the RIAA is
legally in the right to subpoena the college
to reveal the students' identities under the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, as stated in the college's copyright policy. "We
have not given the RIAA anyone's name,"
Westphal said. "The RIAA would have to
get a subpoena to force us to give that up."

In its November press release, the
RIAA, "a trade group that represents the
U.S. recording industry," according to its
Web site, said it sent over 400 pre-litigation
settlement letters to colleges and universities across the country. "[This] gives students the opportunity to resolve copyright
infringement claims against them at a discounted rate before a formal lawsuit is
filed," the press release said. The RIAA
launched this campaign earlier this year,
specifically focusing on illegal file trafficking on college campuses. Swarthmore
received its first two notices last semester.
Westphal said it is uncertain whether
other sweeps have taken place that the college has not yet heard about.
ITS Information Security Analyst Nick
Hannon said while organizations like the
RIAA have previously taken measures to
hold individuals sharing a large number of
files accountable, this new wave of screening individuals regardless of their share
file size has not been seen before. "The
RIAA and some others have decided to
play hardball and the stakes are a lot higher now then they were maybe a year or
two ago in terms of the amount of money
they are trying to assess. The risk is a lot
higher now and that has to be weighed into
any decision," he said.
Downing said according to the notices
ITS received from the RIAA, the majority

Westphal said while she supports the
recording industry's stance against illegal
downloading, she does not, however, support how the RIAA has decided to handle
these cases.

"The way that the RIAA is doing
this, I'm not very happy with. I guess they
have to pick on somebody and I guess
that colleges are more able to find things

rather than people in their individual

harsh. So I feel very sympathetic to the

Co-president of Free Culture Ben Mazer

the free distribution of art, science and
technology, it does not support illegal
downloading. Instead, it encourages alternative means of accessing music, such as
purchasing used CDs and records. He said
by not downloading illegally, one is also
reducing the RIAA's power which Free
Culture believes to garner most of the
profit generated from sales, instead of the
artist. He said while the RIAA claims illegal downloading adversely affects everyone involved, artists still benefit from
them because it helps put them out there
and the merchandise and concert ticket
sales make up for the lost profit.

Westphal said the college does not
police its network for illegal trafficking
nor is the dean's office approaching this as
a disciplinary issue. Rather, "when something like this happens, there's always a
cry for more education."

while the college has made some efforts to

educate the campus community about the
risks involved in copyright infringement,
more can be done to promote awareness
about the seriousness of the consequences.

heads of the campus, because it'll be in a

be only known towards freshman during

I'm not blaming them, but in working with
them, we can figure out other ways to let
the campus know that, 'look you really
need to just not have these programs on
the computer," the student said. "You are
taking a risk every time you even have the
program open."

Westphal said that many individuals on
campus falsely believe that they're safe.
And that even though the recent measures
the RIAA has taken might not reflect the
way things are done at Swarthmore, the
risks and consequences of copyright
infringement are very real.
"I'm really upset for the students. It's
not the Swarthmore way
we warn people before we do things to them," Westphal
said. "But Swarthmore's not the real
world. I'm justkeeping my fingers crossed
that there's nobody else in the pipeline."

Biology professor's Vatican lecture bridges science and theology
At a conference, Scott Gilbert addresses the possible points at which personhood begins

Gilbert said that he was unsure as to
why he was invited to the conference.

However, he suspects the invitation may
have came as a result of a bioethics textbook that he wrote along with two
Swarthmore students, and/or as a result
of a widely quoted Web site he created
that explores the issue of when human
personhood begins.

"I can't tell you when human life

begins, but I can tell you that there is no
consensus," he said. In his talk, he went
over several possibilities for when human
life begins, including fertilization, gastrulation (the point in development at which
the EEG pattern starts) and birth, giving
supporting arguments for each.
According to Gilbert, other speakers at
the conference included right-to-life
physicians, biologists who do embryology, legislators from the European Union
and Italy and theologians and philosophers. The cardinal who led the conference had previously "blasted the physi-

cians treating Terri Schiavo," he said.
The head of the specific session Gilbert
spoke at was one of the chief exorcists of
Rome.
"This was a very conservative group,"
Gilbert said. Most of the audience consisted of priests, priests in training and
students. It was held in the auditorium of
the Legion of Christ.

One of the goals of the conference was
to explore the "themes and problems

While Gilbert said that he doesn't

when human life begins, he hoped that
they could "appreciate why a person could

"The priests were extremely nice to

Coffee bar trial proves successful, longer hours to come

After a successful trial period, Kohlberg Coffee Bar
will continue its new Saturday hours of 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
according to an e-mail from the Student Council sent last
Monday.
Dining Services conducted a two-week trial run to
determine whether $3OO in revenue could be made each
Saturday. While the first two weeks were successful, revenues from last weekend did not meet the minimum.
However, Dining Services will continue the coffee bar's

"There's some sort of mentality that [crossing] the railroad tracks is crossing a border," Gardner said. "It's also
not as convenient and student-friendly."
Coffee, hot chocolate, chai and tea are Kohlberg's
products that are in most demand. Since 'they are
favorite winter drinks, Ruhri is concerned that student
demand will decrease next semester because of the
warmer weather.
"When it gets warmer, students won't bother to go
inside," Ruhri said. However, Dining Services Director
Linda McDougall noted that iced coffee and smoothies

According to Cash Operations Manager Gusti Ruhri,
the three weekends with Saturday hours so far have not
sufficiently determined the success of the program. The
first weekend occurred "when there were a lot of things
going on," Ruhri said, which did not provide a good indication of student interest. The subsequent weekend, however, revenues decreased.
This past Saturday, Dec. X yielded a monetary loss
because Student Council was not aware Kohlberg would
be open and therefore did not publicize it. However, both
Ruhri and Student Council president Peter Gardner 'OB
are optimistic for the future.
Student Council initiated the pilot program for
Saturday coffee bar hours when they received requests
from students to extend coffee bar hours on the weekends. Dining Services chose Kohlberg due to its central
location on campus.
Although students can potentially buy cheaper coffee
at Dunkin' Donuts in the Ville, Gardner believes stu-

Currently, Kohlberg offers a limited weekend edition
by selling fewer pastries and no sandwiches.
The extension of the trial will help Dining Services
determine whether to keep the Saturday hours open the
whole year, just for the winter or to abandon the program entirely.
"This point next semester will be a better barometer
of deciding if Saturday hours will continue," McDougall
said. Gardner also hinted that Sunday afternoon hours
might be a consideration if Saturdays prove to be lucrative.
Ishita Kharode 'OB said she was glad to be able to buy
tea on Saturday while passing through Kohlberg. "My
friend said there was no tea, because the coffee bar is
closed because it's Saturday," Kharode said, "[but] we
walked in and it turned out that the coffee bar was open,
which was a pleasant surprise." Kharode looks forward
to spending on Saturdays in Kohlberg next semester
when her points are replenished.

Bookmobile for Chester children moves forward
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

With the hopes of providing children in
Chester public housing sites with food for

thought books, sophomores Mai Schwartz
'lO, Casey Osborn 'lO, Jake Ban 10 and Gina
Grubb 'lO are working with the Lang Center,
Swarthmore Library and Chester Library to
initiate
a Bookmobile project. The
Bookmobile project will provide children
with the opportunity to read and borrow
books donated by the on- and off-campus
community by driving a children's bookfilled van into the housing sites during after-

school hours.

According to Osborn, a group of students,
including herself, took a Sociology
Anthropology seminar with Jennie Keith
called
"Social Change and Social
Responsibility" that not only taught them
about different strategies for implementing
social change, but also actively placed them
within a community organization in Chester
&

where they spent two to four hours each
week observing and interviewing members
of the organization.
"We got together at the beginning of the

school year and we kind of talked about
how we might be able to continue to work
within Chester. A lot of us just felt compelled
to continue to work within the city," Osborn
...

said.
After brainstorming project ideas, the
group went to Delores Robinson, administrative assistant in the Lang Center, to make
a proposal of their idea. "She knew what
would work and what wouldn't work. We
initially thought that we would go to after
school sites, [but] she suggested public housing sites," Osborn said. According to Ban, a
fellow Bookmobile .organizer, public housing sites are something like compounds in
which low-income families can stay for

reduced prices.

The idea of the Bookmobile project is to
provide an extensive book collection within

the Bookmobile van that would be driven

into Chester and provide the children at the
public housing sites with a time period in
which to read the books and engage in literary games. Eventually, the Bookmobile
hopes to potentially provide the children
with the opportunity to purchase or borrow
books, though the logistics of these additional elements of the plan have yet to be
resolved.
"To start, we probably wouldn't be lend-

ing books out

just a two hour period
where kids could read books," Osborn said.
"We're hoping that at the end of the semester, if there are kids that have taken a particular liking to the Bookmobile, we would
like to reward themwith a book of their own
that is almost earned for being good read...

ers."
According to Ban, the project would be
implemented in the afternoon, during after
school hours, in order to provide the students with a space in which to continue
reading in a non-academic, yet engaging setting. "The plan is to work in conjunction
with the public housing sites as well as the
public libraries and have our own mobile
and go to the four different public housing
sites in Chester and have volunteersread to
kids," Ban said.
Bookmobile organizers have already
begun to collect book donations from the
campus community by placing boxes
around
after the
campus
end of
Thanksgiving Break to allow for students to
bring back any unwanted or unused chil-

dren's books from home.
Osborn and the other organizers will also
be working with the Swarthmore Library in
the Ville in order to expand the collection of
book donations in addition to the donations
being collected on campus.
Other than the inspiration that came out
of Keith's first-year seminar last year and
Ban and Grubb's participation in Diane
Anderson's education class, "Literacies and
Social Identities," the Bookmobile organizers have recognized the need for an initiative that promoted literacy withinthese particular low-income communities.

December 6, 2007

According to Ban, there are limited, if
any, after school programs available to the
children in these communities and the book-

mobile project hopes "to fulfill the niche in
this way." Another shortcoming of these

communities has originated from the poor
book collection in the Chester Library. In

this sense, the Bookmobile project would
"supplement" any inadequacies in the literary resources available to the children.
"We're meeting with the librarian [of the
Chester Library] on Friday, but we know
they don't have that many children's books
as most community libraries do," Grubb
said. "We'll be trying to get those kinds of
b00k5..."

Although the project is still in the beginning of its planning stages, organizers
already have big hopes and visions for the
Bookmobile. "I really hope that we can get a
van that we can paint, or a bus. I envision a
small 'Magic School Bus' type bus that we
painted and that is full of books," Ban said.
"That's what I envision. And we want a song
kind oflike the ice cream truck."
"I think our biggest obstacle right now is
finding vans," Osborn said. "Our primary
concern is that we make this project sustainable."
"I expect it to be hard," Grubb said. "We
still have a lot of work...l'm sure the first
time we try to get this going, it's going to be
hard to get excitement going
We really
hope this becomes something [the kids] look
forward and to be able to get more students
volunteers to come and read with them."
According to Osborn, the Bookmobile
...

project will be tentatively implemented near
the beginning to middle of spring semester.
During that time, she and the other
Bookmobile organizers plan to apply for
grants to further sustain their initiative in
the future. The Bookmobile group will continue to collect children's book donations
after winter break and encourages students
to take that opportunity to bring back books

from home. The donation boxes will be
placed in Shane Lounge, McCabe Library
and the top of Sharpies.

Cars line a parking lot on campus. On Monday afternoon, a student's vehicle was reported as stolen from C parking lot. Borough police found and returned the vehicle within an hour.

Stolen car reported and found within hours
BY MARIA KHIM
mkhiml@swarthmore.edu

A student-owned vehicle parked in C lot was discovered missing and reported stolen on Monday afternoon.
Within an hour after police officers began searching in
the campus vicinity, the vehicle was found abandoned
but unharmed on Widener Road, alongside the train
tracks, according to the car's owner, Virginia Tice 'O9.
Tice said she had lent her car to a friend, who
returned the car to C lot on Sunday night. When Tice
returned to C lot on Monday around 2 p.m., she discovered the car to be missing. Shortly after, she reported her
missing

car to Public Safety.

"People should always take
reasonable precautions. Crimes of
opportunity happen when property is
unattended or unsecured and
within the means to take it."
Owen Redgrave
Director of Public Safety
"We first made sure that it was stolen versus borrowed. After we looked into some of those avenues, and
it became clear that it was stolen, we contacted the
Swarthmore Police," said Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave.
Sergeant Raymond Stufflet of the Swarthmore Police
Department questioned Tice, took down her statement
and then proceeded to search the nearby areas accompanied by another officer. Less than an hour later, Tice
received a phone call from the Swarthmore Police, saying that they had found her car only a few blocks from
campus. "It was so sketchy because the car was parked

halfway on the curb, and pieces of chocolate were strewn
in the back seat," Tice said. "But I was incredibly lucky
to find it in such a short amount of time; both Public
Safety and the Swarthmore Police were amazing. The CD
player doesn't seem to work, but there was no damage

otherwise.

According to Tice, this type of incident is not an
uncommon occurrence. "I was told that this happens a
couple of times a year," Tice said. "Some people will
decide they want to go for a joy ride. They'll look for a
car that is unlocked and vulnerable and they'll just get in
a car, drive it around and dump it somewhere nearby."
Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig acknowledged
that it was a rare case to have found the missing car so
nearby to where it was taken.
"Occasionally, the person will leave a stolen car
where they take a new one. Generally, when they take it
for a joy ride, they don't take the car just two or three
blocks away, it goes a longer distance than that," Craig
said. "That's not to say that it couldn't have been somebody that lives in the area, but it looked suspicious the
way everything fell together. Whoever had the car was
not real careful about how they parked it."
Redgrave confirmed that the motives behind this incident probably did not involve professional theft, since

the car was discovered within such a short span of time
and at a very nearby location.
"If the car was taken by a professional car thief, it

probably wouldn't have been found so quickly,"
Redgrave said. "One reasonable theory may be that
someone found that it was vulnerable and took it for a
joy ride. The fact that it wasn't vandalized or had things
taken such as the radio, seems to support that theory, but
it could be anything."
Another similar report was filed on a missing car

the same day that was supposedly parked on Meyers
Avenue. It turned out that the student had loaned the
keys to somebody and it was found parked in a different
location. Craig cautioned students to be aware of their
responsibility when lending out their car keys.
"The problem in both cases, it appears to me, is that students were loaning their car keys to people," Craig

said. According to Redgrave, there have also been several similar reports involving student lending out their
cars.

"But I was incredibly lucky to find it
in such a short amount of time; both

Police were amazing."

Good Food initiates composting program with a scrape-off
BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

This past Monday through Wednesday, Earthlust
teamed up with the Good Food Project to host a scrape-off
during dinners at Sharpies. Scrape-offs, which have been
previously held at Sharpies, are a way for these groups to
show students how much food gets wasted after a typical
meal. Earthlust and the Good Food Project advertised the
scrape-off with signs and informative pamphlets with the
hope that students would participate, both to give accurate
results and to add to their composting efforts.
Students were encouraged to scrape their leftover food
off into bins during the three-day long campaign. Club volunteers were at dinnerbetween 4:30 and 7:30 p.m to aid students and inform them about the scrape-off and food waste.
The food was sorted into compostable and non-compostable
bins, which allows composting to happen more quickly and
efficiently. Certain foods, mainly vegetable and fruit-based
foods, can be composted but others cannot.
New separate bins were used in this week's compost program, differing from the previous years' methods of "natural composting," which occurred in an unsorted heap
behind the bleachers on the athletic fields without an aerator. The new method of composting takes into account that
animal meat products slows the process of composting, and
separates them accordingly.
After the scrape-off each day, the Good Food Project
weighed the food to calculate the exact weight of the wasted

food. According to Good Food Project coordinator Claudia
Seixas 'lO, the amount of food wasted in the past has diminished throughout the scrape-off week. "The idea is to reduce
the amount of waste we produce," Seixas said. "We will

have bins out to collect the waste and afterwards weigh the
bags to see how much is wasted." Seixas hoped that people
would see how much they wasted and become more conscious, hopefully decreasing waste over the three days of
the scrape-off.

Earthlust member Nicholas Buttino 'OB led Earthlust's
involvement in the project.
"The goal is to try to show people how much they waste
individually and as a community," he said. Buttino said that
after the project is over they plan to publicize the results for
the campus to see, though it might be difficult to correctly
and accurately compile the results. Buttino said he hoped
that people would help contribute by properly sorting their
food after the dinners.
Buttino also hoped the project will successfully raise
awareness for food waste in the community. "We know
there is quite a bit of concern for the environment within
the student body, but people working with environmental
awareness want to show that students care," Buttino said.
Buttino said he hoped that the scrape-off will do just that
in a more specific context: make students more aware of
how much they waste and get people thinking about trying
to reduce waste.
The Good Food Project will be taking the compostable
trash and using it for their new composting program. The
program started a few weeks ago, and the GoodFood Project

hopes that it will be a continued project. Using a Foundation
Grant from the Lang Center, Good Food members bought
materials and set up a compost pile behind the bleachers at
the athletic fields. The compost pile is covered by a blue tarp
in one of the cinder-block dividers. Students get credit for
work-study to maintain the compost pile. Food unused by
Sharpies was directly sent to CityTeam Ministries' kitchens
in Philadephia, where the unused food is donated to lowincome families and homeless individuals. In the past, leftovers from the meals of students were sent to an incinerator in Chester, where waste is treated through combustion
and converted to ash and gases. Seixas says that rather than
burning the food, composting it would be much better for
the college environmentally.
Compost coordinator for the Good Food Project James
Marzluff 'OB will be comparing the weights of the compostable and non-compostable scrape-off foods to see just
how much food at Sharpies could be composted instead of

burned.
Marzluffhas been helping to collect compost scraps from
Sharpies since the project started. "Every day we collect

kitchen scraps like apple peels, melon rinds, coffee grounds
and lettuce trimmings, haul them down to the compost pile
in our trusty golf cart [from the arboretum] and mix them
with leaves and woodchips provided by the grounds staff.
We turn the pile over a few times a week, and so far things
have been going well," Marzluff said.
Marzluff also sees the benefits that making a compost
heap will produce for the campus.
"A properly built compost pile really heats up as a result
of microbial action, and can get as hot as 1400F, effectively
killing any pathogens or weed seeds and creating a rich,
sweet-smelling and sanitary hummus that we will use to
grow more vegetables in the spring," he said.
For now, the scrape-off will be a one-time project and collections for the compost heap will be a separate initiative
maintained by the Good Food Project.
The group hopes to have more workers to sustain the
program. Additionally, it is possible that future scrape-offs
will be planned. "We currently do not have plans to implement it on a regular basis, although that could change next
semester," Marzluff said.

Christmas tree sparks eco-debate at Penn State on whether the college should use an artificial, cut or live tree
BY ERIN PRAH
DAILY COLLEGIAN (PENN STATE)
It's not easy being green.
At least, that's the debate surrounding the staple of each winter holiday season.
The question of whether an artificial
or a real tree is more environmentally
friendly has become a popular subject
on blogs and Web sites.
Arguments are made for both: An
artificial tree can be used year after
year, but a real tree avoids man-made
materials like plastic and aluminum
varieties.
Sarma Pisupati, associate professor
of EGEE 101 (Energy and Environment)
at Pennsylvania State University, said
although he isn't an expert on the subject, he thinks an artificial tree might be

better because it is reusable.
"I think if we use it for a number of
years, and it's not something that we
dispose of by just using it once, that
should be OK," Pisupati said.
He said that when his family decorates, they use an artificial tree that
they have had for 10 years, and he doesn't expect to buy another one soon.
"I don't want to chop a tree down
every year," he said.
One topic he is well informed about,
though, is the lights that go on a
Christmas tree.He said LED, or lightemitting diode, tree lights are prevalent
in the market and are a great option.
"I can confidently say those are the
best lights," he said."They use very little
energy, and they are very dutiful. They
can produce 40 to 50 thousand hours of
lighting."

But not everyone thinks artificial
trees are best for the holidays.
Rick Bates, an associate professor of

horticulture, said he has been asked the
question many times and has come to
the conclusion that using a live tree is
more environmentally responsible.
"Generally, an artificial tree is factory-produced," he said. "It's going to be
manufactured using petroleum prod-

ucts."
He said a lot of Christmas tree farmers are growing trees smaller, so that
after the holiday season, the trees can be
replanted in the family's yard.
John Tait, owner of fait Farm Trees
outside of Boalsburg, said he can understand why real trees could be environmentally friendly.

"There is the oxygen production, and
the tree is recyclable," he said. "In the

December 6, 2007

Centre region, most of them are recycled
and made into mulch, so when that
whole cycle works, then it's pretty envi-

ronmentally friendly."
There are two different kinds of real
trees
cut and live. A cut tree is cut off
at the trunk while a live tree has its
roots dug up along with the tree.
Tait agreed with Bates and said some
families like to replant their live
Christmas trees in their back yard as
long as they only keep the tree in the
house for 10 days.
Besides the fragrance a real tree

offers, Tait said it is the tradition behind

selecting a real tree that makes the dif-

ference.
"It becomes a family tradition of
going to the farm and cutting the tree,"
he said. "Getting a tree out of a box and
it's not the same."

BY NICK GAW

I first became interested in Iceland after being shown a short
promotional video produced by Iceland's tourism bureau. It was
a very good video and certainly made me want to visit. I recall
being particularly interested by sections describing nightlife
and seafood. But for a long time, this short film fell from my
memory, and I forgot about Iceland. Recently, however, all of
that has changed. My desire both to review this promo video and
to visit the Nordic nation has been renewed by Sigur Ros' recent
releases: "Hvarf-Heim" and "Heima."
Sigur Ros has had a busy fall. Last month, the Icelandic quartet released the two disk set "Hvarf-Heim." On Dec. 4, Sigur Ros
released "Heima," a double disk DVD package featuring a documentary. "Hvarf-Heim" is a solid effort, but their cinematic
release, "Heima," is spectacular.
"Hvarf-Heim" is released ontwo CDs. The first disk, "Hvarf,"
meaning 'disappear" or "haven," contains five new tracks.
These are all well written and flawlessly executed Sigur Ros
songs. They do not mark any stylistic departure for the band,
but after four full-length releases, Sigur Ros has certainly landed on something that works.

"Heim," meaning "home," the second record in the set, is an

acoustic revisiting of Sigur Ros' older material. The description
alone is certainly exciting, but in practice, the record falls short.
Each of the six tracks is beautifully performed and recorded, but

on the whole, they fail to diverge markedly from the original
recordings. These acoustic versions just seem like slightly more
raw recordings of the originals. In some cases, I wouldn't be surprised if the tracks were the pre-produced cuts of full-length
album tracks. All told, the record is an interesting listen, but not
an essential part of every Sigur Ros fans' collection. Yet even if
the record is a bit disappointing, it is a testament to the band's
wizardry creating rich atmospheres even without electronics.

Sigur Ros' 97 minute long documentary, "Heima." however,
finally pairs cinema with the sound that has, since the band first
formed, been described as "cinematic." Perhaps this is an obvious pairing, though one that creates only high expectations for
the group. On all accounts, Sigur Ros delivers.
The film features the band returning to Iceland to play a
series of unannounced, free concerts. "Heima" gives viewers an
opportunity to see the band play against the backdrop of
Iceland's waterfalls and greenery. Here, the music matches the
surroundings precisely and feels remarkably contextualized and

Sigur Ros' first performance in the film features a familiar
sight for anyone who has seen the band play live: a silkscreen
masking the band onto which images and video are projected.
Quickly, though, the band shows itself, speaking frankly about
Iceland and touring and playing stripped down performances

around the country.
One of the most interesting people that Sigur Ros encounters
on their musical odyssey is a middle-aged man who constructs
marimbas and other large keyboards out of thin pieces of shale
from a nearby mountain and long-dead rhubarb from his back
yard. The quartet joins together to play a massive shale marimba and the music that they produce is deeply haunting.
After watching "Heima," it is clear that Sigur Ros has complicated feelings towards their career. By virtue of their success,
the band has become a part of the American music industry,
though they feel oddly out of place there. "Heima" shows Sigur
Ros stepping out from behind the silkscreen and back home.
Unlike "Hvarf-Heim," the documentary is something very new
for the band. If you aren't a fan of the band already, this film is

On Sunday, Dec. 2 at 7:30 p.m., the Swarthmore College
Chorus performed in Lang Music Hall. Led by chorus director
John Alston, the Chorus performed works by Britten and
Bernstein. The chorus is comprised of over 80 singers, ranging
from Swarthmore students to professors to people from the
town of Swarthmore.
Before starting the first piece, Alston gave a brief introduction to the audience explaining how Britten wrote several ofhis
works in an insane asylum. Consequently, the pieces often mention animals in the lyrics. For example, the first stanza of one
piece reads, "Nations, and Languages, and every Creature/In
which is the breath of Life." The poetry mentions several different animals and how they, along with man, "praise God with
all his might." After Alston's further insights about Britten's
life, the chorus proceeded to sing Britten's "Rejoice in the
Lamb" with text from Jubilate Agno by Christopher Smart.

Patriarchy, a hot
war is one we
neither wish to
win (for moral reasons) nor to lose (for selfish ones),
though we can understand how those long abused might
prefer an open fight (if they could win) over a labored
coexistence. Justice seems to demand such a thing.
Friendship does stand out to us, because equality is
almost the defining trait. There are loving relationships, such as those between a parent and a child, that
are revolting to contemplate as archetypes of human
interaction on a grand scale. It is parity between the
parties that allows choice and consent. Out of these
things comes a freedom to do what otherwise could not
be done: ending the unacceptable dominance of the current upper class, while finding some means to protect
me and mine from what we deserve once we no longer
have the power to protect ourselves. This is Aristotle's
simple truth about friendship: "Among friends there is
no need for justice."
Attending open IC events is obviously an easy way to
meet minority students, and we encourage everyone
who isn't a hateful bigot to attend them; however, to use
this as the principle means of meeting the oppressed is
inefficient in the economic sense. This is analogous to
color-sighted vs. colorblind affirmative action, whose
efficiency Harvard's Professor Fryer has recently analyzed. Wait, doesn't this tokenize a person? Well, having
acknowledged the existence of the sets, queer, black,
Hispanic, female, etc., we are also going to recognize the
existence of members of those sets. There is a school of
thought that equality can be achieved by ignoring difference. And we can look at eye color, which is often not
even noticed, as an example. Why can't sexuality be like
eye color? The differences are twofold. The first is that

als who appear distinct from friends you already have
and making a good faith effort for friendship. This
might appear somewhat patronizing, but please don't be
too proud; so much of what we (the dominant class)
have is built on patronage that to refuse to accept it is a
severe handicap. The act is initially one of patronage;
thus there must be something beyond it or a feudal relationship will be established
a recasting of parent and
child. If a real friendship grows, then it will not be
patronage, but nepotism that flourishes, and out of a
thousand injustices we will have social justice. Even if
this weren't an effective remedy for oppression, it
would at least reduce the alienation plaguing our modern age.
There are those who see homosexuality as others see
alcoholism, and even to see alcoholism in this way is
unhealthy. But for friendship there must exist some
minimum of respect; there must always be recognition
of parity, and past a certain point, condemnation erases
this parity. People view themselves in a positive way
and identify with and assimilate the traits of their
friends. Therefore, people at least tolerate all the traits
of their friends. We understand that one wants more
than tolerance and is right to expect such in time, but
today, for many, even tolerance would be a mighty step.
And this is the beginning. The hope is to sufficiently
populate the upper class (by association) with men and
women who were once outsiders that their traits
become woven into the power structure. A stable society is built for self-replication and once some threshold
has been achieved so that today's equilibrium is pushed
off, we will begin the transition to a new one.

This piece featured soprano Cara Arcuni 'O9, tenor Ben Starr
'll, alto Jackie Werner 'OB and Jamie Birney 10 singing bass.
Alston introduced the next piece, Britten's "A Ceremony of

Carols", by reading some of the lyrics to the audience and deem-

ing them examples of "miraculous poetry." The work began

with a medieval drone and consisted of 10 movements including
Wolcum Yole! and Hodie Christus Natus Est. The fourth movement featured Helen Stott 10 singing soprano. The fifth movement as well as the seventh movement featured Abigail
Weathers 10 on soprano. The last two movements were energetic with the chorus erupting into harmony. The Swarthmore
Department of Music and Dance rehearsal piano accompanist
Mac Carlson enhanced both of Britten's pieces.
Lastly, the chorus performed Leonard Bernstein's
"Chichester Psalms" with text from the "Book of Psalms". The
piece was divided into three psalms, with the first featuring
soprano Erin Martell 'O9, tenor Starr, alto Werner and Eric
Mulligan 'OB as bass. In the next psalm, Erica Evans 11 soloed
in soprano. With quick hits from the drum, the last psalm was
a brilliant chorale. Guest musicians accompanied the entire
work on trumpet, percussion, trombone and harp.
The concert concluded with Alston receiving red roses as
well as a standing ovation from the audience. Many students
are motivated to join chorus not only for love of music, but also
to experience Director John Alston's genius and charisma.
According to Romane Paul 10, "John Alston is a talented and
charming director." Emmanuelle Wambach 'OB also thoroughly
enjoyed the concert and said, "It made me cry...it was so beautiful."

for a Swattie with a lot of work or a busy social life.
According to Kao, however, the morning practices that he
is "strongly recommended" to attend are often worth the
wake-up time. Morning practices have only two attendees
on average, so "there's a lot of one-on-one time working
with the coach, and a lot of work on technique," Kao said.
Sarah Bedolfe 'll, an occasional attendee of morning practices, added, "They aren't too structured and the coach
lets you work at your own pace. I like that aspect, because
I'm not exactly brimming with energy in the morning and
it lets me ease into the workout." Attending two practices
a day (afternoon practices are required whether or not a
swimmer goes to morning practice) can be tough and
time-consuming, but the rewards come when it's time for
a meet. When Kao or Bedolfe manages to squeak by a
competitor in one of their races, all the Redbull-fueled
early mornings seem worth it.

Every Tuesday morning

Vertigo-go, Swarthmore's improvisational comedy group,
and the Cross Country team both claimed to have invented two-ball, but according to Symonds, since the Cross
Country team has adopted all of Vertigo-go's terminology
for the game (see Ball Speak), Vertigo-go now believes that
the invention should be credited to themselves.
Two-ball is played at the foosball table except, as the
name suggests, it requires two balls instead of the traditional one. Some may consider foosball to be just a game,
but two-ball is at another level completely. "Most of us
don't know the rules for one ball foosball. We take the
game so seriously, we have people do commentary sometimes," Symonds said.
Unlike normal foosball, two-ball requires the offensive
players on opposing sides to put in the ball and one team
must score both balls consecutively against the opposing
team. If each team scores one ball, the teams play again
until one team can score both balls.
Symonds not only plays two-ball late at night, but during the day as well. Plans for a two-ball tournament are in
the works and will be open to the public.

Basic Terminology for Two Ball
Early First Ball In: when a ball is shot
straight into the goal as the first hit in the
game. This is very hard to defend against and
utilized by master two-ball players.
Gerriballing: origin, âgeriatrics;â when
one player decides to hold one ball off
while playing the other instead of wildly playing two balls at once.
Climbing the Ladder: clearing the ball
defense and moving it up the field
The Great White: when a player hits the
ball in a way that causes it to fly through the
air and into the goal without touching the
table.

of the most fashion unconscious people I
know, Mickey Katz and Dwight Smith (mad
love, bros!). Among their ideas for my column was to make up a completely ridiculous fashion trend and see if it would catch
on around campus, like wearing your belt
on your head a la Doug Funnie's alter-ego
Quail-Man, and suggesting that they write
a column in conjunction with mine that
would argue the exact opposite of whatever
I said.
Despite their playful mocking and
admission of knowing nothing about fashion, their satirical ideas did get me thinking about the fickle nature of fashion and
its reputation of being overly shallow,
materialistic and illogical. Indeed, I myself
find many aspects of the fashion world nonsensical and oftentimes uninformed, like
the ostentation of Fendi's recent catwalk
show that took place on the Great Wall of
China and fashion's associations with the
likes of vapid socialites and celebutantes
who have the money and media exposure to
flaunt their prosaic, skin-baring "fashion"
creeds to the masses. But in the words of

than that of other aesthetic disciplines, far
behind the fields of art and architecture in
terms of respectability. Fashion tends to be
seen as taboo to many self-described intellectuals for its emphasis on superficial concerns. Indeed, indulging in fashion seems
incongruent with existing inside the ivory
tower. The designer Miuccia Prada seems
to struggle with this inconsistency in her
work. When she joined the family business
in 1978, she was a pronounced feminist and
member of the communist party who had
just received a Ph.D. in Political Science. In

an interview she did for the Financial
Times, she explained, "The problem is that
to be a rich fashion designer you are supposed to be stupid and I hate the idea of
appearing like an intellectual and so I
indulge in a certain camouflage." And perhaps it is better that fashion does not have
the sort of formalized academic air
attached to it. Because in the end, it is a
form of self-expression. And being able to
create a beautiful piece of clothing that can
be universally appreciated, in itself, transcends all of the superficial, anti-intellectual tags associated with fashion.

and whirling out songs of youthful radiance and offbeat beauty, I Saw The
Bloodied Snow But I Did Not See The
Creature warmed the crowd of Olde Club
with its romantic sincerity and impassioned harmonies at the band's first fulllength show on Friday, Nov. 30. As
Stephanie Duncan 'OB, Bizzy Hemphill 'OB,
Nick Forrest 'OB, Dwight Smith 'OB and
Patrick Lindsey 'OB took the stage with
their song "Magical Mystery Tour," the
band's guitars, melodica, accordion and
keyboard swirled together in an insistent
avowal of whimsy and wonder that
swelled and encased the audience, grabbing all those watching and sealing them
in sweeping layers of intimacy, honesty
and sweetness, contagiously spreading a
quiet feeling of connection and understanding.

Somewhat more reserved at first,
Duncan, Hemphill, Forrest, Smith and
Lindsey opened up as the show went on
with the cheers of good friends, old fans
and new listeners. They were playing and
reverberating off of the crowd as much as
it echoed back in a reciprocal relationship
of excitement and energy thatturned Olde
Club into a small corner of song and dance
and youthful idealism. "There were so
many things that had gone wrong before
the show started and I was really worried,
but it was so fun and ,great that people
responded so well to original music,"
Hemphill said.
Everyone truly did respond well to the
music. Neal Dandade 'O6, who came from
Chicago just to see the concert, said, "It
was really a great show and they had all of
us in the audience engaged
it was fantastic." Expertly interacting with the
crowd and each other, smoothly transitioning between songs and creating the
perfect atmosphere of heartfelt sincerity
and casual fun, I Saw The Bloodied Snow
smoothly crafted instruments and voices
into a sound distinctly unique that is part
Beirut, part Mirah (especially when she
sings with The Black Cat Orchestra) but
really entirely their own. Unlike many
college bands, the band sounds new,
refreshing and different, not like an imitation of whatever bands Pitchfork is raving

songs offer a sound that is melodious and
memorable and, quite simply, very good.
For many at Olde Club, the highlight of
the performance was the encore.
Stomping and clapping out a confident
cover of Lil' Mama's "Lipgloss," the band
got everyone in the room stomping and

clapping and singing along with them.
Following their cover of "Lipgloss," they
went into "En Basiant," an old favorite of
twinkling exuberance, happy laughter
and the rippling sound of youth and freshness and beauty, of Orange Juliuses on hot
summer days, a perfectly appropriate way
to wrap up a perfectly wonderful show.
"Since it was the first time we played a
full-length show, we really pulled out
everything we had," Duncan said. "There
was a contingent of the audience that sang
along to our older songs
that was a trip
plus, we played six new songs. Playing
new stuff is usually pretty frightening, but
also exhilarating when you pull it off and
people get into it." If I Saw The Bloodied

such an excellent performance for their
first full-length show, it's safe to say that
we can only expect themto get even better

Smarts and charm at the first Mr. Engineer
BY JOAN KIM

jkiml@swarthmore.edu

Brains and beauty
what more could one ask for? The
first Mr. Engineer pageant, hosted by Swarthmore Women
Engineers to raise money for the Expanding Your Horizons
organization, not only tested Swat's finest engineers on their
wit and talent, but also on their quick calculating skills. Last
Saturday night, Upper Tarble was full of fellow engineers
and fans who witnessed the crowning ofSeth Hara 'OB as Mr.
Engineer with a dazzling caution tape sash.
The hosts, Kara Peterman 'O9 and Kelsey Hatzell 'O9, started the night off with an introduction of the competitors who
cat-walked down the aisle to music such as "Macho Macho
Man" and tried to win the hearts of the audience and the
judges
Anne Krikorian 11, Tane Remington 10, Rosanne
Breakenridge 'O9, Anima Singh 'OB, Kelly Siano 'O7 and Jess

Mandrick 'O7.
The first contest was a test of a good eye and a steady
hand. The competitors had to draw the perfect circle. Some
engineers had a few tricks up their sleeves. Chris Caruso 'OB
took off his belt to use it as a compass. Cyrus Stoller 10 took
out his key lanyard to draw his perfect circle.
The second round tested "speed, skill and knowledge."
With the use of every engineer's best friend, the graphing
calculator, each competitor had to quickly find the value of
a convoluted mathematical expression. Dogus Cubuk 10 was
first to calculate an answer, although it was incorrect. He
knew that speed was his best bet for gaining the mostpoints.
Only two, David Burgy 10 and Sam Garcia 'OB, calculatedthe
correct answer, -0.030108. The answers from all the competitors ranged 11 orders of magnitude.
The last round before the first cuts were made was a test
of strength. The engineers carried buckets of heavy coarse
aggregate, a material that is added to cement to produce concrete, and strutted down the aisle. Each competitor tried to

make his catwalk special by taking off layers of clothing or
giving a calculator to a judge. Cubuk carried four buckets of
coarse aggregate down the aisle and performed a set of lifts
with two buckets in each hand, which was enough to make
any audience member blush. Travis Rothbloom 10ended the
event with a bang by dumping the entire bucket over his
head and nonchalantly walking backstage.
The judges then had to choose five finalists and after calculating the scores to make sure they were both "precise and
accurate," finalists Hara, Cubuk, Caruso, Garcia and Jeff
Santner 'O9 were announced. Some contestants expected others to make it to the finals. Santner said, "I was surprised
Travis didn't make the final five after his spectacular cat
walk demonstration."
Part two of the competition began with impersonations of
engineering faculty members. This event produced many
laughs from knowing engineers in the audience and among
the judges. Then, the finalists were challenged to design "the
next SWE t-shirt." While the finalists put their creative
minds to work, SWE showed a video of "A Day in the Life of
an Engineer." Garcia's shirt had the phrase "Can't Resist
Us" with a drawing of a circuit board and "For U and Me" on
the back. Hara's design had "Smart Boys think know Smart
Girls are Sexy" which produced many smiles from the

though he knew the story behind the paintings, chose to
share a funnier version of the story. He explained how an
engineer in E6 realized how all the students in class "were
bored like hell" and he thought that if he painted pictures on
the wall, that the students would be entertained. The pictures back then were considered to be very funny. Caruso
responded to the question, "If you were a tool, power or otherwise, which would you be, and why?" by choosing the
grease gun. Since engineering at Swarthmore "sucks the life
out of you" and prevents engineers from socially interacting
with others, they lose their "slickness." With the grease gun,
Caruso explained that he could keep a supply of "slickness"
with him at all times. Santner was asked the cliche, "How
many engineers does it take it screw in a light bulb and
why?" Santner responded that it took five or six to set up a
meeting time, get together, wonder why the final group
member was not there, call the last group member and then
finally screw in the light bulb. Garcia was given the final
question: "How would you pick up a date?" He humorously
responded by saying that he would "grab her by the sides
and pick her up."
The prizes were announced. Runners up received prizes

that included miniature slinkies. The winner of the entire

Then came the Q&A, which Cubuk and Santner said was
their favorite part of the competition next to the faculty
impersonations. Hara was first to go and was asked, "What
does the inside of McCabe look like and how many floors
does it have?" Hara said that the Q&A was the toughest part
of the competition for him. "You never know what you're
going to get. I kind oflucked out." Although, Hara, like every
devoted engineer, no longer goes to McCabe library to do
work, being a tour guide kept him familiar with the library
and he answered correctly. The hosts asked Cubuk, "Explain

A diversity of styles featured in the Fall Dance Concert
BY SARAH BRICAULT
sbricaul@swarthmore.edu
Imagine flowing, sensual, flirtatious, even
erotic movements across the stage. Imagine
tap dancers, ballerinas and African ritual
dances. On Friday, Nov. 30 at 4:30 p.m. and
Saturday, Dec. 1 at 8 p.m., Swarthmore students introduced audiences to all these and
more during the Fall Student Dance Concert.
Held in the LangPerforming Arts Center, this

concert was engaging because of both the
diversity of dance styles displayed and the
beauty of the dances themselves.
There were 10 very unique performances,

and each utilized dance in its own rich way.
From a tap performance, to a traditional
Ghanaian dance, from two dancers to 13, from
music created onstage to dancing that began
before the music, there was diversity in every
element of these performances.
The night started with Alma's Rock House,
choreographed by Henry Roy. Skirted dancers
skipped and twirled across the stage, flirtatious and flowing, playing with the music.
A dramatic tone change came with
Parson's Etude, the second performance choreographed by David Parsons. The sensual
motions of three dancers replaced the playful
motions of many, their harsher motions creating a much more dramatic tone. Their

movements were "dry and harsh but still so

beautiful," said Marilyn Batonga 'OB.
The next dance group paraded onstage to

the soundof traditional Ghanaian music from
drums and other native instruments. Their
ritualistic movements and rhythmic music
had the audience clapping along.
The next dance began in silence, with the
two dancers weaving among ten glowing
bulbs that had been lowered from the ceiling.
Their erotic, sensual movements and the
accompanying music conveyed a story oflove
and separation in the piece, entitled "Never
Before." It was refreshing to "see a dance in
which the women do the lifts and are touch-

ing in a very real way," said Claire Galpern

10.
"The relationships between women are
often in the subtexts [but not expressed],"
Anjali Jaiman 'lO said.
After a brief intermission, the concert continued with three ballet performances: variations from The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake
and Ciechi. These three dances captured all
the flowing beauty ofballerinas.
A clip from "A League of Their Own"
began the next section: a tap rendition of girls
playing baseball complete with gloves, bats

and even baseball uniforms.
Skirts made from newspaper and bubble
wrap (and one person dressed as a box) constituted the costumes for the next dance, entitled "Unpacking" and choreographed by

Michael Nguyen 'OB. The unique interpretative dance captured the conflicting elements
of separation and conformity, of leaving and

remaining.

The final performance in the concert was
another African dance entitled "Aaracatu de
Baque Virado." The dancers in this scene
actually brought members of the audience
onstage to participate in a rousing conclusion
to the concert.
The audience, which ranged from
Swarthmore students to professors and families with children, all seemed to enjoy the performance. "I always enjoy the dance concert,"
said Batonga, "[not only was there] good choreography, but also good lighting and costumes." Indeed, colored lights and patterns
played on the wall behind the performers created an interesting backdrop for almost every
dance, and the hanging bulbs for "Never
Before" and the boxes present in "Unpacking"
were particularly effective.
"I enjoyed coming to see what my friends
have been working on," said Galpern. The
concert ended with enthusiastic applause
from the audience a fitting end to a night of
diverse, beautiful dances created by students
at the Fall Student Dance Concert.

Make a 3-D snowflake out of The Phoenix

Living

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

O

BY SARAH BRICAULT

sbricaul@swarthmore.edu
Have you ever wondered what to do with all those
old editions of The Phoenix? Well, one option just in
time for the holiday season is to make snowflakes out
of them! One of my favorite winter crafts is the three-

dimensional snowflake. They are pretty, fun to create
and can make any-size room look more festive.
However, despite its complex appearance, the 3-D
snowflake is actually relatively simple to create. If
you follow the steps below, you can create these delicate, complex-looking snowflakes with ease. (Though
you don't have to tell everyone how easy they were to
make!)
Just

be mindful of the fact that newspaper is much
thinner than computer paper and thus large
snowflakes probably won't work as well. Just slice
The Phoenix along the binding, cut the remaining
pages in half, and then use these quarter-pages
instead of computer paper and follow my five easy
steps to a full-fledged 3-D snowflake, which I've dictated below.
Step 1: Gather your materials.
All you need for this project are six pieces of paper,
a pair of scissors, tape and/or a stapler and a piece of
string. For this example, I used 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper,
but paper of most kinds of and sizes will work as well.
Step 2: Get a folded square.
Take one piece of paper and hold it horizontally.
Fold the top left corner down until you have a right

triangle. Cut off the remaining rectangular section so
that you are left with a square folded in half. (This
step gives you a square piece of paper. If you already
have a square piece of paper, just fold it in half.)

Step 3: Prepare a petal.
Take the folded square so that the folded edge is in
front of you. Take the scissors and make a diagonal
cut from the folded edge parallel to one of the cut
edges. Cut almost to the middle, but not quite (make
sure you leave enough paper in-between cuts to support your snowflake.) Make three cuts on each side so
that the distance in-between the cuts are approximately the same. Your cuts should look like the perforated lines on the leftmost image below.
Step 4: Construct a snowflake petal.
Open up the square and take the triangles created
by the two innermost cuts. Tape them together. Flip
the snowflake over and repeat three times as shown in
the picture. The final result should look like the rightmost image in the picture. This is one petal of your
snowflake. Repeat steps 2- 4 six times.
Step 5: Finish your snowflake!
Take two petals and either staple or tape the bottoms of the petals together. Also connect the x-shaped
middles of the petals together. Continue this process
until all six petals are connected. If you choose, you
can attach a piece of string to a petal to hang your
snowflake.
Now that you've made one snowflake, don't be
afraid to experiment. I've made snowflakes out of construction paper, newspaper, and even Post-it notes!
The smaller the snowflake is, the more delicate and
exquisite it looks and the harder it is to make.
The little ones make great presents or ornaments,
while the large ones can decorate entire rooms in very
little time. The 3-D snowflake is just a simple craft
that's fun to make and looks beautiful when you're

This season, Swatties bring holiday cheer with charity
BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore students are known for
their active commitment to various causes and making their voices heard
throughout the year. Even as the winter
holidays approach, many groups and individuals are making a concerted effort to
give the needs of others extra thought.
A popular form of holiday gift giving
on campus is "adopting a family." Delta
Upsilon has chosen to sponsor one family
consisting of a single mother and her twoyear-old child. According to DU brother
Alex Ginsberg 'OB, the idea was suggested
by Tramane Hall 11, one of the fraternity's recent pledges.
DU was given a "wish list" for the family, including items such as clothes and
toys. Ginsberg did not set an initial goal

for how much money he wanted the fraternity to raise, but after some research,
he realized that a relatively small amount
could go a long way. If the effort is overly

18

successful, Ginsberg hopes that DU will
be able to give some of their excess funds
to other groups pursuing similar projects.

[Adopt a Family]
has a limited scope; but
gives people the
opportunity to do
something concrete.
Zebi Brown 'O9
In addition to setting aside some of the
fraternity's budget for the family, DU
brothers have been tabling at Sharpies.
"People are very giving," Ginsberg said,
commenting on DU's surprising feat of
raising $lO6 in one day. Ginsberg noted
that it is often hard to persuade students
to stop and contribute when tabling at the
top of Sharpies, but he believes that

because Adopt a Family gives students a
chance to "make a personal impact," people have been very generous in their
donations. "My heart was warmed,"
Ginsberg said.
Like DU, Resident Assistants and students living in Willets have also decided
to adopt a family. The initiative was
encouraged by Max Wilson 'lO, who initially volunteered his hall to sponsor a
family. According to Willets RA Zebi
Brown 'O9, enthusiasm from RAs and students alike has been strong. "People have
a vague idea of wanting to help," Brown
said, "The [Adopt a Family] project has a
limited scope; but gives people the opportunity to do something concrete."
In addition to adopting a family-for the
winter holiday season, other groups are
reaching out to the community outside of
Swarthmore. The Student Athlete
Advisory Committee and the Athletic
Department are organizing a holiday food

Even without an organized effort, supporting a worthy cause can be as easy as

their websites, relying on sponsors to
donate money each time the button is
clicked.
One of the most academically oriented
and addictive online donation programs
is FreeÃice.com. The concept is basically
a vocabulary quiz with a purpose other
than to be able to use the word "beshrew"
in a sentence. With support from various
corporate sponsors, FreeÃice donates 20
grains of rice for each vocabulary word
on-line visitors can correctly identify.
According to FreeÃice's website, the rice
is then distributed by the United Nations
World Food Program, helping the needy
"have food to eat, learn skills and find

Alumnus returns with his first feature film
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu
How does a Swarthmore graduate with a liberal arts,
decidedly non-vocational education make a splash in the
world of media? It's a question that professor Patricia White
was intent on answering as she began to establish the college's Film and Media Studies program in 1999. White made
a point of networking with alumni working comfortably in
the media arts. One of them was PBS documentary filmmaker and producer Douglas Chang 'B4 who, White said,
"was somebody I connected with right away." Since then,
Chang completed his first feature film, "Absent Father," and
White has invited him to present a sneak preview on Friday,
Dec. 7 at 7 p.m. in Science Center 101 before the film goes on
to any definitive distribution plan. Joining Chang is the
band responsible for the film's score, M.Fix, which is headed by multimedia artist Madaleine Fix-Hansen and incidentally includes Bryn Mawr College professor Homay King
and Haverford College professor Gus Stadler. M.Fix will be
performing at Olde Club at 9 p.m after the screening.

Douglas Chang on the set of his film "Absent Father".

At first glimpse, "Absent Father" seems like another dispensable indie flick in the predictable Sundance mold
a
teenage girl is faced with pregnancy and the fallacy of her
middle-class existence. But the film has one big twist; its protagonist, Abigail (Jessica Kadish), has been impregnated by
God. This premise, which brings a whole new level of irony
to the film's title, may recall yet another smug indie film, the
satire "Saved!" Indeed, Chang said, "I had originally conceived the movie as almost a comedy."

"But the film seemed to kind of take a life of its own and
took a dark turn," Chang said. "All of a sudden it became a
fairly serious drama with some comic elements...stuck in
the margins." Perhaps the reason for the film's serious take
on its supernatural story is that Chang draws from a very
real inspiration. The idea for "Absent Father" was conceived
by Chang as he saw his good friend Allison Sherman struggle through a divorce and raise a two-year old son on her
own. Sherman would later co-write and produce the film.
The other major impetus for Chang to make "Absent

Father" was his interest in religion and faith. "My personal
feeling is that there are a lot of people out there who sense

that something's missing, that the normal realms of their
experience are not quite adequate to explain what they actually feel and wish for. How they try to express that and how
they try to fill that void is a fascinating thing. Religion is one
very, very strong way that people try to find that connection," Chang said. "I thought why not take it head on and
really look at somebody who's facing a religious dilemma
taken at face value." It's about as face value as a religious
dilemma can get. As implied by the title, Abigail is left pregnant without God's support. Chang describes his film as
more Book of Job than nativity story.
In bringing the tale of the virgin conception to today's
world, Chang hopes to explore "the disparity between a kind
of older faith-driven view of the world with a modern view
of the world." According to Chang, "Absent Father" was

heavily inspired by two classics, Carl Theodore Dreyer's
"The Passion of the Joan ofArc," the 1928 silent film that revolutionized the close-up in film grammar, and Jean Luc
Godard's 1962 "Vivre Sa Vie" ("My Life to Live"), which
looked at how the former film "is treated in much more modernist terms." Chang said. "In some ways, my film is an
attempt to reconcile the two, to try to find how the two are

both different sides of the same coin."

Chang doesn't view his feature debut as very different
from his career in documentary filmmaking. He felt that his
crew worked more like a documentary crew than a big studio production, in part because of a limited budget, but also
because "I love the way documentaries are made," Chang
said. "They have skeleton crews...There's a lot of scraping
around, but people are kind of pushed to bring a lot of creativity to their jobs, whether they're a PA or the director."
Chang felt that documentaries afforded him a deeper
understanding of film. "When you look at a film, on some
level, you're looking at something very real, and on some
level you're justlooking at a projection on a wall. I think that
having a training in documentary...is vital [to learning]
what film is capable of capturing in terms of reality and
what it isn't." Chang also credits the single film class available at Swat when he was an undergrad. "There was very little in the way of resources, but I think the grounding that I
got just from learning from [retired professor Kaori] Kitao's
class
was in terms [of] really understanding the lan...

guage."
It's the genuinely independent nature of Chang's filmmaking that has White excited about introducing his work

to students. "As somebody who has been working in various
media sectors and really not doing the mainstream thing,
Doug would have a lot to say to current students who are
interested in film from all different angles," White said.
The future of "Absent Father" is still up for grabs, and it's
not likely that you'll find a theatrical release stateside anytime soon. Having participated in the Religion Today Film
Festival in Rome, Italy this past October, Chang has been
making connections abroad, where there seems to be greater
interest in his film. Still, Chang said, "My background in the
PBS world has sort ofmade me think about kind of outreach
possibilities, where the film can actually reach groups that
would respond to the story in a special way
I'd love for
religious people to see it, even if they think it's controversial." Chang wants to go "beyond just marketing the film to
really looking at who stands to benefit from the question
that arises from a film like mine." Particularly, Chang said,
"I think the people who've responded very strongly to the
film tend to have gone through some period of real loss or
mourning that they've not always been able to express to
other people or to quite understand themselves, and hopefully, the film seems to hit a note with them."

Night of Scenes gets surreal for better or for worse
BY ALEXANDRA ISRAEL
aisraell@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, Dec. 1 and Sunday, Dec. 2,
the lights went up in Science Center 101 on
Drama Board's Night of Scenes. Thirteen
actors and two directors put together two
playwright Christopher
short plays
Durang's "The Actor's Nightmare" and
"This is the Fargans" by Eli EpsteinDeutsch 'lO. Both plays were equally absurdist, creating implausible situations and
ultimate universes in which surrealism
reigns over reality and the characters are
caught up in a vortex of circumstances outside their control. The major difference
between the two works, however, is that
Durang's piece, while fast-paced and
-

packed with literary references, never
takes itself so seriously that it loses its audience while Epstein-Deutsch's play seems
designed to confuse everyone except the
playwright and played out with a purposeful obtuseness that left the audience feeling

unsatisfied.

It is only appropriate, however, to begin
at the beginning with "The Actor's
Nightmare." Durang's gem of an absurdist
short play presents the audience with the
hapless George Spelvin (played with appropriate comical confusion by Julian Chender
'O9), an accountant who is placed in the
middle of the titular nightmare. He arrives
at a theater, not knowing how he got there
and looking for an exit, only to be informed
that he will be playing the lead in the show
that night. Poor George is unaware of what
play he is appearing in, doesn't know his

THE PHOENIX

lines and is given nothing but offhanded
dismissals when he asks his fellow actors
what the show is and who he is playing.
The acting in the Durang piece was
excellent across the board, with particularly strong work by Chender and Sarah Noble
'lO, who played the haughty ingenue Sarah

Simmons with appropriate snobbery and
panache, all the while looking smashing in
a yellow evening gown. Will Treece 'll
turned in a comical performance as fellow
actor Henry Irving, playing both
"Hamlet"'s Horatio and an executioner
with wit and good comic timing. The direction, by Dustin Trabert 10, better known as
Phil "The Shape of Things" and as the
Booty Man, was solid, playing up the comedy properly while still creating pity for
Chender's confused accountant.
"The Actor's Nightmare" was every-

thing witty and wonderful that "This is the
Fargans" strove to become. EpsteinDeutsch's piece told (as far as this reporter
could guess) the story of five Fargans,
played with immense lasciviousness by
Melissa Cruz 'lO, Nat Sufrin 'll, Radwan
Dahhan 10, Kate Aizpuru 10 and Matthew
Thurm 10. These five actors gave the
Fargans something of an air of the fairies in
"Midsummer Night's Dream" but with bigger vocabularies and much less characterization to work with. The Fargans were, it
appears, created by an evil genius Doctor of
Ceremonies, played by Sven David Udekwu
'O9. The Fargans take advice from a medium played by Claire Sumdayeng-Bryan 10
and are locked in something of an epic
struggle with an evil organization known

only as the Fratboys and based out of
Arby's. At least, I think that this was the
story. I could be completely off base, as the
piece was short on plot and long on incomprehensible - although often rhythmic and
alliterative philosophical discourses.
Despite the difficulties presented by the
script, the acting in the piece was very
strong. The Fargans were dedicated to the
difficult physical aspects of their roles,
rolling around the floor in their underwear
and using vocalizations of both their lines
and other sounds to great effect. The real

December 6, 2007

-

standout, however, was Udekwu's Doctor of
Ceremonies. Udweku took a role that could
have easily been played as a cliche of a mad
scientist and elevated it to a great, creepily
comic performance, using his big voice and
maniacal facial expressions to create an
impression of absolute control over his cre-

ations' lives. The moments that Udweku
was on stage, rolling his tongue around the
alliterative lines and focusing all attention
on his character, were the few moments
when the mediocre script was elevated to
weird, fascinating greatness.

The changing face of conservatism
One of the
truisms which
the media tells
us that we are

supposed

to

about

American cul-

ture these days

JOEL SWANSON

Sound and Fury

is
that
country

the

is

becoming more
religious, and

that this will

necessarily
translate into a more conservative political
environment. The 2004 election supposedly
proved that the country is dominated by "values voters" who are socially conservative and
numerous enough to potentially decide the
fate of our elections. Karl Rove made courting such people part of his strategy to build a
"permanent Republican majority" following
President Bush's election in 2000.
Unfortunately, the actual evidence does
not support this media narrative. America is
neither becoming more and more Christian,
nor are Christians turning the country inexorably towards the political right.
A recent survey conducted by the nonpartisan Barna Group, which studies religious
beliefs and attitudes among Americans,
found that young Americans are increasingly
rejecting the label of Christian. Whereas 77

percent of Americans over the age of sixty
refer to themselves as Christian, only 60
percecnt of 16 to 29 year-olds are willing to
use that label. And even those who do still
consider themselves Christian feel increasingly hostile towards the practices of the
church in this country. Half of all young
Americans who attend church regularly
nonetheless
described
institutional
Christianity in America as "judgmental,"
"hypocritical," and "too involved with politics." Fully 80 percent of young Christians,
and nearly all young non-Christians, perceive
churches as "anti-homosexual." And while
most of those surveyed, Christians and nonChristians, approved of the values of Jesus,
the prevailing sentiment seems to be that
Christians no longer represent these values.
According to David Kinnaman, the president
of the Barna Group, our generation "is
becoming increasingly secular."
How did this happen? How did evangelical
Christians go from a movement that was supposed to reshape politics in this country in a
permanently conservative direction to a
movement that is today largely reviled by
young Americans?
Most likely, the exclusive focus of many
conservative Christians on social issues,
namely abortion and gay marriage, had a
large part to play in this shift. By pushing
these issues at the expense of others, evangel-

ical Christians made themselves seem like an
outlet of the Republican Party, rather than a
genuine spiritual movement. Historically,
politically active Christians have cared about
a lot of issues, such as poverty, slavery and
the environment, but evangelicals seem to
have totally forgotten about this legacy. It's
hard to picture Pat Robertson or the late
Jerry Falwell marching with the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr, against racial injustice. It
seems much easier to imagine them railing
against his support for democratic socialist
economic policies and his opposition to the
Vietnam War, despite the fact that he couched
all of his proposals in Biblical rhetoric.
Fortunately, there are positive signs that a
genuine sea change is occurring among
American Christians. Evangelical Christians

had been a primary base of support for
Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq, but polls
show their support for this military misad-

venture slipping. According to William
Hybels, the pastor of Willow Creek
Community Church in Illinois, one of the
most attended churches in the country, "The
quickness to arms, the quickness to invade, I

think that caused a kind of desertion of what
has been known as the Christian right."
White evangelicals, who were supposed to
vote Republican more reliably than just
about any other demographic group in the
country short of registered Republicans, are
now more likely to identify as independents
or as Democrats than they are as
Republicans. And less than halfof them continue to support President Bush. When Bush
doesn't even have the support ofhis most reliable voting bloc, he should know something
is wrong.
Politically active Christians are also
increasingly looking to issues beyond polarizing culture war social issues. Richard Cizik,
the Vice President for Governmental Affairs
of the National Association of Evangelicals
and one of the most influential evangelical
political activists in the country, has publicly

declared that opposition to global warming

needs to be part of the evangelical agenda.

When some other prominent evangelicals
criticized Cizik's position, he went so far as to
accuse them of being influenced by ties to oil
companies.

Evangelicals have also become

more active in human rights and poverty
related causes. Richard Land, the president
of The Ethics & Religious Liberty
Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention and one of Bush's strongest supporters on Iraq, has lobbied Bush to take
more action to combat the genocide in Darfur,
Sudan. In one of the more unlikely alliances
in recent memory, Southern Baptist leaders
worked together with feminist activist Gloria
Steinem to lobby Congress to be tougher on
human trafficking and prostitution. Even
traditionally right-wing organizations like
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition have not
been immune to some of these more progressive concerns. Joel Hunter, who was scheduled to become president of the coalition at
the beginning of the year, was forced to
resign due to his open support for causes
such as a higher minimum wage, and abolition of the death penalty. He also helped draft
an open letter to President Bush in support of
the creation of a Palestinian state, which was
signed by more than thirty other evangelical
leaders. The Catholic Church has similarly
broadened its political agenda. On Nov. 14,
Catholic bishops meeting in Baltimore

approved a guide for Catholic voters for the
2008 election which affirmed Catholic opposition to torture, genocide, and the targeting on
noncombatants in war zones. The guide goes
so far as to say that Catholics can vote for a
candidate who favors legalized abortion if
other ethical concerns outweigh that one.
This is a far cry from the days of the 2004 election, when many bishops wanted to deny
communion to John Kerry for his pro-choice
stance.
These are all positive signs that Christians
are beginning to understand why young people today view them as hypocrites, and are
taking steps to remedy this perception.
Despite their increasingly secular outlook,
young people still overwhelmingly approve of
Jesus. If only Jesus's followers acted more
like him, they would engender more respect.

DU thanks supporters
To the Editor:
On behalf of the brothers of Delta
Upsilon, I would like to recognize and
thank those generous hearts of the
Swarthmore community whose dona-

tions will make it possible for us to show
our adopted family that they are not

alone this holiday season. While tabling
for charity in the front of Sharpies often

yields as much frustration as success,
all of the brothers who had the chance to
help this week said they were amazed by
the number of people who not only
acknowledged their existence but also
responded with enthusiastic selflessness. In just a week, you have helped us
raise enough to give a little girl and her
mother most, if not all, of the items on

their wish list; any money left over will
go to other groups on campus who have
adopted families. All of DU thanks you
wholeheartedly for embracing our goal
and reaching into your pockets to help
us reach it.
Additionally, we want to voice our
deep appreciation for those who were
unable to donate any money yet offered
to give of themselves in other ways.

Whether you decided to make presents
yourself or volunteered to advise us

December 6, 2007

when we shop for women's clothing, or
even if you simply promised to get your
friends to donate, your thoughtfuhiess
was inspiring.
Finally, we want to ensure that due
credit goes to all of the other groups on
campus who adopted families or who
have embraced the holiday season's
spirit of giving in some other way (specific shout-outs to Phi Psi for its work
with Swat Sudan). Swarthmore is
blessed with a wealth of people who genuinely care about improving the lives of
other people and we ofDelta Upsilon are
glad to help in whatever way possible.

Once again, on behalf of the brothers
of DU, thank you for your generosity. We

are humbled.

College Republicans

re-start conversation
As a student body, it seems as though we consider conversation, debate, and the sharing of experiences to be
the hallmarks of the Swarthmore experience. Yet, with a
predominantly liberal student body, one could say that
conversations in past years have been decidedly onesided. Over the past 14 years, the College Republicans
have existed on-and-off as an operating group, and with
its recent revival, it seems as though Swarthmore may
be shaken up
but in a good way.
Before this announcement, it seems as though there
had been quite a few complaints within the Swarthmore
community about the lack of political diversity on campus. While ethnic groups and socioeconomic backgrounds are fairly well distributed amongst the student
body, it seemed as though political opinions were quite
left-leaning. One can look to the televised coverage of students watching the fall 2006 elections in Mephistos
wherein students cheered emphatically when states
turned blue and booed unhappily at the slightest tinge of
to get a good handle on just how strong liberal senred
timent on campus is.
Yet, amidst all of this, there seemed to be an air of dissatisfaction with the political landscape on campus.
Those with more conservative leanings - seemed discontent with how polarized the campus was to the point of
extreme discomfort when voicing their opinions for fear
of hostile responses. Left-leaning students felt as though
something was missing from their self-edification: a dissenting opinion that would challenge them to think
through their own beliefs. With few conservative students willing to express their opinions, liberal students
were left to construct their arguments amongst likeminded peers, rather than in the presence of students
who differed from themselves. There were, in effect, few
to no conversations happening.
To say the least, the revival of the Swarthmore
College Republicans is one that will likely cause quite a
stir on campus. Whether the event is met with negative
or positive reactions will be left to the student body, but
the potential for important discussions is quite high. We
have sincere hopes different voices will begin to emerge
within the student body and that collaboration between
the Swarthmore College Democrats and the Swarthmore
College Republicans will follow. But until that happens,
let the much-needed conversations begin.

Hypocrisy can spark change

And

because we ordinary folks are its

argument

that is,
persuasion.

There is an infuhowever, that goes unnoticed as a
result, and it can be found in every discourse from
those on the political stage to the ones in the pages of
this newspaper. It's the buzzword "hypocrisy." We've
become so enamored with the word and its easy application that we've forgotten what hypocrisy means or
why we can't stand it. But a close examination yields a
surprising reality: Hypocrisy is not always the evil we
think it is. It can be one of the most powerful tools for
good available to us.
riating tendency,

From business suits, speeches and
commercials to all the pleases
and thank-yous that characterize
our society, yet seem so
unnecessary on the surface,
hypocrisy is there.
...

Defending hypocrisy should start with defining it,
and this is perhaps where the root of the problem lies.
The popular aphorism of the hypocrite is "do what I
say, not what I do." But today's expanded definitionhas
come to include "what I have done, regardless of any

current personal opposition to having done it." The
standard of hypocrisy is now much lower, and we look
at perfection as if it were a legitimate option to the contrary. How many political careers have fallen on the
barbs of a marijuana leaf? How many children start
smoking because their parents couldn't overcome the
hypocrisy of telling them not to, but they had in the
past? We look for spotless, infallible role models as if
they were just around the corner, and anything short of
it isn't good enough. The first complaint against those
who cry hypocrisy at the drop of a hat should be simple:
that people change.
That's only half of the solution, though. What about
the hypocrites who change in the span of mere days?
Hours, even? Aren't they then deceitful and not merely
misled? It depends on what can be

December 6, 2007

termed deceit. As

bizarre as it is to say it, today's social codes are based
on euphemisms, facades and other little lies. For example, the notion of sportsmanship
in personal experience, beating the crap out of someone on the rugby field
typifies a form
and then shaking his hand afterward
of hypocrisy that we unabashedly admire. Our glorified
concept of romance is candlelit dinners and elegant
attire, even if animal sexuality is the only thing underneath. From business suits, speeches and commercials
to the welcome mats and warning labels and all the
pleases and thank-yous and ladies and gentlemen that
characterize our society, yet seem so unnecessary on
the surface, hypocrisy is there.

The first complaint against those
who cry hypocrisy at the drop of a
hat should be simple: that people
change.
Modern thinking seems intent on stripping down the
little hypocrisies that act as both fabric and facade for
society. Sportsmanship isn't as strong a force as a shoe
deal in the NBA; professional sports are mostly played
by mercenaries who get paid to win, not to shake hands
afterwards. Popular music is also taking a turn to the
blunt side of things
the first songs that come to mind
are Akon's "I Wanna Fuck You" or the Ying Yang
Twins' subtle masterpiece "The Whisper Song," wherein the rappers express their intents to "beat the pussy
up," interjected by gems like "wait till you see my
dick." It's not the wildly sexual lyrics that are the issue
of consternation
that's what differentiates the
defense of hypocrisy from backwards conservatism.
Rather, it's the rejection of the hypocrisy long held
sacred in the music industry that claims if you want to
talk about smoking, drinking and fucking, you don't
write a song called "Smokin', Drinkin', and Fuckin'"
(Ice Cube, 1998). When musicians violate that standard,
it not only takes the fun out of deception, it takes a certain value out of it, too. The hypocrisy that exists in
this case teaches us wit and subtlety. But it can also
teach us courtesy, humility and virtue. To be frank is
human, but to be hypocritical is occasionally divine.
Puritanical thought would have us believe that animal instincts are dangerous. Modern thought would
have us believe that they're our most genuine, that
society's little polite lies are the danger. But it takes a
fine line between the former and the latter, between too
much lie and too much truth, to do good. When we
teach our children not to screw up like we did (or continue to do), we're striving to be more than human
while acknowledging that we are human. That's the
hypocrisy that holds us together. So rather than be
quick to decry hypocrisy in argument, we should question whether it's being used to make empty promises or
promote the sacrosanct disparity that exists between
who we are and who we try to be.

CANDIDATE FOR CAMPDS LIFE REPRESENTATIVE
ANDREA CORNEJO 10
My name is Andrea Cornejo 10, and the first couple of
weeks on campus, I looked around and couldnât see how
there could be anything to complain about here at
Swarthmore, everything seemed to run so smoothly. It
was through a gradual process that hidden discrepancies
and oddities about social, financial structures per se, came
to light.
I think Student Council this semester has done an effective job bringing certain aspects of campus life setbacks to
administrationâs attention, and bringing forth commitment to change these issues. Undoubtedly, I pledge to continue in their proactive footsteps to making Swarthmore
campus life better for the student body in general. I would
also make a further commitment to explore social, cultural
and even financial issues more in depth. For instance, during Class Awareness Month, (month long activities to raise
awareness on class issues) several overlooked or unad-

dressed issues have materialized, such as stringy
resources for incoming lower class students, that I have
been planning on bringing to the attention of administration.
As Campus Life Representative, I will communicate student concerns and inquiries to administration and make
sure they are acknowledged. I have been working closely
with several Alumni groups, a great resource for information and support for any activity. I am familiar with a
majority of student group leaders, and those who I am not
familiar with I would be delighted to get to know. My greatest strength is I am no conformist, and am constantly compelled to pursue a solution or an answer to enigmas I
encounter. All of these qualities and many more will help
me be a successful Campus Life Representative.
I am going to go out on a limb and make a bold assumption that as Swarthmore students, we want not to be negated and fed generic answers. Instead, we want substantial
explanations for why processes, structures and policies are
as they are. Because if we know this, if we were to know
the precise details of why our meals donât roll over, of why
there are students on campus who cannot afford their
books, etc., we will be able to understand the best way to
promote, and request change. By talking to student
groups and individuals, I will see what issues need to be
brought to attention, use my council position to present it
to appropriate Deans and/or administration and work with
both students and administration to find the best way to
approach student body issues.
I believe my equality driven character along with my
perseverant and outspoken personality will be a great combination for Campus Life Representative. I look forward to
hearing from you, thank you for your time and have a
great tomorrow!

College life is not only about academics. Donât get me
wrong, as a Student Academic Mentor, I definitely endorse
studying for exams and preparing for classes. I also understand that you experience college life only once in your
life and Iâm here to make sure that itâs the most rewarding
and unforgettable four years in your life for learning and
self-development.
As a contributor for the Living and Arts section of The
Phoenix, Iâve learned about three important aspects of student life- student activities, what students are most interested in and listening to students and the administration
for their opinions. These tools are important to use as a
Campus Life Representative. Iâm always around to listen
to any opinions or concerns about campus life. You could
approach me in person or perhaps Iâll overhear you in
Sharpies. Either way, Iâll make sure your opinion is heard,
since I plan to be active in discussing current policies in
debate and in brainstorming ways to improve Campus

Life.
Iâll make sure to facilitate communication between the
students and the administration and encourage all students to speak up about their opinions on Campus Life. As
Campus Life Representative, I will not only fulfill duties
such as ensuring all Student Council sponsored events are
publicized, but I will be accessible and actively represent
the student bodyâs diverse views on plans and policies for
the college.

JENNIFER Yl 09
Hi, my name is Jennifer Yi, and I want to be your campus
life representative. We need to make some changes to improve
the overall quality of life at Swat, and I am the person to do it!

If elected I would work for:
Better food: Have you ever thought that Sharpies food just
isnât as satisfying as the tour guides made it sound? I will
work for better food quality and longer hours so that you are
not left starving at midnight when you have to write that
paper.
Better events: Ever thought that going to that party or
event wasnât worth the opportunity cost of three hours of not
being able to study? I will work for a greater variety of events
that are more spread out so that you are not so stressed.
Better facilities: Have you ever not been content with the
dismal lighting in McCabe or our meager gym facilities? I will

work towards better facilities so that we can do what we love.
Better access and service: Have you ever felt like you
couldnât approach a member of student council? I am here to
do what you want me to do. I encourage all of you to contact
me with any and all questions, suggestions, or concerns so
that I can bring it up with student council and the administration.
As your campus life representative, I will work with student council and the administration to demand that your
needs/goals/wants are met. Vote for me so that I can continue
to bring new and innovative ideas, services and facilities to
this campus! I have experience, I am qualified and I want
your vote. Vote Jennifer Yi!

CANDIDATE FOR STDDENT EVENTS ADVISOR
LACEY DICKINSON 10
My name is Lacey Dickinson and I am a sophomore. I was
appointed to the Student Affairs Committee last spring, and
began serving my term this fall. As a young buck my freshman
year, I enthusiastically attended various on-campus events,
and continue to do so. I cannot begin to fathom the emptiness
of a life without the standard Saturday night Paces party, or a
midweek pizza study break. Taking part in making these
events happen as a member of SAC has been a fulfilling experience thus far, and I now hope to expand my participation in
enhancing the social schedule of my fellow Swatties as the

Student Events Advisor.
I am a great candidate for Student Events Advisor, not only
because I am passionate about providing and attending a
plethora of entertaining on campus events, but also because I
have the experience that would allow me to fulfill the duties of
Student Events Advisor. In my freshman and junior years of
high school, I participated in student council acting as chairperson of various committees that planned school-wide events.
During my senior year, I acted as a student liaison to the school
principal on a board that served to inform school administrators of the condition of the student body, and organize various
school-wide charitable campaigns. Participation in these
organizations throughout my high school career allowed me to
develop key leadership, coordination and organizational skills.
This semester, I worked as a Swarthmore phone-a-thon caller,
calling alumni and parents of current and past students.
Begging strangers for contributions has certainly strengthened
my communication and interpersonal skills.
If elected Student Events Advisor, I would like to make SAC
a friendlier, less ambiguous and less intimidating group so that
a broad range of students feel comfortable interacting with us
and requesting funds for their events. In order to alleviate the
ambiguity often associated with SAC and throwing campus
events, I would insist on holding at least two informal study
breaks a semester that would allow curious potential event
hosts to casually interact with SAC members and ask questions. This sort of structured, informal interaction would not
only serve to give SAC a face, but also reduce the amount of
intimidation that may be associated with having to present
event proposals to the committee. If elected, I would also push
to include a FAQ section on the SAC website, which would
allow students to review the main regulations at a glance, and
perhaps clarify the multitude of regulations affiliated with
holding an on-campus event.
Thus far, I have been an ardent member of the Student
Affairs Committee, and would love to spread my fervor to
Student Council. If elected, I would channel my passion for
SAC, along with my past experience, towards my duties as
Student Events Advisor.

Eye on Venezuela
BY JUAN VICTOR FAJARDO GOMEZ
ifajardl@swarthmore.edu
Last Sunday, Venezuelans were summoned
to the voting urns and asked whether or no
they supported the constitutional reform pu
forth by President Chavez. I
included a total of 69 change
to articles in the current con
stitution (written by Chave

OP-ED

himself in 1999), among which the followin

two stood out: an extension of the presidentia
term from five to seven years as well as fh
possibility of immediate and indefinite reelec
tion, and the dilution of the Central Bank'
autonomy from the branches of government
Both of the suggested changes are incompati
ble with the current system of government in
Venezuela and involve a fundamental chang
in the structure of government.
At about 1:30 a.m. on Monday, the pertinen
electoral institution announced a partia
report of the results. They read as follows
with a 44 percent abstention rate, the constitu
tional reform received 49.29 percent of th
votes in favor and 50.70 percent of the votes in
opposition. The proposed reform was turned
down by a difference of less than 200,000 votes
The result is certainly comforting. A radi
cal reform like the one proposed is not neces
sarily a bad idea for a democratic nation, bu
in practice, the changes would have been irreversible. As shown by the electoral results, th
Venezuelan society is almost divided into two
perfect and deeply polarized halves. In a situa

tion of such polarization, and with an unusu
ally high abstention rate, a shift of this magni
tude would have forced halfof the population
to live under a system of government wit]
which they didn't agree.
The victory of the opposition is importan
not only because of its outcome but because i
is a victory for a weakened and questionec
democratic system. In a way it is a legitimiza
tion of democracy in Venezuela and o
Chavez's status as democratic leader. The
actuality of either of these implications is, in
fact, not the most important question to have
in mind. The aspect most worthy of contem
plation is the impact of this unprecedentec
electoral defeat for Chavez on the concept o
citizenship in Venezuela.
Even though the act of voting is often seen
as the ultimate expression of the democratic
citizen, in Venezuela we are challenging tha
paradigm. Chavez, the opposition and the

Venezuelan constituents are more than ever
aware of the fact that Chavez's will can be both

at odds with and overruled by the will of the
people. The fact that less than 200,000 voters

saved the country from what would have been
an institutionalized polarization of Venezuela
makes every citizen realize the potential they
have to decide what future they want or, in
this case, don't want, for the country.
For that reason, the ultimate expression o
the democratic citizen in Venezuela is more
profound. Venezuelan constituents have
awoken from a stupor of political indifference
and now live and breathe an opinionated and
heartfelt political life. The true democratic cit
izens are on the streets voicing and fighting
for what they believe in. If there is something
that we, Venezuelans, need to thank Chavez
for, it is this rediscovered sense of patriotism
and nationalism.
For those of us who live this new demo
cratic experience in Venezuela from what is
practically academic exile in the north, it is
important to find refuge from political inactiv
ity in expressing these thoughts with the peo
pie around us. Chavez is a man who has
impacted my country in many ways and that
will be in power for at least five more years
The challenge for us is to regain control of the
helm, harness his power and redirect the
nation toward a future ofreconciliation.

Central and South America begin leaning to the left
Big things are afoot
lately in the societies

Â»

that we "Americans"
like to forget are part
of America proper,
too. In the past few
years, Central and
South American countries have been experiencing small, but sigYOSHI JOHNSON
nificant
revolutions of
Yo, It's Not That Deep an electoral-democratic variety. Ostensibly
reacting to the persistence of economic and social ills, as well as U.S. influence in
the hemisphere, these Latin American societies are experiencing a self-conscious lurch towards the political left.
While recent developments in Peru, Mexico and Colombia
suggest that the region's trajectory will not be consistently
uni-directional, a discernible break from the political status
quo in favor of fresh and sometimes novel political

approaches is certainly underway.
Most recently, this past Sunday, Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez asked his people to approve significant new
reforms to the country's constitution. He proposed some 70
changes, the most significant of which were eliminating the
limit on the number of terms a president can serve, creating
certain communal forms of property, ending the central
bank's autonomy, altering the administrative and territorial structures of the country and instituting several laborrelated policies.
What did his people give him for an answer? To the
v
world's surprise, they gave him a resounding "No!" Sure,
given that the measure was only narrowly defeated, it wasn't exactly "resounding" in a conventional sense, but for a
politician accustomed to landslide electoral victories, the
rejection of the referendum was an irrefutably meaningful

defeat.
Since it is alleged that even many Chavez supporters
rejected the reforms, either through voting or through
abstention, to what were Venezuelans responding? Experts
believe that the proposals were just too much too soon; more
specifically, most Venezuelans, Chavistas included, were
not prepared to entrust so much power to one person. On

these grounds, I think that the people's answer was the right
one. The value of strong democratic tradition, it seems, has
not been lost on Venezuelans, even after several years under
a highly reform-oriented ruler such as Chavez.
I am, on the other hand, curious as to whether other
reforms might yet be implemented, such as the proposed
establishment of a pension fund for laborers in the informal
sectors of the economy. On some level, I am tentatively hoping that at least some of the more socially democratic measures find their way back on future ballots. Given that such
measures alone would most certainly pass, I would like to
see just how successfully Chavez could implement and manage redistributive programs like this pension fund.

The value of strong democratic
tradition, it seems, has not been lost
on Venezuelans, even after several
years under a highly reform-oriented
ruler such as Chavez.
You see, the endeavors in this vein are what amount to
small but" significant revolutions. They represent part of
that self-conscious shift towards the left that I mentioned
earlier, alternatively viewed as a sort of pro-democratic
revision to a very historically anti-democratic, neo-liberal
project. Free and open markets, fiscal austerity and privatization have not significantly alleviated rampant inequality and poverty in many Latin American societies
indeed,
and so disillusionthis historical reality persists today
ment with the Washington-backed neoliberal agenda has
driven them in search of other political and economic solutions.
Am I saying that Chavez and his policies are just such a
solution? Hardly. On the political front, Chavez has moved
to curtail freedom of expression in some troubling ways.
(Although to be clear, Venezuela is still characterized as
having a robust and vocal political opposition movement,
one that controls much of the media there.) He also seems
to have become preoccupied with the country's poor; not so

much for their own sake, but more for the sake ofmaintaining and increasing his own power.
On the economic front, meanwhile, the capitalist
machine is alive and clipping along in Venezuela, despite
Chavez's attempts to dress it in the trappings of socialist
revolution. In fact, Venezuela's rich are only getting richer,
while the poor have arguably benefited only marginally
under Chavez's policies.
On the other hand, what first began in Venezuela as a
populist reaction to persistent ills there has spread to the
rest of the region. A populist meme, as only politics of the
Latin American variety can sustain, has been promulgated
throughout the hemisphere: growth and progress, yes, but
above all else, democracy and equity. In this sense, there's
still something to be said for Hugo's shenanigans.
Chavez's antics also embolden the more pragmatically
minded (and less dramatically inclined) reformist leaders of
the region to enact incremental but significant change without fear of rebuke from the U.S. In countries like Brazil,
Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Nicaragua, governments have cautiously explored alternatives to the neoliberal project, variations on the one-size-fits-all "Washington
consensus" which are more adequately tailored to the historical context of their countries and the needs of their peoples. Increasingly, Latin American governments are shaking free of the constraints of a U.S.-devised neo-liberal vision
so that they can re-envision their societies on their own
terms and with reinvigorated mandates from their people.
All in all, I guess I'm trying to say that I find the rumblings down south rather exciting. Chavez: sure, he's not all
that, but the broader political undercurrent he and other
Latin American leaders represent is something we wouldall
do well to note. Perhaps the only other region from which
we're seeing mounted such a potentially significant resistance to the U.S.-backed neoliberal agenda is East Asia. The
Chinese brand ofeconomic plan and vision, however, represents a very different movement, one bereft of ideals like
equity and equality, and one that is taking place against a
decidedly less democratic backdrop than the foment in
Latin Americancountries. For the next decade, I'll have my
eyes cast anxiously in the direction of Venezuela and Brazil
down south for the stirrings of quiet revolutions.

Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organization curbs nation's progress
meltdown more complicated as it has made
the tenacity of Zimbabwean mentalities
insipid.

CHENGE MAHOMVA

Wawona
What happens when Zimbabwean state
institutions can no longer manipulate and
restrain civil society to the whims of the dictator? The Zimbabwean government has to
find another weapon to use and the weapon
ofchoice is Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence
Organization.
The CIO, the official intelligence agency,
can be simply described as the corrupt and
ugly distant cousin to the United States' CIA.
The CIO was created by colonialists in the
early 1960s in order to keep an eye out on
Southern African revolutionaries (or terrorists). When Zimbabwe received independence in 1980, it would have been intuitive to
disband the CIO. However, the CIO was kept
and, in an ironic turn of events, the CIO now
terrorizes and harms Zimbabweans in a
manner that is similar to the colonial CIO.
The only difference is that Zimbabweans
now suffer at the hands of their fellow countrymen. The ClO's presence makes a solution to the "Zimbabwean Crisis," the undemocratic state and the searing economic

24

The ClO's greatest strength is that is has
had the ability to dilute the influence of
opposition parties. One party, the Movement
for Democratic Change, is presently
Zimbabwe's most feasible and influential
opposition party. The party appeals to the
Shona ethnic majority, the Ndebele ethnic
minority, small and large business and
landowners and even the smallZimbabwean
white community. The MDC unites everyone because most people share the goal of
overthrowing President Robert Mugabe.
The power of the MDC was shown by thenslight electoral success in 2000, where the
party won 57 electoral seats even under electoral conditions that where generally
declared undemocratic.
Sensing that the MDC was threatening
the power of Mugabe's party, Zimbabwe
African National Union Patriotic Front,
the CIO unleashed a plan that swiftly split
the MDC through infighting. The bonds
between the different groups within the
MDC are fragile as their interests vary; the
only common interest is for economic
reform and the removal of Mugabe. The CIO
was very aware of this and used the media to
put pressure on the already brittle bonds
between the interest groups within the
-

MDC.
The

CIO has a firm hold on Zimbabwean
media; the World Press reports that The
Financial Gazette, The Daily Mirror and The
Daily Mirror on Sunday, three of the most
popular and once independent newspapers,
have now been infiltrated by the CIO. Eddie

Cross, a leader within the MDC, wrote earlier this year, "This past week the MDC has
been headlines every day all negative sto-

ries designed to show that the MDC is divided, its leadership weak and indecisive and
that we are incapable of really effecting
change." With only two independent newspapers left, it was difficult for the MDC to
oppose these claims and at present the
MDC's political power has been diluted as
the party has split into two factions.
The CIO is relentless and at times creative with the undemocratic and unlawful
tactics that it uses to discredit opposition
leaders. In the run-up to the 2002 presidential elections, the CIO put MDC leader
Morgan Tsvangirai on trial for treason. The
evidence was an alleged grey and spotted
filming of a conversation between Canadianbased political consultant Ben-Menashe and
Tsvangira. The BBC reports that, "it was
obvious that the tape had been heavily edited in an amateurish attempt to put incriminating words into Mr. Tsvangirai's mouth.
The clock in the corner of the CCTV [closedcircuit television] footage kept on flicking
backwards and forwards."
The CIO also has the ability to make the
constitution and the laws that govern
Zimbabwe malleable. In the late 19905, the
CIO started suspending and confiscating the
passports ofhuman rights activists and journalists who the CIO felt would discredit the
president. When the CIO began its confiscations, it was both illegal and unconstitutional. In order to prevent people from appealing, the constitution has recently been
amended. The ClO's actions have made finding a solution to the "Zimbabwean Crisis"

December 6, 2007

more complicated as these actions have
shifted Zimbabwean mentalities. Through
fear, the CIO has managed to move
Zimbabweans away from striving for
change regardless of the cost. The CIO has
different divisions and some of the most
feared units are those who recruit inconspicuous civilian youth under a flirtatiously
innocent name: The Zimbabwe National
Youth Service. The common nicknames for
this group, however, such as "the Green
Bombers" and even "the Taliban", give
insight into the torture and pain they inflict
on citizens suspected of supporting the
MDC.
To

illustrate the ClO's ability to hamper a
solution, one only has to look at Operation
Murambatsvina, a.k.a. "Operation Drive
Out the Trash". This operation was cloaked
under the pretense that its aim was to
reduce the spread of infectious disease
through eradicating squalor. The operation

attacked and demolished the homes and
small businesses of the urban poor. The UN
reported that 700,000 Zimbabweans lost both
their homes and there income because of
Operation Murambatsvina. It is no coincidence that the urban poor were targeted.
The MDC's core support comes from
Zimbabweans living in urban areas.
This situation makes a solution to the
Zimbabwean crisis complex, so that neither
an Iraq-style military invasion nor the current fruitless negotiations between the MDC
and ZANU-PF can change the new
Zimbabwean mentality: To hell with collective action my survival comes first!

Swat men suffer tough losses after injuries
BY CONOR CASEY
ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

Sometimes the first one is the hardest one to get
The men's basketball team (2-3, 0-2 CC) is still looking
for its first conference win of the year after falling to Johns
Hopkins University 73-59 last Saturday and to McDaniel
College 66-61 on Nov. 28.
In the game against defending Centennial Conference
Champions Johns Hopkins, Swarthmore found itself at a disadvantage with the loss of starting forward Matt Turner 10,
who had incurred a season-threatening injury two games
before. Classmate and name-sharer Matt Allen 10 started in
his place as part of Swarthmore's three guard offense.

"The talent is there, so we should be
able to start picking up wins."
Noam Fliegelman 'OB
The Blue

Jays took advantage of Swarthmore's

initial

height deficiency and just over two minutes into the game,
took the lead for good. Major contributors for Hopkins
were Doug Polster, who led all scorers with 20 points and
shot 7-10 from the field on the day, including 3-5 from threepoint range, and Collin Kamm, who put up 13 points on the
day.
For Swarthmore, lan McCormick 'OB grabbed his fourth
double-double of the season, tallying 19 points and 11
rebounds, in addition to five blocks. Fellow senior Steve
Wolf 'OB contributed 11 points and eight rebounds, and
Raul Ordonez 'O9 came off the bench with 13 points and
seven rebounds in 21 solid minutes.
A bright spot on the day for the Garnet was that
Swarthmore out-rebounded the Blue Jays 41-34, and

amassed more steals (4-2), more blocks (8-2) and more

assists (11-10) than its Baltimore counterparts.
Swarthmore, however, suffered from the free-throw
line, making only 15 of 31 attempts, good for 48.4 percent.
Similarly, its shooting average from the floor was an
almost equally unimpressive 38.8 percent. To add insult to
injury (or the other way around) 2006 Centennial
Conference honorable mention Matt Kurman 'OB sprained
his ankle in the game, limiting his playing time.

Center lan McCormick tries to stop a drive by forward Sam Lacy as the Garnet prepared for last night's game.
The game against Johns Hopkins followed a disappointing loss the previous Wednesday to the McDaniel
Green Terror, a team that finished tied for sixth place
with the Garnet last year with an 8-10 record in
Centennial Conference play.

The game saw three of Swarthmore's starters put up big
numbers. McCormick had another big game with 16 points
and 14 rebounds, Wolf added 12 points and seven rebounds,
and Noam Fliegelman 'OB put up a season-high 14 points.
The Terror, meanwhile, had stats less gaudy but more
spread out. Forward Chad Arrington led all McDaniel scorers with only 12 points. Nevertheless, the Green Terror
bench came alive for 20 points, while the Garnet subs
could only produce nine points.
The story for the Garnet was essentially one of "too little,
too late." While it outscored its opponent by nine in the second half (34-25), the 14-point deficit it entered halftime with
proved to be too much to overcome. And while Swarthmore
repeatedly tried to get three-point shots to fall, the Garnet
continually missed, shooting just 71 percent in the game
from beyond the arc (1-14), and going a collective 0-10 from
three-point range in the second half.
According to head coach Lee Wimberly, the Garnet is
not playing in the same style that it did in its first two non-

conference victories.
"We've gotten away from trying to push the ball up
court," he said. "The turnover ratio has been lousy, whereas it was good the first couple games."
Players maintain that the team's shooting is off.
"We're not shooting the ball well, especially from the
guard position," Allen said. In particular he praised the
play of McCormick, whose play he called "phenomenal,"
but added that "we need to have other people step up."
Fliegelman agreed. "We need to help out on rebounding, not just lan, but the other centers and forwards as
well." According to Fliegelman, "The talent is there, so we
should be able to start picking up wins."
The injuries the team has endured so far, both to
Kurman and Turner, have certainly had a negative impact
on the season to this point, though Wimberly praised the
players for their resolve.
"The guys have stuck together," he said. "It's tough
when you have expectations, but they've overcome adversity, and I give them credit for that." But, he acknowledged, "We're not nearly as good as we were when were at
full strength."
The men played at Muhlenberg College last night in a
game too late for this edition, but will return home this
Saturday to face off against last year's number two playoff
seed Ursinus College at 2 p.m.

ten greatest sports moments in my Swarthmore tenure:

Moment number 4. Supporting Swat athletics in the most stylish way I know how. If you have better ideas, let me know.
9. Perpetually lifting 15 pound dumbbells (and occasionally making it to 20!) in the gym while surrounded by
lacrosse and basketball players. Maybe if I grunt you'll
think I'm tougher?
8. Being in the bathroom when Swat scored the winning
goal in overtime against Frostburg State this Fall.
Wondering why fans were running onto the fieldbefore the
extra time had started.
7. Forcing Worth courtyard naked laps and claiming
matchmaking prowess because of it. (Can I also take this
space to point out that it's a bad idea to try to strip while
running and that I've seen the abrasions to prove it?) I'm
going take the liberty to combine this with another nonalcoholic Beirut moment. Taking Swarthmore men's basketball all-time scoring leader Matt Gustafson 'O5 and general crazy person Chris Rose 'O5 into overtime in my first
game of Beirut ever. It was totally legit that I was sober
and thus may have a had the slight advantage in hand-eye
coordination. That second round of cups was the most
beautiful pyramid I will ever see in my life.
6. Playing a spontaneous game of Red Rover on Parrish
Beach with my freshman year hall the first week of classes and again the last. Sorry, here's the sappy part. Nothing
like starting out your Swarthmore career with a clotheslining from two senior guys twice your size.
5. Watching my roommate sink a half-court shot at the
halftime buzzer in a Swarthmore basketball game freshman year. Wishing I had athletic skill.

4. Sporting underwear with "SWAT" written across the
backside to a women's soccer game junior year. Not minding that I looked like a fool because, hey, it's Swarthmore.
Taking that same attitude to my appearance and behavior
most other days of the year.
3. Inventing, with the help of my sophomore year block,
a truly epic game, Competitive Bra Unhooking. It's challenging, it's violent, and it's amazing. No nudity involved,
I promise. Look for more information during Senior Week.
2. Watching both the men's and women's swim teams
beat F&M at home last year. Along with everyone else in
attendance, I went hoarse. I may have gotten just a little
teary-eyed at the end. And again writing the article.
Frampton, don't laugh.
L Mercilessly heckling opposing soccer players and
their haircuts, making the most obscure sports metaphors
possible, arguing over the best NFL quarterback to the
point of rage, eating as much Key Lime Pie as the human
stomach can hold (a sport, if you've never tried it), and discussing the meaning of life on the rugby sideline with the
best co-editor and friend I could ever have asked for.
A few months remain before I have to say goodbye to

this school, but it's not too early to say, thank you Swat.
Thanks athletes, hallmates and partners in random acts of
foolery. It's been so good I've occasionally forgotten that I
don't have a football team to root for.

sad about the results."
In the singles matches, Kimberly Kramer
10, Maithili Parikh 11 and May Maani 10
won at first, second and sixth singles,
respectively. Losses came for Kelly, Alice
Xiang 10 and Karma Lama 10 at third,
fourth and fifth singles. First doubles team
Kramer and Parikh won their match, while
second doubles players Kelly and Xiang and
third doubles players Lama and Maani lost
their matches, giving Drexel the 5-4 victory.
This past weekend, the Mid-Atlantic Jr.
Nationals was held at Bryn Mawr College.
Swarthmore College came in second place in
the event, one point out of first place. The

Mid-Atlantic Juniors competition's results

were as following: Kramer won Women's
Singles overall; Parikh came in second place
in Women's Singles; Kelly made it to the
quarterfinals; Xiang made it to the semifinals in Women's Singles Consolation; Robert
Manduca 10 and Cole Armstrong 10 represented Swarthmore in the Males' Singles
match and played well; Kramer and Parikh
won Women's Doubles overall.

"Anyone who has played
badminton can say what a
great sport it is. It can be
as physically demanding
as any other sport."
Hitesh Bhattari 'OB
"Many of us have been sick lately, but
we still managed to achieve second place
in the collegiate competition, losing to

Drexel by only one match," Kramer said.
"Every member gave their all this weekend, and it's no question that each person
is an essential, integral part of the team."

This particular tournament was different from Classics in that there were different age categories: under 1L under 13,
under 17 and under 25. This gives the
young children that train and play badminton a chance to experience the thrills of
a de facto competition and to show off their
budding sportsmanship.
"There was a lot of smallkids playing,"
Hitesh Bhattari 'OB said. "It was quite a
scene to watch small children running
around the court hitting shuttles. 'Love for
badminton' I would call it." He added,
"Badminton at Swarthmore is both an individual and a team sport. It is individual in
a sense [that] the games are either singles
or doubles. It is a team sport in a sense
every game you win brings points to
Swarthmore. I joined badminton since my
freshman year. It has been a very pleasant
experience. Learning badminton with
Bhavin [the team's coach] has been a great
experience. In the U.S., badminton is a
grossly neglected sport. But anyone who
has played badminton can say what a great
sport it is. It can be as physically demanding as any other sport."
Since the last tournament, Bhavin has
had the players focus on clearing (when

December 6, 2007

one hits a high shot from the back of one's
side to the back of the other side), serving
and footwork. The members are aiming to
become more consistent in terms of gaming strategies and to keep a positive mindset even when not performing so splendidly during a game.
Practices typically entail first running
laps on the indoor track, stretching and
doing duck walks and sprints. Next, the
players warm up their shots on court.
Coach Bhavin then divides the team into
individual groups and has them tackle
certain areas of weakness. At the end of
practice, the players play games against
each other in simulated matches for extra
practice.
The team has recently acquired a
brand new player, Celeste Abou Negm 'O9.
"I think team will have a lot of great successful games ahead of us," Kelly said.
The team is done with matches utnil after
winter break. "Most of our games are next
semester in February, and I envision our
team going all the way."

After starting its conference season off
with a big upset victory over McDaniel
College, the women's basketball team suf-

fered two tough losses to Johns Hopkins

University and Muhlenberg College in the
last week. With the two losses, the Garnet
fell to 1-2 in the conference, 2-4 overall.
On Saturday, Swarthmore was dominated by the Blue Jays from the get-go, as Johns
Hopkins outscored the Garnet 41-22 in the
first half. The Jays shot 42.9 percent from the
field in the half to Swarthmore's 25.9 percent, and got 13 points from its bench compared to only two from the Swarthmore substitutes. Hopkins was able to build on its
lead in the second half, outscoring
Swarthmore 37-23 despite equalling the
Garnet's shot percentage of 33.3. Lyndsay
Burton and Kristin Phillips of the Jays led
Hopkins with 12 points each to earn a 78-45
win, and Phillips added 12 rebounds, a teamhigh. Hopkins' Britni Lonesome led the
team in both assists and steals, with four of
each. For Swarthmore, Kathryn Stockbower
'll earned a game-high 15 points and also led
the team with 12 rebounds, while classmate
Ceylan Bodur added 11 points ofher own.
On Tuesday night, Swarthmore traveled to Muhlenberg and faced off in a

deficit proved to be too much to overcome
in the end, as the Mules prevailed, 74-64.
Against Muhlenberg Swarthmore shot an
improved 42.0 percent from the field,
including going 7-14 from behind the
three-point arc, with four of the treys coming from Bodur. Bodur had 18 total points
in the game to lead the team, and
Stockbower had 17 in addition to 15
rebounds. Kaitlyn O'Malley of the Mules
led her squad with 16 points, and Kaitlin
Strumph came off the bench to contribute
10 of her own. Muhlenberg made particularly good use of its deep roster, as it used
twelve players on the night, only two of
whom played less than ten minutes.
Despite its recent losses, the team's play
against McDaniel made it excited for what
it can do in the future. "In the McDaniel
game that we won we really showed how
good of a team we can be," Kristen Traband
'OB said. "We really executed on offense."
However, she said, "In the past couple
games we haven't been able to have that
offensive fire ... We've shot ourselves in the
foot a little because we've had so many
turnovers."

It's cold. The trees are bare.
The sun sets at 5 p.m. Tests and

longs for the warmth of past
days, it's crucial to retain your
sanity through some form of
catharsis. My ritual recipe consists of YouTube with a pinch of

football.

The beauty of YouTube lies in
its ability to preserve moments
of the past: Liverpool's unbeliev-

deficit in Istanbul, Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer's memorable injurytime winner at the Estadio Camp
Nou, Ryan Giggs' unilateral
mauling of the Arsenal defense
in the 1999 FA Cup semifinal and

In protest to losing their
enraged
young
talisman,
Fiorentina fans rioted in downtown Florence, resulting in the
injury of 50 people, proof that
Baggio was destined for greater
things. During his subsequent 5year sojourn in Turin, he won
everything that one could possibly win as a player, including
the FIFA World Player of the
Year and European Footballer of
the Year (Ballon d'Or) awards, as
well as the Champions League,
Scudetto
Coppa Italia and
(Italian League).

The team is working on regaining theedge and aggressiveness that
allowed it to defeat the Green Terror, one of
the conference's best teams. "If we believe
that we can match other teams physically,
we have the skills to do that," Laura
Popovics 'OB said. The upperclassmen are
also excited about how the team has been
able to come together, and especially about
the new additions to the squad. "We've
meshed really quickly from the beginning,"
Traband said. "Kathryn [Stockbower] has
proven that she can be one of the best players in the league. Ceylan [Bodur] has provided us with a lot of depth, she's a really
potent threat out there on the wing. We
mental

have a more balanced offense than we have
in previous years."
Despite recent losses, the team is keeping
its energy and enthusiasm up. "I don't think
anyone is down right now because I think
they realize that we just played two of the
best teams in the conference," Pam Costello
10 said. "We really do have a chance of finishing high in the league."
This Saturday, Swarthmore will hope to
get back on a winning track with a non-conference game at Goucher College, and then
will play its last game before winter break at
Bryn Mawr on Tuesday. The Owls are currently tied for last place in the conference
with a 0-3 conference record, 2-4 overall.

memories of Baggio

long list of formidable trequartista (three-quarters), other-

wise known as the second striker

position, playing in between the
midfielders and forwards. He

brought glory to Italian football

and is fondly remembered by
fans worldwide.
I remember the first time I
watched Baggio in action, a
group-stage

match

against

Czechoslovakia in the 1990 World
Cup. By halftime, Italy had
already taken the lead on a goal
from top scorer
Salvatore
Schillaci. And then it happened,
a moment of sheer magic that led
to the goal of the tournament.
Baggio receives the ball from

the left-hand side of the pitch,
just inside the Czech half. He
plays an elegant one-two, dribbles past a defender, and with
two players in front of him, hits
a splendid shot into the bottom
of the net. I'll never forget the
expression I had on my face, a
young Phil Lee mesmerized by
such exquisite technique.
Baggio then became my idol,
the center of all my conversations. It impacted all aspects of
my life including my hair, prod-

uct of an inspired hairdresser

who completed her first "Baggio-

cut."

I retained the pigtail for six
years, proclaiming myself as the
Korean Baggio ready to wreak
havoc on the lives of my playground opposition defense. I

never defended, staying true to
my trequartista (lazy) nature,

and always proclaimed the superiority of my idol in lunchtime
"who's the greatest footballer in

the world" arguments. Baggio
was my world.

Anne Miller, Swarthmore's new record holder in the 1650-yard freestyle after finishing second in the event on Sunday, practices her stroke on Monday afternoon

"Miller sets another Swarthmore record at F&M Invite
BY GENEVRA POTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore swim teams faced off against their
most formidable competition of the season last weekend at
the Franklin and Marshall Invite, held over two days in
Lancaster, Pa. The Garnet earned a total of 53 season or
lifetime bests, finishing fifth in both the men's and
women's meets out of nine and ten teams, respectively.

n

Kutztown University, Rowan University and host
Franklin and Marshall College controlled the scoreboards
in both the men's and women's meets, finishing in the top
three places. Rowan was victorious for the men with 680
points, and Kutztown for the women with 686.5.

One significant disadvantage for Swarthmore coming
into the meet was that it had not slowed down its schedule
to prepare for the competition, while other teams in attendance had tapered and shaved for the meet. "Basically we
went into that meet off one of our hardest weeks of training and everyone else was shaved and ready, so [coach]
Chris [Daly] and I were pretty pleased," coach Sue Davis
said of the teams' performance at F&M.
"Although the other teams at the meet had all tapered,
we didn't let that hinder how we swam," Reid Wilkening
'lO said. "Overall after a very hard week of training, both
the men's and women's teams competed very well."
The personal bests for the team included another
Swarthmore school record for Anne Miller 'lO, as she
swam a second place finish in the 1650-yard freestyle in
"'

18:02.07, 10 seconds behind Rowan University's Samantha
Edwards. Allison Bishop 'll (fifth, 18:35.07) and Sarah
Bedolfe 'll (13th, 19:23.11) also swam to personal bests in the
mile, as the Garnet women gained 35 of their 377 total
points in that event.

28

Sally Chang 'll also swam a personal record 2:15.80 and
Fatima De Vol 'll swam the best 100 back of her career in
1:08.97. For the men, both Tramane Hall 'll (29.87) and Kyle
Skolfield 'lO (28.19) swam to personal best times on their 50yard breast stroke legs of the 200 medley relay, and Connor
Morrison 'll earned a personal record of 5:2216 in the 500
freestyle. Lorenzo Ramirez 'lO earned his own personal
bests in both the 50 freestyle (29.19) and 100 freestyle
(1:1141).

"Although the other teams at the
meet had all tapered, we didn't let
that hinder how we swam."
Reid Wilkening 10
The Garnet women dominated the 100 butterfly, with
Miller (58.94), Casey Osborn 'lO (1:01.61) and Jennie Lewis
'OB (1:02.03) finishing first, fourth and fifth in the event.
Other top performances for the Swarthmore ladies were
Miller in the 500 freestyle (third, 5:17.63), the 400 medley
relay team of Allie Jordan 'O9, Stephanie Su 'll Miller
and Lewis (fifth, 4:13.90), the 800 freestyle relay squad of
Osborn, Franny Zhang 'OB, Chelsea Brett 'll and Miller
(fourth, 8:14.35), Osborn in the 200 butterfly (fourth,
2:17.82) and the 400 freestyle relay team of Claire Shelden
'lO, Lewis, Brett and Zhang (fifth, 3:49.91).
Top-five finishers for the Swarthmore men included
Andrew Frampton 'OB in the 500 freestyle (fourth, 4:56.61),
the 400 medley relay team of Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9,
Sterling Satterfield 'U Brian Roth 'O9 and Michael Ahn

December 6, 2007

10 (fifth, 3:45.47), the 200 medley relay team of GilchristScott, Skolfield, Roth and John Heagy 'OB (fifth, 1:4141),
the 800 freestyle relay squad of Heagy, Satterfield,
Frampton and Ahn (fifth, 7:32.76), Satterfield in the 200
breaststroke (fifth, 2:20.18), and the 400 freestyle relay
team of Gilchrist-Scott, Santiago Lombo 'll, Heagy and
Ahn (3:2153).
One of Swarthmore's motivations for competing in
the Invite was that it is one of the meets during the season that most closely mimics the multi-day schedule of
the Centennial Conference Championships, held Feb. 2224 at F&M. Though the meet came at a difficult time with
swimmers already under academic pressure, it apparently served its function. "The F&M Invite was excellent
preparation for conferences," Zhang said. "There were
many tough races."
The team decided to give an award for outstanding
swim for each of the three sessions in the meet. The prize
was won by Ramirez, De Vol and Blaise Sheridan 'O9 for
each session, and Miller took home the award for the
meet as a whole.
For its last challenge before winter break, the highlight of which for the team is a ten-day training trip to

Puerto Rico, Swarthmore will face off against Rowan at
home on Saturday at 2 p.m. Rowan showed last weekend
that it continues to be a threat, and the Garnet hope to
step up and get fast swims in its home pool.
"We'd like to see everybody get season-best times,"

Daly said.

Davis also promised the possibility of record-breaking
swims for fans in attendance at Saturday's meet.
"Rowan's got a chance of breaking some of our pool
records and I think we have a chance of breaking our pool
records," she said.
