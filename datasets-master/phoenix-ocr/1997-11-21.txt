Friday, November 21st, marked the end of
Poverty Awareness Week at Swarthmore, the
University of Pennsylvania and other colleges
across the nation. Several events have taken
place on campus throughout the week such as
the Clothing Drive, Penny Wars, Meal Donation at Sharpies, and a screening of the awardwinning documentary, "Poverty Outlaw". The
events were sponsored by Empty the Shelters
(ETS), a national anti-poverty organization
founded in Philadelphia 7 years ago. More than
300 people signed up to give up meals on
Wednesday and Thursday in Sharpies. The food
was taken by ETS Swarthmore members to
Kensington, North Philadelphia's poorest district. The food was distributed to impoverished
families as a part of the Kensington Welfare
Rights Union's (KWRU) regular food distribution. The week closed with the Sleep-a-Thon,
where more than two dozen Swarthmore students slept on Parrish Beach, calling attention
to the rise of poverty in this country.
The weeklong event culminated with a talk
by Cheri Honkala, founder ofKWRU. Honkala
has been homeless four times in her life. In her
address, she reflected on her emotions during
the holiday season and the new era of capitalism. She began by reading a poem describing a
poor woman who shot herself because she could
not support her family. Honkala dedicated the
poem to all the poor families that have given up
on life in the last few years. Honkala attributed
the poverty crisis in this country to three main
factors: the globalization of jobs, the trend in
downsizing, and the end of welfare. She went
on to discuss the new policy of workfare, calling it "slave labor", saying that impoverished
families are forced to work for a welfare check
that does not provide them with enough money
to survive.
Honkala urged students to become involved
in the her movement by working with KWRU
in Philadelphia and writing letters to Washington. "This is a time when sitting on the sidelines is not morally acceptable," remarked
Honkala, "This is our turn as a people not to
live in fear, make sure that no one goes to bed

Student Council overturns suspension
Budget Committee decision to suspend Phoenix
Editor nullified in marathon meeting

In response to an appeal brought to Student Council by George Balgobin 'OO and
Arun Mohan 'OO, editors-in-chief of The
Phoenix, the Council last Sunday voted to
nullify Budget Committee'srecommendation to suspend Balgobin from the Student
Publications Office for one week.
The issue in question arose on October
30 when Publications Coordinator Sam
Schulhofer-Wohl '9B found that a membe
r of The Phoenix staff had failed to secure
the door to the publications office, which
contains $3O-40,000 worth of equipment.
According to Schulhofer-Wohl, this discovery marked the second time during the
semester that The Phoenix had closed the
office improperly. After the first incident
occurred in early September, SchulhoferWohl had warned Balgobin and Mohan via
e-mail that a second infraction could result in suspension, as stated in the rules for
the publications office. Because suspending the editors of The Phoenix would seriously cripple the production of the paper,
Schulhofer-Wohl claimed, he did not want

to take such a drastic step without first con-

sulting BC, his employer.
Balgobin and Mohan explained that the
October 30 incident occurred because The
Phoenix does not have enough permanent
keys to the publications office. Consequently, Balgobin was unable to activate
an alarm before leaving the office at 5:30
a.m. because he had given his key to Mohan
earlier that evening. Balgobin cited the
early morning hour and rainy weather as
reasons why he chose not to make the trek
to Ben West to sign out a temporary key.
Contrary to Schulhofer-Wohl's assertion
that Balgobin neglected to secure both the
alarm and adeadbolt, Balgobin maintained
that he did secure the deadbolt.
On Sunday, November 9, BC recommended prohibiting Balgobin and Mohan
from entering the Student Publications
Office for a period of one week. Mohan
and Balgobin objected to the suspension
because they had not been told that BC was
going to discuss the matter and therefore
were not present when the decision was
made. Heeding the advice of Dean ofStudent Life Tedd Goundie, BC decided not

to enforce the suspension and to reconsider

theirrecommendation on Sunday, November 16, when Mohan and Balgobin could
attend the meeting. However, both editors
did lose their permanent keys to the publications office for that week and were obligated to sign out a key from Ben West each
time they wanted to work on the paper.
At the November 16meeting, Balgobin
and Mohan questioned why both editorsin-chief should be punished, since
Balgobin was the only member of The
Phoenix staff in the publications office on
October 30 when the door wasn't fully secured. Several members of the BC felt that
both editors-in-chief must face punishment
for Balgobin's actions, just as they are both
ultimately responsible for the content of the
paper and for the performance of their staff.
Moreover, by failing to ensure that
Balgobin had a key, they reasoned that both
editors had shown negligence.
Balgobin and Mohan also claimed that
precise rules about locking the door had
not been made clear to them initially.
Schulhofer-Wohl said that he had talked to
the editors about the importance of locking the door when he gave them two permanent keys at the beginning of the fall
semester, expressing verbally that there
would be repercussions if this rule was bro-

ken. But Balgobin and Mohan said that they
were not made aware of the precise implications of failing to secure the door until
Schulhofer-Wohl sent them an e-mail several hours after the door was first left unlocked. (The general rules posted in the
publications office say that the door must
be locked, but do not list penalties for infractions.) Thus, they argued that BC cannot justifiably count the October 30 incident as a second offense.
BC Treasurer Vincent Jones '9B refuted
this claim, saying that at Swarthmore and
in the world at large, people are held accountable for breaking a rule regardless of
whether they had prior knowledge of it.
Committee member Lindsay Herron 'OO
then suggested that the events of the previous week had fulfilled thepurpose of a punishment by making the editors fully aware
of the necessity of locking the door. But
other members resisted dropping further
punitive measures because they did not
want to send a message to the college community that "people don't have to take the
rules seriously," according to Ryan
Peterson 'OO.
Many members of BC also felt that
Balgobin's initial response to the incident
was "inappropriate," and indicated that he

Rohan Hoole and Sarah Benis have started an email publication to discuss issues that Swat
students face as members of a global community.

Srinnvasan

The Citizen, a new weekly e-mail publication started by Rohan
Hoole 'OO and Sarah Benis 'OO, is "trying to build a network for
ongoing discussion of stuff that is important," said Benis. The
first issue, sent out on November 15, included articles on such
global topics as Nike labor standards in Vietnam and recent criticism of President Clinton's Republican trade bill.
The idea to launch The Citizen came out of "frustration" that
Benis and Hoole have been feeling at "not being able to make a
difference," said Benis. With The Citizen, Hoole and Benis want
to create a forum for people all over the country who care about
what is going on in the world today and want to make a difference.
The first edition of The Citizen was written entirely by Hoole
and Benis with editing help from Kate Doty 'OO. Out of their
250 subscribers, Hoole said that they "have not received a negative review yet," and that people who have written to them have
been very enthusiastic about their efforts. The network is expanding as people send the publication to their friends, who then
ask to be on the mailing list. Once they get 1000 subscribers, a
web site will be created with links to different interest groups
and the archives of The Citizen.
Comparing Swarthmore today to what it was like in the 19605,
Benis said that "students had more of a role in shaping things."
She hopes that The Citizen will enable students to get involved
in issues that they care about, knowing that there are people all
over the country who share their interests and concerns. The Citizen is open to involvement from students everywhere and hope
to have a multi-school staff and involvement soon

It doesn't hurt to

be a little exclusive
Perhaps one of the qualities the
College takes pride in the most is
its non-exclusiveness. Granted, the
non-exclusive nature of the College
reaps many benefits, but it also
comes at a cost. In particular, the
ease with which students ascend to
positions of power has become
alarming. Sophomores rule the
world, pronounced Acting Dean of
the College Bob Gross at freshman
orientation last year.
But should they?Positions ofpower
are also positions ofresponsibility, and
they should be assumed by experienced, capable and dedicated individuals. Mind you, seniority does not equal
competence, although one could argue
that the former is certainly reflective of

the latter.
We are not saying that all current
student leaders are incompetent, but
the fact remains that right now
many student organizations lack a
set of mechanisms by which the
quality of leadership can be monitored, thus affecting the quality of
the activities themselves. The issue
is especially pressing right now for
groups such as the student government and the student newspaper.
These are the hallmark student institutions of any college—people
look to them to gauge the quality
of the College itself. Sitting in the
admissions office, for example, are
copies of the current and past issues of The Phoenix. Under
exisiting rules, anyone can run for
editor-in-chief, even students with
no journalistic background at all.
(The supposed counteracting
mechanism is the restriction that
only students who have written for
the paper three times or more are
eligible to vote.)
A similar situation applies to Student Council. In the case of SC

elections, partly because of the lack
ofenthusiasm on the part of the student body as a whole—students
can make their way to office by
simply running a half-hearted campaign. Candidates are elected on
dismally low turnout rates. Many
of them haven't even really thought
through their platforms at all. Their
qualifications never come under
scrutiny at any point. There are no
speeches, no debates, no nothing.
We are not calling for a thorough
professionalization of student activities. And we also realize that
due to certain inherent limitations—for example, the size of the
College and the restricted amount
of funding—we can only push our
standards so far. Because student
leaders have such little accountability—they are unpaid and in
most cases elected by a very crude
democratic process—there is little
that motivates them apart from selfintiative and a sense of responsibility. But what we would like to
see is a concerted effort by students
and the administrationalike to raise
the quality of student activities to
another level. There are many ways
of achieving such a goal: either
through implementing a more rigorous election/selectionprocess for
student leaders and also creating
incentives to promote a higher level
of dedication and committment.
Our main mission at the College
is to acquire knowledge, but knowledge comes in many forms. A good
extra-curricular setting serves as a
fertile training ground for practical skills such as leadership and
organizing. We deeply feel that the
College should try to foster an environment conducive to reigniting
students' passion for making a difference.

The inhumanity of
technology
New technology is always a
mixed blessing. Information and
communication technologies are
no different. Our desire to stay in
touch with people that we are
physically separated from has
spawned the technologies of postal
systems, telegrams, telephones and
now, Internet e-mail. Our desire to
acquire and disseminate information to places far away from us has
led to the development of the printing press, radio, television and now,
the Internet. These technologies, it
seems, have made "keeping in
touch" a convenience. Sending
your friend a humorous message,
keeping up with your favorite basketball team or perhaps finding
some arcane fact about Kant, as
AOL might advertise, just a click
(or a few search engine queries)
away. Having theworld at your fingertips is certainly a fantastic prospect, but the technology that makes
this possible necessarily changes
the world we have, forbetter or for
worse. What exactly are we keeping in touch with?
The Internet has the potential to
transform both America's leisure
and business activities as powerfully as any medium ever has, assuming it's eventual, and seemingly inevitable, market permeation. College students are by far
the heaviest users of the Internet,
due largely to the accesibility and
efficiency of Internet connections

on campuses. Social and non-social activity on-line comes at the
expense of physical social contact.
The extent to which this is a negative consequence is unclear, but email and chatrooms lack the humanity of any previous forms of
communication (excepting the
telegraph), including telephoning,
handwritten letters or a face-toface conversation. Fortunately, the
Internet is not intrinsically limited
to typed communication, and
many people take advantage of
teleconferencing technologies that
allow one to hear and, perhaps, see
their partner in conversation.
One reason that the Internet enjoys its popularity at the moment,
however, is that the incompleteness of the medium allows for anonymity. This anonynimity is central to the near lawlessness, or
maybe virtual freedom, of the
Internet community. If the Internet
is any reflection of humankind's
behavior in an anonymous and free
state, then freedom consists primarily of fan clubs, inane chatter,
commercial interests, pornography
and intellectuals. Just as one would
suspect. There is nothing in the
Internet's structure that limits it to
cold, quasi-social modes of interaction. Hopefully, it's development
will not be a mere expansion of
those partaking in it's current form
but a evolution into a more human
technology.

Letters to the Editor
Disband Swarthmore football team for the sake of everyone involved
To the Editor:
I just had the opportunity to scan
the Garnet football results for the
first time. I am hurting for the
members of that team. Hey, I recognize that Swarthmore has never
tried to be a "Big Ten power", that
team sports like football ride on a
bunch of scrappy individual's willingness to carve out some time to
build a team. Students and faculty
have had a tradition of seeing football as Swarthmore's running joke.
Maybe S'more players do see
themselves as a bunch ofEinsteins,
their unruly hair sprouting out of

their helmets. On the other hand, of
all the sports on campus, football
may have a reputation as some archaic throwback, essentially incompatible with the 'higher' cultural
goals of the college.
I am biased. I was fortunate to be
part of two really winning teams. I
know that was a rare occurence. But
this year's schedule was appalling,
not so much for the losses as for the
depth of those losses, the frighteningly lopsided scores. I see those
scores and I hurt physically and
emotionally. I know how it feels to
be humiliated again and again in

front ofhundreds of people. Been
there, done that.
It isn't a joke, much less a running joke. It results not only in low
self esteem but in injuries which
can last a lifetime. Demoralized
players get hurt. They also can do
badly in other aspects oftheir lives.
Swarthmore has a long tradition
of laughing off its football losses.
Perhaps it is time for that tradition to end. If the sport can't be
supported in a way that will not
injure the players...if the students
who attend aren't able to train and
play fully...if the competitors are

Another look at smoking in Tarble lounge
To the Editor:
I know you get letters about
smoking in Tarble Lounge practically all the time. This letter, however, does not propose to combat
the problem head-on, or even to
subtly creep up from behind and
frighten it into submission. This
letter will in no way cloy the problem with jejune badinage or bandage the oozing issue with gauze
in hopes that temporarily stanching the flow will stop the spread of
this unctuous contagion.This letter
intends to have very little to do with
smoking in Tarble Lounge. Let us
instead address a larger issue, a
problem that arose before the vile
sucking of cigarettes became a
problem and has outlasted and currently overshadows any other vexing issue surrounding that hallowed
space: The seated portrait of Newton Tarble.
Mr. Tarble sits in sage wisdom,
overseeing his teeming lounge with
the same mimp, the same benign
gaze, and a perennially changing
shade of lipstick. This illustrious
benefactor, whose progeny
Alcampus Space Tarble and Gay
Mroom Tarble are lovingly memorialized in the rooms of the
extortionistic Sharpies substitute
which bears his name also gave us
the money for the mysteriously
condemned structure next to Mertz.
Newton was a long-lived, extraordinarily wealthy man, who had but

one problem: He had the longest
and possibly the world.
Next time you waltz into Tarble
for your Jolt and low-fat banana nut
muffin, take a break from your stuffing and if you can see through the
blue haze of cigarette smoke, scrutinize the portrait of our sainted
benefactor. The distance from his
shoulders to his coccyx is at least
four feet, if not more. The man either had fifty-eight vertebrae, or an
extraordinarily high ass. I'm banking on the multitude of vertebrae,
and it is upon this oddity that I wish
to stake my claim
No man with the wherewithal to
philanthropically fund stonemasonry skimps on his portrait artist NO only the finest regional
painter was selected, and much
like portraitists through the ages
who subtly beautified their ugly
subjects in order to retain patronage, our particular artist painted
Newton Tarble and his unprecedented anomaly as tactfully as
torso on in North America

possible, actually downplaying
the tremendous lumbar region,
which brings me to my main
point: I contend that the Tarble
fortune was amassed through
years ofcarnival circuits and sideshows which produced an eventual freak empire presided over by
none other than Newton Tarble,
king ofall malformed, half madeup madmen, seated smirking in

the throne of his own exploitative and evil enterprise (and so
depicted in his court, our lounge).
Who else would give his children
such odd names? This man snaked
his sinuous spiny way to the top
by slithering shrewdly over a
writhing mound of midgets,
bearded ladies, snake handlers,
bogus swamis, lesser contortionists, astoundingly obese giants,
hapless twins connected by the
head at birth, pin-eaters, voice
throwers, and those who vomit
projectiles professionally. And the
countless grubby dollars that he
wrenched from the hands of inveterate

adolescent truants,

drunken louts and the like have
quite literally paved our way to the
dairy cooler, the bagel toaster, and
most importantly the cigarettesinged couches which surround
grease layered tables and empty
yogurt containers sending up putrid tendrils ofbrown smokefrom
the last twenty butts crammed into
the unmixed fruit additive.
So next time you ignite the
white and slender proboscis and
draw the concomitant chemical
cloud deep into your once-supple
lungs, endow with your effete
gaze for a moment the portrait of
Newton Tarble and consider: He
now presides over a new carnival
of human oddities.

Public apology
for article
To the editor:
I want to publicly apologize for
some of the things I said last week
in my article parodying the student
handbook. Looking back on it,
some of the things that I initially
thought were funny now seem offensive to me, as I know they did
to several other readers at the time.
First and foremost, I apologize
wholeheartedly for making fun of
North Philadelphia. It was not
right of me to poke fun at the
neighborhood, for obvious reasons. Many people live there and
struggle under those real-life conditions every day, and I highly
commend ETS for their involvement in the neighborhood. It was
wrong of me to joke in that way,
especially sitting on my perch
here at Swarthmore. I shouldhave
been more sensitive.
Along those lines, I want to
apologize for taking a shot at
SWIL. I know they don't seethe
at the mouth, and if they want to
wear Star Trek uniforms... hey, so
be it. To each his own.
Next, I'm sincerely sorry to my
roommate, Steve. He's a good guy,
and he's been a wonderful roommate for me. I would never throw
anything at him (or at anyone, for
that matter). Carry on, Steve.
The article was stupid and mean
more than it was funny. What I
intended as a humorous, good-natured piece came out as a malicious venting of my own frustrations, and I'm sorry to those I
alienated (except for Guiliani— I
still think he's in the Mafia).
While I don't apologize for writing the article, I think I should
have been more aware of exactly
what it was that I was saying.
Sometimes when a writer writes,
he or she does so very meticulously and becomes so engrossed
in getting the details right, that it
is hard for him or her to see the
big picture. That's what happened
to me... I lost sight of the big picture. Please forgive me.

Op-Ed

The glorification of victimization
It is Saturday Night. One hundred
and seventy students are gathered
in an all-campus space. . . maybe
Tarble, maybe Old Club... to dance
and drink and fuck and forget about
work for a while. A song comes on.
It is familiar. Several women jump
up and begin applauding, everyone
dances harder, faster. In unison, the
students chant, "I've got all my life
to live and I've got all my love to
give. I will survive. I will survive.
Hey, hey!" Some of the other lines
are glossed over as people slur their
memories with their pitches. This
unimportant. "Yabba, yabba, dee
bop hmm hmm hmm, I will survive.
I will survive. Hey! Hey!"
Why the emphasis on the chorus?
Is it merely the fact that it is played
at every, single Swarthmore party
and therefore ingrained in our subconsciousness or is it more than
this: a code, an anthem for Swatties
(and maybe all youth) to bind together? I'm not really sure. What I
do know is this: these words
(though caught up in a catchy tune)
are important. And words tend to
become meaningless when used too
often.
A discussion of the Holocaust
leads one to a difficult question:
who, exactly, is a survivor? Is it
someone who escaped or was liberated from a concentration camp?
Or someone who hid or fled from

Poland and Germany before the war
began? Perhaps it is broader than
this—maybe all Jews are survivors
because Hitler's plan ultimately
failed? And from this question stem
other questions—can you qualify the
term? Does the person who was
liberated from Auschwitz at the
end of the war have a greater right
to suffer than someone who lost
his entire family to Genocide,
even though he was living in
America? Is victimization a reason for pride and/or empowerment? These are not easy questions to answer.
When I came to Swarthmore
three years ago, I attended the
"Survivor's Collection." Though I
had not personally experienced a
situation I would consider to be
"rape" or "assault," someone close
to me had and, in her honor, I bore
witness. I sat among friends, acquaintances, class members and
professors. I did not feel a connection to these people. I felt isolated.
I was shocked and saddened by
the number of women present. I
felt my place there was alien and
disrespectful to these first-hand experiences. I did not return the following year. I have not returned
since.
Several ofmy friends approached
me sometime later with their per-

Mr, Harris, we

sonal reflections. One of my friends
told of incest, another of date-rape.
This summer I met a girl who confessed she had passed out and, when
she awoke, she found bloody markings all over her body and a note saying, "Sorry, had to run. We'll talk
soon." But she had no idea who the
guy was or what had happened.
These stories became so normal I
stopped batting an eyelash when the
confidences began.
One night last year, I was sitting
around with a male friend of mine
and, during a mindless and carefree
conversation, I told him how a few
friends ofmine in high school had
suggested we have an orgy. "It was
a mindless game, I told him.
"Does this turn you on?" No, well
maybe this does..." I told him how
one of these guys grabbed my
hands behind my back and another
started kissing me, that the third
started whispering in my ear, "Once
you've had me, you won't want
anyone else," I said. I laughed at
the memory. "As if I really would
have relented," I said. "Even when
they suggested that we go upstairs,
I knew it was a joke. God, some
boys are so stupid." My friend
stared at me, all traces of humor
vanished and gone. In a rage he
grabbed a shoe and threw it at the
door. "Jesus Christ, you could have
been assaulted!" he screamed.

"

anything." He kept going. "Please,
stop," I whispered, arching my back
to carry him deeper. He didn't. Finally I convinced him to let me get
something and we proceeded to finish the deed. I had a thousand different emotions and all of them
were removed from the scene. I
watched it overhead like a moth
hovering over a light.
When I told my friends about the
experience sometime later, a few of
them said, "Oh my God, he raped
you!" But he didn't. Or maybe he
did. I said no. I told him to stop. I
clung to him and wanted him.
I'm sure my story is not an unusual
one. I'm sure that depending on who
you talk, it is a classic date-rape scenario or simply a bad circumstance
without any titles. Or maybe it just
had to happen. But I do not consider
myself to be a "survivor."And I have
to admit, I resent those who tell me I
should be.
If I am a survivor, then every sexual
woman I know is... every woman has
herself in a situation where "right and
wrong" either didn't exist or blurred
their meaning.
I imagine many people share the
conception ofrape as a violating act
in which two parties play two very
specific roles: one, the victim—is
attacked, while the other—the persecutor —ignores her wishes and
brutally forces himself against his

But what I want to do is examine the
implications that the Harris company policies could have on an industry-wide level.
I want to go back to the title of the talk:
"Why what's good for corporations is good
for America." Mr. Harris demonstrates how
his chemical firm is good for his employees, but fails to extend this logic to the industry, to the nation.
The issue ofhis firm's policy toward environmental protection is perhaps the most
interesting, especially because the chemical industry is notorious for being environmentally detrimental. Also, examining the
policies toward environmental protection
allow me to show where the ethical and
moral standards of the company toward its
employees begin to be dominated by the
survival instincts of the "black box" firm
in real-world competition.
Here's an example. Congress was about
to pass a bill that would place particulate
emissions standards on a Harris plant. According to Mr. Harris, these standards were
unfeasible. So he flew to D.C., ate breakfast with Diane Feinstein, wrote out a
check, and went home knowing that his
company would no longer have to worry
about such standards, that his employees
would be safe in their jobs.
Mr. Harris correctly points out that this
is the way business is done. But insinuate
though he may about the underhandedness
of this practice, he seemed in no hurry for
reform. So how can I reconcile the ethical
standards of Mr. Harris the employer with
the questionable ethics of Mr. Harris the
lobbyist? To answer these questions I go
straight to the policies of his company.
A Harris Chemical Group booklet of
goals called "Vision 2000" expounds the
values of honesty, openness, respect, and
trust. It describes ways to work together,
get jobs done, communicate, and be a
leader. The booklet states that a company
must lead "by example, by being pro-active, with minimal politics, with a common
purpose, by being results driven, by cel-

ebrating success." This is just one example
of the positive environment that the Harris
Chemical Group tries to maintain.
But I want to take these policies to their
furthest extension-an industry-wide level.
What if Harris Chemical Group became a
truly environmentally-friendly company,
even at the price of higher costs. They could
be pro-active by taking steps to reduce
emission, practice low-impact mining, etc.
They could minimize politics by reducing
the need for costly environmental standards, and decreasing the incentives for a
trip to Washington, D.C. The common purpose would of course be a cleaner chemical industry driven to attaining the results
of cleaner air and water. And success most
certainly could be celebrated as consumers got a more positive view of the industry, and firms were more aware of the possibilities for improvement.
Economics suggests this is impossible.
Of course, if chemical companies get good
publicity from this, others would have every incentive to follow. But where lies the
incentive to be that leader?And what about
the incentive to be the one company that
doesn't follow these standards and ends up
with a greater profit margin due to reduced
costs? There doesn't seem to be room for
non-economic incentives in an economic
world. So it is just "aye, there's the rub"
and let's go back to corruption?
Maybe not. He mentioned that there exists today significant peer pressure from
other companies to follow environmental
standards. If this is true, then maybe an argument for peer pressure could be a special sort of economic argument-a different type of incentive. Industries could celebrate a firm's success just as Harris
Chemical Group celebrates an employee's
sucess.
Perhaps it is ridiculous to suggest that industries can solve social problems without
the government. From a macroeconomic
point of view, it makes sense-it would be
a cheaper process than government regulations that require waste in legal and
fees.
From
a
implementation

microeconomic point of view, however, it
is hard to see where the incentives would
lie. The only hope is for an industry group
to agree on environmental standards. That
way each firm would face the same costs,
and none would be hurt competitively. But
not only would such a conglomeration of
firms be subject to anti-trust laws, the incentive to cheat is there.
By no means do I want this article to discredit the accomplishments Mr. Harris has
achieved. But he didn't need to become defensive about his actions in politics, the environmental practices of his company. What
he needed to do was to take a step back,
critically evaluate the differencebetween his
company policies and his market policies,
and think about possible solutions. Only if

By Wendy Lawrence
Maybe nobody told him this was a liberal campus. Maybe he got lost on his way
to the University of Chicago. Or perhaps
George Harris really wanted to talk to a
crowd of liberal-loving, corporation-hating
Swatties.
Regardless of the reason, I recently had
the opportunity to listen to George Harris,
founder of Harris Chemical Group, speak
about the connection between ethics and
profits in business practices. I left the lecture with an incredible amount of respect
for Harris. The man created a multi-million dollar international firm in one decade.
Something like that demands respect.
But Mr. Harris didn't travel all the way
to a liberal-infested campus to be respected.
He did, however, come to talk about the
way in which his financial success depended on high ethical standards that benefitted his employees and their communities.
His presentation smacked of nineties
lingo. His firm expounds a set of values
that an old-school capitalist might find a
bit warm and fuzzy. But when warm and
fuzzy pay, it's a whole new ballgame for
the American capitalist. Mr. Harris has a
very sound thought: most people want to
be productive-it is the job of the employer
to provide the venue and the atmosphere
to do that.
The atmosphere is there. A toll free number allows employees to ask questions and
bring up anonymous complaints. An incentive program rewards model employees,
and the company even goes so far as to provide tutors for those who are less able to
write so that they can produce satisfactory
peer recommendations. Family days,
strong health care benefits, and honest upfront policies about hiring and lay-off strategies show the employees that the company
is working for them.And as the extraordinary success of Mr. Harris clearly demonstrates, companies that care are rewarded
in terms of productivity, profit, and growth.
It pays to be altruistic.

"Was that it? Did anything else happen?"Shocked as I was I stammered,
"N0... not really... I mean..." He
flew out of the room. "You're so stupid. You're so stupid. You're so
dumb. Don't you understand?" He
flew out of the room. "You're so stupid. You're so dumb.Don't you understand?"
And no, I didn't understand. And,
no, I didn't think I was stupid.
Several months ago I found myself in another "encounter." There
was this guy I liked. That's an understatement. . this guy I worshipped. .. and I made my feelings
known and we did our thing for several weeks. One night he stopped
by at four o'clock in the morning
and told me he wanted to make love
to me. I could tell he was drunk and
I had sworn to myself I would never
have sex with him unless he cared
about me as I cared for him. But,
somehow, when he said the words,
I wanted to. We started fooling
around a bit. He was aggressive,
pulling off my clothes, spreading
my legs. I told him we had to stop,
that it was a bad idea. He started
asking me questions, questions I
couldn't answer. "I don't know
why, I just don't want to," I said,
too embarrassed to confess it was
because I liked him too much. He
started to stick it in. (It felt good).

my getting absolutely no play whatsoever from Your Mom (who, according to many men I've spoken
to, puts out). And how about off
campus? Unless you have a car
(which I didn't the last two years),
the options are just as constraining.
Which to woo Your Mom with: the
sleazy ambience of Renato's, or the
Seinfeldishly awful service offered
at the new Chinese restaurant? Really, I can't decide.
[Pause to clean off the sarcasm
that has mysteriously dripped onto
the keyboard]
But where to go is not the only
problem. Certain of Swarthmore's
institutions also make pursuing a
significant other difficult. Take the
Health Center: If I was a woman, I
would never, ever, have sex at Swat,
for fear of zealous Health Center
employees attempting to give me a

Pap smear to check for pregnancy
whenever I come in with a headache. Further, the condoms are way
too out in the open. You're either
too embarrassed to take one knowing the entire staff and every sick
Swattie is watching you, or you're
afraid that when they do see you
take one, they'll beat you up for
having sex when they're not. Another debilitating factor is
Swarthmore traditions. The Quaker
Matchbox, for one, would put way
too much pressure on Your Mom
and me if we did hook up* as if we
were exchanging vows along with
saliva. Also, the commonly-held
belief that all physical interactions
lead either to marriage or just a lurid one-night stand might dissuade
Your Mom and I from even bothering.
Before I give my policy recommendations for increasing the per

market leaders like Mr. Harris admit the
flaws of the system will the system ever
change. Arguing that things happen because they happen gets us nowhere.
Perhaps I'm being too idealistic. But Mr.
Harris himself said that companies were
trying to be better environmentally, that the
peer pressure existed. All I am saying is
that if he's telling the truth, maybe Americans can benefit from big companies.
Maybe big companies can make the hard
choices politicians are forced to make now.
Maybe somewhere there's a way of putting these choices into economic terms, of
building a society where peer pressure enforces standards more efficiently than any
government bureaucracy ever could.
I guess what I'm saying, Mr. Harris, is
that we need your help.

It doesn't fix the underlying problem.
So here's how to fix the disturbing lack of booty on campus. First

the safer sex workshop should become MUCH more hands on, and
they should never, ever, ever, ever,

Sociology/Anthropology Department should create a new PDC,
"Dating Techniques," with extensive labs and very helpful WA's.
Admissions affirmative action programs should take attractiveness
into account when putting incoming classes together. All coffee

Housing committee revision challenged
By

Min Lee

Two sophomore students urged Housing
Committee for swifter application of the
new numberinsurance policy at a committee meeting this Monday. The committee
decided earlier that the policy would be
applied for the first time to the class of
2001.
Josh Kramer 'OO and GeoffAnisman 'OO
suggested that the new policy take effect

right away with their class along with the
current freshman class.
Under the latest revision, the number insurance mechanism now guarantees that
students who had chosen the last third of
assigned rooms as rising sophomores—as
opposed to those who received numbers
in the bottom third of their class —plus
those who landed on the waiting list will
receive a lottery number in the top third of
the class.

The change addresses past concerns that
the policy gives an unfair edge to students
who took advantage of the loopholes of
the system. For example, students with
numbers in lowest third of their class may
have paired up with someone with a higher
number and still receive the benefits of the
old number insurance system.
However, as the Housing Committee
press release pointed out, Kramer and
Anisman are coming from a somewhat bi-

ased point of view. Both had chosen rooms
in the bottom third, although their numbers were above the lowest third of the
class, whereas other students in their class
with worse numbers than theirsreceived a
"double insurance"—they received good
rooms by pairing up with students with
high numbers and were also guaranteed
numbers in the top two-thirds by virtue of
the old policy, which, as of now, still applies to the class of 2000.

The committee heard the suggestion of
the two members and agreed to consider
it next semester as well as soliciting student input on the entire package. It will
also be reviewing the part of the new policy
which guarantees number insurance to students on the waiting list the previous year.
At the meeting, it was also decided that
the Roberts High Security Storage will be
open for an hour on three days towards the
end of the semester.

New projectors spell relief
for DuPont movie-goers
By

James Wing

Saturday 10 p.m. You know the
experience all too well: you're
sitting in the DuPont movie after
a long stressful week, hoping to
lose touch with reality for a moment before suffering through
what promises to be an even more
stressful weekend. The house lights
come on. It's time to change thereels.
The mood is shattered.
Relief is in sight. Brought to
the table by head projectionist
Rafi Dowty '9B, Budget committee voted unanimously on Sunday
to replace the decrepit projectors

in DuPont with new machines
that promise to restore continuity to one of campus' most regularly attended events. "The projectors in DuPont have been at the
end of their usuable life for a couple
of years," according to committee
member Josh Alloy '9B.
In an interesting move, Budget
Committee decided to bring this
matter to the attention of students
thought an all campus e-mail.
The two main reasons behind the
decision to gauge popular opinion are the high cost involved and
the awkward mid-semester timing of the proposal, said BC

member Ryan Peterson 'OO.
However, Peterson clearly emphasized that although students
did not actually vote directly on
the matter and that BC remained
in full control of the decision, the
email still served an informative
purpose. "There's nothing wrong
with letting students know what's
going on before we decide," he
said.
BC members were impressed at
the volume of responses. 307 students voiced their opinion electronically on this matter. Over
half voted in favor of the purchase.

Berkeley profs' firm
provokes criticism
Anil Podduturi
The Daily Californian
By

At least one UC
(U-WIRE)
Berkeley professor has criticized
five colleagues whose private
Emeryville economics consulting
firm has them poised to become
millionaires.
The firm
known as the Law
and Economics Consulting Group
has become a controversial subject in recent weeks for founders
Richard Gilbert, Gordon Rausser
and David Teece, who are all economics professors, and law professor Thomas Jorde.Acclaimed Berkeley economics professor and
former White House adviser Laura
Tyson joined LECG last spring.
Paul Gersper, an environmental
science policy and management
professor, said he questioned the
university's policies on the commercial interests of faculty members. In particular, Gersper criticized Rausser, the current dean of
the College of Natural Resources.
Gersper said Rausser and his collaborators are spending too much
time on their venture and not
enough time working for the university.
"The only thing I'm saying is that
the College ofNatural Resources is
suffering," Gersper said. "I'm not

making a personal attack on Dean
Rausser. From my perspective, this
dean is not doing the job that previous deans have done. I don't think
he's spending enough time."
Gersper cited increased layoffs
under Rausser's leadership, a rollback of departmental support staff
and cutbacks of simple luxuries such
as typing services. Gersper said he
was forced to charge students $lO
each for typing services in an ESPM
course he instructed last fall.
But Rausser defended himself,
saying that Gersper's criticism was
a personal attack. According to
Rausser, Gersper is one of just three
professors with whom he has met in
the past to discuss performance
shortcomings. Furthermore, Gersper
and Rausser both said they have disagreed in the past.
Rausser asserts that the cutbacks
cited by Gersper are a result of governmental budget constraints and coincide with widespread reductions
which have plagued the entire university in recent years.
This criticism comes on the heels
of the consulting firm's recent announcement of an initial public stock
offering worth $6O million. The
move could enrich the budding business to the tune of $l6O million.

closely at the rules and regulations

tivities for faculty members)," said
Gersper, adding that he has never
accepted compensation for outside
ventures during his 30 years as an
associate professor at Berkeley.
'There are two questions we need
to answer," he said. "First of all, is
anyone doing anything they
shouldn't be? And are the existing
rules strict enough so that professors
who are being paid relatively good
salaries are providing a good day's
work?"
Despite the criticism, LECG does
not appear to break any UC policies.
The professors in question have all
said that they work for the firm just
one working day per week, perfectly
acceptable under university regulations.
In fact, the official policy for "outside professional activity for faculty
members" actually encourages such
work as beneficial to the entire university community.
Gersper said he thinks the policy
should be reevaluated to consider
paid compensation because of potential conflict ofinterest issues.
According to Vice Chancellorand
Provost Carol Christ, however, the
university regulates only the number
of hours spent in outside ventures
and does not regulate the amount of
money earned by faculty members.
'There are many ways ofconducting outside activities that do not require compensation," Gersper said.
'There are numerous funding agencies, commissions and professional
organizations which faculty members are associated with.
"I've done lots of outside activities," added Gersper. "But I've never
accepted any money for them. I've
always considered it part ofmy job
as a public servant."
Rausser said he has also participated in countless activities without
compensation and thatLECG's success was one exception that surprised
everyone involved.

Poverty Awareness Week began
3 years ago, created by ETS and
other campus organizations that
were concerned about poverty
and wanted to raise awareness of
poverty issues within the
Swarthmore community.
Organizers also hoped to correct the misconception that the
solution to poverty is necessarily
an elitist one. "In this society,
and in Swarthmore as well, we're
taught to not see poor people as
the experts on the poverty, but
rather to think that we must come
up with solutions for poverty, not
that the poor should," said Jennifer Cox '9B and David Reese '99,
the student organizers in charge
of the event, "because of this,

we're not challenged to think that
poverty must end, or to believe
that we should support the organization of poor people to fight
poverty. Their focus this week,
according to Cox and Reese, was
to educate the community on the
growing movement to end poverty being led by the poor and
show the community the how
they can be involved in the movement as well. So far, they have
received positive feedback in all
of the events. Anyone who would

SC overrules BC mandate

did not understand the seriousness
of leaving the door unlocked or the
responsibility ofhis position.
After nearly two hours of discussion, BC rescinded its earlierdecision to suspend both editors, and
instead decided to prohibit only
Balgobin from entering the office
from 9 a.m. on Tuesday, November 18 until 9 a.m. on Monday,
November 24. The Committeepresented the rationale behind its decision, stating "BC has a vested interest in protecting the equipment
that is in the publications office."
While acknowledging
that
Balgobin and Mohan might have
valid arguments against the suspension, BC ultimately agreed that
Schulhofer-Wohl had given the editors several chances to discuss their
concerns earlier, and they hadfailed
to do so. Nevertheless, they requested that Schulhofer-Wohl review the current publication office
rules "paying special attention to the
concerns that Mr. Balgobin and Mr.
Mohan have raised." BC voted
against a further motion that would
have taken away Balgobin's key
privileges for the remainder of the
semester.

Before BC reached its final decision, Mohan emphasized that the
editors' appeal did not represent an
attempt to save themselves. Rather,
they hoped BC would allow them
to continue working on the paper
so that it could be published thefollowing week. The editors-in-chief
are volunteering their time to ere-

ate a paper that "benefits the entire

college community," explained
Mohan. Since Balgobin and Mohan
each spend about forty hours a
week on The Phoenix, after the
meeting Publisher Dan Fanaras '99
asserted that "the paper will not
come out as [BC's] penalty currently stands."
Balgobin and Mohan appealed
the decision to SC later that evening
because they believed that "the
punishment did not fit the crime."
Furthermore, the editors asserted
that Schulhofer-Wohl—rather than
BC —should have decided how to
address the issue.
Although Council Co-Chair Ari
Plost '9B felt that BC did not have
the right to suspend a student from
public space, Jones maintained that
the Committee was not exceeding
its power, but simply upholding a
rule designed to protect College
property. Given the infraction that
occurred, Plost believed that suspending Balgobin from the office
constituted an inappropriate punishment; instead, he proposed removing Balgobin's name from the
key list, thereby allowing him to
enter the publications office but forbidding him to possess a key of his
own. Plost's measure failed in the
end. SC subsequently voted 9-1 to
overturn BC's decision, with the
understanding that Mohan and
Balgobin had already been sufficiently punished by losing theirpermanent keys for one week. The ruling also stated that if the editors or
the publisher of The Phoenix were
to leave the publications door un-

locked again, then their permanent
keys would be taken away until the
end of the semester. Council retained one component of BC's recommendation with a provision mandating that Schulhofer-Wohl make
the office rules "more specific."
Elections Chair Laura Barandes
'99 cited the "vagueness" of the
publications office rules as a justification for the Council's decision,
while Council member Naomi
Michlin '9B said that "extenuating
circumstances" were involved and
that "the issue has gone on long
enough."
Plost, the only member ofSC who
voted against the measure, said that
he did not feel comfortable with the
Council's disregard for BC's earlier
recommendation. "The essence of
BC's decision should be taken into
consideration," he asserted.
Jones stated his views more
strongly, saying that although he
respected the members of SC as
individuals he "had lost faith in SC
as a whole." According to Jones, the
Council did not present an adequate
rationale for its ruling, and the vote
revealed that SC does not trust the
people it appoints to make decisions.
The editors themselves felt ambivalent towards SC's actions. "I'm
still dissatisfied with the fact that
SC did not prohibit BC from making the decision that they did," explained Mohan. However, "I'm basically happy with the'outcome of
the appeal and relieved that The
Phoenix will be coming out again
this week."

Newlywed indie
band to rock
Olde Club
by Jason Rothenberg
This Saturday the Olde Club brings out its big guns
with the return of the newly-wed New York City band
Guv'ner. A "return" because they played the Olde Club
in the fall of 1994, shortly after the release of their first
album on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace label. Unlike some of the bands that fell by the wayside, split-up,
or got married and moved away, Guv'ner, I am happy to
say, is alive and well three years later, and three years
stronger! After a handful of 7" records and the recent
release of their second full-length album "The Hunt,"
this time on Merge records (Superchunk's label), Pumpkin Wentzel and Charles Gansa, the dynamic duo behind
Guv'ner, have perfected the art of quirky and complex
pop. They even have a classically-trained drummer!
Guv'ner reviews inevitably compare Charles to Steven
Malkmus of Pavement or an off-key Jonathon Richmond,
and Pumpkin to Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth) or "Kim Deal
if she was in Pavement." But beyond the fact that Pumpkin is a female bass player, I don't think those comparisons go very far. Guv'ner has its own sound. Their latest album is somewhat cleaner sounding than their
punkier debut, but the catchy hooks and creative timing
haven't missed a beat. Pumpkin and Charles trade and
duel vocals like nobody's business. For some time there
was much speculation about the nature of theirrelationship on account of their extraordinary chemistry. Thanks
to a wedding, the debate is over, and their dynamo stage
presence continues to amaze (in holy matrimony no less!).
This Saturday night, fellow Merge artists the Ladybug Transistor will open for Guv'ner wih their own
brand of lushly orchestrated pop. It will be a rock and
roll blow-out to remember. Celebrate with the new
newly weds (this is perhaps their first show since tying
the knot)! Bring your tri-co id and your pop appetite:

Orchestra will put on its an*■"
/nual Fall Concert, a much anticipated
event that brings together a
semester's worth of practice by about 70 student
and faculty musicians. Under the auspices of their
new director, Sarah loannides, the orchestra looks
forward to an exciting night of Romantic and Twentieth Century music, with a program of well-known
and unfamiliar pieces alike. If a recent preview of
the orchestra's repertoire is any indication, theperformance promises to be an impressive and enjoyable one,
The orchestra's accomplished sound comes in no

She currently studies at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, commuting to campus one night
a week for rehearsal. loannides, who replaced Ame
Runnings as director, thoroughly enjoys the joband
hopes to continue next year, while living in New
York and attending Juliard on a scholarship.
"We have a highly concentrated, intense group
ofmusicians, and I am looking very much forward
to making real music," she says of the upcoming
concert. "It's very good for a school to have such a
good number of students making music, and there
is an awful lot of talent here."
The students comprise a full-fledged orchestra
and practice every Monday from
PM in
Lang Concert Hall. They come from all four
classes, though there are quite a few freshmen, and
they enter the orchestra as advanced players.
Eva Allen 'OO, Co-Manager of the orchestra, and
a veteran harp and violin player, feels excited about
the performance. "The concert will be brilliant because of our new director," she says enthusiastically. She adds that, "Swarthmore is lucky it has
an Orchestra of this size."
Kathryri Tong 'Ol, a viola player, shares the sentiment. "Sarah has been able to focus the orchestra
to perform at its best. The repertoire that she has
chosen is an eclectic mix of exciting pieces, and I
am looking forward to the concert."

Philadelphia's quirky set was in fine form last Thursday evening, braving cold and rain to hear the folk and
fusion of Canadian pop icon Moxy Friivous. The concert packed South Street's T.L.A. with what band member and unofficial emcee Jian Ghomeshi called "a
healthy cross-section of hippies and geeks."
It was a big show for the band, because a recording of
it will be released as a new live album, and they turned
their verbal and musical antics up a notch for the occasion. The crowd was treated to up-to-the-minute media
references, locally tailored riffs like "Cream Cheese of
Philadelphia" (after Springsteen), and zany interstitial
material, including an informal referendum on Quebec
nationalism.
Moxy Friivous was formed six years ago by four kids
who grew up together in Toronto. It's a funny-sounding name for a funny-sounding band, one that is serious
about being silly. Their songs are often ironic reflections on popular culture, like "Video Bargainville," full
ofallusions to the media, politics, other musicians, and
commercial culture. One track, "Kick in the Ass," is
nothing but a laundry list of topical and trivial complaints.
The band's current tour, dubbed "Your New Boyfriend," includes tunes from "You Will Go to the Moon,"
the album they released last spring. The tour's name is
derived from one of their more laconic refrains: "Your
new boyfriend's a bit/Of a right-wing shit." The show
featured other music from that album, including "Get
in the Car," "No No Raja," and the title song, as well as
many songs from their perennially popular first album,
"Bargainville."
Thursday night's show included an especially energetic rendition of perhaps the new album's best-loved

The Triumphant Return
You've heard of it before. From names like "Daft

Punk" to "The Prodigy," electronic music has arrived
on the mainstream, and I, at least, have attempted to
catch the quickly speeding "techno" train. From popular movie soundtracks (Hackers, Trainspotting, The
Saint, Spawn) to top 10 hits (Da Funk, Firestarter, Setting Sun, Block Rockin' Beats) electronic music has entered popular culture. So, over the past two weeks I've
gone to not one, but rather two, electronic music con-

certs.

One might ask "what, exactly, would one do at a concert? Do you get to see the artists playing with their
computers or something?" Absolutely not. At the first
concert I went to, The Crystal Method (yes, it's a drug
reference) at the Trocadero, there was no such thing.
From the first line of Trip Like I Do ("Another world.
Another time" from The Dark Crystal, the grotesque
muppet movie from the 80's) to the final note of Busy

Child (a rising siren like noise) Ken Jordan and Scott
Kirkland had a roomful of around 2000 people moving.
The set was extremely short; TCM is new to the scene,
having only one full length LP published. They did, however, play almost the entire thing. My personal favorite?

She's My Pusher, which embodies the dramatic shifts
that TCM puts into their songs—though it's a little harder
to dance to than the rest, it's still got a good beat, and

Dito
Reigersberg, run-

ning Thursday to
Saturday nights i n
Manayunk from
November 13th to the 22nd. This one-man
piece, performed by van Reigersberg, uses
incredible energy and creativity to communicate the fascinating journey of the
homosexual Spanish poet, Frederico
Garcia Lorca, into the whirlwind of New
York City.
The minute the doors of the theater open,
it is obvious that this is not "traditional"
theater. Jeffrey Sugg, the designer for Pig
Iron's "Cafeteria," did the design for this
production as well, which is evidenced by
the unique combination of creativity and
functionality. While the set provides a
feast for the eyes, there is no excess, nothing that is superfluous or that distracts
from the astounding performance. The
performance begins with van Reigersberg,
alone and barefoot, carrying a bucket of
water and a rag, with which he washes the
different representations of doors on the
stage.

Through these doors, the audience is let
into the poet's world. Suddenly, the character who reveals himself to be Lorca is
no longer "alone," nor is he for most of
the performance. Instead, van Reigersberg

Murray acts and
re-acts, though, that even in the midst of
a bad movie, he still comes off looking
pretty good.
In The Man Who Knew Too Little,
Murray plays Wallace Fletcher, a geeky
video store clerk from Des Moines who
arrives in London to surpise his brother.
Unfortunately, his brother has houseguests
and attempts to get rid of Wallace for the
evening by dumping him in an interactive
theater performance that supposedly simulates real life. Of course, Wallace gets
mixed up with some real-life spies, but just
thinks he's play-acting.
This plot is fundamentally somewhat
clever, and I kept wishing it would actually go somewhere; instead, the movie
goes straight for obvious slapstick and
dumb caper jokes. There are long
stretches where the movie almost works,
mostly thanks to Murray, but the convoluted script and plot continually get in the
way.

Electronica proves to be music of the future
from ELECTRONICA,AS

nothing beats the two slower interludes of
the song.
I was impressed, however, by the performance. It was almost an Abbot and Costello
scene, with Scott seeming to drunkenly
totter and slam the keys of his keyboard
like a Swattie after a DU party, with Ken
quietly and intently tapping at various keys
and adjusting sampling and beats on the
drum machine. At various times Scott, and
his keyboard with him, would go flying to
the floor, sending the Yoda doll attached to
the keyboard into the crowd only to be returned moments later. From performance
to music, the only disappointment was that
Apollofourfourty apparently had some ill-

ness problems and was forced to skip the
gig. Hey-both members ofTCM were out
on bail for making designer drugs at the
time of the concert—why did a little pneumonia stop A440?
I'd have to say that the next concert I went
to was significantly more impressive than
TCM, however. Now, I know that everyone
has probably heard ofThe ChemicalBrothers. and some of you probably own Dig
Your Own Hole. It's good, but the band is
even better live. In addition to an impressive on-stage presence, they also had an
amazing sound and light system, and, of
course, the tunes and beats that made them
famous (and rich).
I jump ahead of myself, however. Before
the Brothers even came on stage, Death in

Vegas opened. A member of a newer cadre
of cross-genre groups, DiV sports more
than keyboardists—they've also got two
entire guitarists. The sound on their CD,
Dead Elvis, is a combination of a little
grunge rock, some serious dub, some amazing vocal samples and some littlekid cursing people off, and, of course, the übiquitous drum machine and synths. In concert,
the dub—to my dismay—was much less
prevalent, and the dance themes were
strengthened. I didn't really appreciate the
changes, but they were still very impressive.
The major concert of the night, however,
rocked. The Brothers started their set with
Leave Home, off of their lesser known LP,
Exit Planet Dust. From the spoken "The
Brothers Gonna Work it Out" to the final

snare beats, the entire audience was moving, but not yet dancing. When they played
Three Little Birdies Down Beats, with its
trademark low reverbs, however, everyone
was up.
Unlike the other two groups, the Brothers didn't attempt to run a concert as much
as a dance. The transition from song to song
was invisible, and the audience was kept
in constant motion. After one hour, they
took a very short break, and came back on
with even better effects and bigger lighting, culminating in a huge performance of
Setting Sun that made the song bearable
(they also took out Noel Gallagher, which
added greatly). All in all, a wonderful ex-

better, however, was the addition of some
local DJ's spinning their best before the
start—both performances began with about
3 hours of pure dance tracks, mixed by
some of the best I've ever heard—no offense to Martin Carrillo intended.
Now, admittedly, it's not easy to catch
SEPTA's R3 line, at, say, 8 pm. Getting it
from center city at 2 in the morning is
slightly harder, which is why I've got to
thank Jeffery the cab driver (well, the $35
was thanks enough), and Gene Turk 'Ol
for making all of this enjoyment possible.

song, "Michigan Militia," which features merry lyrics about stockpiling AK-47 's, played above a background of mumbled, paranoid rantings. The live
version, featuring a toy megaphone, has evolved
since I heard its Michigan premiere last spring. The
song also excelled with such lyrical ballads as "The
Drinking Song" and "Fell in Love."
I should mention that Moxy and me go way back,
ever since a popular teacher at my high school became a "Fruhead" and began proselytizing to her
students. She inspired a classmate of mine to form
a Moxy Fruvous fan club. Last year one of my
friends regaled my A-period calculus class each morning with proclamations of her lust for band member
Murray Foster, as well as last night's newsgroup postings.
The band's shows are also remarkable for stepping beyond the ordinary vocabulary of rock, mentioning "pabulum" and "Pinochet" in successive

Murray

lyrics, and rhyming "plebiscite" with "troglodyte."
They're at home making traditional electric and
acoustic sounds, but they also like to mess around
with banjos, congas, and accordions. When they
want emotional impact, as in the rarely-performed
"Gulf War Song," they sing a cappella.
Friivous seems to be relying heavily on their early
compositions to please the crowds. Still, they have
a great time, and so does their audience. Their spirit
is summed up by the encore number "Sam I Am," a rap
version ofthe Dr. Seuss book "Green Eggs and Ham," a
story about the dissolutionof cynicism and fear. In a sense,
I think Moxy Friivous is a perfect antidote to the inchoate
angst that typifies contemporary music.
Their fans are cerebral and energetic, and these
guys cater to their taste. As their manager told me,
the band didn't want to constrain anyone's choices,
so they produced two versions of the tour t-shirt:
you can buy either "Your New Boyfriend" or "Your
New Girlfriend."

comedy
from MAN,AS
Hunter serial killer movie Copycat and the
Richard Gere-Jodie Foster Civil War romance Sommersby. He certainly has a varied filmography, but I don't think he was
the right choice to helm a spy caper comedy. The technical part of the movie is
handled well, but no scene ever really takes
on a comedic life of its own. The result of
this is thatevery scene is not funny enough
to make the audience suspend belief, and
not dramatic enough to be interesting. In
short, the movie is pretty dull.
Technically, The Man Who Knew Too
Little is above par for a caper comedy
movie. I especially liked the bright, fluid
photography by Robert Stevens, who also
shot the Naked Gun movies. Christopher
Young's jazzy, Pink Panther-influenced
music adds a lot to the feel of the picture.
I know that Bill Murray still has it in him
to make great comedies, though, as evidenced by Groundhog Day and the wonderful, underrated Quick Change, which he
also co-directed. It's too bad he didn't
shine in The Man Who Knew Too Little.
All I can say is, as far as spy comedies in
1997 go,Austin Powers: International Man
Of Mystery wins by a landslide.

two faculty members and one professor

emeritus—is impressive in and of itself,
given Swarthmore's size, the college does
bring in students from the Curtis Institute
of Music towards the end of semester. The
Curtis students, who number about four or
five, according to Kim Lombardo '9B, CoManager, will fill in for what's currently
lacking—mainly basses—and won't practice with the orchestra until their first dress
rehearsal on December 1 st.
"Nothing is drastically lacking, but the

orchestra could always use more players," says
Allan. Loanides agrees, adding that, "It's a difficult audition, and we can't take everyone—but we're happy to hear people."
The concert, scheduled to start at 7:30
PM in Lang Concert Hall, will comprise
four pieces: Night on a Bare Mountain, by
Modest Mussorgsky; Swan ofTuonela, by
Jean Sibelius (which includes an English
Horn solo by Mick Hunter '00); Suite Number Two, by Igor Stravinksy; andSymphony
Number Seven, by Antonin Dvorak. There
will be a reception in Lang Music Building following the concert.

Disappointing season ends on a low note
President Bloom expresses concern at state of Swat football,
promises help for the future after 20 straight losses
By

Pat Donaghy

The Garnet Tide ended their
season Saturday with a 41-13
defeat at the hands of Washing& Lee Saturday. The Tide
kept the game close early, but
the passing game of the Generals proved too much for
Swarthmore.
After spotting the Generals a
10-0 first quarter lead,
ton

Swarthmore put together a drive
of their own. Two plays after a
35 yard reception by Mason
Tootell '99, Joe Aleffi 'OO took
a screen pass from Ford
O'Connell 'OO and ran it in from
11 yards out for the Tide's first
score in three games. Aleffi
proved to be a consistent runner in his first year as a starter,
leading the team in touchdowns
(3) and rushing yards (410),
while placing second on the

team in receptions (26).

The defense came together in
the second half, holding the
Generals to just one touchdown
in each quarter, but the offense
continued to struggle. Down
41-7 late in the fourth quarter,
the Tide fought hard until the
final whistle. The 30 or so players left on the squad showed
their true colors by playing the
best football that they could no
matter what the odds against
them, no matter what the circumstances.

Symbolic of their will to fight
to the end, Tony Hillery 'Ol
forced a fumble with two minutes left in the game. On the

next play, quarterback Scott
Murray 'Ol connected with
Hillery for a 25 yard touchdown. Hillery finished the
game with 7 tackles, forced and
recovered a fumble, intercepted
a pass, broke up two others, and
scored a touchdown for a spot

on the conference honor roll.
Tucker Zengerle 'OO (19
tackles) once again played an
outstanding game and finished
the season with 138 tackles
and 7 tackles for a loss.
Though Zengerle led the conference by 32 tackles despite
missing a game, he did not receive votes for the All-Confer-

ence team. Tootell did make

as he finished third in the
league in receiving and total
yards. Bernard Nossuli '9B led
the team with 7.5 sacks and 11
tackles for loss.
After 20 straight losses the
team was promised help from
president Al Bloom, who at-

tended the Tide's end of season
meeting to gain insight into
problems with the team, as well
as athletics at Swarthmore in
general. Better times loom
ahead for the football team, who
lose just five seniors, while returning 19 starters.

didn'tflinch as they stared
down the barrel of the
toughest race of the season
thus far: the NCAA MidEast Regional Championships.
Forty-four teams and
270 runners crowded together on the blustery field
to compete in the nation's
largest Division 111 regional meet. After an annoyingly long starting line speech by Dickinson's head
coach, the runners launched into action. "I thought my
legs were going to freeze off," remarked Joko Agunloye
'Ol. "I couldn't feel anything," said Danielle Wall '9B,
who proved to be the hero of the day.
Wall became the second woman in Swarthmore's cross
country history to qualify for the NCAA National Championships, with a 15th place overall finish and a time of
19:45. The women's team finished 9th overall, with

Agunloye finishing 17th at a time of 19:50, Alissa
Parmalee 'Ol in 44th at 20:30, Karen Lloyd 'OO in 68th
at 20:57, Sarah McClure 'OO in 101st at 21:42, Sarah
Howard '9B in 153rd at 22:29, and Jessica George 'OO in
175th at 22:56. Wall made the all-conference Ist team,
Agunloye made the freshman all-conference Ist team,
and Parmalee made the freshman allconference 2nd team.

Last weekend, the Swarthmore
women's rugby team played their
last game under equally horrible
conditions as the past four games
of the season. Only this time it was
colder. The A-side squad was the
only team that played since Bryn
Mawr/Haverford could not
scrummage up 30 decent players
out of the 3000 they can choose
from. In fact, they had trouble
coming up with 15 for the A-side
game, which was evident from the
score: 26-0.
This game provided many players on the rugby team with a chance
to shine. Becky Snyder '9B and
Courtney Clark '9B, the captains of
the team, scored the first two tries
of the game, leading the team towards another shutout. Liza

Bonilla '9B continued her personal
scoring streak, placing the ball
down in the try zone at the end of
the first half of the game. Charity
Miller '9B scored the last try of the
game after claiming "I don't think
I'll ever score at Swat!" But she did
and she buzzed with excitement!

And scoring was the theme for the
Swarthmore Women's Rugby team
on Saturday. Bridget Arbour '9B
had yet another amazing game;
even though the fans did not get to
see her score, she carried the ball
in some significant breakaways.
Rhiana Swartz'oo, in her latest position as 8-man, played very well
even though she was learning new
moves. Alexa Miller 'OO split this
position with Swartz and as the veteran 8-man, perfected her new
move, the 8-man pick-up. Sarah
Cross '99 not only played well, but
expressed her joy with how well the
team played as a whole, "we have
been making more connections
than ever before." Amber Halsey
'9B played a great final game of the
season as she aggressively raced to
support her teammates and create
successful mauls. Danielle Thomas
'99 teamed up with other players
on the rugby team to form a cohesive defense against Bryn Mawr.
The Back line played incredibly
well with the forwards, which
makes a promising outlook for next
season. Cathy Vaughan 'Ol played
one of the two wing positions and
tackled her Bryn Mawr opponents
ferociously. Beth Vose '99, who

returned after a brief hiatus at Worth
Health Center, got in on some of
the action on Saturday; while she
hadn't played in over 3 weeks, her
performance wasn't hindered by
any lack of stamina she was just
as physical as ever. Morgan Kelly
'9B had a great game, playing in the
second half of the game as inside
center; Kelly has, over the season,
perfected her tackles to the extent
that the she was feared by the
Horned Toads' back line. Beth
Wiles '9B scored all of the conversions for the team, kicking for a
total of six points; Wiles hasproven
throughout the second half of the
season that the fullback position is
her calling. Miller was heard from
the sidelines at the end of the game
saying "we played so well that we
deserve to go crazy tonight."
This season was one of the most
successful and rewarding for the
entire team. Even though some of
the B-side players didn't get to strut
their stuff on the pitch this weekend, their skill is legendary after
this season. Snyder, the forward
captain, commented "it amazed me
how well the team pulled it off on
the last day of rugby this season. It
was more than I ever expected."

Congratulations to the following field hockey members
for their accomplishments:
-Danielle Duffy '9B for being named Ist Team National
All-American. Duffy was also named Ist Team Regional
All-American.
-Michelle Walsh '9B and Holly Baker '99 were selected
2nd Team Regional All-American.

Swat men take home the gold in double meet

The Swarthmore swim team
hosted NYU and Vassar for an
exciting double-dual meet this
past Saturday. Although Vassar
put up a fight, they simply did
not have enough swimmers to
fill all events, and they were no
match for Swat. On the other
hand, NYU proved to be very
tough competition.
This time last year, both the men
and women lost to NYU by a score
of 45-50. This year, the teams were
again neck-and-neck throughout
the meet, but the men broke a long
tradition, and oneupped the women.
The final score of both meets was
46-49, in Swarthmore's favor for
the men, and NYU's favor for the
women. Clearly, this was an exciting day for both teams.

The men jumped ahead early with
a win in the medley relay, and they
soon showed off in the individual
events as well. Mark Friedburg '9B
won the 1000-yard freestyle relay
in a come-frombehind victory, and
Brent "Gauss" Wasser 'OO finished
with a personal best time in the
same event. In a fast 200 Individual
Medley event, Andy "Shaft"
Robbins '9B, and Ryan Fruh '99
finished second and third respectively with excellent times for this
early in the season. Brandon
"Skippy" Walsh 'OO won the 200
butterfly, and at the same time,
Amyeric Pansu 'Ol qualified for
conferences. Carl "Peaches" Sanders '9B touched out his competition

in both the 100 and the 500yard
freestyle events. The men's 500

free was one of the closest races of
the day, and while Sanders finished
first, Friedburg came in right be-

hind him for third place.
For the women, Claire Arbour 'OO
won the 1000 yard freestyle, while
Mari McCrann 'OO continued to
show her newly discovered distance
ability coming in a close third. In
other freestyle events, Becca HowesMischel 'Ol and Molly Marino '9B
swam an impressive 200 yards, unexpectedly l-2ing NYU. Marino also
finished first place in the 500 free as
well. Jill Belding '99 once again
showed her strength in the 200-yard
butterfly. Chalking up another good
breaststroke swim, Erica Rosenthal
'OO finished second in this 200 yard
event. Finally, to let everyone know
that Swat women would not go down
without a fight, Marino, Hillary Clay
'Ol, Howes-Mischel, and Arbour
crushed the competition in the final
400-yard freestyle relay.
This Saturday the swimmers will
host Drew University at 2:00 PM.
