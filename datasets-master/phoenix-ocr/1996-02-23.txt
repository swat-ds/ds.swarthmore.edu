Changes in financial aid spending
proposed last week by the College
Budget Committee have sparked concern among students about theirability to pay tuition. Administrators responded with assurances that Swarthmore will not change any of its

financial aid policies.
Laura Talbot, director offinancial
aid, fielded questions Wednesday
night at a packed meeting in Parrish
Parlors. Students wanted to know why
rising College costs mean higherloans
and higher summer earnings expectations.
Before she opened the floor for
questions, Talbot made a presentation and attempted to assuage the
fears of concerned students. She first
said that Swarthmore's need-blind
admissions policy—in which admissions decisions are not linked to applicants' financial need—as well as
the College's commitment to meeting the full financial needs of all
students will not change.

Survey Indicates Support
for Sub-Free Housing
By Wendy Kemp

Would you want to live in substance-free housing? If so, would you
still want to live there if it were located at Mary Lyons 4? These were
some of the questions posed by a
recent survey in order to analyze the
possibilities of sub-free housing for
the 1996-1997 school year. The results have ensured the existence of
sub-free housing, even though there

are some issues which have to wait
until housing arrangements for next
year have been organized.
At the recent meeting of the Housing Committee, several facets of the
issue were discussed. The first concerned the results of the survey.
"Based on responses to a survey to
the student body, as well as personal
experiences and conversations with
other students," quoted the minutes
for the February 19 Housing Committee meeting, "the committee decided to continue the practice of having some sort of substance-free living arrangements."
The next topic up for debate was
the exact definition of the term "sub-

stance-free." There were concerns
over whether the term applied to the
students' room/hall relationships, or
their general lifestyle. Said onesophomore, "It wouldn't be fair for people
to live in sub-free housing and sign
an agreement not to use in the halls,
and all along use these substances
outside. What would be the point?"
The Housing Committee agreed, for
sub-free housing will continue to be
defined as consisting of students who
choose to have a completely substance-free lifestyle, as opposed to
justabstaining from substances in the
hall.
Some concern was also addressed
as to where the substance-free housing should be located. "I think I might
opt to live [in sub-free housing],"
said one freshman, "But if it were in
the ML no way!" As a result ofthis
attitude, the third floor of Dana is
slated to be substance-free, providing that there is enough demand.This
space is composed of nine doubles
and seven singles, which would house

Swarthmore with financial aid at similar schools around the country, maintaining that even after the changes,
Swarthmore is well below the average in loan and summer earnings expectations, and then emphasized that
Swarthmore scholarship awards have
been increasing much faster than loan

requirements.
She then introduced Paul Aslanian,
vice president for finance and planning and chair of the College Budget
Committee, who was also in attendance.

Then the questioning began.
In a telephone interview yesterday,
Talbot said, "I was pleased to see so
many students there, and I was happy
they were direct." "Direct" seems to
be an understatement considering the
barrage of questions about everything
from student representation and confidentiality of the budget to the fee
increase's impact on campus diver-

sity.
Most students were concerned
about the issue of loans and summer
earnings, and that in their view the
committee was attempting to "balance the budget on the backs of the
poorand financially disadvantaged,"
in the words of one student.
Aslanian was quick to counter this
charge. He said that the rising tuition
reflects only a small part of how the
College is going to pay for higher
operating costs. The higher costs
come from an increase of 4.1 percent
in the compensation pools of both
faculty and staff. He said that while

Students, however, were not convinced and continued to question the
motives and the methods ofthe committee. Most importantly, many students expressed concern that they
have virtually no input at any point in
the budgeting process.

Talbot said this is far from the
truth. "There is so much that is good
about Swarthmore financial aid," she
said. "I hope students there could see
how they have advocates in every
part of the system."
Talbot felt that an article in The
Phoenix as well as a flyer posted
around campus by Student Council

loans and summer work. Talbot main-

tained vociferously that everything
was in print when they got their financial aid and the materials said that
the loan amount would increase.
Students also complained that increases in loans and summer work
expectations may make Swarthmore
less appealing to new students, and
thereforelower the quality and socioeconomic diversity of the student
body. Student Council, in a message
to the student body, went even further, saying, "Already many minority students are declining admissions

offersfrom Swarthmore for financial
reasons, and the campus is becoming
less diverse than one might expect.
For example, while it is official college admissions policy to enroll 10
percent African Americans, actual
African American enrollment has
fallen far below that level, and in this
last freshman class was less than 5

percent."

Students at the meeting also wondered what would happen in the future when the tuition increases might
go beyond students' abilities to pay?
"This year we tweaked with the budget to make it work," he said, "but I
don't know what's going to happen
in the future." He noted that this is

Men's and Women's Basketball Both Beat Haverford During the Last Ten Seconds
David Lischer

Taking the court before the largest
crowdof the season, the Swarthmore
men's basketball team was aware it
was taking part in one of the most
emotional games in Swarthmore athletics. What they did not know was
that the game would be a classic. It
showcased two teams traveling in
different directions. Haverford (149, 8-5) had surpassed almost
everyone's preseason expectations by
locking up its first ever Centennial
Conference playoff berth. Swarthmore (9-15, 5-8), on the other hand,
had an inconsistent year highlighted
by a win over Division I Lafayette
but marred by several late-game
breakdowns.
Yet the teams could easily have
been in opposite positions. Swat lost
four conference games by four points
or less and another in overtime.
Haverford had proven it could hit the
clutch shot with an earlier three point
win over Washington and an overtime win over Johns Hopkins.
The first five minutes were tense
for both teams. Colin Convey '97 and
Ben Schall '97 were each called for
traveling during that span. The Fords
missed their first five shots including
an open look at the basket for sharpshooter Chris Guiton. At 13:44, the
Garnet lead 7-4.
In the next seven minutes, Guiton,
the conference's leading scorer for
two straight years, poured in ten points
as the Fords went on a 16-2run. In the
middle of the run, the Garnet seemed
to reach a point of desperation. After

five straight scoreless possessions,
they turned to the three-pointer. Convey, AJ. Shanley '97, Tim Schofield
'99, and Craig Rodner '96 all missed
on their attempts.
"We called a timeout at a point in
their run [lB-9 Haverford lead]. I
hadn't done this in a while, but I said
to the players that I didn't want anyone to take a shot until the ball had
goneinside at least once," said Coach
Lee Wimberly.
After the Fords had extended their
lead to 20-9, the Garnet counterattack began. Convey, who netted five
ofhis six three-point attempts, led the
attack with his first of the night.
Rodner then proved why he is team
captain by drawing three fouls in the
last five minutes, hitting all four of

his free throws, and helping cool off
the red-hot Guiton, who remained
scoreless for the rest of the half.
"When you're playing in a real
emotional game like Swarthmore
versus Haverford, you can expect it
to be a game of runs as teams are
psyched up by the crowd," said Mark
Pletcher '96.
By the time Sam Voolich '96 gave
Swarthmore their first lead at 22-20
since 13:44,the Haverfordcrowd was
stunned. Haverford guard Jamal
Elliott tried his best to turn the momentum back in favor of the Fords.
But Matt Grossman '96 electrified
thecrowd by giving the driving Elliott
a first-hand taste of Garnet defense.
Just seconds after the block,
Grossman controlled the ball

Saturday night's game against
Haverford College proved to be the
most exciting match of the '95-'%
basketball season. The scene was set:
36 seconds were left on the game
clock. The score was tied at 60. The
bleachers were filled with hundreds
of fans, an anxious air permeated the
gymnasium, fans chanted and
cheered, players nervously huddled
around their coaches.
The referee handed the ball to
Swarthmore and the seconds began
to tick away 35, 34, 33...With only
six seconds left, captain Nancy
Rosenbaum '96, in her last career
game,playing underthe watchful eyes
of her teammates, friends and father,
hit a baseline jumper to put the Garnet up by two. Michelle Walsh '9B
then stole the subsequent Haverford
inboundspass and forced theFords to
foul. This put Holly Barton '99 on the
foul line where she hit two free-throws
to put the Tide up by four. The game
ended with a spectacular 64-60 victory and the fans went crazy.
Being the last game of the season,
Saturday was also "senior night," a
time in which the two co-captain
graduates, Emily Walker and
Rosenbaum, were honored by the
team and the entire school. They were

Students to Discuss Race in
the Comfort of Their Dorms
By Ahyana

Clark

"How does it feel to be a prob-

lem?" asks one of the posters for the
Race and Ethnicity Study Groups that
will begin this Saturday.
It began earlier this year when

Bennett introduced the idea of an
ethnic issues discussion group for the
student body to fellow Lang Scholar
Schosha. Reed, who attended seminar with Bennett, later joined the two
in their efforts to provide a venue for
discourse about these issues.
The current format includes two
showings of the film "Let's Talk
About Race," which documents the
viewsofstudents at universities across
the nation. Small groups are formed
and the follow-up will occur in dorms
across the campus for the remainder
of the semester.
Rebeccah Schosha '96, Rebeccah
Bennett '96, and Matthew Reed '96
have come together to address the
controversial issue of racial identity
on campus and in students' lives.
Ngina Lythcott, dean of the college, noted she was "delighted to be
able to use Hewlett monies to support

these student-initiated programs."
She said, "These were very successful last year, and we hope to replicate
their success in other dorms."
Myrt Westphal, director of residential life, Maxine Proctor, assis-

tant dean and director of the Black

last year while serving as executives
on the board ofthe Swarthmore African American Students' Society. That
year's theme encompassed the idea
of "building new bridges and cementing old ones." Pleased with the re-

sults of an initial meeting, Bennett
decided to organize small discussion
groups to continue the dialogue.
According to Reed, the study
groups were intended to include representatives from different groups on
campus meeting on a regular basis.
Bennett said, "We thought it would
be best to have discussions where
you could really get to the issues
about race and ethnicity, the sticky
things, things that aren't so easy to
glaze over...where you could lay out
on the table what your personal feelings [are] as well as your intellectual
beliefs...in an atmosphere that [is]
small and confidential and met on a
regular basis,...[a place where] you

could [experience] confidence and
trust unlike a one-time workshop."
Though attendance in the small
groups waned as the semester drew to
a close, Bennett, Schosha, and Reed
all found the groups to be successful
and this further inspired them to continue their efforts to foster additional
discussion. The three organizers recognize the opportunity which the college experience offers to meet and
interact with people from different
backgrounds on levels that are not
likely to be achieved elsewhere.

Henry. The WRC includes a library,
kitchen, television and VCR, and

space for gatherings.
"Our space is available for other
groups to make use of. The Board
does not run all the activities in the
WRC, that should be done by every
woman on campus," Bahri explained.
Women not on the Board expect to
play an active role in running the
WRC. Darragh Jones '99 ran for the
Board, but was not elected. She said,
"I would still like to help in fixing up
the house. The bonus of being on the
board is that it wouldha ve been easier
to get funding and stufflike that, but
just because I don't have an official
tide doesn't mean I'm going to care
any less about the WRC."

free housing and their names will be
returned back to the main lottery, just
like those who do not get blocks.
Applying for substance-free housing will be done in the way they
would otherwise apply for blocks: by
filling out a form and listing their
housing preferences in preferred order.

However, there is a downfall in
requesting sub-free housing. Choosing to apply for it will eliminate the
privilege of applying forblock housing. Furthermore, substance-free
housing will be subject to many of
the same rules as block housing. Not
living in a room at all will draw fines.
On the other hand, sub-free students
will not be required to stay in their

spaces all year if they do not wish to,
so students who elect to go abroad or
take leaves of absence will not be

penalized.

Yet another controversial issue
concerned how the sub-free spaces
should be allotted. In previous years,
there have been one of two options
for the process: a separate lottery or
regular lottery. However, both alternatives have their problems.
As a result, a new method will be
tried: letting the students choose substance-free halls by integrating the
sub-free housing with the block process.
Hopefully, this shall streamlinethe
process therefore creating fewer possibilities of either sub-free or non

sub-free students from feeling discriminated against," reported the minutes from the meeting.
The Housing Committee feels that
having some sub-free housing available will "improve the well-being of
the student body as a whole by decreasing hall conflict and encouraging community living."
However, one problem still remains: to some, it does not seem fair
to guarantee certain studentsthe housing of their choice when everyone
else is forced to go through the lottery
process and the risks involved in it.
Said one freshman, "Applying for
sub-free housing and pretty much
knowing you'll get it seems kind of
like taking the easy way out."

Mertz Says Goodbye to Burlap Walls
Palmer, Pitt, Roberts, Dana, Hallowell next renovation targets
By

The infamous burlap of Mertz's
walls can no longer be found on the
public spaces of the first floor. Over
winter break, Physical Plant covered
the walls, painted them white, added
new lighting, and painted all the doors.
It was a routine dorm renovation,
according to Alice Balbierer, assistant director for special projects, who
supervised Mertz's facelift."Our aim
was a complete renovation on the
first floor, as that was all we had time
for," she said, "and we also replaced
the tiles and ceilings in four showers.
The College will eventually renovate all the halls in the building, one
floor at a time; it will probably be

two years. No work can be done in the

Mertz was constructed in 1981 to
alleviate a housing shortage, and the
burlap interior was specifically chosen to avoid the "ugly wall syndrome"
associated with Willets and Howard
Johnson's motels. (The "burlap" is
actually concrete wall covered with
Flexiwall, "a washable, textured covering of vinyl-impregnated jute and
plaster," according to Phoenix archives.)
At first students had no problem
with the burlap, but "lately people

that it is nice, but that the carpets

Peter Prinz '97 said that it was a
pleasant surprise to come back to

One first-year student commented,
"It looks really nice, a little fresher
and newer. But they should have
done something about the lighting in
the rooms as well."

Anne McGarrah '99 said, "It brings

Making ends meet.
Eighty-six dollars and sixty-seven cents.
That's not much to spend on a week's living expenses. But if the College
Budget Committee'srecommendations are approved by the Board of Managers next weekend, that's about how much money most students on financial
aid will have each week ofthis summer for food, clothes, housing, transportation, and taxes.
Consider this: Summer vacation lasts IS weeks. If you work 40 hours
during each of those weeks, and your wages are $5.00 an hour, you'll earn
$3OOO over the summer.
Under the CBC's proposal, rising sophomores, juniors and seniors on aid
will be asked to pay $l7OO of their summer earnings toward Swarthmore
charges. That leaves $l3OO for clothes, food, rent, taxes and transportation.
Divided by 15 weeks, you get $86.67 a week.
Check out what apartments rent for in Swarthmore, or wherever you'll be
living this summer. Remember you'll have to pay for utilities, too. Find out
what food prices are like. Calculate your tax bill. Will you need to drive to
work, or take the bus or train? What if your clothes wear out? Is anything left
over for entertainment? (Forget about saving for the future.)
We challenge you to write a realistic budget that covers all necessary living
expenses and totals just $86.67 a week. We couldn't do it, so we thought up
a few ways to get through the summer with adequate food and shelter:
•Live at home. Interesting, educational work elsewhere—perhaps as a
research assistant at Swarthmore, oras a government intern in Washington—isa luxury when your budget's this tight. (Volunteer work, by the way, is out
of the question.)
•Work overtime, ortakea second job. You won't get torelax much, but who
says you can afford to?
•Take out a loan to cover part of the summer work expectation. That's not
a great plan, since if the CBC gets its way the College will already be asking
you to borrow as much as $ 1000 more next year, but it may be yourbest hope.
And what's another $2OO or so going to matter when you expect to owe
$15,000 at graduation?
The picture would hardly be better if Swarthmore stuck with last summer's
$l6OO work expectation. An extra $lOO spread over 15 weeks would give
financial aid students less than seven dollars a week in extra funds. But the
Board should still reject a plan that ups the pressure on aid recipients: seven
dollars a week is a lot when you're trying to make ends meet on $86.67.
Unfortunately, the College has to make ends meet, too. Students' financial
needs have been rising fast, thanks to national economic developments
beyond Swarthmore's control. It's a miracle the College still practices needblind admissions and gives financial aid to half the student body. And ten
years down the road, this year's $lOO increase in work requirements and
$lOOO increase in loan expectations may seem like drops in the bucket.
If the work expectation doesn't increase, spending must fall or revenue
mustrise. That could mean serving worse food in Sharpies, or fielding fewer
athletic teams, or any number of other equally undesirable cutbacks. Or it
could meanalarger increase in the price paid by students who aren't on aid—which could drive those students to choose other colleges instead.
Should Swarthmore prioritize top-notch faculty, facilities and services?
Does excellence matter ifit isn'taccessible to all? The tradeoffs are tough, and
no one wants to make them. But they must be made.
So before you try to convince the Board that CBC's plan must be revised,
come up witha few ways you think the College can save money orraise more.
While the proposed budget strikes the wrong balance between spending and
aid, that budget will be accepted if students suggest an alternative that
involves having our cake and eating it, too.
The Board meets on campus next Friday and Saturday, March 1 and 2.
CBC's proposal is high on the agenda. Next weekend, grab some Board
members and let themknow whatyou think ofthe plan. Ask them ifthey could
live on $86.67 a week. Tell them where, in specific, you think they should cut

spending so they won't have to increase the summer work expectation.
Taking a stand matters, not justbecause the CBC recommendations put an
unreasonable burden on financial aid recipients, but because they may be the
first step toward making Swarthmore an outstanding college that only the
wealthy can attend.

Dollars and diversity, now and tomorrow.
The College has decided to limit the proportion of funds allocated to
financial aid to 26.4 percent This has potentially serious ramifications for
Swarthmore's status as one of the few institutions of higher education to
maintain a need-blind admissions policy.
A need-blind admissions policy represents a sincere attempt to enhance the
College's socioeconomic diversity. Although the funding cap does not
indicate an abandonment of need-blind admissions, what does it say about the
College's commitment to maintaining or increasing diversity? What if a needblind admissions policy were no longer tenable under the funding allotted?
The question of resource allocation is one of priorities. What, one might
ask, is the point of admitting a qualified, socioeconomically diverse student
body if the College lacks the means to maintain the academic program
students expect once they matriculate?
Until now, the College has managed to accomplish both goals by giving
financial aid and academics higher priority than maintenance. Deferring
repairs isn't the greatest policy, but this diversion of funds has not resulted in
any roof cave-ins or similar life-threatening conditions thus far. Mertz,PPR,
and Danawell can even look forward to some renovations in the near future.
But in years to come, this equilibrium may collapse.
Admittedly, even with generous financial aid, itis difficult for an institution
which many confuse with a women's college somewhere in upstate New York
to attract top students from diverse backgrounds. While the number of
students applying to Swarthmore has increasedrecently, at least in part due
to enhanced recruitment efforts, does this number include more applicants
from underrepresented portions of the socioeconomic spectrum?
More dialogue is needed to understand the factors that make Swarthmore
more or less appealing to students from various socioeconomic backgrounds.
The College must also be aware that any move on its part to restrict financial
aid might have consequences extending beyond this community. If an
institution with a large endowment, in sound fiscal health, decides that it can
no longer be as generous with financial aid, other institutions might be
tempted to follow its example. We hardly need to add that this could have a
significant impact on equality of opportunity in American higher education.

Opinions

In Defense Of The Communications Decency Act

of

the above terms will not fly under
current jurisprudence—but it's not
true that restrictions on such material

are by definition invalid. The court
has established (via FCC v. Pacifica,
1978, and others) that laws can regulate the "time, place and manner" of
transmissions found to be "indecent,"
a term encompassing most of the
above descriptions ("obscene" is in a
category to be addressed shortly).
As such, if the law had required
thatcommunications considered "indecent"be set aside somehow—available only to users certifiedas over 18,
available in expurgated form should
parents so demand—it would probably have some chance of standing
up in court (Yes, there are subtleties
here involving "least restrictive
means" that your columnist is not
going into. But the idea is clear.)
There are cases on record—say, FCC
v. Sable, 1989—-that establish federal jurisdiction over speech; federal

authority to criminalize expression
in certainforms is not contested. (This
just in—the FCC has a wee bit of
control over the content of, say, TV
and radio.) A stipulation that materials that fit the above descriptions be
given warning labels or screened
might have served the bill's purposes
better.
Your columnist admits it freely:
the Communications Decency Act is
not a particularly well-done law. It
ignores the entire maze of guidelines
for regulating speech that the Court
has drawn up, it threatens fines and
jail time for trivial offenses seemingly without consideration for consequences, and it blithely ignores difficult questions posed by the nature
of the Internet. Even so, your columnist isn'tparticularly sure, aside from
a few obvious problems, that Congress can do much better than this—or, put differently, that this law was
significantly different in nature from
a well-done version ofthe same thing.
Congress' role is to put in place some
form of accountability before the law
for violations specific to the Internet,
and it can be argued that hashing out
the details ofmaking people accountable for those violations is not within
the purview of Congress. (Members
of Congress generally claim no deep,
involved understanding of the Net.
Kindly do not expect them to construct a detailed law outlining its regulation.) What this law does do is pass
accountability on to the service providers under whose names transmission of off-limits material occurs.
Now why is this significant? Because, for one thing, it should dispel
the myth that federal inspectors will
be snooping through everyone's email. Federal inspectors have much

university sysadmin will have to

seems to be no realistic expectation
of preemptive screening or access

here as well may not be especially
welcome, but it's hard to see it as an

enforcement mechanism: thelegwork
of actually catching offenders will
still fall to ordinary citizens.
While the obscenity provisions of
the law are not wholly withoutproblems, they do at least provide a means
for prosecution. There seems no compelling reason why this particular

most prudish

media source should be exempt from
obscenity regulations; the Court has,
after all, deemed obscenity low value
speech, which gives service providers fairly broadlatitude inregulating
it. The "community standards" requirement of the Miller v. California
test (see box), while on the one hand
a problem in that a given transmission passes through millions of communities, can make some degree of
sense if communities are construed
to refer to the company that provided
access—since itis only that company
that can set and enforce standards,
and since the "community" reflected
by a user's physical surroundings may
have little to do with the actual community that receives the transmissions. The test also requires that, for
material to be considered obscene, it
must conform to the standards of a
specific law—and given thatthe CDA
does not spell out its standards in
especially useful terms, there are
clearly definitional questions even in
the obscenity provision. At the same
time, the test allows for obscenity as
"authoritatively construed," and
given that the Supreme Court has
spent several decades wrestling with
this very question, applying a coherent standard seems at least possible.
What of the claim that, under the
Communications Decency Act,
Sistine Chapel paintings and other
items that clearly do not merit an
"indecent" label may be grounds for
jail time? For one thing, the indecency provision as it stands is almost
certain to fall in court; whether a
substitute will appear in its place is

questionable. The "literary, artistic,
political or scientific" value test of
obscenity should protect Sistine
Chapel paintings and such: remember, the enforcing of standards will
be done by companies that want to
keep the business of the customers in
question—and therefore will want to

WHAT "OBSCENITY MEANS
The Supreme Court's guidelines for determining obscenity are based
on Miller v. California (413 U.S. 58,1973). This is an excerpt from thenChief Justice Warren Burger's majority opinion:
"We now confine the permissible scope of such regulation to works
which depict or describe sexual content. That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively
construed. The basic guidelines for a trier of fact must be:
(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community
standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest,
(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way,
sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and
(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value."

infringement of fundamental rights.
Inconvenient, annoying, yes. Your
columnist can see that Having to
defend one's words in court can be a
pain. But it simply isn't true that the
law will cut everything but the Grated off the Internet, largely because,
after the first few lawsuits fail because the material in question is protected under current definitions of
obscenity, most stuff out there simply won't be challenged. (After all's
said and done, it's still easier to turn
off the computeror tell Junior to go to
his room than actually bring a lawsuit.) That something is subject to
federal regulation does not mean it
must conform to the standards of the

And between the inconvenience of
some having to spend time in court
and the recognized evil to children of
a total lack of restrictions, your columnist isn't so sure he wouldn't
choose the former.
Your columnist will also venture
to say that a good deal of the reaction

out by those who exercise the option;
pushing the limits by bringing that
material elsewhere may lead to conflict, yes, but the source of conflict
will be offended users, and not a
governing body that decides questions of suitability. The dynamic underlying criticism of the CDA is resistance to regulation of the heretofore unconstrained, and for that, your
columnist is unimpressedby "fundamental rights" rhetoric. The teacher

Joe Roche
The Minnesota Daily
University of Mtnnessota
(U-WIRE) I hate not being able to
take my friend Emily into a bar for a
beer. She is pre-med and involved in
University activities, but she isn't 21
years old. Our righteous lawmakers
say she isn't mature or responsible
enough to drink. So when I go into
one of our many local establishments
near campus, I am restricted to the
company of people 21 and olderwho
are supposedly, by law, mature and
responsible.
Emily is taking this insult with
disciplined patience, however. This
comes from having served in the U.S.
Army. While going through the
Army's basic training at Fort
Leanordwood, MO, she was taught
to fire an M-16 rifle, an M-60 machine gun, a rocket launcher, and a
grenade launcher, and other skills
she may need when our nation calls.
What's more, she has joined every
other person over 18 in voting for our
nation's leaders. Yet, she is, by law,
not mature enough to drink.
The purpose ofa 21 -and-up drinking law is to protect people from
abusing alcohol and to keep a lid on
the reckless activity associated with
young people. People of the older
generations—the typical lawmakers—generally think that the younger
people are, the less able they are to
control their actions.
The law has a negative effect on
students. It makes drinking seem like
a really exciting thing to do. You
aren't cool, it seems, until you can
prove you can drink like the older
crowd. Afterall, doesn't everyone in
this age group want to be older than
they are? So, as aresult, many minors
drink in their homes or in places

where there is no accountability or
supervision. In those settings, the only
purpose of drinking is to get drunk.
And the temptations to overdo it by
power-drinking are strong. Responsible people aren't going to be involved in these situations because

they are, after all, illegal.
Several students Iknow who aren't
old enough to drink overdo it all the
time and don't know when to stop.
This would happen a lot less if they
were able to join the rest of the students for some social drinking when
they felt like getting out.
The drinking law also affects society as a whole. I remember the first
time I went to thefamous Georgetown
bars in Washington, D.C. It was great.
There were college students every-

was bound to show up at the playground eventually,kids. May as well
get used to it.
Then why provide directly for FCC
punishment ofindividuals? Your columnist doesn't know; as he said,there
are portions of this law that he has
trouble defending. He doesn't even
think the portion that deals with indecency is a good idea in any form; at
some point, after all, parental supervision has to start playing a part.
What he can defend, however, is the

spirit, in that it tries to apply the rules
that make sense elsewhere in media
to electronics communication in as
evenhanded a way as possible. That it
goes awry in many areas he will not
deny—but, whenit comes to theclaim
that this medium should by its very
nature not be subject to law, your
columnist must disagree.

rip-off for tourists.
Luckily, there is not the same level

of criminal activity in the Twin Cities, so communities like Stadium
Village or Dinkytown haven't been
taken over by non-University troublemakers. I am not saying that all of the
problems mentioned wouldbe erased
if we all could drink in the bars, but at
least the bars offer a positive scene.
They are controlled settings in which
money has to be paid for each drink.
A sense ofresponsibility is enforced
upon everyone. In this situation, the
purpose of drinking becomes a social

one, not an abusive one.
In a bar, your fellow students will
notice when you get out of control.
This often means that someone will
step in and prevent you from doing
something stupid or getting hurt. Furthermore, people will point out to
you how stupid you were to get so
drunk. In private settings, where is
this pressure? It doesn't exist.
Frankly, I believe there is a lot of
merit in having a beer every now and
then. As students, we face a lot of
pressures and a lotof stress. Relaxing
in a bar with friends is an important
and useful way to unwind, get some
pent-up energy out of your system
and let loose enough so that the next
day you can rededicate yourself to
studying. The truth is, minors are
going to find ways to get alcohol
regardless of the age laws; the law
forces them to drink for the wrong
reasons and in the wrong places. In a
community of college students, it is
also ridiculous to think that dividing
the population with this law is going
to help. All it does is break us apart
and leave the underage group alien-

ated.
It is ironic that the society that
restricts people under 21 from drinking allows those same supposedly

immature citizens to vote and serve
in the militaryright after high school.
As Emily says, "If I am old enough to

vote and die for my country, I am old
enough to drink a beer."
I'll not only drink to that, I'm buying Emily her next one.

Swarthmore Follies Farce at its Very Funniest
By Christopher DiLeo

included a street walker and "The Young
Wife".The male roles— "The Soldier," "The
Poet," and "The Count," were all played by
Johnßieffel '99. Stereotypes, satireand welltimed blackouts brought "La Ronde" full
circle. Philip Ryan '96 presented a dry, yet
humorous introduction to each relationship.
Director Morgan Phillips '96 said, "In cutting and directing the piece, I tried to draw as
much humor from the structure as from the
text itself, poking fun at theatrical conventions, and how absurd they are. The final
dance number (to the song 'Good Morning'
from 'Singin' in the Rain') was intended as
the ultimate expression of that absurdity."
Act llbegan with "Slavs!" (Thinking About
the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and
Happiness). Written by Tony Kushner and
directed by Solveig Holum '97, this scene
presented a satirical view of love, but with a
1980's Russian twist. Katherina Serafima
Gleb, played by Vanessa Morrel '96, was a
hardened Slavic woman in an era of change.
She was visited by her admirer, Ippolite
Ippopolitovich Popolitipov, played by
Phillips, who was desperately and hopelessly
in love withKatherina despite her crude mannerisms. Throughout the scene, Ippolite,
Russian accent and all, tried to woo his love,
but to no avail. However, once a bottle of
vodka is produced, the scene changed for the
more humorous, at least. Leigh Anderson
appeared again as Bonafila Bezukhovna
Bonch-Bruevich, Katerina's lesbian lover.
The final scene was "True West," written
by Sam Shepard and directedby Lesley Tsina
'96. This will be remembered as the scene of
the toasters; before the actors even stepped
on stage, Tsina frantically arranged the props
(fourteen toasters) while the rest of the cast

On

February 17 and 18, the Theater
Studies Program presented the fourth
annual Swarthmore Follies.
The show was comprised of five farcical
scenes from ProfessorKuharski's Advanced
Directing Workshop (Theater 55). The scenes
were based upon published plays, but most
were tweaked ever-so-slightly to make them
funnier. The show took place in the Frear
Ensemble Theater, where the nearness of the
audience to the players created an absorbing
atmosphere.
The first scene, "The Clouds," by
Aristophanes, was directed by MartinCarrillo
97. Itfeatured lan Hansen' 96 as Strepsiades,
an "average civilian" seekingknowledge from
Socrates, played by Travis Miles '96. Much
of the humor came from the contrast between
Strepsiades' vulgarity and Socrates' sophisticated mannerisms. Rain and the descent of
"goddesses" Solveig Holum '97 and Lesley
Tsina '96 made the audience feel like it was
part of the show.
Next was Christopher Hampton's "Dangerous Liaisons," directed by Robert Dull
97. This scene presented a light-hearted view
of the sophisticated and intoxicating world of
love. Leigh Anderson '96 portrayed the seductive yet innocent Mme. de Tourvel, who
both madly loved and despised Valmont,
suavely played by Dimitrios Bonaros '97.
Posturing, primping, sexplay, and strategic
use of furniture combined to present a marvelous effect.
"La Ronde," written by Arthur Schnitzler
was a look at the sexual relations among a
widely varied group of people. Leah Gotcsik
'97 portrayed all the female parts, which
'

'

sat by and watched. The scene finally opened

with Austin, Josh Silver '97, smashing a
typewriter with a golf club. As fragments of
the typewriter flew into the audience, his
younger brother, Lee, played by JeffSevers
'96, polished his stolen toasters. The two
interacted as do most brothers; the younger
was constantly being dominated by the older.
In their drunkenness, the two attempted to
reconcile their life choices: Austin, a wanderer" and Lee, a successful movie writer.
The scene managed to be both funny and
emotional at the same time.
The Follies couldn't have taken place
without a host ofbackstage support, including Kara Herzog '9B, the Light Board Operator; Kimon Keramidas '9B, the Sound
Board Operator; Vanessa Morrel '96, the
House Manager; and the members of the
Theater 14 Lighting Design class.
Director and Lighting Designer Martin
Carrillo '97 said, "It [the project] was very
difficult for me. I had trouble with the style.
Farce is very specific and requires certain
formal considerations. The disjuncture between situation and motivation (lust in a
convent, for example) linked to a direct
causality in narrative eluded me for a while.
That's where the jokes are, and pinning
them down took a lot."
Said Holum, one of the featured directors, "I think we were all very proud of the
evening. It was a culmination of weeks of
presenting our scenes to each other, giving
each other feedback, and even performing
in each other's scenes. This kind of cooperative effort is what makes the directing
program at Swarthmore College unique,
and enables us to present evenings of such
high quality performance."

Action-Packed Movies On and Off-Campus: Adventure for Swatties
brooding ethical drama about the usual themes
(power and corruption, good and evil, etc.)
The result is a fitfully engrossing muddle,
directed by Becker with workmanlike grit,
and weighted down by Jerry Goldsmith's
god-awful score (someone should have fired
the tympani player after the first minute).
The pleasure here is in the details. Shooting
on location in the streets and in City Hall
itself, the filmmakers seem to have a real feel
for the rhythms of life in the Big Apple, and
for the melting pot of slang that gives the
screenplay its distinctive flavor.
They've assembled a terrific cast, including Bridget Fonda as a lawyer for the Detectives' Endowment Association, David Paymer
as another of Pappas's flunkies, and Martin
Landau (so good in "Ed Wood") as a prominent judge with a questionable record. Yet
most of them are given next to nothing to do
(Fonda, inparticular, is wasted). Even Pacino,
the box-office draw, is less significant to the
story than he initially seems to be. His Mayor
Pappas is yet another variation on the persona
that he's been playing (or overplaying) for
years, complete with the swagger and hand
tics that scream "ACTING!" It's fun to watch,
but it's mostly flash. Whenyou enjoy Pacino's
best moments in "City Hall," you're enjoying
Al Pacino, not John Pappas.
The same cannot be said about Cusack,
however. His performance as idealistic, ambitious young Calhoun, complete with an
impeccable country-boy Louisiana accent,
ranks with his best: "Say Anything," "The
Grifters," and "BulletsOver Broadway." This
is the closest "City Hall" gets to a flesh and
blood character, possessing an intelligence
and passion that the rest of the movie only
wishes it could live up to.

Off-Campus: "City Hall"
By

lan Bricke

Herald

Becker's "City Hall" begins on
a street corner in New York City. A
cop collides with a drug dealer, the
nephew of mob boss Paul Zapatti (Anthony
Franciosa). Weapons are drawn, shots are
exchanged, both are killed, and a stray bullet
hits a passing child.
By the time the unnecessarily labyrinthine
plot has unravelled itself, this seemingly isolated incident has unearthed gross quantities
of corruption.
"City Hall" is an almost textbook example
of screen writing by committee, containing so
many styles and themes that the final product
seems almost schizophrenic. The dialogue
veers fromPericles ofAthens to Harry Truman
before diving headfirst into a morass of gangster movie cliches (courtesy of screenwriter
Nicholas Pileggi, co-writer of Martin
Scorcese's "Goodfellas" and "Casino"). It's
at its worst in Pappas's interminable and
downright embarrassing speech at the funeral of the murdered boy. When it sticks to
the tough-guy jargon of backroom politics,
like in the charged meeting between Pappas
and the corrupt Brooklyn leader, Frank
Anselmo (Danny Aiello, superb as usual), the
screenplay displays real bite.
"City Hall" wants to be many things: a
crackerjack suspense thriller (idealistic young
deputy mayor investigatesshady goings-on),
a political set-piece(much of the plot is based
on former mayor Ed Koch's political travails—another of the screenwriters, Ken
Lipper, was Koch's deputy mayor), and a

Jon: Hey there, folks! Inkeeping with the
movie themeof this week, we' ve killed Carl
and Kate and are now going to write their
reviews for them. They and their Quaker
Oats are as dead as the career of Wilford
Brimley—now it's our turn.
Jessica: So without further ado, we
present our reviews (make that our random
opinions) of this week's movies, both of
which have the enlivening theme of
death.Thefirst movie for this week is "Manhattan Murder Mystery," a 1993 Woody
Allen flick. The movie focuses around
middle-aged couple Carol (Diane Keaton)
and Larry (Allen) Lipton who have become
stuck in the mundanity of their daily life and
the predictability of their relationship.
But lucky for them, this is all about to
change. Their sweet old neighbor, Mrs.
House, dies underratheroddcircumstances.
Her seemingly sweet stamp-collecting husbandis the immediate suspect of Carol, who
is dying to play amateur detective. Despite
the protests of her moreconservative, wimpy
husband, she begins her investigation, breaking into Mr. House's apartment and following him around the city.
Carol, along withfriends Ted (Alan Alda)
and Marcia (Angelica Huston), and even a
reluctant Larry soon become entrenched in
the mystery. A bunch of plot twists and a
climatic finish follow, but I won't tell you
anymore.

This is not a very suspenseful murder mystery by any account; remember it's Woody
Allen, not Alfred Hitchcock. Nevertheless, it's
a fun, easygoing movie that is pretty consistent
and only occasionally slow.
The best part of it is the random lines. My
personal favorite: "There's nothing wrong with
you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and
a polo mallet."
Woody Allen is thoroughly annoying as the
whining Larry, but that's probably the point of
the character. I particularly liked Angelica
Huston as the sultry and savvy Marcia, and I
wish her character had been more developed.
Overall, a decent movie, especially if you're
into Woody Allen (I'm not). I would say it rates
a manslaughter.. .it's good, but not truly killer.
Jon: I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen on the
whole either, but this movie got me to appreciate his work. You've got to see this movie; it
was great. The way in which the dialogue
continued to flow made it realistic, and when
weird stuff starts happening, it made it suspenseful in a real life way. Hey, it's got Alan
Alda in his best work since M*A*S*H. I give
this one a Bobbit; it justcatches your attention.
Jessica: That's lovely, Jon. I hesitate to hear
what you'll say about the next movie, but I
guess I have no choice, so, go ahead.
Jon: Okay, my opinions on "Copycat." Well,
earlier this year, the infamous lan Bricke
reviewed this thriller, and I happen to be his
ride to all the movies he reviews, so you might
have heard a little of this. We don't always
have the same opinions, though, because I'm
older, wiser and from the East Coast, so naturally better.
Seriously, this movie was pretty good. Harry
Connick Jr. was the big surprise for me this
round. He did an incredible job. When you see

him in this, you'd never expect to havehim
singing a song that gets your foot a-tap tappin'.
But don't go to this movie for him. He's not
in it that much. This is a movie for Sigourney
Weaver and Holly Hunter. Unfortunately, as
much as I like Sigourney in those wacky
"Alien" flicks, as a dramatic actress, the
woman bugs me. Give the woman a shot gun,
and she's a Babe-and-a-half. But here, she
was just mediocre. Holly Hunter, though,
was pretty cool as a cop that gets the job done.
This movie is about a psycho psychiatrist
that's being stalked and the cop that tries to
save her. Sigourney is appropriately psycho,
and Holly Hunter is the defending cop that
just rocks pretty hard. All in all, a good
movie. You should definitely go check it out
if you like thrillers. It can get you in bootyshaking mode before a party, or debating
about whether or not you liked it in old
Swattie fashion. I'd have to rate this movie a
second-degree murder—you could do worse.
Jessica: And I'll rate it a Reagan; I swear
I don'tknow anything about it.
Jon: Right. Well, I guess that's about it.
Thank you again to, um, those other former
movie reviewer people; we swear we'll never
forget you.

Please note locations:
Friday's movie will be
shown in LPAC cinema;
Saturday's will be in
DuPont Cinema.

years ago, while the rest of
America floundered with cumber
some hard-bound books, an unknown
San Francisco poet named Lawrence
Ferlinghetti was busy making literary history with the opening of his City Lights
bookstore/publishing house dedicated entirely to paperback books.
The diminutive store-front became the
center of a cause-c£lebre when obscenity
charges were raised against City Lights for
publishing Allen Ginsberg's poetic manifesto of the beat generation, "Howl". In
subsequent years Ferlinghetti's press
brought to the fore an international avantegarde insurgent voice with poets such as
Gregory Corso, Denise Lermotov, and
Vladimir Mayakovsky.
Before multiculturalism had become a
catch phrase amongst universities and
cognizante, Ferlinghetti was driven in search
of diverse voices, the aim being "to publish
across the board, avoiding the provincial
and the academic.[for], an international,
dissident, insurgent ferment." Such diverse
personalities as American Charles
Bukowski and French Marie Ponsot have

FEATURES
“Take Back the Night" Planned to Raise Campus Awareness

By

Kirstin

Lindermayer

Most

people are aware that violence
against women is a serious issue
today. Until one knows the statistics, however, it is hard to comprehend exactly how serious an issue it has become.
Every ten seconds, a woman is battered.
Every three minutes, a woman is raped. Every fifteen minutes, a woman is killed. These
are frightening statistics, and several movements in this country have already been established to change them.
One of the most important movements involved in the fight to prevent violence against
women is "Take Back the Night." The general motive behind TBTN is to promote support for survivors of sexual abuse and assault
and to increase general awareness about the
dangers that women face today. TBTN will
be held for the first time at Swarthmore during the week of February 25.
TBTN emerged in the seventies on college
campuses as a support movement for women
who were survivors of rape. It focused on the
women's political movement and encouraging women to unite in the fight against rape.
Today, TBTN takes place on college campuses and in cities nationwide. In most cases,
both women and men are now encouraged to
join forces in the struggle against sexual
abuse and assault. "The spectrum ranges from
no men within fifty feet to men walk in the
back to men are totally included," said Becca
Hover' 99, one ofSwarthmore's TBTN coor-

dinators.

Take Back the Night now promotes sup-

port for survivors not only ofrape, but of
domestic violence, child abuse, incest, or
sexual assault. TBTN seeks to educate
women about what it means to be a survivor and how to fight back and protect
themselves against violence or abuse. It
educates men in terms of how to be allies
in this painful, but crucial struggle for
women.
In October, Hover went to Bryn
Mawr's TBTN and found it so empowering that she decided to bring it
to Swat. She spoke with Gabi KruksWisner '99, who had also attended
several TBTN marches and together
they decided to make it happen here.
"Some people think that because
Bryn Mawr is so close and so active
in the women's movement that
we can just go there, and that
we don't need TBTN
here," said KruksWisner. "People need
to know that violence

The t-shirts were donated by the Domestic

rally and march, both
of which will take place on Friday, March 1.
"The point of the rally and march is to create
an energetic, spirited atmosphere so that at
the events later that night we will feel moti-

vated to talk about action and reform," said
Kruks-Wisner.
The rally will take place on Parrish Porch,
and will be host to several speakers. Katie
Koestner, who was raped during her freshman year at the College of William and
Mary, will be speaking about the transition
from activist to speaker.
The second speaker at the rally will be
Aishah Shahidah Simmons, who works for
the American Friends Service Committee
and has recently finished making a video on
rape and black women. She will be speaking
about rape and incestfrom the perspective of
black women. Grapevine, one of Swat's a
capella groups, will also sing at the rally.
The rally will be followed by a candlelight
march across campus. Hover and KruksWisner have planned a course that includes
the major dorms, the tunnel by the train
station, a small sectionof the Ville,PPR, and
the Field House tunnel. The march will end
at the Women's Resource Center. "We are
trying to plot a course that will take us
through the tunnel and other parts ofcampus
where women feel afraid to walk alone at
night," said Hover.
The march will be followed by Voices at
the WRC. Voices is an opportunity for survivors to share their experiences and for
friends of survivors and non-survivors to
share their support. There will be two separate Voices—one for women and one for
men to create a safe, comfortable atmosphere where survivors can speak about their
experiences without feeling vulnerable.
After Voices, women and men will reconvene in the WRC to have an open mike event
and to listen to several other speakers. The
Open Mike will consist of poetry,
mances, and discussion about abuse and
assault, and ways in which students can
make Swarthmore a safer environment for

Why

Once Home to More Than Ten Greek Organizations; Most Didn't Make the Grade

"I've Got a Little

"I've got a little Phi Mu girl
Way down in sunny Dixie land
With eyes of snare me, dare me,
Oh do you care for me blue
As long as Grecian frats shall stand
She'll wear the golden heart and
hand
And maybe, some day a frat pin.
I'll tell you that pin
Will make a stunning guard for her

Girls may come and girls may go
But she's the only girl for me, I

With

Weber

the establishment of a new frat-

ernity at Swarthmore, we thought
we'd take a look back at the heyday
of Swarthmore's fraternities...
By 1914, the fraternities of Kappa Sigma,
Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Upsilon, Phi Sigma
Kappa, and Tau Alpha Omicron, and the
sororities of Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Delta
Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Delta Gamma
were announcing dozens of new pledges on
the front page of the Phoenix each September, just as they would for the next few
decades.
When the Women's Student Buildings,
now known as Bond and the Lodges, were
built next to Worth in 1925, there were six
sororities: Chi Omega and Phi Mu had joined
the list. Each sorority pledged $ 10,000to pay
for the cost of a Lodge containing a kitchen,
locker-room, living and meeting room, guest
room for alumnae, and bathroom.
But sororities would not last much longer
at Swarthmore. In November 1931, the abolition of sororities was seriously proposed for
the third and final time. President Frank
Aydelotte issued a statement which read, in
part, "When I came to Swarthmore in 1921,
there were 153 members of Women's fraternities, constitutingjustover6o% of the women
then in college; in this academic year of
1931-32 there are 228 members of Women's

fraternities, constituting over 77 percent of
the women now in college. The result is a
situation which tends to be uncomfortablefor
the minority left outside."
By that January, three plans had been proposed: to limit the size of sororities; to postpone membership until sophomore year; and
to abolish sororities on campus entirely. The
Phoenix threw its weight behind the third of
these options in an editorial on January 12,
but the decision ultimately lay with a committee of fraternity members, alumnae, and
the Dean of Women. In March of 1932, this
committee decided to stop pledges to sororities. There was no mention made of banning
men's fraternities.
Indeed, the golden age of men's fraternities at Swarthmore was still far from over.
The October 9,1934 Phoenix carried an item
that would horrify most of today's Swarthmore students: a listing of the average GPA
ofeach fraternity on a three-point scale. (Honors students were assigned a GPA based on
their freshmen and sophomore year grades).

Theta Sigma Phi 1.80
Women Students 1.70
Non-fraternity Men 1.69
Phi Sigma Kappa 1.63
Phi Delta Theta 1.55
Phi Kappa Psi 1.52

Kappa Sigma 1.12

There will be four speakers at the Open
Mike event: Suzanna Coles, a Swat alum and
a member of Women Organizing Against
Rape; Christie Duncan of Domestic Abuse
Project; Dana Yamate and Colleen Bartley,
members ofFriends of Survivors at Swat; and
Karen Henry, GenderEducation Advisor.
Several other events will be going on
throughout the week on campus. Both AWOL
and AMOL will be having discussions about
increased awareness at Swat. There will be an
information table in Parrish Parlors throughout the week with yellow ribbons and information. The controversial movie "Kids,"
which deals with issues of teenage females
being taken advantage of and raped by teenage males, will be shown on Tuesday, February 27.
An interesting aspect of TBTN is that the
Screw Your Roommate dance will be held on
the night after the rally and march. However,
the coordinators of TBTN feel confident that
the event will have a positive effect on the
night ofScrew. "We are hoping that it [TBTN]
brings an increased awareness at Screw, and
throughout the semester as well, about the
fears that women on college campuses must
deal with," said Kruks-Wisner.
Countless hours ofplanning and fundraising
have gone into bringing TBTN to Swat. "We
wantto support all survivors and people really
have to come,"said Hover. "When I tell people
that I'm organizing TBTN, they often assume
that I'm a survivor. However, whether I'm a
survivor or not is irrelevant because TBTN is
important for everyone. We need to draw
attention to issues ofviolence and realize that
everyone isaffected by it. We are not immune
to it at Swarthmore. TBTN is a first step
towards opening eyes on this campus."

Parrish Fourth Pioneers New Sport
Chair Racing is Favorite Pastime for Men on Fourth West
By

Seth Garbkr

It's one in the morning on the long
hallway of Parrish fourth west and
four men stand alongside two office
chairs. You can see the fierce determination in their eyes, the will to
succeed. They haven't come here to
discuss the Engin lab that half of
them didn't go to, but rather to participate in a Chair Race. Teams are
picked, with one person pushing and
one person sitting in each chair.
Between each team and victory lies
a great obstacle: the narrow constriction ofthe hall at the beginning of the
race thatallows only one team through
at a time. It is here the race is won or
lost. Either you get through first or
you're history, having been dashed
against the plaster walls as your opponent speeds down the rest of the
hallway unhindered. In fact, in the
history ofChair Racing, only the team

Green.
All has not been roses, however.
There have been complaints from

various parties concerning excess
noise caused by the races. All races
are now mandated to be held before
eleven p.m. or they must take place
on the second floor, where participants are further inspired to greatness
as they race past the president's office.
Equipment disputes have at times
also plagued our small league. Some
people contend that junior Ryusuke
Ishikawa's modern office chair (no
longer in use because Ryusuke left
for Spain) provided an unfair advantage over some older, outdated models found in the stairwell. There is not
a noticeable difference however, in
the records of teams that have used
Ryusuke's chair and those that
haven't Another strong contender
for best chair is Bob Griffin's simple,

yet effective, kneeling chair. What it
comes down to though, is that the
team with heart is the team that wins.
If this doesn't sound like a sport
worthy of at least club status, maybe
you need some more convincing.
Along with its high level of physical
danger, it is extremely tiring.
Take for example the tag team
multi-floor race held last semester, in
which teams raced across to the

women's side, carried their chairs
down the stairs, went across the third
floor and proceeded to finish the race
on the ground floor, creating much
confusion on the part of the desk

One member of the historic team,
Khan, is credited with inspiring the
whole Chair Racing phenomenon.
Last semester, Joe's voice could be
heard echoing through the hall in the
wee hours of the morning, long after
the Tarble bells had stopped tolling,
yet just as unfailingly predictable,

This past weekend the Garnet

positive note. With only three wrestlers competing, expectations were
not what they otherwise would have
been. Nevertheless, Pete Balvanz '9B,
Alec Stall '97, and Tirian Mink '9B
turned in outstanding individual performances against formidable opponents under less than desirable conditions.

Wrestlers Finish Season at Gettysburg
M.

The Swarthmore College Garnet
Boomsticks took on the Co-ed Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science Team in an exciting match on
Tuesday. In perhaps the most impressive victory in recent Swat Club
Volleyball history, the Boomsticks
destroyed their opponents 15-2, 156,15-8 in little over an hour.
From the outset, it was evident that
every Boomstick came to play and
every Textile did not. Outside hitter
Dave "Tourniquet" O'Brien '96
turned in an impressiveperformance.
His astounding jump serve collected
14 service points, 7 of which were

However, the real story does not reside in the play of the starters, it
resides in our bench play.
After the first three sets, the match
was over. However, the teams decided to play two more sets just for
fun. Apparently the Textiles wanted
more punishment, so Swat's bench
demonstratively screamed,"Come
Get Some!!!" as they crushed the
Textiles 15-8,15-10.
Jimmy "I want you, I need you, I
gotta have you" Chan '9B set the tone
early in the fourth set with some
outstanding passing (his style is definitely one to watch). In fact, he was
so impressive that Ashley Flynn '9B
said, "He was the hottest passer on
the court." It was too bad his passing
failed miserably off the court as he
was denied by the female Textiles.
Chan's passing was nicely complemented by the consistent setting of
Tsuyoshi "put your shirt back on"
Mitarai '9B. He had an impressive 13
assists in sets four and five.
It follows that if there is good passing and consistent setting, there will
have great hitting. That was the case
Tuesday. Outside hitter Dwayne
'Twenty-minutes" Chambers '99 was
the largestrecipient ofMitarai's sets.
After 5 kills in a row, the Textiles
tried to compensate by putting up a
triple block against him. But in true
Boomstick fashion, Chamber's

ers.
"Before I came to Swarthmore, I
thought badminton was just a fun,
recreational sport—nothing serious,
and certainly not something I would
consider a varsity sport—after all,
my experience was limited to backyard fun," said Kemp, a first year
player. "But after seeing how many
people turned up for this tournament
and how successful it was, my mind
has done a 180 degree turnaround.''
Chen thought the tournament was
a lot of fun, especially because ofthe
relaxed attitudes of many of the players, including the William and Mary
team. But aside from having a good
time at the tournament, she also enjoyed the opportunity to watch some
very skilled players.
"It was awesome watching some
of those more experienced players
play. They are what I aspire to be in
about 50 years," Chen explained.
"It was great to see so many talentedathletes from all over the northeast. The tournament has really
grown, both in size and in the talent
of the players attending," added
Megan Smith '96, a four year member of the Swarthmore team.
Following the tournament,
Swarthmore's varsity team headed to
Bryn Mawr for an away match Tuesday night Suffering their first loss to
Bryn Mawr this year— after beating
their arch-rivals earlier in the season—the team expressed disappointment.

"Bryn Mawrhad 37 guests there to
cheer them on to victory," noted
Fischer. "Perhaps if we had some
Swatties at our home games to support us we could really kick some
butt!" A subtle hint.

However, during this stretch Ford
center Matt Harley scored his only
four points of the night to tiethe game

as good as over, but Convey replied

After a strong defensive stand that

Garnet a 55-52 lead. Not to be outdone, Elliott, who only seemed to hit
the pressure shots, replied with a
three-pointer ofhis own with 17 seconds remaining.
Both sides of the stands were on
their feet in anticipation. The Garnet
ran a set play hoping to draw the
Haverford defenders out of position

final points to put Swarthmore up with seconds left in the game.

Co-captain Matt Grossman '96 described the last few minutes of the
incredibly close and bitterly fought game. "It couldn't have been
scripted any better... It seemed almost poetic that someone who gave
so much of himself throughout his time here should end his career by
hitting the clutch shot to beat Haverford... I don'tthink that any player
on the team had any doubt that Craig would hit the shot."

Rosenbaum, in her last basketball game at S warthmore, beat Haverford
last Saturday in what was easily the most exciting game of the season,
When she broke a 60-60 tie with a baseline basket withonly six seconds
left in the game.
"To win the Haverford game on a drive which basically said 'we're
gonna win or lose this game with me' was inspiring," said Craig Rodner
'96, who witnessed the final seconds of the game while waiting to take
the court for the men's game.
Rosenbaum, who finished with 14 points and 9rebounds, grabbed her
I,oooth career rebound in the first half. She became the first player to

one of it's primary strengths.
In the 55 meter dash, a group of
athletes including Chris Hourigan
'%,GioviGrasso-Knight'9B,Kelley
Hauser '99 and Reuben Canada '99
produced two season best times and
a strong showing against an excellent sprinting field. In the 55 meter

points for the team and seated them
second and third heading into this
weekend's conference meet.
In the 200 meter dash, Turner

During a track meet, the majority
of the attention of the coaches and
spectators is focused on the events
occurring on the track. However,
there is another group of athletes
whose hard work and dedication are
an integral part of every victory a
team earns.

Some ofthe most notable performances this week were turned in by
the throwers and jumpers. In the
shot put, Eric Walton '97 continued
to improve producing the first +4o'
throw by a Swarthmore athlete in
the past four years. The high jump
saw Ben Heuston' 96 and Brian Baird
'99 scoring points and again produc-

eleven victories.
This weekend the 1500 meter run
proved an excellent showcase for the
team's distance running talents.
Reents, Duncan Kirkpatrick '99 and
Phil Jones '99 finished first, fourth
and eighth respectively in a very com-

petitive race. The 800 meter run saw

Wyndam Strodbeck '9B and Gordon
Roble '99 lead for most of the race
with Strodbeck pulling away in the
last 150 meters to take first and Roble
holding on for a solid third.
Using the strong aerobic base they
had built during cross country, Graham Lucks '9B, Kirkpatrick and Jeremy Weinstein '97 made their presence felt finishing first, second and
third in the grueling 3K run.
Finally, in the last and one of the
most exciting races of the day, the
men' s 4 x 800 meter relay ,S trodbeck,
Jones, Roble and Reents won the
event going away. Reents anchored
the relay and received the baton 10
meters behind the first place Widener runner. Over the course of the
next 800 meters Reents not only
caught and passed the Widener athlete, he managed to amass a 50 meter
lead in what has been heralded as one
of the most impressive races of the
year.
Overall this season, the men's team
has set four school records and posted
a competitive record of 11-0 making
it the only undefeated team on campus.
