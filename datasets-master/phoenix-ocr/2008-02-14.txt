Students leave the college under suspicions of drug use
BY SARAH PETERSON

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

Over the course of the past few weeks, the college
administration's investigations into alleged drug activity
have resulted in three Swarthmore students taking sudden leaves of absence. According to a written statement
released to The Phoenix by Associate Dean for Academic
Affairs Garikai Campbell '9O, this began when "substances
believed to be drugs were found in a dorm room on campus and turned over to the Dean's Office."
Following an investigation into the situation, the
Dean's Office decided to turn the substances in question
over to the Swarthmore Borough Police. And according to
the statement, "Moreover, these conversations ultimately
led the Dean's Office to three students whose alleged
behaviors and activities warrantedfurther discussion and
scrutiny as possible violations of College policy." These
three students have been confirmed by Campbell as now

having taken leaves of absence.
According to an account provided to The Phoenix via email from the first student to leave campus, two administrators and a Public Safety officer entered the student's
dorm room with the student's permission. These school
officials found what they believed to be illegal substances.
Following a meeting with Associate Dean for
Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw and Dean Campbell,
and a longer meeting with the students' parents in attendance, the student followed recommendations to take a
leave of absence for the semester.
When initially contacted about the incident, Public
Safety referred The Phoenix to the Deans' Office for questions.

So far, there have been no College Judiciary
Committee proceedings relating to the case. However,
according to Dean Campbell's statement, the college is
still in the process of investigating the case, and is yet to
decide whether and when there will be formal disciplinary proceedings.

Deans are also hoping to clarify any confusion that
may be arising from speculation in the community
regarding these incidents. According to Campbell's statement, "there are many details that we cannot share for
reasons including the need to protect the privacy of students involved."

Associate Dean Myrt Westphal declined to comment on
the specific case at hand, but spoke more broadly about
the college's policies and practices relating to drug activity among students.
"As people understand, our philosophy is that we don't
go out looking for misbehaviors or rule-breaking or lawbreaking," she said. "But if it comes to our attention we
will definitely follow up on it."
To some students, the fact that the Deans' Office intervened in drug activity may come as a surprise, due to a

misperception that this is something the administration

doesn't follow or care about.
"That's a refrain I've heard a couple of times in the last
week or two: 'Well, the administration doesn't care.'
Wrong," she said. "This case brings to light that there are
issues that students need to be aware of that might affect
their behavior. While we are an educational institutiution, we also have rules and punishments if those roles
are broken. Drugs are high up on the list of things that we
will not tolerate."

"As people understand, our
philosophy is that we don't go out
looking for misbehaviors but if it
comes to our attention, we will
definitely follow up on it."
Myrt Westphal
Associate Dean for Student Life
...

Without commenting on or indicating anything about
the activity of the students who have left campus,
Westphal explained that the Deans' Office will take action
against drug-related activity, particularly if it involves
the dealing or distribution of illegal substances.
Westphal distinguished between the illegal distribution of alcohol to minors and the illegal distribution of
drugs, insfoar as alcohol is illegal for some people, but
drugs are "not legal for anyone."

"We're going to take a stronger stance
about any
kind of distribution or selling," she added. The associated
dangers of dealing and distribution involve the kind of
people that may be brought on campus by drug dealing,
and whether anyone involved would inflict harm or theft,
or what might happen if large amounts of money are owed
to someone.
When following up on leads or evidence of drug activity, the deans walk a tight line between competing concerns for the privacy and educational experience of individuals involved, and the safety and integrity of the college community as a whole.
"One thing that may get lost every now and then is that
Swarthmore is in a broader community, and we owe it to
the larger community as well to take these matters seriously," Campbell said in interview.
In certain cases, individuals come to the deans when
...

they have knowledge of illegal activity that makes them

fearful, and believe that authorities should step in. These
individuals may remain anonymous, but coming forward
still helps the deans prevent further problems, especially
if they hear from multiple sources.
"I don't think we in authority swoop down on some-

body, but we do act reasonably, quickly and strongly, listening to other people's sides of the stories," Westphal
said. "There's tremendous amount of consultation among
the deans about what we should do next: Who should do

When should we do it? Who else should be included?"
If pursuing the matter involves entering a student's
room, this is within the deans' powers. According to the
Student Handbook, "any dean may enter and inspect a residence hall room without the resident's consent if there is
reason to believe that any college regulation is being or
■
has been violated."
In the case that a student is suspected of engaging in
drug-related activity, how the administration proceeds
can vary depending on the severity of the situation. "We
would often strongly encourage someone who was just
using to leave
particularly if other circumstances indicated that they weren't going to class or they were causing
a nuisance in the dorm, something like that," Westphal
said. "So it doesn't have to just be distribution or the use
of a felony drug."

intended to assist Student Council president Peter
Gardner 'OB in explaining the planning process failed
to get off the ground, Gardner perservered and continued with an introduction to the planning process
as it relates to the Swarthmore 2020 project.
According to Gardner, a large motivation for the
2020 planning in general was the success of the
Meaning of Swarthmore capital campaign, which
ended earning upwards of $216 million in endowment. The Swarthmore 2020 project is expected to
garner hundreds of millions more in funding for the

One of the more major planning committees,
Gardner explained, is the Steering Committee, which
is responsible for deciding how much of the money
dedicated to the campaign is going to be spent.
Gardner went on to highlight the individual members of that committee.
A large part of the event consisted of students
gathering in small groups and brainstorming ideas
on paper.
Additionally, student representatives from several of the planning committees were present for dialogue
to answer questions or bounce off possibilities for the committee.
The event ended in a free-for-all fashion, where
the floor was opened to an unorganized discussion
between attendees and committee members so that
attendees could highlight what they felt were the
most important issues to be discussed.

'Horizons' plugs science to girls
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
The
Expanding Your Horizons
Network is currently planning its next
conference for March 29 to help get middle school girls interested in math and
science. The annual conference, started
in 2005, is part of the national
Expanding Your Horizons Network,
which focuses on providing middle and

high school girls with role models and
hands on experience in science, technology,

engineering

and mathematics,

according to the program's Web site.
"I don't know if I ever thought that
going into math and science was not
available for me, but it is a valid concern," said Taylor Rhodes 'O9, a member
of the EYH Network. "It's great that programs like [EYH] can change the norms
that people perceive; that's the aim of
the program."
The conference is held every spring
on campus, and draw middle school stu-

dents from all over. Students come from
the Philadelphia area but also from New
Jersey and Delaware, according to
Patricia Kelly 'O9, EYH member and
organizer of this year's conference.
Although initially schools heard about
the conference mainly through word of
mouth, EYH has tried to expand the
types of students it draws in. "We've
expanded and tried to cover a wider
variety of socioeconomic statuses and
racial diversity as well, to distribute
opportunities to all girls better," Kelly
said.

"[The girls] like the idea
of the hands on part,
doing the experiment and
seeing things change."
Ginger Indivero
Chemistry lab instructor
The girls that come to the conference
have a variety of backgrounds in the sciences. "We get everything from girls
from the Chester school district who
don't have a very strong science background to girls from the nearby private
schools which have strong science programs," said Ginger Indivero, a chemistry lab instructor at Swarthmore who
has run workshops at the conference for
the past two years.
The conference is an all day event,
beginning with registration at 8:30 a.m.
and ending around 3:30 p.m., according
to Kelly. The girls attend four different
workshops throughout the day, each 30
to 45 minutes long. These workshops are
run by a variety of women who are part
of the scientific community, including
Swarthmore and Tri-Co professors as
well as professionals in scientific fields
from nearby areas, according to Kelly.
The workshops cover a variety of topics,
from chemistry and biology to economics and math.
"I run a workshop called Chemistry
is Colorful," Indivero said. She said she
has featured this workshop for the past
two years and plans on offering it at this
year's conference as well. "We make red
cabbage indicator to show the girls that
even household items can be chemicals." The workshop shows girls the
changing colors that occur when the red

cabbage indicator is added to regular

household items like vinegar or lemonlime soda. The girls also take Kool-Aid
or black frosting and separate the different colors contained in them. "They like
the idea of the hands on part, doing the
experiment and seeing things change,"
Indivero said. "It makes them feel like
they are real scientists using real scientific equipment."

Along with the four workshops, students participate in a discussion of gender and the role of women in the sciences. "In the gender discussion the
girls learn about the role of gender in
education and the gender roles perpetuated through time that are just now
being broken," Kelly said. The discussion provides an open environment for
the girls to discuss any issues that they
have been having in their classes or
with their teachers. "If they felt discouraged about any of their classes or if

there was something that they wanted to
talk about, they could in the discus-

sion," Kelly said.
The gender discussion is just another
part of the conference that attempts to
support these girls by helping to fill in
the gaps in their science educations.
"The conference emphasizes things that
don't get emphasized in school," said
Nicole Belanger 'OB, who originally
brought a section of the EYH Network to
Swarthmore after she attended a similar
conference when she was in middle
school.
"It allows the girls to see how science
helps people, real world applications of
science. We show them the part of science that is more fun, different things
they wouldn't have seen," she said.
The students and parents of the students appreciate the chance to experience science in a new way. Professor of
Economics Amanda Bayer not only has
volunteered as a workshop leader but
also has brought her own children to
participate in the conference.
"[My daughter] had a lot in common
with the other girls, school and sports,
but they don't usually talk about math
together," Bayer said. "So this gave
them an opportunity to do something
and participate in something that society doesn't often encourage them to talk

about."
At this year's conference, EYH will
be expanding on their program for par-

Belanger. While the students participate
in discussions and workshops, parents
also have a chance to see what their kids
are learning and how they can best support their daughters.
"The program gives parents ideas of
how to support the girls in math and science over a long time," Belanger said.
"The conference is one day, so we want
to give parents the tools to give their
daughters the encouragement and push
for the rest of the time."

hope to see that continue."

Black history month engages the African diaspora
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu
In observance of Black History Month,
various student groups and organizations, academic departments and the
Black Cultural Center have contributed to
and coordinated several lectures, discussions, performances and workshops that
will discuss and celebrate the African
Diaspora on campus.
According to Tim Sams, Assistant
Dean and Director of the BCC, Black
History Month was historically commemorated at the college as a shorter Black
History Week in 1926, only to have later
"morphed" into the Black History Month
that we know today.

"[Black History Month] is
our way of giving an
insider's look at what is
happening in our
community."

President of
SASS, Founder of ABLLE

Department of Black Studies, the William
J. Cooper Foundation, the Swarthmore
African Students Association, Students of

Carribean Ancestry, Enlace and the
Swarthmore African American Student
Society.
Under the auspices of the BCC, Sams
then works toward producing a calendar
free of any scheduling conflicts.
He also invites the groups and departments to comment on whether the range
and diversity of the events scheduled are
appropriate.
This year's Black History Month
kicked off with an Afro-Brazilian
Drumming Workshop taught by Alex
Shaw 'OO, followed by a Cooper Event lecture entitled "Slaying the Dragons that
Threaten our Children," by Geoffrey

Canada.
Canada's lecture held last Friday discussed issues concerning children, particularly the effects of violence and other
adverse factors, including economic conditions.
According to Sams, this lecture was
one that would appeal to various groups
on campus that have been working on initiatives concerned with similar issues in
Chester communities.
"It's interesting because the Geoffrey
Canada event is a function of my desire to
have a moment where all the educational

During the planning stage of Black
History Month in November, the BCC
contacts the various clubs, organizations
and departments interested in contributing an event for the month.

It is these bodies themselves that are
the most invested in organizing their
events, according to Sams.
"A few years ago, we had decided to
migrate away from the idea that the BCC
is responsible for Black History Month
because it basically ghettoizes the idea
and allows others to abdicate their
responsibility," Sams said.
This year, the Month's events are

Black History Month will also incorporate Afro-Latino Week and AfroCaribbean week.
"What you have in this month AfroCaribbean week, Afro-Latino week is a
reflection of these groups coming to
understand that there is an expectation
that they put something together and

The events of Afro-Latino week concluded last Saturday night with a spoken

looking forward to Eldridge's talk. "It's
giving not just the black community on
campus, but the entire Swat community a

chance to hear his story," he said.

"My piece 'Not Another Love Poem,'
gave me an opportunity to connect with

black females," McKend said.
"I think we share in the degradation
and absence of love that we often face. I
felt really good about performing it during this month because I felt that at this
particular show
there would be lots of
students who could connect and benefit
from my message. I was really excited. It
was the perfect opportunity and the perfect timing," McKend said.

Another event coming up next Monday
is a Fireside Chat with Maurice Eldridge
'6l during which Eldridge will share his
perspective as an African-American student at Swarthmore during the late 50s
and early 60s.
"I could simply say that being an
African-American student in those days,

still being called Negro, was sometimes a
very lonely person to be in the late 50s
and early '6os," he said.
"It certainly was a complex life situation
I will have some things to say and
then I will invite people to comment

people were."
"I'm just hoping that people get a lot
out of it and the entire Swarthmore community takes part in all of the activities
that are happening for the rest of the

'Blueprint' tutors for tests
BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu
This semester, when preparing curriculum and activities for
students of Chester, Blueprint
Project tutors and mentors are
bearing in mind the upcoming
Pennsylvania System of School
Assessments while also trying to
lessen the burden of tedious test
preparation.
According to Tim Sams,

Assistant Dean and Director of
the Black Cultural Center,
although the Blueprint Project's
purpose is not to deal directly

with the issue of standardized
testing, it is an inevitable part of
public schooling that will be
addressed and incorporated into
the schedule of the project. "What
we realized is that there is very

the basics of a five-paragraph
essay, brainstorming and how to
organize writing ideas.
Currently, they are working
upon expanding on the basic
writing knowledge gained from

previous semesters. Tutors are
also working on having the students to solve math problems and
improve upon reading compre-

hension.
"We don't want to make them
write essays all over again, but
we want to recap what they're
already doing," said Tigest
Tamrat 'OB, one of the Blueprint
tutors.

"I think the literacy part and
the writing part is the most chal-

lenging part for the students

...

That is what we tend to focus on,"
Tamrat said.

According to Giles, there is

little way around it," Sams said.
"The curriculum has been modified to bring more of that information in The curricular piece,

are not even close to what's on
the test," Giles said. "So, you
have students that are not going
to know all the questions. They
just kind of predict their failure
before it even happens."
Consequently, tutors and mentors alike are making efforts
towards not only academically
preparing Chester students to
pass the PSSAs but are also integrating "self-esteem builders" to
address whatever emotional distress students may be experiencing come test-taking time.

...

Charmaine Giles 'lO, Head
Coordinator of the Blueprint
Project and the main person concerned with responding to this
curriculum issue, has worked
towards incorporating more
PSSA material into the program.
"This semester, the mentors
and myself focused and are focusing on how to actually take the
PSSAs," she said. "I took examples from previous curriculum
used in the project."
Previously, the tutors have
focused on teaching the students

into the test.

Islamic studies proposed
BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

The faculty have proposed a
new minor in Islamic and
Arabic Studies for the curriculum. The new minor, if
approved, will be an interdisciplinary field encompassing
courses in the religion, history,
sociology/anthropology
and
modern languages departments.

Assistant Professor of Arabic
Walid Hamarneh is one of the
current faculty members who
will be involved in the program.
"The program was conceived as
an interdisciplinary program
that attempts to provide students interested in the study of
Islamic society, religion and a
different part of the world with a
variety of courses that well help

them achieve that," Hamarneh
said.
"We don't have [faculty] now
who do all aspects of Islam and
Arabic,"
Hamarneh
said.
However, a faculty member in

the history department confirmed that the department is
actively looking into the creation of a position for a professor specializing in modern
Middle Eastern history.
Sociology and Anthropology
Professor Farha Ghannam has
also contributed to the dialog
surrounding the proposed pro-

gram, and feels that there is a
need for students to learn more
about Islam. "It's not only a set

of fixed traditions or texts as
many people tend to assume,"
she said.
"It's a diverse set of prac-

tices, texts, discourses and traditions. It's important for any liberal education to equip the students to learn how not to homogenize Muslims but to be sensitive to how they articulate their
identities in various contexts
and
in
different ways,"

Ghannam said.
So far, there has been a lot of
student interest in the new program. "Second year Arabic language students are very interested as well as students taking
classes on Islamic religion and
sociology and anthropology,"
Hamarneh said. He said that the
three departments share many
students and students from all
three have expressed interest in
the new program. The faculty
hope to launch the program
soon, and will begin informing
interested students about the

program's offerings and prereq-

and 'them.' I very much look forward to their broader contribu-

tion to enhancing the dialogue
between the U.S. and various
Muslims societies," she said.
According to Ghannam, the
growing interest of students in
learning about Muslim societies
and a minor could prove valuable after graduation.
"Some of our graduates who
informally worked on issues
related to the Middle East/Islam
ended up working as journalists
and activists in different NGOs,"
Ghannam said. "Others went to
graduate school and are working towards other degrees that
would allow them to teach about
Islam and Muslim societies or
who are going to foreign services and so on."

One of the requirements in
the new minor will be Arabic
language courses. According to
Hamarneh, learning Arabic is
essential to the study of Islamic
culture and society.
"Arabic is important for
Islamic studies," Hamarneh
said. "Arabic and Islam are
closely connected but should be

Overall, Hamarneh believes
the minor will be very popular.
He said that Islamic studies programs used to take the form of
graduate programs at big universities, but student interest in
the field has prompted the introduction of such programs at liberal arts colleges. "Having a program at such a small school
shows the popularity of this," he
said. "I've been asked about this
more than anything else in the
past week."
With this popularity, there
are hopes that the program will
expand as it gains a foothold.

There are several students
who have already expressed a
strong interest in becoming
minors in the Islamic and
Arabic Studies program. One of
them is Andrew Loh 'lO.
"[Forming this program] is one
of the most groundbreaking
majors that any college has
done," he said.

Loh, who is a Political
Science major and a second year
Arabic student is considering
Islamic and Arabic Studies as an
honors minor. Although the
requirements are not yet established, he looks forward to the
program.

"Arabic has such an

importance in the world today.
Considering the geopolitical
importance of Islam in the modern world, this minor is a good
to learn about for the future,"
Loh said.

Loh believes that Islamic
studies fits both student ideals
and realities. "I think the program is good in terms of ideal
Swattie attitudes and real world
answers," he said. "Arabic opens
a whole new culture and people
who learn the language are a
rare breed and have an edge in
the job market."
Despite all the excitement,
the Islamic and Arabic Studies
minor has not yet been
approved.

Westphal explained that, as in the case of all violations
of school regulations —particularly with "big mistakes"
there
such as academic dishonesty or sexual assault
are two systems of adjudication within the administration: Adjudication by deans for minor infractions, or a
hearing with the CJC for major infractions, according to
the Student Handbook.
"The President or the Dean can put somebody off campus without a procedure if they feel like the student is a
danger to themselves or others," Westphal said. "There
are two levels of justice: there's meeting with a dean, and
we can go all the way up to probation. But if somebody's
going to be expelled, they have to go through the CJC.
That doesn't mean that CJC wouldn't do something like
give a warning or give a probation."

those matters are held in abeyance and must be resolved
if the student hopes or plans to return to the college."
For students who leave and apply through the Dean's
Office to return to campus, there may be a CJC hearing
waiting for them. Each case is considered individually,
with special consideration given to how the student has
spent their time away from Swarthmore
in treatment or
counseling, in jail, taking classes. The nature of the original case, and the student's involvement therein, would be
considered as well. "We look at the individualand we look

at the educational experience," Westphal said.
In terms of making public reports, the college follows
the requirements of the Clery Act, established in 1990.
According to these requirements, most college officials
must report within 24 hours to Public Safety if they have
heard about an incident of criminal activity, whether that
means sexual assault, drug use or possession or otherwise.
"Those statistic are maintained by Public Safety," Westphal

they may not be thinking about," Campbell said.
"In Swarthmore," Westphal said, "we will get further by
doing it this way, by letting students know that we won't
tolerate this. And basically we don't want it on campus,
and we would rather it disappear than to punish it."

Darfur radio on the air
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
Now just entering its fourth semester, the Darfur Radio Project is solidifying itself as an organization and getting ready to reach out to a greater
audience. The project, funded by the
Lang Center for Civic and Social
Responsibility and a Project Pericles
Fund grant, was founded by Sarah

Manion 'O7 in Fall 2006.
As a comparatively young initiative, DRP remains relatively unknown
at Swarthmore, let alone among the
wider public.
Since its founding, DRP has focused
on creating a firm base and producing
consistent, quality shows, rather than
on advertising. So far, this method has

been fruitful.
"We've been trying to regularize
our production process in terms of
making sure we have enough pieces for
every show and making sure we have
someone who's a set producer for each
show, and we've solidified all of the
members' skill levels in terms of radio
production and how to produce a piece
from start to finish," DRP member
Chelsea Davis 'lO said.
"Everyone with us now who was
with us last semester pretty much has
produced a piece from start to finish,"

she said.

"Every piece is a collaborative

and everyone reads each
other's scripts and gives everyone feedback, so you're never really alone durprocess

ing your piece," DRP member Bettina
Tarn 'lO said.

Without a resident journalist like
Ayub Nuri of War News Radio, whose
contacts prove instrumental to the
show, one may expect DRP to have a
dearth of contacts.
However, much like their peers at
War News Radio, members of Darfur
Radio Project have become adept at
finding sources online, through phone
books, social networking sites and the
internet phone service "Skype."
When responses to interviews are in
Arabic, Nabta Idries 'lO, who is not
involved in the actual production of
the show but has lived in Sudan, helps
translate pieces into English.

At Howard, Republican affiliation is taboo
BY JADA SMITH
HILLTOP (HOWARD UNIVERSITY)
(U-WIRE) Black Republicans, one of the
many issues on the list of social taboos within the black community, can be cause for
--

negative attention for African Americans

with conservative views.
The
Howard University

College
Republicans, one of the two student political
parties on campus, is struggling to stay
afloat due to a lack of members, which is
reflective of the national percentage of
blacks who vote Republican in the national
elections
under 15 percent.
The question as to why there are so few
black Republicans involved both on campus and on the national front in politics
may be raised.
Michael Varner, president of the
Howard University College Republicans,
said the answer is simple: it is a cycle that
has been ingrained in the minds of African
Americans from birth.
"People have been raised this way,"
Varner said. "Because your parents are in
the Democratic Party, you're in the
Democratic Party. Blacks have been socialized that way. And if you're not
then

be
Democratic,

Independent. We [Republicans] run into

problems and conflicts all the time...it's
tough."
He continued, "Just about everybody in
school knows that I'm a Republican and people acknowledge me as a Republican negatively all the time."
The Howard University College
Republicans stand behind three tenets that
drive their organization: political diversity,
intellectual discussion and democracy,
which line up with the goals of the National
Black Republican Association (NBRA).
The NBRA's goal is to return blacks to
the party they originally aligned themselves with and to inform them on how
black Republicans are fighting for

advancement.
One of the main points that Varner
tries to stress about the Republican Party
and his organization is political unity.
"We want to focus less on registering
people as Republicans," he said. "We want
to redefine unity. It's not healthy for one
group to just do all one thing. We want to
try to create a diverse student body."
At a campus of more than 10,000 undergraduate students, only two attended the
Howard University College Republicans'
first meeting of the year.
"There are people that are gonna say
they are Republicans to stir conversation

or to appear prominent, but where are
they?" Varner asked.
He continued, "I would strongly challenge the idea that there are more
Republicans at Howard University, because
I do not usually see them come out."

with other people or spark a debate that they

may not be prepared to handle."

Patterson continued, "When you say

things, you have to have everyaspect of your
argument right." Many people associate the
Republican Party with extreme right wing

conservative views.

"Just about everybody in
school knows that I'm a
Republican and people
acknowledge me as a
Republican negatively."
Michael Varner
President of Howard
University College
Republicans
Khamal Patterson, a junior political science major, was one of the two students who
attended the meeting and is currently
exploring Republican views. "Sometimes
people do shy away from controversial
issues," Patterson said. "People feel if they
touch a certain issue, they may hit a nerve

Contrary to popular thought, there are
Republican Party members who have liberal

views.

Ultimately, Republicans believe the government should have very little responsibility as far as the people are concerned, and

that the masses should have individual
responsibility.
In addition, Republicans believe the government should not be responsible for public
programs, such as welfare, public housing,
social security, food programs ad public

health care.

Referring to the apparent lack of active

student Republicans on campus, Varner said
he would be willing to pay someone to find
all the supposed "masses of Republicans
around here."
Despite the lack of boisterous conservatives, few can blame those who choose to be
silent. When contacted, other Howard
Republicans refrained from commenting on
their political affiliations in fear ofmore negative feedback from their peers.

After jokingly declaring to a
friend "You know what? My goal
is to somehow get myself to the
national convention in 2008,"
Kolker never believed that she
would manage to follow through
the process of actually becoming a
delegate for the Obama campaign.
"The thing that I think has
allowed me to do this is the
Obama campaign has focused
very strongly on getting young
people involved and engaged," she
said.

In order to become a delegate
for the Pennsylvania Democratic

gates within her district, then
the top three delegates that won
the most votes would get these
spots in the national convention.
"It's also a competition
among the delegates for any of
the candidates who gets the
most votes," Kolker said.

Kolker and the other dele-

gates must also help put Obama
on the ballot for the state of
Pennsylvania by obtaining 2000
signatures, in addition to the
delegate signatures, "since no
candidate is ever automatically

on the ballot," she said.

They successfully managed
to collect more than enough signatures by staking out locales
like Borders, the Co-op and
Sharpies. "The next step of the
process is the Pennsylvania primary coming up. I have to get
people out to vote in general and
get people to vote for Barack and
for me because I will be on the
ballot," Kolker said.

Party, Kolker had to apply to both

Gail Conner, a lawyer at an
engineering firm, is one of the
six Obama delegates alongside
Kolker within the 7th congressional district. She has taken off
work in order to dedicate herself
to a campaign during a time in
which, she said, "[college students] are actually motivating
their parents."

Conner has been a registered
Independent all her life up until
the current presidential election. She said she registered
Democrat and is a supporter of

Obama most strongly because of
his stance on the war in Iraq.
"Obama's position is transparent," Conner said. "He voted
against [the war] and I just feel
more comfortable with him in
that he's the one most likely to
end the war."
Conner
became strongly
invested in the campaign
because she hopes that the
"audacity of hope" ideal that
Obama carries through his campaign will help to put behind the
"ugly" past of slavery and segregation. According to Conner,

Kolker is one of the dedicated
individuals that have motivated
her.
"We just don't want the old
people with old views to keep us
from changing the future. We
want a new future that's not
based on the color of our skin
but our character, and that's
what [Kolker] represents," she
said.
"The wisdom of my children
and people like [Kolker] is actually more accurate than my own,
and I don't say that lightly.
Because of people like her, I'm
involved. It has a bigger dimension," Conner said.

Grade distribution Web site serves as guide in CA
BY ALLISON FUNG
DAILY BRUIN (UCLA)
(U-WIRE)
A Web site containing the grade distributions of professors in their courses from a host of uni-

versities and community colleges in California has been
designed by Mike Moradi and UCLA alumnus Brandon
Sos.
Early Saturday morning, the Campus Buddy Web site
was launched.
Moradi and Sos were students themselves when they
began the nearly four-year-long process of creating the
site.

it's a resource," said Kevin Tan, a sectoo much, but
ond-year undeclared student at UC San Diego.
While UCLA students may not be abandoning the
well-used Bruin Walk Web site anytime soon, they now
have the option of turning to Campus Buddy as an additional resource for information about professors and

select a school and access information about courses via
department or professor.
Graphs show the percentage of each grade given in
the course, and statistics, such as how many classes were
analyzed, are also given.
All professors in the particular department are listed,
allowing each of their classes to be compared.
Users can also rate professors on certain teaching
aspects and give an explanation for their assessment.
The creators said that they were inspired in part by
Bruin Walk, the Student Media Web site in which UCLA
students can rate professors and post reviews about
courses.

"I would use it. I use [similar
professor-rating sites] right now to

The scope of the Campus Buddy Web site is broader:

"As students, you don't get paid.
Your salary's your grade. Our goal is
to create a better environment for
students where they can make more
informed decision about... courses."
Mike Moradi
Campus Buddy Co-founder
"We wanted to create a unique platform where students can view professors more objectively," said
Moradi.
The Campus Buddy Web site, financially funded by
Moradi's own salary, enables its users to create accounts,

The colleges that it covers range from California State
University Monterey Bay in Northern California to
Oxnard College in the southern part of the state.
Though some students have said they are skeptical of
the information given, the creators guarantee its authenticity.
Accompanied by a team of 10 college students, they
spent a year coordinating with school officials to retrieve

"I would use it. I use Bruin Walk and Pickaprof.com
right now to find the right teachers," said Christina
Wong, a first-year chemical engineering student.
She added that as an engineering student, she does
not have much of a choice when it comes to choosing professors or classes, but she would use the site when fulfilling general education requirements.
In the end, the creators say their purpose is to benefit
the students, whose job prospects depend heavily on the
grades they receive in college.
"As students you don't get paid. Your salary's your
grade. Our goal is to create a better environment for students where they can make more informed decisions
about the courses they take," Moradi explained.

the academic data, Moradi said.
"We've got over 8 million grades from 32 campuses (on
the site). It's 100 percent from the schools," Moradi said.
"Every one of those grades came officially from a cam-

pus."
University officials confirmed a public request for
academic information up to fall and spring quarters of
2006 was made.
College students looked forward to the release of the
site, publicized on Facebook in the weeks prior.

Though they started out living on the same
hall and knew each other from the beginning of
freshman year, it took Lucy McNamara 'OB and
Dan Peterson 'OB until spring semester of that
year to begin dating.
"My computer broke after winter break,"
Peterson said, "and I started spending a lot more
time in [Lucy's] room."
"He stopped being so anti-social," McNamara
added jokingly. Though theirfriends all insisted
that they were going to get together, the two kept
denying that anything of the sort would happen
(blushingly, I'm sure),\ for quite a bit of time
before they actually started dating. Now, two
and a half years later, they're engaged and are
schedule to be married this July in Vermont.
"We knew fairly early on probably about
four months into the relationship
that we

more a question of timing," Peterson said.
Both McNamara and Peterson are plan- j

couple wanted to have a one-year long
engagement in order to have enough
time to prepare for the wedding (turns

out those things take quite a bit of
preparation
who knew, right?),
which they wanted to schedule

for the summer between college and graduate school

Harbor with McNamara's family. "There's one
hike that Lucy likes on Sergeant Mountain,"
Peterson said, 'and so I brought the ring up with
me on the hike and when we got to the top, I was
going to propose." Except it started pouring rain
as soon as the two reached the top of the mountain. At this point, everyone started running
away in order to find dry land, leaving Peterson
with not enough time to propose. To complicate
matters further, the group (which consisted of
Peterson, McNamara and her family) got lost in
the confusion of running away from the rain.
The couple was toward the back of the pack,
however, and were having a fun time in
spite of the weather and lack of direction, so Peterson decided that then
was as good as a time as any and
asked McNamara to marry him.

In Islam, there is no engagement or dating period;
two people get to know each other in a social situation
under a social supervisor and when they realize that
they like each other and can imagine spending the rest
of their lives together, they get married.
"We broke the news to our parents over
Thanksgiving break," Nuvia said. Both their parents
were caught off guard by the news. "They were shocked
on both sides," said Mark. "They kind of brushed it off,
like, 'Oh, kids say the darndest things.'"
After classes ended, though, Nuvia and her mother
went to spend Christmas with Mark and his family, at
which point both sets ofparents realized that their children were serious about marriage. "They were like, well,
this is really happening, so I guess we should start planning a wedding!" Nuvia said.

Hassan laughed. "It wasn't what they expected. I don't
think they wanted us to be married at such a young age,
but they realized that it was our decision and that they
could only really support us, so they decided to be okay
with it and to do whatever they could to help us."
"We came to an agreement that getting married early
isn't such a scary thing," Mark said. "No matter if we got
married now or after graduate school, we would still be
partially dependent on our parents. The way we framed
it was that it's going to be difficult getting through extra
schooling no matter what, and that it would be a better

The couple at their nikkah this past Winter Break.
Nuvia Hassan Skaden 'OB and Mark Skaden 'OB knew
each other for about one year before they decided to
make their commitment official this past winter break
with a nikkah, the first part of an Islamic marriage in
which the marriage contract itself is signed.
"It was a far bigger thing than we could have ever
asked for," Nuvia said about the occasion.
Though they didn't start planning for the event until
a few weeks before it happened, they knew that they
wanted to be married soon after getting to know each
other: "We decided to be in it for keeps pretty early on,"
Nuvia said.
"I think the second month that we even knew each
other, we bought two ball pythons, and the shop keeper
informed us that they live for 50 years ... That's a pretty

Nuvia and Mark are planning to have the second part

attend medical school but still needs to fulfill a few
requirements first, so he is planning on finding a

"We wanted to make sure the time we spent together

Not your typical Pixar toon
BY ABBY GRABER
agraberl@swarthmore.edu

While everyone appreciates a good movie
about the foolish hijincks of talking

fish/rats/cars/toys/bugs, it's always refreshing to be reminded that Pixar doesn't have a
death-grip on all that is animated and that all
that is animated doesn't have to be about the
breathtakingly rendered misadventures of
anthropomorphized things that are cuddly
(and yes, through the magic of Pixar, fish,
bugs and rats count). "Persepolis" uses animation in a way that sadly, in America, you won't
find outside the art house. Filmmaker
Marjane Satrapi intends not to delight the eye
or to amuse children, but to pour out her personal story in a style just as much her own.
Though the film is in black and white, the
content is anything but. Satrapi, with the help
of co-director/co-writer Vincent Paronnaud,
constructs a fluid narrative of her life, starting as a young child on the eve of the Iranian
revolution and continuing through her early
adulthood. She resists turning her life into the
cliche that is the American media's representation of the Middle East and its inhabitants.
Though Satrapi's life is chronicled in all of
its peaks and troughs, including her youthful
rebellion against the Iranian religious authorities, her misadventures with love and her
struggle with depression, the film avoids dealing in melodrama. You'll find none of the wailing and the gnashing of teeth that would normally accompany the telling of a life such as
hers. We're used to viewing the Middle East
through a lens that is entirely political and
current
events.
heavily

"Persepolis" makes no attempt to avoid these
categories
Marjane's opinions of Iran and
the West are quite clear
but the story is ultimately more about the struggling people in it
than the events that surround them.
"Persepolis" is like an extended rumination

on a

life that Satrapi herself ha:

memories that gain new life and
new purpose through the retelling. You can see the author's

need to tell this tale, even if she herself may

not know entirely what to make of it.
"Persepolis" is adapted from Satrapi's
graphic novel and it retains much of the feel of
the original medium. As in many graphic novels, the deceptively childish style at first registers incongruously with the story
how
can these flat and heavy lines do a person's
life justice? Yet Satrapi's clear, simple and
graceful figures are all that she needs for the
task. Her sense of humor comes through in the
movie's cartoonishness and casual embrace of
slapstick. The menace of violence lurks in the
picture's heavy shadows, rarely revealing
itself, but is often there. The visuals pull back

from

trying to

deal with large events and

instead concentrate mostly on the personal.
As the visual style highlights, "Persepolis"
is relentlessly unpretentious, at times to the
point of being pedestrian. While it always feels
awkward to judge a piece of art that reflects
someone's biography, Satrapi's story can

become repetitive

her rebelliousness, her

detachment from the culture around her, her
relations with men
all these themes repeat
cyclically throughout the film. And all are presented to the reader in the same blunt deadpan, as if to say, "Here it is. Take it or leave
it." As a result, you always sort of feel on the
verge of feeling something, you never quite get

to.

At the same time, this upfront style is part
of Satrapi's appeal. While her life seems full of
ambivalence, it is offered up so confidently
and so unabashedly that the presence of the
author radiates from the film. Satrapi may not
be comfortable in her own skin, but she is
completely at ease laying bare her soul in
front of an audience. Not to go all Intro to Film
on you, but she authoritatively commands the
viewer's gaze

her blunt presentation and

acknowledgement of the ambiguities and fail-

We should
remember that it is a comedy because
'sadness is the funniest thing in the
world,'" quoting playwright John

many aspects of romance, including
broken hearts, insecure men and even
a character that Klaniecki describes
as "the awkward Swattie." Nussbaum
also said that the play contains "magical realism" and St. Clair commented

interesting instances of "the literalization of a number of metaphors,"

around a bag with a broken heart in

play. Each actor plays more than one
part, in some cases, up to four.
The two first time co-directors,
Katherine Bates 'OB and Nora
Nussbaum 'OB, said that they had
anticipated having a smaller cast, but
because some of the actors who auditioned were great for certain parts,
the number of cast members grew to

seven. This is the first time that Bates
has directed a production since she
was in high school, but Nussbaum codirected last year's production of
"Arcadia" (in which Bates acted).
Both commented that they have really
enjoyed working with each other and
that having two directors contributed
greatly to the play.
"Almost, Maine" consists of a
series of vignettes, all centered on

some aspect of love or romance. St.

"Almost, Maine" is sponsored by

allowed it to open on Valentine's Day.
Everyone should come out this
week and support these hard-working
actors. If you do, Klaniecki promises
that "this play will make you feel
happy, and when all is said and done,
that's really what it's all about."

advantage to using the word "fierce"
in that it conveys a mood that literal
descriptions of a garment alone cannot communicate. Sure, when
Christian tells Sweet P that her garment is "a little Chewbacca" or that it

worthy. The designers were led into a
room where six women wrestlers
referred to as divas, were punching

told them that they were to design
wrestling outfits for these ladies. And

was writing in the early 20th century,
he did not intend this analysis to
extend to the realm of fashion in the
21st century. But in both situations of

But inevitably, the overuse of the
word "fierce" causes it to lose its
punch. Certainly in the commercial

the mood that the word conveys by

the same mistake every time "Fuck the Pain Away" comes
on, but lucky for you, I am here to set it all straight and show
you just how silly you've been, but of course. Aren't you so
pleased? Of course you are!
The first time I heardPeaches, I think, I made a face that
was so clearly Are-You-Serious-This-Is-The-Most-RidiculousThing-Ever with that curled upper-lip sneer thing that grayhaired British men in red silk robes with tobacco pipes

terribly amused by the wit, charm and eloquence of lyrics
like "Stay in school 'cause it's the best" and the repetition of
"Fuck / Shit" ad nausuem. While Peaches quickly became,
and continued to be, a staple of every dance party playlist I
ever made from high school onward, it wasn't until much
later on that I started thinking of whatPeaches was doing as
ground-breaking, necessary, important and revolutionary.
Although I'm aware that Peaches is not really trying to
make any sort offeminist statement with her music, I don't
really care. I am going to completely ignore everything that
she has said about her intentions (or lack thereof) because
her intentions don't really matter at all to me. Hey Peaches,

doesn't matter so much as its very existence. One music
video shows Peaches growing body hair at an exponential
rate
a commentary on how much attention her act oflaziness has received, but also an indirect commentary on
female body image and what it means to be sexy on your
own terms.
Peaches' live performances challenge the heteronormative social standards against which we measure ourselves
and our relationships with others; they blur the distinction
between genders, combine feminist ideas about body image
with queer gender politics and put forth a new notion of sex
appeal and beauty that doesn't conform to the stale, mainstream ideals that are elevated in Victoria's Secret advertisements. Sexed-up and glammed up, she asserts power
over her own body and sexuality, combating the portrayal of
women as sexualized objects who cater solely to men or to
the music world's predominately masculine sphere. She is
subversive, she is self-confident and empowering, she is
iconic.

Peaches' music is about questioning our traditional
notions of gender, about challenging the way we identify
with a particular gender, about redressing the imbalance
between the sexes; it is about empowerment in a rock culture that is aggressively masculine and about what it means
to be sexually attractive on your own terms. In naming her
second album "Fatherfucker," Peaches made a move that, to
me at least, very much resembles the third-wave feminist
movement to reclaim derogatory words like "bitch" and
"cunt." For those who aren't Wikipedia-sawy, Peaches has
said about the name of her second album: "Motherfucker is
a very mainstream word. But if we're going to use motherfucker, why don't we use fatherfucker? I'm just trying to be
even." Sporting a full beard on the cover of the album, her
choice of cover art blurs the distinction between genders in
the same way that her lyrics do.
Although she seems very reluctant to state that her work
has any feminist undertones, intentionally or not, the fact
remains that it does: in concert, she prances around on stage
wearing a bra and tight, hot pink hot pants with exposed
pubic hair, a little bit of a tummy, unshaved armpits and an
unapologetic attitude. Sometimes, she dances around with a
strap-on dildo. Though the body hair is, as she has repeatedly stated, a result of laziness, the reason for the body hair

Music production has been
a hobby of Rivas's for nearly a
year. Armed with nothing
but the music software

to infuse a Chopin

Okay, that lead was a little overly indulgent, but it's the written expression of
everything that gets me really excited about
one of WSRN's radio shows for this semester, which will be inviting all different musicians in the Swarthmore community to perform and then mixing their work into polished productions ready for the Billboard

charts. "The Osiris Grave Show," airing on

Saturdays at 4:00 pm, is the brainchild of

one of Swarthmore's most eclectic personalities. He goes by Sergio Rivas 10 by day,
Osiris Grave by night, and I sat down with

took music theory AP in
high school, and basically
everything I make is pretty

much based on the knowledge that I got from that one

Rivas is excited to work with a variety of
musical styles. He has everything from electronica by Zack Waterfire 10 to a brass band
to acoustic guitar by Jon Peters 'O9 lined up.
Rivas is particularly interested in working
with acoustic music because it's one of the
few sounds he can't easily simulate with his
sythesizers. Rivas also hopes to work with
the genre of hip-hop because "I like hip-hop
music, but I haven't really been able to really make anything on my own. I don't know
why I just can't really come up with any sort
of hip-hop idea to put stuff on top of." Rivas
would love to work with any hip-hop musicians, but he laments, "I think Swarthmore

genre's heavy link to sampling, hip-hop
might just be Rivas's next big territory to

cover.
And almost as fun as the show's concept
itself is the creativity and intensity with
which Rivas has been working on publicizing the show. On top of distributing flyers,
Rivas has fleshed out his alter ego Osiris
Grave, giving him a facebook group and a
sequin-studded Venetian mask to wear during the show. "I just like the whole anonymous thing because it gets people more
intrigued," Rivas said. "Having mystery
makes things more interesting and gets people talking ... It's more of a publicity stunt
than anything. Just to get publicity, get
more listeners." Words from a true pop star

Other events, such
as the Swarthmore Progressive Christians' "Pizza and
Parable" and Ruach's Shabbat services happen weekly
throughout the semester.
Religion and Spirituality Week served in part to
promote religious life at Swarthmore by showcasing
the many different religious groups on campus.
Furthermore, the Week encouraged the exploration of
Interfaith at Swarthmore.
Swarthmore deems
Interfaith important enough to fund two Interfaith
interns whose job it is to promote Interfaith discussion
and activities on campus. Swarthmore is rare in its
concentration of different religions: in a population of
1,491 students, Swarthmore houses 11 religious groups.
The possibilities for productive Interfaith discussion,
such as that of Religion and Spirituality Week, abound.
It is very important to promote such a rich and diverse
religious community, as well as foster discussion within the community.
Furthermore, Religion and Spirituality Week created a space for discussion regarding the nature of religion at Swarthmore and what it means to be religious
here. One of the issues that came up in this week-long
discussion, some of which took place on the foam
boards in Shane lounge, is the difficulty many people
seem to have with being involved in religious life at
Swarthmore. I have heard people say that they find it
lonely to be religious here, while others expressed feeling as though they were being attacked and ostracized
for their beliefs. One religious person noted that discussing personal faith is "very politically incorrect on
campus." With so many different religious groups and
such a well founded Interfaith network, why do people
find it hard to be religious at Swarthmore?
In researching this column over the past semester,
I have spoken with many members of various religious
groups on campus and it seems that those who enjoy a
thriving religious life on campus significantly outnumber those who face adversity as a result of their
faith. Religion is a source ofcomfort for many people at
Swarthmore, and the different religious groups provide people with the opportunity to partake in something very important to them and to do so with others
who feel the same way. Others only started practicing
their religions at Swarthmore. If it weren't for the
vibrant and diverse religious and spiritual community
here, they would not have discovered that which has
brought them such happiness.
Despite this, many seem to believe, even if they
haven't experienced it themselves, that to be religious
at Swarthmore is taboo. Some cite the intense academic environment in which faith and belief have no seat
at the table as evidence. It is possible, however, that
those who find it difficult to be religious at
Swarthmore only appear to outnumber those who are
contented and grateful to have the opportunity to practice their religions and to be members of religious communities here. Perhaps the fear of being ostracized as
a result of one's religiosity is simply greater than the
reality. Maybe it's all just a lot of hype and, as evidenced by the many happy practitioners, it isn't so
hard to be religious at Swarthmore after all. Perhaps it
can even be rewarding.
If Religion and Spirituality Week can be such a big
deal at Swarthmore, it is conceivable that those suffer
as a result of their religion at Swarthmore simply constitute a very loud, though rather small, minority.

AfroLatin Week ended with a bang last Saturday at Olde
Redefining Afrolatinidad Spoken Word/Hip

Club with the

Hop night.
The event featured spoken word artist Oveous Maximus,
the Bryn Mawr feminist rap collective 3 X A Lady Crew,
Nicole Marie Lopez 'lO (BMC) and Swarthmore students Eva
McKend 11 and alum Miriam Okine 'O6. The event was
organized by Grace Kaissal 10 and McKend and sponsored
by cultural groups SASS, SOCA and Enlace.

"Spoken word is a form of

the events hosted during AfroLatin Week are centered
around the Afrolatin experience outside of the United
States." Kaissal and McKend wanted to host an event that
represented the Afrolatin communities in America.
"Spoken word is a form of expression that has long been
organize the performance because "we noticed that

the forum [through] which underrepresented communities
speak their mind and say what they have to say," Kaissal
said, "With the number of Afrolatinos, African Americans
and Latinos, especially young people, who use spoken word
as a means of political and cultural expression, we thought
this event would help shed light to that experience."
When choosing artists to perform at Redefining
Afrolatinidad, the organizers decided to feature local talent.
"We have so much hidden talent at this school and in our
neighboring schools that it's important to always tap into
that and provide an opportunity for students to showcase
that talent," Kaissal said, "They were all artists from our
very own communities who have a lot to say about the world
we're living in and are conscientious of their surroundings."

form "not simply because of his Afrolatino heritage and
amazing spoken word talent but also because a lot of his
work speaks directly to the experiences of many students in
the tri-college community."
McKend, a SASS board member, was asked by Kaissal to
perform one of her spoken word pieces. McKend performed
her original "Not Another Love Poem."
McKendfirst began performing as a junior in high school
because "there was a lot going [on] that I was seeing in the
media that I didn't like and inspired me to write."
"I wanted to give a voice to young black girls like myself
who were and are never given a fair shot, never an opportunity to be themselves or even seen as beautiful," McKend
said.

McKend called her performance on Saturday night an
'but of body experience at times" and said the she "felt really moved" at the show. "I knew the seriousness of my message going in and I could tell that the audience would be
receptive and engaged," McKend said, "There was a moment
where I forgot where I was and it just became about me talking about the absence of love. The message was so important...l just wanted everyone to be with me."
While McKend was hoping for "a little more of a call and
response feel" for her piece, she said that "the crowd was so

engaged. They were great."
The audience also enjoyed "Womyn Head High" from the
3 X A Lady Crew, Okine's work and Oveous' poem dedicated
to his future ex-girlfriend, which McKend deemed "beauti-

ful."

For Kaissal, the best part of the night came when she was
sitting on the stage "seeing everyone who came to the performance so in tuned with what all the performers were saying in their spoken word pieces and performances. I felt like
so many people were really taking it all in."
After the performance, the organizers held a panel with
all the artists during which students received the opportunity to ask performers about their work. According to
Kaissal, topics of discussion ranged from "the power of spoken word and poetry for underrepresented or disempowered
youth" to "ways to [be] more critical of mainstream culture."
After all their hard work, both organizers consider the
event a success.
"I really just wanted a good number of people from the
tri-college community to come through and really enjoy but
more importantly listen to the powerful messages being conveyed by all the artists performing and on the panel,"
Kaissal said.

without knowing anything about the candidates or the issues at

willingness to research
candidates' voting pat-

terns, stances on policies
and their abilities to
lead.
So,

if for whatever
reason you find yourself unable to pick a candidate based on
merit, their values, or attractiveness (I miss you, John
Edwards) then fret not. There are other factors you can take
into consideration that take less time and effort to examine,
such as music choice.
You can tell a lot about people by what they listen to, and
even more by what they put on their campaign soundtrack
for the nation to hear. The three remaining front-runners
have selected a variety of songs that excite their supporters
and serve as a personal bond between the politician and the
people. Their music choice should set them apart from the

other candidates and unite their supporters.
Let us examine the musical selections of leading
Republican candidate, Senator John McCain. While campaigning in South Carolina last April, McCain displayed his
aptitude for lyric interpretation and commendable music
taste by alluding to "Barbara Ann." When asked what his
stance was on a preemptive strike against Iran, McCain wittily responded, "Remember that old Beach Boys' song, Bomb
Iran? Bomb-bomb-bomb..." Although this response lacked
sensitivity, it demonstrated that not only does McCain
admirably listen to upbeat, classic American rock and roll,
but also demonstrates McCain's willingness to lay the smack
down. After John Edwards dropped out of the presidential
race, McCain began using Edwards' campaign tune, "Our
Country" by John Mellencamp. His supporters united to
angrily respond to criticism that his creative individuality is
faltering by claiming that it's only fair that McCain took
Edwards' song since Clinton and Obama took his ideas.
Senator Hillary Clinton has also used music to excite her
supporters. In mid-2007 Clinton posted a video on the
Internet urging her supporters to vote for her campaign song
from a list that included songs by U2, the Temptations, the

Staples Singers and others. Tens of thousands of people
watched her online video spoof of "The Sopranos" finale,
waiting in great anticipation to discover what song would
power Clinton's campaign. Eventually Celine Dion's love
ballad pulled through, and "You and I" became Clinton's
campaign song. But what can we interpret this dedication to
the people to mean?
Does Clintonhave a really good sense of humor? Or does
it simply mean her support comes from forty year olds who
jam out to easy listening and pine away for "My Heart Will

History Month events. I had no good answer.
As a former Editor in Chief of the paper, I have
to take my share of the responsibility for these
problems. Look no further than the top job at the
paper to see the issue at hand. The last African
American editor graduated in 1993. During this
period, it has been rare for editors and writers of
color to stay with the paper for longer than a semester or two, particularly if we look at blacks and
Latinos.
This fact should put to rest any notion that the
Phoenix is an institution of equal opportunity or a
representative student voice for minority groups.
In fact, the paper is not representative of anyone,
not just of minorities. It struggles to hire enough
staff, and ends up promoting people to top editorial
positions probably before it would be ideal. Other
organizations on campus suffer from similar problems, and the effects of premature burnout mean
that seniors rarely hold top leadership positions,
with Student Council as a notable exception.
Attributing the paper's diversity problems to a
mere lack of talent would be naive. As the heated
exchanges over last year's SC presidential election
lay bare, some minority students are apprehensive
about the operations of the most important studentrun institutions. The Phoenix is particularly susceptible to these perceptions, as its hiring process is

20

opaque, its production closed off in its Parrish top
floor office, and its editorial board inclusive offew
students of color. The supposed closed nature of the
paper is such that I cannot count how many times I
have heard other students wonder if the administration oversees its production (this is not the case).

Many students plainly do not trust The Phoenix.
A misspelled name or wrongly attributed photo, (let
alone a factual error or shoddy writing) engenders
deep-seated mistrust of the paper for years. This
mistrust is magnified among minority students
who may already feel marginalized by the general
apparatus of student governance.
In discussions withformer and current Phoenix
editors on the issue, I am convinced that they
desire to have a more diverse staff and editorial
board. This must become the number one priority
for the paper. To comprehensively report on the
concerns and interests of students that is, for the
its staff needs to represent
paper to be relevant
the make-up of the student body, whether we break
this down by ethnic, ideological or socio-economic

lines.
In its upcoming hiring process in late April, the
paper should actively recruit among the cultural
groups, much like SC did in advance of its fireside
chat on planning committees held yesterday.
Editors should work with multicultural deans Tim
Sams, Darryl Smaw and Rafael Zapata to develop

strategies for both recruiting more minority applicants and ensuring that these applicants are given
the proper opportunities to develop their writing
and editing talents. The paper also needs to avoid
tokenization. Some columns written by minority
writers in the recent past focused on issues specific
to the writer's ethnicity. Such voices are welcome,
but minority writers need not be confined to the
topic of their difference.
Some might cast this column as shameless
white guilt. After three years on the editorial board,
maybe my current year on the outside gives me the
added perspective to advocate for this change more
forcefully than I did while on the paper. But this is
no mere mea culpa. Nor am I under any illusions
that I have presented all the answers. All relevant
parties must solve this problem by coming together
to right the missteps of the past and strengthen this
institution. Substantial integration of the Phoenix
is long overdue.

Go On"? It was merely days after news spread of her song
selection that many ofher supporters protested the choice in
online polls and blogs. It's commendable that Clinton sincerely attempted to include her supporters in her campaign,
but picking Celine Dion over the Temptations and U2 ultimately caused a rift with her supporters.
Initially, Senator Barack Obama chose to defy the norm

and walked on and off at his first campaign event without
any music cues. But with all the music hype from Clinton's
campaign, Obama supporters began to brainstorm ideas for
his campaign song. Some very unique videos began to
appear on YouTube, with Obama supporters belting out "I've
got a crush on Obama," promptly followed by "She's got a
crush on Obama" and "Open letter to Obama."
Obama eventually decided to use something more listenable, and chose U2's "City of Blinding Lights," which won
Best Rock Song at the 2006 Grammys. This is a significant
step up from McCain's offensive sampling of the Beach Boys,
and displays Obama's ability to take control of a situation,
unlike Clinton's diplomatic submission to a sappy love song.
Ultimately, this article is just a cynical approach to the
ridiculousness that ensues when We the People decide to
vote without checking the facts. It would be a dishonor to
yourself and your country to vote for a candidate solely
based on gender, race, physical appearance or partisanship.
Get to know your candidates (obviously not just their
favorite songs). If you are going to partake in a decision that
will affect this nation and the world, take the time to learn
who the candidates are, and what they support. And don't
forget, always do the right thing.

Drug policy enforcement
Almost three weeks ago, a male
student left Swarthmore's campus
for the semester. He took a leave of
absence, following a meeting with
the Dean's Office, surrounded by
allegations of his possession of illegal substances. According to the
student, his alleged possession of an
illegal substance was discovered
when officials from the Dean's
Office entered his room. The officials went into his refrigerator,
where they discovered the allegedly

illegal substances, according to the
student. Since the discovery, other

the Dean's Office in this case are a
rare occurrence for this campus.
The Dean's Office obviously has
good intentions when pursuing a
substance user. Nonetheless, we
are surprised by the way in which
the Dean's Office chose to pursue a
remedy to this case; the Dean's
Office felt it "important, necessary
and right" to turn over the discovered materials to the Swarthmore
Borough Police, though is still gathering information to try to understand the situation. It is unclear as
to whether or not there will be CJC

linked

to the initial discovery.

While some details of the case are
not entirely clear due to privacy
issues, the initial incident raises
several important issues for students.
We are concerned by student use
of hard drugs on this campus. We
recognize, in the words of Associate
Dean for Academic Affairs Garikai
Campbell '9O, that "the possession
and use of illegal drugs has the
potential to invoke disruptive and
unsafe behaviors, invite dangerous
visitors, interrupt other students'
ability to work, endanger the health
of the users, negatively affect the
lives of those in the broader community to which the College
belongs and introduce any of a

number of other stresses to the
environment." We also recognize
the position in which the Dean's
Office finds itself, as risking negligence by not taking any actions and
being morally bound to occasionally intervene in student affairs.
It is clear that many college students use drugs and that the harms
of drug use outweigh the benefits,
but it seems to us that the actions of

According to page 122 of the stu-

dent handbook, "Any dean may
enter and inspect a residence hall
room without the resident's consent
if there is a reason to believe that
any College regulation is being or
has been violated." We suspect that
some students are not aware of this
policy and recommend that students become better acquainted
with the official policies of the col-

lege.
The actions of the Dean's Office

should serve as a warning to students engaging in dangerous behavior and putting their roommates
and friends at risk. Students must
be aware of their rights and respon-

sibilities, along with the activities
their friends and especially roommates partake in. As a result, students in a shared living arrangement, especially those who are nec-

essarily placed in shared arrangements in their first year, must take
on increased responsibility of the
possessions kept in their "personal"
spaces if they suspect that all is not
well. It is important to be assertive
about your living space, and if you
need to go to the Deans, do so.

Al Qaeda might be justified to attack

Aww-right, tawk amungst yaselves cuz I'm feeling

Seriously, though, not to feed into "war on terror"
hype, but it's a scary thought, and it hits close to
home for some of us job-seekers of the hope-to-beNew-Yorker variety. One BBC retrospective on 9/11
that I read gave the response of one man who,
although afraid, deplored the plans of these "murderers" as morally bankrupt. This statement got me
thinking, though, about these sorts of reactions. It
struck me as so self-righteous, especially in light of
current and past U.S. actions, the kind that have contributed to the rise of blowbacks like 9/1 L Hadn't we,
after all, heard the same charges of moral depravity
from countless Vietnamese families affected by the
My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War? Haven't
Iraqis, more recently, decried Americans as imperial

murderers for the shameful actions of American soldiers at Haditha?

These examples, of course, are of actions not
expressly ordered or condoned by our government.
Still there is a host of morally inconvenient, direct
actions by our government: namely, our involvement

with nefarious elements around the world, which is a
well-documented historical trend. Remember, for
example, our Saudi-coordinated and widely cited collusion with Osama bin Laden back in the 1980s, when
he was waging a terrorist campaign to oust Soviet
occupiers from Afghanistan? (Or wait, was it freedom fighting back then?)
And how about the U.S. government's consistent
failure to obtain a democratically vetted mandate for
many of its military and political actions abroad?
Saying that our government acts in the national interest—that is, the interest of its people—is about the
only way to render this question as a moral one.
Unfortunately, though, this way of thinking doesn't
lead to clear answers either. Our leaders, you see,
have consistently undertaken violent actions without
obtaining the constitutionally mandated consent of
the people, which, pursuant to the constitution,
means a declaration of war from the Congress, or by
looser standards of democracy, the widespread, sustained support of the people. The national will was

op-art by mere d i th lei c

hj

never mobilized in support of the Vietnam War, and
yet the U.S. maintained a presence in the region for a
decade. Neither was it mobilized for various interventions in Central and South America or the humanitarian interventions of the 19905.
In a democracy, the will of the people is foundational to the state's legitimacy—the national will is
"the moral factor," if you will—and so the lack of formal mandates for U.S. military actions is a crucial
determinant of the relative morality of the United
States' violent political actions. Without the support
of the people, in fact, the United States' violent political actions are little more than elites acting in what
they conceive to be the nation's best interests. A
small group of elites acting in the name and on behalf
of a large, non-consensual mass of people—sound
familiar? That's exactly how al Qaeda is dismissed
when it claims to act on the behalf of, say, Iraqis, but
that is exactly how I conceive of the Bush administration's misguided foray into Iraq.

In pointing out these moral ambiguities, my intent
is not to equivocate endlessly. Rather, I am simply
attempting to illustrate the nebulous moral distinc-

tions between the United States' violent actions and
those of an al Qaeda cell. From a strictly moral perspective, I am emphasizing just how immoral, or
more appropriately, amoral any violent action is,
regardless of the perpetrator. Simply put, perhaps the
moral question is not the right question to ask when
considering al Qaeda, the United States and issues of
political violence terrorist- or state-perpetrated.
So with all of this said, is Al Qaeda morally justified in attacking an American city with a nuclear
bomb? In a word, yes. Not to be mistaken, I believe
that killing innocent civilians is morally wrong, and
that more generally, killing is just plain wrong. As
with any supposedly democratic state actor, though, I
would expect that terrorist cells operate opportunisti-

cally and strategically to achieve their objectives.
Morality may be the talk on both sides, but that doesn't mean that either side walks the walk. Rather, the
walk is a decidedly brutal dance of power, which
leaves no question as to the amoral nature of the
game: All's fair in war and war. As much as I hope
that a nuclear attack doesn't happen, I am loathe to
cast stones so quickly and smugly when, from someone else's perspective, there is just as much blood on
my hands as anyone else's. Perhaps I've just come to
accept the fact that I will be held responsible for the
government that purports to represent me.
I cried when I got home from school on September
11, watching the towers fall over and over again on
TV. I was afraid and helpless, and of course, angry.
But now, I feel ashamed of those selfish tears, and the
next time around, I don'tknow exactly how I'll react.
If I cry nowadays, there are still some selfish tears,
but there are a lot for the people who die by my complicity. I can indict people as murderers all I want, so
long as I save some moralistic vitriol for me and
mine, but I should probably stick to serious selfreflection—and leave the moralizing to the hypocrites
I elect to do my dirty work.

Stop using 'retarded'
Everyday at Swarthmore, I hear the use of the word Retarded' in
casual conversations to describe something that frustrates or annoys
the speaker. On a campus that prides itself on being politically correct
and sensitive, this is the height of hypocrisy. The use of this word is
extremely demeaning and offending to a group of people that may not
be able to defend themselves quite as readily as other groups.

"Pleading that you didn't mean to offend
or intellectually disabled
people and that you are just using the
word to describe something that is
stupid,' is not acceptable."
Pleading that you didn't mean to offend
or intellectually disabled people and that you are just using the word to
describe something that is 'stupid,' is not acceptable. Just like calling
something "gay," the use of the word 'retarded' in this context demonstrates a lack of sensitivity and is offensive to many people. It is somewhat alarming to me that so many people at Swarthmore use this
word - I thought the student body was suppose to be independent
thinkers. Instead, it looks likes people's political correctness is a function of doing what is popular. I am aware that most people on campus
probably don't intend to offend developmentally or intellectually disabled people, but in reality they are, and I, and many others, would
appreciate it if they would stop.

cess.

Unfortunately, the African Cup of Nations
coincides with the regular season of many of
Europe's domestic football leagues. Many club
managers, prior to the tournament, complained
about the conflict, explaining that the interruption could weaken team chemistry. This might
be a fair point, considering many African players have cemented themselves as regular
starters for their respective clubs, most notably
at Chelsea and Arsenal, and their "exodus" could
adversely affect performances. Some of these
managers even went as far as suggesting the
competition be rescheduled to the summer.
I find this slightly ignorant. First, they're disregarding the importance of the cup. The ANC
was first held over 50 years ago and is Africa's
main football competition. With so many good
and emerging football playing countries on the
continent, there must be so much passion and
pride associated with winning the cup.
Managers in Europe should be able to
empathize, as I'm sure they'll be fanatically
cheering on their respective teams at this summer's upcoming European Championships.
Second, they're ignoring the will of their own
players. Most players eagerly anticipate the
tournament and dream of wearing their country's colors. The prospective mouthwatering
rivalries between Nigeria and Cameroon or
Egypt and Tunisia would entertain all football
fans. Finally, to hear Arsene Wenger and Avram
Grant, managers of Arsenal and Chelsea FC
respectively, bicker about losing their star players, is going lower than low. With the amount of
talent at their disposal and depth of their bench,
the behavior of these coaches truly seems infan-

tile.

Looking at the results, it doesn't seem as if
the clubs' performances were affected. Arsenal
won all their EPL games from Jan. 20 to Feb. 10,
the duration of the tournament, with Chelsea
piling up impressive results with three wins and
two draws against Liverpool and Portsmouth,
another team that, despite having many players
at the tournament, won most of its games. In
December, Grant stated that he might purchase
a couple more players to cover for the loss of key
players. That is totally unnecessary as his bench
has enough quality to field a competitive lineup,
and the players are only gone for a month!
I believe the tournament can proceed successfully as it has and timing should not be an issue.
Unfortunately, there will be conflicts with schedules and it might only augment the club vs. country debate. But playing for your nation and carrying the hopes of your compatriots should be the
first priority for any professional athlete.

The women's team (6-4, 4-2 CC) faced
an uphill battle at Saturday's meet, with
several key swimmers sitting out the
event due to illness. After a tough fight,
the Garnet women succumbed to
112-93.
Dickenson (6-4, 4-2 CC)
"Competing with only 14 swimmers is

tough, even when all of them are healthy.

When one is throwing up and the others
are battling colds it is extremely difficult," Anne Miller 'lO said.
Extenuating circumstances aside,
the Women's team began the meet with

an important victory in the 400-yard
medley relay by Allie Jordan 'O9,
Stephanie Su 'll, Jennie Lewis 'OB and
Chelsea Brett 'IL "Starting meets with a
win in the 400 medley relay is always a
huge adrenaline rush. Relays are a lot of
fun and a lot of pressure. It's a perfect
combination for success," Jordan said.

Miller quickly racked up three wins
in the 1000-yard freestyle, the 200-yard
butterfly and the 500-yard freestyle. For
the second week in a row, the Garnet

swept the first three places in the 200yard butterfly.

The team was impaired by a number
of adverse circumstances going into
Saturday's meet, but Miller said that all
successful athletes learn to compete in
the face of substantial challenges.
"Dealing with those circumstances is
part of being involved in sports, but we
will deal with it, move on and hopefully
destroy Dickinson at Conferences,"
Miller said. Ever resilient, the women's
team is already looking forward.
"Right now, the focus is on getting
healthy and rested, and when that happens we'll be ready to go again," Jordan
said.
The men's team found the majority of

its points in 1-2 finishes in the 1000-yard
freestyle, the 200-yard freestyle, and the
200-yard individual medley, as well as a
1-2-3 sweep in the 500-yard freestyle.
Crucial contributions came from

Stephen Shymon 'O9 (1000, 500-yard
freestyle) and Sterling Satterfield 'll,
(200-yard individual medley, 200-yard
butterfly). "After the 1000 free I was pretty tired, but there was no way in hell I
was going to let [Andrew] Frampton win
the 500 free after what he said in the
Phoenix last week," Shymon said.
Despite his competitive spirit,
Satterfield said that swimming is by
nature an individual sport. "Swimmers
are always told, 'lt is just you in the
water,'" Satterfield said. "However, with
Swarthmore, it doesn't feel that way.
The team's support and camaraderie are
undeniable. We are way more than just
a team
we are a family," he said.
Both men's and women's swimming
wrapped up their regular seasons with

a final meet in Chestertown, Maryland
against
Washington
College
on
Wednesday, although results were not
available at the time of publication.
Prior to the Washington, the men's
team was optimistic about the likelihood of rounding out the season with
another win.
Members of the women's team said
they were anticipating a tough, but
winnable meet. "I think that besides
being able to do it, we want to do it,
which can make all the difference,"
Jordan said.
With conferences less than two
weeks away, the men's team was feeling
confident. "We are coming off of big
wins and have a higher level of confidence, energy and intensity than in the
beginning of the season," Satterfield

said.

"Relays are a lot of fun
and a lot of pressure. It's
a perfect combination
for success."
Allie Jordan 'O9
"Everyone has been training exceptionally well since training trip and I
think we are all anxious to swim at conferences," Shymon said.
The women's team expects that talent and camaraderie will serve them
well at the Centennial Conference
Championships. "We're going to be
there for one another through all three
days no matter what happens and I

think because of that, we can be sure
that big things are going to happen,"
Jordan said.

SPORTS IN BRIEF
In spite of mixed season, men's basketball team aims to finish strong
Men's Basketball (5-16 overall, 113 CC) lost a close and exciting
match to Dickinson in overtime this

past Saturday. Dickinson overcame a
29-point spree by Senior lan
McCormick, 12by Matt Allen 'lO, and
11 by Sam Lacy 11 to triumph 74-69.
The volatile game saw 6 ties and
13 lead changes. Swarthmore led 3331 at intermission, but Dickinson
closed the regular game with a 12-0
ultimately
streak,
and
beat
Swarthmore 12-7 in overtime.
The game took place during the
Women's
Basketball
Coaches
Association's <WBCA) "Think Pink"
Week of February 6-17, an initiative
that aims to spread breast cancer
awareness across college campuses
and communities. The men's team
joined the women's team in solidarity, suiting up in pink shirts to show
their support and donating all concession stand earnings to promote
breast cancer research.
Although the players acknowledged that the season has been a
rocky one, the team's record does not
necessarily reflect the closeness of
the games, according to Matt Turner

'lO. Turner said that the team has
been working to stay optimistic in
spite of "losing a lot of close games
by an average of two points."
Sam Lacy 'll said he was frustrated by the losses, but convinced that
therecord does not reflect the team's
true capabilities. "The narrow margins show that Swarthmore can beat
anyone," Lacy said.
Injuries have also been a strain
on the team's performance this season. Turner and Lacy are among
those who have taken time out to
recover at different points in the season. "Because of these injuries, it's
been hard to get into a steady rotation," Turner said.
In spite of the team's mixed
record, several individuals have
been recognized for outstanding performances this year. On Feb. 5,
Center lan McCormick was honored
by the Sam Cozen Player of the Week
by the Philadelphia-Area Small
College Coaches Association. He
received the award at a bi-weekly
luncheon at the University of the
Sciences in Philadelphia.
The senior economics major has

started 19 games this season, and has
averaged 23.7 points, 11.7 rebounds,
3.4 blocks and 2.7 assists in the seven
games leading up to receiving the
award. McCormick has played in 93
games at Swarthmore, starting in 83.
He holds the school record for career
blocks (180) and blocks in a season
(58).

This week, he was named to
the Magazine's Academic AllDistrict II second team for men's basketball.
Turner
said
that
McCormick's contribution to the
team has been phenomenal throughout the season. "Lan [McCormick]
has been pretty much our savior this
ESPN

year," Turner said.

Steve Wolf 'lO has also stacked up
some substantial accomplishments
this season. In a recent match
against Philadelphia Biblical, Wolf
led the Garnet with 16 points and 10
rebounds for his fourth double-double of the season.
The team faced Muhlenberg on
Wednesday night, but results were
not available at the time of publication.

BY SETH

GREEN
sgreenl@swarthmore.edu

By any standard, first-year basketball star Kathryn
Stockbower 'll is having an outstanding season. The sixfoot tall forward from Fort Washington, Pa., leads the
team in points and rebounds and was recently profiled in
the Philadelphia Daily News. She was named Centennial
Conference women's basketball Player of the Week on
Feb. 4, following a two-game week in which she averaged
14.5 points and 19 rebounds. Her 21 rebounds in a game
against Haverford were the third highest in school history. Seth Green sat down with Kathryn to get the rookie
standout's take on college life and the rigors of varsity

athletics.
SG: How long have you been playing basketball? What
was your basketball experience before college?
KS: I played AAU basketball for a few years, as well as
playing on my high school team for four years. My high
school league was pretty competitive, so I think it really

prepared to play at the collegiate level.
SG: What drew you to Swarthmore? Where you in touch

with the coach beforehand?
KS: I was drawn to Swarthmore for quite a few reasons
the highly academic but non-competitive atmosphere,
the diverse student body, the small class sizes, as well as
the beautiful campus. Yes, I was in touch with the coach
before coming. I really liked Coach DeVarney and the girls
on the basketball team, so that was another factor in my
decision to come to Swarthmore.
SG: How has the season been going?
KS: This season has been kind of tough. We haven't won
very many games, which can be frustrating, but it has definitely been a learning experience. It has really forced us
...

to figure out what our weaknesses are and work on
improving them.
SG: What are your goals for basketball at Swarthmore?
KS: My goal for this season [which is coming to a close]
is to pick up a few big wins. Next year, I would definitely
like to make the playoffs.
SG: What are your goals off the court?
KS: Off the court, I just want to do well in all of my

classes and learn a lot.
SG: What do you like about college?
KS: I like the time schedule at college. I used to have to
wake up at 6:30 in high school, and now my first class is
9:30.1 also really like choosing my own classes.
SG: Anything you miss about home?
KS: I miss my family (even my little sister), but fortunately my parents get to come to a lot of our basketball
games.

-

SG: Which teams do you root for?
KS: To be honest, I don't really follow the NBA or college basketball that closely. If the Sixers are playing, I'll
root for them, and if any local Philadelphia teams are playing in March Madness, I'll root for them.
SG: How did you feel about the Super Bowl?
KS: Well, I wasn't really rooting for one team or the
other, because I'm an Eagles fan. It would have been cool
for the Patriots to have a historic season, but I also like to
see the underdogs win.
SG: Do you have any advice to people looking to balance
sports and school?
KS: Playing a sport is a big time commitment, but it
really forces you to manage your time well and be as efficient as possible. I guess my advice would be, just try to
stick to a schedule and give yourself time limits to get
everything done.

'O9 ran a smoking 1:57.9 in the 800 meter
race. An indoor PR for Darby, this performance gives him the second best time
in the Centennial Conference this season.
Darby's race was also a joyful reunion
with Swat alumnus, teammate and friend
Matt Schiller 'O7.

"It was a brisk day,
the sun was shining, the
smell of gunpowder was
in the air, and we were
ready to rock."
Andrew Vanßuren 'ID
As Coach Pete Carroll said about the

rival, "They were battling, so
Connor ran a pretty solid race." While
Carroll was delighted with Darby's race,
he was also happy to see Schiller in such
fine form. "I wish he looked that good last
year at this time. He ran very well,"
Carroll said.
Schiller, who ran a 1:581, has been running for the Greater Boston Track Club
while he works as an economic consultant
in Boston. The 2007 indoor Conference
champion in the 400 meter dash, Schiller
said that running with the GBTC, which
includes prior All-Americans and top
Division I athletes as well as other post-

friendly

collegiate runners, has been a great experience.
After the race, Schiller, whose life is no
longer consumed by seminars, late-night
studying and problem sets, gave a few
members of the track team a rundown on
is like

what running life
Swarthmore. "I actually have a ton more
time to train now, because I get off of work
at six and then I'm free to run," he said.
On Monday a small but mighty group
of Swarthmore men competed in the
Haverford Quad Meet. As Andrew
Vanßuren 'lO said, "It was a brisk day,
the sun was shining, the smell of gunpowder was in the air, and we were ready
to rock."

Yongjun Heo 'O9 sprinted to a top ten
finish in both the 55m and 200 m dashes.
Dan Kurz 'll continued to roll, clocking a
54.33 in the 400, a time good enough to
qualify for the Centennial Conference
Championships. Seth Green 'lO and Chris
Mayer-Bacon 'll competed in the 400 as
well, posting times of 56.56 and 58.43

respectively.
Destroying his heat of the 800m,
Vanßuren also ran a Conference qualifying time of 2:09. Teammate Ernesto
Manzo 'll ran a 2:12 to complete
Swarthmore's showing in the 800. Chris
Sawyer 'lO represented the distance men
with a time of 10:13 in the 3000. Tommy
Huang 'lO and Brendan McVeigh 'll both
competed in the pole vault, with McVeigh
clearing a height of 10 feet. Huang also
competed in the shot put along with teammate Neel Prakash 'O9, who with great
force and willpower set another PR in the
onerous event.
Despite some illness, the team marches on. "The flu has hit us hard. Hopefully
we'll have a good showing on the 22nd,
and get some more people qualified for
Conferences," Coach Pete Carroll said.

Men's track will next compete on Feb.
22 at the Keogh Invite at Haverford
College.

Unfortunately for the Swarthmore
women's indoor track and field team, the
indoor season coincides with another
high-profile season: cold and flu season.
Despite competing with a thinned-out roster for the second time in as many weeks,
a small contingent of Garnet women still
managed to churn out some respectable
performances at the Haverford Quad
Meet, evidence that they are able to do a
lot with relatively little.
In a solid display of versatility,
Nathalie De Gaiffier 'lO took to both the
track and the runway, sprinting the 200
meter dash in 32.80 seconds while longjumping 3.98 meters, the second mark just
a hair away from a conference qualifier.
Nyika Corbett 'lO ran a solid race in the
800 meters, coming from behind on the
last lap to place fourth while clocking a
2:26.37, easily eclipsing the conference
qualifying mark of 2:38.83.
Additionally, a trio of Garnet women
all put up solid conference qualifying
marks in the 3000 meters. Caitlin Russell
11, Ashley Davies 10 and Rebecca Woo 11
all dipped under the conference standard
of 11:37.30, running 11:23.39, 11:26.08 and
11:35.84 respectively.
Acknowledging the challenges facing
the Garnet squad at Haverford, Woo said,
"A lot of girls got sick and some people
didn't compete because of Boston.
Considering that there weren't a lot of
people out there, I thought we had a
strong performance." Additionally, Woo
was excited about her conference qualifier, a mark she had missed by a narrow
margin the week before.
In describing the differences between
her race a week ago and on Monday, Woo
said "Last race I didn't have anyone to
run with, so this race it was cool to have
teammates in the 3K with me to warm up
with and support me."

While the aforementioned Garnet
women were busy torching the track at
Haverford, Bess Ritter 'O9 was holding
down the fort over 300 miles away at the
Boston University Valentine Invitational.
Ritter faced stiff competition from all three
NCAA divisions to set a personal record in
the 3000 meters, pacing herself to a time of
10:54.67. The meet at Boston is typically a
very selective one on Swarthmore's part,
and Ritter was more than happy to represent the team. "The atmosphere running at
getting the chance
BU was really great
to race against so many athletes and
watching the elite races," Ritter said. "It
was a great opportunity and a chance to
measure fitness going into the last couple
of weeks before Conferences."

"Considering that there
weren't a lot of people out
there, I thought we had a
strong performance."
Rebecca Woo 'll
In spite of the fact that she was numerous hours away, Ritter's accomplishment
did not go unnoticed. Melina Healey 'OB
extolled Ritter's virtues. "Bess Ritter is a
workhorse and her determination paid off
in a big race this weekend," she said.
Additionally, Healey shed some light on
the allure of indoor track. "Indoor track is
my favorite season. We run in the dark
and go exploring at moonlit golf courses,
and the rhythm of a 200 meter track is
spectacular," she said. "I can't wait to
race again!"
The Garnet women will next be in
action on Friday, Feb. 22, when action
begins at 4:00 p.m. from the Keogh Invite
at Haverford College.

Basketball subdues Owls in overtime win
The Garnet women send Bryn Mawr packing after a fierce rally in overtime, but fall to top-ranked Dickinson
BY LAUREN WALKER

lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu

Last
Tuesday,
the Swarthmore
Women's Basketball team took down TriCollege rival Bryn Mawr in an exciting
overtime victory at home in Tarble
Pavilion. The 68-62 win brings the team to
a 6-13 overall record, and 3-10 in the
Centennial Conference.
The Garnet started out strong, jumping out in front quickly with an 8-2 lead.
Kathryn Stockbower 'll once again took
charge, tallying six of Swarthmore's first

eight points.

The Garnet maintained the lead for the

majority of the first half, extending their
lead to nine points with about ten minutes
to go. With 5:36 left on the clock, a threepointer from the Owls made it a one point
game, but Swarthmore solidified their
lead to finish the half ahead of Bryn
Mawr, 34-30.

"Dickinson is known for
their suffocating press
defense and finally by the
end of the game that's
what wore us out."

coach

At the start of the second half,
Stockbower again got Swarthmore started
with a few points, extending the Garnet
lead to 38-30. The Owls, however, responded fast with 12 unanswered points. With 11
minutes remaining, Bryn Mawr had
taken a 42-38 lead.
The Swarthmore women, however,

maintained their composure and were
able to slow down the Owls' momentum,
forcing the game back into their control
as the action went back and forth. With
about three minutes to go, the Garnet
reclaimed the lead with two foul shots
from captain Karen Berk 'OB, notching the
score to 54-52.
The Owls struck back, as junior
Jessica Allen tied it up, sinking a jump
shot. With 38 seconds left and possession
of the ball, Bryn Mawr called a time out in
hopes of setting up the winning basket,
but they missed the shot, sending the
game into overtime.
Mirroring their strong starts to both
halves, Swarthmore came into overtime
with purpose. "I think we were all very
relieved after the end of regulation after
Bryn Mawr had a chance to score and win
in regulation and didn't," captain Pam
Costello 'lO said.
"This helped us going into overtime,
and we really came out strong. At that
point, we knew we were the better team,
and that we had to step up to come out
with
the
victory,"
Costello said.
Swarthmore indeed stepped up to the
challenge, scoring 16 points in the overtime period and defeating Bryn Mawr, 6862.
The game brought yet another impressive performance from Stockbower, as she
captured her 16th double-double with 22
points and 18 rebounds.

Berk also scored in the double digits,
notching 17 points and going 5-for-6 from
the foul line, and Costello tallied 10 points
of her own, while also bringing down six
rebounds.
The Swarthmore women hoped to
carry momentum from this exciting victory into their Saturday home match-up
against Dickinson College. The Red
Devils (14-6, 12-2 CC) were ranked first in
the conference coming into the game.
With this in mind, the Garnet approached
the competition knowing that it would be

a tough battle, but staying positive
nonetheless.

Dickinson started strong, establishing
an initial lead with an immediate 11-3
run, but Swarthmore fought back. Despite
the strength of the Red Devils' full court
pressure, the Garnet pounded out an
unanswered nine point run of their own,
taking their first lead, with 7:40 left in the
half.
Dickinson reclaimed the lead, but
Swarthmore kept the fight close, and the
halftime buzzer rang to reveal only a sixpoint margin between the teams.
Swarthmore got a speedy jump on the
Devils at the beginning of the second half,
tying the score at 36, but Dickinson
responded with an 18-4 run, and continued to extend their lead. In spite of the
Garnet's continued efforts, the Devils
maintained the lead to the final buzzer,
claiming the victory, 70-55.
Despite the loss, the game was a wellplayed, hard fight for the Garnet according to Stockbower, who posted her
Centennial-leading 17th double-double
during the game. "We had a pretty competitive game with Dickinson even
though the score did not really reflect
that," Stockbower said.
"The game showed us that, if we
believe in ourselves, we can compete with
anyone. Hopefully we will take this atti-

tude with us for our remaining games and
come out with a few wins," Stockbower
added.
Coach Renee DeVarney agreed that it
was a good game for the Garnet.

"Dickinson was a tough, gritty game that
except for the outcome
I really
enjoyed," she said.
"We've had trouble playing well in
both halves of games. We played really
well in both halves. Dickinson is known
for their suffocating press defense and
finally by the end of the game that's what
wore us out," De Varney said.

But Swarthmore made Dickinson work
for the victory. "They usually don't need
to press for the whole game. They needed
to against us or they wouldn't have won
it, and Dickinson was dead tired after the
game," DeVarney said.
Stockbower registered a team-high 18
points and 11 rebounds. This puts her at
the top of the Conference in double-doubles. Berk also tallied in the double digits

with 11 points.
