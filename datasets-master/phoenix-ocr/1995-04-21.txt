ACLU President: Hate Speech
Codes "A Silencer on a Gun"
By Matt Hellman
Nadine Strossen, president of the
American CivilLiberties Union, addressed the College Monday night on
issues of hate speech and speech
codes. Strossen spoke out strongly
against speech codes, arguing that
they have the same effect as "a silencer on a gun; hate speech will still
be there, it will stiD do violence—you just won't hear it"
Strossen first pointed out that
speech codes infringe on individuals' rights to freedom of speech as
outlined in the First Amendment. She
argued that once we allow the government (or a school administration)
to censor any ideas it feels are harmful, then everyone's right to selfexpression is jeopardized.
While Strossen made itclear in her
speech that theACLU does not sanction hate speech targeted at specific
individuals, she said that the legal
system already punishes such activities as slander, so separate hate speech
laws are not needed.
Strossen went on to discuss some
of the problems that might occur
should the College adopt a speech
code. Her first concern was that addressing problems like homophobia,
racism, and sexism on campus would
notbe helpedby restricting the means
by which the college community
could discuss them.

Strossen remarked that the anger
surrounding these issues would not go away simply because radical views about themcould
not be expressed openly. Strossen
worried that under a campus speech
code, these extremist views instead
wouldbe taken underground, and that
there would be no meaningful way
for the college community to effectively address them.
Strossen offered as alternatives
severalmethodsfor dealing with controversial issues on campus that do
notresort to the implementation of a
speech code. She noted that many of
the problems that a community faces
which lead to hate speech are due
simply to ignorance. Strossen noted
thatbringing potentially antagonistic
groups together to engage in meaningful dialogue would lessen tension
on campus.
She also applauded the actions of
the College administration in response to various hate crimes perpetrated on campus in the past few
years as an effective way to let those
who would engage in hate speech
that the administration stands firmly
opposed to such behavior.
Strossen specifically cited Dean
Ngina Lythcott's letter to the college
community, written after an incident
of hate crime targeted at the homosexual community earlier this year,
as an appropriate and effective way
and division

of dealing with hate crime without
using a speech code.
Of course, Swarthmore is not the
only campus in America which has
had to deal with hate crimes, and the
ACLU has been involved in several
lawsuits around the country to repeal
speech codes. The ACLU has won
battles to rescind the codes at the
University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin, the University of
Connecticut and, just a few weeks
ago, at Stanford University.
Audience reaction to the talk was
quite favorable. Ben Kennedy '9B
remarked that "Strossen spoke extremely well and seemed very knowledgeable." He did feel, however, that
she did not address the benefits of a
speech code and the reasons a community might want to enact one. "In
a practical sense, people may be more
concerned with stopping visiblehate
speech than trying to eradicate its
roots, and a speech code can help
with that," he said.
Chris Fecko '9B said that he did
not usually find himself partial to
ACLU positions, but thathe was "impressed withMs. Strossen, and agreed
with most of her points."
Fecko added that, in his opinion,
the College should "provide an environment in which ideas, even controversial ones, can be discussed, and
that any hate speech code should be
constructed with that in mind."

After many rising sophomores
obtained rooms dishonestly during
junior room choosing Tuesday, the
Housing Committee called off sophomore room draw last night and gave
violators four days to turn themselves
in without penalty.
Rising juniors who admit by Monday that they helped rising sophomores chose rooms fraudulently will
be allowed to keep their rooms. The
rising sophomores involved will lose
their rooms and will re-pick during
sophomore room draw, which will
now take place Monday night.
At press time, three groups of violators had identified themselves to
Director of Housing Myrt Westphal.
"We strongly encourage any other
groups to follow in their example,"
the Housing Committeesaid in a statement released late last night.
Rooms left empty by violators will
not bereturned to the lottery. Instead,
they will be made available Jo members of the Class of 1997 whorequest
room changes.
Before sophomore room choosing,
over 130 rising sophomores had already obtained housing. Block assignments, which were announced
last week, accounted for 73 of those
students; the remaining 60 were
"pulled up" by membersof next year's
junior class.
While many rising sophomores
whochose early had genuineplans to
live with older friends, a Phoenix
investigation revealed thatat least 21
people in at least four dorms fraudulently picked rooms during junior or
senior room draw. Numerous other
attempts to circumvent the lottery
were investigated but could not be
verified.
For legal reasons, ThePhoenix cannot name or otherwise identify the
students involved.
Cheating took many forms. Some
students arranged "room switches,"
in which one member of a group of
rising juniors who wanted to live
together traded with one memberofa
group of rising sophomores who
wanted to live together so two rooms
could be chosen with junior numbers. The students planned to return
to their original groups in the fall.
In at least two cases, the rising
sophomores involved in switches paid
the juniors to participate. One group
paid a rising junior $4OO to choose a
highly desirable quad for them, while
another group paid $BOO for a similar
room.

SC Stops Chartering, Evaluates Constitution
By Jonathan Seitz
Although the semester is nearly at
its end, Student Council is addressing some of the most important issues of the year. The new Student
Council constitution has received
preliminary approval from the Student Council. Assuming no substantial objections are raised by the studentbody, SC will vote on the constitution this Sunday.
Also on Student Council's agenda
this Sunday is an examination of the
policies used in chartering student
organizations. The Council declared
a moratorium on new charters at a
meeting April 2nd.

The new constitution, according
to SC members, will not greatly
change the way the Council operates—it simply codifies existing procedures. The constitution will not
"define Student Council's role," and
it "won'treally change anything we
d0... though I agree we should have
one,"said SC member Mike Pan '97.
Member Margaret Cohen '96 commented that one particular benefit of
having the constitution will be to
allow new members to learn the procedures more quickly, instead ofhaving to "catch on" as their terms
progress. "It's good to finally get
some things on paper," she said.
The downside to writing the con-

stitution was that it sometimes took
away from other issues facing StudentCouncil. Pan, who last semester
chaired the committee charged with
drafting the constitution, wished that
issues such as communication between SC subcommittees couldhave
beenacted upon more than they were.
Seth Harvey '97, current chair of the
ConstitutionCommittee, said theconstitution was prepared in about six
weeks, and that the Council is "very
happy that [it] got this [the constitution] done this semester."
StudentCouncil is seeking stvdent
reaction and suggestions through
Sunday. A copy of the new constitution can be found on the Student

Council network server, on the SC
bulletin board, or by contacting

Harve^

A straw poll taken at a Student
Council meeting lastSunday showed
that the Council favored the Constitution by a margin of 8-4. A twothirds vote is needed for approval. "It
has the support of a large majority of
Council," said Harvey.
One sticking point on the new constitution, and also one of its most
important features, is anew stance on
charters for student groups. At the
April 2nd meeting, a groupfor women
conservatives on campus called
"Women in the Right" submitted
see council...page 2

Some people asked older students
who planned to live off-campus but
still had lottery numbers to choose
rooms for them. In return, they agreed
to pay the $5OO fines that the older
students would incur for abandoning
the rooms they chose.
Arising juniorwho participated in

switch said he saw nothing
"roommates" had done. "It's one of those
things where if you don't do it, you
get penalized because everyone else
is doing it," he said. "It's not like I'm
the first guy to do it. If nobody else
did it and I was the only one who did
a favorfor thesekids, I would think it
was wrong."
Sarah Azaransky '97, who will be
an RA in Wharton next year, tried to
a room

wrong with what he and his

stop a room-switch onTuesday night,

even though some students criticized
her actions. "I don't think it's about
being mean or being nice, it's about
things being done fairly," she explained. "People talk about how in
thereal world things are unfair. Well,
in thereal world, people are in jail for
things like that."
Both Westphal andAssistant Dean
Tedd Goundie, who is in charge of
the College judiciary system, said
that while they thought the cheating
was reprehensible, in most cases no
rules were broken, so the students
involved cannot be punished.
"I don't know of a policy we have
that[switches] would violate, butthat
isn't to say that I wouldn't like to
have a conversation with those
people," Goundie said Wednesday.
"I thinkbeing unethical does not necessarily mean it's illegal or
adjudicable."
College regulations prohibit the
outright sale of lottery numbers, and
impose fines of up to $5OO on students who choose rooms and then
live off-campus; there is no penalty,
other than a $lO charge for changing
a phone number, if two students trade
rooms.
However, Westphal does not have
to grant room-change requests. According to the Housing Committee
statement, "it is highly unlikely that
room switches will be approved."

Briefly
Noted
"No Matter What
You Say Or Do To
Me, I Will Still
Win Fellowships"
Numerous Swarthmore students
havereceived majornationalprizes
recently.
Both Ryan Bush '95, a Linguistics major, and Joanne Seo '95, a
Classical Languages major, were
awarded Andrew J. Mellon Fellowships in Humanistic Studies by
theWoodrowWilson NationalFellowship Foundation. Ninety-seven
winners were selected from a pool
of eight hundred applicants. Mellon

Fellows each receive as stipend of
$13,250 plus tuition and required
fees for their first year of graduate
school in the humanities.
Sydney Foster '97 won a $7OOO
Goldwater Scholarship, a federal
prize given to students who have
shown high achievement in mathematics, science, or engineering.
Five seniors have won Fulbright
Grants to travel and study in foreign countries. The awards pay
$12,000 towards graduate school
tuition, plus travel and book expenses. S warthmore' s winners are:
Benjamin Cook '95, who will work
as a teaching assistant in Korea;
Amy Hammock '95, who will be
involved in a women's studies
project in Mexico; Nicole Jassie
'95, who will study Women's Literature in theIvory Coast; Youngj ae
Lee '95, who will study philosophy in Korea; and Nader
Vossoughian '95, who will study
politics in Germany.

SC Debates
Constitution,
Charters
council...from page 1
its charter.Butbefore the groupcould
get a charter, discussion beg an on the
procedures for chartering groups. SC
ultimately voted to cease chartering
new groups until a consensus on
policy could be drafted.
The vote to place a moratorium on
new charters was close, with a 5-5 tie
vote followed by a second vote in
which the motion to stop chartering
was passed 6-5, Charter Chair Laura
Kozek '97 having changed her vote
from an abstention to a yes.
According toPan, a revote was not
out of order. "Either way, the moratorium would have happened," because, with the tie vote, no decision
woi'ldhave beenmade on theWomen
in the Right charter, putting a defacto
moratorium in place.
Student Council members' opinions on the moratorium varied.
Harvey, who is on the committee
charged with drafting a new chartering policy, said a review was needed
"because we really weren't clear on
what guidelines we used in chartering groups." The Council hopes to
resolve the issue as fast as possible,
but "we're also students," he said. SC
may include therevised charter policy
in the new constitution.
Some members expressed frustration at the timing of the moratorium.
"I think it was very wrong.... You
don't just close the door," said Pan.
Council member Margaret Cohen
felt that the moratorium was "sort of
ridiculous." A charter review is
needed, she said, due to "a surge" of
charter requests, but the moratorium
was not the best way to resolve the
issue, especially with respect to
Women in the Right. It "was not fair"
to them to turn the discussion of their
charter into a referendum on chartering as a whole, she said.

Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B could not

But that didn't stop Benson-Nicol

Joseph Goodman '97
Member at Large
Although Joseph Goodman '97
started his candidacy for Student
Council as a joke, that's not to say he
didn't have some serious reasons for
running: Goodman hopes to overhaul the chartering procedures. "I've

tried three times to charter a group,
and haven't been able to," said
Goodman, "and I think as long as it
doesn't blow something up, a group
should get chartered."
Goodman's view of the current
Student Council is pessimistic. "A
lot of the members are on power
trips," he said. "No one notices when
SC does something. SC has a negligible effect 0n... the student body."

that the voice of the students "is not
only heard but seriously considered
in decision-making" on issues ranging from weekly collections to read-

ing weeks to the recruitment of foreign students.

Uzonwanne expressed hope that
future elections would be more focused on "issues rather than populist
sloganeering." However, hebelieves
that the only way this change can
occur is if "Swatties become less
apathetic about politics on campus."
While Uzonwanne saidhis numerous campaign signs elicited"the wrath

The energetic campaigning that
on around campus irritated
Goodman. He claimed that "no one

concrete agenda. No one implements
an agenda. As for his own campaign:
"I put up threeposters. Then I ran out
of tape."
The newly-chosen Member at
Large holds unorthodox views on
several issues For example, he is
very interested in what powers Student Council has; without a constitution to limit Student Council's powers, he wonders if in his new postition
he can expel students. But many current StudentCouncil members would
agree with Goodman's belief that

unopposed for a seat on the Curriculum Committee, expressed concern
that the lack of student participation
in elections reflects students' poor

image of Student Council. "I believe
that the problem is that most do not
see a correlation between their lives
here on campus and the actions of
Student Council," he said.
Rubinstein hopes to improve relations between Student Council and
students by resolving some of the
Council's internal conflicts. He also
hopes that the Council will serve the
student body better next year.
One curricular issue he intends to
pursue is the need to maintain a balance between "traditional courses and
courses that deal with more contemporary issues," so that"neither takes
absolute precedent over the other."
Although Rubinstein did not need
to campaign since no one opposed
his candidacy, he still wished someone had run against him. In response
to recent discussion over whether
paper campaign signs are wasteful,
Rubinstein said that unless "people
are willing to argue that all events
should beannounced electronically,"
attacks on current modes of Student
Council campaigning are illogical.

Tony Cheesebrough '97, who has

Cheesebrough's specific plans are
to keep the "self-help" portion of

guarantee that student-body input is
received before new funding policies
are imposed on students, encourage
greater selectivity in the funding of
new programs, and work to ensure
that the College's Contingency and

Specs Enjoy Classes, Chat With Students
Next year, these people could be living in the Willets double you deserve.
By Erik Huneke
Did you miss your opportunity to
host prospective membersof theclass
of 1999 this Sunday night? Do you
wish you were a spec again? If so,
and even if not, here is a chance to
experience the adventures oftwo prospective first-year students, Ashwin
Rao of Hinckley, OH, and Alex
Dußee of Hamburg, PA, during
Swarthmore's pre-frosh weekend.
Rao and his father decided to give
themselves a tour of the campus instead of the standard spec tour. Rao
then met his host (me) at 3:57pm and
for the next half-hour asked me why
I chose to come to Swarthmore, how
big most classes are, and how intense
the academic workload is. He said,
"the assistant dean [of admissions]
who came to our [school] made it out
to be an extremelyvigorous academic
atmosphere where everyone stayed
in their rooms and studied."
This sentiment was echoed by
Dußee, whom we picked up at the
Admissions Office at 4:25 pm. "I
was slightly worried about coming

here next year," he said, "because I
wasn't sure if I would be prepared....[From what I have seen] it's
not such a competitive atmosphere;
it's OK if you don't know something."
At 5:30, they sampled Sharpies.
Rao "wasn't really surprised by the
foodbecause it was pretty much what
I expected. I thought it was better
than the food at most of the other
places I went."
Holly Quinn '97 joined in the meandering dinnerconversation at7:00,
then took Rao and Dußee on a walk
through the CrumWoods. They claim
that during their two hours in the
woods they were completely unaware
of the Dip of the Month taking place
in the Creek, opting instead to perch
atop a rock and converse.
After a night during which Rao
and Dußee slept while their host
worked on a seminar paper, they attended the continental breakfast in
the Admissions Office. Dußee was
particularly struck by Dean Ngina
Lythcott's speech, in which she advised that "choosing a college is more

than just an academic decision; you

have to choose it from your heart."
He found it both "weird and kind of

nice for an authority figure" to tell
him to follow his heart, since he was
not accustomed to doing this or having other people advise him to do so.
Dußee enjoyed the philosophy
class heattendedbecause "everyone's
opinion seemed to count.I was worried about what a friend told me about
S warthmore' s attitude towardpeople
with conservative views," but felt
that people were open-minded.
Rao sat in on a class entitled The

History of Manhood, 1750-1920,and
was interested in the notion that
"sports, specifically boxing, were
related to andreflected the [surrounding] society." He also attended Bio 2,
which he "really enjoyed, maybe because I'm a science buff." He did,
however, notice that some members
of the class fell asleep.
Dußee has already decided to attend Swarthmore; he"just came down
here to become more familiar with
the campus." Rao is still trying to
choose between Swarthmore, Duke

University and the University of
Pennsylvania.

Reflecting on his time on campus,
Rao noted, "People here are really
friendly, easy to meet and get along
with; at other places [along the East
Coast] people tend to more standoffish." In most respects, "it seems like
most of the other places I've visited,
but smaller and more intimate."
Dußee agreed that everyone he
met was "extremely friendly and extremely helpful." He found "the
Quaker tradition of getting together
and discussing everything to make
sure that we understand repercussions of anything we say" appealing.
He added, "I'mhomosexual andl felt
that I would be comfortable here"
because of a more liberal student
body than thoseof thepredominantly
Christian schools he has attended in
the past. He said,"Even ifI choose to
be conservative and Christianlater in
life, I don't have to be forced into it
and surrounded by people who are
totally set in their expectations on
life. Swarthmore seems to promote
that type of thinking."

Earthlust
To the Editor:

Happy Earth Week! As a member
of the campus environmental group
Earthlust, I'd like to take a moment
outof organizing Earth Day events to
describe how SAC has mistreated
Earthlust over the past semester.
SAC's all-consuming desire to bring
Widespread Panic to Swat is costing
$ 15,000studentdollars (keep in mind
that not all students will be able or
will want to see this band) and using
up a lot of other resources, such as
timeand space. Although we planned
and notified SAC that we were going
tohold amellow, informational"ecocoffeehouse" on Parrish lawn in late
January, they decided they could
schedule Widespread Panic right over
us. In addition, they scheduled the
Spring Formal right over a planned
reggae concert for which we had already begun to request funding and
space. We had to cancel that and
move our coffeehouse down to the
bottom of Parrish beach.
SAC also scaled back the money
they planned to give us for our other
all-campus events (refreshments after our speaker on Thursday, etc.)
because they had no money left.Then
they told us last week, after we had

for "security reasons" and because
the band will be creating so much
noise all day.
OK, so we'removing our schedule
around. When we cancel events, we
come up with new ones. We try to be
flexible, and we try not to take a
holier-than-thou attitude that eel-

SAC thinks valuefree entertainment
is more important
than consciousnessraising and political

action. Perhaps
others do too.
ebrating the 25th anniversary of the

dead because we haven't organized
any huge events for Earth Day 25.
I'll admit that student participation in environmental activism here
is quite low, and that Earthlust could
be a lot more organized and do more
visible stuff on campus. (To be fair,
student activists are quite busy offcampus with local and national legal
action). But if we organized a huge
rally to support Mother Earth, would
students come?
Of course no one is "against the
environment," but sometimes I feel
we have a climate on campus where
being too much for the environment
is considered trite, extremist, "ecocrazy," or just annoying. Swatties
have had enough eco-speak, they
"support the environment," so why
won't environmentalists leave them
alone? Students don't take thetime to
put cans and bottles in differentbins
or to put unused napkins back where
they came from (you can check on
any hall); on our environmental survey in the fall, 47% of students listed
"inconvenience" as a major barrier to
recycling, and 36% had never heard
of environmental justicebefore (only
one out of five was "confident they
knew what it meant").
I see our treatment by SAC as a
symptom of this: this isn't just one
bunch of students thinking their activity is more important than
another's, it's a group thinking that
value-freeentertainment is more important than consciousness-raising
and political action. Furthermore,
SAC evidently has the power to displace and cancel events of groups
whom they feel are not important.
So, two things: I want people to
know that Earthlust and Earth Day
have been disrespected by SAC, and
I want to tell people thatthis couldbe
a sign of something bigger. It could
mean that apathy and individualism
are on the rise here at Swarthmore
while participation and activism are
taken for granted, or even snickered
at. It could mean Earth Day 25 has a
new slogan. Instead of "Think Globally, Act Locally," it could read
"I'm for the Environment, Don't
Bother Me."

To the Editor:

After having read the Phoenix editorial "Damaged Roots," and having
been anearnest observer of what happens on this campus on a daily basis,
I am even more convinced mat the
vast majority of the people on this
campus are so farremoved fromreality that they couldn't get back if they
were given a map and a compass.
Last month's letter to the Editor,
"Damaged Roots" evoked a lot of
feelings from me, namely anger, indignation, shock, and disbelief. At
first, I thought it was funny that somebody could actually think this way,

and have it printed.
Then, Bradley speaks ad nauseam
about violence directed at certain
groups on this campus. He claims
that certain groups on this campus
are the victims of perpetual violence,
that there havebeen physical attacks,
and that there was an outbreak of
racist and homophobic violence at
some point. Have I missed something? Was there a recent
Krystallnacht of sorts directed against
blacks, gays, women and other
groups? If there was, I must be one of
the lucky ones that escaped the persecutions. I haven'theard of any physical attacks on anybody, whether they
happen to be a minority or not. As for
verbal violence, have we forgotten

Swat: Even When It's Really Bad, It's Still Really Good.
By Jim Foley

repressed and oft-derided love for an institu-

It's common knowledge that one thing Swarthmore students enjoy is complaining about
how much we hate it here—the dorms, the
food, the workload, you name it. Prompted by
Phoenixarticles in recent weeks thathave raged
against everything from nonexistent sex life to
formal dances to room choosing, I was motivated to play devil's advocate to all miserylovers on our campus. We actually love this
school, and will share common experiences in
our four years that will reaffirm our constantly

tion that tests us like nothing else in our lives.
We will shamelessly tap thatmother lode of
campus gossip—Willets hallways—for as much
inside information as can possibly be wringed
from our exhausted sources. We will wear
Willets like a badge of honor, a standard to be
met: "I lived in Willets for two years!""I never
lived in Willets!"
We will complain bitterly about the $2 we
must pay for a fraternity party. Then we will
bitterly complain that Pub Night is ripping us
off—if only they were more reasonable like the

frats. Then we will laugh at our ridiculous
friends at state schools who fork over ten bucks
for a sweaty bring-your-own-beer bash:
"What?! No kegs?! You gotta come to Swat..."
We will spend the entire allotted time for
dinner, from opening 'til they kick us out,
sitting in Sharpies talking about nothing in
particular but laughing so hard we cry.
We will wake up one day having sleptthrough
every class on our busiest day—and proceed to
stay in sweats, not leave bed, order in dinner,
read until we get tired, and go back to sleep for
the night.

What's Life Without a Little Activism?
By Justin Hall

The other day, I wandered too close to a tour
and heard that Swarthmore has a rich tradition
of activism. I've heard tell of more exciting
days—when authority was oppressive, the system was wrong, students knew it, and cared
more about causes than grades. Now, the socialists don't even get violent about old glory
over Parrish.

ulty—and most of us don't talk as much. You'll
be surprised at how much you'll learn from
teaching and how receptive yourpeers can be.
What have you got to lose? Soon, we'll all be
graduated, and someone will be paying us to do
our thing—let's share it while we're here.
Perhaps you yearnfor activism on a grander
scale. You can reach a broad (worldwide!)
student population with the Internet.
-

But I do feel activism pulsing around me on thiscampus.
Perhaps it's just the spring, or
my hormones. Regardless,
more ideas that could change
the world are bandied about in
the course of an afternoon than
I heard through most of high
school. The beauty of fruition
comes with dedication—and
I've beennoticing more ofthat
too.

There are fewer places nicer
for being a student activist.
Despite the drudgery, this is a
beautiful campus, the people
are fantastic, and the money
don'thurt either.
You are a resource—as is everyone in this
community. You wouldn't be here if you didn't
do something cool— heck, maybe even unique.
It don't matter if it's astronomy or joint rolling—let's teach each other! Reserve a classroom, or evenbetter, hold a class outside. Send
an e-mail around, post some flyers. Then, spend
a good hour talking about what you love about
what you know, and answering questions. We
have as much to teach each other as the fac-

The Internet is big news these days. In November of 1994, there were over 2,700 major
mediaarticles with the word"Internet" in them.
What's the big deal? The Internet is the prototype for the way informationand entertainment
will be distributed across the world in the 21st
century. It has hit its stride because they made
it cool—text, pictures, movies and sounds combined—just a mouse click away. This newest

We will learn about a great writer, discover
new music, and find a new favorite artist. It

Last week while listening to the senior speakoff, I started wondering what I have learned
while at Swarthmore. If anything, in the past
four years I've learned that our college mantra
of respect and tolerance are noble, but ineffective goals. I propose the administration, which
so fondly pushes these two characteristics as
prerequisites for a true college community,
should take a radical step: advocate love.
Now don't get me
wrong, this is not some

In America today, one out of five
children lives in poverty. And if a poor
child doesn't get help by the age of six,
experts predict he's more likely to drop
out of high school, live on welfare and
even spend a lifetime in and out of jail.
But this bleak future can be changed.
Early intervention programs like Success

Tolerance, by common definition, means
allowing someone to hold an opinion despite
disagreeing. It's a good first step in that tolerance stresses not attacking people who have
opposing views, but tolerance has a major drawback. The word at best implies we all tolerate
individuals so everyone in the groupcan speak
his or her peace. At worst, it implies every
individual is in the position tocast judgment on
our classmates' views and interfere at will. In

understand why others believe differently. An attitude of
love even has the potential to grow stronger as we explore our

differences.
It may seem strange
to call on an administration to advocate
love in our community, but it should not for a college founded by
Quakers. I know theCollegehas lost most if not
all of its Quaker characteristics, but urging
mutual love is consistent withthe Quaker view
that the inward light of God is present in every
person. We're used to hearing more officialand
sterile slogans from the administration, but
love is a better cornerstone for a community
than respect or tolerance.
A radical love agenda may be idealistic, but
no more so than respect and tolerance. During
the more tense episodes on campus over thelast
four years, respect and tolerance have broken
down. If we are going to fall short of noble
goals, then it is important keep our eyes on
meaningful, not convenient, ones. We as a

So, You Say New Method of Recycling Hits Sharpies
You Want a
Revolution...
To the Editor:

To the Editor:
After sitting through three hours of discussion in an attempt to clean up some of the
clutter left by the "Housing Fiasco of '95," we
pondered on what causes such maladies in a
paradise such as Swarthmore. It took little
thought to determine the root of all (or most)
evil: administration. No, we are not talking
about those figures called"Deans" that answer
most any and all student queries, instead we
wish to address the "higher-ups." Those that
actually make decisions about accepting gargantuan classes, apparently giving little thought
to what impact these decisions have on the socalled "College community." If Swarthmore
were not blessed with such amiable people in

the "Dean" positions, life here would be much
more difficult to bear. We are under the distinct
impression that whoever makes these fine decisions needs to spend a little more time on
campus and a little less time out attracting
money. Indisputably, these folks have lost touch

with campus life.
Housing predicaments are a minor problem
in the big picture. Conditions in dorms and
academic buildings, dining policies, and athletic/recreational facilities are also neglected.
While Kohlberg Hall will definitely be a welcomed addition to the campus, we wonder why
Trotter Hall was not renovated ten or fifteen
years ago. Better yet, why does the water run
brown in the sinks of Worth? To top it all off,
why is Swarthmore seemingly the only campus
on Earth that fails to provide flexibile meal
plans? We leave Tarble every day, red from the
gouging that occurs every time we run our little
card through thatdreadedmachine.ThenTarble
workers threaten to install video cameras to
catch students stealing. Where can the students
install their video cameras to catch Swarthmore stealing?
We accept responsibility for most of this. It
is, to a large degree, our fault just as it is the
fault of other students who fail 1to hold the
College accountable for its actions. But, how
can you say thatwhen we are only here for four
years? That precisely is the problem. Because
students are only here for four years, a true
effort to hold the College for the twenty-some
thousand dollars it charges in tuition has been
neglected. Not even neglected. Accountability
has been caught up in the bureaucracy, falling
victim to committee meeting after committee
meeting.
College rhetoric seemingly reduces everything to economic terms. While there is new
money for an addition to the athletic facilities,
the Collegeresponse for why it is not underway
is that they cannot afford themaintence.What's
the matter guys, endowment have a bad year?
Hardly. Swarthmore's endowment has out
paced the average market returns to such an
extent that Swarthmore could take over a large
corporation (with the expertise of Mr.
Kohlberg), say General Motors or IBM. This is
a typical response to studentposed questions as
to why little is happening to alleviate
Swarthmore's larger problems.
So, what can be done to increase Swarthmore College's accountability to its students?
Some might say little. But we, on the other
hand, believe much can be done to quicken the
process. First, establish what the greatest problems are. Next, find the most direct path to
fixing them. Third, bring the problem to the attention of the administration with proposed
repercussions. For instance, if a more flexible
meal plan is deemed worthy of students putting
up a fight, then instruct parents to withhold the
board part of the the College imposed fees.
This may seem strict and even ludicrous to
some, but if you have better suggestions we
would like to hear them (Parrish Parlors, Sunday night at 10). Finally, if the Collegerefuses
to implement the proposed plan or provide an
acceptable excuse, then stand hard behind the
plan. Swarthmore really hates negative publicity and a front page story in The Philadelphia
Inquirer entitled "Swarthmore Lets Student
Go Hungry" wouldnot sitwell with the incoming freshman class.
This has been brought to the Swarthmore
community as a means of illustrating how the
"Housing Fiasco of '95" is neither solely nor
entirely the fault of the Housing Committee,
the Deans, and surely not Myrt Westphal. Remember, be in Parrish Parlors, Sunday at

10:00pm.

Students dining at Sharpies this week may
have noticed a new addition to the array of
garbage bins around thetray conveyor belt. A
large grey bin garnished with a cheery sign
directing students to compost their fruit and
vegetable scraps now resides to theright of the
belt. Studentfood waste composting at Swarthmore has finally begun!
In conjunction with the Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar, Heather Fitzgerald '95,
Laura Perry '95, and Dan Wells '96 have been
organizing composting of food waste at Swarthmore this semester. This year, the Capstone
Seminar, also responsible for the construction
of the straw-bale house located behind the
Field House, has explored environmentally
friendly ways ofliving. Compostingfood waste
reduces the amount of waste that Swarthmore
sends to the Westinghouse incinerator in Chester
and will provide locally and naturally pro-

duced, high quality fertilizer for the Scott Arboretum and other users.
Up until this week, only the fruit and vegetable scraps produced in the Sharpies kitchen

and ML breakfast room have been collected.
Now, students can get involved by adding their
own food waste to the pile (by way of the

composting site, around 1/2 mile past ML.
Unfortunately, food waste can not be collected
on weekends.
Thus far this week, there has been some
confusion among students as to what belongs in
the compost bin. To clarify: all fruit and vegetable scraps (including the peel of that orange
you stole from Sharpies and ate in your room
last night) can be composted. Meat and dairy
products, and oily, greasy foods, including salad
dressing, french fries, and pizza, can attract
pests to compost piles and should not be
composted. Also, the compost bin is NOT a
trash can—paper napkins and cups should go
elsewhere!

conveniently located donationsbin by the conveyor belt!) The food waste produced is collected on weekdays by the recycling crew and
taken to a field adjacent to the Swarthmore and
Nether Providence Boroughs' yard waste

Swarthmore food waste composting will
continue through theremainder of this semester and resume early next year. For more information or to volunteer to help with the Swarthmore composting program, please contactLaura

Your Grandmother Never Used a Kleenex
By Lindsay Koval

FranzKafka wrote teat enlightenment comes
dull-witted; this aphorism must
have figured somewhere in the back of my
mind as I reached for the box of tissues. I
sneezed, expelling pollen, and thought of the
'Bos commercial, "Kleenex says, 'bless you.'"
Then I thought of life without Kleenex, albeit
more environmentally sound, and the absorbency of little lace hankies. This is not to be a
dissertation on the evils of mucous, however. I
realized that I, truly, in my room, am living
withoutKleenex. For, on my desk I have a box
of Puffs Plus—not Kleenex. In fact, like so
many other words, thebrand name Kleenex has
been transmutedinto thevernacular.The proper
noun has vanished into the abyss of the generic
kleenex; one rarely says, "please pass a tissue."
One says, instead, "give me a Kleenex."
My mind ravaged itselffor other examples of
this brand name infiltration, and it was not
unsuccessful. To name a few: In McCabe, you
tell your friend, "I'm going to the Xerox machine." You are, in theory, all though not in
practice, wrong. Xerox (capital X) is a brand
name; the machines in McCabe are OCE or
some alien variant. Do justice to the American
patent system; go to the photocopier.
to the most

Similarly, you slice your hand open on a can
which you were trying to crush so that it would
take up less space in the recycling bin. You
scream, "Gimme a band-aid!" Your roommate
lets you bleed to death because all she has is a
box ofCurad adhesive bandages; your hallmates

have the generic bandages from Eckerd drug.
Band-Aid, again, is a brand; the fine print on
the bandage box reads: "Band-Aidbrand adhesive bandages." Yet, once again, the brand
name subsumes the generic product in common
parlance.
You're on the beach and you think, "I can't
believe my grandfather is wearing a speedo."
What you do not know is that Gramps subscribes to International Male, the manly
Victoria's Secret, and his skimpy, flesh bearing, Greg Louganis-type swimsuit is not made
by Speedo at all. Your mind, scarred for life
now,

has failed to do justice to that pioneer of

swimsuit makers.

You're taking an exam on Roman history,
and as you're rereading your essay, you realize
that you have oft written seizure instead of
Caesar. You are too much of a perfectionist to
cross out this odious mistake, so youreach for
your white out. However, White Out is a product in a black and white bottle made by Liquid
Paper; you only have a Pentel correction pen.

Will its mysterious white opaqueness not eradicate your embarrassment equally well?
The partial list can continue, but you must
furnish your own anecdotes (try it some time.)
Lysol, a brand name, instead of the more generic, air freshener; birkenstocks for those much
cheaper look-alikes, and ditto for tevas;
walkman, a catchy name for the hand-held
cassette player, circa early 1980s; tampax instead of tampon. The list ranges from the mundane to the practically-taboo-yet-still-advertised-on-TV. The possibilities are limitless.
This frustration with the ambiguities of the

language may just be much ado about nothing.
The discrepancies between brand name and
product may be simply a case of proper noun
versus lower case noun, a distinction lost in
verbal communication. But shouldn't we want
to be distinct? I went to high school with a girl
who wanted to know for whom the atom was
named; but more sensibly and tangibly, don't
you want to know the identity of that John to

The English language is already nuanced
enough between the written and the spoken
word; embrace the simple and say what you
mean. Don't simply posture and gesture at what
you mean by using brand names.

Recollections of Buried Swarthmore Traditions...
By Tamar Charry
For Swatties, this spring has
brought the tumult of the Crum
Regatta, the thunder of the McCabe
Mile and soon, the elegance and
rock-n-roll of the Spring Formal.
After that, there will be Worthstock,
the Primal Scream to usher in
exams, and, finally, the chaos of the
Green Bottle Party. The winter saw
Screw-Your-Roommate and fall,
Halloween at ML. Add to that a
sprinkling of Dashes for Cash,
games by the Evil Buzzards, and
regular Dips of the Month, and
you've got a lot of Swat's fun.
But it hasn't always been that
way. Recently, I spoke with alumni
Bob Gross '62 and Jane Mullins '5O
about Swarthmore traditions of days
past I learned from them that many
charming traditions have been lost
in recent years.
At the top of both Gross' and
Mullins* lists of beloved-and-lost
traditions was the Hamburg Show.
Page 46 of the 1994-95 Guide to
Student Life describes the Hamburg
Show as "an original satirical revue
written and produced by students."
(There's also a song to go with it—check it out). Every spring from
1916 through the early '7o's, with
some revival in the eighties, the
show was a series of skits, "strung
together with a rough theme,"
according to Gross.

The show invariably made fun of
everyone, including students, faculty, and staff. Apparently, when the
whole school gathered for the performances, no one was safe from its
sharp tongue. As such, people seem
to have enjoyed it immensely.
Neither Gross nor Mullins were sure
why it ended. "There are various
stories," said Gross, "that everybody
became too busy, or everyone lost
their sense of humor and became too
'thin-skinned' to deal with that kind
of satire."
"I miss the Hamburg Show," said
Mullins, "That was a splendid
thing."
Another tradition was the faculty
production which, according to page
46 of the Guide, was "put on every
other year, or from time to time."
Gross recalled a production of The
Browning Version with the lead
played by biology Professor Bob
Savage, and Anything Goes starring
biochemistry professor Judy Voet.
Mullins said the faculty plays ended
when the academic calendar was
changed, with final exams moved
before Christmas. Whereas there
had been time to prepare and perform when exams were after the
break, the switch, in the early '7o's,
crowded professors' schedules too
much for it to be feasible.
In addition to theatrical pieces,
smaller, more informal events added
spark to the school year. A tug-of-

Cram meadow was held
every fall between first-year and
sophomore students. It was "a lovely way to spend a hot September
afternoon," Mullins recalls.
Gross describes "stretch," a game
with butterknives that students used
to play on Parrish beach while they
waited for meals. In the days before
Sharpies was built, the dining hall
was at the current site of the
Admissions office. Since it was
small, there was often a wait to get
in.
While students stood in line on
the beach, they would throw knives
into the ground at various distances
and then stretch their legs to touch
them from where they were standing. This would continue until the
stretch was too far for most players,
and only one was left standing.
"That's how we whiled away many
hours of our college educations," he
concluded.
These are only* a few of the old
traditions. In many ways, the history
of Swarthmore College mirrors that
of the entire country, and it also
includes charming sparks and anecdotes.
For interested students, I recommend reading Swarthmore College:
An Informal History. It's my personal favorite among coffee-table
books, and is available in the bookstore. Or talk to alumni. They have
some pretty good stories to tell.
war across

...And one which may be resurrected
By Tamar Charry
One tradition that falls on the more serious side of things is the
Senior Exit Interview. This practice, initiated in the rmd-1980's, gave
seniors and members of the administration the chance to talk about
seniors* parting impressions and suggestions. The practice has lapsed
in recent years, but senior Samprio' Ganguli is attempting to revive it.
In past years, the interviews were scheduled with various members
of the administration, including members of the offices of the Deans,
the Provosu Financial Aid, and Career Planning and Placement.
Seniors were provided wilh a general questionnaire designed to lead
them to articulate their feelings about their lime at Swarthmore.
Interviews were conducted one-on-one in order "to inform members
of the staff about the concerns of students."
After a few years, very few students were signing up for the interviews. As an alternative, and as a way for the faculty and administration to get feedback on controversial issues, says Dean Gross, the
Senior Speak-Out was initiated.
This was a forum in which specific topics were posed, and interested students could address them before the entire class as well as
invited administrators and faculty. The Senior Speak Out has also
seen a drop m participation. This year, at the urging of members of
the senior class, the Senior Interviews will be tried again, and the
Speak-Out will be laid down for the time being.
So, in a cyclical fashion, it has been suggested that we return to the
interview format, in which students will have the chance to speak in pxv
vaey.
It has not yet been decided whether the interviews will take place
this year. Ifthey do, they will be announced soon. Students with preferences for or against the interviews are encouraged to contact
Ganguli.

Veni, Vidi, Voco: Battle of the Bands
By Eric Pakurar

Five bands took the improvised stage in Tarble All-Campus
Space last Saturday evening for the first-ever Battle of the
Bands. Better than Wrestlemania, the head-to-head competition
left only one winner holding the shiny silver belt: a $5O gift certificate.
And the bands, in order of appearance:
Only

Yak&

two people are on stage playing a stripped-down drum
and a guitar—but not much more is needed to showcase

kit
senior Jake Anderson's music.
"Basically, Yak & started off because Jake wanted to perform his solo stuff live. He asked me if I wanted to back him
up," drummer Ben Bryson '96 says.
Anderson, who writes the music for Yak &, describes his
work as "punk rock, post-liposuction," and as unorthodox as
the label he uses is, so is his playing style. "If I played the guitar straightforward, I'd just be some coffee house geek."
Bryson is an apt complement to Anderson, as Anderson
describes: "His style is that he basically doesn't want to play

anything straightforward." Indeed, Bryson played the entire gig
last Saturday behind his drum set standing. Why? "It allows me
to jump over the drums."

The Tragic Dog Babies

Headed by Matt Leiberman '95 and Morgan Phillips '96,
most of this eclectic band was corralled together less than half
an hour before the band stepped on stage.
"There are so many opportunities here at Swarthmore that
there's no reason to let not having a band stop you from joining such an opportunity as Battle of the Bands," Phillips contends.

The band improvised a jazz tune, then a grunge tune entitled
"Your Mother, My Mother," and then returned to the tried-andtrue jazz improv, this time soliciting help from members of the
audience in what Phillips describes as "a karoake thing."
Phillips and one member of the audience, Paul Wachter '97,
were so moved by the vibe they created, they decided to form
a real band next year in their attempt to become "the Simon and
Garfunkel of the 21st century."

Meringue
Battle of the Bands boiled down to just one when the judging was over, leaving Meringue with a $5O gift certificate to
George's Music Store on Baltimore Pike.
Jake Anderson made his return to the spotlights as Yak &,
along with cohorts Gram and Kent Porter. Needless to say,
these are not their real names. "But how can you be a good rock
star without stage names?" Anderson asks.
While Swarthmore is a unlikely place to find a rock star,
more than one member of the other bands admitted that
Meringue played a tight set and soundedvery professional. But,
one might argue, they should: They've been playing together
for almost two years, they have a seven-inchrecord about to be
released on Proteen Records, and have toured together relatively extensively for a college band.
They play completely original music that Gram terms "indie
rock, I suppose. We don't sound like every other band on earth
and we're kind of catchy."
Sadly enough, the future is uncertain for Meringue, with Yak
heading to the west coast to persue a post-grad degree in linguistics. Nonetheless, "Kent and I are at least going to try
things for the next year or so," Gram says.
"After playing together for a long time, it [Battle of the
Bands] really felt like we were more than just a college band
out there having fun."

moment's notice.

Donaghy plays the bass, and Adam Busch '97 rounds out the
line-up on the drums.
The future looks good for the band, with tentative show dates
in New York City lined up for over the summer. Look for them
playing on campus again before the end of exams.
"We're never too serious about it," Donaghy says. "We're all
friends and we just have fun playing."

Sleeping with the Drummer

"Says what it does, does what it says." This ad slogan pretty
much sums up the origins of this band's name.

four-person band which plays mostly covers of anything from

Arts and Leisure
Between War

and Utopia
By Melissa Jacobs
If the Barnes Exhibition isn't enough

to

tempt you to visit the Philadelphia Museum of

Art this Spring, the museum's current display
of works on paper of the GermanAvant-Garde
should tip your scales. Between War and
Utopia: Prints and Drawings of the German
Avant-Garde contains prints by such prestigous artists as Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Beckmann, and Otto Dix. On display are lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, and ink drawings
created between 1905 and 1933, tumultuous
years in German history to say the least. They
were years which inspired tumultuous art.
The museum has pulled 75 works on paper
from its permanent collections. A number of
the included works are making their first
showing upon the museum's walls.
The prints are primarily in black and white
and have a naturalistic, primitive quality
which emphasizes a more raw emotional
response. The expressiveness of the medium
of print comes across. The exhibition contains
works produced over the thirty-year period in
which themes of naturalism, social protest,
and abstraction were all taken up. The few
prints which are in color make striking use of
the little color they use (particularly those of
Kandinsky's Small Worlds V, 1922).
The works are organized into artistic groups
which are concerned with different themes
while they experiment in the same form of the
print. The decade before World War I produced artists who were preoccupied with the
rejection of academic subject matter and
styles, and chose instead to represent romantic
and Utopian ideals in their work. Die Brticke
("The Bridge"), whose members included
Emil Nolde and Max Pechstein, created deliberately crude works. The exhibition displays
mostly nude studies, roughly scratched into
the paper, emphasizing the artists' interest in
the natural. Also on display are works by
members of Der Blauer Reiter ("The Blue
Rider"), whose more abstract compositions
emphasize art in its pure form: line, point,
color. The raw quality of the print form highlights the group's interest in these basic com-

violence and horrors of war. The starkness of
the black and white prints conveys the desperation of the period. Their etched quality
expresses the urgent survival instinct which
war arouses. Among the works on display are
a number from a cycle of war prints by Otto
Dix, based on Goya's Disaster of War. Klthe
Kollwitz's prints convey a sense of groping for
spirituality in the midst of war's destructionof
life.

ideals to grim realities. The prints depict the art from what they saw as bourgeois exclusiv-

ity. It was during these years thatBauhaus was
formed in Weimar. The sleek, detached efficiency of futurism makes its appearance in the
prints of this period. Typography is found in a
number of the prints. The prints seem to function on a more cerebral plane than the more
intuitive works produced before the war.
Included in this postwar grouping is a grim,
critical self-portrait of Max Beckmann, a drypoint from 1918 which screams of cynicism.
In 1937, the Nazi party included these
works among those given the dubious honor of
being declared "degenerate."
This show is not upbeat. But it is moving
and a great opportunity to see the sheer versa-

tility of the print. The exhibition will be open
through late July.
While you're there, it's worth it to take a
peek next door to see the exhibition of "outsider art," or art created by people with no formal artistic training. The museum has put
together a collection of drawings and prints
from the Artist Community at Guggig, the
members of which are all under psychiatric
care at the Austrian State Psychiatric Hospital
near Vienna.
Their primitive and child-like works have
much of the same effect of many of the woodcuts, drawings, and etching in the neighboring
gallery.

Rob Roy:
Tough Men
Wear Skirts

Rap Old School Meets
Hip-Hop Next School
By John Kane

By David Rich
For those of you who thought he was just a drink,
check this out: Michael Caton-Jones brings to the
screen the story of the Scottish folk hero Robert Roy
MacGregor in the new film, Rob Roy.
The movie opens with Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) and
his clansmen chasing down some other Scots who have
stolen sheep from the English noble who owns the land
they live on. From this scene, we quickly learn that
MacGregor is a man of honor when dealing with other
people. In an effort to improve the impoverished
lifestyle of his family, Rob borrows £l,OOO from
Montrose (John Hurt), the English landowner whose
sheep he watches over. The money, however, is stolen
from Rob's trusted fellow, played by Eric Stolz, by a
young English fop Archibald Cunningham. Tim Roth
plays this disturbing chap as a complete psychotic. The
movie follows the dastardly deeds of Archie and his
English soldiers and the ways that the Scots fight back.
The cast of Rob Roy is awesome. Neeson plays the
highlander as a truly noble man, yet wanders around the
screen covered in blood and mud. He never loses sight
of his honor or that of anyone else who is dear to him.
At first, Cunningham seems to be a bored English noble
with a slightly darker side; but, when he goes after
MacGregor's home and wife, he becomes purely evil.
Roth plays Archie as a truly despicable psychopath.
Jessica Lange as Rob's wife, Mary MacGregor, is a
wonderful match for Neeson; Mary is just as spirited,
wild and strong as Rob.
Rob Roy is not an action flick. Some reviews have
criticized the film for building up to climactic action
sequences that weren't there, but that's not what the
film is about. It's the story of a common man and his
family standing up for what is right and doing whatever it takes to achieve it against a greater power. Don't
get me wrong, though, there is some great action: After
being captured, Rob has a great escape that culminates
in the most interesting (read: disgusting) hiding place
I've ever seen in a movie. And the final duel is the best
swordplay since Inigo Montoya fought the Man in
Black. Rob faces Archie, a very experienced and deadly swordsman—a duel in all senses of the word. We
watch two men who hate each other trying to kill one
another. Archie sends as many attacks with his icy
looks as he does with his sword. Archie embodies the
English nobility with his slim rapier and fast moves,
while Rob is the ultimate highland Scot with his gigantic claymore and his brutal style. (That other film about
a highland Scot might have learned something about
swordfighting from this fi1m....)
Everything about the movie is very tight and serves
to keep the film cohesive. The camera follows the
MacGregors through the übiquitous hills of Scotland as
if we were there, walking over the country with Rob.
And the traditionalScottish music is gorgeous, evoking
the honor and emotions of the men and women on
screen.
I have absolutely no complaints aboutRob Roy. I can
only recommend it as a beautiful story and a wonderful
diversion from the grind that is the end of the semester.
If you're going to escape for a few hours for a flick,
make it Rob Roy. "Great shot, kid; that was one in a
million!" A (5).

The first album by Justice System, a six-man hip-hop combo from
Greenburgh New York, displays the group's instrumental virtuosity and commit
ment to pushing the genre in a new direction without forgetting their musica
roots. The first thing that distinguishes the record Rooftop Soundcheck is th
emphasis on the group members' own jazzy accompaniments over samples anc
scratching. Justice System utilizes live drums, upright bass, hollow-body guitar
sax and organ in smooth, melodic arrangements behind the rapping of vocalists
Folex and Jahbaz and on two instrumentals. The group's playing is as or mor
skillful than the live instrumentation of other hip-hop groups like Digabl
Planets, while the rapping is agile, if somewhat uninspired.
Justice System has been said to represent the future of rap music in fea
turing its own playing rather than pre-recorded technology, but Rooftop
Soundcheck also reveals a clear allegiance to both old-school rap, jazz, funk,
and soul music from the 60's and 70's. The vocal tone and delivery of rappe
Jahbaz is reminiscent of Grandmaster Rash, and the Justice System's singl
"Tribute to Bambaataa" makes explicit their reverence and nostalgia for th
pioneers of rap, especially breakthrough artist Afrika Bambaataa. The song is an
intriguing collage of Justice System's lush horns, the rap recalling the New York old school, and taste
fully-used samples by more contemporary crews Tribe Called Quest and Boogie Down Productions. "Santana" a slow
funky instrumental with a series of solos, is even more up-front about its influence and retro-ness.
For all their skills and range, I perceive Justice System as still entrenched in some of the limiting tendencies of recent rap music
Their rhymes are weak at times (e.g. "country bumpkins/ smashing pumpkins/ Siamese cats soupin' cheeseball rap groups/ who don'
understand the terms of space and time/ and rhymin', rhymin', rhymin', rhymin"') and the group seems unconcerned with political anc
social issues. I'm not trying to suggest that every rap group needs to have a political agenda, but I wouldlike to see Justice System strive
for some of the vigorous wordplay and creativity ofTribe Called Quest and/or the social concern of Public Enemy and KRS-ONE.
Just because Justice System can deftly mix their own skillful jazz/funk melodies with samples, scratching, and funky beats, doesn'
mean they don't have to work hard on their rhymes. The group is young, however, and this is their first record; they have as much poten
tial as any up-and-coming hip-hop act, and it will be interesting to chart their development on future releases.

Women's

Rugby
Swarthmore Women's Rugby had a mixed
weekend against University of Delaware. ASide lost 5-3 but theB-side was victoriousby a
score of 5-0. However, this score is a great
improvement over last season's considerably
greater loss to University of Delaware.
The A-side game was a very defensive match
for Swat. Their back line was against their try
zone for great lengths oftime in the secondhalf
but Swat was able to hold Delaware back many

times. Swat's strength was in their defensive
ability to shut down University of Delaware's

offense. Rookie Aly Yeagar '9B scored Swat's
three points off of a penalty kick.
B-side's only try was scored by scrum half
Jen Philpott '97, who has been scrum halfmg
both A- and B- sides since Paula Garrett '95
was injured. Philpott scored off a weak side
sneak off of a ruck.

their final league game of the season this Sunday on the Dupont Rugby Field.

Men's

Rugby
The mens rugby team traveled to LaSalle
University last Saturday and came home with
one hard-won victory and one defeat due to a
shortage of B-side players .The A-side score
was Swat 17 LaSalle 10 with tries scored by
Justin McLean '95, Eric Ellingson '95, and
Alec Stall '9B. McLean scored off a weak side
run into the try zone off of a scrum,a set play
that he runs often and well. Ellingson's score
was significantly more exciting, however, as
he finally managed to get the ball over the try
line after a tough try line stand(rumor has it that
even the goal posts bowed down to the 'Duke'
after his try). The try was significant also because it was Ellingson's first A side score, but
you will have to ask him if he agreed to get
naked! There was an additional first on Saturday as Stall scored on a tough five meter run
thatresulted in five points and a bloody nose for
Stall.
The line-up was the same as in last weekend's
game, with the exception of Matt Jacobson '97
who started in his first A side game at wing and
played an excellent game with strong tackles
and good defense. Jason Sturm '97 played
another great game at full-back despite a serious injury to his right leg thathe played through
for a full half. Ellingson had a great game as
well.The Swatforward pack completely dominated the LaSalle rucks and scrums in the
second half, demonstrating their superior level
of fitness and stamina.
The B-side loss was not unexpected as Mike
Madden '95 played, fullback and McLean and
Jason Dougal '96 played wings (all three are
full-time forwards). That was only the tip of the
ice-berg, though.The team also recruited from
the side-lines; friendofChris Jahnke, McLean's
younger brother (who is basically his twin)
played Justin's own position, and ChazTeplin's
friend from England (ah actual rugger) played
in the secondrow. All in all, it is amazing that
Swat was even able to field a team, much less
play a full B-side game!
This weekend is hugely important for the
Evil Buzzards. They play in the Temple Tournament in Philadelphia against the best teams
in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union. A
good showing at this tournament would go a
long way towards improving Swat's rankings
in the Union. The following Saturday will be
the alumni game with lots of talented and notso-oldalums returning to show our guys a thing
or two. That should be a good game and promises, as always, to be a lot of fun to watch on
Saturday, April 29 at Dupont Field.

The women's lacrosse team broke even this
week, defeating Western Maryland last
Wednesday, but losing a disappointing game

Ursinus on Saturday. In the Garnet's 13-9
victory over Western Maryland, the scoring
was evenly distributed among the Garnet's
offensive unit. Lara Ewens '96 had an outstanding game, scoring 5 goals and 3 assists.
Co-captain Julie Noyes '95 and Kristen
Osborne '97 each contributed 3 goals, while
Laura Starita '97 netted an additional 2 goals.
Defensively, Madeline Fraser '95 was particularly strong, recording 3 interceptions. In
Saturday's 13-11 loss, Swarthmore gave up a
3 goalhalf-time lead, allowing Western Maryland to overtake them by a score of 12-11 with
9 minutes remaining in the game. Unfortunately, the Garnet was unable to stage their
own comeback in the final minutes of play.
Despite the loss, Swarthmore's offensive
attack played well. Noyes had an impressive
game, netting 6 goals and 1 assist. Osborne
and Ewens each had 2 goals, and Erin Flather
'97 added 1 goal to the final score. This
Saturday, the team will look to get back on
track as they face Johns Hopkins University in
an away match.

Golf
With the end of the season rushing upon us,
the Swat golf team traveled to matches at
Western Maryland last Saturday and Albright
on Tuesday, and will finish up its season at the
Centennial Conference championship in Ocean
City, MD this weekend.
At the Western Maryland Invitational,
Swarthmore for once put its top 5 golfers on the
course at one time, and managed to avoid
finishing in last place. Swat came in ahead of
NYU, keeping our record against urban area
schools nearly perfect (presumably they have
more trouble finding a course than we do).
About 14 teams did squeak in ahead of Swat.

The team was lead by Shawn Bundy '97, who
despite ungodly windy conditions posted an
86. Matt Metcalf '95 hit 90, Travis Elliott '96
came in at 93, Rob Day '95 scored an even
century, and Bonnie Rostan '9B had a bad day.
On Tuesday, Swat traveled to Reading to
take on Albright and Ursinus. Unsurprisingly,
Swat failed to upset either of these golf powers, but Jim Foley '95 and Tony Cheesebrough
'97 each had personal bests, both dropping
many, many strokes from their previous outings. A high point of the match on paper was
Swat having four scores below 100for only the
second time this season, as Metcalf had 88,
Rostan 96, Foley 98, and Day 99.
Unfortunately, Swat was unable to qualify a
full team of 4 or 5 for the conference tourney
for the second time in the last three years. To
qualify, one needs an average of 95 or better in
three matches. Both Day and Rostan just
missed qualifying for the Centennial championship: Rostan averaged 96, and Day 99 in
their three best. Bundy, Metcalf, and Elliott
will compete as individuals this weekend in
Ocean City. If you're dying to know how we
do, just ask us, because we're unlikely to write
about it!

Men's

Tennis
The Garnet men were blown away last weekend. Literally. A 7-0 loss at the hands of host
SUNY Binghamton last Saturday diminished
the tennismen's chances of reaching the yearending national tournament. The top two teams
from the East region qualify, but Swarthmore
is currently ranked third behind Williams and
Binghamton, two teams that have trounced the
Garnet this season.
A 6-1 demolition of Rochester the following day couldn't lift the cloud of despair that
hung over the Garnetfollowing the overwhelming Binghamton loss. The weather conditions
may have affected the Garnet's play, as temperatures fell to 45 degrees and thewind gusted
at 40 miles per hour. As the Garnet players
struggled to find their rhythm, the match and
aspirations of a national bid swirled away.
The team can only hope now that Williams
or Binghamton suffer several bad defeats or
choose not to attend the national tourney. Last
year Williams qualified but chose not to send
their team.
To retain their spot in the on-deck circle the
Garnetneeds to win their two remaining Division IQ matches, both at home. This Saturday
the Garnet host Skidmore College, and on
Tuesday the tennismen play rival Haverford.
The Haverford match is a revival of a rivalry
that has been on hold for the past three years.
Nearly all of the Garnet's wins and losses
this year have been blowouts. Every victory
has been by a score of 7-0 or 6-1. Conversely,
every loss has also been 7-0 or 6-1, with the
exception of the loss to Trinity, 5-2. This
pattern reveals much about the tennismen's
psyche, says Manik Arora '96. "In an individual sport it's amazing to see a team so
unified. This team has traveled together, eaten
together, slept together, even bathed together.
It comes through in the matches. When a
couple of people aren't playing well we all
play badly and vice-versa."

Softball
The Softball team seems

to be in a bit of a rut

lately. Last week they lost two to Muhlenberg
University's Mules, and this last Monday they

gave up two more tough ones to Alvernia.
Both Muhlenberg and Alvemia had experienced pitchers who put a damper on the team's
hitting. Muhlenberg's pitcher almost walked
away with a no-hitter and a shut-out in the first
match, but for one lone hit that knocked a
walked batter, Fernanda Gonzalez '9B, in for a
run. Both of the games against Muhlenberg
were full of solid defensive plays.
In the match against Alvernia, the fourth
inning was particularly notable for Swarthmore.
Decent hits and aggressiverunning by Michelle
Walsh '9B and co-captain Margy Pierce '95,
with help from a sacrifice hit by co-captain,
Kim O'Shea '95, pushed the only run across the
plate. The Garnet women hope to see some
fans at our games during this last week of our
season. Take some time away from those papers to come out tomorrow at 1:00, to support
the team in their last game against Dickinson.

The Garnet, in the midstof the toughest part
of their schedule, finished the week 1-2, earning their first ever Centennial Conference victory against Dickinson. The two losses came at
the hands of two very solid teams: Drexel and
Franklin & Marshall.
Not considered to have any chance against
Drexel, a full scholarship schoolwith an enrollment of over 8,000 in theheartof Philadelphia,
the Garnet proved a tough opponent.. When
Drexel came out to a solid 1-5 second quarter
lead, it looked as though the Garnet should not
have showed up. Yet, led by Kevin Aldrich '95
and Eric Griffin '96, the team steam rolled
back, deadlocking the score at seven as the half
rolled around. However, keeping up with the
tradition of this year, the Garnet ran out of
steam in the third quarter as Drexel rolled up
seven unanswered goals to put the game out of
reach. The Garnet were able to score some late
goals to close the final score to 16-11, an
impressive feat for the overmatched Garnet.
Up next for the Garnet was a struggling
Dickinson team. There was no room left for a
moral victory, as the Garnet needed the win to

Red Devils a two goal lead before coming into
their own. The Garnet owned the rest of the
half, scoring eight consecutive goals while playing superb defense. Andy Petusky '95, playing
hurt, shut down the opponent's best player,
whileBen Henwood '97 made some spectacular saves and did not allow a goal for thirty
minutes. Brian Dougherty '95, Ben Seigel '96,
Cary Schaub '95 and Andy Place '96 all scored
goals during this run to ensure the 8-2 halftime
lead. A late Dickinson effort closed the gap,
butSwarthmore hung on to the 12-8 final score.
The Garnet's next opponent was #8 ranked
Franklin & Marshall. The Diplomats are a
perennial national final four team with a huge
roster and many skilled players. In the toughest
effort by the men this year, the first quarter
scoreboardread 1-1. After pulling to a 3-2 lead,
the Diplomats scored the next three goals for a
5-3 halftime lead. But the Garnet would not
give up, playing with a desire that isn't often
.seen in athletes. They refused to be beaten,
making runs throughout the second half in an
attempt to tie the score. Dougherty and Aldrich
combined on outstanding goals during the second half, while Seigel added three of his own
against the stunned Diplomats. Although the
final score was 18-11, it was a much closer
game thanthat. CoachZach Colburn called the
game "one of thebest efforts by any team I have
been a part of."

Swat Water Polo Debuts and Looks to Build Winner
By Skye Fulkerson, Alex Huk, Karsten
Scherer-Nadal, and Kendrew Witt
Some members of the Swarthmore community have wondered why our College has consistently ranked number three by US News &
World Report behind Williams and Amherst;
some chalked it up to alumni dissatisfaction,
percentage of faculty with doctorate degrees,
or possibly "that Connie Chung thing." Alex
Huk '96, however, thought otherwise: "what
we really need is a waterpolo club."Supported
by Aquatics Director Sue Davis, student government, and several interested friends, the
water polo club has come into existence this
semester.

The club is already
known for its unusual
Saturday morning runs
in preparation for the
grueling yet satisfying

practices; donning
Speedos and the distinctive polo headgear and
running around campus
braving the shocked
responses of onlookers.
Water polo hasbecome an increasingly popular intercollegiate sport. Several Swarthmore
students have high-school water polo experience, including Carl Sanders '9B, Brian Wong
'96, and Jimmy Solodar '97. "There has always
been a considerable amount ofinterest in fielding a polo club. All I did was put it together."
said Huk, captain and student-coach.
The clubhas already madeitspresence known
via its infamous Saturday morning runs, during
which the team warms up for practice by donning Speedos and protective headgear and running around campus. Polo player JaimeRaich
described the phenomenon,"After the first few

'Omigods,'you get used to it, and just worry
about getting psyched for practice."
Putting together the club did not prove an
easy endeavor. The team scheduled practices
and pool times, but were unfortunately placed
into ware pool's graveyard shift, frequently
finishing up weeknight practices at eleven PM.
They had to employ engineer and polo enthusiast Ross Dickson '97 for the construction of
quality regulation size goals. "I built them.
They are strong," he proudly proclaimed. The
team has spent much of this semester teaching
newcomers the basic rules of the game as well
as refining competition-level "skillz" and tactics. "They're a young team,"remarked mentor
Joe Weber."We basically run a lotof drills and
let the more experienced among us expose
their., .wealthofknowledge" said goalieKarsten
Scherer-Nadal '96.

"Our goal is to gain enough experience and
cohesiveness as a team to beable to compete on
the inter-collegiate level. Check that...to win
on the inter-collegiate level," commented
Kendrew Witt '96. "With players like Carl and
Brian on the perimeter and Al and Doug Rouse
in the hole position, I think we've got a battleready team" Known as one of the most physically demanding of sports, water polo requires
players to follow an intense regimen of conditioning, involving swimming, weight-lifting
and running through public areas wearing next
to nothing. "It's a tough sport, but somebody's
got to do it," says Carl.
Event though it is a demanding sport, polo
players find the atmosphere at practice a very
relaxed one. Some of the varsity swimmers on
the team havementioned thatpolo practices are
a welcome change from the rigorous drudgery

of competitive swimming. Nonetheless, polo
practices are not for the squeamish. Doug Rouse
'9B, winter-time basketball player, remarked
"It's a big commitment, but it's worth it. We
have a lot of fun, but I go home exhausted."
A wealth of competitive opportunity exists
in the near area, with the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Gettysburg College,
Villanova University and Philadelphia Textile
all fielding experienced water polo clubs.
"We're hoping to schedule a half-dozen games
or so with area schools next season, so that we
can break into the East Coast top-twenty club
teams," said Huk.
This Saturday, the club will have its final
preparatory scrimmage of the semester at Ware
Pool at 1:00 p.m..

Garnet Rally in Sixth Downs Haverford
By Frank A mar

This weekend, the Garnet baseball squad
rode thewild and wooly rollercoaster thatis the
Centennial Baseball Conference. Friday afternoon, the Garnet traveled to Lancaster, PA to
do batde with Franklin and Marshall. Judging
from the offensive fireworks at Clothier Field
on Tuesday, the fans were probably expecting
similar results. Instead, they were Created to a
pitchers duel. Sam Voolich '96 pitched well,
surrendering two runs and seven hits in eight
innings. The Garnet offense, however, offered
absolutely no support. The F&M starter stymied thebats all afternoon, allowing only three
hits in going the distance as the Garnet came
away with a disappointing 2-0 loss.
OnSaturday afternoon, the Garnet definitely
proved that the old adage "Every dog has his
day" is true. The hated Black Squirrels of
Haverford came to town to play two in the
blustery conditions. Chuck Hudson '96 turned
in another decent performance, pitching
fiveinnings before giving way to JeremyBonder

would be heading for their 11th straight defeat.
However, the Wild Nine mounted a furious
comeback. Matt Wiggins '96, Pat Straub '97
and Bob Mascia '96 started the inning with
singles. Mascia's base hit plated Wiggins, cutting the lead to 4-2.
Twobatters later, Jeremy Bonder '97 singled
a run home to bring the score one run closer.
Aaron Zwicker's '9Bbases loadedwalk tiedthe
score at 4-4. After a fielder's choice by Drew
Clayton '96, the most unlikely of heroes, Jeff

strode to plate full of confidence. After working a full count, Gans blasted a triple to

we'd beable to shut them down in the seventh."
Unfortunately, the euphoria of game one did
not carry over. Pat Straub '97 was roughed up
for the second consecutive outing, surrendering sevenruns in 1.2 innings; no doubt his arm
was feeling the effects of overuse. Unable to

The rejuvenated Garnet played host to
Muhlenberg Tuesday. The game was back and
forth for the first four innings. In the sth, the
Garnet put up a four spot to put it out of reach

The Phoenix

Tennis Continues to Win and
Looks to Qualify for Nationals
By Charity Miller
The women's tennis team has continued its winning over the past two
weeks, raising its conference record
to 8-1 and its overall record to 12-2.
The team handled Ursinus on
Wednesday, April 12 with a final
score of 6-3. The #1 and #2 doubles
teams of Becca Kolasky '96 and
Ayanda Nteta '95, along with Kim
Crusey '95 and Becky Katz '95 prevailed 8-2, displaying their strength
as players and as teams. The top four
singles players rolled over their opponents with five sets of 6-0 to prove
it. Crusey, Kolasky, Nteta, and Katz
displayed their experience as well as
their individual strengths as singles
players. Hilary Gehlbach '96 fought
hard to win the second set in her
singles match but was unable to produce the three-set win.
On Thursday, April 13, the team
faced its toughest competition of the
year, Trenton State. They hailedfrom
New Jersey(and had the hair to prove
it), but also had powerful strokes and
solid players throughout the line-up.
Swat entered the match knowing
thatNationals could be at stake since
Trenton State was ranked above
Swarthmore and only three teams
from the east get invited to the tournament. The new format of play dictated that doubles would start the
match and would play eight game
pro-sets. Swat's then undefeated #1
team of Kolasky and Nteta played
hardbut were just hitting their stride
when the match was decided, 4-8.
The #2 team of Crusey and Katz
played incredibly to defeat Trenton
8-5. This win gave Swat the crucial
point it needed heading into singles
play. However, losing the #3 doubles

match along with the #1 match put
Swarthmore in the uncomfortable
position of needing to prevail in 4 of
the 6 singles matches to win overall.
The top three singles players
proved their strength once again, each
defeating her opponent convincingly.
Crusey, Kolasky, and Nteta had excellent performances, dropping only
6 games between the three of them.

respectively, played solid matches,
but were unable to come up with
wins.
Becky Katz '95 dropped the first

the tide of the match in the second
set. She and her opponent battled
with long, intense, base-line rallies.

trading excellent shotafter excellent
shot. Becky showed how tough she
can be, winning the rallies and putting shots away for convincing winners. She won thesecond set 6-2. The
momentum of the match unfortunately turned in the third set. The
Trenton State player resorted to high,
loopy ground strokes that were frustrating yet consistent. Katz fought
hard but was unable to capture the
third set.
The overallmatch was decided by
a score of 4-5, marking Swat's first
loss since spring break. Unfortunately, this one loss could prevent the
team from traveling to Virginia to
prove that they deserve a place at

Nationals. The decision will

rest on

whether the team is invited to attend
or not.

The women bounced back this
and
defeated
Wednesday
Muhlenberg. Katz and Nteta teamed
up to play #1 doubles and won 8-2.
Winning at #2 was Martinez and
Gehlbach, 8-5. First year players Rani
Shankar '9B and Becky Riskey '9B
stepped in to play #3 doubles and
despite their strong play, succumbed
6-8. Crusey continued her winning at
#1 by defeating her opponent 6-2,60. Nteta played #2 singles and prevailed in three sets.Katz and Martinez
were also both victorious.Riskey won
easily at #6 singles, dropping only
one game.
The team has only two regular
season matches left They will face
Johns Hopkins on Sunday at the
Faulkner Courts and will end the season at Washington. Regardless if the
women are invited to Nationals, they
have proved that this year, they are
one of the strongest teams in Division IJJ.

Warmothers Tear Through Penn State and Princeton
By Delila Leber
and Kate Walker
For the past two weekends, the
women's frisbee team has attended
tournaments at Princeton and Penn
State, sparkling with a new cohesion
and greatly refined skills. On Saturday, April 8, the Warmothers arrived
with ease and confidence. Without
getting lost. On time. They surprised
even their co-captainKaty Harrod '97
(who had promised she would paint
herface green if they won a game) by
winning 3 out of 4 games. They were
a terror to be reckoned with on this
day of firsts.
University of Rochester's Erogenous Zone was the first team to

succumb to Swarthmore's superior
The first half of the game
seemed evenly matched although
Swatretained the lead. In the second
half, Swat's completed passes, sharp
cuts and a several remarkable performances in the end zone sealed up
their victory. Kate Walker '97 flew

victorious, scoring the tenth point

The second game of the day was
against the team' s frequent opponent,
Drew's Bovine Intervention. They
gave Drew a teaserby giving up the
first point, but proceeded to trounce
them 11-3. SarahKnudsen '9B darted
deep and often into the endzone, creating a status for herself as a scoring
powerhouse. In breaking Drew's
spotty zone defense, Harterlet loose
her long and powerful hucks. After

Athletes of the Week
Kim Crusey '95

Senior Kim Crusey has been a major force behind the women's tennis
team's successful year. As the #1
player, Kim has faced tough competitionfrom each opposing team. Since
spring break, Kim has remained undefeated.
She has proved her strength by
consistently defeating top players in
the conference; in the past three
matches, Kim has dropped only six
games. She had a convincing win
over the TrentonState #1 player, and
has a very good chance of advancing
to Nationals individually. Kim also
combines strong leadership with her
strong play, adding to the team's stability and unity.

Eric Walton '97 proved experience isn't always the strongest
weapon one can have, with a phenomenaleffort in last weekend' s dual
track and field meet against Johns
Hopkins. He PR'd in the discus with
a throw of 115 feet, and was a scant
three feet off the school record with
his javelin throw of 169 feet.
"Walton is a talented athlete who
had never used those talents as far as
track and field was concerneduntil a
year ago. Nowhe's at thepoint where
he is starting to excel without having
any background at all," throws coach
Don Burns says. "During his senior
year, he should be breaking his own
school records in disc and javelin."

thoroughly annihilated by Rutgers,
but the team was pleased to beable to
leave before the rain really started.
Last Saturday, April 15, the team
enjoyed the setting full moon as they
embarked on the long journey to Perm
State. Again arriving on time, the
team spent the day with the wind as
their main opposition. Continual zone
defense tired and tested the
Warmothers, whose throwscould not
holdup to the strength of the wind as
successfully as the throws of other
teams. The team combatted Cornell,
Bucknell, and Penn State, losing players to injuries left and right as the day
progressed and playing on with minimal sideline substitution. (Vagrant
images of Harter limping to the disc
under seven layers of clothing...)
'Twas an enigmatic first tournament
for newcomer Ashley Flynn '9B, but
she gave a courageous effort. The
first game tested the team's enthusiasm as Cornell slipped by them untouched by Mother Nature's wind.
The Warmothers bucked up to
Bucknell in game two, catapulting
the disc time and again into Frosh
Ericaßaumgartner's firm grasp. The
win against Bucknell kept the spirit
of the team salient for the third game.
Patrice McGuire '97 contributed aggressively to both offense and defense, anchoring the cup defense
(three quick slick chicks shielding
any short passes) through this grueling final game against Penn State.
The game threatened to drag on
through the night, but eventually
concluded with Penn State on top.
Swarthmore's Warmothers have
seen outstanding improvement since
last Spring's one-win season.
Theteam is particularly young and
shines with great hope for future accomplishment. In the Sectionals
Tournament this weekend, the team
aims to establish itself as a stunning
female frisbee force.
