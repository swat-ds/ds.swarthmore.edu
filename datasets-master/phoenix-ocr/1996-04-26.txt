Housing Waiting Lists Shorter Than Last Year's, Despite Students' Fears
By

Kate

Zyla

After Thursday night's room choosing for rising sophomores, forty-seven
members of the classes of'9B and '99
were left without reserved living
space for the fall semester. Eighteen
of those students are rising juniors
who opted not to make aroom selec-

tion, and instead put their names on a
waiting list for singles that may or
may not become available. Nine men
in the class of '99 also passed on a
room when their number was called,
and have been added to a separate
waiting list for general housing openings. Twenty soon-to-be-sophomore
women were left unable to select a
room after all available female space
had been filled. One room, located in
Mary Lyon basement on the men's
side of the hall, was left unchosen.
Myrt Westphal, director of residential life, notes an improvement in

the results of room choosing from
previous years. She points out that
last year, more than fifty students
were on the waiting list, and comments, "The fact that we told people
that we would engage in overflow
housing and were clear that we would
fill all empty beds has eased anxieties. Students are confidentthat they
will be housed, although they might
have to wait two to three months to
find out where."
Although the College has guaranteed housing to all students, the guarantee does not apply to students who
voluntarily passed on room choosing. While all efforts will be made to
find everyone a room, only those
who were not given the option of
choosing are truly guaranteed a space.
Amber Frank '99 is one of the
twenty students who were unable to
choose aroom Thursday night, and is
taking the evening's events in stride.

"I would say that I was disappointed
except that I never had any hopes of
getting a room tonight, so I'm not."
She and the other wait-listed students
were asked to fill out a questionnaire
expressing housing preferences, but
Frank was hesitant to be too choosy
since she didn't want to miss out on
any available spaces.
As for the likelihood that students
on the waiting list will receive campus housing, it is common for students who may spend a semester
abroad or who have not yet signed an
apartment lease to reserve housing as
a safety net. Each year, many rooms
open up at the end of the school year
or during the summer once plans have
been finalized. Approximately ten or
twelve singles are opened up to the
waiting list annually.
In the event that not enough dormitory rooms become available to house
all of the students who have been

guaranteed housing, the College has
made a commitment to provide offcampus housing with as many dormitory amenities as possible. It will not
be apparent until midsummer whether
or not this will be necessary. While
Westphal was unable to state precisely where the additional housing
would be located, it would be no
farther away from campus than either
Mary Lyon or Woolman, would involve rooms comparable in size to
dorm rooms, and would be staffed
with a Residential Advisor.
Basic phone service, perhaps Bell
Atlantic, would be provided, as would
a modem and the software needed for
remote access to campus computing
facilities. It is not feasible for the
College to network an apartment complex as it would a dorm room. Students would be able to use the modem to access campus servers and
print to the Beardsley Public Area

During a faculty lunch on April 17,
the Dean's Office presented a talk
entitled "Confidential Communication vs. Open Secrets: Reviewing
Student Privacy in the Aftermath of a
Crisis." Introduced by Dean Ngina
Lythcott, it was presented by David
Ramirez, Director of Psychological
Services, and Associate Dean Bob
Gross. The talk dealt with the confidentiality of students seeking psychological counseling, an issue that
has been prominent since Gabriel
Cavallari's suicide last November.
Faculty members were concerned
that they had not been informedof his
emotional problems, and wondered
whether everyone had done everything possible. This presentation attempted to address these concerns.
According to Ramirez, "[The talk]
reiterated our policy, which is not
controversial at all. When students
come to Psychological Services for
counseling everything they talk about
is confidential; no one outsideis made
aware that they were there and no one
knows what they said."
Ramirez explained that there are
two exceptions to this policy:when a
student is a danger to themselves or
to someone else. If this is the case, the
department makes a decision—in
consultation with the student—about
what should be done. "Nine times out
of ten a studentknows the danger of
their own situation and cooperates
when we need to bring in someone
else," he said.
Ramirez also stressed that Psychological Services will not call the
Dean's Office and will not discuss a
case with anyone, including parents
and faculty members, or even confirm or deny that a particular student
is receiving counseling. However,
they will educate faculty about these
issues and suggest ways of dealing
with them, while ensuring that confidentiality is always maintained.
Dean Gross said, "In general, we
try to err on the side of confidentiality. [Psychological Services believes]
that what they would have to say
would not be as useful to the faculty
as the faculty might think it is." He
also said that students need to know
that they can feel safe coming to
Swarthmoreand talking in confidence
about their problems.
Faculty members feel the situation
is a difficult one to contend with.
Barry Schwartz, professor of psychology, commented, "On the one
hand, we ought to treat students as
mature, autonomous adults, which
means that we respect privacy just as
we would in society at large. What
follows from this is that we wait to be
told, by students, if thereare personal
or emotional problems that bear on
their course work and their lives in
general. On the other hand, students
work under great pressure, and sometimes, a meddling, paternalistic, intrusive hand can make a big, positive
difference. So I'm ambivalent. Most
of the time, I stay on the side of
respecting privacy, but I'm never sure

that that's the right decision."
Donna Jo Napoli, professor of linguistics, said, "You're hitting a sensitive area. Many years ago I was a

house parent in a Radcliffe-Harvard
dorm and a student committed suicide and no one had even warned me
to be on the alert for signs with her. I

felt so cheated. I felt rage. And I felt
enormous sorrow."

niors chose rooms with sophomores,
but never for junior/sophomore combinations.
According to Westphal, the averaging policy was implemented out of
fairness to therising juniorclass. She
makes a distinction between "junior
and senior space," referring to one's
own room, and "sophomore and freshman space," which is typically shared
living space. Averaging was implemented in order to "make it more
likely that juniors would have juniortype space," Westphal said. Members of the class of '9B who decided
after junior room choosing to live
with a member of the class of '99
were required to chose their room
based on their average lottery number Thursday night before the rest of
the sophomores began their selections. Contrary to rumor, no rooms
were given out in the time between
official room choosing events.

through the use of Appletalk Remote

In general, Westphal believes that
this year's room choosing process
has seemedless franticand less stressful than in previous years. "It's been
a much calmer atmosphere this year,
and people seem generally pleased
with the way the Housing Committee
has handled things." She points to the
new averaging policy as an improvement in the room choosing process.

Does Swat Have an Image Problem?
By

Julie Falk

Many members ofthe Swarthmore
community have wondered what factors could account for the relatively
low matriculation rates among students ofcolor accepted to the class of
1999. Some factors which might have
affected and will affect the decision
of students from any background to
enroll are the College's financial aid
policies, name recognition, and the
atmosphere on campus.
Financial Aid
Susan Untereker, director of Admissions, believes that "financial aid
plays a huge role" in a student's decision to attend Swarthmore. "Many
less selective schools award generous merit scholarships to these same
students, and, of course, many fine
and not-so-fine public institutions just
end up costing less. Our greatest challenge this year was to explain how a
fairly-computed need-based financial
aid package that will end up costing
the family more than those previously mentioned alternatives may still
be worth more to the student.
"Some families can be convinced;
others cannot. Some families will not
consider any loan for any reason.
Some families worry that future income or expenses may prevent the
student from continuing here..."
Said Amy Albert '9B, who is a
coordinator of a race and ethnicity
study group, "I think financial aid
really limits who comes here and
who doesn't." Marcus Pereira '99
agreed: "I've seen a lot of minority
specs who aren't able to come here
solely because the financial aid pack-

ages weren't good enough. Swat
would be more attractive to students
ofcolor if thefinancial packages were
better."
While administrators have alluded
to a survey indicating that financial
aid is not among students' primary
concerns in deciding whether to matriculate, the experiences of some
current students tell another story.

PR

&

Name Recognition

Tom Krattenmaker, director of
public relations, said, "The way I
view it, admissions is the function of
the College that most directly benefits from the fruit ofour labors in the

PR office. Every time we get a national placement, prospective students and their parents and counselors will have one more reminder that
S warthmoreis a nationally important
institution. Let's take this week's
Newsweek, for example. A story on
admissions to selective colleges has a
table showing statistics from 20
schools. Swarthmore is one of them.
The unstated message is that
Swarthmore is one of the important
schools in this country. Every
Swarthmore appearance in storieslike
this adds to our national visibility.
It's a long and gradual process, but I
believe we're making real progress,"
said Krattenmaker.
Krattenmaker described a PR-oriented task force that, among other
things, "analyzed college guidebooks
and identified the 11 most important
ones, reviewing their descriptions of
Swarthmore and suggesting ways to
correct errors and misperceptions.
That committee recommended formation of a media advisory board,
which we are now acting on. The
committee also urged efforts to highlight the accomplishments of our students and showcase the College's
unique financial strength, both of
which we're doing."
President Al Bloom said,
"Swarthmore has had for a long time
a lower public profile than several of
the institutions to whom we often
lose excellent prospective students.
This has become an institutional priority in the last three years and I have,
with Kohlberg/Trotter underway,
been able to focus a major part of my
time on this. In March I met with six
New York Times writers and [this
week] I will meet in Washington,
D.C. with more than a dozen national
media representatives. I know positive results will take time, but I am
committed to exposing the secret of

Swarthmore."
According to Krattenmaker, "The
idea is to raise his profile, and thus
the College's. I'm always amazed
when I run across someone whohasn't
heard ofSwarthmore or doesn'tknow
what a great college it is. It's a real
motivating force for me."
Attitudes on Campus

Swarthmore held two phonathons
this year, one specifically for minor-

ity students. Said Untereker, "We
continue to be concerned about the
number of underrepresented groups

on this campus. The student of color

phonathons, organized by student
leaders with the help of the admissions staff, allow us to focus on the
specific concerns of this group of
students, who may have very real
worriesabout how they wouldfit into
what is perceived as a small "white"
college. Because they are talking to
students who may have experienced
similarconcerns, they feel more positively about Swarthmore's commitment to a greater minority (and first
generation college) presence.
"First of all, they need to do a
survey of students of color that do not
come here. They do a survey of why
students in general don't come here,
but there should be one directed directly at students ofcolor.Swat would
also be more attractive if it had more
programs available such as Asian
American studies and Latin American studies," Miho Tsujii '99.
Vincent Jones '9B feels that a different variety of classes needs to be
offered for students of color. He said
that the classes dealing with the African or African American experience
deal primarily with issues of colonialism, slavery, imperialism and civil
rights. "There are no courses on ancient African civilizations," said
Jones. "Swarthmore has nothing that
would put it into Ebony."
"On a lot of campuses, there are
longer communitiesofcolor and communities that are more closely-knit
than at Swarthmore. Since Swat's
community is not as large and more
spread out, it is not as attractive to
some prospective students of color,"
saidMatthew Howard '99. "This campus is largely seen as a white campus
without very large minority communities, and so can be very intimidating for students ofcolor," said Pereira,
who hopes thatthe minority pre-frosh
weekends continue to be as successful as this year's was. "Outside of the
admissions office, the community of
color must continue to be vocal about
its needs and demand an increase in
minority enrollment."
According to Untereker, the Admissions Office has received 194 deposits from members of the future
class of 2000.

"rational and appropriate."
Swarthmore's written policies for
addressing problems with employees
are listed in a pamphlet called "Standards of Conduct." Although not
mandated by law, Swarthmore's own
policies require supervisors to go
through several stages of warnings
and "positive disciplinary" measures
with the aim of solving problems
before steps toward dismissal are
necessary. Exceptions are to be made
for only the most serious ofoffenses
such as theft of college property, use
of alcohol or illegal drugs on the job,
falsification of records, or possession of firearms.
Loeffelholtz, who worked as textbook buyer in the College Bookstore,
says she noticed one day that her
supervisor, Kathleen Grace, was
avoiding her. When Loeffelholtz
asked what was wrong, Grace responded that orders for textbooks had
been placed late. According to
Loeffelholtz, Grace yelled and said,
"You're not going to hear the end of
this."
A weekand a half later, Grace took
Loeffelholtz to the College's personnel office, where Loeffelholtz was
asked to sign a severance agreement
or accept six months probationary
status. Loeffelholtz contacted a lawyer, who advised her to sign theagreement, since being on probation could
mean getting fired at any time, and
the severance agreement entitled
Loeffelholtz to severance pay and
continuation of health benefits for a
limited amount of time.
Loeffelholtz acknowledges the fact
that many orders were late for the
spring semester, but claims that she
acted in accordance with Bookstore
policy, which required her to wait
until registration to place late orders
(those that come in after the November 15 deadline) and to hold orders
for large publishers until she had sev-

eral for a single publisher.
In addition to these factors,
Loeffelholtz believes that the snow
storm in January put the whole process back "at least a week, maybe a
week and a half." She says she approached Grace when she first became concerned about the orders being late, but Grace assured her that
there was enough time.
Loeffelholtz says she had not received any officialreprimand prior to
the incident with the orders. In fact,
she says, shehad "never had an evaluation in 5 years." Her status had gone
from wage employee to salaried employee—a change that she regarded
as positive reinforcement. In addition, she says she received a letter of
commendation from Schall.
Loeffelholtz also alleges that the
College violated her severance agreement. "I was given a severance agreement with pay and health benefits
continuing up until June," she says.
"The College did not honor this contract and took me off benefits the end
of April and severance pay effective
March 22."
Albert Decurtis, former Facilities
Management employee, worked for
the College for almost 24 years. He
says he received notice on April 1
that his employment was terminated.
The reason given was an unsatisfactory evaluation showing poor attendance and no job improvement in the
last ten years. He was offered a severance agreement, but decided not to
sign it because itreleased the College
from liability and provided only four
months of severance pay.
Decurtis says he had been told that
his attendance needed improvement,
but that was eight years ago, and he
says that his attendancehas improved
since then. Out ofhis 12 allotted sick
days per year, he says he had six
remaining when he left Swarthmore.
As for his work, Decurtis says he
saved every work order and finished
every job, even helping others when
he had extra time after finishing his
own work. He doesn't understand
how he received a negative evaluation and has not seen the actual evaluation. The last two evaluations he
saw were positive, he says.
Since Decurtis worked by himself
most

of the time, he questions the

validity of any evaluationofhis work
by his supervisor Jeff Jabco, with
whom he had very little contact. "Jeff
never talked with me on any issues
regarding work," says Decurtis. "I
was not supervised for the past year

First Person Report:
Virtually All Students
Participate in Registration Promoting the Vote
By Amy

Jessica Harbour

Maries will appear in students' mailboxes on Wednesday, May 1. After
reviewing their summaries, students
who want to make changes to their
schedules must consult with their faculty advisors once again.
Registration at Sharpies on May 6
is now only for students who have
been lotteried out of their initial
choices, who wish to register for more
than 4.5 credits, or who plan to do a
directed reading or independent study.
Department lotteries for over-enrolled classes were conducted based
on the program data. Since students
receive individual notificationof their
class schedules, Warner said, it is
"not as essential" for departments to
publicize the results of lotteries, but
added that it was up to each department as to whether to go to thetrouble
or not. The English department, for
example, sent an e-mail on Wednesday to all the students who were
lotteried out of one of the most popular courses, "The Short Story."
Student reaction to using the computerized registration program
seemed generally positive.
Erin Denney '99 said that though
she disliked the process of Registration, "pre-enrollment is awesome."
After surviving four years ofregistering at Sharpies, Elizabeth Elliott
'96 agreed. She added that everyone
she'd spoken to had liked the program, "and those who are complaining, shouldn't be."

Amid the stress of room draw and
the beginning of preparations for final exams, most students have had
one source of stress removed: registering for fall semester classes. RegistrarMartin Warner saidhe was "very
impressed" with the new computerized registration system.
Between last Friday at 2 p.m. and
midnight on Tuesday, all students
returning for the fall semester were
required to use the program, which
had an extensive help file, to register.
Warner was delighted at the number
of students who enrolled; "there were
only one or two or three students who
failed to pre-enroll" of all those returning for the fall semester, he said.
Warner also said there was only
one minor bug in the program, and it
was fixed relatively quickly. "The
program has worked very well, and
I'm thrilled with the excellent support we've had from the Computing
Center."
According to Warner, the purpose
of the new computerized registration program is to send as few students to Sharpies registration as possible; "We don't want people to go to
Sharpies if they can help it."
Today, all departments will send
class lists to the Registrar, who will
use the lists and the data from the
program to compile individual summaries for each student. Those sum-

(U-WIRE) The new wave of
Internet technology may have introduced countless resources and information sites, but hot on the heels of
this new freedom come new restrictions.
More than 100 newsgroups were
blocked from student access at the
University of Oklahoma earlier this
month for containing obscene material.
Josh Galper, press secretary at
Oklahoma University, said the censorship was based on Oklahoma state
law, which defines obscene material
as anything from pedophilia, where
children are the preferred sexual object, to bestiality, where animals are
the preferred sexual object.
Colleges all across the nation are
facing this same dilemma about
newsgroup censorship. At Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, 10
students were recently expelled from
the university for "repeatedly accessing unauthorized newsgroups," said

Some NU studentssaid they would

issue is one of First Amendment
rights.
"If you can look something up in
the library, you should be able to
look it up on your computer," said
Shannon Jamieson, a CAS sophomore. "The same qualifications
should be imposed on material censored from libraries and information
censored from student access on the

Many students said they should
not be subject to different rules than

the general public.'Teople should be
(able to) have the same amount of
access to information on the Net as
people outsideof the university," said
Benjamin Goldsmith, a CAS freshman.
Several students said Internet censorship is a tough debate. "People
should be open-minded, and (students should) be able to make decisions for themselves," said Rebecca

When Herrin Hopper (coordinator ofthe Pro-Choice Taskforce)
and I (co-chair of the Feminist

Majority)first began to meet about
the Women's Voter Project in December, we didn't know that we
would live through the infamy of
having our names appear in every
bathroom stall in the college.
We did, however, want to think
of a way to get as many people on
campus involved in the election
process as possible while building acoalition of women's groups
across ideology, race, and group
affiliation. The idea was to showcase issues of concern for a variety of women with respect to the
election process. We also hoped
to promote voter participation in
general on campus through a variety of projects involving many
people.
We were concerned that many
Swatties, despite their political
consciousness, simply do not vote.
Furthermore, we wanted to ensure
that Swatties, as voters, were able
to get information about issues
that concerned them. Through our
focus on women, we hoped to call
attention to and create action on
issues of concern to women such

as abortion, child care, and welfare.
While we're working to build a
diverse constituency, the work of
the Women's Voter Project continues. So far, we've had an All
Women over Lunch (AWOL)
meeting on the Voter gap, launched
our infamous sign campaign, and
worked at a number of campus
events to promote voter registra-

tion.
We are providing interns to a
Philadelphia group doing work on
women's issues in the presidential
election, which is putting up a
webpage this summer. We'll be
going to a workshop on "Taking
Back the Airwaves," on Thursday
at the University of Pennsylvania.
It will focus on techniques in utilizing radio talkshows and other
media to get across a political message. Finally, we'll be passing out
registration materials at Harambe
on Saturday.
Our plans for next semester include working with the Five
County Women's Coalition and
bringing a number of speakers to
campus as the election draws near.
Specific long-range plans involve
a potential debate among our congressional candidates, among
other things.

Employment Decision Controversial

"The College did not honor this contract and took me off benefits the end

Albert Decurtis, former Facilities

the College for almost 24 years. He
says he received notice on April 1
that his employment was terminated.
The reason given was an unsatisfactory evaluation showing poor attendance and no job improvement in the
last ten years. He was offered a severance agreement, but decided not to
sign it because it released the College
from liability and provided only four
months of severance pay.
Decurtis says he had been told that
his attendance needed improvement,
but that was eight years ago, and he

since then. Out of his 12 allotted sick
days per year, he says he had six
remaining when he left Swarthmore.

validity of any evaluationof his work
by his supervisor Jeff Jabco, with
whom he had very little contact. "Jeff
never talked with me on any issues
regarding work," says Decurtis. "I
was not supervised for the past year
and a half."
The "Standards of Conduct" pamphlet divides employee offenses into
three categories, group one being the
least serious and group three being
the most serious. Group one offenses
include "inadequate or unsatisfactory
jobperformance" and "excessive lateness or absenteeism." The complaints
against Loeffelholtz and Decurtis, as
they have described them, seem to
fall into group one.
When group one offenses are committed, four steps are to be taken to
try to correct the problem. The steps
—

oral reminder, written notice, suspension, and discharge—are essentially self-explanatory. Only group
three offenses are to result in immediate discharge.
Loeffelholtz claims that she has
"nothing negative" in her personnel
file, and thather "positive discipline"
did not progress beyond the "oral
reminder" stage, if that far, before
she was asked to leave. If Decurtis
improved his attendance over the past
eight years, no further actions should
have been taken against him.
Schall would not discuss the details of individual cases; nor would
Grace. Jabco could not be reached.
"We respect people's privacy," said
Schall. Director of Personnel Lee
Robinson was unable to comment on
Jhe issue in time to make Phoenix
deadlines because of a job-related
emergency.
Schall did claim that "there is another side" to the Loeffelholtz situation and reiterated that she was not
fired. He says every effort is made to
help employees in Loeffelholtz'sand
Decurtis's situation with severance
packages. "The College, in general,
is extraordinary in the care that it
takes in these areas," says Schall.
The "Standards of Conduct" pamphlet, according to Schall, is the
College's general policy but, he says,
"sometimes there may be variations
in that depending on the
circumstances." He says that it is
necessary to have disciplinary measures for employees "in order to maintain standards" and that although the
College rarely takes action against an
employee, not everyone "works out."
Schall says intermediate disciplinary actions such as reviews and discussions are often used, but whether
or not a written warning is issued
before an employee is asked to leave
depends on the individual situation.
Loeffelholtz, who believes
Swarthmore is a special place, says it
was a "privilege to work there." However, she is disappointed in what she
perceived to be the school's poor
ethics, particularly considering the
school's Quaker tradition. She says
she attends Quaker Meeting regularly and subscribes to the Quaker
belief that there is a "light in everyone—that everyone has something to
offer." She adds that she believes
there is a Quaker tendency to avoid
addressing problems in order not to
hurt people's feelings. This, she says,
makes things worse in the long run.
Decurtis says the College's actions
regarding the termination of his employment were "bad for morale" and
"morally wrong." He hopes that a
more accurate system of evaluation
will be implemented in the Facilities
Management Department.
"Swarthmore tries to think there's
something more than the bottom line,"
says Loeffelholtz, but "the College is
falling right in line with the outside
world's love affair with downsizing
and bottom-line mentality."

Keith to Remain Provost
By

Phoenix Staff

JennieKeith has been reappointed
to the position of provost through

the academic year2000-2001, President Al Bloom announced this week.
According to a College press release, the Committee on Faculty Procedures recommended that Bloom
reappoint Keith "based on enthusiastic faculty support."
Bloom expressed his "appreciation for the impact Jennie has already had on this institutionand our
confidence in the exceptional leadership that she will continue to pro-

vide."
As provost, Keith is the chief academic officer of the College, setting
general academic policy and faculty
personnel policy.
She chairs the Council on Educational Policy and the Curriculum
Committee, and is a member of several other committees. She also
"works with academic department
chairs on appointments and on aspects of personnel policy and the
academic program," according to the

Student Handbook.
Keith, an anthropologist, has served
on the College faculty since 1969.

IR Concentration May Be
Offered to Current Students
By

Jonathan Reed

The Curriculum Committee will
propose that the College allow students currently enrolled in the International Relations concentration to
continue their concentration. The
Committee will also recommend that
students through the class of 1999 be
allowed to include the International
Relations concentration as part of
their sophomore paper.
Beginning with the class of 2000,
the concentration will no longer be
offered per se, although students may
still put together a course of study
that is analogous to the concentration
or complete a special major.
Originally, the Curriculum Committee did not intend to extend the
InternationalRelations concentration

for any students not currently enrolled in the concentration because of
the faculty's contention that experience counted more in the job market
than an InternationalRelations label,
according to Provost Jennie Keith.
After hearing student concerns,
however, the Committee decided to
open the concentration to all students
currently on campus.
In addition to International Relations concentration, the Curriculum
Committee will propose the new concentrations ofLatin American Studies and Francophone Studies.
The Committee is also seeking approval to renew the Black Studies,
Women's Studies, and Public Policy
concentrations. These proposals are
scheduled to go to the faculty on May
16 and May 22.

CJC Reaches Verdict
in Harassment Case
April 22, 1996
Dear Members of the Swarthmore College Community,
On Saturday morning, April 13, the College Judicial Committee met to
consider complaints filed by two students against each other. The hearing
could not be completed in the April 13 session, and the hearing was
resumed and completed on Thursday evening, April 18. The College
Judicial Committee was convened by Associate Dean Robert Gross, and
was comprised of Associate Professor ofDance Sharon Friedler, Professor
of Religion Donald Swearer, Director of Computing and Communication Services Judy Downing, Amy Hope '97, and John Todd '97.

A female student charged a male student with Harassment, Stalking and
Disorderly Conduct; the male student charged the female student with
Harassment and Sexual Harassment. All information presented at the
hearing was carefully considered before the Committee deliberated to
reach its findings. The findings were as follows:
For the charges filed by the female student against the male student:
Not Guilty
1. Harassment:
Not Guilty
2. Stalking:
3. Disorderly Conduct:
Guilty
For the charges filed by the male student against the female student:
Not Guilty
Not Guilty

1. Harassment:
2. Sexual Harassment:

The Committee again deliberated in order to identify appropriate
sanctions for the Disorderly Conduct violation. Taking into consideration
the nature of the incident, the evidence, and the testimony heard, the
Committee decided on the following sanctions: The male student must
move to another residence hall and is not permitted in any part of the
residence hall occupied by the female student. In addition, if the female
student and the male student are both enrolled in any subsequent
semesters, the male student may not live in or be present in the residence
hall in which the female student chooses to reside. The sanction is nonnotational.

Corrections
As noted by Tom Krattenmaker,
director of Public Relations, the
correction on page two of the April
19 issue erroneously refers to a
debatebetween Michael Meeropol
and Victor Navasky. In fact,
Meeropol was debating Joyce
Milton. Navasky was there as respondent and commentator.
The second person from the left
in the front-page photo entitled
"Swedish Chefs in Sharpies" in
the April 19 issue is actually Jennifer Lyders, not Kirstin Knox.
The article on the front page of
the April 19 issue incorrectly stated
that the first Genevieve ChingWen Lee Memorial Lecture would
take place on the afternoon ofApril
19. It was actually scheduled for
the afternoon of April 22, as correctly indicated by the advertisement on page 5 of the April 19
issue.

Cheers for registrar, jeers for housing.
Swarthmore has a new registration system. You may not have even noticed;
the new, computerized process is quite similar to the old pre-registration
program we used to have. Now, however, the computerized process should
replace, to a large extent, the twice-yearly ordeal of waiting in Sharpies to get
a card signed.
We're sure youhave your own horror stories to tell of Sharpies registration:
long lines, evil clowns, and over-enrolled courses come to our minds. The
new computerized registration promises to make all that obsolete. It's easy to
use, non-threatening, efficient, and requires little time.
We applaud the administration and especially Registrar Martin Warner for
finally taking the plunge and delivering us from Sharpies.
Now, if only they'd apply the same type of thinking to room draw.
Room draw, as it was conducted this year, was nettlesome at best, mindwrenchingly agonizing at worst. Members of The Phoenix's editorial staff
attended the senior, junior, and sophomore room draws this year, and we can
attest that they were all thoroughly unpleasant.
The first complaint we have is that room choosing took place in the Field
House.TheField House is not a nice place to have lots ofpeople waiting. First,
and most galling, there are no chairs. This is a violation ofbasic courtesy: if
you're going to put over 100people into a room for two hours, there should
be a place for them to sit down. Students have to sit on the floor, pace
nervously, or maybe pull out the bleachers and sit on them. This is an

uncomfortable way to spend a couple of hours.
It was also beastly hot in there; next year, we hope that room draw will be
conducted in a building that's air conditioned. Finally, the walls and building
look depressing.A gymnasium just has no ambiance. The field house is
simply a lousy place to spend time in.
Then there are the lists of rooms. Various lists in the back of the room
supposedly showed the rooms that remained in every dorm. As rooms were
chosen in the curtained-off section of the gym, runners would come in and
check off the room.
That was the theory, at least. In practice, greed and overall nastiness caused
some Swatties to falsify the rooms list, and mark offrooms that they wanted
as already taken. Weknow of several rooms that were marked off on the board
before they were chosen; in at least one case, no one noticed the error until the

room was chosen.
This is dishonest. Luckily, this is also easy to avoid for next year. We
assume housing committee will find a better way to show the status ofroom
draw next year.
Of course, simply complaining about the problem won't help the situation.
We hope instead that Housing committee will considerdoing room draw by

computer next year.

If computerization was good for registration, why not for room draw? The
big problem we currently find with room draw is the waiting and the physical
surroundings.
A computer room choosing would eliminate both problems. The new
registration process has shown that Swarthmore's administration knows how
useful the computer can be in relieving bureaucratic anxiety for students. We
recommend that the administration look into a computerized room draw
process for next year. Anything that allows us to avoid those two hours of

Gehenna in the field house would be an improvement.

SC elections a good start, but more is needed.
Wow.
Five students are competing for a single seat on the College Planning
Committee in this spring's StudentCouncil elections. Four more are vyingfor
a single position as student observer to the Board of Managers. Student
government elections have not been contested this heavily at any time in
recent memory.
On the other hand, there's justone candidate for College Budget Committee—a pivotal position, in light of this year's financial aid debates. Only one
person is running for Charter Chair, even though the recent controversies over
chartering Black Coffee and Pacific Rim Organization might have been
expected to prompt several people with differing views to seek that seat. The
Curriculum Committee race is likewise uncontested.
The high level ofinterest in the Board and CPC races is a good sign. Council
members must devote tremendous amounts of time and effort to making
Swarthmore a better place to live and study; that so many people are,
apparently, willing to commit their energies to campus leadership roles
suggests that students are not apathetic about the state of the College.
But the low level of interest in the CBC, Charter Chair, and Curriculum
Committee races should serve as a reminder that we can always use more
student involvement on this campus. Surely students have a wide range of
views on the College's budget, on the chartering rules for student organizations, and on the curriculum. It's sad that a similarly wide range of choices
won't appear on the ballot—that voters will not have multiple options when
they select the people who will make decisions about the budget, charters and
the curriculum.
You can declare your candidacy forany position until this Sunday, April 28.
If your ideas aren't adequately represented by the candidates who have
declared already, or if you simply think you can do a better job, we encourage
you to enter the competition—the more candidates, the better.
Democracy, after all, is based upon choice. Elections exist so that people
can vote for the candidate that bests represents their viewpoints and ideas.
When only one candidate runs for a position, the election cannot very well be
expected to accurately determine popular opinion and bring a good representative to the position. Ideally, no candidate should ever run uncontested for
any student council position.
And when the election starts at 10 a.m. on Monday, please vote. Each
person who votes demonstrates that students do care about student government here and that student committee appointments do represent the desires
of the student body.

cations for their fundamental beliefs
about the world. Earlier this semester, I discussed "God" and the universe. I addressed fallacies that result
in the belief that a creator exists standing outside of existence. This week, I
will speak of government and its relationship to society and cite those
fallacies that lead to the idea that, as
a god stands outside the universe,
government stands outside society.
OK, now on to the concept of "society." A society refers to a group of
individuals and their relationships
among eachother within a geographic
area. One can describe a society only
by describing the nature of one or
more people, and the way they interact. Society, like the universe, does
not have a nature apart from the nature of its members.
So what does it mean for something to be "good for society"? The
only thing it could be is that this thing
is good for each individual member
of a society. The term "good" can
refer to living things only.
The existence ofinanimate objects
is unconditional. They may change

Schwartz '97 is a physics major.

form, but they will always exist. Living things must take actions to sustain their living, i.e., their existence.
When an organism dies it loses its
identity as a living thing, and becomes an inanimate object. Nothing
can exist in contradiction to its nature. The nature of fish is to take
oxygen out of water. Out of water,
they can not exist according to their
nature. The nature of human beings,
their primary means of survival and
flourishing, is to be rational. Hence,
good is that which is beneficial to the
life of a rational being.
Society is not alive—it consists of
living beings. Society can not "have
ills"—only the individuals in it can.
Society does not take action to sustain its own survival. Only the individual members of a society do.
Does society have a front office?
Many people like to think so. They
call it government. But government,
like any other institution, consists of
people and their relating to each other.
Hence, government is part of society.
It cannot operate outside of society
just as a creator can't operate outside
of the universe. Like any other institution, it can provide services.
For some reason, many people think
that government need not operate by
its own laws. They engage in
doublethink: they think that theft is

wrong, so it should be illegal. Yet, the
law enforcement institution can support itself by taking money from
people without their consent, i.e. by
theft. People have often suggested
that I leave the country if I am so
dissatisfied with the government.
Why must I do that, I ask? The government is not "in charge" of the
country, is it? Can I not just choose to
not deal with government, as I am
free not to trade with other institutions? I can complain about my bank,
and if I want to, I can close my accounts there. Why is the government
different? Is it not a group of people
providing services to others? Does
the government own the country?
The real issue here is that of contracts. When I open a bank account,
both parties in the relationship, the
bank and I, agree to the terms of the
relationship, and indicate our consent my signing a contract. Many of
the government's laws serve to enforce contracts that are broken. Yet, I
never signed a contract agreeing to
pay for government services, yet they
still take my money—right out of my
paycheck before I even possessed it.
It is true that I have benefited form
government services. But it is also
true that I benefit when a kid runs to
my car when I am in a traffic jam and
washes my windshield. But that does

not warrant his cracking my windshield if I refuse to pay him for services I did not request. Yet for some

reason, the government can initiate
force upon me and my property ifI do
not consent to pay for their services.
For some reason, the government is
exempt from its own laws, and to end
my relationship with it, I must pack
up and leave the country. Why is the
government like that?
It is so because people let it be so.
Many think that a government, operating outside of society, makes it possible for a society to run. Implicit is
the false idea that society is an entity
in itself, apart from individual members. These liberals think that without a government, people would not
be able to carry out ordered economic
transactions. But, in fact, free markets evolve as do the rules of grammar: gradually and spontaneously,
without coercion or central planning.
People think of the government as
if it were a college. A college's administration admits students and hires
professors to organize a school. But a
government does not organize the
market. The economic market, where
goods are produced and traded, is the
source of a government's funding.
Countries are not country clubs.

Minority Pre-Frosh Weekend Serves Valuable Purpose
By

Melinda Yin

The truest educationI havereceived
from college comes from interacting
with people from all over the world.
At both Smith College and Swarthmore, I learned the value of cultural,
racial, religious, and economic diversity. To me, learning tolerance
and the appreciation of diversity
should be the sole criterion in determining the success of a college education. This was the message I stressed
to the two pre-frosh I hosted for Minority Pre-Frosh Weekend.
Swarthmore College has a commitment to diversity and true learning, which is manifested in Minority
Pre-Frosh Weekend. This event is
not merely a symbolic gesture for the
sake ofpolitical correctness, as Chuck
Stevens suggested last week; it demonstrates to incoming students that
diversity is valued on the campus.
The Minority Pre-Frosh Weekend
provides much more than a safe space;
Yin '97 is a biology major.

it creates a mentorship between Swarthmore students and pre-frosh. New
minority students are introduced to
the existing support groups and minority communities on campus.
Support groups and culturally based

communities do not constitute segregation. I don't consider myselfa separatist because I have Asian friends,
and students invited to these weekends were not encouraged to selfsegregate. Nobody was forced to attendany of the events hosted by SAO,
HOLA, or SASS, and nobody was
forbidden to fraternize with white
students. SAO, HOLA, and SASS
also jointly threw several functions
together including an open-mike
evening and a barbecue. There were
white S watties at the barbecue, and at
other functions, who were welcomed
and certainly not told to leave or not
to speak with the minorities. In addition, the pre-frosh students attended
classes, went to concerts and games,
and partied with all of the college.

Calling the Minority Weekend "symbolic" suggests that the Pre-Frosh

defense of the recent all-campus

To the editor:
For the sake of preserving legitimacy in institutional memory, we
found it necessary to respond to the
gross inaccuracy of the Phoenix editorial on last week's Student Council-sponsored Collection, "Unwind
From the Same Old Grind" (written
prior to the event, by the way). First,
in addressing the question of whether
StudentCouncil andSAC simply "had
money to burn," you implied that
SAC poured lots of funding into the
event. The truth is, NONE of the
money for the event came from SAC.
In fact, funding came partly from
Student Council's budget, and, to a
large extent, from the Office of the
President.
Your second error stems from the
assumption that all-college collections exist solely for the purpose of
addressing campus issues. Actually,
the purpose of a collection is to gather
the general College community together, whether under the rubric of a
compelling issue, or for any other
reason. Using your criteria for a "beneficial" collection, please tell us how
past collections like the perfomances
by "Capital Steps" or Odetta, or a
Kohlberg Hall dedication, directly
address issues crippling the campus
any more than an informal collection
with stress as a theme. All of these
events were special because they
served as vehicles to promote campus unity.
Stress is a pertinent campus issue
for all sectors of the community, not
just students. Our collection (a catered affair, by the way—no "soda

First, we would like to encourage
people to be more conscientious about
trash. We also think that there should
be recycling and trash cans outside
buildings; every building should have
at least one can at each door; and the
cans need to be emptied more often if
they get full.
Our meeting school class decided
not to make posters because they
would eventually fall down and be
more trash. So we wrote this article to

put into newspapers and we will do a

play for the Meeting for those people
who do not read newspapers. Be sure
to recycle this newspaper!

massage stations, but also provided a
calm, dignified ambience through the
lovely music of the Swarthmore College String Quartet, as well as an
information table with free blood
pressure screening provided by the
Worth Health Center. Not only was
the affair well-attended in comparison to other collections sponsored
this year, but was perhaps the most
inclusive of all segments of the com-

munity, from administrators to visiting parents to employees from Environmental Services. The feedback we
received from those in attendance
was very positive.
The next time the Phoenix staff
feels the need to comment about a
particular event or issue, perhaps it
should gather some facts beforehand
in order to make a credible argument
(hmph—we always thought that a
newspaper which printed less than

the facts was technically a tabloid...).
Could its disgruntlement over the
absence of major "headline" issues at
the collection be an attempt to minimize their self-proclaimed guilt over
not adequately covering major issues
themselves?
We'd hate to think so. That would
be "just plain silly."

The Phoenix should have covered the recent debate on the Rosenbergs.
To the editor:

On April 13, 1996, more than 300
people attended a debate in the Lang
Cinema on the case of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed
in 1953 for conspiracy to commit
atomic espionage.
That The Phoenix did not cover
this event is as hard to believe as the
verdict of the case itself.
The debaters were Michael
Meeropol '64, ason of the Rosenbergs
who maintains his parents' innocence
of the charge and is co-author of We
Are Your Sons: The Legacy of Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg; and Joyce
Milton '67, who believes the verdict
was justified and is co-author of The
Rosenberg File: A Search for the

Truth. Victor Navasky '54, publisher

of The Nation, served as the commentator/respondent. The moderator
was Meta Mendel-Reyes, professor
of political science. The opportunity
to hear from this group of people
together is one this campus is not
likely to have again. The participants

in the debate were not only alumni,
but also some of the most knowledgeable people in this country on
this controversial and historic case
that is still making national headlines
more than 40 years after the trial.
This was also the first time Meeropol
had debated the validity ofthe Venona
papers.
As the newspaperofrecord for this
campus, The Phoenix is both a source
for last week's news and a historical
document for researching or understanding, in future years, what was
happening here. I know this because
I've used The Phoenix as a reference
for events from past decades. But
nowhere in the paper was there even
a follow-up article stating that the
debate occurred.
I hope this letter will bear witness
for the 16 sponsoring departments,
student organizations, and future case
researchers that the event was held
and that hundreds of people chose
that afternoon to pack themselves
into an auditorium to consider the

issues of life and death, government
influence, freedom of thought, and
all our basic civil liberties.
The only consolations one can take
from not having this event noted by
campus reporters are having seen,
firsthand, the people who attended,
who came to listen and learn; and
knowing they will go forward with a
greater understanding and knowledge
of this historic case.
Thank you.

Adding to the overall quality of the Knife and Fork band are the
venues at which they can be seen. We have seen them at The Tin
Angel, The Ethical Society, and The Samuel Adam's Brewhouse, all
in Philly, and Olde Club and Palmer Lounge here at Swat. Their
conversational lyrical and song style lend themselves to a small,
comfortable room. Some songs, however, beg for a spot ofhardwood
floor on which to dance.
At an interview following their show at the Ethical Society, Denis
and Cammy talked about their alma mater. They comforted two soonto-be alumni about the world after Swat, with no tales of postbaccalaureate stress disorders or continued bitterness. Reminiscing
about the old days, they spoke of the dingy mystery of the Olde Club,
Student Council and lauded the merits of the Spring Break Service
Project, where on a fateful spring day, Denis and Cammy's Quaker
Match was made. It goes to show, that after a short time, not all the
memories are bad ones.... However, Denis's song "Depression of
1990," a tale about wandering and jobless confusion reveals that it's
not all wine and roses either, but there's still hope.
For an all-around good time, catch the Knife and Fork band. They
come to campus fairly regularly and play in Philadelphia often. To

talkin’, lighten up, and drink your beer.” So goes the lead to
the chorus of the Knife and Fork Band’s original, “You Can’t
Get What You Want, If You Don’t Get Up and Dance.” Such
words of wisdom are to be found sprinkled throughout the K&F
band’s songs. Billed as “Down HomeMusic...That’s Really Cookin’,”
theKnife and Fork Band is stationed in Philly, headed by two former
Swatties and a Swattie sibling (almost as good).
The husband and wife duo ofDenis Murphy ’B9 and Cammy Voss
’9l complement each other in the acoustic string section with Denis
on guitar and vocals and Cammy on lead cello and fiddle. Meg
Murphy (Denis’s sister) plays concertina and sings lead and backing
vocals, while three non-Swatties play bass, drums, and lead guitar.
Although the band has changed composition several times, the
nucleusof Denis, Cammy, and Meg has remained constant, as has the
quality of fine folk music the K&F band performs.
Their music is often described as bluesy folk, but that does not do
them justice. Throw in an Irish lick or two, some John Prine, then
some Billy Bragg, and you have pure Knife & Fork. On their most
recent release, a three song album, there is the catchy but morose
“Depression of 1990,” a 6/8 wonder with dark overtones. “Daze of
OurLives” features their more rock n roll side, with Meg Murphy on
some very pleasingly lilting lead vocals. The last song on the album,
“Almost Friday Night,” accents their Irish flavor with several flowing

ofclosure and rebirth.

"The students were aroused with difficulty
at that dead hour of the night, but they were all
rescued without accident. The young men
soon, of themselves, formed a line...thus saving most of their effects, and some of the
College furniture, including all the mattresses
of the west end, which they threw out of the
windows, and which furnished fairly comfortable lodging on the front lawn later in the
night, after the excitement and toughest glare
of the fire had somewhat subsided. The young
women faired worse [the wind blew the fire
towards the women's side], and their trunks
and clothing were very generally destroyed."
By 1 a.m., falling timbers madeit unsafe to
enter the building at all. Fire companies arrived from Philadelphia around 4 a.m. to find
the building "a mass of smoldering ruins."
Except for the Friends' Historical Library on
the second floor, with its fireproof floor and
ceiling, everything but the stone walls of the

building was completely destroyed. Nonetheless, breakfast was served on Parrish lawn
at the usual hour of 7:30 a.m.,, thanks to the
generosity ofthe Chester Military Academy.
The Board of Managers were summoned
by telegraph. By nightfall, they had rented
houses in Media as a temporary home of the
college, and classesresumed two weeks later.
All but three of the students returned to class,
and the college had to turn down a number of
applications for admission for lack of space.
The Board began a campaign for funds to
rebuild Parrish, somewhat more fireproof,
and "in such manner as to allow the utilization of the fourth floor for dormitories."
Commencement that June was held in an
unplastered, still incompletely rebuilt Parrish
Hall, but classes resumed in Parrish only two
weeks later than usual that September—on
September 25, 1882, which marked the first
anniversary of the fire. Publication of a school
newspaper began while the college was still
located in its temporary Media home.It called
itself The Phoenix, because it rose up from
the ashes—all the way up to its current home
on the fifth floor of Parrish.

In your room, it's a serene scene of

caught off-guard by a 500-pound lion
that chases the fleeing gazelle downand
rips out its jugular. Hyenas soon follow.

nothing less than perfect. And "Welcome to the Jungle,"
though disconcerting out of a performance context, features a believable Axl Rose impression by Eric Shamblen
'97, as well as an immensely funny interlude by Evan
Dorn '96 and Tsina.
On the whole, if rock-pop is your thing, Doppler
Gang's latest deserves your attention.
After the success of theirlast album, 1994's Something's
Afoot, Sixteen Feet might understandably have stuck
with whatworked: catchy oldies and lighthearted, simple
harmonies. To their credit, they didn't. Sasquatch, their
latest effort, is considerably more ambitious in its complexity than Afoot and, especially for thetrained a cappella
ear, more enjoyable as a result.
The diversity of songs on this album is notable in itself:
artists varying from Dave Matthews to the musical "Hair"
to Sting to Prince are represented here.
But the ambition lies more in the type of songs that are
set to vocal arrangements: again and again, the Feet
arrangers forge coherent a cappella out of songs that
seemed unlikely candidates for transposition.
Sting's "Mad About You," arranged and led by Scott
Friesen '97, is a prime example. The keyboard section at
the beginning, the backing vocals under Friesen's solo,
and senior Dominic Sagolla's jam session/interlude are
all true to the spirit of the original, and yet nothing calls
attention to itself; the unity of effect is considerable. Add
to that Friesen's anguished tenor voice—one of many
outstanding individual voices in Feet—and the piece as a
whole rivals Sting's version in its power. Similarly impressive is their rendition of "Cantina Band": almost
,

entirely instrumental, it is a cappella arrangement at its
most versatile.

As is ever the case, the humor value in Feet songs
provides a large part of their appeal. Ken Williams'
version of "King of Spain" and Jove Graham '96 on the
solo for "Mighty Mouse" manage to be amusing rather
than simply ludicrous; similarly, "Hair" becomes funny

simply because it seems to be taken so seriously. (Lines
like "Oh, say can you see my eyes—if you can, then my
hair's too short" require a sort of deadpan effect to be
effective, and Feet, ever the performance group, masters
that effect.)
Ultimately, Sasquatch succeeds where other albums
might fail because of its precision; its few musical mistakes are not apparent to the casual listener. Songs like
"Rhythm of the Night" might, in the hands of a lesser
group, have been catchy but not especially musically
compelling; Feet's version is both. "Lonesome Road"
illustrates the value of a group's being together almost in
its entirety for four solid years: the harmonies blend
perfectly, and the individual backup parts sound like a
piano chord rather than a collection of voices. "Ants
Marching," a complicated song featuring a whole range
of secondary sound effects, manages not to distract from
or overwhelm seniorKen Williams' solo part; the bridge
in particular shows a skillful arranger's touch.
The overall musical excellence of Sasquatch makes it
easier to enjoy the songs, whether for humor or pathos.
The current version ofFeet is among the better collegiate
a cappella groups around; no one who appreciates good
music should pass up their latest.

Renowned

expatriate Chinese vo
calist, composer, and performance
artist, Liu Sola will present a solo
a cappella performance called "The Music of Voice," Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Tarble All-Campus Space.
While she might be an unfamiliar name,
many Americans have already seen or
heard Sola. Sola represented China at the
Seoul Song Festival for the 1988 Olympics. She has also collaborated withmany
artists to create a distinctive style of world
music with Chinese roots.
The New York Times in 1995 described
her performance as "rich and expressive."
New York Press in 1995 described her as
"the only Chinese artist who'd qualify to
play the New Orleans Jazz Festival."
Not only is she an impressive performer,
Solais also composes her own music She
graduated from the Central Conservatory
of Music in Beijing, the most prestigious
conservatory in China.
Eclectic is probably the best word to
describe her works, which range from
symphonies and piano pieces to rock opera and a cappella pieces. Sola has won
several major national awards for a piano
piece and her film music. Sola has also

produced many pieces of modern dance
music and a new album called "Blues in
the East," which has remained in the Top
10 of the New World Music chart. Her
most recent work, "China Collage," is a
concert piece for vocal and pipe.
As if singing and composing have not
filled her busy schedule, Sola also writes
novels. Her first novella, You Have No
Choice, which reflects the spirit of the
Chinese avant garde, won the 1988 Chinese Novella Award. It outraged party
traditionalists and became "cult" material
for those opposing old orthodoxies. Her
most recent novel, Chaos and All That is
the first work of Chinese fiction written in
exile. Since herarrival in theUnited States
in 1987, she has been a visiting writer at
the International Writing Program at lowa
University, has lectured at Harvard and
Cornell and in lowa, Berkeley, Portland,
and Minneapolis, and is now residing in
New York.
Sola is giving a talk about her writing at
the campus center of Bryn Mawr College
at 1:45 p.m. on Tuesday.
Her performance is sponsored by Asian
Studies, the Chinese Section of the Department of Modern Languages and Literature, the President's Office, Theater
Studies, IC, and SAO.

Hey

gang—did you know that Swarth
more has its very own radio station?
No, really, it's true. It's called WSRN,
and it's at 91.5 FM on your radio dial.
According to the WSRN website, their
goal is, "to provide outside listeners with
programming that expands the range of listening options available to radio audiences. ..to
provide shows that are not found on other
stations." Sounds cool, doesn't it?
The only problem with WSRN's philosophy is that some people (ahem) may not be
willing to give the station a chance just because the bands it plays are obscure. However, lack of reputation does not necessarily
equate to lack of quality. Often you can find
a song (and even, sometimes, an entire album) that is really quite tasty.
WSRN features rock, rap, blues, classical,
and even children's programming. The DJs
who play rock have a special burden: 75
Eric Shamblen '97 will be reviewing two CDs

reading satisfaction.

percent of the music they play must be off of
the rock playlist, selected each week by station rock directors.
This playlist is one of the main sources of
controversial obscurity, and so, in an effort to
bring light into the darkness, this column will
review two randomly selected albums from
the playlist, and ask the question: Sucks or
Tasty?

Union Local 282:
Wormed by Leonard (1988).

Thinking Fellers

The main thing you should know about
TFUL 282 is that it places a very heavy
emphasis on loud feedback. However, they
do not tend to be as out of tune or feature as
much atonal screaming as some of the worse
bands you might hear (like, say, Nirvana) and
they have quite a few songs that actually have
a pretty good foot-tappin' funky beat.
The high point ofthe album is a song titled
"Nipper," which is about the walk of every
dog's dreams. Sick and disgusting, but really
funny. Sample lyrics: "I couldn't imagine
what was making him so homicidally agitated, when from around the corner appeared
the postman. Without so much as a second's
hesitation, Nipper lunged." I highly recommend this song.
Other decent tracks include "Misfits Park"
and "Mr. Tuna's Big Old Place." Sadly, the
album also features many annoyingly noisy
and tuneless tracks such as "KLTX" which

are best avoided. This week the “Weird”
Award goes to “Fat Christmas,” which features the lyrics: “Christmas is here. It’s very
fat. And the lights are all very fat too. And all
the presents are very fat also.”

Various Artists: Disturbed (1995).
One of WSRN’s several compilations by
New Zealand artists. Generally mellow (or
painfully boring, call it what you like) and
amateurish. Sample lyrics (from “Starfish,”
one of those songs where there is no doubt
why the band has remained unknown): “I’d
like to be/A fish in the sea/A starfish I’ll be/
Come swim with me.” Get the picture?
High point of the album: “Front Row Centre,”by GraemeDownes. Pop with an orchestra and a driving undercurrent. This band
would not be terribly out of place on some of
the commercial “alternative rock” stations.
There are a couple of other decent tracks.
One in particular, “Gilt,” would be pretty
good if it weren’t for thevocalists. Generally,
though, an album best forgotten as soon as

possible.
Have we learned anything from this random sampling from the murky shadows of
the rock world? Only that sometimes you can
find diamonds in the rough, and sometimes
you justfind large chunks of stinky cheese. In
any case, WSRN deserves a chance. Give it a
listen. After all, you came to college to experiment, right?

Movie Committee Brings Better Breakfast Selection to Swat

and

Jonathan: Breakfast bar all weekend!
Jessica: Nonono, that's not it...the breakfast is in Dupont this weekend, not Sharpies!
Jonathan: Mmm...french toast sticks.
Anyway, that's right, folks. It's the breakfast
theme movie weekend. We have two classics
which should make you pleased.. .unless you
really hate that song by Deep Blue Something.
Jessica: I really hate that song. But, nevertheless, I'm totally excited about this
weekend's first movie, so excited that I just
can't hide it. Yes, here come the 805... it's
"The Breakfast Club!"
This 1985 movie is a complete 80s classic—the most brat packed movie of the brat
pack movies, the most John Hughes of the
John Hughes's (writer/director, "Sixteen
Candles," "Ferris Bueller," etc.). "The Breakfast Club" is an American cultural icon.
Okay, for the ten percent or so of you out
there who haven't seen it, here's a brief plot
summary: five high school students have to
"sacrifice an entire Saturday for whatever it
is [they] did wrong", and spend the day in the
school library together. At first, they see each
other, as does the school and the world, "in
the simplest terms and the most convenient
definitions... abrain, an athlete, a basketcase,
a princess, and a criminal". However, as they
get to know each other over the course of the
day, they realize there is a lot more to each

one of them then these generalization permit.
You know the faces of the actors in this—

song, okay?

Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Ally

Well, not to get that painful (yet catchy) song
stuck in your head, but I kinda liked it. Kinda.
This movie is a Blake Edwards flick, whom
you'll probably rememberfrom the Pink Panther(InspectorClouseau) movies. Also 10,"
"Blind Date," "Skin Deep" (which put glowin-the-dark condoms on the market), etc. If
you know any of these movies, you know
they have a certain style: childishly funny,
cute romance, borderline offensive stereotype humor. This movie is no exception. It
has that early seventies feel...that kinda
whacked-out, someone's been doing drugs
while writing a romantic comedy feel. This
movie was done in 1961, which puts it WAY
ahead of its time. Whether that's a good thing
or not, I'll leave that to you to decide.
Okay, the summary. This plot starts off on
the right foot, in my opinion, with two actors
you might just not imagine together. George
Peppard (Hannibal from the A-Team") plays
Paul Varjak, a male prostitute (well, he's a
paid "kept" man by this rich married woman)
who wants to be a writer. He moves in above
the lovely Holly Golightly(played by Audrey
Hepburn...if you don't know who she is, go
away) who is an escort for rich, older men.
Holly has forgotten her past, and is trying to
find a rich husband who can help support her
and her brother once her brother leaves the
army. When Varjak meets the eccentric
Golightly,there is an instant spark that makes
him change his lifestyle, and gets him trying

Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd
Nelson—they're all there, playing the types
of roles they play best. There's also Paul
Gleason doing a great job as the incredibly
slimy Principle Vernon ("Does Barry
Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?")
The script of this movie—especially the
rapid fire lines and banter, is its real strength.
Judd Nelson's Bender is hilarious, and his
insults have become part of our language...
almost. You know, "Well, that's sort of social, demented and sad, but social."
Trust me, this is a good movie. Okay, so the
plot is a little contrived and the characters a
little extreme, but the overall spirit of the
movie, along with a great script and
soundtrack, make it extremely enjoyable. If
you've seen this movie, see it again... it never
gets old. And besides, I'm sure Dupont will
be a big party for it, just like when they
showed "Footloose." If you haven't seen it
yet, definitely don't miss this opportunity.
"The Breakfast Club" is a fundamental part
of American pop culture, in my opinion, up
there with "Star Wars," Captain Crunch and
Pixie Stick sandwiches.
Jonathan: Why do I feel like I should
stand, salute the American flag, and sing the
national anthem?
Jessica: You are such a neo-maxi-zoomdweebie. Please don't sing the National Anthem or the damn Deep Blue Something

to change hers.

Jonathan: Okay, "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

"

There are a few things that bother me about
this movie. First, when speaking of love,
there's talk of people "owning" other people.
Seems to be a main theme. This bugs me in
general, but that might just be a personal
thing. Then the Asian man stereotype that's
played off of, reminded me of Kato from the
Pink Panther series, and how poisoned my
childhood was. But I'm being very Swattie.
"Breakfast at Tiff any' s" is a cute, fun movie.
Jessica might have fallen asleep during it, but
1... kinda liked it. If you're in the mood to see
a nice, cute movie, check this out.
Jessica: Hey, I was tired... it wasn't really
the movie. But now at least we can't say
"that's the one thing we've got."
Jonathan: I thinkwe'd probably be shot if
we did say it. Have a great weekend!

Tom

Holland, also known as Director of
Publications Tom Krattenrnaker,
stands out amongst the crowd of
yuppified ex-hippies rediscovering their folk

roots in sappy ballads. With a biting sense of
humor and wink at the vicissitudes of life,

Holland's arrangements with the guitar and
harmonica fall into the harder side of folk.
One's first reaction to Holland's use ofhis
voice might be to recall Dylan songs, but look
deeper and you'll find riffs on The Byrds,
Roger McGuinn, and James Taylor.
I really enjoyed the controversial "Blue
Patriot" and the catchy chorus of "Time Now
Coming." Hip black-jean wearing Holland
will probably wake you up out ofyour end of
the week blues.
A self-taught musician who took up the
harmonica a few years ago when it was given
to him as present, Holland has come a long
way since the basement band days of his
youth. He has played at the TLA, Border's
Bookstore, the Tin Angel, and Paces Pub
Night.
Holland will perform this Saturday at the
Jumping Cow at 8:00 p.m. Cover charge is
$3.00. For more information call 543-8805.

Crum Regatta Enjoys Nice Weather for a Change Men's Tennis Beats Fords,
By Tony

Sturm

The 1996 Crum Regatta came and
went in fashion last Saturday, and for
the first time in recent memory,
Mother Nature smiled upon the contestants and spectators.
Downright balmy weather and clear
skies resulted in great conditions for
the annual hundred-yard race down
Crum Creek.
Sixteen water craftenteredthe race.
Many employed innovative and creative designs. Entries ranged from
the SWE Seaship, constructed from
packing tape and hundreds of plastic
Coke bottles, to the Unleavened
Wonder, known as the Matzah Ship
by those on the shore. One word
could be used to describe this year's
competition: duct tape.
Nat Pearre '9B emerged the victor
in this year's competition, as hisJioat,
The Yak, glided past the rest of the
entrants to the finish line, well ahead
of the competition. Pearre's boat was
an impressive woodand plastic kayak,
made singlehandedly by the its skipper. Pearre used duct tape in its construction.
The impressive-lookingkayak was
made out of sheets of plastic and

propelled internal paddle. The Jolly
Crodger used duct tape.
"People were really creative," said
Cupples. "I was really impressed with
how innovative many of the craft
were."
Other water craft of note included
a boat in the shape of a giant violin, a
boat powered by a string tied to a tree
downstream, a dragon boat equipped
with a Supersoaker wielding junior,
and a big trash-container-turned-flotation device that crept downstream.
There were obviously differing
amounts ofenergy put into the race.

strips of wood. Pearre noted that he
used a "sort of traditional construction," and that although it took him
three weeks and about thirty hours to
make, "It was really a labor of 10ve....
It was so much fun to do."
A relatively close second in the
race was the Pink Torpedo, built and
navigated by Steve Lauback '96 and

John Freeman '96. They were no
threat to Pearre, but left the rest of the
field behind. Their boat was built out
ofmaterials that looked suspiciously
like the insulation being installed in
Trotter. They also used duct tape.
These two boats left the rest of the
entrants in their wakes, taking advantage of the sheer light weight construction of their boats, while gliding
along the surface of the creek.
The Alumni Relations Office,
which sponsors the event, was very
happy at this year's showing. "I
thought things wentreally well," said
Courtney Cupples '9B, who interns at
the office. "Usually the weather has
been rainy and cold beacuse it is
usually held earlier."
The organizers were ready for a
potential repeat oflast year's weather,
as coffee and tea were trucked down
to Crum Meadow in case of rain,
snow or cold temperatures.
Several other ships took home trophies. Crew members Nick Lehmann
'97, Alec Zimmer '97, and Duleesha
Kulasooriya '97, won Best Engineered with their boat Jolly Crodger,
a solid looking craft with a crank-

cling-bin-and-throw-it-into-the-river
effort, students took it to varying degrees.
Girl Juice crew members Courtenay Dunn '97, Sonya Smallets '96,
Molly Jacobs '97, and Emily Mott
'97 won Most Artistic because of a
musical accompaniment to their boat.
Allthough they did not finish in the
top three, the crew treated everyone's
ears to some delightful fluting and
wore flower crowns in their hair.
There was spirited competition this
year for the glory of last place, as
several ships stayed in port well after
the initial airhorn. These boats were
fighting for the coveted horse's ass
trophy and the money that came with
it. Although some teams managed to
not yet have started even after the rest
of the ships had crossed the finish
line, the organizers decided (and rightfully so) to give the award to the team
that actually tried but finished last.
Danny Barrick '9B and Travis Beck
'96, riding aboard The Unrequited 11,
won that dubious distinction.
"We were just out to have a good
time," Barrick said. "Travis and I, we
were trying to finish, to do as well as
we could, but our skills weren't up to
par." That particular craft was made
from discarded insulation collected
from the Kohlberg/Trotter construction site, and lots of duct tape.

Then Falls to Princeton
By Barry

This past week, the Swarthmore
Men'sTennis Team tried to continue
their four match winning streak
against the Fords of Haverford and
the Tigers of Princeton. With the season winding down, both matches were
very important for ranking purposes
and preparation for the Regional
Tournament.
On Tuesday, the Fords made the
long, 15 minute trip down the Blue
Route to face Swat's tennis team.
There is an intense rivalry between
the schools, no matter what sport itis.
Although Swat had never lost to Haverford on the tennis courts, the Fords
were not a team to be taken lightly.
With the sun in the sky, and refreshments for the loyal fans, the two
teams tookthe court for doubles. John
Derdarian '97 and Greg Emkey '99
kept their Division 111 undefeated
streak at #3 doubles alive by outclassing their Haverford opponents
8-3. Unfortunately, Swat's first two
doubles tandems, Barry Mook '96
and Roger Werner '9B at #l, and Ed
Ernst *9B and Nick Slimack '99 at #2,
were less successful as they were
defeated 8-4, and 9-7, respectively.
Despite a 1-0 deficit, the Bandits
kept their chins up and fought courageously at all positions. At # 1,Mook
won 6-3, 6-3, while George Khalaf
'96 struggled against the 1995 regional Rolex runner-up, 6-2, 6-2.
Werner continued the heroics of the

Last Saturday the women's rugby
team demolishedYork college 20-0.
Deciding that they did not intend to
run side to side and up and down the

slanted field in the humid weather,
the team went straight for the try
zones. In the process they played an
excellent game of rugby.
"Let's use this opportunity to play
our own game, cleanly" said Jen
Philpott '97 early in the first half,
when it became apparent that Swarthmore would dominate the game. "We
only need three people going into
rucks, because we're winning every
one of them" commented Kelly Shannon '96.
It only took three people to push
the majority of their team down the
field. For that reason forwards were
anxiously waiting behind the back
lines for the ball to come out and
giving them support.
Alicia Pierce '97 scored the first
three points off of a penalty kick,
which was closely followed by Andrea Barnett's '97 try. After making
the conversion kick, Swarthmore led
10-0.
Swarthmore's scrums crushed
York. Although there was a little
wheeling, York was driven back every time. Anita Pedraza '96 successfully hooked theball back every time,
whether it was Swarthmore's put-in
or not.
Shannon was the eight man this

game and had the opportunity to score
a unique try. After driving in front of
the try line, she held the ball between
her feet and proceeded to hop to the
try line, pick it up, and touch it down
for another five points.
In the second half of the game, the
referee was more strict on the calls.
Swarthmore had three or four penalties called on them. York continued
to lose the ball in the scrums.
York was soon tired of getting
trampled on, but Swarthmore continued to play consistently and kept York
from scoring. The last try was awarded
to Swarthmore with a penalty called
on York for obstructing the try zone.
The B-side demolished York as

the forwards hesitated a little in the
rucks, they still managed to win just
about every one of them. Lisa
Hilgendorf '99 was consistently ready
to tackle whoever had the ball. Beth
Wiles '9B, a forward prop, played a
strong game as well.
Christine Flinn '97 played an amazing half of the A-side gameand a full
B-side game, showing that her foot
was unstoppable. In addition to hitting all four conversion kicks and
scoring a try, she kicked the ball
consistently and accurately throughout the entire game.
Swarthmore is now 3-1 -1. Tomor-

row, they will play at the University
of Delaware. It should be a great
gameand definitely one of the toughest of the season.

game winning streak at #4. Both Ernst
and Slimack also prevailed, leading
to a 5-2 Swarthmore victory.
On Thursday, the tennis team traveled to Princeton, New Jersey, to
play the strong Division I tennis team
of Princeton University. The Tigers
proved to be too much at the first two
doubles teams, beating Mook and
Werner at #l, and Ernst and Slimack
at #2. Derdarian and Emkey at third
doubles made their Princeton opponents sweat, but lost in a tie-breaker,
9-8. In the singles action, Mook, at
#l, played a respectable match against
one of the nation's top Division I
singles players, but fell 6-2, 6-0.
Khalaf, at #2 singles, fell once again
to Gog, the true tiger from Princeton,
6-0,6-2. At 3 singles, Werner fought
hard, but was unable to overcome his
opponent. At 4 singles, the 12 match
win streak of Derdarian was halted
by his Princeton counterpart in a well
played match. Slimack and Emkey,
at 5 and 6 respectively, were also
unable to pull out a victory.
The Swat win against Haverford
secured the team's position as the
number three seed at the upcoming
Regional tournament in Binghamton,
NY. But before this important tournament, the Garnet will have a chance
to prepare by playing Penn this Saturday, and Bloomsburg next Thursday. As co-captain Khalaf said, "We
are continuing to play well in all of
our matches. I am confident in our
chances to do some damage at the
Regionals."

New Lacrosse Coach
Changes Team's Outlook

Women's Rugby Tops York

Coach Pat Gress is the new parttime men's lacrosse coach at
Swarthmore College, and already he
has made a lasting impression on the
team and individualplayers. A graduate of North Harford High School in
Maryland, Gress left Towson State in
Baltimore with a degree in History in
secondary education. He played lacrosse through college receiving the
James Saxson Memorial Award for
Outstanding Leadership, and went
on to play club lacrosse for two years.
Gress began his coaching career in
1991 at his alma mater and remained
there until 1993. After leaving, he
took a part-time coaching position at
Franklin and Marshall for the 1994
and 1995 seasons. The 1996 season
brought him to Swarthmore.
These facts are very impressive.
However, itis in talking with players
that one sees what this coach has
really donefor Swarthmore athletes.
I spoke to one player about Coach
Gress to find out how the players felt
about the third coach they have had
within four years.
"For me personally, he changed
my whole attitude about sports at
Swarthmore. Everyone loves him. So
many people came out this season.
He makes the game fun and cares
about the players. He's the kind of
coach that can turn the whole program around."
Gress was further described as a
"smart coach" who was able to play
with a limited number of men against
larger teams and still keep up the
men's morale. He was also not afraid
to take risks, changing player posi-

tions halfway through the season with

great confidence and success.
When asked about his opinion of
his season at Swarthmore, Coach
Gress responded with the same enthusiasm as his players. He was very
happy with the season so far. Although wins have been few, the men
have made dramatic improvement.
“The guys worked real hard for me
and stayed positive throughout the
season. That’s what is important. The
job is really enjoyable because of the
quality people I work with. I’ve
learned a lot.”
The votes are in—one cannot say
enough about this coach. He has
gained great respect and trust from
his players both on and off the field.
Hopefully, Coach Gress will remain
a permanent fixture in the world of
Swarthmore Athletics. After all, “he
won’t accept 99%.”

Men's Rugby Takes Third at Temple Tournament
By Tony

Sturm

For the second straight year, the
Swarthmore Men's Rugby Team
headed to Temple to play in a tournament against some of the best teams
in the Eastern Pennsylvaina Rugby
Union. For the second straight year,
they drew formidable University of
Delaware in the first game. For the
second straight year, they lost in the
last minute. And, for the second
straight year, they were able to regroup and win the third-place consolation bracket.
The Evil Buzzards have come out
strong in most every game this season, scoring in the first few minutes
of all but one. Jason Dougal '96 kept
this tradition alive, scoring very early
in the game off a penalty from five
meters out.

After that, the Buzzards became
very stagnant, and could not get their
offense to click. Delaware answered
with a try later in the half, and the
conversion made it a 7-5 score at

halftime. Swarthmore was unable to
get revved up for the second half, but
was able to keep Delaware off the
scoreboard. With ten minutes left,
Guy Danilowitz '96 converted a penalty kick to give the Buzzards an 8-7
lead.
Swat was clinging to this lead, trying to eke out the victory, when lightening struck for the second straight
year. With one minute left in the
match, Delaware was deep into their
own territory and it was looking like
the Buzzards would escape with the
win. But the ball came out of a ruck
and outto the Delaware inside center,
who was a fine ballplayer. He was
able to beat two Swarthmore backs
and outsprint the rest of the team
seventy meters into the tryzone for
the 14-8 win. It was a tough loss for
Swat, who had listed first place in this
tourney as a preseason goal.
Swarthmore was down after this
game, but the team knew that the
afternoon was not over. They had to
regroup and play Temple, the tourna-

hosts, who had just lost to the
eventual tournament winners, West
Chester. This was expected to be an
ment

evenly matched game, but Swarthmore was clearly the better team.
Once again, Swat came out firing
on all cylinders, and the team scored
early and often, putting the game out
of reach by halftime. Swat's game
was juststronger than that of Temple,
and the scoreboard showed it.
Swarthmore won this gameby a score
of 31-5, buoyed by two tries from
Ricky Phillips '96 and single scores
from Alek Stall '9B, Mark Pletcher
'96, and Dougal. The try by Dougal
was his ninth of the campaign, setting
a single-season record for the Buzzards.
"We played a good game," said
Jason Sturm '97 on the sidelines after
the match. "Not a great game, but a
good game."
This victory propelled the Buzzards to the consolation final, which
was considered third place in this
tournament.

Here the team played St. Joseph's,
a team with a big but slow forward
pack. The Buzzards were not intimidated, however, and played tough.
Swat scored first again, on the first
of two tries by Pletcher. Pletcher took
a fine pass from Dan Schwan '97 and
touched down the try. Although
Dougal added a try, St. Joe's was able
to keep it close, as they put up 14
points in the first period and
Swarthmore was unable to convert
on any of their conversions.
But in the second half, St. Joe's
could not keep up. At the end of this
long day, the Buzzards were just in
better shape. Eric Ellingson '96,
Sturm, and Phillips added tries for
Swat, and the only remaining question was ifthey would convert any of
their kicks. Danilowitz answered yes,
scoring the deucewith no time left to
give the Buzzards a 32-14 victory.
"We scored early, they played us
tough, and we were worried," said
Chaz Teplin '96. "But when the second half came, they were out of gas."

13-5 in a lackluster performance
However, the Lady Garnet got revenge in the Bryn Mawr game; they
massacred the Mawrters 20-6. With
only one game left in the season,
Swarthmore's record is now 7-5.
Heading into the F&M game,
Swarthmore carried momentum from
two
decisive wins against
Muhlenberg and Widener. Samantha
Peltz '97 said that those two games
"offered the opportunity to hone
skills, run offensive plays and gointo
Saturday's match with some confidence."
When Saturday came, the
Swarthmore's performance was "not
at its peak." True, they lost one of
theirkey offensive players, Lia Ernst
'97, to the MCATs but they seemed
to also have forgotten the basics, in-

eluding throwing and catching. In
that loss, they made eight blocks,
three interceptions and 24 turnovers.
They committed 24 fouls and collected 51 groundballs.
Goalies Jill Maybee '96 and Jaclyn
Coutts '99 made a total of 13 saves:
Maybee had 11 and Coutts added
two.

Swarthmore dominated the entire
Bryn Mawr game. Swat collected 47

groundballs, six blocks, one interception, 16draw controls and 14turnovers. By halftime, The Lady Garnet
was leading 13-1.
That remarkable performance continued throughout the second half.
When Maybee left the game during
the second half, the Mawrters had
found the back of the net only once.
Swarthmore continued the barrage of
goals in the second half, ending in a
20-6 win.
In the game, Lara Ewens '96 and
Holly Baker '99 collected hat tricks
in addition to their respectively two

Men's Lacrosse Snaps Losing Streak
By

Pat Donaghy

Heading into the final showdown
against Haverford, the men's lacrosse
team won their first game in the last
seven tries by defeating Widener 119 Wednesday. Widener was the clear
cut favorite, having demolished a
team that had defeated Swarthmore
earlier on in the season. The win
showed just how much improvement
the men have made over the course of
the season. The Garnet win brought
the record for the week to 1-1, following a defeat at the hands of

Gettysburg.
Last Saturday, the Garnetfinished
their string of playing against nationally ranked schools by falling to the
Bullets 21-6. Many bad signs doomed
the Garnet before the game even began. The team bus got lost on the way
to the game, arriving with not much
timefor the Garnet to get loose. Two
starters, following in a car, also got
lost and did not show until the national anthem. Finally, one player

swore he saw vultures circling the
field just before game time.
After the team finally organized
together, the unpreparedness showed
in the first quarter, as the Garnet fell
behind 9-0. The athletic skills of the
52 man squad was just too much for
the Garnet to handle, as five more
scores led to a 14-0 halftime deficit.
But, for the rest of the game, with
Bullet starters still playing parts of
the third quarter, the Garnet held their
own. Once again, the Garnet never
gave up, earning the respect ofBullet
fans by tying the Bullets in the second half, not counting a "phantom"
goal by the opponents. Will Craig '96
finished with three goals.
The Garnet attempted to carry the
momentum into the Widener game, a
game the Garnet figured it could finally win. After spotting the Pioneers
two man-up goals, the Garnet tied the
game at two at the end of the quarter.
The game saw five ties and four lead
changes overall in a very tight contest. Just before the half, defenseman

Nick Milligan '96 made an outstanding play by scooping up a ground ball
and racing the length of the field,
drawing a defenseman, and feeding a
wide open Erik Griffin '96, who
scored to give the Garnet its first lead
at 4-3. Widener tied the game just
before halftime.
As the momentum of the Garnet
picked up in the second half, the trash
talk of thePioneers mysteriously vanished. The score was tied at six when
Andy Place '96 made a turnaround,
fadeaway jump shot for a goal to give
the Garnet a leadit would never relinquish. Adam Macßeth '99 soon followed with a bounce shot on a fast
break to extend the lead.
In the fourth quarter, the Garnet
dominated, using Ben Seigel '96 to
control the ball for most of the rest of
the way. In addition, goalie Elijah
Porter '99 made several outstanding
saves in the quarter. Place and Kevin
Frazer '96 scored the final goals for
the Garnet. Place also won the last
three faceoffs, ensuring victory.
Defensively, Tom Hooper '96,
Charles Horton '96, and Milligan
played overall great games. Erik
Johnson '9B had a great game clearing the ball. But it was the coaching
and scouting job by Coach Pat Gress
