McCabe exhibits the
BY MARIA KHIM

mkhiml@swarthmore. edu

In June 2005, WilliamLieberman '43, a well-known curator for the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, passed away and donated his extensive personal collection to the college library. Sarah Burford 'OB has
been working on theLieberman Collection since last spring
semester and is putting on an exhibition at McCabe Library
that begins next week.
The opening reception for the exhibition titled "Modern
Musings: Treasures from The Lieberman Collection" will
take place next Tuesday afternoon on Oct. 30 in the McCabe
Library Lobby. There will also be a short lecture presented
at the reception by visiting art history professor Graham
Bader introducing the collection. Anne Strauss, a curator at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art is also planning to attend
the event to view the collection.

"This collection is like a snapshot
of his era and the culture of
the 20th century."
Sarah Burford 'O9
Some items that will be on display as part of the exhibition include original prints signed by Joan Miro, a handmade artist book with an etching signed by Picasso and orig-

inal lithographs by Andy Warhol.
"In the past, we've had many exhibits of traveling collections from outside institutions and libraries," Outreach
Instruction Librarian Pam Harris said. "My goal is to have
more student-curated exhibits and more exhibits that are in
some way related to the curriculum and that showcase more
of the library holdings."
Burford initially became involved in this project as part
ofher Mellon internship and first came up with the idea to
have an exhibition. She stayed as an intern throughout the
summer to work on the project. "When I interviewed for the

Mellon internship, they told me about the collection and I
thought it'd be really exciting," Burford said. "I credit the
Mellon internship program and the McCabe staff for giving
me a lot of freedom with this and letting me use all the different resources. The collection is like a snapshot ofhis era
and the culture of the 20th century."
The Lieberman Collection includes approximately 6,000
items mainly consisting ofbooks on various subjectsincluding art, biographies, art history and fiction. The collection
was bequeathed to the Swarthmore College Library in
Lieberman's will and transported to the college on August X
2006. His donation also includes many primary sources,

such as Lieberman's informal interview with Lee Krasner
about Jackson Pollock's work that occurred over dinner.
According to Reference and Instruction Intern Amanda
Watson, the Lieberman collection is still in the process of
being made available to the campus.
"This exhibition is like a preview," Watson said. "We're
working on the collection as fast as we can, but it's such a
huge collection. This will continue to be an ongoing process
as it has been for sometime."
Lieberman was personal friends with many artists and
therefore the collection includes many art works signed by
the artists themselves, including those of Pablo Picasso,
Joan Miro and Andy Warhol. There are also many original
prints and lithographs as well as catalogs from various exhibitions that he collected over the years. In addition, he collected many rare and special edition books with the authors'
signatures such as William Blake and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Currently most of the books are being stored on the lower
level of McCabe in a series of closed compact stacks.
However, the library staff and others such as Burford have
been going through and examining each of the books."We
have searched approximately 60 percent of the collection at

this point, and once we have finished with the searching

process, we will have the collection re-appraised by a professional appraiser," Assistant Head of Technical Services
and Coordinator of Collection Development Amy McColl
said. "At that point we will determine which titles we will
add to the permanent collection, and begin the process of cat-

Earthlust supports environmental justice in Chester
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

Pollution. Racism. Blatant corruption.
This is the story of the city of Chester, which
was named by George Magazine as one of
America's most corrupt cities in 1998.
Earthlust members are getting involved
with the upcoming city council elections in
Chester as a means of aiding the implementation of environmental justice. "[When] we
say we are working for environmental justice we are working against unfair and
unequal concentration of environmental
hazards in specific areas," Shandra BernathPlaisted 'O9 said. "Environmental justice is
also linked with the idea of environmental
racism, that minority communities are overexposed to environmental hazard."
...

According

to

the Energy Justice
Network, environmental injustice is a major
problem in Chester that has been the target
site for many environmentally hazardous
facilities. "The Energy Justice Network was
started by Mike Ewall, and... tries to
connect communities who are fighting these
kinds of facilities with other people who are
doing the same work and provide a lot of
resources for people
working in communities like this," Campus and Community
Organizer Antonia Daniels said.
Daniels contacted colleges in the area

...

this summer, including Swarthmore, to gain

support for two candidates running for the
Chester City Council on the Independent

share," Bernath-Plaisted said.
On Monday, Oct. 22, Earthlust members
had their first meeting with Delores Shelton
and Francis Whittington, the two candidates
for Chester City Council. During the meeting, Ewall presented information about
waste management plants and toxicity in
Chester, as well as the overarching political
system in Chester that allows environmental racism to persist.

"Race is more correlated with distribution of toxic pollution in Delaware County

"[This discrimination] is not
right... Chester [has had]
more than its fair share."
Shandra
Bernath-Plaisted 'O9
than income, poverty, childhood poverty,
education, job classification or home ownership," Ewall said. Toxic pollution in Chester
is responsible for the "highest percentage of
low-weight births" and highest blood-lead
levels among children in Pennsylvania, and
it originates largely from four waste-management facilities around the residential

area of Chester. According to Ewall, it is no
coincidence that this pollution is prevalent
in an area that is mostly black and poor.
According to data that Ewall has collected over several years, waste management
plants in Chester deal with more than the
waste produced by Chester residents. Of all
the waste that Covanta Trash Incinerator in
Chester manages, 34 percent comes from
New Jersey and New York; 33 percent is
from Philadelphia and 31 percent is from
Delaware County. Thus, Chester residents
breathe in ash from the trash from these
other areas. People at the county level make
sure that trash goes to Chester Ewell said.
"People are oblivious to what's going on,"
Ewell said. "If they knew it was an act of
racism to throw stuff away, progressive peo-

ple in this community would object and
organize. Certain communities have the
clout to fight them off and others don't." He
emphazied the need for organization and
fierce campaigning.
Yet, the case in Chester is not hopeless.
"There have been more victories in Chester
than in anywhere else I can think of," Ewell
said, referring to the various power plants
and facilities shut down by the county in
response to community activism.
Ewell is the primary link between

Earthlust and the candidates, Delores
Shelton and Francis Whittington, who
oppose the environmental racism all around
them. "You see where we live
what's happening to us, you see that we're losing our
children and family daily, because of envi...

ronmental racism," Shelton said.
Having grown up in Chester, Shelton witnessed its descent from industrial boomtown to destitute neighborhood following
the "white flight." She is particularly interested in alleviating the high unemployment
rate and poor school systems, but also recognizes that there isn't much fight left.
"We need some volunteers who will help
us on election day to get elected. We're here
tonight to ask young people, with strong legs
and active minds, to come out and work, or I
should say volunteer, at the polls for us,"
Shelton said at the meeting on Monday. "You
also have a stake in this. It's not just for
Chester, it's for all of us."
According to Shelton, Chester became a
dumping ground for waste management
plants. "They would never have put a waste,
management plant where there is money,

Shelton said.
Originally intending to run on the
Democratic ticket, Shelton and Whittington
said they were excluded from the ballot due
to an error that Shelton suspects was not
accidental. For the Nov. 6 election, two others are running under the Independent banner, four Republicans are running under the
Republican banner and three Republicans
are running as Democratic candidates in
addition to one Democrat, Rosetta Carter.
The Republican party took Shelton and
Whittington to court to get them off the ballot, but the two are staying firm.

After news of this semester's Large Scale Event performers prematurely leaked to

now been signed. The Roots, a
Philadelphia hip-hop group,
and opening act Hezekiah will
perform in LPAC on Nov. 3.
The LSE committee began
its consideration of potential

Global Health Forum members go over plans to educate the Swarthmore
community about malaria. The group will be hosting a week of events.

BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

Global Health Forum, a newly
formed student group, has begun working towards its goal of large-scale
awareness of infectious diseases and is
raising funds for fighting those diseases in developing nations. This
semester the group will focus on raising awareness about the malaria epidemic, sponsoring an anti-malaria campaign that is set to begin on Thursday,
Oct. 25 and will last through Thursday,
Nov. 8.

Global Health Forum board member
Erin Ronhovde 10 described the Global
Health Forum as an organization that
"educates the public on issues of global
health, specifically hepatitis, malaria

and HIV/AIDS."

"It gives the community an inside
look at how these diseases affect individuals and communities," Ronhovde
said.

One of the goals of the Global Health
Forum is raising money through variin
ous fundraisers
both the
Swarthmore Borough and on campus.
Throughout the campaign, which is
coordinated by Maryanne Tomazic 10,
Global Health Forum hopes that every
Swarthmore student will contribute to
the fundraising effort to buy insecticide-treated bed nets to protect children
in Uganda from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The group plans to display a
bed net in Sharpies Dining Hall.
"We're hoping to get Swarthmore
students and the community to send as
many nets as there are people," Global

Health Forum board member Mark

Dlugash 'OB said. All of the proceeds
will go towards buying the $lO bed nets
for people living in the Acholi Quarter
of Kamapala, Uganda. According to the
organization Nothing but Nets, antimalaria bed nets can reduce the transmission of the disease by up to 90 percent in high-coverage areas.
The Global Health Forum will begin
its anti-malaria campaign this week by
raising awareness of the disease with a
series of events. The opening event is a
photography exhibit depicting victims
of the malaria epidemic in Uganda.
This exhibit will be up from Oct. 25
through Oct. 31 in Parrish's Shane
Student Lounge. Dlugash took the pho-

tographs over the summer when he
went to Uganda with fellow board mem-

ber Katie Camillus 'OB, who was there

establishing a micro-loan enterprise
through her Lang Opportunity Grant.
In Uganda, Dlugash arranged interviews with local children with malaria
and with their mothers. The effects of
the disease were evident in many children who lacked the energy even to
speak with Dlugash. After the 10minute interviews, Mark photographed
the mothers with their children. These
photographs will be displayed in the
upcoming exhibit. On the last day ofthe
exhibit, Dlugash and Camillus will
speak about their experiences in

Uganda.

In addition to the photo exhibit, the
Global Health Forum will be hosting
three speakers. Rhodes Scholar
Tafadzwa Muguwe 'O5 and former
World Health Organization employee
Eugene Palatulan 'O5 will be speaking
on the science behind malaria, vaccines and case studies on Nov. 4. On
Nov. 8, Terrie Taylor '77, a research
physician in tropical medicine at
Michigan State University, will speak
about the work she does in Malawi.
Every year, Taylor spends six months
researching the effects of cerebral
malaria on children. On Tuesday, Nov.
6, the Global Health Forum will show
the documentary Malaria: Fever Wars.

The PBS special documents the lives of

several different individuals with

malaria as they struggle to live with the
disease.
The Global Health Forum has
involved the community outside the

college as well. "We are trying to
spread awareness outside the campus,"
Lois Park 10 said. On Nov. 10, the
mayor of Swarthmore will read an
Africa-related story for children at the
Swarthmore Library, and the Global
Health Forum will be sponsoring a
workshop there for kids. Local businesses will also be handing out information on malaria in conjunction with
the Global Health Forum's anti-malaria

campaign.

After the anti-malaria campaign,
the Global Health Forum plans to begin
working on its ideas for next semester.
They will likely be shifting the focus
from malaria to HIV/AIDS for the next
cycle of events.

Coming Out Week encourages discussion
they do. Like, "what's your ideal male?' Just
little things like that, I think that to talk
about these issues more is really important
because it's not necessarily that people are
avoiding them at all times, it's that they're
not even really aware of the fact that they
are being heteronormative in some cases,"
she said.

Following the chalkings done on Sunday
night, the opening event for this year's
Coming Out Week was "Queer at Swat:
There is no such thing as a stupid question"

bisexual, transgender, queer or pansexual,
representing a range of social and cultural
identities answered questions from the campus community.

This week, Swarthmore's Coming Out

Week Planning Committee, comprised of
members representing the Swarthmore
Queer Union, Queer Students of Color, None
of the Above, Small Group and the QueerStraight Alliance, organized a week devoted
to addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender (LGBT) issues on campus.
National Coming Out day was Oct. 11, the
Thursday before fall break. Members of the
LGBT communities, along with their allies,

celebrated the annual awareness day for
coming out and dialogue about LGBT issues.
Maria Kelly 10, a member of COLORS
and board member of SQU, said one of the
purposes of Coming Out Week is to acknowledge queer issues and the queer community
on campus.
Dean of Students Jim Larimore said
while Coming Out Week holds different
meanings for different individuals on a personal level, it is also a matter of concern for
the campus community in addition to the
groups involved.
"For the campus as a whole, Coming Out
Week represents a time for us to be especially conscious of the varied experiences, interests, perspectives, concerns and accomplishments of GLBTQ students, faculty and staff,"
Larimore said in an e-mail.
"For a community so committed to inclusiveness, this is a time for us to recognize
both the positive aspects of our community
and to be attentive to the unfinished work
that remains to ensure fairness and equality
of opportunity for all members of our community."
Kelly said that this week is also an opportunity to address issues that are usually not
openly discussed.
"For me, I feel like Coming Out Week is
really about celebrating queerness on campus and making people more aware of queer
issues," she said. "Obviously, Swarthmore

comes across as a very safe space and a very
understanding place. And I think it is, but
even here, these issues are put to the side a
little bit more than they need to be."
Kelly said she has had conversations
with students who have experienced various
degrees of heteronormativity in classes.

"I've heard people talk about in particular

more heteronormative work exercises that

THE PHOENIX

Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB, Intercultural
Center Intern for the Swarthmore Queer
Union and a member of Queer Students of
Color said that the planning committee
decided to open with the student panel to
give members of the campus community a
forum to ask questions that they might not
otherwise feel comfortable asking.
She said the politics behind chalkings in
Coming Out Week connect members of
Swarthmore'sLGBT community to different
queer and feminist movements that have
traditionally used shocking and anonymous
images and words to call attention to their
causes.
Kelly said chalking is a way to create
queer visibility on campus. "I think they're
really meant to be a celebration of queer
identity. Part of it is a way to reach Out to the
Swarthmore campus in a way that's differ-

ent from other events of Coming Out Week,"
she said.
Although the event is campus-wide, for
many members of the LGBT community, the
chalkings represent individual expressions
of queer identity. "I think it depends on the
individual," Kelly said. "Because I know
there are lots of chalkers who I've talked to
who are just like, 'I just want my chalkings
to be happy and about love and I just really
want to express that.' And all the power to
them to do that."
"And there are others whom I've spoken
to who expressed [that] there can't be a
change in the way people think without
exposing them to something different they
would never think of. But I really do think

it's about the individual chalker and their
choice to make about what they want to do
with their drawings or written expressions,"
Kelly said.

During last year's Coming Out Week, the
campus community had various strong reactions to the content of some of the chalkings.
The controversies surrounding the chalkings were addressed in a campus-wide open
discussion following Coming Out Week.
As a result and partly in response to last
year's incidences, this year, the planning
committee took the reactions of the Swat
Survivors community into consideration to
implement changes to the location of some of
the more explicit chalkings for this year's
Coming Out Week.
"We specifically realized that some of the
chalkings have been and can be triggering
for survivors and very upsetting. And in
order to respect that and try to be considerate of that, we did try to tell people to think
about that in their chalkings and try not to
put chalkings that might be upsetting for
certain individuals in front of unavoidable
locations," she said.

Chalkers were encouraged to keep sexually explicit drawings on Magill Walk and in
the Kohlberg courtyard. "We felt like those

were very central locations on campus that
aren't hidden away somewhere but also can
be avoided," Kelly said.
Kelly said that a letter was sent to mem-

bers of Swat Survivors informing them of
the committee's decision so that these locations could be avoided.
Nicole Belanger 'OB, Co-facilitator of Swat
Survivors, said members of the group appre-

ciated the committee's and the individual
chalkers' consideration of the survivors'
experiences.
"From my point, I think that it is incredibly positive that a group on campus
changed the way that they are doing an
activity in order to make things more supI
portive, less triggering for survivors
think that's really incredible and really
empathetic and just so helpful," Belanger
said. "I think that this is a really great start
on a way to balance what the goals of the
Coming Out chalkings are with also being
understanding of the fact that it was triggering for people."
There are, however, members of the.
...

Swarthmore community who question the
effectiveness of some of the more explicit
chalkings.
"At least in terms of the chalkings which
is the biggest expression that I've seen so far
of Coming Out Week, I think it's really negative," Soren Larson 'll said. "I thought the
chalkings especially on Magill Walk were
really offensive. I didn't think that it was
necessary for the organization that put on
this week to have such pornographic images
on a pathway that many prospective students walk on."
"I know that if I were a prospective student and I was with my parents I know that
that would really turn me off to
Swarthmore,"

Larson

continued.

"My

friends and I've been talking about this a lot.
I remember near Kohlberg, I think under the

trees between Kohlberg and [the Lang
Performing Arts Center], it said something
like, 'just because you wear a sticker, doesn't
make you an ally' And I thought that if the
purpose of Coming Out Week is to raise
awareness and make people more sympathetic to the cause, I don't understand how
placing such messages like that and such

pornographic images is going to garner any
support," he said.
"If their goal is to make people talk, they
certainly achieved it, but I think it really
caused, at least in my friends and I, a negative response
I know that I would not support pornographic images that are heterosexual, for that matter," Larson said.
Kelly said she hopes Coming Out Week
will encourage people to think about queer
issues and open dialogue within the community. "It's a time where I feel like I'm able to
see those people who strongly identify as
allies and even people who want to be and
become better allies and I think that's another important aspect of Coming Out Week
seeing allies on campus and everyone trying
to work together," she said.
Cozzarelli said one of the impacts of these
events is that it is more difficult to ignore
queer issues during Coming Out Week, compared to the rest of the year. "One of my
biggest hopes is for people who don't normally come to events about queer issues
...

come and come with an open mind and that
they get something from it," Cozzarelli said.

Cozzarelli also felt that the week serves

to promote bonding amongst the queer community.
"I think just that at some point, this week
sparks in someone a thought that they'll continue to develop in their time at
Swarthmore," Cozarelli said.

Larimore said that although he perceives
Swarthmore as a generally accepting place,
he also recognizes that not all members of
the campus community experience it as uniformly safe.
"While I think that we need to recognize
the many people, past and present, who have
made Swarthmore a queer friendly or queer
safe environment, I think that we also need

to recognize that we should not be complacent because the campus is more open and
safe than other places," he said in an e-mail.
"[W]e need to have higher aspirations than
that, and we need to recognize that there is
work that remains to be done here as well."

"As late as it is today, they're still
fighting to get us off the ballot. Because
they know that we're just about the right
thing," Shelton said.
Earthlust is firmly behind Shelton
and Whittington in their bid in running
for City Council. "We're putting together
a big list of people who are going to help
in the four, five days before Nov. 6 and on
the day," Heber said. "We'll send people
out to help them canvas neighborhoods
and just inform people that four out of

five candidates are the same on the
Republican and Democratic ballot, and
inform them about the Independent
Party and the environmental issues."
"Republican rule in Chester hasn't
been good for the environment," Heber
said. "It's led to great proliferation of
environmental racism, and now the
Democrats are supporting that same
body. The Independent Party is much
more grassroots and much more the citizens' voice."
Also present at the meeting on
Monday was Kae Kalwaic, administrative assistant in the department ofeducational studies at Swarthmore and cofounder of Citizen Access, a local organization that networks with and supports
other progressive groups. "I thought it

October 25, 2007

was good to work on broader issues
which involved students and community

members," Kalwaic said.
Earthlust, a group known for its environmentalist activism, is now pushing
into the realm of political activism with
this initiative in Chester.
"I guess we're political where politics
affects environmental issue because
there's so much money connected to
environmental issues, and money tends
to be connected to politics," BernathPlaisted said. Getting involved with the
community, and eventually working to
educate people in Chester about environmental and political issues, is one of
Earthlust's long-term goals, according to
Heber. "To me, Earthlust's priority as
soon as this campaign is done should be
education because people don't know
what's going on both in Chesterand in all
of Delaware County. I think a lot of it is
hush-hush and covered up, and {people]
don'tknow the kind ofchemicals that are
being released," Heber said.
"Whether Delores and Francis are
elected to office or not, these are still
issues that students at Swat and in the
neighboring community should be aware
of, and should be doing something about.
It's not just about Chester, sit's about
everyone, and it affects us all in different
ways," Daniels said.

Sharples brings new innovations to mealtime

Thursday night before Fall Break,
Sharpies was packed full of salivating students heaping corn on the cob, butternut
squash and tomato and eggplant lasagna
onto their trays during the Local Foods
Dinner coordinated by Dining Services and
the Good Food Project. Though Sharpies has
always offered some local products, this special event expanded local and organic food
options available to diners for one night. The
event also drew attention to several Sharpies
initiatives to improve the eating experience.
"We, as the Swarthmore College dining
service and the whole community of the college should be leaders in the field of sustainability," Sharpies Purchasing Director Janet
Kassab said. "To our surprise, we are. When
we meet with a few other facilities and
schools that are working towards this goal
we are pleased and surprised to know that
we are actually doing quite a great job of it."

The dinner offered many meal choices,
including Lancaster County smashed potatoes, lasagna with herbed vegetable veloute
and Kennett Square mushrooms and
spinach. Though many students observed
the difference in the quality of food, Kassab
stressed that Sharpies keeps up with new
local food options on a daily basis, not just
for this one-time event. "It's not a thing we

"It seems it was a good time of the year
because it really is the end of the growing
season for [the farmers]," Kassab said. "We
have to work within the limits of nature."
In order to coordinate events such as
these, Kassab meets with local farmers who
are interested in negotiating produce sales
with the college. Several of these farmers
have organic options that were incorporated
into the Local Foods Dinner, including
organic kale from local farmer Noah Gress.
Though it is often a more expensive option,
every year local food alternatives are closely
reviewed and evaluated.
"We are clearly enjoying our relationship

with the farmers," she said. "We encourage
other businesses to buy from them to make
their efforts more worthwhile," Kassab said.
According to McDougall, Kassab is currently seeking other ways to support and
incorporate sustainability in Sharpies.

this is where most of the ideas [for the Local
Foods Dinner] came about."
Kit La Touche 'OB was pleased with the
local foods night. "It was great, as a friend
even noted the salad greens, just better than
on an average day," he said. "Clearly, it's not

something they can feasibly do everyday, but
as something to do more regularly or often, it
would be great. And I also like that it's local."

"It was pretty nice and the food was real-

ly good except that there was a lot of people
there and the lines were too long. It would be
nice if they would do it more often," Michael
Ann 10 said.

"It was well-received. There'sbeen a lot of

positive feedback. Everyday it seems we're
sort of just, we're always committed to it. It
seems kind of just normal to me. It just
makes sense," Kassab said.
Sharpies periodically plans other innovative events. Currently, they are in the
process of organizing a dinner with

raising New Orleans-Katrina Relief aid and

Sharpies is working on a few new initiatives, including new labels for meat-containing, vegetarian and vegan food and the sanitary wipes dispenser on the top floor of the
building. According to Kassab, the labels and
even the writing on the menu boards use a
color-coded system to aid students in identifying whether each dish has meat, or is vegetarian or vegan. Vegan dishes are represented by orange, vegetarian by green and meat
by pink. Dining Services alsp added boards
near the entrances of Sharpies to display the
menu for each day.
"We have gotten responses back from

some of the students that have realized how
much easier it is to just glance to look for

vegan products," Kassab said.
Dining Services examines elements of

other schools' dining services that seem to

came about as a result of researching other
colleges' dining services, most of which provide a similar type of hygienic aid.

Professor Orr urges local efforts to solve sustainability issues

BY NEENA CHERAYIL
ncherayl@swarthmore.edu
In a lecture held on Oct. \\ Swarthmore
College invited the Chair of Oberlin
College's environmental studies program,
Professor David Orr to campus to speak on
the role of secular schools in maintaining

the "Path Towards a Sustainable Future," as

his speech was titled.

Orr presented on global challenges conclimate change and proposed
actions to take toward solving the international crisis, which was followed by a Q&A
panel and a "Farm to Fork" Sharpies dinner
discussion. Orr also spoke of "ecological disorder as a result of previous disorder of
thought" and pushed for a transformation of
curriculum through increased dialogue
across disciplines to foster a culture of sus-

and international movement. The plan to
bring Orr to campus this year was first proposed when, after reading several of his
works, Meg Perry 'OB felt that "Orr's wideranging ideas and broader vision about how

tainability.
The panel consisted of various faculty
members from small liberal arts schools
including Swarthmore, Oberlin, Haverford
and Williams Colleges. During the panel,
many calls to action were voiced and
invoked, mainly necessitating the responsibility to think globally and act locally.
Panelists like Stephanie Boyd of Williams
College reiterated that action was needed
immediately. "The atmosphere doesn't care
what's feasible," Boyd said.
Students, Swarthmore administration,

Swarthmore faculty and the local community attended and raised questions about
financial transparency, the overall impacts
that sustainability efforts could have and
environmentalism as a political, cultural

"It is well past time to
make sustainability a
priority rather than a back
burner issue."
Carr Everbach
Engineering Professor
Event moderator and engineering professor Carr Everbach described Orr as being
"very effective in speaking to issues the campus needs to hear." Everbach suggested
adding the panel and discussion to follow
Orr's presentation to bring together outside
viewpoints on education and sustainability
from liberal arts institutions around the
country. "[The event was] a good start for
the sustainability visioning process beginning now [at Swarthmore]," Everbach said.
This semester's lecture marks Orr's
fourth visit to the campus since 1991 His

previous presentations were also at times
when environmental issues have been at the
forefront of campus concerns. His 1998
Swarthmore visit, for instance, occurred as
the design process for the Science Center
was just beginning. Orr's innovative ideas
for Oberlin's Lewis Building spurred the
creation of an administrative Green Team,
which oversaw the environmentally-aware
design and engineering aspects of the building.
So far, this year's sustainability events
have proved successful in highlighting ongoing sustainability issues. "[I am] very
encouraged with the fact that the school was
able to put together this sort of discussion ...
seeing that many of the school's administration were in [attendance] also says something about the college's ambitions," Perry
said. "There's great potential for the school
to move in that direction."
Swarthmore has only very recently put
together a committee to investigate the
school's intended long-range planning and
goals regarding sustainability. Everbach
commented on the urgency in addressing

these issues on campus. "It is well past time

to make sustainability a priority rather than
a backburner issue," Everbach said. "[The

college's] slow and incremental response [to
the issue] is largely a result of institutional

inertia."

Swat alum and panelist Matt St. Clair '97
emphasized this subject during Thursday's
discussionwhen he cited an April 1998 issue
ofThe Phoenix describing the college's slow
response to eco-issues on campus, a quote
which many audience members mistook to

be from that day's edition. Over the years,
the College has established a strong interdisciplinary environmental studies program, and various other sustainability

efforts are being continually updated
through the college's sustainability site,
which was launched in May 2007 after the
environmental studies capstone urged the
proposal.
Stacey Kutish
of the College's
Communications Office said in an e-mail
that the Web site especially aimed to develop
strong links between academic experience
and environmental action on campus
through relationships with a broad network
of people on Swarthmore's campus involved
in environmental action. "This semester
we reached out to that network to learn
about new initiatives on campus, which led
us to information about more environmen...

tally friendly containers being used by the

food service for take-out meals, the locally
sourced meal held in Sharpies and several
updates from the Good Food Project," Kutish
said.
According to Everbach, institutional
relationships are the "one pre-requisite for
all that needs to be done with sustainability." Coordination with other schools can
build up a united, potent force which is capable of truly effecting change. Time and other
resources also play a role in slowed reaction
to environmental issues. Often, faculty are
asked to work on boards in addition to various other commitments. "Everyone is pedal
to the metal around here. It's not just students," Everbach said. "[Faculty] play misery poker too."

Conference draws attention to racial profiling
3Y YINGJIA WANG
ywangl@swarthmore.edu
Law enforcement and community leaders from the college and surrounding areas gathered on campus over fall
break for a training course presented by the Department of
Justice's Community Relations Service. Entitled
"Responding to Allegations of Racial Profiling: Building
Trust Between Police and the Community," the conference
was held on Oct. 16 and included members from various
Delaware County law enforcement departments, community
leaders such as area mayors, including Swarthmore mayor
Eck Gerner, members of a local NAACP branch, college
deans, Public Safety officers and Swarthmore students.

The conference was a joint effort between Swarthmore
College and the Delaware County Sheriffs Office.
Swarthmore Equal Opportunity Officer Sharmaine Lamar
coordinated the event on the college's end. According to
Lamar, bringing the speaker, Senior Conciliation Specialist
Ben Lieu of the Department of Justice's Community
Relations Service to the conference was the fruition of collaborative endeavors by the Sheriffs Office and the college.

"It made me appreciate the
Swarthmore community more
because we don't have to deal with
comments like that."
Patrick Rock 'O9
"We were contacted by Delaware County Sheriffs Office
because one of the sergeants there had seen the facilitator at
another university and thought it would be wonderful to
bring him back to Delaware County for their law enforcement," Lamar said. "They thought of Swarthmore College
because of our history for social justice and concern. They
thought that we would be a good place and neutral ground to
hold the conference. We leaped at the opportunity to play

host to the conference."

profiling," Lamar said.
Since the conference was open to the college community,
a few Swarthmore students took advantage of the opportunity to sit in on Lieu's presentation. Patrick Rock 'O9 was one

of the student attendees.
"I thought it sounded interesting, and I was curious as to
how they were going to deal with it. I'm a black studies
minor, so we think a lot about race and how perceptions of
race fit into society," Rock said.
Rock also said that much of the conference was focused
on the legal issues surrounding racial profiling and the distinction between it and criminal profiling. "I thought that
the issues of 'how do you connect with the community' was
addressed, but I was a little disappointed that there wasn't
more community building. It was more focused on 'how can
we understand what racial profiling is so that we can't be
accused of it,'" Rock said.
Rock also noted an incident at the conference that
shocked him.
According to Rock, a video of a young Dominican woman
getting pulled over was shown during the conference, and a
law enforcement attendee said, "I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were the chiefs nanny," in response to a
question ofhow to deal with the situation. His answer
was met by the laughter of many of the other attendees.
"It made me appreciate the Swarthmore community more because we don't have to deal with comments

CJC issues reprimand for violation of alcohol policy
The College Judiciary Committee
convened on Wednesday, Oct. 10 to deliberate upon a charge of "reckless conduct
and violation of the alcohol policy"
against a Swarthmore student.
The five-person committee, with
Dean Jim Larimore acting as Convener
and Director of ITS Judy Downing acting as Observer of the hearing, eventually found the student responsible for
the charge.
The CJC determined that the student
will be on behavioral probation and prohibited from using alcohol for the rest of
his or her time at the College.
The student victim to the actions of
the accused student did not press
charges and accepted the apology of the
accused student.
The process of any CJC hearing is
one that entails much consideration of
all the circumstances regarding the situation.
The committtee allows accused students to bring their own witnesses, in
addition to witnesses invited by the
committee itself. The committee was
comprised of two students and three fac-

Richard
Wicentowski and economics professor

"If that person has an
encounter with a Public
Safety officer... that would
be an issue."
Stu Hain
Associate VP for
Facilities and Services
"The Committee weighs all of the
available evidence in reaching decisions
about a student's responsibility, which
often includes speaking with the student
charged with misconduct as well as any
witnesses that might be available,"

Larimore said in an email. "Thefocus of
the hearing process is to develop as complete an understanding as possible about
what happened and whether it represents a violation of the College's standards of conduct."
Larimore also said that the facts
brought forward during the student's
hearing would be considered in determining what sanctions a student should
face.
According to a written release from
the CJC, the student, in addition to
being on behavioral probation, will be
"required to abstain from the use of alcohol for the remainder of her/his time at
Swarthmore."
The committee will be regulating the
student to the best of their ability. "We
do know that we're not following the
person around," Hain said.
However, CJC will following up if a
violation of punishment is committed.
"If that person has an encounter with a

numerous times over approximately ten
years, also said that even if the student
didn't violate the college's alcohol policy, he would still be violating the constraints of his punishment.
Larimore emphasized the College's
philosophy in aiding and allowing students to learn from errors in judgment.
"The focus of sanction discussions
tends to reflect a balance between
ensuring that the student understands
the seriousness of the misconduct on the
one hand, and the College's belief in reconciliation and learning from one's mistakes on the other hand," Larimore said.
Before the CJC hearing on Oct. 10, the
accused student worked with doctors
and counselors to understand the implications of his or her actions and to prevent issues in the future.
The decision was reached by a consensus of the committee members, as is
customary for such hearings.
"It's a thoughtful, deliberative
process. People care a lot in that room,"
Hain said. "That's been my experience
anyway."

Computer science teams vie in Battle of the Brains

14 Swatties compete for scholarships, awards and glory in global collegiate programming contest
BY MELISSA CRUZ
mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

This Saturday, Oct. 27, students from
Swarthmore's computer science department will participate in the 32nd Annual
Association
IBM-sponsored
for
Computing Machinery International
Collegiate Programming Contest.
This highly competitive "Battle of the
Brains" will begin with the regional competition, taking place at Johns Hopkins
University, and will include other teams
from schools including Goucher College,
University of Maryland and Johns
Hopkins University.

"We have the largest
group we've ever had."
Andrew Danner
Professor of
Computer Science
The top 90 regional winners, consistof competitors from 6,099 teams, coming from 82 countries and six continents,
ing

will then advance to the world's most
competitive programming competition,
which takes place in April of 2008 in Banff
Springs, Alberta, Canada. Prizes include
scholarships, awards and year-long brag-

ging rights to the "world's smartest trophy."
According to the competition's Web
site, the criteria in this competition
include "collaborating to rank the difficulty of the problems, deduce the requirements, design test beds and build software
systems that solve problems under the
intense scrutiny of expert judges."
Some of these real-life problems
require only steadfast precision, while
others require understanding of complex
algorithms.
Example problems from past competitions included designing a rapid translation device that allows people of different
languages to comprehend each other, or
protecting consumers from theft.
Richard Wicentowski, professor of
Computer Science and advisor to
Swarthmore's participants, commented
on the in-depth nature and profound complexity of the problems students will face
at the competition.
"These problems are intentionally putting in strange tricks to confuse the stu-

dents. We don't do that with our homework assignments."
Andrew Danner, also a professor of
Computer Science and another advisor to
the participating students, said, "The way
the word problems are arranged make
them particularly obfuscating."
Wicentowski also added that "this
year, there's been some one-on-one tutoring with a few of the students and myself.
Most of the practice and preparation

comes from having done this sort of programming before."

expressed appreciation for the mixed genders of the teams.

dents may face is the programming languages used, which are JAVA and C++.
"We only teach Python in our introductory course because it's a much more efficient language," Wicentowski said.
One added benefit is that the students
are allowed to bring into the competition
any written resources they like, but that
ultimately will not make a difference.
Wicentowski noted that "the challenge is
actually thinking through the problems,
not just typing them into the computer.
Swarthmore is no foreigner to the
"Battle of the Brains."
The college team has participated onand-off for the past 15-20 years, and this

we haven't found anything useful."
The surveillance cameras

Poetry 'out of nothing'

"Please, I need something primitive and
complex, / to relieve me
of this world subdivided into better / and better ways to avoid life."
Last week, English
professor
Nathalie

Anderson and I went to
at
a reading
the
University
of
Pennsylvania's

Kelly

Writers House. I hadn't

words or sex or soup

heard of the poet Olena
K. Davis before, but I
learned in the nights
prior that she was a
Detroit-born Ukranian
with fearless verse, and
that it would be an
undoubtedly thrilling
reading. We rode South

down to the teeth, where Penn's campus merges with the city,
where students revel in anonymity.
Nat's colleague gave a flattering introduction, characterizing
Davis's poetry as "an exigent rush" of some thing and another,
which, when Davis took the podium, she immediately replied to
with confused refutation and half-gratitude, then bespectacled herself and waved to her children in the audience. She writes, "Once I
looked good standing there, no one could see the inside of my head."
Davis does not match the delicate photograph on the back of
"And Her Soul Out of Nothing." She's aged since she published her
first anthology, and as a new mother to two angel-headed young
Alaskans, she could not stop referring to them, waving to them and
talking to them during the reading. She transformed the vulgarities
of her verse, the notorious curse of our consonant %' into "cuff," its
linear opposite. It was funny, actually, that in front of an audience
determined to maintain an atmosphere of intellectualism, she blew
them all away by rambling, showing all her strange poetic quirks,
and talking outright about her lover and how she doesn't love him
anymore, as he sat in the audience with their children. She was a
wild one, with the candor of a rose. "He's thinking I'm carved of
Street

sweet-smelling wood."
Her poetry is the sort that makes me write inflamed, passionate
letters about the consummation of our ideas, the strange sort of
coincidences we share in thinking, and I didn't stop thinking about
her for days after the reading. I felt as though my arm was a chain
saw, and she was the board. The most technically accomplished
poems were in a series where the narrator adopts the stance of
Francesca de Rimini, a medieval contemporary of Dante who, with
her lover, was seduced by reading the stories of Lancelot and
Guinevere. The series gave Davis the allusive guise to comment on
her own sex life, rather explicitly as well, and she ended with a sonnet that had a title to the effect of "And At Last Francesca Proves

She Can Write a Real Sonnet Too."

The games she played with language were pixie-like and mischievous. The last thing she read was an endless poem of meditative
narration, where she referred to herself, "I," in the third person,
like "I doesn't believe that her son hasn't left school yet," but in
such hilarious, witty ways. Neither the Francesca series nor the

unending meditation has been published yet and both exist only in
her possession, so it was quite a privilege to hear her work in
progress. However, her anthology "And Her Soul Out of Nothing"
certainly satisfies the poetic hankering. Some of her phrasing is
unparalleled, and her exact, sterling images, such as "A screaming
saw in the soundless space of the late summer day" characterize
Olena K. Davis as a dominant writer of our time. I thinkher poetry
sort of maps the trajectory of modern writing, that form is losing
ground to impulse and that personal and instinctual poetry is an
outlet from what Davis calls, "a still, still life."
She insists on tragic, truthful statements that expose her as a
fragile, unsatisfied soul, a pattern of sadness which I've witnessed
in the more accomplished female poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
There is a choice that each artist must make; to either resign them-

selves to ordinary happiness or grapple with the misery of celestial
ambition. Most great writers are not recognized until their "foreheads have been bleached to the bone," until they're food for the
daisies, until their last breath has passed. In the interim, they've
lived lonely lives in the seclusion of creation. Thus is the sad paradox of literary greatness.

It's important to consider whether or not hygiene

always test the carcinogens in hygiene products) and
produced with ethical animal treatment. I'll also note
some favorite hygiene products for our mouths, skin,
hair, odor and clothes.
Hygiene products continue to depend heavily on
petroleum derivatives and animal products, both of
which are not sustainable in this country. Petroleum
products are everywhere; propylene glycol is a common product known to be toxic found in deodorants
and lotions. Gelatin is a common product in cosmetics
made from pig or bovine bone or skin (do you really
want that on your face?). Also key to look for are
organic oils and plant ingredients, since many of these
come from developing nations where conventional
production of plants for cosmetics pollutes both growers' bodies and rivers. Make sure to go for items in
recyclable or biodegradable packaging and in concentrated form as it wastes less packaging for more space.

Michael Clayton is the anti-Erin Brokovich
BY ABIGAIL GRABER
agraberl@swarthmore.edu
Do you remember the 2000 movie season? Have you compulsively watched every Oscar broadcast since, desperately
trying to crowd from your memory the underwhelming,
genre films that headlined that year? Do you lie awake at
night, feverishly repressing the overexposure of Julia
Roberts' cleavage in "Erin Brokovich"? Tony Gilroy does.

And now he's done something about it.
"Michael Clayton," written and directed by Gilroy, is
"Erin Brokovich" told from the perspective of the Other
Guy, who, it turns out, is equally attractive, but not nearly
so stacked. While Julia Roberts went around practically
flashing viewers in her Oscar-winning role (yyyup), I was
deeply disappointed that George Clooney never so much as
removed his overcoat. But let us not speak of the investigations into the sordid doings of evil, carcinogenic companies

of the past.
Let us speak of the investigations into the sordid doings
of evil, carcinogenic companies of the present. The film follows Clooney as the title character, the "fixer" for a law firm
defending UNorth, an agrochemical company embroiled in
a decade-long, multibillion dollar lawsuit for, you guessed it,
spewing cancerous chemicals across rural America. The
company is being defended by Michael's friend Arthur
Edens (Tom Wilkinson), a manic depressive who goes off his
meds, strips down in the middle of a deposition meeting,
declares his love for the plaintiff and starts compiling evidence against the company. Clayton is brought in to do damage control, while UNorth's increasingly desperate chief
counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) wildly plunges her
hand into the grab-bag of options for What To Do When Your
Lawyer Comes Unhinged and comes up with a couple ofhit-

men.
The promotional poster really does the film a disservice.
With its blurry shot of Clooney behind the ominous tagline
"The Truth Can Be Adjusted," spelled out in angry, redblock letters (dum-da-duuum), one expects a lengthy,
Michael Mooreish polemic against big business. What one
gets is a slow-boiling, well-scripted thriller, a movie with
intelligence but with plot keywords (as compiled by the
Internet Movie Database) that include "Swearing,"
"Danger" and "Exploding Car." Seriously, need this review
go on?

"Michael Clayton" replaces righteous indignation with
understatement. Gilroy gets that we know cancer bad and
=

feels no need to bludgeon his audience to death with dramatic posturing against corporate evil. After all, the character most incensed by the company is also certifiable
we

never find out how much ofArthur's turn against UNorth is
motivated by ethics and how much is motivated by psychosis. And I liked how Michael, alienated from his family
(enter the subplot), eventually requires the help of both of
his estranged brothers to put things right. Yet "Michael
Clayton" doesn't become a schmaltzy ode to familial teamwork and reconciliation either.
What the film becomes is a meticulously paced (yes, that
is code for slightly over-long) character study of three people who are having a really, really bad week. Clooney, in
spite of being in nearly every frame, is the least interesting
of the bunch, though he carries the movie well enough.
Apparently, man has evolved more dignified ways of lawyerly sleuthing since 2000, which involve fewer low-cut shirts
(phooey) and much driving about in an expensive car looking weary, but determined. To each his own. Roberts makes
the determined-and-oops-my-boobs-fell-out thing work for
her film; Clooney makes the determined-and-weary-andoops-my-expensive-car-blew-up thing work for his. But the
real kudos go to Wilkinson and Swinton.

Arthur is the center of comedy and pathos in "Michael
Clayton" and Wilkinson can play both his characters' peaks
and valleys to a tee. I didn't know it was possible to be an
understated manic depressive, but Wilkinson delivers lines
like "I am Shiva, the god of death!" with simple conviction
and not even a whiff ofhamhandedness. I see golden statues
of bald men in his future. Swinton chooses to play Karen as
a woman precariously balanced atop a hierarchy of men,
frantically snatching at machismo to stabilize her position.
You can see that hired goons aren't really her thing, but
she's thinking, "What would my male boss do?" Of course,
her male boss would probably not break down in the toilet,
which is where we find her five minutes in. The costumer
(Sarah Edwards) also deserve a mention for putting Swinton
in figure-disguising, de-womanizing power suits which have
a timid, monochrome blah-ness about them, subtly highlighting the intersection between Karen's crisis of confidence and her powerful position.
As for corporate America, you may feel more warmly
towards it at the end of the film than when you started. It's
long past time in the fall movie season for audiences to walk
out of a film without feeling mugged by the Hollywood
machine.

How much fun is photographing yourself having fun?

Visually Stimulating
My past few weeks have included a visit
by a close friend leaving the country indefinitely, a vomit-inducing migraine, studying
for the soul-crushing onslaught of midterms,
countless hours of work in Philadelphia for
upcoming puppet parades and an attempt to
come to terms with the monstrosity that is
the new Student Events Calendar as I strategize advertising for November's Class

Amidst this mess, I've lacked the opportunity to indulge in a Friday night spent eyeing the multiple types of finery on display

I've always had difficulty understanding
the impulse to break up the flow of a bangin'
Paces party by whipping out one's camera
and grabbing the closest sweaty bodies and
demanding posed exuberance. Where are
the cameras being kept during the act of the
grind, the alleged pretense of entering the
drunken Saturday night fray? To what
extent do the people who habitually take
dance party pictures actually participate in
what will become the framing device for
their latest Facebook photo album that is,
the party itself?
I ask these questions (and more, oh so
many more) because it seems to me that
these photo albums are intended to create
seamless narratives of youthful debauchery,
reveling in the depictions of our bodies (both
physical and social) at their peak. And yet,
in order to create such coherent proofs
capsules of experiences
one has to engage
in a notable degree of disruption during the
act of partying itself, the supposed purpose
of which is having fun as opposed to documenting fun.
Beyond the physical disruption for the
photograph's subjects that results from
engaging in the mechanical process of using
the camera, there's also the visual disruption for the others at the party as flash after

flash goes off, recreating in micro the frenzied capturing of celebrity images. This conceptual tension between the disruptive act of
documenting for the album, and the album's
intentional denial of such disruptions in
order to promote a glossy-finished product of
manufactured awesomeness leaves me marveling at the actual work involved in constructing one's identity through Facebook.

or one's self-image. In the Facebook photo

photos that contain captions alluding to the

substance- or exhaustion-induced loss of
both memory and physical ability to take
photos that inevitably signals the end to a
successful night.
Photography as a medium developed
from an original function of documentation
and categorization stemming from the belief
in its truth value. What was captured on film
was understood to be a literal index ofreality. Many of the earliest photographs were of
fossils,
utterly mundane subject matter
for instance
and were intended as scientific records. Similarly, the party pictures of
today are notable for their repetitive nature
(think of the countless images of keg stands,
of red cups proudly held aloft, of grinning
flushed faces, of impossibly dangling cigarettes, of cheeky middle fingers). From
where does the impulse stem to return to
this original function of capturing a thing
(in this case, a party) in such tedious detail?
Is a Paces party really that important to document so carefully, so regularly? Can we
now imagine Paces, or construct memories
of its parties without its excessive imaging
that is placed in so public a forum as
Facebook? The cynic in me says no. And that
same cynic will probably be bringing a camera to the next round of Swat-style dance

A PLAY TO DIE FOR
The past Sunday, I was stunned in no less than three
ways: L discovering that things do happen in the Borough of
Swarthmore, 2. having a gun pointed at me, 3. finding that as
dark a revisionism of American history as Stephen
Sondheim's musical "Assassins" had wormed its way into
the quaint theater of the Swarthmore Players Club.
Like much of Sondheim's work, "Assassins" is not your
usual Broadway fodder. Nine assassins or would-be assassins of American presidents are inexplicably brought together and made to interact as if the play were conducting an
experiment to find out what they all have in common,
despite coming from different time periods and backgrounds. What is it that compelled all nine individuals to
want to kill the president of the United States?
The play's answer isn't pretty; "Assassins" is trembling with rage at being forsaken by the Americai
dream. It's a sentiment that director Joseph
Southard was gutsy enough to execute to full
fruition. In his message to the audience in the pro-

duction's playbill, Southard
insists, "These are voices we need to hear." So
far, not everyone has
agreed. Stage manager
Heather
Timberman
said, "Every night, we've
had a few people wall
out."
Tonally, the play is a
devilish balancing
act.
Sondheim has subversively
melded his beautiful music
filled with Sousa-inspirec
marching tunes, gospel, ant
other signifiers of American tra
dition
to the ugly lyrics of his
characters.
deranged
"Unworthy of your Love," for
instance, is a rock ballad that
has John Hinckley pining for
Jodie Foster, while Lynette
"Squeaky" Fromme worships Charles Manson"You are wind and devil
and God / Charlie / Take
my blood and my body."

Perhaps, the one great example of Sondheim's dark
humor is his unnerving chorus line of assassins, all pointing
their guns at the audience in the play's introduction,
"Everybody's Got the Right." "Assassins" isn't a musical
that tries to reassure its audience. As Chris Mcßride, who
plays John Hinckley, put it, "You're playing people that the
audience will not and should not sympathize with."
Stand-outs include Sean Murray as the self-promoting
Charles Guiteau, whose small stature but big personality
makes his character both entertaining and tragically pathetic, and the play's odd couple, Liz Seymour and Claudia
Carlsson. Their roles as Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme and
Sara Jane Moore respectively are played mostly for laughs,
but Seymour and Carlsson milk every second of their performances to black comedy perfection.
Seymour convincingly portrays the fervor
with which Fromme followed Charles Manson,
while Carlsson makes her paper-thin character
both hilarious and terrifying. Carlsson said,
"The scenes between Fromme and Moore are
just hilarious. You really couldn't go wrong
with them
At the same time, I really tried to
show how dangerous she was."
The character that best captures the voice of
the play is Sam Byck, the failed car salesman
who planned to fly a plane into Nixon's White
House. David Willis gives Byck a brutally honest
and heartfelt performance that makes one
momentarily forget about the play's irony-laced
(ostmodern trappings. Even as Byck, dressed
as Santa Claus and shoving fries into his
mouth, slouches before his audience as a symbol of all that is execrable in American society, Willis manages to humanize Byck, illuminating his need to be loved.
In spite of how polished this production
of"Assassins" seems, Carlsson says that the
production had its share ofhurdles to tackle.
As all of the cast and crew worked for the
?layers Club are volunteers, it was especially hard to find musicians to play in the
pit free of charge and some instrument
parts had to be omitted. Mcßride added,
"Every role in this show is impossible,"
citing the fact that "Stephen Sondheim,
I'm pretty sure, hates singers. His note
...

progressions and chord progressions are just

so damn

impossible."
The ensemble cast has nonetheless carried out the play

grandly, effectively communicating

the play's fresh ideas

about assassins and the ripples they sent through the fabric
of our national myths. "Assassins" astutely recognizes assassinations as media events with the power to alter history, as
when the narrator tells Booth, "It's because of you that
Lincoln, who got mixed reviews, now gets so many raves."
Interestingly, "Assassins" also has an underlying compassion for its American heritage that bares itself in a scene
where nameless American citizens sing their reactions to

A GLIMPSE INTO ANOTHER CULTURE
BY SARAH BRICAULT

sbricaul@swarthmore.edu

In the Shane Lounge in Parrish, you can
catch a glimpse of another country.

Photographs

taken by members of the
Swarthmore community depict the unique
and diverse nation of China.
In addition to being a presentation of students' photography, this exhibit is also a
fundraiser for a non-profit group in Beijing
that aids mentally disabled children. Pledge

forms are available at the exhibit and for
every $lO donation you can keep one of the
exhibit's photos.
Yimei Zou 'lO, Alice Xiang 'lO and Ben
Zhang 'lO compose the project committee for
"Glimpses," a presentation that opened from
Oct. 22 24. '"We realized that there were an
incredible number of Swatties who have visited China recently and have taken amazing
pictures there," Zhang said. "[And we
thought] it would be really neat if we [could]
pull these pictures together to present China
in Swatties' view." And this is exactly what
-

the exhibit succeeds in doing. A printed
handout detailing important facts about the
country, combined with an incredibly broad
collection of photographs gives the exhibit a
personal and varied view of China.
Photographs in the exhibit range from a shot
of performers at a traditional opera to a
nighttime photograph of Beijing.

12

This exhibit is, particularly interesting
because the photos displayed are, as the
exhibit's introduction explains, "different
from the images available in mainstream
media." There are no images of political

events or newsworthy happenings.
This is not the China we see in the news,
a country often characterized by "a mass of
political, environmental, arid economic
problems." This is China from the perspective of the Swarthmore community, with picture showing a different aspect of this
dynamic country of "extreme contrasts,
everyday things, little wonders and absurdi-

ties."

From these photographs, we can see how
difficult it is to understand a country based
on those few photographs we see in the
news. No one picture shows the 'true' or 'correct' view of this country.
The landscape of this country is captured
by a glorious shot of the softly colored mountains in Guilin taken by Karen Shen 'll, but
also by Xiang's photo depicting the glitter
and high style of a "luxurious" shopping
mall in Beijing.
A picture of a lecture hall at Peking
University, "the university that every
Chinese student aspires to go to," by Zhang
depicts the education system, but so too does
Zou's shot of a child playing near a rundown
"kindergarten for migrant workers' kids."

BANNED

BY ALEX ISRAEL

aisraell@swarthmore.edu

The Banned Books exhibit currently on display at
McCabe Library is rather difficult to find. Tucked in a corner of the second floor amongst the stacks and pressed
against the wall, it seems like an exhibit unsure of its subject
matter. The easiest way to find it is from the outside; just tilt
your head up and direct your gaze through the windows of
the second-story balcony, and the extra-large neon-yellow
caution tape bearing the legend BANNED BOOKS will be
sure to catch your eye.
The exhibit may be small and out-of-the-way, but it is far
from insubstantial or unimportant. Four glass cases, which
stand against the wall under the aforementioned yellow caution tape, hold some 30 books that have been banned from
schools or local libraries in recent years. The books are augmented by cards stating the reasons the books were banned
and quotes touting the importance of reading or the folly of
banning books.
Some of the volumes come as no surprise; everyone has
heard the hysterical accusations of witchcraft that followed
the success of the "Harry Potter" series, and it's not difficult
to imagine someone from an older generation wanting
Madonna's "Sex" off the shelves.
The exhibit's strength, however, comes from the many
seemingly innocuous banned books on display, such as
"James and the Giant Peach" by Roald Dahl, a man who
remains, in my mind, the quintessential children's author.
Apparently, parents wanted Dahl's book banned because
they felt that it "promotes drugs and whiskey." And I just
thought it was just a great way to encourage kids to eat fruit.

DARFUR

and find a solution."
The need for DRP arises out of a concern that in the
current media, "very little consideration is given to the
motivations of the Sudanese government and very little
individuality is given to the victims of the conflict," DRP
member Chelsea Davis 10 said. "They are just numbers,
this faceless mass."
"We want to emphasize that conflicts like this are a lot

more complex and have a lot more layers of culture and
history than what the media portrays it as," Tarn said.

As a member of both War News Radio and Swat
Sudan, Manion had the idea of linking the two to provide
a different way of looking at the Darfur conflict. A core
group of interested Swat STAND members eventually
split from Swat STAND and formed DRP.
"Activism is great and I really respect people in Swat
STAND, but I felt sometimes we were a little detached
from the issue," Tarn said, "I think a more personal connection with the conflict at hand was what attracted me
and others to the project."
After DRP secured funding through the Project
Pericles grant, members created their currently airing
pilot show "Far From Home," focusing on the lives of
Darfur refugees around the world and aimed at introducing listeners to the conflict.

THE PHOENIX

The books on exhibit demonstrate trends in book banning, which show what certain segments of the population
dislike or fear. The most prominent trend was that any book
dealing with homosexuality, whether it is the children's
book "Daddy's Roommate" or the very adult "The Joy of Gay
Sex", has been fought tooth and nail by parents, religious figures and educators. "Kaffir Boy," Mark Mathabane's tale of
growing up in the slums of South Africa, even had six lines
of text that dealt with homosexual sex cut by an overzealous
educator.
The other

major trend in the exhibit is the banning of
books that talk about uncomfortable parts of American history. Both Brown Dee's "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,"
which dealswith oppression of Native Americans, and Maya
Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," which deals
with African-American history, were banned for having
"bitter" or "slanted" viewpoints. Tim O'Brien's "The Things
They Carried" was banned simply for being about the
Vietnam War. Sore spots in history can very easily become
sore spots in literature.
The Banned Books exhibit is well put-together and
thought-provoking. It deftly shows trends in societal attitudes towards certain subjects, including homosexuality

and history.
The exhibit also shows the irony inherent in the banning
of certain books, namely Margaret Atwood's "The
Handmaid's Tale" and Lois Lowry's "The Giver." Both these
books paint a picture of an oppressive future, where free
thought is restricted and books do not exist. Maybe if those
who banned the books had bothered to read them, they
would have understood the irony inherent in their
action.Too bad they couldn't get their hands on a copy.

RADIO

A group of Swarthmore students are determined to
change the way you think about the region of Darfur in
Sudan. Founded in Fall 2006 by alumnus Sarah Manion
'O7, the Darfur Radio Project aims to provide an alternative news source to what Darfur Radio Project Treasurer
Bettina Tarn 'lO calls "oversimplified and superficial coverage of Darfur" through its monthly radio show.
According to Tarn, the driving idea behind DRP is
"activism through education."
"We don't just want to educate people about different
viewpoints," she said. "We want to effect change through
that and create a dialogue between people on the ground,
experts on the field, activists and get everyone to talk

BOOKS

PROJECT

With one show finished, DRP members are determined to hammer out a unique style for their show for
future episodes.
"We knew that we could follow the War News Radio
model, but we thought that this project was different,"
Davis said, "We knew that although we were striving for
objectivity, DRP would have an activist slant and ultimately be a tool for activists to find out about the Darfur
conflict in ways you don't find on your 7 p.m. news."
According to Tarn, upcoming shows will focus on the

debate over the correlation between climate change and
the conflict, and the Darfur education system.
The process of creating the show and getting interviews from contacts such as climate experts and
reporters is simply "creative Googling," Davis said.
"We're looking to fill the holes in coverage so we look
for articles online, we look for reporters, any sort of key
word that can link us to something else," she said. "As
soon as we can find a person, a name, we look up their
contact information and we e-mail them, call them, anything we can to reach them."
After interviewing sources, individual reporters must
work on making the show ready for radio, including

a script incorporating the best quotes from the
interviews, using the audio editing software Protools to
isolate and edit those quotes [and] voicing," DRP member
Jessica Engbretson 'O9 said.
For many DRP members, the task of educating others
about the conflict has led to personal enrichment, as
"writing

well.

"DRP was a way of getting past the oversimplification
and superficiality that characterized so much of the
media's coverage of Darfur [and] of educating myself as
well as getting that information out to a larger audi-

ence," Engebretson said.
"I like that you can be in touch with these people to
really let them tell their stories and speak for themselves, instead of making it all about the activists themselves," Davis said. "Working on this project has really
challenged my own views on Darfur or their economics
or their government works."
For future shows, DRP plans to highlight the rich culture of Darfur in upcoming shows, as well as to expand
coverage to all of Sudan and even Chad.
"We want to incorporate [in the show] a tradition or
dance or Sudanese musician, that is associated with
Darfur but does not get mention since the genocide is the
major focus," Tam said.
The future goals of DPR, however, are "a lot less tangible than the genocide ending or a peace agreement
being signed," Davis said.
"We want to empower the activist out there who
might be disenchanted with the activist movement,"
Davis said, "It's going to be difficult but we know that by
telling these stories, by interviewing these contacts, by
expanding our network of activists, we can take it in the
right direction in terms of the coverage of Darfur."
The DRP airs a monthly show every Sunday on WSRN
915 FM at 11:30 a.m. For previous broadcasts, visit

The Real Old Prospector
Fall Break can be an exhilarating blur of guilt-free
procrastination (otherwise known as "hanging out"),
seeing old friends with new spouses and re-bonding with
family who nag about not calling more while buying free
food. All activities that make a lot of the stresses here
seem less important than they were only a week before.
At first, being back on campus does not end this pleasant effect since fresh tans, anecdotes about red America
and store-bought seasonal attire can make even the most
deluged among us remember that there is indeed life outside a 357-acre arboretum whose study breaks always
have hummus and where theses demand multiple steps.
Unfortunately, this Imaginationland of peace will
inevitably break down and return to pre-break norms
once an old stress/ex rears an ugly/distressingly attractive head. This "not if but when" can be anything from an
immediate essay assignment to realizing that your alarm
clock has been on for eight straight days, but my hunch
is that for many, the frustration returned at the library

bizarre cauldron of doom, the nexus of all confusion can
often be found clumped like hairs in a Hallowell drain
around the first floor printers. With the other printers

importance to everyone who uses the library.
Because the two machines seem to be playing a
zero-sum game where both can't possibly be positive at the same time, usually ten or twelve students are expectantly waiting for their sustenance to be bestowed around one exhausted
printer.

The mixture of democracy and do-it-yourself vigilantism at these frequent events are

frantically launch themselves at the 60 page pile

As Halloween continues to get closer, it
starts to seem less and less likely that my
grand plan of building a giant plane that I
can wear as a costume and attaching plastic toy snakes to myself will actually mateespecially considering that such a
rialize
costume would probably require me to go
into Philadelphia, or at least into the

Ville.

For those of us who usually
leave most things, including
Halloween costumes, for the
last minute, but don't really
want to stop showering until
Halloween and go to the party

as Willets, here are some
cheap, easy and non-smelly
ways you can dress up without

having to venture into the
unknown forests that lay
beyond the Swarthmore campus.

God's Gift
Materials: gift bow, string,
paper, marker
Find a big gift bow and stick it
onto your chest. Make a tag for
yourself that says "From: God, To:
Women" and tie it around your neck.
Now walk around with an arrogant
smirk on your face, you great big

ighty-whities
Okay, so maybe this one's a little
rerdone, but I don't think it's quite as
Dad as throwing a white sheet over your-

self and pretending to be a ghost. Just put on a pair of
tighty-whities and a white button-down shirt, scrunch a
pair of tube socks around your ankles, put on the sunglasses and slide across the floor every time you need to
move.

For those of us who usually leave
most things, including Halloween
costumes, for the last minute, but
don't really want to stop showering..
and go to the party as Willets
...

Everyone, Apparently
Really Happy to See
Materials: a banana, a sense of humor
This one's strictly for the boys. On your next trip to
Sharpies, grab a banana on your way out and bring it
back to your dorm. Put it into your pocket, but not commake sure you can still see the top of the
pletely
banana sticking out a little. When people ask what you
are, say "I'm just happy to see you!" Brilliant, I say, but
everyone might not share my sense of humor.
Virginia Woolf
Materials: a long dress with pockets, stones
This one's my favorite, and though it's intended to be
a costume for girls, guys are more than welcome to try
and pull this one off. Find a long, vintage dress with
some pockets, tie your hair back in a low ponytail and go
out and fill your pockets with stones you find around
campus. Please don't walk too close to Crum Creek,
though, Ms. Virginia Woolf.
...

The art of the costume from a veteran's perspective
through Willets, I found myself pawing
through my closet to come up with a 15minute fix. Thus the Cat-alyst for Change
was born. I worried then and am surer
now
that a girl in a cat costume means
one of two things, neither of them flattering: either she's trying too hard to be
sexy, or she really likes cats. Like, a lot.
So I wore black and ears and, as a finishing touch, a presidential campaign button
and an index card with
(it was 2004!)
alyst for change" scrawled across it. I like
to think it was charmingly clumsy.
On the one hand, pun costumes
a
slip and a cigar and you're a "Freudian
Slip," some string pinned to a black tee
shirt and you're "String Theory" —are
often relatively quick. The focus is on the
idea, rather than the execution, so there's
a lot of room for imprecision. On the
other hand, puns are risky, since the
boundaries between "witty," "eye-rollinducing" and "unbearably pretentious"
are blurry. I'm not against them as costumes (or above them in life), but they
rarely contribute to the blessedly unironic visual spectacle that is Halloween. And
also, you have to explain them. All night.
Animals: I really like the total rejection of wit, irony and sex appeal that an
earnest animal costume (not a bunny,
with ears and a tail and little else, but a
rabbit) offers. I think it's really funny.
However, speaking from the year I was a
sheep (get it? It's not funny! It's not ironic! It's not sexy! It's just...a sheep!!), I may

the help of friends' closets offer the perpetually tempting possibility of going as a

green and be "environmentally friendly,"

you're "Inspi(red)", etc. The possibilities
probably aren't endless, but there are a
lot of them.

People: People should really be further
subdivided into four basic and somewhat

Famous,
categories:
overlapping
Historical, Professional and Fictional.
There are, however, some overarching
challenges that span classification. When
you go as another person, you have the
advantage that you, by virtue of also
being a person, are already half in costume before you start. At the same time,
you forfeit some of the most obvious
markers of costume-ness: the ears and
tails and horns that immediately identify
you as Transformed.

[Puns] rarely contribute to
the blessedly unironic visual
spectacle that is Halloween.
And also, you have to
explain them. All night.
Staying within the species can be overly subtle. This is particularly true if
you're trying to go as someone who is
iconic but basically generic looking, identifiable less by personal style (which you
can imitate) than by facial structure
(which is much harder to fake). Hanson,
for example, is relatively easy. Matt
Damon and Ben Affleck are not. If you've
got the gown, Queen Elizabeth I is more
recognizable (though possibly less funny)
than Queen Elizabeth 11.
The problem with people, particularly
historic figures, is expense. Because they
tend to require incredible specificity to be
identifiable, and because it's less likely
you own exactly the right pair of jodhpurs

that scream Katharine Hepburn, people
outfits risk inordinate (over $10) expense.
Trinity Thrift Shop, Goodwill, friends'
closets, eßay/craigslist/freecycle and the
Target $1 bins are all possible sources.
The costume shop, alas, is not.
Sexy
: If you must go with the college Halloween party classic, "Sexy fill-inthe-blank", go counterintuitive. Even
done tongue-in-cheek and with one eyebrow raised, sexy witch/cat/nurse/wench
seems trite and trying too hard. Sexy

something-that-is-inherently-not-sexy has
more appeal: Sexy George Washington!
Sexy penguin!
Classic Halloween: Witches, ghosts,
zombies, pumpkins and mummies are so
obvious they're often overlooked. While
the classic sheet-with-eyeholes ghost outfit makes navigating crowded parties difficult (though not, perhaps, impossible),
these tried-and-true staples are the
Halloween equivalent of the little black

dress. Unlike the little black dress,

though, witch/ghost/zombie outfits are
almost always best homemade. Skip those
ready-made faux-satin outfits from
Halloween superstores, and do it yourself.
Group Costumes: Whether you're
going as one half of a couple, with one
friend, or a group, costumes en masse are
often more impressive than solo efforts.
One ninja turtle is fine; four is a hit. A
Danny Tanner costume is nothing without Uncles Jesse and Joey. A group costume guarantees you'll have people to get
ready with. The problem is that the costume risks dissolution once you actually
enter whatever party you're going to and
are separated from your crew by the
debaucherous crowd. Luckily, by midevening, the costume is rarely the point
anymore and if Donatello has been separated from Raphael, well, probably no
one's going to notice.

Refuge Art

Show

The Refuge Art Show will raise money to rebuild houses destroyed in the Aug. 17 Peruvian earthquake
BY JOAN KIM

jkim3@swarthmore.edu

From Nov. 17-30, a group of Swarthmore students working with Amnesty International will be featuring students'
photographs in the Refuge Art Show and Silent Auction in
Shane Lounge. This year's show will be modeled after last
year's Global Citizenship Art Show and Auction, also hosted
in Shane Lounge.

The organization also plans to help rebuild the 33 schools
destroyed.

The students expect 40-50 photographs to be submitted in
the coming weeks. The photos will be shown in Shane
Lounge where spectators can bid for any photograph during
the event. Before the photographs are sold, an e-mail will be
sent out to bidders in case they were outbid and want another chance at a photograph.

The auction will be raising money for the charity, Un

Techo Para mi Pais ("A Roof for my Country"), which is
starting an initiative to build over 300 houses in the aftermath of the Aug. 15 Peruvian earthquake thatreached 7.9 on
the Richter scale and was estimated to have killed more than
500 people, injured over a thousand and displaced tens of
thousands.
After many tragedies, people soon become numb to news
reports and statistics seen on televisions, read in newspapers and heard on radios. News of the earthquake gradually
disappeared from newspapers even in Peru while the
tremors of the aftershocks continued to knock down buildings and cause more casualties. "Coverage was poor in
newspapers in Peru [even though it is] not something that
has ended," organizer Alfredo Chuquihuara 'lO said.

"We had to be at Swarthmore so we
wanted to do anything that we could
do to help people out there. Away
from home, we still wanted to do
something to raise awareness."
Frances Kvietok 'lO

"It costs nothing for them to send a
picture and it's for a good cause."
Alfredo Chuquihuara 'ID
Many of the photographs have been submittedfrom students who have been abroad, but photographs from within
the United States are also welcome. "We want to encourage
people to sendphotos this week. It costs nothing for them to
send a picture and it's for a good cause," Chuquihuara said.
"Students shouldn'tbe discouraged if they are not... photographer [s]," added Kvietok.
Since the proceeds are going to Un Techo Para mi Pais,
it's "important that people know that this event is contributing to a pretty concrete cause," Montufar said.
After this event, the students are planning to sell
Peruvian jewelry to "support local economies," Kvietok said.
The silent auction will be the first of several fundraisers to
help the people affected by the disaster.
If you want to contribute, send a high-resolution image
by e-mail to amnestyart@gmail.com or send a hard copy
through campus mail to Garcia-Montufar. You can also stop
by the silent auction to bid on the artwork of other students
or purchase Peruvian jewelry.

Even Peruvians found it difficult to help with the crisis.
"There was little we could do at home," organizer Diego
Garcia-Montufar 'O9 said. While he could send in donations
and take food to those who could transport it to needy areas,
it was difficult to reach the affected areas. With the new
school year approaching, Garcia-Montufar would also have
run the risk of being trapped and not being able to return to

Swarthmore.
Yet he, and other Swarthmore students from Peru,

remained hopeful.
"We didn't think it was too late. We felt there was something more [that we could do because] help is needed for
years to come," Montufar added.
"We had to be at Swarthmore so we wanted to do anything that we could do to help people out there," Frances
Kvietok 10 said. "Away from home, we still wanted to do
something to raise awareness."
Instead of blindly choosing a charity to receive the pro-

ceeds, the organizers searched for a charity that would most

benefit the Peruvian people.
"There has been a lot of corruption. We know there is a
South American organization that builds houses," Kvietok
said.
Through research, they decided on Un Techo Para mi
Pais after they found out that the homes that the organization had built in the area of the earthquake had not fallen
during the disaster and that the organization had a history
of working with college students in Lima. They "specifically
developed a project to build over 300 houses for the thousands of families displaced in the earthquake," Kvietok said.

"Hate" speech?

I was greatly disturbed by Abigail Graber's op-ed
piece in The Phoenix last week. In it, she says
Ahmadinejad's speech at Columbia University was
hate speech, and that hate speech
should not be given a public forum.
I disagree with this on both levels.
Ahmadinejad's speech was not hate
speech, and even if it were, it was right for
Columbia to let him speak.
Graber boldly claims, "The Holocaust was a

moral abomination. Holocaust denial is a moral
abomination." I think mostly everyone will agree,
including me, that the Holocaust was a moral abomination. But, Holocaust denial is not a moral abomination. Since when has holding a mere idea
become a moral abomination? Maybe the inquisitors during the Spanish Inquisition will beg to differ with me, but I can think and believe whatever I

Silencing of chalkings problematic

want. Denying the Holocaust, while historically
unjustifiable, is not hateful. Saying that Hitler was
justified in killing Jews may be considered hate
speech, but a simple act of denying the Holocaust is
not hateful.

This is not about Ahmadinejad's
right to speak, it is about our
right to listen.

LAUREN MENDOZA

We Need to Talk

But let's suppose for a moment that Holocaust
denial is indeed hateful. I don't concede for a
moment that it is, but let's follow this chain of logic.
I still claim that Ahmadinejad's speech should have
been given the public venue. Graber is perfectly
correct in pointing out that there was absolutely no
legal obligation to let him speak. But I would like to
argue from a higher stance of our moral obligation
to protect free speech, even if it is hateful. Could she
be afraid that people might be offended? How dare
she be as insulting as to make an assumption about
the public's ability to discern. This is not about
Ahmadinejad's right to speak, it is about our right
to listen. As the author Christopher Hitchens
points out, every time you censor speech, you take
away the right of the public to hear something.
Indeed, it is helpful to grant people like
Ahmadinejad a public forum, because it helps us
reevaluate what we know. What would you say to
someone from the Flat Earth Society? How do we
know what we know? It is our duty as rational,

skeptical beings that we constantly question the
evidence. Therefore, it is imperative and necessary
to give minority opinions a public forum, no matter
how hurtful, incorrect or appalling. When Graber
said, "There is no debate to be had on these subjects," I hope she meant that Holocaust denial is an
irrational position to hold. I hope she did not mean
that any point of view that is unpopular or hurtful

should be silenced.
Let me also argue from a more practical standpoint. If we were to ban hate speech, to whom would
we grant the power to decide what is hateful? For
example, one remembers well the incident in 2005
where a Danish newspaper printed a cartoon with
the prophet Muhammad, and a violent uprising
around the world caused many deaths. Should we
leave it to Muslims to decide what we can or cannot
draw, simply because they find certain things offensive? Should we leave it to the Christians to decide
what we can or can't say? Meanwhile, the religious
often get away with hurtful speech with the excuse
that it is part of their religious belief. If we are
going to continue letting ministers preach homophobia in public settings and let the Bible stay in
print for that matter, then we better be consistent
and allow freedom of all expression, no matter how
incorrect or hurtful.

It's Coming Out Week at
Swarthmore, a week for
students who self-identify
as queer to celebrate their
sexual and gender identities. During the wee,k there
are discussions, panels,
exhibits and some very
explicit sidewalk drawings
that explore the subject of
sexuality. Unlike previous
years, however, the explicit
chalkings this year have

been restricted to Magill
Kohlberg
Walk
and
Courtyard. These new constraints are meant to prevent the divisive issue from becoming hostile, but seem to be another form of oppression of the
chalkers and their free speech.
During the campus' Coming Out Week in Fall 2006, many
students criticized the graphic images drawn in front of
Sharpies and several campus buildings. Drawings included
images of anal sex, genitalia and masturbation. For some students, the drawings were a symbol of queer sexuality, which
is often kept silent, while others were offendedby their explicitness. The Swarthmore Queer Union also organized an open
meeting so students could express their points of view on the
controversial topic, but the meeting ended withoutresolve for
many students. For me, last year's chalking episode was a
chance for students to come out as an ally to the queer community. I was outraged that certain students would object to
an activity that, for some students, is a powerful demonstration of self-expression. But the reality was that some of the
students complaining were victims of sexual abuse who felt
uncomfortable with the sexual nature of the drawings or
queer students who didn'tfeel the sexual chalkings expressed
what Coming Out Week meant to them. To try to be an ally to
Swat Survivors, SQU decided to draw explicit chalkings only
in designated areas on campus that could be avoided by those
who chose to.
Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB, who has leadership roles in SQU

and COLORS, said that she felt it was important to be an ally
to the students who felt the chalkings triggered memories of
sexual abuse, but many of the objections to last year's chalkings were rooted in homophobia. Shouldn't students try to
offer the same support given by LGBTQ students by being
allies to their community? Feeling uncomfortable with explicit sexuality because of sexual abuse is a valid objection, but
the purpose of the chalkings isn't to make anyone feel threatened or oppressed by sex. The chalkings use sex as an empowering form of liberation and self-representation for the individual chalkers. Chalkings enable queer students participating in Coming Out Week to put queer sex out into the public
realm for people to see as something that's neither shameful
nor obscene. For some queer students, chalkings act as a tool
of communication to unite them as a community. Chalkings
act as a declaration that sex doesn't have to be repressed, and
I don't see the problem with that.
We go to a liberal arts college that prides itself on tolerating the different values and views of others, however the
queer community endures their fair share of discrimination.
If people are telling them what they do is abnormal from the
October 25, 2007

rest of our society, aren't we supposed to be the ones who
know better? The chalkings promote awareness of queer
issues to the entire campus so that it can get the necessary
attention in order to progress. During this week students
should offer their support to anyone who asks for, or in this
case, demands it. Treating lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered sex as something that should be kept hush-hush is
what is truly offensive and oppressive. During the Clothesline
Project, few students objected to offering their support to victims of sexual abuse. Why should it be any different when it
comes to supporting victims of sexual oppression?
One of the most important aspects of Coming Out Week is
making queer and questioning students aware of support networks available to them on campus, to make sure the campus
stays a safe and welcoming place for queer students. But
when people object to the actions that are supposed to empower the LGBTQ community, what kind of message does that
send? By censoring where the chalkings are and what they
represent, we risk the escalation from a divisive issue to a
flat- out denial of the sexual individuality of the LGBTQ community. This censorship acts as another way of telling chalkers to keep quiet and to feel ashamed about what they are trying to say.
I am aware that, for some people, seeing an image of
female genitalia in front of Sharpies on the night of their
favorite bar might set off their appetite just a bit. That's fair,
and I have gone through the trouble of figuring out some creative ways to avoid this situation. If it is bothersome enough,
just use the back entrance to the dining hall for a few days. If
that's too much of an inconvenience for you, how about pretending its one of those fancy paintings by Georgia O' Keefe?
Or think of this week as a vacation from Sharpies and check
out the appetizing selections hot off the grill from Essie Mae's.
And when you are on your way to class and come across a
chalking, well what better way to wake up for class than having your inhibitions shaken?
But in all seriousness, the free speech issue goes both
ways. If Coming Out Week is something that truly disturbs
you, you have as much right to speak out as those who speak
in favor of it. All I ask is that during this week all students try
to be aware of the needs of the other individuals involved. For
chalkers, the drawings portrayed throughout campus represent something they desperately need to get off their chests.
Acknowledge the tension that exists during this week and be
considerate to everyone who needs help, including both queer
students and survivors.
Sure, some of the events during Coming Out Week are
very much in your face, but they do not stray from the persisting effort to make Swat a safe and accepting place for its
LGBTQ population. As the campus and country culture as a
whole transform, you can't simply close your eyes and hope
explicitness and sexuality will fade away. You can't censor the
real world, so why try to do it here? If you feel uncomfortable
in a situation where you are asked to deal with this topic,
realize that you are here at Swat because you want to help
make the world a better, more understanding place. To do
that sometimes you have to be a little radical and outspoken.
To make progress, sometimes we need to step out of our comfort zones, and if we are just going to censor everything that
makes us feel uncomfortable, what's the point?

Exotic locales rarely the paradise of popular media
Here's

some-

thing my friend and
I saw one night. We

were eating burritos
and drinking cheap
wine by candlelight
by

necessity:

there was no electricity
outside
our
hostel.
Surreally enough, a
camera
crew
appeared, and it was
JOSH COHEN
filming a beautiful
strutting
woman
I Got the Bullets
down a cobblestone
road while trailed
by a creeping horsedrawn carriage. There were about 20 other tourists eating
where we were and we all watched.
Meanwhile, two boys, who couldn't have been more than
13 and who, one woman whispered to us, were like all the
other crack-addled kids in the city, were sneakily weaving
their way through the tables and picking the remains off our
plates while we watched the woman walk. When they got
sick of not being paid attention to the boys began to throw
rocks at the camera crew. In no time, two policemen on
motorcycles showed up and beat the snarling, wailing boys
with their clubs. People stood up, edged for a view, cheered
and laughed. The hostel manager, a repatriated native who
had just moved back from Florida, came up to my friend and
me and said, nervously smiling, "So, you like the show we're

putting on for you?"
I'm not sure this is a story worth telling. It happened this
summer in Granada, Nicaragua, but it's not like this sort of
thing doesn't happen in cities everywhere. And yet, what
the unnerving transformation of a' depraved
happened
felt indicative of
reality into a performance for tourists
something deeper about Granada, which, like many other
impoverished Latin American cities, has rapidly developed
a bullish tourist economy in the past decade. I don't really
know whether such a dependent one-track economic boom is

really so auspicious, but I know that Granada, which looks,
in an eerily beautiful way, exactly like the colonial city it
was 100 years ago, is a disturbing place to befor the way that
tourists currently dominate its culture.
I don't think I'd write about this if not for the two articles
about Granada that have appeared in the Travel section of
the New York Times in the past month. Really, I read the
articles because I wanted to read about where I had been
but I didn't recognize the Granada that either of the Times'
writers described. I recognized the names of the places, but
not because they were in my Lonely Planet: almost all of the
hotels and restaurants mentioned in the articles were "on
the Square," which is a perimeter of four blocks facing
inward onto the European-modeled central city park. My
friend and I had to avoid these, not only because they boasted Manhattan prices, but because they recalled some absurd
reenactment of nineteenth century colonialism.
That's the indefatigable irony of a newly capitalist country led by the "reformed" Sandinista, Daniel Ortega; as the
pro-market writer Alvaro Vargas Llosa put it in a New York
Times editorial: "[the new leaders] fall over themselves pandering to the church, the business community and conservative voters," so that "there's little time left over for creating a New Man [i.e. social reform]." Thus the normalization
of an old-fashioned image: that of old, rude white diners sitting at balcony tables while catered to by dressed-up locals—a fact which felt unconnected to me until I read the New

York Times articles. For this was what the Times' writers
called Granada's "colonial elegance" and "enduring charm."
Horse-drawn carriages were, according to one writer,
'lalmost overkill," as if the starving, beaten horses, cynically
sycophantic carriage drivers and everyone else were actors
in a Disneyland
as if this city were made for us. Granada
possessed a "particular genius" in maintaining its colonial
artifices to charm future Western tourists
a notion which
is, to be generous, a delusion.
The Times' writers do evoke some life beyond the Parque
Central when they write about the hip "after dark" party
scene, the bustling streets, live music and sexy couples,
which I did experience, though I wish I had resisted. If our
parents' generation are ugly westerners abroad, then ours is
hideous, man: every popular bar and club has been remod-

eled by mostly wealthy kids to look like the college parties
they throw back home. Indeed, one Times writer writes of
the new Zoom Bar's "transplanted honky-tonk
decorated
with college football jerseys and lewd bumper stickers"
developbut his happy point is this: "make no mistake
ment is afoot."
I know the Times articles are, economically speaking,
innocent. Times readers demand to know where they can go
to be comfortable. And I suppose if people want to waste
their money to fashion the same experience in Nicaragua,
Bolivia, Chile and Honduras, to go somewhere to go
nowhere, well, who am I? It's a Travel section: their job is to
satisfy demand, not to create it. And yet, couldn't a Travel
section be the very place to correct the strictly rational representations of a place and people that politicians and pundits must subscribe to? Isn't any representation of another
place or people, in any medium or genre, a political act?
It is possible that the Travel writer really only saw what
he wanted to see. Really, though, I think the truth is something that is true about too many writers
especially no,
even those that identify, like one of the Times writers, as former "solidarity gringos"
when writing about seriously
destitute foreign countries: in opposition to cold political
realism (and the merciless negativity ofNews sections), they
paint a selectively pretty picture of the people that they want
to receive better attention and treatment from the rest of the
world. Such wishful depictions actually do these places vio...

...

lence, though.
It's interesting (in an academic way), to realize that the
majority of the praise in both New York Times articles is in
fact for the abundant, incredibly unsullied natural and artificial beauty that surrounds and stands for Granada. From
the top of the Iglesia La Merced, one of the writers sees the
"hulking Mombacho volcano," though he does gaze down at
Granada: "The setting was book-cover perfect, down to the
tree-lined Parque Central at the center of town, festooned
with gazebos and peddler stalls and surrounded on all sides
by colonial-style buildings from which modernity has mostly been expunged or simply failed to take root." That's a good
sell. Who lives there?

For further greening, Swarthmore should look to solar energy
watt-hour or even less and solar photovoltaic electricity cost about 22 cents per kilowatt
hour, or greater, depending on location and
other variables. In 1997, it made sense for
Earthlust to begin petitioning Swarthmore
administration to purchase wind power. Up
until recently solar energy was prohibitive-

RASA PETRAUSKAITE

The Bright Future
A substantial amount of energy that
College purchases comes from
companies affiliated with windmills.
However, none of it comes from solar energy. Options like purchasing energy from
power plants that use sunlight, installing
solar panels or using energy from biofuel
are becoming comparable in price to wind
energy. Currently, those who look to support
of
alternative
development
further
resources now invest increasingly into solar
technologies and if Swarthmore strives to
remain on par with leaders in environmental protection, it should not only minimize
its carbon footprint, but also support the
firms that have the most potential to stop
global warming. Thus, the college should
support solar technologies by purchasing
solar energy.
Solar power was much more expensive
than wind energy up until recently.
According to California Institute of
Technology professor Nathan S. Lewis, in
2000 wind energy cost about 4 cents per kilo-

Swarthmore

THE PHOENIX

ly expensive for Swarthmore to contemplate
buying it.
Although solar energy is still more
expensive than coal and wind power at the
moment, it is becoming cheaper as time goes
on. According to Reuters, the costs of solar
energy are dropping by around five percent
a year, and it may become as cheap as burning coal in as few as five years. This is
expected to happen in the sunnier parts of
the U.S. by 2015.
The fact that solar power is becoming
much more cost-effective than before is evident from an increase in the quantity that is

demanded in the United States. About a
month ago, ABC News reported that two of
America's biggest power utilities announced
multi-billion-dollar expansions of their solar
power supply. The utilities are confidently
predicting that their solar power will cost no
more than coal energy. Also, this past summer Pacific Gas & Electric Company signed
a contract with two developers of utilityscale photovoltaic solar power companies,
Cleantech America and GreenVolts, to deliver seven megawatts of solar energy. Earlier
this month, Kohl's Department Stores began
operating one of their rooftop solar panels
and committed to building them at 63 of
their 80 California locations. Such actions
demonstrate that solar power is more costeffective now than it was a decade ago.
On the other hand, the cost of wind energy has not decreased much, if at all, over the

past decade. According to WorldWatch
Institute, the latest major breakthrough in

wind technology came from China, when the
developers built a large windmill that was 20
percent more efficient than regular windmills and which required 50 percent less
expense on operation. The cost was just
under five cents per kilowatt, which is actually more than what Lewis cited as the cost
of wind energy in 2000. In light of these facts
and projections, we can deduce that
installing solar panels at Swarthmore or
purchasing energy from solar power plants
will likely be more cost-effective than buying more wind energy in future years.
In addition, solar technologies are more
worthy of support in the long run than are
windmills. "The sun has a unique role in
sustainable energy production, in that it is
the undisputed champion of energy; the
resource base presented by terrestrial insulation far exceeds that ofall other renewable
energy sources combined," Professors
Nathan S. Lewis and Daniel G. Nocera conclude in an article published in Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences. Lewis
also explains that solar energy is the only
renewable energy resource that can possibly
have a large enough supply to meet the global demand if global warming is to be slowed
down by 2050. Lewis implies that those who
intend on helping to slow down global warming should promote technologies that use the
energy of the sun more than other renewable sources. So, if Swarthmore wants to
contribute to the popularity of solar panels,
it can begin installing solar panels some
time in the near future.
In fact, solar energy is no longer prohibitively expensive for Swarthmore. The energy is now cheaper than it was five years ago

October 25, 2007

even to individual consumers. I read a summary of the interview that Swarthmore professor E. Carr Everbach conducted with a
representative from Mesa Solar Inc. last
year, in which he wrote that he would have
to pay them$Bl,OOO for the initial installation
of a 700 square-foot array of panels on the
roof his house. He could then subsequently
gain about $2OOO per year by saving on energy bills. While $Bl,OOO is a substantial cost for
an individual homeowner, this is not much
for Swarthmore. Between 2004 and 2006, the
college spent on average about $1,300,000 per
year on electricity. The college would spend
less than one ten-thousandth of its annual
electricity budget if it decided to install one
700 square-foot array of solar panels.
While one 700-square-foot array of solar
panels would not provide much energy, it
would still make Swarthmore a consumer of
solar power. Even if only on a symbolic
level, this would be an achievement. The college could then install more panels in future
years when the technology would be more
cost-effective.
In conclusion, before Swarthmore commits to purchasing more wind energy in
coming years, it should re-examine its
options. While buying wind energy might
have been the best option several years ago,
recent research and market news seems to
indicate that solar panels are likely to
become the most cost-efficient energy source
in the coming decade. Swarthmore will
remain a leader among colleges in environmental protection whether it uses wind or
solar energy. Yet it will become a global
leader among private institutions in this if it

promotes the use of solar energy.

African Union lost sight of its original premise

The first stanza of

These lines exemplify the ethos of the
African Union. They
speak of a collective
where
brotherhood,
each country looks out
for its neighbors, near
and far, in order to defend collective African "liberty and
unity"- against potential threats. That sounds great. What
is not great is howthe African Union seems to define the
threats . It appears as though the African Union feels
these threats come solely from their old colonial masters
and, ironically, not their own misconstrued African leadership. The hype surrounding the next European Union
African Summit exemplifies this in such an ironically
sadistically beautiful manner; I could not resist the urge
to write about it.
The common theme in some of the more recent headlines in Europe and Africa, have been, "European Union
Africa summit in danger", "Gordon Brown threatens to
boycott E.U. Africa summit if Robert Mugabe is invited"
-and "We won't let our past colonial masters dictate to us".
What is all this fuss about?
In 2002, when faced with the threat of losing the elections in Zimbabwe, President Mugabe resorted to desperate measures. He initiated a disorderly land grab
onslaught on the white-owned commercial farms as a
crude means of winning the vote of the disenchanted poor
electorate. In addition, the once nascent political opposition was forcefully brought to heel with arbitrary arrest

This haphazard agrarian reform resulted in a sharp
economic downturn. Productivity went down, unemployment shot up and inflation touched the 3500 percent
mark. The people's protests against the economic downturn were met with a violent response from the government. This prompted the European Union to impose
directed sanctions against top government officials and
their families and it also led to the Zimbabwe's expulsion
from the Commonwealth.
With the E.U.
Africa summit coming up this
December, Portugal, the host country, has invited
President Mugabe to attend despite the E.U. sanctions
against him and his government. Prime Minister Gordon
Brown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland has said that he would not attend if
President Mugabe did as he felt that Mugabe's presence
"would undermine the summit, [and] divert attention
from the important issues that need to be resolved."
This is that ironic sadistic beauty appearing.
What finally brought out a united response from the
African heads of state was not the human right atrocities
and economic meltdown that Zimbabweans suffered
under, but rather that the leaders felt that they were
being dictated to by Gordon Brown.
"I will not go to Portugal if Mugabe is not allowed. I
don't know how many of us [African leaders] will be pre-

pared to go to Portugal without Mugabe," said Levy
Mwanawasa, president ofZambia and chairman-ofSADC.
The plight of the Zimbabweans is forgotten because a
political leader's ego has been bruised. If African political
leaders had genuine interest in the welfare of their people, they would be taking a tough principled stand on
President Mugabe. We should not need the Gordon
Browns, "our past colonial Masters", to tell us that all is
not well in Zimbabwe. It is as if our African political leaders do not seem to see, or at the very least refuse to
acknowledge, the severity of their misconstrued leadership. Dr Gertrude Mongella, the Tanzanian president of
the Pan-African Parliament, referred to Zimbabwe as
simply having "some problems."

It appears as though the African
Union feels these threats come
solely from their old colonial
masters and not their own
misconstrued African leadership.

-

The situation in Zimbabwe pales into insignificance
compared to the situation in Darfur. Our continental
political leaders have been evading the matter and taken

no real strong condemnation of the Darfur situation. The
African Union has not taken the necessary urgent steps
to halt this ongoing human tragedy. Ironically, the
moment that Gordon Brown points a finger at the errant
behavior of one of their members they all spring into
action and in unison cry "foul." They strongly protest the
erosion of their collective dignity and not the abject welfare of the ordinary African citizen.
The big brothers in the African Union are not watching.

Re-defining "stigma' means self-reflection
BY ASHLEY WERNER

awernerl@swarthmore.edu

Having traditionally taken the word "stigma" for granted, I was struck by Harold Maio's indignation over its use,
expressed in his article "Re-evaluating Stigma" in The
Phoenix's October 11th issue. Maio claims

T\m

tnat k y describing the experience of living
with a mental illness in society with the
word "stigma," we turn the concrete experience of prejudice and discrimination into an abstraction.
After exploring more of his writings that address the role
of language in attaching shame to mental illness, I saw that
Maio brings to light an important point: the term "stigma"
carries the connotation of a pervasive atmosphere of discrimination, but does not identify particular actors or
actions to hold accountable. In using the term while failing
to elucidate the specific circumstances that leave one feeling
branded or "stigmatized," we paint ourselves in defenseless
opposition to an over-arching and untouchable force.
Unlike race, class, and gender issues at Swarthmore, we, as
students, have yet to deconstruct the behavioral patterns
giving rise to a sense of "stigma" surrounding mental health
■ip

issues.

We must develop an awareness of
discriminatory qualities within our own
words, actions, and inactions, as well
as those of our media, our schools,
and our friends.
Despite the problems inherent to the word that cause
Maio to argue against it, many living with a form of mental
illness do experience a sense of submitting to, resisting or
overcoming something unnamable, amorphous and nearly
übiquitous in their interactions with society; an experience

20

which they term "stigma". These interactions may range
from exposure to advertisements, watching television,
socializing at a party or talking with a close friend.

We, as students, have yet to
deconstruct the behavioral patterns
giving rise to a sense of "stigma"
surrounding mental health issues.
In any of these situations, when the individual experiences a sense of stigma associated with mental illness, he or
she may not be consciously aware of the particular image,
statement, tone of voice or facial expression that signaled
discrimination or prejudice on the other end of the interaction. Yet, environmental cues may trigger this "sense" experienced as an awareness of a negative or biased misperception of individuals with mental illness or even simply as a
physical response causing the individual to, for example,
tighten up.
In learning to recognize and name the signals that make
one feel stigmatized, we can begin to address existing prejudices with concrete examples of their manifestations.
Unlike Maio, I would not call for "immediate apology or
redress", even though deserved, but for dialogue serving to
demystify and humanize the experience of persons who
have lived with a mental illness. As a community, we must
first shine light on our unacknowledged prejudices surrounding mental illness and then take responsibility to drop
the preconceived notions with which we categorize and
brand people. We must develop an awareness of discriminatory qualities within our own words, actions and inac-

tions, as well as those of our media, our schools and our
friends. From this springboard, we can move beyond old
mentalities by cultivating a culture rooted in an open-minded desire to understand those around us in which compassion, not judgment, is our first instinct.

Swat harriers pass final test before championships
BY MELISSA CRUZ
mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, Oct. 13th, both Swarthmore's men's and
women's cross country teams competed in two highlight
events of the season. While the men raced the DeSales
University Invitational in Center Valley, Pa., the women
ran the traditional Seven Sisters Championships, held

Swarthmore came home with a fourth place finish out of
the six competing teams.
"The course was very narrow, so they started the race
of 60 runners with the top 10 of each team getting a head
start of a few minutes, then they let the rest go," Stanley
said of the race. She also said that because it was so narrow, it made it hard to move and so, "if you didn't start off
fast, it made it hard to move especially in the middle of the

"There was a lot of arm-swinging, and girls were running aggressively," Davies said. Stanley also added that
"this race had the most physical contact I've ever seen or
had in a cross country race." Despite the unusual circumstances surrounding this annual tradition, they still said
the race was fun, and a good way to lead into fall break.
The Swarthmore harriers will compete in their next
race this Saturday at the Conference Championships, held
in Lancaster, Pa.

course."

competing schools.
"[The course] was a tough one with plenty of hills, a
true cross country course," Andrew Vanßuren 'lO said.
"We came in third place, but I'm not weighing it too
heavily," Hodson said. "Honestly, we didn't have so many
of our tough competitors there, like Haverford. I think the
race went well, though." After running a hard race, the
teams were able to unwind by "going to war," Vanßuren
said. "We broke into an all-out war, throwing corn cobs at
each other in the fields that were nearby, you know, solely for the purpose of mapping out a possible future
course."
The Swarthmore ladies also wasted no time in their
competition. Leading lady Emma Stanley 'O9 completed
the 5k race with a remarkable tenth place finish out of 94
runners, and a time of 19:38. Following right at her heel, in
the trio-style that has been formed this season, came
Nyika Corbett 'lO and Ashley Davies 'lO, with respective
sub-20-minute times of 19:39 and 19:46. They left the course
with 11th and 14th place finishes overall.
Another pack that was prevalent in this year's Seven
Sisters' race was formed by Bess Ritter 'O9 (20:11), Kathy
Feeny 'O9 (20:12), Chelsea Brett 'll (20:18) and Lauren
DeLuca 'lO (20:22). These Swat ladies fought their way to
finish with 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th place finishes.

Swat runners Jonnie Tompkins, Micah Katz, Ross Weller and Erik Saka run a workout in the Crum earlier this season.

The Swat men were led on the course by Erik Saka 'O9,
who completed the 8k race in 27 minutes, 1 second, landing him with a stellar ninth place finish overall out of 184
runners total. Merely a stride's length behind Saka, finishing in 10th place with a time of 27:10, came Ross Weller
'OB. The two have been running races all season in this
apparent duo, interchanging who places before the other.
Following right behind this pair, finishing third for the
Garnet men and 15th overall came first-year Patrick
Hartnett, crossing the finish line in an impressive 27:30.
Another top senior who has been a strong asset to the
team's overall finish and placement is Mickey Katz, who
placed fourth for the team and 18th in the race in 27:48.
The fifth Swat harrier to complete the race was Dan
Hodson, with a time of 28:25, landing him with a 32nd
place finish. The Swarthmore men placed third out of 20

gernaut that is Boston sports, I reconfirmed my allegiances. It's hard not to feel
good when the Patriots are simply otherworldly, the Red Sox just made a gutsy
comeback to win the American League
Pennant and even the Boston College football team is undefeated thus far. Though
I'm sure not all of this New England success will continue indefinitely, I feel like
I've been reunited with lost friends, proathlete friends.
It's undeniable
the Patriots are that
good. For everyone who got on my back
when the Bill Belicheck taping scandal
broke, all I can say is, come see me. Sure
Miami may not have been a solid opponent this week, but the Patriots put up 49
points, and Tom Brady had six touchdown
passes. He alone connected for 36 points
in my book that's a serious competitor.
The Pats scored more points in the first
half (42) than both teams combined in
eight of the NFL's thirteen games this
week. Their passing attack is surreal and
their defense stingy; certainly no one can
argue that the Patriots aren't playing
championship ball. A quick glance at
numbers shows that the Patriots have
scored an astronomical 279 points this
year, 50 more than the next closest and
over a hundred more than the team which
is considered their biggest rival this sea-

son, the Indianapolis Colts. Going unde-

feated ain't easy, and the jury's still out on
whether this year's Patriots team can do
it, but one thing is certain, they are an
outstanding football team.
Did
I say outstanding football?
Certainly that applies to the 7-0 BC Eagles,
who have taken the nation by storm and
are currently ranked no. 2 in the nation.

Sure BC begins its grueling schedule
stretch this week when it plays no. 8
Virginia Tech, but it's hard not to be
thrilled for the local boys who get over-

looked every year in Bowl Game selections
because they historically haven't sold as
many tickets as some other larger schools.
It's going to be hard not to sell tickets if
quarterback Matt Ryan (top contender for
the Heisman trophy) keeps playing at such
a high-octane pace. In case you wanted to
know, the last Boston College player to win
the Heisman trophy was quarterback Doug
Flutie in 1984, and if you don't like Doug
Flutie, don't ever talk to me again. Though
they will be tested in the coming weeks, it's
hard for me to not be excited about the
great season the boys at Chestnut Hill, MA
are having.
Oh yeah, the Red Sox are playing
decently. I mean what other team would

The Sox went into game seven with a killer
mentality and dismantled the Indians
thanks to 5 RBIs from little (a highly suspect "5-foot-9 inch") Dustin Pedroia. The

Sox have a big task in front of them though,
and records are on the line because if the
white hot Colorado Rockies win game one
of the World Series, they will tie the Red

Garnet field hockey's woes continue

(Catherine

BY ANDREW EISENLOR
aeisenll@swarthmore.edu

Looking to break a four-game losing

streak and gam

momentum as the end of
the season rapidly approaches, the field
hockey team faced another tough series of
matches against Muhlenberg College,
Ursinus College and Gettysburg College
these past two weeks.
Last Wednesday, Oct. 10, the Garnet
travelled to AUentown, PA to face a formidable Muhlenberg team. Outshooting the

Garnet 10-5 in the first half, the Mules managed to score in the 11thminute of play as

Kristen Sabia put in a pass from Nicole
Notarianni. However, the Garnet responded with a goal from Abbie Fischer 'OB in the
final minute of the first half with Ashley
Gunter 'O9 assisting. The two teams were
tied at 1-1 going into the second half, but in
the 64th minute Notarianni notched her
tenth goal of the season and the eventual
game-winner for the Mules, giving them a
2-1 victory. Katie Ashmore 11 had another
strong performance in goal with 10 saves.

On Wednesday, Oct. 17, Swarthmore
had a chance to make a statement with a
win over the defending national champions, the Ursinus Bears, at home. But the
sixth-ranked Bears did not give the Garnet
any opportunity to do so.
The Bears scored eight straight goals in
the first 25 minutes of play, led by junior
Jennie Moore, who scored her 10th and
11th goals of the season, and senior
Lindsay Cappa, whonettedher 15th goal of
the season in the llth minute to give the
Bears a 5-0 edge, fallowing the eight-goal

first half, Ursinus tacked on two more in
the second half, with Jennifer Baysick
scoring the final goal in the 64th minute
(Baysick scored her second goal of the season in the first half).
Feeling the weight of a six-game losing
streak that was capped off by Ursinus' 10-0
shutout, the Garnet arrived at Gettysburg
College in desperate need of a win. The
Bullets, however, showed no mercy, shutting out Swarthmore 6-0. Gettysburg's
Cristi Farrell started the scoring early in
the game with help from Savannah Ruth,
getting her sixth goal of the season in the
second minute of play off a deflection. Less
than half a minute later, the Bullets made
it 2-0 when Nikki Dyer scored off an assist
from Molly Latta.
Gettysburg added two more goals in the
first half from Ruth and Nina Emala.
Emala then opened the scoring withanother goal in the 51st minute. The Bullets
capped off their strong performance when
sophomore Lauren Woodman added a goal
in the 55th minute. The Garnet (5-10, 2-6
CC) are now in 9th place in the Centennial
Conference with two games to go.
Last night, the Garnet traveled to face
off against rival Haverford (6-10, 2-6 CC).
Unfortunately, the Garnet suffered another
loss at the game, ending said game with a
score of 4-0. "I thinkthat there's something
that we ourselves haven't been able to figure out... that's preventing us from scoring," forward Hoa Pham 10 said. "It's not
that we're not in attacking mode, we're
just not capitalizing on the opportunities
we're making for ourselves."
Pham emphasized that the team would
use the winter and spring off-seasons to
reinforce the predominantly young
team's dynamic. "We have the skills, the
strength, the athleticisim we just need
to work off of what everyone else thinks
of as the team," midfielder Devon
Novotnak 11 said.
Swarthmore will end its season with a
home game against Franklin Marshall
(10-5, 6-3 CC) on this Saturday at 1 p.m.

Ladule Lako LoSarah 'O9 and Evan Nesterak 'O9 gave
the Garnet men a huge boost towards the conference playoffs over break, as each scored game-winning goals against
formidable opponents.
Swarthmore's biggest triumph game on Oct. 13, as the
men outlasted Franklin and Marshall College, the ninthranked team in the nation, for a 1-0 win. The teams were
scoreless through the first 90 minutes of regulation play,
with the Diplomats getting off 21 shots to Swarthmore's
six. Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB held tough in the Swarthmore net
with five saves, and was named both Centennial
Conference player of the week and ECAC player of the
week for his stellar performance. "The game could have
gone either way and [Sutcliffe] made some huge saves
early on that kept us in the game," Lako LoSarah said.
Swarthmore's tenacity against F&M paid off 5:31 into

around three defenders to record his seventh goal of the
season, none with better timing.
"That was huge," Coach Eric Wagner said of his team's
win over the Diplomats. "They just put everything together for the first time all season."
Lako LoSarah attributed the win to a change in the
Garnet's mental approach that has come about in the past
few weeks. "After the Johns Hopkins game and the
Gettysburg game we took some time to think and realized
that everyone needed to take some more personal respon-

take from the F&M game is that we have a lot ofheart and

whole time."

"I'm still trying to come down from
the high from F&M."
Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB
"I'm still trying to come down from the high from
F&M," Sutcliffe said. "It was definitely the biggest win I've
ever been a part of here. It's one of those games that you go
in thinking, this is going to be a real war and we'll be lucky
to get out of it with a draw because they have so much
offensive power. We were incredibly happy to get a win out
of that game."
After a 3-1 non-conference win over Alvernia College on
Oct. 17, the Garnet men traveled to McDaniel in a lesshyped but nonetheless incredibly significant match
against the Green Terror. "[McDaniel] plays very very
well at home," Wagner said. "They were also desperate for
a win. It was going to be a tough game no matter what."
Swarthmore fell behind in the 18th minute on a goal
from the Terror's Donzell Tate. "We were making some

October 25, 2007

mistakes that ultimately caught up with us," Wagner said.
But the team never let down and conceded the game, and
Nesterak tied the game 20 minutes into the second half on
a corner kick from JeffKushner 'O9. After the tie held for
the remainder of regulation, the Garnet defense kept the
Green Terror from getting off a shot in overtime and
Nesterak hit his second goal of the night to end the game,
9:55 into the overtime period. "Mike Bonesteel ['oB] played
a brilliant ball across the top of the 18 to [Nesterak] and
[Nesterak] just hit it first time," Wagner said of the goal. "I
was just really pleased to get out of there with the result,
and now we're in playoff contention."
Last night, the Garnet faced off against Muhlenberg
College on senior night in a game that held major playoff
implications for Swarthmore, as the team occupied the
fifth and final playoff spot going into the match.
Swarthmore battled the Mules once again to a standstill
after regulation, but it was Muhlenberg that found the
back of the net for a golden-goal win three and a half minutes into the second overtime period. With the loss, the
Garnet falls to 4-3-1 in the conference.
The men will play one more conference game against
Haverford College this Saturday on the road before the
scheduled start of the playoffs next week. While the team is
focusing on one game at a time, Sutcliffe admitted that the
thought of having a chance to get revenge against Johns
Hopkins University or Gettysburg in the playoffs hasn't
escaped his mind. "The playoffs are all about confidence," he
said. "If we can build our confidence through the next two
games we have a great shot at the championship."

Karen Berk tries to get a kill over a Ursinus block in Thursday's game in Tarble Pavilion.

Swat feasts on Bears despite injuries as season winds down
The women's volleyball team got a big conference
win over fall break to keep its playoff hopes slim but
alive, despite dealing with the loss of two key players.
With Johanna Bond 10 nursing a wrist injury and
Katie Gold 'OB suffering from the flu, Swarthmore
earned a win over Ursinus College on Thursday, but
then fell in two non-conference games on Saturday.
Against the Bears, the Garnet came out strong
from the get-go, securing the first game 30-13 and
going on to get the sweep with 30-22 and 30-19 wins in
the second and third games. With two of
Swarthmore's big scorers on the bench, seniors
Karen Berk and Vanessa Wells stepped up for the
Garnet, with Berk recording 16 blocks and Wells 13.
The Bears struggled with 25 errors in the match, as
their conference record fell to 1-7 and Swarthmore
improved to an even 4-4. The loss of Bond and Gold

also made it possible for coach Harleigh Leach to give

some players more experience and let others play less
familiar positions. "We have some time to be creative," she said.
On Saturday, the Garnet faced both Widener
University and Fairleigh Dickinson College in matches at Widener, but was unable to keep up the momentum from its win earlier in the week. Swarthmore fell
to the Pioneers, 27-30,14-30,30-14,17-30 and thento the
Devils, 19-30,25-30, 23-30. Still, Leach was happy with
the team's level of play. "I thought we played the best
we could," she said.
Before last night's late game against Haverford
College, Swarthmore was sitting in seventh place in
the conference and still holding out hope to get a playoff spot.

Or, I'll be watching a game
on TV and hear an announcer
talk about "statistics" and
"computers" and "people who
didn't play the game" in clearly
disdainful tones. Joe Morgan,
who specializes in that sort of
thing, once said "...anytime

you're trying to make statistics
tell you who's gonna win the game, that's a bunch of geeks trying to play video games."
Over the past 20 years, the battle between "statheads" and traditionalists
what author Michael Lewis has called "baseball's
religious war"
has resulted in increasingly widespread use of
sabermetric techniques in major league front offices. Almost
everybody accepts that baseball knowledge has changed and will
continue to change. But what most people don't realize is that
statheads have changed as well, and the old "geek" characterization is obsolete. I know, I know, everyone feels like their complex, sophisticated interests are oversimplified by the ignorant
masses. But I still think this is important, so hear me out.
One of the most divisive claims of "statheads" is that clutch hitters don't exist. This outraged traditionalists, who shot back that
OF COURSE some players rise to the occasion in pressure situations, while others fold. But after countless studies, no evidence of
a consistent ability to perform "in the clutch" has been found.
Quick digression to make you believe this might be true:
Before this season, Boston's David Ortiz and New York's Alex
Rodriguez were at opposite ends up the "clutch hitter" spectrum
Ortiz was, according to his owner "the greatest clutch hitter
in Boston Red Sox history," while Rodriguez regularly heard
boos for his late-inning failures. In 2007, Ortiz hit .263 with one
home run in the late innings ofclose games, while Rodriguez hit
.357 with six homers.
At some point "there are no clutch hitters" turned into "there

are no clutch hits"
the distribution of a player's hits was seen
as completely random, something he had absolutely no control
over. Instead of being shrouded in mystery and looked upon with
wonder, clutch hitting was simply seen as random. It was an
extreme claim
all the adults I talked to thought it was hogwash and I loved it. Unfortunately, it was wrong.
Today, the average stathead still believes that clutch hitting is
a non-repeatable skill
one that is not consistent over time.
This is, in part, a negative claim. It says that especially good
stats in the clutch will not carry over from year to year the same
way that, say, the ability to hit home runs does. Ortiz, for all his
other merits, should not be given an especially big contract
based on his perceived "clutch" abilities.
Unlike the old "there are no clutch hits" stance, though, the
modern theory says that we absolutely should praise and celebrate a hitter for his past clutch performance. This is in sharp
contrast to what is thought about, say, a batter who gets hit by a
lot of pitches. Nearly everybody accepts that, with a few exceptions, hit batsmen occur randomly, and hitters are not given
credit for "causing" HBP's. It's not the same with clutch hits,
which are credited to the batter as a meaningful achievement
the winning of a mysterious mental game.
Last year, Jimmy "The Robot" Gill 'lO led the Garnet batsmen
with 22 runs batted in. Some of this was due to batting order
position, but Gill also consistently came through with men on
base. Statheads would argue that we can't count on similarly
timely hitting this year, but we all can agree that Gill got the job
done and accept that we don't fully understand what causes
clutch performances. It was a noble goal to attempt to know
everything, but statheads are finally getting reacquainted with
the unexplainable and realizing, as other fans have always
known, that it makes the game more fun. It's time to call an end
to the "religious war."

With tie vs. Fords, Garnet in playoffs
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

As Yogi Berra once said, "It's deja vu all over again."
So goes the story for the women's soccer team (11-2-1, 6-21 CC) who clinched its second ever Centennial Conference
playoff spot in as many years Tuesday night with a 1-1 tie
against local rival Haverford College (8-6-2, 5-2-2 CC).

Swarthmore drew first blood against its fellow Quaker

school when Kirsten Peterson 'll and Hannah Purkey 'll
combined to score 13:45 into the match. The goal was
Purkey's second of the year, and would keep her team in the
lead for the remainder of the first half.
Eight and a half minutes into the second half, however,

"Once you get in the playoffs, it
doesn't really matter what happened
during the season."
Coach Todd Anckaitis
the Fords struck back. Haverford forward Ryan Hedrick
notched her third goal of the year, taking advantage of a
penalty kick awarded the Fords on a questionable foul,
where the Haverford player was struck in the box after she
had already kicked the ball, according to head coach Todd
Anckaitis. The score remained knotted up at 1-1 for the
remainder of regulation time and through two overtime

periods.
Swarthmore controlled the game early on, out-shooting

Haverford in the first half 8-3. The Fords regained some of
that momentum in the second half, however, getting off
seven shots to the Garnet's four. Overtime was another
story. Swarthmore got off six shots over the two additional
periods, four coming from Megan Colombo 'll, while
Haverford did not manage any. Nevertheless, none of this
made any difference. When the final horn sounded, the score
was still 1-1, giving Swarthmore one point in the conference
standings.

"It was a little frustrating," Anckaitis said. "But it gave
us the result we needed." Players echoed this sentiment.

Hannah Purkey wrestles with a Ursinus player for ball control in Swarthmore's 4-0 win last Wednesday.
"It was a tough situation," midfielderLizbeeth Lopez 10
said. "There was a lot of wind, and we're not used to playing
on grass. We played hard, but we were unfortunate on the
[penalty kick]."
"We ran out of time," midfielder Monica Cody 10 said.

She believes the team needs to "focus on getting goals first.
We need to make thatthe primary focus when we step on the
field."
Anckaitis was of a similar mind. "We could have done a
lot of things differently," he said. "The first 20 minutes of the
second half we didn't look like our team."
Swarthmore, currently in third place in the conference
standings with one game left to play, came into the match
against Haverford having played two conference matches
earlier in the week, beating Ursinus College, who at the time
held first place in the conference, 4-0 at home on Oct. 17, and
then losing to Gettysburg College 1-0 on the road last
Saturday. In the win over the Bears, Colomborecorded a hat
trick to bring her season total to seven goals, and Sarah
Reece 11 added a goal and assist of her own.

"We need to make [getting
goals] the primary focus when

Despite a 16-6 shot ratio in favor of the Garnet in its game
against the Bullets, Gettysburg came away with the win

after a goal in the 75th minute by Erin Miller. Gettysburg's
Danielle St. Pierre had 9 saves in the game to keep
Swarthmore off the board. With the loss, Swarthmore
