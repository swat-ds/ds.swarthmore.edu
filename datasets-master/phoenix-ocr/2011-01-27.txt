Grams and GN join forces

nsabharl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's Global Neighbors will
partner with the NinjaGram service this
semester to raise funds for its Mosaic
Project, a collaborative undertaking by
GN members and Children and Adult
Disability Education Services (CADES)
students in building a mosaic mural in
the CADES school.
"Our group is functioning to bridge
the gaps between CADES and
Swarthmore. That's how we see our role
into it," Michio Taya 'l3, a member of
Global Neighbors, said. "Art is a great
medium for that to happen."
NinjaGrams, started in 2006, will
donate all of the proceeds from this
year's service to helping Global
Neighbors successfully carry out their
Mosaic Project. In return, GN will help
out with the preparation and delivery of
NinjaGrams for this Valentine's Day.
"I got a few really cool proposals and
Global Neighbors was one of the proposals," said Phil Chodrow 'l2, the current
head of the project. "I like that it's local
and that they have a great cause. So we
decided to work with them [and] donate
all our funds to the Mosaic Project and
they're going to help supply us with
manpower."

Members of GN can help out with the
process by making and selling cards in
preparation for delivery on Valentine's
Day a day in which dozens of student
volunteers stalk and sneak around campus dressed as ninjas to deliver all the
cards.
"NinjaGram is a ninja-powered
Valentine's Day card delivery service,"
Chodrow said. The service lay dormant
without a coordinator until Chodrow
"picked it up on a whim in 2010."
Last year, the service raised over
$l,OOO for Haiti relief. For GN, this will
be the first fundraiser for their Mosaic
--

Project.

"The [Mosaic] project idea was discussed as part of an effort to have one
large scale project per year at CADES,"
Taya said. Seeking to pursue their goal
of reducing the stigma of disability and
increasing the points of contact between
Swarthmore and CADES students,
Global Neighbors will collaborate with
CADES to create a mosaic mural.
Members of Global Neighbors volunteer at the CADES school each week,
assisting disabled children in art, P.E.,
music and pre-school classes, among
others. "Outside of the CADES campus,
the students have very few friends.
We're a fresh batch offaces [whom] the
students know to make friendships
with," Taya said.
Global Neighbors is a student group
devoted to raising awareness for people
who are socially marginalized as a
result of medical conditions.
Through the creation of beneficial
and sustainable relationships with
affected communities, the group seeks
to end the discrimination as well as to
promote the dignity of those disenfranchised by medical and physical conditions.
Inspired by a trip to China working
with victims of leprosy, Bettina Tarn 'lO
founded the group two years ago. "It
started off with Joy in Action (JIA) and
working mainly with the Chinese organ-

ization that deals with helping survivors of Hansen's disease, which is leprosy," said Linda Hou 'l3, a current
member of the organization.
The group is funded by Project
Pericles,
which is
the largest
Swarthmore grant intended to support
students who seek to implement visionary social and civic action projects.
According to the Pericles grant proposal, the JIA project strives to raise
awareness for Hansen's disease through
a campus-wide event each fall.
With the support of grants and
fundraising, JIA continues to support
two volunteers from Swarthmore to participate in projects in post-Hansen's disease villages in rural China.
"After [JIA], they expanded the group

goal to working with other groups. We
started working with CADES which is a
local organization which educates chil-

dren with disabilities," Hou said.
Volunteers at CADES enjoy the time
they spend and relationships they build
with students at CADES.
"I love how we're able to see the same
students each week
and get to know
them well. Volunteering at CADES is an
amazing experience," Yuan Qu 'l4, a
member of Global Neighbors, said.
Logan Grider, assistant professor of
studio art, will assist in the project, as
will Paul Zecher, an art teacher at
CADES. Although the timeline is not
yet clear, Taya estimates that the project
should be completed, at latest, by the
spring of 2012.

With a great passion for 19th century French literature, George Moskos came to Swarthmore in 1975 as an assistant professor in
the French department.

BY

MENGHAN

JIN

mjinl@swarthmore.edu

Two years ago, George Moskos, professor of French language and literature,
lent Christine Stott 'O9 his copy of
"Racine et Shakespeare" by Stendhal. It
seemed impossible to read
it was
infused cover to cover with George's
thoughts scrawled on hundreds of yellow
Post-its.
Now, it has become a book that Stott
will forever cherish.
"I remember where I left it in my
house, and I'm thinking, 'this is a treasure.' It is a window into his mind," Stott
said.
On January 4, George Moskos died
from a very severe case of lung cancer at
the age of 62. He is survived by his partner of 40 years, Blair Gannon.
"I couldn't possibly exaggerate the
impact George had on my time at
Swarthmore," Stott said. "I considered
him an incredible teacher, but also a mentor and a friend."
He will be remembered by all members
of the Swarthmore community for his
openness and charisma in and outside of
the classroom.
George's sharp mind and passion for
the French language and literature
brought him to Swarthmore in 1975. Since
then, he not only served as the chair of
the Modern Languages and Literatures
Department for five years, but also as the
head of the French section.
Since his professorship, George was
greatly involved in queer and feminist
issues on campus, and in 1998, he was
endowed with the title of James C.
Hormel Professor of Social Justice.
An enthusiast of French language and
literature, George made the Swarthmorehosted study abroad program in
Grenoble, France a major part of his life

THE PHOENIX

at Swarthmore. He spent several semes-

ters on and off in Grenoble with Blair,
advising and guiding students along in

the program.
"Over the years, he was one of the
most committed people in keeping the
program going," said Professor of Theater
Allen Kuharski. "George really thought it
was essential and something he loved,
and he was one of the people most willing,
able and committed to going and being
the faculty person in residence in
Grenoble."
Many students found George's passion
and teaching style moving. "When he
taught a class," Stott said, "he wasn't just
trying to transmit knowledge to his students, but also his love, his passion for
the material. And it was absolutely contagious."

had another teacher who made literature
come alive for me in quite the same way."
For George, teaching was always an
incredible joy.
"He was always very happy," Blair
said. "I think he felt professionally fulfilled, because thereaction ofhis students
to his teaching was always very positive."
With George's passing, Swarthmore
has lost not only a most influential professor, but also a beloved colleague and
devoted friend.
Carole Netter, French lecturer, started
working with George 25 years ago in the
French department at Swarthmore after
meeting him in Grenoble. Throughout
her years here, she was able to develop a
close professional as well as personal
relationship with George.
"He was an extremely helpful boss
and was a joy to work with. We had meetings, of course, and we'd laugh out loud
all the time," she said.
Netter visited George's house in the
borough several times in years past. She
especially remembers his love for Greek
salads and impeccable warmth as a host.
To Kuharski, longtime friend of
George, this rings true.
"He was very warm and he was very
hospitable.
He really created a great
environment for welcoming visitors [and]
people look forward to coming again,"
Kuharski said.
When he first started teaching at
Swarthmore in 1975, George attacked
queer issues on campus unflinchingly. He
joined the community during a time
when homosexuality was not well
received at the college.
"When I came, it was still difficult. You
would see on the sidewalks very bad comments about queer people," Netter said.
But George worked hard to be accepted
as an openly gay professional in academia
and went on to become one of the first
...

Stott's first class with George was
"Introduction to French Literature," a
class that inspired her want to pursue
French literature after Swarthmore.
"I think he genuinely loved the literature," Kuharski said, "and he was happy
reading and rereading that literature.
And I think that's something the students
really pick up on."
Stott is now teaching high school
English in Bordeaux, France.
George was also a major influence on
Carson Young 'lO, who, like Stott, chose to
teach in Bordeaux after graduating from
Swarthmore.
A philosophy and economics major,
Young was able to work closely with
George during the fall of 2008 when he
attended the Grenoble program. When
Young was struggling in his French poetry class, George held weekly one-on-one
poetry reading sessions with Young.
"He would jump around and gesticulate wildly as we read Baudelaire together, trying to get me to feel the words that
we were reading," Young said. "I've never

occasions, which were full of campy
a style not too common at
humor
Swarthmore at the time," she said.
George's sense of humor and vivacity
translated to all areas of his life. In his
French introductory class last semester,
his personality made students wonder
about his age; many thought he was half
his actual age.
"Almost everyone I talked to in my
class, when we saw that he was 62, we
were shocked. He just had such a young,
lively personality," Gabbie Capone 'l4
said.
Capone took George's class as one of
her first courses at Swarthmore, finding
him to be one of the most engaging and
enjoyable professors she has encountered
so far.
"George's class was the class I looked
forward to every morning," she said. "He
was a fantastic teacher very funny and
personable."
It was George, Capone said, that made
her want to continue .studying French at

Swarthmore and take more of his classes.
Unfortunately, George was forced to stop
teaching after Thanksgiving of last year.
And though his physical well-being
started deteriorating by the middle of the
semester, his energy and charisma never
faltered.
"It was remarkable that between being
on a lot of medication and not always
being conscious, when he was conscious
and when he was not feeling his symptoms, his personality was completely
there," Kuharski said. "He even wanted
to speak French."
Both Kuharski and Netter can attest to
George's enduring optimism and warmth,
even in his last couple weeks of life when
the cancer was just getting worse.
"He was extremely elegant, welcoming
anybody when he was suffering a lot,"
Netter said. "It's difficult seeing a very
close friend approaching death, but as
soon as you were there, it was not difficult because he was the same person, just
a bit handicapped."
When Kuharski saw George 48 hours
before he passed away, George wanted to
hold a conversation with him in French.
Netter saw George on his last day; he was
only able to smile at her.
Since George's passing, those closest to
him have come from France, Holland and
Canada to give their condolences to Blair.
Members of the Swarthmore community
have also reached out to Blair.
"I miss him very much," Blair said. "I
don't think I've fully incorporated his

passing yet."

A memorial service for George has yet
to be scheduled.

"What," I wonder critically, "if Swatties
were more like sea urchins?"
In reality, there are many valuable
lessons to learn from sea urchins. For
example, sea urchins are good at disguising themselves. When a sea urchin
encounters trouble or a threat, it immediately picks up several bits of rock and
attempts to disguise itself as a tide pool.
For me, I think I just might adopt this
strategy. So, the next time I encounter a
hungry seal, have an overwhelming
workload, find myself stuck in some
dreadfully uncomfortable social situation, or lose my shoes, I shall pretend to

Style Snapshot

Name: John Buterbaugh
Year: 2014
From: Austin, TX
Current Residence: Dana
What He's Wearing:
Buterbaugh is wearing white Adidas high tops from a
thrift store, coupled with a pair of dark wash skinny jeans
he ordered online, probably from Macy's. Keeping it classic
with a "good ol" argyle sweater, he often chooses to layer
this number over a collared button-down. Buterbaugh
found his vintage leather jacket at a store in Austin called
New Brohemia, which is a pun on the name of a women's
clothing store known as New Bohemia.
How He Describes His Personal Style:
"When I started developing my idea of a personal style
it was pretty much influenced by the fact that I was into
minimalism at that time," Buterbaugh said. At first, he preferred neutral tones, specifically black and grey, but later
branched out into different styles and combinations.
Buterbaugh feels that he's "somewhere between quoteunquote hipster with influences both on the preppy side
and punky side of things." For him, particular pieces, such
as an argyle sweater or a pair of shoes create the distinctions between preppy and punky. However, Buterbaugh
said that overall he tends to pick "bits and pieces up from
things [he] finds interesting," rather than adhering to hardand-fast style rules.

Where He Shops:

For most of his wardrobe, Buterbaugh shops in small
stores in Austin where he found both his high tops and
bomber jacket, though he often scours the Internet for long
inseam jeans. One site he frequents is JackThreads.com,
which Buterbaugh says sells "fairly nice, sort of like, street
clothes."
On a college budget, Buterbaugh said that he wishes he
could afford to shop at stores such as J. Crew, but instead
justenjoys window shopping. "I could eitherread a book or
go to J. Crew, and they would have the same function," he
said. "[They are both] aesthetically pleasing."

award-winning photographic collections
focused on the use and absence of light
and on still lifes of the artist, who already
has two permanent exhibitions in both
the Chicago Art Institute and the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
A professor of photography at Saint
Joseph's University, Fenton began her
work in photography later than most
artists, since her original interest lied in
painting. "I went [into school] as a
painter," she said. "I then took a [photography class] and fell in love. The second
year of grad school I was doing more pho-

tography than painting."
A graduate of Temple University,
Fenton later taught in Saint Mary's
University in Rome and Temple
University in Japan prior to working in
Pennsylvania where she primarily focuses on black and white photography in her

darkroom work. Her collections range
from photographs of figures to evocative
still life arrangements.
Her focus on photography, whether of
objects or human-like figures, originates
from a desirefor immediacy. During graduate school, Fenton's introduction to the
newly popular color Xerox machine
inspired her interest in photography.

Forget 'Smarriage': the possibilities of TriCo dating
swarthmorephoenix.com

I spend a lot of time
on the Internet. Over the
past year, the benefits of
my net addiction have,
for you, been largely
technological
my articles have centered upon
net security, computer
upgrades and online discounts. Today, however,
I shall blaze a trail into
new and potentially danSteve Dean
gerous territory: dating.
Life Tips from a Dean
In this article, I assess
the pitfalls of the current dating scene at
Swarthmore and the
potential benefits of Tri-College dating. In my next
installment I will report on my travels and travails
throughout the relatively unexplored (and definitively under-explored) realm of online dating!
I would be willing to bet that for most Swatties,
the concept of dating outside of the bubble may
seem abhorrent. Dating at Swarthmore is ultra-convenient and virtually free, after all, and you have a
high probability of intellectual and social compatibility, given Swarthmore's political compatibility.
Also, you can assume a certain degree of safety
because you're on a secure campus surrounded by
your friends. Why, then, would you want to date
outside the bubble? Well, for starters, let's look at
the term "date" itself. If you want to take someone
from Swarthmore on a "date," chances are you will
find yourself sitting across from him/her at
Sharpies (if you're feeling particularly suave, you
might snag one of the highly-contested window
booths). You probably encountered that person
somewhere on campus during the week, made eye
contact, acknowledged each other's existence and
self-worth, and then proceeded to hook up at Paces
or one of the frats. Your first "date" was probably
your shared Sharpies meal, and "dates" thereafter
likely revolved around finding places on campus to
study together. If the two of you find this setup particularly satisfying, you may eventually make your
situation Facebook official.
The drawbacks of Swarthmore's "dating" situation are numerous. For one, the smallness of the
campus makes dating multiple people (whether linearly or simultaneously) quite awkward at times
after all, your friend groups will almost definitely
overlap, and Swarthmore culture übiquitously
frowns upon dating within shared friend groups.
Even before you start dating, you have to fear the
übiquitous and inescapable gossip (termed, endearingly, "Swassip") that accompanies your every
hookup. Within minutes of your first public sighting with another individual, the questions come
rolling in: "Ooh, are you two a couple now?" Then
there's the implicit awkwardness of the one-dininghall campus, namely, that you are virtually guaranteed to see your hookup in Sharpies the next day.
So, do you sit with him/her? Do you nod knowingly? Do you ignore the person completely? This may
be why we Swatties come off as so very awkward.
We over-analyze these things to the point of social
dysfunction.
Let's turn now to the largely untapped possibilities of TriCo dating. First and foremost, if
you're a Swattie and you are not going abroad, you
will likely yourself feeling quite claustrophobic
sometime during your sophomore or junior year as
a result of having spent entirely too much uninterrupted time inside the bubble. Having your daily
actions intensely scrutinized by all manner of

StaffEditorial

Bipartisan rhetoric overlooks realities of Congress
In a show of unity and respect after the Tucson
shooting, members of Congress sat together regardless of party at Tuesday's State of the Union address.
This show of bipartisanship, an idea proposed by
Senator Mark Udall (D-Colorado), was a result of a
national tragedy and not of some new united
Congress.
Though the seating arrangement was an appropriate and necessary response, it should not be confused with the actions of Congress in its 112th session.
More importantly, Congress is in no place to meet
the President's idealistic suggestions outlined in the
speech.
Since the Civil War, and especially in the last
decade, our Congress has become more and more
ideologically polarized.
This can be seen in empirical measurements of
role call votes, in the intensity of political debate,
and in the levels of bipartisan voting on ideologically charged issues.
The emergence of the Tea Party has furthered
polarizing tendencies within both parties, with
Republican leadership distancing itself from the Tea
Party while retaining their conservatism and with
Democrats clinging to their liberalism in the face of
such a radically conservative assault.
Furthermore, progress in Congress of any sort
would be very difficult because the two chambers
are held by different parties, thus necessitating
bipartisanship from ideologically opposite groups.
None of this should be news to President Obama,
and yet his State of the Union speech was full of optimistic plans contingent on bipartisan progress in
Congress.

While he pitched plans that required concessions
from both parties, Obama also presented ideas
which clearly were catering to one party and as such
were unfeasible.
These party-targeted plans and projects also
undermined his focus on unity and bipartisanship
by very overtly currying favor with each party.
Though Obama's optimism is one of his hallmark
traits, he went too far with it in the State of the

Union, proposing plans that cannot be realized.
For example, asking Congress to help ensure 80
percent of U.S. energy comes from clean sources by
2035 is a hefty goal.
Major legislation would have to be passed for
such a lofty standard to be reached, yet a comprehensive energy bill would require support from both
parties to pass in both the House and the Senate.
The President's calls on Congress to pass legislation specifically targeted at one party will also face
serious challenges getting through both chambers.
Obama proposed reforming both the corporate
tax system, including lowering the corporate tax
rate, and business regulations.
This plan clearly caters to the Republicans who
won their seats with campaigns against high taxation and excessive regulation.

Though Obama's optimisim is one
of his hallmark traits, he went too
far with it in the State of the Union,
proposing plans that cannot be
realized.
Lowering the corporate tax rate and eliminating
regulations in this environment don't send the right
to voters, to companies or to the memmessage
bers of Congress.
Beyond specific changes to existing legislation,
Obama said that he and his administration "will
develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best
serves the goal of a more competitive America."
Though this plan to make the federal government
more efficient and effective is the right message for
him to send at the start of the 2012 campaign season,
the rhetoric cannot and will not be followed up with
action.
Obama alientates his own party by making so

many concessions to the Republicans, and he is giving companies incentive to return to their reckless
behaviors that led in part to the current recession.
But this was not Obama's most quixotic moment.
Rather, his suggested freeze on annual domestic
spending until 2015 cannot happen without serious
changes in the partisan dynamics of Congress.
This proposal is both too grand and too limited in
scope. A freeze on domestic spending lessens the federal deficit by only $4OO billion over the course of a
decade.
This may not be enough to assuage Republicans'
calls for spending cuts, which are based in the ideological basis for their polarization.
Furthermore, there are other areas which need to
see serious cuts more than domestic spending.
Congressional Democrats will be hesitant to cut
the domestic budget, which is only 12 percent of government spending, when they could cut defense
spending, which accounts for 26 percent of government spending.
Obama's spending freeze requires ideological
compromises from both parties without making
serious progress on the deficit, and it doesn't outline
specific

cuts.

This will inevitably result in no progress. When
the time comes for Congress to pick programs to cut,
the parties will not be able to agree on which programs are nonessential.
Obama's talk of bipartisanship and cooperation
seemed to completely disregard what has happened
thus far in the 112th Congress and set him up for failure.
The responses from the members of Congress
present Tuesday night mirror their polarization.
Only a few of the President's remarks solicited
applause from the whole audience.
The President should have catered to the interests of his party more by suggesting legislation
friendly to the Democrats.
Though Congress currently seems to be in the
mood for unity and bipartisanship, their extremely
polarized ideologies will prevent the progress that
Obama proposes from occurring.

Greater civility needed after the Tucson shooting

Tyler Becker

come into class with an automatic weapon."
Despite Loughner's mental state, the national news
media allowed analysis to air that the shooting was a
result of the uncivil political climate in America created
by Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and other conservatives.
SheriffClarence Dupnik, who is in charge of the investigation, told ABC's Diane Sawyer that Rush Limbaugh's
rhetoric "is not without consequences." He made this
statement with no evidence that Loughner ever listened
to Limbaugh, or even knew who he is.
Should we really be surprised that conservatives were
blamed in part for the shooting? After all, the Democrats
have lost power even since the 112th Congress started last
month. Blaming conservatives for the shooting is in the
Left's best political interest.
Even more telling is that
many of these calls for "civility" have come from politicians and media personalities
whose past statements can
certainly not be called "civil."
The hypocrisy is unbelievable.
Keith Olbermann, a liberon
al, now-former MSNBC host,
;^^^^^^^^^^^^
attacked conservatives following the shooting.
However, when now U.S. Senator Scott Brown, R-MA,
was running for the open Senate seat there, Olbermann
called Brown "... an irresponsible, homophobic, racist,
reactionary, ex-nude model, teabagging supporter of violence against women and against politicians with whom
he disagrees." I would not characterize those untrue comments as civil.
Then, there is President Obama and his call for civility. While Obama did give a speech more focused on bringing the nation together than Sarah Palin's "blood libel"
comment, he is guilty of making statements in the past
that could be stretched to say he was inciting violence,
much like some on the left have done with statements by
conservatives. Obama said in 2008 that if the Republicans
"bring a knife to the fight, we will bring a gun."

What should we learn
from the Tucson shooting?
Conservatives have repeatedly been blamed for the terrible shooting in Tucson that
targeted Arizona eighth discongresswoman
trict
GabrieUe Giffords, D-AZ, and
killed 6 people, including a
federal judge.
While there is nothing

Even after the shooting, the Democrat's calls for civility have been ignored by members of their own caucus.
Rep. Steven Cohen, D-TN, compared Republicans in the
House with "Nazis" as they voted for the bill to repeal
healthcare reforms.

The blame-game, used to paint conservatives as in
part responsible for this shooting, has put the real issues
at hand in America on the back burner. Our economy is
still in a recession, our soldiers are fighting a difficult
war in Afghanistan and our fiscal house is not in order.

Trying to score cheap political points out of a national
tragedy is ludicrous.

"norm."

tragedy in Arizona, I ask you
not to succumb to the belief
that conservatives caused this
awful shooting. It was one deranged individual who acted
alone. Criticizing conservatives or any group for an
action taken by one person does not contribute to civility
And, don't lose your passion. Whether you identify as
liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, it is
okay to be a little uncivil sometimes if you want to get
your point across.
One of my biggest fears following this shooting and
the improper blaming of conservatives that followed is
that political correctness will dominate America more
than it already does. That would be the wrong lesson to
learn from this tragedy.
Tyler is a first-year. He can be reached at

tive political commentators.
For one thing, Loughner is not a conservative.
According to CBS News, Loughner is a "conspiracy theorist" and thought that the government was responsible
for the September 11th terrorist attacks. The books listed
on his YouTube page include "Mein Kampf' and the
"Communist Manifesto."
CBS also reported that Loughner "began to characterize people as sheep whose free will was being sapped by
the government and the monotony of modern life." He
has a disdain for government and did not pay attention to
the news, watch television, or listen to talk radio.
If his views can be characterized as anything, they
align with the radical left, not conservatives. He did not
want to have less government like those on the right; he
wanted to annihilate the current system.
Loughner was clearly mentally unstable as shown by
his past actions. He was forced out of community college
for a video in which he said that the college was against
the Constitution. The college saw him as a "threat."
A woman who shared a class with Loughner had emailed her friends in the past about Loughner. In one email, she wrote, "We have a mentally unstable person in
the class that scares the living crap out of me. He is one

Some might take issue with what is
still a rosy sketch ofU.S. history. Notably
absent is the accurate Marxist contention
that extreme poverty and gross economic
inequality have consistently characterized this country since before the revolution.
However, it would be a huge mistake
to dismiss the successes and the legacy of
American liberation movements. Most
Americans will interpret Obama's call for
renewed American exceptionalism as
good capitalists should, as a call to boost
GDP growth and be more potent than the
other guy.
The rest of us should bear in mind the
responsibility we've inherited from the
legacy of liberation
the responsibility
to recognize the true American exceptionalism and relentlessly drive it
towards its better half.
Michelle Alexander makes a compelling argument that mass incarceration
has evolved into a new system of institutionalized oppression comparable to Jim
Crow.
It is a system that glaringly contradicts the shared values we claim to possess and, like segregation during World
War 11, makes U.S. leadership on human
rights issues decidedly less credible.
It is also an issue that lends itself to
mobilization, advocacy and direct action.
If and how we address this issue will do
much to determine which side of
American exceptionalism defines this
country in the 21st century.

Three athletes named academic all-stars for 2010
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS

aapostol@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore may be more wellknown for its reputation of academic
intensity than its athletic prowess, but
the culture of excellence does not stop
when classes end. The Garnet sports
teams also lay claim to some of the
finest Division 111 athletes in the area.
Three Swarthmore student-athletes
have been recognized for their outstanding performance in the classroom
as well as in competition, as David
D'Annunzio 'l2 (men's soccer), Micah
Rose 'l2 (men's soccer), and Allison
Coleman 'l3 (volleyball) were recently
selected as Academic All-Stars by the
Philadelphia Inquirer. To qualify for
selection, a student-athlete must maintain at least a 3.0 GPA while serving as
a starter or a key reserve.
The Philadelphia Inquirer also
named D'Annunzio the Men's Soccer
Academic All-Area Performer of the
Year. An engineering major from
Piedmont, CA, D'Annunzio established
himself over the past three seasons as
one of the finest goalies in Swarthmore
history, as well as in the Centennial
Conference. In his junior season, he led
the Conference with an 0.51 goalsagainst average and recorded eight
shutouts on the year, which brought
his career total to 21, second on
Swarthmore's all-time list. His impressive work in the net led the Garnet men
to a 16-1-4 record (7-0-2 in Conference)
and an appearance in the NCAA tournament. For the first time in the
school's history, the Garnet men held
the national #1 ranking for a week midseason.
"I felt that this season was amazing," said D'Annunzio, who views his
academic and extracurricular success
as a testament to the balanced
Swarthmore environment. D'Annunzio
started as goalie his freshman year and
found that being a Swarthmore athlete
still allows him to be a student, as well
as to participate and excel in other
extracurriculars, both on and off the
field.

Allie Coleman, the Garnet volleyball
team's setter, has grown to become a key
player and team leader this past season.

"At many other schools, being an
athlete is like having a full-time job,
and that doesn't appeal to me,"
D'Annunzio said. "To have the success
that we've had and to have all of the
other great parts of college at the same
time is a wonderful and unique experience."
Men's soccer coach Eric Wagner
describes his goalie as "very consistent, dependable, and dominant."
"David quietly put together the best
season by any goalie in the Centennial
Conference," Wagner said, adding that
D'Annunzio made "invaluable contributions" to the team this year.
The Academic All-Star honor is
D'Annunzio's second, as he was also
selected by the Inquirer in his sophomore year.

VT, is the second men's soccer honoree. The midfielder is a sociologyanthropology major and served as a
team captain this season. In recogni-

tion of his stellar performance, Rose
was
named to
the Centennial
Conference First Team and was selected as an NCAA All-American. He was
also
named to the Centennial
Conference Academic Honor Roll, making him one of only three men's soccer
players to earn both Honor Roll and
First-Team accolades. In addition to
being one of the Garnet's top scorers,
he led an airtight defense which surrendered only 0.57 goals per game.
"He was a beast in the middle of the
field for us," raved Wagner. "Being an
All-American makes him one of the top
33 in the country, [and] that is an
incredible accomplishment. [He was] a
fabulous team leader for us this year."
Rose echoed D'Annunzio's thoughts
in discussing the 2010 soccer season
and his athletic experience at
Swarthmore. "This past season ended a
bit earlier than we would have liked,
but overall it was a success," he said.
"Soccer has been great, but the best
part of my Swarthmore [student-athlete] experience has been the people
I've had the privilege of meeting. I've
made lifelong friends here who have
stretched me to grow as a person, as a

thinker, and as an athlete."
On the women's side, Coleman, a
pre-med student from Palo Alto, CA,
was the Garnet's lone representative
on the Academic All-Star team. The
sophomore setter enjoyed a breakout
year in 2010, leading the team to the
Centennial Conference Championship
match. She was named to the
Conference Academic Honor Roll.
"I think I have improved as a player
since the beginning of my freshman
year," said Coleman. "This year, as a
sophomore, I was able to take on more
of a leadership role, which my position
calls for. A setter needs to be able to
understand and control the pace of the
game as well as motivate and connect
with both the defense and the offense of
the team."
An enthusiastic team motivator as
well as a key player, she credited the
team dynamic for fostering passion in
addition to a high level of play. "We
really show a lot of determination and
emotion when we play, which is part of
what makes [it] so fun," she said.

Chwastyck had nothing but praise for
her athletic and academic all-star.
"Allie is a very competitive and pas-,

life," Chwastyck said. "She is driven to
succeed and as the on-court leader
leads by example in her work ethic and
hustle."
With 2010 behind them, Chwastyck
and Coleman are focused on the future
and see no reason for doubts.
"I expect to see [Allie] continue to
improve and build upon her volleyball
and leadership skills in order to benefit
our team's success," said Chwastyck. "I
am excited to see what Allie and our
team can accomplish in the next two
years of her volleyball career here at
Swarthmore."
Coleman expects her team to build
off last year's finish towards greater
things in the future. "I want us to win
our conference next year," she said.
"We've seen that a conference championship is a possibility for this team,
but I want it to be a reality next year."

BY RENEE FLORES
rfloresl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore men's and women's swim teams dom-

inated in the home meet against Cabrini Sunday, winning

Benveniste, Daniel Duncan and Samuel BuUard-Sisken 'l2
recorded two wins each.
In his first win, the 1000 freestyle, Benveniste finished

(10:52.62), Joshua Satre 13 (10:54.36) and Peter Ballen 14

IM (4:25.94).
For the women, who improved to 4-2 on the season, the
team took 13 of the 14 events overall, and took the top times
in all of the individual events.
"It gave us an opportunity to put people in a variety of
events. The women swam in different events than we had
them in [this season]," head coach Sue Davis said.
The women took the top three spots in the 200 medley
relay, as the "A" team of Rosalie Lawrence 'l2, Margaret
Regan 14, Hannah Gotwals 13, and Erin Lowe 14 grabbed

Senior David Dulaney rises for a breath while swimming the butterfly. The men's swim team easily defeated Cabrini
College 121-80 on Sunday.
Regan placed first in the 200 backstroke with a time of
2:34.39 and the 400 IM with a time of 5:013 L Bedolfe,
Myrvang and Alice Wong 13 followed after Regan in the
400 IM with times of 5:19.45,5:19.83 and 5:19.84 respectively.

took the 100 breaststroke (1:14.05) followed by Regan
(1:1412) and Stephanie Su 'll (1:14.85). Gotwals won in the
200 butterfly (2:19.36), Brett in the 50 freestyle (26.57) and
Su in the 200 breaststroke (2:38.57).
"In most cases they're swimming a little bit better, in
some cases the same times as before Christmas. That's
good, because they're tired," Davis said.
With yesterday's meet against Washington College
rescheduled due to the winter storm, both teams are staying, strong and working hard. Davis is urging the Garnet
swimmers to "stay focused, stay healthy, and get adequate
rest."
In terms of the Washington meet, Davis said, "The
women's meet is going to be tough, depending on how

Washington swims and how we swim. We can win by two
points, or 14 points, or anything in between. So, they have
to be on top of their game."
Brett agreed that the Washington meet would prove difficult for the women, saying that they would have to
"swim their butts off" and hoping that their heart will help
them win the day.
For the men's team, Ballen feels that the Garnet should
be able to add another win. "We have more depth than
Washington," he said. He feels that that will give the men's
team an upper edge on the Washington meet.
The men's and women's teams are going to have to wait
to prove if they will dominate Washington, as the home
meet was postponed until February 8 at 6 p.m.
"It's time to start working on our technique. It comes
down to the small things; a race can be won in one 100th of
a second. I have faith that we'U puU it off," Brett said.
The Swarthmore men's and women's swim teams
return to action in a dual meet at Gettysburg this
Saturday. Action is set to begin at 6 p.m.

Men's basketball falls to 5-12 after loss to Ursinus
BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

It was a tale of two halves for the
Swarthmore men's basketball team
against Ursinus last Saturday. While
absolutely dominant in one, caution took
over in the other. Ursinus had the last
word, coming away with an 88-76 win.
The loss dropped the Garnet to 5-12, 2-8
CC for the season.
The defense had an incredible first
half, holding the Bears to just 22.7 percent shooting for 20 minutes. Combined
with double digit scoring in that half
alone from Jay Kober 'l4 and Will Gates
'l3, the Garnet came out with a 14 point
lead at the hJdf .
"In the first half our defensive
rebounding was excellent and our overall
intensity was unmatched," Federer 'l4
said. He added, though, that "going into
the second half we sort of came out a little flat, giving Ursinus a chance to creep

16

back into the game."
In fact, theBears roared back into the
game with a stunning 66 points in the second half to completely change the result.
The Garnet's lead was gone in just seven
minutes.
Gates said the officiating had a lot to
do with the change in fortune. "It was a
very tightly called game and I think certain players were afraid of being too
physical and fouling out, so we played
very tentative on defense in the second
half," Gates said.
While the Garnet defense played very
aggressively in the first half, the second
half saw more cautious play. According
to Gates, "[The defense] did a great job of
stopping penetration in the first half."
Offensively, the Garnet had a strong
first half, putting up 36 points, 12 of
which came off the hands ofKober and 11
off the hands of Gates. Though leading by
17 points with just above eight minutes
left in the half, Ursinus reduced the lead

to 14, cutting the Garnet lead to 36-22 at

the half. The Garnet offense continued
its strong play into the second half, with
four players finishing in double digits for
the game. Kober led the way with a
career-high 26, followed by 18 from Gates.
Federer added 16, and Andrew Greenblatt
'l2 came off the bench to give 10 points.
Toward the end of the game, fouls led
to easy Ursinus free throws, and the
Garnet didn't get closer than within five
points. The Bears attempted 52 free
throws, converting 39 of them. The number of attempts was the third-most in
Centennial Conference history.
The game proved physical from start
to finish with a total of 66 fouls and three
technical fouls committed. "Almost all of
our bigs were in foul trouble and I think
that really hurt our inside play," Gates
said. Gates himself finished the game
with four fouls, and both Sam Lacy 'll
and Jordan Cheney 'l4 fouled out.
With Cheney and Lacy held to the

anuary 27, 2011

bench in the last 15 minute of the game,
Ursinus took advantage and netted 15
points in four minutes, taking the lead
with just short of 13 minutes left in the
game. The weakened Garnet offense
could not keep up with the Bears.
While the loss was disappointing,
Gates recognized the Garnet's strong
points. "I think if we play all the time like
we played in the first half against
Ursinus, we're pretty tough to beat," he
said.
Due to the inordinate amount of
snowfall in the area, Wednesday night's
game against McDaniel was postponed
until today at 7:30 p.m. "The conditions
were just too dangerous," Mark Anskis,
the Sports Information Director, said.
The Garnet's next scheduled chance to
shake off its losing streak comes against
Gettysburg, where the team looks to
avenge a 59-43 loss from earlier this season. Tip-off is scheduled for 4:00 p.m. at
Tarble Pavilion.
