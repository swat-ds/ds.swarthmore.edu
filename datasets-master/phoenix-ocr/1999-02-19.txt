Budget trouble plagues Film Society
Halved budget puts

by Mimi Hanaoka

Managing Editor
Plagued by financial problems that stem
from a halving of their budget, the Film
Society is teetering on the verge of ex-

tinction.

The Film Society failed to present their
budget proposal on time to the Budget
Committee in the spring of 1998. As a
policy the Budget Committee halves the
budget of any organization that does not
submit its budget proposal on time, and
as a result the Film Society received half
of its usual budget of $6BOO for the 19981999 academic year.
The $6BOO usually budgeted to the Film
Society covers the cost of films, speakers, and projectionists. The Film Society
appealed to BC to overturn its decision,
but the appeal was rejected.
Following their rejection from BC the
Film Society turn to Student Council to
overturn the Budget Committee decision,
but Student Council rejected the Film
Society's appeal on the basis that the Film
Society should simply alter their schedule and screen movies on a bi-weekly instead of weekly schedule.

world would a child want to take
on any more responsibilities
than he absolutely had to? Children normally want to have fun,
so what is it that is driving them
to accept not only the superficial benefits, but also the work
entailed in growing up as fast as
possible?
Children are willing to accept
the risks of growing up quickly
because they believe that happiness lies in asserting their individuality. Individual responsibility is the aspect of adulthood

Columnist
tor that children are unable
to cope with,
and it has lead
to a recent increase in the child
suicide, murder, and pregnancy
rates.
Children cannot cope with the
responsibilities of being an
adult, but they are unwilling to
give up the individuality that
they feel they require in order
to be a worthwhile individual.
When these two opposing forces
break down, children engage in
destructive activities.
After my experience with the
youth group children, I began to
look for signs ofthe destructive
nature of over-emphasized individuality in adults. One night I
was chatting with some friends
about international politics,
campus diversity issues, the
evils of capitalism, the pros and
cons of United States global
hegemony, and several other issues.

Everybody had a halfway
educated opinion about each issue, and was willing to take
stands on trivial points, argue
over them for a few minutes, and
back down if someone else actually knew something of the
matter. We all had a great time.
Then, in the middle of our
conversation, somebody asked
me offhandedly about some aspect of my religious beliefs. As
I answered her question, the rest
of the conversation in the group
gradually dwindled as people
listened to what I had to say
about religion. Several other
friends continued the discussion
for a while until the conversation drifted onto other matters
and fragmented as people lost
interest in what others had to
say.
Somehow, talking about religion is different from discussing other subjects. Personally, I
feel uncomfortable talking
about religion because I feel like
I am being put under pressure
to explain my views. I am not
sure whether other people feel
uncomfortable or not, but the
silence in the room was evidence that the religious discussion was in some way more important than the light banter that
had gone on before.
What was so different about
talking about religion? I think
that religion is a natural human
tendency that every person
shares. Whether people believe
in religion because recognition
of their cosmic insignificance
would drive them mad, or because they believe in communication with God, is the topic for
another discussion.
However, widespread belief in
a topic does not ensure that its

discussion will create silencp %
a room. Every person in

yet all were free to discuss thern,
complimenting and criticizing
others' views according to th'ejr

I would argue as well that it'is
not even the importance of religious views that make their discussion so awkward. An issue
like vegetarianism, for instance,
is deeply important to those who
believe in it. Yet vegetarians ancl
non-vegetarians agree to disagree, and a topic about beihg
vegetarian is not an earth shaking event. Religious discussions
are so few and far between not
because people have

society no longer values religion.

Combat the plague of cable T.V.
by David Ellis

Staff Writer

A plague is spreading
through Swarthmore's dormitories, ravishing all who have
the misfortune of falling in its
sinister path. Those fallen prey
to this deadly pestilence have
experienced loss of sociability,
lowered grades and extreme
brain rot. But
this deadly
scourge has
not taken on
the
traditional guise
of a disease.
No,
that
would be far
too easily
eradicated.
Rather, Swarthmore's latest
calamity is cable television.
Now, I know what you are
probably saying to yourself,
"Why is this idiot trying to
take away my cable? All I
want to do is watch 'South
Park' or college basketball or
maybe a dose of late-night
soft-core HBO pornography.
Is that too much to ask?"

My response is a resounding
yes. Cable has altered the social structure of Swarthmore
tremendously, and it can only
get worse. Where students
once gathered to engage each
other in intellectual conversation, they now gaze wide-eyed
at images changing too fast to
allow for linear thought.
Where we once discussed
Neitzsche, we
now

"Sportscenter."
Cable television constantly calls

like

know its remarkable timewasting and mind-atrophying
capabilities. But it is extremely difficult to read
Tocqueville when "Road

In addition, cable television
clearly precludes other more
enjoyable activities. By now,
surely everyone has been rebuffed from having active

Night Live" episodes are on.
Now I know what proponents of cable television are
going to say: "But we work
hard at Swarthmore! We need
a break! Who cares if it causes
massive brain rot and ruins our
meager social skills?"
My response is that there

occurs during commercial

everyone is silenced. I

Biweekly schedule gives Phoenix
chance to end long term difficulties
Recently, I was thinking about my first
visit to Swarthmore as a prospective student. I remember being impressed by the
campus, the staff and the students. My
interview went well and my dad fell
asleep in one of the Adirondack chairs.
All in all, the school seemed, in most respects, perfect.
Except for the newspaper.
Without a doubt, The Phoenix
is the worst college newspaper I
have ever seen. Granted, there
are some other bad ones out
there, but as a spec, The Phoenix definitely left me with a bad
taste in my mouth. How could
such a respected school have
such an unimpressive newspaper? This was hardly how I envisioned collegiate journalism.
On my visit, I couldn't even talk to anyone from the paper and the office, inconveniently located on Parrish fifth, was
locked tight. As a student who had been
very engaged in high school journalism,
I felt as though Swarthmore had let me
down.
However, I was still enthusiastic about
attending and through some error in the
admissions process I was actually admitted in the fall of 1996. I clearly remember detesting freshman orientation, par-

Spec genius, 9, on "60 Minutes"
by Toki Rehder
Contributing Writer

Greg Smith, a nine year-old
prospective student, appeared
on a segment of "60 Minutes"
last Sunday night. Many
Swatties tuned in for this profile of this childhood prodigy,
who has applied for admission
to Swarthmore this year.
Academically, it seems,
Smith is prepared to be a Swarthmore student. He is ambitious
and driven. Reading and learning are "what he likes most."
He hopes to have three careers:
research doctor, politician, and
engineer.
His academic pace has been
breathtaking. Before he was
one, he could do the alphabet;
by 18 months, he could add and

subtract. His IQ is off the bell
curve. He went through 2nd,
4th, and 6th grade in one year
and then skipped 7th and Bth. He
is taking nine courses this year
at his high school and studies
four hours every day.
Of course, there are concerns
about whether Smith has missed
his childhood. He has few
friends his own age. Some of his
peers stated that he is "sheltered" and "spends a lot of time
by himself."
"Are we making the right
choice for him?" his mother
wonders. Smith himself maintains that he has a "regular social life."
Smith is extremely self-motivated: "I've been trying to push
myself to limits," he said. His
father comments that Smith is

"leading the way."
Glimpses of Smith's personality were revealed during the
interviews. He is adamantly
against curse words on TV or
in movies; if he hears more
than three, he turns off the TV
or leaves the room. He has a
hard time remembering his
faults. In class, his goal is not
to be mischievous, but instead
"to learn."
Smith was at Swarthmore earlier last semes- ■
ter to visit. The "60
Minutes"
segment
showed a shot of him
inside a Trotter classroom and walking
around campus. Smith
has declared that Swarthmore is his firstchoice school.

adding, "I'd really like an official reaction. When people destroy crap it should be dealt with
uniformly."
Acts of vandalism have often
occurred during Senior Week,
but Goundie said the college
was not considering eliminating
it.
"The notion that Senior Week

would disappear is not true," he
said, but the College is considering overlapping honors and
course examinations in the
spring in addition to scheduling
graduation sooner for future senior classes.
In response to questions, the
deans acknowledged benefits of
increasing the College's size but
said that enrollment would be

Parking problem leaves students irate
parking permits to necessarily
have their cars on campus at all
times.
To legally have a car on
campus, students must file an
application with Public Safety,
represented by Terri Narkin,
who reviews the applications
in conjunction with the newly
rejuvenated Parking Committee.

The Parking Committee,
formerly comprised of Resident Advisors, is now an SCappointed committee.
Horatiu Stefan 'Ol, a member of the Parking Committee,
stated that "only students who
demonstrate genuine need beyond convenience" are granted
parking permits.
Under Public Safety's towing and booting policy, cars
are booted or towed if the
vehicle's owner is either a student whose request for a permit is denied or an unidentified individual without a permit.
Students whose requests for
a permit are denied sign the receipt of rejection, which ren-

ders the student responsible
for any future infractions
knowing the penalty is towing
or booting.
If the vehicle belongs to an
unidentified individual, Public
Safety posts a notice and the
individual is given a seven-day
grace period to contact Public
Safety.
Parking violators with permits are issued parking tickets ranging between $5 and
$25.
In a recent incident relating
to the car boot issue, last Sunday Victor Salcedo 'OO had his
car booted. It was subsequently vandalized.
Salcedo, who was denied a
car permit in September,
parked his car illegally on
campus during the weekend
and received a boot for this
violation.
On Sunday Salcedo visited
Ben West to inquire about how
to have the boot removed from
his car and left Ben West with
the understanding that he
would return on Monday to
pay his $5O fine and have the
boot removed.

phoned
Salcedo with the information that two individuals were sighted
running away from
Salcedo's car. It appeared that the two individuals attempted to
remove the tire with
the boot from his car
and to refit the vehicle
with a spare tire.
Salcedo suspects
that the two individuals either attempted to
steal the vehicle or to
incriminate him by
making it look as if he
tried to illegally remove the boot from
his car.
Public Security insinuated that Salcedo
was in cahoots with
the two individuals,
both of whom remain
unidentified, an accusation which Salcedo
vehemently denied.

Silesian Dance Theatre: From
Poland to Swarthmore with love

Liszt and Beethoven
by George Macros

Staff Writer

On Feb. 5 pianist Rudolph

Buchbinder and the Philadel-

phia Orchestra, led by conductor Wolfgang Sawallish, exuberantly performed Beethoven's
"Piano Concerto No. 1."
Written at the very end of the
18th century as a prelude to his
symphonies, Beethoven designed this piece to exhibit his
piano playing. It should not surprise anyone that this concerto
portrayed the young, sanguine
Beethoven clearly and logically.
Written in three movements,
the concerto begins with Allegro con brio, a movement filled
with direct, vertical bow movements of the strings. The lyrical
piano emerges in the Largo and
the ambitious Rondo ends the
piece.
About forty years later another brilliant pianist named
Franz Liszt began to experiment
with the symphonic form after
composing many piano concertos.

In the tradition ofmany of his
prior symphonies based on the
works of famous authors such
as Byron and Victor Hugo, perhaps because many writers and
poets influenced his studies at
Weimar, Liszt finished his
"Dante Symphony," a musical
depiction of "Inferno," in 1857.
Far from anything portrayed
in the first half of the program,
"Dante Symphony" leads the
listener through the struggles,
turbulence, and questioning of
"Inferno." Representing the first
movement, Inferno, the LentoAllegro frenetico began with the
cellos and basses in aggression.
Two clamorous tympanies interrupt this first motif, and after a
short rest, all the strings enter
the to play the constantly changing melody.
The strings and woodwinds
conveyed the majority of the
theatrics in this symphony, always having the upper hand on
the brass, which seemed weak
in comparison.

phrases and dialogues are
founded in ballet-like form, the

artists' work to a new level of

dance-ritual.

The key word in this week's
workshop has been "spine" as
the Silesian artists focus on "embracing the space" through the
fluidity of the palms of the hand,
the extension of the spine and
the weight of the head.
Since the company's emergence onto the international
dance scene in 1991, the
Silesian Dance Theatre has been
dedicated not only to the pursuit
of their own original work and
development but also to that of
the surrounding Polish community. The company hosts
monthly national and international workshops and seminars.

THE SWARTHMORE PHOENIX

Living
Indies (sort of) take
over Hollywood
If anyone had any doubts that
independent films are now
where it is at in terms of quality
in Hollywood, let this year's
Academy Awards nominations
be the death knell in the studio
coffin.
Of course, the Oscars are obviously not the best way to measure quality in
Hollywood, but
when even this
organization
overwhelmingly controlled
by studio types
has fallen under
indies' spell,
you know Universal, Paramount et. al have really lost it.
1996 was supposed to be the
year of the indie, when Miramax
scored its first best picture win
with "The English Patient"
(sweeping vistas and physically
and mentally tortured characters
will get those Oscar voters every time, no matter how contrived the plot) and "Jerry
Maguire" was the only studioproduced film to .even nab a
nomination.
Then in 1997 as "Titanic"
sailed onto the scene, the tide
was said to have reversed. The
studios are back, cried the
nation's entertainment gurus (at
a sad time when I was not yet
among them).
Still only three of the five
nominees came from the studios
who produce the vast, vast glut
of films that are considered by
the Ajcademy each year, and one
of those three, "L.A. Confidential" was very much in the neonoir style popularized by indies
and had very little in common
with anything a studio has put
out since "Chinatown."
And this year? Well two of the
five nominees, "Saving Private
Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line"
do come from Dreamworks and
Fox respectively, but they share
one crucial trait in common:
there is not a chance in hell either one would have been made
without the names Steven
Spielberg and Terence Malick,
respectively, attached as direc-

caust

comedy, "Life is Beauti-

ful."
"Shakespeare in Love" is the
fifth nominee, but everyone
knows Miramax is guaranteed a
spot for one of its English-language films every year. What

12 points and 7 rebounds. The decisive victory ended a 26 game losing streak to the
Bears dating back to the 1980s.
The Garnet followed this upset by another
with a surprise 63-56 romp over the two-time
defending Centennial Conference champions
from Muhlenberg. A 54-34 loss earlier in the
season to the Mules did not deter the Garnet.
Again, the squad came out flat and created
a large hole which they would climb out of in
the second half. Down 31-21 in the second
period, the team went on a 15-4 run to take a
temporary lead. Marandola gave her team the
lead for good by icing two free throws to make
it a 49-48 game.
Kile had 18 points and 18 rebounds on the
evening. Tarr had 13 points and hit a pair of
crucial three-pointers down the stretch to
widen the margin of victory. English added
10 points with some nifty perimeter shooting, and Marandola added 9 points and 6 assists.
"I think that Muhlenberg took us very
lightly coming into this game. After a few
key forced turnovers, we knew that the game
was ours for the taking," said Ryland. "Ball
movement and aggressive offensive moves
gave us the momentum in the second half."
Shibbles was also positive. "It was so great
to see the team come through in a pressure
situation. We have had some disappointing
close losses, and I was very impressed with
the composure of the team down the
stretch.... Our point guard Kristen English
was actually telling me torelax and enjoy the
last few minutes of the game. That's when I
knew that the team was not going to let
Muhlenberg steal the game from them."
The upset ended al3 gamelosing streak to
the Mules and gave the Garnet a chance to
finish at .500 or better. The team's 11 wins is
the best since the Garnet posted a record of
11-12 in the 1986-87 season.
"It's just great to see us come on so strong at
the end of the season, we've handed a lot of
people some upsetting and unexpected losses,"
said Marandola. "It's a wonderful feeling to be

Women's badminton finishes the
season with a solid 6-2 record
by Wendy Kemp

Staff Writer
Over the last two weeks, the
women's badminton team,
birdies in tow, has left the nest
of Swarthmore and traveled to
Bryn Mawr, Bryn Athen,
Haverford and Albright for
matches. In addition, they also
attended the PAIAW tournament, hosted by Bryn Mawr.
The string of matches brought
on a triumphant end to the season, with a final record of 62, and a second place showing
among all the competing
teams. In the PAIAW, the team
walked away with three out of
eight individual prizes and a
second-place showing.
First up was the Bryn Mawr
match on February 9. This
match was the most nervewracking, with the winner undetermined until the final
point was won. First singles
Wendy Kemp '99 won her
match quickly, 11-4,, 11-7
against the Mawrters' Kelly
Griffin. The other matches,
however, involved much more
hard work. Jane Ng 'Ol at second singles faced Bryn
Mawr's Kate Hill, while
Xiang-Lan Zhuo 'Ol at third
singles played Erin Dawson.
Both matches were long, filled
with smashes, drives, and
clears, but both Ng and Zhuo
eventually fell to their opponents, Ng at 6-11, 6-11 and
Zhuo at a close 11-12, 5-11.
With the score 1-2 overall
for Bryn Mawr, everything depended upon the doubles
matches, which were still being fought long after all three
singles competitions concluded. First doubles team
Erika Johansen '99 and Jennifer Chen '99 battled ferociously against Bryn Mawr's
Katie Cieslak and Maya
Milanytek, but lost their first
game 11-15. Filled with determination to defend their undefeated record, they conquered
the second game on the rebound, 15-11. The third game
was the deciding one, with
points lasting for minutes. Yet
in the end, Johansen's legendary smashes from back-court
and Chen's equally-legendary
drops from the net prevailed,
garnering a second win for
Swarthmore of 15-7.
The score was now tied at 22 and the deciding match was
being played out by the second doubles team with
Siobhan Carty 'Ol and Karen
Lange 'O2 for"SWartfrmore artd

Sureena Nair and Karin-Lin
Greenberg for Bryn Mawr.
With both teams and their
coaches looking on hopefully,
the birdie whizzed from team
to team, hardly ever touching
the ground. At long last Carty
and Lange prevailed with a
nerve-wracking 15-11, 15-11
win, bringing Swarthmore's
record to 4-1.
The team traveled to Bryn
Athen two days later, and faced a
perplexing challenge: the Bryn
Athen team had changed their
lineup completely from the last
match. They had switched first
and second singles players as well
as the third singles player and one
member ofthe first doubles team.
Whether this was an attempt at intimidation or a strategic move, it
failed miserably as the
Swarthmore women effectively
rose to the challenge and won the
match 4-1.
Kemp at first singles faced
Bryn Athen's Whin Brown, and
won her first gameby an easy 113. The second game was harder,
as Brown altered her strategy and
began to smash with alarming accuracy, but Kemp still managed
to triumph 11-9. Ng at second
singles faced a difficult match.
Her opponent, Stephanie Rogers,
had played first singles throughout most of the season. But never
one to let her guard down for even
a moment, Ng won herfirst game
11-6, and then one-upped herself
by winning the second, 11-5. At
third singles, Zhuo had a difficult
match: her opponent was originally a member of the first
doubles team, and had also played
at the second and third singles
spots two years previously. Zhuo
fought hard but eventually lost 711,0-11.
Both doubles teams pulled off
wins against Bryn Mawr. Chen
and Johansen beat Nicola
Homber and Jessica Hasen with
a score of 15-3, 15-1. Carty and
Lange followed suit, winning 158, 15-3. Swarthmore's overall
record was now 5-1, and after
winning their Saturday match versus Haverford, the record was
uppedto6-l.
The Haverford match provided victories for the entire
Swarthmore line-up. Kemp at
first won her match against the
Fords' Valerie Borek, 11-2,
11-0; Ng at second claimed
victory 11-4, 11-1 against Tu
Lee. At third singles, playing
her first singles match ever
was Chen with an impressive
11-1, 11-0 win. Carty and
Lange were moved to first
doubles for this match and
they rose to the challenge and

defeated opponents Monique
Tsang and Cheryl Leung 151, 17-14.
At second doubles, Olga
Rostapshova 'O2 and Lurah
Hess '99, playing their inaugural match, pulled off an astounding 15-1, 15-1 victory.
Haverford is to be commended
on their performance as well
because this is their team's
first year of competition.
With a 6-1 record, the team

only team this year to produce

net
Swarthmore fought all the way
this time but fell again by a 32 margin. Both victories came
from the doubles teams, as
Chen and Johansen triumphed
quickly at 15-8, 15-6. At second doubles, Lange and Hess
teamed up for the first time.
They proved themselves to be
a winning combination with
scores of 15-4and 15-6. Kemp
and Ng lost at first and second
singles and Carty for the first
time tried her hand at third
singles. She fought valiantly,
using her cross-court drops to
drive her opponent to frustration, though Albright ultimately triumphed. The
PAIAW tournament two weeks
ago provided a string of victories for the team. Ng won
second place in the consolation singles tournament, and
Swarthmore dominated the
main-draw doubles tournament. First-seeded Johansen
and Chen defended their position successfully and came in
