The Swarthmore Phoenix
Class of '02 On Its Way
"Rising from
the ashes..."

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

APRIL 3, 1998

by Wendy Kemp
As April Fools' Day came and went, the
unofficial holiday brought with it a buzz of
excitement as acceptance letters were received by Swarthmore's class of 2002.
Nineteen percent or 888 out of a recordbreaking 4,578 applicants were accepted
into Swarthmore this year. "It's really tough
to narrow down a pool of almost 4600 applicants who are as talented as those who
end up applying to Swat, so that you end
up with under 900 admits," says Dean of
Admissions Robin Mamlet.
The ideal size for the class of 2002 is 360
students. However, the past few years have
seen an increasing yield in the number of
admitted students who choose Swat. This
is due in part to Swarthmore's number one
ranking in U.S. News & World Report. "It's
pretty safe to assume that the number one
ranking has generated more awareness of
and interest in learning about Swarthmore,"
Mamlet explains. Three years ago, the yield
was 30%. It rose to 34% for the class of
2000, and then topped off at 38% for the
current freshman class. If the yield holds
steady at 38%, some students on this year's
waiting list might have a chance of being
accepted.
There is a growing concern among the
student body as to whether the #1 ranking
attracts the kind of students who embody
the characteristics of a true Swattie. Many
students have expressed misgivings about
the extra publicity, citing that it attracts prospective students who wish to attend Swarthmore because it will look good on their
resume. However, Mamlet does not feel this
is true. "I think, frankly, that most applicants seem to see pretty clearly the things
Swat stands for in terms of our academic
focus and intensity and our values," she
says.
Of the 888 accepted students, 38% are

valedictorians or salutatorians in their
classes. Forty-seven percent are male and
53% are female. They hail from five continents, 37 nations, and 49 U.S. states in
addition to Washington D.C., Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands. The most represented countries are Japan and China with
nine and five admits, respectively, and
once again, New York is the most represented U.S. state, with 15% of the admits
calling it home. Forty-three percent of the
admits identify themselves as students of
color, with a breakdown of 16% AsianAmerican, 14% African-American, 12%
Latino/a, and 6% international (non-US
citizens). When asked about potential
majors, "Undecided" reigned supreme,
followed by engineering, biology, English,
and political science.
Now that the letters of acceptance have
been mailed, a multitude of activities
geared toward prospective students are in
the works, including web chats,
phonathons, and various preparations for
the upcoming pre-frosh weekend.
While the best way to learn more about
Swarthmore is through a campus visit, this
is often not feasible. As an alternative, an
interactive web site has been set up by
webmaster Mark Tong '99, in order to allow prospective students to talk with faculty, students, and other prospective
Swatties. "We wanted to provide students
admitted to the class of 2002 with an easy,
fun, and informal way of obtaining more
information about Swarthmore, its academics, and its students," says Associate
Dean ofAdmissions Jenny Rickard.
The site'spopularity has by far exceeded
all expectations. The site, for which exclusive passwords have been sent to all
accepted students, has many features, including a Dancing Dean Robin Mamlet
image, a takeoff on the Dancing Baby phenomenon. Also included is a daily survey

of applicants, live chats with various Swat
faculty and staff, including Acting Dean of
the College Bob Gross, and question-andanswer bulletin boards. These boards,
monitored by faculty and students, provide
opportunities for admits to participate in
live chats not only with current Swatties,
but with fellow prospective students.
Megan Smith '96, an Admissions Counselor, says that "the site has been amazingly
popular, and it's interesting to see people's
'conversations'."
"We have found the site to be more popular than we ever imagined," Rickard enthuses. "It seems to be a great forum for
admitted students to not only talk to our
students and get the scoop on Swat, but also
for admitted students to simply get to know
each other." So far, Swarthmore appears to
be the only school with this unique kind of
website. The plan has even been taken a
step further, with a Live Chat party in the
works for pre-frosh weekend later this
month, in which the "chatters" will be unmasked.
"As far as we know, we are the only college that has created a site like this,"
Rickard reports, "and based on theresponse
from the admitted students so far, it is a
HUGE success. I'm sure we will not be
the only college doing this next year!"
The web site is only one ofmany efforts to
entice pre-frosh to choose Swarthmore.
Current students gathered in Parrish's
phonathon room on Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday nights in order to touch base
with the prospective students, and give
them a chance to ask any questions they
may have. Additionally, other phonathons
are taking place for both students of color
and international students. "Often the conversations are brief, but sometimes they get
fairly involved," said Smith of the

Lehigh, Georgetown Dean Candidates Meet With Students
by Andy Murray and Ruth Shoemaker
During the week, Dean search finalists Mark

Erickson and John DeGioia visited campus and answered questions put to them by relatively small but
serious-minded crowds of Swarthmore students. In
both meetings, students asked the finalists to describe
specific programs they had championed in their previous positions, what they hope to accomplish at Swarthmore, and what personal interests they have.
Although its scheduled time forced it to compete
with Monday night's Student Council meeting,
Erickson's meeting drew approximately 75 students,
roughly one-twentieth of the student body. As students

because it encouraged "real conversation on race and

sexuality" that included even those students who norand sexual orientation.
mally decline offers to participate on such topics.
During the meeting, multiple students inquired as
Erickson appeared to connect most strongly with
to ways in which Erickson has responded to racist or
students in relating his own experience with issues of
homophobic incidents at Lehigh, and ways he has tried
to encourage tolerance. As part of his response,
Erickson described a freshman course he had taught

race and alternative lifestyles. When asked if he was
conscious of and comfortable with alternative
lifestyles, Erickson talked about the "powerful" impact in his life of having friends and one former student in particular come out to him. Erickson also related a story of visiting Howard University in connection with studying for his thesis, and experiencing what
it felt like to be among the minority on a student campus.
On the topic of hate-speech and chalkings, Erickson
noted that there had been a homophobic "chalking
incident" some years ago at Lehigh and the
"[Administration's] response was much the same as it
is [at Swarthmore]." Erickson said that the chalkings
were erased and the Administration sought to use the
incident as an opportunity to discuss why homosexual
students did not feel safe or comfortable being "out"
at Lehigh.

In response to one student's question about how
majority students can be better educated about diversity, Erickson indicated he felt it was important that
learning take place either in small groups, or outside
the conventional classroom. He also noted that he knew
of no easy answer to these questions, saying "if there

wa*s one, people would have found it [by now]." Finally, Erickson suggested he felt support groups played
an important role in creating "secure spaces" open to
minority students.
Erickson told the audience that three things he values are ethical behavior and truth, his family, and a
spiritual life. Erickson himself is 42 years old, has
one daughter, age 13, and one son, age 8. His wife
works as the director of a "hands-on" museum for
children. He describes himself as an avid player of
tennis, a sport he enjoys as a stress reliever, a way of
building friendships, and as a means of satisfying the
"competitive bones in [his] body."
Erickson told students that thelast book he read was
Angela's Ashes, and he is currently reading Toni
Morrison's Paradise, and When Hope and Fear Collide. Laughing, he admitted his musical tastes were
eclectic including pop, classical and even country

music.
When asked, Erickson suggested that his strengths
were his interpersonal skills and what he called "bigpicture" thinking. While at Lehigh, Erickson noted

In less than one week's time, Swarthmore United for Cable Consumption
(SUCK) has rallied the support of over
400 students who would like to see the
College install cable for all dorm lounge
TVs. Initiated by a small group of about
15 students, many of whom are not involved in campus politics, members of
SUCK say they are tired of having to
trek to the Tarble game room in order to
watch cable. Presently, they are committed to soliciting the support of the student body through active petitioning and
discussions with concerned individuals
and committees.
SUCK believes that cable installation
would significantly improve student
quality of life. Currently students are
able to watch cable television in the
game room, the IC, or the BCC. Some
students, however, have noted that the
IC and the BCC are intended for use only
by certain groups and often are occupied
by meetings. The game room, in addition to keeping short hours, is across
campus from some dorms and has only
one television.
Supporters of SUCK feel that cable
television will increase the number of
entertainment options open to students.
According to Ben Newman 'Ol, "To the
extent that people already watch TV,
they will just have more options." Members ofSUCK also argue that cable TV

will make available programming that
helps students stay informedabout current events. As SUCK committee member Sonal Bhatia 'Ol notes, "There are a
number of educational programs we're
missing out on such as CNN, C-SPAN,
Discovery, and the History Channel."
Some students complain about feeling
cut off from the outside world. Says
committee member Scott Grant 'Ol,
"The majority of information from the
outside world comes from The Daily

Gazette."
On the other hand, there are those who
dissent from SUCK's goal of campuswide cable. Senior Tim Sibley is against
seeing cable TV installed in the lounges
because he believes it would cause them
to become less like community spaces.
He feels that not having a readily accessible TV is a learning experience, and
does not feel that the College has the
responsibility to provide students with
this perk. "You can go to almost any
college and get cable TV... I don't want
to see Swarthmore averaged out with
every other college in the country."
In response to arguments concerning
the value of cable TV and the suggestion that no one should watch TV, members of SUCK say that no one is there to
force them. As SUCK member and organizer Brendan Nyhan 'OO comments,
"It keeps you in touch with the real
world, with what real people are doing
and watching." He argues that it is a

matter of personal choice whether or not
one wants to watch cable TV.

SUCK also believes that cable TV installation would have a positive effect
on community life in residence halls.
They anticipate cable TV will enhance
the utilization of lounge space sincepresently most lounges are only reserved for
study breaks. "Community is being in
people's rooms watching TV," says
Grant. Nyhan also agrees that "people
are going to procrastinate no matter
what, whetherthat means playing Snood
or surfing the Internet. Cable TV will
draw people out of their rooms to the
lounges where they would come together."
Members of SUCK met with Director
of Residential Life Myrt Westphal and
the Housing Committee on March 23rd
but the group failed to reach any sort of
consensus. The big question of course
is who will pay for cable installation. So
far, there have been no site visits to the
campus by cable representatives. The
estimated annual cost for cable throughout the 12 dorms is around $5400. According to Bhatia, "The college has
found funds in the past for things. We
don't think it will be a problem with an
endowment of $7lO million."
Both sides admit that the cable will
likely have to be buried underground,
raising the initial costs of campus installation. SUCK proposes that the College
should cover the costs with funds in-

tended for facilities. As their proposal
states, "While we acknowledge thatthis
expenditure is not currently budgeted,
the school has always been able to find
such funds when needed and it should
again without taking it directly out of
our pockets, especially considering our
tuition is raised by 1 % above inflation
every year. After spending millions of
dollars on academic buildings, we
should get this small amount of money
to improve student quality of life, an
issue that gets far too little attention
from the administration."
Westphal and the Housing Committee say they would like to see SUCK
explore additional possibilities and
questions. They are concerned that if
one lounge in each dorm houses a TV,
then that lounge will become a crowded
gathering place for the entire dorm.
Along these lines, Westphal and the
committee suggested that it might be
beneficial to install cable in two or three
additional spots around campus like the
Danawell trailer and the Mary Lyon
breakfast lounge to improve access
rather than place cable in all of the
dorms. They also indicated that it might
become necessary to raise dorm charges
as there is not enough money in the residential life budget to fund such an expenditure. They recommended that
SUCK conduct a student survey to find

This School Was Mde For Chalkin'
The events surrounding the anonymous chalkings that appeared all over campus on Friday, March 27th left few people
satisfied. After examining both the administrative response
and student reaction, the editorial board has come to question
the integrity of the former and the effectiveness of the
chalkings.
It is pretty safe to assume that the chalkings occurred sometime during the early morning hours, and, according to President Bloom, at the beginning of the business day there was a
high-level administrative meeting in which agreement on removal of the chalkings was unanimous. The chalkings were
erased with water by environmental services before 11 a.m.
on the same day. An email from Vice-President Maurice
Eldridge went out at 2:06 p.m. classifying the chalkings as
hate speech "indefensible on the grourids of academic freedom." According to Bloom, the administration saw the erasure of the chalkings as part of the solidification of their implementation of the relatively new hate speech policy.
These administrative reactions trouble us. We have heard
numerous times since last Friday that the administration reacted faster in this situation than anyone on campus has ever
seen them react to anything. Swat administrators notoriously
drag their feet before making any kind of decision for action,
and we wonder if the gorgeous weather and accompanying
influx oftour groups
didn't have something to do with their
speedy response.
We are not alone in our questioning of the administration.
There was an emergency support group meeting in the IC last
Friday night to discuss this issue. The meeting produced a
statement that was distributed in mailboxes on Monday, saying simply that the incident, and the administration's reaction,
"troubles us." We'd like tp echo this statement, saying that
there's something about the administration's rapid-fire response to this incident that is unsettling.
On the other hand, we feel that most of the chalkings did a
poor job of articulating their point, although it did provide
support groups the opportunity to make meaningful demands
to the administration. Statements like "Swarthmore is
whiteland" seem more at home on a junior high school playground than at the nation's #1 liberal arts college. We understand the reasoning behind any attempt to start a more serious
race dialogue on this campus, but we think that perhaps the
chalkers chose the wrong method for these ends. The dialogue that they have started with these chalkings seems to be
mostly about the chalkings themselves, and not their content.
Finally, the administration at least has the sense to include
Swarthmore in President Clinton's ongoing national dialogue
on race relations. We think that this is crucial on a campus
where unspoken racial tensions threaten to break apart the fabric of the institution.

Swat Needs Course Reviews
As the envelopes, large and small, begin to circulate from the
Admissions Office and spec weekend nears, nervous young future Swatties no doubt are already wondering what courses to
take. Around the campus itself, people are already considering
what courses to sign up for less than a month from now. Unfortunately, these decisions are rendered difficult by Swarthmore's
lack of published reviews of professors and courses. Word of
mouth, while effective in conveying the high respect accorded
certain professors, is questionably valuable. Since word of
mouth generally consists of an individual's opinion, it carries
highly personal considerations of dubious utility, not to mention being a very small sampling.
A course review, present at most other colleges, would help
to clarify matters, and, if used to replace the surveys professors
routinely take at the end of classes, would be quite useful. Not
only would it provide concrete evaluations of courses and professors, it would also allow for easy comparison between them.
Student Council would be wise to consider this matter and make
it yet another constructive way in which Swarthmore progressively emulates comparable institutions.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Sincere Dialogue Necessary For Purpose of Olde
Club Closure
Reconciliation In Assault Case
Misrepresented

To the Editor.
I totally agree with John "J.J." Purdy that the
correct way to resolve the situation between
Mark Dingfield and Lou Basenese was by
peaceful discussion. I have only briefly met Lou
a few times, but when I heard what happened
that night I was very surprised that he would do
such a thing. Could this be the same Lou who
consistently makes intelligent and insightful
contributions in my English class? Is this the
same guy that has the love and respect of one of
my best friends? Just by virtue of his close association with my friend, I was, and still am,
willing to give Lou the benefit of the doubt. I
respect J.J.'s willingness to open dialogue, and
think that his points about "healing" were well

made.

Both sides agree that what Lou did was wrong
and has no place on our campus. The most basic disagreement comes from the varying accpunts of how he handled himself in the days
after the assault. J.J. mentioned Lou's attempts
to contact Mark and try to resolve things. As
far as Mark and all his friends know, no such
attempt was made. If Lou did make such an
attempt and was denied the opportunity to speak
to Mark and try to work things out, then that is
undeniably wrong. Lou should have been given
every opportunity to rectify the situation before
such drastic measures of punishment were taken.
However, as far as I know (and I've asked around
a lot), Lou actually declined attempts at intervention by two of Mark's teammates, Tony
Buendia and Tucker Zengerle. It is important
to note that Tucker is also a close friend ofLou's.
When they offered him the opportunity to talk
things out with Mark, he flat out refused. Lou
told both of them that he was going to stand by
what he did, and told Tucker to just keep Mark
away from him, adding that he'd give Mark an
explanation (not an apology) in a few days.
When Lou did decide to write a letter of apology to Mark, almost a week after the event, it
was soon delivered to Mark by Dean Goundie
and sent on to Al Bloom and members of the
CJC.
These refusals did not send the message to
Mark or to us, Mark's friends, that Lou was at
all willing to try and talk things out. It seems to
us thatLou began expressing remorse only when
he realized that the administration was out to
make an example of him. I realize, and most of
Mark's friends realize, that Lou was made an
example of, but we also find his apparent lack
of genuine remorse hard to swallow.
As for the issue of parental influence, which
J.J. raised in his letter, I think that aspect of the
situation has been blown out of proportion by
Lou's supporters. I'm here mainly on scholarships, so ifanything the school has power over
my parents, not the other way around. I can
still guarantee that if anything like what happened to Mark happened to me, my parents
would soon be here seeking whatever justice the
college could provide. The fact that Mark's
mother is a member of the Board of Managers
doesn't change the simple fact that she is first
and foremost a mom, and it is her instinct to
protect her child. By saying that Mark's mom's
position had some impact on the CJC's decision, J.J. is also inferring that Mark does not
deserve the same rights as the rest of us, simply
because his mother is a member of an important College board.
Aside from the attack, Mark was also subject
to the ill-advised chalkings and all-campus
broadcasts which inflated the perceived threat
from one person to a threat from an unknown
number of Lou's friends and supporters. I
unwaveringly support the rights ofLou's friends
to express their position. However, in order for
such expression to not be looked upon as simple
attempts at intimidation, it needs to take the form
of J.J.'s letter, thoughtful and signed. Some of
the chalkings were clearly intimidating, and not
at all conducive to dialogue. The one that began with "Mommy..." was especially so, as it
carried a tone of disrespect for Mark personally, as someone who can't stand up without his
mother. This also infers that he is perceived as
weak, and hence susceptible to further physical
or verbal attacks by Lou's supporters. The all-

campus Broadcast, also anonymous, mocking
Mark by name, carried the same air of threat
and intimidation.
As for Mark not feeling comfortable with Lou
here, he reached that point only after Lou refused to talk to him. The only thing more threatening than someone who attacks you physically,
is someone who does so, and then seems to be
unreceptive to reason. Lou was given his chance
to demonstrate his remorse, and passed it by.
However, Mark has no desire to see Lou forever unable to return to campus because of one
isolated incident. He has no objections to Lou's
returning, and expects no future conflicts with
Lou should he choose to come back.
If Lou was denied in his attempts to contact
Mark, then that is a clear case of the administration overstepping its bounds and interfering
with our rights to resolve things as mature adults.
Mark's original reaction to this situation was to
avoid intervention by college authorities. When
I talked to him the day after the assault, he said
that he wanted to talk to Lou, and figured the
whole thing would blow over. However, the
administration was alerted through channels not
in tune with Mark's wishes, and this led to the
CJC proceedings. The fact that Lou had responded negatively to Mark's attempts to talk
to him simply sped things along.
I think it's still possible for Lou to come back
to Swarthmore, and I hope he does. He and
Mark can still sit down and talk out any remaining issues like adults. Mark has already indicated to me that he would be open to such a
conversation. In order to begin a true dialogue,
both sides must first respect the willingness of
the other to stick to their position. I think that
has been accomplished, now it's time to demonstrate a willingness to understand the other
side.

Sweet Smell Of
Virtue Returns
To the Editor.
Spring has sprung, the flowers are blooming,
and the sticky sweet smell of virtue pervades
the air.
A righteous StudentCouncil member petitions
the Board of Managers to take "concrete action,"
on our behalf, against not-nice cartoons in the
school newspaper.
Anonymous but pure-hearted Swatties stay up
late at night to scrawl Our Conscience in chalk
on the asphalt.
Meanwhile, our deans, acting in loco parentis,
erase from the sidewalks the messages they decide will
or should offend us. As keepers
of campus goodness, they know what qualifies
as proper academic discourse, and they will use
any means necessary
Collections, visiting
lecturers, buckets and brooms
to keep our
minds pure, our feelings unhurt.
My friends complain that they can't enjoy the
nice weather when campus politics are so
stormy. But I think it's rather pleasant: there is
no debate, only endless "dialogue;" there is no
argument, only the pushing of virtue.

Letter

Policy

Letters to the Editor may be
submitted via email to

phoenix@swarthmore.edu,
dropped off to the Phoenix office on Parrish sth, or mailed.
Letters must be signed. We
reserve the right to edit for any
reason, and we urge you to
write letters no longer than 400
words.

To the Editor.
We would like to clarify several points with
regard to last week's article on our decision
to close the Olde Club temporarily (News 3/
27).
First, the article states that "Olde Club management wants to send a message to the
physical plant that the building has structural
problems that are not being properly addressed." At no point were we trying to send
the message that physical plant was not addressing the problem properly; rather, our
intention, as enumerated below, was to iridic
cate that we were serious about managing
student use of the space and being more vigilant about damage and neglect. In our recent
discussions with them, we have had only
positive experiences with the physical plant
and its staff. They have been consistently
amiable and co-operative in dealing with us
v
and attending to the space.
Second, it is implied in the opening para~
graph that it was only a secondary concern
of ours that a message be sent to the student
body about the abuse ofOlde Club. This was
in fact one of the key motivations of the decision. We felt that closing the space would
first, indicate that such behavior was unac*
ceptable and second, allow us time to develop
and institute procedures and policies designed to protect the space in the future. That
we were taking these sorts of steps and were
serious about preserving the space for all stur
dents to use is the only message we ever intended to send to the staff of the physical
plant. It was our hope that closure might also
offer an opportunity for some of the
maintainence problems to be addressed. Indeed, a number of them were. Quite understandably, other problems need to be fit infer
the already busy maintainence schedule of
the physical plant.
Third, the decision to close the space was
made prior to the weekend of Febraury 27,
during which there were in fact no further
incidences of damage.
Fourth, Salmeron does not, in fact, "select"
which groups may and may not use the space.
Reservations are made on a first come, first
servedbasis.Theband performances, booked
by Rothenberg, mentioned in the article were
allowed to stand due to outstanding contrao
tual obligations. Canceling themwould have;
resulted in cost to the college without the benefit of the performances.
Frederick M. Veith '9B, Olde Club Manager, and Jason Rothenberg '9B, Olde Club
Director
Editors' Response: On the first point,
Rothenberg told The Phoenix that the structural problems in Olde Club had not been
addressed by the physical plant. He did not
use the phrase "notproperly addressed," but
said thatthe physical plant had not inspected
Olde Club until after the closure. He also
stated that one reason the space was closed
"was to send a message to the physical plant
that we are serious about wanting to clean
up the space."
On the secondpoint, The Phoenix did not
mean to imply a prioritization of concerns.
Both motivations are mentioned in the same
sentence. The article does say that "The
physical plant was responsive and is trying
to fix the problems, says Rothenberg
On the third point, Rothenberg told The
Phoenix that "we decided to close the space
after the weekend ofFebruary 27th because
of a number of particularly destructive episodes." The Phoenix agrees that this does
not necessarily mean that thedestructive episodes were on the weekend of February 27th.
On the fourth point, it still seems apparent
to The Phoenix that ifSalmeron and the managers decidedagainst letting people rent the
space during March, then they are indeed
"selecting whenpeople can rent it. The article did not intend to imply that these selections are based on who the individuals applicants are, but just that they have thepower
to "select" whenparties are held.

been allowed to tell his story; yet his story,
when told, looks almost exactly the same
as the story The Daily Gazette originally
printed on the encounter between him and
Ari Plost. More disturbingly, words like
"abhorrent" are thrown around along with
accusations of manipulation and inflated
egos leading to personal vendettas. The
Wilson Kello cartoon in The L-Word depicts Ari Plost as a malign god manipulating a demonic Laura Barandes and a helpless Student Council. Automatically,
Laura Barandes's actions are attributed to
her personal relationship to Ari Plost; that
she might herself have been disturbed by
the editorial choices of The Phoenix and
believed that she was making a moral
choice on the issues is an idea that is not
considered.
In short, there is a conspicuous absence
of the tendency to give the benefit of the
doubt. I lor am I speaking only of the
words printed by those who "abhor" the
actions of Ari Plost and his manipulated
friends; the actions taken by Ari Plost and
Laura Barandes also indicate a belief that
they alone had some kind of moral insight
which they must act on. I would presume
it was the urgency of this belief
or, alternatively, the egotism ofthis belief which
held that no one else was competent to act
or to judge which led them to disregard
the appropriate modes of response to the
initial editorial choices of The Phoenix.
The accusations and counter-accusations
which have been spawned have grown into
a tangled mess. All attempts by various
publications on campus to make the series of events clear have only clarified for
me the extent to which the series of events
is inelevant. Laura-gate has grown to the
complicated, messy proportions of
Whitewater, Sex-gate and the ridiculous
profusion of Clinton scandals. My reaction to every new development has been
unanimous: why, I wondered, as the deluge of information on the subject washed
out of campus publications, does anyone
assume \ am interested in this stuff?
As far as I can see, both sides who have

Last Thursday, the weather abruptly

shifted from a rainy shade of winter to a
pleasant version of midsummer. Denim
shofts, and sunglasses became typical
rather than eccentric and suddenly people
began shortening sleeves and revealing
large patches of skin shrouded and deprived
of sun since fall. The tundra in front of
Parrish miraculously justified its title as
Parrish Beach (or this year, Parrish Marsh.)
The fortuitous timing of the nascent
warmth near March's final weekend gave
me pause to wonder what such times represent at Swarthmore.
While most students here probably considered weekends them a time ofrelaxation
in high school, at Swarthmore they are often are forced to do work uninterruptedly
without weekday distractions such as
classes. My first weekend here, my RA
calmly explained that festina lente though
they might on Saturday, students here consider Sunday a workday. Personal experience has confirmed this perception.
Ironically, Swarthmore being the often
contradictory place that it is, I found two
distinct perceptions of public consensus on
what to do with our fortunate infusion of
extra sun. Many people regarded it as an
opportunity to "break from the Swattie
paradigm" and enjoy themselves, as
chalkings suggests. Others found it a
chance to prove their ascetic diligence in
the un-airconditioned confines ofMcCabe
and Cornell. While the presence of such
dissenting opinions is among the things
such as high levels of stress, lack of sleep,
and social awareness, on which we pride

Carpe Diem.
ourselves (with varying degrees of accu-

racy) as Swatties, both actually spring from
the same place. They consist ofeither seek-

ing;to exemplify

or work in opposition to
our self-stereotype.
.Spmewhat paradoxically, the record
highs gave way to more seasonal weather.
While summer usually arrives somewhat
permanently rather than staying a while and
reopening the door on the way out, this time
we have been presented with a preliminary
return to spring. Lost in the discussion (although every event seems to merit one
here) is the reality that little more than a
month remains of the year. Freshman prepare for their first graded exams at Swarthrhore. Seniors who have signed contracts
will pay them nearly a year's tuition
here or more likewise sweat their way to
theses, final projects, or honors exams.
Sophomores and juniors who have not escaped to foreign climes, warmer or otherwise, are bound upon the wheel of fire onto
which the freshmen are justbeing strapped.
Lost among all of this is the irregularity of
times such as this weekend in which to reflect, whether in search oflost times, or in
celebration of present ones.
In keeping with the anti-stereotypical indojence some people chose to exercise, I
saw a group of freshman hallmates playing cards on Parrish Beach on Saturday.
While they may be simply unaware of what
awaits them, or even defying it, the scene
was pleasant on its own merits. They were
enjoying a little time together, in the circumstances the weather had presented.
Whether dispersion next year takes you
beyond Swarthmore or is merely exile in
low lottery-numbered room, the message
is (he same: think about where you are and
enjoy it while you can.

Reinventing the Ivory Tower
by Bryan Gobin
Just when you thought it was safe to stroll
on the sidewalk, the anonymous chalk
scribblers attack the pavement with their
mindless promotion of some perverse
"awareness" campaign. Maybe student
council needs to lobby for more staffing at
Psychological Services. As I left the credit
union office, I encountered the primitive
etchings of some enlightened individual
making me aware that some people use
Coppertone to get a tan while others are
stuck in their dark skin. Though Maurice
Eldridge issued the official response that
such inflammatory scribbles violated the
College's hate speech policy and therefore
were removed, as the self-appointed authority on chalk scribbler psychosis I must
remind the student body of my policy on
chalkings: all scribbles must provide accurate unbiased information and should
whenever possible be limited to directional
signs to the nearest keg. Just Keeping it
Real!
Do we live in a society that tolerates statistical discrimination? How about that
alleged culprit in the library laptop caper?
Was he stopped because of his color? If I
was going to steal laptops, I would have
the sense to act a little less suspicious. How
many times did this guy visit the library?
How many damn computers did he think
he could steal before somebody caught on?
In contrast there is my good friend who is
the least suspicious black man you would
ever meet. There is absolutely no mistaking him for a thief, yet he's been stopped
so many times by local authorities that I
kid him that he must be some kind of cop
pin-up poster.
I demand an apology from Hillary Thompson who believes that academic standards are going to hell because of admission policies influenced by race and gender preferences. Check your statistics Ms.
Thompson. The average SAT scores of
recent enrolling frosh classes have continued to climb in spite ofmy suspicions that
the chalk scribblers are dragging down the
average. Second, I really don't see where
"gender" has any bearing on admission
policies
do we give preference to
women? Or do you mean preferences for
some gender construction? Third, the College has a diversity policy, not racial and
gender preferences. I'm tired of these
snotty elitist arguments from certain faculty and students who worry that
Swarthmore's vaunted standards are declining because the delirious admissions
staff let in a few minorities. I don't know
the statistics on the credentials of minority
students relative to white students, but I

believe that the admission process should
not be some rigid formulation ofacademic
credentials. I think we need a blend of students that cuts across the gamut ofAmerican experiences (and some internationals!)
not just exclusive enrollment of prep
school grads, nerds and counterculture leftovers.
The admission process should take into
consideration the performance ofeach individual student in light of a wide range of
factors which would include her background, activities, educational opportunities, and academic performance. If a mi-

Chalking where it
really matters.
nority student graduated at the top of her
class in some disadvantaged urban high
school, that takes a lot ofdeterminationthat
no standardized test is going to capture.
You compare that minority student to some
other kid who got spoon fed with SAT
prepartory classes at the best private or suburban schools, and I think it becomes real
clear that our minority student earned her
ticket to higher education. She is probably equal or better than the privileged student whose only worry consisted of getting into the best colleges.
A lot ofS wattiesclaim that most of what
they learn at Swarthmore occurs outside
the classroom. If that's the
case, then diversity may be a
means in itself. If all we're
worried about is how high the
student body's academic statistics are, then fire the admission
staff and just scan applicants
information into a computer
and let it automatically generate a mailing list of acceptance
notifications.
How much did anyone really
earn their ticket to Swarthmore? If the brightest Swatties
just happened to be born in
East Asia, they might be stitching my Nikes right now instead
of deliberating about admission policies. Let's face it,
there are probably some students at Podunk Community
College who have just as much
intellectual capacity as some
Swatties. Yet the Podunk
graduate will likely have a far
more difficult time getting into
grad school. A Swarthmore

degree is a signal to graduate schools and
employers of high quality students. It's
brand-name recognition. In some respects
the admission process is nothing but a
once
screening tool forfuture employers
you get accepted you automatically have
more future options than a Podunk graduate. So should our admission policies simply perpetuate and reinforce existing class
bias in our society? How much should we
worry about the possibility of producing
fewer Ph.D. candidates whose endless published scribbles are read by .05% of the
population and directly contribute to the deforestation ofSouth American rain forests?
Finally we need to ask if Swarthmore is
a model employer. Do Swarthmore's human resources policies reflect the same kind
of standards accorded to faculty and students, or is leadership by example simply
bullshit rhetoric for commencement ceremonies. Are there structures in place to
allow staffthe opportunity to continue their
education and allow those who aspire to
acquire the skills to advance either within
Swarthmore or with another employer?
The massive amounts of resources at Swarthmore are amazingly underutilized. The
Kremlin crowd probably wants administrative staff to get faculty wages, but realistically how about a computer-based GED
program for interested staff? Aside from
exam periods, it's not as if there are insufficient computers, and I volunteer the chalk
scribblers as tutors because they need to
raise their sights above the pavement and
help people pursue meaningful goals.

been involved in this mess has come out
looking like an egotistical hothead obsessed by minordetails of procedure which
are blown up into persecution stories,
"constitutional" crises and a plethora of
uncharitable allegations. People are not
going to remember that this was supposed
to be a debateabout sensitivity to victims
of persecution or freedom of the press,
because that was not, in fact, what the debate turned out to be about. It turned out
to be about people who were absolutely
convinced of their own righteousness arguing about inconsequential minutiae,
which is unfortunate, because I think that
both sides had valid points that should have
been aired and explored, but which somehow got lost in a shuffle in which The
Phoenix never managed to differentiate its
ideas of freedom of the press from those
expressed by theHolocaust revisionists (in
what I think everyone agrees were, in fact,
offensive letters) and those objecting to
that concept of the free press never managed to articulate a clear ideal to oppose
it.
In the end, I think the victim of this
whole mess is going to be Vincent Jones,
because I believe that the aftereffects of
this tempest will be to drag the Student
Council through the mud. And, unfortunately, I think that theresult of that will be
a decline in student respect for student government in general. His recent attempt to
leave some "legacy" by using student government to change things that students
have been grumbling about for years has
been vitiated and lost. The feeling that I
got from the ease with which various
changes were made in Dining Services was
that perhaps the rampant apathy to student
government was misplaced. Perhaps the
fact that student government is irrelevant
has its source in the fact that we do not
make it relevant. Perhaps our cynicism
betrayed us in order to fulfill itself.
The rethinking of student government
which might have been built up through
the positive changes which have been accomplished simply through a little open
dialogue may well be lost in the aftermath
of a mess which made everyone look bad.
Laura-gate looked to me like a portrait of
the negative stereotype of student government I have had. And perhaps its real result has been the loss of something which
might otherwise have been valuable.
Or, on the other hand, perhaps I am simply taking all this too seriously. We were
probably right to be embarrassed to demand changes in Dining Services;
Sharpies and Tarble have been our
hairshirt, our atonement for our status as
privileged. And in the wake of the '6os
and '7os, portraying changes in Dining
Services as a campus awakening is questionable at best.
So who cares? I don't know, but I would
like to hear from anyone who does.

The Bear (as told to Katie Menzer)

'Because of the recent onset of this unbearably (pun intended) warm weather,
the bear has gotten a pretty nasty heat
rash all over the bear's body. Fur coats
might be fashionable, but they 're damn
unpleasant during a heat wave. Between
the trips to the dermatologist and the
tricky task of applying ointment with my
clawed paws to my more sensitive areas,
7 have had no time to answer any mail.
My best friend, the rabid squirrel, has
been gracious enough to take over my
dutiesfor the week. Well, he says he won't
help me with all my duties. He won't, for
instance, help me with the ointment. He
says he's not that kind offriend. Anyway,
I am quite thankful to him for his selfless
generosity. However, let me warn you that
he is indeed rabid, and has been for some
time now, so I would take everything he
says with a grain of salt and a Valium.

Dear Rabid Squirrel,
I recently broke some bones in my foot.
Don't ask me how I did it 'cause I don't
know. I just woke up one day and my foot
swollen to the size of my head. Now
have
to wear this cast for the next six
I
weeks. It's like sporting a giant, thermal,
cement boot. I am so grumpy and uncomfortable. Do you have any suggestions to
help me alleviate my pain?
Sincerely,
Gimpy

Dear Gimpy,
Yo! Thanks so much for writing in! The
bear has mentioned to me that you've
been seen limping around campus. Let me
stress that the bear, as do I, feels very sorry
fqr you, especially in this heat. Of course,
the bear has also mentioned in passing that
you would be an easy kill, since you are
so, .pathetically slow and everything, so
ypu might want to think about staying indoors as much as possible for the next several weeks.
You know, I once mysteriously broke
my foot, too. I feel like we are brothers.
Of course, my situation was slightly more
lamentable than yours. You might be uncomfortable, but a squirrel with a cast on
ife leg might as well hang a sign around
ift'neck that says, "Free lunch."
T couldn't figure out how I broke my leg,
either, until I underwent some regression
hypnotherapy. It's amazing what you can
fihd out about yourself in hypnotherapy.
Fpr example, I didn'tknow untilrecently
that I am, in fact, the love child of the
actor who played Doogie on the hit television show Doogie Howser, M.D. and
D'ale of Disney's Chip n' Dale. Who
would have believed it?
J also found out that I was once abducted
by aliens. I was just hanging out on top
of one of those metal trash cans outside
Parrish when I saw this painful bright
i flash of light. I closed my eyes, and when
;I opened them, I was in this crowded,
:dark, foul-smelling room. I can only assume I was in the examining room of
• some spaceship. I couldn't move, but I
; tried to struggle for my freedom anyway.
; The aliens around me were speaking some
•language I couldn't understand that
•sounded much like papers rustling and
: bottles clanking against one another. My
memory gets a little fuzzy at this point,
: but I think that they made me play Twister
: with them. They were cruel Twister players, forcing me to do things no squirrel
should be forced to do. That's how I broke
:my leg, I believe. When I regained my
consciousness, I found myself in the
bear's mouth. The bear says another squirrel had found me in the trash and the bear
had "rescued" me and was trying to
"shake" me awake. Whatever. I guess the
aliens had attempted to deposit me where
they had found me on top of the trash can,
but their alignment must have been
slightly off, so they dropped me inside the
trash can, instead.
I know it all seems so hard to believe,
but there is evidence of an alien presence
everywhere you look on the Swarthmore
campus. For example, take a stroll
; through the very center of the rose garden. It's so perfectly pruned, just like
someone had intended it to be that way.
: It's obvious to me, as I'm sure it is to you,
: that the center of the rose garden is a landing site for alien space crafts.
Have you, Gimpy, been hanging out in
: the rose garden, by any chance? Are you
! particularly bad at Twister? I think these
; questions, though painful, are ones that
' you probably need to ask yourself.

Lethem's As She Climbed:
A Layman's Look at Academia
by Tim Stewart-Winter
People have always made fun of academics, and rightly so. In his recent
novel As She Climbed Across the Table,
Jonathan Lethem sends up physics in
particular and university culture in general.
Lethem is a tremendously hip young
writer in fact, he was the only novelist named as one of Newsweek's "100
People for the New Century." His books
all have playful, postmodern titles and
jackets, and they span a remarkable
range of subject matter.
On his recent book tour, Lethem made
the trek out to Swarthmore from Philadelphia to speak with me for a few minutes about the novel and his career more
generally. He's promoting his new book,
Gitl in Landscape, which (get ready)
draws on John Wayne movies to tell a
coming-of-age story that begins in a
postapocalyptic Brooklyn and soon
moves to another planet.
Since he was visiting a college campus, however, we talked about As She
Climbed Across the Table, which is just
out in paperback. The novel provides a
wry rendition of faculty foibles. Lethem
says it grew out of a fascination with the
academic novel as a kind of genre, and
from his experience living for ten years
in Berkeley, California, where he was
"willingly or unwillingly immersed in
academic culture."
He was enthu-siastic, though, about
visiting Swarthmore; he told me
he "flirts" with
academia. He
never finished
his
term
at
Bennington College, yet he is considering someday
working in an academic institution.
"I have love-hate relationship to the
lifestyle," he said in the interview. "I
always liked college towns, I love bookstores and I coffee shops. At the same
time there's an indulgence and a kind of
solipsism and smugness to some academic life that is quietly claustrophobic
for me."
The novel's protagonist is an anthropologist, Philip, whose subject of study

is other academics. In that respect he
matches Lethem's own position as an
outside observer of university life. Philip
is in love with Alice, a physicist, and the
story begins with the breakdown of their
relationship. Instead of being drawn
away by another man, however, Alice
seems to have fallen in love with an experiment. Rather improbably, Alice and
her colleagues have produced a void in
the universe, which they have dubbed
"Lack."
The dialogue in the book is definitely
odd. Early in the book, another physicist accuses Alice of "losing that essential detachment from her work." She asserts that Lack requires "engagement."
Philip, incredulous, says, "You're saying
that what Lack wants is a relationship."
"Right," she tells him. "And you're saying you can provide that." "Right."
The book details Philip's efforts to win
back Alice, as well as her increasingly
fanatical devotion to the project. She begins to sleep in the laboratory, ordering
in food and occasionally returning to the
couple's apartment to get clothing. In a
few scenes, Alice attempts to involve herself physically with Lack, and here the
story gets really weird.
The other major woman character is,
unfortunately, a therapist who tries to seduce Philip. She is connected to a side
plot involving a pair of blind men who,
for reasons that are unclear to me, Alice
leaves at Philip's
doorstep when
she begins to get
wrapped up in
her experiment.
The two men
have endless conof objects
about
the
location
versations
and the timing of events, which allows
Lethem a chance for lots of amateur
musings on time, space, love, and so on.
"I don'tknow anything about physics,"
Lethem freely admits, "which is why I
wrote from Philip's point of view. I did
about ten minutes' research." Fortunately
or unfortunately, it shows. Lack's physical properties are never really made clear,
and Lethem never makes much of a connection between his cosmic musings and

Below the sheath of
eccentricities, normalcy,

Noted author Jonathan Lethem
actual physical principles; he told me he
was trying to "creatively misunderstand"
the jargon of contemporary physics. I think
some readers will feel like there's really
not much substance here, while others
might enjoy the comic spoofery of it all.
Lethem told me he thinks of physics as
"the Olestra of disciplines," by which he
means that it is cognitively slippery and
hard to absorb for most people. "I wanted
to write about what it was like to be a layman with a passing attraction to physics,
but unable to really parse the mathematical end of it." He's interested in people
who bought Stephen Hawking's A Brief
History of Time, but never made it very far
into it. (He counts himself among that
population.)
j
The book is populated with professors
who possess only one or two traits. At
times, the satire moves beyond the point
of credulity, as in a rather hyperbolic scene
in which a Nobel Prize-winning physicist
runs into the bathroom crying after being
chastised by a deconstructionist from the

English department. "Meaning accrues in
unexpected places," says the latter. "And
drains unexpectedly out of others. Your
physics, for example, has proven insufficient."
Lethem said, "There are a lot of elbowin-the-ribs kind of moments that will be
nice inside jokes for academics, but I think
that finally it's a story about falling in love,
it's a story about being confused by science, and things that are much more universal."
Students or non-academics might actually be the best audience for the novel,
given its caricatured portrayal of life in the
university. This difference in audience
makes As She Climbed Across the Table
somewhat different from other academic
satires. "I'm probably the only person ever
to write an academic satire who's not even
a college graduate," said Lethem. "Usually those books are written by tenured professors working off steam."

Jedi Tricks Shines at Club Evolution Jam Session
by Chris DiLeo
"We're throwin' this here down for the
true heads. Fuck all those major label
fake asses. The real shit is right here!"
When the host of the show, Big Rich
Medina, said these words, I knew I was
in the right place for my first hip-hop
show. An eclectic collection ofAdidasclad, Kangol-hat-wearing, backpack-toting gathered on Tuesday night to hear a
collection oflocal and national hip-hop
acts show their stuff at Club Evolution
in Philly.
The road to this show starts a week
ago in a small record shop on 3rd. St. in
Center City called Footworks. Here, I
heard about a hype show featuring your
favorite and mine, Jedi Mind Tricks
along with Oakland rockers collectively
known as Hieroglyphics (Del the Funky
Homosapien, A-Plus, Opio, Tajai,
Phesto, Casual, Domino, Pep Love,
Jaybiz). I'd only heard briefly about
Heiro, but jumped at the opportunity to
see Jedi, I was sold.
Arriving early, like a true groupie, I
waited in the parking lot hoping to catch
a glimpse of some of the performers.
The first notable to arrive was Media,
PA's MC Sean "The Jewish Nifija." Sean
dropped a few verses in the parking lot
over the beats kicking from his car's stereo. His freestyle abilities had us and
several others bobbin' their heads. This
was a good sign.
Next to arrive was Jedi Mind Tricks.
Dressed for the occasion, as always,
Ikon, Stoupe, Chico, and Rasul came
over to chat a bit. Cool and collected
they just chilled out in the lot awaiting
the word from Big Rich that it was time
to go on stage.
At 7 p.m., the show was supposed to
have been started, but the doors were not
opened yet. By 7:15 the husky bouncers checked tickets, ids and frisked friskily. I still wanted to see Hiero roll in so
I stayed with JMT There was such en-

ergy amongst these boys. Anxious to perform, they broke into an a capella spat in
the parking lot, each taking a turn rhyming while Stoupe provided the human
beat box.
The first crew to take the stage was
Name, and to be honest, I missed them.
The word later on was they had their act
together. Finally, despite the fact Hiero
had not arrived, Jedi was called to the
stage.
I then headed inside the club to get a
spot to groove in. After finally passing
through a metal detector, I was on the
floor of the club which was similar to,

The real shit
is right here.
but more structurally sound than, Olde
Club. A great mix of people all moving
to the sounds of the DJ spinning some
independent label hip-hop artists as Jedi
set up to take the stage. Ikon, Chico and
Rasul stood in the wings as Stoupe swaggered up to the turntables. As the DJ
fadedhis song out, Stoupe flipped a wind
sound track which carried on into the
crowd and Ikon unleashed "Winds of
War." With undiminished energy, they
went straight into "The Apostle's Creed."
Chico and Rasul definitely pulled their
weight as well, delivering tight, concise
and well thought out verses. Despite the
poor sound system, JMT still presented
their best. "I Who Have Nothing" was
their final song. Genuine and banging,
JMT provided the crowd with a performance that did not let the crowd down.
Their songs were straight from their critically acclaimed debut album, The
Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and
Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness.
After this surprisingly short set, JMT
were rushed off stage and ChiefKamachi

was ushered in. This three man crew from
Philly were equally hopping. Simple lyrics and animated stage presence brought
smiles and nodding heads of approval. At
the end of their set, it appeared as though
the tract for their final song was not cued
properly and they decided to break into a
freestyle session which was nothing less
than super.
Kamachi were also rushed offstage despite
the fact that Hieroglylphics was not ready
to go on. The DJ went back to work and
flipped somemore underground tracks.
Surveying the crowd, other hip hop notables, such as Bahamadia could be found
up in the bar section of the club. Stoupe,
Sean and others went to on of Philly's finer
beverage purveyors whereupon several belligerent members of the Philadelphia community, with loaded guns, confronted the
stars claiming they were "Playa' hatin'" and
other mainstream-Power 99 catch phrases.
Fortunately the situation was diffused with
no bloodshed. Finally after a half hour, Big
Rich took the stage again. After a long list
of thank yous, shout outs and quick jokes,
he introduced Hieroglyphics and the crowd

ish Ninja's entourage chatting about jewelry and what not. House DJ, Josh Wink,
quickly stopped by for a huge sack of take
out while we were there. This evening
proved to me that what you hear on the radio is not hip-hop. The true community,
the driving force behind all of today's popular rap artists, is the underground, acts like
Hieroglyphics, Jedi Minds, and Chief
Kamachi who continue producing music
not for money but for the respect that is
earned by producing quality music that is
true to their ideas and beliefs.

Not just any college newspaper.

bumpers

went nuts.

Before the set began, several members of
the crew hyped their new album 3rd Eye
Vision, which was listed as the #1 release
at Tower Records last week. After the promoting stuff the show went on with panache. Mixing material from their old album and their new, Hiero had the entire
place bouncing. Highlights included "After Dark," "93 'til Infinity," "The Who,"
"The Last One," "Never No More," and
"Oakland Blackouts." They also worked
the crowd very well spawning chant competitions and illiciting cheers from the
crowds as part of their songs. They too
went into a hype freestyle session which
lasted two beat tracks (-10 minutes). This
show was a must see for the Hiero fan, and
speaking as a nonfan, I was impressed by
their stage presence and lyrical flow.

Moore Takes
a Crack at
The Big One
The poster
for Michael
Moore's new
documentary
The Big One is
a perfect example of the
Altered States problems the
Patrick Runkle
movie has. It's
a take-off on
the Men In Black poster, and it features a
smiling Moore with sunglasses and trademark baseball cap, and the slogan "Protecting the Earth from the scum of corporate
America." It's a cute idea, but it represents
the commercial, toned-down, stand-up comedian side of Moore, instead of the
fiercely independent documentarian who
showed his face in Roger & Me and sometimes on TV Nation.
The Big One, one of Moore's suggested
alternate names for the United States, follows him on the cross-country tour for his
1996 book Downsize This! The movie features Moore speaking to numerous crowds
in cities both small and large, and seeing
the devastation that downsizing has had on
the quality oflife in middle class America.
He also pays some trademark Michael
Moore visits to corporate offices, asking
bluntly why companies making record
profits choose to shaft American workers.
It's Moore's same old shtick, but he's
good at it, so I give him lots of leeway. Still,
much of the movie's material is recycled
from Downsize This! After having read it
in the book, heard it from Moore during
his book tour and visit to LPAC, and now
in the movie, it's really getting tiresome.
The Big One was shot on video and transferred to fdm, which results in jarringly
ugly compositions and a overall grainy,
unpleasant look.
there are some
Don't get me wrong
moments in The Big One that were amazingly funny, like when Moore finds a
former prison inmate who was used by
TWA to take reservations while he was in
jail. A notner memorable moment has
Moore in all his glory finding out why the
Pillsbury doughboy needs government
funding, and challenging Nike chairman
Philip Knight to a foot race. And be sure
not to miss the destruction of Flint,
Michigan's Autoworld, featured to hilarious effect in Roger & Me.
I think The Big One is further proof that
Moore should stick to funny corporate visits and knee-jerk activism, and leave the
political thinking and grass roots organization to someone else. He's a funny commentator with lots to say, sadly, his potential is only partially realized in The Big One.

struggle between two divas, acted by Heather Weyrick
and Leigh Nolan, to win George's love. Much hilarity ensues as George struggles to determine his lines
with the help of the stage-manager-turned-maid, acted
by Mattie Weiss. Just when it seems that he might
actually fit in, however, the audience discovers that
they are in even more than a play within a play
there are actually three plays being performed simultaneously. This becomes apparent when Horatio,

is acted by Weyrick, explains the nature"
of heaven, hell, and sin. She is inter-'

RESTAURANT REVIEW

Countryside: Menu Diverse,
But Quality a Question
by Rob McGreevy and Seth Budick
Admittedly, the Swarthmore area is
grossly underserved by decent restaurants.
Being optimists however, we've been attempting, these last few weeks, to identify
eateries in the area that may be
undeservedly ignored by, or otherwise unknown to Swarthmore students. Continuing our thus only marginally-rewarding
quest, we this week made the trek to the
Countryside Market and Delicatessen at
514 Yale Ave.
We were surprised to learn thatthe Countryside serves dinner; food is served Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Sunday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. When we arrived
at around 6:15 on a weekday evening, the
seating area was approximately half full
with a local crowd. The "restaurant" is
actually just the front section of a large
store with tables seemingly placed haphazardly wherever space permitted. Our particular table was nested in a nook housing
"gourmet" teas and coffees which provided
a topic ofconversation, but provided all of
the ambiance of eating in your pantry.
We ordered iced tea which was a flavored
black tea that came with slices of orange
as well as lemon for an interesting beverage. The menu was composed exclusively
of sandwiches, but was the widest selection of sandwiches we had ever seen. Most
of the choices are variations on the chicken,
ham or turkey with some type of cheese
and sauce theme. Vegetarians and vegans
have several options, however including
tempting combinations of eggplant, fresh
roasted peppers, portabella mushrooms,
jalepeno and garlic hummus. All of the
sandwiches are served on fresh bread
(french multigrain, marble rye and Countryside) with Tarble style chips and a tasty
almond cookie.
We chose the Widener Way, Haverford
and Portabella Mushroom Special sand-

wiches. The Widener was billed as "turkey ;
pastrami with imported French emmenthal j
cheese and Lancaster County horseradish !
mustard served on marble rye bread". We ■
were disappointed; the turkey pastrami j
tasted like standard roasted turkey, the |
cheese was cut as thinly as possible, the ',
horseradish was too potent and overpower- j
ing—bringing us almost to tears and com- ]
pletely disguising the rest of the sandwich. ',
The Haverford came closer to fitting its bill- '
ing as "lightly breaded oven-baked chicken ;
breast, with lettuce, tomato, pickle and ;
honey dijon mustard served on french '■
bread." The chicken was breaded and ;
chilled and the flavor mingled delightfully ;
with the honey mustard and pickles. Served '
on a hearty french bread, this generous j
sandwich was very satisfying. The grilled ;
portabella mushroom special was especially j
charred and so we had to send it back. On '
the second try, it was a very tasty sand- ;
wich with meaty mushrooms and home- j
made pesto. On the negative side, the bread ',
was dense and the sauce too oily.
The Countryside's menu was unfortu- ;
nately more exciting than what the restau- !
rant managed to deliver. References to !
stilton and emmenthal cheeses on the menu j
filled us with gourmet expectations, but the I
quality of the sandwiches was very uneven.
Little things like substituting a nice side of
potato salad for Lay's potato chips might
help the Countryside to justify the prices
for its sandwiches which range as high as
$6.95 and are not terribly generous. While
the Countryside is obviously striving to
move beyond a menu of simple turkey and
roast beef sandwiches, a more competent
chef may be required to take them to the
next level. As it is, we can offer only another qualified recommendation; for a
change, go to the Countryside market for
lunch or dinner, but keep your expectations
low, cross your fingers and hope that you
get lucky.

Defense Continues to
Plague Baseball Team

7

Track Team Gives Strong
Showing at Ursinius
by Ambrose Dieringer

by Patricia Barrientos
This past weekend, the Swarthmore baseball team played a
doubleheader in their first confereace meeting against Western
Maryland. Things did not go
well for the young team as they
were swept 11-1, 10-8. The inexperience showed in the bottom
of the 7th inning of the second
game when W. Maryland scored
7 unearned runs. Suddenly the
8-3 Swarthmore lead disappeared
despite the strong pitching performance of Steve Farneth 'OO.
The Garnet also dropped the
previous game to Richard Stockton, 12-4. Jay Schembs 'Ol was
tagged for 12 runs on 14 hits
though only 7 were earned. Josh
Roth '99 pitched 2 shutout innings with 2 strikeouts. It was
Dave Giles's '9B ball for the final 2 innings as he allowed 1 hit
and no runs.
In Tuesday's game, against
Washington College, the team's
defense broke down again. When
the season started, the members

of the Garnet could not emphasize enough the importance of defense. In spite of this, the team's
defense has continued to collapse. They often find themselves in 6 or more run deficits
as singles hit by the opposing
teams result in extra bases and a
string of unearned runs. The
team has also been hurt by the
lack of timely hits. In the Washington game, the Garnet had their
best scoring opportunity in the
third inning when they loaded the
bases with only one out. However, they were only able to score
one run on a base on balls. Although the Garnet scored three
runs in the ninth inning, it was too
late. Washington had gone ahead

12-4.
JoeAleffi 'OO led the Garnet offense with 3 hits and one run
scored. Dan Johnston '9B,
Schembs, Brian Lopez 'OO, Josh
Lindsey 'Ol, and Roth all singled.
Giles pitched 7 innings giving up
4 earned runs on 10 hits.
Schembs allowed 2 runs on 2 hits
in his 2 innings of work.

Last Saturday, the Swat track teams travelled to Ursinius for
an unscored five-way meet. The beautiful, breezy day yielded a
plethora of first place finishes on the brand-new Ursinius track.
Incidentally, because this was the first official competition run
on the track, all first place finishers are automatically record
holders for the track.
On the women's side, Desiree Peterkin 'OO hopped, skipped,
and jumped to a first place finish in the triple jump. Wonda
Joseph 'OO hurtled at ludicrous speed down the track for a victory in the 100m. Stephanie Herring '99 hurdled like a woman

Lackluster Tourney
Provides Learning
Experience for Earthworms
by

John Christodouleas

The Swarming Earthworms travelled to Haverford last Saturday and Sunday for the tri-annual Layout-Pigout Tournament.
The Earthworms fielded two squads on the first day of the competition, an A-team and a B-team. The A-team finished the day
with two wins and two losses. The B-team posted one win and
three losses. Only the A-team played on Sunday and they lost
both of their games.
Despite only two wins, co-Captain Roger Bock '99 was pleased
with the tournament. "We didn't come up with many victories, but
our guys played with tremendous heart and spirit and I love them
for it. I really do. I love them for it." said Bock. "If we can
continue to play with the same enthusiasm, I think the wins will
come. We learned about our weaknesses at Haverford, but we also
learned about our commitment to the game and to each other. We
were like a family out there. It was special, man. I felt it. You
can't quantify that with a win-loss record." Sasha Clayton 'Ol
agreed, "Yeah, the losses were frustrating, but we had great spirit,
especially Roger, our co-Captain. He really made everybody feel
appreciated. I mean, self-esteem is very important to him."
This weekend the Earthworms will compete at Penn State for
the annual Spring-Phling Tournament.

Warmothers Topple Nationally
Ranked Teams
by Lindsay Goldsmith and
Mandy Hourihan
Oh what a beautiful weekend for
frisbee...The
Swarthmore
it
Warmothers ripped up last weekend at the Haverford Layout Pigout
Tournament. The day began with
an elating 10-3 win over Columbia (currently ranked 16th nationally). Highlights of the game included layout scores by Mina Kim
'9B and Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol
and hot defense by Mandy
Hourihan '9B
yeah point block!
The Warmoms didn't cool off a bit
and proceeded to score 28 consecutive points, thereby shutting
out both Penn State and University
of Rochester. Power cuppers
Annie Bacon '99, Margaret Parker
'OO, Anna Sugden-Newbery '99
and Delila Leber '9B threw an awesome zone defense, with Erika
Baumgartner '9B stopping everything deep. With Gabi KruksWisner '99 and Leslianne Yen's
'9B fresh legs (fresh out of jai1...2
states d0wn...48 to go) and gorgeous throws, the Wamother's offense was unstoppable. Jenny
Hoedeman 'Ol and Hourihan took
over the endzone with some hot
grabs and a layout score for
Hourihan in the Pennsylvannia
State game.
A disappointing loss to UPenn
(ranked Bth nationally) ended the
day, but didn't ruin the glory of
going 4 and 1 (due to a forfeit by
Amherst), and placing 2nd in their

pool, upsetting the seeding. Other
highlights of the day included
Laura Pomerance's 'OO consistent
long play, Carrie Bader's '99 awesome defense (from her former volleyball days), Sugden-Newbery's
hot skies deep (way to get up),
Goldsmith's heads up and layout
defense attempts, and Cathy
Wirth's '99 amazing ability to play
every position on the field well.
Props also to our favorite boys

Benson Wilder '99 (although he
didn't have to change a tire this
weekend) and Noam Unger '99
whose love and support made it
possible to survive the UPenn
battle.
,

In the only game Sunday, unfortunately a loss, Rutgers (the top
seed in the tournament, ranked 14th
in the nation) played a tough zone
defense.

However, the Warmothers answered back with the unexpectedly
effective handler connection ofthe
weekend (Bader, Goldsmith and
Hourihan), solid handling by

Kruks-Wisner, power popping by
Sarah Knudsen '9B and Cathlin
Tully '9B and awesome wing cuts
by Hoedeman. In only her second
season, Tully's cuts and cool head
in both the zone and man-to-man
offenses enabled many upfield advances. An overall successful
weekend for the Warmother's, who
placed 4th of 12 teams, bodes well
for this weekend's Penn State tournament as well as upcoming
Sectionals and Regionals.

The doubles teams on Thursday

consisted of freshmen Jennifer

and Brown, and Flather and senior Elena Rosenbaum. Sophomores Sara Coe and Michaela De
Soucey played an exhibition
match and won 8-4. The team was
not positive about this match, but
they regrouped in time for Saturday and fought hard against
Ursinus, blanking them with a 90 win. The doubles lineup remained the same with wins of 83, 8-2, and 8-4 consecutively. At
singles, the lineup was the same
as against Western Maryland except Rosenbaum took over for #6
singles, and the scores in the
same order as before were #1 at
6-1, 6-7, 6-3; #2 at 4-6, 6-0, 6-0;
#3 at 6-2, 6-0; #4 at 6-2, 6-1; #5
at 6-1,6-0; and #6 at 6-4,6-2. As
of now the overall record for the
team is 5-2 for '9B and in conference they are 2-1. This Friday
the women will travel to Franklin
and Marshall and go up against
their team.
Last week the men's tennis
team played two matches at home
against Hartford and Emory.
They had a 6-1 victory over Division 1 Hartford and a close 4-3
loss to Emory, a highly ranked
Division 3 school. Over the
weekend the team travelled to
Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia to play in a tournament for top Division 3 schools.
In the first round of play they lost
to Denison 5-2, with wins from
Nick Slimack '99 at #2 and freshman Peter Schilla at #6. In the
consolation bracket on Saturday,
they played Wooster from Ohio
and won 6-1, despite Sasha
Sheenan 'OO being gone, John
Leary 'OO playing sick, and John
Temin 'OO playing with a shoulder strain. Slimack won at 2,
Leary at 3, Emkey at 4, Schilla
at 5, and Temin at 6. On the last
day of the tournament the team
played Kenyon College and came
out on top with a 6-1 lead. Coming up this weekend is an away
game in Massachusetts against
Williams College, and Peter says
that they are "hoping to beat them
for the first time in a few years."

Softball Drops Two to Gettysburg;
Picks up Win Against Ursinus
by Jean Quinn
Continuing to impress others with
their higher caliber play, the Garnet put up a strong fight against the
Gettysburg Bullets last Saturday,
but ended up dropping both games
in the conference doubleheader.
They rebounded quickly, however,
by pouncing on the Knights from
Beaver College and picked up a
much deserved victory. This
week's results takes the team to 311 overall, 0-4 in the conference.
Swat lost the first game to
Gettysburg 3-1. Mary Beth Alvarez
'9B and Heather Marandola 'Ol
each went one for three, and
Michelle Walsh '9B drove
Marandola
across the plate
on a triple.
Pitcher Dana

throughout the lineup."
Walsh said, "We proved that we
can play with one of the top teams
in the conference. We've got the
skills, now it's just a matter of getting a winning attitude. We have
such a young team, we're still making a lot of silly mistakes at important parts of the game. As the season goes on and the players get
more experience, we should be able
to eliminate most of those mistakes
and get a few more wins."
Jumping on Beaver College and
pulling a "come-from-behind" 6-4
win, the team got a victory in its
very next outing. Swat struck early
against a mediocre pitcher, scoring
a run in the first inning and leaving
many runners

In the second

Women's Rugby Leaves
Opponents Scoreless
by Danielle Thomas, Amber Halsey
and Rhiana Swartz
This Saturday Rutgers University took a beating at the hands of the Swarthmore Women's
rugby team. When the dust had settled on the
scorched earth of Dupont field the score was
41-0 in favor of the still undefeatedSwarthmore
team. Have we mentioned that no one has scored
on women's rugby all season?
The A side scoring frenzy began quickly with
back captain CourtneyClark '9B capitalizing off
the quick ball movement within the back line.
The backs continued to dominate their opponents as Cathy Vaughan 'Ol stepped into the
tryzone, adding to Swarthmore's lead. Not to
be outdone, the forwards quickly found their
rhythm on offense Sarah Cross '99 dove into
the tryzone, picking upanother 5 points. Noelle
"da money" Goodin 'OO scored her first try, and
tears fell on the Rutgers side. Since the ref decided that the Swarthmore scrum was too strong
for the feeble Rutgers pack, they expended their
energy pushing Bridget Arbour '9B over the

tryline. The fat lady started to sing when Meghan
Brennan 'OO racked up another one. By the time
Danielle D'Olivera 'OO touched the ball down
the cows had come home. Beth "My dad's here"
Wiles '9B sealed Rutger's coffin with her 3 conversion kicks.
The B-side team snatched their first victory
of the season 10-0. Nancy Craig 'Ol scored
the first try of the game, after Maz Moloto
'OO carried the ball and many Rutgers girls
for 20 yards. Holding the lead for Swat, Lynn
Matthews '9B pulled a D'Olivera, sprinting
the length of the field to score and extend the
lead to 10-0. Rutgers never got their groove
on, and the game was over before they knew
what hit them. This week the Halsey-ThomasSwartz "unawarded try" award goes to 8woman Alexa Miller 'OO.
This weekend the Swarthmore ruggers kick it
off by taking it off at 1:00 in Parrish. Parents
and construction workers welcome. Once they
find their clothing the women ruggers will spend
the weekend kicking butt and taking names in
the capital during Ruggerfest '9B.

This past weekend the women's
lacrosse team traveled to Vassar
College to compete in the Seven
Sisters Tournament. Swat began the
tournament Saturday morning with
a strong win against Sweet Briar
College. Eight different players
contributed goals to the 17-1 victory. Holly Baker, '99, lead with 5
goals and 1 assist. Later that afternoon, Swarthmore fell to rival
Haverford, 19-13. Baker led
Swarthmore with 6 goals and 1 assist. Haverford presented the Garnet with their first tough competition this season. It was a disappointing loss, but enabled the women to
learn a lot about their play and to
work on skills that needed to be fine
tuned to defeat a more skilled team
like Haverford.
Swat took the lessons they
learned Saturday afternoon and put
them to work as they defeated
Mount Holyoke College 18-4 on
Sunday morning claiming third
place in the tournament. Betsy
Rosenbaum, '9B, and Baker each
had 6 goals, while Alicia Googins,
'OO added 1 goal and 5 assists. "After our loss to Haverford, we really
pulled it together as a team to shut
down Mount Holyoke. Our connections in the mid-field from the
defensive to the offensive end were
beautiful. I felt like we were really
beginning to understand each
other's playing style and thus were
able to play well as a team" commented Katherine Wu '9B. Baker
and defender Sarah Singleton, '99
were named to the all tournament

in there and really executed our
short game with a lot of bunts. We
forced them to throw the ball
around and to make the plays." The
only real blemish on the week was
the loss ofright-fielder Amy White
'OO. White broke her ankle sliding
into third base at practice, and will
be out for the rest of the season as
she recovers from surgery. "She
was really starting to come along
offensively and was a staple in the
outfield," said Goetcheus. "She will
be missed."
The team has a very full schedule ahead of them, with six games
in four days. The squad travels to
Dickinson and Muhlenberg, Saturday and Tuesday respectively, and

will make up a rain delayed doubleheader against Drew Sunday at
homeiflt Ipm. "Dickinson has already beaten last year's conference
champion, Ursinus," saidAlvarez.
"Drew is a school with great sports
across the board, but we've always
played well against them. In fact,
we always played better against
better teams because they challenge
us with pitching and hitting."
Goetcheus said, "Muhlenberg is
experienced. They're disciplined
and they execute very well. They
like to run and will challenge us
from the first pitch. Their pitching
is probably the second best in the
conference behind Western
Maryland's."

Men's Lacrosse Loses to
Scranton and Drexel
by Pat Donaghy
The men's lacrosse team fell to 2-6
on the season following defeats against
Scranton and Drexel. The Garnet fought
tough to the final whistle in both games,
but could not overcome slow starts.
Against Scranton on Saturday, the Tide
played a poor first half and fell behind
7-1. The lone goal was scoredby Mark
Dingfield 'Ol, who was assisted by
Tucker Zengerle 'OO. Determined not
to give up, Swat then scored the next
three goals to cut the lead to 7-4, but
that would be as close as the Garnet
would get as the Royals poured in three
goals of their own. The fourth quarter
turned into a shootout as the Garnet
scored three more goals in two minutes
to cut the lead to 11-7, but it was too
little, too late, and Swarthmore was
defeated by a final score of 13-7.
Senior attackman Steve Shin scored
two goals, earning a spot on the conference honor roll. Dingfield finished

with three goals, while sophomore middies Marcus Shin and Toby Patterson
each added a goal in defeat.
As a warm-up for their tough conference schedule, the Garnet faced undefeated Drexel, ranked #24 in Division
I. Swarthmore proved ready for the
task, taking a 1-0 lead when Dingfield
ripped one past the Dragon goalie on a
feed from Patterson. The Dragons then
proceeded to score the next ten goals
before the Steve Shin finally broke the
scoring drought in the fourth quarter.
The Dragons would add one more goal
for the 11-2 final score. Goalie Sig
Rydquist 'OO had a stellar game in net,
notching 14 saves. "We played very
well for 60 minutes against one of the
best teams in the country, and that's all
I could ask frommy players," said coach
Gress afterwards. "Our intensity was
high throughout, but our offense has to
be more productive to win ." The Garnet open their conference schedule at
Western Maryland tomorrow.

Coming off of the tournament,
Swarthmore faced Johns Hopkins
in a Centennial Conference matchup on Tuesday. The garnet lost 153, with Baker, Rosenbaum, and
Googins all contributing 1 goal
apiece. The lopsided score does not
reflect Swarthmore's play.
Swarthmore played very well on
both attack and defense but had a
hard time protecting and taking
care of the ball on transitions.
Hopkins had a literal home field
advantage being accustomed to
playing on a turf field while it was
Swarthmore's first game on a turf
surface this season. "Like the game
against Haverford, I think Hopkins
taught us a lot about how to play
well together. We have a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to seeing us improve as a team throughout the season." commented Becca
Stites, 'OO. This was the last time
Swarthmore will face theBlue Jays,
as Hopkins is going Division I next
year.
Swarthmore hosts another Centennial Conference matchup
against Dickinson this Saturday at
1 p.m. Bring your parents out to
Cunningham field and support our
women's lacrosse team.
