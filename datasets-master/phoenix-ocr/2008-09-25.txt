Clothesline Project provides outlet for survivors again
BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore.edu

The Clothesline Project is on display
this week as a visual reminder of sexual
violence and of the support network available to survivors. T-shirts decorated by
both survivors and community members
otherwise personally impacted by sexual
violence currently hang on a clothesline
in front of Parrish, different color t-shirts
indicating different types of sexual violence.
The weeklong event began on Monday
night with a powerful opening ceremony
in which survivors either submitted or
read pieces about their personal experiences with sexual violence. This year the
shirts will hang until the closing ceremony on Thursday, Sept. 25.
Ally Grein 'lO, the organizer of this
year's Clothesline Project, said that survivors benefit from the sense of community conveyed by the array of shirts. "I hope
survivors are empowered by the fact that
they are not alone. In reading the other
shirts and attending the opening people
can see survivors at different stages of the
healing process, and it can be really comforting, I think, to know that there is a
proverbial light at the end of the tunnel,"
Grein said.
Students and other passersby who stop
to look at the t-shirts are often powerfully
impacted and confronted by the intensity
of the messages that the makers have conveyed.

"As a first year, I'd never seen [the
Clothesline Project] before, though I knew
the basic idea behind it. Seeing it was
pretty powerful
especially the contrast
between stories in which the survivors
are still damaged and then those in which
survivors persevere and find self determination," Dante Fuoco 'l2 said.
The Clothesline Project was launched
several years ago under the supervision of
Assistant Dean and Gender Education

Advisor Karen Henry 'B7. In its first few
years, the project was executed on a much

smaller scale and only intermittently.
However, in 2006, the project was revitalized by Veronica Lim 'O7, Nicole Belanger
'OB and Patrick Rock 'O9. Since then, the
organizers of the event have been working
to raise awareness about sexual violence
and strengthen support for the community
of survivors on campus.
"I am struck by how courageous the
survivors are. I'm struck by their ability
to talk about very painful experiences in
public," Henry said after witnessing the
opening ceremony and viewing the displayed t-shirts. According to Henry,
Counseling and Psychological Services as
well as the Deans Office are providing
additional services to students during this
emotionally charged week.
It did not take long for the Clothesline
Project to become embedded in campus
culture, undergoing a few notable changes
in recent years in the process. Last year,
the project moved from the spring to the
fall because the final semester of the year
is considered by many students to be the
most academically intense. Also, this year
the campus fraternities Delta Upsilon and
Phi Psi took responsibility for organizing
the hand print pledge, in which participants make m a symbolic commitment to
prevent sexual violence by leaving their
handprints on a sheet. The Clothesline
Project Planning Committee has traditionally organized the pledge, but this year
delegated the task to the two fraternities.
While the Clothesline Project's primary objective is to provide an outlet and
resource for the community of survivors,
Henry said that all students
regardless
of their experience with sexual violence
can benefit from the Project's attempt to
illuminate an issue that is not often discussed in such a public forum. "It's an
intense experience. People are sometimes
shocked when they see their fellow students and members of the community

Decorated t-shirts signify different kinds of sexual violence as a part of the Clothesline
Project, which have lined the front of Parrish Hall this week.
being affected by these issues. It's easier
to imagine those kind of things happening
to someone else, and not to Swarthmore
students," Henry said.
Although students who have not experienced sexual abuse may have difficulty
identifying with survivors, Grein stressed
the need for sensitivity to the community
of survivors during a week that is emotionally challenging for many students.
"I hope non-survivors realize the types

of issues facing some members of the
Swarthmore community
To become
more aware of these problems is the first
step in changing the often hostile culture
survivors face," Grein said.
According to Henry, increasing a community's awareness of sexual assault can
prevent future acts of violence. "It's
important to remember that these things
can happen to anybody. You have to take
good care of yourself," Henry.said.

MTV films and showcases new Harry Potter seminar
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

On Thursday, Sept. 18, Professor of English Literature
Melinda Finberg's first-year seminar "Battling Against
Voldemort" was filmed by MTV as part of a segment on the
phenomenon of Harry Potterbooks appearing in college curricula.
The class, which studies J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter
series in addition to a number of other related texts such as
J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Phillip Pullman's His
Dark Materials trilogy, attempts to "understand why we are
driven to invent stories about battling inhuman powers to
learn what it means to be human," according to its course
description. It was filmed as an example of the use of Harry
Potter in an English literature class. At other schools MTV
filmed the books being used in other academic disciplines
like Religion and History.
Only one cameraperson stayed in the room with the students while they discussed the fifth book of the series, Harry
Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. "The filming was as
smooth as could be," Finberg said.
While most students agreed that being filmed while participating in class was strange at first, they didn'tfeel that it
was a real disruption. "It was kind of awkward to begin
with, but once we really started our discussion it was good.
We had a really good class it was intense," Owen Masters
'l2 said.
While some were surprised that the college allowed MTV
to film on campus given the administration's reputation for
avoiding media attention, Vice President Maurice Eldridge

THE PHOENIX

'6l said that he 'tlidn'thave anything against the opportunity to display a lively intellectual pursuit to the wider world."
However, he did go on to say that "the impression that we
shy away [from media attention] is correct, we're very careful about that. We've been burned a couple of times over the
years
and our philosophy is fluid enough to surprise people," Eldridge said.
...

in an academic setting. "Had they consulted with
us we would have advised them to find a different way to get
that message across," Eldridge said. Although the matter
was brought to his attention after the fact, Eldridge said he
was not aware of anyone who had been made particularly
uncomfortable by the sign.
The students in the first-year seminar, despite an initial
awkwardness, had no complaints about being filmed. "The
students had to sign a release
I had told them about the
possibility that MTV would be filming us on the first day of
class, to make sure they were all comfortable with it, and
they were all very excited," Finberg said.
First-year seminars, which are designed to help introduce first-year students to college level courses, often facilitate this transition by featuring texts or subjects to which
students can easily relate, allowing them to better focus on
writing at the college level and carrying on meaningful discussions with their peers.
"Battling Against Voldemort," which Professor Finberg
taught last year as well, is very popular, and is consistently
lotteried. Asked about why she was interested in teaching
this course, Finberg said that "I've always been fascinated
by myths and why we feel we need to tell stories over and
over again." While she said that thefirst semester she taught
the class she was "very ambitious" and used a wide variety
of related texts, the course now focuses primarily on 20th
and 21st century myths, which enables the class to think
more easily about the socio-historic context of the Harry
Potter books.
"It's been great fun," Finberg said. "I think the students
have learned an awful lot."

McCain, Palin make campaign stop in Pa.
With the help of Joe Lieberman and others, the duo rallied more than 10,000 supporters on Monday
BY JEFF DAVIDSON
jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu

Republican presidential nominee John
McCain and vice-presidential nominee
Sarah Palin disembarked from the
Straight Talk Express campaign bus
Monday evening amidst the enthusiastic
cheers of supporters outside of the
Delaware County Courthouse in Media,
Pa.

The Secret Service estimated the
crowd at 10,000, but GOP officials placed
the figure closer to 15,000.

"John and I are the only
people in this election with
a track record of making
change happen not just
talking about it."
Sarah Palin
Republican VP Candidate
Area officials and community members alike opened the evening with
speeches, songs and performances. Most
speakers praised the great effects Palin
will have upon the party and the upcoming election; even in a prayer for McCain
and the Republicans, Father Ralph
Chieffo of St. Mary Magdalen in Media
said, "Thank you for your feminine gifts,
Sarah Palin."
The State Street Miracles, a collection
of community members with Downs
Syndrome and developmental disabilities,
introduced themselves to the audience
and sang two songs. Other locals continued entertaining the crowd for two hours
until at 5:45 p.m. when the suspense
music kicked in.
As the arrival of the Republican contenders neared, chants of "USA" spread

through the streets. When the bus pulled
up to the crowd and the group took the
stage, the excitement grew exponentially.

Connecticut Senator

Joe Lieberman,

Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Speoter and
congressional candidate Craig Williams,
challenging
who
is
incumbent
Democratic Representative Joe Sestak for
his 7th District seat, were among those
who spoke at the rally. McCain and Palin
passed through Media just six days after
Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe
Biden rallied in the same town.
Palin, backed by her family, took to the

stage after Lieberman endorsed her as "a
breath of fresh Alaska air." Dressed in the
customary red leather jacket, Palin
addressed the "Sar-ah"-chanting crowd.
Palin spoke of some of the strong desires
of the McCain campaign
such as government reform and energy independence.
"John and I are the only people in this
election with a track record of making
not just talking about
change happen
it, making it happen," Palin said. With an
particular intrest for students with special needs, Palin wants to fight for students and better education in the white
house.
Next she turned her speech against
Obama.
"Our opponent
he likes to point the
finger of blame, but tell me has he ever
lifted a finger to help?" Palin said. "Has
he ever reached out a reformers hand to
the other side of the aisle? In orders to get
others to say yes to change, has he «ver
told his own party 'no'? When it comes to
reform, he likes to say T will,' but has he
ever been able to say 'we did'?"
Later she introduced Vietnam Veteran
John Teutul and his two sons, Paul and
John Jr., who manufacture customized
motorcycles known as Orange County
Choppers.

The Teutuls presented McCain with a
custom-made motorcycle designed to
honor soldiers taken as prisoners of war
and those missing in action.

Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin greets a cheering crowd. Members of the
crowd held signs emblazoned with such slogans as "Lipstick Power" and "NObama."
Paul Teutul Jr., against a heavy metal
backdrop, introducedMcCain for the final
talk of the night.
In his opening remarks, McCain
emphasized the energizing effects of
Palin's presence on the Republican ticket.
"I can't wait until I introduce her to
Washington, D.C.," McCain said. "We're
going to reform, we're going to shake
things up, we're going to change the culture, my friends. Please note, she sparked
a fire that's going to sweep across this
country and take us to the White House
and change America, and that's what it's
all about."
McCain's speech emphasized the key
differences between his and Senator
Barack Obama's views.
Referring explicitly to the recent convulsions on Wall Street, McCain noted
that Obama, a week after the onset of the
financial crisis, had not yet recommended
a policy response. McCain also described
healthcare coverage as a private matter
that should remain in the hands of taxpayers, who he claimed should have the
freedom to make their own decisions
about the cost and extent of their personal coverage plans. The dominant theme of
the speech was McCain's desire for
change and reform in the United States

up came in support of McCain. Four
Swarthmore Students and one alum,
dressed in blue, broke the sea ofred shirts
and made their way towards the center of
the crowd where few other Obama supporters would go.
The protestors never interrupted
speeches, but simply came out to voice
their view.
"Initially we were with Obama supporters, but they were staying on the
peripheries
they weren't going into the
actual rally," Sarah Noble 10 said. "We
were a little perplexed by this because we
wanted to go in to hear what they wanted
to say and to protest; we wanted it to have
an effect."

"Let me offer a little advance warning

Thousands of supporters, many of

Nov. 4 approaches.

Hechler, Gibson call for end of harmful mining in lecture
BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Retired West Virginia Congressman Ken Hechler '35 returned
to Swarthmore College to give a double lecture with environmentalist Larry Gibson last Tuesday.
The combination of Hechler's political formality and Gibson's
grassroots passion for the environment enhanced the duo's call

for activism on behalf of the communities and ecosystems
harmed by mountain-top removal (MTR) coal mining in

Appalachia.
Engineering professor and co-chair of the college sustainability committee Carr Everbach brought the two men to campus to
raise awareness about the issue. "Although I'm on leave from
teaching this semester, I am still very involved in sustainability
issues and didn't want to pass up the chance," Everbach said.
MTR coal mining is a process by which coal companies harvest coal. "They blast the top off a mountain. The layers of coal
are like a layer cake, and they have to keep blasting the rocks and
the trees and the soil, and they dump that down into people's
yards down in the valleys, so it not only affects the landscape, it
has a serious effect on the people," said Hechler. Coal companies
view MTR mining as one of the cheapest ways to harvest coal.
But, as Hechler pointed out, "It's only cheap because they don't
consider the cost to the human beings that live below the moun-

tain."
In 1974, a Wyoming senator passed an amendment that legalized MTR mining. Hechler unsuccessfully rose in opposition to
the amendment then and has continued his campaign for mine
reforms in West Virginia ever since.
During his years of activism, he focused particularly on the
pollution produced by MTR, including waves of dust produced by
the blast and the sludgy liquid waste of coal production both of
which have detrimental effects on public health. "I'm coming
here today to tell you about the best kept secret the mining industry has about the deep Appalachia people, the forgotten people of
Appalachia," Gibson said in a preface to his lecture. And he was
true to his word.
Gibson lives on Kayford Mountain, one of the Appalachian
peaks affected by MTR. The lecture hall was lined with black and
white photographs of landscapes and members of his community
that were heavily affected by MTR. A photo of a small school
became the jumping off point for a story about 233 kids who
attend school just 250 feet from a coal preparation plant.
Many of the kids have to use inhalers, and five teachers have
died of cancer. Another photo of a young man served as part of
the lecture. "Look at this proud young man. Look at the hope in
his eyes. Do you see any hope in his eyes?" Gibson said, emphasizing the human cost of MTR.
The stories of impacted communities and the history of MTR
mining are those of environmental injustice. The areas in which
companies extract coal through MTR generally have some of the
lowest per-capita income, inadequately-funded and substandard
schools and poorly kept roads. Gibson recalled a childhood in a
three-room house with one light-bulb.
In addition to poverty, these people have to deal with polluted
drinking water and other harmful effects of MTR. Much of the
wealth generated by mining does not make it back into the state
of West Virginia, as many of the companies are located outside of
the state.
The West Virginian government offers few prospects for
change for its people. Coal companies contribute money to the
campaigns of the men and women who run for office in the state,
making the politicians beholden to the companies when they do
win.
A five-minute clip from the television program "Sixty
Minutes" showed during the lecture featured one such puppet
governor who nearly refused to acknowledge the problems facing
the people he was elected to represent.
Without the government to help him and his people, Gibson
encourages everyone he meets to speak out against the destruction of Kayford Mountain and the environmental injustice faced
by its residents. He spends about eight months of the year speaking to college students, church congregations, UN ambassadors,
and any other people willing to listen. His activism has gotten
him arrested nine times in the past eight years.
While he does not believe that others should necessarily risk
a criminal record in the process of defending the mountain, he
did offer several methods of advocacy for the Appalachia people:
writing to a presidential candidate to say that there is no such
thing as "clean coal," sending an editorial piece to a West
Virginian newspaper or simply donating money to Mr. Gibson so
that he can continue to travel and spread his story.
Hechler encouraged students to speak out against the harm
done to the mountain communities. "The objective here is to try
to get students here at Swarthmore [to be] the battering rams we
need [for] change," he said.

Live-stream panel focuses
on interfaith issues in U.S.

THIS WEEK IN PICTURES

BY JONATHAN EMONT

jemontl@swarthmore.edu

"Faith, Politics, & Society: Muslims
in America," an interfaith discussion
on the discrimination faced by
American Muslims, convened last
night in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
The event was brought to the
Swarthmore campus via live-stream
technology, and was a marked experiment
for WITF-TV
and
the
Pennsylvania
Human
Relations
Commission, the event's two main
sponsors. Billed as "An interfaith discussion of challenges facing Muslims
in America," the event opened with
remarks by Stephen A. Glassman, the
chairperson of the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission.

Mr.
Glassman
noted
"Pennsylvania is on the leading edge

In an attempt to escape the bubble, students took advantage of SEPTA'S free nighttime
Regional Rait service this past weekend,

Pennsylvania.
A constant theme of the night was

the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment fol-

lowing the events of September 11,200L
The keynote speaker, Imam Hendi, "a
Muslim Chaplain and Professor of
Comparative Religion at Georgetown
University, addressed America's post-

-9/11 worries about Islam.

Hendi said that as an American and
a Muslim, he was doubly hurt by the
attacks. Apologizing on behalf of all
Muslims, Hendi said that on
September 11, his faith was "attacked,
was kidnapped, was hijacked." He then
went on to discuss ways in which people of Muslim faith contribute to

America's culture and livelihood, saying that "11,000 Muslims serve in the
United States' armed forces" and that
even as early as the 1800s there had
been Muslims serving in the United
States government.

Students gathered in Kohtberg on Tuesday to discuss the creation of a documentary
about the Wade Browniands in Chester.

One of the main goals of the night,
and the panel discussion in particular,
was to distinguish between radical
Islam and its more moderate strains.
Studies have shown that American
Muslims tend to be more moderate in
their beliefs than their European and
Arabian counterparts, and this was
underscored in both a video that preceded the panel and in the discussion
itself.

some with nativist prejudice and fears.
Current discrimination against
Islam was often viewed in a historical
context, as a new wave of prejudice
against a different "Other" that, the
event's sponsors hoped, would one day
come to pass.
Shannon Powers, the Director of
Communications for the Human
Relations Commission, in briefing this
reporter via telephone, was particularly insistent on this point, saying that
"Muslims are just the latest group to
face this type of discrimination."

"We're hoping to defeat
the assumption that
certain people have less
of a right to be here
than anybody else."

Powers said that the two main goals
of her organization were to enforce
Pennsylvania laws relating to discrimination and to institute diversity education programs.
Saying
how
"thrilled" she was that Swarthmore
students and faculty were able to listen in on the discussion, Powers said
that Swarthmore was a "guinea pig"
for the possible airing of other such

events in this fashion.

become a model for future discussions,
as it makes events more accessible,

potentially

broadening the event's

audience base. It also allows livestream viewers to interact with the

panel members using questions submitted by e-mail, as many Swarthmore
students and faculty had the opportunity to do last night.
At Swarthmore, 15 students attended the event, with a couple of faculty
members rounding out the count.
Shilpa Boppana 'll said, "In our class-

Memorial held for late author David Foster Wallace
BY HAE-IN PARK
hpark6@swarthmore.edu
A memorial for the late author David Foster
Wallace, who committed suicide earlier this
month, was held on Friday, Sept. 19 in the Hicks
Mural Room. The memorial, organized by Josh
Cohen 'O9 and Eli Epstein-Deutsch 'lO, drew a
crowd of approximately twenty people, including
Chair of the English Literature Department Peter
J. Schmidt and several students.
The attendees toasted in honor of the author

and took turns reading excerpts from his work.
"We all read favorite pieces, including excerpts
from the mammoth novel 'lnfinite Jest' [1996], his
short stories in 'Brief Interviews with Hideous
Men' [1999], a commencement address he gave to
and excerpts
Kenyon College [May 21, 2005)]
from his 'Television and Fiction' essay in the
essay collection 'A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll
Never Do Again' [1997]," Schmidt said in an e...

mail.
As a prominent novelist, journalist and professor at Pomona College, Wallace was known for
incorporating irony into his work and for his
subtle commentary on the absence of authentic
communication in a culture dominated by an
impersonal media complex. His novel "Infinite
Jest" was included in Time's list of All-Time 100
Greatest Novels (1923-2006). '"lnfinite Jest' is a
long, beautiful novel which never ends
He
deals with every topic from dead cats and nuclear
disasters
to complex mathematics and the
influence of the media. They are all important
aspects, even if we don't agree with all of the
aspects," Epstein-Deutsch said.
"There was an attendee [at the memorial]
from outside the campus who had read it twice,
and we all thought it was cool," Cohen said.
According to Cohen, Swarthmore was an apt
venue for the memorial. "Swarthmore in Eli's
and my collective imagination was an ideal environment for this memorial, because of its
naivete," Cohen said. "We were glad to see people
attended the memorial, although it wasn't about
the numbers," Cohen said of the turnout.
Wallace's suicide stunned Swarthmore's liter...

...

ary community. "[Wallace] hung himself, which I

find disturbing," Epstein-Deutsch said, adding
that he has since revisited Wallace's writing for
insight into the tragic circumstances of his
death. "I have a tendency to go back to some of
his works and reread them in terms of his suicide," Epstein-Deutsch said.
Cohen noted that Wallace actually addressed
the issue of suicide in his commencement speech
at Kenyon College. "He said that people commit
suicide, or 'shoot themselves,' to shoot the mind
that is 'an excellent servant but a terrible master.'"
Wallace began the commencement address
with an anecdotal reference to a fish that did not
recognize that it was submerged in water. "The
capital-T Truth is about life before death. It is
about making it to 30, or maybe 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. It is about simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and
essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us,
that we have to keep reminding ourselves, over
and over: 'This is water, this is water,'" Wallace
said.

Jennifer Medeiros 'IL who was present at
Friday's memorial, suggested that Wallace may
have used fiction as an outlet to alleviate his own
loneliness.
"I once read an interview in which David
Foster Wallace spoke of existential loneliness in
the real world, and of how fiction had the power
to make him feel *un-alone intellectually, emotionally and spiritually,'" Medeiros said in an email, adding that the significant turnout at the
memorial "was a testament to [Wallace's] power
as a writer. He made us feel 'un-alone,'"
Medeiros said.
Wallace produced a diverse body of work, not
all of which was somber in tone, according to
Medeiros. She said that Wallace's story, "Asset,"
which appeared in a 1999 issue of The New
Yorker, "is one of his lightest, most fun pieces."
"It's easy to seek out and then dwell on the
darkness in David Foster Wallace's work. I don't
want to gloss over DFW's abundant and equally
moving fun stuff, because that's what kept me
turning page after page after page of Infinite Jest,
what kept me flipping to the endnotes and back
388 times.," Medeiros said.

Chester Neighborhood Bike Works kicks off
BY DYLON CHOW

dchowl@swarthmore.edu

Chester Neighborhood Bike Works, a
new program launched by Anna Baeth 'O9,
provides local youth with the opportunity
to learn about bike repair at the Chester
YWCA.
Volunteers take old donated bicycles
and work with youth in the community to
teach the mechanical skills needed to

repair bicycles.
After the participants learn bicycle
safety and bike repair, they receive their
own bicycles at the end of the training
period.

Baeth received a Lang Center Summer
Social Action Award (S2A2) to participate
in an unpaid internship with a non-profit
organization.

She chose Neighborhood Bike Works
(NBW), an organization in Philadelphia
that works with urban youth through
cycling. Motivated by the experience, she
decided to start a program in Chester,
similar to the one currently operating in

Philadelphia.

The program, Chester
Neighborhood Bike Works, is now a
branch of NBW.
Baeth described her project as a "nonprofit bike shop." Old bicycles are donated from various places in the community,
including Swarthmore. Because the program is still in an early phase of develop-

THE PHOENIX

ment, Baeth and a team of mechanics and
volunteers are working with adult participants for the time being.
However, Baeth said she hopes to gradually include younger participants

between the ages of 10 and sixteen. After
they have spent a minimum of 60 hours
working on the bicycles, each one will
receive a water bottle, a bike lock, a helmet and the bicycle that he or she
repaired.

Baeth said she is still looking for ways
to expand the program's reach.
With the help of various organizations
in the community, including the Bicycle
Coalition of Pennsylvania and the
Delaware Valley Bicycling Club, she
hopes to set up, later in the semester, an
earn-a-bike program for adults as well as
a series of classes on bicycle safety.
Baeth said that she is also exploring
the possibility of sponsoring bike rides
around Chester neighborhoods for families, in order to promote cycling as both
an inexpensive means of transportation
and a recreational activity.
Planned monthly events include a bike
sale, a bike tour of Chester, and a Secret
Santa program in which bikes will be distributed to families who cannot afford
them.

Lang
Debra Kardon-Brown,
Center's assistant director for student
programs, said that she is optimistic

According to Kardon-Brown, Baeth
possesses the "package of positive intent,
the careful acquisition of skills, and the
application of best practice in community
involvement not only to start a project but
to ensure its sustainability, so that the

Although Baeth is still hoping to expand

Qüb relocates
to new space
ADAM BORTNER
abortnerl@swarthmore.edu

Qiib, one of Swarthmore's two student-run cafes, has moved from
its former location in theKitao Gallery to Danawell Trailer, located
between Dana and Hallowell dorms. The cafe held a Free Sushi Night
last Friday as its first culinary event in the new space.
Qiib, pronounced exactly like the word 'tube," serves sushi and
bubble tea along with other East Asian delicacies. In contrast, the
Kitao Gallery, dedicated to retired art history professor T. Kaori
Kitao, is billed as a public space for student art. The student-run
gallery, which hosts up to seven exhibitionseach semester, was renovated in 2000. The gallery was not originally intended to be a cafe.
According to Qiib staff and board members, relocating to
Danawell trailer will alleviate the scheduling conflicts that affected
the cafe when it had to share space with the Kitao Gallery. "We just
had very different space needs, like we needed a pristine white
space and they needed somewhere to make rice," Lauren Stokes 'O9,
a member of theKitao Gallery Board, said. The Qiib leadership also
felt that there was a need for two different spaces to accommodate
the different needs of the cafe and gallery. "Kitao was really not suited for a food serving establishment," Qiib Manager Michael
Ticehurst 'll said.

"I am kind of disappointed about the location change. The Kitao Gallery was part of
the charm of Qub. I loved absorbing the
art every week."
Chloe Noonan 'lO
According to Kitao Gallery Board Secretary Kate Goertzen 'O9,
scheduling conflicts have posed a problem in the past. "Kitao and
Qub are both very busy and often needed to host events on the same
nights," Goertzen said. Stokes agreed that sharing space was problematic for both parties. "It was never intended for Qub and Kitao
to share the same space forever. It was seriously inconvenient for
both of us; we had to schedule events around each other," Stokes

said.
Students expressed a range of reactions to Qub's move. One student, Clarissa Skinner 'l2, said that the cafe's new location will
make it much more accessible to students. "Danawell trailer is
more convenient to several dorms whereas the Kitao Gallery was
not really convenient to any particular dorm," Skinner said. She
attended Qub's Free Sushi Night last Friday and enjoyed the
ambiance. "There were big, comfy pillows all over the floor among
scattered tables and people sitting in circles eating sushi and drinking bubble tea," Skinner said. Marie Rousseau 'l2 also attended the
cafe's Free Sushi Night last Friday. "I liked Qub because the food
was good and I met new people from other dorms. Overall, it was a
very satisfying experience," Rousseau said.
However, not all students viewed the change positively. Chloe
Noonan 'lO, a dedicated Qtib customer, said, "I am kind of disappointed about the location change. The Kitao Gallery was part of the
charm of Qiib. I loved absorbing the art every week." When asked
what she thought of the new location, Noonan said, "Danawell
Trailer lacks zazz. Life will become a desolate, cultureless ruin without Kitao weekly."
Another student, Joan Kim 'lO, was also turned off by the location change. "The Kitao Gallery is a cultured and classy space,
whereas I don't have any of the same memories associated with
Danawell Trailer," Kim said.
Despite mixed student reactions, both Qub and theKitao Gallery
plan to take advantage of the locale changes by taking their respective spaces in new directions.
"We now have our own space with a lot of options for development," Ticehurst said. Such development includes additions to the
permanent menu, the first of which is Thai Spring Rolls. Also, Qub
is now offering the option to reserve a private room and a meal for
groups of people at the cafe. "Qub provides a space to get away from
partying and enjoy a quiet cup of tea and sticky buns with friends,"
Ticehurst said. The cafe will now be open weekly on Thursday and
Friday evenings from 9:00 p.m. until 12:30 a.m.
The Kitao Gallery, with four new board members, is optimistic
about the gallery's future as an independent space. "Without having
to worry about scheduling around Qub, we are up for everything,"
Stokes said, adding that the gallery is currently accepting proposals
for student exhibitions of any nature.

Colleges move away from ACT, SAT testing
BY SARA RIMER
THE TECH (MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECH.)
(U-WIRE)
A commission convened by some of the
country's most influential college admissions officials is
recommending that colleges and universities move away
from their reliance on SAT and ACT scores and shift
toward admissions exams more closely tied to the high
school curriculum and achievement.
The commission's report, the culmination of a yearlong
study led by William R. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admis-

sions and financial aid at Harvard, comes amid growing
concerns that the frenzy over standardized college admissions tests is misshaping secondary education and feeding
a billion-dollar test-prep industry that encourages students to try to game the tests.
A growing number of colleges and universities, like
Bates College in Maine, Lawrence University in
Wisconsin, Wake Forest University in North Carolina and
Smith College in Massachusetts, have made the SAT and
ACT optional.
And the report concludes that more institutions could
make admissions decisions without requiring the SAT and

ing on high school courses that, based on evidence, will
prepare them well for college and also prepare them well
for the real world beyond college, instead of their spending
enormous amounts of time trying to game the SAT."
Mr. Fitzsimmons' group, which was convened by the
National Association for College Admission Counseling,
also expresses concerns "that test scores appear to calcify
differences based on class, race/ethnicity and parental
educational attainment."

"Society likes to think that the SAT
measures people's ability or merit,
but no one [could think] that standardized tests can be a measure of
someone's true worth or ability."
William R. Fitzsimmons
Harvard Dean of Admissions

ACT.

It encourages institutions to consider dropping admission test requirements unless they can prove that the benefits of such tests outweigh the negatives.
"It would be much better for the country," Mr.
Fitzsimmons said in an interview, "to have students focus-

"Society likes to think that the SAT measures people's
ability or merit," Mr. Fitzsimmons said. "But no one in college admissions who visits the range of secondary schools
we visit, and goes to the communities we visit
where
you see the contrast between opportunities and fancy suburbs and some of the high schools that aren't so fancy
can come away thinking that standardized tests can be a
measure of someone's true worth or ability."
Mr. Fitzsimmons said that at Harvard, high school
grades and the College Board's individual subject tests are
considered better predictors of college success than the
SAT, also administered by the College Board, or ACT, and
that the university is studying the use of standardized
tests in its admissions. He added that it was possible that
the university might eventually make such tests optional.
The admission counseling association gave the report
to The New York Times in advance of its official release at
its annual meeting in Seattle this week.
The report emphasizes academic research that suggests
that test preparation and coaching results in an increase of
20 to 30 points on the SAT, which it calls "a modest gain (on
the old 1600 scale)" that "is considerably less than the 100
point or more gains that are often accepted as convention-

al wisdom."

The report calls on admissions officials to be aware of
such differences and to ensure that differences not related
to a student's ability to succeed academically be "mitigated in the admission process."

Even so, the report acknowledges that test preparation
can raise scores, however modestly, and that students
without the financial resources to get such help may be
"penalized for lower test scores" in some admission and
scholarship cases.

Economic troubles chill the job Campaigns reach out
climate for recent graduates
BY JIM MYERS
ARIZONA DAILY WILDCANT (U.

BY CHRIS ALLRED
THE TECHNICIAN (NORTH CAROLINA
STATE)

(U-WIRE)
With economic worries
prevailing after bank buyouts and news
of falling stock values on Wall Street,
John Lapp, North Carolina State
University professor of economics, said it
will be more difficult for students to get
jobs after graduation.
"They will probably have to be pretty

realistic about what opportunities there
are or be less choosy than they would be
in more generous times," he said.
Lapp said the job climate will be especially difficult for those students in the
financial sector, like Cayla Jablonski, a
senior in business administration.
Jablonski said she is interested in
finance, but she is concerned she will
have to settle for a job in retail.
"It will be more competitive in the job
market, so more people will have to go to
grad school," Jablonski said.
She will try to get a job before considering graduate school, she said,
But she could also move into public
relations if there are no options for her
in finance.
Lapp said businesses will still be hiring new workers.
"Firms are always looking for new
blood," he said. "It'd be easy to overstate
this thing. There may be fewer jobs than
there were a couple years ago."
Banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms are likely to hire fewer people, Lapp said, and these are some of the
traditional routes for people in the
College of Management.
"There's surely going to be less activity in those fields than there has been in
the recent past," he said.

But when firms are worried about
their finances, Lapp said, they are more
reluctant to take on new employees, so

THE PHOENIX

hiring rates will be lower.
The banking crisis, in which the government has begun bailing out large
investment banks to help secure the mar-

ket, has made investors "scared stiff," but
Lapp said people should not immediately

worry about the stock market.
"One thing to keep in mind is that by
its very nature, the stock market tends to
go up and down a lot more on a daily

basis than it moves on a monthly or
annual basis," he said. "There's an awful
lot of sound and fury that doesn't mean
much."
David Vanpelt, a senior in mechanical
engineering, has a part-time job with the
Department of Transportation, and said
he is not concerned about job prospects
because of his fields of interest.
"Considering I'm looking into energy
production and resources and government jobs, it's going to be pretty secure
lines of work," he said. "There's a very
vastly growing need for energy engineers. There are almost definitely going
to be spots open in my field, so I'm not too
worried about getting a job or having
financial difficulties for too long after
college."

Students will need to prepare earlier
in their search for jobs, Lapp said,
because of the availability of jobs.
David Nussman, a senior in finance,
said he had planned to return to his
hometown of Charlotte after graduation
to try to work for Bank of America, but
with the current banking situation, competition may be too heavy for that.
"It's going to be so competitive that
you've got to have second options and
apply to a wide variety of places, kind of
like applying to college," he said. "[You]
have to have a fallback plan."
Vanpelt and Nussman said they started internships the summer before their
senior years, and emphasized the need to
meet people with job opportunities.

(U-WIRE)

In a time when citizens

rely on the Internet for information more
than ever before, politicians are increasingly using it to promote their campaigns.
As politicians drive to reel in the youth
vote as the November elections draw closer, campaigns are progressively relying on
different media to reach younger voters,
most of all the Internet.
Democratic and Republican candidates

on the local and national levels are all
employing advertising in "new media"

forums, including blogs, YouTube and
Facebook.
"It's a lot easier to get on Facebook and
check out what's going on with your candidate than it is to wade through all the talk
shows on TV," said Adam Bennett, a psychology sophomore. "Personally, I think it's
a good way for candidates to advertise
themselves."
At the presidential level, the Facebook
pages of presidential candidates John
McCain and Barack Obama contain the
normal information categories, such as
age, previous work experience and favorite
television shows (McCain: "24" and
"Seinfeld," Obama: "SportsCenter"). Both
feature links to campaign Web sites and
videos, as well as updates on recent activities.
Beyond their initial similarities, the
Facebook pages of Obama and McCain differ in both number of supporters and additional features. McCain's page lists approximately 535,000 supporters, while Obama's
Facebook supporters number approximately 1,891,000. McCain's page also includes a
link to the McCain campaign blog, as well
as information about filling out absentee
ballots.
Local Tucson politicians are also utilizing Facebook to a lesser degree, with

Giffords claiming 816 online supporters to
Republican challenger Tim Bee's 89. Both

candidates' pages feature less personal
information and fewer external links than
their presidential counterparts. "The
Internet is a good way for people to gain
initial awareness about a candidate," said
Tim George, a mechanical engineering senior. "But beyond that, more traditional
campaign methods will show you what
they actually stand for."
Traditional forms of advertising, such
as television campaign ads, are also being
heavily transferred to the Internet.
Obama's latest television ad, titled
"Promise," has garnered 12,749 views on
YouTube since it was released five days

ago.

"Personally, I think
[Facebook Is] a good way
for candidates to advertise themselves."
Adam Bennett
Non-politician-endorsed ads, such as a
pro-McCain video on YouTube entitled
"Dear Mr. Obama," which has garnered
8,929,490 views in the three weeks since it
was released, are also speculated to play a
role in the outcome of the election.
Local Tucson politicians' television ads
are also showing up on YouTube, although
the trend shows negative campaigning
receiving more attention. The anti-Tim Bee
ad, titled "Tim Bee and George W: Another
Bee in the Hive," has gathered 1,056 views,
while the video for his official campaign
ad, "Tim Bee: Advocate Against Domestic
Violence," received only 234 views.
"I think the Internet campaigning has
made college voters more educated, for
sure," said Bryce Taylor, an undeclared
freshman. "Will that translate into people
actually going to vote though? I guess we'll

see.

I should probably start this column by
saying that I enjoy intellectual pursuits
just as much as the next Swattie. I read
Dostoevsky for fun, I strain to understand
the symbolism of Bergman's "The Seventh
Seal" and I will talk to my friends about
the political concerns that underlie the distinction between a language and a dialect
until their brains turn to mush. I'm not

ashamed of any of these things; on the con-

trary I am quite content to let my nerd
flag fly.

Some people, after reading the previous paragraph, might find it difficult to
understand why I wouldwatch something
that has been described as "over-the-top
escapism" (by the "New Yorker," a publication that can itself be seen as a form of
escapism for heady intellectuals) or, more
bluntly, as 'la nasty piece of work" by, of
all publications, the "New York Post." I'm
not denying that I revel in the escapism
and trash of "Gossip Girl;" I love watching beautiful people hook up with each
other and the constant stream of designer
clothes, shoes and handbags brings out
my inner fashionista. "Gossip Girl" also
has the advantage of writers who consistently turn out witty, savage and wonderfully unrealistic dialogue and actors who
make that dialogue seem like a natural
outgrowth of their characters.
"Gossip Girl," however, is more than
just a fun, trashy and well-written escape
from the enormous and seemingly insurmountable quantities of work that are a
fact of life at Swat; it is a show that speaks

compellingly about the problems that face
any high-school student, regardless of zip
code. If you take away the designer fashions, luxury apartments and fairy-tale
bars that never appear to card anyone, you
are left with a group of real, complex
human beings who are just struggling to

A day in the life (and wardrobe), remixed

swarthmorephoenix.com

When

I joined

the wardrobe_remix
group on flickr back

in the Spring of
2007, there were
around
already
3,000 members. In
the year since then,
the
has
group
exploded, thanks to

word-of-mouth

press from bloggers
and various magazines like "BUST,"
which had an arti-

cle that showcased

count has more

than
to
lO,OOO, and there are
now over 60,000 pictures in the group's photostream, as well as almost 800
threads in the discussion forum. The increase in size means
that you're far more likely to randomly run into a fellow
remixer on the street, or even not so randomly due to the
many organized meet-ups in cities all across the country.
So what exactly is wardrobe_remix? It's a do-it-yourself
personal style online community that was started in
September 2005 by Tricia Royale (username: bitsandbobbins). The process is simple: you take a picture of yourself
in whatever outfit you have on that day, and post it to the
group via flickr. Other members can view your pictures

MING CAI

and comment on them. The effect is like a keeping a style
diary/journal so that you can see what you wore from day
to day. Some post daily, and others, like myself, not so often.
Besides just being a nice idea, the utility of the group is
you feel some sense of commitment to getting
twofold
dressed to fit your own personal style in the morning, while
at the same time gaining inspiration in getting dressed by
the posts from the thousands of other members.
Of course, after a few years, the group size isn't the only

thing that's changed. There are still a few restrictions on
posting: no multi-photo collage shots, head-to-toe shots only,
and a limit of 2 posts a day. The newest rule is that you must
be over 16 to join and post, which keeps the group at a
smaller size than it could be potentially. The most dramatic change, however, may be in the photos that members
actually post.
When I first joined, I wasn't so concerned with getting
"great shots". I took photos of my outfits to show what I was
wearing, but I didn't put much effort into making the photos themselves aesthetically pleasing with nice backgrounds and lighting. I'm not sure if this is new in the
group's info, or if it was always there and I just never

noticed it, but it suggests that members should use hellooks.com, a Swedish street fashion website, as a reference
point for how their photos should look. While I am consistently impressed with the almost professional/semi-professional nature of the photos now being posted to
wardrobe_remix, I wonder if this is putting too much
emphasis on the photography skills of the poster. The thing
that I had always liked about wardrobe_remix was that it
was just you and your clothes, with no need for a photographer in between and that's what made it different from
street fashion blogs and sites that pick out what they think
is most "stylish".

COLLEGE DAY 2008
Saturday,
Campus
This
Philly* a non-profit organization
connecting
focused
on
Philadelphia area college students to the resources of the city,
will host College Day to welcome

students from all over the area
hack to school. With free admission to 11 museums with a college I.D. and a kick-off concert
featuring bands Armor for Sleep
and the Cool Kids, College Day is
expected to bring approximately
15,000 students out to explore the
City of Brotherly Love.
Busses will run from theBen
West Parking Lot to the Ben
Franklin Parkway starting at
9:30 am. with the last bus to
Swarthmore departing from
Philadelphia at 7 p.m.
Museums open their doors at
10 a.m. and student admission
will be free with a valid ED until
5 p.m. Participating art museums include the Philadelphia
Museum of Art, the Rodin
Museum, the Pennsylvania
Academy of the Fine Arts, the
Galleries at Moore College of Art
and Design and the Institute of
Contemporary
Art at the
University of Pennsylvania.
Two science museums will
also participate in College Day:
the Academy of Natural Sciences
and the Franklin. The Academy
of Natural Sciences is popular
for its butterfly room, where visitors can walk through an indoor
garden filled with approximately 100 butterflies, as well as for its
dinosaur exhibit, where visitors
can see assembled dinosaur
skeletons and dust for fossils.
Favorites from theFranklin (formerly the Franklin Institute)
include the Giant Walk-Through

12

Heart exhibit, the train room
and the Tuttleman IMAX theater.

The National Constitution
Center, featured in the movie
"National Treasure," has an
interactive exhibit that allows
visitors to take the Presidential
Oath-of-Office and frequently
features its own Ben Franklin
and Betsy Ross impersonators,
who, ironically enough, got married last July 4. The Eastern
State Penitentiary, popular for
its nighttime tours during the
Halloween season, will be open
for daytime tours so that visitors
have the chance to see the former prison that once held Al
Capone.

Other College Day museums
include the University of
Pennsylvania
Museum
of
Archaeology and Anthropology,
currently hosting exhibits on
evolution and the Lenape tribe
and the Free Library of
Philadelphia Central Branch.
Bands will begin playing on
the Ben Franklin Parkway at 3
p.m. and will continue until 7
p.m. The mam stage will feature
tNew Jersey alternative band
Armor for Sleep, the Chicago
hip-hop group The Cool Kids,and
the Philadelphia indie band
Twelve Twenty. The local music
stage will showcase three bands
nominated by local magazines
and radio stations: the Victor
Victor Band, Robes and Patty
Crash.
In addition to the music and
museums, College Day will also
include a non-profit Involvement
Fair, a skateboarding demo, tons
of freebies and more.

Still, the group is extremely community oriented, and
founder Royale makes it clear that it is not a ranking
community. Even so, Royale has started a separate
“wardrobe_remixers of the week” section on her website
bitsandbobbins.com where she showcases her favorite
outfits of the week. This may seem a bit counter to the
non-ranking mentality, but I personally love it, as it
gives me an update on who's posting what in the group
when I don't have time to sift through thousands of pictures a week. It's also hard to break the non-ranking
mentality when it is also clear that some members
receive far more attention than others. There are some,
like the lovely Liebemarlene (Rhiannon Leifheit) who
have exploded in popularity thanks to wardrobe_remix.
Her blog receives thousands of visits a day, she has a successful vintage ebay store, and has been featured in
heavyweight fashion magazines like Marie Claire.
So is wardrobe_remix just going to keep expanding or
will it outgrow itself? While some of the most popular
wardrobe_remix veterans have now expanded their
resumes to blogging and mentions on all sorts of websites and magazines, they have at the same time stopped
posting or posting as frequently to the w_r pool. The
more well-known members now post exclusively to their
blogs, so I tend to check those rather than the w_r pool.
As much as I loved looking through the wardrobe_remix
photo pool, especially when I found someone new whose
style I absolutely adored, looking at individual fashion
blogs has given me a much greater source of inspiration.
It's more personal, less time-consuming, and just a little
bit easier. Call me old-fashioned, but I still think less is
more.

are remarkably tight game packages that let you move off
of the rhythm rails a bit and encourage you to freeform
jam to earn greater acclaim in game levels. [6] Even
"Space Channel 5," which places you as a pink-haired
dancing reporter who saves the universe, manages to be
compelling by using rhythm for everything from shooting
funky aliens to rescuing space-tourists to engaging in a
colorful guitar battle far more fun than anything "Hero"
can offer. As it stands, I'd really rather do some air guitar
to my Dad's old Zeppelin records than pretend at being a
"Hero."

Footnotes
[l] It doesn’t help my nerves much that we have an

actual “Guitar Hero” in our midst.

[2] You could also spend all the time playing “Grand
Theft Auto IV” at the firing range so you can learn to

some hookers. This line of criticism
misunderstands gaming completely.
[3] See, Swat “Guitar Hero,” you have charisma! I mean,
if you can play “Hero” with your feet, you fucking
deserve $B,OOO. Okay, my nervous pandering ends now.
[4] Though neither preexisting dance skills nor a lack
thereof are a reliable predictor of your initial success at
“DDR.” I used to try to impress a bunch of Bth grade
musical theater girls with my impeccable ability at the
basic levels of said game. Unable to comprehend how a
pudgy middle-schooler was able to beat them at what
was allegedly a dancing competition, they thought I was
cheating heavily to make them look bad. This did not
score me a date.
[s] I guess you can contrast this with party favorite
“Super Smash Brothers” and its associated sequels (SSB
Melee/Brawl/Fisticuffs), where at times I’m almost convinced that bashing my skull enthusiastically into the
game controller causes my byte-sized marketing idbl to
be equally as lethal as those controlled by friends who
spend hours upon hours trying to master a particular
character. I’m a little sick of this game too, to be fair.
[6] I have a gut feeling that “Hero” fails here because it
misses out on employing a feature that cartoon animals
had available to them years ago. When you fail in
“Guitar Hero,” you fail like hell, whereas if you deviate
from a set in real life, it can be manageable or even
innovative. “Parappa” and “Lammy” both realize this,
“Hero” doesn’t.
really blow away

to

remind me of a
guitar for the
privilege of hearing sub-par 'Bos band covers. I can hear
those friends now, "Jack, dudebroman, why do you have
to be so lame all the time? 'Guitar Hero' is all metal as
hell." (Thanks for the input, imaginary friends.) Mine is
not in any respect a popular opinion, as evidenced by the
over $1 billion in revenues garnered by the franchise thus
far. [l] However, please indulge me and consider this a
shout-out to the few of you out there who just don't get it,
those of us who would rather give a sponge bath to each
and every decrepit, drugged-out member of Guns N' Roses
than spend another minute pretending to be a "Hero."
Perhaps surprisingly, my issue with the game isn't
even the most banal cliche attached to "Guitar Hero" criticism, that Johnny McGamer could spend all the time
learning to play the on-rails plastic guitar to, y'know,
become an actual musician. [2] Deeper complaint: "Guitar
Hero" is at worst a sub-par (if novel) derivative of the
rhythm gaming genre, at best a game that reaches its maximum potential only when played by someone with
enough charisma and/or ego to transform pressing buttons into a performance piece. [3]
Let's back off a moment from that assertion. I guess I
should explain "Guitar Hero" to those in the reading
audience who aren't acquainted with any garage band
rock star wannabees. (Yes, I know GBRSWs do not nearly encompass the "Guitar Hero" playing population, but
I'll be damned if Swarthmore wins Radar Magazine's
"most insufferable" award again, so I'd like to make a
ridiculous statement here and there.) The basic task of
"Guitar Hero" is simple: you, the "Hero" hopeful, must
press a number ofcolored buttons at the same time you
strum a toggle meant to simulate strings in beat with
matching colored dots. If you succeed at this task, you
are treated to a mediocre cover band playing whatever
song you have selected (with a few exceptions to the
"cover band" caveat); if you fail, you are subjected to an
awful cacophony of noises in the middle of said cover to
inform you that You're Doing It Wrong. At its core, it's a
basic rhythm game defined by its adherence to a specialized controller that you have to train on in order to succeed at receiving your cover song. However, the mechanical concept of the game differs from that of say, "Dance
Dance Revolution," where you'll be damned if your outof-shape ass doesn't have to develop not merely rhythm
but also some modicum of actual athletic prowess and
whole-body coordination to ascend the arrow-pressing
hierarchy. [4] More importantly, though, helping to
develop a sense of rhythm (possession of which I would
actually argue is a requisite for playing the game at all,
much less enough to learn from it) might make the game
instructional, but it does not make it fun.
Admittedly, while I can't personally appreciate the
draw of playing the game, that isn't to say I can't imagine it in the abstract. The first time I tapped along to Sum
41's "Fat Lip," I felt mildly entertained, a slight twinge of
glee in thinking that, hey, I'm playing that song! The
spirit of the game is in part to make you feel as though
you are mastering the music by mastering the series of
increasingly
difficult
button
combinations.
Nevertheless, however difficultthe button combinations,
it's still the same cover, and this is what began to kill the
magic for me. Song after song, there wasn't much sustaining me in my quest to train myself at more and more
button combinations, and the lack of incentive to try to

THE PHOENIX

memorize and execute the most difficult "sets" (except
for weird niche gamer cred) left my interest sagging.
"Well," my imaginary friend would say, "The multiplayer saves it, because it's awesome at parties!" Maybe,
but then again there really isn't much that isn't potentially fun when you're drunk enough. Otherwise, at least in
my (sober) experience, a solid hierarchy of dominance
develops in multiplayer that makes any hopes at engaging
competition between dueling faux-guitarists disappear
fast when you realize that who wins and who loses basically boils down to who owns and/or is obsessed with the
game. [s] It's skill, but just as in single player mode, the
don't seem to be any intrinsic rewards to this skill; it's not
a fighting game where your increasing mastery of there
game is reflected in your corresponding ability to elegantly decimate your friends and foes alike. It's hard to put my
finger on, but there's no visceral feedback to this sort of
competition, no gripping illusion of improvement apart
from the increase of dots on the screen.

My boss beef is simple. "Guitar
Hero" is boring.
To be perfectly blunt, aside from pricing concerns
(which may answer my question entirely), I'm not even
sure why "Guitar Hero" still sells when its competitor
musical imagination aid "Rock Band" includes not only
the guitar but drums and vocals as well. Furthermore,
whereas "Hero" multiplayer is lame, "Rock Band" manages multiplayer coherence through the cooperative
mode, where players each contribute a musical track to
see a given song to completion. Feeling like a fake band
rather than a fake guitar guru is somehow more satisfying
to me. Pretty much the only time when playing multiplayer "Guitar Hero" became engaging was when my
friends began to compete amongst themselves as to who
could be the bigger jackass while playing "Freebird." I'd
be skeptical to ascribe any of this fun to the game itself.
I'm going to nerdwank a bit here and preach to a choir

I'm doubtful even exists: if you are one of the few (?) who
aren't enamored with "Guitar Hero," there are numerous
other entries in the rhythm-gaming genre that prove it
has a right to exist. Early-generation rhythm games

A convenient truth Irrational thoughts on impossible bodies
In my last column, I
discussed many things,
ranging from different
reasons to be honest to the
extent
the
Hadron
Collider will change scientific knowledge as we
understand it. I will focus
more on the former in this
column (sorry), in which I
will discuss Truth in general. I was re-reading my
column several times,
mostly for egotistical rea-

GABRIEL ZACARIAS
Truth or Perfidy

sons, when I realized my
next column would logically present more arguments in favor of the

truth. For all my lambast-

ing of lies and snide comments regarding deception, I have yet to present
the truth as something

truly desirable.Let's see what I can do
the easiest argument first.
If you have a brand spanking new, amazing haircut, wouldn't you
want to know? Better yet, wouldn't you want to know thatwhen people
said, "You have an amazing haircut," they actually meant it?
Compliments are always nice, especially if you delude yourself into
believing they're always truthful (guilty), but compliments you know
are honest seem better somehow. It might just be me, but the knowledge
that someone is not lying to me when they are saying something nice
warms my soul like I have meningitis, but then I realize I don't have a

stiff neck, if you know what I mean.
There is at least a simple argument in favor of the Truth: compliments will be maximally "good-feeling-giving," which is nice. Now consider the opposite of compliments those evil things called insults, or
as I like to call them: "Love salt." Allow me to explain. People who navigate this world alongside me are split into two categories: people I care
about and people I don't. This is a great model, in case you were wondering. Imagine that someone said that your outfit was reminiscent of
the great Orangutan Polka Dots/Horizontal Stripes fracas of '72, clearly
not intended to be a compliment. This person is clearly not a fan of your
commercialized Che Guevara shirt with American Eagle shorts and
New Balance sandals. Now let's fit them into our model.
We need to fit this person into our dichotomy, so we'll use different
names for each type of person. Judgmental Jennifer is a person I don't
care about. Whether it is her personality, her body odor, her musical
tastes does not matter (the reasons I like and don't like people are both
voluminous enough to fill books, or at least pamphlets, and at the same
time is likely uninteresting to everyone except Ken Jennings and
Google, who would review it for indexing purposes only); what matters
is that I don't care about her. Thus this Judgmental Jennifer's comment
is easily dismissed, caroming off my shield designed specifically to deal
with unhelpful comments from people I don't care about. So truth certainly did not hurt me; it really just did nothing, which is definitely no
less than a neutral. It is quite different for Jolly Julie.
Jolly Julie is someone I do care about, and is quite pleasant overall.
While Julie might not reference 1972, she would certainly say something
if she thought my clothes were horrendous. Here is a crucial advantage
of the Truth: If Julie were consistent, she would always say comments
of a given nature the same way. In other words, she might be gentle,
caustic, loud, quiet, etc. when it comes to things she thinks the other
person might not want to hear. However, since I care about her, I have
come to accept that this is how Julie is and appreciate it, not ask her to
change.

Julie is a wonderful presence in that I know exactly how she feels
and exactly how she chooses to express it. Even when it comes to the

hard Truths, I'll know the general style in which she will communicate
them, and I'll know that I can listen to them. I might hear things from
Judgmental Jennifer, but I'll listen to things that Jolly Julie says, good
or bad. Allow me an anecdote. The vast minority of people at this school
understands this dynamic of the Truth, and thus I have taken it upon
myself to model the way. Those who know me know that I usually say
exactly what I want to, drawing upon the nebulous and frightening entity known as my mind. This is quite polarizing to people, and if you have
ever been with me the first timeI've met someone (I call it "initiation"),
you know it alienates a lot of people. It doesn't scare away everybody,
and the people who stick around usually become at the least a good
friend and at the most my best friend.
My point is simple: always be truthful. It not only allows you to put
greater faith in the things people say but also allows you to know other
people. The harsh truths are easier to handle if you know that a) you
like the person and b) you like his or her communication style. I won't
go so far as to say the world will be a happier place, but darn it all, it will
be a more honest place and words might have meaning again. Take that
sarcasm. Take that in your ugly face.

Student Special and late-night 30 Rock marathons).
The problem is, usually, not the general desire to be
thinner. I say "usually" here very purposefully. This
column is not meant to advise readers who have gone
above and beyond unhealthy eating. I wish to emphasize this point early on: if you or a friend has an eating disorder, my experience and advice are limited
and amateur at best.
That being said, the problem is not in the desire to
be thin; the problem is in the way we approach this
problem and therefore its solution. The problem, in a
word, is irrationality. Irrationality takes a desire to
change your body and turns it into a painful experience that can make you feel the worst about yourself.
Blame my economics major, but I feel that "irrationality" sums up quite succinctly the major problem many people run into when viewing their body
and trying to make changes to it. The take home lesson from economic theory is this: Rational people
behave in ways that improve their well-being.
Irrational people, prompted by irrational thoughts,
behave in ways that harm them. Of course, I couldbe
totally wrong and put my professor to shame when
Lorenz Goette denies me my honors in the spring,
but it's from this understanding that I am going to
proceed.
Irrational Expectations
There are two main types of irrational thought
that will bring you down when viewing your body or
trying to lose weight. The first revolves around the
sort of body you wish to achieve. While it's all well
and good to have a pair of "skinny jeans" you'd like
to fit back into, it's not okay to have a bathing suit
you want to fit back into...that you first bought when
you were fifteen. If the weight gain you're fighting
against is due to puberty, I'd like to point something
out that took me years to accept, but is absolutely
necessary to understand: Women and girls look different (also, the obvious corollary: Men and boys
look different). As you get older, you are supposed to
get wider hips, a larger ass, and an overall filled-out
frame. And this change doesn't stop with the first
years of puberty
with some people it can keep
going until they're 20. The expectation that at 18 you
should or could look like what you did at 15 is irrational and counter-productive, so stop it.
You also won't look like a model, so stop using
that girl from "Glamour" as your motivation. Her job
is to be thin. She is paid to sacrifice whatever she
needs to look like that, and she's airbrushed on top of
it. If you need to tell yourself that she's probably not
as smart as you or as good at Rock Band to make
yourself feel better, that's fine (and probably true),
but the reality is this: That model is not you. Stop trying to be her. You are you and she is she and she was
born with a certain frame and metabolism that you
don't have. That's okay. You shouldn't be trying to be
her; you should be trying to be the healthiest and
happiest you that you can be.
September 25, 2008

The second type of irrational thinking centers not
on your goals for weight-loss, but on how you expect
the process to be. Let me put it simply: This will not
be quick and this will not be easy. Changes in your
body happen gradually. The process of getting thinner or rather, preferably, healthier takes energy
and time. It involves going to the gym regularly, it
involves eating better, it involves learning about
nutrition, it involves self-control including some
sacrifice of beloved but bedeviling foods and the cessation of (my favorite pastime) eating your feelings.
Any diet that tells you that you won't have to give
anything up, any magazine that tells you that you'll
lose 10 pounds this week, and any low-fat food that
tells you that you won't even notice the difference is
lying. Also, sometimes you're going to deviate from
the path you outline for yourself. It's called being
human. Take your time and be patient with yourself.
Irrational Behavior
These irrational expectations combine to lead to
the most common and most destructive irrational
behavior in the weight-loss world: yo-yo dieting. All
of those expectations put an ordinate amount of pressure on a person. If you expect to look like your prepubescent self or Giselle in two weeks while eating
Sharpies cake daily, your weight loss plan will fail. It
will lead to the following: Today you tell yourself you
will eat only salad, because you're not as skinny as
you want to be yet so if a little bit of salad is good a
lot a bit of salad must be even better. Though feeling
a little faint, you make it through the day, only to end
up in your room at 1% after Sharpies is closed, starving out of your mind. You end up consuming the
whole family-sized bag ofDoritos you bought for seminar break, along with 2000 calories and 500% of your
daily sodium. You feel like crap about yourself for not
having self-control and you feel kind of sick because
the nacho cheesiness was a bit much. The next day
you figure that since you already messed up you
might as well give up because you're not going to
ever make it. Two days later you're punishing yourselffor those two days by eating only red vegetables.
And so on.

Irrationality takes a desire to
change your body and turns it
into a painful experience that
can make you feel the worst
about yourself.
This is not maximizing your well-being, physically or emotionally. If you're too hard on yourself and
have irrational expectations for how you should look
or how fast you should lose weight, you're going to
end up feeling like crap every day, at every meal,
every time you look in the mirror. Rational goals
being healthy as opposed to skinny
and rational
say, losing a pound a week or having
expectations
will lead to rational
only one cookie for dessert
behavior. I don't have enough space to cover this
week what healthy behavior is, but the traps I laid
out above are common. Don't fall into them. It's easier to be irrational, but destructive in the long term.
Please remember that life is complicated and so is
healthy living.
On a side note, I received an overwhelming
response to my column last week and am considering
having a meeting with other people interested in
body image and related issues. If you're interested,
please send me an email. I also want to note that I
absolutely want to hear and understand more about
men with body image and eating issues. My columns
focus mainly on women because I know about
women's gendered experiences with these issues.
That being said, I know these issues exist among men
as well and don't want to make anyone feel alienated
by my column. All feedback is always encouraged;
please feel free to contact me about future topics
you'd like to see covered or anything else.

Middle class families bear the brunt of rising college prices
How the desire for equality in education has made paying for college more challenging for many middle class families
In recent decades, it seems to have become the mission
ofAmerican institutions of higher education to incorporate
lower-class students into the world of college education.
Particularly at liberal arts colleges, administrators must
work to present their schools as something more than an
expensive, esoteric luxury.
The traditional exclusion of the lower class from the
higher education process has created a chasm within
American society: both occupationally and socially, there is
a growing divide between those with post-secondary
degrees and those without. The perennial question faced by
the administrations of colleges and universities, including
Swarthmore's, is how to address this problem.
Fortunately, colleges and the government have become
old hands at attacking this issue, and the proposed solutions to the exclusion problem have been as myriad as its
root causes. To remedy systemic inequality of opportunity
within some minority groups (which overwhelmingly correspond to lower economic classes), the Supreme Court
sanctioned affirmative action in higher education in 1978.
To make the prospect of attending private colleges and universities more appealing to first-generation and minority
college students, many elite schools have extensive outreach programs, such as Swarthmore's Discovery
Weekend. And most importantly, to make college more
affordable for low-income families, the federal government
and educational institutions have collaborated to create a
vast network of private and public financial aid and scholarship programs.
While not a panacea, these and other initiatives have
served to at least begin the process of bridging the educa-

tion gap between the American elite and the American
under- and lower-classes. But between the unstated privilege of the upper class and the rightfully decried plight of
the American poor is the next great problem of American
higher education: the massive, largely ignored middle class.
Before we can address the middle class in the context of
higher education, it's necessary to define what, exactly, the

middle class is. While the statistical median income (meaning, the income of the middle 20 percent of households in
the United States) in 2005 was between $35,000 and $55,000,
values ranging anywhere from $22,501 (the value which, in
2005, would put an individual just outside of the bottom 25
percent of households) to approximately $lOO,OOO can justifiably be called "middle class." This range would place
about 70 percent of American households in the middle
class.
Considering it represents such a vast majority of
American households, the lack of attention received by

middle class families in higher education is shocking. Even
assuming that families with less than $55,000 in annual
income (placing them outside the top half of households)
will be covered substantially by financial aid, the $47,804
sum of Swarthmore's tuition is daunting. Factor in the
College's own estimate of nearly $2,200 in other annual
expenses, and attending Swarthmore becomes prohibitively expensive even for the relatively well off.
While only aggregate financial aid information is made
available by the college, grouping together both the most
and least well off students, the burden of Swarthmore
tuition has not gone unnoticed on campus, with several
familiar faces missing this semester for financial reasons
and countless more shouldering the burden of massive
commercial loans. And while The Phoenix is preparing an
in-depth feature on the state offinancial aid at Swarthmore,
this problem is not restricted to our campus alone. Across
the country, in the quest for socioeconomic diversity in
higher education, the middle class has fallen to the wayside.
The problem is, as tuition rises faster than inflation
(which, according to US News and World Report, it has
done for as long as the College Board has made such data
available), the changing cost of college disproportionately
affects middle-class families. And particularly in light of
the recent crackdown on easy credit, commercial loans are
no longer a viable option in filling the gap between what

families can realistically afford and what colleges demand
in tuition.
With a 2007 endowment of $1,441,232,000, coming out to
$966,631 per student during the 2007-2008 school year,
Swarthmore has the ability to truly make higher education
realistically accessible to all who seek it. Harvard College's
"Zero to 10 Percent Standard," which ensures that families
earning below $lBO,OOO annually pay no more than 10 percent of their income to send their children to school is only
a starting point. And Swarthmore's endowment only ranks
50th in the nation. With this much money available, the
excuse that it costs more to educate students than schools
take in via tuition payments should fall on deaf ears.
Instead of constructing new multi-hundred-million dollar buildings, like the University of Pennsylvania is doing
for its Annenberg Public Policy Center (already housed in
a state of the art facility), schools should work to lower family responsibilities for tuition. When Penn is able to consider constructing an entirely new bridge over the
Schuylkill River to better connect its campus to the rest of
Philadelphia (a project whose scale is ambitious, even for a
university with a $6.3 billion endowment), it should be evident that its administration has lost sight of its core social

responsibilities.
More radically, for the first time in decades, colleges
could actually lower their tuition. And if colleges are reluctant to open their coffers to middle-class families, then the
federal government needs to obligate them to do so, wielding the threat of revoking schools' tax benefits (ostensibly a
reward for serving the public interest).
And speaking offederal involvement, the idea of making
college tuitionfully tax-deductible has been floating around
Washington for decades. The time has come for it to come
out of the shadows and make its way onto the legislative
agenda. From politicians in Washington to administrators
here at Swarthmore, making college affordable needs to be
put front and center. For many middle-class families, there
exists no other option.

North Korean uncertainty: more than nukes

JAMES MAO

Over International Borders
With the mystery surrounding Kim Jong
H's illness shrouding North Korea in a
murkier cloud of uncertainty than usual,
one topic still remains prominent in the
global arena: North Korea's plans to restore
its nuclear facilities. These announced plans
are a drastic step back from the progress
that was made when North Korea agreed to
participate in a six-party disarmament talk
between itself, South Korea, China, Japan,
Russian, and the United States. Kim's seemingly imminent demise, and the likely power
struggle that would follow it, creates further
unrest for a potentially volatile situation.

16

As far as impending apocalypses go,
nuclear warfare is Exhibit A of how the
world will meet its end at the hands of the
humans who inhabit it. Even while
astounding scientific discoveries in fields
such as medicine continue to be made,
appallingly dangerous scientific developments in the area of weapons of mass
destruction (WMDs) have become a primary concern in today's fractured world.
Concern over North Korea's nuclear
ambitions is certainly warranted.
The curse of human nature is that the
inclination towards adventure and innovation often does culminate in less than
optimal situations. Namely, the one the
global community is mired in today. With
eight nations definitely in possession of
nuclear weapons and at least four others
likely to have them, the threat of nuclear
warfare is at an all-time high.
America and the United Nations have
committed to eradicating this threat the
best they can, as evidenced by their investigations of Iran's nuclear capabilities
this past year. South Korea recently
decided to postpone a steel shipment to
North Korea in response to the latter's
failure to comply with disarmament
agreements. Calls have been made to completely ban the development and creation
of WMDs.
In the volatile environment that is this
Planet Earth, however, prohibiting
nations from manufacturing new types of
WMDs can hardly be considered the prac-

tical solution to thwarting the danger of
nuclear war.
The greatest problem with such an
action is determining how exactly it will
be enforced. Assuming that the UN is
capable of passing this resolution does
not counteract the checkered history the
world has had concerning the detection
and removal of WMDs.

As far as impending
apocalypses go, nuclear
warfare is Exhibit A of
how the world will
meet its end.
There is the troubling fact that the
only entity that has shown consistent
commitment to challenging the prolifera-

tion of nuclear weapons worldwide is, in
fact, also the only entity ever to have used
a nuclear weapon. And ever since the
United States dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima in August 1945, buildup of similar weaponry has been allowed to run
unchecked, as previously mentioned, in at
least seven other nations.
Banning WMDs will only push those
countries that have proven that they are
truly determined to possess them to develop them in secrecy. It is similar to how the

September 25, 2008

black market can flourish in China despite
pirated goods technically being banned.
Considering the present state of North
Korea, the various other nations with a
vested interest in the situation are definitely more grateful to at least be aware of
the nuclear facilities situation. The United
Nations would not prefer to work in ignorance of those kinds of vital facts, behind
the facade of a WMD-less world.
Merely prohibiting the development of
WMDs, in any case, is fundamentally the
wrong approach to tempering the tensions
that may bring about worldwide disaster. It
would be a measure that simply identifies
the weaponry itself as the scapegoat and
not the true culprit for the discordance of
the world: the egos that propel nations to
delve into the arena of WMDs.
It is the religion-fueled squabbles over
strips of land and the rivalry-propelled
races for improved armaments that have
plunged the world into the state it is in
today. Prohibiting the development of
WMDs removes the means, but not the
motivation. Consider it a more depressing
version of a trite saying—"Where there's a
will, there's a way." And with a government like NorthKorea's, which has proven
itself willing to watch millions starve to
death so long as the whims of its dictator
are pursued, there is without a doubt the
will to achieve whatever Kim Jong-Il has
set out for them. Dead or alive.

PHILIP ISSA

Dear Constance Hungerford,
I received your letter about the current
review of the Tri-College Arabic program. I
will be happy to describe my specific experiences with the program in a private letter, but I would like to make clear my support for the Arabic program in this public
letter. I strongly believe that the Arabic
program is an indispensible part of this
school's academic program. The program
is central to the College's mission of imbuing its students with a sense of social consciousness and responsibility. As such, I
urge you to take special care not to weaken
the program in any way. I sincerely hope
that the program will emerge from this
revision process larger and more robust.

Ignorance and misunderstanding of

Middle East has been woefully neglectful
of the welfare of the hundreds of millions
of ordinary Arabs living under the whims
of corrupt autocrats. The daily injustices
that occur throughout these Arab nations
are not our fault, but we as Swarthmore
students can make no pretence of being
concerned global citizens if we do not first
push ourselves to understand a people that
have been manipulated and oppressed for
over half a century.
The cost of our ignorance runs high
here at home as well. Outright racism
against Arabs and Muslims has erupted

crimes committed against a Palestinian

has the potential to
Damascus, Syria
prepare graduates for a lifelong journey
with the language, should the program be
allowed to grow. This is perhaps best illustrated by the experiences that a recent
graduate had learning Arabic during her
time at Swat.
Ruth McDonough 'OB had never been
exposed to Arabic when she arrived at
Swarthmore as a freshman. She endeavored to take Arabic for all four years, but
the program was not created until her junior year. As such, she spent her first two
years taking proxy courses to learn Arabic

through the Religion Department before
studying the language at Middlebury the
summer before her junior year. She then

studied abroad for a year in Jordan and
Syria before returning to Swarthmore to
find that no courses could directly accommodate her high level ofArabic in the budding program. She took one mixed-level
course her senior year.
Today, Ruth is practically fluent in
Arabic. She had lunch with my grandmother in Syria over the summer and blew
her away with her accent and command of
the language. Ruth spoke with such ease
that I was scolded by the housemaid for letting my Arabic (my first language) slide.
"She speaks much better than you do," she
said in all seriousness.
Still, Ruth, in an email to me, credits
her time away from Swarthmore as providing her with the rigorous grammatical
foundation necessary to understand written Arabic.
Students should not have to go to
Middlebury to develop a strong foundation
in the language, and they should not have
to return from abroad to find that no courses can accommodate them due to their
high level of proficiency.
I hope you will agree with me that the
Arabic program at Swarthmore is an integral part of the college curriculum and that
it should continue to grow over the next
few years. With strong support from the
school administration, the program can be
strengthened and expanded so that other
students can emulate Ruth's success in the
language without having to go through the
same hurdles that she did, insha'allah.

know that there is someone, someone English and wellversed in miserablism and who does it archly, tongue-incheek, hand-in-glove better than you. And he's making
money off of it. Stephen Patrick Morrissey, the ex-frontman
of 'Bos English sensation the Smiths, provides much more
than the perfect soundtrack for these (economically)
depressed times. Though it may seem like a stretch to link
an artist known for songs such as "I Know It's Over" and
"Meat is Murder" to investment banking, this isn't a sign of
excessive anglophilia. Business school curricula has been

infiltrated by the so-called Pope of Mope. Business lecturers
in the UK are using Morrissey lyrics to teach business students about professional relationships. "Business relationsips the Morrissey way" was penned by academics who studied Morrissey's lyrics for twenty years ("My love is as sharp
as a needle in your eye/You must be such a fool/To pass me
by," runs "Seasick, Yet Still Docked") and are thus immune
from sub-prime housing issues.

Business school curricula has

And don't think Mr. Morrissey affects just a few English
B-school grads. He's permeated England entirely, like a sort
of esthete dry-rot. One of his most prominent fans is J.K.
Rowling, which by default means that she's transmitted
coded messages about vegetarianism and Myra Hindley

(England's answer to Charles Manson) in all seven Harry
Potter volumes, sort oflike how we have black masses hidden in heavy metal songs. What this means is that the market will now be run by i-bankers dropping words like
"charming" and "fey."
But perhaps the once perpetually-celibate Morrissey
would fit right into being married to the market. It's not
such a stretch, really. What love is to Morrissey (if there's
any hint of mutuality, it'll end in morbidity) is what money
is to the rest of us, now that our taxes will be used to pay off
the banks' mistakes. It might be hard for the sensitive
Morrissey to stand being around the Gordon Gekko/Patrick
Bateman type, but Morrissey is no stranger to catastrophic
loss himself after Johnny Marr's desertion broke up the

Smiths.
No idea what I'm talking about? Put your headphones on

collapse of unregulated banks would hurt the candidate, who, as
recently as a month ago, was declaring himself "fundamentally a
deregulator," I'm not sure if, in this case, the simple logic will hold
true.
Obama's economic plan, with its emphasis on regulation, and its
renunciation of the laissez-faire corporate approach that allowed this
mortgage mess to metastasize, is certainly more feasible than whatever plan the McCain people have cooked up. It's hard to see how voters
couldn't realize this. And certainly at least some of them do; Obama's
poll numbers seem to have stabilizedafter taking their post-Palin dip.
But McCain has overcome his early election stasis and is embarking on one of the most startling transformations of political candidate
in American history. It was just a few months ago that McCain stood
in front of autoworkers in Detroit, explaining that while many jobs
might never come home, free trade benefits the nation as a whole. Now
he's busy warning Americans that powerful corporate interests control Washington.
To what extent this shift is genuine is difficult to tell. McCain has
admitted that economics have never been his strong point, and as a
result, his economic policies have lately mirrored the expedient.
(When it was politic, he was the foremost Republican in bucking the
conservative economic establishment, but he quickly scrapped this
when he realized that he needed to appeal to at least one segment of the
Republican base.)
And lately, it seems, McCain's convinced himself that he's an economic populist. There is a nascent movement withinRepublican ranks
to shift the party further to the left on economic issues, in the hope of
creating "Sam's Club Republicans," and allowing the party to merge
populist rhetoric in the social sphere with populist rhetoric in the economic. McCain did pass over the champion of this movement, Tim
Pawlenty, governor of Minnesota, as his vice-presidential nominee, but
it appears that McCain has realized that the same folk who were so
excited by Sarah Palin's candidacy are not so excited about continued
deregulation and corporate tax breaks.
Obama, on the other hand, hasn't changed his attitude about anything. He remains remote and cerebral. He's not channeling anybody's
rage; he's proposing sensible policy prescriptions. It's easy to blame
him for this, especially if he doesn't experience an immediate rise in
the polls. But when it comes to populism, Obama has a fundamental
image problem. It is no exaggeration to say that his chances in the election hinge on his ability to get over it.
Obama's message has never resonated with the white working
class. He's too Harvard-educated and has begun to sound increasingly
professorial on the campaign trail. His calls for hope and change are
more effective when times aren't as hard as they are now. And he's
black, which only serves to complicate things.
The financial crisis is a wake-up call. Republican refusal to regulate
the banks led directly to Wall Street's collapse. The message the country should take from this is simple: we need to elect Barack Obama
president. We don't need the momentous change he's promising. We
need competence.
My worry is not that this wake-up call will go unheeded, but that it
will be misinterpreted. I am afraid that people will think Obama too
inexperienced to dig America out of its latest mess. McCain is a known
quantity, and in moments of crisis, people tend to go with what they

know.
These aren't the times when it's good to be the new guy with the
funny name. This isn't to say that the financialmeltdown won't, in the
end, help Obama. But some pundits have been crowing that the awful
state of the economy ensures an Obama victory in November. I think
their analysis is very premature.

Lack of wind energy at Swat troubling
To the editor:
We have some news. Over at Haverford there are 1169 students that think they are better than us.
Normally we could dismiss this irrational thought because we know better. But not this time, my friends.
Here at Swarthmore we are running on 60% non-renewable energy sources, 54.6% of which is coal.
Meanwhile, the energy that Haverford purchases is 100% wind power. We have more money, prettier trees,
the Crum, and smarter people. We have to step it up.
So, Earthlust is taking care of you this year. In order to reclaim our rightful position of superiority, we
are proposing a switch to 100% wind energy purchases in two years. Now our motivations do not stem solely from a petty neighborly competition. As a liberal arts college dedicated to enriching our society and ourselves, we have a responsibility to take reasonable steps towards sustainable living. We have begun the
process with the LEED standard buildings on campus, but there is more to be done. American colleges and
s universities have an immense amount of symbolic power effect change
to
in this country. It would be inexcusable and antithetical to Swarthmore's status as an institution of social and educational progress to
remain passive on this issue. There is enough wind energy up for cultivation in the U.S. to power our entire
country. It is a free, clean gift, and we are wasting it. If the younger generation doesn't act, who will?
Starting today we will be circulating a petition demanding that Swarthmore College purchases 100% wind
energy, culminating in a mariachi band-green feet paint-paper wind mill flying rally on the Parrish steps
next Friday, October 3rd. We've made it easy for you this time. Look for us sporting green eco-warrior face
stripes. Feel free to wear your own. Check reserved students for rally details. There will also be an Olde Club
Party next Thursday after Pub Night.
This semester is a crucial time to visibly support sustainable energy consumption. The 2020 Planning
Committee needs to see those who support wind energy making their demands. An arboretum that gets over
half its energy from the coal industry just makes no sense.

Victorious men's soccer team conspicuously absent
To the editor:
I was surprised to open the Phoenix today, leaf through the pages, and find absolutely no mention of the
men's soccer team. This week's issue had two sports stories, one on a loss by the women's soccer team and
one on a loss by the women's field hockey team. Meanwhile, the men's soccer team had their most important victory in school history, beating the #5 team in the nation on the road and rising in the national rankings to #ll in the country. I would figure that this would at least merit some space in the school newspaper,
and I hope that such a glaring omission is a once in a year phenomenon.

Sarah Palin stories not cover-worthy
To the editor:
Sarah Palin's appearance on the covers of magazines and newspapers worldwide is a disturbing trend
that distracts from the real issues in this election cycle. Sadly, even the Phoenix is not immune to this sensationalistic digression. The cult of celebrity in politics distracts from the serious issues being discussed in
campaigns at all levels, from climate change to student loans. Our State Rep. Bryan Lentz is running a reelection campaign focusing on his record of pushing for wind power research funding in Pennsylvania's universities. Just a few miles south of Swarthmore, former United Auto Workers Local 1069 President John
DeFrancisco is running for the state house to continue his career of fighting for labor rights. Barack Obama
has focused more on helping students pay for college than any other presidential candidate in our lifetime.
By focusing on substantive issues, these candidates involve citizens in the democratic discourse. Granted,
the question of how either presidential candidate's V.P. pick reflects on his judgment is fair game for coverage, but focusing on a Vice Presidential candidate's pregnant teenage daughter, as did the cover of the
September 11th issue of the Phoenix, distracts from real issues. The Sarah Palin story is dramatic and glamorous to cover, but we need a media that doesn't hype up celebrity gossip and instead focuses on issues that
have the potential to affect our lives.

A plea to Swatties: Make time for the tablers
To the editor:
How many of you have ever felt harassed by tablers? They sit there, lurking in Sharpies and Parrish
mailroom with their causes, and calling out their demands for your time and attention when you've got
class, a paper to write, four different meetings to go to, and a game of Frisbee to play. They force you to
pick up your pace, turn up your iPod, or walk out the back door.
As someone who has been on both sides of the table, I'd like to propose a truce.
While someone might be asking you to take a few minutes out of your day to sign a petition or make
a call to your senator, remember that the person sitting there cares enough about that cause to be there

at that table for an hour or more.
Respect that. They don't want to make you feel guilty or yell at you from across the room. They want
to educate you.
We're always busy here at Swarthmore. It's a fact of life. It's a challenge we thrive on and, occasionally, get consumed by. These tablers are trying to make it easier for you to make a difference, regardless
of how busy your day gets. Having an ethical intelligence is as important to me as having an active intellect, and so I'd like to remind the student body to take advantage of those people and their passion while
you're here.
Go up to them and ask them what they are there for. Don't give tablers a chance to disturb the peace
of your afternoon. Make them a meaningful part of it instead. Then, if you agree with what they have to
say, take the 30 seconds (literally sometimes) to call your senator or sign their petition. Or hot. It's okay
to say no. Just take the time to ask.

Staying loyal to the Sharks, no matter the score
me become "a person of true principle,"
but instead the San Jose Sharks.
It wasn't as if I needed an excuse to be
loyal to the hockey team; before I even
knew who Gerschenkron was, I was
already following the Sharks games and
players obsessively, and I thought this was
going to be the easiest loyalty I would ever
be asked to honor. Yet, just as
Gerschenkron did with the Red Sox, I have
endured my fair share of drama as a devoted Sharks fan. Some of the drama I could
do without, such as the losing streaks, the

HANNAH PURKEY
Purkey Perspective
In the biography "The Fly Swatter,"
famous
Alexander
economist
Gerschenkron is described as impressing
on his grandson the importance that
"someone who was going to grow up to be
a person of true principle would get that
way by proving his loyalty to small things,
like the Boston Red Sox."
When I first discovered this quote, I
was ecstatic. Here was this renowned
scholar whom I admired greatly, telling me
that the secret to being a good person is
just a little loyalty. For me, it was never
the Boston Red Sox who were going to help

disappointing trades, and what seems to be
a pattern with the Sharks, the regular-season dominance that never seems to carry
over into the playoffs. Still, I haven't
missed a game in years.
This became more difficult to do when I
decided to attend school thousands of
miles and three time zones away from
where the Sharks play. But where there is
a true fan, there is a way. Thus I have
found myself in some odd situations for
the sake of not missing a game. When the
Sharks lost in overtime in a playoff game
against the Dallas Stars, I instinctively let
out a string of profanities. Unfortunately, I
was in a science associates meeting at the
time, and found myself scrambling to
explain how it was my frustration with the
spectrum analysis on the orgo homework
that led to this inappropriate outburst.
Another day I found myself huddled out-

side the library doors (the obvious place to
watch hockey games) in the cold at 2 am,
clutching my computer in an attempt not
to lose my Internet connection as the
Sharks won in a shootout over the
Washington Capitals: (This story became
more embarrassing when I realized that
the campus was wireless and I could have
gone and sat down without losing my
Internet.)

"Here was this renowned
scholar... telling me that
the secret to being a good
person is just a little
loyalty."
But my favorite situation was sneaking
out of the Wachovia Center after the
Sharks embarrassed the Philadelphia
Flyers, hiding Sharks jerseys under jackets and in purses based on the warning
from some concerned Flyers fans that my
friend and I might not leave the rink in one
piece if we flaunted our victory after the
game.
But not all my Sharks experiences have
been ones that I want to remember. For a
hobby that is supposedly a fun distraction

from work, the most stressful and disappointing day of last year was when the
Sharks were eliminated from the playoffs
in quadruple overtime. For five hours and
14 minutes, which felt even longer than
that, I watched intensely, looking away
during penalty kills and cursing the opponent's goalie. In the end, I am not ashamed
to say, I shed a little tear for a season that
was brought to an end too soon.

So maybe proving my loyalty hasn't
been that easy. Either way, my dedication
to hockey, although not fully understood
by my friends and family nor for that matter particularly good for my grade point
average, goes beyond just finding a distraction from everyday life. To me, hockey
is a crucial part of who I am. Don't get me
wrong; a monkey on skates would probably embarrass me if we were put in a rink
together. But even if I am a little challenged when it comes to skating, talking
about hockey never fails to bring a smile to
my face. As training camp gets on its way
and preseason games begin, I already find
myself getting excited at the mere mention

of Joe Thorton or the upcoming scrim-

mages against the Ducks. Despite past

embarrassing moments and close calls
with Flyers fans, I know that I'll still

watch every game and obsess over every
article that mentions the Sharks.

After rising to unprecedented ranking, men's soccer falls to Hopkins
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore Men's Soccer suffered its
first loss of the season last Saturday in
Maryland. The Garnet fell to 5-1-1 (0-ICC) at
the hands of the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays,
who improved to 6-2-1 (1-0 CC). Johns
Hopkins struck early in the match, and
Swarthmore could not find a way to recover. After only 11 minutes the Garnet was
down two goals, and neither team scored for
the remainder of the game.
Coming into the match, Swarthmore
was ranked #ll in the nation after an
impressive upset of #5 Stevens Tech (N.J.).
Ironically, the Garnet was the one who
struck early in that game with a 10th
minute goal by Morgan Langley 1L After a
second half goal by David Sterngold 'l2 off a
feed from Dylan Langley 'lO, the score was
2-0 and remained that way for the rest of the
match.

"We learned that you can't
let your focus or
concentration down
even for a moment."
Eric Wagner
Men's Soccer Coach

Johns Hopkins struck again in the 11th
minute off a corner kick. Bukoski took the
corner and sent it to Blue Jay junior Max
Venker, who passed it right back to
Bukoski.
Bukoski then played the ball into the
center where senior Matty Carlson deflected it off his heel to charging freshman Drew
Holland who finished the play with a goal.
D'Annunzio attributed the early opportunities for the Blue Jays to "coming out flat." "I
feel like we were not ready to go," he said.
His teammate Toby Heavenrich 'l2
agreed. "We need intensity in the beginning
of the game," he said, 'land then we need to
stay with it." Swarthmore Head Coach Eric
Wagner expressed similar concerns. "We
weren't prepared," he said. "We looked like
we were deer frozen in the headlights."
He went on to say that the Garnet got out
of its funk and recovered to keep pace with
Johns Hopkins, but it was too late.
Swarthmore's best chance came in the
middle of the second half when Dylan
Langley unleashed a shot that just missed
the net and ricocheted off the crossbar. The
Garnet had trouble generating scoring
opportunities because the Blue Jays "were
more physical than we were expecting,"
D'Annunzio said. Wagner noticed the same

thing.
"They were knocking us off the ball and
winning virtually every challenge," he said.
The game was beneficial for the team, however, in that it was a learning experience.
"We learned that you can't let your focus or

concentration down even for a moment,"

The #ll ranking the men held for a week
was the highest national ranking ever
attained by the men's soccer team. With the
loss to the unranked Johns Hopkins, however, Swarthmore fell out of the top 25.
The Blue Jays' first goal came in the
eighth minute off a masterful pass into the
box by Johns Hopkins senior Akash Naik.
Sophomore forward Scott Bukoski collected
the pass and fired the ball into the back of
the net past the save attempt by
Swarthmore goalie David D'Annunzio 'l2.

Wagner said", 'and we learned what we have
to do to be prepared; [we learned] how
important pre-game preparation is."
As the Garnet prepares for the upcoming
games this season Wagner notes that "this
is a big week." "And I fully expect that we

will rebound," he added, "because we're a
strong team with talentedand confident student athletes." Swarthmore looks to
improve its Centennial Conference record
with a home game against Dickinson
College on September 27th at 6 p.m.

Volleyball shows skills at Salisbury Cross country team

This past Friday and Saturday
the busy Swarthmore Women's
Volleyball Team (4-11) attended their

final tournament before the start of
conference play, the Sea Gull Classic

This past Saturday, the Swarthmore cross country
team trekked to Carlisle, Pennsylvania for the Dickinson
Long/Short Meet, running the 4-kilometer Short course.
The team had a strong showing, with the men securing an
eleventh-place finish out of 22 competing schools and the
women taking seventh place out of 23 teams.
Leading the pack were Erik Saka 'O9 in 27th place for
the men and Melissa Frick 'l2 in 11thplace on the women's
side, with times of 12:5142 and 15:07.68respectively. Patrick
Hartnett 'llfollowed shortly in Saka's wake, finishing 31st,

at Salisbury University.
The Garnet got off to a slow start,
falling to Richard Stockton College
25-19, 25-21, 25-14 and Salisbury 25-14,
25-12, 25-2 L However, the team recovered on Saturday, looking in far better form in a contested loss to
Virginia Wesleyan College 25-14, 2025, 25-13, 25-17. Shortly after, the
team settled the score with Virginia
Wesleyan by shutting them out three
sets to none in a 25-22, 25-23, 25-16
routing.
The Sea Gull Classic was not only
significant because it was the last
tournament before the Centennial
Conference matches, but also due to
the accomplishments of a few of the
team's key players. Kearney Bangs

and Dan Hodson 'O9 was the third Swattie on the men's
team to cross the finish line, in 72nd place. "It was a short
course, so we ran hard," Hodson said. "We ran balls out for
the first mile and ran harder after that."
The women's team, led by Frick, had an astonishing
eight runners finish in the top 50 places at Dickinson, with
Kathy Feeney 'O9 running a personal best of 15:29.78 and
finishing in 24th place, and Emma Stanley 'O9 finishing in
38th with a final time of 15:47.90. What made the women's
accomplishments all the more remarkable was their loss of

team's last meet on August 30th, was unable to run on

"Jen and Genna [Pezzola 'l2]"
proved to be an offensive force to be
reckoned with, said Coach Harleigh
Chwastyk. In their victory against
Virginia Wesleyan, the two combined for 21 kills while Pezzolla posted a team high of 17 digs. The capacity of offensive players to contribute
to defense has certainly been an
asset for the team this season.
The players' defensive prowess
has defined the team this year.
Despite the lack of a true middle

blocker, Swarthmore's defense has
been outstanding, digging consistently and seldom giving away free
points. Libero Erin Heaney 'O9 will
make calls on defense to take opponents out of hitting patterns and to
counter hitters' tendencies.
Chwastyk comments that volleyball is a game where there are "more
minuses than you have pluses." In
other words, a hitter is more likely to
commit an error than to hit a winner. Swarthmore's defense can frustrate and enervate opponents when
points become extended and their
hitters have difficulty putting the
ball away. Often opponents become
demoralized before they become
physically worn out.
Often volleyball is largely a mental game. Sarah Lambert 'll
explained that during Friday's losses, "The team was really off. We had
just gotten out of classes ...We put
our heads in the game on the second
day." Lambert went on to comment
on the emotionality of the sport,
"When one player is up the team is
up; when one player is down, the
team is down."
Chwastyk concurred, praising the
women's team for overcoming "mental hurdles" that had impeded their

Saturday.

Head Coach Peter Carroll was pleased with the efforts

of his team, claiming that it boded well for the remainder
of the season, especially for the women's team. "This meet
was a kind of barometer," Carroll said on Sunday. "We
have a lot of first-years, and I wanted to see what they

could do. You never really know what the team can do
until they're thrown into battle," Carroll said.
Carroll said he has high expectations for the team after
this meet. The women's team in particular is being held to
very high standards; Carroll claims they could very possibly rank in the top three in their conference this year. In

performance early on. The team is
constantly improving through practice and adapting to their opponents.
The team has been working especially hard on serving. "If we can get our
serving down" then the chances for
victory will be much higher,

Lambert commented. She also said
that it was important for the team to
take advantage of the game once they
had taken a lead.
After a string of away games, the
team will face Bryn Mawr at home
on Wednesday, September 24th for a

Centennial Conference match. The
team has been spending extra time
preparing for this particular game.
Chwastyk commented that when the
volleyball team plays in tournaments
or frequent matches it becomes
increasingly difficult to prepare for a
specific opponent.
Wednesday night is also the
Faculty and Staff Appreciation
Night, where players invite professors to cheer on the team. The facul-

ty and staff are generally very enthu-

siastic about watching the team play,
and this year, after being treated to
world-class volleyball during the
Beijing Summer Olympics, many are
even more eager to observe the
match. (Of course the game is open to
all Swarthmore students who wish to
cheer on their volleyball team).

Despite their dedication to rigorously prepare for the upcoming
match, the volleyball team is concerned with more than just winning
or losing. This October the team continues to sponsor the "Digging for A

fundraiser as their contribution to National Breast Cancer
Awareness Month, founded by
Chwastyk a few years ago. The players will solicit donations by asking
for a cash pledge for each dig the

Centennial
has.
The

raised $13,000 in the past two years.
This year, they hope to break the

the 10 years that Carroll has coached Swarthmore Cross
Country, he said that this year's team is "one of the best
[he's] ever had, with the most talent across the board."
Carroll still cautions against overconfidence, even with
such a talented team.
"You can have all the talent in the world and do nothing with it," Carroll said. "But that's what's great about
Swat kids. Swat kids work." Carroll's team seems as
enthused as he is at the prospect of their potentially triumphant season.
"I'm nervous, but really excited about our chances,"
Frick said on Sunday, echoing Carroll's expectations for a
successful season. "We have a really good shot, and I can
only imagine [our chances] getting better as we get more in
shape," Frick said. Frick's enthusiasm is shared by the
rest of the team, who congregate frequently outside of
practice. "We hang out here every Monday evening," said
Hodson amidst a group of runners in Parrish third, holding a communal cake eating "Balls out" (again, the team's
motto for the manner in which Saturday's meet was run).
This sense of community seems to be integral to their success. "The upperclassmen are very enthusiastic and supportive," Frick said. Frick, one of thirteen first-year runners, said that he appreciates the team's enthusiasm. "All
the seniors keep this group together," Frick explained.
Such leadership and community are necessary for the
team as they train towards what ought to be an exciting
season. "Cross Country is not a fun sport," said Coach
Carroll. "It's a lot of hard work. But part of the appeal is
unity and friendship, and the senior class really provides
that appeal."
The team will make the trip to Haverford this Tuesday
to compete at the MainLine Invitational.
