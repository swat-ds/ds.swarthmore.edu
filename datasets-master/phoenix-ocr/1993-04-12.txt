Protestors March

Against Westinghouse
Chester Incinerator
by EUGENE SONN
Ten Swarthmore students and
over twenty residents of Chester
marched from the County Court
offices in Media to the trash incinerator in Chester on Monday. At the
incinerator, the protestors were
joined by an additional twenty
Chester residents to demonstrate
against the Westinghouse trash-tosteam plant and the health hazards it
creates.

The groupblocked trashtrucks
from entering the incinerator from
Thurlow Street, but the trucks were
able to back up and take an alternate
route to enter the incinerator plant.
Whenpeople realized thetrucks
were still entering the plant, some
wanted to move up to block the
incinerator gate rather than the road
leading to it. But Reverend Horace
Strand, who has led a group of
Chester residents protesting the incineratorand marched at the headof
Monday's procession, told everyone they would not block the entrance.

"We're here to bring public
attention to our cause. I'm not going to be a part of getting anybody
hurt [by blocking the trucks]," said
Strand "We're trying to stop anybody from coming in, we're just
trying to make difficulty for them
and make their lives a little miserable like they make our lives miserable."
Strand claimed that the group
had previously decided to only try
to inconveniencethe incinerator, not
shut it down. However, others
present at the meeting thought they
had agreed to block the gate entirely. "I thought we decided to
block the trucks from entering until
thepolice arrivedand told uswe had
to move or we would be arrested,"

said Bart Smith '93.
Eventhough they did not block
the plant, the day's march and protest brought the group's message to
many new people. As they group
started the day with a protest at the
County Court and Municipal offices, Rev. Strand wheeled in a coffin, marked with a sign reading
"Herelies ChesterCity," to the courtyard. The protestors marched
around it chanting "No trucks, no
trash, no rats," bellowing their message to the County's elected officials.
"It might seem this is a little
exaggeratedhaving acoffin out here,
but in reality we are being slowly
poisoned and murdered by thehazardous waste, by these chemicals,
the pollution," said Strand. Citizens complained about thedustfrom
the incinerator which prevents them
from drying their clothes outside
and opening their windows.
"I've been on WilsonStreet for
ten years, and I was there long before theincinerator came there. And
it was beautiful then and it's a mess
now. And all I want is out," said one
man, referring to the group's demand that Westinghouse buy the
houses from residents near the incinerator at the prices the houses
wouldhave fetchedbefore the plant
was built.
The grouplisted thehealthhazards the incinerator causes as only
the latest in a long list of ways the
county has taken advantage of
Chester. Citing asthma and coughing conditions in their children as
direct results of the incinerator's
pollution, thecitizens demandedthe

Child Care Concerns Voiced by Many Campus Groups
by NATASHA FRANCESCHI
For close to a decade, child care has been
a significant topic of discussion at Swarthmore. Due to the growing opinion that child
care should be partly a College responsibility,
three extensive surveys were conducted in
1990 withthe hope of using the collected data
to demonstrate that the College ought to seriously consider the issue.
The first survey assessed the needs and
attitudes ofCollege faculty and staffwho had
preschool children, or were expecting a child;
the second was an attitude survey of faculty
and staff who did not have preschool children
and were not expecting them; and the third
examined child-care policies at a number of
other similar schools and area universities.
The surveys brought up several important
points: there is a definite need for child care
among College employees; employees who
do not have small children and are not expecting them in the next few years still support
proposals for child-care at theCollege; and by
not offering any sort of child-care options,
Swarthmore is in the minority oftheinstitutes
of higher learning that were surveyed
Various College committees have discussed these issues over the years. Most
recently child-care has been the topic of the

a concern that if a center is built on campus it
may not be the preferred methodof child care
for employees who live far away, have early
hours, etc., and may not want to bring their
children to campus."
As the need for child-care grows, talk
progresses and more ideas are generated about
how the College should best provide childcare for its employees. It is hoped that many
of these questions will soon be answered so
that some formal recommendations can be
made, and a child-care facility can officially
be in the future of the College.

Though impressed by the influence that gay and lesbian
lobbyists are starting to wield with a sympathetic and revitalizedDemocratic Party, Vaid took care to stress that access to

"mainstreaming" of the movement that it has taken to achieve
this access. "Reform...isn't the endpost ofour liberation," she
declared. "Thepower to influence thepolitical process comes
from two forces—money and votes." To cultivate these
forces, as well as a unified moral vision to counteract that of
the religious right, is Vaid's ultimate prescription for a movement that in many ways is still in its infancy.

About Their Strike For Benefits
by BART SMITH

Union organizer Ventura Gutierrez and
several farmworkers will be speaking about
the strike atKaolin MushroomfarminKennett
Square on Tuesday, April 13 at spm inKirby
Lecture Hall. The mushroom workers at
Kaolin have been on strike since April 2 and
the 140 workers demand that Kaolin Mushroom farm recognize theirunion and increase
wages and benefits for all employees.
Kennett Square is the single largest producer ofmushrooms in the world. The mushroom industry has thrived off of cheap labor
from Mexican migrant workers. More than
10,000Mexican migrant workers in Kennett
square work for the mushroom farms.
The strikers consist of two groups of
employees, the packers and the pickers. The
packers are paid $5 dollars an hour. Recently
their wage was dropped to $4.50 per hour
with a promise of more overtime work. However, their hourshave actually decreased. The
pickers are paid a piece rate of $l.lO per
basket ofmushrooms at a weight of 10pounds.
An average mushroom picker collects approximately 4 baskets per hour. The pickers
resent being cheated by thecompany *s weighing the baskets: often the baskets of mushrooms weigh up to 16 or 17 pounds when

filled completely, yet the company still only
pays them $l.lO. The company hasalso tightened rules and regulations for picking the
mushrooms, maintaining the mushroombeds,
and cleaning up the work area, all of which
take more time away from picking.
The workers at Kaolin receive no benefits and live in very poor conditions. A
Puerto Rican woman who works at Kaolin
said, "They treat us as animals, as dogs. We
are human beings, not animals." A similar
mushroom farm in Butler County near Pittsburgh that employs unionized U.S. workers
pays $8 dollars an hour with benefits. At a
rally lastSunday Kaolin organizers demanded
equal treatment to that of mushroom farms
elsewhere.
Mushroom workersand thecompany are
waging two court battles; one is over the
restrictions on picketing by workers, and the
other on the hiring ofreplacement workers by
the company. In the past few days, the Company has brought Vietnamese and Cambodian workers from Philadelphia to the plant in
order to continue production. Reports claim
these strike-breakers were kids as young as 14
or 15 years old. The workers on strike, however, remain steadfast, proclaiming, "We will
overcome. We are here in rain or snow."

Finding a Way Out: Women Break the Cycle of Violence
by RACHEL MEYERS
Last year, theDomestic Abuse
Project ofDelaware County (DAP)
served over 2,ooonew clients.Since
1976,they have served over 15,000
people, mostly women and their
children. These statistics highlight
a stark reality: "domestic violence"
is the most common violent crime
in America, and it is also a crime
often surrounded by secrecy.
Until fairly recently, domestic
violence was considered "private"
business within a family or a relationship, and the police and legal
system offered women little protection.
Allison Gill '95, who was
stalkedby a former boyfriend, said,
"I don't like the label of domestic
abusebecause itlabels this violence
as something in the home and private, which is none of our business."
Veronica Wiegand (now remarried), a former client of DAP
who was abused by her first husband, said, "People ask, 'Why
doesn't she just leave?', but they
should be asking, 'Why doesn't
someone make him stop hitting
her?*"
Agencies like DAP and Women
Against Abuse (WAA) in Philadelphia (which served 15,000 clients
last year) are working to change
attitudes and provide alternatives
for women who feel trapped and
isolated. "More people realize there
is a way out," commented DAP's
Claire Hushion.
"When I called the agency and
thecounselor asked, 'Does he ever
hit you?', it was like a weight had
been lifted off me because I had
never talked to anyone about it,"
said Wiegand. "One of the first
things that happens in an abusive
relationship is you get cut off from
your support systems. We moved
nine times in three years, and every
time I madefriends in the neighborhood, we moved," Wiegand explained. "Once a man strips you of
your self-esteem and support networks, you're really out there all
alone."
Both agencies work in the civil
and criminal legal systems, helping
women obtain protection orders or
file charges against abusive husbands, boyfriends or friends.
However, "a protection order
is a piece ofpaper, not a bulletproof

vest," said Hushion. "We have had
women shot when they were carrying a protection order in their
pocket," she said.
A protection order forbids the
abuser to follow or harass the woman
and her children, and may include
eviction from a shared home and
child support. According to
Hushion, violence often occurs after an eviction, which may trigger
an abuser's anger. Paul Bukovec,
director ofProject RAP, a treatment
programfor abusive men, notes: "A
protection order can serve as a trigger or it may cool the guy out, and
often the women have a better feel
for that than we do. In nine years of
doing this work, I've found that no
one method is safe for everybody."
Gill experienced the frustration of working within the legal
system. "It's ironic that in the interest of self-preservation, you have to
turn your life upside down," she
said. She ultimately chose not to file
for aprotection order because ofthe
face-to-face confrontation that the
hearing requires. "He [the stalker]
wants contact at any level, and my
way of dealing with him is nonengagement," Gill explained. She
was also concerned that the judge
wouldn't believe her, and would
refuse to grant the protection order.
"It's really scary how little there is
to be done, and I feel I'm so vulnerable wherever I am," Gill added.
One of the reasons women are
afraid to leave is that sometimes
things get worse after they walk out,
Hushion added. "They're taking a
calculatedrisk when they decide to
leave, and we ask them to think
things through before they do it, in
terms ofwhere they will goandhow
they will support themselves," said
Hushion. Wiegand explained, "A
woman doesn't leave until she's
more afraid to stay than she is of

leave, withthree bags full ofclothes
and two small children. Women are
raised to feel the responsibility of
maintaining the relationship is on
them, and I kept changing my behaviorto try and make things work,"
she explained. "I was convinced I
was a lousy mother, and it took
getting out of that situation to see
that I wasn't"
Domestic violence situations
are among the most dangerous calls
police face, because [the situation]
is so volatile and things may explode at any moment," explained
Paul Chiano, legal advocate atDAP.

"Abuse doesn't need

woman's role because we don't want

In Pennsylvania, police have
the power to make a warrantless
arrest if there is evidence of abuse,
according to Joan Minz-Ulmer of
WAA. This takes the woman offthe
spot, so she is not forced to make a
decision. Police are also mandated
to give women the name and number of a local domestic violence
shelter program. At WAA, thenumber one source of referrals to their
shelter comes from thepolice, added
Minz-Ulmer.
In addition, Pennsylvania
passed a stalking law two weeks
ago, which makes the act ofstalking
a crime. Without this law, stalkers
had to assault their targets before
they could be arrested or charged
with a crime, said Chiano. Thirtyfive states now have stalking laws,

followed her to Swarthmore, and
looked at every door on campus
until he found hers. He was removed from campus by college security.
While agencies like WAA and
DAP work mostly with women and
children, (they do recognize and
assist male victims of abuse), one
organization is working on theproblem by treating abusive men. Project
RAP is a 38-week program that
includes 24 weeksof grouptherapy.
According to Paul Bukovec, program director, the men are carefully
screened before they can participate. "[A man] has to admit that he
has a problem, describe some of the
things he's done, agree that if he
comes, we'll talk to his wife or
girlfriend and get her side of the
story, andagree that ifhe drops out,
we can tellher. Even ifhe's referred
by the court system, we won't take
him if he won't admit he has a
problem."
Most of Project RAP's clients
are between 27 and 39, with few
men below 22. The program uses
peer pressure and contract-making
to help the men stop their abusive
behavior. "For example, someone
may make a pledge to theother men
in the room not to physically discipline theirchildren this week. Peer
pressure is one of our most powerful tools," notedBukovec.
According to DAP, 50 percent
ofchildren who live with an abused
mother are also abused, but "there's
moresupport among theguys about
stopping child abuse," Bukovec
said. "The men are angry at the
women because they feel they're
being hurt by them, and they sometimes feel that the women deserve
the 'punishment' they get. They
can identify more with the kids'
experiences."
"Abuse doesn't need two
people," Bukovec commented. "We
de-emphasize the woman's role because we don't want to blame the
victim, and we don't want to make
them feel it's their fault." For this
reason, the partners of the men in
the program do not participate directly. "Men findthat as they stay in
the program longer, their wives or
girlfriends are more able to be angry with them because they are less
afraid."
Even within the group, some
topics are more sensitive than oth-

ers. "Men are much less willing to
admit sexual abuse, like coercive
sex, or badgering to get her to have
it. However, as they start to expand
their definition of what's abusive,
they will include [sexual abuse],"
said Bukovec.
Bukovec is also watchful for
stalking, and will warn women who
are at risk, particularly if the abuser
leaves the program when he is confronted with his behavior.
Even with this "select crew of
guys," about nine percent of the
men who complete the program relapse after one year. "If they stop
hitting, the more severe physical
abusers tend to escalate otherkinds
ofabuse, so we pay particular attention to addressing the underlying
reasons for their behaviors," said
Bukovec. "It's important to remember that the legal, social andpsychological remedies aren't always predictable," he added.
"We have to stop making it
acceptable for men to be violent,"
said Wiegand. "I have a 16-year-old
stepdaughter who's already been in
a violent relationship. We need to
work on the attitudes ofyoung men
and women. It's frightening what
you'll put up with because you feel
if you can love him through this,
youcanlove him through anything,"
she added.
Gill'sabuser followed her from
Russia and is still living in America
as an illegal alien. He continues to
write her letters, and "the theme is,
one of these days we 'll have to deal
with each other," said Gill. "I don't
want to go through life not trusting
everyone. I feel if I do that, he's
won. It's still very hard to separate
the person I knew as a friend from
the person who's crazy and frightening me," she added. "1 leel 1 have

for an incinerator would drop dramatically if

would also provide more jobs for Chester

Orthodoxy not Synonymous
with Fundamentalism
To the Editor:
Well to be honest, I hesitate to enter this
debatebecause I have never read one thing by
GJC. Chesterton. I have howeverbeen faithfully reading the Phoenix and I feel that I have
noticed a misunderstanding that I can help to
clear up.
In Mohan Amibikaipaker's article"Religious 'Orthodoxy': The Cheap Train to
Utopia," he summarized Read Mercer
Schuchardt's article, "Tolerant Regime has
NoßoomforOrthodoxy,"by saying, "Read's
main critique of Swarthmore centers on injury done to his personal religious beliefs
whenbiology classes fail to includeChristian
creation science and when 'orthodox' interpretations of religious faith are left out in
religion course. Furthermore Read complains
that certain intellectual exercises like
deconstructionivist linguistics undermine his
deep seatedbeliefs. All this is tantamount to
'religious discrimination.'"
This summary of Read's argument is
closebut not entirely accurate. I will attempt
to clarify Read's article to prevent future
misunderstanding but I strongly encourage
anyone interested to go back and look at
Read's article.
In Read' s reference to his biology classes
he did not ask that that Christian creation
science be included in thecurriculum. Rather
he askedthat the theory ofevolutionbe taught
as a theory and that contradicting theories
fromother scientists, not theologians, be made
available to students.
Similarly, he did not ask that orthodox
Christianity be taught in religion courses. He
merely asked that that the department ap-

proach the topic not withthe goal of teaching
that all religions are relative but rather with
the goal ofpresenting the history andbelief in
as impartial a way as possible, and that impartiality involves recognizing thatmany people
did and do believe thesereligions as fact
Thirdly, Read does not complain about
"intellectual exercises." In fact Read says
that suchexercises are "tenable and desirable,
and I have done [than] several times in various classes." He simply asks that that a belief
which refutes his religion not be a prerequisite for a course, which he is required to
accept for an entire semester.
In response to Read's claim that his academic freedom is being threatened in the
biology and religion departments, Mohan
asks an excellent question: "Why stop at
biology and religion?" I would answer that
excellent question with a charge. Ifheorany
students feel that their academic freedom is
being jeopardized in another field, as Read's
was in some of his classes, they have a duty
to the community to try to change that situation. In Mohan's next paragraph he asked
whether the curriculum should be change
based on a percentage of people holding differentorthodox beliefs. I think this goesback
to a misunderstanding addressed earlier. Read
is not asking that any orthodox religious
viewsbe taught. Rather, he argues that all of
these views should be heard and allowed to
enterrelevant academic discussion. Just as in
a political science class on Marx one would
expect to read commentaries written by both
Marx's supporters and dissenters. It would
make sense that in a religion class the commentaries ofboth believing and non-believing scholars would be read

Sign Removers Exhibit Cowardly Behavior
Dear Editor:

I would like to express my anger at incidents which I have both
witnessed and personally experienced in the past two days. ASORA
Alliance for Sexual Orientation Rights and Awareness has
embarked on a postering campaign.
You may have seen the two
posters which are currently being
used by ASORA to raise awareness
about the homophobia and sexism
on this campus. Pictures were taken
of graffiti on desks in Cornell Library and then xeroxed ontoposters

withthe questionposed: "Still think
Swat is too PC?" I have noticed that
in the last 18 hours four of these
signs have been-removed. Two of
them were above the comment board
in Parrish outside of the Admissions
Office. Two were taped in a men's
bathroom stall in Beardsley. Admittedly, Environmental Services
may have a policy which restricts
the posting of such signs in specific
locations, but certainly the two in
Parrish hall had been up for five
days and had until today been untouched. In addition, many of the
posters taped up in Willets were removed within hours of their place-

These occurences disturb me
particularly because they are committed anonymously and secretly
by people lacking the courage to
confront me or other members of
ASORA directly. Additionally such
incidents work at tearing down any
sense of community at this campus.
Removal of signs obstruct my and
ASORA's right to free speech and
expression on this campus. Standing in line for lunch on Sunday, I
overheard theconversation of three
male students standing behind me.
Two of the students had gone to the
Sager party in Pearson on Saturday

night. (They had entered and stood
along the wall with ten or so other
male students, and were there for
approximately fifteen minutes. They
chose not to dance or mingle with
the other people at the party, but
instead chose to stand and stare at
the people dancing.) The other student had not attended the party. Their
conversation went something like
this:
Two partygoers: "Yeah, we
were so 'hard up' for something to
do last night we went to the party in
Pearson!"
Non-partygoer: "Was that the
party with all of the cross-dressers

and fags?!"
I didnot immediatelyrespond.
However, I later ran into the latter
student (with whom I am acquainted) and told him that I was
one of those "cross-dressing fags",
and that I thought he ought to consider where he spoke such hateful
things. Both of these homophobic
and hateful occurences anger me,
yet I wouldrather respond directly
to homophobia rather than silently
wonderwhoit is who cowardly tears
down posters.

toset up a public television in Tarble

JCS Contains Anti-Jewish Themes, Homophobia and Sexism
Dear Swarthmore,
On Thursday I saw the Swarthmore production of "Jesus
ChristSuperstar." ThoughI applaud and honor the hard work and
long hours put into this production by all involved, there was
something about it that really disturbed me. There I was in the
audience, grooving on the show (which has been a favorite of
mine for nine years) when out walk Caiaphas and Annas—the
two representatives of the Jewish hierarchy—wearing masks. At
first I tried to ignore it, or rationalize to myself that it was not
possible thatI was witnessing suchblatant anti-Jewish-ism. After
all, the myth on this campus is that "everyone" is so sensitized to
issues of race, gender, sexuality, class (again, I don't know who
it is who actually believes this myth, but the constantcries of"this
campus is too PC" indicate that someone does) thatI could hardly
believe that someone could have produced a representation that
was so obviously outrageous. I mean, to me these masks madethe
Caiaphus and Armas look like animals—the hideous, evil beasts
who plotted to kill the god-man Jesus. In light of the fact thatfor
the last two thousand years this stupid story has been used as a
rationale to systematically isolate and annihilate Jews, and that
there is a specific history of depiction of Jews as animals (look at
any Nazi propaganda flick for one example among many) I was
not pleased by whatI was seeing before me. So I sat there, feeling
sick, remembering an article I had read by a Jewish womon who
had disrupted a performance she was at because she found it to be
anti-Jewish!shoulddo something, I told myself, this is too much.
However, I felt really powerless, doubting even my own interpretation of the situation, feeling that perhaps I was being "too
sensitive." I sat thereand watched the whole performance, which
ended with the "Jews" (so designated by their masks and their
writhing around as ifpossessed) laying down their masks at the
foot of the crucified Jesus and falling to worship him. What I
interpreted this to be was that these Jews had "seen the light" and
were laying down their Judaism, or their wicked ways, and had
come to the "true" path. Two thingsI though that were conflated
in this production were being evil and being Jewish. Oh please. I

shouldn't even have to mention that, other than theRomans, ALL
of the people in the story were Jewish, even our man the messiah.
However, in thisproduction, I saw aclear delineation being made
between theBad Jews (the evil ones with masks) and the good
"Christians," those who followed Jesus. The latter weren'treally
Jewish as evidencedby the fact that they were eating bread at the
Last Supper. This is revisionist history and faulty and dangerous
simplistic theology. And I definitely shouldn't have to mention
that crucifixion was a Roman form of execution. It was the
Romans who killed Jesus, not the Jews. The Jews had their own
form of capital punishment, stoning, so if we had really killed
him, Christians wouldbe wearing rocks insteadof crosses around
their necks. Even the Catholic Church, the original European
Jew-killing machine (although of course I am not saying that all
people who identify as Catholic support Jew-slaughter or are
even anti-Jewish for that matter), absolved the Jews of responsibility for the deathof Jesus in the second Vatican Council in the
late 19605,thankyou very much. Frankly, I never understoodthis
whole "Christ-killer" thing anyway. I mean, where would Christianity be if Jesus had lived to a ripe old age and died in a
retirementhome? If someone wantsto think we killed Jesus, they
should be thankful. But I digress. The point is, Jews are not evil
and it is irresponsible, morally offensive, and justplain ridiculous
to portray us that way. The people who put this show together
need to realize this portrayal is occurring within the context of a
campus that is not the most Jew-friendly place I've ever been. In
spite of the fact that there are a lotof people that to one degree or
another identify as "Jewish,"l experience that Jewishpresence on
this campus as being very minor, and there is a lot ofand-Jewish
sentiment and activity that goes unaddressed. Every year, that I
have been here, there have been many instances where students
have seen swastikas drawn on desks, spray-painted on buildings,
mostrecently in the men's bathroom in Beardsley with the note
"Jews go home" written next to it Just where the "home"
mentioned is, I am not sure (Brooklyn perhaps? Far be it for me
to try to place myself in the mind of an Anti-Jewish bigot), but the

point is that Anti-Jewish sentiment and activities are not some faraway thing that happen only in Germany or Coeur d'Alaine,
Idaho. They are here among us—something thatI and other Jews
live with on a daily basis.
"Jesus Christ Superstar" is itself very anti-Jewish, behind
even the Catholic Church's official doctrine, and I find that sad.
It has always been a struggle for me when I liked things that I
knew were anti-Jewish, and this musical was no exception. We all
deal with that in our own ways, and I know that there were Jews
involved in this production,as well as in the original production
(which I find sad, thatfor all I know a Jew couldhave writtenthis
production!). I am not trying to establish one "Jewish" way of
perceiving this musical, I am speaking as the Jew that I am,
pointing out the anti-Jewishness I saw and affirming the experience of the other Jews to whom I have spoken who have experienced it too. I am not being "too sensitive," how could I be too
sensitive to a prejudice I live? We are very worth speaking up
about With the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising
(April 19) lam reminded of what is at stake in speaking the truth
about prejudice we face.
I also feel conflicted about focusing on the anti-Jewish-ism
I experienced in this show and not the misogyny I also saw. Again
I am speaking as the womon I am, and not positing a monolithic
"woman's" response. I was disturbed at how often womyn on
stage were sexualized, and that that was a major way in which
they expressed their characters. One example is King Herod's
straddling Jesus while singing "I'm dying to be shown that you
are not just any man." This also raised the question for me of
where I as a lesbian am supposed to place myself in that heterosexual construct? I'd say the answer is I'm not.

Anonymous Note Shows Sexual Harassment
To the Editor:

1/2 x 2/3 x 1/10 x 1/100 ■ 1/3000

My roommate and I found this
note on our door, next to a postcard
which reads:
Women constitute half the
world's population, perform nearly
two-thirds of its work hours, receive one tenth of the world's income, and own less than one hundredth of the world's property.
We decided to leave the following response on the doorof the
men's bathroom on our hall:
To whoever left the note on our
door:
You are a SEXIST PRICK and
worth about 1/3000 of a RAT'S
ASS!
-Gayle and Mel
Our RA removed our note from
the bathroom door, suggested that
whoever left the initial note should
apologize to us, and offered to mediate.Four days later the following
letter was attached to our door:

further silenced by the possibility
that the writer might be watching
me and enjoying my discomfortand
anger, and the attention being given
to him.
His anonymity is all the more
frightening given the personal tone
ofhis attacks against me (and/or my

my roommate) "a beautiful young

that I "dislikemen;" and by stating
that my "disdain for the male sex

He conflates an anti-sexist attitude
with irrationality and hatredof men
(an accusation which is constantly
hurled at women who havenon-male

to subordinate themselves to men).
As a woman of color, I am

Countries have meddled in other

week, we will examine theproblem of
in a world of dwindling resources
where should the United States' emphasis be—international or domestic
affairs? I intend to argue that our
emphasis should be on the international, not the domestic.
Before I proceed, several things
need to be clarified. One could argue
very effectively that taking either extreme is detrimentalto a society. Both
domestic and foreign affairs are
equally important In a perfect world,
this would be true and I agree that we
should emphasize both spheres. However, within the constraints of this
argument, we must make a choice. I
do not intend to state that a nation
shouldcompletely ignore international
or domestic affairs in favor of the
other. For the sake of argument,
though, I necessarily argue the extreme cases.
Why an

international focus?

P.S. Thank you toWinnie and HyeonJu (the only good WA's I've ever had) for
writing this letter with me.

The U.S. Has Responsibilities to Its Citizens
by LIGEIA JENNIS
Throughout this column Ms.
Wu and I have discussed the rights
and responsibilities of the internationalcommunity while, all the time,
tacitly assuming that the U.S. would
play a major role in policing the
community at large as well as the
individual offenders. There can be
littledoubtthat historically America
has indeed held this position in the
world community. What are the
U.S.'s particular responsibilities
now, though? Specifically, how do
we, asAmericans, find the authority
to go about policing others when
our own country isfar fromperfect?
Put differently, since we in
America have our own problems of
citizen representation and respect,
should we forever go abroad to pro-

tect other citizens? Do we have the
right to hold other people up to a
standard that we, ourselves, cannot
meet? That is the focus of this
week's column. The question can
really be divided into two issues.
First, do we have the right to act for
others? Second, is it wise for us to
act for others when our own people
need help?
The first question is really, I
believe, too simplistic. Anyone has
the right to stop an injustice or, at
least, give the struggle an honest
try. We, as good world citizens,
should be fair in our judgment before calling something unjust and
we must ask if our actions will really bring about the desired effect
but, beyond this, right is never really an issue. If we truly believe that
something is wrong we almost have

the responsibility, if it is within our
means, to do something to stop the
injustice. Otherwise, by our lack of
action, we are giving tacit approval
to the wrongs.
The more interesting facet of
this argument lies in thesecondquestion. Is it wise for us to act? Now,
if everything wereperfect we would
have the resources to end all the
world's problems. But, quite sadly,
this isn't the case. Whatever resources we use to help others are
then unavailable for our own needs.
If theU.S. were the perfect nation, a
place with equality of opportunity
and justice, this wouldbe an unnecessary discussion. Unfortunately,
the U.S. is hardly perfect. I'd still
rather live here than anywhere else
in the world but that doesn't mean

part of"a capitalistic society such as
ours." His proselytizing tone continues with his criticism ofmy "foul
language" and lack of courtesy. Finally, the author accuses me of being "unwilling to compromise" and
creating an "intolerant atmosphere;"
yet the authorrefuses to engage in a
face-to-face dialogue and leaves me

I am writing this letter to validate the emotions I am feeling, and
which I know that many other
women have felt—because this is
by no means an isolated incident.
Similar cases of anonymous notes
and otherforms ofharrassment are
so often not reported, discussed, or
even brought up as issues for legitimate concern. In this particular case,
many people have told me not to
take it so seriously, to ignore it, or to
treat it as a practical joke. Maybe it
was intended as one, but to me it is
not a joke. This is harrassment and
it affects my safety and my life.

to its own domestic problems. In
terms of basic psychology, if one can
empower others, one cannot help but
to empower oneself. The U.S. has

domestic problems, but currently the
U.S. is not capable of mending those
problems in anisolationist setting. As
strange itmay sound, we need to recognize and tackle the problems that
other people experience before we
can take that knowldge and turn a
criticaleye to theproblems within the
U.S.
It is not an easy thing to sacrifice
one's comfort in order to give comfort
to another. However, it sometimes
becomes the most necessary thing to
do in order to help another whose
level of comfort is so much less than
your own. I leave you with one last
thought. The inscription at thebase of
the Statue of Liberty gives an implicit
promise that the U.S. will take care of
those who live abroad if they seek
help. People in the world are seeking
our help; we cannot turn our faces
away from them. As the remaining
superpower the U.S. has a responsibility to do whatit can to help the rest
of the world.
As much as we cannot neglect
those who live within theU.S., within
the U.S. there are community, state,
and federal systems of support that
can be utilized and relied on to take
care of domestic U.S. Other nations
lack this safety net.

know it can, and should, be.
The problem arises, since I have
already said that I think the U.S. is
obligated to help others who truly
are in need, when the affairs of
others are used as a distraction. We
rightly congratulate ourselves for
the help we provide in many pivotal
instances but then manage to forget
the cases of American injustice
which we let occur unchecked. We
focus on feeding the starving millions of miles away while our own
people go hungry. The difference is
a photo opportunity. The difference
is the placement of priorities.
I agree that Americans have to
think of themselves as citizens of
the world, mutually dependent on
other nations. I admit that part of
this citizenship is the responsibility
to act for our neighbors. The problem is that we must also remember
our own country. The first priority,
it seems to me, should be our own
nation. Then comes theworld. Our
own people must be taken care of
before we can adopt any more. And
really, 1 think the adoption analogy
is a good one.
A responsible parent makes
certain that he can provide for his
existing children before taking on
the responsibility of more. This
doesn't mean he won't step forward
if his next door neighbor's child is
in danger. He will. The point is how
often and for what sort of reasons.
Additionally, a responsible parent
will accept the help ofother parents
if he alone cannot effect a miracle.
When has the U.S. allowed other
nations to interfere in its affairs?
Summary? The days of the
U.S. playing parent to the world are
over and rightly so. There is a
happy medium between entire isolationism and complete internationalism. Or, even beyond this, being
an internationalist does not mean
ignoring your own country. For too
long theU.S. has done just this. We
had a glowing international record,
or so many politicians have claimed,
and so we allowed ourselves to forget the internal problems. We took
on the role of Big Daddy and must
now try to be just one of many
parents at a PTA meeting, each concerned primarily with their own
childrenbut also willing to improve
the entire system.

They Swim, They Creep, They Crawl: Campus Pets
by AMANDA

ROCQUE

Recently, while a first-year student and his roommate were busy
rearranging theirroom, Cool Hand
Luke escaped. Luke, a furry, brown
guinea pig named after Paul
Newman's character in themovie of
that same name, had been roaming
the student's room on his daily exercise walk when he darted out of
the room. After a five hour search
for the rascally rodent, the two students finally retrieved the guinea
pig, which had been hiding out under a neighboring student's bed.
One might thinkthattraumatic
episodes such as this one would
warn overly eager animal lovers to
think twice before bringing a pet
into a dorm. Nevertheless, the results of an intense cross-campus
search have concluded that many
students deliberately choose to break
school rules by housing animals in
their dorm rooms. In exchange for
this blatant disregard for school
rules, the loyal companionship that
only a pet can bestow.
For example, Garfieldis a beautiful tabby cat who resides in his
luxurious dormroom during the day.
This affectionate pet, who has a
habit of snuggling into laps, is the
perfect antidote for the stressed-out
Swarthmore student. In fact,
Garfield's owner says that the best
benefit to living with a pet is that
"there is always something to look
forward to when I walk into my
room."
One junior, who recently gave
away a ferret named Karma, agreed
that the best thing about keeping a
pet was "to come out of a seminar
and have something fun to play with
back at the room." The nine-inch
ferret, which was fed a special brand
of cat food, was allowed to run
around the dorm room at all times,

repeat offense will cause thestudent

one student, it is thisrisk of jeopardizing future housing that dters him
from getting apet for his dormroom.
The college is well aware that
there are animals currently living in
many dorms across campus. However, it is impossible for the administration to police dormrooms. Without full cooperation from student
RA's, Goundie cannot remove pets
and heclaims that "some [RA's] are
better enforcers than others."
Perhaps one reason for the
abundance ofanimals on campus is
the close proximity of a local pet
store in Media. Two students regularly travel to the store to pick up
crickets to feed their pet, Schempy
the Scorpion. Cool Hand Luke and
Karma the Ferret were also purchased at this store called Hooked
on Pets on Baltimore Pike.
Of course, many students do
not actually buy theirpets, but pick
up stray animals who need a warm
and loving environment. Last year,
two students shared their Willets
dorm room with a stray dog named
Nuprin for his yellow color. According to one of the students, by
alerting the properauthoritiesabout
the temporary living situation, they
were allowed to keep Nuprin for a
week until they finally found his
owner.
Of course, for many, the rewards that pets bring outweigh the
possible punishments. "It is so nice
to come home to something warm
in the winter," says one enthusiastic
cat owner. "But the best thing ofall
is going to sleep with my cat
snuggled next to me on the foot of
my bed."

Everyday Lacks Ordinary Sound
by BEN BOOTH
Widespread Panic, the Athens,
GA-based messiahs of spaced out,
countryish,psychedelically-tinged,
acid-drenched groove music, released their third album, Everyday,
on theCapricorn label last week. I
have only listened to it about thirty
or forty times since last Tuesday, so
I hope this review seems pertinent.
Perhaps you remember Panic from
their blistering show at Haverford
in February. I couldn't hear for
three days after standing next to the
right speaker column at that show,
which saw the group ripping up
some older stuff along with a few
cuts off the new album. And maybe
you checked them out when they
stole the show at the HORDE tour
last summer with friends Phish and
Aquarium Rescue Unit Panic headlined the HORDE show in Atlanta
in front of 14,000people, a slightly
larger crowd than the Haverford
concert

Down South, Panic is the law.
Michael Hughes, program director
at WKLS-FM Atlanta, remarks,
"Here in the South, we're as proud
of Widespread Panic as we are of
Georgia peaches, Atlanta getting the
'96 Olympics, and the Atlanta
Braves." Those are some powerful
words.
Everyday, like its predecessors
Space Wrangler (1988) and Spread
theWord(l99 l), is poweredthrough
foe pumping rhythmsectionof Dave
Schools on six-stringed and acoustic bass, ToddNance on drums, and
Domingo "Sunny" Ortiz on various
Pwcussion instruments. Musical
prodigy Ben Vigoda '95 hasrepeatreferred to Schools, Nance and

Ortiz as "the greatest rhythm section EVER." No argument here.
Schools plays the bass like it is a
natural extensionof his body. Plus,
he's so much fun to watch. Each
and every Panic song has a fat bass
line that physically forces you to
dance, or at least to do your best
imitation.
Vocalist and rhythm guitarist
John Bell has noticeably improved
his vocalrange, and he continues to
write great lyrics. Guitarist Mikey
Houser relentlessly pounds his droning, acidic guitarinto your eardrums.
On this album, he lets his blues
roots show more often than on previous albums, with also a bit more
country technique. I personally enjoy his acoustic playing more than
his electric, and luckily thereis more
of that on Everyday than on Spread
the Word. JoJo Hermann rounds
out the sextet on Hammond B-3
organ (the coolest instrument ever
invented?) and piano. Hermann is
new to the band on this album, but
he has toured with Panic on their
Eternal Tourfor over a year, and has
already been nominatedfor Georgia keyboard player of the year.
Matt Mundy of Aquarium Rescue
Unit sits in on mandolin on the jazzfusion meets Southern rock beauty
"Pickin' Up the Pieces."
Every song is a masterpiece of
crescendoing guitar, subtle changes
and firm beats, with ample time for
each memberof the group to stretch
out his improvisational skills.
Schools especially seems to control
each song and takes it where he
wants to go. It is a natural Panic
effect to rapidly change the pace of
the song several times within the
piece, and Schools is in total con-

trol. This is especially evident on
"Hatfield" and the organ-fueled, fiery chorusof"Henry Parsons Died."
On other songs, the percussionists
take off, featuring Ortiz who runs
off with the epic "Papa's Home"
and the eerie "Dream Song."
The two gems of thealbum are
"Diner," with its strong imagery,
spaced out metal guitar and Steely
Dan-esque beat, and the beautiful
"Pilgrims," the only song on the
album written during the recording
sessions. Of all the tracks, "Pilgrims" most closely resembles the
Space Wrangler-em Panic ofacoustic melodies and rolling snares.
"Wondering" is the first single off
the record, and showcases Bell's
ability at creating short, profound
lyrical verses.
All in all, Everyday is yet another classic album from Widespread Panic. Like its predecessors,
itis hard-hitting andrelentless, never
ceasing its sonic intentions. It actually takes energy to listen to the
"heavy mellowness" of Panic. I
won't fool myself or you by attempting to scale Everyday in terms
of their other two records, because
they are all excellent. Their sound
keeps evolving, making each record
in its own right always soundfresh.
However, Everyday does have a certain vitality to it My copy only ran
me $ 16.99. Lasting exactly 60minutes (coincidence?), Everyday is
prime materialfor listening 24 times
a day, everyday.
And I hope that all of your
stereos go up to 11, because that's
where this album was meant to be
played. Well, a new brand of funk
called WidespreadPanic is justabout
ready to kick your ass.

Please Pass the Matzoh and Butter

Swarthmore
Jabberwocky

Swat Students Enjoy the Passover Holiday
Gauchman.
There was an option for those who decided to stay on campus as well. There was a
large turnout at a seder run by RUACH religious advisor Marjone Berman. Dan Doneson
'93 was more impressed with the service than
he expected. "It was pleasantly surprising.
There was a good balance of traditional and
modern ideas, as it dealt with both a political
freedom theme and the idea of a communal

memory."
Wherever people chose to celebrate the
holiday, all enjoyed the chance to participate
in their favorite part of the service. Wendy
Weiner '94 listed one of the most commonly
loved aspects of Passover, "the FOOD", especially the matzoh ball soup. Others liked the
end of the service, when traditional songs are
sung. Dan Oppenheim' 96picked hisfavorite
songs, "'Dayeinu' (It would have been
enough) and 'Had Gadya' (One Goat), because I love trying to get through theend verse
without taking a breath."
Salamon finds the discussion of the issues raised during the seder to be stimulating.
"I like the intellectual aspect of the night, the
discussion of the interpretation of texts."
Gauchman finds it to be a time whenshe feels
close to Judaism. She said that she "loves the
fact that we read about what it means to be
Jewish and it makes me feel good about my
religion."
The main disadvantage for many this
week will be finding enough to eat on campus. Far from our parents' matzohbrie (matzoh with eggs) and farfel (matzoh cooked
with mushrooms and onions), we face only
matzoh in Tarble and Matzoh and butter in
Sharpies. Oppenheim tries to have a positive
attitude, "Well, thematzoh's great eventhough
there isn't much else." There is also studentrun kosher kitchen for those who crave substantial food during this week. I certainly
love the atmosphere of Passover, but I can't
wait until Ruach's pizza party next Tuesday
night!

Dear Sick ofPseudo Hendrix,
Is it worth it to end a friendship
over an annoying habit? Obviously
your friend is someone very comfortable with their musical bent. Maybe
you could sit downand talk again. If all
else fails go psee psych pservices.

Dear Wise Women,
My hair had turned dingy blond
overthe winter. How do I transform my
hair back to it's former sunny beauty?
-Dishwater Blond
Dear Dishwater Blond,
The best home remedy is to subtly
encourage nature to highlightyour ugly
hair. To give the sun a gentle push, try
spritzing a fine mist oflemon juice into
your hairbefore you go out into the sun
(Parrish Beach is a great placefor this).
Make sure the lemon juice is
unsweetened, otherwise damage to the
hair shaft might occur. Also be sure to
condition well afterwards since lemon
juice tends to dry out your hair.
Sincerely,
The Three Wise Women

Dining in Philly: When Belly Dancers Just Aren't Enough
The Middle East Restaurant Couples Mediocre Food With Exotic Entertainment
The Roving
Gourmets
by DANIEL KAMIN and SOPHIA LEE
Surgeon General's Warning: The Salt
Content at the Middle East Restaurant May
Be Hazardous To YourHealth!
We opened the door to the Middle East
Restaurant in hopes of finding a meal chock
full of exciting flavors and textures far removedfrom the conventional American cuisine. Although we should have been forewarned by the ceramic camel hanging impressively over the door, we secretly hoped
thatit had a redeeming quality whichenabled
it to stay open for as long as ithad. (According
to the menu, it has been family-owned and
operated at the same location sincethe 50's.)
However, we left with an acute sense of
irony-the Middle East is more good show
than good food, and funny that there should
be a comedy club right upstairs.
Inside is an interesting hodgepodge of
bar room and used art-gallery decor. The
entire room is dimly lit, casting mysterious
and almost lurid shadows on the fez-capped
servers and the kitschy artwork. The walls are
cluttered withlegions ofintricate velvetpaintings and faux tum-of-the-century ink-drawings depicting scenes from the Middle East
The overall atmosphere is that of a good
gangster movie-especially with the cubic
cardtables, heavy brickwalls, and dark, smoky
bar. The informal, family-like dynamic among
the servers, hosts, andentertainment staffalso
contributes to the gangster motif. The cooks
and other staff lounged periodically at the
back tablefor a smoke.
The Middle East offers a large selection
of dishes to choose from. The bar can supply

you with killer cocktails while you munch on nothing to dip into or spread. This is about as

flavor. The accompanying lemony greenbeans
were flavorful, but were too salty andabout as
overcooked as the kind in Sharpies' vats.
Dessert consisted of the best and the
worst of what the Middle East has to offer.
TheTurkish coffee was simply sexy-imagine
a very dark brew of thick, sweet, dizzyingly
powerful coffee served in demitasse cups.
However, do not try consuming the sludge at
thebottom. For dessert, we chosefrom a large
silver pastry platter, whichcontained baklava
and about two other kinds of pastry. We
ordered two pieces of pastry-baklava and a
bun filled with a semolina-honey-cinnamonpine nut mixture. Both were chores to get
through. The baklava was cold and completely uncrispy. Although the filling was
nicely infused with cinnamon, there was no
honey syrup around, so naturally it had become dried out. Even worse was the bun's
status. The filling had just the right amount of
sugar, and the pine nut/cinnamon flavor was
intriguing, but after many days of excessive
exposure, the thing had solidified into a formidable block. It would have been better for
us to bring it home and use it as a door stop.
So, thefood is not so hot at the Middle

of the way through our meal, two musicians
began playing sensuous music with a guitar

came gyrating downthe stairs and played the
finger bells to the rhythm of the music. She
snakedher way around the tables and onto the
red-lighted dance floor, where she shook to
seductive Middle Eastern tunes. Rachma's
sizzling performance, as well as the stimulating music and the caffeine from the Turkish
coffee, made us want to climb on top of the
tableand dance as well. However, we paid and
left before we did anything we would regret

Trees: Plant, Climb, & Learn 'Em!
by REBECCA YAHM and
LISA MOSCA
Arbor Day originally came
from Nebraska, where J. Sterling
Morton spread agricultural information andbis enthusiasm for trees
to his audience. He advocated tree
planting for aesthetic reasons, to
keep the soilfrom eroding, for fuel,
and for shade. Morton became
secretary of the Nebraska Territory
andonJan.4,lB72 he proposed the
first tree-planting holiday to be
called "Arbor Day."
At thefirst Arbor Day on April
10,1872m0re than onemilliontrees
were planted in Nebraska. In 1885,
Arbor Day was named a legal holiday in Nebraska and April 22,
Morton's birthday, was selected as
the date for its permanent observance.
Today, "Arbor Day" isflexible
throughout theU.S. and other countries, depending on goodtree-planting weather for the area.
This year the Scott Arboretum
will be celebrating Arbor Day on
Saturday, April 24th from 10 am to
2 pm. Everyone is invited to participate. Some of the events are as
follows:
10-12 & 12-1 Tree seedling
planting ofnative trees in the Crum.
11:15 & 1:15 Tree climbing
show by the arboretum crew.
10-11& 1-2 Leaf rubbing for

kids
Free seedlings go to the first
100 participants, so get out there
and plant some trees. As Morton
noted, "Other holidays rest upon the
past. Arbor Day proposes for the
future... How much more enduring
are the animate' trees of our own
planting."
This is also an opportunity to
leam about the tree species native
here.
Special thanks to the Arboretum for me above information. For
a more detailed schedule of Arbor
Day events or questions, contact
Kris Benarcik at 328-8025.
And if youfeel motivated and
want tocelebrateArbor Day at other
places in the area, off-campus Collin
Yost (829-1760) of Greencorp
Philadelphia is looking for volunteers to help with a cleanup and treeplanting in Philly on the24th. Also,
"Chester Clean and GreenDay "is
happening in Chester on the 24th
and the city is looking for volunteers to help clean up and plant
trees. CallLisa Mosca 328-2634 or
Dave Hochschild x 8385 for more
information.
Whichever events you choose,
Arbor Day is a great time to play
outside, get your hands dirty, and
add some more green, growing, carbon-dioxide-using, oxygen-producing life to the world around you.
Don't miss it!

Baseball Wins Three of Four to Take Conference Lead
by SAM VOOLICH
The Swathmore College
Baseball team started off the week
with a bang only to have the week
cut short by rain. The 'wild' nine
hadits best week of the season, as it
won three of its four games and
moved into a first place tie in the
MAC Southeast. The 'wild' nine
swept Washington College in a
doubleheader on Monday, and then
pounded Stockton State on
Wendesday. The only loss came on
Thursday to ElizabethtownCollege,
which was ranked in the national
pre-season top 20 and is currently
15-4. On Saturday, Swat was suppose to play arch-rival Haverford at
home only to have the game postponed until Monday at 1 o'clock.
On Monday, the "wild" nine
traveled to Washington College for
a doubleheader with only thirteen
players and four pitchers. These
games were being madeupfrom the
previous weekend, and many of the
players had classes and labs they
had to attend and decided to place
school aheadofbaseball. In the first
game, the Garnet starting pitcher
was Chuck Hudson '96, who, without his best stuff, was able to keep
Swarthmore in the game until the
batterscould openup the lead, much
to the surprise of the pitching coach
who kept saying throughout the
game "I am not happy, I just don't
like theway he is throwing." It was
a onerun gameuntil the sixth inning
when Art Selverian '93 slammed a

threerun home run to put the Garnet
up 6-2. The 'wild' nine held on for
a 6-4 win as JeffJohnson '93 picked
up the save. Chuck Hudson got the
win and in doing so became thefirst
freshman in the past ten years to win
a league game.
hi the second game, the Garnet
brought Jeff Johnson right back as
the starter. In this game the bats
came alive and the 'wild* nine
jumped out to a 9-3 lead and ended
up winning 9-5. The big highlight
ofthegame came whenMatt 'lhave
never hit a homerun in my life*
Holtman '94 hit what appeared to
be a three run homerun. The only
problem was the umpire called it
foul, much to his dismay, and he
still remains homerless.
The Garnetreturned with a full
squad for Wednesday's game and
went out and scored three quick
runs in the first and never let up as
they pounded Stockton State. Chip
Chevalier '93 pitched five strong
innings to get the win, and Eric
DeLue '93 and Kirk Daulerio '95
followed with two strong innings
each. The offensive hero was Ben
Montenegro '93 who scored five
runs.
Thursday's game against
Elizabethtown was a wild game on
and off the field. On the field
E-Town jumped out to a 6-0 lead,
and looked to be cruising. The only
problem was the Garnet would not
give in as Chuck Hudson, Gene
Lamb '94, and Kirk Daulerio came
in to shut the door and give the

batters an opportunityto score some
runs. Before the'wild'nine could
push any runs across there was some
craziness going on off the field.
Some Swarthmore woman, who
seemed to be enjoying the beautiful
weather, was walking naked with a
backpack to Mary Lyons. John
Crawford '93, who was batting at
the time, was so distracted that he
watchedstrike three goright by and

was still shaking his head when he
got to the bench. In the eighth
inning, the Garnet finally scored as
the three runs were pushed across.
In the bottom of the ninth inning,
Ben Montenegro came up with men
on first and second, and preceeded
to hit a bomb over the leftfielder's
head, only to be thrown out at third.
Both runs scoredbut the 'wild' nine
fell short and lost 6-5.

This wild week ended with a
whimper as the rains came, and the
baseball team was able to takeEaster
weekend off. But they will lace the
cleats up and prepare to battle

is important to league leading Garnet Come support the'wild'nine,

Unfortunately, Webber's timeout may further engrain these ideas

a fair characterization.

this week's issue of Sports Illustrated, there's an excellent descriptionofWebber's post-game state by
WilliamF. Reed, as he walked from
the locker room, through a corridor
of the Superdome, to the team bus.
Reed writes:
"He lumbered on with a slight
limp, a can ofcoke in his left hand,
his equipment bag slung over his
right shoulder, a baseball cap pulled
low on hisforehead. Then, justafter
passing some fans who yelled,

"That's all right, Chris!' and' Hang

wrapped in thefamiliar arms ofhis
father, Mayce, and one of his

"And there Chris stopped. He

heaving. His family rubbed hisback

Unfortunately, that is how the

Men's Lacrosse Falls to Haverford, Record Drops to 5-3
by BEN SEIGEL
This past week the men's lacrosse team took its 4-1 record into
two games versus teams from Maryland, St. Mary's and Washington
College. Then, on Saturday they
traveled to Haverford to play their
biggest rival in a rain drenchedgame.
At week's end the record
stands at 5-3 after a thrilling 9-8
victory over St. Mary's, and a tough
loss to the Shoremen, who are ranked

4th in the nation and may win the
Division HI title. The team dropped
a tough one to Haverford, 17-11,
who has not been beaten by Swat in
three years.
The game against St. Mary's
last Saturday was played on a mud
pit at Cunningham Field. To make
matters worse, the field had been
covered with a putrid-smelling layer
of manure in order to alleviate the
already awful conditions. Despite
these obstacles, both teams came

out to play. In the early going the
players realized that a transition
game would be difficult to capitalize on due to the thick layers of mud
that stuck to cleats, and slowing the
midfieldersdown. Swat came out of
the blocks in a speedy fashion, taking a 4-1 lead. However, St. Mary's
was able to fight back to make it a 5
4 contest at halftime. Swat gave up
its three goal lead, but they were still
leading by one at the half.
The secondhalf was fairly even,

with St. Mary's fighting hard. By
the fourth quarter St. Mary's was
able to take an 8-7 lead over the
Garnet. However, Swat refused to
die. With less than three minutes
remaining, Ben Seigel '96 picked
up a feed from captain Greg
Ferguson '93, and put theball in the
goal for his third goal of the day, to
tie the score at eight. Then, a few
plays later, captain Kevin Bewley
'93 took on the entire St. Mary's
defense to score the winning goal,
also his third of the day. Swat was
able to hold off a last minute St.
Mary's surge to win the game 9-8.
Swat made a strong all around
showing in this game against a solid
St Mary's team that had lost to
Division 111 Top 20 contender
Lynchburg 15-11. In a day filled
with distracting outside elements
due to the field conditions, Swat
once again showed their pride and
desireby coming back to win after
being behind in the final quarter (as
they had done against Dickinson).
GoalieTim Gasperoni '95 also made
a strong showing with 29 saves as
the backbone of the zone defense.
Swarthmore was also able to pull of
the victory with key players on the
sideline due to injuries, including
leading scorer Sandy Watkins '93
and Cooper Ritchy '95 and Andy
Petusky '94.
On Wednesday, the outcome
was not as promising against Washington College. Washington College came into the game fired up.
The game before they beat Drew
only 17-12; the same team thatSwat
beat 13-7 earlier in the season. The
Shoremen did not miss a beat on

Wednesday. They evenrippeddown
their own net in pre-game shooting
practice. Washington came at the
menacing Swat zone with a 1-4-1
configuration which kept the ball
moving quickly and opened up cutters who were able to finish their
opportunities. The final score was
25-4, butkeep in mind thattheWAC
beat 10thranked Cortland State 189 a week ago.
Against Haverford both teams
came out fired up and ready to play.
The Fords, however, came out a bit
stronger, taking an early 4-0 lead.
Swat fought back, though, to take a
5-4 advantage, and then fell behind
at halftime, 11-6. Among torrential
downfalls, Swat was unable to fight
back and lost to Haverford 17-11.
Haverford was able to take the
game by controlling the ground balls
and capitalizing on the transition,
avoiding Swat's settled zone. The
bitter rivalry between the two
schools called for a very violent
game, full of menacing hits. The hit
of the game goes to defenseman
Mark Fink '95, who annihilated a
Haverford midfielder in the center
of the field. The Ford, who had no
idea what hit him, was lucky to even
stand up and drag himself off the
field.

game, in which the young Buzzards
gained valuable experience, was
highlighted by a bone crushing hit
by Dave Hochschild'93, strong running by the backs and some good
rucking by the pack.
