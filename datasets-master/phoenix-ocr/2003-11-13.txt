Napster to provide free music for Penn State
University to provide students with access to legal, digital music
BY RYAN CROKEN

rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

In an attempt to give students a legal
way to download music from the Internet,
Penn State University signed a deal Nov. 6
with Napster that will provide the university's on-campus students with free access
to the online music service.
Napster, once the leader in peer-to-peer
MP3 trading, has been shut down since
July 11, 2001. Its owners, Roxio Inc.,
launched Napster 2.0 on Oct. 29. The new
service is modeled after Apple's successful
iTunes Music Store, where users pay 99
cents to download one song or around $lO
per album.
As the reborn Napster tries to compete
with Apple's store, it has reached out to
colleges and universities across the country in a move that could alleviate the
strains peer-to-peer transfers place on
campus networks and potential virus
threats. Penn State became the first university to announce a deal with Napster
for the coming spring. As next semester
will serve as a trial run for Napster in the
world of higher education, where many
students constantly search for new music,
college computer administrators will be
keeping an eye on the experiment to see
how it pans out.
Administrators at Swarthmore have not
yet begun an official discussion of potential
solutions to the peer-to-peer file sharing
phenomenon that has recently overloaded
and infested the campus computer system,
according to Robin Jacobsen, manager of
client services at ITS. As a temporary solu-

tion, ITS has blocked peer-to-peer file sharing indefinitely, but it is exploring other
possibilities.
"We're looking into this," Jacobsen
said. "It's only been four of us really talking about this issue here, and mostly it's
just been coffeepot chatter so far."

An end to legal battles?
Penn State president Graham

Spanier

announced the university's decision in
Anaheim, Calif., at this year's Educause
meeting, an annual consortium of thousands of information technology adminis-

trators. The announcement marked the
culmination of over a year of official problem-solving strategies designed to legally
and safely provide students with music,
said Sam Haldeman, special assistant to
the associate vice provost of information
technology at Penn State.
"This will be the first step in a new,
legal approach designed to meet student
interest in getting extensive digital access
to music," Spanier said in a Napster press

release.
Napster's arrangement with Penn State
offers students access to a music library of
over 500,000 songs, but only in the form of
tethered or streaming downloads. In order
to burn CDs or transfer music files to a
portable player students must pay a 99cent fee per song. Students will also have
access to six decades of Billboard data, an
online magazine and 40 Internet radio stations, Haldeman said.
Penn State's willingness to sign a deal
with Napster has also stemmed from the
legal problems that arise from peer-to-peer

transfers. As a direct result of students'
peer-to-peer file sharing usage, Penn State
has been served numerous takedown
notices, warning the university that stu-

dents have been violating copyright policy
by downloading illegal music, software or
videos, Haldeman said.
"We couldn't keep lying to ourselves
that this wasn't going on and that people
weren't getting hurt," Haldeman said. "We
needed to find some sort of solution. For us
not to do something about it would have
been a serious problem."
Haldeman said Penn State would pride
itself on this program, and show it off to
prospective students. He predicted other
colleges and universities would take notice

and begin to implement programs of their
own.
"It will set a trend that many of the
other universities around the country, and
maybe even the world, will follow,"
Haldeman said.
California Rep. Howard L. Berman
issued a statement of praise on the day
that Penn State announced its new program.
"I hope other universities wrestling
with ways to unclog their bandwidth will
adopt the model pioneered by Penn State,"
he said. "By providing their students with
low-cost access to legal music on the one
hand and taking action to stop piratical
activity on the other, universities can
return their bandwidth to the educational
reasons for which it was created."
At Penn State, the Napster contract for
the spring semester will function as a trial
run of the program that will serve 18,000

Students aid ailing staff member
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu
For the past month, Sharpies employee Nazma
Alam has been absent from her post at the card-

checking counter in Sharpies.
Alam is battling terminal liver cancer and has
been hospitalized for the last few weeks. "The doctors say that she has maybe one, maybe three
months left to live," her son Tariq said. "It hurts me
that right now I have 10 days with my mother before
I go and she passes away, but I am thankful for whatever I have. One day is better than no days. Ten days
are better than none."
Tariq, who has been serving as a lieutenant in Iraq
for eight months, received two weeks' emergency

leave when it became clear that his mother's illness
was terminal. He was granted an additional week by
his commanding officer.
Swarthmore students are petitioning Rep. Curt
Weldon to obtain a Hardship/Humanitarian
Discharge for Tariq so that he can be with his mother and family through her last days. In order to get
the discharge, Tariq must be able to show that his
mother is dependent on his presence. Petitioning a
member of Congress is a last-resort step, taken after
a request to one's chaplain and commanding officer
have been denied.
While her son was in Iraq, Alam fasted as an
offering to secure the safety of his platoon, which
may have contributed to her ailing health. Since his
return, she has gained a pound, and "is trying to eat
as much as she can without getting sick," Tariq said.
"It is essential for Nazma's health and spirit that
her son be with her during this time," the petition
stated. "During the time of her son's deployment,

THE PHOENIX

her health declined due to his absence and worry
about his situation; upon his return, while her physical state of health remained unstable, her emotional state improved immeasurably. Lt. Alam's impending return to Iraq is beyond distressing for Nazma
and her family."
Emily Tancredi-Brice 'O4 has spearheaded the
petition effort. "Her spirits were so uplifted when
her son was back," Tancredi-Brice said. Before the
petition, Swarthmore students and faculty had visited Alam in the hospital and delivered bags of cards,
food and Sharpies cakes. One cake featured a photograph of Alam and two of her grandchildren.
"She was so happy to see us," Tancredi-Brice
said, "She had a tear running down her face when
she saw all the stuff we brought."
"The students and staff of Swarthmore have done
more than we could have imagined. Being with her
family and friends and receiving so much support
from the students has given her the willpower she
needs to fight her disease," Tariq said.
Alam received her first chemotherapy treatment
on Tuesday and was unavailable for comment.
Tancredi-Brice, who was Alam's partner in the
Learning for Life program, described her friend as
"quietly radiant, with a warm smile. Her faith is
very important to her."
Alam, who has four children and three grandchildren, "understands and accepts that she is going
to die," Tancredi-Brice said. "We just want to make
the process as peaceful as possible."
As of lunchtime on Wednesday, about 500 students and 20 staff members had signed the petition,
which will be sent to Weldon, who can request that
the military issue an honorable discharge. Alam
has worked at Swarthmore for six years.

on-campus Penn State students on nine different Penn State campuses. If all goes
well, Haldeman said, the university would
seek to negotiate another contract with
Napster that provides service for all 83,000
students on 24 campuses. The cost of the
program will be funded as part of Penn
State's information technology fee that is

already in place, according to the Napster

release.

ITS searches for its own solution

Back at Swarthmore, ITS has turned its
attention to other institutions that are
struggling with controlling rampant file
sharing. According to Jacobsen, ITS is
eagerly monitoring how colleges and universities are handling the peer-to-peer phe-

nomenon.

"We want to be aware of what other
schools are doing so we can see what
would fit best here," Jacobsen said. "It
takes time and research and resources for
something like this. We're still looking for
ways our students can use peer-to-peer
without using it in ways that will be disruptive to our network infrastructure."
Jacobsen said the Penn State-Napster
program seemed somewhat limiting, in
that students would be required to pay to
transfer songs.
"There are many ways to handle this.
We're trying to see if there are other
options out there, the best one for
Swarthmore," she said.

Tri-Co blackface
shocks students
BY DIJON LINDSEY
dHndsey@haverford.eclu

A Halloween party at a Bryn
Mawr dorm has sparked controversy on Bryn Mawr and
Haverford's campuses.
Two white male Haverford
students dressed as pop stars
Beyonce and Macy Gray for the
party at the Rhodes dorm.
Their costumes consisted of
blackface, which was applied
all over their face and body, a
G-string and distinguished
black breasts and butts.
"My first reaction was to
think of minstrel shows," said

it was obvious that
the emphasis was not on their
characters, but more on the big
butts and bare, brown breasts

that they wore, which both
were left uncovered."

"I wasn't shocked when I
heard it happened," Scott
Shepard 'O6 said. "When it

comes to parties, and especially
costume parties, I have seen
some pretty bad stuff. I'm not

Kerry Opalka 'O4, also a
Haverford student, said she

heard about the incident.
Opalka

was not sure of the

intent. "I don't know if it was

think that they didn't take into

consideration how other people
would feel," she said.
The incident is not the first
in recent tri-college history.

Atlantic Monthly ranks
Swarthmore in top 10
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

This time, Swarthmore ended up on top.
In new rankings released in Atlantic
Monthly's November issue, Swarthmore was
ranked the 10th most selective college or university in the country. It was the only liberal
arts college to crack the top 10.

"I really don't look at
rankings. I find them a little
inaccurate."
Eric Parker, prospective
student
Although Dean Bob Gross was happy
about Swarthmore's high rank, he said that
"any set of rankings depends on what criteria are used. Magazines try to do the best
that they can do, but they want to sell their

issues."
The Atlantic Monthly rankings were
based solely on selectivity, determined by a
formula that included admission rate, SAT
scores and class rank of incoming students.
Swarthmore's admission rate of 24 percent was far higher than most other schools
in the top 10, and 6 percent higher than that
of Amherst, which placed 12th.
The difference in criteria explains why
some ranking systems place Swarthmore
above competitors Amherst and Williams
(ranked 19th) and sometimes below them.

International students
to pay additional fee

The purpose of the Atlantic Monthly
rankings was to provide a starting point
for analysis in the accompanying article,
"The Selectivity Illusion." This article
drew attention to many factors which may
affect selectivity which are not commonly
reflected numerically. "Overall, MIT

International Student Adviser Gloria
Evans said the fee, which will be levied
in addition to the $lOO already charged
for most visa applications, is no cause
for concern.
"I think it's been blown out of proportion," she said. "Students probably
were not aware that [the new fee] was

find Swarthmore considerably harder to
get into than MIT," wrote Atlantic Monthly
reporter Don Peck.
Swarthmore students seem aware of
these inconsistencies. "I didn't really like
the way they ranked colleges just based on
selectivity. That doesn't make one school
better than another," Diana Kinker 'O6 said.

Prospective student Eric Parker of
Philadelphia said that "I really don't look at
rankings. I find them a little inaccurate."
Many first-years admitted to using rankings when deciding where to apply, but not
where to go.
"All the schools I applied to were top-tier,
but among those schools I didn't really look
at rankings. I couldn't tell you which one

was better" Rebecca Wilsker 'O7 said.
But Gross said that the rankings would

probably affect admission "more than they
should. Rankings help with a population
less familiar with the college admission
process, like first generation or international students."
MIT was followed in the rankings by
Princeton, the California Institute of
Technology, Yale, Harvard, Stanford,
Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania,
Brown and Swarthmore.

SEVIS was launched in 2002 in
response to the immigration breaches
that led to the Sept. 11 attacks.
Congress initially allocated $3B million
to the system, but it is now a financially independent program
and the
Department

of Homeland

Security

claims the new fee is necessary for the
system to continue operations.
The fee would generate $32 million
annually, according to government lit-

erature.
"Anything you do must be paid for,"
Evans said. "There has been a great
expense in setting up SEVIS. We call
their help desk all the time."
She added that Swarthmore, like
other schools, is periodically visited by

SEVIS inspectors who ensure the college's record keeping is satisfactory.
Most international students at
Swarthmore will not have to pay the
new fee, because it is levied only during the visa application process. The
majority of F-l student visas last for all

four years of study, according to Evans.
There has been outcry on some college campuses in reaction to the new
fee.
At Stanford, editorials in the university newspaper lambasted the proposal, asserting that the fee would
make visa fees prohibitively expensive
for some international students.
But government officials have maintained the fee is a necessary step. "We
are generating thousands and thousands of leads to investigate and no

Hutchinson told reporters this summer. According to DOHS figures published in Federal Computer Week,
SEVIS has denied entry to more than
200 people who falsely claimed to be
students.
International Club President Yavor
Georgiev 'O6, while not thrilled about

the fee, did not plan on challenging it.
"It's a fee," Georgiev said. "It's one
of the things we have to do."
A 60-day window for "comments" on
the new fee is currently in effect, but
Swarthmore will not file any comments
or complaints, Evans said.

About 120 prospective students visited Swarthmore this week as part of the admissions office's
Discovery Weekend for minority students.

Minority specs visit Swat
This weekend, Swarthmore hosted about 120
minority prospective students for Discovery

Weekend.
The weekend included free transportation to
and from Swarthmore courtesy of the admissions
office, an invitation to the college's annual winter
formal, dinner with the admissions deans, lunch
with the faculty and staff and several cultural
events, including a "Talent Explosion."
"Generally, the weekend was a good experience," said prospective student Diana Lin of
Walnut Creek, Calif. "I was able to get a good feel
for the campus, the people and the climate of
Swarthmore."
Suzi Nam, assistant dean of admissions, said the
biggest complaint in the evaluations was the weather, but overall, with the exception of a few minor

logistical problems, everything went smoothly.
Wootae Min 'O7, who hosted five prospective
students, said he thought it would be fun and easy
to host that many students but realized it was difficult to entertain all of them.
"I could pretty much only spend time with
three of my five specs," Min said. "These three
seemed really interested in Swarthmore and are
applying winter early decision, but the other two
are pretty set on other schools."
Nam said the purpose of the weekend was to
reach out to a population that Swarthmore values.
"We wanted to open our doors to allow students to

know about Swarthmore," Nam said. "We wanted
to open eyes and give students an opportunity to
experience

The college pays the cost of travel to
Swarthmore for students who live beyond driving
distance, Nam said.

While no exact figures for the total cost were
available yet, Nam said the college had done its
best to ensure that transportation money was
spent wisely, with students taking the cheapest
travel options available.
Nam said she believed covering transportation
costs encourages more students to attend

Discovery Weekend.

"Thank you so much for this opportunity," a
student evaluation read. "I never would have
been able to come to Swarthmore otherwise."
Nam said she tentatively estimated the cost to
average $lOO per student, a figure that includes
students who drove to Swarthmore without the
the college funding transportation.

On a typical hectic morning, Lisa Übelaker 'O6 manages to fit a shower into her schedule.
But one day, while in the shower, black splotches
appearing in her vision gradually enveloped her sight,
and she blacked out. She recognized it as a sign that she
was fainting, and made a quick call for help before becom-

ing unconscious.
In a separate instance, Anisha Chandra 'O6, an energetic pre-med, fainted this semester during a daytime
activity. Friends say that she had been eating and sleeping, but acknowledged that she had huge time commitments invested in many student organizations and a
demanding major. She spent six hours in the emergency
room, where nothing was found to be seriously wrong.
There's no doubt that extreme stress and exhaustion
can stop even the most resilient student. But the incidence of collapse may be on the rise.

How fainting happens
When students push themselves too hard, their bodies
with their minds, said biology
professor Sara Hiebert Burch.
From a medical perspective, fainting occurs "to get
you down on the ground so your heart doesn't have to
work pumping blood to your brain," Hiebert Burch said.
Low blood pressure, whether it's caused by drinking alcohol or taking a hot shower, makes it harder to transport
blood up.
In addition, lack of sleep decreases the overall
resilience response rate of the autonomic nervous system, the control center for "involuntary stuff like heart
adjustments are a
rate, blood pressure and breathing
little slower" than necessary to compensate for other
changes, like suddenly standing up, Hiebert Burch said.
In other words, when students do not get enough sleep,
they are less able to react to sudden changes and are more
likely to pass out. And students, as a group, are "under-

Psychological Services for Worth Health Center.
The average time college student spend sleeping has
dropped over the past 20 years from 7.5 hours to 6.5 hours,
The New York Times reported in September. In contrast,
the suggested amount of sleep is eight to 9.25 hours a
night.
"Staying up all night is an extraordinary event," and
one which has become "normalized" among college students, Ramirez said.
Although cases of student collapse and fainting are out
of his professional arena, Ramirez said, it is "undeniable
that real stress is a fact of life" here, and "anyone in college is going to be stressed because of the way in which
the work isn't evenly distributed over the semester."

"A lot of times a professor will push

it actually is more than they can.
And when you get four or five

"It's not that things are hard. It's that they expect too
much stuff in too little time," Yaprak Sariisik 'O6 said. "I
think we need more time so we can digest this stuff before
we get other stuff
that we then have to struggle to

Now, after having fainted, Chandra advises other students not to wager their health in the game of life at
Swarthmore. "Do not worry what people think of you,"
Chandra said. "If there is something that is taking it out
of you, just drop it."

she had not noted an increase over the past few years in
student collapse and fatigue. However, there is a correlation between time in semester and student complaints
and fatigue
midterms being the high point as they "hit
you kind of fast," she said. There is variation between the
years, Echols said, and cited the unusually high rate of
fainting during the swim test this August for the class of
2007.
Some alumni have questioned the culture of selfimposed pressure, calling it much more prevalent than in
years past. Allen Cooper '9L now a law student at the
University of Texas, said the pattern is a change from 10
years ago.
"There certainly weren't people fainting in the shower
there wasn't a culture of martyrdom," he said of his fellow students.
The number of students seeking mental health help at
Swarthmore also has increased significantly in the past
decade. Psychological Services reported 2,650 visits last
year
up by 41 percent since 1996, according to their
2001-2002 report. In 2001, seven students were hospitalized
due to psychological reasons. This may mean students
have more mental health issues, or simply that they feel
more comfortable seeking help.

Overall, Goundie said he thinks that students "nap
well here" and "get a lot more sleep than they let on."
But Hiebert Burch, who studies circadian rhythms,
said napping is not a good substitute for a whole night.
"Good health is associated with consolidated circadian
rhythms," and not napping, she said. Even if students
think they successfully shifted their schedule to become
nocturnal or think that a pattern of little sleep and sporadic naps works, it is "just masking the underlying permanent rhythm ... and masking is impermanent."

BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM

Six days of Africa week activities commenced Monday with an opening celebration
in Lang Concert Hall that included an introduction and blessing ceremony. The events
continued later that day with a faculty panel
about U.S. intervention in Africa and an
African dance

performance.

The faculty panel consisted of Swarthmore
history professor Timothy Burke and political

science professor Raymond
Haverford political science professors Harvey
Glickman and Rob Mortimer were also on the

panel.

Each speaker had different views of U.S.
in Africa. Mortimer looked at how

in Africa and how this in turn has hurt

Americans.
Burke pointed out that, while the United
States has no real foreign policy interests in
Africa, what is needed is "involvement, not
intervention."
Hopkins said the United States needed to be
empathetic to the cultures in which it is
involved rather than having "dumb soldiers
using high-tech weapons."
A common theme that emerged from the
debate about future U.S. intervention in Africa
was the extreme importance of an exit strategy, especially given the current situation in

A group of students gathered in the
Science Center Thursday night for a
panel on peace in Korea that featured
speakers John Feffer and Cheong
Wooksik.
Feffer is the author of several
books on globalization and U.S. foreign policy, most recently "Power
Trip: U.S. Unilateralism and Global
Strategy After Sept. 1L" Cheong is a
representative of the Civil Network
for a Peaceful Korea and has written
books and articles on Korea.
Feffer examined North Korea's
alleged possession ofnuclear weapons
and the possibility of a U.S. attack on
the nation.
Feffer said North Korea would
have the motivation to pursue a
nuclear weapons program, since the
United States has only attacked countries without nuclear weapons. But he
added that this may not mean North
Korea actually has them.
Even if North Korea were in possession of nuclear materials, it would
lack the ability to reprocess,
weaponize and deliver the material,
he said.

About 20 students attended the panel. Paul

that, although he thought the talk was good,
he didn't "necessarily agree with all the
points."
Rochelle McLaren 'O6, agreed that while
"many of the points were valid, [there didn't]
seem to be as much of a debate, with an opponent and a proponent."
The goal of Africa week is to raise interest
and awareness of African culture and the
issues affecting the continent, according to

New soulful Albums of the future, today
Synth-pop from The Russian Futurists and a sweet soundtrack
songwriting
BY ROSS HOFFMAN

khoffmal@swarthmore.edu

BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON

bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu
Since the release of her 1997 album "Surfacing," with

memorable hits "Angel" and "Adia," Sarah McLachlan has
faced enormous highs and lows. Her mother passed away
from cancer, only a few months before Sarah gave birth to
a baby girl named India. After six years, inundated with
personal experiences and eager to make more music, she
felt it was time to go back into the studio and express her
thoughts once again. The finished product, aptly titled
"Afterglow," is a
transitional stage
for the singer-songwriter, and she
shows
growth
through her signature melodies, production and haunting lyrics.
This album is a

financial and manufactured obsessions.
What
McLachlan brings
to the table is pure
music for the soul,
laced with soothing
melodies and articulately

woven

Sarah McLachlan
Afterglow
(Arista Records, 2003)

The first single, "Fallen," is a song of reflection. She
says honestly in the second verse, "But we carry on our
back the burdens time always reveals/In the lonely light of
morning/In the wound that would not heal/It's the bitter
taste of losing everything/I've held so dear." Her vivid use
of personification as she tells heaven to "bend to take my
hand" shows her conscious effort to provide a spiritual
connotation to this song, as one can infer that the individual has fallen from the grace of God.
While many songs are introspective, McLachlan
employs a twinge of social commentary in the track
"World on Fire," an obvious response to the situation of
the war and the Sept. 11 tragedy. This song is different
from most depicting these events, because she does not
necessarily preach about the state of the world today.
Rather, she wonders what one is able to do to better the situation, singing, "I'll tap into the water, try and bring my
share/Try to bring more, more than I can handle/Bring it
to the table/Bring what I am able." This song is decidedly
inspiring to action outside of one's self, a point she seems

The Russian Futurists present their sophomore effort,
"Let's Get Ready to Crumble" (28 minutes, 10 tracks) this
month, an album that sounds uncannily like early
Magnetic Fields, reviewed next. These synth-drenched
compositions, (made and recorded at home by one guy,
Torontonian Matthew Adam Hart) combine an appealingly
off-kilter melodic sensibility with playful, convoluted lyrical style in a way that increases the effectiveness of both. I
could quote you some lines (like "I do pop/'cause that's
what my heart goes/I don't call it art, no sir/that
denotes/that when I wrote it/I had other motives," from the
showstopping title track), but they aren't nearly as effective divorced from their disjunct, improbably infectious
melody, not to mention the densely layered, weirdly funky
10-fi drum-machine and synth accompaniment "Precious
Metals" is impossibly cute dance-pop; "It's Actually Going
to Happen" mixes some harmonica in with the synths and
sweetly anticipates a love that will work. Not every song is
as effortlessly buoyant as these highlights, but in all it's a
remarkably solid and lovable little record.
But little. That's OK
the album is so full of detail that
it doesn't wind up feeling short. On the other hand, pushing this under-30-minute "full-length" business a bit too far,
we have IDM/hiphop/emo enfant terrible Cex, following up

can only assume he's moved past the relatively non-illuminating phase documented here. It's not that there's a dearth
of ideas; in fact, the record strikes a nice balance between
the cohesion of early "single-genre" efforts and the stylistic
range of his last album. Cex continues to improve as a producer, offering up some truly compelling textural sculptures, which are noticeably darker than past work, but this
time, at least, he doesn't bring the songwriting skills to
complete the picture. Lyrical tendencies toward nihilism
and self-deprecation, split between confessional soulsearching mode and over-the-top parody (the chorus of the
rappish, catchy "Stop Eating" proclaims: "food is disgusting/it's what they make shit from") are fitting, given the
industrial, almost gothic tone of the disc, but they don't
make for very compelling listening. Cex pours so much
passion into everything he does that his records are always
at least interesting, but (if this is really supposed to be a
full-length) I'd just as soon have waited a few more months
for something more fully developed. But then, I'm sure it
won't be long until his next.

McLachlan has a way of embracing the individual nature
and plight of complete surrender to another in an extremely eloquent way. On the surface, the track "Train Wreck"
seems like a somewhat pejorative way of looking at love.
The relatively upbeat production, particularly in the chorus, shows that surrendering to love can be an enjoyable
experience. Furthermore,

this true meaning shines
through as the listener realizes that the situation she is
speaking of happens frequently in life, thus giving greater
value to her words.
The unequivocal standout track is "The Answer," which
truly gets back to the roots of McLachlan's music. The
piano plays a crucial role in the song's gloomy yet reverent
tone and takes on an acoustic feel that makes it seem more
organic. Her voice is endearing, albeit weary, which also
achieves the mellow mood. All 10 tracks on "Afterglow"
have a distinct message of individuality. Through this and
having the songs intricately woven together through
melody, Sarah McLachlan provides a reflective and pleasurable listen. If there were any indication that there was no
need for "Chicken Soup for the Soul" music, Sarah negates

that mentality with this anticipated album.

the Motion Picture Soundtrack

Stephin Merritt
Pieces of April Soundtrack
(Nonesuch, 2003)

Stephin Merritt hasn't been seen much around these
parts lately. Most folks who were freshmen when he last
graced Olde Club with the Magnetic Fields graduated in
June; their magnum opus "69 Love Songs," whose booklet features a photo of the band comatose in Parrish
Parlours, is now four years old. Apart from an appealing record with the 'Bos-inspired Future Bible Heroes
project, the man I once described as the patron saint of
Swarthmore indie rock has been mostly silent since
then, his prominence in WSRN playlists dwindling
gradually. But that's about to change. A new MagFields
album is due next spring, and, if we can take the short
but tuneful "Pieces of April" soundtrack (27 minutes, 10
tracks) as an indication, it will have been worth the
wait.

Most importantly, it just sounds
richer
beautiful; it's
before.
than anything he's done
Presumably intended as both a stopgap for diehards
and a lure for the Merritt-blind audiences of the sweet
but mediocre film, I find it best to think of the disc as a
generous single for its lead-off track. "All I Want To
Know" easily ranks among Merritt's best work, with its
characteristically infectious, instantly hummable
melody and wistfully wry self-deluding lyrics in the tradition of "I'm Lonely (and I Love It)." Most importantly,
it just sounds beautiful; it's instrumentally richer than
anything he's done before, with chiming, subtly, insistent celli, shimmering zither interjections and group
harmonies underscoring a full, poignant lead vocal.
This is the clear highlight, but the four other new songs
are worthy, vintage Merritt as well, and they share the
newfound sonic fullness of the opener. The remainder
of the album eschews the short, wordless score fragments of Merritt's "Eban and Charlie" soundtrack for a
handful of old tunes
three of the absolute best "69
Love Songs" cuts and a pair from the lackluster Sixths
which make it a
record "Hyacinths and Thistles"
more cohesive "album" but less rewarding for the established fan. So, is it worth it for five new songs? Maybe
wait and see how many of them end up on the album.

INSIDE THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS'

In the end, there is no spoon
Ben Masten says:
All right, it's probably best that I reveal my bias now: I
am not a film critic. I am a great big dork. As that might
lead you to believe, I have a powerful, drooling affection
for all things Matrix. That's not to say I'm without per-

spective. Mostly. I'll readily admit that the Wachowski
brothers' second installment "The Matrix Reloaded" was,
almost unavoidably, inferior to the original flick. But I
liked it anyway. A lot. To the tune of seeing it three times
and even sitting through the god-awful rave scene while
seated between my parents.
So I'll understand if the movie-going public takes it
with a grain of salt when I say that "The Matrix
Revolutions" is an excellent movie, and is, in fact, much
better than "Reloaded." Sit through an uneventful 15 or 20
minutes (which are mostly there just to bridge the gap
between the films), and you'll be treated to a visual and
visceral feast. The Wachowskis have made a movie about
humanity's absolute last stand against insurmountable
odds, and the action sequences in the real world convey a
sense of determined desperation. The machines bent on
humanity's extinction are terrifying in their implacability,
and they rush at the small crunchy humans like a huge
squirming black tsunami that ebbs and flows but never ceases its assault. The intensity of the action builds and builds,
yet it manages not to get stale and repetitive as it did from
time to time in "Reloaded." Each new attack on the human
city of Zion makes it clear: These people are in deep doo-doo.
There's much less stiff pseudo-philosophy in this movie.
Quoting Descartes to a 60-foot robotic squid is a great way to
die.
Also nicely creepy is the multiplicitous Agent Smith
(Hugo Weaving) and his conduit into the real world, Bain,
played by lan Bliss doing what is basically a great Hugo
Weaving impression. (Oh, come on. If you've seen
"Reloaded," you knew that already.) Smith's agenda finally comes to light in "Revolutions," and Weaving and Bliss
clearly enjoy being villainous as they practically ooze from
frame to frame and slowly build to genuinely frightening
moments of barely contained rage.
And now the caveats: If you see the movie and criticize
Keanu Reeves' acting skills, you're wasting your time. He
has none. End of story. Actually, he acts better, as it turns

10

out, with his face hidden from view during a long sequence
towards the end. Deal with it. Also, be aware that reports
of plot holes are not unfounded. There's at least one glaring omission, though many of the others I've heard discussed since the movie came out actually make sense if
you go back and examine the last two movies. By way of a

hint, pay close attention when people start talking about
equations. The ending will make a lot more sense to you.
There are more warnings I could give, but, truthfully,
they haven't changed much since the first Matrix movie.
Don't like action sequences? Stay away. Lulled to sleep by
Morpheus? Sweet dreams. The bottom line is that this is
the final chapter in the most original and, like it or not,
influential movie franchise of our time. It's worth every
cent you pay for tickets, popcorn and goobers.

explained, disconnected events, but, when they look that
cool, who cares? The major death scene is soap-opera melodramatic. Who could really carry on a 10-minute conversation with three pipes stuck through one's gut? Neo's big
fight with Smith made me want to shout, "OK, you know
kung-fu. We get it."

But the battle scenes: wow. The tanks ofZion's artillery
looked like giant transformers, but, when the sentinels
started streaming in through the cave ceiling and they
began to shoot, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Same
thing when Neo approached the machine city later on; the
glowing golden landscape, sheets offire and creepy face he
talked to were just amazing. And, as much as I could have
done without the outfits in the club scene, I'm glad they
brought back the Merovingian. He was one of the better
parts of "Reloaded."
A word of warning to the faint of heart and weak of
stomach: This one's gory. You actually see the dripping
blood, the seared flesh and all the other gruesome details
that they didn't show before. Beware.
So don't expect "The Matrix Revolutions" to be thoughtprovoking like the original or even to make much sense at
all. But, if you're looking to be shocked, awed and thoroughly entertained for two hours, it's worth the $8.50.

Mac Carlson says:

Emily Gasser says:
Is it just me, or does each Matrix sequel seem to have
less plot that the one before it? The first movie was good; it
presented an original "what if?" and left its audience pondering. "Reloaded" was mediocre; it completely dropped
some potentially intriguing plot elements, and what was
with that orgy scene? And last Friday I went to see the long
awaited third movie in the trilogy. My verdict? Visually
stunning but otherwise completely vapid.
"The Matrix Revolutions" has incredible special effects.
Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it. The
Wachowski brothers seem to think mesmerizing us with
glowing cities and swarms of attacking sentinels will make
up for a complete lack of plot depth. Somehow, they're
right. What passes for a plot is more like a string of badly

November 13, 2003

Having just returned from a mission to the
International Space Station, I haven't heard much about
"The Matrix Revolutions," but, from what I can teU, it
should be really good. For one thing, I know it stars Keanu
Reeves. I am a big fan of Reeves' work in such films as
"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure," "Parenthood" and
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey." Whenever I see his name
in the credits for a movie, I know I can expect an hour and
a half or more of top-notch comedy. Also, the movie was
directed by two brothers, and, if the Coens ("The Big
Lebowski" and "O Brother, Where Art Thou?") and
Farrellys ("There's Something about Mary," "Dumb and
Dumber," "Kingpin") are any indication, no one can direct
comedy these days like brothers. So, if you want to laugh
your socks off, head on over to "The Matrix Revolutions."
I'd be joining you myself, but I'm still trying to unzip my
spacesuit.

A fateful meeting, an intellectual comedy
even get my favorite joke until the

BY EVA HOLMAN

eholman2@swarthmore.edu

"So Picasso and Einstein walk into a bar
Initially, the plot of "Picasso at the Lapin
Agile" reminded me of a bad joke. Picasso
and Einstein meet in a cafe in France, and,
after talking to each other, each goes his separate way, inspired and ready to change the
world. Well, it's not much of a punchline, but
any play written by Steve Martin is sure to be
full of jokes with better ones.
"This show deals with the fictional meeting between Picasso and Einstein, two people
who will go on to shape the 20th century, in
that same bar in 1904," said Mischa Stephens
'O6, the show's director. The implication is
that this momentous meeting between two
great minds influences the accomplishments
of each. A year after the fictional meeting,
Einstein writes his famous theory of relativity, and, in 1907, Picasso paints his self-portrait "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," set in the
Lapin Agile, a famous cafe in France.
"These two works are, in Steve Martin's
..."

mind, pillars of influence on modernity,"
Stephens said. "It's a momentous event when
they meet in the bar and are bouncing ideas

off each other."
In a particularly good

scene, Stephens
said, Einstein and Picasso, each with a piece
of paper and a pen in his hand, draw something on their respective papers, swap them
and investigate what the other chose to scribble down.
"One is a drawing, one a formula, but the
inspiration each gets from the other causes
them to go do something later that inspires
the world," he said.
Stephens and the cast members had plenty of praise for the humor in the show.
"The humor ranges from esoteric to slapstick vaudvillian," Stephens said. "Steve
Martin combines his wonderful sense of
humor with his knowledge of passion. When
I cast the show, I looked for people with something about them that was innately comedic.
Each cast member has a distinct style and
their own humor attributes."
Laura Holzman 'O6, a cast member,
agreed. "Every time I read the script again, I
get another joke," Holzman said. "I didn't

third or

fourth time reading the script. That's the
challenge of acting in the show, because the
audience only gets to see the show once. So
we have to try to get across as much as we
possibly can."
"It's a very 'Swarthmore' comedy," Ben
Masten 'O4, another cast member, said. "It's
wacky, strange and cerebral. There are bits
about what it means to be an artist, a creative
person, and what this kind of thing entails.
It's a very funny, conceptual script."
Cast members are excited to be working
with Stephens, who directed an episode of
"Fawlty Towers" for last year's Night of

Scenes.

"He's an ambitious guy," Masten said.
"The show is really well cast. Mischa picked

some really good people."
"He's really open to working with us,"
Holzman said. "We can talk to him whenever
we have problems. It's amazing how he put
the whole show together in only five weeks."
The company only began rehearsals two
weeks before fall break.
Stephens is particularly excited about the

amount of authenticity that went into the
production. The costume for Picasso
a
black shirt, black scarf, black pants and
shoes
was taken from a photo of him taken
in October of 1904, the very month of the
play's setting. Similarly, the walls of the bar
are plaster-stucco, not wallpaper, to make the
set seem as authentically like a Parisian cafe
as possible.
The cast also includes Ben Firestone 'O7,
Amir Jaima 'O4, Catherine Parnell 'O6, Evan
Buxbaum 'O6, Anna Belc 'O7, Jacob Winkler
'O7, Tevye Kelman 'O6 and Peter Kriss 'O7.
All in all, Stephens said, the experience
has been very satisfying.
"The last show I directed made me realize
how fun directing a comedy is," he said.
"There's so much creative liberty. It's satisfying as a director, hearing the audience laugh.
And I've loved directing something written
by Steve Martin."
Perhaps this meeting between the two
famous minds never took place. But if you
wanted to watch a fictional account of a meeting between Picasso and Einstein, one written by Steve Martin has got to be the best.

Baring it all for the camera, without fear
This weekend, as one of
my friends was taking
naked pictures of me for
her photography class, I
mused on my own body
issues while icing my nipples in between takes.
When it comes to body
image, I am a prodigious
hypocrite. Yes, I deplore
the unrealistic depictions
of "ideal" male and female
bodies that we are conSARAH WALSH
stantly bombarded with on
Sex and the Swattie I any given day. Yes, I personally believe that there
are an infinite number of
possibilities for beauty.
But these opinions are also coming from someone who ritualistically inspects her body in a full length mirror each
day. Predictably, I'm not often thrilled with what I see.
Like many people, I am so used to this self-criticism and
hyper-awareness of all things caloric that, in a perverse
way, it almost makes me happy. Well, at least I don't know
how I would function without this particular obsession. I
mean, I'd have to start thinking about pollution and politics and stuff. My life would become so empty. Plus, I
wouldn't be able to bond with other women and, increas-

THE PHOENIX

ingly, men by means of the familiar language of body-bashing. As it is, my social skills have taken a substantial nosedive since joining the Swat ranks, so I don't know if I'm
prepared to become even more reclusive.
What I'm circularly saying is that taking off my clothes
has never been particularly easy for me, bizarrely, even
in front of someone who has seen me naked plenty of
times before. I always secretly suspected that, during the
interim of these disrobings, the person would come to
picture me as far better-looking than I really was, and so
upon undressing I would hear a shriek of horror. For
years I had held my breath at these moments, waiting for,
"For the love of God, put it back on!" Yet somehow I witnessed no such reaction (though it is entirely possible
that they just had the self-control to sublimate it).
In fact, no one has ever been anything other than complimentary about my body, despite weight gain or candy
binges or periods in which my only form of exercise consisted of 10 reps of bringing a cookie into my mouth. But
did it matter to me that my fatalistic predictions did not
actually occur? Not really. Besides, I don't believe in
logic.
So then how did someone as psychotic as me

end up

posing naked? (Granted, it was for a maximum of seven
people.) Well, I figured that, since I am always writing
about how people should try any and everything sexual, I
had better put my money where my mouth is. I should
mention that I had once before let someone take naked

November 13, 2003

photos of me, but the sight of me trying to look sexy was
absolutely ridiculous. It was very traumatic. After that,
except for that freshman I accidentally flashed a couple of
weeks ago in my hall (eh, he probably needed to learn
anyway), I swore off any kind of public exhibitionism for-

ever.
As it turns out, forever actually ended up lasting about
eight days. My good friend needed nude photos for her
class, so I bit the bullet and decided to give R-rated modeling the old college try. After a few glasses of wine and
surrounded by my closest friends, I dropped my drawers
and helped create some art (no, it's only soft porn when
they use frosted glass and digitally create D-cup breasts).
The surprising thing was, I had a great time. Partly it
was just the thrill of doing something novel and somewhat taboo, but it was also realizing that what I had
really wasn't that
my body
feared would be awful
bad. Even afterward, when I was examining the photos in
yes,
which I was simultaneously reflected in three
three
mirrors, I was gripped with a sense of satisfaction, contentment even. No, even in black and white I was
not miraculously transformed into a bikini model or even
a Speedo model, but all I could think is, "Could be worse."
It may not be perfect even at age 21, but at least I'll have
something to remind myself of youth and to scare my
grandchildren with when I'm a very wrinkled 90. I can
just hear them now, "Mom! Grandma's trying to make us
look at the naked pictures again!"

Full disclosure
One of the central tenets of journalism is that
reporters are not allowed to cover organizations or activities in which they are a part. Journalists cover the
news; rarely do they make the news. If they do, they certainly do not cover their own news stories. Two weeks
ago, The Phoenix inadvertently violated this principle.
In the Oct. 30 issue of The Phoenix, we ran a news
article sent to us from the English department's
Journalism Workshop. The article, written by Andrew
Sniderman 'O6 and entitled "Students join ACT UP to
fight AIDS," primarily focused on the Philadelphia chapter of the national AIDS organizations and its local
efforts at combating AIDS. A substantial part of the article, however, focused on the Swarthmore chapter of the
Student Global AIDS Campaign, a grassroots AIDS
awareness organization run by students across the country.
Since publishing this story two weeks ago, it has
come to our attention that this article violated The
Phoenix policy on full disclosure in its articles.
Sniderman, we have since learned, is one of the members
of the Student Global AIDS Campaign on campus.
Sniderman did not inform of us his involvement with the
AIDS group, and at the time, we and the leaders of the
did not know about it either.
journalism workshop
The Phoenix would like to apologize to the community for this transgression. Had we been aware of
Sniderman's membership in SGAC, we would not have
printed his article. While it is the duty of the editors of
The Phoenix to ensure that our policies and principles
are upheld, students from a journalism class that has
delved into understanding the ethics of fair reporting
should know better than to submit such biased articles
for publication.
Deirdre Conner 'O4, who is aiding instructor Wendy
Dowkings in the journalism class, explained her position
in recommending the article for The Phoenix. "Wendy
and I had no idea that he was involved with the group,"
she said. "If we had, we would have told him to do something else; we have stressed to the class that conflicts of
interest like this are not acceptable."
It is Phoenix policy that staff reporters are not
allowed to report on organizations of which they are a
part. There is no place in the world of objective journalism for the kind of self-promotion found in Sniderman's
article.
While the leaders of the journalism class and we at
The Phoenix do our best to stress the ethics of journalism, it is up to those people who submit articles to us to
adhere to these principles. As we do not allow our
reporters to cover events that present a conflict of inter-

ests, we cannot allow our contributors to do so either.

Benjamin Kabak
Editor in Chief

Get in the paper
While it's normally good policy for a newspaper not
to talk about itself too much, sometimes that means
there's no effective means of countering misconceptions that spring up about campus publications.
One common misconception about The Phoenix is
that, unless you're hired as a biweekly columnist, you
can only send in submissions as 400-word letters.
We do, in fact, print guest op-eds whenever we
receive them. Op-eds run longer, at about 550 words,
and unlike letters are spaces for readers to express
their opinions on broad social or political issues without having to write in reference to something that previously ran in The Phoenix. Though we don't appreciate attempts to spam our inbox as a form of social
protest (no, we're not the administration), we make an
effort to include as much as we have can from
Swarthmore community members.
We have too few submissions more often than we
have too many, so don't be shy to submit.

Poor communication plagues ITS
BY GREGORY ROBINSON
grobinsl@swarthmore.edu
Rather ironic that I haven't gotten the recent reservedstudents e-mail that supposedly "explains all" regarding
the extraordinary troubles that the network has been having since the beginning of this year. And it's a shame,
because from where I've been sitting, it would have been
nearly the only update that ITS has recently given of why,
exactly, the network spontaneously fails, why the Google
search engine disappears from our computers or why all of
the computers suddenly and simultaneously forget that
they have IP addresses and, as a result, can't find the network or the Internet.
For that matter, it may have explained why the connection speeds have so often slowed to a crawl, to the point
that dial-up speeds outstrip it. Or why, for the past three
months, a significant number of off-site e-mails to students
have been bounced, preventing students from conducting
valuable business or touching base with concerned family
members. But, alas, this e-mail never made its way to me
either, but instead had to endure the fate faced by so may
others. So, now, in November, after more than two months
on campus, I still don't know any of this stuff.
Don't get me wrong; I'm more than sympathetic to the

plight of the ITS staff. This has not been an easy year in
terms of attacks on the network, and I can only assume
that the staff is doing the best job that it can in dealing
with this (it's certainly doing a better job than I could). But
this doesn't change certain facts. The first of this is that,
yes, this is in fact one of the expenses we pay for with our
tuition. There are reasons it's more expensive to live on
campus than off, and the automatic provision of utilities is
one of these. The other issue is that one thing about ITS's
work has been abysmal, in spite of its best efforts, and that
is communication. It took until nearly the third month of
classes before we were officially told for the first time that
Windows file transfer via the network had been disabled,
ostensibly to hinder virus proliferation. And as of today,
we have still never been told that there are any problems
with the e-mail.
Having an SCCS account, I have the benefit of compar
ing the level of clarity between the two: SCCS, during their
server transfer, has consistently updated as any relevant
information has come up. It even negotiated to use the CS
department's Web space to keep users updated. The system
administrators have even told us when they were going to
lunch. I honestly wish that our paid ITS staff could match
the level of up-front-ness provided by our student volun-

teers.

Security for immigrants

MARISSA VAHLSING

Progresso Sauce

Two weeks ago, while you were
sleeping, federal agents raided 60
Wal-Marts on Oct. 23 and arrested
250 janitors for being undocumented immigrants. The janitors, from
various countries in Eastern
Europe and Latin America, will
likely be deported, whether or not
the lawsuits they filed against WalMart for exploitation and unfair
pay ever materialize. This raid, the
largest ever at Wal-Mart in the past
few years, is only one more example of the ferocity with which the
new Department of Homeland
Security has been conducting its

business of law enforcement. As
many of us are aware, large
changes have been afoot since Sept.

11, and, in an effort to render our country more "secure" from the
threat of terrorists, most levels of our federal government have
undergone an intense identity crisis. Although many of us have

-

been fortunate enough not to feel the effects of the changes taking
place in the Department of Homeland Security, millions of people
living and working alongside of us can.
Few changes have been as significant or atrocious as the
post-Sept. 11 treatment and processing of immigrants. In fact, the
need for tightened security with regard to immigrants became so
sought after by our federal government that it actually passed the
government sector responsible for acclimating, accommodating,
and processing immigrants (the former INS) over to the Department
of Homeland Security.
Since this change last March, this fancy new department has
been successfully devastating the lives of thousands of people living
within our borders who are lawful permanent residents, asylum
seekers, refugees and undocumented immigrants. The Department
of Homeland Security hasn't only gotten off to a good start by enacting new legislation, such as the First Foreign Terrorist Tracking
Task Force, which allows the DOHS to deny entry, detain indefinitely, prosecute and deport anyone suspected of terrorist activity,
with few questions asked. It has also arrested and deported thousands of illegal immigrants working in airports nationwide.
Another great initiative has been to enforce the questioning and
registration of hundreds of thousands of men between the ages of 18
to 33 from a select list of Middle Eastern countries. In fact, the new
DOHS has been so efficient and fair in implementing these new laws
that situations like that of southern California last December have
become frequent, where hundreds of Middle Eastern nationals were
arrested and are still being detained after coming forward to cornpry with registration requirements.
Still, the terrorist paranoia that has unfairly marginalized and
vilified immigrants across the country is not the only cog in the new
machine of homeland security. Raids and arrests such as those that
occurred two weeks ago in Wal-Mart have also been more rampant
than ever. However, because of the new us-versus-them complex
that our politicians have conditioned us to, most of us don't even
blink when an event like this happens. Instead, many people complain that undocumented immigrants are reaping benefits unfairly
from a system that is there to serve the American citizenry alone.
This point might be worth considering if weren't the case that few
immigrants are living "the easy life" but instead are being exploited and taken advantage of by workplaces such as Wal-Mart. In reality, immigrants compose 25 percent of the low wage workforce in
the United States, and more than half of immigrant and refugee families live below 200 percent of the poverty line. And those are just the
stats for lawful permanent residents and new citizens. The multiijtfde of undocumented workers who are not even taken into account
during the census have it even worse. Because most of these people
live in constant fear of deportation, they are taken advantage of and
exploited by American employers. It has become normative for
these workers to work 60-hour workweeks in menial jobs that pay
around minimum wage with no health benefits. Often, the employers know that they need not pay them for overtime work or give
them days off for sickness, because, if the workers were to complain,
the employers could turn them over to the DOHS.
In the case of Wal-Mart, most of the arrested workers claimed the
managers knew they were undocumented. Because of that, they
said, the managers rarely ever paid them for overtime hours, gave
them few or no benefits, including those that would cover accidents
on the job, and often forced them to work all night long with only
one 15-minute break. Those of us who are concerned about undocumented immigrants reaping benefits from our tax money should
understand that few of these workers are receiving any "benefits".
In fact, all we have provided for them here in the United States is a
history of skepticism, distrust and exploitation.

No deals for Hezbollah
Earlier this week, Prime
Minster Ariel Sharon's cabinet
narrowly approved an agree-

ment with Hezbollah to release
hundreds of Arab prisoners in
exchange for one kidnapped
Israeli and the bodies of three
Israeli soldiers. This deal, if
carried out, will be Israel's
largest prisoner exchange with
an Arab entity in nearly 20
years. It will also be a demonstration of weakness to the
Arab world and a boon to
Hezbollah and its fellow terrorist factions.
Three years ago, Hezbollah
captured Elhanan Tannen-

Bursting the Bubble

baum by luring him into a fake

business deal with Arab businessmen. He has since been held
hostage in Lebanon and used as a bargaining chip in the current
prisoner exchange proposal. Offering Tannenbaum and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers, Hezbollah has demanded that the
Israeli cabinet release 400 Palestinian prisoners and several
dozen prisoners from other Arab nations.

Regardless of the Israeli reaction to this proposal, it seems
prudent to examine Hezbollah's request first. Having captured
Tannenbaum, a noncombatant, Hezbollah now expects the

release of hundreds of Arab prisoners. The magnitude of this
trade evokes a question of what value Hezbollah puts on the
prisoners themselves. Surely the exchange of a dozen Arab prisoners for a single Israeli would be more than fair in any sense
of the word. By requiring the release of so many, Hezbollah
demonstrates less regard for these prisoners themselves than
the Israeli weakness their release may reveal to the world.
Sadly, this lopsided exchange is not without precedent. Since
declaring independence in 1948, Israel has repeatedly exchanged
batches of hundreds or thousands of Arab prisoners in return
for only a handful of Israelis or Israeli bodies. In the most recent
such occurrence, Israel released U5O prisoners in 1985 in
exchange for three soldiers who were captured in the 1982 conflict in Lebanon. While the appropriateness of this exchange
may be questioned, it at least took place at a point in time in
which terrorism against Israel was a small fraction of what it
has been recently. Though the proposed prisoner exchange with
Hezbollah is not the first of its kind, it is a completely inappropriate decision given the level of violence in the region.

Act on wage before year ends
Dear Editor:

Swarthmore College Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign applauds the work of the ad hoc
committee to this point, as well as the expressed commitment of the Board of Managers to a profound examination of the living wage issue at Swarthmore. The ad
hoc committee is due to release its draft report by
Thanksgiving, initiating a process of community and
board deliberation that should lead to the board's taking decisive action in the spring. After so many have
waited so long, we affirm the necessity of taking
action on a living wage within this academic year.
Living wage has been a salient issue at the college
for three years now, and there must be no further
delay on this matter, now that a concrete living wage
proposal is within reach. A failure on the part of the
college to pay a living wage to many of its staff members is a failure on the part of the college to live up to
its principles of social justice. We therefore propose
that the Board of Managers continue in its study of a
living wage but aim to vote on the issue at its April 30May 1 meeting.
The 1989
States Accreditation evaluation
team reported that" staff members "felt underpaid
[and] undervalued," and in its progress report in 1994-

The

1995 the college "had concluded that it was, in fact,
paying staff less-than-averages rates." While efforts
were made to bring staff salaries at least to 100 percent
of the average, it wasn't until 1997 that the college
began assuring that all employees at the five-year
longevity mark were paid at that benchmark. Even
today, employees are not provided with information
regarding how they may reach the maximum pay category and the number of years required to attain that
goal.

The result of these deficiencies is that the burden
for operating the college at the lowest cost is placed on
the backs of our employees, hurting the lowest-paid
community members the most. Given this historical
lag in salary increments, the college must now correct
this injustice by not allowing another year go by in
which they replicate underpayment integral to the college's past pay policies and replicate the racial and
gender inequalities in market practices.

It may be commendable for Israel to make a goodwill gesture, but this is not the one to make. If the capture of one Israeli
can be used to free a small army of Arab prisoners, what incentive will there be for Hezbollah
in addition to Hamas, Islamic
not to use
Jihad, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and the like
similar tactics in the future? Rather than take actions to make
Hezbollah reconsider future kidnappings, Israel will demonstrate that there are effective paths to weakening Israeli resolve.
This exchange is perhaps most troubling because, unlike
past exchanges which have for the most part been with specific
countries, Israel will release Arab prisoners at the behest of a
terrorist organization. Hezbollah is not a sovereign nation. It is
a Syrian-sponsored terrorist group, recognized by the United
States as such that has occupied Lebanon since the end of the
Lebanese civil war in 1991
Thankfully, there still exists the possibility that this prisoner exchange will not occur. Hezbollah leadership has said that
the exchange must include Samir Kantar, a Lebanese militant
who murdered an Israeli man and his two children in the 19705.
It seems curious that the release of over 400 prisoners absent
Kantar would not be sufficient for the release of Tannenbaum.
One hopes these detained Arabs realize Hezbollah is not simply
performing a friendly gesture. For the moment Israel seems
resolved not to release Kantar or any Arab prisoners responsible for the murder of Israeli civilians.
The Israeli decision not to release these most contemptible
murderers is sensible, yet the larger decision to engage in this
prisoner exchange is still an irresponsible one. If Arab attitudes
toward Israel are to change, as they must before this conflict can
end, it is a dangerous move for Israel to engage in any actions
that could cause its neighbors to question its regional influence.
Conceding this exchange to Hezbollah will not placate that
group's aggression or mollify its anti-Israel attitude. Rather,
Hezbollah will have identified and will exploit a very real Israeli
weakness. If Israel is to survive among its hostile neighbors,
expressing vulnerability for the sake of a businessman and
three bodies demonstrates a weakness that, if consistent, is
incompatible with that survival.

Onwards, upwards: Seniors say goodbye
BY EVAN BUXBAUM
ebuxbaul@swarthmore.edu
With winter just around the corner, it's finally time
for seniors who play fall sports to say goodbye. Goodbye
to teammates, goodbye to student athletics, and goodbye
to losing streaks longer than the walk from ML.
For good.
"I've been playing since I was five," Catherine
Salussolia 'O4, co-captain of the women's soccer team,
said. "And at our last game this year, the scoreboard
stopped working and the lights went out on it. It was nice
to eome full circle, because you don't have a scoreboard
when you're five. The score doesn't matter."
Just like Salussolia, 10 seniors have come full circle
this-fall and will be ending their student sports careers.
Yet with many of the fall sports teams in the middle of
rebuilding processes, the seniors are leaving at an
ambiguous time. They are leaving just as the teams seem
to be picking up momentum, built on the foundations
they helped create.

But for every cloud there is a silver lining. Even
though the seniors might not be able to continue to share
the successes they've earned, another path awaits them.
Graduation. No more Swat losses. Ever.
This comes, of course, among other positive aspects.
"Most of our athletes come from very good high
school programs, so when they come here and they are
losing, well, it really motivates us to reverse the course,"
Brendan Moriarty 'O4, captain of the men's soccer team,
said. "The losing gives you a motivation to improve the

team."
And many of the fall sports teams are getting consistently better.
"The quality of the team got better and better. It was
great to be part of the program as it got better," Sarah
Donovan 'O4, right back on the volleyball team, said.

"And it will get even better in the future."
"At the end of this last season," Salussolia said, "we
weren't where we expected to end up, but we had key victories throughout the season and there is a lot of potential for next year."
"In terms of our record, I was disappointed,"
Moriarity said. "I expected us to have more success. But,
in reality, when you're trying to build a program, it takes
time. It doesn't happen overnight."
But to the seniors, sports at Swarthmore was about a
lot more than just the stat column. It was about the
friends, the responsibility, and the satisfaction of beating
up on Haverford.
"I would have liked to go to the playoffs, but that didn't work out," Katrina Morrison 'O4, a middle blocker on
the volleyball team, said. "But that's OK. At least we beat
Haverford. That felt really good. It was an awesome way
to go out."
"This year was the most intense in a lot of ways,"
Helen Leitner 'O4, captain of the field hockey team, said.
"From being a captain and a senior, the added responsibility definitely changed the experience in a lot of good
ways and bad ways. But the good moments were even
better."
As the oldest members of their respective teams, the
seniors had a challenge. They had to show authority and
command respect but also find their niche in the team as

players.
"They have played a really important part," Jessie
Whitfield 'O6, a forward on the field hockey team, said.
"All the leadership was focused on them. They handled it
really well, though. There weren't as many seniors this
year as last, but they did a really good job of being a
bunch of different seniors in just three people."
"I think seniors represent the teams' voice and need
to know how to balance leadership and camaraderie.
They need to be a part of the team but also need to rise

above," Val Maulbeck 'O6, a midfielder on the soccer
team, said.
But even through seasons that perhaps fell short of
expectations or hopes, the teams held together and did
not slump.
In the end, there is more to team sports- at
Swarthmore than winning and losing, and these things
never change. The team camaraderie, the highlights, the
"hours on buses going to away games." These are the
things that players will remember.
"I'm going to miss the girls tremendously. They are
the reason I have played," Donovan said. "I always kept
playing because of them."
"I remember at the conference tournament, I tore my
ACL in the warm-ups for the first game," Leitner said. "I
remember being on crutches and jumping up and down
on the sidelines. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of the
experience. We ended up losing but smiling and laughing, because it was really amazing, even on the sidelines.
That synthesizes why I find sports so important. That
and scoring on Haverford. It was awesome."
What do the seniors see for the future? Some are sad,
some can't wait, and some haven't even thought about it
yet.
"I'm sure if I really want to I can play in the future,"
Hilding said. "But I might not be able to, and that's sad
to think about."
"I will miss it," Donovan said. "Volleyball is not a crying team, though. We think it's funny that other sports
cry more. I want an alumni game next year, though. For
Swat volleyball, I'll come back."
But until they do, Swat will miss them.
"They were good role models for the rest of us," Krista
Spiller 'O6, a middle blocker on the volleyball team, said
of the seniors. "They were pillars of virtue on the team,
legends in their own time."
Amen.

Starting out a fluke, ending up a champion
BY AMY STOCKER

astockerl@swarthmore.edu

As most of us know, Lang Reynolds 'O5 won the men's
Centennial Conference Championship two weekends
ago. It earned him the title of CC Runner of the Year and
helped lead the Swarthmore team to a third-place finish
overall. Such extraordinary achievement in his sport
leads us to one question: Who is this guy?
Well, at first glance, I could tell you he was one of
those shaggy-haired cross country guys who runs miles
and miles each day just out of love for the sport. After
getting the chance to sit down with Lang in the comfort
of Parrish Parlours, however, I discovered there was
quite a bit to add to the story of Swarthmore's leading
harrier.

Amy Stocker: OK, let's try and get to know the Lang
before Swarthmore. To start with, when did you first
begin to race competitively?
Lang Reynolds: I started running cross country competitively as a freshman for my high school team. But it
wasn't until my junior year that I started to get really
serious about running.

After you started to "get serious" about running, did
you plan to continue running at the college level, or did
you just fall into it when you arrived here?

No, I definitely always had the intention to compete
at the college level. I had some success my senior year in
cross and a good track season, so I was really looking
forward to racing in college, taking it to a higher level. I
was also looking forward to college-level cross country,
because the races are a couple of miles longer than in
high school, which better suits me. I like the longer

races.
So, it sounds like you made running a big part of your
life in high school. Was there a particular reason you
started to run?
No, not really. That's kind of funny; it was sort of a
fluke that I started running. I had always been involved
in a lot of sports; the first two years of high school I was
a three-sport athlete. After a couple of years and some
success, I eventually focused on running because I enjoy
it the most.
Well, I guess that fluke worked out for the best! Moving
on to the race, how did it feel to win?
It felt incredible to win, as it's been one of my goals
since freshman year. I was 10th in the conference last
year running on a stress fracture, so it really became my
goal to win after that, because I knew if I could do that
after a season of frequently interrupted training then I
could do much better after a full season of uninterrupted training.

Did you have a particular strategy going into the championship race?
Yes. Coach Carroll had instructed us to go out relatively slow, because the tendency on [the Allentown]
course, with its flat and fast first mile, is to go out too
hard and not have enough to stay strong through the
hills of the middle and latter parts of the race. I am not
used to racing from behind, but in this case it worked,
and coming through the third-milemark I was in fifth or
sixth place, behind the Haverford leaders. By the fourthmile marker, I had caught the Haverford runners and
took the lead with a half mile to go.
Did the fact that Haverford has been known to be
Swarthmore's rival give you any more motivation when

passing the two leading Haverford runners?
I wouldn't say that it helped me pass them. But

Haverford, especially in cross country, is the team to
beat. So, the fact that we were the underdogs and that I
passed them felt great.

What was the hardest part of the race for you?
I would have to say that it was the section of hills just
before the fourth-mile mark. I was about 20 meters
behind the leaders, and the hills hurt a lot. That was
probably the hardest part of the race to get through.
after running well at the Centennial
Championship race, do you think you are capable of

Well,

winning the Mid-East Regional meet this Saturday?
There a few more guys that are pretty fast at this
race, and I am unsure of how I match up against them,
but, as with every race, it would be great to win, and
that is always my goal. But I really want to make it to
the National Championship race, so I will have to place
in the top six outside of the top two teams. Overall, I
hope to be in the top five.

In a previous conversation, you gave a lot of credit to
Coach Carroll. Would you like to elaborate?
Coach Carroll is the best coach I've had. He came up
with a perfect race strategy and provided great motivation during the race. I don't like running from behind,
and, to be honest, I didn't think going out that slow
would work. It turned out to be the perfect strategy,
November 13, 2003

though. He's a great coach, and I feel privileged to work
with him. I'm also really grateful that I run with such a
great bunch of guys. Training with James and Garrett
over the past two years has been a lot of fun, and our
current sophomore class is really solid.

Last question. You are only a junior, and none of the
team's top runners will be graduating this year. So
what expectations do you and the team have for next
season?

I am really excited for next season, even though this
season isn't over yet. The entire team will be returning,
the sophomores are showing a lot of promise, and we
expect a few more runners to join us next year.
Improvement is always our goal and I think we will see
a lot of that manifest next season.

MLB free agency: mo'
money, mo' problems
Last Monday, baseball's free-agency period began, yet among the
oncoming player movement, the most noticeable development might be
the one player who will not change teams this offseason, Boston Red Sox
outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox's management placed Ramirez
on irrevocable waivers two weeks ago, which for 48 hours gave every
team the opportunity to claim him as its own without sacrificing anyone in return. No one took up Boston on its offer though, and the
league's indifference towards Ramirez
demonstrates how the nature of free
agency has changed in the past year.
Manny Ramirez is not the pedestrian
kind of player who is commonly placed
on waivers. Since joining the Red Sox in
2001, he has a .325 batting average, .441
on-base percentage and .611 slugging
percentage, with a yearly average of 37
home runs and 112 runs batted in. These
are astronomical figures, comparable to
the game's greats, but according to Red
Sox management, they still do not justify Ramirez's decadent contract, which

has five years and $lO4 million left from

AARON WASSERMAN

The Underdogs

its original eight years and $l6O million.
The team's decision to risk losing its
best player without tangible compensation proves that no player, no matter his
talents, benefits his team if his contract

does not accurately reflect his productive value because his salary would better improve the team if spread
throughout the roster.

This evaluation is absolutely correct. There is no way to justify the
size of Ramirez's contract. Baseball's minimum salary is $300,000 per
year and if it is used as a base to build all subsequent contracts (assuming that the lowest quality players usually earn the minimum salary),
players with salaries like Ramirez's would have to produce at unfathomable levels to ensure their returns matched the team's input. For
example, David Ortiz, Ramirez's teammate, hit 31 home runs with 101
runs batted in last year, with a batting average of .288, on-base percentage of .369 and slugging percentage of .592, all while earning SL2S million. Ortiz qualifies as a "steal" for Red Sox management, but even if he
earned $5 million more than the league's average yearly salary of $2.3
million, there would still be no way to argue that Ramirez's extra production was worth all that extra money. Contracts on the level of
Ramirez's pay scale obliterate any reasonable ratio of salary to tangible
results.
The length of Ramirez's contract exacerbates the situation. Signing
an athlete to an extravagant long-term contract say, at least 10 million
dollars per year for six years
is one of the poorest financial decisions
an owner of any sports franchise can make. Except for rare occasions,
every athlete's career has the same production arc: a year or two establishing his skill's niche, several more until it reaches its peak, where it
stays for several years; then his physical skills start declining at the age
of 32 and the drop becomes precipitous quickly. Players (and their
agents) know this and pursue such deals as they enter their most productive years. It guarantees they will receive the same salary during the
downside of their careers as they did during their pinnacles without
having to reenter the market as retirement approaches.
Everyone associated with professional sports knows this owners,
ushers, fans. Nevertheless, starting in the 1990s and continuing through
the turn of the century, owners inexplicably lavished free agents with
absurd long-term contracts. They could have paid higher per annum
contracts over a shorter period of time to adjust and properly compenin Ramirez's situation, possibly
sate for a player's then-current value
but instead, smoothed over the
$9O million dollars over four years
inevitable decline with more money.
The contract was a strange symbol of loyalty, an owner's proving
ground to demonstrate how much he really wanted his team to benefit
from a player's pinnacle. More preposterously, this counteracts the cynical core principle of free agency: no player is loyal to his current
employer as long as another offers a more attractive contract.
Unfortunately for players, owners have come to their economic senses, which the Red Sox's rejection of Ramirez demonstrates. Owners
have wrestled control over free agency from the players, because they
are no longer willing to pay salaries that don't have a proper correlation
between how far above the league average a tendered contract is and
how far above the league average potential production will be over the
entire length of the contract. Over the coming years, this "revelation"
will have profound effects on baseball's free-agent market. Rather than
anticipate an incredible offer from some worried owner, players will
have to lower their salary expectations to meet owners' new, collective
demands. This might seem like collusion, but really owners, and their
talent and economic advisors, are finally starting to think rationally.

The Swarthmore women's basketball team

looks to return to postseason play for the fifth
consecutive season this year and challenge once
again for the Centennial Conference title. Last
season, Swarthmore posted a 21-8 (12-3) record
and reached the CC tournament before being
knocked out in the semifinals by Johns Hopkins.
Hopkins went on to win the conference, and
returns this year as the favorite according to a
poll of head coaches and sports information directors.
While the Garnet Tide lost last year's starting
point guard Ali Furman to graduation, the team's
nucleus remains intact. Four starters from last
year's team will return to the squad, including
All-American, two-time conference player of the

year Katie Robinson 'O4. Robinson became the
first women's basketball player in conference
history to earn back-to-back CC player of the year
honors, averaging 18.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and
4.3 steals per game.
Three captains lead this year's squad:
Robinson, Jerusha Rogers 'O4 and Allison Wolf

'O5. Wolff, a junior forward, averaged 7.2 points

per game while leading the team in rebounds and

senior center, averaged

2.9 points

and

4.0

Also returning from last year's starting lineup
is 5'10" forward Zoey Adams-Deutsch 'O6 and 5'9"
center Radiance Winters 'O6. Last season, AdamsDeutsch was the team's second leading scorer,
averaging 11.4 points per game to go along with
5.2 rebounds per game. Winters averaged 5.7
points and 5.3 rebounds per game, while starting
in 21 of the teams 29 games.
Debra Farrelly 'O6 will run the point this season, replacing Furman in the starting lineup.
Farrelly played in all 29 games last season, averaging 3.4 points, 1.2 assists and 13.3 minutes per
game. By replacing Furman, Swarthmore's alltime three point leader, Farrelly will no doubt be

asked to play a bigger role this season.
"We are fortunate to return this amazing
group of women," coach Adrienne Shibles said on
the team's Web site. "They work extremely hard

and have great team chemistry, which are two of
the most important ingredients for success. We
are all really excited about our return to the
court this coming season."
With only two seniors and a large sophomore
class, Swarthmore looks to challenge for the CC
title this year and in years to come.

Mike Mullan: the man behind the myth
BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadoll@swarthmore.edu
He frolics about the campus in a flannel shirt, spahdex
shorts and size 23 boots. He has all the air of an aged, balding angel preparing for flight towards the eternal kingdom. More than walks, he floats, or hovers or glides. He is

Mike Mullan.
Baudelaire famously declared: "M. Mike Mullan est le
dernier eclat d'heroisme dans les decadences," that is to
say, Mr. Mike Mullan is the last flash of heroism in the
decadences. We may assume from this reference that Mike
Mullan is at least as old as the times of Baudelaire (i.e., late
nineteenth century), which however does not exclude the
possibility ofhis being still more ancient. What is certain,

at any rate, is that "hero" is the only term suitable, the
only term sufficiently dignified for this legendary figure
whom we have the honor to have within our midst.

It is difficult to approach a man of
this stature without trembling in
sheer mystical awe.
For those of you who have not been graced with the
opportunity to meet the man, a brief summary of the principle events and exploits protagonized by Mr. Mullan
would be in order.
Michael Mullan is a native of the state of Pennsylvania,
where he was born, it is believed, sometime around the

time of the French and Indian war. It is further hypothesized in modern scholarship that Mullan participated
briefly in this international conflict, at the age of seven,
garnering the admiration and praise of all by his valor and
might. He subsequently laid down the musket and picked
up, in turn, the tennis racket. He was invincible. He was
merciless. He was sublime. He won, on two occasions, the
high-school title for the state of Pennsylvania, and then
packed his bags for Berkeley, Calif, to begin his college

career.

during which he
After a brilliant four years of tennis
also cultivated his intellectual prowess with close and multiple readings of Marx, Nietzsche, Durkheim and Weber
Mullan went professional on the international tennis
scene. It is believed that, while competing in a tournament
in Bolivia, he sparked an armed revolution of the agrarian
and working classes and participated in the famous battle
that claimed Che Guevara's life.
With the fairer sex, Mullan possessed a sort of magical
charm, whence his alternative appellation: Mul-dog.
Mullan was a registered member of the Lincoln
brigade, a small group of American intellectuals who
fought for the republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.
At approximately the same time, Mullan also undertook
his first piece of literature, subsequently published under
the title: "Mary Jane: The opiate of the intellectuals."

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

Mul-dog takes a break from winning national titles by relaxing in his spacious office at the Mullan Tennis Center.
Shortly thereafter, Mullan became implicated in the
narcotic scene and controlled a vast trafficking empire
which furnished him with both wealth and political
weight. He was received as a guest of honor by Castro in
La Havana, and arm in arm with the latter, repelled the
Bay of Pigs invasion with the point of his own bayonet.
He ran for the American presidency in 'B2 against
Reagan, under the auspices of the American Communist
Party, and won a respectable 2 percent of the national vote.
He published a collection of poems; he acted in independent film; he worked for the American embassy in Russia;
he gave a series of classical-violin concerts. In short, he
rose to the height of human genius and to the pinnacle of
personal grandeur. He became, in a word, a legend.
Nonetheless his dear home state always beckoned, and
he decided to rest upon his ample laurels and to retire to a
quiet professorship in a quiet liberal arts college, where he
presently still remains. He has taught the men's tennis
team for precisely a quarter of a century and in this time

has won countless titles.
It is still difficult to approach a man of this stature without trembling in sheer mystical awe. The present author
has had the good fortune to play doubles with Mr. Mullan
and with Jerry Kohlberg, the rich capitalist who ironically left $2 million for the construction of the Mullan Center,
under the strict and explicit stipulation that it be named
after the celebrated and revolutionary sociology professor.
I can confidently state, based on the doubles match in
which I participated, that Mike Mullan is to the common
man what Hyperion is to a satyr. He is a divinity among

men.

Respectfully salute the Mul-dog whenever you cross his

USA baseball team
misses Olympic cuts
Last week, the United States baseball team was eliminated from the Olympic qualifiers. That's right, the
defending gold medal Americans will not be defending
their medal in Athens next summer. Instead, North
America will be represented by Canada and Cuba. At
first glance, this is ridiculous and absurd. America is
baseball. Tons of great players come from other countries, but America is still easily the baseball hegemon.
Japanese baseball has an extremely rich history (and if
you don't believe me pick up "You Gotta Have Wa" by
Robert Whiting), but it doesn't have Babe Ruth calling
his shot, Jackie Robinson stealing home, or "The Giants

win the pennant!"

But upon a second look this may be a blessing in disguise. First off, everyone knows Olympic baseball is a
joke. When I was a kid watching the Olympics, I was sure
each country was sending
its best athletes to represent itself. Boy, was I stupid. Olympic baseball
today is mostly played by
minor leaguers; it used to
be played by college kids,
much the way Olympic
basketball was before the
Dream Team. The reason
for this is obvious; the
Olympics fall during the

10. Rugby wins its first conference game of the season
39-15 over Susquehanna.
Kicking off the countdown is the Buzzards, who punished Susquehanna for their lone conference victory of the
year on Oct. 25. Led by Matt Williams 'O4, Randy Goldstein
'O5 and Jon Fombonne 'O5, Swarthmore was able to physically dominate the game from start to finish. "We beat the
hell out of them," Michael "Flip" DeFilipo 'O4 said. "It was
the first time we physically dominated the game for all 80
minutes. I mean, you know it's a special game when
:w>» Fombonne scores twice."
9. DU defeats previously unbeaten team Ramrod in IM
basketball.
Coming in ninth for the fall season is DU's victory over
team Ramrod and David Gentry, giving them their first
victory of the season. Jared Passmore 'O4 came up big for
DU, leading the team in scoring and playing aggressive
defense en route to the win.
8. Field hockey finishes season with comeback victory

defeat the F&M Diplomats 3-2 in the final game of the season. "[The game] really was the story of our season." Jessie

Props go out to the senior outside hitter for being

along with a career-high 20 kills, and she added 20 digs,
and three blocks.
5. Volleyball conies from behind to surprise Haverford
3-2.
The volleyball team comes in sixth on the countdown
with its heroic comeback victory over Haverford. After
being down two games to none, the Garnet Tide went on a
roll to win the final three games in stunning fashion,
squeaking by the Fords to finish the season with a victory.

4. Carlton Davis, scorekeeper.
This little-known moment came during men's soccer's
4-0 loss to Dickinson. With roughly 12 minutes remaining
during the contest, Swarthmore forward Brandon Penix
'O7 went down, and, as the referee went over to examine
whether the players would be able to continue or not, the
crowd became restless as the score clock continued to tick.
Fiery Garnet coach Eric Wagner turned to the booth and
screamed "Stop the clock!" A good 30-45 elapsed during the
delay. "The ref never called for the clock to stop, so I don't
know why everyone was making such a big fuss," Davis
said, defending his actions. "I was watching him the whole
time, and it's not my fault the team was down 4-0 and
everybody was restless. Tell the fans to check out the rule
book and then yell at me. I was right, they were wrong.

So, instead, the United States is represented by players from AAA and AA leagues. Looking at the 2000 team,
I crunched some numbers and found that the 11 pitchers
on the 2000 team have gone a combined 135-121 in major
league experience. Not bad, but certainly not Walter
Johnson or even Dizzy Dean level. It gets worse when
you take out Roy Oswalt's numbers, leaving the other ten
pitchers at 92-104. The batters aren't much better and

good baseball countries probably weren't sending their

best players either (although I think Cuba does).
So Olympic baseball sucks. Everyone knows this, and
I probably shouldn't have spent half my column proving
it. But now, finally, for the blessing-in-disguise part.
Major League Baseball recently announced it would likely hold a Baseball World Cup in March of 2005. The tournament would likely include eight to 16 teams and would
be held in four to eight major league ballparks. And most
importantly, the world's best players would paly.
America could field a lineup of Alex Rodriguez, Gary
Sheffield, Todd Helton, Barry Bonds, Jim Edmonds,
Jason Varitek, Marcus Giles and Bill Mueller behind the
pitching of Jason Schmidt, Roy Halladay or Mark Prior.
The Dominican team would be similarly loaded, featuring Albert Pujols, Vladimir Guerrero, Sammy Sosa and
Alfonso Soriano with Bartolo Colon on the mound.
Puerto Rico and Japan would also field dangerous teams.
The failure of the United States to qualify for the
Olympics should attract enough attention within the
United States to the sorry state of organized international competition, such that the proposed World Cup would
go from being likely to being definite and the best players would feel excited about playing. Its been obvious for
years that baseball deserves a showcase for its best players to represent their home countries. Hopefully the
World Cup will fill that role and fill it well. In any case,
it can't do much worse than the Olympics.
