Project to get chickens on campus gaining momentum
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Sarah Scheub 12 and Nick Vogt 'l2 want to bring
free-range chickens to the Swarthmore campus, but the
pair has not found a prescribed method for setting up
their project.
Their proposal, which was submitted to Director of
Grounds Jeff Jabco on Monday, involves housing 15
hens in a solar-powered coop in the area adjacent to
Dupont parking lot near the Science Center. The coop,
as well as the electric fence around the chicken's pasture, would move to a new area each day. "They'll act
like a lawnmower but at the same time they won't
destroy the land," Scheub said.
The eggs produced by these hens would then be sold
to dining services and served in Sharpies and in the
Kohlberg and Science Center coffee bars.
"I think the big idea behind it for me was coming
from a very rural, agricultural community it was a
very big realization to come here and know that my
food wasn't coming from somewhere I knew anymore,"
said Scheub, a native of Grand Rapids, Ohio. "If I don't
know, how can any of us know?"
She explained that her family raised chickens, grew
vegetables and bought beef from a producer down the

ments.

Scheub and Vogt also met with Everbach as a representative of the engineering department. His class,
"Solar Energy Systems," will create the plan to provide
solar-power to both the coop and the electric fence. He
is also writing a letter of recommendation to be submitted along with the final proposal.
"I think it would be really cool if this campus had a
chicken coop. It would set an interesting tone; it would
be unusual," Everbach said. "There are a lot of logistical objections that would have to be overcome." He listed the concerns of neighbors and the danger of disease
killing the hens as examples.
Jabco echoed Everbach's statements. "I think there's
still some issues that need to be worked out," he said.
"It's a strong proposal, and it would be a unique thing
for Swarthmore."
One thing that still needs to be worked out is fund-

ing. Scheub and Vogt expect start-up costs to amount to
$l,BOO dollars. After that, maintenance costs will be virtually zero because of the use of solar power to provide
electricity and Sharpies kitchen waste to feed the chickens.
They initially planned to apply for a Swarthmore
Foundation grant, but due to budget constraints, this
money is only being offered to projects that directly
assist an impoverished community.

road.
"It's also about knowing that the money you paid for
that food is supporting a family that you trust and
care about, not just going to some corporation," she
said.
Not only does Scheub want to bring local food to
Swarthmore, she also wants to bring a greater agricultural awareness.
"No one here knows anything about chickens or
agriculture or raising livestock," she said. "There
are some classes that relate to food in economics and
history and things like that, but nothing physical,
nothing right now."
Vogt, who comes from an urban background,
illustrates Scheub's point.
"I've never really been in direct contact with that
sort of livestock animal until I've gone to Sarah's
house and seen the chickens and seen how practical,
useful and educational it really is and how that can
be brought back to Swarthmore," he said.
"Hopefully it will start a lot of discussion on
where our food comes from and how it got there and
how it's produced," Scheub said.
To begin the process of bringing free-range chickens to the college, the pair created a proposal over
the summer, but were initially unsure of what to do
with it.
Citing a lack of project-planning resources,
Scheub added, "That's our biggest disappointment.
There isn't a route for students to take with their
ideas."
They sent a preliminary proposal to Jeff Jabco,
who forwarded it on to the biology department. The
biology department then passed it on to the
Swarthmore Sustainability Committee.
None of these groups were able to approve the
proposal; they were only able to give recommendations.
"We weren't qualified to judge the logistical merits," said Carr Everbach, engineering professor and
sustainability committee co-chair. He also explained
that since the chickens would produce a negligible
number of eggs
one to two dozen, as compared to
hundreds used by dining services in a week
the
project didn't significantly add to the college's sustainability.
The new committee also decided that supporting
student projects was not a part of its mission.
"The sustainability committee didn't want to formally" recommend our proposal or formally endorse
it because they didn't want to set a precedent of helping student groups with their projects," Vogt said.
Although none of these organizations could
approve the proposal, they did offer advice. The sustainability committee suggested that Scheub and
Vogt add educational elements such as curricular
tie-ins or a lecture series to their proposal since,
according to the committee, their project provides

an educational rather than functional benefit.
"What I tried to do is anticipate the questions there
would be from other people and the type of information
the college would like to know in considering their proposal," Jabco said.
Other groups made recommendations as well. For
example, since the chickens are being housed on a college campus, they would be under the same regulations
as chickens used for scientific research. The biology
department helped the pair research these require-

Worth considers co-pays to reduce medicine stock
As a part of a broader discussion about Worth Health Center,
some council members raised the
issue ofrequiring a co-pay for prescription drugs. Every year, Worth
buys tens of thousands of dollars
worth of prescription drugs, and at
the end of the year it is left with a
big stock of unused medications
that it has to throw out.
Council members discussed that
the money put into buying the
drugs that end up in the trash
could be spent in different ways.
With the budget crunch and the
possibility of drugstores delivering
the medications to the campus,
Worth has proposed to institute copays. It would be more efficient for
students to use their health insurance, if possible, to cover prescription drug costs.
Doctors' appointments would
stay free, and, according to Student
Secretary
Stephan
Council
Lefebvre 'll the Student Council
would "ensure that treatment for
serious health-related problems is
available regardless of ability to
provide co-pays." They would have
to discuss which medications to
keep in stock and which to order
upon request.
The Council also wants to work
on advertising Worth's services,
especially to new students.
Board of Manager luncheon
The Board of Managers met
with the Student Council at a
luncheon last Friday. The board
members, especially new ones such
as Jorge Munoz, were very curious
about the issues on campus and are
very eager to meet with students
and faculty. Student Council
President Rachel Bell 'lO stressed
that that the Council also wants to

October 1, 2009

create lines of communication
between students and the board.
Student Council members wanted to know the reason for the
absence of students on the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group. The
group was formed to adjust the college's budget to the realities of the
economic crisis. The Board emphasized that the Financial Planning
Group is a temporary body, created
to deal with emergencies, which is
why students were not included.
Other topics discussed at the
luncheon included occupational
diversity on the Board of Managers
and President's Rebecca Chopp's
open hours.
According to StuCo members,
most of the conversations were
productive. However, the council
would like to see more structured
conversations with the Board in
future meetings. It was suggested
that future meetings have to create
separate "topic tables," such as a
sustainability table or a financial
aid table, to allow representatives
from both sides to discuss these
issues.
Wharton C Basement storage
Across the archway from the
Wharton C basement lounge, there
is a room which currently serves
no purpose. The basement was
brought to the administration's
attention when President Chopp
was touring the- college with Dean
of Residential Life Rachel Head
and discovered this messy space.
The room's floor is covered with
rolls ofold tapes, clothes and trash.
The Student Council decided to
take initiative and create a storage
space for campus groups in the
room. Vice-President Nate Erskine
'll proposed to purchase and

install lockers in the room. StuCo
members agreed that there is no
storage space for groups on campus. "Things like the frisbee team
cooler cannot be kept in the team
member's room," saidLefebvre.
The issue of ventilation would
have to be solved if the sports clubs
kept their equipment in the room.
Cleaning out the space would be a
student council project. The
clothes could be donated to
Goodwill.
Textbook rental Issues
The Library has received $lO,OOO
to purchase textbooks and has suggested that the college could benefit from a textbook rental program.
The Council Financial Policy
Representative Dan Symonds 'll
researched the program's efficiency and found that textbook rental
is very expensive and complicated.
It would only work if departments
used the same books for at least
four to six semesters, which rarely
happens at Swarthmore.
Symonds put forward a few
propositions for spending the
money: getting electronic book
licenses, buying the cheapest textbooks, or purchasing books that
professors tend to keep, such as
introductory textbooks or litera-

ture.

A more expensive venture that
could be efficient in the long run
would be buying an ebooks printer
that allows students to print and
bind a book in two minutes. It costs
around $30,000.
The Council is considering creating an Amazon account to enable
students to get free shipping when
purchasing books.

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

Students pick up ramen noodles and other items for their emergency first-aid kits at the
Emergen-c study break in Shane Lounge last Thursday.

Planning Group decided to propose
an $8 million program because our
endowment decreased by 16.8 percent. While this is still a signifi-

cant loss, it is better than the

pro-

jected loss of 30 percent in value.
The Managers endorsed the idea of
an 8 percent plan. The Ad Hoc
Committee will now develop the
implementation plan considering
all suggestions from the community. Because $8 million is a significant adjustment in our budget, we
are thoroughly considering all possible ideas. We want to be responsive to all suggestions. We are looking at ways to increase revenue as
well as ways to reduce expenses.

Alum demystifies finances in the collegiate sphere
BY LINDA HOU

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

"A Blast from the Past" was
the subject line of an e-mail
that 2012 Class Dean Myrt
Westphal received earlier this
semester.

The e-mail was from Matt
Wallaert 'O4. As a part of his
fairly new job, he has been traveling around the United States
giving lectures to students on
finance. He wrote, "And of
course, I can't forget my alma
mater—Swarthmore College."
Wallaert made the offer to
Westphal in July that he might
come and give a lecture to
Swarthmore students, and he
did so last Friday, Sept. 25.
Wallaert graduated from
Swarthmore in 2004 after only
three years here but chose to
stay to do research with
Associate
Professor
of
Psychology Andrew Ward and
Professor of Social Theory and
Social Action Barry Schwartz.
In 2007 he left to do graduate
research at Cornell. While at
Cornell, he received a phone
call from a company asking
him to be their consultant.

Wallaert said no.
"Some people asked me if I

Wallaert said.
And so Wallaert signed on as
a part-time consultant for
Thrive (www.justthrive.com).
In 2008, he joined the company
full-time after his adviser at
Cornell left. Since then, he's
become Thrive's lead scientist.
His job involves product development as well as talking to
people about their finances.
That's what led him back to
Swarthmore.
Westphal, at the time, was
planning a series of programs
to fight the sophomore slump.

about sophomores in June 2007,
and when her class became

choices they make and we
thought this was a topic they

might not get elsewhere. I
think sophomores have a lot of
choices to make, so I wanted
them to have the tools to make
them wisely," Westphal said.
She promptly agreed to
Wallaert's suggestion. Westphal

said that Wallaert made it very
easy for her,, including providing his own transportation and
money for door prizes.
This was not Wallaert's first
trip
leaving
back. Since
Swarthmore, he has returned
many times, not only to do
research but also simply to
visit.
"I often come back. I continue to collaborate with Andrew
and Barry. And I still have
friends here, like the crazy
lunch ladies. There's always a
sort of ritual process where I
have lunch with them every
time I come back," Wallaert
said.
Wallaert's lecture mainly
touched on subjects such as student loans, the meaning ofcredit scores and how banks work.
For some students, those are
valuable information that they
would not have learned elsewhere.
"I knew nothing about credit scores before this. Or how the

Hutcheon delivers speech on language education
BY JULIE MAZZIOTTA

BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 27, 2009

Linda Hutcheon presented her research on the need for
a change in language education in North America
Thursday to a full room of Bryn Mawr students and faculty on Thursday. Hutcheon is a professor of English and
Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto and
President of the Modern Language Association.
Latin and Classical Studies Professor Russell Scott

introduced Hutcheon and invited her to speak at the college 'lat the insistence of all the language departments."
Hutcheon detailed her background to begin her speech,
noting her Italian parents who immigrated to Canada to
raise her. She received an undergraduate degree in modern
languages from the University of Toronto, the city in which
she was raised. "Growing up in Toronto was an interesting
experience because people are not constrained by theirper-

sonal culture into groups, and there's a melding of languages," she said.
She explained that her interest in critical theory began
after her experience studying abroad in Italy.
"At this time, there was a huge surge of interest in theory in Paris that reached Italy," she said.
Hutcheon described the day she waited in line for a new
book on theory sent from Paris.
"I'm proud to say I still own that book today," she said.
While writing her doctorate at the University of
Toronto, critical theory and language became inseparable
to Hutchinson, and she re-wrote her thesis to reflect those
ideas.
Following her doctoral studies, Hutcheon became interested in the connection between cultures and language, and
the recent decrease of multi-lingual people.
"It has become more of an educational issue," Hutcheon
said. "Languages are not taught as much in high schools as

much, and people aren't interested in their own culture."
She also cited the difficulty of learning a new language
as a roadblock for students.
"People learn languages in a way that isn't transparent," she said.
Hutcheon is seeing more language classes moving to
movies and music to accommodate new learning styles.
She believes classes are becoming culture-based as more
students enter higher learning with no knowledge of any
language other than English.
"Her discussion of theory will have made anyone for
whom the term is a bit intimidating feel much better about
the subject," Scott said.
Mary Frances Bannard, a graduate student focusing in
classics, said Hutcheon's lecture was fantastic.
"To have someone talking about such a multi-faceted
concept; you have to get someone who is very clear on the
topic, which she was," Bannard said.

Why Haverford's alcohol policy is the best option
BY HANNAH JAENICKE
BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 27, 2009
The recent Lloyd raids have brought
about
much
discussion
about
Haverford's alcohol policy and its relation to the law and students.
Whereas educational institutions all
acknowledge that the consumption of
alcohol is prohibited by law for those
under the age of 2L it is the details of
their alcohol policies that differentiate
the schools from one another.
While the alcohol policy at Haverford
emphasizes individual responsibility,
the policies at nearby institutions tend
to be stricter in their design and enforcement.

Haverford's alcohol policy stresses
moderation, safety and individual
accountability, in addition to compliance with the Honor Code. Students can
confront others whose behavior under
the influence of alcohol is inconsistent
with their welfare. The policy prohibits
the destruction or defacement of College
grounds and buildings, and such vandalism falls under Honor Council's jurisdiction.
As most students at Haverford are
under 21, alcoholic beverages are prohibited at student events, except at "special
events" that have been approved by the
Joint Student-Administration Alcohol
Policy Panel. Such events can only take
place inLunt Basement or James House,
must promote the fine or performing
arts, comply with the goals of the alcohol policy, and not be advertised outside
of the tri-college community.
Alcoholic beverages can also only be
served indoors and consumed in private
spaces
these are defined as student
residences, as well as the stoops, porches and yards adjacent to the residences.
Under the alcohol policy, Lloyd Green is
not classified as a private space.
Students who do not abide by the
alcohol policy can be brought before
JSAAPP or Honor Council.
In contrast to Haverford, Temple
University's alcohol policy lists a system
of fines and punishments for students
caught with alcohol on campus. All dormitories are dry, and students caught
with alcohol for the first time are fined
$250, have their parents or guardians
notified, are given a disciplinary probation period of between 15 and 20 weeks
and are required to participate in the
university's Drug and Alcohol Offense
Program.

6

A second offence results in a $7OO
fine, the probationary period being
extended by a minimum of 15 weeks,
another stint in the DAO Program and
possible suspension or exclusion from
residence halls.
A third instance results in parents
and guardians once again being notified,
and possible suspension or expulsion
from the university.
Temple University student Flora
Cohen 'l3 said, "The alcohol policy is
pretty strict... they do checks and stuff,
and if you have any paraphernalia you
can get fined."
Temple's Student Body President
Kylie Patterson 'lO said the sanctions
system applies to very few students, and
that most students caught are not repeat
offenders. Stressing that the DOA
Program allows most attendees to "grow
from the experience," she explained that
the punishments and fines had been
increased to their current levels because
students initially did not take them seriously.

While Patterson believes that the
alcohol policy addresses the needs of
most Temple students, Cohen detailed
instances where students had snuck
alcohol into dorm rooms
a direct vioresulting in raids
lation of the policy
by the police due to the presence of alcohol, noise and underage students.
Comparable to Temple's policy is that
of Villanova University. Villanova's policy allows students overthe age of 21 to
keep and consume alcohol in their personal residential spaces, but no student
who is living off-campus is allowed to
bring alcohol on-campus without prior
permission.
The penalty for providing a beer keg

or other common source of alcohol is
$5OO, and if university staff become
aware of a violation of the alcohol policy
at an event on-campus, they are allowed
to enter the residence in question,

search for and confiscate any alcohol
and disperse guests. Furthermore,
Villanova can punish students with disciplinary probation for drinking underage and buying alcohol for minors.
In addition, different types of alcohol
earn students different levels of fines.
While the discovery of a six-pack of beer
or malt liquor results in a $5O fine, a bottle of wine will cost a student $75 and a
750 ml bottle of liquor $lOO.
Swarthmore College uses *party permits' to keep track of on-campus social
events. A permit must be obtained if

alcohol will be served, if a keg will be
present, and if more than ten people will
be in attendance. The permit application
must be submitted at least two days in
advance of a party. Attendance at a
party that does not have a permit will
result in a $5O fine per attendee.
A similar party policy is also in effect
at Bryn Mawr, where any student who
wishes to host a social event with more
than thirty people in attendance has to
complete a party notification form. The
form is designed to inform party hosts of
legal
their
liabilities
under
Pennsylvania law.
In addition, potential party hosts,
servers and bouncers at Bryn Mawr
must attend a Party Information
Session, which covers safety tips, and
the laws and liabilities concerning alcohol consumption and distribution. Each
session licenses the student for the academic year, but students must be
retrained for future social events.
Parties are classified at three different levels: level one allows for up to 60
guests attended to by two hosts and two
servers; level two allows for up to 100

guests, two hosts, two servers and three
bouncers; and level three for parties
containing upwards of 101 guests.
Students hosting level three parties
must meet with public safety two weeks
prior to the event and provide wristbands for those over 2L
As can be seen from Temple,
Bryn
Villanova,
Mawr
and
Swarthmore's respective alcohol policies, there is much more regulation of
social events than there is at Haverford.
Temple, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr
and Haverford all operate amnesty policies, meaning if a student is taken for
medical examination as a result of alcohol consumption, the college will not
enforce its alcohol codes.
The alcohol policies of Temple and
Swarthmore detail specific punishments
for transgressing the colleges' rules. In
contrast, Haverford puts individual
responsibility and accountability at the
heart of its policy, thereby allowing students to use their own judgment in situations involving alcohol.

Cygnet significant to sizing up students' sexiness
BY MAIA GERLINGER
mgerlil@swarthmore. edu
If you take a quick trip to the Friends Historical
Library you can look through every issue of the Cygnet
that the school has ever published, beginning with the
first ever edition from 194 L The women wore lipstick and
pearls, theirhair set in curls; the men wore ties and jackets. The words "Swarthmore College Freshman Class"

grace the cover. The earliest instance of the title "The
Cygnet," which means "baby swan" for those of you who
skipped out on "The Trumpet of the Swan," didn'tactually appear until the 1965 edition.
Inside the book, the format was similar to that of
today's Cygnet name, hometown, high school but each
person's actual address was also included. Beyond this

addition, however, there isn't much difference between
the Cygnet of 1941 and the Cygnet of 2008: no information,
no welcome note. Just faces.
""It's a stalker book," Aaron Dockser 13 said. "If you
think that somebody's attractive, you look in the Cygnet.
Or vice versa, you flip through to find attractive people."
He added, "Attractive is a
rarity here."
"It's really useful during
Orientation," Justin Reyes
13 said, the more optimistic
of the two. "You know, you
look through and say, 'Oh,
there's that person, that person's awesome.'"
Other people simply use
it as a helpful memory aid.
"It lets me know the
names of my friends," Will
Schultz 13 said. "It is a
device for friend-naming.
All of us are so socially awkward that we don't know
Robin Marc Shapiro
our friends' names."
Still other students, such

Courtesy of swarthmore77.org K "It helps me balance out my
dresser," he said. "One of
the legs is a little wobbly."
When asked about Cygnet stalking, he said that he had
never done it. "Should I be stalking?" he wondered.
"Maybe I'm doing something wrong."
What do upperclassmen do with the Cygnet?
Apparently, there are a variety of options.
Peter Liebenson 11 said, "[W]e take them and play
games with them." He elaborated, "You can cover up the
name, and get someone else to guess if the person is a guy
or a girl."
Other options include: "You can find people who look
like famous people or people who go to this school. Or
make fun of people's names."
Liebenson had never really used the Cygnet until after
his first year. "It's really not a big deal as a freshman. You
don't use it at all. It's more fun when you're an upperclassman and you can just mock people for their appearance or picture choice."
Of course, opinions on the purpose of the Cygnet differ. "On some level," Adriana Massi 'l2 said, "I question
why we have the Cygnet. I mean, yeah, it's a small school,
building community, blah blah, but you're going to meet
everybody in about three days anyway.
"A bunch of my friends who are sophomores and juniors stole Cygnets from freshmen to look at freshmen's
pictures ...Yeah,-it's kind of creepy. It's like Facebook, but
worse." Freshmen use it, Massi asserted, "to be like, 'this
person's ugly, this person's ugly, this person's ugly, my
picture is so hideous, what was I thinking, this person's
ugly, this person's ugly..'
Upperclassmen, on the other hand, "are like, 'Oh, look.
Fresh meat,'" she said.
There is supposedly a strong connection between the
Cygnet and "swooping," the tracking-down of a singledout freshman by an upperclassman for the purposes of
beginning some kind of relationship, usually a shortterm, physical one. "I haven't done it," Liebenson said,
"

THE PHOENIX

"but I assume that people are
against it because it works. If
it weren't effective, people
would have no problem with
it. So I am in favor."
Does it happen? "I don't
know," Liebenson said. "It
must. But it's depressing
because there are three hundred people in the Cygnet and
you look through and no one
is attractive and you're like,
'Fuck.'"
In the end, however,
Liebenson said, "People here Donna Renee NSundy

based only on appearance."
Returning to her original point with renewed vehemence, Massi said. "Seriously, why does the Cygnet
exist? ... We are trying to promote a culture of non-creeping. This is where sexual misconduct comes from.
Creeping and stalking."

"The Cygnet should have a Google feed that constantly updates," Massi said. "You should have a full-body, 360degree turn-around view.... Staring at their picture is the
closest they'll get to face-to-face contact."
Now, with the online Cygnet, finding anyone on campus has never been easier. Here are the instructions next
to the search box: "You can do a more specific search by
using keywords in the search box. An advanced search
might look like, 'firstmatt address:lodges,' which would
return everyone named Matt who lives in one of the
Lodges." Unlike the paper Cygnet, the online Cygnet lists

all current Swarthmore students. However, the online
Cygnet just doesn't have the same charm. One can head
over to McCabe to look at some older Cygnets; they've got
the last four years on General Reserve.
Surprisingly, there was a welcome note on the online
Cygnet for the Class of 2009 that began with "I want to
offer a warm welcome to the Class of '09!" signed by former Dean Bob Gross '62. It also included information on
College Services, Co-Curricular Activities, College
Traditions, What's Where? and then, finally, the Class
of 2013 Photographs.
In contrast, when it came to my online Cygnet, the
class of 2012, there was no information, no welcome
note. Just faces.

Facing the real danger of [pop] culture shock
Last semester, I took a
course in the Film and
Media Studies department
entitled "From Broadcast
to Podcast: TV and New
Media." In addition to further validating my suspicion that no Swarthmore

that biology major treating you?" (Relatedly, the Biology department is preparing to announce this week that they're renaming the
infamous and as yet colon-free Bio 1 to "Introductory
Biology: Pass/Fail This Shit Before You Have A
Nervous Breakdown.")
Somewhere in the middle of a box set of the first season of "The Golden Girls" (my midterm project), I had
the somewhat banal realization that beyond just entertaining us, television also inculcates us with specific
(often stereotypical) images of various groups. For
example, "The Golden Girls" taught us that the elderly
fall into one of three categories; sexually active and
proud of it, snarky and overbearing, or clueless and

confused.
More to the point, though, I see TV and movies as
directly responsible for the one phenomenon that every
student studying abroad inevitably blogs about: culture
shock. And with the kind of nonsense we're learning
from Hollywood portrayals of life in other countries,
how could we not?
For instance, from "Love Actually" I learned that in
England it's considered entirely' acceptable for the
Prime Minister to have an affair with a member ofhis
domestic staff, which here in the United States is a little thing we call "sexual harassment." Then again, it
seems the Americans in the movie are also a little
unclear on what does or does not constitute workplace
malpractice, considering the President of the United
States (played by Billy Bob Thornton, of course) cops a
feel of the same woman the British PM was already try-

ing to seduce (when in Rome, I guess). Talk about
tawdry.
From "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" I
learned that all British people have awful teeth. I also
learned that a proper British morning routine includes

a sexy bitch! Yeah baby yeah!" a practice I anticipate

years." Leaving "news" for the Life and Style section, I
found such gems as "Happy birthday to the Billy bookcase," an ode to flat-packed Ikea furniture, and "Lost in
showbiz: the love affair that threatened Madonna's
muscle tone."
Moreover, with the exception of Madonna, who has
universal appeal, I found little to no overlap in who

being totally and utterly alone. Is this

an irrational fear? Debatable. But
instead of letting logic counter your
monophobia, it's easier to indulge in
the glut of evidence supporting it.
But without dwelling on the source
of your slump, (like your shattered confidence from gaining the freshman 15 or
sophomore 25, or your inability to find
meaning in life after you quit varsity
soccer) we can all take comfort in the
fact that these fears are normal for the
aging population
that is, for those of
us who are in our last year of college
and must face a banal crossroads:
either find a job or live on mom's
couch; either break it off with your girlfriend or be locked into a semi-satisfying relationship; either continue a pattern of cavalier one-night stands, or
start looking for someone actually compatible because, after all, you're going
on 22
and then realize that it gets
...

exponentially harder to meet people
after you've moved out of the co-ed dormitory. God, being a senior is bleak.
Think about it: When we were 18,
there was nothing at stake but our virginity (and often, not even that). Not to
downplay the significance of getting
sexually "activated," but the older we
get, the more complicated sex becomes.

As freshmen, it was natural, easy and
even thrilling for many of us to hop
from partner to partner, flirt with

whomever we pleased and flaunt our
promiscuity. The pregame ritual for
every Saturday night was reminiscent

of the afternoon before a middle school
dance (with a few shots of vodka tossed
in for good measure) where the girls on
my dorm hall and I would trade clothes,
do each other's makeup, take pictures
and shower each other with compliments.
I remember raiding my roommate's

closet every weekend for my go-to sexy
getup: a hot pink mini-dress with a
plunging neckline and a hem that ended
just below my plump little butt. I was
ballsy, and I was out to have a good
time.
The cavalier attitude that characterized my social behavior as a freshman,
I would venture to say, was not uncommon. Not to say that we upperclassmen
can't be just as libertine as the rest of
you, but naturally other considerations
creep up for us. The more we mature,
the less appealing no-strings sex
becomes. Though I wouldn't go so far as
to condemn a one-night stand in good
taste, it doesn't exactly make sense at
the moment. The difference is this: for
the first two and a half years of
Swarthmore, I was indiscriminate. It
wasn't until mid-way through my junior year that I realized that seeking fun
with reckless abandon could actually
become tiresome. Now that I've experi-

October 1,2009

enced sex both meaningless and meaningful, it just makes sense to stick with
the latter given that I'm about to gradu-

ate college.
My self-reflection in no way concludes that I'll never again give into the
temptation of hooking up purely for the
fun of it; after all, screwing is the balls
while you're doing it. But on the same
token, I can't guarantee that I won't
kick myself afterwards.
Seniors now have under one year to
decide exactly what their priorities are,
and how these priorities will affect
where they will go, what they will do
and consequently, with whom they surround themselves. Friendships and
relationships might play a large role in
where a post-grad decides to locate himself, but then again, they may not.
Whether it's already started to creep
into your thoughts, or whether you're
pushing it out of your mind until the

end of the year, the decision will be
waiting. Eventually we'll all have to ask
ourselves, how important is this relationship to me? Is this person worth
sacrificing for? Am I really happy? Is
there better? <Gasp>. For the
younglings and the romantically unattached, this is currently not an issue.
For the rest of us, it's something to ponder.

Name: Isabel Rivera
Class Year: 2010
From: Bronx, NY.

What She's Wearing:
"I'm wearing a Gap t-shirt. These pants, I think I got
them at Ann Taylor Loft and my shoes are Nine West.
My bag is also from Nine West," Rivera said. Though she
shops at fairly mainstream stores, Rivera bought her
earrings from a small jewelry store on 57th and
Lexington in New York City.
Her outfit's neutral palette conjures up the idea of a
basic, go-to fall wardrobe of black or grey coats and
brown boots. But it's her nude flats that stand out. Nude
lips, dresses and sheer tops have dominatedmuch of the
runways, but nude-colored shoes can balance out any
outfit. The most-seen item on celebrities at red carpet
events has been the patent leather, nude Christian
Louboutin pumps. Pair them with a jewel tone dress or
even a black tweed suit, the nude color evokes the natural look and effortlessly elongates legs. Rivera's pointytoe flats are reminiscent of Louboutin's style.
How would you describe your style?
Rivera said her style is 'pretty basic" and "fairly conservative." With a job in the admissions office, she
enjoys spending "money on work clothes because it's
what I need." Rivera's professional, pulled-together look
makes her unlikely to wear pajamas to class. "I can't
leave my dorm in sweatpants, I just can't," Rivera said.
"I've actually tried to do it, and I can't do it!"

Style influences/inspirations:
"I went to high school in New York City, so I would
take the train all the time," she said. "I'd see all the pretty fashionable people get on the train." New York City is
one of the fashion capitals of the world and "it's hard not
to be inspired by [people] and be like, 'That looks good,
maybe I'll try something different,'" Rivera said.

Is it possible for a play written in
Germany in 1778 about Jerusalem in 1192
to be worth watching in Philadelphia in
2009? The People's Light and Theatre
Company is betting on it, kicking off their

35th season with Gotthold Lessing's
"Nathan the Wise," in a translation by
Edward Kemp, artistic director of the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art or RADA,
in London. It is a reasonable gamble for
them to make since the issue that troubled
Lessing, religious intolerance, is no less
worrisome today than it was 800 years ago.

Wardrobe Staples:
Rivera definitely sticks to the basics
and likes "black skirts and black pants
a lot." Cardigans are another must-have
for Rivera. "There's one that I really
love, but I get mixed reviews on it," she
said. "People call it 'the rug' because it
actually does look like a rug. But it's really comfortable and it's my favorite."
Since she focuses on a sophisticated
look, it's no wonder that Rivera likes to
wear pearl earrings. "I think that [they're]
really easy and also very simple," she said.
"I always think everyone looks good in
them."

people whose lives collide in Jerusalem following the third crusade, "Nathan the
Wise" attempts to undercut the foundations of religious prejudice and animosity.
In actuality, it is a pleasant play about kind
people who do virtuous things in a world
that is (supposedly) full of hatred and prejudice. Gotthold invites us to watch as the

Jewish merchant Nathan wins over a
Knight Templar and the great Sultan

Saladin with words alone. In Nathan's
Jerusalem, the use of logic is sufficient to
win unswerving loyalty and friendship
from those who ought to be his enemies.
The play is, in a word, Utopian. Director
Abigail Adams and her cast recognize this
and toe the line between an ideal world

and the world of fairytales. On the whole,
Adams has done a remarkable job, staging
"Nathan" with sincerity beyond reproach.
With the exception of the final scene
(which I do not think anyone other than a
revisionist editor with a machete could
make less sentimental), her directing is

only visible when it is coaxing the la2y dialogue forward.
At the helm of the cast is Oscar-nomi-

nated David Strathairn (a nominee for his
portrayal of Edward R. Murrow in 2005's
"Good Night and Good Luck"), playing
Nathan adroitly and lovingly. Brian
Anthony Wilson as Al-Hafi, the dervish,
and Saige Thompson as Nathan's daughter
Rachel give similarly tender and thoughtful performances, but it is the fiery performance of People's Light newcomer
Luigi Sottile as The Templar which keeps

the audience invested.
Sottile's Templar is just as impetuous
and emotional as he ought to be, but
Sottile's real triumph is not in living up to

the requirements of the role. Rather, he
surpasses them, demonstrating the rare
ability to naturalistically shift between
rage and a variety of categorically different emotions. It is all too common for
actors playing angry' or 'irritable' characters to get caught in that one dimension.
Sottile vocally and physically holds his
own in those moments, but it is always
clear that there is more to his Templar
than the rashness of youth, and he handles
the moments of comedy just as capably as
he does those of fury.

The other standout is Graham Smith as

October i, 2009

The Lay Brother. In a minor and underwritten role, Smith steals every scene, but
not by playing to the audience or by undermining his fellow actors. Smith's Lay

Brother is simply enchanting. It's difficult
not to smile when he is on stage, even
when he is delivering unwelcome information, because his manner is so finely tuned
to the role and is altogether pleasing.
What the rplay lacks, however, is a
meaningful contribution to the dialogue on
religious intolerance. To distill the message of the play down to a statement on
religious intolerance is to eliminate all of
the things that justify it as a theatrical production. The elements of the religious politics are all there, with Peter DeLaurier's
unflinching performance as The Patriarch
and Strathairn's beautiful delivery of the
parable of the three rings, but to take away
only those elements of the play is to ignore
90 percent of the production. Lessing's religious message is simple, something along
the lines of religious intolerance makes no
sense' and 'we're all one big family in
God's eyes.' His play, on the other hand,
has a denouement comparable in complexity and implausibility to those of
Shakespeare's late romances, "A Winter's
Tale," "Cymbeline" and "Pericles." If you
think about the play instead as a story of
friendship and about "good people doing
good things," as the cast said, in a talkback following the Sept. 24 performance, it
is a success. Lessing's play, under Adams'
direction, is a romantic and genuine vote
of confidence in the human spirit and the
ability of mankind to heal itself.

Beauty and pain: Review of Booker's 'Portraits'
BY AMBER WANTMAN

awantmal@swarthmore.edu

used their respective idols to create a
character of their own. The character's
story which would become the fusion
of each dancer's own story and the
story of his or her historical figure
would first be recorded through diligent note-taking, and eventually, interpreted through elegant and awe-inspir-

"I want you to get together" is the
melancholy plea that forms the musical
background of "Portraits," the dance
performance choreographed by Zane
Booker, founder and artistic director of
the Smoke, Lilies and Jade Arts
Initiative. Though the performance,
held last Wednesday, Sept. 23 in LPAC's
Troy Dance Lab, was a mere snippet of
"a work in progress," Booker has
already managed to create an emotive
and jarring show. The single song to
which the entire piece is choreographed is just one example of Booker's
careful planning and precision. As
Saint Germain's voice wails, "Put your
haaa-aaaands together one time," the
singer's emotion transmits into the narrative of each dancer, adding intensity
to each individual characterization.
Characterization is the name of the
game, as the title "Portraits" might give
away. In a brief introduction to this
piece, Booker discusses the creative
process, stating that each dancer did
"extensive research on a historical figure of his or her choice," and in turn,

-

ing movement.
Booker's piece opens up first without

music.

To

maintain a

consistent

rhythm and to create a crescendo of
percussion, the dancers start out snapping, at first lightly, and then build to a
climax. From the very beginning, it is
obvious that a constant pressure looms
in the world that Booker seeks to

express.
When the music begins, it lets the
audience know that a climax is not
reached. Though the build-up and
release of the percussive snapping may
be over, Rose Rouge elegantly reconstructs the tense background with energizing jazz and drums. The moaning
vocals of Saint Germain sound almost
pained, which, contrasted against the
snappy rhythm, forms the first duality
in a set of elegant conflicts expressed
through movement.

Dualities abound in the overall characterization of the five stories teld by
each dancer. First up is Emma Kraus,
who does a series of movements consisting of spins, kicks and, most strikingly, swats as if swatting a swarm of
pestilent locusts. Kraus' story is isolated in the sense that while she performs
at center stage, the rest of the group is
at the periphery, at times dancing in
unison (perhaps representing the force
of a societal group), and at times simply
staring intently at the unfolding story.
The most memorable movements
include Justin Bryant's steps in which
he keeps one arm behind his back (taut
,as if held by someone) and does a series
of off-balance/on-balance movements,
consistently catching himself with
great precision the very instant before
he falls.
Similar moves (as well as a tumultuous series of locust-swatting) were
performed by Maya Johnson, but her
most memorable moment was the finale
of "Portraits" in which Johnson faces
the audience and does a series of facial
contortions. Aided by the swooping
motion of her long-fingered, writhing
hands, Johnson plays peak-a-boo with

the audience, in what seems a selfadministered test of her breaking point.
As her hands reveal her face, Johnson
alternates between expressions of caricatured ecstasy and what seems to lie
beneath: shameful agony. The psychotic
grin is nothing short of scary.
The finale is perhaps the most striking duality in Booker's piece, but it is
certainly not the only one. Booker cultivates a sense of coincidental oppositprum with the alternation of off-balance/on-balance movements, slow and
fast, messy and clean, even unity and
separateness.
"Portraits" thoughtfully engages in
the struggle between the individual and
the group, whether it be a struggle of
prejudice, sexuality, identity, race, sickness, conformity or other. Fittingly, the
duality in "Portraits" goes beyond its
choreography. Dual, in fact, is the purpose of the show. While the audience
leaves having absorbed another work of
beauty, for better or worse, they also
leave with something else. The context,
themes and messages of "Portraits"
lead its viewers to contemplate their
own inner chaos, and therein lies the
beautiful pain.

The FULANA presentation
was one of a series of events associated with Latino Heritage
Month at Swarthmore. Another
featured event was last week's
panel discussion on "Language
Panics and Latino Identities."
panelists
were
Facilitating
Aurora Camacho de Schmidt,
Associate Professor of Spanish
and Latin American Studies,
Ana Celia Zentella, Eugene M.
Lang Visiting Professor for
Issues of Social Change, and
'O3,
Jonathan Rosa
PhD
of
Department
Candidate,
Anthropology,
from
the
University of Chicago.
This discussion addressed the
relationship between language
and identity in the Latino
American community, evoking
issues such as the propagation of
"Spanglish," the misuse of the
and the
Spanish language
growth of the "English only"
movement across the country.

During the panel, important
issues such as immigration,
migration, assimilation and
bilingual education were also
debated. The FULANA event

was intended as a continuation
of that discussion. Its focus was
on the issue of language and
identity
a central question of
Latino Heritage Month.
For ENLACE, the Latino/a
group at Swarthmore that organizes Latino Heritage Month,
these events are an opportunity
to reach out to the student community. Isabel Rivera 10, who
organized the FULANA event,
said that they were particularly
important because "they allow
us to engage the campus into dialogue without getting bogged
down in academic discourse."
This is the fifth year that
Latino Heritage Month has been
observed
at
formally
Swarthmore. According to Dean
Rafael Zapata of the Intercultural
Center, Latino/a Heritage Month
has "not so much changed over
the years as evolved to reflect the

,

growing

Latino/a community at

Swarthmore."
Mariela Puentes 'l2, co-president of ENLACE with Stephanie
Rodriguez 'l2, stressed the recent
focus on Tri-Co events this year.
Puentes said, "This extends the
Latino community. You feel like
there are more people who can
relate to you."
In addition to the panel on
language and identity and the
FULANA presentation, events
this year have included a Tri-Co
student panel, a meeting with
University of Chicago Ph.D. candidate Jonathan Rosa, a studentfaculty lunch and a discussion of
volunteer opportunities. The culminating
event
of Latino
American Month will be a
"CarnavaT'-themed party scheduled this weekend at Olde Club.

give up on,

Maya Marzouk

Fashion Frugalista

when time is

tight, is your

appearance.
And
while
the laid-back
look is fine when you're sprinting out the
door to class, there comes a point where
the sweats have just got to go. That point
is now. But don't worry: I'm here to help
guide you away from the frumpy, comfy
sweats that seem to exemplify collegeguy fashion and into the world of the
fashionable. A well-dressed man is forgiven for anything, so let's turn all you
male readers into well-dressed men.
(Don't worry though, girls. There's something here for you, too. I'd hate to be gender exclusive.)
The first thing you have to know, boys
and girls, is that you have to be clean.
Showering is really fashionable right
now. (And yes, as Swatties, we have millions of things to do, and sometimes
when it's 3 a.m. you don't want to spend
valuable sleep-time showering, but do it
anyway.) Clothes, too, need to be clean.
Laundry hardly takes time if you do it
once a week, and folding clothes isn't
much more time consuming. Folding
clothes is really important. If you don't
fold them, they get wrinkly and then look
dirty even if they aren't. Wrinkled or
stained clothing isn't the best way to
make an impression.
While still on general appearances, I
should mention shaving. Guys, you
should really keep your faces cleanshaven. I know that it seems to be a thing
with guys to have a bit of scruff or a 5o'clock shadow, but clean-shaven always
wins in my book. And here's why: It
shows that you care enough about your
appearance to spend the time shaving.
You immediately give off a vibe of being

invested in your appearance, even if you
aren't. Now, you might argue: All the
models in the magazines have a bit of
scruff! Well, none of us are models in
magazines. We girls. can't pull off any
runway outfits on a daily basis, either, so
don't feel bad.
Now, onto the clothes you're wearing.
Jeans are good. I like jeans, you like
jeans. They're basically a staple of both
girls' and guys' college fashion. Jeans are
versatile. You can dress them up (slim fit,
medium-dark wash with no holes or tears
or bleach spots) or you can dress them
down (medium-light wash with all
the extras, preferably slim fi
because that's what's in right
now, but baggy jeans are okay
too) and you look awesome.
There is, however, one important
rule about your jeans: they
belong on your hips. Boxers
are underwear, not outerwear. When girls have
their thongs sticking out
halfway up their backs,
it's inappropriate. When
guys do it with their boxers, it's sloppy. Avoiding
it makes the world a better place. Make sure your
jeans are the right length,
too. When you're sitting,
your jeans should touch or
almost touch the tops of
your shoes.
Now that you've got the
low-down on your bottom
half, we should get you into
some shirts. There are three
basic styles of shirts for
guys: T-shirts, polos and
button-downs. Let's start
with T-shirts. Thin, lightweight ones are the best to
have right now (over the
thick,
durable cotton
ones). Vintage washes
j
and graphic T-shirts are
especially in, as are
In**-witty (but not rude, conceited or offensive) slogans. I love old
band T-shirts both for girls and guys: a
well-placed Rolling Stones logo immediately takes a T-shirt from 1 to 10 on the
+

coolness scale. Polos are fun, and there's
a new market for graphic polos. The
short-sleeved ones are good for when it's
not too cold, and you can easily wear a
long-sleeved top (or another collared
polo) under a short one for a fun, layered
look that will still keep you nice and
toasty. Button-down collared shirts look
really classy with the sleeves rolled up to
your elbows over a slim-fit white T-shirt
or a ribbed tank; just leave the shirt
open. Or, you can button the shirt up all
the way (excluding the top button), and
voila! You look great. (I love
www.bridgess.com for men's shirts.
They're fun and fashionable, and
after an extensive look at the website
you can't go wrong with any of the
clothing found there.)
So we've got you in jeans and
shirts, but with the fall weather
uickly getting colder, that probably won't be enough even for a
quick sprint to class or to
Sharpies. Scarves are very in
for guys right now. I personally
like the thinner and longer
ones. Grey is always a safe
color that matches with almost
everything and can often highlight the color of your eyes. A
good leather jacket or a sport
coat is another way to keep
warm in the early winter, as are
Lightweight, longer hoodies with
kangaroo pockets. Don't forget,
though: you'll still need a good
winter coat for when it gets really cold. A sport coat or leather
jacket will do you no good when
there's a mountain of snow outside, even if you're wearing a
scarf too.
Now, a little something for
the girls: A boy's button-down
shirt paired with a skinny belt

white tank top (but leave your
sleeves all the way down)

are the best to stay warm, since they're
usually big and fall over your hands
enough to keep you covered and toasty.
So, boys, I hope that I've given you
enough to go on to throw together some
great outfits this fall. Just remember the
tips, and you should be set. If, however,
you still don't think you're ready to take

And girls! I hope I've shown you some
of the options boys' clothes have as cute
outfits for you. Play around with them.

Multitude of voices have diluted power of protest
Last week, the G2O economic summit
was convened at the University of
Pittsburgh, where the leaders of the free

the current global economic quagmire.
Marring the two-day convention, however, was a series of protests and the
ensuing police reaction. A wide-ranging
selection of interest groups
from the
Free Tibet contingent to the members of
the Iraq Veterans Against the War
chose last Thursday to protest in support of their various unaddressed causes. The police response that followed led
to dozens of arrests, numerous innocent

been the senseless vandalism or endangering of innocent bystanders that can
so easily accompany a protest without a
purpose.
Despite the success of relatively
smaller endeavors like No Casino in
Chinatown, however, the fact remains
that triumphs of social justice on a
grander scale are few and far between.
Cindy Sheehan took the anti-Iraq movement to the very gates of George W.
Bush's Texas ranch, yet unrest in Iraq
still lurches on with as little sense of
direction as the G2O protestors. Gay
rights parades and marches make
waves that unfortunately seem easier
and easier to ignore, and their uphill
battle is being fought on an ever-steeper
surface. Has the political protest's
propensity for great change been
exhausted?
That is a question with no easy
answer. It is true that the protest can
still be a symbol of serious discontent; it
is also true that this symbol can be
cheapened by farces like Glenn Beck's
912 Project. What is abundantly clear,
however, is that disorganized operations like the one in Pittsburgh last
week are unlikely to be very beneficial
for any party involved.
It is a fair conclusion to say that the
existence of too many voices has diluted
the power of the protest. And yet that is
what we, as Swarthmore students, find
diluting
ourselves continually doing
the persuasiveness of dissent.
Our comfort with the inclination to
subdivide ourselves allows us to identify with specific causes, admittedly. But
perhaps the frustration certain groups
feel as they attempt to enact change
arises from the fact that even a campus
as liberal as ours purports to be cannot
support so many different voices, each
one rendering the previous one less
potent.

Roth wrong on budget
To the Editor:
We would, like to clarify some misinformation in an article in the
Sept. 17, 2009 issue of The Phoenix, entitled "Yoel's pounds and dollars
fail to add up," authored by Yoel Roth.
Students who attend recommended study abroad programs like the
Sarah Lawrence program at Oxford remain registered at Swarthmore
and are assessed Swarthmore tuition, room and board, just as they
would be if they remained on campus. A budget for room and board
costs is set for each study abroad site.
Mr. Roth wrote that he will receive an inadequate stipend for food
($2,600 according to Roth). In fact, he has received $1,300 for the fall
term and will receive an additional dollar amount for the spring two
terms of the academic year at Oxford, equivalent to 1,350 pounds sterling, which we estimate will be approximately $2,150 (at today's
exchange rate) for a total of approximately $3,450 for the meal
allowance for his academic year abroad (not $2,600). Food stipends are
never meant to be used for "assorted living expenses" but are for food
only.

All you hotshots, don't presume The luxury of
to write the first draft of history being in DIII
swarthmorephoenix.com

Today, The Atlantic magazine, the Aspen Institute
and the Newseum are holding an event titled "The
First Draft of History" in
Washington, D.C. An invitation-only affair, the guest
list is a who's who of the
hotshots of politics and
business. The website and
flier announcing the event
are stingy on specifics.
They proclaim in bold letSofia Saiyed
ters, "25 leading journalThe Critical Eye
ists, 25 fascinating newsmakers and America's
most eminent historians
write the first draft of the history of our time." Topics to
be covered span the usual: health care, economy, foreign
affairs, etc.
For starters, what is with the pretentious title? People
in D.C. talk a lot about a lot of things, probably more
than they do anything else. The 25 lead journalists have
probably grilled a much broader array than just 25 "fascinating newsmakers" about the issues listed, enough to
fill plenty of books with political fluff alone, not to mention actual historical

political and corporate consulting firms that have been
accused by Business Week of astroturfing (which is
when formal political, advertising or public relations
campaigns intentionally create the impression of being
spontaneous grassroots behavior). Also invited is corpo-

rate media executive Jeff Bewkes, the CEO of Time

Warner, one of the world's largest media and entertainment conglomerates; he oversees Time magazine, HBO,
CBS, AOL and the cable-television company Time
Warner Cable, among other media outlets. Vikram
Pandit, CEO of Citigroup, one of the financial firms that
received a massive government bailout, made the list as
well as Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, Inc. My favorite
guest has to be Larry Summers, the current director of
the White House National Economic Council for Barack
Obama, also known for making sexist comments leading
to his ultimate resignation of his post at Harvard
University and for signing a memo as head of the World
Bank, arguing that toxic waste should be dumped in the
lowest wage countries.
Doesn't anyone see a conflict of interest in the fad
that the people being convened to write the "first draft of
history" are the very people within whose grasp lies the
future of history? I would imagine that a financial guru

Greenblatt's column, "Division 111 athletes

the
idea
that
"Swarthmore doesn't speak for itself the way
Brown does, and that [his] Ivy League friends
get more respect and attention, even though
Swarthmore is just as selective and just as
challenging as any of those schools." In my
opinion, motives concerned with the selectivity of the institution are rooted in vainglory and
pretension. If this is the central basis of your
college decision then there may be other
arrangements in your life you might want to
rethink as well.
But I'd like to address the larger issue I had
with this article: that there is greater investment in Division I which pushes athletes to
train more rigorously and endure more pain,
which results in a superior team chemistry
when compared with Division 111 athletes. As a
transfer student, I commonly find that I often
have greater insight into the lives of our nonSwattie peers than students who have matriculated into Swarthmore as freshmen, merely
because I have lived the life of a non-Swattie.
However, because of my previous athletic experience (I played Division I lacrosse for the
University of Vermont), I confidently consider
myself the resident expert on the differences
between these two NCAA classes.
So, the article correctly states that there is a
greater monetary investment into the careers
of Division I athletes. Yet what the author fails
to characterize are the various non-monetary
investments that Division 111 athletes receive.
In my experience, the coaches of Swarthmore
College are far more invested in their athletes
and teams than their compensations might
lead us to believe. I know that the
Swarthmore's men's lacrosse coach often
works late into the night reviewing game films
and strategy, going above and beyond what is
expected of him. Not to mention the numerous
assistant coaches who give hours out of their
lives each week to simply volunteer and be
part of our athletic programs. How much harder would you run if you knew your coaches
were enduring grueling hours for the beauty
and purity of sport and the general interest in
your success?
But with regard to Division 111 athletics, it's
not just the coaches who are at practice in the
unbearable heat or frozen rain for the pure
love of the game: the athletes themselves are
the ones who we should truly admire. The sacrifices athletes at Swarthmore endure are a testament to their commitment to the pristine,
and therefore heavily romanticized, Athenian
perception of sport.
Nobody at Swarthmore is playing for the
money or even the droves of fans, for that mat-

ter. In fact, most athletes tolerate subpar facilities, field and court scheduling conflicts, along
with social and academic penalties. The real
question is, why play at all? The answer lies

somewhere in the intrinsic value Swat athletes

place on the physical perfection of the human
body, the mind's ability to tolerate physical
pain, the innate drive for competition and the
feeling you get when overcoming a struggle.

And it is some combination of these factors
which binds Division 111 athletes, enables them
to have incredible team chemistry, and attain a
level of awareness for their sports that
Division I athletes are not given the "luxury"
of having.

sons?).
But at least there's a culprit!

There's a source behind the impending failure, and I
know how you Philadelphia sports fans like to pin these
sorts of sports failures on a specific reason or scapegoat.
You can blame this season's demise on the Phillies'
decision to trade for Cliff Lee and their failure to acquire
Roy Halladay from the Toronto Blue Jays at this year's
trade deadline.
Once you break down the facts, the arguments that
support the trade for Lee start to collapse (almost as
quickly as the New York Mets do, weeks before the postseason).

that cost the defending champions a chance to repeat

thereof

starts against the four AL teams currently seeded for
the playoffs (the Tigers, the Yankees, the Red Sox and the
Angels).
In these starts, Lee boasted an earned run average
above four and a WHIP of L4O. Halladay, on the other
hand, had won 19 and lost eight in 39 starts, sporting an
ERA a whole point lower than Lee's, with a WHIP bordering 110.
As a Yankees fan, seeing Halladay step on the mound
is downright infuriating. The 'Doc' has an 8-1 record
against the Yankees over this period of four years.
My only hope is that the Yankees can either use their
massive funds to acquire him once he hits free agency, or
nail him in the leg with a line drive to knock him out
early during a start (though I'd settle with knocking Jon
Lester of theBoSox out, too).

Don't suppose the Phillies could have used that kind of

pitcher in the World Series, eh?

Counterargument Two:
The other Phillies players are good enough that Lee
doesn't need to be as good as Roy Halladay for them to

win the World Series.
Maybe.

Lee's stats against the top teams of the'AL aren't necessarily bad.
They're probably better than most pitchers', and
they're just worse than Halladay's (I can't imagine any
other pitcher would be able to pull out about a .900 winpercentage against the Yanks over the same period of
time).

And the Phillies' offense is quite solid; they're currently ranked first in the NL (fourth in the MLB) in runs
scored per game. And they've got power too; this year's
Phillies are the 12th team to have four players hit for 30

home runs.
That's impressive, but I'm not sure it's good enough to
beat some of the AL teams or NL teams they'll be facing
especially considering the rotations they'll be facing in
the playoffs./
Lee has been the Phillies' most dominant and most
consistent pitcher since his arrival to Citizens Bank
Park, and 1 think he has earned the right to start the first
game of a postseason series.
But what do the Phillies do when they face a St. Louis
Cardinals rotation that features ace pitcher Chris
Carpenter (a former Cy Young Award-winner who is currently in the running for a second award)?
You'd better hope not only that Cliff Lee pitches a near
perfect game (against a lineup featuring two of the best
"hitters in the game, Matt Holliday and Albert Pujols), but
that the Phillies' batters are able to use their power to put
up points on the board. Though I think the fact that
Carpenter has only allowed seven home runs all year
may factor into the outcome.
The possibility that the Phillies might lose home field
advantage to the Cardinals may also factor into the outcome, as Phillies' batters will find themselves in pitcherfriendly Busch Stadium when facing Carpenter (Busch
Stadium is ranked 25 spots below Philadelphia's Citizens
Bank Park in terms of advantageousness for batters).

This isn't entirely true.
As soon as Lee was acquired froijl the Indians at the
end of July, people began to praise: the Phillies for the
trade and for their bargaining prowess.
Lee was acquired from a group offour minor leaguers,
which did not include any of the highly rated prospects

Lee started on a tear, winning his first five games (for

games from start to finish).

Cliff Lee was traded to the Phillies from the Cleveland
Indians in July.
And who's going to finish your games, now that Brad
Lidge, scorer of the highest ERA of any closer in history
with more than 20 saves, has pitched his way into history?
There are just too many questions with Phillies pitching, which doesn't allow much room for error. Think Cliff

Lee won't feel the pressure come game one?

Counterargument Three:
The stipulations of trading for Lee were more favorable
for the Phillies.
True statement, though slightly skewed.
The Phillies managed to get the reigning AL Cy
Young Award-winner without sacrificing their top
pitching prospects in the minors.
But what are the chances that any of those prospects
pan out to become as good as Halladay?
There are thousands of pitching prospects in the
Major League farm systems, and very rarely do they
become the pitchers they are predicted to become.
Why not take the bigger risk and trade for Halladay,
if it means domination (and perhaps a few more championships) for the few years to come?
You can always reload on prospects that have potential; you can't always acquire one of the best pitchers to
ever start a game.
Is it even a risk? I think it's a risk to rely on CliffLee
to be the ace in your rotation. He's able to produce some
brilliant starts, but there are those games when you

really question his consistency.
And consistency is important. One friend of mine
comments on how much of a crapshoot winning in the
postseason is, but it's not entirely random.
Batters with a .333 batting average obviously don't
go one-for-three

in every game. But the more consistent

players are, the less influence chance has on the out-

come of a game.

Roy Halladay has the ability to give the Phillies the
kind of consistency that would provide them with the
greatest chance to win the World Series this year.
From 2002-2008, Halladay started 50 more games,
pitched 506 more innings and won 50 more games than
Lee did (he's only lost 10 more). And he's only a year
older.

If I'd had any influence in the Phillies organization,
there would have been no question as to whom I would've
tradedfor this July.

It's no secret that the
force of impact at the professional
level
is
absolutely tremendous,
the type of thing that
mere mortals such as ourselves couldn't possibly
understand.
Having played contact

sports my entire life, I
have to admit that there is no way I can comprehend
the damage done to one's head in the type ofcollisions
that we see occurring consistently in professional
sports.
In general, I feel as though this issue is most
salient in professional football, especially considering
the concern raised by former players (such as Patriots
linebacker Ted Johnson) who claim that numerous
head injuries sustained over their careers have
caused tremendous consequences in their post-football lives.
Consider this: not two weeks ago, a story broke
across the sports world about three NFL players (the
Baltimore Ravens' Matt Birk, the Seattle Seahawks'
Lofa Tatutpu and the Arizona Cardinals' Sean Morey)
who are planning to posthumously donate their
brains to a program that studies the effects of sports
injuries on the brain.
Certainly, this example illustrates a growing concern of current NFL players about the condition of
their heads (though I doubt any of the three will call
it quits because of the imminent danger).
Clearly, the NFL deals with an incredible amount
of trauma to the human skull and brain because of
two simple reasons.
First, the culture of the game is one of aggression
and violence.
Second, because the sheer size, speed and strength
of the athletes who play professional football is much
beyond the capabilities of the average human.
Though the NFL season is still young (only three
weeks in), I can't watch a game without someone commenting on the strangeness of new helmets in the
NFL.

It's been four years since I have last donned a football helmet, and I have to admit that some of the new
helmets I see players wearing look pretty modern.
It seems fairly clear to me that companies that traditionally manufacture these helmets, such as Riddell
and Schutt, have put forth strong efforts to upgrade
the protectiveness of their products.
For example, Schutt's lON 4D helmet boasts an
"Energy Wedge" that helps to absorb as much as 15
percent of the force of an impact on the facemask.

I take technological upgrades such as this one with
a grain of salt, however. For instance, I don't necessarily believe that an increase in the amount of
padding a player wears will be beneficial. Consider a
standard sixteen-ounce boxing glove compared to a
four-ounce mixed martial arts glove.
Competitors in mixed martial arts must constantly
contemplate how each thrown punch could theoretically result in a broken hand if not connected within
a proper set of guidelines.
Thus, boxers are much more able to throw punches
with disregard because of the fact that the boxing
glove naturally absorbs more of the shock by design
than the mixed martial arts glove.
The result is a higher rate of head injuries in boxing since the competitors are throwing bombs on each
other.
Taking this analogy into the world of football, I
worry that a helmet that allows players to deliver a
higher impact with the facemask without as much
pain may lead to more reckless and forceful hits that
in turn cause more injury.
Though not an NFL player yet, I'm sure many of
you have seen the highlight of Florida Gators quarterback, Tim Tebow, getting concussed in his game on
Saturday.

Let's be honest. That was a pretty tremendous
impact that left a frightening image of an unconscious
Tebow on the turf. It was impossible not to cringe at
the sight ofhis teammates trying to pull up an unconscious Tebow, only to watch him flop back to the
ground.
Equally concerning was the fact Tebow's injury
could not be written off as a result of the athlete's lack

of size or athleticism.
In fact, it is well documented that Tim Tebow is literally a physical beast (with tons of good karma to

boot).

There's no doubt that much of the publicity surrounding Tebow's injury centers on the fact that he is
an iconic face of college football as we know it.
Several questions remain in the aftermath of that
shocking play.
Could the injury have been prevented by modern
equipment?
Certainly in the coming decade, much new information about the effect that traumatic head injuries
have on the human brain will come to the surface.
Fortunately we live in a century of constantly improving science and technology that will no doubt spill
over into the world of professional sports.
I hope that modern advancements in protective
headwear will soften the blows of the NFL enough to
make a significant impact on the physical (and mental) well-being of its players long after they retire.
Like many of you, I enjoy watching football on the
weekends (including the big hits and blocks that make
the fans go wild, of course). I hope that none of us will
lose sight of the fact that these athletes put their bodies on the line for our entertainment every week.

The penalty that set up the winning goal was
called when Garnet midfielderRoberto Contreras IV
'l2 was given a red card for illegally handling the ball
after goalkeeper David D'Annunzio 'l2 had been
pulled off the net to save a previous shot. Contreras
was sent off, and moments later, visiting Swarthmore
was handed its first loss of the season.
Parkinson's goal broke another streak, as well. To
that point, D'Annunzio had not allowed a single goal
all season
a total of 501 minutes in which no opponent was able to post a score against the Garnet.
D'Annunzio finished with five saves against
Dickinson.
"It was a great soccer game," Swarthmore head
coach Eric Wagner said after the game. "Both teams
battled hard in crazy weather in front of one of the
best crowds I've seen at Dickinson, and in the end
[Dickinson] deserved the victory. They outplayed us
just a little bit there at the end."
As evidenced by the score, the match turned out to
be exactly the kind of physical, grinding contest that
was expected
the kind that exhausts the players
mentally just as much as physically.
Neither team ever dictated play for an extended
period of time; the momentum went back and forth.
"[ln the next game], we're going to try to tackle
more creatively," Wagner said.
The numbers confirm the impression of an evenly
matched game. Dickinson held slight edges in saves
(6-5), corner kicks (8-5) and fouls (20-19), but led in
total shots 17-10, including the only one that ended up
mattering.

"It was just a great college soccer game," Wagner
said.
Midfielder Dylan Langley 'lO led the team with
three shots, while Morgan Langley 11 added two.
Following the match, the disappointment was evident, but the players, with nearly no exceptions,
maintained a positive outlook on a season very much
on the right track.
"This is only a test for us to see how well we can
bounce back," defender Pierre Dyer 'l2 said afterwards.
Swarthmore has ample reason to stay positive.
Despite the loss, the 7-1 start is its best since 2005
(another 7-1 start), which says a lot in a program that
has gotten used to hot streaks early in seasons.
In the last five seasons, the Garnet is a combined
30-7-3 through its first eight games of the season,
never going worse than 5-2-L
Much of this credit, Wagner insists, is owed to the
program's foundation. "We're a strong team all the
way down the roster, and [the fast start] says a lot
about how we've built the program, and it's a reason
that I think we'll be competitive for years to come,"
Wagner said
Despite the fact that they lost to a team against
whom they have traditionally excelled (the Garnet is
3-1-1 against the Red Devils in the past five years), the
team is not particularly worried about that, either.
"[We are] on the cocky side of things, Dyer said.
"We all know that we will defeat them [if] we play
them again this season."
Maybe that confidence is justified. Swarthmore
bounced back to crush Washington (2-7, 0-3 CC) last
night by a score of 6-0.
The Garnet will try to start a new winning streak
when they return to Clothier Field on Saturday to
play Gettysburg CoUege (4-2-2. 1-1 CC). Action will

Women's soccer falls to JHU, crushes Washington
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

The No. 12 Johns Hopkins Blue Jays
10 on goal
(7-2, 2-0 CC) blasted 23 shots
as they defeated the No. 20
Swarthmore women's soccer team (8-2,
2-1 CC) by a score of 1-0 on Saturday

afternoon at Clothier Field.
The loss dropped the Garnet to 1-1 in
the Centennial Conference and 7-2 on
the season.
But even after falling to 12th ranked
Hopkins, the Garnet moved up three
spots in the national rankings from 20th
to 17th. The Blue Jays rose to No. 10
with the victory over the Garnet.
Hopkins and Swarthmore are ranked
second and third, respectively, in the
Mid-Atlantic region, behind national
No. 1 Messiah.
And the women are ready to bounce
back and continue their competitive
play
throughout
the Centennial
Conference schedule.
Midfielder Alyssa Bowie 'l2 is confident that she and her teammates can
respond to the loss and build from the
game in which the team had four shots
on goal among a handful of other scoring chances.
"After the Hopkins game, I think we
realized that we're most successful, as a
team, when we play a possession-minded game
that's our strength," Bowie
said. "We need to really focus on playing
to feet and staying composed when we
have the ball."
Fifth-year head coach Todd Anckaitis
agrees. "The only way we can see if anything has been learned from the
Hopkins loss is to see what happens in
the next couple of games. Lessons about
possession, composure, competing and
confidence were woven throughout,"
Anckaitis said.
After the Garnet's only other loss, a 20 decision against The College of New
Jersey, the women bounced back strong l
ly. "We responded well to the TCNJ loss
with good results against a nationally,
ranked Dickinson and a regionally
ranked Widener, so I expect they'll be
ready for their next set of exams,"
Anckaitis added.
Anckaitis has turned the Garnet into
a national power.
Swarthmore won
back-to-back ECAC championships in
2007 and 2008, with last year's team
going 10-4-6.
The Garnet have been incredibly consistent this year, especially considering
the graduation of a strong core of seniors, including Lauren Walker 'O9, who
started every game in goal last year.
A year later, Walker has joined the
coaching staff, and Marie Mutryn 'l2 has
emerged as the new stalwart on the goal
line for the next three years. In her first
month as a starter, Mutryn has already
been named Centennial Conference
Defensive Player of the Week and ECAC
Co-Defensive Player of the Week.
Mutryn has allowed only six goals in
the first nine games this year and she is
quick to complement Walker and her
defense, which recorded three team
saves in a two game span last week.
"Having Lauren on the coaching staff
is awesome. I really get to learn from
her because she has so much experience
with the college game. She basically
trains me personally every practice and
it really helps having the one-on-one
attention she gives me," Mutryn said.
The sophomore added that "the
defense in front of me [has been] great,

and I always feel really protected and
comfortable with them. Everyone on
defense is aggressive and will do anything to keep the ball out of the net."
Anchoring that defense are veterans
Taylor Rhodes 'lO and Eileen Earl 'lO, as
well as Laura Bolger 'IL
But the veterans have not been the
only ones to make strong contributions
in the back, with Haley Most 'l3, Alexa
Ross 'l3 and Ariana Spiegel 'l3 all seeing
significant playing time at midfield and
defense.
According to Bowie, "[The firstyears] have really added depth to our
squad as a whole. We have strong lines
across the board."
The transitionfrom 2008 into this season has been about much more than new
players, though. After experimenting
with a 4-3-3 formation last year, the
Garnet has switched to the 4-3-3 fulltime.
"Last year, we tried the 4-3-3 a few
times, but now we're really focusing on
using it as a way of being strong through
the center of the field and having numbers up in our attacking third. It's forcing us to be a smarter team on the
whole, making us really think about the
choices we make on the field, and
encouraging us to be dynamic in every
position," added Bowie.
This strength up front has been evident, with Swarthmore outscoring their
opponents 19-6 through the first ten
games, despite being unable to bury a
shot against Hopkins.
Tuesday night saw a shot-frenzy at
Clothier Field, as the Garnet had some

fun after jumping out to a 3-0 lead after
the first period against Washington.
Swarthmore outshot the Shorewomen
35-2 and had 11 corner kicks in the
blowout.
Mutryn wasn't called on for a single
save against the Shorewomen, who fell
to (5-3-1,1-2 CC) with the loss.

Megan Colombo 'll scored two on the

way to a 4-0 Swarthmore victory.

Right back on track.
Swarthmore will next play three
straight road games starting with a 1
p.m. contest at McDaniel (2-6, 1-1 CC) on
Saturday. The Garnet will return home
on Oct. 21 against Ursinus at 7 p.m.

Astonishing hockey upset thwarted in overtime
BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@swarthmore.edu
It would have been the upset
of the year. Ready to walk away
proud for keeping up with No. 7
Johns Hopkins (6-1, 2-0 CC), the
Garnet (4-4, 1-1 CC) held the

Centennial Conference rivals
scoreless through the first half.
It was an impressive showing
for a team that had fallen to the
Blue Jays in a 7-0 rout just one
year ago.

Maybe Hopkins let their
guard down. But maybe it was

just that time. Whatever the reason, Sophia Agathis 'l3 decided
to make it interesting with 12
seconds to play.
Connecting with a last-

minute pass from Sara McCabe
'll, Agathis found the back of the
net for the second time this season, stunning the Blue Jays and
sending the cluster of devout
fans at Clothier Field into a frenzy.

Goalkeeper Gina Grubb 'lO,
who made 15 saves including a
stellar mid-air deflection in the
first period, knew that the game
would be a challenge.
"We adopted that attitude of
being the underdog," Grubb said.
"We wanted to show them what
Swarthmore field hockey was all

about."
And that they did. With the
score tied at 1-1, a recharged
Garnet forced the game into
overtime.
The high was short-lived,
however, as Hopkins salvaged
the game four minutes later with
a second tally from senior standout Brittany Bland.
Even though a loss is a loss,

over the Garnet's 4-0 loss to the
Shorewomen last year, a blowout
in which Washington jumped out
to a 2-0 lead in the first 12 minutes and never looked back.

The Garnet will travel to
McDaniel (3-5,
1-1 CC) on
Saturday for a 5 p.m. contest
before welcoming non-conference
Manhattanville (5-5) to Clothier
Field on Sunday at 2 p.m.
In the meantime, the Garnet
looks to gear up and return to
the form that kept them in the
running against Hopkins. "It's
all about having that same intensity. Then we'll be fine," Fuchs
said.
