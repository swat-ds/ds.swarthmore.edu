Swarthmore College*Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

UC Berkeley Settles with Swat Professor
By

Min Lee

Professor Maribeth Graybill of the Art Department
won a compensation of $ 113,000from the University of
California in a court settlement between the school and
the Justice Department two weeks ago, after the school
had denied her tenure twice in the last seven years.
Graybill—now tenured at Swarthmore—alleged that the
decisions resulted from sexual discrimination. Graybill
started working at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor
in art history in 1981. Eight years later, she and another
female colleague submitted their applications for tenure.
According to Graybill, while the tenure review procedure still remains within the department, candidates receive summaries of evaluations submitted by various
reviewers. According to Graybill, one particular review
included numerous factual errors and was written in a
highly critical fashion. "The reviewer used an extremely
vituperative language...the report was simply page after
page of derogatory comments," Graybill remarked. Her
colleague discovered similar problems; they noticed that
the reviewer applied the same descriptions to both of
them indiscriminately.
Both women subsequently sent lengthy reports to the
committee pointing out the mistakes. The reports were
added to their respective review files. However, since
their reports were given lowest priority, as the review

process reached higher authorities, no one encountered
their complaints.
To Graybill'sknowledge, theadministration had sensed
a problem with the review procedures within the department and pointed them out to the Title IX officer at UC
Berkeley. According to Graybill, the administration then
proceeded to conduct its own investigation: an official
read all relevant documents, including the reports that
Graybill and her colleague filed.
On the last day of their contracts, both Graybill and her
colleague received notice that their applications for tenure had been denied. However, they were given each a
special one year special contract. This offer was approved
by the president of the entire UC system.
Soon after the school notified Graybill of its decision,
the Title IX officer contacted her, suggesting that the
review process may have been flawed, and that she and
her colleague reapply for tenure the following year. In
1990, the two submitted their tenure applications again.
The second time around, unlike on the previous occasion, they received the unanimous support of the department. When the process reached a higher level committee
consisting offull professors, members of the group found
no reason to overturn the decision of the previous year.
The chancellor at that time, who has the final say in
matters where the department and the committee conflict,
chose not to take a stand on the issue. According to

Graybill, a probable reason behind his inaction was the
fear of "antagonizing such a powerful committee"before
his departure. Graybill gathers thatthe incoming chancellor, Chang-Tien Lin also took no action partly for the
same reason. On top ofthat, "since the ninth year contract
was negotiated orally...there was no paper trail indicating
that there was a problem with the original decision.,"
Graybill stated. In the end, both candidates were denied
tenure again.
At this point, the Title IX officer again approached
Graybill and pointed out how her case was part of a trend:
"There were fairly consistent patterns in the way they
looked at women...they found a way to make everything
sound negative." Graybill continued, "for example, if a
report came in praising a female faculty member for her
teaching they could say that she...neglected her research,
whereas ifa male candidate was said to teach poorly, they
would say something like, 'well, he promised to do a
better job next time...'"
In October of 1990, Graybill took her case to the local
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office, with
the support ofher department. In July of 1991, the office
released a report which found strongly in her favor. The
EEOC, which does not have the legal power to pursue a
case against a public institution, attempted "moral suasion," which was not effective. The case was then passed
to the Justice Department, which accepted it.

Swarthmore Remembers...

The JusticeDepartment then researched the case again,
reviewing previously undisclosed documents and interviewing Graybill and various personnel at UC Berkeley.
Officials from the department approached the school
with a settlement proposal last fall, to which Berkeley
readily agreed. The university, however, denies that
Graybill was treated differently because of her gender.
Between 1988 and 1991, however, five other women
received compensation for alleged tenure related sexual
discrimination.
"I felt a tremendous sense of vindication," Graybill
commented on the actions of the Justice Department,
"The fact that an external agency which had no reason to
advocate forme took the case and... actually went through
the trouble of reviewing confidential documents I had no
access to....gaveme great emotional satisfaction." Graybill
also hopes that the publicity surrounding her case will
encourage other women in similar situations withoutthe
financial capabilities to turn to public agencies for help.
Regarding compensation, the Justice Department follows a policy of seeking "wholerestoration." In her case,
this would mean to demand that the university must put
her in the financial position that she would be in if not for
the school's discrimination. She has yet to receive the
check, and is not sure what the amount will be after taxes.
"It's not much money," remarked Graybill. Any immediate spending plans? "I bought apair of earrings," she says
cheerfully.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
By Tony

Sturm

While millions of people were celebrating
Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a day off from
work or school, Swarthmore students grudgingly attended their first day of classes on the
holiday to honorthe deceased civil rights leader.
As on Labor Day, students were not excused
from classes. The College did, however, organize two special all-campus collections to commemorate the reverend from Memphis.
On Monday evening, over 200 students, faculty, and community members filled the Friends
Meeting House to celebrate his life. After singing the black national anthem, Lift Every Voice
and Sing, and a short prayer, those present were
treated to a performance by the Chester Boys
Chorus.
Reverend Paul Washington of North Philadelphia then spoke about Rev. Martin Luther
King, Jr. Rev. Washington became nationally
known when his Episcopal Church stirred controversy by ordaining the first 11 women into
the priesthood in 1974. He opened up his church
to many groups that were protesting injustices
around the world, and has received numerous
awards for his achievements.
Rev. Washington spoke for about half an

hour, giving a biography of King. Washington
focused on the less well-known side of King. He
described how King loved football, got the name
"Tweedy" because he loved tweed suits, and
was also known as "loverboy" because of the
way women fell for him.
Washington also described how King vowed
not to become a priest, instead choosing to attend
law school so that he might better fight inequities
Later, however, he became a minister, studied
Ghandi, and adopted the philosophy of civil
disobedience and passive resistance.
He concluded his speech by pointing out that
just 29 years later, "[King] would have seen the
Republican National Committee and the Democratic NationalCommitteebegging Colin Powell"
to join their parties. He contrasted this state of
affairs with the reality established by the 1854
Dred Scott decision, which ruled that no slave or
descendant of a slave could ever be a United
States citizen.
The program ended with a moving rendition of
We Shall Overcome, in which all audiences members participated.
On Friday at 1 p.m., a second collection will be
held, at which Eugene Lang '3B, founder of the
I Have a Dream program, will give a speech
entitled "A Dream for All of Us."

Dorms Renovated for Spring Semester
Dana, Hallowell, and

Mertz get a new look after
College spends hundreds of
thousands on renovations
By

Nate Myers

A few pleasant surprises awaited residents
of Dana, Hallowell, and Mertz when they
returned to their halls after winter break.
C & C Construction completed renovations
totaling roughly $200,000 in each dormitory
over the break.
In Dana and Hallowell, the corridors were
recarpeted and repainted while new lighting,
bulletin boards and message boards were
mounted. In the bathrooms, new shelves were
installed and old stalls were replaced. An
extensive inspection of the plumbing in each
building was also undertaken, resulting in the
replacement of several toilets.
Similar improvements were completed on
the second and third floors ofMertz. In addition to the installation of new carpeting and
lighting in the hallways, kitchens were updated with new countertops and floor tiling,
and the burlap lining the halls was removed.
The walls and doors also received a new coat
ofpaint, and message boards resembling those
in Dana and Hallowell were attached to the
doors.
Most Mertz residents were pleased with
the results. "Thehalls are great and white and
bright, and the dual-surface message boards
were an excellent choice" said Mertz 3rd
resident Ilmi Granoff '99. Mertz 2nd RA
Rahul Sakhuja '9B agreed, remarking "it's
beautiful and so much brighter. I think they
did a good job." Catherine Laine '9B, also on
Mertz 2nd, needed time to adjust to the new
look, admitting that "the lighting and paint
makes the hall look brighter, just in an eerie
sort of way...like the Twilight Zone."
Reactions in Dana and Hallowell were also
positive. "The lighting is nice in the halls;
they have a warmer glow than before," said
Dana Ist resident Andrew Brown '97. "I love
the renovations. It makes it feel warm and

cuddly, especially the new lights," said Dana
2nd RA Becky Ndosi '97.
Ndosi, however, was concerned that the
plumbing problems involving toilets in her
hall'sbathrooms had not been fully addressed.
"The toilets haven't been functioning for a
number of years; they don't flush properly
and overflow a lot. The next step would be
working on the toilets and the rooms themselves," said Ndosi.
Ila Deshmukh '99, on Hallowell 2nd,
thought that the money was well spent but not
properly allocated. "It looks awesome. But
the money should' ve gone to something more
important, like the toilets. The new carpet
will be ruined ifthey keep overflowing."
Myrt Westphal, Director of Residential
Life, acknowledged the recurring problems
with the Dana and Hallowell bathrooms. "I
think that certain buildings have weaknesses
which are hard to address. The plumbing in
the Dana/Hallowell building is its weakness."
However, Alice Balbierer, Assistant Director for Special Projects in Facilities Management, pointed out, "There's nothing wrong
with the toilets. The few that the plumber felt
might be problems were replaced." Balbierer

by Diana Hunt

said that any outstanding problems are due to
foreign objects, such as hairbrushes, toothbrushes, and combs, clogging the pipes.
The renovations were not completed without a few snags. In Dana and Hallowell,
student belongings were accidentally thrown
out along with trash generated during the
improvements. "They threw away everything.
We were never notified," said Thanh
Hoang '97, aHallowell3rd resident. Balbierer
said that the contractor has promised to reimburse students with the full value of their lost
articles.
In addition to the more visible improvements, new drains were installed in Lodge
Six to solve drainage problems, and a walkthrough assessment was conducted in Mary
Lyon in preparation for extensive renovations planned for this summer. According to
Balbierer, replacing the bathtubs with showers and a series of shelves is the highest
priority, since it would solve many of the
current leakage problems in the building.
Plans are also underway to carpet Mary
Lyon's corridors, patch and plaster its walls,
install new lighting, replace doors, and complete comprehensive room-by-room repairs.

On Wednesday evening, students, underthe auspices of Empty the Shelters (ETS)
participated in a protest in front of the state office in Philadelphia. The protest was
sponsored by the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), and was organized in
response to the welfare bill recently passed by the state of Pennsylvania. About 30
protesters engaged in civil disobedience, blocking traffic on Broad Street while
holding signs and banners. In addition to eight Swarthmore students, about 100
people participated in the protest, including members of two labor unions and
various religious groups in Philadelphia.
Pennsylvania's welfare bill details the allocation ofblock grants given to Pennsylvania under Clinton's welfare reform bill. Protesters objected to Pennsylvania's
bill, which will go into effect in early March, because it will force mothers off
welfare after five years and not allow them to receive welfare again. Also, the
Workfare program will force welfare recipients to work regular jobs for about
sl/hour and without receiving common employee benefits. Labor laws which
guarantee the health and safety of workers do not apply to recipients ofWorkfare.
Under the new bill, welfare recipients will also no longer receive child support.
They must sign contracts of mutual responsibility, which are dictated by their case
worker. These contracts stipulate certain behavior and life goals to which the
recipient must conform in order to continue to receive welfare.
Although implementation of the bill will not be halted, according to Green, this
protest was important because it "got a lot of attention to the subject." Ilmi
Granoff'99 agreed, saying that "Workfare will affect the entire economy," decreasing the pay ofother jobs when employees hire welfare recipients, who are paid little
and do not receive benefits.
Swarthmore students also participated out of a sense of civic responsibility "to
other people as members of society," stated Granoff. Beth Green '97 stated that it
was important that "students are represented in protesting welfare and punitive
measures against poor people in our country."

On Saturday, the Japanese-born dancers
Eiko and Koma will perform their 1991 work,
Land, in the Lang Performing Arts Center.
The husband-and-wife team of Eiko (the
woman) and Koma (the man) have been performing since 1971, when they met as college
students in Japan. They began dancing under
the tutelage of two of the foremost teachers of
butoh dance.
In 1972 they began performing in Europe,
studying modern German dance, and have
since developed a performance style drawing
from both that and butoh. Initially they refused to perform in the United States as a
protest against the war with North Vietnam,
but in 1976 they moved to New York, where
they have lived ever since.
Eiko and Koma compose and choreograph
all their works themselves, often without any
musical accompaniment. Land is one in a
series of works with environmental themes.

The pair has spent much of the last two years
performing a later work, River, in outside
venues around the East and Midwest, including in the Delaware River near Lafayette
College in September 1995. Their two sons,
Yuta and Shin, have danced with them on
occasion.
Land was born when Eiko and Koma visited Taos, New Mexico; it grew out of their
admiration for both the landscape and the
Pueblo Indians living there. In creating the
piece, they collaborated with composer and
flutist Robert Mirabal, a Pueblo native of
Taos, and New York visual artist Sandra
Lerner, whose original painting serves as the
set. Upon seeing the piece, one Washington
Post critic wrote, "Land is a montage of
images at once ancient and eternal, humble
and awesome...as ever, Eiko and Koma are
mesmerizing in their ability to transfigure
themselves and their surroundings."

Based on the novel by Roddy Doyle,77ie
Commitments is Alan Parker's fine, funny
portrait of 12 take-no-"shite" Dublin
twentysomethings and their hopes of transcending their destitute surroundings by making it in a band. Robert Arkins plays the
idealistic blue-eyed manager Jimmy Rabbitte,
who must assemble the musicians and give
them a crash course on soul music. Once
things get going and the band starts learning
how to play, Jimmy finds himself navigating
the feisty, rather unwieldy group as best he
can on the pitch black road to stardom.
It ends up being slightly more than he can
handle. Jimmy is treacherously wooed by the
promises of his creepy trumpeter Joey "the
Lips" Fagan (Johnny Murphy), an older man
who claims to have jammed with 8.8. King,
Wilson Pickett, and the like. Deco, the lead
singer played by Andrew Strong, may have
the "voice of God," but he certainly has no
trouble pissing off everyone in the band, and
constantly sexually harasses the three female
Commitments. And the saxophone player
Dean (F6lim Gormley) soon finds soul too
constrictive and begins taking steps to express himself through jazz, including getting
the dreaded "jazz haircut." It is no surprise
when things ultimately fall apart, but Parker
keeps it lighthearted right up through the last
scene of the movie.
But even though the Commitments become dysfunctional as an ensemble, their
story does not end in bleakness and depression: things still turn out relatively okay for
these people. Perhaps they would have been
more successful if they had stayed together
and worked out their differences, but you get
the feeling that their experience with the
Commitments did indeed manage to leave

them aii with something to look forward to.
As Dean at one point says to Jimmy, "It feels
much better being an unemployed musician
than being an unemployed pipe fitter."
Although Dublin provides the necessary
working class backdrop, The Commitments
does not overtly dwell on class politics. It is
much more concerned withcharacter interaction and the fact that these 12 people, no
matter how much they may ultimately hate
each other, can somehow make music together. The moviemay sometimes get carried
away with its passionate emphasis on "soul"
(a word replete with obvious symbolism), but
it is nonetheless a fast, funny ride that will
leave "the crowd calling out for more."
Irelandis also the backdrop for Neil Jordan' s
lavish biopic Michael Collins, starring Liam
Neeson as the Irish freedom fighter. Costarring are Aidan Quinn as Harry Boland,
Collins' friend and co-leader; Julia Roberts
as Kitty, the woman loved by both Boland
and Collins; and Alan Rickman as Eamon de
Valera, future political leader ofIreland. The
story begins with the Easter Rebellion and
follows Collins until his tragic death.
The mo vie' s production values are extraordinary. The music, by composer Elliot
Goldenthal, brings a stunning third dimension to the story. The period re-creation is
flawless and the cinematography is beautiful.
But even with all the elements in place,
Jordan's movie is still strangely distant. He
apparently shopped this project around Hollywood for years and years before finally
getting the green light in 1995. But Jordan
seems to have made lots of historical and
character sacrifices to 'punch up' the drama.
In the end, however, the performances and
the filmmaking skill make the movie more
than worthwhile. But it doesn't quite seem as
ifMichael Collins is telling the whole story it
wants to.

Jackie Chan Fever Strikes Again In Theaters
By

Patrick Runkle

Just in case you're like me, and every time
you walk into a movie theater you say, "Boy,
I wish there were more cheap, dubbed Jackie
Chan movies playing here," New Line Cinema has released Jackie Chan's First Strike,
a ridiculous, silly movie that isn't very good
but has lots of charm.
Let's start with the title. I think it's thefirst
movie ever to claim a possessive relationship
for the star. It makes no sense, because it
comes up and says, "Jackie Chan in Jackie
Chan's First Strike." The whole point of

doing something like "David Lean's
Lawrence OfArabia" is that the director gets
up-front credit. But here, the star gets upfront credit twice. Maybe that's because the
movie's only asset is Chan himself.
The previews for this movie look like a
cross between The HuntFor Red Octoberand
Goldeneye. But, with its half-baked plot and
fake comedy touches, it's actually more like
a cross between Weekend At Bernie's and
your parents' home videos of their trip to
Australia.
Jackie Chan's First Strike falls prey to
some other misrepresentations as well. The

ads for the movie make it seem to be Chan's
US-made debut. The posters say, "Jackie
Chan fights for America in his biggest action
movieever!'' However, as soon as this movie
starts, it becomes quite clearthai it was made
in Hong Kong and Australia and is almost as
obviously dubbed as Rumble In The Bronx
and Supercop. In fact, in Asia it's the sequel
to Supercop and it's been out for a year. So
as for Jackie Chan fighting for
America..considering the plot, let's just say
that's stretching it.
In this movie Chan plays a Hong Kong cop
named Jackie (imaginative, huh?) tracking a
suspected Russian mafia member. Sent to
Russia, he gets caught up in aplot to sell some
nuclear missiles. He ends up in Australia
being pursued by just about everyone. He
meets Annie (Chen Chen Wu), who works at
an aquarium. This provides an excuse for: a)
shark attacks, b) underwater fights, and c)
Jackie dressed as a porpoise.
Jackie Chan's First Strike does have some
charm, most of which comes straight from
Chan himself. He has more than enough
charisma and energy to perk up every scene
he's in. The fight scenes are also brilliantly

staged, which is par for the course as far as
Chan's movies go.
Still, Jackie Chan's First Strike was a big
letdown for me. The pacing of crucial plot
information is lost in the translation; it's
nearly impossible to figure out what's going
on, especially at the beginning, where there's
lots ofchoppy scenes all cut together. And the
plot is, shall we say, not very engaging.
Things pick up as it goes along, but it never
reaches the glory of the hovercraft in Rumble
or Jackie hanging off the helicopter in Supercop. It's just not too terribly exciting. I think
thewhole thing clocks in at about 80 minutes,
and I wanted a whole lot more action and a
whole lot less explanation of the lame plot.
And it crossed the line between fun action
movie and dopey action-comedy way too
often.
I've heard that one ofChan's absolute best,
Drunken Master 11,is being dubbedfor American release in August of this year, and I'm
sure more Jackie Chan movies are on the
way. In the future, I don't care if he's fighting
for America in his biggest action movie ever,
I justhope he's doing something more exciting than Jackie Chan's First Strike.

ORDER

Deeply For

The True
Meaning
Of "Avuncular"
My favorite word in the English language
is avuncular. No, I'm not going to make you
look it up. It means "like an uncle." So if, for
example, your sister is avuncular, it means
that your sister is acting like your uncle. It
also means that your sister is in need of some
serious family counseling, but you get the
idea.
There are countless reasons why I love the
word "avuncular." It contains the letter "v"
and I think "v" is a wholly underrated letter.
"V" is to the alphabet what Keanu Reeves is
to the cinema. Neither of them is taken seriously. Sure, they're each lovely, decorative
things that people like to look at, but they
have substance and quality, too.
In addition, avuncular is a big word that
makes you sound smart even whenyou use it
incorrectly. You could inspire great awe in
the ignorant minions by saying something as
goofy as, "The avuncularity of your argument makes me question your true motives
behind the theft of the last Ding Dong." Heck,
even though this statement makes absolutely
no sense, they might even give you back that
Hostess treasure they stole.
Another reason I love this word is because
it's meaning is so subjective. What are the
characteristics of an uncle? I mean everyone
knows what motherly means because mothers are universal. They're loving, nurturing
and suffocating. But who the heck knows
what an uncle acts like?
This means that everyone must have a
different definition for avuncular depending
on their personal experiences with their own
uncles. I have many uncles, so avuncular has
many meanings for me. Sometimes I think of
an annoying, old guy who always tells you
you've got something on your shirt and when
you lower your head to look down at your
supposedly soiled garment he hits you on the
nose. That uncle, needless to say, gives the
word avuncular a negative connotation for
me.
Another uncle ofmineis dead, so he doesn't
really help me craft a good definition either.
A third uncle of mine, though, makes me
think of an eccentric older gentleman who
gives gentle noogies and tells funny stories.
He gives avuncular a better name.
One of the best stories my uncle ever told
me involved two of his neighbors. One of
these neighbors had a little, fluffy, floppyeared bunny rabbit who resided in a cage his
backyard. The other neighbor had a big, hairy,
one-eared dog whoresided in a canine kennel
in his own backyard. The big, hairy, oneeared dog had repeatedly dug under the fence
to greet the little, fluffy, floppy-eared bunny
rabbit, but the dog had never succeeded in his
salutatory mission. However, one fine summer evening, the big, hairy, one-eared dog
arrived at his master's back door holding a
filthy, bloody, dead rabbit in its mouth. The
neighbor was aghast and feared thathis neighbor, the rabbit's owner, would make some
sort ofretaliatory strike against the big, hairy,
one-eared dog if he discovered the dog's
transgression. The dog's owner decided that
he had to conceal the ugly truth from his
neighbor, so he took the filthy, bloody, dead
rabbit from the big, hairy, one-eared dog,
washed it, blew it dry, snuck into the
neighbor's yard and placed the now clean but
still deceased rabbit in to the cage.
Several days later the two neighbors met
and the rabbit's owner told the dog's owner
that the strangest thing had happened the
other day. You see, his rabbit had died of
purely natural causes and he had buried it in
the backyard. A few days passed and the man
noticed that the dead rabbit had somehow
returned, though lifeless, to the cage. The
man was completely dumbfounded. He, to
this day, still believes the rabbit was resurrected from the dead only to return and again
die in his beloved cage.
That's a story for Unsolved Mysteries if
I've ever heard one.
Oh, by the way, my other favorite word is
bovine, but I couldn't think of any good cow
stories to tell you.

National Trend Threatening Support Groups
By

Vincent Jones

Will 1996 godown in history as the
end of the second reconstruction?
One hundred years ago, the Supreme
Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson,
which validated the
doctrine of
separatebut-equal,
to many,
signified the
end of the
first recon-

struction.

A letter from the editors
There are certain goals and values that any newspaper holds to over the
years, regardless of the different editors that come and go. These commitments include the maintenance of journalistic integrity, always striving to
report the truth, and allowing all voices, no matter how dissident, to be heard.
In this sense, the mission of The Phoenix has always been one that is larger
than any particular group of editors that works to produce it.
As the primary record of the various events and issues central to Swarthmore, The Phoenix strives to be as honest and objective as it can be when
informing the College. It hopes to be a forum to express opinions and ideas,
both about the smallercommunity of students, and the larger community of
the College. It serves to represent and advocate for the community as a
whole. The Phoenix is unique in placing students, faculty, staff, and
administration on an equal footing: by encouraging and printing letters to the
editor from all members of the Swarthmore community, the paper tries to
ensure that every voice—regardless of its PhD status and the size of its
paycheck—gets a chance to be heard.
This general commitment certainly should be held, for it represents the
ideal of what any newspaper hopes to achieve. However, we feel that it is
somewhat lacking because it does not allow us to put our personal stamp on
it. The start of any semester brings about a reshuffling of faces behind the
editorial positions listed in the staff box; often, brand new staff-members
come in to add their touches to this newspaper. Because of the fresh voices
and perspectives that are on board, we would like to take the time to explain
where we—this particular Editorial Staff—hope to take The Phoenix this
semester.

We would like to bring people's attention to what they are not already
thinking about. At Swarthmore, we have a tendency to get wrapped up in our
classes and our own groups of friends and organizations. But in order to
promote this community, we also need to know about what may not initially
appear to concern us directly, for instance, faculty and staff issues. This
semester, we hope to bring these and other issues to the forefront of our
coverage and discussion. Although The Phoenix is essentially a student
publication, students also need to be aware of the myriad of other voices in
our community. As students, we must be familiar with the educators and
adminstrators who play such a tremendous role in our lives.
We are also concerned with serving as a forum for student activities and
projects. There are many student organizations on this campus that devote
enormous quantities of time to special events for the community as a
whole—Poverty Awareness Week, Survivors' Week, Coming Out Week,
and so on. We would like The Phoenix to serve as a liason between these
events and the community. It is important for all students to be informed
about these events in order to be able to benefit from them. The participants
and organizers shouldbe able to voice their opinions about such events, and
we hope that organizations will feel comfortable using ThePhoenix as such
a vehicle.
This semester, we would also like The Phoenix to serve as a means of
challenging what is wrong at Swarthmore. We strive to keep the reputation
of our community intact, but feel it is essential that all members are also
aware of what is in need of change. By bringing various issues to the focus
of discussion, and encouraging debate and conversation within the community, we hope that we will come to an understanding of what we know to be
wonderful about Swarthmore, and about what can be changed to benefit all
of us. It takes an entire community to better itself, and we hope that The
Phoenix may serve as a first step towards that improvement.

Why we are now in

bins

77ie Phoenix is no longer to be found in your mailbox. That's right, you will
now have to go to a bin outside the mailroom and get it for yourself.
Yes, it's strange, but we think you'll get used to it.
What initially got us thinking about a change was the amount of time that
it took to stuffall mailboxes last semester. But we also havemade this change
because of the concerns of you, our reader.
We collaborated with Earthlust and conducted a poll at Sharpies, near the
end oflast semester. The results showed us that you don't really mind the bin.
Out of the 372 responses to the question, 33.6 percent preferred getting a copy
in mailboxes, while 26.9 percent wanted to pick it up from a bin. There were
39.5 percent ofyou who didn't care either way (in the true Quaker spirit), and
that made the difference. Given these numbers, we feel that it will not
dramatically hurt our readership to give the bin system a trial run.
Since people will be able to pick up a Phoenix only if they are going to read
it, we will be able to better gauge how many of you read The Phoenix and
reduce the number of copies we print accordingly. Right now, we print
enough copies of The Phoenix for every student and staff member, whether
or not you will actually read it, and still have plenty of copies left over every
week. This is an immense waste of paper; having you all take papers out of
bins means that we won' tha ve to print papers for thoseof you who don't want
to read one.
Even if you do want to read The Phoenix every week, there are justtoo many
copies of The Phoenix circulating the campus. It's ridiculous that every
person gets an individual copy, when it would be very easy to read your
roommate's, or your hallmate' s, or the copies lying around in Tarble. We hope
that by placing copies in bins, we will reduce the amount of paper we need to

use.
So we hope that this works for you. We feel that this is the right thing to do,
and would appreciate your cooperation in at least a trial run. However, if you
are displeased with our decision, or know of someone who is, please contact
us with comments.

Is MLK Forgotten?
By Katalyn

Vidal

On every third Monday in January,
when Swarthmore begins its spring
semester, the rest of America honors
one ofthe most influential civil rights
leaders in the country, the honorable
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Though
he is especially dear to AfricanAmericans, people ofall raceschoose
on this day to remSmber his legacy of
peace and love. It is odd that the
entire state ofArizona was chastised
for refusing to acknowledge Dr.
King's birthday and yet Swarthmore
chooses to begin its new term on the
same day.
Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr. was the
man who dreamed a dream that very
few dared to express in the tumultuous era ofthe 19605. He gavethe civil
rights movement a new vision built
on the power of love and unity, as
opposed to anger, in order to break
down the barriers of racism in this
country. He fought for all people who
were oppressed under the demoralizing force ofhate. He was a champion
of the people, by the people, and for
all people, at a time when they needed
him most. He was not afraid ta reach
out to an ignorant world and try to
change it.

fort has been launched at Swarthmore (again) by a few members of
our so-called student government
with the assistance ofcertain College
employees. You may have noticed
candidates declaring their support for
or against support groups during this
recent election cycle and probably
had no clue what they were talking
about.
Well, some ofour "representatives"
on student council have been working to start a "discussion" of support
groups, their role on campus and the
legal issues involved. In their view,
support groups such as SASS, SAO,
HOLA and SQU exclude other students from being members, which
goes against "the law."
However, they neglect to consider
the impetus for support groups and
the unique role they play on campus.
When SASS was formed as the first
support group in the late 19605, the
African-American students on campus saw the need to address the racist
(either blatant or hidden) actions of
the College.
For instance, did you know that as
recently as the 19605, Swarthmore
would only recruit accept and attract
"safe" (middle or upper class, nonurban) Black students? Or that the
first Black student accepted here, in
the 19205,had been sent to Dartmouth
after his race was discovered? These
and several other factors contributed
to the formation of SASS.
Throughout the 27 years thatSASS
has been in existence, it has been
either directly or indirectly responsible for a number of policy changes
and activities which allow AfricanAmerican students to take full advantage of all of the opportunities that
Swarthmore has to offer. The same
can be said of most other support
groups on campus.
If certain Student Council members succeed in delegitimizing support groups, growing portions of this
community will not be allowed the
means to force theCollege to address
their particular needs and create an
institution which celebrates diversity
in more than words. Moreover, a negative message will be sent to students
considering Swarthmore, alumni, and
the entire College community.

Capitalism Simply

Does Not "Work"
By

Brian Schwartz

In my years of discussing politics,
I have not found any underlying premises upon which non-libertarians
base their political beliefs. But now I
have discovered their sometimes unacknowledged principle: the government should involveitself in people's
lives when the result of people dealing with each other on a strictly voluntary basis does not yield the result
they desire; that is, when capitalism
does not "work."
Another way of phrasing this idea
is: "In a free society, some people
may not do what I want them to do,
like giving their money to a certain
group of people, so it should be illegal not to do such things." This is the
principle behind most people's advocating governmentalinfringement on
the rights of others.
Since I valuethe lives ofindividual
humans, and since humans can live
as humans only if they are free from
coercion from others, I value the protection of individual rights. Hence, I
hold that the sole purpose of government is to provide protection of civil
and economic liberties.
I have naively wasted my time looking for logical inconsistencies in
people's arguments; they would reevaluate their arguments to eliminate
contradictions. But people base their
responses to my free market beliefs
on fear. Since many cannot imagine
how things the government tries and
often fails to do now can be done
without coercion, threats, and extortion, they cling to governmental action to force people to do what they
want them to do.
Here is a sampling of someone's
thoughts: "How do I know people
will get educated (the way I want
them to) without compulsory government schools? How can I be guaranteed that people do not go hungry
and have health care (without a law
dictating which charities we must
give to)? How can I feel secure
(without the FDA) that people will
not do drugs?"
These concerns are valid, but laws

proposed to pacify them have deleterious effects: the public school system involves extortion and discourages parental and student responsibility. Welfare results in "diffusion
of responsibility," which kills the
benevolence that free people show to
each other. Socialized medicine increases demandfor health care, which
raises costs for those who pay for it,
so more people cannot afford care.
The government's paternalistic
externalizationof the cost of people's
shortsightedness and irresponsibility
rewards fools at the expense of selfresponsible people.
I can point out inconsistencies, such
as pro-choice advocates supporting
the FDA, which forbids women and
men the right to control their bodies
by keeping drugs off the market. I can
tell supporters of gay marriage that
people should be free to interact as
they please, but they favor the minimum wage, which inhibits employment choices.
People want the government to
stamp out "monopolies," but are advocates of coercively-held government monopolies on schools, charities, mail delivery, drug testing, and
health care. These monopolies eliminate competition, and hence the incentives for efficiency and innovation required for producing the technology responsible for today's, and
tomorrow's, standard of living.
But people do not care about logical consistency or extortion, or even
if government programs "work."
They want to feel secure—secure that
someone claims to be doing something about a problem.
"Yeah, but still, how can I get
people to do whatI want them to do?"
In a free society, people will not, and
hence, capitalism does not "work." I
do not have a problem with this fact,
as people are not on this planet to
serve me, or some "higher cause"
called "god" or "society." Freedom
is not a means to achieve some
"higher" goal of a collective, but the
endresult of a government protecting
the life, liberty, and property of all
individuals.

Tragic Event Reveals Swarthmore 's True Spirit

Dear Editor:
MichaelDurkan was my neighbor,
my colleague and friend. Two of his
kids went through school with my
kids. It saddens me that he was taken
from his life so suddenly, just when
he had arrived at ajumping off place
for a whole new and more leisurely
life. However, we theremaining have
been blessed with many gifts from
Michael and one that I would speak
to was his memorial service held on
November 15thin Lang Concert Hall.
For some reason, gatherings such as
that one bring out the true essence of
Swarthmore College to me. This is a
fine place, held together by many
fine people. In the hassle of day to
day stuff we tend to fail to remember
therichness found here. As I sat in the
concert hall and looked around at all
of the people I have known here at
Swarthmore in the twenty-two years
I have been here, I was proud once

again to have the opportunity to share
space with these folks, to feel the true
community that we really do have
here. Sadness seems to be the one
thing that brings us together. When
we put aside all the things thatburden
our days and take the time to come
together to publicly share in acknowledging the loss of someone we value,
and telling of the gifts we have received, we become about the best we
can be. I was grateful once again to be
a part of this community and to be
able to partake in its rich offerings.
I'm sure that the Durkan family appreciates the caring and support they
havereceived from Swarthmore College and I hope we here at theCollege
gain some reaffirmation of our faith
in what being at Swarthmore means
to us.

Economics Proves More Parking Not Worth It
Dear Editor:
Please reconsider your analysis of
the campus parking issue (11/22/96).
Engineers are trained to build. Therefore, if you ask engineers for a response to the campus parking problem, they will inevitably propose to
build more parking.
I suggest that you consider the problemfrom another point of view.There
is a shortage of parking at the College
because the College subsidizes it.
Staff, faculty and some students who
drive to campus are provided with
free paved and monitored parking
spaces. The cost of providing these
spaces is built into the general College budget, meaning that those who
do not use the spaces subsidize those
who do. This is not a trivial cost.
Dave Mimno's Phoenix article reports that it should cost about $2

million to build 250 new spaces, or
about $B,OOO per space. This implies
a cost to the College of at least $BOO
per year per space.
The article concludes, "as long as
SEPTA remains expensive and inefficient, there will always be a need
for adequate parking." Has it occurred
to you that SEPTA is comparatively
expensive because theCollege subsidizes parking but not the use of public transportation? Is it appropriate
for the College to make those who
travel by foot, train, and bus pay for
the parking spaces of those using
polluting private cars? Do you think
that the parking shortage might disappear if the College charged those
using its parking spaces the full cost
of the spaces?

By

Across the CentennialConference,
the Track and Field season is close at
hand. Swarthmore boasts its largest
team in recent memory. Two and a
half months of preseason training
culminated in the Yale Invitational
and Haverford All-Comers meet in
the last week of winter break.
On January 12 at the Yale Invitational, there were several dramatic
events. The men's distance medley
relay was assembled using 75% of
lastyear's ingredients: Phil Jones' 99,
who ran the 1200 in 3:29.4, Graham
Lucks '9B, who whizzed through the
800 in 2:07:7, and Wyn

Strodtbeck'9B, who dashed through
the mile in 4:32.9. The new and deadly
element is Eric Pakurar '97, who flew
through the 400 leg in 51.4.
In the field events, Steve
Dawson'oo, recovered from his knee
injury, leaped to third place overall in
the high jump.
The men's 4x4 team, consisting of
Mason Tootell '99, Strodtbeck, Walid
Gellad '97, and Pakurar, faced difficulties. Strodtbeck lost approximately
nine seconds after being momentarily
stripped of his footing, while Gellad
had to dodge a bystander on the track.
Despite the mishaps, the team closed
in style as Pakurar blazed through the
final leg in 51.1.

The Haverford meet took place on

cruising to a 74-65 victory over
Pomona.
Against Occidental, Schall and A.J.
Shanley '97 contributed with strong
performances. Schall scored 23
points, grabbed 11 boards, and had
five assists. Shanley scored a careerhigh 26 points and added seven rebounds and five steals.
Despite some strong individual performances, Swarthmorecontinued to
play inconsistently when it returned

home.
In consecutive losses to Franklin
and Marshall, Drew, and Washington, the Garnet played an excellent
first half but came out of the locker
room cold. The team trailed perennial powerhouse F&M by only two
points at the halfand led by eight over
Drew and six over Washington.
On the one hand, the Garnet didn't
hit their free throws. In the three
losses the team shot 36%, 58%, and
54% from the charity stripe. MeanwhileF&M spent most of the second
half at the line and sunk 22 of its 24
attempts after making all six of its
first-half attempts.

The team's defense could not be
blamed for the recent losses to Washington, 58-59, and Ursinus, 51-55.
The Shoremen shot a mere 33% from
the field but capitalized on 24 Garnet
turnovers. The Bears shot only 39%
but held the Garnet to the same percentage. In the second half theUrsinus
defense clamped down and limited
Swarthmore to 24% shooting including only two of its 11 three-point
attempts.
"I think we've had good scouting
reports and [the players] have done a
great job following them. If someone
had said we'd hold Washington and
Ursinus to [scoring in] the fifties, I'd
have said we'd have won," saidCoach
Wimberly.
Swarthmore must continue to follow the game plans and trust that the
pieces of its offense will come together soon.
The victory over Muhlenberg has
proven that Swarthmore can beat any
team in the conference, and the only
remaining question is whether the
players can use the win to build their
confidence.
Saturday, the team travels to Western Maryland to face the Green Terror in another important conference
contest.

Are There Dumb Swat Jocks?

Jennifer Z. Chen

Attending a college known for its
excellence in academics and not in
sports, I have often had the "duty" to
defend Swarthmore athletics against
the slew of insults from friends at
Division I sports. "Is it possible for a
football team to lose as many games
as your school did?" they would attack. "Obviously, it's possible. We
did it," I would snap back.
Then I wouldremind them that our

title these past two years and that

The men's basketball team took a
major stride Wednesday in reversing
a four game losing streak that has
come perilously close to endangering the entire season. The Garnet
knocked off Muhlenberg, who had
been sitting in first place in the East
Division, in a dominating fashion.
The win improves the team's overall record to 7-8 and its Centennial
Conference record to 2-3. The conference record puts the team in third
place in its division, but the top two
teams, Washington and Muhlenberg,
who each have two losses and are by
no means out of reach.
After a strong start in which the
Garnet won its first three contests
and entered winter break with a 6-3
record, the team had faltered recently
in dropping two important contests to
conference opponents Washington
and Ursinus.
Co-captains Ben Schall '97 and
Colin Convey '97 took the initiative
to right the team in its contest against
Muhlenberg. Schall led the Garnet
with 21 points and 11 rebounds, his
fourth double-double of the season.
Convey added 17 points and dished
out six assists.
Convey was instrumental in preventing a fired-up Muhlenberg team
from cutting into the Garnet's 32-21
halftime lead. The Mules started the
half well, but Convey drained threepointers on three consecutive possessions to answer the charge.
Coach Lee Wimberly's defensive
gameplan worked well, especially in
the second half. The Mules were unable to regularly penetrate the Garnet
zone and couldn't convert on their
perimeter shot opportunities.
Until their victory on Wednesday,
the team had struggled in the second
semester. The Garnet returned from
winter break early and traveled to
California to face Occidental and
Pomona-Pitzer, who coincidentally
attended Swarthmore's annual Equinox Classic tip-off tournament this
year
In each of the games the Garnet
couldn't muster a strong 40 minutes
of play. Against Pomona, the Garnet
blew a 17 point lead in the last eight
minutes of the game. The next night,
they came back from a 15point halftime deficit to hand Occidental an
eight point loss.
There were few bright spots in the
Pomona loss as the team struggled to

shun any physical activities aside
from walking from their rooms to
classes, Sharpies and, of course,
McCabe, there are still some of us
who actually enjoy "Sweating to the
Oldies" without Richard Simmons or
athletic scholarships prodding us.
There are those of us, who at this
politically correct institution, still
have to overcome the stereotypes of
being a jock. The source of this stereotype is our peers... at S warthmore.
Think people! How is it possible that
this college, which U.S. News and
World Report has ranked as the"Number 1 liberal arts college in the country" and where most teams have losing records still has "big, dumb
jocks"?
Obviously, few people outside of
Swarthmore College would say that
our athletes are good enough to have
been admitted solely to play sports. I
would say that here at Swarthmore
more people would be better able to
tell you the date of the Norman Conquest than the date of the next
Superbowl (which is this Sunday, by
the way). Also, since when didpeople
say to themselves," Playing for the

Motherpuckers will be the launchpad
for my National Hockey League career."? Have you ever seen a
Swarthmore t-shirt sold at a store,
asidefrom our bookstore? Don't most
people still identify Swarthmore as
an all-women's school in Upstate,
New York? Obviously, the jockshere
sweat and bleed because they enjoy
the sports, and definitely not for the
glory of appearing in my section.
Well, one of those Swarthmore
jocks who made it good was Neil
Austrian, the current president of the
National Football League. Austrian
played both offensive and defensive
end for the Garnet Tide and was
named to the first team All-East Small
College Team in both his junior and
senior years when he was the captain.
His No. 25 jersey was retired in a
private ceremony on Friday, December 6 when most Swatties were studying for finals. Although no Swattie
may ever play in the NFL, NBA,
NHL or MLB nor Swarthmore t-shirts
be sold in sporting-goods stores, we
may someday run these organizations.
Austrian did it. Therefore, forSwatties
of all generations, we did it!

Struggling

to

By Alejandro

Montero

Instead of having long relaxing
winter breaks, the Garnet wrestling
team returned to Swarthmore's campus as early as January 5 to prepare
for the rigors of two home tournaments and a challenging dual meet
season.
Practicing twice a day, once at ten
in the morning and again at seven in
the evening, served to get the team
ready for their competition. During
this period there were a number of
additions to the team's lineup: Sean
Lewis 'OO, Lou Basenese 'OO, Alec
Stall '9B, and Pete Balvanze '9B.
Both Balvanze and Stall are fresh
from semesters abroadand bring with
them leadership, experience, and
thumpings.
At the Team Challenge Tournament, held on January 11, and the
Swarthmore Invitational, held on
January 18, the Garnet faced wrestling powerhouses such as Roger
William's University,Kings College,
Elizabethtown College and Duke
University. The squad's top performer continues to be sophomore
co-captain Adrian Wilson who posts
a total season record of 14-3. Stall
and Lewis have been able to perform
extremely well despite not wrestling
for the fist half of the season. Cocaptain Scott Timm '99 has successfully qualified for his weight-class
and is expected to have his opponents gasping for air shortly. Matt
Kahn '99 recently returned to wrestling, after having taken last season
off in order to recover from knee
surgery. Also improving rapidly are
freshmen Jesse Bean, Aaron
Kobernick, Alejandro Montero, and
"Big" Paul Willenberg. All in all the
wrestling team has built a solid foundation that should bring a successful
conference standing andfuture domination.

Swimming in the Rain
Training trip proved to be both valuable and
wetfor the swim team's performance and unity
By Shari Linden &
Kristen Robertson

Swarthmore's swim team returned
from theirFlorida training trip wetter
than ever. The men's and women's
teams completed nine days of intensive aquatic training in the South. As
an added bonus, the Sunshine State
decided to welcome the hydrophiles
with some extra water —five days of
rain! But the swimmers soaked it all
up, leaving them with a final day to
absorb some rays.
A typical day consisted of double
workouts in a pool over'twice as long
as Swarthmore's Ware Pool. The trip
finished up with challenge sets for
every one. These leftthe team psyched
and ready for the stretch run of the
season.
At the end of the week, the
Swarthmore swimmers won their
meet against the B team of nationally
ranked Pine Crest.
A small, spirited faction of the
woman's team demonstrated why
they are better swimmers than cheerleaders. The team switched elements
on Friday night as the chanting around
the pool carried over into singing
around a bonfire.
Wednesday night, the teams had
their first meet of the year against
Johns Hopkins. Both teams put up a
good fight despite their worn down
muscles.
The women's team started out
strong in the 400 yard medley relay
with Claire Arbour's 'OO stellar finish in the 100 freestyle in a lifetime
best of 54.64. Molly Marino '9B and
Shari Linden '99 continued the trend
in the 1000 free, each posting season
bests. Marino went on to win the 500
as well, with Liz Blair 'OO close behind, posting timesof 5:30 and a 5:34
respectively.
Although the woman didn't finish
as strongly as they began and ended
up losing to Hopkins, they had many
strong swims in the second half of
the meet. Jenny Harvey '99 and Melissa Amir-Arjomand 'OO in the 200
yard breaststroke and Elisabeth
Newcomb 'OO and JoDeHendrick'OO
in the 200 yard butterfly had fine
performances.
The men' s team also swam a tough

meet and managed some good races

against a very fast group of athletes,
who assistant coach Leisha Shaffer
dubbed a "perennial national powerhouse."
Mark Friedberg '9B finished the
400 individual medley in 4:26 to rival his best in-season time. Andy
Robbins '9B seized second place in
the 200 backstroke. Ari Plost '9B
made an impressive return in the 100
freestyle, having spent the fall semester away from Swarthmore and
out of the water.
All in all, the swimmersperformed
well. At this point in the season, they
can only look forward to the increasing rest and decreasing times of the
final meets
a few short weeks
away.
