Cries for tolerance
amid hurt feelings
Community responds to IC vandalism
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

Laura Holzman Phoenix Staff

A broken wooden sign bearing Swarthmore Queer
Union's name and logo occupied center stage on Tuesday
at the Friends Meetinghouse.
At one point, Assistant Dean and Intercultural Center
Director Rafael Zapata took the sign down from the wall and
knocked on it to show that it was thick and had been supported by a wooden frame. This action was meant to highlight that the sign's destruction had been a deliberate act.
Eight days after the SQU portion of the sign outside the
Intercultural Center was destroyed, the deans, Student
Council and the IC hosted a discussion on the vandalism.
About 65 students attended.
The forum opened with remarks by Darryl Smaw, associate dean of multicultural affairs, who said the discourse
should focus on establishing "what happened, why it happened, what we can do to keep it from happening again."
Smaw later steered the discussion away from solutions,
saying he wished to focus on "feelings ofhurt" that had yet
to be expressed.
For the next half hour, a panel of student representatives from the IC, SQU, Queer-Straight Alliance and
Student Council shared their perspectives on the event.
Multi President Nicola Wells 'O5 emphasized the importance of "giving voice to how we feel as IC members and

Deans and students gathered in an open meeting Tuesday to discuss the repercussions of the SQU vandalism.

Board to vote on intellectual property policy
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore will adopt its first intellectual property policy next semester, pending a vote of approval from the Board of
Managers.
The
Affairs
Academic
Committee of the board, which met early
this month, has already approved the policy, and the faculty has passed it with a
unanimous vote.
Based on the extent to which intellectual property (IP) has an "identity or functional interest" to Swarthmore, the policy,
if passed, will determine who owns specific
IP output
the individual or the college.
Almost all IP that faculty and students create would belong to them, but most staffcreated IP would belong to the college,
because it would relate directly to the identity or functioning of Swarthmore.
The policy would effect few immediate
changes, as many of its requirements are
based on de facto principles the college
already has. But it could encourage the college to support the development of new IP,
professor Steve Maurer said, and it could
influence peer institutions as they form
their own IP plans. Maurer chaired the
Intellectual Property Task Force that was
charged with creating the policy five years
ago.
As for the income IP generates, the policy does not require that it go to the owner,
said professor Larry Westphal, another
task force member. After expenses have
been recovered for IP the college owns, the
policy recommends that the income be
split, with 25 percent to the college and 75

to the creator.
Everything

create
at
Swarthmore will continue to belong to
them, unless the college is paying them to

produce something in its name, such

as an

official Web site.
For professors who employ students in
their research, the policy would require
that the professor "ensure an understanding about ownership of any IP produced"
and would urge professors write their student workers a "letter of understanding"
to be recorded with the provost, at least
for the first two years the policy is in
place.

Since most IP that staff produce is central to either the identity of Swarthmore
(for example, an admissions brochure) or
to its functioning (such as a computer program for course registration), most staff IP
would belong to Swarthmore under the
new policy, which is "close to the status
quo," according to a statement Maurer
wrote for the Board of Managers.
Westphal said the college's library staff
had once created new software and made
an internal decision to give it to other colleges free. Under the new policy, the college
would consider such IP to be key to the
functioning of the college. The software
would have to be reported to the provost,
who, with the creators, would make a decision on ownership rights through deliberation.
But, because faculty usually produce IP
relating directly to their own research or
teaching, not to the college, most of what
professors create would belong to them.
Exceptions would arise if a professor
produced something where "the college's
good name was at stake," Westphal said,
citing as an example a videotaped course
that featured Swarthmore students in a
classroom.
In cases where IP produced by staff did
not relate directly to Swarthmore, the individual could retain ownership. If a dean

published a book about dorm life, for example, but did not write about Swarthmore or
its students specifically, he or she would
own the rights to the book, because
Swarthmore's identity would not be at
stake, Maurer said.
He added that he thought this possibility, though it could reduce the total amount
of IP the college would own, might benefit
Swarthmore in another way.
"We think this will help attract good
staff," he said. "My hunch is that this will
lead to staff owning more IP."
It is the emergence of new types of IP
that has created the need for an official policy, Maurer said in a statement to the

board early this month. Courses on the
Web or CD-ROM, for example, require
more collaboration from the college in the
form of technical support or funding, and
they are generally more marketable than
the traditional article or book.
"Until five to 10 years ago, it was rare
for colleges to have intellectual property
policies at all," Maurer said.
Provost Connie Hungerford said the
proposed policy "makes a statement about

what kind of intellectual community we
are
one that isn't profit-driven but
rather wholly committed to creating and

sharing knowledge."
contrast
to
In

the
for
policy
Swarthmore, where almost all IP produced
by faculty and students would belong to the
creators, many large universities claim
ownership of all the intellectual property
their faculty create, except for traditional
articles and books, Westphal said.
Patents on inventions in engineering
and biotechnology, followed by software,
are the kinds of IP with the most profit
potential, he added, and some big universities have formed IP policies with the spe-

October 9, 2003

cific goal of making money.
Maurer pointed to Columbia as an
example of a school for whom IP revenue
constituted "a significant budget item," netting about $138.5 million annually.
"You could even say IP policies at these
universities are driven by revenue considerations. The policy we have framed is
very different," Westphal said, in that it
determines ownership based on the nature
of the IP produced, not who funded or produced it.

Up to this point, the college has dealt

with commercial IP through a system of
"benign neglect," Maurer said, in that "it
rarely claimed ownership [of IP], but it
didn't help IP get developed." Now, knowing it could get a return in the form of compensation or rights from certain types of IP,
the college would have an incentive to support them.

If the policy passes, it will require
reporting the creation of IP to the provost
only in situations where ownership is
unclear. This would include projects
substantial
collaboration
involving
between members of two or more sectors of
faculty, students and
the community
staff
and creations requiring more than
normal support from the college.
The policy now awaits authorization
from the entire board, which will review
and vote on two distinct components: the
IP policy itself, which sets broad guidelines
for ownership and revenue, and an addendum, which recommends ways to adminis-

ter the guidelines.
The goal of the task force was that the
policy, once passed, remain as is but that
the addendum component undergo revision if necessary in the future. "We want to

leave room for discussion where things are
murky," Westphal said.

members of the greater community." She
pointed out that "this has not been the first
time there has been vandalism in our [the
IC's] home space" and discussed her feelings about having this "safe space" invaded
by unknown intruders.
IC intern for SQU Powen Shiah 'O6
pushed listeners to examine the greater
impact of the damage. "It doesn't have to be
homophobia. It's not about that. It's about
whether
you
can be different at

Swarthmore. We talk about how everyone
here is quirky and was beat up in high
school, but it needs to go deeper than that."
"I think there's a problem
at
Swarthmore,"
Student Council CoPresident Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 said, "a
problem of not being able to tolerate things,

whether it is posters advertising a movie or
conservative views on campus."
Some students drew comparisons
between this act of vandalism and removal
of flyers for Swat Survivors, an organization for people who have endured sexual
misconduct. College Republicans have also
had their message board defaced.

Others were unhappy with the comparison. They said being Republican was a
choice, while being queer was not. And
Republicans, they said, do not constitute a

historically oppressed group nationwide.
QSA board member Brian Nolan 'O5
reminded the audience that this was not a
solitary act and that posters advertising a
SQU movie showing had been removed
days earlier. He said acts like these seemed
to regularly occur. Nolan emphasized the
queer community's right to be outraged
over the vandalism without having the
campus attributing the incident to general

"I think that they needed to be clearer
about their purpose in having the discussion. One was to deal with the differentfeelings the students had in response to the
vandalism. That's important but not why I
was there. I was more interested in talking
about solutions as to how to handle group
alienation and conflict. I think they wrestled with that," Jacob Winkler 'O7 said.
"It is not enough to have a single cathar-

intolerance.

problem," Dean of the College Bob Gross

said. "It's being spread out, it's being
glossed over. Unless someone really hates
the word 'center,' it's a homophobic thing.
It's great to have IC allies, but this is targeted towards the queer community."
Students discussed whether conservative parties, or people who were uncomfortable with homosexuality, lacked a forum on
campus. Some advanced the idea that the
vandalism was a backlash. Laura
Mecklenburger 'O7 said the "absence of dia-

logue" led to an "underground fear."
"We are all so intelligent and open-minded here," she said. "It is even more frightening that the issue is not being touched."

Others were critical of the format of the
forum. Some said they would have liked to
have discussion expanded to all issues of tolerance on campus, while others wanted time
to discuss their feelings of hurt and fear.

added, saying he hoped the community
would work toward solutions.
"I was really pleased by the number of
students who showed up and the variety of
opinions expressed," Student Council CoPresident Anna Morgan 'O4 said. "We need
to have more discussion, though. This was
only a week after. People had not really

processed everything."
Some students regretted that the discussion was not more focused. "I think a lot of
good points were made," Shiah said. "But I

would have liked more discussion about
how to deal with homophobia and igno-

rance at

Swarthmore."

Rodriguez described Student Council's
efforts to set up a weekly or monthly open
mic on Parrish beach through which students could say whatever they wanted to.
"Let's face it," he added, "whoever tore

down that sign is probably not sitting
here." The first open mic will take place
this Thursday.
He regretted that Student Council had
not made its position more clear. "We had
planned to have two events, one by the
administration and then a fireside chat
about the greater problem of free speech on
campus. We didn't make that distinction as
clear as we should have. Some students felt
that we were downgrading the vandalism,
which we definitely didn't mean to do."
While Student Council will attempt to
address the general issue of free speech and
tolerance, the Office of Multicultural
Affairs is planning to organize small group
conversations that will target different topics involving diversity at Swarthmore,
Smaw told The Phoenix in an e-mail. He
will be available to meet "with students, in
their dorms, for late-night discussions
about how we build a more respectful, tolerant community."
At the meeting, Smaw also described
plans to create "sustained dialogues,"
groups of eight or nine students, faculty
and staff that would meet to discuss issues
of diversity for a longer amount of time.
The destroyed sign is on display in front
of Parrish, and students are encouraged to
write their reactions in the taped-off square
on Parrish steps.

California's Swatties Syllabi may be online
weigh in on the recall
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Student Council is

BY JOE PARK
jparkl@swarthmore.edu

As Tuesday came and passed, record numbers
of California voters turned out to vote for the
recall of current Governor Gray Davis, replacing

him with actor and businessman Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

Students.from the state were asked about their
opinions on the recall both before and after the
election, and many criticized the candidates, the
process itself, as well as the outcome.
Liv Herriot 'O4, of Palo Alto, was disappointed
at the results. "I think we can do better," she said,
referring to Schwarzenegger's win.
"He's got no political experience, and he
doesn't know all that much," Herriot said.
Herriot
was interested in seeing how
Schwarzenegger, an apparent fiscal conservative,
could solve a budget crisis without raising taxes.
Herriot, who cast an absentee vote against the
recall but voted for current Lieutenant Governor
Cruz Bustamante, said she thought there was no
reason for recalling Davis. Although Davis has
been criticized for being responsible for a weak
state economy, "I think California is just bored
and is trying to avoid a difficult situation, such as
higher taxes," Herriot said.
Aaron Cantor 'O4, of Capistrano Beach, also
said he would vote against the recall but that he
would vote for Schwarzenegger.
"I don't know enough about him. I'm not sure
anyone does," said Cantor, a Republican. "But I
like his attitude towards women."
Asked about last week's reports in the media
about a book proposal in which Schwarzenegger
was claimed to have admired Adolf Hitler, Cantor
said, "That's not too surprising. His father was an
S.S. officer, a pretty big one, from what I remember," referring to the notorious German paramilitary group during the Nazi era.
A Los Angeles Times investigation last month
had found that Schwarzenegger's father, though
not an S.S. officer, was instead a member of the
Sturmabteilungen, or SA, another Nazi paramilitary group. The Aug. 14 article had also discussed

4

a culture of silence in postwar Austria, highlighting
the possibility
that the younger
Schwarzenegger may not have known his father's
wartime role. Schwarzenegger is also quoted as
initiating a previous Wiesenthal Center investigation into his father's past.
Nonetheless, Cantor was dismissive of
Bustamante, mostly due to a controversial connection to '7os-era radical student group MeCHa,
which has been characterized as a racist sepa-

ratist organization by critics and as a legitimate
student organization by others.
Chelain Goodman 'O5, of Thousand Oaks, said
she doubted that the recall ofDavis would be good
for the state. "I know there were a lot of complaints ofhow he was doing, but I don't think they
found someone better," she said, noting the recall
process had cost the state millions of dollars.
Goodman said she thought Schwarzenegger's
candidacy amusing. "He's such a caricature," she
said. However, she was concerned that, by electing Schwarzenegger, California was electing not a
politician but an icon who perhaps would not be
knowledgeable for the job. Additionally, she said,
"I think now people are going to stereotype
California even more."
"I think they're making it a mockery of the
political system," said Anna Morgan 'O4, of Irvine,

on the numerous candidates who had campaigned. Some of the more notable names in this
group included Larry Flynt, former child actor
Gary Coleman, porn actress Mary "Mary Carey"

Cook, and of course, Schwarzenegger.

Morgan also criticized the voting process,
which had a ballot consisting of two sections. The
first was a vote for or against the recall of current
governor Gray Davis. The second section was a
choice of governor other than Davis. Under this
system, Morgan said, Davis could have lost with
49 percent of the recall vote, but Schwarzenegger
could have won with a plurality over other candidates.
"It's just kind of funny. I think it's unfortunate
that the world has yet another reason to make fun
of California," Morgan said. "I think they're more
for comic relief."

Gamelan group performs with Philly Orchestra
BY RYAN CROKEN
rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

Music professor and Semara Santi founder Tom
Whitman said the performance of a college ensemble with
a major American professional orchestra was, as far as he

knew, unprecedented.
Yet Swarthmore's own Gamelan Semara Santi, a group
of amateur musicians and students, recently had the
opportunity to perform onstage with the Philadelphia
Orchestra at Verizon Hall's Kimmel Center on Oct. 2-4
and at New York City's Carnegie Hall on Oct. 7.
Gamelan Semara Santi is the Philadelphia area's only
ensemble dedicated to Balinese musical compositions. The
Philadelphia Orchestra incorporated the group into its
program as part of a festival honoring the works of Olivier
Messiaen, the renowned 20th-century French composer
who drew much of his inspiration from Balinese music,
according to the orchestra's program.
Whitman said the Gamelan performed demonstrations
and full compositions of Balinese music, including the
works of I Nyoman Suadin, the group's other co-director.
On each night, the music of the Gamelan was followed
by a performance of Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony,
conducted by the orchestra's new music director,
Christoph Eschenbach.
"Eschenbach has been attracting attention since he
assumed the role of maestro, with his enthusiastic support
for new music, living composers and non-western styles,"
Gamelan member and religion professor Scott Kugle '9l
said.
"By inviting us to perform, Eschenbach was questioning the assumed role of the symphony orchestra, the formal barrier between musician and audience, and the
assumed superiority of Euro-America, embodied in its
music, over other societies," Kugle said.
Whitman and other Gamelan members said that many
orchestra and audience members approached them after
the show to congratulate them and thank them for introducing an invigorating new sound to the Kimmel Center.
Kugle said there were a few audience members who were
disturbed that students and amateur musicians shared the
stage with the professional Philadelphia Orchestra but
that most were enthusiastic.
"Many people came up to us after the concert was over
to express their appreciation at hearing something totally
new to their ears," he said.
German professor Marion Faber, who was among those
in the audience, called the concert a "stimulating event"
and added that it was a "real change ofpace for the Kimmel

Center."

Group member Liz Leininger 'O4 said the opportunity
and the experience of playing at the Kimmel Center was

both amazing and intimidating.
"It was fun to watch the expressions on people's faces

we played," she added. "Some people got really into it, and
others looked perplexed at first."
Before the performance at Carnegie Hall, Qian Li 'O5,
another Gamelan member, said that she was "bouncing off
the walls" with excitement.
Leininger added, "When I came to Swarthmore, I never
thought I would be playing at Carnegie Hall three years
later. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those of us
who don't plan on becoming professional musicians."
The Gamelan group is composed of a mix of Swarthmore
students, alumni and faculty. Leininger said the group "has
a great sense of community." Group leader Tom Whitman
added in a lecture preceding the concert that this sense of
community is essential for gamelan music, which is mod-

When classes resume after fall

at making throwing parties easier.
These changes include new spacespecific e-mail addresses for reserving Paces, Olde Club and the Rattech

earlier this week, students can now email paces@swarthmore.edu, oldeclub@swarthmore.edu,

having to track down the particular

SAC Co-Director Kristina Pao 'O4

it easier for students in the future,
since those addresses will not
change." She added that the reappointment process in the spring
often causes confusion about which

Students or groups proposing
parties will also be required to

Members of SAC hope the new

Discussion explores
justice efforts in Peru
BY GARTH SHELDON-COULSON
gsheldol@swarthmore.edu
Coming to terms with 20 years of massive
bloodshed and oppressive rule will not be easy
for Peru, but two experts on Peru's justice system explained Tuesday that the South
American country is attempting to do precise-

ly that.

The discussion, presented before a small
audience in the Scheuer Room, addressed the

origins of the conflict in Peru and the work of
the country's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which for two years collected
thousands of testimonies in an attempt to
build a complete picture of the atrocities committed in Peru.

Ishmael Khaldi said Israeli Bedouins were loyal to the Israeli government.

Bedouin speaker describes
Israeli minority's experience

On Tuesday afternoon, Khaldi discussed his personal allegiance to Israel

indicated that the Israeli government
is initiating better programs to educate
Bedouin youth and support Bedouin
communities than did the British during the mandate. For this reason, too,
Israeli Bedouins are loyal to the Israeli
government.
Khaldi's lecture was well-received
by students who attended. Many were
interested in the alternate perspective

and the Bedouin connection to modern

day Israeli secular society.
Khaldi explained in his lecture that
in the 19205, when Jews began immigrating to modern day Israel, there
were Bedouins already inhabiting the
region.
According to Khaldi, "being in the
same boat" with the ever-increasing
population of Jewish settlers created

"I don't know very much about
Israel in general. Typically, you expect
them [Arabs and Jews] to despise each
other. But that wasn't the case. It's very
good to hear that conflict isn't always
necessary," Katie Cassling 'O7 said.
Mix Gould-Werth 'O7 felt that
Khaldi presented "too simplified of a

nuances. I think the most important

an incentive for the Bedouins and the
Israelis to "live together, survive
together." The two groups entered a
long period of good relations.
Although Bedouins are currently
not required to serve in the Israeli
Defense Forces, approximately 75 percent of Bedouin men serve on a voluntary basis, Khaldi said.
In addition, he added, most
Bedouins want at some point to integrate themselves completely into
Israeli society, although they do wish to
retain much of their culture, including
respect for tradition and commitment
to family values.
Although Khaldi did not focus on
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict specifically, he did say a two-state solution
would be necessary to end hostilities.
In response to a question about the feasibility of a one-state solution, Khaldi
was short and to the point. "No. They
will live together, but they will continue killing each other."
Khaldi focused more on the
Bedouin attachment and loyalty to the
land of Israel and the Israeli government that provides for them. Bedouin
grievances, Khaldi said, are more

one that no one ever thinks about it
and it was important that it was
brought to light," She said.
Khaldi, the third of 11 children, is a
Bedouin from the Khawalid tribe, a

small tribe located northeast of Haifa.
In 1984, Khaldi left Khawalid and
moved to the city ofHaifa to attend private Arab high school. After returning
to Khawalid from a three-month visit
to New York City, Khaldi attended TelAviv University. During his studies,
Khaldi was drafted into Israeli border
police services. Khaldi is an exception
in his community, where college and
education are not part of the tradition.
Today,Khaldi is working for the Israeli
Defense Ministry, traveling and sharing the Israeli-Bedouin experience.
Bedouins are a cultural and ethnic
minority in Israel today. Since the
19205, they have shared both the security and economic burdens of building
modern-day Israel.
Im Tirtzu, or Swarthmore Zionists
for a Two-State Solution, organized
Khaldi's presentation.

Peruvian lawyer Maria del Carmen
Navarro, who serves as public-interest legal
counsel for people detained under Peru's
stringent and heavily criticized anti-terrorism
laws, gave an account of the escalating violence between rebel groups and the government that gave rise to the anti-terrorism laws
in the first place.
In 1982, she said, former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori handed over significant
power to the military with the intention of
quashing the Maoist "Shining Path" insurgency and other similar groups. Over the next
18 years, increasing military rule and harsh
legislation met with greater rebel aggression
to result in the deaths of 69,000 people on both

sides of the conflict.
Navarro then discussed the establishment
of the Truth and Reconciliation, Commission,
which was modeled after similar commissions in South Africa and Latin America. The
purpose of the 12-member commission, she
said, was to help investigate atrocities and
suggest reparations and reconciliation measures, thereby providing some measure of closure.

Navarro's talk was followed by a short lec-

ture by CUNY history professor Jose Luis
Renique, who focused on the historical climate in which the country's anti-terrorism
laws were passed. He contrasted Peru with
South Africa, saying that Peru had no system
of apartheid and was taken by surprise by the
rise of groups such as the Shining Path. Thus,
he said, there was "tremendous popular support" in the 'Bos and early '9os for Fujimori's

stringent laws and pro-military orientation.
Only in the mid- to late-'9os, he said, did the
regime become corrupt.
Renique then urged "bravery" when

con-

fronting the issue of the Shining Path insurgency.
"We as a country engendered the movement," he said. "We need to strive to understand how Peru created the problem."
The discussion was sponsored by the
Intercultural Center, Enlace, the Latin
American Studies Department and the Forum
for Free Speech.

Speaker shows living wage beneficial New publication will
focus on global news

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

In a lecture Friday concerning the benefits of a
living wage, Dr. Robert Pollin, author of "The
Living Wage: Building a Fair Economy," disputed

what he identified as false "unintended consequences" of living wage.
Pollin, a professor of economics at the
University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said that in
economic theory, an increase in unemployment
should result after the establishment of a higher
minimum wage.
In reality, Pollin argued, the last time the United
States' minimum wage went up, in 1997, unemploy-

ment actually went down.

"There are arguments about a living wage not
being economically feasible," said Harris Kornstein
'O6, a member of Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign. "[Pollin] showed these
claims to be false."
"There is relatively little evidence that minimum wages cause unemployment in the United
States," economics professor Stephen Golub said.
"But this is less true in Europe, where minimum
wages are much higher."

Serial e-mailer to pay consequences
Federal officials arrested a
disgruntled Philadelphia
Phillies fan Tuesday night in
California on charges relating
to e-mail fraud and electronic
hacking in a case that many
Swarthmore students will recognize.
Allan Eric Carlson, from
Glendale, Calif., is the man

responsible for a massive e-

mail hoax involving the

Philadelphia Phillies and

numerous e-mail addresses
from the local Philadelphia
area. According to federal prosecutors, Carlson has spent
much of the last two years
sending out e-mails attacking
the Phillies management.
Carlson would forge the e-mail

address so that they showed
up as being from writers at the
Philadelphia Inquirer and the
Philadelphia Daily News and
from the Phillies themselves.
Swarthmore students
received many of these e-mails
during a five-month span in
2001 and 2002 when the emails claimed that Phillies
management would not spend
enough money to field a competitive team.

Carlson's antics created

widespread system problems
for the people whose addresses he had stolen. According to

the indictment released in federal court in Philadelphia, since
many of Carlson's recipient email addresses were invalid,

the people whose e-mail identification Carlson had stolen
were receiving thousands of

"Fans have the right to
voice their displeasure," U.S.

said in an interview with the
Associated Press, "but these
were electronic attacks with
serious consequences. By

those systems and the businesses they supported were

It remains to be seen how the
Swarthmore community will
respond to student analysis of the
world situation. "It's definitely
going to bring a diverse point of
view," Agora writer Doru Gavril

'O5 said.

The new paper is the brainchild of a group of students headed by Lauren Fenton 'O6, executive editor and founder of Agora.
The newspaper will give a "view
on how [international news] will
relate in the U.5.," Fenton said,
and it will "go beyond simply
reporting the news."
The newspaper's main purpose is to create a forum for students to write about news in the
world and analyze these issues
using their personal experience,

particularly international stu-

dents and students who have
been abroad. "These students

will be able to use international
press from other countries to get
more than one side of [an] issue,"
Fenton said.
According to Fenton, it was
important that the articles go

beyond simply reporting news.
"Students can just get that from
The New York Times or any
other newspaper. Instead, students will be able to draw their
own opinions from these arti-

money, but Vice-President for

gave $1,200 to the newspaper for

production.
Agora recruited enough writ-

ers to have 16 articles for the first
issue. Fenton said recruitment
for writers took place through
several venues, including the
international club, e-mail and the
activities fair.
With Agora's funding and a
significant turnout of writers, the
paper looks to be able to support
itself, at least for its first year.
The editors of Agora plan to
print about 750 copies for the first
issue, which will contain about 16
articles. They will have a second

issue out by the end of this semes,ter and plan to run monthly in
the spring of 2004.

Fans of fine food will flip for these films
#7: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory creates
a fantasy world where everything is edible, except the
Oompa Loompas. Spoiled children traipse through a
candy wonderland and are punished in fitting food-related ways for their faults. Priceless Food Scene: Greedy,
chubby boy falls into river of chocolate and is nearly
turned into chocolate himself. Greedy, skinny girl is
turned into a blueberry.
#6: Duck Soup is a Marx brothers comedy from the
1930s and isn't technically a food movie as much as it's a
scathing political satire. The title, I feel, qualifies it, as do
the innumerable fat jokes. Priceless Food Scene: The slapstick popcorn vendor bit.
#5: Silence of the Lambs: has cannibalism ever been
so sexy? (See #9.) Priceless Food Scene: Guard brings aus-

tere prisoner Anthony Hopkins his dinner and Hopkins
eats him instead.
#4: Mostly Martha is a German comedy about a tightly-wound German chef being wooed by an exuberant
Italian who comes to work in her kitchen. It plays on
stereotypes but is fun to watch anyway. Priceless Food

(Disclaimer: of course this is arbitrary. And had I seen

#10: 9 1/2 Weeks is known for being a movie about sex;
its subtext is that high-powered career women in the 1980s
secretly wanted to be dominated by wealthy, emotionally

unavailable creepy men. It brought food-themed kinkiness
into the mainstream. Priceless Food Scene: Kim Basinger's
boyfriend blindfolds her and empties the contents of her
refrigerator into her mouth.
#9: The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover is
a disturbing postmodern look at family and relationships,
set mostly inside a restaurant. Hard to decode and hard to
swallow, but memorable. Priceless Food Scene: Angry wife
serves intimate part of dead lover to her husband.
#8: The Matrix and its sequel are notable for bringing
humanity's consciousness of food to a new level. Does the
chicken taste of chicken, or are we simply programmed to
think so? Priceless Food Scene: "Matrix: Reloaded"s manipulative master of the universe sends woman a piece ofcake
.which triggers her desire to sexually service him in the

restroom.

food preparation even overwhelms the plot.
#2: Like Water for Chocolate takes as its premise the
idea that food can trigger strong emotional reactions. A
young woman literally pours her heart into her recipes
and everyone she feeds feels her pain. Priceless Food
Scene: After eating quail with rose petals of desire, guests

flee the table to satisfy their sudden lust.
#1: Delicatessen, set in the indeterminate future, portrays a world in which grain is scarce and people must
eat each other to survive. The blackest ofblack comedies,
surreal, and deftly handled by the director of "Amelie."

A Slice of Sharples: Eat yourself happy

Cook away that nasty cold with some comfort foods

BY REBECCA ENNEN

rennenl@swarthmore.edu

Suddenly, it's freezing outside. Midterm
exams are upon us. The dreaded Viral Cold
is striking for the second time already this
year. Break is but a day away, yet there
remains a mountain of work to climb
before sweet, sweet vacation is yours. The
soul, in despair, cries for succor. What's a
kid to do?
Two words: comfort food. Yes, you can
find cathartic release by consuming a
soothing snack. Given the current weather
which will get worse before it gets betsoups
ter, what with that "winter" thing
and hot drinks are the order of the day. If
you feel a telltale throat-tingle, signaling
the early stages of the evil Swarthmore
cold, these can help you down the recommended "plenty of liquids" and kill off that
nasty little microbe. Plus, there's nothing
for indulging self-pity like a mug of something warm and fragrant.
When you're overworked and exhausted, the tendency is to eat starchy foods, but
the energy these foods provide is shortlived, producing a mental crash as your

blood sugar drops abruptly. Sharpies food
can be deadly
beware of pasta bar. It's a
good time to eat fatty food —especially ones
high in protein, like peanut butter and
eggs.
If your stress is mostly mental, solace
might be sweet or savory. Preparing and
enjoying a treat is a good way to give yourself a break. It's a terrible habit to work
while eating or to hurry through meals.
Take the extra time to give your mind a
rest. Turn your attention to feeding your
body.

Ants on a Something
Brings you right back to elementary
school, almost: Sharpies cuts the celery too
small for logs. Instead:
Mix a large dollop of peanut butter with
a small dollop of apple butter, a smaller dollop of honey, and a dash of salt. Dip a piece
of apple, carrot, or celery into the peanut
butter mixture, then into sunflower seeds
or raisins, and munch away.

01' Faithful Chili
Last semester, I ate this for nearly every

meal. Now I live offcampus, and I still eat it

all the time. It's fast and filling, good over a
salad, with a toaster quesadilla or plain.
Mix together one ladle of chili, one ladle
of refried beans and one ladle of salsa. Add
a spoonful of corn and a spoonful of peas (if
available). Microwave for 30 seconds. Top
with bacon bits (oddly, they're vegan). Add
shredded cheese and sour cream if desired.

Non-denominational Deviled Eggs
Worth the work, if you like this sort of

thing.

Shell three hard-boiled eggs. Halve
them and scoop the yolks into a bowl, keeping the whites intact. Mash the yolks with
a heaping teaspoon of mayonnaise, half a
teaspoon spicy mustard, salt, pepper and
the juice of two lemon wedges. Spoon the
filling back into the whites and sprinkle
with a dash of chili powder (from the wok
area).
Super Microbicide Tea
Put a mint tea bag into a cup (plastic is
better than a mug) and fill halfway with
hot water. Top off with orange or grapefruit
juice. Squeeze in a lemon wedge. Add a teaspoon of honey. Microwave for a minute to

heat thoroughly. Visualize your cold virus

Milquetoast Milk Toast
Morgan Simon 'O4 says, "It almost
sounds too gross to be good." She's wrong.

Thoroughly toast a piece of white bread.
Spread generously with butter or margarine. Microwave a glass of milk (two percent, rice, or soy is best) until very hot,
about 90 seconds. Tear the bread into bitesized pieces and place in a bowl. Pour hot
milk over toast and add a liberal quantity
of cinnamon sugar (from the condiment
bar).

Rice Pudding for the Weary Heart
This one is a little labor-intensive, but,
again, it's totally worth it.
Clean a wok thoroughly. (You don't
want stir-fry remnants in this.) Into the
wok, put a glassful of milk (2%/rice/soy), a
large bowlful of rice and a teaspoon of butter or margarine. Add a dash of cinnamon

and

a handful of raisins. Simmer for a few
minutes, until the rice plumps up and the
liquid thickens. Add sugar or honey to

taste.

Elementary: Joey investigates
the mystery of the sweater
BY JOEY SPADOLA

jspodoll@swarthmore.edu
It is a general misconception among the overwhelming majority of the students here that this
campus is a secure, idyllic, worry-free zone where
the most atrocious of the mishaps that one could
conceive of taking place is the loss of a certain asyet-unclaimed navy-blue turtleneck sweater on the
night of Sept. 23 of which the reserved-students email center has not failed in its imperative duty to
inform us.
"We live

in an arboretum," some say to themselves. "What can I possibly have to fear? Is the magnolia grandiflora going to come and spit flower seeds
at me?" One student, upon being asked by the present author whether he feared for his personal safety
at this school, expressed the following resolute opinion: "We live in a big fucking garden, Spadola! You're
the freak that makes me fear for my personal safety."
Ah! the folly and imprudence of youth! Don't be
fooled! Do not let yourselves be lulled into a false
sense of comfort! This campus is a veritable warzone, despite outward appearances! Out of a sense of
moral duty, I am arousing myself from more than a
year of dormancy as a columnist with the sole pur-

pose of making known to the general public the terrifying events to which, on this very campus, I have
been witness in the last few weeks.

Indeed, since the beginning of classes, there has

been taking place what someone of a more vulgar
turn might denote "crazy shit," and which someone

of a more spirited character might spell "craZy
sHiT." They are not, however, isolated events. No, I
am of the unbending conviction that we are dealing
with a series of linked and organized occurrences.
But let me be more precise. You're impatient for concrete details and material proofs. Let us cut to the
proverbial chase.
The shenanigans all began shortly after I arrived
at the Big Garden several weeks ago. I was at first
given the false impression that things continued to
function at this school more or less as I had left it
many moons prior. For example, I noted on dining at
Sharpies that the sandwich bar continues to put to
use one of the most remarkable concepts ever discovered by human genius: a giant fork that resembles, in both shape and size, a garden hoe for picking
up slices of cheese. Not only is this pure genius from
an objective aesthetic point of view, but it keeps
with the school's Garden theme. I believe that, in the
same spirit, the Sharpies staff should dress up as
giant magnolias and lilies and use tilling rakes to
dish out the chicken croquets and chili (vegan).
"Things," I then said to myself, "must be normal." To confirm this impression I turned to a random fellow student whom I did not know but who

seemed to be fairly representative of the studentry
here, and I proceeded to engage him in the following
conversation:
ME: Do you normally dress like that or did you
just crawl out from under a rock?
STUDENT: Hi! WiU you be my friend?
ME: Um
look over there! There goes Bill Nye
the Science Guy! (I frantically flee the scene.)
"Same old, same old," I then said to myself. Upon
which I sighed deeply and turned my steps toward
the basement of McCabe to resume my former existence in the congenial company of the buzzing lights
of that venerable building.
But suddenly, as I was walking along, I tripped on
an object lying on the ground that had either previously eluded my sight or, alternatively, materialized
instantaneously just I stepped down upon it. (I
incline toward the latter hypothesis.) The mysterious object was, to my great consternation, nothing
other than a misplaced navy blue turtleneck sweater.
I am a morally upright citizen, and as such, I
answered to the call of duty, despite my fright and
shock, and submitted the object in question to the
appropriate authorities, who thereupon took the
appropriate measures to rectify this grave affair.
But to this day, my dear fellow comrades, the
sweater has not been claimed.
...

THE PHOENIX

Now it is not my aim to sow the seeds of panic on
this campus, but I scarcely need to spell out the
implications of this egregious occurrence. Nor is it
the whole of the matter. Oh, no! It's just the tip of the

iceberg!
As I was walking back from McCabe one evening,
minding my own business, I suddenly jammed my
toe into a giant object that instantaneously appeared
before me. This time it was not, however, a turtleneck: it was an overweight middle-aged man intoxicated out of his mind, sipping on Jack Daniels out of
a brown paper bag. What startled me most, though,
is that on further inspection I realized that this man
was in fact one of my professors, whereupon we
exchanged the following words:
ME: Uh, hi Professor X. Sorry about... uh... kicking y0u...0n the ground
but...
PROFESSOR: Buuuurrrrp.
ME: Uh, Professor X, I have to go. (Sound of me
frantically fleeing the scene).
Nor are these all of the random pathological
events which have been taking place. For instance,
after coming upon my professor so fortuitously, I
passed by a student dressed in a Fidel Castro uniform, smoking a Cuban cigar and chanting, "El
pueblo, unido, jamas sera vencido!" and "Bush,
fascista, eres tu el terrorista!" I then saluted him as
...

follows:
ME: Buenas tardes, comandante.
FIDEL CASTRO IMPERSONATEUR: Eat feces,
gringo capitalist vile! Patria o muerte! Venceremos!
"Same old, same old," I then said to myself, when
suddenly I was startled by a burning sensation on
my leg and upon looking down discovered that my
pants had caught fire from a nearby burning bush,
tragic result of three freshmen failing to realize the
risks involved in sniffing gasoline and smoking
weed in one sitting.
I was then approached by a disheveled individual
who oddly had a halo-like glow around his head and
shoulders. The following conversation then tran-

spired:

RELIGIOUS WEIRDO: "Are you at peace with
your soul? Have you found your inner Jesus?
ME: Shit! My pants are on fire! Look over there!
There's a burning bush!
WEIRDO: The Lord is infinitely benevolent in his
ways. Follow his light. Follow the flame.
ME: You're gonna light yourself on fire, you
weirdo! (sound of me frantically fleeing the scene).

"There must be something afoot," I then pondered to myself after dipping my left leg into the
faucet of the Parish first-floor men's restroom. I
scarcely had time enough to carry this thoughtto its
logical implications, when I again tripped on my
way back from Parish, stumbling upon yet another
random object which suddenly materialized in my
path. It was again, on this occasion, Professor X,
wearing the navy-blue turtleneck sweater that I had
found earlier in the day.
"Professor X," I said, "do you need me to call a

taxi?"
"Buuuurrrrrp," he replied.
I again frantically fled the scene. As I was sprinting, I tripped a third and final time, not upon a
sweater, but upon an lost leotard of mine which I had
used for a course entitled "Super-Saharan Traditional
Tree-Stomping In the Charged Political Climate of
Western Somalia," a class which, were it not for the
duteous employees of the Reserved Students E-mail
list, I would never have known about.
A large group of students then began chanting
from a distance: "What do we want? More gas and
reefer! When do we want it? Now!"
A crack addict proceeded to jump out of a tree
and scuffle by; I saw a baby selling weed on Parish
beach at three in the morning; I saw a Hitler impersonator giving a brim-and-fire-stone speech from the
balcony of a Wharton double.
I then became utterly frightened.
If anyone has the key to unlock this mystery,
please, I would be much obliged for any explanation.
Until then, it's best to keep a low profile, and to
avoid wearing any turtleneck garments.

Beating the yeast beast
"Gross, Sarah, could you not mention yeast infections? I could be
eating a yeast product right now or something."
Over dinner last weekend, I discovered that many people are still
grossed out by any mention of the Y word, and, for a moment, this
made me wonder if this would be an "appropriate" topic for my col
umn. After further thought, though, I realized that it's probably no
just yeast that triggered my friend's horror; it's the topic of vaginas
So either suck it up or turn the page. Since over 85 percent of women
and individuals with vaginas will eventually suffer through a yeas
infection or its sister-in-symptoms, bacterial vaginosis, this is impor
tant stuff.
Of this group of sufferers, a large percentage will unfortunately
find themselves heading to the drug store for Monistat more times in
their lives than they'd like. Yet despite the unbelievable frequency o
vaginal infections, many women know very little about their actua
causes, treatment and symptoms,
because, unbelievably, they are still

associated with embarrassment or
dirtiness.

For some women, yeast infections
are a rare and mild annoyance, and an
even luckier few will never get one at
all. Still others suffer a chronic series
of infections that seem to perpetually
resist treatment. The disease Candida
is caused by a fungus, and its vaginal
symptoms include itching, burning,
painful urination and a change in the
appearance of discharge.
Although most women have had
some form of exposure to information

SARAH WALSH
Sex and the Swattie

about yeast infections, partially
because there are so many over-thecounter treatments for it, many aren't
familiar with bacterial vaginosis, even though it is actually more com

mon.

Unlike Candida, BV is caused by an overgrowth of a type ofbacteria
that is always present, but can wreak havoc on your system if jt take
over. Symptoms of BV often appear quite similar to those of yeast infec
tions, including itching, burning, painful penetration, painful urina
tion and a change in vaginal smell. There is no over-the-counter med
ication for BV, and, since it can be difficult for women to tell which
kind they have without a gynecological appointment, many may mis
diagnose and buy Monistat. So, if you find yourself in the category o
the chronically itching, it's possible that you either have BV or a dou
ble infection (they're as lovely as they sound) and you didn't realize it
If you are someone who is frustrated by the cycle of medication ant
recurring infection, I'd recommend trying some of the simple way
you can cut down your risk. First, no thongs. Yes, I know your but
looks cute in them, but they are notorious for spreading bacteria into
the wrong places. Try switching to 100 percent cotton underwear
because it is more breathable than other fabrics, and avoid sitting
around in sweaty clothes (e.g., after a workout).
Think of yeast as a mold, which grows rapidly in warm, damp con
ditions. Although it's hard not to be guilty of this one with today'
styles, try to limit wearing tight pants and always sleep withou
underwear. If you're using lube, read the label to check for hidden
sugar, specifically glycerin, which feeds yeast and is present even in
popular brands like K-Y Jelly. Ironically, there really aren't too many
sugar-free lubes out there, but I know that FemGlide is sold at the CVS

and Eckerd located on the Pike.
Also, check to make sure you and your partner have not been swap
ping Candida, as it is an sexually transmitted disease that both men
and women can contract (though men almost never show symptoms)
To be safe, make an appointment with Linda Echols and mention thi
possibility. She may treat both of you.
One of the most common triggers of Candida is the use of antibi
otics. I remember that, when I was sick and my dad was unable to take
me to the doctor, he would simply give me some penicillin left ove
from the course of treatment for another family member's infection. A
lifetime of this kind of overdosing on antibiotics can increase you
susceptibility to Candida. Antibiotics indiscriminately kill your body'
good and bad bacteria, so always supplement with acidophilus, the
"friendly" bacteria found in yogurt, if you are taking a round. Eating
yogurt is good, but even stronger acidophilus in capsule form can b
found at The Vitamin Shoppe.
Finally, if you're one of the very candida-prone and have tried all o
the above methods, make an appointment with Linda to discus
dietary changes. High-sugar, low-fiber diets encourage the fungus to
flourish (hello, college students), so you may need to bite the bulle
and eliminate Krispy Kremes.
For some people, vaginal infections are merely an occasional incon
venience that a trip to Worth can quickly remedy, but, for others, the
Candida cycle can be painful and even occasionally debilitating. Even
if over-the-counter treatments have worked for you in the past, talking
to Linda about preventative measures may help you to break the cycle

Pterodactyl Hunt 2003

They only come
out at night
BY JOHN TUTHILL
jtuthill@swarthmore.edu
It was the evening of the Pterodactyl Hunt last Friday
and it got dark as usual, much to the delight of Swillies
worldwide. My counterparts and I, collectively known as
team Dirt McGurt, assembled and trudged up the way into
Parrish Parlours to begin our evening of aggressive fantasy and cunning strategery. Folks were packed into the
entranceway and as we pushed our way through we contemplated the task that lay before us.
We decided that the Pterodactyl Hunt was the one night
every year when our intense desire for pretending would
be sated by the most elaborate game most of us have ever
seen. We decided we would live in the world of the
Pterodactyl Hunt if we could. Except for the lack of chawing and bourbon drinking that follows, the hunt is exactly
like a Civil War reenactment. Think how great it would be
if you could go fight at Antietam.
And so we were still pondering it all as the one-eyed
wizard dispensed trash bags to our wide-eyed group, which
we pulled on in apprehension of the impending battle. We
listened to the grotesque man explain the rules of the hunt,
and they were as follows:
"That field down there is full of monsters," he said. But

were they real?

"You will attempt to defeat them by dueling with this
weapon and striking them in their respective target areas
before they strike you." At this point, he gave us each a
shiny yellow sword, and we gasped.
"If you defeat a monster, you will rewarded with gold or
other goods," he said. By other goods, what did he mean?
Silver? Bronze? A fart in a bottle?
"If the monster kills you, it will take your weapon and
you have to go get another to be reborn." With this, some
members of the group shuffled with embarrassment.
"Gold may be used to buy other weapons or the pterodactyl hunting license, which you will need to challenge
the pterodactyl," he concluded.
"A license to kill," somebody chuckled. Nobody else

10

found this funny.
Swelling with pride in our newfound knowledge, we
filed down Magill Walk to the playing field. After a
moment or two, our one-eyed wizard yelled something, and
the combat began.
Team Dirt McGurt went to work immediately, surrounding some sort of monstrous figure that looked suspiciously like an ugly rugby player. It was an Ore, the commonest (and stupidest) of the monsters, wielding a slightly

longer sword than ours, surrounding their leader the Ore
The ominous fellow was flanked by his Orcish

King.

Princes who rallied the Ores with swine-like squeals and
snarls. A McGurt member defeated the Ore with ease and
received three gold pieces for his trouble. We would need
600 gold pieces to buy an adequate number of dactyl hunt-

licenses for our team to face the pterodactyl.
Suddenly, a werewolf jumped at me with his fearsome
claws. Immune to most weapons, the werewolf was a force
of stealth that could only be defeated by purchasing the silver dagger and plunging it into his soft fleece. My punishment for crossing the path of this mythical creature: a fiveminute wait for a new sword.
Dirt McGurt split up, and I wandered over to the
Jabberwock, a suffix-less version of its forefather, which
was waving around his giant claws and head. There were
also the Goblins, fierce rivals of the Ores, brandishing
standard-length swords but with a smaller target area. The
Goblin King held two swords, and his lieutenants wagged
their swords and shields.
An Oracle rested down by the tunnel, accessed by challenging and overwhelming the Black Knight. Any question
may be asked of the Oracle, though an accurate answer is
not guaranteed, and this year the Oracle served little purpose except in answering trivial questions regarding the
names and purposes of the monsters.
The Sphinx was a less vestigial character, prowling
about and offering the opportunity to answer a riddle for
substantial sums of gold, but those who were stumped died
the death of the ignorant. Team Dirt McGurt was tempted
by the Sphinx, but, as none of us spoke English as our first

language, we opted not to take the gamble.
Soon we had reached our goal of a shipload of money,
and, after purchasing our pterodactyl hunting licenses, we
approached the super-soaker—waving dactyl and his ferocious guards. The goal was to bust the wings of the beast
while avoiding the spray of its gun and the wrath of its
guards. The ensuing battle was great and long, and we
ended victors with only the scars to corroborate our tale of
heroism. We wandered away from the fray, our heads held
high.

Next year, the Pterodactyl Hunt will include a
series of quests with alternate prizes for achievements other than 'dactyl-slaying. For example,
groups that are able to kill every monster or collect
the most gold will be handsomely rewarded as well
as those who win pizzas by slaying a pterodactyl.
Shields and longswords will be more accessible by
collecting rewards for various monsters.
This spring, there will be a second Grand Melee.
A team-on-team tournament will be followed by a
one-on-one elimination tournament and possibly an
archery competition. An intramural advanced
Capture the Flag league will host the battle between
thieves and wizards in a weekly battle for the flag.
As always, opportunities abound for those fascinated by non-reality. We have SWIL to thank for this
state of affairs.

When Garza finally allowed a student to play a

Axelrod Quartet plays beautiful Beethoven, yet fails to inspire
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
I arrived unfashionably late just as the
music was beginning for a performance of
the Axelrod String Quartet Oct. 3. It was
the first performance in a planned fiveprogram series here at Swarthmore of all
16 Beethoven string quartets. The setting,
Lang Concert Hall, was spacious yet intimate, lit brightly with spotlights. The quartet is the resident ensemble at the
Smithsonian Institution. If one wore black
and chatted over wine and cheese with a
date beforehand, one could easily turn this
simple concert into a sophisticated event.
However, this was far more informal, and
the few students who attended arrived in

their everyday attire.
Although I did not expect the concert to
be packed, I was disconcerted by the lack of
student attendance. More than half the
audience appeared to be adults from the
area. I merely chalked it up to the unusual
number of events going on during that particular night.
The quartet began to play Beethoven's
"Quartet in F major, Op. 18, No. X" composed in 1801, and, as for me, I was enjoying
it. By the group's second piece,
Beethoven's "Quartetto Serioso in F Minor,

Op. 95," composed in 1810, I was happily
lost in some silly daydream. Despite years
of piano lessons, I still remain tone-deaf
and unable to logically follow classical
music. Since I am unable to give informed
technical critiques, I asked fellow concert-

THE PHOENIX

goers their thoughts during intermission.
The quartet, consisting of Marc
Destrube (first violin), Anca Nicolau (second violin, standing in for Marilyn
McDonald), Steven Dann (viola) and
Kenneth Slowik (cello), did not elicit the
most positive responses.
"I've seen them live so many times.

They were out of tune. They were not
together," a first-year student who wished
to remain anonymous said.

This reaction surprised and even
embarrassed me. Apparently those students with a more respectable knowledge
of classical music hadn't enjoyed the performance at all. In fact, a sizeable number
of them left during intermission and didn't

return.
"I think they have nice tone and an OK
blend," Micaela Baranello 'O7 said. "If you
personally can enjoy it, it doesn't matter
what other people think." She attributed
the group's tone to their instruments,
which were crafted in Europe between 1696
to 1784.
"It was terrible," interjected Andy
Skemer 'O6. "The first violinist plays out of
tune, sounds like he didn't practice his
runs. The second violinist isn't actually in
this group, and it sounds like they didn't
practice with her." When asked if he would
attend the subsequent performances,
Skemer answered, "I'll attend the other
ones anyway. The Beethoven String
Quartets are the greatest pieces ever written."
As the group began its final piece,

The Axelrod Quartet will be returning to Swarthmore in January.
"Quartet in A Minor, Op. 132," composed in
1825, I listened more intently and took
these comments to heart. My listening did
not become more critical. To the contrary,
I enjoyed the last piece more than the previous two (due to the music more than the
performance). The third movement, listed
as "Heilige Dankgesang eines Genesenden
an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart.
Molto adagio
Neue kraft fiihlend.
Andante," was especially riveting and
beautiful.
The performances are sponsored by the
William J. Cooper Foundation, and the four
remaining concerts will be held at Lang
Concert Hall on Jan. 25, Feb. 20, and March

26. Those with classical music experience
may be disappointed with the Axelrod
Quartet's next performances. But those
who, like me, are not well-versed in the
classical language of the great composers,
might easily find relaxation and enjoyment
in two hours of live music. Overall, connoisseurs and dilettantes both agreed on
one thing. The Beethoven String Quartets
are each exquisite pieces that should not be
missed. If you are not particularly fastidious about the technical quality of your performers but are ready for a night at the theatre and want to hear great music, consider attending one of the Axelrod's performances.

Innovation and respect A melting
Assisted by machinery, jazz lives on into 2003
pot of pop
BY ROSS HOFFMAN

khoffmal@swarthmore.edu

Folks have been proclaiming that jazz is dead
since well before I can remember, and that's as
ridiculous a pronouncement as anything, but it's
hard to deny that jazz just doesn't have as much relevance as it used to.
In any musical genre, and possibly any art form,
relevance generally stems from progress and innovation, often the result of incorporating elements
from outside the immediate tradition. Jazz which
was a mongrel form to begin with
has always
drawn on the influence of exterior factors, musical
and social, for its development.
But over the last few decades, the genre has seen
a fair amount of retrenching and self-imposed isolation, which makes it both easier to identify and harder to relate to. Even most fringe "experimental" practitioners operate in a relative
ly well-defined and self-contained arenas.
The way forward, it seems, must come
through a wholesale loosening of these
boundaries, an openness to recombinatior

one that should appeal to any jazz fan with reasonably open ears.
Steeped in the rich textures of Charles Mingus
and some of Ellington's more evocative experimental
music, many of the arrangements feature bass clarinet, flute and low, clustered, tenor sax harmonies
and the group boasts several accomplished soloists.
Most of the tracks also feature prominent electronic elements often as the basis of a complexly
-

grooving rhythmic underpinning, but also fulfilling

melodic and atmospheric roles.
An exploration of the possibilities of combining
jazz and electronica, "Observing Systems" is wideranging enough to fully examine both genres, but
also cohesive enough to feel tremendously organic

and unified.

The debut album from Matthew Herbert's Big
Band project, "Goodbye Swingtime," is probably an
even more adventurous release. With it,
Herbert, a prolific and eclectic producer,
best know for several albums of subtly
intellectualized, minimalist house, offers
perhaps his most ambitious statement to
date, as well as a uniquely beautiful col-

with other musical styles and ideas. The
issue is how to combine jazz with othei

forms while preserving its jazzness. Can
there be a truly genre-fusing record
which could be accepted as generic by relative-purists of both jazz and the other

lection of music.
The essential foundation of the album

is a collection of big-band charts (dense

It's often difficult to tell which is which, because

unconvincing. It's easy enough to sample jazz
records and make hip-hop with them, or to have a
rapper or a dj play with a jazz group, but there's a
possibly unbridgeable gap between the openness of
jazz and the fundamentally pop-based, repetitive,
verse-chorus structure of a hot rap track.
A potentially more promising approach, as suggested by several forward-looking recent
releases, is the fusion of jazz with electronic music. Unlike hip-hop, electronica has
no prescribed formal constraints. It is
by its
defined solely
and uniquely
constituent sounds, or more specifically
the processes that are used to generate,
manipulate, and coordinate these sounds.
Though there might seem to be an

irreconcilable difference between
these processes (which generally
involve programming and don't occur

the electronic involvement is quite subtle, but
Herbert's curious sonic fingerprint is distinctly rec-

ognizable throughout.
Additional interest comes from the vocals that
embellish the bulk of these tracks
which range
from

Communist rallying chants, reminiscent

of Blitzstein or Weill.
Oh, I forgot to mention one thing.
"Goodbye Swingtime" is also a political
concept album, incorporating, for
instance, the sounds of printing

the "live" aesthetic that are so crucial
to jazz but anything is possible in an
age populated by such oxymorons as the laptop
improviser.
It figures that a real stab at jazz-electronica fusion
(the "jazzy" down-tempo and lounge of Jazzanova
and the "Verve//Remixed" compilations really don't
count) would have to come from Europe, where jazz
has apparently always been held in higher reverence
than in its homeland. Which brings me to a pair of
recent releases from two of the most respected and
innovative German labels (Morr Music and
Accidental Records), both of which feature prominent electronic musicians making essentially largecombo jazz music.
"Observing Systems" is the third album by Tied &
Tickled Trio, a misleadingly-named collective as
there are as many as 12 members involved here,
including members of electro-organic dream-pop
favorites the Notwist. The pedigrees of its creators
notwithstanding, it is undeniably a jazz album, and

floor.

As intriguing as that may sound, I'll reassure you
that it's impossible, and completely irrelevant, to figure out what any of this has to do with the music on
the album. You can read all about it at www.magicandaccident.com, where you'll also find the
Personal Compact for the Composition of Music
(PCCOM), Herbert's Dogme9s-esque production
code.
The highly academic overtones (not to mention
the obscurity) of these fine albums make them
unlikely candidates for bringing jazz and jazz-like
music to a larger audience, or even for catalyzing a
more wide-spread investigation of the relationship
between jazz and electronica.

What they do accomplish is perhaps more important: they demonstrate concretely the possibility for
two types of music to intersect fluidly and discriminatingly in a way that's both respectful of and innovative in both traditions.

BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON

bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu
What is pop music? Is it just shorthand for everything popular or is it entirely different?
It's true that pop has a reputation for being fad-driven, sappy

and shallow. There seems to be an inherent stigma attached to
the word "pop." As a result, many people don't take it seriously,
and pop music has dwindled in, for lack
of a better word, popularity. Anyone can
take a look at the Billboard Hot 100 chart
and notice that the Top 10 songs in the
country are all R&B or rap.
The infiltration of hip-hop into the
popular music scene is much attributed
to this new melting pot that has been
brewing for years. So the question
remains
as genre lines are crossed
ever more often, is it possible for pop to
Britney Spears
make a comeback?
In 2002, a solo Justin Timberlake In the Zone
and a revamped Christina Aguilera (Jive Records, 2003'

released the albums "Justified" and
though respected with
"Stripped," respectively. Those albums
multi-platinum sales
weren't the essence of true pop music.
Timberlake drew his musical production from the ever-present
Neptunes and Timbaland while Aguilera mimicked Pink going
the Linda Perry route.
There is still a market for pop as seen with Hilary Duffs
debut album "Metamorphosis," which pulled in surprisingly
high numbers last month. Surely her Lizzie McGuire appeal
boosted her album sales in the 'tween demographic. However,
that is still not enough to fully put pop music back on the map.
The true test ofits staying power will be the new album from the
"Pop Princess"

herself, Britney Spears.

As genre lines are crossed ever more
often, is it possible for pop to make a
comeback?
Spears' upcoming album, "In the Zone", will be released on
Nov. 18. The promotion for her fourth album is already in full
swing with magazine covers galore in the U.S. and overseas, as
well as a musical guest stint with host Halle Berry on Saturday
Night Live for Oct. 18. And, of course, who could forget her hardly inconspicuous kiss with Madonna on stage during the 2003
MTV Video Music Awards? The two have decided to capitalize
on the attention from this stunt and have now released a duet
together, entitled "Me Against the Music," the first single off of
Spears' new album.
"Me Against the Music" is the basic dance track that Britney
is known for. While the lyrics leave much to be desired ("All my
people on the floor/let me see you dance") the listener is sucked
into the infectious beat produced by Red Zone and can't help but
bob their head, tap their fingers or flat-out dance.
Madonna's section of the track doesn't add much and actually sounds out of place, not flowing with the overall style of the
song. She half sings, half talks to Britney ("If you think you so
hot/betta show me what you got") seemingly teaching her how to
become a pop icon like herself.
After hearing the single, Hernease Davis 'O4 said she wasn't

impressed.

"This song is stereotypical pop trying to be R&B and hiphop," she said. One could venture to say that "stereotypical pop"
is precisely what Britney was going for
a song about nothing,
a song that can make you happy and dance, which is what she
does best.

The melting pot is further seen as Britney teams up with R.
Kelly for another track on her album. While some may criticize
the so-called "Ghetto Pass" taking place, this just reinforces that
the world of pop will always be multifaceted, leaving its mark in
cycles. What surprises are in store this time?

What do you know about the punk rock scene in Seoul? Punk rock first emerged
in South Korea in the mid-1990s and has developed into an active youth subculture.
Korean punk rock is much like the British and American varieties, though it sprung
up in very different circumstances. Bands with names like CryingNut, Noßrain, and
Supermarket play songs about intergenerational conflict, existential angst, and general societal discontent.
So how does such a socially rebellious genre fit into a culture known for its
restraint? Professor Stephen Epstein will discuss this question and others in a talk
tonight entitled "The Emergence of Punk Rock in South Korea," at 4:15 in the Scheuer
Room in Kohlberg hall. Epstein is a professor of classics and Asian studies and director of the Asian Studies Institute at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.
More importantly, he used to host a show on WSRN as "DJ Stephen X, Swarthmore's
professor in the department of punk and alternative studies," which showcased punk

Irony conquers all
Most of us, liberal or conservative, can't exactly call
ourselves happy over the results of the California recall
election. No matter what one's opinion of Gray Davis is,
there's something wrong when his replacement, overwhelmingly voted in, is a movie star with no political
experience and no clear plan. His politics are murky and
influenced by campaign contributors from all over the
map, and the closest he ever came to real political experience was managing a physical education initiative for
Reagan, making speeches about improving gym classes.
The most common response to the recall in exit polls
was a sheer sense of both distrust and disgust toward
Gray Davis and the current state of affairs in
Sacramento, a willingness to completely scrap the old
system for anything else, no matter how new and untested. From his remarkably shallow understanding of politics or economics, to his hamhanded, movie-title-dropping speechmaking, to, most disturbingly, the specter of
misogyny and past episodes of sexual assault that haunted him, we still find it hard to understand how he won
this election. Californians, apparently, were cynical and
disillusioned enough with the system to just vote for the
best-known new candidate.
Yet as strange-looking an item in the history books as
it is, Schwarzenegger's win isn't as shocking as the
whole fiasco that preceded it. The sheer disrespect for

the election as a political institution was only matched
by the sheer lack of shame among the self-promoting,

self-involved, self-loving mob. The media's response was
to chuckle at the silliness of it all; the sense of shock and
outrage was missing. We expect this sort of thing nowadays. We even laugh at it, enjoy it, commemorate it in
hall themes in dorms because that's aU we can really
do.
If someone had told us in high school that by our college graduation we'd see Jesse Ventura and Arnold
Schwarzenegger add "governor" to their resumes,
we'd've thought they were pitching a really bad movie
script. Almost as bad as the one about terrorists crashing
planes into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
We live in surreal times. The so-called Age of Irony is
just a fancy name for the numbness we feel when we look
at a world we can't control. We see it in the Daily Jolt, in
the parody signs advertising "Hop for War" in response
to "Stand for Peace," in the apathetic sighs of Swatties at
...

the dinner table whenever the news comes in. Whatever
sense of idealism we had is fading, and both right- and
left-wing student groups are feeling its lack.
In the end, though, when real people get hurt, the
jokes are no longer funny. It would be better if, futile as
protest culture and petitions may seem, more of us maintained that youthful resolve to be actors on the world
stage, rather than giving in to the urge to become jesters.

Lott study fraudulent, damaging
Dear Editor:

This is in response to the article entitled "Lott argues

Letters policy

the

for relaxed gun laws," (Oct. 2, pg. 7).
John Lott is a disreputable researcher and a fraud. It is
disgusting he was invited to campus, and even more foul
that he duped some students into believing his documented errors.
John Lott's argument is not solid in a statistical or economic sense. Lott seems to be engaged in a coverup of mas-

sive irregularities in his data, that, when corrected, invalidates his results. There is no dispute that the data set he
used in his "More Guns, Less Crime" book contained coding errors, as unearthed by lan Ayres and John Donohue
in their paper "Shooting Down the More Guns, Less Crime
Hypothesis". When those errors were pointed out, Lott
denied they had any effect on his conclusions. To support
this, he reran his regressions using corrected data.
However, when he reran his regressions, he changed
his model by removing a correction for a clustering effect.
Without this change, the regressions would not have been
statistically significant. It seems he attempted to cover
this up by attempting to backdate a second correction to
his results, but failed, creating a file that was dated Jan.
18, 2004 (1/18/04), instead of the expected April 18, 2003
(4/18/03). Metadata inside the file dates it at Sept. 2, 2003.
Additionally, it is possible that John Lott fabricated a
survey that he alleges to have conducted on gun brandishing in 1997. No data from the survey survived to this point,

October 9. 2003

and Lott has produced no receipts, no pay stubs
in
short, no positive evidence that such a survey ever existed.
Finally, and perhaps most embarrassingly, throughout
the past years, Lott operated under a pseudonym ("Mary
Rosh") to defend himself from criticism on various
Internet message boards. Under this pseudonym he flatout lied about positions John Lott had held in the past in
order to inflate his resume, stating that he was a "chaired
professor" at "Wharton Business School" when he was
never such a thing.
All of this bad content and more can be found at Tim
Lambert's excellent Web page located at http://timlambert.org. I would hope that the professors of the mathematics and statistics department would look at this Web
site and John Lott's various data sets and models, both
before and after Lott changed them to maintain the results
he wanted.
While I believe in the Second Amendment right of individuals to bear arms, and, as such, would very much like
Lott to be correct, I do not believe in allowing liars to promote their lies unchallenged, even if they are on "my
side."
Perhaps a public debunking of Lott's dishonesty by the
mathematics and statistics department will make up for
some of the damage they caused by allowing such a hack
on campus in the first place.

Resist corporate culture control

An article in a recent edition of Wired caught my
eye: "The Incredible Shrinking Studio."
What was once possible only in a professional
recording studio is now being done with a mic and a
Powerbook. This, blogging, online comics and eßay are
all part of the same trend: technology empowering individuals, people like you and me, to actively create our
own culture rather than passively consume whatever
we're fed.
A few people, however, aren't thrilled at the
prospect, e.g., the RIAA, Microsoft and the movie
industry. Unfortunately for us, these entities use their
market dominance and political clout to monopolize

or judicial review. Diebold Corporation has been taking
advantage of this to suppress information about egregious flaws in its widely used electronic voting
machines. Just last week, Swarthmore's own Why
War? was forced to remove documents from its Web
site. This is only the most recent example from a fiveyear history of DMCA censorship.
Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that

After all, what exactly are record companies good
for anymore? In all their success in painting file sharers as immoral fiends who are stealing from the artists,
they've apparently forgotten that stealing is how they
make their living. Most RIAA musicians sign away the
rights to their music, their style, even their own name,
yet they never see a dime from their labels. The cost of
a CD goes almost entirely to marketing (i.e., getting us
to buy it) and to the maintenance of an outdated business model. In a world where recording is cheap and
distribution is free, why should we support a bloated,
inefficient industry that inflicts Top 40 "hits" on all of

PDFs? Even if consumers were informed about it, they
wouldn't have a choice. Microsoft's monopoly, not the
market, dictates what people can buy.
While groups like Microsoft and the RIAA claim
that their power grab is necessary to stop evil, they
ignore an evil that most of us don't think about.
Although a powerful few benefit when culture is centrally controlled, we all benefit when ideas flow freely

To do so, however, the

must first consider every possible circumstance surrounding this vandalism and not

simply unleash a knee-jerk
cry of homophobia.
«■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
Swarthmore has made a conscious decision to embrace
"diversity," a vague term by any standard. That standard has
evolved over time from a simple racial blend to include reli
gions, sexual orientations and, more recently, political ideolo
gies. We may value diversity for the sake of inclusion, for its
peer effects or for any number of other reasons. Regardless o
our reasons, however, it is our obligation to defend that which
we hold so close to the social fabric of Swarthmore. An attack
on any element of campus diversity should be taken as a per
sonal attack on the entire campus.

While the college is right to launch an inquiry into the SQU
vandalism, it is curious that we have not witnessed similar
enthusiasm in response to the vandalism of signs promoting
the College Republican and Swat Survivors. Do conservatives
and survivors of sexual abuse not have the same right to rep
resentation on campus as the queer community? If we are to
maintain the notion that there is intrinsic communal value in
diversity, these problems should have been addressed long
before SQU was ever targeted.
It is also possible that the SQU vandalism was only partial
ly or not at all an act of homophobia. Any Swattie knows that
late on a Saturday evening, drunken masses of students, some
more disorderly than others, may be found about campus. I
may be the case that one or more inebriated Paces partygoers
ripped off a piece of the IC board in what was simply a random
act of destruction. This is not necessarily the case, but, absen
other evidence, it is entirely as plausible as assuming an anti
SQU hate crime.
Perhaps this incident should serve not as an impetus for
encouraging respect for diversity but rather as a catalyst to
recognition of the problem of general destruction and vanda]
ism on campus. It is not uncommon after a typical weekend to
find broken windows, overturned garbage cans and deface(
bulletin boards throughout Swarthmore's buildings. Willets
Wharton basement, Olde Club and the Tarble game room were
all subject to severe and costly damage, presumably by stu
dents, last year.
If the college were serious about preventing a similar tren(
in the future, it would be prudent to implement a system o
personal responsibility and consequences that are more tanta
mount to what one would expect in civil society. For instance
last November, a member of the class of 2003 was charged with
DUI after driving from Wharton to C-Lot with twice the lega
blood alcohol level. He destroyed his own car and inflictec
varying degrees of damage to five other parked vehicles. His
punishment from the college was simply probation. He drove
drunk through campus, endangered the lives of students and
anyone who could have been driving on Field House Lane
caused thousands of dollars worth of damage to private prop
erty and yet essentially finished his final year at Swarthmore
and graduated with no lasting consequences within the com
munity. Given this tepid reprimand for such an egregious
offense, how can the college expect its students to fully realize
that destruction, no matter what influences are involved, is
simply unacceptable?
Ultimately, the full solution lies with both the administra
tion and the student body. A demonstration of real, lasting con
sequences for unacceptable vandalism would likely deter
other would-be vandals. Students, however, must also express
their condemnation of such behavior. For diversity-loving
Swatties to condone the acti" by anyone, of defacing an organi
zation's property would be despicably hypocritical. If we
desire communal respect, be it of diversity, personal property
or college spaces, it is imperative that we each take the respon
sibility to ensure that respect personaUy.

As a 20-year veteran of the

Garden State, I was not fooled
when I spent time in New York and San Francisco this summer. I knew instantly that they were suffering from a case of
Jersey jealousy. As I walked down West Fourth Street in New
York or through the mission in San Francisco, the New
Jersey culture was palpable. In what most profs here would
decidedly term a postmodernist commodification of nostalgia,
I saw what I have grown up with in New Jersey as a style to
be bought and sold outside of its borders: trucker hats, mullets, Bruce Springsteen-inspired rocker looks, hipsters playing darts in trashy bars and the same wallaby shoes that my
father has been wearing to his construction job for 25 years.
It was clear that the elements of my central Jersey culture
had gotten around, and it wasn't because the Jersey folks had
brought it to them (we usually prefer not to travel outside of
the tri-state area), but because they had taken it from us.
When New Yorkers start thinking Trenton and Hoboken are

Market breeds innovation SWIL sanity
I just wanted to provide another
viewpoint to some of the ideas
expressed in a Phoenix story about
the Swarthmore Coalition for the
Digital Commons ("New group to
fight RIAA, Microsoft," Oct. 2, 2003).
A reasoned discourse on where the
line should be drawn between what
is freely available to the world and
what should remain private intellectual property is a useful discussion to have. The history of the
Internet is an interesting example
where a public network, created for
defense and academic researchers
to communicate with each other,
became an inspiration that helped
build an industry that is now
responsible for an ever-increasing
amount of innovation.
But it is important to remember
that the idea of intellectual property
has proven to be an incredible
engine for economic growth in the
technology sector, solving important problems in computer science
and bringing the power of computing and übiquitous connectivity to
hundreds of millions of people
across the globe.
There is a powerful argument
that innovation and the arrival in
the marketplace of key technologies
that we all take for granted today
(the telephone, the PC, the automobile) would have slowed to a crawl if
businesses had had no incentive to
do the R&D, develop the new products, take on the enormous risks

you can be sure to win the temporary love of our nation's
finest youth (many of whom are sitting beside you in
Sharpies).
Growing up in a suburb of Trenton, Robbinsville/
Hamilton, my nostalgia is rich with the elements critical in a
Central Jersey lifestyle: roadside dart bars filled with truck
drivers named Roy and Earl (my father's name is Fred), the
familiar sound of a family member pronouncing water as
"wooder," the sights and smells of Long Beach Island and
Seaside Heights in the summer, my cousin's Honda Civic
with spoilers, pizza joints where nobody says "pizza" but simply orders a large pie. Even many of the basement bands that
you love came from New Jersey: Saves the Day, RANA, Mary
Chapin Carpenter and members of Phish went to my high
school, and Ween lives down the road in Lambertville. These
are the things you have borrowed from us, and now we simply ask that you pay your respects with a visit.

Having read "Weird and

by John Tuthill, I admit to being
baffled. As a recent graduate, I feel
that I still have some idea of the climate on campus, so it surprises me
that Tuthill finds SWIL "mysterious."
Not a fan of sci-fi myself, I never
participated in the selection or
showing of SWIL movies, nor do I
pay much attention to movies in
general, but even I've heard of most
of the movies on the current SWIL
movie list. I'd be willing to bet most
of The Phoenix's readership has,
too. "Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory" is obscure?
How
about
John
"Being

but then, isn't that what the
Admissions Committee was going
for, judging by the student body?
Swarthmore is known and loved

for, well, a wide variety of things. I
don't think my SWIL friends are
any weirder or more likely to crawl
out from mysterious places around
campus than are their beer-swilling, Wharton-dwelling brethren.
It's not in the nature of Swatties to
be "normal" by the rest of the
world's standards anyway, so it's
great entertainment to hear one
Swattie label another "weird."
Just wait until you graduate
and get a fresh view on just how
weird the average person on the
street really is. SWIL will look like
a bastion of sanity, I promise you!

Negrey tallied her first career hat trick on Oct. 4 in a 6-1 win over
Washington College. While Washington scored first, the Garnet
answered back with six of their own goals. Negrey opened the scoring
with a penalty kick.
"I wouldn't have thought to take the penalty kick myself," she said.
"We had been practicing penalty kicks in the day before. I had done
well so my teammates told me to take it."
Negrey's second goal came in the second half when she trapped the
ball, turn and converted. Rounding out her hat trick, she then punched
the ball into an open goal after a cross by Nicole Oberfoell 'O7 and a

deflection from Monica Larimer 'O5.
With the three goals from Saturday, Negrey now leads the team in

Bangs scoredthe first two goals of his collegiate career in a 2-0 week
for the Garnet. His tally in the 88th minute gave Swarthmore a 1-0 win
against Washington College. Bangs gathered the ball 30 yards from
Washington's net. After beating a defenseman, Bangs found the goal
with a bending upper corner shot. The win against Washington ended
a 17-game conference losing streak, starting back in the 2001 season.
Bangs also added an insurance goal in the 3-1 win over F&M on
Saturday. He collected the ball off of a punt by Garnet goaltender
Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 and went one-on-one with a Diplomat
defender. "I ended up with a mismatch and he slipped. I lost him and
saw an opening near-post" Bangs said.
The Garnet travel on Muhlenberg this Saturday. Bangs looks forward to the challenge. "This is the first time in a while that we've been
in a position to potentially compete for the conference," he said.
"Finishing well in this game would be huge for us."

Despite the muddy, rainy conditions at Dickinson
on Saturday, the Swarthmore cross country teams
had yet another great race. The men's team captured
second place out of 29 teams, finishing behind
Division II Shippensburg University. The women's
team had a tremendous meet too, finishing fourth.
Unlikeother meets, the Dickinson Invite included
both a short race (4k) and a long race (8k). All members of both teams ran the 4k race on Saturday,
which was significantly shorter than the 6k and 8k
courses the runners were accustomed to competing
on. "It is a little strange to run the 4k when you are
used to racing with a6k mindset ... the race is over
so much sooner and your timing gets a little thrown
off," Debbie Farrelly 'O6 said.
Another interesting aspect of the Dickinson race
was the scoring. Unlike the usual seven deep scoring,
this race was scored only three deep, so that only the
top three finishers from each team made up the
team's entire score. For the men's team, the top three
runners placed third, sixth and 14th, which added up
to a total score of 23. In cross country, the team with
the lowest combined score wins.
The scoring used at Dickinson, according to some
of the runners, seemed to benefit the men's cross
country team. "We knew we had a shot at doing well,
since our top three runners are pretty good," Lang

Reynolds 'O5 said.

And Reynolds's words rang true after the race.

lot of fun."

Although the weather did present some problems,
the women's team also had a great fourth place finish. The top three runners from the Swarthmore

team were Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 in ninth place,
Farrelly in 13th place, and Njideka Akunyili 'O4 in
21st place.
Overall, the Swarthmore men and women said
that the Dickinson race was a great way to get to
know the course for the Regional meet coming up
there in November.
The men will be competing next at the Allentown
Invite on Oct. 18. On that date, the women's team will
host the Seven Sisters Invite at Swarfhmore. The
women are excited and hope to see some fans along
the course, cheering them on.

Beane ball fails
The most exciting
and most ironic
moment of the baseball
playoffs' first week occurred late last Wednesday night just before 3
o'clock, because that is when irony is at its sharpest. Against the
Boston Red Sox, in the bottom of the 12th inning, Ramon Hernandez,
the Oakland Athletics' chubby catcher, bunted with the bases loaded
and two outs; no one had expected this, and the runner on third, Eric
Chavez, scored easily to win the game. Disbelief covered the field,
stands and Mertz's lounge, but the one man who should've been celebrating the most was probably displeased instead: Oakland
Athletics' general manager, Billy Beane.
Beane likely had such an unorthodox response because of his
intensely unorthodox approach to the game, which is a sharp retort
to the "Boys of Summer" who play it and is intricately explained in
the book "Moneyball," by Michael Lewis. Of the book's many
insights, its greatest is that Beane thinks in-game strategy is worthless because baseball is a game dictated by statistical probability that
no dugout manager can change.
Beane's response is to build his
team by studying data and formulas
with his assistants (who, notably,
are former economics majors from
premier universities with a passion
for baseball, not former baseball
players), while ignoring old-school

lore.

As a result, the Athletics' administrators replace the game's hallmark measurements with more esoteric ones. Batting average yields to
AARON WASSERMAN on-base percentage, which values
the anti-climactic walk because it
better represents a player's ability
Underdogs
to maximize run production. In
addition, Beane loathes all strategies that may sacrifice an out to
advance a runner
the hit-and-run, the attempted steal and yes, the
because, although it moves a runner closer to
now-famous bunt
home plate, it actually reduces the probability he will achieve baseball's paramount goal, scoring runs. That's probably why Beane was
seething when he saw Hernandez square for a bunt and indifferent
when it proved successful. Like any rationalist, Beane also thinks
in-game emotions are useless, particularly when they spring from
moments that succeed because of unexpected luck.
Yet every revolution has its flaw, and the one that plagues Beane
is a statistically insignificant sample size, which manifests itself in
baseball as the playoffs. His directing method is suited for the regular season's 162 games when the length causes every statistic to
revert to its mean, and the Athletics' success the past four years
validates the approach.
they've reached the playoffs each time
Unfortunately, the mad dash of a five-game series ruins the plan, as
his team has lost in the playoffs' first round four years running.
Beane dismisses his team's post-season ineptitude by arguing
that, because the small sample size of the playoffs mars its statistical significance, it should be considered secondary to the regular
season. This is certainly the most profound implication of his philosophy. Should players, managers, fans and anyone else associated
with sports attribute playoff failure to pure luck that has no bearing
on the players' skill?
Beane's modern approach to baseball is scientifically sound, but
it does not give him license to become the game's Grinch. Children's
gloves fall limp and adults' passions deflate when he utters such an
assertion, but they have no need to stay this way. Luck is preventing Beane's team from advancing deeper into the playoffs
although, with a 0-9 record in potential series-clinching games, this

The

1

r

ineptitude is bound to revert to a more successful mean

but it is

also the playoffs' most essential characteristic. Luck has created the
boundless, unpredictable excitement that has turned the playoffs
into THE PLAYOFFS for a century now. It explains the inexplicable:
why Red Sox shortstop Johnny Pesky did not complete a relaythrow, letting the St. Louis Cardinals' Enos Slaughter win the 1946
World Series; how an 11-year-old stole the 1996 ALCS from the
Baltimore Orioles by reaching onto the field to turn an out into a
homerun; and how Red Sox pitcher Calvin Schiraldi threw one of
the worst wild pitches ever in Game Six of the 1986 World Series, letting the New York Mets score the tying run, paving the way for
Mookie Wilson's infamous grounder.
Emphasizing statistics may remove excitement from the regular
season, but the playoffs are impenetrable to such an invasion.
Strange, inexplicable things happen routinely during the postseason, and it is the reason nicknames are coined, champagne is poured
over bodies instead of into mouths and people watch religiously.
Beane is an innovator, but the playoffs' inherent luck should be
cherished, not derided.

Justin Durand and Brian Park competed at the ITA Atlantic South Regional Tennis tournament last Sunday.

Men's tennis hosts ITA
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

The Tide had another impressive showing this
weekend at the ITA Atlantic South Regional Tennis
Championships, with Division 111 players competing
throughout the mid-Atlantic region. The tournament, hosted at Swarthmore, was forced inside on
Saturday due to inclement weather. Saturday's
matches were played at Springton Tennis Club,
whose indoor courts are notorious for their speed.
Swat sent in eight players to compete in the singles ladder with Zac Rodd 'O6 and Jonathan Reiss 'O7,
making it to the round of 16. Frank Visciano 'O4 and
Mike Noreika also 'O4 got to the quarter finals of the

doubles side of the tournament.
Justin Durand 'O5 won his preliminary match 6-0,
6-0 against Zack Cook of Lebanon Valley. He came
back to win his first round match 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 against
Waynesburg's Matt Ottis. Washington and Lee's John
Malooley didn't prove as easy to defeat, and Durand
fell in the thirdround 3-6,1-6. While Durand declined
to comment on his own play, he said that the Garnet
had "played pretty well overall as a team."
Rodd played phenomenally this weekend. He took

on Jordan Koslosky of Carnegie Mellon in first
round play and easily defeated him 6-1, 6-1. He continued his round of domination when he defeated

in a row in tiebreakers, coming within points of losing. In first-round play, Reiss matched up against
Nate Hathaway of Mary Washington to win 6-4,3-6,76. Hathaway's technique of "serving and volleying"
proved hard to match up against, and, according to
Reiss, "he almost beat me." Right after that narrow
victory, Reiss played Hassan Shah of Wilkes in the
second round of play, winning within a hairpin
again, 5-7,6-2, 7-6. The second match started out sluggish for Reiss, but, once he got back in it, he was able
to take command. He started the third set down 2-4,
but then, thanks to his opponent "tensing up, [he]
was able to pull it out" in the third set tie breaker. "I
played as well as I could've played even though I won
two of the matches by the skin of my teeth," Reiss
said.
Visciano pulled out of the singles competition due
to an injury but continued to play doubles with
Noreika. In the first round of play, the duo took on
the number two team from Salisbury State to win 86. In second-round match play, they played the sixthseeded doubles team of the tournament from
Washington and Lee and won in a tie breaker 9-7. In
the quarterfinals, they played the third seed from
Washington College and lost 6-8 in some intense play.
Visciano said he thought the doubles matches
had gone "really well" and that, in this tough draw,

"it was hard enough getting through the first

Salisbury State's David Finlayson 6-2, 6-0. The true

round."

test for Rodd came when he made it to the round of
16 and was up against David Shay of Washington
Lee. Rodd had come back 6-2 in the second set after a
first set loss of 4-6, only to lose the third set in
tiebreaker 7-6. Shay continued to win second after
losing in the finals. Rodd said he was "pretty happy
with the overall level of play" and that it was a "long
battle, complete with a lot of effort."
Reiss also played hard and toughed out last weekend's tournament. Amazingly, he won two matches

Noreika also played singles but lost in the first
round of play to Carl Lederman of Haverford 4-6, 4-6.
He summed up the tournament as "a strong showing
from our team," singling out Reiss's performance in
particular. "Jon came up with some big wins," he
said.
The Garnet is off the court until the spring season, getting some much-needed rest. They should
return to the courts with the same fury with which
the team started the year.

Emmitt, retire now
Last weekend, I saw a sight more pathetic than any I have
seen in a lengthy span of time. Not pathetic in a "sports" sense,
but pathetic in a "human" sense. That sight was Emmitt Smith
crying at the press conference following his Arizona Cardinals
loss to his old team, the Dallas Cowboys, by a score of 24-7.
Smith's day had ended early after he injured his shoulder (an

injury that may cost him the rest of the season) and, in truth,
his day had gone poorly from
the outset. Smith rushed six
times for a grand total of negative one yards, and made two
receptions for two yards.
But back to the crying.

There were some words about
Smith's daughter, some words
about doing his best, some
whimpering noises and a
bunch of tears. And it went on
forever. It wasn't like Smith
just suddenly started bawling.
There was definitely a solid
minute in which I was thinking, "Oh, Jesus, is he gonna
BEN WHARTON
Oh, man, Emmitt,
cry?
Oh, god, he's
please, no
Mental
Oh, man
Oh,
gonna do it
god, here he goes ...." My point,
however, is not that a man
can't cry. Nor is it that an athlete can't cry. I myself am all in
favor of men and athletes crying. The problem for me is that
Emmitt Smith did not have to be there, crying on TV after
sucking against his old team, mewling and whining about his
daughter's admonition to do his best. Emmitt Smith shouldn't
have been there. Emmitt Smith should be retired.
Frankly, in the last few years, we've been going through a
cruel epidemic of dreadfully extended playing careers. It upsets
me like little else. Smith's, to be honest, has been comparatively mild, or maybe just thankfully short (assuming he gets the
message and doesn't try to come back after this shoulder
injury). In contrast, I have to bring up the mother of all ill-fated
comeback attempts. Yes, as much as it pains me, I must now
write about Michael Jordan's time as a Washington Wizard. If
Smith's five games with the Cardinals have been an unsightly
rash, Jordan's two years with the Wizards was a biblical
plague ofboils.

Garnet win three matches
The Tide, undefeated in CC play, off to best start since 1999
The Garnet, led by Emma Benn 'O4, opened
Centennial Conference play with a clean sweep of
McDaniel and Muhlenberg 3-0 last weekend. The
Garnet, now 11-11 overall, 3-0 in the conference, are off
to their best conference start since 1999. For her play,
Benn was named CC Player of the Week.
Preceding the Swarthmore vs. McDaniel match,
McDaniel stunned Muhlenberg, winning in five
games to defeat the host team. Swarthmore's energy
and focus overrode McDaniel and the Garnet opened
the match with a 30-12 pounding of the Green Terror.
McDaniel's tired legs were no match for its opponent's
play. Swarthmore won the second and third games 3022, 30-21 Co-captain Emma Benn 'O4 and Katrina
Morrison 'O4 led the attack with 13 and eight kills,
respectively. Benn and Patrice Berry 'O6 together

amassed 23 digs.
The second match of the day, Swarthmore faced a

determined Muhlenberg team. Swarthmore fought
out the first victory of the match, winning 30-21 but
the Mules did not back down. The teams matched each
other point for point, and Muhlenberg closed in on the
30-point mark. Swarthmore, sparked by the offense of
Erica George 'O7 and the serving of Emily Conlon 'O6,
rallied and overtook the Mules, winning the game 3129. In the third game, the Garnet found themselves in
the same hole. Muhlenberg led in the final plays of the
game. George came up huge with two consecutive digs
in the final play. Co-captain Natalie Dunphy 'O5 finished the game with one of her six blocks on the
match. Swarthmore pulled out the win, 32-30.
The Garnet downed Ursinus on Wednesday, 3-0.
This win pushed the team's overall record back to the
.500 mark and their conference mark to 3-0.
The team will play in the Seven Sisters tournament this weekend.

NFL comments not racist
From RUSH, pg. 20
using the word, no matter how

innocently (Mark Furman provides a terrible example here) is

automatically a racist, his reputation tarnished. Yet no matter what

negative

slurs a black calls a white

person, the black person will not
be seen as a racist. Society accepts,
if not completely overlooks, this

verbal abuse by blacks.
What would have happened if
the movie "White Men Can't
Jump" were instead titled "Black
Quarterbacks
Can't
Think"?
Imagine the firestorm that movie

THE PHOENIX

would have caused. The time has
come for us all to be less sensitive
about race in general, take everything we hear with a grain of salt,
and, most importantly, realize that
a critical comment is not racism at
all and should not be construed as
such.
We need to stop ducking for
cover every time race is mentioned
and instead confront the issue
head-on and, for once, put an end
to the entire discussion.
I am upset, like millions of others, that our society is still not
completely
colorblind.
Rush
should not be at fault for his corn-

ments, but rather the media as a
whole should be reprimanded for
repeatedly harping on the issue of
race and not allowing it to die.
Rush couldn't care less if McNabb
were black or white or purple or
green; he was hired to talk football
and was merely providing an opinion.

If the media would put to rest,
and for all, differences
between blacks and whites in our

once

society, then the thought would
have never made it to Rush's head
in the first place.

Frankly, in the last few years, we've
been going through a cruel epidemic
of dreadfully extended playing
careers. It upsets me like little else.
Comparing specifics gets even uglier. Smith came in with
the goal of guiding the Cardinals toward respectability, Jordan
with taking the Wizards to the playoffs. Smith cried in a
postgame press conference; Jordan bitched about his teammates. Smith angered his former team by calling them trash;
Jordan became a clubhouse cancer on his new team. Credit the
Arizona Cardinals franchise for keeping Smith out of the front
office, where he won't be able to draft a confused high school
kid and trade away the team's best shooter. We can even get
into performance if you want. Smith has been bad, admittedly.
But he plays for the Cardinals, a team that can never establish
the run because it is always behind, because the defense sucks.
Jordan, admittedly, had flashes of brilliance, when he looked
like he was the best player on the court. Jordan, however, also
had games where he scored two, four or eight points against
teams like the Toronto Raptors. When he obviously should
have been the best player on the court. When he was playing
with four complementary players who were as good as any
other team's four in the Eastern Conference. When these players had been hand selected by him.
So why trash Michael Jordan now, when Abe Pollin has
already dumped him like a garbage bag? Because Jordan's
example can teach us a valuable lesson about walking away at
the right time, which is really a lesson about humility and
respecting the game, whatever the game may be. And while I
did pick on Michael Jordan, there's a long list of luminaries I
could easily have trashed. People like Babe Ruth, Willie Mays
and Muhammad Ali. Personal heroes like Johnny Unitas and
Cal Ripken Jr. So, Emmitt, please respect the game, walk away,
and retire. Now, or at the end of the season, it's up to you. And
please, please, stay retired.

Rush was half right
Much has been said over the past week and a half abou
Rush Limbaugh's comments about Donovan McNabb. Fo
those of you less informed, here is what Rush said:
"I think what we've had here is a little social-concern i
the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quar
terback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb
and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team tha
he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team."
The media immediately picked up on these comments an
created a firestorm around the league. McNabb was disap
pointed at these comments
and he, as well as others in the
media, cried racism. McNabb
said he accepts criticism of
his play but that race should
have no place in the discus-

sion. Finally, amid a heap of

controversy,
Limbaugh
resigned from the Sunday
NFL
Countdown
last

Thursday.
Rush

Limbaugh's comwere certainly not
racist. Since his comments, he
has said he had no racist
intentions or feelings towards
McNabb and that he was
merely calling the situation as
he saw it. In my opinion, Rush
was half right. Yes, Donovan

Captain Alex Elkins dribbles past a defender. The Tide defeated F&M 1-0 to snap a 17-game CC losing streak.

Tide snap 17-game losing streak
Men's soccer defeats CC opponents F&M 1-0 and Washington 3-1
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's soccer team improved to 4-7-1, 2-2 in the
Centennial Conference last week with two consecutive
CC victories over Washington and Franklin and
Marshall, 1-0 and 3-1 respectively. The victories lifted
the Tide to fourth place in the conference. The wins
snapped a 17-game losing streak for the Garnet Tide
against conference opponents, giving them confidence
as they prepare to face a tough conference foe in the
Muhlenberg Mules this Saturday at

Muhlenberg.
Muhlenberg (9-2, 3-0) presents a
tough challenge for Swarthmore, as
the Garnet must play on a grass surface against the first-place Mules in
front of an unfriendly home crowd.
The team will try to apply its winning formula from
last week by pressing hard offensively and playing
solid defense and, most importantly, by being confident
against such a tough opponent. "We've been practicing
on grass this week," coach Eric Wagner said. "And
we're going to go out and play our game and we'll be
confident offensively and defensively. This is one of the
toughest teams we face, but that's mainly because they
are the team we're facing right now. Next week, the
team we play then is the toughest team we have on the
schedule."
The game against Muhlenberg kicks off a busy and
tough fall break week for the Garnet Tide, as they face
their last two non-conference opponents in Cabrini and
Penn State-Behrend, along with the third-place Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays over the break. Despite the difficult
stretch, Wagner remains confident Swarthmore will be
able to keep pace with their opponents and hopefully
manage several victories. "I think it will be rough, but

4fe

3^

20

it isn't different than any other week," Wagner said.
"We also have the opportunity for more rest that week,
as we'll be training in the morning. It's an opportunity
for some good competition and I'd like to see us do well,
come away with a conference win or two and, even
down the road, knock off one or two more. As for our
non-conference opponents, Cabrini will be a strong,

physical team, and Behrend is having a good season, so
it won't be easy."
In addition to defeating both Washington and
Franklin and Marshall in the past week, the Garnet had
forward Colton Bangs 'O7 named as
the Centennial Conference Player

of the Week for tallying two goals
on the week, including the
gamewinner against

Washington

with less than two minutes remaining in the game. "It's only my third
week playing college soccer, and to get named Player of
the Week is a pretty sweet accomplishment," Bangs
said. "I'm just looking forward coming out and playing
more and just seeing what I can do for the rest of the
season."
Against F&M, Swarthmore controlled the game from
start to finish, dominating the Diplomats offensively
and defensively, scoring early and never losing the lead
in the game. "We dominated from the defense out,"
Brandon Penix 'O7 said. "Since we did that, it allowed
us to press the attack offensively."
The game against F&M marked the Garnet Tide's
first victory over the Diplomats since 1994 and the first
time the team had won consecutive conference games
since 1995, marking a vast improvement over last year's

winless conference record. "We've made a tangible staimprovement

Rounding Third

McNabb is overrated. The defense has in fact carried the team
(case in point: Sunday's game against the Redskins, where
McNabb was supposedly going to silence his critics). But no,
McNabb is not overrated because he is black. The issue of
black quarterbacks in the NFL is a non-issue. I think to imply
otherwise is completely off base.
So yes, Limbaugh's comments had some truth to them, but
he made the mistake of including race in the discussion.
Though he was offering his opinion on the matter, anytime a
person, especially a controversial conservative, mentions
race, the media is going to blow it up until a conclusion is
reached. The only viable conclusion for the media, and they
won't let up until either happens, was a resignation or a firing, and in this case Limbaugh was a victim of the former.
Many players were critical of Rush's comments, noting
how he had no basis to express such a view. Studs from Lavar
Arrington to Kevin Johnson to Rodney Peete called
Limbaugh's comments "asinine" and said they were disap-

pointed somebody "crossed that line." I think these reactions
from black players should hold some merit. Other people,
however, (e.g. Wesley Clark and Howard Dean) who have no
business entering the conversation stepped in and blasted
Limbaugh. These people should be ashamed for attempting to
turn a sensitive situation into their political gain.
As I stated earlier, Limbaugh's comments have been blown
way out of proportion. The fact that Rush is white is his only
crime here. If Michael Irvin had made a similar comment
about McNabb on the show, nobody would have cared.
Moreover, if Irvin had said, "Patrick Ramsey gets sacked too
much because he is white and therefore slow," the media
would have overlooked the comments, and the words proba-

even drawn a chuckle from Ramsey.
I have a big problem with the fact that this is unacceptable
in our society. Since when have some people been "qualified"
to talk about race while others are not allowed to even mention the issue? Why is it that racism is okay in certain social
