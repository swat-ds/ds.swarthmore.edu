Members of various activist groups meet to voice concerns about the Forum for Activism charter.

Council approves FFA charter
BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu
A Student Council subcommittee officially
approved the controversial Forum for Activism
(FFA) charter Monday night. Jeff Regier 'O3, who
submitted the proposal, is now in the process of
trying to convince activist groups to join the new
organization.
"It's been approved, and that was a big hurdle,"
Regier said. "We're at the point now where we
need to get the groups signed up, but the hard
part's over."
Students have launched similar campaigns in
the past, but none have come so close to success.
Sunday night Regier and SC hosted a meeting
in the Wharton Group Space to hear eligible
activist groups voice any concerns they might
have. "At the last meeting with representatives
from the groups, there really was not that much
criticism. I was surprised," Regier said. "It's really progressing smoothly."
The thirteen activist groups who are eligible
for membership in FFA will decide over the next
several weeks whether they will join the new
organization, which will act primarily as a finan-

cial buffer between member activist groups and
the Student Budget Committee.
"SPAC is going to approve it," Student
Progressive Action Committee member Roxanne
Yaghoubi 'O5 said. "We still have a few reservations, but we're going to try it, at least for the year,
and see what happens."
Yaghoubi said SPAC initially had some concerns about joining FFA, but the expansion of the
definition of an "activist organization" to include
several conservative groups allayed their concerns. These changes included inviting the
College Republicans and Swarthmore Students
Advocating Life as well as proposing the creation
of a general activist bulletin board and newsletter.
"I was happy to see these changes," she said. "I
want to stress that I am very excited about this,
because there are many general activist concerns

THE PHOENIX

that have not been addressed. For example,
activist groups like SPAC can't predict changes in
their budgets due to certain events. We have suffered tremendously with funds this year because
of increased activity after the Sept. 11 attacks."
Nate Wessler 'O4, a member of Conscious
Consumers, expressed his personal approval of
FFA but said that his group had not reached a

final decision on whether to join.
"I think it's a good idea," he said. "I'm glad to
see it going ahead. It could use some improvement, but it could really have some positive effects
for groups."
Jessica Sheldon, 'O4, a member of Empty the
Shelters, was enthusiastic about the group, but
expressed several concerns and could not say
whether ETS would join.
"We haven't felt like we've really had problems
getting funding, or with budget committee, so in
that sense, I don't know how the forum will help
us, but we definitely support the idea of uniting all
the activist groups on campus," she said. "A concern of ours, however, is that it might create more
bureaucracy than help us, but I think right now
it's too early to tell."
According to the charter, the primary objective
of the new group is to improve the tenuous connection that exists between the Student Budget
Committee and activist groups due to the unpredictable funding needs and high turnover rates in
such groups. The forum would act largely as a
financial lobbyist for under funded activist
groups.
"I don't think money buys activism, like, if you
increase a group's budget by two, you'll get twice
the activism," Regier said. "But I do think it can
be helpful to have a little extra cash."
FFA hopes to revitalize struggling activist
groups by maintaining an organization skeleton
when high turnover rates or the graduation of key
members leaves groups inactive. The forum also
wants to encourage cooperation among groups
and create a united voice to represent the activist

The staff minimum wage will rise to $9 from $6.66 next year, a 35
percent increase, based on recommendations from the Compensation
Review Committee (CRC). The plan, which the Board of Managers
approved Feb. 23, also includes improvements in health and retirement
benefits. The CRC's proposal came after nearly a year's review of staff
compensation issues, and it represents one of the largest staff wage
increases in college history.
But the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign, which
formed last year with the goal of implementing a staff minimum wage
of $l3, was dissatisfied with the proposal for not going far enough,
according to campaign member Sam Blair 'O2. But he also said that "the
committee had very little leeway to recommend anything higher"
because of budgetary constraints. Although CRC chair Melanie Young
agreed, she would not say that the committee would have recommended a higher increase if it had been able to.
"The $9 represents a deviation from the market," CRC member Jeff
Lott said. "Raising the minimum from what it was to $9 is a pretty big
step."

The campaign's suggested "living wage" of $l3 was based on criteria
published by the Women's Association for Women's Alternatives
(WAWA), an organization in Swarthmore. According to WAWA, a "living wage" allows one to "be self-sufficient, to meet all her needs without government support." Its 1998 study said a single parent in
Delaware County would need about $l3 per- hour to achieve this selfsufficiency. Other estimates range from $lO 15 per hour, depending on
location and family size.

"They are called entry-level jobs for a reason.
It wouldn't make sense for someone to leave
a dishwasher job making $l3 per hour."

Pat James, CRC member

Pat James, director of community service learning programs and a
CRC member, also said the committee was wary of raising the minimum wage higher than $9. She believed those making the lowest wage,
usually in lower-skill jobs, should make a lower sum than those in
higher-level positions. "For this issue, we part company with the living
wage campaign," she said. "They are called entry-level jobs for a reason. It wouldn't make sense for someone to leave a dishwasher job making $l3 per hour."
Young, who is also associate vice president for human resources,
said the committee's approach differs from that of the campaign. "I
think it's fair to say they see it more simply than we do," she said. "We
see a different set of problems than they do, and we've picked a different method than they have" for resolving those problems.
But Young also conceded the importance of a sufficient minimum
wage. "All of us believe that it's pretty problematic for people to work
full-time in a job and not be able to support themselves," she said. "We
all understand that's a problem, and we want to do whatever we can."
Blair conceded that $9 is "clearly an improvement and a positive
step," but he did not think it would allow someone with a family to
meet his or her baric needs without a second job.
According to members, the CRC considered a wider range of compensations, including health and retirement benefits, training opportunities and benefits relating to quality of life, such as the popular
Learning for Life program, in which students and staffteach one another. James explained the purpose behind the CRC's proposing a lower

Victim's family calls its grief 'a cry for peace'

BY MATTHEW FITTING

Even now, she said, her son is still drawing. He sketches in crayon family portraits of a mother, sister and
father. They're almost accurate, these pictures, almost
true. They were true, before Sept. 1L
Then Craig Scott Amundson, an active-duty multimedia illustrator at the Pentagon, was one of 125 people
killed in that building, one of over 3,700 killed in all. His
5-year-old son Eliot has not been the same since, said
Craig's wife Amber. She recalled one night when he drew
15 of these family portraits in a half-hour, then collapsed
into his mother's arms of exhaustion.
"I cannot fulfill the place in my children's hearts that
longs for their daddy's voice, their daddy's touch and
their daddy's guidance," she said. "It breaks my heart
that any child should have to go through what my children are going through."
But her grief, she added, should not be construed as a
cry for war. Instead, it should be a call for peace.
Amber and her brother-in-law Ryan were keynote
speakers at last Saturday's "Wage Peace" gathering,
sponsored by the Swarthmore Progressive Action
Committee (SPAC) and the Delaware County Campaign
for Peace and Justice. The Amundsons have both
received national recognition for their objection to the
war on terror following the Sept. 11 attacks, and each
were met with a standing ovation from the crowd of about
250, mostly area residents, in the Swarthmore Friends

Meetinghouse.
At one point, Amber read from a letter she wrote to
President Bush, a letter that received no reply, attracting
national media attention. "We cannot see the light of liberty if we are blinded by vengeance and fear," she read.
Then she made a direct appeal to Bush: "I'm begging you
for the sake of humanity and the world to stop killing."
Behind the now-single mother of two hung an
American flag with a white peace sign in place of the
usual 50 stars. Near the end of the letter, her voice started to choke with tears.
"I am not doing well," she said. "I am hurt that the U.S.
is moving forward in such a violent manner. I do not hold
you responsible for my husband's death, but I do believe
you have a responsibility to listen to me and please hear
my pain. I cannot stop speaking until we stop killing."
Citing different dates when U.S. forces inflicted significant casualties in different areas of Afghanistan, Amber
insisted that "justice does not include the death of more
innocent victims." She brought attention to days like Oct.
22, when 93 Afghans were killed east of Kandahar. And
Jan. 23, when U.S. Special Forces killed "up to 21 people."
Though offering no sources for these figures, she insisted
that the list "goes on and on."
The Amundsons also received widespread attention
for a Nov. 24 march they made from Washington, D.C. to

Amber and Ryan Amundson, the wife and brother-in-law of a Pentagon employee killed on Sept. H, spoke on Saturday
about the ongoing war on terror. 'Justice does not include the death of more innocent victims,' Amber said.
New York City, a walk for peace meant to draw attention
to those victims' families that stood against the war.
Such families, Ryan said, are more widespread than
people think, even though a concrete percentage of how
many object might be impossible to obtain.
"My sense is that people that have been affected by
this are thinking a lot more about it," he said, recalling
the day of Sept. 11, when the government rented space in
a Washington hotel for the victims' families. "No one was
really talking about revenge. I never heard that word."
Both conceded that the terrorist attacks of that day are
crimes and that Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida terrorist network, which both believe are responsible,

should be brought to justice. But peacekeeping forces and
international law should accomplish this goal, they said.
"I think law and common sense support that," Ryan
said. "It's the right tool for the job," he added, comparing
the use of the Army to capture bin Laden and al-Qaida to

"using a sledgehammer on a swarm of mosquitoes."
"I do not want my children to grow up thinking that all
the violence after the Sept. 11 attacks was because of my
husband," Amber said. "Lasting peace requires consideration of the root causes of terrorism," she said, and then
called for a reconsideration of U.S. foreign policy, which
she insisted must focus on "preventative measures" to
assuage further terrorist action and activity.
Ryan said his brother worked for the Pentagon but
was not a man of violence. "I don't believe my brother

and all those other beautiful souls would approve of us
using their deaths to keep the status quo," he said.
"We've been hearing about peace more and more these
days, and of course it means different things to different
people," Amber said in closing to her speech. But her
hope, she added, is for a world without a fear, and she
appealed to the part inside those present and everywhere
that contained no hatred, "the part that wants peace."

WSRN and SBC unsure about restructuring process
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
When communication breaks down, all
hell breaks loose.
This is what WSRN and the Student
Budget Committee (SBC) discovered last
semester when lack of organization caused
friction between the two groups. WSRN is
now working to reorganize the station's
management. This process may involve
formal restructuring of the station's board
of directors and a budget cut.
WSRN's failure to follow procedures for
tracking its equipment had put the station
on SBC's bad side.
Mike Spiegel 'O3, director of the folk
music department for the station, said SBC
froze the station's budget in the fall of last
year because the station had not completed
a capital replacement list, which is an

index of items with estimated replacement

dates. WSRN has since finished the list, and

SBC has restored the budget completely.

While this likely cut will affect future
purchases, Beveridge doesn't believe it
would be a major problem for the station,
since it can always request more money
from SBC if it's needed.
The station was over-budgeted last year,
Spiegel said. This year, WSRN received
$12,000 instead of the usual $lO,OOO. Jack
Borrebach 'O2, the station's general manager, said the station received "a substantial
budget increase last year, which, looking
back, was unnecessary."
Borrebach was also unconcerned about
the budget cut. "There is no reason to
anticipate a budget cut that would be really detrimental to us," he said.
Traczynski said he couldn't comment on
the possibility of a budget cut. "I don't
entirely know what the budget they want

is," he said. He did admit that most groups'
proposed budgets are usually cut during
the spring budgeting meeting, since groups
tend to ask for more money than they really need.
Budgeting decisions for all student
groups will be made between April 7 and
14.

SC, Borough Council look to
improve town-gown relations
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

pbrundal@swarthmore.edu

'

[

Last fall, each student received a card good for
discounts at ville businesses. Whether the card has
generated more town-gown interaction is debatable, but college and borough leaders still hope
that relations will improve.
Student Council met last Thursday with members of Swarthmore borough government to discuss this topic. Though ways to involve students in
ville business dominated the discussion, several
innovative ideas were proposed to attempt to further integrate students into the social community
and local government.
Representatives of the ville included mayor
Elric "Eck" Gerner, Borough Council President
Kenneth Klothen '73 and newly-hired Economic
Development Coordinator Jennifer Vincent.
The first topic of conversation was ville feelings
about the discount cards, distributed to students
last fall. Mayor Gerner was optimistic about the
cards, citing a story of one Swarthmore student
who opted to take advantage of Swarthmore
Music's free introductory lesson offer. The student
later returned for subsequent lessons and
informed friends about the offer.
Vincent was less sure of the cards' usefulness in
generating revenue for ville businesses, explain-

ing that, when she approached participating businesses late last year, "most of [the participating
stores] hadn't gotten much of a response at all, and

THE PHOENIX

those that had found that they were the people
coming anyway."
Vincent thought the failure of the card was due
to the often miniscule offers promoted on the card,
citing, for example, the Co-op's 99-cent soda promotion. "You're not going to walk to the ville to
save sixteen cents," Vincent said, referring the discount from the normal Co-op price of $ll5.
"If we could come up with some more enticing
offer, we would get [students] to come and shop at
the Co-op," Vincent said.

debatable success this year,
Vincent said there were plans to undertake a similar student discount program again this fall.
Despite some disagreement about whether discount cards or ID cards were the best way to entice
students into the ville, all present were in favor of
a more progressive student discount system, in
which stores could update their offers monthly.
Stores would also be able to post flyers or other
advertisements on the college grounds and store
windows to keep students informed about the disDespite their

counts.
Vincent said this follow-up advertising was crucial to the success of the system. "It's really important to keep communicating" about the student
discount, she said. "If you get the card in August,
you're not necessarily going to remember to come
back and use it in January."
In addition, participants discussed the possibility

Mayor, SC discuss student-run venture
From COUNCIL, pg. 5
of initiating a student-run business in the ville. Although
the group entertained several suggestions, including a
late-night eatery, Gerner's suggestion of a used CD store
generated the most excitement.
Gerner said that, though many of the street level
spaces in the ville were occupied, there might be the possibility of finding a second-floor space for the store.
Though he thought it was unlikely that ville building
owners would provide students with rent cheaper than
normal, Gerner suggested that investors might be willing
to provide the additional funds needed to supplement rent
payments student managers would make.
"There are several people in the town who would like
to see the ville grow and thrive," he said. The mayor
suggested that borough residents might be good candidates for investors in a student-run endeavor, which he
termed a "venture-capital business" pursuit. Gerner said
that, though the business investment itself might not
prove profitable, "the offsetting factor is that [such a

business] would attract people to the ville," which, in
turn, might provide greater business for other ville
~stores.
Though all thought such an addition to the ville would
be an asset, some students expressed concerns over the
feasibility of such a business. "I'm a little nervous
whether a [student-run business] would be able to sustain
itself," Student Council Co-President Matt Rubin 'O3 said,
making a comparison to the Jumping Cow Cafe, a failed
student entrepreneurial endeavor in the ville a number of
years ago.
The group also discussed the town's feelings on the col-

lege's proposed land-use policy, which involves requests
from the college for the rezoning of certain properties now
deemed residential, as well as the development of properties related to the town revitalization efforts. Though all
ville representatives agreed that the issue was complex
and long-lasting, most, including Klothen, said that "one of
the questions in the minds of several people in the ville is
whether the college's support for the inn is a quid pro quo
to get other things passed by the borough government,"
including rezoning three or four blocks of college property, which he said was a "big ask."
Klothen also suggested setting up a partnership in
which ville residents would invite students unable to
return home over break to their homes for a meal. Rubin
suggested that this idea be extended to religious holidays

as well.
In addition, the group discussed ways in which students could become more involved in ville governance,
suggesting that the ville government create and distribute
to first-year students a "Guide to Borough Government."
The proposed guide would include a list of all the Borough
Council advisory groups and describe the steps students
should take to become involved. Gerner also suggested a
possible student internship in the borough office.

Swarthmore Police Report

a Huffy bicycle was stolen from the front yard of a
home on Yale Avenue. The bicycle was valued at $125
On March 1 at 7:13 a.m., Officer Thomas stopped a
motorist for making a right turn on a red light at
Swarthmore Avenue and N. Chester Road in violation
of a posted sign. The operator did not have a driver's
license and provided a name and date of birth. Officer
Thomas requested verification from the computer but
was informed that the system was not functioning. The
operator was informed his information would be
checked and, if found incorrect, a summons would be
issued. Subsequently the information was checked via
computer and the name provided was found to be fictitious. Additional investigation revealed that the operator had a suspended license and two outstanding
warrants in Philadelphia. Police went to the construction site where the individual was working and arrested him in accordance with the standing warrants. The
suspect was taken to the Swarthmore police station,
issued traffic citations, and turned over to agents from
the Philadelphia Warrant Unit. Nether Providence
Police and Swarthmore College Public Safety assisted
in the arrest.

The windshield of a Ford Windstar parked in the
parking lot on Rutgers Avenue was broken between
March 2 at 5 p.m. and March 3 at 8:30 a.m. A large
rock, apparently used to break the windshield, was
found next to the vehicle.

Large-scale
problems
Admit it. You were disappointed when you heard
that Nickel Creek was coming to campus as this
year's big performance. This is not what you expected when you heard the term "large-scale event." You
thought about that rock band that's just starting to
make it big or a hip-hop group you saw on MTV
once. Essentially, you thought about seeing someone
you, or at least your roommate, had heard of.
While we have no objection to the genre or talents
of Nickel Creek, the committee in charge of the event
has not approached the situation with as much energy as we would have liked.
For instance, when Nickel Creek performs later
this semester as the large-scale event, it will occur in
a less-than-optimal setting: Upper Tarble. The location has several problems. Of primary concern are
the acoustics. We have two multi-million dollar performing arts auditoriums, yet we will use neither for
this performance. Had the committee organized

Upper Tarble is simply not
designed for concerts. The
amphitheater, or even Parrish
Beach would be a better
choice of venue.
sooner and instituted the proposals deadline for an
earlier date, a concert in Lang or LPAC might have
been possible. In addition, the physical space is not

appropriate; Upper Tarble is simply not designed for
concerts. The amphitheater, or even Parrish Beach,

would be a better choice of venue.
A second concern is with the Large-Scale Events
Committee itself. While there must be a committee to
evaluate the feasibility and cost ofeach proposal, the
student body would be the best judge of who should
perform. When the final proposals come before the
committee, the decision of whom to select should be
put to a wider audience. No musical group would
appeal to every student, but holding a referendum
would allow for maximum support of the winning

proposal.
But here's the rub: the quality of the proposals
depends on the students who propose them. If largescale events do not include performers you think are
worthwhile, begin an initiative yourself. When proposals are solicited next year, find out if your
favorite band is available within cost and scheduling
and draw up your own large-scale event. This year,
there were only two proposals a referendum is
only useful if there are several choices.
For the future, we call on the Large-Scale Events
Committee to act as administrators, not representatives, and to allow all students to choose among proposals the committee deems viable. The student body
as a whole should play a larger part in the process
by both proposing more events and choosing the
winner. Because such a significant proportion of the
Student Activity Fee goes toward the large-scale
event, students need a direct voice in how that
money is used.

Recycle this Phoenix or die
Yeah, you heard us. Throw this baby in the trash,
and you'll have to reckon with a force terrible to
behold. The amount of paper wasted on this campus
is shameful, and we don't want to be associated with
it. Just as wasteful as piles of unused pages near public printers or flyers that plaster the walls only to
come down in a few days are the left-behind
Phoenixes that litter campus on Thursdays. So when
you're done, toss this paper in a recycling bin or use

Defending a living wage
Dear Editor:
In response to Patricia James's letter ("In defense of the compensation committee," Feb. 28), I would like to clarify certain misconceptions put forth. The Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
does not "support the creation of wage structures based on family
need," as James seemed to imply. While we support a compensation
system with a minimum wage based on basic living costs, we never
have advocated tailoring wages to family size. Such a violation of
the equal pay for equal work principle is illegal.
James writes that "the CRC has been open about what we discuss
and open about what we recommend." In fact, the CRC has never
published full meeting minutes. For a brief period, the committee
used "group memories," but those have not been kept since early
last summer. In soliciting input for its draft recommendations, the
CRC declined to provide copies of their recommendations. Finally,
James writes that "members of the CRC have been subject to meanspirited personal and sometimes anonymous attacks." While she
does not explicitly accuse members of the campaign of these attacks,
we wouldlike to proactively state that we feel we have not said anything that could be construed as a personal attack. We encourage
her to discuss with the campaign any perceived attacks.
Also, in the Feb. 28 article "Tuition increase will be higher than
expected," a quotation from Andy Scarborough 'O4 seemed to imply
that a living wage resolution is being instituted at the college. There

is no such resolution, though we are still working toward one. Vice
President of Finance and Planning Paul Aslanian was quoted as
blaming the tuition increase partially on "the newly instituted minimum wage for staff." This would only affect between 35 and 40 staff
members, and would cost approximately $40,000. It's difficult to
imagine that this could have an impact on tuition increases. Its cost
is about $3O per student, less than 01 percent of tuition fees. But faculty salaries will increase by more than seven percent, as compared
with staff salary of three to 3.5 percent; the faculty will thus receive
an additional $500,000 beyond the percentage set for staff.

College opposes drug use
Dear Editor:
The Phoenix's Feb. 28 report on the board's action to
replace federal financial aid denied to students with
drug convictions could create the impression that the
college endorses or condones drug use. That is anything
but the case.
The board's action simply reaffirms Swarthmore's
long-standing commitment to meeting the full need of
admitted students. A drug offense or any other criminal
activity should, in our view, have bearing on the admissions process, not financial aid, and refinements to our
application will provide us with the information needed
to make appropriate judgments. Ifa candidate is worthy
of admission and it's certainly conceivable that some
students with past drug offenses are
then
Swarthmore is committed to meeting his or her full
financial need, even if that means covering aid dollars
withheld by the government. Similarly, any continuing
student in good standing will have her or his need met.
Maurice G. Eldridge '6l
Assistant Secretary to the Board

Correction
In the Feb. 28 article "Board decides to cover aid
for drug offenders," there is an anecdote attributed
to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Jim Bock
'9O that incorrectly states, "a convicted murderer
enrolled at Princeton and was later kicked out for
lying about his grades." It should have said that
Bock read in The New Yorker about a man with a
criminal record who enrolled at Princeton and then
was asked to leave because he had falsified his
admissions record. He had also heard about a murderer at another school, but it was not Princeton.

'Axis of Evil' not really united
So, there's a war on, a war that has been on since the
Oct. 7, 2001: five months ago to this day. From last
October, we have heard Iraq mentioned first quietly,
then more and more loudly as the United States' interest in Afghanistan waned with the dissipation of the
Taliban and the routing of al-Qaida forces. We now hear
Iraq will be the next phase of this war, as early as next
month, or, perhaps, as soon as the United States cruise
missile stock is replenished. While the world is raging
with debate and outrage toward recent declarations of
American intentions, America itself has hardly questioned the strategic

validity of attacking
or the irresponsible belligerence of

olution in the first place. Rhetorical attacks do not help.
And then there's Iraq. There is no doubtthat Saddam
Hussein is a despicable individual, as responsible for his
own people's deaths as the Western hawks in the Gulf
War and after. However, Iraq is not even tangentially
linked to the Sept. 11 attacks: the United States' grudge
against this power is much older than that, connected
with a policy reversal in the mid-1990s to topple the
Saddam regime instead of containing it. Iraq may be
rebuilding its weapons arsenal, but it does so at a snail's
pace compared to other countries in the region, particularly Israel. Saddam may be a maverick, but he is no suicidal maniac. He knows that any attack outside Iraq
would lead to the annihilation of Baghdad. What the
United States is demanding is historically unreasonable:
When the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) was revealed to be full of American spies, the
door to intrusive weapons inspections was effectively
closed. Moreover, it is almost solely the United States
that supports the destruction of Iraq: Its neighbors are
afraid of the repercussions, and Europe, Russia and
China all counsel reserve and constructive engagement.
The bottom line is that Iraq is not a part of the extrastate terrorist threat, which is, after all, one that all
states are committed to defeating. To attack Iraq would
be dangerous, tragic and wholly unhelpful at eradicating
terrorism. By using the moral momentum of the war to
interests
pursue its own narrow national interests
that are not widely shared and could cause as much system instability as the terrorist threat itself the United
States would be ceding both moral authority and global
leadership. The war on terrorism would be no more than
the catchphrase for America's foreign policy interventions, just as countering communism in the 1980s justified direct interventions in Nicaragua, El Salvador and
the Dominican Republic, support for brutal regimes in
Iran and South Africa, and the creation of state-failing
proxy conflict in Lebanon, Angola and Afghanistan.
This is a time to draw a line in the sand: against
transnational terrorism but also for the very notion of

Redemption: Pictionary victory for
Suzanne over art history professors
Suzanne Wu is a cocky, immature, chain-smoking, barely
coherent bitch who doesn't think you can beat her at your
own game. If you don't mind getting your ass beat down and
then living with the subsequent embarrassment, challenge
her by writing to phoenix@swarthmore.edu.
If you ask me, art history is sort of like the blind leading the
retarded, leading those who have trouble walking down a dark
alley. Because ultimately, we all know, art historians are merely repressed artists, doomed by some tragic twist of fate to
spend their lives studying those they so desperately wish they
were. It's celebrity journalism with an academic twist.
Not that professors Janine Mileaf and Patricia Reilly would
make very good celebrity journalists. These two may be firstwhich
year Swarthmore profs, but sycophantic they are not
is good, you know, because I can never help but take advantage
of that sort of thing.
This week, I challenged Reilly and Mileaf to a game of
Pictionary, and the two kindly squeezed me into their busy
schedules between entertaining candidates for an open art history position and crying about how they are forced to work on
the same floor as crazy art prof Brian Meunier. Pictionary

afforded them an obvious advantage

major. I may sleep through the survey on Western art, but at
least I wasn't the worst person in Foundation, the one whose
piece everyone said nice things about because it was so obviously bad.
I meet Mileaf and Reilly in the seminar room on the third
floor of Beardsley with my teammate JakeBeckman 'O4. Reilly
Reilly even has four
and Mileaf are initially all business
sharp no. 2 pencils waiting for us in the room and before we
even start reading the rules, Mileaf introduces her own. "If
we're not done by five, can we agree that whoever's ahead
wins?" she says, leaving herself an outlet in case we're
weirdos, like every smart woman should do.
"How about if we're not done by five, you forfeit, and we
rack up a win?" Jake counters. Cheap wins are like mother's
Jake and I are on the same page. We compromilk to me
mise, though, deciding to play without the "special challenge
die," which, according to the box, incorporates a "little bit
more challenge and a lot more laughter," both of which I avoid
like the plague in my newly hysterical midterms mode.
Reilly reads the rules out loud, and I think I hear her say
the word "Picturist." "What is that?" I ask. "Pictionary lingo
for the person who sketches," Reilly explains. "It's even capitalized in the rules." Mileaf looks at me. "The draw-er," she
says with a slow drawl, in case I don't understand more sophisticated terminology, like the fancy words "sketcher" or, you
know, "artist." I'll show her. Harrumph.
The game starts with an All Play question, where both
teams work simultaneously on the same clue and the team that
guesses first takes the next turn. Jake quickly starts drawing
something that resembles an alien, until I realize the antenna
is supposed to be a spotlight. "Arena!" I yell. He draws a chair
and darkens the first line in his arena. "Front row!" I scream.
I'm right, but we are shamed after looking at Reilly's quick
sketch of the same word. Her arena even has little Playskool
toy-looking spectators. But speed triumphs over quality, like
the papers I wrote for Reilly's class last semester.
After this initial burst, we fall quickly behind. The prof
team gets something like five right in a row, but thanks to their
pathetic rolling of the die, they are only 15 squares ahead. Still,
after losing on the words "glowbug," "around," "shave" and
"bonehead," we decide that it might be a good time to call on
the reserves, in the form of Andrew Kazakes 'O4, who was originally supposed to be my teammate, but like usual got confused
and stood outside Professor Reilly's office wondering why
there was no one there for twenty minutes. Reilly and Mileaf,
with their comfortable lead, agree to let the tardy Andrew be
the third on our student team, with the caveat that I must
include in the article their generosity and mercifulness.
Not that this mercifulness is doing us any good. The next
word we get is "ruins," and I begin the visual equivalent of
stuttering. Meanwhile, Reilly gets right down to drawing a

fancy crumbling Doric column. We are doomed, I think. I don't
feel any better with the next clue, when Andrew complains
that he doesn't even know "what that is." "Too bad," say the
profs simultaneously. No more mercifulness. They may grant
you one extension, but don't expect two.
But then the gap between the two art historians' areas of
expertise begins to show. When the word is "lace," Mileaf
draws a tank top sliding down to reveal a slip of lingerie.
"Decolletage," Reilly guesses. Jake is drawing one of those
silly looking old-school coUars. "Look at that," Reilly says to
Mileaf after the word is revealed and we're comparing drawings. "That just shows the way you think. How 20th century."
And we begin to come back, thanks to some more poor
rolling on the prof team's part, and Jake's bizarre ability to
interpret Andrew's drawings
all of which look to me like
phalluses
correctly as "bug spray" and "Empire State
Building." And finally, on the clue "Lion King," we pass up the
profs. "Oh, no," says Mileaf. Reilly comforts her. Despite their
inability to execute late in the game, the two profs really do
seem to have a sort of mind meld, even with their sitcom-perfect dichotomous personalities. Where modern art expert
Mileaf is giggly, Renaissance scholar Reilly is dry; today,
Mileaf is dressed in a sweatshirt, Reilly in a suit.
The duo retakes the lead with the easy word "cloud" but roll
three successive ones. We have to break their streak before
their luck turns. It's Andrew's turn to draw, and the category
is "person, place or animal." He and Mileaf have their pencils
poised and ready, and when the timer is flipped, Andrew
immediately starts drawing a naked lady on a horse. "Uh, circus," Jake guesses. "Objectification," I guess. With every successive wrong guess, Andrew draws the woman's breasts larger and larger in frustration. Then he draws a little easel and
palette. Duh, "Lady Godiva." It all seems so easy once you
know. Mileaf meanwhile, has gotten hung up on drawing little
chocolates and a cartoon face made of circles eating them.

Andrew Steel For The Phoenix

It's come down to this: We are three squares from the finish, the profs are six away. And it's my roll. All I have to do is
hope that I'm not on the wrong side of a two-out-of-three
chance and then draw something halfway comprehensible.
Usually, when I set up my stories like this, I end up losing
anyway. But Tuesday was just one of those days. I rolled a
three and then took full advantage as the art historians were

hindered by their own expertise.
"I thought your drawing was in perspective," Mileaf says to
Reilly after we get the clue "drawbridge" first. I won. Holy shit.
We're the better Picturists, even if it was three against two for
the latter half, and even if Jake did cheat by listening in on the
other team's guesses! That was the most fun I've had in ages.

'40 Days' garners little praise

Josh Hartnett's awkward predicament leaves reviewer feeling more single than usual
"No. I'm eating by myself."

BY MORGHAN HOLT

"By yourself?"

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

"Yes. Alone."

I had to be a guy. Or at least I think that's it. As a
woman, I had a tough time finding Josh Hartnett's desperation during his attempt to remain asexual for 40 days and
40 nights particularly amusing. I felt the pain of the

woman struggling against the awkwardness of encountering him with a poorly-timed, aching-to-be-satiated, midday, business-meeting erection more than I felt the pain of
his abstinence. I had to be a guy to truly appreciate the
nuances and subtle humor of Michael Lehmann's latest

comedy, "40 Days and 40 Nights."
As I made my way through the masses exiting the theater, where I'd sat alone as my good friend gallantly accompanied my usual movie date and preschool-aged daughter
to a more appropriate, less sexually explicit flick, I thought
maybe the dichotomous nature of my sex life and

Hartnett's Matt Sullivan's was what had stifled my
empathic response. Matt Sullivan had sex everywhere,
anywhere, with anyone, every chance he got, which was
pretty much all the time. For him, not thinking about or
having was a real chore. It was a pervasive part of his
world, as routine as brushing and flossing every night is
for me. My own sexual sphere, in stark contrast, perfectly
illustrated by a not infrequent encounter earlier that same
weekend, is a tad less colorful. While waiting for my
daughter, whose multifaceted social life boldly and unmistakably elucidates the nonexistence of my own, I decided
to dine alone and, for once, eat a meal in relative peace.
"Table for one, please."

"Pardon, miss. One?"
"Yes. One."
"But, er, how many will be joining you?"
"None. Just me. That's all. One."

"Oh. Of course. One. Right this way."

The host led me to the furthest, darkest corner, generously and casually minimizing the abject shame and embarrassment I should obviously have been feeling. My waitress,
as well, was taken aback. As she set two menus on the table,
I promptly picked up one and motioned to the other.
"I really only need one."
"Oh. You'll share then?"

"Oh. Yes. Right. Well, take your time. I'll, um, I'll be
right back."
Dining alone, sex was the furthest thing from my mind,
even as the restaurant staff was appalled by the faux pas of
my dating oblivion. So maybe it's my own lack of a sex life
that prevented me from feeling bad for Matt as he endlessly warded off nude female bodies, enticing sexual opportunities, stifling both his own attractiveness and his burning
attraction to all things female.
I recently cut and colored my hair. With my shimmering, Target-bought "Rich Auburn" bob, I'd be irresistible,
I figured, pushing desire-wrought men away in a crazed
panic, not unlike Matt's borderline psychotic and intermittently semi-amusing attempts to evade female contact.
Or so I fantasized.
"God, Mom, what did you do to your hair? And whatIS
that shirt? Gross. You can't wear that. Are you growing a
moustache?"
The fashion police have evidently taken to violating
child labor laws: My fashion-savvy four-year-old is their
new chief inspector. So my crimson locks aren't doing it
for me, and we've already touched upon my apparent fashion disasters. The truth is, regardless of the day's clothing
or hairstyle, there's really no action here.
And for Hartnett's Matt, wallowing in the reminiscence
of painfully lost relationship, there's no action, either, as
he takes a Lenten vow of celibacy and emerges from
priest's chambers a new man. For him, however, given his
ravishing good looks, irresistible charm and natural mammalian instincts, this endeavor proves slightly more taxing than it would for someone, say, like me.
He struggles against his own imagination, his own
urges, his roommate's ceaseless parade of scantily clad,
Maxim-quality women, his friends' taunting. He is determined to get over his ex. Why he thinks abstaining from
sex will accomplish this is never exactly clear. And bigger
problems emerge just as he's gotten over the hump, beginning to feel invigorated, less oppressed by the self-challenge: 1) he falls madly in love in the Laundromat with a
lovely girl, nice eyes, firm midriff and 2) his coworkers

all
attempts to break him down and walk away with the
$lB,OOO pot.

It doesn't work. He continues on his mission, hallucinating that every woman on the street is buck naked and
discovering some rather revolting secrets about his boss's
sex life. The audience was howling through much of the
movie. They thought it was really funny: his straining,
untimely erections, his obsessive menial occupations,
employed to distract himself from thoughts of sex, the
attempts by his porn star-looking female coworkers to
break his resolve and get him to sleep with them in the
copy room, with the whole office observing. I, however,
was far from entertained, even as Matt soared above and
dove into a sea of swelling breasts. It was really hard for
me to stay focused on and allow myself to be amused by
nearly two hours worth of smut, sex and the desperation
caused by the lack thereof.
And, just to save a little face, I'll say my inability to
relate was probably entirely attributable to my gender.

Sophomore paper results in madness, incoherence
Dear faculty, department chairs, Registrar, Honors Coordinator and Penthouse
forum,
Hello, all. How are your children? I'm very isolated right now. Alone, door slammed
tight, floor empty as far as I know. There might be noise outside my room, but I don't hear
it. Just the Cure, my own typing, gurgling Woolman radiator noises and the occasional
interruptions of the horrible little Microsoft help imp computer/paperclip thingy. "It
looks like you are writing a letter!" says the help demon.
"Bite me," I reply. For I am not writing a letter; oh, no.
This is no mere letter. This is a document of great power,
possibility and persuasion, a new constitution, a new
"Atlas Shrugged." This is cue in 2001 theme my sophomore paper!
So I've been good. V filled out my whole cover sheet,
and nowhere on it does it state, for instance, that I am
applying for a special major in "your mom." My honors
application? Done, too, though I still haven't quite convinced myself honors is a good idea. As far as I can tell,
the honors program has something to do with Old
English poetry. Which is kind of weird if you're an engineer, but fine by me, I guess. So what's left? Oh, yeah.
Justify my existence at this institution no biggie. Just
give me a few seconds here.

"communications/pre-rabbinical." Let's see what department they send that one to.
Here's a good question. "What do you wish to learn in the next two years?" they ask.
What indeed. Truly, it's questions like this that fill me with self-understanding. Having
carefully considered the matter, I have concluded that, truth be told, I already know
almost everything worth knowing, and also some Unix. Really, I can think of about four
things that I hope to get out of the next two years, intellect-wise: 1) how to write my
columns well before deadline and not to look like a fat elf in columnist photographs, 2)
why a cappella is popular among college students or anyone else, 3) why people are so
mean to each other all the time and how to make them stop, and 4) who killed Biggie?
Allotting these at one per semester, I think you'll agree: I'll be learning real good.
Learning really well, one would say if one were a grammar dork.
And the interrogation continues. "Are you planning to apply to graduate/professional
school?" No. Or, at least, if I am, I'd rather not think about it. Shut up, all you chuckling
seniors. Allow me my delusions. "Do you plan to study abroad and why?" I don't really

But seriously, folks. Yes. Yes, I am. Because
other places are sometimes better than here. That's why. You can write that down if you
want to. "What choices have you made between depth and breadth?" Depth, breadth.

"Take the applicant away."
At least, that's what the sophomore paper application process will be like thirty years
from now, when the purges start. At the moment, the damn thing is, at long last, handed
in. Thankfully for all involved, the real thing had more declarative sentences and fewer
exclamation points than this little fantasia, but the gist was about the same. Somehow, on
this fine day, having declared a major (philosophy and math, for those of y'all keeping
score), I feel like an initiated Zulu warrior, or at least a Bar Mitzvah'ed 13-year-old from
Long Island. Today I am, academically, a man. Or, as Blink-182 have been singing in my

Style Studies: hats, heels and hair
Our resident queen of chic dispenses much-needed fashion advice in this deluxe edition
Dahlings!

It has been suggested that in my attempt to promote good, informed fashion, I disparage you who are already suffering. Rather than give you the advice that you need in a nurturing manner (as in, "very original, doll, but it might possibly be a good idea to maybe
lose the fanny pack"), you say I viciously cut you down, mock you before all of the campus and then revive your mistakes in later columns for continued derision (fanny packs!).
Well, dahlings, I know you are all very, very
oppressed, but you are still accountable for your actions,
including dressing yourself. Nevertheless, I will attempt
to appreciate you more for what you are.
So, you hopeless, unstylish academics, I humbly ask
for your assistance.
I have this idea, dolls, that you bookworm types would
start to care about style if it were made into
an
yes!
academic subject. Style Studies: the next frontier in the
critical investigation of identity. What, pray tell, says
more about us than the clothes we wear?
Now, dahlings, get to work. There are essays to be
written ("Your Mom Said to Always Wear Your Hat:
Headwear As a Return to the Womb" and
"Interstices/Inner Stitches: When Boxers and Briefs

Dear Heel, Toe,
Thank you, dahling, thank you! This campus has been screaming for a high-heel explosion for years! Swarthmore's contained area (where else can you exist for days within a
square one quarter-mile on each side?) means that an elevated style cat never needs to
worry about tiring out her paws.
The college's green lawns, kept well-groomed in what is undoubtedly the sole contribution of the Scott Arboretum minions to the fashion good, mean that stilettoed strutters
are not denied the privilege of communing with nature. And Swarthmore's wonderfully
redundant asphalt paths, courtesy of those wild Quakers, who believed in coed education
but not in coed walking, mean that the heel-wearer in a hurry can get to class without
soiling her tips.
Yes, it's time to reclaim heels from the cross-dressing domain to which they have been
relegated on this campus. (Those size 13 white Goodwill pumps were sexy, though, doll.)
Now, feminist theorists traditionally argue that high heels are an instrument of
oppression
an attempt to distance women from the ground and the gritty business of
the earth and turn us into useless sex objects.
But these theorists are conniving double agents, slaves to the very patriarchy they

claim to subvert. When the situation is approached logically, it becomes clear that denying us high heels is the real act of oppression.
Studies have shown that tall people tend to have more success in the workplace. And
which is the taller gender? Aha. The glass ceiling would not exist, dahling, if we could
reach it without standing on a stool.

Dear Perplexed:
You are not alone in your confusion, doll. The
visor is a tasteless trend, but, at a school where a good
portion of the population traipses around in tapered
jeans, very few fashion moves are surprising. And this particular look, unlike so many of the apparel no-nos in these
parts, does have some basis in the outside world.
Now, where did the visor come from, dahling? Most fashion
theorists agree that it originated among the tennis set. Upper-

country club class.
The visor was then appropriated by disaffected urban youth. It
was, in this stage, imbued with a brilliant irony, doll. The kids
even took the visor to daring new places. In a bold Marxist move,
they turned the class structure on its head by wearing their
visors upside down. Sometimes they rejected both Marxism and
capitalism, anarchically sporting the sideways visor.
Then the visor became (gasp!) popular. We thus have it in

its current form: mainstream freshboy uniform. The visor
has become, like so many of us, uninterestingly middle class.
Or is it? After all, doll, what other piece of headwear is

both phallic and yonic, both positive space and negative

clearly a symbol for androgyny and a brave rejection of the

cruel artificial binaries that divide our culture.

mullet
that übiquitous middle-America-meetsbutch-America hairstyle is not so easily dismissed.
(A mullet is any hairstyle in which the hair on the
back of the head is at least three times as long as the
hair on the front and top, according to www.mulletjunky.com.) Just this month the style bible
(Vogue) featured a New York stylist, an iibercool and
aloof hair god, who cuts, yes, mullets for his iibercool and aloof clients. Now, said stylist does not himself sport a mullet, so his enthusiasm is somewhat
suspect. But Vogue is not to be taken lightly.
Could the mullet be the next style-sawy fusion of
opposites? Is the boundary between short and long
the next one to go? Will living in liminal space come
to mean eradicating this one last sacred binary?
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
In the spirit of postmodern discourse, I must admit
the perspective from which I approach the mullet
or, as they say in the po-mo world, discuss my positionality. Dahling reader,
question
please don’t hold it against me. OK: My father has a mullet. A flowing, graying, honest-togoodness mullet.
So there you have it: the encounter with the other results in exposure of the self.

New plan to give staff economic flexibility
From LIVING WAGE, pg. 3
wage than the $l3 pushed by the mostly student-driven campaign. "The lowest wage could probably be higher," she said.
"[The CRC was] looking to find a number coupled with benefits that would create a livable wage for our employees.
Right now, the biggest problem is that those working off of
the lowest wage cannot possibly support health care for

more than one person."
In addition to wage issues, a major part of the CRC recommendations are based on more flexibility in health and
retirement benefits. James explained that, under the current
system, staffmembers do not receive equal coverage. "We've
got this way of managing benefits called a Benefit Bank," she
said. "It is a set amount of money that every full time
employee gets," regardless of whether or not he or she is
married and supporting a family.
James explained that this leads to a dilemma when
employees supporting only themselves earn more money.
"No other place that I know of gives you extra money for
being a single employee," she said. "The recommendation is
to freeze the benefit bank at the amount it is at now and then
to put any future increases into subsidizing spouse and children coverage."

This new plan, according to James, will help ease the
financial burden of providing health care to an entire family
while addressing the extra money that single employees
receive out of the benefit bank. This way, no one will make
less money, and those who were not receiving enough money
for family health care coverage will slowly reach a position

of equality.
Besides health coverage, the CRC plan will allow employees more flexibility in allocating funds toward their retire-

ment plans. Currently, according to Equal Opportunity
Officer Sharmaine LaMar, there is a mandatory 2.5 percent
of an employee's first $20,000 in wages that goes into a pension plan. The college provides the employee with another 7.5
percent, for a total of ten percent.

"I don't see the living wage
movement and us on opposite sides.
I see us on a very similar side."
Melanie Young, CRC Chair

pension," she said. Now, that staff member will be able to put
the money toward a possible college fund for his child
instead of a forced contribution towards a pension plan.
In all, James said, the proposed wage encourages upward
mobility in a competitive working environment. She
explained that a staff member making $l3 an hour would not
be inclined to seek out a better job. "If we're doing a good job
as an employer, we are enabling people to move up within
the college job structure or allowing for them to get better
jobs outside of the college," she said. "We do not want to
solidify these entry-level jobs. We want to encourage creation of a structure that promotes cross-training so that
employees have skills in more than on area."
But Blair took issue with the idea that workers in lowwage jobs can easily improve their education. "Economic
realities often restrict educational options," he said. "When
a worker needs to work
a second job to make ends meet,
that doesn't leave much 'choice' for taking night classes."
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and community relations, said the Board of Managers approved the
compensation goals. He also said that most members' views
regarding staff compensation differ from the campaign.
"It's much more complicated than a reductionist view of
a living wage might suggest," he said, emphasizing that benefits outside an hourly wage were key.
Young stressed the two groups were not enemies. "I don't
see the living wage movement and us on opposite sides," she
said. "I see us on a very similar side. Our concerns are very
...

The new plan will eliminate the mandatory contribution
on the employee's side. The college's share of the pension
plan will increase to eight percent. "The 2.5 percent goes
back into the employee's paycheck," LaMar said. "They will
now have the opportunity to choose what they want to do
with this money."
James discussed the potential benefits this new flexibility will provide for staff members. "A 25-year-old employee
with small children is more concerned with securing the
financial means to provide a solid education for his children
and is not really thinking at that point about a retirement

similar."

Young 'mothers jumpstart spring season
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
With many veteran players
graduated,
abroad
or
the
Warmothers women's Ultimate
Frisbee team began the season
with a fresh crop of new players.
Recent

graduates

include

standouts Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol
and Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol, last
year's recipient of the Callahan
Award, the nationwide most valuable collegiate player honor. This
spring, the team will also be without veterans Sarah Stanton 'O3
and Sanya Carleyolsen 'O3. As a
result, the play of newcomers and
a small core of veterans will
determine how the Warmothers
fare this season.
The former group includes
Ingrid Kaszas 'O3, Courtney
Caughey 'O4 and Erin DwyerFraser 'O5, who were instrumental in the Warmothers' 3-4 showing at last weekend's at the Rocky
VII Tournament in Philadelphia,
hosted by the University of
Pennsylvania Ultimate teams.
"The rookies are so good," veteran Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 said.
"In particular, Courtney Caughey
had layouts all over the place.

Ingrid

was also amazing."

Marah Gotcsik 'O2 added that
the rookies "did a truly amazing
job, impressing everyone with
how quickly they picked up, and
excelled at, the game."
The Warmothers finished
tenth in a field of 20 teams at
Rocky VII. Given that more than
half of the 11 Swarthmore players
were new to the team or hadn't
played in over a year, the results

play, she said, is indicative of the
promising athletic talent that

those newcomers have.
The Warmothers also suffered
a pair of narrow defeats to foes
Johns Hopkins (7-9) and UPenn (510).
Laurenza
thought
the
Warmothers could have won both
games. She attributed the losses
to fatigue, noting that they played
the games on the heels of other

grueling matches.

Gotcsik summed up the weekend optimistically.
"The Warmothers did a fantastic job in their first tournament of
the season," she said. "This week
will give the team a great opportunity to grow together and
become more cohesive, and we
have a lot of potential and a lot of
room for improvement."

The team will spend spring
break training in Port St. Joe,
Fla., with two tournaments in
Georgia.

This weekend, the team will
be in Savannah for the First
Wave tournament. The following

pleased the team's veteran leadership. "We were actually surprised
at how we did, because the teams
in our region are really good,"
Laurenza said.

"The scores from the tournament are deceptive, because, for
the most part, the games were
much closer than that," Gotcsik
said.

The squad soundly defeated
Syracuse and Brown, 11-5 and 130, respectively. The team played
its best against Cornell and
Williams, despite losing both
matches (6-12 to Williams and 5-13
to Cornell), Bell said.
Throughout the tournament,
"we couldn't really play offense,"
Bell said. "But our defense was
pretty phenomenal." She believes
that better offense will come as
the newcomers get more experience. The top-notch defensive

Shortstop Wes Sconce bats for the Garnet. A significant contributor
in yesterday’s season- and home-opener, Sconce “almost hit a

8 innings. The team will head to Homestead, Fla., for a whopping
seven games over spring break.

Ducks scramble Garnet offense
BY JUSTIN KANE
jkanel@swarthmore.edu
What a difference a game makes. After destroying
Manhattanville 11-2 Saturday by spreading the offensive
load, the Garnet Tide men's lacrosse team found itself on
the receiving end of an 11-5 beating by Stevens Institute of

Technology Wednesday afternoon.

The Ducks of Stevens Tech controlled the game by disrupting the Garnet offense and forcing turnovers. Early
offensive frustration kept the Garnet Tide from effectively
setting up their offense, a problem that plagued the team
throughout the game.
Without many chances to settle into an offensive
rhythm, the Tide resorted to what head coach Pat Gress
called "undisciplined" play. Midfielders and attackers
repeatedly dodged into double teams rather than quickly
passing the ball around the attacking third to stretch the
defense, allowing the physical Stevens defense to create
turnovers. "We reverted to last year's bad habit of pressing
too much," captain Blake Atkins 'O2 said. "It turned the
game into a ground ball battle."
Swarthmore turnovers led to goals for Stevens Tech. By
the end of the first period, the Ducks had raced out to 4-0
lead on the strength of transition scoring. Though the Tide
settled down in the second period and managed to net
three goals, the Ducks' midfield had already begun to put
the game away, led by three first-half goals from Mike
Baumbach and two from Erik Reckdenwald.

The Swarthmore attack didn't click for the first three

periods, and what little offense the Tide could generate
came through the midfield. Midfielders Atkins, John
Cleaver 'O4 and John Murphy 'O3 each notched a goal in the
second period, but it wasn't until attacker Joseph
DeSimone 'O4 netted two goals late in the fourth quarter
that the Swarthmore attackers could claim any scoring.

The Garnet Tide defense also played unevenly, rarely
stepping up to make the kind of plays needed to contain
Stevens Tech. With the ball in the Tide's defensive third
often, the defenders were under near-constant pressure.
Even when Swarthmore was a man up, the offense had
trouble converting. Stevens Tech's physical play resulted
in 10 penalties for the Ducks, but Swarthmore had difficulty capitalizing on the advantage.
Despite his evident frustration at his team's failure to
set up the offense, Gress said the loss was a "good learning

experience."
"We find out what we're made of when we lose like this,"
Gress said. He said that the practices between now and
Saturday's game against Goucher would likely be spent
emphasizing the basics necessary for setting up the offense
catching, throwing and "the rules of the offense."
Gress's frustration was understandable, considering

how well the Garnet Tide's offense was firing Saturday
against Manhattanville. Seven players scored for the Tide,
led by Atkins's two goals and four assists.
"Our defense created a lot of turnovers," Gress said, "so
our attack had more possessions." Swarthmore didn't
waste its opportunities to set up its offense, and Murphy,
Jeff Donlea 'O5 and Pat Friel 'O3 each scored twice. Most
importantly, the team moved the ball well and executed the
offensive plan.
With one eye to the team's success against
Manhattanville and the other looking forward to
Saturday's matchup at Goucher, Atkins said that the
team's dismal performance against Stevens Tech was "just
one little hiccup" and that the team would get back to the
basics by the end of the week.
"Those guys muscled us out
whether it was our size
or our speed, I don't know what happened," Atkins said.
"Maybe it's our toughness. We're not going to out skill
teams, so we have to outwork them."

Depth and talent lead
Garnet to 6-1 start
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

Whoever said tennis players don't like to trash talk? After the Garnet Tide handed
the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Flames an embarrassing lopsided 4-1 loss, a
UIC player remarked, "We got robbed by a little old lady pushing a shopping cart."
The passing remark underscored the attitudes of many NCAA Division I teams that
compete with the Swarthmore men's tennis team, winners of five straight matches

against Div. I opponents. According to team captain John Thomas 'O2, most Div. I teams
don't realize the strength of the Garnet Tide. "We have an advantage, because most DI
teams expect to blow us out of the water," Thomas said. "We like showing them that we

can compete."

Despite the caliber of Swarthmore tennis, the squad shares very little in common
with other Div. I teams. For one, 27-year head coach Mike Mullan makes decisions
about the team's top seeds based on seniority rather than direct match play. "In my
four years here, we've never had a freshman play higher than the fourth seed," Thomas
said. Other college coaches decide on seeds by instituting challenge matches during
practices. Mullan, however, prefers to run his team differently. "It eliminates the animosity between teammates," Thomas said, "because we're not competing against each

other in practice."

"Everyone knows their place on the team," third seed Jayson Yost 'O3 agreed.
Although upperclassmen Thomas, Justin Singer 'O3, and Yost hold the top three
seeds, respectively, underclassmen hold the bottom three. Since each of the six singles
victory counts as one point, the play of all six starters is equally important. "The four,
five and six seeds are crucial for us," Singer said, "Our strength is in our depth."
With the improved play of Frank Visciano 'O3 and Ben Rae 'O3, the four and five seeds
are in sure hands. "Ben has really improved his game," Thomas said. "I didn't expect us
to pick up this many wins, but Frank and Ben have really pulled through for us."
Mullan has not decided who will play in the final starting spot. Contenders Aaron
Rubin 'O4 and Justin Durand 'O5 insist there is no rivalry. "A lot of teams, especially in DI,
have only a few talented players," Singer said. "We have talent at every position."

Notes

The final two points of the match constituted highway robbery. In the only doubles match, Rae blooped a return from a powerful first serve. The ball lobbed over the
head of the doubles opponent at the net and managed to land within the court for the
one point lead. On the very next play, Rae hit a serve that struck the net and fell barely into the service court. Since Div. I and 111 do not allow "lets," the serve technically
counted as an ace and gave doubles partners Rae and Michael Noreika 'O4 their victory in the tiebreaker and the match.
The teams played an abbreviated five-match format to accommodate the schedule
of UIC, who played St. Joseph's later in the day at the Mullan Center. UIC knocked off
St. Joe's 3-2; Swarthmore defeated St. Joe's 3-2 on Feb. 9.

Women fall in ECAC semis to end season
Heather Kile receives Jostens Trophy
for on-court and off-court ability, service
BY BRENDAN KARCH

bkarchl@swarthmore.edu
It was only fitting that in the final game
of the women's basketball season, the team's
two co-stars
Heather Kile 'O2 and Katie
Robinson 'O4 put on nearly identical performances.
Kile and Robinson each scored 20 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds, but their efforts
were not enough as Swarthmore bowed out
of the Eastern College Athletic Conference
(ECAC) semifinals with a 63-56 loss to
DeSales University last Saturday.
The loss came as a disappointing coda to

an otherwise successful season. The team
finished with a 21-8 record, notching its second consecutive 20-win season.
The season was especially momentous
for Robinson and Kile. The two both broke
the single-season Centennial Conference
scoring record, with Robinson scoring 542
points and Kile scoring 540.
Robinson
was named Centennial
Conference Player of the Year, and Kile
recently won the Jostens Trophy, awarded
to the Division 111 women's basketball player who best demonstrates basketball ability,
classroom ability and community service.
Kile finished her Swarthmore basketball
career as the leading scorer in conference history with 1,965 points and second in rebounding with 1,263 boards. She is a computer science major and spent this past summer
authoring Web pages for a non-profit company as part of Swarthmore's summer of service program.
Kile's final game exemplified her style of
play. She played tough, physical basketball
driving in the lane
her trademark style
for baskets. "They couldn't stop her," head
coach Adrienne Shibles said. Kile sat out
only three minutes in the game, despite
injuring her knee in the second half.
Swarthmore was up 46-34 with 9:12
remaining against DeSales but watched the
lead disappear with a 21-5 Bulldogs run.
Swarthmore brought the game within one,
55-54, with 1:24 remaining, but DeSales went
8-for-8 from the free throw line in the final
minute to seal the victory.
The Bulldogs shot 14-for-14 from the line

on the game but managed only 36 percent
shooting from the floor. Swarthmore shot
over 44 percent from the field but got off
nine fewer shots.

Swarthmore committed 29 turnovers, 11
more than DeSales. Many of the Garnet's
turnovers came at the hands of the Bulldogs'
relentless full-court press. DeSales had an
advantage in team speed and quickness over
Swarthmore and used two different press

formations to confound the Garnet.
According to Shibles, the team collapsed
under the press at just the wrong time
the
end of the game. "We knew that was going to
be a problem going in," she said.
Swarthmore also had trouble offensively
in the final minutes, just as DeSales's
offense picked up steam. The Bulldogs were
having trouble running a set offense for
most of the game because of the strong mix
of one-on-one and zone defense the Garnet
used. DeSales relied on turnovers and a runand-gun offense for points during most of
the game. But the Bulldogs started to find a
groove against the Swarthmore's defense

just in time to pull off a last-minute run.

"I felt like we came into the game know-

ing what we had to do," Shibles said, "and
[the team] did the things
for 35 minutes
they needed to do."
DeSales went on to win the ECAC tournament with a 79-68 overtime victory over
Franklin & Marshall College on Sunday.
Swarthmore split its season series against
F&M, beating the Diplomats in the first
round of the Centennial Conference playoffs.
"I think we had a chance to win it all,"
...

Shibles said.

That feeling, combined with the sudden
realization that the team's four seniors
would not suit up again, created an emotional post-game atmosphere. There were
tears after the game, remembered Shibles.
"Definitely, in the locker room, everyone
was pretty emotional," Kile said.
If anything, the emotion reflected a team
that was able to will its way to 21 wins with
an incredible balance of star talent and team
play. "This was a team of overachievers,"
Shibles said. "If you told me before the season that we were going to have 21 wins, I
would have said, 'No way.'
"

last Wednesday. Kile and the Garnet dispatched Delaware Valley 74-59 but couldn't
hang on against eventual ECAC champions DeSales University, falling 63-56.

Evil Buzzards get
swarmed by Penn
BY KATHRYN JANTZ

The men's rugby team played a stellar game against local rival University of
Pennsylvania this Saturday, though the team lost 22-5.
The self-named Evil Buzzards of Swarthmore College compete as a Division
111 team in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union, while Penn plays at the
Division I level. Though the game was a tally in the loss column, the team felt
that the game was ultimately a triumph, as many Swat ruggers are rookies that
rose to the challenge. Playing a team with as much depth and experience as

Fullback Ted Chan splits through two defenders in Saturday's game against the University of
Pennsylvania. Chan led the team in tackles in a losing effort. The Evil Buzzards lost 22-5.

Penn was no easy task.
"There were a lot of inexperienced people on the team, and yet we still played
some very good rugby," Jon Fombonne 'O5 said. "I feel that, with the season progressing and a few more games under our belt, we will be able to get to a position where we have a strong squad at all positions. Penn was a stronger side, but
we still showed that we have potential to be one of the best Division 111 teams in
the area."
Because this was an early season game, the teams played with unlimited substitutions, unlike a regulation game, in which players cannot be substituted
after leaving the game.
Loose tackling was an issue for Swarthmore in the beginning of the game,
and Swarthmore conceded an early try to Penn's A side. But the team regrouped
and held its own. Hooker Manu Pradhan 'O3 and prop John Turcik 'O5 provided
fantastic rucking in addition to tough tackling. The back line featured Axel Neff
'O2, a former linebacker with a strong running and hitting game, and fullback
Ted Chan 'O2, who had the most tackles and provided a strong line of defense
against the quick Penn men.
The forwards worked well enough to stop the Penn offense a number of
times. Erik Munroe 'O4, a rookie winger, scored Swarthmore's sole try by using
his speed to beat the entire Penn side to the try zone.
The game was rough for the Evil Buzzards, as two players suffered injuries
serious enough to sideline them for the rest of the game. Brandon Carver 'O4
rolled his ankle toward the end of the first half, and Tim Lang 'O4 sprained his
shoulder badly in the first 20 minutes of the game. The loss of Carver and Lang,
the two props on the team, was a big blow, given that no one else had experience
playing the position. Due to injuries, most players were not playing their usual
positions by the end of the game. However, Swat's players did a great job stepping in to fill the holes.
For coach Fred Gruhler, the game was a chance to determine the team's
weaknesses and to give some experience to the many novices on the team.
"It was a really good learning experience. I made mistakes that taught me
how I should be playing," Munroe said. "I know the team as a whole will play
better in our next game as a result. It was a lot of fun, too."
The men hope to improve against Franklin & Marshall, whom they will play
at 1 p.m. on Saturday, March 23.
