Eric Johnson 'O3 was killed Aug. 20

Student's child pornography
trial gets underway next week
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu
Ivan Boothe 'O4 will face trial Sept.
9 for allegedly possessing and disseminating 500 child pornography images,
after pleading not guilty at his preliminary hearing last May.
Charges at that hearing included
one count of criminal attempt to corrupt minors, one count of criminal
attempt to unlawfully contact or communicate with a minor, six counts of
sexual abuse of children through the
dissemination of child pornography,
500 counts of sexual abuse of children
through the possession of child
pornography and 506 counts of criminal use of a communication facility,
according to the arrest warrant.
Maximum jail time based on those
charges is 45 years in prison.
After that hearing, charges were
reduced to one count each of criminal
attempt, sexual abuse of children and
criminal misuse of a communications
facility.
Delaware County Court Justice
Charles Keeler will hear the trial;
Assistant District Attorney John
Reilly will prosecute the case.
The trial's outcome will have significant impact on what action, if any,
the college takes against Boothe. Dean
of the College Bob Gross said the
administration, at present, did not
plan to deny him the right to return to
Swarthmore, but added that the outcome of his trial would impact any

THE PHOENIX

move the college might make.
"At this moment we don't have any
college judicial action planned," he
said. "The process would have to
work itself out." Gross added that if
Boothe's sentence did not include jail
time, the college would probably not
block his return.
Both Gross and Dean of Student
Life Tedd Goundie described Boothe's

actions as "reprehensible" last May,
but said they were "confident" he had
stopped his illegal activities after his
arrest. Gross insisted he was not a
threat to anyone.

According to Reilly and sources
close to Boothe, Boothe's lawyer,
Joseph Fiorvanti, plans to challenge
the constitutionality of the statute
under which Boothe is charged and
the district attorney's office hopes to

prosecute. But those same sources
added that the challenge's aim was to
induce the prosecution to offer some
sort of settlement deal, and that the
challenge would not go forward if
such a deal were offered.
But if the challenge does go forward, Reilly added, a pretrial hearing
would take place before Keeler; Reilly
did not indicate whether such a challenge would delay the trial.
Lieutenant David Peifer of the
national Internet Crimes Against
Children task force, the officer who

arrested Boothe last May,

compared

harboring child pornography images
to possessing cocaine. "It's illegal having even one picture," he said at the

time. "Each time a picture is viewed

or sent out that child is reoffended
again."
The

images

allegedly included

depictions of both prepubescent and
pubescent minors "engaged in sexual
acts or poses," according to the arrest
warrant.

and editor, is taking the fall semester
off, and tentatively plans to return for
the spring semester. He has continued

A new orientation
greets Class of '06
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kdoungll@swarthmore.edu
In the week before the majority of returning students arrived on campus, this year's freshman class
participated in an orientation significantly different
from those of past years.
This year's Orientation Committee organized the
week around an "Olympic games" theme, a move aimed
at increasing participation in CA-group events. Other
changes include new tours for parents and improved
enforcement of the alcohol policy.
The 375-member Class of 'O6 was, as always, divided
into groups, each led by a Campus Advisor (CA). But to
earn points for their CA groups in the "Olympics,"
freshmen for the first time competed against each other
in various events, such as anagram-solving, 4-square,
pie-eating and three-legged races while their fellow CA
group members cheered for them. Freshmen also
earned points for their CA groups by going to orientation activities such as the library and computer orientations, swim test, and trust walk.

"The 'fake' competitive atmosphere helped CA

groups bond," CA Brian Nolan 'O5 said.
OC member Nick Malakhow 'O5 said that the

psychological therapy he began last
May, sources close to him said.

The prosecution has signaled to
Fiorvanti that continuing this therapy could mean Boothe will not face
any jail time, sources close to Boothe
said. Instead, he would be put on probation or be asked to fulfill a certain
amount of community service as part
of his sentence.
"I am currently in counseling and

have been for more than a month for
this problem that I have," Boothe stated to The Phoenix last May. "I hope
that in time, I am able to correct this
part of me that I am not, nor have I
ever been, happy about."
Authorities obtained a search warrant for Boothe's personal computer

after he allegedly had a sexual conversation with Detective James
McLaughlin of the Keene, N.H. police
department, who was posing as a 15year-old male. Boothe, when questioned by authorities later, admitted
to having the conversation, as well as
to possessing the illegal images.

New IC director
gets settled in
After NYU, Zapata plans to
learn and listen first year
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarttimore.edu

Just hired this past summer as Swarthmore's new
Intercultural Center (IC) Director, Rafael Zapata is still
moving into his office, and he's already advising several students. But he hasn't let the stress get to him. Miles
Davis's "Kind of Blue" plays softly on the stereo and
Zapata seems thoughtful and relaxed, trying to absorb
his new surroundings. "I'm mellow," he says. "I'm laid

back."
Before he was hired to the IC director position,
Zapata was living in Manhattan, where he was born
and raised. There he served as the Assistant Director of
the Office for African-American, Latino and AsianAmerican Student Services at New York University. At
NYU, Zapata was involved in leadership development
and formal and informal counseling, mostly for students of color. He helped organize forums concerning
social justice, environmental justice, the prison-indus-

trial complex and patriarchy.
"It was great to bring students of different backgrounds into one room," Zapata said. "That's where the
real dialogue can start."
"OASIS," the name of Zapata's office at NYU, was
also "a metaphor for what we did there," which included representing and counseling students, as well as trying to create coalitions between various student organizations. "People get to know you, they gain trust, and
you form a relationship," he said.

Portions of the new science center will open this year; aside from academic facilities, the building will feature gardens, steps leading down to Crum Creek and a new coffee bar lounge to appeal to natural science majors.

Construction continues from
science center to track field
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

With hills of red dirt and yellow construction equipment seemingly a permanent addition to the campus,
Swarthmore is beginning to resemble a construction site
more than a liberal arts college.
Students looking to run on the track or walk from
DuPont to Trotter have hit detours due to extensive construction projects, but along with these slight inconveniences and disrupted views come a lot of renovations, all of
which are aimed to improve and expand the campus.
According to Vice President for Administration Larry
Schall, the construction is going as planned. "The science
center project is on schedule and on budget," he said.
"Parts of it will actually start to open this year."
The new building will house math, biology, physics,
chemistry and computer science classrooms and laboratories. Also adding to the new building's appeal are gardens,
steps down to the Crum Creek and a new coffee bar lounge
designed by Margaret Helfand '69, who also designed the
Kohlberg Commons space.
One natural science major who did not wish to be identified complained that the new building will "look like a
dungeon [with] dark hallways and grey stones" and wonders if anyone will use the new coffee bar with Kohlberg's
so close. Nonetheless, having tested the new chairs picked
for the building, he is sure the classrooms will be an
improvement.
Because the building will house the natural sciences
departments, workers have kept the surrounding environment in mind while planning its construction. Material
from parts of the demolished structure have been recycled
into the interior and exterior of the new building, and the
roof has been designed to keep rain-water flow-offfrom disrupting the Crum Woods' fragile ecosystem.
The next big building project will be the new residence

4

hall between Mertz and the SEPTA station. The architectural plans are close to completion, but the start date for
construction is up in the air, dependent on new gifts to the
college's fundraising campaign, Schall explained.
Groundbreaking could be as soon as next March. This is
unlikely, however, considering the current economic
decline and its effect on people's ability to donate money
(See "Meaning campaign raises more than $lOO million").
Many smaller renovations have been completed this
summer. The first floor and parts of the second floor of
Beardsley were renovated. These plans included a new
space for the ITS help desk and Beardsley public computer
area. A new storage space for the engineering and psychology departments was added to Papazian. Underground
utility lines have been put in place across campus, and

sprinklers were installed in the Dana, Hallowell and Mary
Lyon dorms.
Although rumors of the sprinklers' hypersensitivity
have caused students to worry about their possessions
being soaked by a false alarm, the new fire deterrents will

make the dorms safer places in which to live.
Additional renovations to Mary Lyon have changed the
dynamic of student housing. Students who were once upset
to find themselves in the Mary Lyon basement are now
pleased with their newly remodeled hall. Basement resident Lillian Ray 'O5 "adores" her single, which she
describes as a "nice size," and which has been carpeted
and painted a "cheerier yellow." The dark cage of wires has
been walled off (to the disappointment of those who liked
the former prison aesthetic of basement life), and a lounge
with a couch and foosball table all create a feeling of

community. Although there are still a few exposed
pipes in rooms, Ray happily uses them to hang her calen-

dars.
And for those missing their runs on the outdoor track,
which is currently dug up, the new track and artificial surface should be finished by the end of the first semester.
September 5, 2002

So why would someone leave a job where he was getting paid to do work he enjoyed in the hometown he
loves? Zapata hadn't planned on it. "I wasn't on the
market," he explains, "until I got a call from a friend at
Penn who told me about the opening. It was a great
opportunity."

"I don't necessarily think a center
like this is only necessary when
there is conflict. Understanding can
come but you can't assume it."
New IC Director

Rafael Zapata
Zapata was drawn to the educational values for
which Swarthmore is known. "I like the philosophy
that education is not solely a means to an end, but an
end to itself," he said. "Students here are taught to
become proactive agents of social change." He also
liked the vibe. "I felt a lot of positive energy from the
students. It's non-corporate, no suits and ties. It works
with my personality."
Zapata's plans for Swarthmore are not yet specific.
"Being new is a challenge," he said. "This first year I'm
going to do a lot of learning and a lot of listening, and
I'm going to start giving students a sense of what I want
to accomplish. My plan is to engage students. I want the
students to feel comfortable here; acting as an assistant
dean is also part of my job."
Despite Swarthmore's reputation for tolerance,
Zapata feels there is still important work to be done
here. "Our identities are rooted in our communities,"
he said. "I don't necessarily think a center like this is
only necessary when there is conflict. Understanding
can come but you can't assume it. The risk in being who
you are is still widespread and you can't assume otherwise. There's still a need for a place like the
Intercultural Center where students can feels safe."
Zapata is looking forward to his first year at
Swarthmore. "I want everyone to know that I'm really
glad to be here," he said. "There are very few jobs I
would have left New York for."

McCabe loses its friendly nighttime face

decade,
nearly
For
a
Swarthmore students trudging
through the doors of McCabe in
the evenings were treated to a
friendly smile and a daily Far
Side cartoon courtesy of receptionist Ben Criscuolo. Now his
former desk by the library
entrance features a simple yet
touching memorial to the man
who loved and was well loved by
so many students.
Benedict A. Criscuolo, 58, died
on May 28, at his house in
Glenolden, Penn. He suffered

from diabetes and high blood
pressure for nearly a year and a
half and had been on unofficial
leave from the college since
February. He had previously
taken medical leaves for mobility
problems as well. In spite of this,
his death came as a surprise to
his family, friends and colleagues.
"He was wonderful," College
Librarian Peggy Seiden said. "He
was very sweet and eager to
learn, and he loved talking to students."
As a young man, Ben attended
St. Joseph's University for a year
before leaving to care for ill parents. He was a naval yeoman during the 1960s and spent several
months in Cuba during the time
of the Missile Crisis. After returning to the United States, he was
invited to the White House, where
he met his idol, President John F.

Kennedy. An avid sports enthusi-

ast, Ben was also a semi-professional baseball pitcher until an
injury he suffered in a football
game prevented him from pursuing professional athletic opportu-

nities.
At McCabe, Ben worked as a
receptionist. He was stationed at
the front entrance, meeting and
greeting students seven hours a
night, five nights a week. Before
the current security systems were

installed, he was required to
search student bags to make sure
that books were not stolen from
the library. While many students
did not appreciate this invasion of
privacy, especially from other
receptionists, most of them got
along very well with Ben.
In addition to putting in full
time hours at McCabe, Ben
worked as a security guard at
Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital in Philadelphia during
the day. The income from the two
jobs covered college tuition for
his sons, of whom he often spoke
fondly. Michael, his youngest son,
held a part time job sorting mail
in McCabe several years ago
while attending nearby Neumann
College.
"He was so proud of his boys,"
said Mary Ann Wood, evening circulation supervisor at McCabe.
"That's why he could relate so
well to the students."
Ben was dedicated to making
the library entrance a warm and
welcoming place. Every year

'Meaning' campaign raises more than $100 million
With less certain economic times ahead, response to last year's annual appeal biggest ever
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu
Even as a slowing economy pushes national budget projections into the red, projections for Swarthmore's all-time
largest fundraising campaign remain generally rosy.
According to Ruth Krakower, Director of Alumni and
Gift Records, contributors gave or pledged $112,497,000
(approximately half the drive's goal of $230 million) by the
end of August. With the campaign entering its third of
seven planned years, the Office of Development regards it

as ahead of schedule.
Maurice Eldridge '6l, Vice-President for College and
Community Relations and executive assistant to President
Al Bloom, describes the campaign as in "quite good shape
with the understanding that the year ahead will be more
difficult." The current economic slowdown has led some
donors to delay pledge payments and others, especially
those donors considering donating stock, to postpone their
contributions altogether.
The fundraisers' job is also complicated by the fact that
many of the alumni with closest ties to the school gave
their donations during the silent phase of the campaign,
the year before the drive's public launch last fall. Now,
fundraisers face the task of identifying and cultivating
individuals with less of a history of giving.
At this point, the campaign is targeting donors capable
of giving large gifts, people whose ability to give is usually
only slightly effected by the economy, Eldridge said,
adding that the drive's small gift phase will come towards
the end. Meanwhile, the focus is on building relationships.
"Being Swarthmore alums, these are analytic people
who think critically and ask questions," he said.
Swarthmore alumni and development officers have to
answer these questions and explain how the campaign
addresses each individual's priorities.
Most alumni, Eldridge added, want to give to students

THE PHOENIX

directly, and almost all want to contribute to financial aid
funds. The challenge for him and other fund-raisers is to
convince alumni that building a new science center and a
new dorm is also important to students' well-being
(Parrish Hall renovations typically strike more of a chord
with alumni, who have their own memories of time spent
in Parrish).
Director of Development John Malcolm said his office
was well up to the task ahead, describing it as "well-positioned for staff' after expanding last year. Still, he admitted, "philanthropy does follow the market." Contributions
are needed more urgently than ever because the economic
slow-down has shrunk the endowment. His office is trying
to address contributors' financial concerns by helping
them restructure their pledge payments.

"Many organizations are dealing
with issues reactively. Swarthmore
has a long term impact on
social
justice writ large."
...

Director of Development
John Malcolm
To persuade more alumni to donate, the college will
hold a series of events around the country. The first and
largest was held in New York last February and was followed by events in Washington, DC, San Francisco and
Chicago. This year, gatherings are planned for
Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Boston.
The Philadelphia event, which will be held on Saturday,
Sept. 2L is timed to coincide with the fall Board of
Managers meeting. Members of the board will participate

September 5, 2002

in the program, which will take place at the Kimmel
Center for the Performing Arts in Center City and include
student musical performances as well as a presentation by

President Bloom.

The "Meaning of Swarthmore" Campaign is highly
ambitious in that, unlike the campaign which raised the
money to build Kohlberg Hall, it is a comprehensive,
rather than a targeted, campaign. Thus, while fundraising
for high profile building projects, the college is also seeking to increase donations to the annual and parents' funds
by $5 million and to increase the endowment by $203 million.
Interest from the new endowment funds will pay for
financial aid, expansion of the honors program, new academic initiatives, programs to increase the diversity of the
faculty, new technology, athletics and an expansion of
career services.
Though he acknowledged that contributions to the

endowment and building funds might be expected to trans-

late into lower contributions to the annual appeal, Eldridge
said Swarthmore had no choice but to embark on a com-

prehensive campaign, since the need for a new science center and dorm did not resolve the need for the curriculum
and other services to grow. Alumni seem to agree: last
year's annual appeal received the largest response ever.
Because of the economic downturn, there is a danger
that philanthropy is becoming a zero sum game in which

Swarthmore's fund-raising success means failure for other
important efforts.
Malcolm admitted that Swarthmore is "increasingly
competing with other charities" for charitable dollars of
socially conscious Swarthmore alumni. But he argued that
Swarthmore deserves to remain a recipient of these individuals' contributions. "Many organizations are dealing
with issues reactively," he said. "[By educating new leadsocial jusers] Swarthmore has a long term impact on

Bad news for needle-weary: meningitis shots mandatory
Pennsylvania.

BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu
In a move that affects all college
students, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a law June 28 requiring college students who live in
dorms to receive the meningococcal vaccination.

Approximately 40 percent of the
classes of 2005 and 2004 and 20 percent of the class of 2003 have
already been vaccinated, according
to data released by Worth Health
Center. Auhough there is no conclusive data on how many would
choose to waive the vaccine, Worth

Director Linda Echols said that
fewer than five percent of students
would choose that option.
Since students have arrived
back on campus, Worth has seen a
greater demand for the vaccine
than usual, Echols said. Thus far, it
has been able to meet these
demands, offering vaccinations to
students for a discounted fee of $6O.
Vaccines can usually cost as much
as $l2O. But the new law has greatly strained the availability of the
vaccine at health centers in* larthroughout
ger
universities

In the past, the vaccine has only
been recommended for students
who are at greater risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis
than the general population. In
passing
law,
this
the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
joined a handful of other states,
including Massachusetts, Florida,
and Virginia, that require students
to receive this vaccine in order to
register for classes.
Students can receive an exemp-

tion from this law by signing a
waiver claiming a religious belief
or, as the law reads, "a moral or
ethical conviction" against such
vaccinations. But the commonwealth strongly urges all students
to get the vaccine.
College students who live on
campus have a "six-fold increased
risk for meningitis" over the general United States population,
according to the Center for Disease
Control (CDC), since they live in a
closed setting which promotes the
transmission of meningitis. In the
past 15 years, only three students
have been infected with meningitis
at Swarthmore. All three are

healthy right now, but have been
"critically ill" at one point, Echols
said.

Students' responses to the new
requirement have been generally
positive. Many feel it is a good idea
to be vaccinated. "I think those
that don't allow their children to
be vaccinated are playing a dangerous game of roulette," Rachel
Kaufman 'O4 said. "They are betting that all the people around
their child won't get sick."
Some, however, have complained that the expensive vaccination is not covered by most insurance policies, and others have

objected to the fact that they were
not told of the requirement before
coming to school.
But Echols defended the health
center's failure to notify students
during the summer. "I did not
receive a letter until the second
week of August verifying that [the
vaccination requirement] was
indeed law and that we had to comply by August 30," she said. "The
original information we received
in July said that it would not be
law until September. Some schools
did not allow students to move in

to the dorms without the immu-

nization or waiver. We chose a different tactic, realizing that many
students were not at home or
would not receive the letter
because they were on the way back
to school."
She urged all students to either
follow the law and get the vaccine
or to sign the exemption waiver.
"Swarthmore must comply with the
law or face a stiff penalty," she said.
The required vaccine protects

against the four most common
strains of meningococcal bacteria
and remains effective for 3-5 years
after injection. The side effects of
this vaccine, if any, are mild. But
people with high fevers, immune
deficiencies, pregnancies or allergies to thimerosal should not
receive this vaccine.

Meningococcal meningitis

is

caused by a bacterium called
Neisseria meningitides, which can

trigger an inflammation in the

membranes around the brain and
spinal cord. Symptoms for this disease are similar to those of the flu,
but meningitis progresses very
rapidly and can be deadly. It
spreads through the air or through

Publications Office
planning photo blitz
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Imagine someone taking your picture wherever you go. Sitting in
class, relaxing in your dorm or partying in Paces, you keep hearing the
familiar click of a camera's shutter.
For one week, that is exactly how Swarthmore life will seem, after
the Publications Office one-week photo blitz begins.
Starting on Monday, the Publications Office will distribute about
200 rolls of film and 100 disposable cameras to students interested in the
project. Their only instruction is to "find fresh views of campus that

represent their experiences at Swarthmore," according to Director of
Publications Jeff Lott. Lott is coordinating this project along with studio arts professor Brian Meunier and Steven Goldblatt '67.
The photo blitz is the Publications Office's latest attempt to find
unique views of the campus for the 2003 Swarthmore calendar and a
feature article in the Swarthmore College Bulletin, according to Lott.
He is in charge of constructing the college's annual calendar, which is
sent out to over 20,000 parents and alums.
In previous years, Lott has used archived photos and student artwork, but this year, he wanted to incorporate students in the creative
process. "I wanted to do something different this year, and I wanted to
show alumni how students saw the campus," Lott said.
Originally, Lott's idea was to distribute cameras only to members of
Meunier's photography classes. However, both Lott and Meunier realized that handing out the cameras to everyone would provide a fuller
view of student life. "Our thinking there was that by being more egalitarian, we would get a cross section of student life," Meunier said.

Under the current plan, students will have the cameras and film for
one week. During that time, students participating in the project are
supposed to take pictures of anything on campus. Lott's hopes are that
this will include a wide range of subjects: "labs, classrooms, professors,
the Crum at night and parties on the weekend."
On Monday, September 16, the Publications Office will collect the
cameras and send them off to Ritz Camera stores for free developing.
When the pictures come back to the college, each student will receive a
copy of his or her prints. Then, according to Meunier, students will be
asked to submit their favorite pictures to the three coordinators, who

will judge the photographs.
"I'm going to be looking for photographs with pictorial strength
combined with effective content," Meunier said.
Goldblatt, a professional photographer, will also judge photos with
a critical eye. "I need to see a strong picture, but in this case it needs
to be something that speaks to the image of Swarthmore," he said.
At the end of the judging period, the three project coordinators will
choose 15 photos for the calendar and another dozen for a special article about the project appearing in the Swarthmore College Bulletin.
Both Meunier and Goldblatt consider this a light-hearted project,
and they both recognize that handing out cameras to college students
with instructions for free-form photography can be a dangerous idea.
"I have a lot offaith in the creativity of the Swarthmore students," said
Goldblatt. "It's going to be a major job just wading through everything
but I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
Meunier, in particular, is looking forward to seeing some of the
wackier pictures. "This is a very light exercise," he said, "and we
expect to get some party pictures. I hope I get to see some for my own
personal enjoyment."

Part of this year's orientation Olympics, freshmen competed

in three-legged races in the field house.

Olympics enliven orientation
From ORIENTATION, pg. 3
Olympics helped CA groups to "establish more
group cohesion," a major aim of this year's OC,
which consisted of only sophomores.
"A problem with past orientations was that CA
groups fell apart almost immediately because
other than the initial meeting / ice-breaker, and
the computing, library and swimming orientations, CA groups spent no time together," said OC
member Eric Golynsky 'O5. "For this orientation,
the OC made it one of our primary goals to make
the CA groups work, and hopefully improve the
transition to college life for first-years."
Low attendance during activities has also been
a problem during past orientations, which many
believe the Olympics helped remedy. "In addition
to increased bonding, the thinking was [that] it
would increase participation in CA events as well,"
Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd Goundie
said. "From what I have been hearing, the
Olympics were successful in accomplishing these
goals."

In addition to the Olympics, another change featured the Delta Upsilon fraternity hosting an 'Bos
party during the dry orientation week. Members of
DU approached the OC wanting to host an event
for freshmen during which they could "improve
their image and give the freshmen a good impression of their fraternity and counter some of the
stereotypes," Golynsky said.
Yet another change was that upon the students'
arrival on campus, the deans led parents on tours

of Worth Health Center and the first floor of
Parrish. According to Goundie, these tours served
to make the parents aware of all of the resources
available to students and allow their children to
settle into their dorms without parental interference. Commenting on the latter purpose, Goundie

September 5, 2002

said "I mentioned this to the parents in my tour
groups and they seemed to appreciate this sentiment and were glad to be out of the way."
Also, all of this year's orientation activities
were alcohol-free. During last year's orientation, a
small controversy arose concerning drinking
among the orientation staff, and a student was
taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. "The
OC was very committed to keeping the campus dry
during orientation, as were the RAs, and that sentiment seems to have trickled down through the
CAs to everyone," Goundie said.
Though the rain interfered with several
planned activities, such as the traditional outdoor
collection, an outdoor movie showing of "The
Princess Bride" and an outdoor sleepover, many
freshmen found orientation enjoyable and helpful
in the adjusting to college life. "I really enjoyed my
CA group." Thomas

Showalter 'O6 said.

"We

formed kind of a cohesive whole."
Even though orientation was full of events,
Showalter added, he "didn't feel pressured" to go to
every activity.
"I don't think that anything can prepare you
[for campus life], but orientation helped me adjust
better," Tiffany Pao 'O6 said, adding she particularly enjoyed the Olympics theme.
Despite the rain plaugued orientation, Goundie
believes the Class of 'O6 might have initiated a new
Swarthmore tradition. Since their first collection
had to be held indoors, students were prohibited
from lighting candles during the ceremony.
Faculty speaker Rachel Merz suggested that quartz
rocks could replace the candles in generating light
and even gathered 400 quartz rocks from the Crum.
"The rocks worked out great," Goundie said, "and
students were saying that they would be holding
on to them as keepsakes through their Swat
careers."

Johnson managed to usually appear silly and harmless, however, and this facade fooled many of his friends. Ted Chan 'O2 knew
that Johnson regretted not being more athletic but didn't think it
was a major problem. "It seemed like he never let it bother him,"
Chan said.
While Johnson did exhibit signs of depression, news of his suicide was startling to all who knew him.
"A week before his death [at his 21st birthday party] he was saying that this was his greatest summer ever," said Dan Schwartz 'O2,

another friend.
The shock of losing their son has caused Russell and Dawn
Johnson to search for some kind of reason for his death. They have
just begun to investigate the possibility that antidepressant drugs
may have played a major role in the death.
Johnson was an insomniac and took prescription medication to
help him sleep. According to Wulfsberg, Johnson recently became
interested in taking another medication to ease his bouts of depression and help him concentrate better in class. On Aug. 16, he began
to take the drug Wellbutrin. The next day he suffered from major
mood swings, causing his younger sister, Lisa, to become concerned. He remained on this new medication until taking his life
three days later.
According to the drug's official Web site, Wellbutrin is an anti-

antidepressants. Because of its different makeup Wellbutrin has

dal ideation.

Hamilton speculated that Wellbutrin may have interacted poorly with Johnson's insomnia medication. "It might have backfired
and caused him to concentrate on his suicidal thoughts," he said.
CLOSE FRIENDS RECALL BETTER TIMES
Regardless of the cause of Johnson's death, his friends and family said they were suffering as a result. Remembering his many
good qualities has helped them cope with the pain of losing him.
"Once he felt comfortable with someone he would really try
hard to get together with them," Schwartz said. "I don't think he

Another one of Johnson's passions was intramural basketball.
Hamilton explained that although he wasn't a great athlete, he
loved spending time with his friends. "He never was very good, but
it didn't really matter," he said. Johnson was also a member of the
Ultimate Frisbee team his sophomore year, and enjoyed playing

double majoring in economics and psychology, and would often finish his work ahead of time, then urge his friends to go out partying
with him. "He helped us all loosen up a bit," Wulfsberg said.
"He'd just pop into your room when you were least expecting it,"
Schwartz added.
Chan agreed that Johnson could be awkward and suffered from
a lack of social skills, but said, "Those that got to know him were
very rewarded."
The dean's office plans to hold a memorial service for Johnson
soon. All students will be notified of the time and location.

My big, thin German

'MARTHA'
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

One of this summer's best independent films
is an ethnic romantic comedy written, by,
directed by, and starring a woman, and it ends
in a wedding
but not the big, fat Greek one
you're thinking of.
Sure, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is as
appealing as everyone says, but "Mostly
Martha" is better.
Not that "Mostly Martha" is an example of
flawless filmmaking, however. For starters, the
"Mostly" is a mistranslation of the Italian
"Bella," and a film that requires any kind of
translation will find its potential audience automatically reduced by 35 percent.
Counter-intuitively, and to make things
even more difficult, "Martha" is a German-language film. The writer-director, Sandra
Nettlebeck, probably chose the Italian word in
the title because Italian is sexier than German.
I feel comfortable making that generalization
because the film itself makes it.
Plus, it seems to be true. It's easier to get
people to see an Italian film. Think "Life is
Beautiful" or "Bread and Tulips," which
charmed audiences last year.
Ms. Nettlebeck straightforwardly acknowledges the preconceptions about her country:
Germany, as it seems to be embodied in the title
character, is rigid, structured, and repressed.

By contrast, Italy, as it seems to be embodied
in Martha's love interest, Mario, is vibrant,
romantic, and carefree.
Martha (Martina Gedeck) is the tightlywound, type-A head chef of an elegant Italian
restaurant. The only people in her life outside
September 5,

2002

the kitchen are a woeful therapist, whom
Martha would rather cook for than talk to, and
her sister, single with an 8-year-old daughter,
Lina (Maxime Foerste). When, Martha's sister
dies suddenly in a car accident, Martha takes
Lina in.
Martha certainly means well, but she wouldn't know a maternal instinct if it knocked on
her door and offered to babysit.
Lina, uprooted and orphaned, reacts to her
aunt with equal awkwardness, and she quietly
rebels against her new life by refusing food
while she waits for her absentee Italian father
to show up and rescue her.
Meanwhile, Mario (Sergio Castellitto), gets a
job in Martha's kitchen and drives Martha
crazy with his tardiness and charm. But underneath his bravado, Mario just wants Martha's
approval, and when Martha brings Lina to the
kitchen with her, he earns it by getting Lina to

eat.
If the way to man's heart is through the
stomach, apparently the way to a woman's is
through a child.
The three form a cute, tentative family.
Martha begins to relax and even allows Mario
to make her food. Mario drops the bravado act.
Lina begins to look and act like a normal kid.
But such happiness is even more fleeting in
movies than in real life: theirs is interrupted by
Lina's father, who arrives to take his daughter
with him back to Italy.
"Mostly Martha" may be predictable at
points, and its score is a soft jazz atrocity, but
the food looks terrific and the script never
unlike some other ethnic
makes you cringe
romantic comedies I could mention. Really, see
this one.

'FEELS SO GOOD TO FEEL SO BAD UPSTAIRS'
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollinsl@swarthmore.eclu
Okay, so this was my first time in Philly by
myself. This was also my first time lost in Philly by
myself. Six blocks, two trains, one synagogue and a
banana cake later, I found myself in an alley behind
the National Museum of Jewish
History trying to find the theater.
Just when I was about to conclude
that I was in the wrong place,
Swarthmore juniors Sam Dingman,
Felicia Leicht, Audrey Pernell, and
Adrienne Mackey along with recent
graduates Keetje Kuipers, Elisa
Matula, Jon Stancato, Kafhy Walley,
Kiran Rikhye, and Sarah Yardney,
all 'O2, pulled up in two minivans
with the theater in their back seats.
The students were preparing for
what was to be a glowing performance of the Swat-produced "Portrait
of Dora as a Young Man." The play
was a collective effort: written, produced, directed and managed by,
and featuring the Stolen Chair
r
Theater Company, a group cmposed
entirely of Swarthmore students and alums.
Loosely
inspired
by
Sigmund Freud's
"Fragments of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria,"
"Portrait" focuses on Ida "Dora" Bauer, the daughter of a wealthy Austrian merchant at the turn of the
20th century, and her relationship with a lecherous,
cigar-smoking Sigmund Freud. Freud analyzes the
relationship between Dora and her father's business
partner and friend, known simply as Herr K., who
pursues Dora with generous gifts of jewelry and
flowers. Freud believes Dora to be quite infatuated
with Herr K., as well as with Herr K.'s wife, with
whom her father was having an affair; her father;
and, indeed, even the good doctor himself.

Silent movie interludes, minimal sets and costumes, Freud's pretzel cigar, songs including "The
Love Rectangle Blues," "All the Girls I Know Are
Neurotic" and "Feels So Good to Feel So Bad
Upstairs," and an injection of intellectualism make
for what Kuipers calls "decidedly Swat theater."

angle," Kuipers said. "Analysis was

Do I have to
answer that?
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE
sbeveril@swarthmore.edu

As a senior, I get the classes I want, the massive Wharton
room and the automatic respect of underclassmen (or at least I'd
like to think so). I've earned these perks, but I pay dearly every
time I hear the words "What are you planning to do after college?" Dozens of times this summer, an unwitting friend/coworker/acquaintance/neighbor/parent would ask the question,
probably expecting a neat little answer blending values and
ideals with a concrete career path. If only they had asked about

the weather
Rather than replying, "Look over there! An ice cream truck,"
and running, I used to say I was going straight to law school. Or
I'd say that I'd definitely do/never ever do what my parents do.
For years, I planned to settle in downtown New York City, but
now my East Coast snobbery is waning, and the other coast and
even other countries seem tempting^
Each time I heard the question, I tended to give a different
answer. If my interrogator caught me in the right mood, I'd joke
that I was going to make my way from town to town in Australia
at least until that traveling European chocopicking berries
late taster gig came through (that job does exist with Godiva
Chocolatier; my med-school-tracked summer housemate tipped
me off to it).
My parents don't bother asking the question anymore. They
seem to prefer to answer it themselves. Dad lectured me about
too much "navel gazing" in college and warned me of my passive
path towards a civil service job. If I happened to dig out a specific career, he'd remind me that some fields are very competitive, and then flip the TV channel.

That band with a vibraphone
Olde Club begins its concert schedule this Saturday night, Sept. 7, with a
performance by Aloha, a quartet from Cleveland that is not afraid to admit that
the vibes are just as cool an instrument as the guitar. Below is an interview
with the band's lead singer, Tony Cavallario. BY AARON WASSERMAN
Phoenix: When and how did your band form?
Tony Cavalliero: We started in 1997. Eric (vibes)
and I used to be in a hardcore band and that was done
for. Matthew (bass) recruited us, and Eric wanted to
play his vibraphone. So we got together and wrote a
million songs right off the bat that we don't remember
how to play. We got real serious in 1999 when Cale
(drums) joined the band and we recorded what became
our EP for Polyvinyl.

....

Last week, Mom interrupted my fall semester jitters by asking if she should apply for that tuition insurance in case I duck
out of Swarthmore. A little insulted by her question, and a little
distracted by its implications, I wondered what I'd be doing
instead of college. After a mutual pause, she replied that she'd
better send it tomorrow, and then finished sponging the kitchen

counter.
Her usual advice to "marry rich" may not be such a bad idea.
I could exploit somebody else's stability, and then pursue my
own goals at my own pace.
Alternatively, I could follow up on one of those monthly mailings from the Westchester Business Institute. After all, they successfully place 90% of their graduates in careers of their choice,
and everybody in the brochures looks so satisfied.
During a previous kitchen conversation about my future,
Mom asked the question again. Before I could answer, she added
that she didn't see me doing the regular 9-to-5 thing, and neither do I. So much for the Westchester Business Institute.
It's not that I don't like college quite the opposite. Sure, I'm
a bit hesitant to come back this fall, but not because I'm avoiding Swarthmore. Once I start my last year of school, my time as
a student will have to end. At least I'll have a degree, but what
do I do with that? Will it really be all that different? Will a career
change my life goals? Do I have life goals
that I can articulate?
Lots of my peers seem to have neatly packaged plans for the
future, and I'm happy for them, unless of course they're conspiring to look good (and make me look bad). I may not have a
clear future, but at least I'm not a malicious liar.
I feel privileged to be so indecisive. When my dad graduated
from college in the late sixties, he knew that he was going to
graduate school or Vietnam. I don't want somebody to tell me
what to do, and I like having a little flexibility, and even mystery
in my future. If I come up with concrete plans, I'll have to cut out
options. Once I pick a career, I'm defining myself, but by narrowing my scope. Growth in one direction seems to limit others.
An acquaintance and less-than-content researcher at the
Kennedy School of Government said of the institution, "Law
schools make lawyers and public policy school makes bureaucrats." So what does Swarthmore make? Ask me again in June.
My avoidance scheme may conflict with what I learned in my
Thinking, Judgment, and Decision Making class, but indecision
gives me control over my future; there's freedom in the
unknown. It'll work out eventually, but I'll coast along on uncertainty for now.
So, feel free to ask me and my fellow seniors the obligatory
questions about the future, but don't expect a coherent response
from everyone. Confusion is okay, and even honest. I'll either be
proud to answer that I don't know, or I'll lie and say that I'm
planning to divide my time between professional navel-gazing,
"Hey! Look over there ..."

Two minutes into Aloha's second album, vibraphonist
Eric Koltnow's mallets have shattered any ideas
about guitar-rock complacency. From there, the band
hops on the vibraphone's back and goes charging
into a dense forest of jazz instrumentation, intricate
songwriting and complex time signatures. The vibraphone is not used just as a novelty instrument.
Rather, it is the guitars and vocals that have the feeling of an afterthought. In a rock band, unique niches
are important, but so are catchy songs. Aloha's vibraphones answer the first qualification, but sometimes
sabotage the second. When Aloha does both, the
band creates one of the most exciting and refreshing
sounds being made today. AW

TROMA WARD
Phoenix: In your book "All I Need to Know About
Filmmaking I learned from 'The Toxic Avenger,'" you

say that many independent movies, like the ones
shown at the Sundance Film Festival, "seem to be
auditions for mainstream films as opposed to being
independent film." At the same time, you list prolific
B-movie director Roger Corman as an influence, but
his films frequently imitated popular mainstream
films outright. What's the difference between Roger
Corman's movies and the ones shown at Sundance?
Kaufman: The movies Roger Corman directed on his
own in the 'sos and '6os were the influences. "The Man
With X Ray Eyes," "Fall of the House of Usher"
they
proved that low-budget movies could be provocative and
have good acting. Now he's producing inexpensive versions of mainstream films like "Jurassic Park," but that's
not what influenced me. It's a pity he doesn't direct anymore.
Sundance should be called HBOdance
or
Miramaxdance. It has nothing to do with sun. A festival
is supposed to be festive. You're supposed to have fun and
bring new art to the people. What they show at Sundance
has already been digested or created by the mainstream.
It's not an independent film festival. We've got a new film
coming out called "In Search of Independence." It's the
true story of Sundance, and it goes between Sundance
and Tromadance [Troma's own film festival].

We're amateurs at appealing to
the lowest common denominator
Troma fans are very intelligent.
At Sundance you're not allowed to hand out leaflets.
There are rules about speaking and leaflets; it's not cov-

ered by the first amendment. Thomas Paine was out of
line, according to these people. You're not allowed to say,
"Hey! I made a movie!" to a film executive. James Lynch
[a Troma volunteer] handed out leaflets, and he spent the
night in jail.

Movies like "Killer Klowns From Outer Space" and
"Eight-Legged Freaks" illustrate exactly the opposite
the major studios releasing purposefully campy
films. Has Troma influenced the mainstream? Has
the outcome been positive?
Critics review "Me, Myself and Irene" and "EightLegged Freaks," saying they're like Troma movies from
the 'Bos, only they cost $5O million to make. There were
jokes in our movie "The First Turn-On" that we were
excoriated for in 1983. "The First Turn-On" had a gang
bang scene that was not appreciated. Now that's reproduced in movies today.
Look at "South Park." The guys who make it are
Troma fans

their show has the same satiric mood and
dismemberments. It's mainstream, but it's ripped
straight from Troma movies. They built on Troma in a
brilliant way. It's, wonderful.
But Hollywood isn't doing anything interesting with
Troma stuff. Those movies suck. No one's going to look at
"Eight-Legged Freaks" ten years from now, except on TV
with the rest of that crap.
Troma movies are far from safe general-market fare,
but some might say the excessive sex and violence
in a typical Troma production is itself catering to the
lowest common denominator. Why are the Howard
Sterns of the world popular while Troma remains on
the fringe?
Howard Stern is about money. Howard Stern has no
interest in art or changing the world. He's funny. He's a
good interviewer. But he's all about money.
We'd be happy to make money, but our movies are
more than entertainment. The dean of the American Film
Institute wrote that I was one of the few genuine auteurs
one of the only directors with total artistic control.
There's Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, [Martin] Scorsese.

THE PHOENIX

Phoenix staff writer KATE DUFFY sits down for an
exclusive talk with cult filmmaker Lloyd Kaufman on
censorship, the sad state of satire, money-grubbing
Howard Stern and how laughing at something may be
the best way to shove it in people's faces.

Just a handful. And there's me.
The Troma tradition is rooted in Grand Guignol. It's
been around since the 17th century. It's nothing new. The
movies are not aimed at the lowest common denominator.
You have to be smart to understand and appreciate them.
We're interested in creating emotions.
Major studios have to appeal to the lowest common
denominator, and they do. Julia Roberts in "Pretty
Woman," a movie glorifying prostitution: PG rating.
Kevin Bacon in "Footloose," a movie glorifying smoking:
PG rating. "Forrest Gump" teaches you to follow orders
like a retard, even if you get your ass shot off in Vietnam,
and you will be rewarded. You will be a millionaire. But
if you're a Gyno-American, you will be punished and get
AIDS.
We're amateurs at appealing to the lowest common
denominator
Troma fans are very intelligent.

Roger Corman credits you for the creation of "a universe embraced by psychotic aberrants and the
Cinematheque Francais at the same time." At the
time of Troma's inception, would your films have had
such a range of appeal? How has the audience

changed?

As a filmmaker I've gotten better. With the earlier
films, there were times when I listened to the wrong people and compromised. The last four films I've made, I
haven't compromised.
We've persevered. Our body of work is consistent. The

movies revolve around the theme of a conspiracy of
bureaucratic, labor and corporate elites. The little people
of Tromaville liberate themselves from that system. So
we have a consistent worldview. You can enjoy Troma
movies as festivals of sex and violence or as sophisticated

famous character.

"Troma's War" dealt with AIDS. Do movies like "XXX"
have one kernel of thought-provoking substance? What
will endure? Nothing. It's baby food. Meanwhile, there
are Troma retrospectives all over the world. We care
about our films, and they have substance. They're ahead
of their time.

Never. The world of art is controlled by a handful of
no way we can reach our fans.
We get 200 million hits to troma.com each month
but Blockbuster acts as though Troma doesn't exist. We
just heard from HBO saying they'd â  never show our

Is there anything too taboo or offensive for Troma?
I wouldn't do a movie glorifying Hillary Clinton.
That's obscene. Or Hitler.
Columbine was the result of racism, sexism and violence
it should be made fun of and shoved in people's
faces through satire. Until "Troma's War," AIDS was not
discussed. We laughed at it. We satirized it when it was
being swept under the carpet and ignored.
Satire is dying. It's nice to see "South Park" and "The
Simpsons" kindling what's left of American satire. But
now there are politically correct police. You're not

allowed to make fun of anything.

I'm sure a lot of people accuse your movies of objec-

tifying women.

Actually, no. Women are the smart ones in Troma
movies. We call them gynos because 'women' has the
word 'men' in it. Gynos save the men in "Troma's War."
"Tromeo and Juliet" is all about Juliet. She's the focus.
Sure, the gynos are in small clothing, but so are the men.
"Squeeze Play" is about gynos playing softball and
being oppressed by men. It's not to be confused with "A
League of Their Own" which came out years later, when
it was safe.
Sure, there are some fucking scenes. It's R-rated. Why
not? I like it. A lot of people do. They aren't porno films.
If you want to see women hung up on a meathook, watch
TV. Watch "Friends." Those women are pansies.
Femmies. That's exploitation. Gynos are heroes, at least
in the movies Michael [Herz, Kaufman's partner] and I
did. We've gotten very little hate mail.

It seems as though the censoring standards for what
can be shown on TV and theaters are gradually lowering. Do you foresee a day when uncut, Tromesque
movies enter the mainstream?

September 5, 2002

Lloyd Kaufman poses with the Toxic Avenger, his most

conglomerates. There's

movies again. They're only getting their movies through
the cartel now.
We've got millions of fans. Our movies are entertaining, and they've got something to say. But it's difficultfor
fans to see our movies due to economic blacklisting.
The only reason we're still in business is because fans
are aggressive about getting our movies. They go to independent video stores and ask for Troma sections. They
book our movies in theaters. It's been said that we're the
They Might Be Giants of movies because of our interactive fan relations. The only difference is that they're successful.
What do you anticipate for Troma in the future?
In the fullness of time, Troma will be understood as
phenomenal. We're the only independent studio that's
existed for 30 years in the history of cinema. We were cut
off by the mainstream. Shunned. We're still in the underground. Usually important underground artists become

appreciated by the mainstream, like Andy Warhol, or
they blow their brains out likeVan Gogh. They don't stay
in the underground. But whether we like it or not, it looks
like we'll always be here, if we survive.

I wouldn't do a movie glorifying
Hillary Clinton. That's obscene.
Or Hitler.
After Herz and I go into the sunset, and the vassals of
the giant devil-worshipping conglomerate get their hands
on what we have, Troma will be worshipped. The director's cut of "The Toxic Avenger" with the head-crushing

scene will be shown on prime time.
Everyone is being dumbed down. You've got to be cool.
We don't believe that. We want you to be hot, alive. They
want you to eat at McDonald's and stay at the Holiday Inn.

From the editor: A guide to The Phoenix
Even though rain deprived first-years of a candlelit first
collection in the amphitheater, here's hoping that the year
will be prove a good one for all.
In addition to the usual influx of new students, the summer has brought a number of changes. Sadly, the class of
2003 has lost one of its members, and the library one of its
most beloved employees. The campus looks different as
well, as heavy construction continues âon schedule âat the
new science center. The new field is also in progress, but is
now months behind schedule. The basement of Mary Lyon
is vastly improved in appearance, and Beardsley looks better too. The average age of residents in the Strath Haven
apartments has plummeted markedly, as the overflow
apartments become home to a number of students.
It's coming up on two years now since this college had a
football team. Japanese is being offered this year. One student is preparing for trial this month. Several deans and
administrators have swapped positions, and the
Intercultural Center has a new director. Behind the scenes,
but certainly worth noting: the development office is almost
at the halfway mark in the $230 million Meaning of
Swarthmore campaign.
We're happy to present you with our first issue, and we
hope that reading The Phoenix will become an anticipated

When humor isn't funny Send world leaders
Education has thrust me beyond gangsta rap stereotypes
BY TARU TAYLOR

ttaylorl@swarthmore.edu

Do black people have a sense of humor? Can black
people laugh at themselves? Even when the humorist
is white?

An open question, given the overreaction to a freshman who took it upon himself to parody gangsta rap
and pop culture by taking the lyrics of an Eazy-E song
and performing them to top-40ish pop guitar. I did not
actually see the performance, but I heard about it.
When a black classmate did a rendition of the performance, I thought it hilarious, quite clever. I gave
the kid props. Predictably, this same classmate chastised the kid for "making fun of black people" and
chastised me for condoning his performance. She
questioned my blackness. How
could 1 laugh at a white kid making fun of black people? How could
I? Because I immediately appreciated the irony of the performance
(Eazy-E juxtaposed with top-40
pop music), which could easily be
interpreted not so much as a parody of black culture but as a commentary on our modern Elvis

who end up at state schools and at private schools like
Swarthmore. Eazy-E, Tupac Shakur and Notorious

offended black person interpretation, that white freshman was poking fun at a black subculture, which

of, unfortunately.

the blues. He's basically a white Eazy-E.
Or maybe the freshman's performance was directed
at the mixed signals Britney Spears sends millions of
teenaged (mostly white) girls, the wholesome virginal
southern belle on the one hand, "not a girl, not yet a
woman"; the scantily clad sexpot on the other hand.
(Anyone who saw her performance at last year's MTV
Video Music Awards, not to mention the Pepsi commercial that got a rise out ofBob Dole, knows what I'm
talking about).

Both Eminem and Britney Spears are patently
absurd, and that kid's performance could easily be
seen as a parody of them, merely using Eazy-E as fodder. Of course, its openness to interpretation is part of
the performance's brilliance. But for the purposes of
this article, we'll stick to the narrow interpretation of
the black classmate who took me to task because I did
not take it seriously as an offended black person. We'll
assume, with apologies to the freshman performer,
that he was in fact "making fun of black people."
In the late 'Bos I was a teenager when Eazy-E was

specifically "wiggers" who act black, not any of the
white kids I see around Swat. Eazy-E epitomizes ghetto thug life, not the black kids here. Not even me, and
I grew up "ghetto." But the Jesuit classical education I
got at Prep taught me how to think for myself, outside
that box. Why should I take a parody of Eazy-E personally?
Indeed, why should I take it seriously? What do I

Bell tower history revealed
Dear Editor:
In the Phoenix's online coverage of the bell tower
of Clothier ("The bell tower," April 5, 2001), the maintenance director is quoted as denying suicide
attempts. No less a personage than the former national president of NOW, Molly Yard, has been quoted on
the end of sororities at Swarthmore College as precipitated by the suicide of a woman student not pledged
to one of the sororities at a time when Molly Yard was
a student. If "those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it", then a danger exists. In any case,
the photography was wonderful.
In the 19505, when we had football, wrestling,
swimming, diving and all manner of sports, before
Title IX, the main problem was that we were considered "girls" and "boys." As an adult, yes, a "senior"
adult, I see that past as something to look back on, but

not to stare at. Fortunately for me, I have moved to a
community (Mount Pleasant, SC) where the only
other identifiable Swarthmore graduate is also a
member of "Mind the Light" and a nice guy who happened to play football. My child, who knows members
of the Board of Managers personally and is a NYC
lawyer of some repute, tells me that socially they are
not that much different from us, only richer, so I will
trust in the democratic process and long for the days
when Quaker principles were intricately involved

with the running of Quaker institutions.

Out From Gaia
understanding might guide

There was only one thing
I ever learned on the first day
of school growing up, besides
the rules and regulations and
how much everyone had
changed over the summer.
That was the importance of
goal-setting.
in
Especially
grade
school, my teachers emphasized it, some taking the time
to have us write separate
daily, weekly, monthly and
year-long goals. I bought into
it, and I still sit down with
my notebook the week before
school starts to ponder
knowledge, time management and where my new

me.

Seemingly, very few leaders attending the United Nations
World Summit on Sustainable Development this past week in
Johannesburg, South Africa had a similar experience growing up. The purpose of the summit is to chart progress and
set goals according to those set 10 years ago at the Rio Earth
Summit in Agenda 21, which states that protection of the
environment, social development and economic development
are the three pillars of sustainable development. The United
States is under international criticism for opposing timetables for reducing dependence on fossil fuels, eliminating
subsidies for its farmers (which adversely affects farmers in
developing nations) and relieving hunger.
American student representatives at the summit reported
last week that the United States and the European Union had
agreed secretly to strike all parts of the text of the Kyoto
Protocol which encourage countries to enforce the standards
of the document, and that the European Union, Australia,
and South Africa were working on a nebulous replacement
paragraph to state something like, "Countries should work
to stop climate change," without mention of binding goals.
This is just one example of chronic avoidance behavior.

The show must go on without the
support of the United States.
I was always shocked the most on the first day of school
when someone was absent, usually because they were on
vacation or jet-lagged
surely they had their priorities
mixed up. That would be our fearless leader, George W. Bush,
who is not attending the largest international summit on
issues of the environment, public health, and trade for ten
years. Colin Powell attended for two days, mostly in an
attempt to convince other nations of the need to go into Iraq.
But the show must go on without the support of the
United States, and the issues being addressed at the summit
go beyond political boundaries and American expectations
of quality of life. Although without binding goals, agree-

ments have been reached to reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 and halve the number of people without sanitation by 2015; progress has also been made on
issues of water, improved governance and restoring depleted fisheries. As usual, those issues which point fingers at
the Global North as an exploiter are avoided
namely, subsidies to farmers, debt cancellation and multinational corporate accountability.
People from all over the world have been shouting from
the streets of Johannesberg all week, mostly calling for
localization and protesting corporate greed and the United
States and Eruopean Union's unwillingness to compromise;
essentially asking the world's leaders to question the ogre of
capitalism.
It's difficult to know how much lunch money to bring on
the first day of school, or whether it would have been a better idea to pack your own lunch. At my school we used to

lend each other money, and no one would be hungry, or owe
anyone else at the end of the week. A lot of things would be
different if children ran governments.

Vague practices of
ICC merit scrutiny
Ordinarily, I think the American media is pretty decent about
civil liberties issues. There's no doubt that the government would
be stifling more dissent, jailing more innocent people and violating
more laws if it didn't have a free and vigilant press watching over
its shoulders.But while I'm generally pleased with the media, there
is one area where they've really fallen down over the past few
months. With very little media comment on the subject, Americans
came close to being under the jurisdiction of a powerful tribunal,
unaccountable to our elected officials
and nearly impossible to overrule.
This isn't some scheme from the desk
of John Ashcroft, by the way. I'm
speaking about the International
Criminal Court (ICC).
So far, media coverage of the ICC
has focused almost exclusively on its
diplomatic implications. In a nutshell,
Bush's refusal to join has gotten the
entire planet even angrier at America
than it used to be. That sort of news is

important, but it's not the whole story
by any means. So the French foreign

minister has been muttering Gallic
obscenities all day. Big deal. What I
want to know is, if we ratified this
Two-Fisted Punditry treaty, what could the ICC do to me?
And whafcan it do to the people who
are already under its jurisdiction?
There's been relatively little discussion of what safeguards the
Court offers against official abuse or of what procedural rules it will
abide by or whether or not it passes basic Constitutional muster. We
don't even know whether or not the judges will wear black robes
and those funny British wigs. Even the watchdog groups who do
civil liberty advocacy as their 9-to-5 job seem to be taking a nap on
this one. I plugged 'lnternational Criminal Court' into the ACLU
website's search engine and came up with four documents, none of
which articulated any clear positions or were tremendously rele-

vant.
I don't consider myself a member of the 'black helicopters' school
of political theory. Conspiracy theories are good fun, but most of
them break down under the weight of their own complexity. You
don't have to be a paranoid, bunker-dwelling, fluoridated-water-distrusting militia member, however, to be concerned about encroachments on U.S. sovereignty. Under this treaty, a foreign entity insulated from pressure by our elected officials and not bound by the
Constitution would have the power to try and punish American citizens. That's potentially a very scary thing.
Most of you are probably thinking "Hey, I'm not a war criminal.
All of my crimes have been committed during peacetime, and none
of them even made bench warrant. Why should I worry about the
ICC?" That's an understandable attitude, and I think it's one of the
reasons why there hasn't been much debate about the civil liberties
aspect of the court. But it would be a dangerous mistake to assume
that the ICC won't have any effect on our lives just because we personally haven't razed any hamlets.
No matter how admirable its stated purpose, any law enforcement body has the potential to spin out of control. For example,
when John Ashcroft says that only terrorist evildoers will be affected by military tribunals and the TIPS program, no sane person
takes his word for it, and they're right not to do so. Whether a government entity is supposed to fight Al-Qaeda, punish war criminals,

preserve our beloved covered bridges or fulfill any other noble
cause, a bit of suspicion is always good and proper.
It might even be justified to be more skeptical of the ICC than we
are of our own government. In order to work properly, courts have
to be immunized from political pressure. If Bush and Ashcroft
decide to throw everyone wearing an ethnic-looking hat in prison,
at least the American people have the power to vote Democratic in
2004. Should the ICC exceed its rightful authority, we're in a deeper
bind. Revising the Court's structure to deal with that sort of problem is likely to be a real pain, especially if our dear European allies
continue their tradition of snootiness.
I'm not saying that the Court is a bad thing or that it is controlled
by wicked men. Frankly, I haven't researched the matter enough to
know whether or not I trust the ICC. It could very well be that the
Court would be an unmitigated boon to all of mankind. But before
we agree to be a part of it, we should know exactly what we're getting into. It's a moot point now that Bush has axed the treaty, but if
it ever returns from its grave, there ought to be a public debate in
which proponents make it clear exactly under what structures and
limitations the ICC will operate.

Mixed results for men's soccer at Swat Kick Classic
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore men's soccer team
kicked off its season this past weekend
with a third-place finish in the fifth annual
Swat Kick Classic. After being narrowly
edged out by Wesley 3-2 in the first game,
Swarthmore rebounded in the consolation
round, easily knocking off Medgar Evers 4L More importantly, the tournament
served as an indicator for the team to
gauge where it stands heading into the
strength of their schedule.
Although the 3-2 loss to Wesley was a
missed opportunity for the Garnet, who
clearly controlled the tempo of the game, it
was nonetheless a good learning experience. As co-captain Brendan R. Moriarty
'O4 summed up the loss, "We headed into
the tournament to see where we were, to
evaluate talent. We dominated the first
game, but it came down to defensive lapses
and missed scoring opportunities, things
that can be fixed."
With Swarthmore down 0-1 early on,
forward Marty Griffith 'O5 connected on a
header, assisted by midfielder Alex Elkins
'O6 in the 16th minute of play to tie the contest at one apiece. Griffith credited the play
to Elkins. "Alex did all the work on that
play," Griffith said. "He drew the defense
and I just finished what he made into an
easy set up for me."
In the 64th minute, Charles Taylor 'O6
gave the Tide a 2-1 edge off of an assist from
Griffith. Wesley responded late, however,
with two goals by Chris Wright ultimately
making the difference. The deciding goal
came in the 88th minute on a Wright shot
that barely squeezed through the fingertips
of outstretched Garnet goalkeeper Nate
Shupe 'O5.
In the 4-1 victory over Medgar Evers,
amidst sloppy playing conditions, the
Tide's balanced 4-4-2 attack proved to be
too much for their overmatched opponent.
Griffith led the Tide with a pair of goals
and an assist in the consolation match.
He opened up the scoring barrage in the
16th minute as he directed a pass from
Taylor into the net for the goal. Griffith

later returned the favor in the 62nd
minute, assisting Taylor and giving the
Tide an early 2-0 advantage.
The Cougars answered with a Michael
Yearwood score three minutes later that
proved to be Medgar Evers' only goal of
the tournament. Griffith found the net
again in the 73rd minute to put the Tide up

3-L Defenseman Spencer Paine 'O4 tallied
the last goal of the game in the 79th minute
of play, connecting off of an assist by Tevye
Kelman 'O6.
In the championship match, Widener
defeated Wesley 4-3 to take home the Swat

Kick Classic title.
Moriarty summed up the team's general optimism after the third place finish in
the classic, "We're thinking pretty positive
because we feel this is the best team we've
had in recent memory," he said. "There
are just some wrinkles to iron out."
Griffith was able to use the tournament
as a showcase for his offensive prowess, tallying three goals and two assists. Taylor

also displayed a breakthrough performance

in the tourney, tallying two goals and two
assists. Griffith attributed his early success
to the. depth of the team, which boasts a
strong recruiting class and an experienced
core of returning players. He is equally
optimistic as co-captain Moriarty about
this year's outlook for the team.
"We're easily a .500 team," Griffith said.
"We have a lot offreshman talent this year
and a lot of returning players on the squad.
It's just a better team overall."
Much of the team's early success has
been credited to new head coach Eric
Wagner, who has brought NCAA Division

111 playing experience and Division I
coaching experience to the Garnet Tide. He
has stepped in and immediately taken
charge of the team, making the role of the
captains smaller and the role of the coach
larger than in past years. Coach Wagner
has displayed an interactive style of coaching, in which he practices with players out

on the pitch.
"The biggest difference has been in
practices," noted Griffith, who has seen a
transformation take place in the team's

workouts, which emphasize, among other

things, good diagonal runs that were effective in the tournament.
Moriarty described the difference
Coach Eric Wagner has made leading the
team. "The difference is night and day from
last year to this year," he said. Coach
Wagner has a lot more presence and is

very good leader."
With an experienced and demanding
coach leading the way, the young and
improved Garnet Tide look to build off of
their third place finish in the Swat Kick
Classic and be a contender in the
Centennial Conference this season.

Wilcox: conference championships
within reach of field hockey team
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu
Can first-year head coach Kelly Wilcox '97 be serious
with her expectation that the field hockey team will play in
the Centennial Conference Championships this season?
Despite an excellent Swarthmore field hockey tradition that has amassed a phenomenal 56-16 record in conference play, recent events seemingly give Wilcox little
reason to be optimistic. Last year's squad barely finished
over .500 with an 8-7 overall record, including an unspectacular 4-5 record in conference play. Since then, the team
lost two of its star players, prolific goal scorer Kim
Cariello 'O2 and tenacious defender Katie Tarr 'O2, as well
as former head coach Karen Borbee. When the preseason
polls came out last week, the Garnet Tide was placed
sixth in the conference, well behind defending champion
and conference powerhouse Johns Hopkins. So why does
Wilcox boldly state that her team will play in the conference finals?
One reason is that Wilcox is preparing her players well
for the mental aspect of competing in a varsity sport as
Swarthmore student-athletes. Forward Helen Leitner 'O4
summed it up, "As Swatties, we think too much."
To combat this problem, Wilcox, a Swarthmore alum,

THE PHOENIX

teaches her players to remain calm and focused. "We go
through mental exercises that focus on one thought, so
players can concentrate on the game when they're on the
field," Wilcox said.
Players have already noticed the change in attitude.
"Last season, we were intimidated by our opponents. This
season, our goal is to be intimidating," Leitner said.
Even freshmen have sensed the energy Wilcox has
brought to the team. "There's a huge feeling of optimism,"
Heidi Fieselmann'o6 said.

Besides the attitude adjustment, Wilcox has introduced
new tactical and strategic changes. "Coach Wilcox introduced several new concepts. For example, she taught us a
new drive a quick hard hit that completely changes the
style of play," Leitner said.
Strategically, the team hopes to wear down and intimidate teams by using its greatest strength, a deep bench.
"This is the most talented team I've ever played on at any
level," Fieselmann said.
"This is the deepest bench I've ever seen at
Swarthmore," veteran goalkeeper Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3
said. "We don't have to rely on a standout player as we did
in years past."
According to, players and coaches, Nelson-Lee leads a
seasoned group of veterans. "Kate is one of the best goalies
September 5,

2002

in the conference," Leitner said. "But so is our backup
goalie, Jenn Hart '03." Combined with the scoring and
defensive talents of co-captains Meg Woodworth 'O3, Ingrid
Kaszas 'O3, and Katie Cloonan 'O3, the team maintains its
traditional, talented core of upperclassmen.
Unlike in years past, however, Wilcox plans on mixing
up the lineup with talented underclassmen. "The freshmen
are very skilled and confidant, and the sophomores have
played great," Leitner said.
Finally, Wilcox and her players also believe that last
year's disappointing season will serve as an advantage
when it comes to playing other teams. "No one's expecting
anything, so we don't feel any pressure," Nelson-Lee said.
"We have the opportunity to surprise teams," Wilcox
said.
Thus far, the Garnet Tide appear to be right on course.
At Franklin and Marshall's preseason play-day last weekend, the team beat Elizabethtown and Rowan and tied
Lebanon Valley to finish 2-0-L
"We played with some of the best teams in the country,
teams that were nationally ranked last year," Nelson-Lee
said, "and we went undefeated."
"The preseason gave us confidence," Wilcox said. And
the right to believe Wilcox's prediction might just come
true.

Women's tennis head coach Jeremy Loomis, left, and

men's soccer head coach Eric Wagner, right, are among the new additions to the athletic department this year.

A new season, a new staff: athletic staff gets four new coaches
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

rburstel@swarthmore.edu

At a time when Eric Wagner,
the newly appointed head coach of
the men's soccer team, is sorting

through his predecessor's old
papers, acquainting himself with
new colleagues and generally settling into his self-described position of "teacher and rebuilder," he
recalls a day 18 years ago when he
was in a similar position as the
new guy on campus. Wagner

remembers that the proprietor of
the bed-and-breakfast his family

stayed at prior to moving-in day at
Connecticut College asked his
mother about her son's intended

major.*"My mom answered, 'Oh,
for all I know, probably soccer, or
something,'" he said. It was that
mother's instinct that would prove
fateful for Wagner, one of four new

appointed
head
coaches
to
Swarthmore's athletic staff.
Certainly Wagner's near lifelong attachment to his sport of
choice is not unique among college
athletic coaches, but the way in
which he chooses to regard the
place of these sports and the role of
the coach in the athletic program
may be. Wagner identifies participation in sports as an essential
part of education. "What teachers

ask students to do in the classroom, I'm just asking them to do it

physically," he said. "I'm asking
my players to gather information,
implement it, and execute it."
Similarly, Harleigh Leach, who
enters her first season as
Swarthmore's volleyball coach,
contends
that coaching at*
Swarthmore gives her an opportunity to teach skills that student
athletes can apply both in and out
of the classroom. She admits that

initially, her childhood decision to

participate in organized volleyball
was trivial at best, explaining that
"the volleyball team didn't have to
run as much as the soccer team, so
I chose volleyball."
Leach now believes, however,
that playing and coaching volleyball allow her a unique way to
inspire and teach. Stressing the

Swarthmore, Leach said, "The
bottom line is that I want this

team to succeed, and together
we're working to determine
how we will define success this
season. In my book it never
means just wins and losses."
This view of sports as com-

is one that Kelly Wilcox '97 also
espouses as she enters her inaugural year as head coach of the

being the only alum to be the

head coach of any athletic team
at the school, is quick to credit
her college on-field activities,
along with the good coaching
she received, as the basis of her

own coaching style. Wilcox says
her approach to coaching is as
much about encouraging personal
growth as it is about mechanics.
"One specific goal this year is
to develop poise and confidence,"
she said. "If you create a space for
students athletes to learn, the
skills you teach are more likely to
take root."
Wilcox, who was hired in a
national search after former field
hockey coach Karen Borbee
resigned to concentrate on heading the women's lacrosse program,
hopes to establish athletics as a
key component of any higher-level
education. Having recently completed a master's degree in psychology, Wilcox is quick to emphasize the importance of good group
relations in a team setting. She

believes these skills, developed on
the field, are transferable to other
arenas of life. "As a student athlete, the confidence I gained on the
field translated directly to the
classroom," she said.
Jeremy Loomis, the new head
coach of the women's tennis team,
emphasizes the value of sports as a
way of learning how to operate
with others as a team, identifying
how to handle pressure and developing the confidence to overcome
adversity. Reflecting on his own
college career at the University of
Maryland, where he was named
men's tennis most valuable player
in his senior year, Loomis identifies his chiefmodel for coaching as
one from academia and not from
college
athletics.
a
It was
Shakespeare professor's "passion
and the way he taught, the way he

committed his attention, the way

he challenged me" that inspired
Loomis to coach tennis
first at
Miami University,
then
at

University of Maryland, and most
recently as an assistant coach at
Duke University.
Commenting on the differences
between coaching Div. I and Div.
11l teams, Loomis said, "The only

difference is the time involved.
Regardless of division, everyone's
still competing. At a smaller
school it's more familial, especially with my colleagues. Here I feel
more involved in the community."
The other coaches agree. "You
have the community of the staff in
a way you don't at larger schools. I
look around at staff meetings and

think, 'These people are exception-

al in terms of the depths of their
experiences,'" she said.
Wagner, who has coached soccer at several Div. I schools, is
quick to explain the difference in
the mechanics of coaching at
small schools. "Here I feel you can
be much more of an educator," he
said. "At Division I they've
already got great players. There
it's entertainment."
Associate Athletic Director
Adam Hertz cites this understand-

ing of coaching athletics at a Div.
11l school generally recognized for
its academic excellence as the primary reason the new head coaches
were hired. Hertz says the coaches

a new enthusiasm to the
department and a desire to see

"bring

their students succeed athletically
and academically. They each have
understanding
a
real
of
Swarthmore's environment."

An ode to the real
American pastime,
and it's not baseball
I might have an addictive streak to
my personality. I'm damn near impossible to lure away from a new, favorite
endeavor, be it Beirut or basketball. My
freshman year dormmates can testify
that moving me out of my La-Z-Boy and
away from my Play Station was akin to
dragging Jimmy Chitwood away from

#

the basketball court.
But there is nothing that can bring
my life to a screeching halt like the
great American pastime. My love for
the great sport causes me to dash madly
for the television every Saturday at
JOSH LOEFFLER
noon, yearning for the sweet melody of
Keith Jackson's voice. No, not baseball,
Riding the Pine â  which is running itself into the ground
as tradition falls by the wayside in
m^^^^^^
favor of the almighty dollar.
That's right, folks. I'm the all-time sucker for college football. It consumes me, controls me, and leaves me begging for more. Its smallest
details have seeped into my blood stream. It has led me to the ultimate I
addictive behavior. I know that most of you don't understand. Let me
try to explain. In the classic college football manner, let me crack open
a cold, delicious six-pack of reasons that I just cannot get enough of the
greatest sport in America.
L My first reason is a simple one, which some might even call silly.
But there are few things in this world I enjoy more than a good college
fight song. Feel free to sing along: "Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame,/
Wake up the echoes cheering her name." It sends chills down my spine.
I am willing to bet that after playing roughly one million games of
NCAA College Football for PlayStation, I know most schools' fight
songs better than the alumni. So what, you might say
all fight songs
come from eight basic tunes. But nothing gets 100,000 drunkards going
like one of these classics.
2. You can hear just about all of them every New Year's Day. Or at
least you could before the BCS spread the bowls out. One of my favorite
memories is going to my Aunt Rosie's house each New Year's Day, gorging myself with Amish-made pies and watching the bowl games with
my family. The games are now played out over a series of days, but the c
feeling is still there. You can't put into words the excitement of the
moments leading up to kickoff in the biggest college football game of the
year.
3. Unlike NFL games, college football is announced by the best. I
mean, really, has anyone ever done it better than Keith Jackson? Just
thinking about him saying "First and ten," makes me all warm and
fuzzy. College football programmers figured out long ago that it is more
enjoyable to watch a game being described by a distinct voice, instead
of, say, Pat Summerall.
4. The architects discovered that it is more fun to watch a football
game surrounded by 100,000 fans standing on old aluminum bleachers.
If you have never been to a college football stadium, you owe it to yourself to go. And try and make the trip when the stadium is filled, because
there is no greater sight in sports than a college football cathedral
packed to the brim. The Big House, the Horseshoe, the Rose Bowl.

The mud and construction vehicles at the site of the old track will eventually be replaced by a cuttingedge synthetic grass field. The construction is expected to be finished in approximately three months.

Borough ordinances, minor
setbacks delay completion
of synthetic grass field
BY KATE NELSON-LEE

knelson2@swarthmore.edu
The

"showcase

facility"

of

the

Athletic

Department is not looking very good these days. A
six-month-long project to install a synthetic grass
field and new track at the site of Swarthmore's
former gridiron has experienced a few unexpected

setbacks.

Initially, the $2 million facility had a completion date of Aug. 15, just in time for the return of
the field hockey team for preseason practice.
These days, a laminated sign on the orange
webbed fence reads, "Track will be closed until
approximately Dec. L"
The main reason behind the four-month delay

was a change in Borough drainage ordinances.
"Three weeks before we submitted our proposal to
the Borough for approval, they changed the
drainage ordinances," Associate Athletic Director
Adam Hertz said. The original proposal stipulated
that all of the run-off from the field be piped into
Crum Creek. Because of the possible significant
negative environmental impact of such a plan, the
borough asked that the runoff instead be
recharged into the groundwater table in what is
essentially a large septic system. "It's something
that hasn't been done before," Hertz said. "We're on
the cutting edge offield technology."
After several rounds of different drainage
plans, the Borough finally approved the college's
proposal, and with a quick groundbreaking ceremony and a large digger, construction commenced
on Jul. 15.
THE PHOENIX

Aside from a few minor problems, construction
has been moving at a good pace. "We've hit a 30yard stretch of solid rock on the south end of the
field," Hertz said. "It took two and a half weeks to
jackhammer through it."

The track surface itself has been scraped off in
the past week, and just yesterday construction
crews were milling down the asphalt base in

preparation for the next phase of construction.
According to Hertz, the next month entails a
number of smaller projects before the bases of the
field and track are poured. On the list is the
installation of a retaining wall on the east side of
the facility, the laying of the stone for the field's

new base, and continued electrical work for the
lights.

While the synthetic grass field was intended to
be the home field for the field hockey team this
fall, the delay has not adversely affected the team's
training. New head coach Kelly Wilcox '97 noted
that her team "reacted very well to the news. It's a
sign of maturity that they adapted so well to the
situation."
If the field were to be ready for use while the
team was still in season, Wilcox does not expect to
make the switch. "It's not even a consideration,"
she said.
Both Hertz and Wilcox commended the field
crew for their work during severe drought conditions to provide a good grass game field for the program. "Steve Donnelly and his crew did a tremendous job," Hertz said. "Water is a limited and valuable resource. You can't maintain fields in any
way without water."

These are America's works of architectural genius.
5. A good stadium needs people to fill it. The individuals who populate college football stadiums are the most rabidly loyal fans in
America. In short, they are my kind of people. Every Saturday, they
drive their RVs five hours to the game, tailgate for another four, watch
the game, then head home to catch the highlights. Just ask the people
at the census bureau. MemorialStadium has been the third largest city
in Nebraska for 250 consecutive Saturdays.
6. Which brings me to my favorite reason. Can you imagine the tailgates at the University of Nebraska? Because I can. On game days, college stadiums become home to the best party you have ever attended.
For instance, there is a reason they say that Penn State resides in
Happy Valley. If you will, Jell-0 shots for breakfast, brats and beer for
brunch, hot dogs and beer for lunch and unbelievable football for
dessert. Imagine the greatest party you have attended at Swarthmore (I
know, it might be hard), multiply that by, like, a gajillion, and what you
get is a University of Nebraska tailgate party.
In summary, my boy Spoon at Penn State called the other day and
said he could possibly score four tickets to the Nebraska game. I got so
excited I had to be revived. State College, where the beer flows like wine
and the women instinctively flock like the swallows of Capistrano. A
night game. Read into that last statement: eight hour party. College
football. Life just doesn't get much better than this.

Sarah Hobbs 'O6 handles her success without a trace of
egotism. Hobbs, a center midfielder from Fort Collins,
Colo., contributed one of the four Garnet goals in the
women's soccer victory over the Knights of Neumann
College this Saturday in the annual Swat Kick Classic.
"I was ecstatic to have the chance to start the first game
of the season and to score my first career goal," Hobbs
said. "Making the transitionfrom high school soccer to the
college level is obviously challenging and nerve-racking,
but the team has helped the other first years and me feel
immediately accepted."
The 2002 women's soccer team is composed of 26 players, including- returning starters Shavaugn Lewis 'O5,
Claire Hoverman 'O3, Corey Pilver 'O4, Catherine
Salussolia 'O4, Katey McCaffrey 'O4, Tanya Hahnel 'O5, and
Ele Forbes 'O5. Lewis, who tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) five games into last season, is looking to repeat
her pre-injury success during this season while continuing
to rehabilitate her knee. Salussolia made 54 saves in the
2001 season and backs the team from the goal. Forbes, who
mans the sweeper position, is a constant source of intensity for the team, and she hopes to play a huge role in the
success of the Garnet women this season.
Joining the returning starters are six first-years, ten

two juniors. Injuries have held the

Garnet back in the preseason, with more than six players
unable to play. Several others, like Lewis, are still rehabilitating for past injuries. Despite the rash of injuries, head
coach Amy Brunner is excited about the potential of having a healthy team.
"It seems like every center back coming in was
injured, from ACL tears to stress fractures to weak backs.
Our injured players will definitely add more depth to the
lineup when we get them back, which could be as soon as
early October," Brunner said. She is especially enthusiastic about this season, her fifth at the helm of the
Swarthmore women's soccer team, "The team is already
looking better than we were last year at this time. Our
experience has really helped in integrating the younger
players."
The Fifth Annual Swat Kick Classic Tournament
included the women's soccer teams from Swarthmore,
Widener University, Neumann College, and Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. On Saturday, the Garnet easily conquered the Knights of Neumann College in a 4-1 victory.
"We were excited to see how the team would perform in a
real situation and were extremely pleased with the
results," co-captain McCaffrey said. "We came out with a
lot of confidence which resulted in that first quick goal.
[Sarah's] goal was also exciting; she's going to be a huge
asset for us, along with the other five freshmen. They will

all play enormous roles."
On Sunday, the women were not as successful, losing a
well-fought 2-1 game to Widener. "We weren't ready for
Widener coming off of yesterday's game. We came out flat
in the first half and suffered as a result," Hobbs said.
Widener got off to an early lead with a goal from
Nicole Jones only five minutes into the game.
Swarthmore scored its only goal of the game at the 50minute mark when Lewis assisted Forbes in a wide-open
shot at the net. Forbes almost scored a second shot at the
goal that would have given Swarthmore the lead, but the
ball flew just outside the goalpost. With 28 minutes to go,
Widener's Laura Hughes scored what would be the winning goal for the Pioneers.
Despite the loss, Brunner was optimistic. "In the second
half, you could see a change in momentum toward and
around the ball, and we controlled the play better than
Widener," she said.
"Our motto for this season is 'Over the Top', which
refers to our goal of achieving a winning record this year,"
Hobbs said. "It's something that hasn't been done in ten
years and that we are committed to making a reality in
2002." With their performance this weekend in the Swat
Kick Classic, the Garnet certainly possess the potential to
achieve their goal. Catch them in action at their next home
game on Saturday, September 14, when they take on
Delaware Valley at 12 p.m.
