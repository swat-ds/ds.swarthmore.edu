Goundie leaves Dean's Office for Bates
Westphal steps up as associate dean of student life, leaving assistant dean position open
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

Tedd Goundie, the former associate
dean for student life, announced in midJune that he would accept a position as
Dean of Students at Bates College, leaving
Swarthmore with a high-level vacancy just
two months before students returned to
campus.
Instead of beginning a formal, national
search to replace Goundie, the administration decided to promote Myrt Westphal,
formerly Assistant Dean and Director of
Residential Life, to the position.
The college decided to perform an informal search, because Goundie accepted
Bates' offer so late in the summer. Unlike
the formal process, the searchdid not
include discussing the appointment with
Student Council, bringing outside candidates to campus or creating a formal hiring

body.

made the decision for] two reasons. One is that we would be seriously
compromised if we went through a semester without that position being filled,"
Dean Bob Gross '62 said. "The other reason
is that we felt we had an internal candidate
who was superbly qualified for the position."
Westphal has been working in the student life section of the Dean's office, which
"[We

freshman orientation, holds disciplinary
hearings and deals with other non-academic student concerns, for 15 years. She
served in her previous role as Director of
Residential

Life

and

Coordinator for

Disability Services since 1993.
Westphal's long tenure with the college
was the greatest reason why she was promoted to Associate Dean.
"I have real confidence in Myrt to pick
up the reigns," Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said. "When you know you
have people on your staff who are good,
experienced, committed, you want the
option to post the job in a limited way
[internally] rather than a broad way," he

said.

Eldridge added that he

"It was where I was in my own career,
my family. I was not doing a hardcore
search. When Bates invited me to look at
the college I didn't know how interested I
would be, but when I came I thought it
would be a good fit. I just wanted a new
adventure," he said.
Goundie had been working in the
Dean's office since 1988, and had been the
Associate Dean for Student Life, since 1996.
Westphal officially took over for
Goundie on Aug. 1, but the college has not
yet found a replacement for the position

she is vacating.
"There will be a more open search" for a
new assistant dean, Gross said. "We have
more time to go through a process."
Gross said he hoped that the position
would be filled by late fall, when housing

Westphal would have been given the job
even if it had been open to a national

Bates posted the job opening in March
and offered the job to Goundie in midJune. "I'd have preferred that it didn't
happen so quickly, but I certainly kept the
people that needed to know in the loop,"
Goundie said.
Still, the decision to leave, was one

time. "I decided I wanted to be on senior
staff and report to the president," Goudie
said. "I wanted to try a new place, to take

In the meantime, Westphal is both

Students return to disruptions from Parrish renovations
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

During the slow, quiet months of summer, the $13.6
million renovation of Parrish began, and it will continue through the entire school year.
After only two months of work, students can expect

to find large-scale changes to the building's interior
structure and a shuffling of student services. Most projects will not be completed until September 2005.
Students living in Parrish can expect substantial
disruption, with construction scheduled from 7:00 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. "Parrish students
should expect noise," project coordinator Susan Sayer

said.

Currently many corridors in Parrish are narrowed
by temporary partitions separating students from construction workers.
Parrish Parlours, the lounge areas in the center of
the building, have been converted into on-site headquarters for the management firm overseeing construction.

The two central stairwells are both now off-limits

due to asbestos cleaning, and the Community Resource
Center on the second floor will soon be as well.
The Admissions Office has relocated to 3 and 5
Whittier Place, which was the temporary location of
the math department that is now in the Science

Center.

After the renovation, admissions will be located on
the second and third floors; a student lounge and new
post office will be created on the ground level.
The studios of WSRN have temporarily moved to
Parrish Third North, formerly student dorms, and students searching for the ATM will find it to the right of
Kohlberg Coffee Bar.
For students living in Parrish, lounges and public
computers have been installed in rooms 300, 400 and
40L Only demolition is taking place right now, though
later in the year students might have to contend with
odors, Sayer said.
"Living in the building won't be an easy thing this

THE PHOENIX

year," said Larry Schall 75, vice president of facilities.
One benefit will be a refurbished electrical system
and freshly-painted rooms
at least for the women's
side. "We've known for a long time that Parrish's electrical systems hadn't met contemporary students'
needs," Sayer said, and eventually upgrading the entire

building's wiring is a high priority.
Jim Bock '9O, dean of admissions, adopted a longterm perspective about Parrish's residents.
"I'm sure they're weary," Bock said, "but I think
they realize the benefits to themselves and future gen-

erations."
Bock oversaw the summer's most ambitious relocation project of the Admissions Office to short-term
quarters in 3 and 5 Whittier Place.
The location is "a nice place to be temporarily for
the year," Bock said. Admissions has more space in the
new location, and can use the Science Center's lecture
halls for large visiting crowds.
Alex Flurie, the general manager of WSRN, was not
as upbeat about the radio station's move. "I'm disappointed that WSRN had no input on how the floor plan
of its space was redesigned," he said. "They made
some changes that I would not have made, such as the
removal of Studio B, the studio used for more technical shows and recording."
Flurie does not, however, expect broadcasting to be

delayed by the move.
Despite beginning a few weeks late, the project is
still on budget and on time, said the construction firm's
project manager, Amy Novak."The challenge with the
project is the age of the building," she said.
A renovation process in a historic building like
Parrish will often lead to unexpected discoveries in a
building's internal structure
such as a previouslyunknown and cumbersome water tank discovered this

summer in Parrish's attic.
Despite the improvements and renovations, Schall
said the college is taking care to preserve the historic
nature of the building.
"We're being very careful not to end up with a building out ofParrish's character," Schall said.

Despite previous delays, new dorm opens on time
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu
Students living in the new residence
hall need not worry about temporary
housing when they return to campus.
"We are 'all systems go' for the
expected opening on Aug. 27," said Myrt
Westphal, associate dean for student life.
But, according to Westphal, students
living in the new residence hall will still
encounter minor inconveniences until
fall, break.
"During the first month, there will be
noise, a bit of confusion, and work outside," she said.
During the spring, inclement weather
and the unpunctual arrival of building
material threatened to delay the entire
completion of the dorm, making smaller
inconveniences
seem insignificant in
comparison.

"We lost at least one day each week to
rain," said Director of Facilities Stuart
Hain.

Fortunately, due to the construction
firm's effective planning, construction

was completed on time. The construction

crew's extensive overtime work also
helped.
Hain said the college paid workers
roughly $lOO,OOO in overtime pay, including a second shift working past dusk.
Though not budgeted, this overtime was
within budget because the contract cost
less than anticipated.
But the rush to complete construction
does come with compromises, too. "Since
we've been working so fast, there will still
be some contractors working out the bugs
in September," Hain said.
The most notable of these "bugs" is the
lack of closet doors in the residence hall's
eight handicap-accessible rooms, including all three RA rooms. In addition, the
six two-room lofts will eventually have
electric shades similar to those in the
Science Center. These have yet to be completed; currently, these rooms have temporary shades.

"These are small inconveniences, of
course," said Hain. "The only hassle will
be when workers need to put in the closet
doors and replace the shades."
"I'm personally not too worried about
it," said Stephanie Losq 'O5. "It will be
worth it to live there."
Losq, who will be an RA on the first
floor of the dorm, said that students living
in the new dorm have been in direct contact with Hain as the dorm's opening date
approaches, and will continue to be notified of potential disturbances.
According to Hain, moving in will be
the greatest difficulty faced by students
living in the new residence hall.
Since no road or walkway leads to the
building, students will have to park at the
Benjamin West House, and will be provided with carts to transport their belongings to the dorm.
Workers will be finishing the lounges
and the walkway to the building in
September, Hain said.
In addition to the lounges and walkway, the surrounding grounds also
remain

of
uncompleted.
Grounds Jeff Jabco said most of the landscaping work will take place in the
spring.

Jabco worked in conjunction with
engineering professor Carr Everbach on
the design of the dorm's vegetated roof,
which was planted last week.
The roofs purpose is to slow and purify the flow of rain water coming off the
building and to cool the building as well.
The vegetated roof is currently viewable

Although landscaping and some interior details still need to be completed, the new residence hall will open without delay.

from the second floor of the building's

two-room lofts and will eventually be visible from the front steps of Parrish once
the garden fills in.
"I'm very excited about it, and I know
the students will be too," said Westphal.
"It's gorgeous."
The new residence hall still remains
unnamed, and according to Westphal
there are no curent contenders for a title.
"It could be called 'the new dorm' for a
while," she said.

First years describe orientation activities as 'childish'
go hang out in historical Philadelphia."

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

The 2004 Orientation Committee decided
that less is more when it comes to helping
first years settle into college life while organizing activities for this year's orientation.
"Last year, they had activities every
afternoon and night, carnivals, coffee houses, the stuff on the beach, movies, parties, et
cetera. This year, we tried to have one big
activity and one movie each night, so freshmen will be more overwhelmed and have
clear choices," Orientation Committee Head
Matt Meltzer 'O6 said.
The impetus for this shift was suggestions from campus advisors. "When we had
CAs apply, we asked them what we thought
of their own orientations. A lot felt too taxed
by it," Meltzer said.
An added benefit of the trimmed-down
schedule is that the Orientation Committee
is under budget this year. At the time of publication, the committee had spent less than
five thousand dollars, according to Meltzer.
The orientation budget is typically about six
to seven thousand dollars, but the committee
usually goes over. The 2002 and 2003 orientations cost about ten and eight thousand dollars, respectively.
The Orientation Committee is also trying
to encourage students to utilize resources
outside of Swarthmore. "In my speech, I'm
trying to stress the fact that being at Swat is
great, but you sometimes need to get out in
order to maintain clarity, and people should

Alcohol will still be prohibited during orientation this year. "Orientation is supposed

to be dry," Meltzer said. "We're enforcing
that, but we'll have to see what happens."
The event has been dry since 2001, when a
student had to be hospitalized for alcohol
poisoning, according to the Phoenix. Since
then, there have been no major problems
with alcohol consumption among first years
during orientation.
"I'm not sure that a dry orientation is
necessarily a good idea," Gregory Jehle 'OB
said. "I could go either way on it, but most
freshmen seem to be making their own parties anyway."
Despite the efforts of the committee, some
first years still feel that the overall climate of
orientation still leaves something to be
desired.
"I wanted more straight forward information," Renee Sevier 'OB said. "It's sort of
cheesy and childish. There are too many
name games."
"I think orientation is good, but there
could be more activities to fill up the downtime," Jehle 'OB said.
"I think it gets better as it goes on, and we
get to know people more," Ben Bradlow 'OB

said.
Elizabeth Bierut 'OB said she thought orientation was very well-intentioned, though
she had other concerns.
"I don't know how to dial out on my
phone or what number to give people from
home. I can't figure out how my internet

Some first-years found orientation activities, such as riding a mechanical bull, to be less
than inspiring.

works. I feel like we need more practical
information," she said.
Some students liked the additional time.
"I wind up having about an hour to kill
every day, but I don't mind. I've been finding things to do. Yesterday I found a poker
game in Mertz lounge, and there was nothing I would have rather done," Travis Allen

'OB said.

"I like having downtime," Giannina
Esquivel 'OB agreed.
367 first years arrived on campus for the
"Home on the Range" themed orientation on
Tuesday, Aug. 24. Large events included an

Outback-themed DU party and a carnival on
Parrish beach featuring a mechanical bull.

Don't forget the shower shoes
BY DANA SEAY
dseayl@swarthmore.edu

Welcome to Swarthmore, the land that conformist fash-

ion forgot.

Living outside of the law of fashion, students have reck-

lessly abandoned the Vogue Bible and ventured into the
style wilderness alone, unafraid. Some reach enlightenment, while others become style heathens, cast into a fashion limbo, a no-man's land of jeans and hooded sweaters.
How do you fit in to this unfamiliar territory where
boys sport capes and girls don butterfly hair clips with

no ironic intent? The answer is amazingly simple: You're
free to wear whatever you want. Be as flamboyant and
daring in your dress as your imagination allows, or put
as little thought into your wardrobe as you do in the
state of Jennifer Lopez's love life. The choice is yours,
with no social repercussions. Personally, I prefdr the
first option. Why not try something new? No one will
judge, and you may learn a thing or two about your inner
Madonna.

Take the opportunity to plunder the depths of your fashion soul. Dressing in a fashion vacuum provides for deeply
shallow musings, reflections on the meaning of style. For
example, what is the sound of one earring dangling? If you

don a Juicy Couture sweat suit but no one knows what
Juicy Couture is, does it make a fashion statement? To
dress up or not to dress up, that is the question.
For those of you requiring firmer fashion ground on
which to stand, here are a few pieces I could not imagine
life at Swat without. Sweat pants play a pivotal role in
every student's wardrobe. We Swatties value our comfort.
Don't fight it, give in to frumpy chic. Also high on my list

of must have items are a hip pair of oversized sunglasses.
There are countless uses for this fashion staple. They
make the walk of shame look like a walk down the catwalk,
they're your hangover's best friend, they let you partake in
Sharpies people watching in style, and are generally good
for retaining mystique. Grab a few pairs.
Similarly, I would suggest girls invest in a good mascara and eyeliner. It will make you look more awake after
those all-nighters, and when applied liberally, a dark and
smudged eye will proclaim to the world that the lack of

Finally, I must mention the all important shower shoes.
Don't try to be hardcore and skip these. Fuzzy accents and
the color green are trendy for fall, but not for your feet.
Clothing, while necessary, is nothing serious, and at
Swarthmore college we recognize this simple truth. No
matter what you choose to wear, have fun doing it. Don't
be afraid to be yourself and make a statement.

men and women looked to orientation, not
as a chance to find the library or dining

seeing the famous sites of the Old World
and baseball games in the newer one. For
me, college was something completely
outside of my comfort zone.
During orientation week, I spent
hours upon hours meeting new people.
Those of us living on Willets First stayed
up until the sun came up talking about
our lives, our philosophies and our
dreams. But after orientation, we firstyears were left to fend for ourselves. As

the workload grew and the free time
diminished, I found myself rarely meet-

ing new people, and it wasn't until the
following spring and even the fall of my

second year here that I really found my

niche.
Oftentimes, during those first few
months, I often felt overwhelmed. The
terrorist attacks on my hometown of
New York City had a profound effect on
me, and I found it difficult to break the
bubble into which students here enter
once classes start.
Now, as I face the last year of my academic life at the college, I am not filled
with regrets. I've made some great
friends and I've had some great experiences. I do however find myself looking
back, wondering how my time here
would have turned out if I knew then
what I knew now.
For starters, explore Philadelphia.
The fifth-largest city in the United States
is a quick train ride or shuttleride away,
and there's no reason to stay out of the
city. Over the course of the semester,
many students fall back on their routines. They stick to their rooms; they
stick to their Paces parties. But Philly
has a lot to offer. It has a vibrant theater
scene, prime concert venues, and a ton of
restaurants for every occasion (and price
range). While it might be easier and
cheaper to stay on campus for a Saturday
night, take advantage of the city every
now and then.
Outside of the Philadelphia experience, my advice is to expand your friendships as the year goes on. During orientation, first-years make friends with people on your hall and people you meet in
your CA groups. In the end, you might
end up spending the next four years trying to get away from these people. It's OK
to go up to people randomly in Sharpies
in October, sit down and introduce yourselves to them. It's OK to join groups or
participate in activities that your hallmates are avoiding. As cliched as it
sounds, college really is the best time in
your life to try out new things, and you
first days, weeks and months away from
home can provide you with just that

opportunity.
Finally, unplug. So many people on
campus spend hours online or in front of
their Play Station 2 consoles. Get out of
you room. Become active. Find a Philly
art exhibit. Take a walk in the Crum.
That is, after all, what Swarthmore is all
about.

Getting in the Swarthmore 'Spirit'
A look at the three spectral forces who guide Swarthmore students
You didn't hear about them
on the campus tours. They
weren't on the Web site. But if
you lie down on Parrish Beach
and close your eyes you can
sometimes hear them thundering in the skies above.

An epic battle is raging over
our college, a battle between
three great spirits who laid
their claims to this moory
swarth of grass well before the
first stones of Parrish were
sunk into the ground. They
pull and grapple at every new
first-year student, waging a
war for hearts and minds and
ambitions. No one escapes the
spirits and neither will you.
Meet Lucretia Mott, the
Spirit of Activism. Her middle

name is Coffin, which seems
appropriate for someone dead.
She was the quintessential radical when she was alive, preferring to spend her time whisk-

ing slaves to the north, launching the campaign for women's
rights, and founding the leading activist organization of the

abolition movement. In her little spare time she also helped
found Swarthmore College.
Lucretia was a remarkable
woman, and she's an even
more impressive ethereal spirit, with a profound hold over
this school. She chose to
change the world by going out
and doing just that, and her
whispers in the Magill oaks
have inspired Swattie after
Swattie to follow in her footsteps. I would speculate that
nowadays she wears henna
and shades of brown, yet ironically her influence makes
Swarthmore too politically correct for such presumption.
But Lucretia isn't the only
spirit in the sky. Meet Joseph
Wharton, Spirit of Power and
another Swat founder. Mighty
Joe made his mark by looking
out for himself first and others
later. It's not that he's a bad
quite the opposite.
spirit
Back when he wasn't pushing
up the daisies, he was a philosopher, poet and big-time philanthropist with a strong moral
compass. He felt that his contribution to the world would be
greatest if he could first become
powerful and then use his

power for good. So while his
own path to power was lined
with greenbacks (at one point
he produced one-sixth of the
world's nickel), Mighty Joe has
guided Swatties along all the
manifold paths to power and
influence: politics, law, busi-

ness, celebrity.

Joe and Lucretia probably
got along fine in the 1800s, but
as you can imagine they have a
bit of a vendetta these days.
(You can't hear them going at it
all the time only because
Quaker spirits fight quietly.)
Joe and Lucretia's vendetta
is not about whose goals are
nobler: like most everyone at
Swat, Joe and Lucretia are correct
erm
liberal in their
beliefs. Instead, it's about

whose method of changing the
world works better. With only
so many hours in the day,
Swatties are often faced with a
choice between bettering the
world right now and bettering
themselves for future endeavors (that is, resume-building).
Spirit Joe says that the world is
a decreasingly malleable place,
with grassroots change becoming harder. Placing smart, ethical people Swatties into positions of political and legal
power is becoming more important, he says. He might be right.

Unfortunately, Ben is an
alluring bastard of a spirit.
He's very good at convincing
Swatties that academic pursuits are all that matter (along
with such distractions as
Dungeons & Dragons). If you're
not careful, he'll seduce you
away from the other two spir-

its, and you won't even notice.

spirits' tug-of-war is not to neglect any one of them. If you're

toward
Lucretia, take Introduction to
Economics lest you become
what I call a blind liberal.
Think seriously about what
you want to be doing in 20
years given your goals for
yourself and the world, and be
ambitious about getting there.
Make sure you assemble the
credentials to put your beliefs
into effect, and be wary of getting drunk on the sea of opportunities for activism on campus, because imbibing too
much of a good thing can have
an untenable opportunity cost.
(It can also give you quite the
headache, but I'll leave that for
you to learn after your first
Paces party.)
If you're most sympathetic
toward Joe, I presume you're
largely a social-science kind of
person. Make sure you don't
lose sight of the ideals that presumably make you a Swattie,
and take science classes so that
you're prepared for the future.
Crucially, start planning now
for next summer's internship
because, as an Aug. 9 article in
The Times pointed out, the
most important step toward
landing your dream job or graduate school (besides grades) is a
record of competitive, usually
unpaid, internships.
And if you feel geeky Ben
grasping you too tightly, look
around. Take a stroll through
Chester, a glance at footage
from Sudan or a look at the current U.S. president. The world
needs help, and although Ben is
important and wise, he sometimes needs Lucretia and Joe to
smack him around.
Above all, welcome to
Swarthmore. The three spirits
make it unique, and, from
what I've observed, the Class of
2008 is fully prepared to channel them.

Chicks dig
the long ball
First-years wandering around lost on campus, horrible
as soon as parents leave, adjusting to not
having air conditioning, and oh yeah, class. While all these
things mark the beginnings of another normal fall at
Swarthmore, this upcoming semester is different. This
Sharpies food

year presents a once-everyfour-years opportunity to

follow the great happenings in our country and,
perhaps, to change the
things that are fundamentally wrong with America.

That's right, it's an election year, complete with
anti-Bush, pro-Kerry, and
the occasional anti-Nader
rallies, bad political ads and
tense political debates over
hot button issues between
the stacks in McCabe.
However, this year could

be and should be different.
p At the behest of my boss,
l've taken the time to thoroughly research the stances
ofboth candidates and come up with a viable political opinion piece for the Orientation week issue:
I'm voting for Ken Griffey Jr. That's right, Griffey in 2004.
Now before you write me off as a total idiot, let me just
say this: not only does Griffey have the experience to lead
our nation, he is also an experienced campaigner and
leader. He's a man who has weathered media firestorms
before, and knocked in 501 home runs in his 14-year Major
League career. No other candidate can claim that. In fact,
George W. and John Kerry combined haven't event hit a
single dinger. To make matters even worse for the two
leading candidates, neither has a batting average over .300.
How do you expect them to lead our country in times of crisis with numbers like that?
Furthermore, Ken Griffey Jr. is no stranger to the campaign trail. He ran for president under the Nike ticket back
in 1996 but was disqualified by the establishment because, at
27 years old, he was "too young" to become president.
Although he was winning almost 98 percent of the vote at the
polls, he bowed out, or at least I assume he was that close to

First-years mingle with their upperclass teammates during a preseason lunch in Sharpies.

Welcome to Swat. Start running.
Before classes even start, first-year athletes must survive preseason
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
Preseason. The word brings to
mind different things for different
people. For fall sports coaches, it's
the beginning of a new season: setting goals, planning four hours worth
of practice a day and occasionally listening to teams grunt and moan
through wind sprints. For veteran
fall athletes, the word evokes memories of sweat, heat and humidity, an
early return to a near-empty campus
and conditioning testing. But for the
first-year athletes, Swarthmore pre-

season is simply a word lacking context, meaning and memory. What
exactly is the first-year preseason

experience? Do the veterans remember what their first time was like?
In most cases, all a first-year student knows is that he must come to
college before the rest of his class
and jump into an established sports

team of experienced upperclass students. Adding the pressure of conditioning tests and ridiculously humid
conditions does little to relieve the

athlete.
Practices are long and the challenges are many. One of the main
hurdles is the transition from high
school to Division 111 college sports.
Men's soccer player J.P. Faunes 'OB
acknowledged that preseason has
been a lot tougher than his expectations. Most fall sports coaches organize some sort of conditioning test,
such as a timed mile.
"I was really nervous about fitness testing in the beginning. I was
nervous about being the last one,"
Rachel Turner 'OB, a first-year field
THE PHOENIX

hockey player said. Turner's fears
were alleviated, however. "It worked
out fine. Everyone was really supportive." Turner especially noticed
the way the team worked together.

"We all have strong points, and we
try to embrace them."
In addition to enduring preseason
conditioning test rituals, first-years
inevitably compare the college expe-

rience to their high school team from
which they have just come. Turner
notices that "the attitude of everyone
is so much more focused [compared
to high school]. Here, for example,

we did an exercise where we were in
groups, and each group would pull
out a number of drills from an envelope. Some groups ended up with
more drills, but those who had less
kept going, making up drills to do so
that everyone was working out
together."

Turner was impressed that the

girls wanted to do more work to support and encourage their teammates,
a striking contrast to the high school
level. "In high school, everyone
would have just rested."

The coaches of fall sports must
also find ways to deal with issues
that arise with the influx of new,
younger players.
"The freshmen have a big adjustment to make. Perhaps the biggest
issue is that they are two months out
of high school playing four years
above their heads," men's soccer

coach Eric Wagner said. "The freshmen jump into a new scene where
the "the people who set the tone are
the juniors and seniors on the team,
and the freshmen have to look up to
that level of guys two and three years

older, when just a few months ago,
they were setting the tone for
younger guys on their high school
teams." In order to address these
issues, Wagner tries to "put [the firstyears] into situations where they can
show us what they've got technically
without trying to intimidate them
too much."
Another issue that coaches run
into is the adjustment new studentathletes must make to college, where
"demands to know everything about
college right away leads to limited
focus, so new players are going to
make mistakes and be less consistent
and stable than more experienced
players," said Wagner.
Nevertheless, first-year athletes
"have no preconceived notions and
no biases about teammates or the
teams they are playing against. They
come in fresh, giving and unbiased
point of view and a good perspective," Wagner said. The fresh talent
also "pushes the upperclassmen to be
better to get time in games," Wagner
said.
Soccer player Colton Bangs 'O7,
having gone through the first-year
preseason experience last August,
said, "It was nice to come early and
get to know people before everyone
arrived; it makes you feel like you
can call people if you need help.
Preseason is definitely hard, but it is
necessary to compete in the conference." Bangs appreciated the necessity of preseason by the time conference play started. "It is a shock going
into conference play and realizing
how much better it is than high
school. Preseason helps to bridge the
gap."

winning the presidency.

I'm voting for Ken Griffey Jr. That's
right, Griffey in 2004.
Since his last presidential candidacy, Mr. Griffey has
slugged almost 263 home runs, which is exactly 263 more
home runs than his opponents. Furthermore, in spirit with
the other two major campaigns, I propose that Mr. Griffey
name Barry Bonds as his running mate for the oval office,
since both other candidates have controversial running
mates and it seems to be the fashionable thing to do.
Compared to JohnEdwards and Dick Cheney, Barry Bonds
looks like a proverbial saint (minus the steroid and asshole factor), and it seems to be the fashionable thing to do

to name a controversial running mate, so why not Barry
Bonds?
On a serious note, if elected the Griffey/Bonds ticket
would have an unprecedented advantage in home run derbies that decide international policy issues, and since Mr.
Bonds is jacked up on steroids there's not a single world
leader who wouldn't be intimidated by our foreign policy
choices. Who's going to mess with a two-hundred-fifty-pound
dude? Certainly not North Korea.
Ultimately, the Griffey/Bonds ticket is a surefire winner
in this upcoming presidential election. No other choice has
slugged over 1,000 combined home runs, not 1,000 dead troops
in foreign wars. Griffey/Bonds in 'O4. A torn hamstring, not
a war-torn country.
Because hey man, chicks dig the long ball.

Chambers appointed as Assistant Athletic Director
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu

This summer the Swarthmore Athletics
Department added a fresh face to administration with the appointment of Assistant
Athletic Director, Christyn Chambers. In
her new position, Chambers will over see
the club sports program, Student Athletic
Advisory Committee as well as the management of the athletic facilities.

Growing up in Cincinnati, Chambers

became involved in numerous sports at a
young age. Her talent and experience in
soccer led her to Washington University in
St. Louis where she made an immediate
impact on the team. A four-year letter winner and 2001 graduate for the Bears,
Chambers earned all-region honors 1997,
1998, 2000; all-American honors in 1998 and
the team MVP award for three consecutive
years starting in 1998. But above her accolades, Chambers notes the bonds with her
teammates as the most rewarding part of
her collegiate sports experience.
"I enjoyed playing very much because
of the camaraderie, friendships, competition, exercise, and simple love of the
game," she said. "We were a very successful team and I was personally successful,
and feel definitely grateful to be a part of
that success."
Uncertain about her future career, the
anthropology major decided to pursue a
Masters in Exercise and Sports Sciences. "I
knew that once my soccer career was over
at Wash. U, I wanted my soccer career
over, so I needed a plan," Chambers said. "I
had worked within the Wash. U. athletics
department, knew the Assistant AD and
the AD very well and loved what they did.
Wanting to stay involved with college athletics, not wanting to coach, and wanting to
be in the decision-making process all were
reasons that pushed me in the direction of
college athletics administration."

At the UNC-Chapel Hill program,
Chambers focused on the administrative

aspects of college athletics. Finding that
she liked the work, set her eyes on the position of college or university athletic direc-

tor.
Swarthmore Athletic Direction Adam
Hertz and members of the athletic department began a nation-wide search for an
assistant AD last spring. "There were nearly 250 applicants in the pool," he said. "A
five-person search committee reviewed
resumes, deliberated qualifications and
narrowed
the pool
of candidates.
Eventually, four were brought to campus
for interviews."
Hertz added, "We liked the fact that she
did her undergraduate work at an institution with high academic regard. Christyn's
experience there as a student athlete, as
well as a worker in the athletic department, we thought, prepared her well for the
position here. Christyn was a unanimous
choice."
Chambers, who had found out about the
Swarthmore position through a third party
in contact with Hertz, was looking to work
at a school with a strong commitment to its
student-athletes.
"I wanted to be an athletics director,
preferably at an institution that holds academics with as high if not higher regards
than athletics," she said. "That was the culture from which I had come and I loved
every moment of it."
Swarthmore offered an athletic-academic balance that appealed to Chambers.
"The commitment the student-athletes
must have both on and off the field [and]
court is incredible," she said. "Swarthmore
has that academic component and is heading down the path to the athletics component. I want to be here to continue the push
in that direction."
In addition to overseeing the club sports
program and SAAC, Chambers hopes to

Christyn Chambers, former Division 111 soccer player at WUSTL, will be in charge of
SAAC, the club sports program and the facilities.
further work on Swarthmore facilities
rental policy. "In order to maintain the
fields and courts for our varsity sports,
club sports, IM sports, recreational use,
when we grant other outside organizations
and groups use of our facilities, we must
stay mindful of the cost of maintenance."
Ultimately, Chambers' love of sports

and experience in athletic administration
will bring positive and beneficial changes
to the department. But although her
upcoming tasks maybe large, Chambers
does not forget the athletes whom she will
be supporting. "If I can serve as an example
of what can be achieved within sport and
through sport, that is a reward."
