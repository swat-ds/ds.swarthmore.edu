Applications this year
drop by 4.8 percent
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Applications for admission dropped by
4.8 percent, or 193 applicants, this year. The
decrease included 100 fewer international
applicants, according to Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O.
"Part of that actually might have to do
with the ranking," Bock said. "Rankings
matter more internationally, so moving from
two to three could have had an effect. We
think that rankings matter more in the
international realm because of access and
knowing the college."
In the most recent U.S. News & World
Report's survey of the best colleges,
Swarthmore was ranked third among liberal
arts schools, behind Williams and Amherst.
A total of 3,752 students applied to the college, down from last year's 3,945. This year,
885 applicants were accepted to yield a class
of 370.

"Rankings matter more
internationally, so moving
from two to three could
have had an effect."
Jim Bock '9O
dean of admissions
Director of International Recruitment

Jessica Bell declined to comment on the
decreased number of international applicants.
Comparatively, other liberal arts colleges

fared better. Amherst recorded its second
highest number of applications this year,
just two to three percentage points shy of
last year's high of 5,631, according to
Amherst Admissions Fellow Sarah Miller.
Williams saw a 7 percent increase in
applications this year, bringing the total to

5,707. In addition to increased overall applications, Williams saw an 8 percent increase
in its early decision pool, causing the school
to admit 40 percent of its class as early decision rather than the typical 35 percent,
according to Director of Admissions Richard
Nesbitt.
At Swarthmore, early decision applications barely rose, with just 7 more applicants
creating a total of 310 . Of the early decision

pool, 142 students were admitted.
"A lot of this has to do with image and
visibility," Bock said. Amherst and Williams

"have some of what Swarthmore doesn't. We
have to get out Swarthmore's image."
applications
Despite
fewer
to
Swarthmore, the quality of applicants has

remained constant.
According to Bock, objective qualifica-

tions like GPA and test scores were the same
as those from previous years.
As a matter of policy, Bock declined to
comment on the distribution of SAT.
Of the admitted students who come from
high schools that report class rank, 27 percent are valedictorians or salutatorians.
Fifty percent are in the top 2 percent of their
high school class, and 91 percent in the top
decile, according to Bock.
The number of Asian-American applicants increased by 6 percent this year, while
other minority applicants remained constant, Bock said.
The waiting list also included more applicants than in past years because Admissions
was unsure of how newly designated early
action programs at Stanford and Yale would
affect the number of students who enroll at
Swarthmore.
In the past, the yield of admitted students
has been around 40 percent, according to
Bock.
"What I can't predict is whether we're
going to yield high or low, how effective our
admitted students Web site will be, or how
effective the Ride the Tide program will be,"
Bock said.
Fifty-seven percent of the admitted students come from public high schools, 28 percent from private independent schools, 8 percent from parochial schools, and 7 percent
from schools overseas, Bock said.
Admissions will make a few changes to
attract more students. The admitted students Web site has been revamped to include
outtakes from the recent filming of 26 students being interviewed in the Parrish
Ballroom.
Swarthmore is also extending travel
assistance for Ride the Tide to all groups
demonstrating financial need, not just
minorities, as has been the case in previous
years. "People say [they] really would like to
see Swarthmore but can't afford to visit, and
we're able to say yes to that each year for a
handful of students," Bock said.
Ride the Tide will be held April 21-23.

Franzen speaks to packed crowd
Students jammed the Lang Performing Arts Center cinema Wednesday night

Cooper Foundation and the English department, sold out in only a few hours.
"It's the fastest any [Cooper Foundation] event has sold out," English professor

In addition to the reading, Franzen met with students in the Scheuer Room
yesterday afternoon. He recalled the time he received a C+ on his first paper'

Evans scholars injured in car crash
A vehicle filled with Swarthmore Evans Scholars on their way back from dinner was in a multi-vehicle accident at 6:16 last night, prompting the medical
evacuation by helicopter of one student. There were no fatalities. One is in critical, but stable, condition, according to Worth nurse practioner Jerri Cole.
Other students were injured but awake and alert. They were taken to the
Springfield and Crozer Chester Medical Center hopsitals.
Public Safety Lieutenant Herb Barron said the accident had occurred about
two blocks from campus at the intersection of Chester Road and Oakdale. The
vehicle was returning to campus. Barron said he did not know the extent of the
injuries but that the police had made no arrests on the scene. Public Safety
was providing site security, and the deans had been notified and were present.

Decision in SAC funding bylaw delayed until fall
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

A Student Council initiative to
allow the Student Affairs
to fund political
events has been put on hold until
next semester.
Committee

Debate over whether SAC can
give money to political events has

raged between Student Council
and the committee throughout
the semester. The council has

been

looking into changing the

bylaw that prevents SAC from
funding political events.
SAC would prefer that SACfunded events remain restricted
to recreation. Political campus
THE PHOENIX

groups cannot go to SAC for funding because their events are considered to promote an ideology.
According to Student Council

Co-President Emiliano Rodriguez
'O5, the council has the final voice
in decisions relating to SAC.
"SAC is a committee of
Student Council. Council, in its
constitution, cedes off funding
power to a few focused funding
committees, but as the constitution clearly states, SC has final
jurisdiction on all SAC affair," he
said in an e-mail.
"The current bylaw is operating on the assumption that political events do not have the capacity to be social events as well and

that they are inherently divisive,"
Student Council Co-President
Jyoti Gupta 'O5 said in an e-mail.
Gupta believes this is an erroneous assumption that underesti-

mates the students' abilities to
have intelligent discussions about
political issues in a social arena.
"We would like to see SAC's
role expand by allowing for more
diversity in the funding choices,"
Gupta said.
But SAC is not interested in
expanding its role at this point,
according to SAC Co-Director

Brandon Carver 'O4.
"While SAC agrees that [political and religious] groups should
be able to receive funds for study
April

X 2004

breaks and speakers, SAC does
not feel that these funds should be
allocated from SAC," Carver said

in an e-mail.
"Political and religious events
do not function as social events
that are ideologically open and
welcoming to the whole campus,"
he added. Carver suggested that
political and religious groups

seek study-break funding from
alternative venues such as Forum
for Free Speech or the Student

Activities Office
But Rodriguez argued that
changing the bylaw would be a
more logical solution, as it would
allow students to better utilize
SAC as the "umbrella" funding

organization it is meant to be.

"It
is another way of providing registered groups with access to some
funding
as well as enhancing
...

the diversity of events sponsored
by SAC," he said.
Rodriguez stressed that the
council had complete confidence
in SAC and was primarily interested in changing the structure of
the student bureaucracy, not in
micromanaging the committee.
"Changing this bylaw and
respecting the job that SAC does as
well as their autonomy in making
individual funding decisions are
not mutually exclusive," he said.

Parrish architects address staff concerns
Samples of the new paint, carpet and tiling
schemes were also on display, as well as the

BY CAROLINE GRUBBS
cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore staff got a preview yesterday of
how Parrish will look after renovation.
Representatives from the construction and
architectural firms renovating Parrish presented the plans and discussed logistics with
staff members.
"Everyone in the building will be impacted
in one way or another," Vice President Larry
Schall '75 said.

"We want it to feel as if you're
walking into a big, old,
historical house."
Sandra Vicchio
project manager
Project manager Susan Sayer had organ-

ized the meeting to provide information for
staff members. It was an opportunity to tell
the staff "where we are in the project," she
said.
Sandra Vicchio, project manager from the
Ayers Saint Gross architectural firm, presented the finished look of Parrish.
A central staircase leading up to the relocated Admissions Office represents one of the
primary architectural features. The hardwood
staircase will have a carpet runner and two
columns at its base.
It will be "decorative as well as functional," Vicchio said. "We want it to feel as if
you're walking into a big, old, historical
house."
Elevators will also be installed, although
not on the north side of Parrish due to "budgeting issues," Vicchio said.

final floor plan diagrams.
Chaz Riciardi, project manager from the
Skanska USA Building firm, said construction
would begin in June and finish by September
2005.
Parrish North will serve as the main base for
building, and construction vehicles will access
the site via Parrish Circle.
Barriers will be erected on the basement,

first and second levels to shield offices from con-

struction.
"The biggest challenge is noise," Riciardi
said.
Demolition in the fall will cause the greatest levels of noise but should be over by
October.
Only dorms close to the center of Parrish
will be significantly affected by noise. In the
dorms further east and west, "you won't even
know what's going on," he said. Riciardi
encouraged staff to notify him if noise became
unbearable.
Staff asked about parking space crunches

and hazardous air quality.
Riciardi said there would only be a peak of
30-40 people working on Parrish and that they
would use he back part of the visitor's parking
lot, not faculty and staff parking.
Air quality will be monitored continuously,
and Skanska will follow Environmental
Protection Agency guidelines for air quality.
Sayer presented Parrish staff members with

a schedule of when they would have to leave
their offices.

Office furniture will be inventoried beginning in June to make sure it will fit in the new
office spaces.

Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
is planning to schedule an informational meet-

ing next week for students considering picking
into Parrish to inform them about construction

issues before the

The council will continue to
draft some language for the
rule change and show it to the
college attorney, but it will hold
off attempting to approve a new

bylaw until next semester.
Council members want SAC
to be involved in the final decision-making process and do not
believe that will be possible

Columnists cut album
Death Row plans major tour for PanAfrican, liberal, anarchist hip-hop
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
gossip@news.sometimes
When The Phoenix hired Taru

Taylor 'O4, Patrick Hart 'O6 and Evan
Greer 'O7 as columnists, the staff never
dreamed that the three would team up
to realize a rap CD.
"The Drawing Board Gadflies'
Thoughtcrimes" will be out at the end
of April. The album, produced by
Death Row, features 12 tracks written

each of the columnists. Tracks
include "Everyday Revolution" by
Greer, "Where Did All the Deaniacs
Go?" by Hart, and Taru's "Resentful
Nation of Marginal Men."

stereotypes of such as Eazy-E and

shouts in his song, "So There,

Mao Zhedong quotation that "a revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an

Death Row executive Jake Rodham
admited that the sparse accompaniment and stark, arhythmic cadence of
refrains such as "If I'm being totally
honest with myself/I have to admit
that/If I could make gay marriage legal

on states' rights," from Hart's intro-

"Triangulation," are outside the scope

Nathalie Anderson
English professor
In a brief monologue at the opening
of the album, "When Hip-Hop Isn't
Funny," Taylor expressed the process
by which he came to organize the production of the album. "In the late 'Bos I
was a teenager. Eazy-E was executive
producer and Dr. Dre was producer of
pioneering group NWA, the template
for gangsta rap as we know it... Yet as
a scholarship student at Georgetown
Prep I wasn't one of the 'boyz in the
hood.'" Taylor described how his educational experiences would eventually
lead him to recruit his fellow colum-

of traditional hip-hop.
"I think this album has allowed us
to greatly increase our consumer
base," Rodham said. "Our albums are
often successful among the black community, and we have anarchist purchasers as well. However, we think this
album appeals to more members of the
LGBT community than our usual
releases have historically."
"I am especially impressed with
Taru's lyrics," English professor
Nathalie Anderson said. "I have the
quote 'Literacy is primarily about
denotation/Which enables the literati
to see/Through the haze and confusion/Emotions and hysterias Of connotation' stuck in my head.' The creativity of the rhyme scheme, the
rhythm and the assonance just blow
me away."

"First

Swarthmore, Then the World" campaign,
Eugene Lang '3B has donated enough money
to have both the Science Center and new
dorm named after him, bringing the total
number of buildings bearing his name to
five.
"After having a concert hall and a performing arts center named after me, I figured, 'Why not throw in the dough for a
Science Center and a dorm, too?'" Lang said
in an e-mail from his palatial home in
Malibu. When asked why he also did not

that. Well, I don't know what the

hell they do there besides send out countless
e-mails about solar cars. I just thought it
would be cool to buy a train station."
College administrators seemed pleased
with Lang's decision to donate the money.

particularly if it's from Mr. Lang, and we're
glad we no longer have to refer to the buildings as *new dorm' and 'Science Center' in

it makes us
look like a bunch of tools," President Al
Bloom said. "Plus, a longer name wouldn't
be able to fit on that marble slab in front of

the Science Center."
Students were generally indifferent and
apathetic about the new naming, but at least
one was affected. "My friend told me to meet
her in Lang, but I forgot to ask which one, so

I didn't know if I should meet her in the science center or the music building or LPAC
or her dorm or the train station," Dono
Wertago 'O4 said. "Needless to say, I completely missed our meeting, and she's
pissed."
Despite this confusion, Bloom said the
college is in the process of considering naming all college buildings after Lang because
"it's just easier that way." The college is
also thinking about canceling classes on
Lang's birthday to make the first and only
recognized holiday outside of designated
breaks.
The Board of Managers will take up
these issues at its next meeting in a dark,
secluded room. It is sure to dismiss any student input whatsoever during the decision
process.

Sharpies

will no

be serving

food, following a request by the Alarmed
Students of Swarthmore that the dining
hall be shut down. ASS had originally
planned an extensive campaign, including
signs, tabling and a petition, group president Cal Gregory 'O5 said.
But when Gregory and others e-mailed
Linda McDougall, director of Dining
Services, they were surprised at her unexpectedly prompt and positive response.
"The next day I got an e-mail from her
saying Sharpies would no longer be serving anything," he said. "Apparently our
strategy of 'asking nicely' paid off."
McDougall, who said the dining hall
had been well received by students in the
past, explained the primary consideration
in her decision as time.
"You pick your battles. It just wasn't
worth fighting for," she said. In fact,
Sharpies might have been closed down
long ago, but "no one ever asked us,"

McDougall said.
McDougall said she was not concerned
about the staff workers who previously
worked there, whom she said would "persevere." McDougall said she would be

with the college administration.
"I prefer to give them office supplies
over money anyway," she said. "I know
where the office supplies are going, but I
don'tknow where the money is going."

Students generally seemed unfazed by
the decision.
"Everyone always complains about
Sharpies food," Arin O'Carroll 'O7 said. "I
guess this is what they wanted."
Rory Mitchells 'O5 agreed. "It's certainly easier than a Student Council referendum," she said. "Plus, no one votes here
anyway."
In a memorial service Wednesday
afternoon, alumni gathered to reminisce
about drinking ice cream sodas and dancing the lindy-hop as young college students in Sharpies. Calling it the "psychological heart" of the college, George
Hamilton '65 bemoaned the loss of the dining

hall.

"I thought we'd be having our 50th
reunion at the pasta bar," Hamilton said.
"Now I don't know what to think."
McDougall said she had sold the
remaining food to Genuardi's and that all
meal credits had been transferred there.

pure passion, interest and curios-

advised the two students in their

undertaking.
"We're kind of just nerds,"
Holtz-Eakin said, laughing.
Fiedler said there is a lack of
knowledge about the political
views on campus and that too
many students simply think their
peers agree with them on various
issues. Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l agreed. "The assumption is that the college is a monolithic community of liberals," he
said. "I don'tbelieve it."

"Just as a token of appreciation,"
he said.

questions and a detectable liberal
bias.
"For some questions, I would
have preferred to put something

Joshua Berney 'O5 said ques-

In response to the student
feedback, which the pollsters welcome, Fiedler said that "there are

places to improve this [survey],

nature imperfect, he said, and he
and Holtz-Eakin are still learn-

Reeves said the surveys contain no bias or hidden agenda.
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin pulled

Washington Post and by institutions like Gallup Poll and the
University of Michigan, where
Reeves trained as a survey
researcher.

and
Fiedler,
Reeves emphasized the importance of consistency in their questions. By using questions that

have been answered on a national
level, they will be able to compare
the data from Swarthmore with
national numbers. Any differences could then be attributed to
differences in opinion and not to

the wording of the questions,
Fiedler said.
The process of creating the
survey involved months of debate
over the issues and questions that
would end up on the final prod-

uct.

Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin

worked
with
Director
of
Institutional Research Robin
Shores to ensure that the survey
would not conflict with current
research going on in the college.
Reeves also sent drafts to colleagues outside Swarthmore to
gather their input. In particular,
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin spent
considerable time controlling for
"context effect," or the influence
of the order of questions in
respondents' answers.
The survey was passed out to

226 students from each class, and
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin hope for
a 60 to 70 percent response rate.
Months of data analysis lay

ahead, during which the pollsters
will disaggregate the information
by demographics.
Preliminary results should be

mailed to students, and available
online, by this April. Final
results will be published in the

faU.
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin will
distribute copies of their data to

the administration and McCabe
so the information will be available to students or professors
doing research.

Reeves expects the two students to publish one or two
papers and possibly to present at

next year's conference for the
American Association for Public
Opinion Research.

in choosing rooms

BY CAROLINE GRUBBS

The noises of construction, familiar to Mertz residents, will be an
important factor for students considering living in Parrish next
year.
In a reserved-students e-mail reminding students of the upcoming housing lottery, Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
noted that those who wished to live in Parrish would have to contend with the noise of construction that will begin this summer.
"The constant and typical construction noise should be at a level
where you can talk on the phone
all of this work should occur
Monday-Friday," Westphal said in the e-mail.
...

Westphal said it was "hard to predict" whether the noise would
make Parrish an unpopular choice during the lottery.

"It would start at ridiculous hours, like 6
a.m. You learn to sleep through it."
Jorge Camacho 'O7
Mertz resident
"I would not be surprised if people pick other locations," she said.
She added that there could be more juniors than seniors picking into
Parrish singles because of the noise.
Noise is "certainly a factor" for Parrish resident Joshua Berney 'O5,
who is thinking about room choices next year. "I think the noise would
be very disruptive to student life. It could be very, very loud," he said.
The noise is "definitely going to affect whether I pick into Parrish,"
Parrish resident Stacey Prow 'O6 said. "I don't know how intensive the
noise will be, but it would be something I'd worry about."
Students in Mertz South have already had to live with construction noise from the new dorm this year. "It was a big problem last
semester," Jorge Camacho 'O7 said.
"It would start at ridiculous hours, like 6 a.m." Camacho said the
noise came mostly from trucks, jackhammers and workers yelling at
each other in "colorful" language. "You learn to sleep through it," he
said.
Lela Patrik 'O4, the RA of Mertz First South, complained about the
noise several times to Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie on students' behalf.
After her talks, construction ceased to begin quite so early,

Camacho said.
The noise has not been such a problem recently because students
have had their windows closed for the winter, Patrik said. "Once
people have to have their windows open, it's going to be more a problem," she said.
The noise did not affect all residents on the south end of Mertz, however. "I don't recollect it ever being a problem," Anna Belc 'O7 said.
The renovations to Parrish should be complete by the fall of 2005,
The Phoenix reported in January. Westphal expects construction
noise to be at its worst at the beginning of next semester.

College magazine now distributed to current students

BY TERESA KELLEY
tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu
In an effort to keep students
informed about the college, the

Publications Office distributed complimentary copies of the Swarthmore
College Bulletin in campus mailboxes this week.
The Bulletin has traditionally
been mailed to alumni, parents and
friends of Swarthmore domestically
and overseas. The decision to broaden

the magazine audience to current students was made last fall to encourage

students "to view Swarthmore as an
institution that you belong to that has
a life outside the campus," Director of
Publications Jeff Lott said.
Providing the campus with the
magazine was "not a budget buster,"
according to Lott. An extra 1,000
copies were added to the usual press
run of 23,700. The budget increase
amounted to about a dollar per copy,
he said.

Student reactions have been
mixed. Some are excited to gain a

better understanding of Swarthmore
as

an institution larger than the cam-

pus community. Others ignored the
magazine, along with the reservedstudents e-mail that announced its

In the mailroom, copies of the

Earthlust member Joe Alberti 'O6
said he was concerned about this
lack of interest and resulting waste.
He would like to see a "better solution" that would "eliminate the

Rather than being stuffed in personal mailboxes with the potential to
be ignored and discarded by students
with "a billion things to read," copies
should be available to interested students in public places, Alberti said.
Alberti said he was interested in
seeing Swarthmore from parents'
and alumni's perspectives as presented in the magazine and planned
to "peruse it while running on the

stair-stepper in the gym."
The magazine is 52 years old,
according to Lott, who has been editing the publication since 1992. "It's

other than that Swarthmore is a pretty great place," Lott said.
Lott said he was interested in
hearing student story ideas or reactions to the magazine. "We try to
keep it interactive," he said.

Students will receive the March
and September issues of the quarterly publication while on campus.

HIGHER

Bill would fund fifth-year studies
BY JOSH PONTRELLI
DAILY COLLEGIAN (PENNSYLVANIA
STATE U.)
(U-WIRE)

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.

A bill currently pending in the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives
would provide state funds to fifth-year
undergraduate students..
Currently, the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency only provides funds for students until their fourth
year unless their program is an approved
five-year program, said Bob Snyder,
Pennsylvania State University's director
of staff training and administrative services in the Office of Student Aid.
"From a school or student perspective,
it's good," Snyder said. "It would help
many students who look for ways to help
finance college education."
State Rep. Lynn Herman, R-Centre,
said students are staying in college longer
but are not getting appropriate financial

assistance.
"In speaking with students at Penn
State and other schools across the state, I
have found that due to a variety of rea-

sons that are beyond most college students' control, students need an additional semester or year of financial assistance
to obtain final credits and get a diploma,"
he said.
"With

dire economic constraints,
there is not money for new programs, but
this is worth a try," he said. "The concept
is sound, and it has received tremendous
support from the [Pennsylvania] House

Committee on Education."
The bill includes $ll million in additional funding for PHEAA that Herman

THE

PHOENIX

hopes to include in state budget negotia-

tions. "We don't want funds taken away
from current students, so we need to add
appropriations," he said.
According to the proposed law, the
years of study do not have to be consecutive, but if a student completes an undergraduate degree during a shorter time
period, he or she may not be eligible for
the remaining funds.
"Satisfactory academic standing, making normal progress toward completion
of the course of study and continued eligibility" determine if students will qualify for awards.

Howie Wu 'O7, a Penn State student in
political science and economics who
receives student loans from PHEAA, said
he thought the state could use higher education money in a different way.
"It's great that state government realizes the importance of education and that
they're willing to support it on students'
terms," he said. "However, if the people in

Harrisburg really wanted to help us out,
they'd provide more funding to Penn State
to keep tuition low for all students instead
of providing more grants for a few."
Keith New, PHEAA vice president for
communications, said the organization is
aware of the bill but cannot take a stance

on it.

"We don't get involved in policy makwe administer programs from the General Assembly at

ing," he said. "But

their discretion."

About 285,000 students request funds
from PHEAA each year, New said. Only
150,000 actually receive grants.
Over 80 state representatives and senators have co-signed the bill.

Federal bill to rate affordability
BY JEANNE CHAPIN
lOWA STATE DAILY (lOWA STATE U.)
(U-WIRE) AMES, lowa
If passed
by Congress, a proposed act could give
students disgruntled over perennial
tuition increases added leverage in
lobbying the state and university to
lower costs. It would also publish a list
of public and private institutions that

raise their tuition beyond a certain
rate over several years.
The federal act would give the gov-

ernment more authority and responsibility to pressure institutions of higher
education to provide affordable costs to
students for education.
Last March, U.S. Rep. Howard P.
"Buck" McKeon, R-Calif., proposed a bill
that would cut federal funding to universities if they unreasonably increased
tuition and fees for three years in a row
by more than double the Consumer Price
Index, a number most often used to indicate inflation rates, according to lowa
State Daily staff reports.
Other legislators saw the proposal as
counterproductive, because the more
funding that is cut from colleges, the
more students have to pay to make up
the deficit, lowa state Sen. Herman
Quirmbach, D-Ames, said.
"It's a very counterproductive idea,"
said U.S. Rep. Jane Greimann, D-Ames.
"The reason your tuition is going up
is because of cuts, not the other way
around," she said.
The bill has since become the
Affordability in Higher Education Act,

which instead of cutting federal aid

would publish an online "cost afford-

X 2004

ability alert" for colleges that increase
their costs by more than two times the
Consumer Price Index for three years in
a row, according to the U.S. House
Education

and

the

Workforce

Committee's Web site.
Colleges which increase costs twice

that of the Consumer Price Index for
three consecutive years will receive an
Affordability Index score of 2.0 or more.
An alert would be published in a
College Affordability Index and would

include detailed cost information
about the colleges to inform prospective students.

Beginning in 2008, colleges with an
Index score of 2.0 or more would be evaluated and will have to provide an explanation and an action plan to reduce costs.
If the college fails to meet its own
plan over two years, detailed cost information would be publicized, and the college would be given "cost affordability

alert" status.

How would Swarthmore rate?
in 2003, the Consumer Price
index rose 19 percent, while college tuition rose 4.5 percent.
Swarthmore would have received
an Affordabiiity Index of 2.3 for the
past year. If the college continued
to raise its tuition at the same rate
and the rate of increase in the CPI
remained constant, Swarthmore
would be required by the Department of Education to explain its
raises or risk being listed with a
"cost affordabiiity alert" designation.

Tattoos may
hinder hiring
BY KATHERINE KIRKPATRICK
DAILY TROJAN (U. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA)
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES

While standards of decorum

in some workplaces have relaxed, many employers and educators still recommend covering or removing body art,
including piercings and tattoos, when pursuing a job in the
professional world.
"First impressions are so significant to people," said Jim
Ellis, associate dean of Marshall undergraduate business
programs at the University of Southern California.
"So much of it depends on the magnitude of the body art,
and in today's environment, it certainly is more acceptable
if it is too great a percentage of the body or in the wrong
place, it will definitely impact the thought process of the hiring firm," Ellis said.
Having gained extreme popularity in the 19905, tattoos
and body piercings are now commonplace. Rampant in the
entertainment industry, body art is also visible across high
school and college campuses.

"If someone has a chain attached
from their nose piercing to their
ear and purple hair, they
wouldn't be hired."
Christine Hermosisma
Southern Calif, bookstore owner
More visible piercings such as tongue and nose piercings
have become trendy amongst college students. But some
University of Southern California employment profession-

als offer words to the wise.

"Our record shows that you should cover body art in a
job interview," said Eileen Kohan, executive director of the
USC Career Center. "Most companies aren't as open as you

Revelers get soaked for Holi
Students celebrated the advent of spring by
throwing colored water at each other on Parrish
beach.
The event was part of Deshi's annual celebration
of Holi, a traditional Indian spring festival that celebrates the triumph of good over evil. Color connotes
joy and happiness, and Holi has always signified the
coming of spring, according to Deshi President
Anisha Chandra 'O6.
About 45 students dumped water on each other,
until their faces and shirts were covered in dye.
"Everyone who took part had a lot of fun," organizer
Nabil Khan 'O7 said. According to Chandra, about
twice as many people turned up for Holi this year
than last year.
"It was wonderful!" she said in an e-mail. "We

used 50 packets of color, took lots of photos, and
had a ball on Parrish Beach. The administration was
amused, I am told. We tried hard not to dye the sidewalk; it was off-limits."
Holi was part of the International Club fair in front
of Parrish, which featured international food, music,
dancing and origami. Students were encouraged to
wear traditional costumes from their countries of origin.

The fair was part of Diversity Week, which culminated in the Sager Symposium. During the week, students discussed the role of diversity at Swarthmore,
participated in a multilingual slam, and ate a Middle
Eastern dinner provided in a Sharpies take-over by
Ruach and Students of Middle Eastern Descent.

think, and the expectation when dealing with customers is
professionalism."
The type of profession that a student intends to enter
should accommodate their first impression, Kohan
said."Always err on the side of conservatism," Kohan said.
"I would want to make sure that my potential employer's view of me was not affected," said Bill Cummings 'O5,
who is majoring in public policy and development.
Cummings has a tongue piercing and tattoos on his arm
and back.
"I would make sure my tattoos weren't visible in a professional job interview," Cummings said.
Other professions are not as stringent when it comes to
workplace conservatism.
"Pretty much anything goes," said Christine Hermosisma,
the manager of a Santa Monica, Calif., bookstore.
Hermosisma has multiple tattoos and piercings.
"It depends on how extreme it is," she said. "If someone
has a chain attached from their nose piercing to their ear
and purple hair, they wouldn't be hired. But in a bookstore,
in Los Angeles, standards are pretty relaxed."
Ellis, speaking for the business fields, warns that visible
body art might hinder potential jobs.
"It is an exceptionally competitive environment for
jobs, and one needs to think about all aspects of how he or
she presents themselves in the interview process," Ellis
said.

Arts

The perfect April Fools' joke is a lot like the new Science
Center. It takes years to build, and by the time it's done
you've graduated. You need something big, like that light
switch on McCabe. Something full of intrigue and betrayal.
Something that involves honors majors. You need:

The ultimate April Fools'

Day prank
Step 1: Get 1,000 monkeys and 1,001 M&Ms.
Step 2: At the begin-

ning of the year, replace

Step 4: Break into Bob
Gross' e-mail account at
the start of the year and
periodically send out emails to the reservedstudents list, saying that
the honors program is

being "redesigned to more

Fireside chats to follow."
Step 5: Write the names of the senior honors majors on

the M&Ms.

Step 6: Use your power with The Phoenix to do a cover
story about the replacement of thesis carrels with monkey

feeders.

Step 7: Put an ad in The Philadelphia Inquirer and
audition actors to be Craig Williamson look-alikes.
Step 8: Have Jane GoodaH come give a talk entitled "No
Longer Second Banana: Revitalizing the Honors Program."
Step 9: Send campus mail to all the honors majors,
telling them that instead of the traditional oral and written
examinations, they have to keep the monkeys from eating

the M&Ms bearing their names. And "highest honors will

go to the person who catches the purple monkey."
Step 10: There is no purple monkey.
Step 11: Spread the M&Ms around campus.
Step 12: Release the monkeys.
Step 13: Send the Craig Williamson look-alike to run
around campus, yelling, "You fool! He's eating your M&M!"
Step 14: Eat the remaining M&Ms.
You're thinking, "But it's April Fools' Day now." You
didn't plan anything, did you? No monkeys, no M&Ms, not
even someone who kinda, sorta looks like Craig
Williamson if you see him out of the corner of your eye.
You didn't even realize it was April Fools' Day until you
got to this column. You kept thinking, "Whoa, what is The
Phoenix talking about? Is this true?" Well, never fear. Just
because you haven't prepared doesn't mean you can't look
like a clever trickster.

Impromptu April Fools' pranks
1. Make obscure claims in class, like, "Foucault was the
ultimate modernist. April Fools!"
2. Print a 250-page PDF in McCabe during the preseminar, 1 p.m. rush hour, then say, "Just kidding!" and
throw all the pages in the air. (Bonus: Earthlust will think
this is funny, too).
3. Stand behind the mailboxes and, when one opens,
reach through and grab the person's wrist.
4. Get to class late. (This is even funnier if you sit in the
back and don't talk the whole time.)
5. Tell everyone you're on the 14-meal plan when you're
actually on the 17-meal plan. Won't they be surprised
when they see your point balance.
So, there you have it. The stuff of legends. Whether
you're the "long, involved monkey-intensive" type or the
"can't-really-tell-if-it's-actually-a-prank" type, you can
make this April Fools' Day or one far, far in the future a
ridiculous waste of everyone's time.

'Spotless Mind' shines eternally
BY EVA HOLMAN

eholman2@swarthmore.edu
Before you see Charlie Kaufman's latest film, you

might want to check at the door whatever classic Jim

Carrey moments you have hiding in the back of your
mind. Kaufman's movie hints at the quirky humor that
made him famous, but, for the most part, "Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a dark, inventive tribute to love. It leaves one completely satisfied and eager
to see the film a second time.
Jim Carrey is Joel, a shy New York lawyer who skips
work one morning to take a train to Montauk, the eastern tip of Long Island. The audience enjoys his sardonic,
stream-of-consciousness musings to himself (such as
"Valentines Day was invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap" and "Sand's overrated") until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet).
The idea of Kate Winslet, best known as "Titanic "s
aristocratic Rose, sporting gaudily dyed hair and a
large orange sweatshirt is almost as hard to grasp as a
soft-spoken Jim Carrey. But "Eternal Sunshine" is
groundbreaking in that it masterfully blends Carrey's
serious and comedic talents while utilizing Winslet's
often dead-on humor instincts, a talent she rarely has
the opportunity to showcase.
Interestingly, the initial meeting between Joel and
Clementine doesn't really cater to those watching. We
witness nearly 10 minutes of their introduction in all its
bumpiness. Joel and Clementine's attempts at conversation are painfully awkward. Their exchange lacks the
signature effortless flow films use to imply an
inevitable rendezvous, instead mirroring the ups and
downs of a real first encounter. The intentionally grainy
film quality and unvaried camera angle reinforces a
relationship so free of affectation that we cannot help
but be sucked in.
Suddenly, as the opening credits come up, Joel is crying hysterically. He has broken up with Clementine, and
he's destroyed over it. Worse, he discovers that
Clementine has decided to undergo an innovative procedure that "erases" all her memories of Joel. Outraged,
April 1,

2004

Joel decides to do the same. The doctor tells him his
memories of Clementine will be erased in a single night,
and that when he wakes up, he will have completely forgotten that she ever existed. But as the procedure
begins, and his memories disappear, he decides he wants
to stop the process. The only problem is that he can't
make himself wake up.
The journey into Joel's mind is presented as nonsequential fragments of his time with Clementine, from
their first meeting to their final encounter. With Clem's

hair color acting as a handy time marker for the audience, the two of them run from memory to memory, trying to dodge the inevitable eraser that will make each
date vanish. If you are craving that unique Carrey brand
of slapstick, pay extra close attention when the two
briefly hide inside one of the 5-year-old Joel's recollections. The monstrous distortions each memory undergoes as it is obliterated have never made the act of for-

getting seem more disturbing.
The high-tech storyline, however, throws a curve ball
at one's initial expectations. For a movie that works tirelessly from its outset to be taken seriously, its tone is
surprisingly uneven. The film vacillates between its
commitment to realism and self-conscious references to
the bizarre storyline. There are constant gags about the
far-outness of memory-erasing (i.e., the receptionist
calmly saying into a phone "No, ma'am, you cannot
undergo the procedure three times in one night," and the
doctor reluctantly admitting that the surgery "is technically brain damage") that seem at odds with the rest of
the

film.

Similarly, the technicians erasing Joel's memory eat
his food, play loud music and even smoke up on his bed
next to him. The casualness with which they treat such
a mysterious process is amusing at first, but the frequent cuts between Joel's attempt to preserve memories
of Clementine and the technicians' simultaneous
debauchery is a minor distraction.
Despite slight problems, the film is a breathtaking
and groundbreaking showcase of love that weaves
together every fabric of Joel and Clem's relationship and
is riveting throughout.

Transcendent and incandescent, the resplendence and phosphorescence of Britney Spears' "In

through in the hermeneutic lyrics, all at the same
chronological junction. Plus, Britney Spears' tits
look really good in the
"Toxic" video.
Hackneyed syllogisms

have always been used to
rationalize the success and
amniotic nature of the diapasonous lyrics that have
so frequently flowed from

destroys this form of rationation. While the words and musical accompanient ofother top pop albums today feel artificially

This Skin" "In the Zone" provides a level oflebensraum in which the listener can explore the possible implications of Spears' lyrical polemics.
Perhaps the best track of the album is "Brave New
Girl," the refrain of which is "She's a brave new
girl, and she's coming out tonight, she's gonna step
outside." Here is where Spears' (or whoever wrote
this song's) brilliance is on full display. What does
"outside" really mean? Can we ever fully understand what is outside of our selves? Well done,
Britney, well done. The album is perhaps the most
synecdochetic album of the year.

After months of deliberation, the large-scale event
committee has decided that Student Happiness :)
Coordinator Jenny Yim will perform.
The decision was the brainchild of Large-Scale Event
Committee member Jeff Traczynski 'O4.
"It was two o'clock on a Saturday night, and we were

Phoenix, "Dreaming of Jeopardy." In it, Leader-Smith
details his visit to a College Bowl meeting, his first stop
on his tour through various campus organizations.
Ullman, who attended that first meeting, said,
"There's just something compelling about Alex as a

at a dead end, talking about the same boring bands and
comedians," Traczynski said. "All of a sudden, I looked
across the table at Jenny Yim's sparkling smile, and I
thought, 'That's what we want to see.'"
Yim indicated that she was excited to perform in front
of the Swarthmore student body. "Cheers :)," she said.
The committee would not devulge all of the "tantalizing secrets" that awaited the event's audience, but committee member David Berger 'O4 promised there would
be at least two hours of what he called QJT, or "Quality
Jenny Time."
"Don't worry. We're not going to skimp on the Jenny,"
Berger said. "Her dog may make a cameo, as well."
An opening act has not been chosen, although Bob
Gross dancing a jig while wearing a fur hat and a skort,
an all-male version of Medea starring Public Safety officers and Greg Nelson's band are in the running.
Student and staff eagerly await Yim's performance.
On history professor Tim Burke's blog, "Easily
Distracted," he wrote, "Dear Blog, OMGI am sooooo excited for Jenny Yim to perform! She is the kewlest in the
world, and don't tell anyl but I think she's really pretty."
"All my friends are so jealous," Marta Buckley 'O5
said. "They have heard the legend of Jenny Yim far and
wide, but they know they'll never get a ticket."
Yim declined to comment on whether she would keep
the funds allotted for the large-scale event, nor would she
comment on allegations that she owes $2 to a student
who overpayed for the snow tubing trip.

Last week, she, Ullman, Mai Pucik 'O6 of SWIL and

named the Swarthmore Women of Astronomy and

lack of a physics background. Michael C. DeFillipo 'O4
was also in attendance, brushing up on "Leader-Smith

'Real World' to film at Swat
BY BETH COLLINS

ecollinl@swarthmore.edu

Next semester, students can look forward
to more than new classes and falafel bar. In
the follow-up to a season in Philadelphia,
MTV's reality TV show "The Real World" will
be hosting its 16th season at Swarthmore.
"Remember a few weeks ago when those
guys with cameras were following people
around campus, filming their every move?
Get used to it," Director of News and
Information Tom Krattenmaker said. "The
whole 'lmage of Swarthmore' thing was a
complete fabrication. The filming is actually
going to be used in the trailers and that intro
part when the stars say that whole 'this is a
true story' thing."

The show's producers, Bunim/Murray
Productions, chose Swarthmore during a visit
to the campus a few months ago. "We looked
around during a day trip from filming in
Philly, and we couldn't believe the gold mine
of social dysfunction out here in this quiet
suburban town," Nigel Lythgoe said. "I mean,
you got kids protesting for vegetable rights
and people running around in shorts and sandals when it's five degrees and snowing outside."
The show's producers recognize that there
are some drawbacks to filming at one of the
top liberal arts colleges in the nation.
"Seriously, who can afford 40 grand a year? I
know Viacom [MTV's parent company] can't,"

Lythgoe said.

The show cast seven people out of a huge

pool of applicants in mid-February. Three cast

members are from Swarthmore. The producers cast the remaining four from outside
schools.
"We originally wanted to have all the cast

members come from Swarthmore, but then we
realized there were some requisite roles in the
cast that just couldn't be filled solely by
Swarthmore students," Jonathan Murray, the
show's co-founder said. "I mean, yeah, we got
the snotty-intellectual, supposedly-above-reality-TV type easily, but let's be honest. There
just aren't that many working-class,expectorating, Bostonian, football player types
around campus, and that's a role we have to
fUI."

Beside the snotty intellectual, there were
only two other roles that could be filled at
Swarthmore, the minority activist and the
clove-smoking, absinthe-drinking vegan that

spends the summers reading Kafka to orphans
in Tunisia, Murray said. "I don't even know
where Tunisia is, but I thought what [this person] is doing there is so cool. Thank God there
are people out there who read the great mod-

ernist works to the less fortunate," he said.
added he could not yet release the

names of the cast.
The producers of the show rounded out the
cast with four students from schools other than
Swarthmore. A super-virgin Mormon from
Brigham Young University, the president of the
Louisiana State chapter of the Kappa Kappa

Kappa sorority, and

a sensitive musician from
NYU who brings in ratings from preteen girls
in Kansas but refuses to look head-on at the
camera will join a football player from Rutgers.
In early March, the four non-Swarthmore
cast members toured the campus before taping.
"I was totally stoked to be going to an all-girls
school like Swarthmore for 'The Real
World,'" one of the cast members said. "But
then I found out it wasn't an all-girls school,
which really freaked me out, 'cause I swear it
used to be. But the guys are all dorks, so I get
laid anyway."

prank? We're still waiting for the punch line of the ra
tail. (Then again, maybe it's punch line enough.) In th
spirit of April Fools' Day, we are invoking our "One Time
Only, Making a Slightly Humorous List and Calling It a
Column" card. It expires April 2 anyway.
For your edification and our catharsis, we present the
"Stylistic Devices List of Trends We Wish Were An April
Fools' Joke". To paraphrase Mr. T, we pity the (April)
fool who wore:
1. Attitude T-shirts. "The Voices in My Head Don't
Like You!" or similar tacky shirts.
2. The whalebone corset. Although it has launched
many a metaphor for societal constraints on the 19th-century female, all the crushed ribs just weren't worth that
women's studies paper.
3. Snap-on sunglasses. You'd think the wisdom of
age would prevent this kind of thing from happening. We
may be ageist, but we're not half-blind, unlike the only
people we have ever seen wearing them. (They are 70,
live in Palm Beach and flip up the sunglasses when they
eat dinner at 4 p.m.)
4. Skorts. Like its cousin the spork, the skort was not
fooling anyone. Designed to maximize ass coverage in a
short skirt, it instead provoked ridicule in schoolyards
across America. Also like the spork, it failed to effectively deliver either noodles or soup to your mouth.
5. The commercialization of punk. When the local
mall starts selling plaid wristbands and ripped shirts
that have been pre-safety-pinned, you know punk is really dead. Sheena is a punk rocker now, along with half of

our nation's tweens.
6. Jeans with an ankle circumference of 30 inches
he can wear
or more. (This excludes Paul Bunyan
anything he wants. He and Babe will eat you.)
7. The unitard. It has a crotch-snap. Crotch-snap.
Crotch-snap. And nothing more must be said.
8. Scrunchies. They are the third-grade part of you
that liked cats and horses a lot. Maybe dotted your i's with
hearts if you swung that way. The Sweet Valley Twins may
never grow up, but you are not Jessica Wakefield, and the
Unicorn Club doesn't want you anymore.
9. Fitted capri pants. To dream the impossible
dream, to wear the impossible pants. Unless you're
Jackie O. (we're not worthy! we're not worthy!), or someone who actually lives on Capri, you look fat.
10. Fur. First of all, there is the clear and present danger of Neil Mehta 'O5. Secondly, if you don't wear fur, you
have a better chance of scoring with one of Swarthmore's
many hot vegetarians.
Addendum: You are allowed to wear a fur hat
a. But only if you kill it yourself.
b. A la Davy Crocket.
c. Aka King of the Wild Frontier.
11. Mom jeans. We must give credit to Saturday
Night Live for its perfect classification of this subset of
jean species. Moms, you can look hot, too, so give up
these tapered-leg jeans with the high waist and take
back your shape. (Also, the seasons called. They want
their sweaters back.)
12. Burberry. OK. We've sighted knockoffs every-

where, including at the Swarthmore dollar store.
Burberry is no longer a status symbol, unless your status is "annoying."
13. Pre-faded jeans. First Urban Outfitters came for
the punk rockers, and I did not speak, for I was not a punk
rocker. Then Urban Outfitters came for the hipsters, and I
did not speak, for I was not a hipster. Now Urban
Outfitters comes for the thrift store devotees, and there is
no one left to speak for me.
14. Shoulder pads. It can be as painless as scissoring
your ex out of all your good photos. Please cut shoulder
pads, one of the few things we don't like about the 'Bos, out
of any clothing you have, and donate said pads to a flatchested high school freshman. (Take it from Annie, they
look more natural than Kleenex).
In keeping with our pacifist philosophy, we recognize
that, just as Mr. T can pull off that haircut and all that

bling-bling, there are probably people out there who can
wear shoulder-pads and a skort and not be pitied like the
proverbial fool. We envy you

Though they commendably exercise a level of moderation rare in music that sounds like this, the 90 Day Men

Clothes come off as Sager changes venues
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

"Guys wear a dress, girls
wear less" is the motto of Sager's
Genderfuck, aka "the craziest
year"
party
of
the
at
Swarthmore. The party, organized by Swarthmore Queer
Union, is the culminating event
of the Sager Symposium on
queer community issues. This
year's theme was "My Big
Fabulous Gay Wedding," and costumes ranged from bridal outfits
to underwear to nothing at all.
The theme, which SQU chose in
an attempt to bring attention to
the fight for gay marriage,
inspired an abundance of wedding decorations in Upper
Tarble: arches, white drapes,
lights and wedding rings.
First-year students were curious to see if the party would
match up to the wild stories of
THE PHOENIX

cross-dressing, sexual acts and
nudity that they had heard from

older students.
"There was some nudity, but
it wasn't as sexual as I thought,"
Dana Seay 'O7 said. "The music
was good, though." Like many
females, Seay abided by the "girls
wear less" dress code. "I wore
fishnets, a pair of tap shorts, a
tiny tank top and devil horns,"
she said. "I got a few looks, but
there were plenty of people
dressed more outrageously than
me, so it wasn't a big deal. I felt
more self-conscious in my dorm
than once I got to Sager."
Jacob Eccles 'O7 also took to
the "guys wear a dress" rule.
Eccles asked female friends for
appropriate clothing and chose a
black dress. "Jess [Mandrick 'o7]
worked on my makeup
I was
very comfortable," he said. "I
thought it was a lot of like any
other party except for the dress.
...

People told me there'd be some
sexual action going on, but there
wasn't any of that. I was almost
disappointed."
Upperclass students agreed
that Sager had not lived up to its
infamous reputation this year.
"It was much, much tamer than
last year," An Bui 'O5 said. But
many students still had a good

time.

"I thought it was a little too
crowded, but it was fun," Emily
Szydlowski 'O5 said.
Powen Shiah 'O6, a Sager
Symposium coordinator, felt the
"tameness" was due to the spaces
chosen for the party. Last year's
Sager, which took place in Olde
Club and the WRC, was plagued
with "rumors and a general feeling of excessive 'sketchiness' and
inappropriate behavior," said

Shiah. "While Olde Club and the
WRC were a series of smaller
spaces, this year Paces and Upper
April

X 2004

Tarble offered more public and
open spaces, which may have discouraged people from being as
wild."
Dan Luban 'O6 preferred last
year's spaces to this year's.

"Basically, Olde Club and the

WRC were much better spaces for
the party," he said. "I don't really
like Upper Tarble as a party
space or Paces when it's so
crowded you can't move. I didn't
think it was as cool as last year,
because there wasn't as much
crazy stuff going on."
According to SQU, the party
committee took care to make
Sager an environment students
of all orientations felt comfortable in. "I thought it was great.
There were people I know who
are gay but aren't out, and they
were being themselves at the
party," said Corey Baker 'O7, SQU

member and Sager organizer.

"That's what I think it's for. I

thought it was really liberating.
A lot of people had fun, a lot of
people dressed up. It was a different side to people I hadn't seen
before."

One of Sager's Paces DJs,
Audrey Chan 'O4, reflected upon
the party. "Supposedly last year

was the craziest. My freshman
year there were hired male
dancers and girls wearing strapons. This was quite different... It
was less kinky than past Sagers,
so it just seemed like a really fun
dance party with less clothing. I
didn't get to interact with the
party that much, but it was fun to

keep people moving."
Despite this year's relative
tameness, some students were
still turned off by the concept of
the party. "I wasn't so sure about
the whole girls-wear-less thing,
although it was funny to watch
the guys dress up," Annie
Hansen 'O7 said.

From Antietam to Willets, the boiler lives on
I haven't spoken to Stan in several days, but I'd bet my fare that
he has no idea how the steam
engine in the hold of that old
Staten Island Ferry was able to
take him across that great wet
mess every morning and evening
during all those years.
I suppose that we could have
piqued his curiosity one blustery
morning by fitting him with a jolly
rowboat and set of splintery oars to
fit his soft New York palms.

JOHN TUTHILL

The Air Up There
It might seem that this is all

out of context now that our friend
Stan dwells happily in his heated
and quadruple-walled Willets dormitory, hours away from his
childhood doorstep, with no
reliance on the dirty steam guzzler that once carried him back
and forth at the rise and fall of
each miserable school day. These
days, Stan snores like a truck,
comforted by the distance he has

put between himself and that fart-

ing steam engine of his youth.
Until he wakes up one morning
and starts complaining that he's
too hot
his "balls were sweating" all night. Well, Stan, you
archetypal highfalutin know-nothing, it's your old comrade the
steam engine creeping into those
city-boy boxer briefs and sucking
the salts from your supple glands.
You see, Stan, when this building was designed, steam convection heat was the cheapest
method of keeping soft grumbling
folks like you sufficiently cozy. So
there is a boiler in our basement,
locked away from our thieving,
prying eyes, that keeps you converted, warm and dry on those
brisk mid-Atlantic mornings.
Oh, I see. You don't know what
a boiler is. You're not educated. A
boiler is, simply, a large tank filled
with water that is able to put the
heat from some fuel source (oil,
gas, coal) into water that becomes
steam. The roasted water, steam, is
piped up to your room, where you

are huddled up against the radiator, dripping wet in all your glory.
You need more detail, eh, you
old rascal? Well, there are firetube and watertube steam boilers.
In a firetube boiler, the fire or
heated gases from the energy
source are directed through the
inside of pipes within the boiler,
surrounded by water. The pipes
are arranged in banks so that the
hot gases can pass through the
boiler a few times before passing
out the stack, so that the system is
most efficient by exposing most of
the heat created to the water. In a
water tube boiler, the hot gases

are exposed to pipes filled with
water, arranged vertically. There
are usually two drums. The separation of steam and water takes
place in the top, while the bottom
is a collection device for waste.
The smoking water is under
pressure, that's right, Stan,
because it has been heated, so it
flows through the pipes up into
the radiator in your room. The
convection heating works by
causing the air in the room to circulate through the radiator, creating circulation that moves air
across the ceiling, down the door,
then across the floor back to the
radiator. It's a circle, yes. And at
the end it condenses and flows
back downhill to that monstrous

dank boiler room.
So, Stan, that brings us to why
your quaint room, with all its
psychedelic posters and incense
holders and stashed Redbooks,
can get so warm during the
spring. The problem with steam
is that when it is on, it lasts like a
Belarus tractor, especially in our
big concrete tombs. Oh, you
thought our buildings were made
of stone? No, sir!
In spring, our friends who
maintain the boiler are probably
waiting until the nights warm up
enough so fragile boys like you
won't be too cold to sleep. And
maybe it's a little cold in the fall,
while we all wait for the weather
to level off and be cold so that we
can get ready to heat ourselves for
the winter. But there's no reason
to cry about what doesn't amount

to a can of beans.
I guess you could write a song
about your experience Stan. It

would be like a Magical School
Bus learning experience song,
and it might go like this:
"From the Staten Island Ferry

bill. From Antietam to my beloved
dorm, steam, steam, you sure do
keep us sopping and warm ..."

2004 Whitney Biennial opens in New York
BY CLAIRE RUUD
cruudl@swarthmore.edu
The 2004 Whitney Biennial, at the
Whitney Museum of American Art in
New York City until May 30, received
cheerful reviews for the first time in
years. The infamous biennial is known as
the exhibition everyone loves to hate. But
this year a few influential people gave
their thumbs up
check out the March
22 review by Peter Scheldahl, the conservative but popular critic at The New
Yorker, and Michael Kimmelman's reviewin The New York Times from March 12.
Everyone followed suit, including me.

in scale and treat the figure masterfully (I
use the word advisedly) in the tradition of
Rembrandt or De Kooning. Elizabeth
Peyton's intimate portraits of her friends
and her self-portrait also venerate the art
of painting. Schjeldahl loftily calls her
paintings "the moral center of the exhibition" and claims, "Her romantic aestheticism charges her swift line and intense
color with a sense of the sacred." If you relish paintings that are tactile, richly hued,
figurative or representative, you will find
these and many more delicious works in
the exhibition to sate your appetite.
The curators also believe an interest in
the art, politics and pop culture of the '6os
and '7os is coming back. This trend is well
documented in the exhibition.
Unfortunately, it has produced most of the
worst art in the show. Fun at best,
migraine-inducing at worst, the work is
hackneyed and superficial. The artists
seem to wish they could be flower children
and disco kings and live in an optimistic
psychedelic haze. But they aren't, and they
don't, so their fantasies seem more delusional than visionary.
However, many artists do recognize
the collapse of those societies and their
Utopian projects. Dario Robleto's exquisite sculpture of a damaged cassette tape
is one example. He uses ground human
bone, melted-down LPs, and the substances formed by the first testing of the

artists are going today. The least informative trend they propose is the return to
painting, drawing and obsessive attention to
line, surface and the figure. Painting "dies"
and is "revived" far too often in the art
world. Critics can always find evidence for
an argument that we are on one or the other
side of the cycle. It is more accurate to think

The infamous biennial is
known as the exhibition
everyone loves to hate.

The show includes up-and-coming and

well-established artists, explores all kinds of
media, and asks ethical and aesthetic questions. The eclecticism is exciting, because
there's always a surprise around the corner.
The curators have carefully sorted the work
for smooth navigation of the diversity. They

kept the rooms small, and in each room they
grouped two, three or four artists with
shared concerns. It is hard to imagine how
the three curators sifted through the sea of
American art from the last two years to pick
out these 110 artists and these particular

works. It is even more incredible that the

curators were able to find unifying themes
among the variety.

Though the trends they site are broad,

they

12

shed

light

on some of the directions

of painting and drawing as classical, foundational skills. Artists must constantly negotiate their relationship with these traditional
arts, whether they work with canvas, paper,

negatives, stone, metal or found objects.
Similarly, the line, surface and figure
are always obsessions of artists in some

way or another. Perhaps the artists chosen
for the biennial are paying more classical
attention to these formal qualities than a
few years ago, but the difference is the
nature of the obsession, not the obsession
itself. Cecily Brown's peachy nudes, for
example, luminesce under nightmarish
black skies. Her thick paint caresses their
curves and recesses with aggressive but
painterly strokes. The canvases are grand

atomic bomb, among other things, to form
his sculptures. His work disillusions the
viewer but also leaves us pondering the
similarities and differences between then
and now, and wondering about future possibilities. There is a glimmer in the art,
though I hesitate to call it hope.
The final trend on display is the use of
various materials to create fantastic
worlds. The curators support their argument well through their choice of works.
Yayoi Kusama has created one of the most
beautiful worlds with his "Fireflies on the
Water," a one-person room that is

enchanting.
Though the line to be enveloped in this
hideaway is long, the wait is well worth
the magic. Emily Yacir has created an
entirely different kind of alternate uni-

verse by fulfilling wishes of exiled
Palestinians. She asks them, "If I could do
anything for you, anywhere in Palestine,
what would it be?" Her work in the biennial documents her trying to actualize
these requests. She momentarily creates a

world where boundaries are dissolvable
and dreams come true.
I have barely brushed the surface of
what the Whitney's biennial has to offer,

skipping over a number of wonderful
video pieces and the public art in Central
Park. It is impossible to do each of the
worthwhile pieces justice. You'll just have
to go check it out for yourself.

than 200 students on Saturday
was that "straight people should
have more sex than they do; gay
men should have less sex than
they can."

The rest of the hour-long talk
centered on Savage's experiences
as a gay man in a family that
seems to uphold traditional gender roles. "My queer family," as
Savage called it, was the overarching theme for the 2004 Sager
Symposium, entitled "Queering
the Nuclear."

Savage and his boyfriend
adopted a son six years ago,

which he documents in his book
"The Kid: What Happened After
My Boyfriend and I Decided to
Get Pregnant." Although DJ,
their son, is being raised by gay
parents, Savage pointed out that
his family is the "straightest"

family among his parents' children. Savage goes to work while

many activists have asked in the
past decade: Is gay marriage a

betrayal of the gay-rights movement?

Absolutely

not,

Savage

answered. "We're only 35 years
into [the gay-rights movement],"
he said.
With a characteristic barb like
those that appear in his weekly
column, Savage confessed, "You
can't be a whore forever." He
pointed out that marriage has
always been defined by heterosexuals as the union between opposite
genders. To prove the silliness of
this definition, Savage plans to
obtain a marriage license with a
lesbian co-worker in early April.
When asked about the future of
gay marriage, Savage replied, "I
have faith in the American democto be last in all things but

be setbacks, he said, but there are
also positive signs in places you

On Saturday, Dan Savage, author of the syndicated sex column, "Savage Love," spoke as part of the
Sager Symposium.

place to impress a date with minimal

are $lO-12, while a nice plate of veal
scaloppini is more in the $l7-18 range.
Either way, the portions are huge enough
that you'll most likely be bringing home

For an appetizer, I ordered Tiramisu's signature dish: baby artichokes roasted in an

turned out excellently. The pasta was clearly homemade: Each noodle was almost
paper-thin and melted in the mouth, without any of the rubbery-ness that comes
with boxed pasta. The accompanying sauce
was a light, very fragrant blend of tomatoes, artichokes and mushrooms. Overall,
the flavors in this dish just sang, highly
recommended to anyone seeking bliss in

sauteed and simmered form.
Tiramisu does have its drawbacks. The
temperature inside the restaurant was
uncomfortably cold, and, after being played
twice at high volume, the theme from
"Love Story" began to lose its charm. But if
you're looking for an Italian place that's a
bit out of the ordinary, Tiramisu just might
sweep you off your feet.

Screw you
It has come to our attention that, despite the commonly promulgated stereotypes about Swarthmore as a
cloistered hall of learning that champions diversity and
liberal social causes, the institutions and culture of
Swarthmore are subject to many major flaws. These
include a monolithic political culture that restricts dissent, a lack of open communication about broad-ranging policy decisions and a student body entirely consisting of stupid annoying insufferable pieces of crap.
This latter problem is perhaps the most difficult to
correct. While institutional remedies may help increase
dialogue about individual campuswide problems, they
will not change the mysterious, almost mystical force
that takes hold of America's best and brightest as they
pass through the admissions process, changing them, as
they step over Swarthmore's threshold, into a mob of
blowhards, windbags and know-it-all jerks.
The conflictsbetween liberals and conservatives have

increased in recent years, but what has not changed has
been the smarmy, infuriatingly ignorant, incredibly selfrighteous attitude that oozes from themlike a foul stench
whenever they speak or even look in our direction.
Moreover, as workloads increase, exacerbated by pres-

sures to maintain academic rigor in the face of widespread grade inflation, students respond by whining like
a bunch of spoiled little toddlers while blowing off their
work to get drunk, make asses of themselves and waste
their time with mindless chit-chat masquerading as
intellectual debate. We really hate that.
Most tellingly, as the dating scene has become less
structured and more students experiment sexually, students seem content to sit in tiny, enclosed cliques,
enjoying a web of evolving, vibrant relationships while
utterly and completely ignoring social loners who
might turn out to be very nice people if anyone would
give them a little love, but are instead write bitter editorials alone in their rooms, lost in the bitter, all-consuming cold of the sexual equivalent of the Christian
mystics' long dark night of the soul.
Oh, just never mind. April Fools!

Major business opportunity now open
Dear Editor:
I know that this letter may come to
you as a surprise but your contact
was given to me by a reliable friend of
my father working in the Dubai
Chamber of Commerce, Industries
and Development after I told him that
I needed a reliable and honest business partner outside the United Arab

Emirates.
My name is Gideon Mas. I am a
Sierra Leonean and the son of the late
Osman Mas, former Director-General
of the Society of Culture, Art and

Music in Freetown. He replaced the
Lebanese business tycoon Jamil
Mohamed Saheed who was fired by
President Ahmed Tejan Mas.
Unfortunately, my father was
attacked by rebels in Kono, Eastern
Sierra Leone. Before he died, he
revealed to me that he has $l4 million
in an Iron Crate which he lodged in a
security company for safe keeping in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He reg-

istered the contents of the box as gold
and diamond which belongs to him

and his foreign partner. He also confided in me that he kept the certificate
of the deposit and the keys of the box
in his safe.

receipt of the part payment, I met the
director of the security company with
the receipt for collection of the box.
After thorough verifications, he
agreed for the release provided I can
come along with a foreign partner
who is involved in the transaction.
Based on this development, I contact-

ed a friend of my father who is working at the Chamber of Commerce to

assist me to seek for a reliable, honest
and well-established individual that
has business foresight. He then gave
me your contact as the person he
believes will do a fair transaction
with me.
I propose that you come as the foreign partner concerned so that we can
retrieve the money from the security
company. I have decided that for all
assistance and inconveniences, 20
percent of the total sum would be
yours, while the rest of the remaining
balance will be put into investment

you might suggest in your country or
any where else you trust.

assure you of our 100-percent risk-free

the present. Affirmative action is
a reaction against this three-phase
historical
momentum.
All
Americans, black and white, are
part of this historical process set
in motion some 400 years ago.
Affirmative action should be seen
within broad historical context.
If a woman were to eat a hamburger, then afterwards claim she

was not a carnivore because she did not actually slaughter the cow,
you would dismiss her claim as absurd, would you not? WeU, I dismiss the Caucasian who benefits from white tyranny (even if
recently immigrated), yet claims he is not a white supremacist
because he personally neither murdered red people nor enslaved
black people. Like the hypothetical woman consuming the hamburger, he consumes white privilege. She is a carnivore. He is a
white supremacist. He is like Claudius, the murderer of Hamlet's
father: "Since I am still possessed of those affects for which I did
May one be pardoned and retain the offense?"
the murder
Genocide and slavery, or "Manifest Destiny," is American historical background
the past. The New World Order is American historical foreground
the present. Past and present, background
and foreground, are seamless.
Black's Law Dictionary defines "affirmative action" as "a set of
actions designed to eliminate existing and continuing discrimination, to remedy lingering effects of past discrimination, and to create systems and procedures to prevent future discrimination." Its
first two aspects are sets of reactions. Its third has to do with con...

struction and is therefore proactive.
Everybody knows the proverb "Give a kid a fish, he eats for a
day. Teach him to fish, he eats for a lifetime." For the Talented
Tenth, affirmative action is about self-advancement within the status quo of white superiority and black inferiority. They do not see
themselves as black, but as individuals who happen to be black.
They then happen to position themselves in between white tyranny and black subjection as intermediaries. As Frantz Fanon put it,
they are "affranchised slaves who are individually free." They use
the privilege that is the elite college diploma for personal promotion, not social responsibility. They use affirmative action to
achieve status so as to distance themselves from the black masses.
Affirmative action is about they themselves eating the fish.
For the New Negro, affirmative action is about learning to fish
and then teaching his community of brothers and sisters to fish.
However, like Odysseus caught between Scylla and Charybdis, the
New Negro is caught between the miseducated Talented Tenth and
the uneducated black masses. He exposes the Talented Tenth like
Jesus did the Pharisees, like Socrates did the Sophists. He educates
the black masses like Booker T. Washington. Of course, for his educational efforts the Talented Tenth and their white supremacist
sponsors accuse him of "corrupting the youths." Regardless, the
New Negro relentlessly exposes Uncle Tom for the house Negro
that he is and leaves him to eat his crumbs from the master's table.
He likewise exposes Sambo for the field Negro that he is, not to put
him down, but to uplift him that he might realize his potential and
rise up from his stereotype to the archetype of the New Negro.
The New Negro uses affirmative action to build black civilization. He uses the privilege that is the elite college diploma to claim
equity in the system on behalf of his people. He uses affirmative
action to establish educational, scientific, economic, political and
cultural infrastructures that would make black America truly
"separate but equal" to white America. For example, the New
Negro

educator uses affirmative action to establish Afrocentrism

and Black studies as a worldview and comprehensive discipline
"separate but equal" to Eurocentrism and White studies. The

Talented Tenth use affirmative action to streamline their 'assimilation of White culture," to quote Swedish economist Gunnar
Myrdal's definition of American education. Thoroughly confused,

they are the miseducated leading the uneducated, or Uncle Tom
leading Sambo. The New Negro does not lead the black communi-

ty so much as he serves the black community. Whereas the
Talented Tenth use affirmative action to react against discrimination here and to protest discrimination there, the New Negro uses
affirmative action within the context of proaction. He uses it "to
create systems and procedures to prevent further discrimination."
He is the builder of a civilization.

No extremism in opposing veal
ARC protests targeted at extreme cruelty, not at all meat consumption
BY AARON HOLLANDER
ahollanl@swarthmore.edu

I would like to respond to an amusing, if somewhat uninformed, letter by Abigail Frost last week

("Vegetable mistreatment ignored," March 25, pg. 14)
about the Animal Rights Coalition's veal campaign,
mistakenly attributed in the letter to my own rancorous efforts. The cleverly sarcastic letter makes,
however, what I consider to be a very important
point
at least, I hope it does.
I will give Frost the benefit of the doubt and
address what I am assuming to be the thoughtfulness
masked by the letter's biological errors. The argument present in her thinking, as far as I understand
it, is one that is always a little tricky to confront,

because on the surface it is a solid rationale.
We hear often of the
"slippery-slope"
argument, whereby, in this
case, we should not fight
to remove veal from the

My response to these questions and arguments is

fairly basic, and I hope I speak at least in part for the
other members of the veal campaign at Swarthmore.

draw the line? We certainly wouldn't propose to
make Sharpies a strictly vegan cafeteria, so how can

carnivores, even some plants have done it for all history. The grotesque practice in question is not the
eating of meat, but the methods by which modern
society has decided to mass-produce it.
Frost's tongue-in-cheek proposal is in fact
nowhere near what we would suggest. We should not
try to exempt ourselves from the food chain; rather,
in fighting against veal we are fighting the perversion of the natural system.
As for plants, there is no question that our agricultural methods are in many ways damaging to the
environment and, as Frost suggests, that they expose
our plant food to many natural and unnatural hazards. However, as plants have no central nervous
system like that of animals, it is unlikely that they
notice what is inflicted on them. Animals, however,
are very conscious that they are being locked in

calves, bulldozed into
pits and buried alive,
like many spent egg-laying chickens, or suffounder-oxycated

farmed fish.

So why do we focus
on veal? We cannot, as a
small group in a small college, end cruelty to all
species. But that is no reason, and indeed, no excuse,
not to fight for whatever we can. Veal, like fur, is
rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Many restaurants are ceasing to serve it, meat-lovers are becoming repulsed by the very idea of eating it and several
college campuses, such as Bryn Mawr and
Haverford, removed veal from their cafeterias long
before we did. Veal may be one drop in an ocean of
animal and human rights abuses, but it is a drop that
we were able to handle successfully in our own
community.

Coverage ignores real living wage issues
Dear Editor:
I was dismayed by the ad hominem nature of your
headline and report on the living wage collection

pg. 6). The collection was
about the compensation of
low-paid staff, not about

the relationship of lowpaid staff to their supervisors. Yes, one panelist

Ad hominem criticism unneeded
To the Editor:
For the benefit of those who were
not there, I want to add some context in reference to the article on the
living wage collection held on
March 19 ("Living wage collection
incites controversy, March 25, pg. 6).
I did indeed ask people to stop

applauding in the wake ofProfessor
Allison Dorsey's spirited response

to Linda McDougall's remarks. It
seems to me that to respond with
applause is too simple and easy a

substitute for thoughtful dialogue. I
also said that anyone who speaks in

public settings about sensitive matters put him or herself at risk and
that therefore their ideas and feelshould be received with
respect.
I will not attempt to speak for
Linda McDougall, whom I understood to be expressing her own view
that enhanced benefits trumped
additional cash, and I do understand
how her expression of that view hit

sensitivities in the audience.
Nevertheless, besides the emotions
of those moments, contrary to the
Phoenix headline, the meeting was
productive and informative for
many from whom I've heard since.
The campus conversation needs to
go forward without ad hominem
attention to those who are willing to
express their view.

He would also be the first African-American vice-presidential
nominee. Lewis is to the left of Kerry on many issues, though,
and has never represented anything larger than a House district. Warner is only in his first term as Virginia governor, but
he is young and talented and has already made himself a
major player in several national organizations. In Matchup 2,
Graham has a long, distinguished career as both governor of
and senator from Florida, a state that will be critical for Kerry
this November. But Graham is not particularly charismatic,
while Edwards (N.C.) has plenty of charisma and campaigning
talent. Edwards did have problems getting votes during his
presidential campaign, and many questioned his level of experience
he is finishing his first term in the Senate.
Midwest Region Matchup 1: Dick Gephardt (seed 1) vs.
Tom Vilsack (seed 4)
Midwest Region Matchup 2: Evan Bayh (seed 2) vs.
Kathleen Sebelius (seed 3)
Many political observers believe that the Midwest, more
than the South, will be where the 2004 election will be decided,
so we should watch this bracket carefully. Vilsack has done a
good job as governor of lowa, but Gephardt (Mo.) has years of
political experience as a leading voice for labor in Congress
and a leading member of the Democratic Party. Gephardt's bid
for the presidency went down in flames earlier this year, and
it's possible that he's sick of campaigning. If not, though, he'll
be an extremely strong contender. Bayh served as governor of
Indiana for eight years before becoming its junior senator, so
he has the potential to put that normally Republican state in
play. Bayh is a New Democrat through and through and may
end up being too moderate for Kerry's tastes, but Sebelius, the
governor of Kansas, shares the same problem. In addition, she
has only been governor since 2002, and her state has even less
of a chance of going Democratic than Indiana does.
West Region Matchup 1: John McCain (seed 1) vs. Janet
Napolitano (seed 4)
West Region Matchup 2: Bill Richardson (seed 2) vs. Gary
Locke (seed 3)
People have been fantasizing about McCain (R-Ariz.)
becoming a Democrat pretty much since the day he dropped
out of the 2000 primaries. A Kerry-McCain ticket would be formidable indeed, but it seems very unlikely. McCain may be a
maverick Republican, but he is still a Republican who is loyal
to his party. Napolitano, the governor of McCain's Arizona,
only became governor in 2003, but she has an impressive
record as a tough prosecutor, and Arizona is a swing state. In
Matchup 2, Richardson, current New Mexico governor and
former U.N. ambassador and U.S. Secretary of Energy, has an
impressive record, but he's said publicly that he is not interested in running, and governors tend to run into problems
when they bolt during their first term. Locke, the capable
Washington governor whose state will probably be in contention in November, delivered the Democrats' response to
the State of the Union address in 2003 and was first elected in
1996.

Stop Gay terrorism Corporate America needs more Swatties
This great nation has been
embroiled of late in a stormy
debate over the issue of Gay marriage. While President Bush has
rightly drawn our attention to the
destructive effect that such a
change could have on the sanctity
of heterosexual marriage, I would
gently question the president as
to why he has not gone public
with the information that could
bring the debate to its morally

EVAN GREER

Goodthink

upstanding close: the fact that the
Gays are clearly allied with AlQaeda.
Within the context of the ongoing War on Terrorism, it is cru-

cial that we realize that the homosexual agenda being gobbled up
by un-American college students all around the nation is directly
linked with the agenda of the terrorists who perpetrated the Sept.
11 attacks. We must examine this latest push for Gay marriage
not as a struggle for civil rights but as the latest in a series of
Islamo-homo-fascist attempts to undermine American social
institutions while galvanizing anti-U.S. support among our more
left-leaning citizens.
The president eloquently outlined this point when he
declared, "You are either with us, or you are with the terrorists."
Clearly these Gay-rights "activists" are not with us, and in fact
they have ties to even more insidious terrorist groups, such as
-anarchists and Democrats. One Gay student here within our very
own community of Swarthmore even admitted to having cooperated with criminal insurgent organizations like the American

We aren't limiting the Gays' rights; we're
liberating them from their oppressive
Gayness.
Friends Service Committee and Food Not Bombs. These rabblerousers, who have close ties, to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks, would like nothing more than to see the complete collapse
of American institutions and to fling the world into a state of
chaos
bouts of marijuana smoking and extended periods without showering punctuated by giant animalistic homosexual
orgies. They seek only to undermine our social order, destroy
capitalism and weaken our national security by whining about

the "criminalization of dissent." That's where the terrorists come
in. Once the Gays have penetrated our defenses and corroded the
stability of our national borders, the terrorists will be free to
wreak havoc on our civilians and impose their fundamentalist
religious beliefs upon us all.
Anyhow, God wants America to prevail over the Gays and
their terrorist allies. After a private meeting with Him on
Saturday, the president notified me through personal correspondence that the Lord has granted authorization to his new constitutional amendment banning Gay marriage. The amendment will
mark a major defeat for the terrorists and a major victory for God
and those of us who support law and order and the maintenance
of American democracy. The fact is, if Gay people get civil rights,
then everyone will want them! Imagine the chaos that would
ensue if immigrants, women and other minorities were suddenly
granted equal rights to normal people! It would mean the complete and utter collapse of everything that America stands for.
Those horrible leftists always try to skew the issues. When we
liberated Iraq, they claimed that we were somehow impinging on
the rights of the Iraqis! In that same vein, we aren't limiting the
Gays' rights; we're liberating them from their oppressive
Gayness. How many men and women live their lives every day
unable to combat their overpowering attraction to the same sex?
If we are to truly fight for "human rights," as the terrorists like
to say, we must liberate the Gays from themselves. One Gay student optimistic at her chances of liberation said, "Oh, yes, I am so
glad that the president is going to pass a constitutional ban on
Gay marriage. Maybe, once it's against the law, I will be able to
overcome my heathen urges
like how they made marijuana
illegal and everyone stopped doing it."
I'd like to conclude by sending a clear message to the terrorGays: You might think that you've fooled us all and that no once
can see the connection between your absurd homoerotic tendencies and blowing up buildings. But you're wrong. We're onto you,
and there's no way we're going to let you get away with it.

BY ANDREA WONG 02
andrea@blisspr.com
When I was a senior at Swarthmore two years ago,
there seemed to be three acceptable avenues of pursuit
for "the afterlife" teaching or learning, going abroad
or a combination of the two. I had done all of them in
limited doses, and I just couldn't see myself doing it
again for a while. But dragging on the heels of my
friends, I attended various information sessions for
grad school, the Peace Corps, the Watson Fellowship,
etc., always feeling like I was in the wrong place, that I
must be the most un-Swattish Swattie there ever was.
Despite this feeling, I refused to give into pragmatism and tried to be as Swattie as I could under the circumstances. I interned (for free, of course) at various
newspapers and gourmet restaurants; I wrote restaurant reviews for a tiny magazine in New Hampshire; I
worked at Williams-Sonoma to pay my rent; I went to
sleep at two and woke up at 10 like I was still a student.
While it all sounds fun, let me tell you, I could barely afford to pay my rent. I was slicing the fat off meat,
running up and down stairs fetching overpriced
kitchenware for people with too much money, and eating at shady diners in the middle of New Hampshire
while writing notes under the table, and I couldn't
afford to pay my rent. Four years of college, and I
couldn't figure out how to hack it in the real world. At
this point, I looked to default back to the somewhat
familiar dusting off all those brochures on Fulbright
scholarships and Ph.D. programs in postmodern

geopolitical hegemony, calling around to see if someone would send me back to China for free.
Anyway, I ended up looking through The New York
Times job section one week to see if maybe someone
might be looking to hire a confused, impressionable
young person. After a series of sheisty interviews with
various "companies," I found a taker in the world that
Swatties loathe, protest or have nightmares about

letters

to

corporate America! Where I could work 9 to 5 and get
paid enough so that I could live in my apartment and
eat (every day!) while also being forced to read The
Wall Street Journal (it's not just for Republicans anymore) and use my skills of articulation to promote evil
things like insurance and asset management.
I know this sounds dreadfully awful to you. One of
my favorite authors, Jonathan Franzen 'Bl, once
referred to public relations professionals as "soulless
flacks" (or something similar), which broke my heart.
Sometimes, I go to industry meetings, where I meet
tons of other people who do the same thing I do for
higher salaries with half the intelligence. It amazes me
that we live in a society that can function this way.
The first day of the first year at Swat, they tell you
that, while you used to be at the top of your class, you
will now feel frustrated at being surrounded by intellectual equals or even superiors. Can I just say that it
is even more stunning to be surrounded by people who
are successful not because they are smarter than you,
but because they were somehow lucky or strategic or
knew how to "play the game"?
That really makes me kvetch on a daily basis
that
you-know-who is in office while some really smart guy
who just "didn'tknow how to play the game" is maybe
mayor of a small town in Nebraska or an organic
farmer in Iceland. I think it's fabulous that Swatties
travel the world as secular missionaries of truth, but
for the love of God, save your own, too right here in
corporate fuckin' America!
I guess this message doesn't go for everyone. If you
know in your heart that you want to teach in Latin
and say hi to
America, please don't let me stop you
my best friend and half my graduating class. But if you
are afraid not to go to Latin America, and afraid of succumbing to a higher tax bracket or acquiring a nondescript title of "vice president" (which, by the way, they
hand out like candy up in this joint), don'tbe. There's
a war out here, and we're losing.

audience that afternoon, we believe
the statement to be a slur against
working people, in that it suggests
that' certain employees of the college are not capable of responsibly

Grade inflation is for the weak
Dear Editor:
I was disappointed to read last
week's editorial ("Inflating Woes,"
March 25, pg. 13) which encouraged
Swarthmore faculty to "strike a bal-

ance" between too much grade infla-

tion and not quite enough. This recommendation was ostensibly made
to prevent "putting Swarthmore stu-

dents at an unfair disadvantage"

when they apply to graduate school.
Frankly, I think we can rest
assured that the Swarthmore

April

X 2004

administration will do everything
in its power to make sure that the
grad school world understands our
grading system. A low grad school
admissions rate just doesn't fit in
with the Meaning of Swarthmore, if
you catch my drift.
Furthermore, this discussion of
"tough grading" reveals a character
flaw peculiar to Swatties: We want
to challenge ourselves with the most
intense academic program and compete against the best minds of our

generation, sure, but we still want

to get an A every time. OK, OK, anywhere else, they would have promoted you to full professor after
your freshman year, but face it:
You're not somewhere else. You're
here, and you've got the privilege of
professors who will grade you
against your own potential.
Suck it up, Swattles; if you wanted to get A's, you should have gone
to Harvard.

A class by itself
We here at 90% HalfMental firmly believe that each sport
has its own character. Professional football is by nature a
capricious, parity-driven beast. With this in mind, at the
beginning of each season you can easily remove half of the
previous year's playoff teams from contention. We do it
every year without even thinking much about it.
NBA basketball is a sport with a split personality. The
Eastern Conference behaves mostly like the NFL. Only three
teams are really shoe-ins (Detroit, Indiana and New Jersey),
while the rest of the field is
almost impossible to call at
the beginning of the season.
It doesn't help that most of
these
"contenders" are
godawful. We take one look
at the NBA East and think,
"How can we pick any of

these teams to make the
playoffs? They're all gonna
end up 38-44." Meanwhile,
the
Western
NBA

teams: San Antonio, Dallas,

the Lakers, with the other
Half
three playoff teams coming
from Seattle, Portland,
Utah, Houston and Phoenix
on a revolving basis. This year is no different, with only the
inclusion of Memphis and the contention ofDenver as minor
surprises.
And then there is baseball. Baseball is in a class all by
itself in regards to maintaining a playoff status quo. We
did a little research at baseball-reference.com and we
found that, since baseball realigned in 1995, only twice
have the American and National League playoffs not
included at least two teams that made the playoffs the year
before. It happened in 2000 in the American League and
back in 1997 in the National League. Every other year, at
least two of the playoff teams in each league had been there
the previous year. So yes, humble reader, in baseball's
playoffs, nothing much really changes from year to year.
Theoretically, this should make predicting the playoff
teams easier than ever. Take two of last year's teams from
the American League playoffs and add life from the National
League and pick four more contenders, and there you have
it, instant playoffs. So the task is now to decide which of last
year's playoff teams are due for a spill and which teams will
perch Brave-and-Yankee-like for years to come.
Looking at the American League, it may be worse than
we at first suspected. The Yankees have made the playoffs
every year since realignment, and the Athletics have tasted postseason beer four years running. The American is
definitely a league of established powers. We shall boldly
predict, however, that the Athletics' streak of playoff
appearances will end this season. They shall be supplanted
by the last AL West team to win the World Series, namely
the Anaheim Angels. The Angels now have the best player
in the AL West in Vlad Guerrero, along with a quality staff
and a first-rate bullpen. As much as it sickens us to admit
it, the Yankees are again well on their way to the postseason, and we believe the Red Sox will join them, although
some of the inflated win totals being projected for both
teams are wildly optimistic as every AL East team has
improved greatly. Meanwhile, the Central will again be a
three-team dogfight, out of which the Twins will probably
emerge like clockwork sometime next August.
The National League will be a little more wide open this
year, mostly due to the decline of the once-mighty Atlanta
Braves. The NL East will be especially wide open and we will
call on the hometown Phillies to meet their destiny and
charge into the playoffs. The NL Central is again a powerhouse division, out of which the Cubs and Astros should
emerge on the shoulders of their vaunted pitchers. And out
of the NL West, we will pick our one sleeper, the San Diego
Padres. All the other NL West teams are essentially on their
way down and we can see the youthful Padres becoming next
year's 2003 Marlins.
So, for those of you just skipping ahead, we've picked
the Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, Angels, Phillies, Cubs,
Astros and Padres to make the playoffs. What happens
after that we believe to be completely unpredictable. But
what the hell? Phillies over the Yanks in seven games.

Mental

Buzzards drop two games in D.C.
BY MATT SCHILLER
mschilll@swarthmore.edu
The Evil Buzzards, Swarthmore's
men's rugby team, traveled south
down 1-95 last weekend to play in a
tournament in Washington, D.C. The
team felt they had a relatively successful weekend despite losing both
their games and having to deal with
poor field conditions and a lack of
organization by the tournament
administrators.
The tournament, organized by
George Washington, was hosted at
Anacostia Park. The Evil Buzzards
braved low-quality fields to put forward a solid performance.
"The fields weren't level at all,"
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 said. Still,
the team managed to dodge the hills
and escape major injury. The
Buzzards looked competitive despite
losing both matches. They fell 21-12
to Johns Hopkins and 28-12 to

American.

With many of their top players

missing due to injury or too much
work, the Buzzards looked for new
players to step up to carry the team.
Speedster Erik Munroe 'O4 as well
as big-time players Tyler Strombom

'O6, Kaena Horowitz 'O6, John Egan
'O6 and Brandt Rakowski 'O6 were
all out of action for the tournament.
In their absence, David Gentry
'O5 scored a try in his first game
with the Buzzards, and Rodriguez
came through in the clutch with his
first try ever. Michael DeFillipo 'O4
and Ed Sheldon 'O4 also added tries
in strong performances for the
Buzzards.
"We had a great showing," Randy
Goldstein 'O5 said. "Unfortunately,
we were a bit depleted due to
injuries, but the guys who went had
a really strong showing and really
looked good."
Several other players who do not
normally get the chance to start for

the Buzzards also took advantage of
the gaps in the roster. Some of the
bright spots at the tournament

included Joseph Kille 'O6, Ryan
Hammond 'O7, Greg Robinson 'O6 and
Aaron Hollander 'O7.
Poor organization by the tournament's administration caused an
array of problems. The Evil
Buzzards got lost and showed up
late because of bad directions.
Another team they were scheduled
to play failed to show, so they
scheduled a second game with
American after they got there.
Although the Buzzards are not
rushing to make plans for next year's
D.C. tournament, the club enjoyed
the experience.
"It was fun," Rodriguez said. "I
thought we played well. We're really looking forward to Franklin and
Marshall this weekend."
The Evil Buzzards are confident
about
their chances against
Franklin and Marshall. The team
hopes to have almost all its players
back from injury by then.

"If we play as well as we can play
we will beat them," Goldstein said.

College hoops
brings excitement
After a brief lull, the sports world is finally beginning to heat up. This
weekend brings opening night of the baseball season. Next weekend, my
favorite of the year, is the Masters, followed the next week by the end of
the basketball regular season. The hot topic around town right now, however, is obviously this weekend's Final Four, with Oklahoma State and
Georgia Tech squaring off Saturday to meet the winner of the "unofficial
title game" between UConn and Duke.
The consensus is that the two ACC
teams will both lose Saturday, and then
UConn will trounce Oklahoma State on
Monday night. Just listen to college basketball

has more parity than ever before. And

Swarthmore graduate Alan Valentine played on the 1924 men's Olympic rugby team, pictured above.

Swat's own gold medalist
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
What does it take to be an

Olympian? Can Swarthmore athletes become Olympic athletes?

"*

For one Swattie in the 19205, the
answer was yes.
Alan Valentine '2l is the only
Olympian to have attended
Swarthmore. During his time
here, he played football, lacrosse
and tennis, yet he maintained a

Swarthmore student's view of
athletics.
"There is much that is good
in athletic competition, but

when a victory becomes a

necessity

to

maintain
the
morale of students and alumni,
when the clamor of sports journalists and locker room critics
affects its policy, a university

has sold its birthright;" the
was quoted by Ernest

A. Paviour in Valentine's 1980
obituary.

Valentine was a Rhodes
Scholar, graduating from Balliol
College at Oxford in 1925. A year
before his graduation, he took
part in the 1924 Olympic Rugby
games in Paris. The US Olympic
rugby team of 1924 comprised
primarily football and basketball
All-Americans.
Most
were
Stanford students or graduates
who had never played rugby
before. At Oxford, Valentine had
been chosen three times for an
annual rugby match against
Cambridge. On the way to Paris
'for the 1924 games, he was picked
up at Oxford to play for the US

team.

The

22

210-pound All-American

played a role in the shocking 173 victory over the French
Olympic rugby team. France,
having trained and perfected a
proud squad, invited Romania

crowd erupted into anger as
Jauguery was taken from the
pitch unconscious and bleed-

and the United States, knowing
the teams would provide an easy
victory that would lead to the
French national rugby team's
first gold medal. While the
United States defeated Romania
37-0, France felt sure of victory,
since they had defeated Romania
by a much greater margin of 613. The Romanian and American

strength and athletic ability, but

rugby teams

were more ceremo-

nial opposition than actual competition to the French team. To
France, the American team was
made up of star athletes, but not

experienced rugby players.
One Stanford All-American
halfback, Norman Cleaveland, is
quoted in Mark Jenkin's article
from the 1924 Olympic Gold, "An
American Victory in Paris," saying "We were told to go to Paris
and take our beatings like gentlemen."
To France's surprise and
fury, in front of a crowd between
35,000 and 40,000, the American
team trounced the proud French
team. The outraged French fans
began beating American supporters, and the players had to
be escorted off the field by

guards.
Adolphe Jauguery, a player
on the French team, was considered one of the fastest rugby
players alive. Jenkins writes,

"The third touch of the ball was

Adolphe's last. Alan Valentine
found the small winger in the
open field and leveled him. The

ing."
Valentine

contributed

his intellectualism and political
sway were perhaps greater than
any physical contributions he
made. Valentine not only helped

to raise the United States rugby
team for the Olympics, but he
also invented

a new tactical

playing formation that helped
defeat the French, who simply
couldn't master the new strategy
.

After Valentine's participa-

tion in the 1924 Olympics, he
became dean of admissions at
Yale. He went on to serve as president of Rochester University. At
age 34, he was the youngest president in Rochester's history.

Valentine's administration last-

ed 15 years, through the close of
the Great Depression as well as
the sink and surge if enrollment
during and after World War 11.
As Valentine explained to the
Board of Trustees, he had only
planned to stay for 10 years, but
the Second World War had made
him change his plans. In 1949,
Valentine submitted his resignation. He had taken a year's leave
of absence to become chief of
Economic Cooperation, or the
Marshall
the
Plan,
in
Netherlands.
Yes, Swarthmore produced an
Olympian, both athletically and
academically. His ability to
bring the Crum to the scrum has
made an imprint on the history
of the college.

a lock to win the title this weekend?
Perhaps, but only if UConn didn't have Caron Butler, who would be in
his senior year. Imagine if Maryland still had Chris Wilcox, if Syracuse
had Carmelo Anthony, and if T.J. Ford had remained at Texas. Think of
the talent there would be in the tournament if Kwame Brown, Leßron
James, Eddie Curry, Tyson Chandler and Amare Stoudamire were in college.
Obviously, players today

are leaving college earlier than ever, and
more are passing up college altogether to receive big money in the NBA.
Duke had never had a player leave early until a few years ago, when three
left in the same year. The Tim Duncan (and, switching sports, Peyton
Manning) model of staying in school all four years, honing talent and then
cashing out big time and becoming one of the best players in the game is
far past us. Instead are the days of taking the big and easy paycheck and
leaving college after one year.
What, though, does this mean for the college game? Simply that parity

will be the norm for years to come. Certainly the game isn't any less exciting than in years past. The NCAA Tournament is one of the most, if not

the most, exciting times of the year, where youngsters play as a cohesive
unit striving toward a single goal instead of as individuals trying to please
the overpaying fans. What does this mean for the fans? More close games,
intense rivalries, buzzer-beaters and solid fundamentals, and plenty to
discuss around the office.
What will be discussed around the office next week is the dominance
that UConn will show this weekend. Though surprisingly a two seed, the
Huskies were, and still are, many people's favorites, and rightfully so, to
cut down the nets in San Antonio. The team is downright explosive. Led
by All-America center Emeka Okafor, likely the number-one overall pick
in June's NBA Draft, the Huskies have a solid inside game with outstanding perimeter play. In last Saturday's Regional Final, Okafor alone had
five blocks in the first eight minutes of the game. Though Okafor played
only 19 minutes due to a shoulder injury and had only two points, the
Huskies led by 24 at halftime on their way to a blowout victory over
Alabama. In his absence, guard Ben Gordon poured in 36 points, and top
reserve Charlie Villanueva continued his dominating presence from off
the bench. If Okafor recovers from injury by Saturday, I can guarantee
you that UConn will win the national title.
The Huskies' biggest hurdle this weekend will be a strong, but not
deep, Duke team, one that is disciplined and extremely well coached. One
interesting matchup to watch will be Blue Devil senior guard Chris
Duhon, the team's leader and best defender, against UConn's sharpshooter Ben Gordon. Former high school teammates Villanueva and Luol Dang,
arguably Duke's best all-around player, face off in another matchup that
features the nation's top two freshmen.
Most of the nation will be rooting for Duke, because, let's face it, people jump on the Duke bandwagon. Cheering for Duke is like cheering for
the Yankees. People do it because they're always good and everybody else
is doing it. The Yankees always have the best talent, and Duke always has
the best-looking girls. But it will be the Huskies who will win the basketball game. The talent and depth of UConn is too much for anybody else to
match. Ironically, not since the Blue Devil teams of the early 1990s with
Bobby Hurley, Christian Laettner and Grant Hill has a team been so
loaded and so clearly better than any other team in the country.

Dory accepted as swim team recruit for '04
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ECON
jelloshots@swarthmore.eclu
When the Admissions Office sent acceptance letters last
Friday, the entire swim team crossed its fingers. By
Monday, the group was all smiles.
The women's swim team secured one of the top recruits
for the class of 2008. Dory, the lovable and optimistic blue
fish who recently starred in Disney and Pixar's "Finding
Nemo," will ride the tide to Swarthmore next year.
Boasting a 400-medley time of 4:05.64 and a 200-freestyle
time of 2:00.04, Dory will be a great asset to the squad in
many events. Head coach Sue Davis already has high
hopes for the young star.

"Just keep swimming. Just keep
swimming. Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming."
Dory 'OB
"We are absolutely thrilled that Dory will be joining the
team next year," Davis said. "We'll have Dory swimming
as many events as she can. I'm sure you'll be seeing her
name in the record books within weeks of the season's
beginning."
Dory was recruited by some of the top schools in the
nation, both Division 111 and Division I. Her coach said
acceptance to Swarthmore was just what the young fish
was looking for.
"She visited Swarthmore in February and decided,
despite the climate, that she'd love to study and swim
here," Marlin said. "She took one look at Ware Pool and
was amazed. The swimming facilities were some of the
best she'd ever seen."
Dory, like most of the Swat swimmers, took to the water
at a young age. But the blue fish has trained mostly in salt
water, under environmental stress. She's trained by dodging jellyfish, sharks and seagulls. Adjusting to Ware Pool
should not pose a problem.
"I am really looking forward to getting into college and
swimming with some harder competition. I've always
liked competition. You just got to work really hard and just

keep swimming, just keep swimming," she said.
Dory's achievements stretch beyond the waters. Fluent
in English, Australian and Whale, she plans to take on a
modern languages major at Swat. She hopes her career
path will lead her to a job in international waters. She also
looks forward to joining the International Club and starting a group to lobby against the serving offish at Sharpies.
"Fish are friends, not food," she said.
Dory is not the only "Finding Nemo" character sought
after by the Garnet. Squirt Turtle, who would enter in the
class of 2012, has already been receiving round-the-clock

Jim Bock '9O. "Squirt
would really add diversity to our campus. I think if Dory
has a good time here, Squirt won't be far behind," Bock

said.
,
How hard will Dory's transition be from the open ocean
to the confines of the borough of Swarthmore? And how
nervous is she to meet her human teammates? Not very,
according to the bubbly fish.

Conference Championships. And yes, I'm a natural blue,"
she said.
