Three months after thousands of dollars of vandalism
was done to the campus during Senior Week, the College
has yet to learn the identities
of the perpetrators. The crimes
led to a disruption of Senior
Week activities and a considerable amount of anguish, anger, and soul-searching on the
part ofboth the graduating seniors and the administration.
While school officials were
unable to give the exact dollar
figure of damage done, the
damage reported by the
to
grounds crew alone

—was $1,520. In addition to
destroying school property, the
vandals apparently attacked
three cars, one of which belonged to a student and one of
which belonged to electrical
contractors hired by the College (see chart).
All of the damage occurred
the night of Thursday, May 29,
to Friday, May 30. According
to Associate Dean Tedd
Goundie, word first came of
the vandalism when Sharpies
workers discovered a small
fire burning on their loading
dock at 2:28 a.m., at which
point they notified Public

and

Swarthmore Police Department were also notified. The
full extent of the damage was
not realized until the next
morning. The Dean's Office
then decided to cancel Senior
Week activities for that day;
Goundie notified the senior
class representatives via email,
who then reported the cancellation to the rest of the senior
class. "There were some members of the class who...were

very upset and disgruntled
about cancelling Senior Week
events," said Goundie, "but the
vast majority understood and,
I think, agreed with the action
we took." He explained that
the decision to cancel Senior
Week events was made in part
to limit alcohol consumption
"I can't imagine a sober
person doing this." There had
been a senior toga party, with
alcohol served, in Paces the
night of the 29th. Senior Week

The first days of orientation prove to hectic with all the frosh moving in.
By Emily

Shartin

The thunder was rolling in fast. "We
just started piling up the logs," says
Sanford DeVoe 'OO. "I was hoping the fire
wouldn't go out. And then when the rain
came, I was afraid that hardly anyone
would show up."
Almost everyone remembers participating in the first-year welcome-wagon
tradition known as the trust walk; for
many, the blindfolded group procession
down to the Crum remains the zenith of
the "Camp Swarthmore" orientation ex-

perience. But this year's walk became
particularly memorable for the incoming
Class of 2001 thanks to the arrival of an
uninvited summer thunderstorm.
Luckily, despite the worries of DeVoe
and his fellow Orientation Committee
members, just about everyone did eventually make it down to the field to get
themselves soaked and witness the stalwart bonfire that managed to withstand
the downpour. "We were worried at first,
but everyone had a great time. It turned
into something that people will remember for the rest of their lives," says DeVoe.

And apparently it's not the only thing
they will remember either. Other events
cited as orientation highlights were Bob
Gross' infamous "No matter what you say
or do to me, I'm still a worthwhile person" address, the first collection, and the
movies on Parrish Beach. The Orientation Committee also test ran a new activity this year called the Quaker Matchbox,
where they broke the freshmen class
down into small dinner groups to discuss
stereotypes. "The idea was to have 3 or 4
people actually get to know each other
beyond the typical orientation greeting of
'What's your name? Where are you
from?'" says Arun Mohan 'OO, an Orientation Committee member. "It didn't work
out exactly how we'd planned it, but I
think the idea was good, and it did get
people talking."
"I was just happy to meet all the freshmen in general," says Nyssa Taylor 'OO,
one of 69 CAs who helped run this year's
orientationactivities. The Class of 'Ol has
already been described as "very friendly,"
"very cool," "willing to try stuff," and, in
light of the trust walk affair, "able to cope
with whatever comes next."
But perusing the admissions statistics
for the new freshmen class, other favorable adjectives start to come to mind as
well. Fifty seven members of the Class

Colleges voice concern over rankings
Sixty college
heads debate
US News'
annual report
By

Frank

Murray

For a second year,
Swarthmore College has held
on to the top spot in U.S. News
and World Report's annual
ranking of national liberal arts
colleges. The rankings, which
score every college and
university's performance in
such areas as academic reputation, faculty resources and financial resources, showed
Swarthmore edging out
Amherst College by a single
point and Wellesely and Williams Colleges by three points
each.
The College's score, however, has come amidst the
grumblings of presidents (and
presumably staffers) from at
least sixty different schools.

According to Swarthmore
President Al Bloom, the U.S.
News rankings were the subject of an "informal discussion" between 60 college
presidents at a June meeting
of the Annapolis Group.
Bloom, who chairs the group,
said he cannot remember
which college's president initiated the discussion, but that
pressuring U.S. News to adopt
a less detrimental way of presenting its information and
ending cooperation with the
magazine altogether were
both options that were vocalized. Annapolis Group members who were present for the
meeting—there are presidents
from 94 colleges in the
group—were the presidents
from Amherst, Williams,
Reed, Bowdoin, Dickinson,
Franklin & Marshall and
Hampshire.
For a small college, a high
ranking in the "Best Colleges"
issue can be a boon in terms
of national publicity as well as
a pleasant reassurance that the

college's commitment to education is being appreciated.
But a low score—even a score
•that falls just below the top tier
of 25 —can be equally devastating if prospective students
or their parents use the
rankings to eliminate all but
the schools with the best ratings. "Of course the Administration is pleased," says Tom
Krattenmaker who directs
Swarthmore's News and Information Office, "but a negative
aspect to the rankings is that
they do a disservice to some
excellent institutions and its
unfortunate if students take
them too seriously. You still
have to visit and do other research."
Like it or not, however, colleges have not been able to
simply to end their involvement with U.S. News and its
rankings. Reed College,
which two years ago decided
not to cooperate with surveys
from the magazine, discovered
that the U.S. News was able to
get statistical information on

Reed from the NCAA or accrediting agencies. When information wasn't publicly
available, U.S. News made
"statistical inferences." Currently, Reed is one of only two
liberal arts colleges not cooperating with U.S. News and
World Report and Bloom and
Krattenmaker both seem to
think the chances that other
schools will follow the
Oregon's school's lead are
slim. "A more constructive
approach," counsels Bloom,
"is to work with their editors
to make improvements."
Unfortunately, even for
Swarthmore, sticking with the
rankings has already brought
the administration under criticism once. In August, when
the College posted a link to the
U.S. News website from the
College's homepage, alums
complained to Krattenmaker
and the News and Information
Office. "They said it was too
'rah-rah' to put the U.S. News
#1 ranking on the web-page,"
admitted Krattenmaker.

Min Lee

Student Council was forced
to undergo a change in person-

nel for the first time this year as
Mandara Meyers '99, co-chair
and Outreach Chair-designate
announced her resignation from
both posts.
Meyers had reached her decision over the summer. A letter of notification was sent to
the council in early July.
The would-be co-chair was
first elected to Student Council at the beginning of the year
as the student representative to
the Council on Educational
Policy (CEP). She later on ran
successfully for the position of
Outreach Chair, which she was
due to assume at the start of
this semester.
Meyers cited several reasons for her resignation. The
problems plaguing the spring
elections co-chair elections
had led her to become disillusioned with the council. The
former drew complaints questioning the reliability of the
existing electoral procedures.
After the co-chair elections,
certain council members had
in private expressed their dissatisfaction with the results.
Meyers felt she could not serve
in a body which demonstrated
such a "lack of faith and trust
in the decisions it made." The
organization was also overshadowed by an atmosphere of
mistrust and conflict, according to Meyers. "There was a
lot of resentment within council," she said.
The structural inadequacies
of the council also factored
into her consideration. Meyers
said she came to the realization that "as a single member,

One

decision, made a little over two
years ago, turned back three de
cades of progress in this country.
In eliminating the use of race as one, among
many, factors in admissions to the University of California system, the California
Board of Regents has effectively ended the
second Reconstruction.
The Supreme Court's ruling in Plessy vs.
Ferguson which legalized Jim Crow laws,
reversed the
progress triggered by the

abolition of slavery. Luckily,
the court realized its mistake
and ushered in a
new era of Reconstruction in
1954 when the
justices made
Vincent
their ruling in
Brown vs. the Board of Education. Since
then, several legislative acts, judicial rulings,
and social movements have pushed this
country closer to embracing its fundamental creeds of liberty and equality. Unfortunately, those advances in civil rights and social justice have been gradually eroded by

Jones

the rabid forces of the conservative revolution, along with the tacit support of a largely
unresponsive opposition.
Now the tables have been turned completely. Race cannot be a factor in admissions in the best state college system in the
country. Proposition 209, which prohibits
the use of preferences for women and minorities in California (but says nothing
about preferences for other groups which
exist) took effect last week. The Supreme
Court is moving closer to outlawing programs or systems which expand opportunities for groups denied access to the political system, higher education, and the
workforce, de facto and de jure. Moreover,
the current conservative majority in most
state legislatures, Congress, and federal
courts precludes the judicial strategy employed in the Civil Rights movement to fend
off these attacks.
So what happens now? Do those of us
who care continue to sit around and complain about what's going on? Should we just
say that it's just too bad that the UC
Berkeley's law school will only have one
Black student in their incoming class this
year, when it was the poster child for diversity two years ago? Do those of us who
have "made it" ignore the situation and fo-

cus even harder on furthering our own interests? What about thosefighting for civil rights
and social justice who stand to gain the least
white liberals? Should
tangible benefits
throw
the
towel and go on with
in
they just
their lives? And conservatives, should they

just celebrate their recent victories?
NO! Everyone needs to realize that the
widening racial and economic divide threatens the stability of our republic, the safety of
our streets, and the lives of Americans. Even
if you oppose programs which fall under the
affirmative action umbrella, you should care
about the lives of ordinary people regardless
of their skin color. We should not forget that
we fought a civil war largely due to the atrocities of the "peculiar institution". Nor should
we forget the Kemer commission's findings
following the period of massive civil unrest
in America's cities. A panel of appointed men
and women concluded that America was becoming two nations: one black and one white,
separate and unequal.
If we as a nation do not want to use affirmative action to address the racial inequities which exist in this country due primarily to institutionalized racism, then we
should at least propose a viable alternative
If not, then we can only blame ourselves
for what lies ahead in the future.

Diversity must be thought out
And thus, a new year begins...another
chance for Sharpies to offer breakfast bar
several times in a given day, another batch
of courses inexplicably using the word
"other" as a noun in their titles, and a fresh
wave of frosh which hasn't yet been indoctrinated with the political buzzwords and
catch-phrases of the day. Swatties are deeply
concerned with the problems of the modern age, and fancy themselves able to positively effect
changes that
will better the
world. Unfortunately, far too
often they get

surimages

Damon Taaffe the detrimentof
their ultimate
goals
One immediate example of this fanaticism
is that one can hardly go a day, much less a
semester, without being assaulted by a wave
of "diversity" mantras. Parrish Parlors is perennially spangled with posters decrying the
homogenous nature of some corporation or
other, Phoenix writers seemingly opine
weekly that everyone being the same color
is a bad thing; heck, even the trays in
Sharpies are forums for pontification. Considerthe nauseating extent of the rage: when
Swarthmore hires a Latino professor to
teach Spanish, it has diversified the faculty.
When a new course is offered, the department has diversified the curriculum. Perhaps
the culmination of this mania was reached
last spring when students argued that stores
in the Ville needed more diverse hours of
operation. That's right: not only do we need
more racial diversity in our student body and
more curricular diversity in our classrooms,
but we also need more temporal diversity
in our consumption choices!
Diversity has become as great a sacred
cow as has ever been present on college
campuses. In effect, it serves as a magic
bullet: a student need only couch an other-

kk

Claiming diversity when only appearances have changed is thepurestform

wise-tenuous position in terms of enhanc-

ing diversity, and the argument essentially
becomes immune to all but the most masochistic of adversaries. After all, to argue
against diversity would be to argue for homogeneity, which invariably leads, after
much eye-rolling, taunting, and groaning in
disgust, to accusations ofracism that effectively end any useful dialogue. Anyone who
attempts to question this system is immediately pistol-whipped with the Colt 45 of
scorn and spat upon by the tobacco chewer
of infamy, and after a period of months, the
moderate conservative might as well wear
a scarlet "A" on her chest for all the respect
she receives.
This is a truly lamentable situation, because it masks the fact that often Swatties
don't consider what another person says
unless it is phrased in acceptable terms. In
this case, the acceptable term, diversity, really means very little. Consider the history
of Swarthmore: as any diversity advocate
will agree, it's been a very homogenous
place—white people everywhere and controlling everything. Yet, it's also traditionally been one of the most liberal campuses
in the country, and this is telling. Consider
that, during the last couple of years,
Swarthmore admissions has finally succeeded in its long-term goal of diversifying
the student body's racial composition. So
now students represent different ethnicities,
but they don't necessarily think much differently, if political alignment and public
discourse are any reliable indication.
If simply having a student body that "looks
different" is really the goal of the administration, then congratulations and a pat on
the back„because they've succeeded. If this
is the case, however, that's very disappoint-

ing. The reason is that, at its most basic,
higher education is supposed to be about the
exchange of ideas. Simply changing how
people look in no way equates to changing
how people think, and it is insulting to think
otherwise. Most would admit that having all
students of exactly the same background
would make for a rather uninteresting campus—as if this were a danger, or even a possibility. Simple experience does not a person make, and even if this weren't the case,
no two people's lives are ever identical
enough to realize the threat of cognitive
homogeneity.
Cognitive diversity, then, is the key. It
matters not what color a person is or what a
she has lived through; ultimately, people are
a product of how they view the world and
what contributions they envision themselves
making. Claiming diversity when only appearances have changed is the purest form
of superficiality. If there is such a thing as
tyranny of the majority, that tyranny arises
when a group fixates on an idea or image
and refuses to tolerate any variation from
this incestuous doctrine. When diversity
loses sight of who people are and focuses
on how they appear, it becomes a tool of
destruction rather than a means of bettering
the world.

Contrary to some recent media reports it is not possible to buy a minor
planet. If you have a name you would like to apply, the best advice is
"Go out and discover one!".
Accepted names are announced when they are published in the

Swat Around the World

Bv Jen Chen

You

know, you've been in Taiwan
too long if you start wearing
long-sleeved shirts in this heat."
My friend Christine, who was in
Taipei to learn Chinese, commented as we
frantically fanned ourselves in an air-conditioned restaurant. One thing to know about
Taiwan, if you ever want to visit, is that it is
unbearably hot and humid. Aside from the
typhoon days, the two months that I had
spent with my grandparents in Kaohsiung
(Southern Taiwan) were days where just sitting around was enough to induce bucketsfull of sweat. However, the people who live
there will gladly wear long-sleeved shirts
and jeans and carry umbrellas in that
weather to avoid getting tanned. Since my
sister Stephanie and I were unaccustomed
to the heat, we were quite the oddities,
there, decked out in our shorts and tanktops.
Aside from the climate, it was difficult to

blend into the Taiwanese society. Having
been born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, I was confident that I could fit in well into the lifestyle
or at least be inconspicuous in a crowd. But,
people would actually come up to Steph and
me and ask where we were from. Of course,
proud of my heritage, I would inform them
that I was from Taiwan. They would laugh
and say, "No, where are you really from?"
Unfortunately, the place where I once called
jia (home) could no longer accept me as a
member of its society. To the Taiwanese I
had met this summer, I still looked Chinese
but I was "truly an American." Stephanie
did not even have the privilege of looking
Chinese.
This summer, Steph and I were in Asia
during one of the most important moments
in its history-the return of Hong Kong to
China. Hong Kong's return may mark the
beginning of a new phase in Chinese-Taiwanese relations. As some people told us,
we were lucky to visit Taiwan while it was
still democratic.

Movie Committee's First Strike
By Fred Bush
Jessica Harbour

With

another semester comes an
other spate of fresh-off-the-bigscreen, or at least no more than
stale,
movies brought to you by the
slightly
Movie
Committee. Also come
omnipotent
two new reviewers, since the old ones have
discovered they're no longer pass-fail. Of
course, Fred has gone
his
entire
through
Swarthmore career thinking
he's pass-fail, so rest assured he'll be at this for a
while.
The first film starts the
year off with a bang, a boom, and a lotta
ladder-swingin' action: Jackie Chsn's First
Strike. Jackie plays the intrepid Hong Kong
policeman Jackie (what realism!), who happens to be a martial arts expert (what acting!). Enmeshed in a complicated plot involving crazed Russian crimelords, Australian mafiosi, and skiing, it's mostly a vehicle
for Mr. Chan to display his incredible acrobatic abilities, battle hapless goons with whatever happens to be available, rescue beautiful women in wet suits, and introduce us to
the perils of wearing oversized costumes.
Basically, Jackie Chan's movies are
James Bond plus Bruce Lee plus Buster
Keaton. The comedy is physical, the women
comely, the villians in sunglasses and suits,
and the hero equipped with a great sense of
humor (and a koala). Chan has been popular in China and Hong Kong for decades
now, possibly in part because his movies
make no unsightly political statements
nobody's expecting, say, Jackie Chan Frees
Wei Jingsheng, though he should. This means
that a whole bevy of films are now just becoming available in the U.S.; if you leave First
Strike a Chan fan, check out some of his earlier work, especially Drunken Master 11.
Overall, we give Jackie Chan's First
Strike (which is actually not a "first" anything, but a sequel to Supercop) an 8.5 on a

James Bond, Bruce Lee, and Buster Keaton all in one. Jackie Chan's First
Strike is a must see, it's a real kick you might say.
l-to-10 scale. Fred awards it a 9, while I'
can only settle for an 8 since it has no
Michelle Yeoh. It does, however, have
Chan's classic outtake reel at the end, just
in case you can't believe he did his own
stunts, so be sure to stick around when the
credits start rolling. Ow!
On Saturday, we get the many-Oscarnominated, Scientologist-featuring comedy
Jerry Maguire, which should get praises
and kudos just for humanizing a sports
agent. The agent in question is played by
Tom Cruise: After realizing that hey, athletes making kazillions of dollars are people
too, he has a career crisis, gets fired, and
strikes out on his own. His only client is
Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod
Tillman (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who needs a
new contract (thus the "Show me the
money!" cry early in the film) and his only
aide a 26-year-old widow, Dorothy Boyd
(Renee Zellweger) with an only slightly annoying five-year-old kid (Jonathan

Lipnicki). Since it's a mainstream Hollywood comedy, Jerry eventually gets his career success back and caring Dorothy in
place of his old fiancee (Kelly Preston),
whose name is Avery but whom Fred is referring to as "Crazy Sex Bitch" because she
has two major scenes: one in which she
screws Jerry silly, and one in which she
punches him out.
Which brings us to Point #1 about Jerry
Maguire: Waiting to Exhale it's not. (Hey,
why isn't that on the list?) All the women
are either very bitter about men (such as the
divorced women who meet in Dorothy's
home) or amoral (Crazy Sex Bitch) or desperately needing men (Dorothy) or justplain
submissive (Jerry's secretary). The only truly
strong woman is Marcee, Rod's wife (Regina
King), who stands up for the man she loves.
Point #2: This movie is misadvertised:
don't see it for the romance. Jerry seems to

fall for Dorothy simply out of "loyalty," as he explains it, and because
he thinks her kid is cute. Sure, they're
happy at the end, but the romance is
actually the weak link of the story.
The main reason to see JerryMaguire
—and you should—is to watch the
friendship develop between Jerry and
Rod, for the scenes when they cut
away the macho posturing and talk
honestly. Gooding Jr. dances down
the end zone with the movie, and
Cruise seems a lot more sure of himself in those scenes than he does with
Zellweger.
And now for the extra point: Jerry
works as a wish-fulfillment fantasy for
all sports fans. We've allread the headlines about the imminent doom ofprofessional sports because ofrecord salaries, arrogant athletes, and greed-mongering agents; here's a fantasy world
where players recognize their "obligations" to the home fans; where agents
turn nice, and the greedy, money-is-everything superagent (played to smarmy
perfection by Jay Mohr) loses out in the
end. And the monetary figures are absurdly low. Rod holds out for a mere
$lO million over four years? Please!
Shaquille O'Neal makes that tying his
shoes.
Anyway, we agreed on a rating
of 6.5 for Jerry. It's not exactly Best
Picture material, but it's warm and
sweet and a nice way to spend a
couple hours. It also offers a chance
to see Cuba Gooding Jr. as God
made him. You could do worse.

the didgeridoo/He knew a girl who
he decided to woo to/under her balcony with a didgeridoo". At the end
of Didgeriblues the sound men returned to haul away the didgeridoo,
and theFemmes started to earn their
paycheck. Too bad they were the
ones that felt that way, with a constant stream of hits and bored expressions on their faces that made it
seem they were only killing time until the check cashed. Not to lay all
the blame on the Femmes, as time
constraints, bad marketing (anyone
who didn'tread the small type of the
Yo! Philly Festival ad was in the
dark), and a sparse, sing-along audience made for a strained one hour set.
For those who don't want to do the
math, that's only 15 minutes longer
than the set-up. But hey, as the announcer announced, Joseph Anthony
and The Reflections were reenacting
"Elvis' Aloha Concert: Live From
Hawaii" on another stage, so the
Femmes needed to be cut short.
Still, the Femmes were not cut
before they gave us $5 worth of music. "American Music," "Blister in
the Sun," and "Gone Daddy Gone"
are all deserved hits, were capably
performed, and enthusiastically received. Gano even took a precious
moment to talk with the crowd, saying we all had a special look, something that told him we were bonded
by one thing: "Public Transportation". Thus began Waiting For The
Bus, as the audience chanted "we
got the muuu-tha and the kids, the
guy and his date/we all get mad, we
all get laid", and the band walked
around the stage, wireless pick-ups
sending the sound to the outdoors
plaza and the burbling river. They
almost looked excited. The closer
came with what Ritchie called "our
only good song", Kiss Off, and the
Femmes left proclaiming they had
been told to keep the set short and
could not do an encore. We clapped
and shouted enough to get Yo! Philly
to ease up, and the band was pumped
up enough to deliver "Add It Up"
while at least looking like they were
having fun. With 9 of the 13 songs
coming off of"Add It Up", basically
a greatest hits compilation, the concert almost seemed like a reunion
tour, except that the songs still are
edgy and contemporary, and the
Femmes look too damn young.

The question remains as to the

seniors were faced with the awful
possibility that the vandals might be

would cause that amount of damage
to it." He mentioned the possibility
of alumni being involved: "I have
heard rumors that there were alums

So far, there have been few leads

development actually began with the
class of '97, though they were only

money. Future classes will be

Field hockey back again
By

Jean Quinn

After last year's championship
season, which included a bid to the
NCAA tournament, the field hockey
team began their next campaign for
glory.
Returning to campus early, the
players had one week of hard and
focused preseason work. "Preseason
went very well. We accomplished
all that I wanted," said Coach Karen
Borbee, who begins her second year
at the helm of the Garnet.
Senior co-captains Danielle Duffy
and Michelle Walsh agreed, evident
in Swat's performance at a playday
at Franklin and Marshall last Saturday.
In a scrimmage against Lebanon
Valley, who made it to theFinal Four
in last year's NCAA tournament,
Duffy scored the game's only goal
to give the Garnet a win. Duffy and
forward Holly Baker '99 each

knocked one past the goalie of Div.
I Catholic University in the second
scrimmage; however, CU scored a
trio of goals, one in the final minutes of the contest, to come away
with a victory.
Borbee commented on the scrimmages, "Our goal was to find our
strengths and weaknesses, as well
as see some combinations together.
I was pleased with what I saw and
know what to concentrate on in
practice."
"After a solid week of practice, we
were all very excited to play against
another team. We definitely have
some things to work on, but we're
already starting at a good level that
showed in the scrimmage against
Lebanon Valley," said center halfback Walsh. Considering that several key players graduated last year,
the team's impressive performance
bodes well as they strive for their

third consecutive Centennial Conference championship.
A talented group of freshmen
complement the core of returning
players. Two-time conference player
of the year Duffy expects the freshmen "to have a huge positive impact
on the team."
Coach Borbee feels the team has
a great deal of potential. "The
team has a different personality
from last year's, but we have the
potential to be even better than
last year's team," echoes Walsh.
"I think it will just be a matter of
everybody finding their roles on
the team, and then fulfilling them
the way they can. If people do
that, I know we can go back to the
NCAA tournament."
The Garnet officially open their
season tomorrow against Goucher.
Game time is 1 p.m. at Cunningham
Fields. All are invited to attend.

the Garnet Tide. The Tide open at home against Bethany.

Tide gains experience in
34-0 loss to Navy JV
By

Pat

Donaghy

While most students spent
Sunday afternoon unpacking
and preparing for the first day
of classes, the Garnet Tide
travelled to Annapolis, Maryland, to prepare for the upcoming season by scrimmaging
Division I Navy's JV squad.
Navy, fresh off a 9-3 season
which culminated with a victory over California in the
Aloha Bowl, had an extremely
large and talented recruiting
class as a result.
Though the foe would be
tougher than any team the Garnet would face all year, coach
Karl Miran hoped that the Tide
could use the scrimmage as a
warm-up for a strong Centennial Conference schedule. Additionally, the players anxiously awaited the game type
atmosphere after eight grueling days of preseason.
The coin toss was the only
part of the gamethat went right
in the first twenty minutes as
the Tide fell behind 21-0.
However, the last ten minutes
of the second half was a different story as the defense suc-

cessfully kept the Midshipmen
from putting points on the
scoreboard.
The offense rallied from
the physical play by the defense and put on a long drive
of its own led by sophomore
running back Joe Aleffi, who
finished with 75 yards rushing for the afternoon.
Swarthmore drove 70 yards
to the Navy 5-yard line, but
could not convert on a field
goal as the score remained a
21 point deficit heading into
the second half.
With most of the Garnet
playing on both sides of the
ball and Navy bringing in fresh
players from their 100-plus
roster, the Tidecould not compete and Navy JV took a decisive 34-0 win. Though the
team was disheartened by the
defeat, the team gained experience for the upcoming season.
The coaching staff was
pleased with great efforts by
many of the team's leaders.
Senior co-captain Bernard
Nossuli dominated the middle
of the defensive line, recording ten tackles. Senior co-cap-

tain Ben Hall, sophomore Lou
Basanese, and junior Brian
Bell were able to produce on
both sides of the ball while
learning new positions. Joe
Aleffi showed flashes of brilliance, giving promise to a running game that has been nonexistent in recent years.
Following an 0-10 year and
the loss of many key players
due to graduation and injury,
the Navy scrimmage was essential in gaining experience
for a young team featuring a
new offense.
The Tide will get two more
weeks of practice to finalize
themselves before opening
their season at home against
Bethany College (WV) next
weekend.
There is hope for a solid season with experienced option
quarterback JP Harris '99,
along with All-Conference returnees Hall and junior Mason
Tootell and ECAC all-star
Basanese. Freshman expected
to contribute immediately include Rob Castalucci, Ansa
Yiadom, Matt Asano, Jay
Schembs, and Tony Hillery.

Both the men's and women's
soccer teams feel that they are
ready for action as they begin
regular season play, hoping to
improve upon last year's
records in addition to building
a more unified program.
Captains for the women's
team this year are seniors
Claire Baxter, Sarah Jaquette,
and Betsy Rosenbaum. Alex
Ely returns as coach.
After enjoying five wins last
season (more than doubling
the previous year's win
record), they are, according to
Rosenbaum, "expecting to win
more than that this year." Only
one of last year's starters
graduated, and in addition to
seventeen returning women
the team boasts five first-years.
Junior Kirstin Knox will be
leading the midfield while
Baxter and Rebecca Schmitt
'OO lead defense. Both
Jaquette and Rosenbaum anchor the offense.
On Saturday the 6th, the
team will play at noon against
Goucher College on Clothier
Field as a part of the Swat Kick
Classic, their first regular season game. They will then either play Sunday at 10am or
lpm depending the results of
Saturday's contests. On
Wednesday, the 10th, they will

play Widener University at 4
p.m on Clothier Field.
The men's soccer team is
roaring to go after their intensive preseason of 7 a.m. and
afternoon practices. The team
has "a lot of depth" this year,
co-captain Matt Halpern '9B
said. Remaining on the team
are twenty-five men, "all of
whom," Halpern feels, "could
be starters." Cuts were also
made this year, a change from
years past. James Chen '9B
and Mike Schall '9B are joining Hearn as co-captains.
Other changes have occurred as well: men's soccer
boasts both a new coach and
a new offensive strategy this
year. Pete Dicce comes to
Swarthmore from his previous
coaching position at Sun Valley High School. He has been
well received by both the
men's and women's teams,
spending one afternoon assisting in the women's preseason
training.
This year, the team plans to
make use of their greater depth
by playing aggressively and
subbing frequently so as to
wear the opposition down,
rather than relying on one or
two key players. Alex Shaw
'OO will be playing sweeper for
the first time this year. The
midfield will be led by Chen,
Schall, and Austin Harris '99

Coach Dicce watches the men's team
during their 4-0 loss to Holy Family
while Halpern and Marcus
Shin 'OO lead the offense.
Adam Macßeth '99 will play
goalie.
The men played their first
game against Holy Family on
Wednesday afternoon. Though
they lost 4-0, they played solidly throughout the game. "It
was a positive experience for
us, although we're obviously
not thrilled with the result,"
Halpern said. Indeed, at half

time the score was 1-0. The
Garnet continued to move together well on the field and retained possession of the ball
for most of the time; Holy
Family, however, had a couple
of lucky breaks on which they
promptly capitalized. "We had
a lot of good things going on
on the field," Halpern said.
"This is really an adjustment
period for us and a time to be
working the kinks out."
