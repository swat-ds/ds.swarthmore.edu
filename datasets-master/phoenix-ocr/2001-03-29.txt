Public safety declares martial law
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Early Tuesday morning, Swarthmore students awoke
to find armed public safety officers waiting outside their

dorms.
In a reserved-students e-mail at 7:02 a.m., director of
public safety Owen Redgrave declared himself "Emperor
of Swarthmore," and decreed that the campus would be
held under martial law until further notice.
"I'm tired of being woken up at 4 a.m. because some
idiot is burning popcorn and sets off the fire alarm,"
Redgrave wrote in the e-mail. "The solution is simple:
we take away all of your rights, and our officers can finally be left in peace."

been stationed on top of
Clothier bell tower and the
dome of Parrish since early

Wednesday morning.
The Board of Managers
called an emergency meeting
Wednesday afternoon, and in
a narrow decision, decided
to endorse the Republic.

While the board showed solidarity before reporters,

some questions are being
raised about board members

"EVERYONEKNOWS WHAT THE GOP
THINKS OF SWARTHMORE
ANYWAY." GOVERNOR TOM RIDGE
-

"The campus of Swarthmore College is hereby declared a sovereign nation," His Holiness declared in a
fireside chat Tuesday evening. The Republic of
Swarthmore has since annexed the boroughs of
Swarthmore and Rutledge, as well as Springfield Mall
and Genuardi's.
At 8:37 a.m. on Wednesday, a SEPTA train bound for
Philadelphia was commandeered, and Emperor
Redgrave sent Swarthmorean delegates to meet with
Governor Tom Ridge and President Bush. As of yesterday, Ridge seemed receptive to the idea.
"We haven't had a good crisis in Pennsylvania in a
while, and everyone knows what the GOP thinks of
Swarthmore anyway," Ridge said. "Off the record, we're
looking forward to wiping you guys off the map."
The Office of the Empire released a revised student
handbook yesterday, listing "to be drawnand quartered"
as the result of the infraction of each rule. Snipers have

this kind of thing by consensus before," an anonymous
administrative assistant Emperor-for-life Redgrave
said. "It's really unlike them
to take a vote on issues like this." While not stated officially, there have been unconfirmed rumors that Miles
Dearborn '72 may step down from the Board of Managers.
Dearborn's term would have expired in May.
Students seem primarily unaffectedby the change in government.

"I've got an Engin paper to write, a lab report, and 300
pages to read before this afternoon," Berenice Kort 'O2 said.
"I really don't care who's running things around here, as
long as the professors don't stop coming."

Faculty members seem equally ambivalent.
"At first we thought, well, this is really going to suck, you
know?" astrophysics professor Maximilian Walpole said.
"But then, like, we said, 'Well, hey, they're still gonna pay
us, right?' So now we're not really that worried," he said.
Implications are unclear if the upcoming Family Weekend will be affected by the changes.
Redgrave has stated that he will not force immigrants
to obtain passports, but merely buy small identification
cards, which will be used to make C-BORD machines on
campus beep.

Eugene M. Lang stir fry? Could be...
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Eugene M. Lang '3B spoke about
the driving ambitions and principles
that have shaped his life in a special
lecture Monday in Martin.
"It has always been my aim to
have every building on campus bear
my name," Lang said, "I'm off to a
good start, but there is a long road
ahead. For instance, the building we

are gathered in tonight should be
called the Eugene M. Lang Building for
Biology, or whatever is taught here."
Lang dismissed objections that the
purpose of naming building is to differentiate them.
Later in his speech, Lang also emphasized the importance of prioritizing life

goals.
"An example of a secondary goal for
me would he having every tree on cam-

pus named after me. But that's not as important because nobody reads those little
tags anyway. Below that goal would be
donating my recipe collection to the
Lang Dining Hall."
He subsequently corrected himself,

rearranging his priorities after considering that students would probably find
dishes such as Eugene M. Lang stir fry
and Eugene M. Lang pumpkin casserole
appetizing.

College endowment up for grabs
The college announced late yesterday that it intends to
its entire billion-dollar endowment immediately.
Paul Aslanian, vice president for finance and planning,
said he determined that this move was in the college's best
interest after being convinced by the logic presented by a
variety of activist groups on campus about the long-term
benefits of spending the endowment now.
"After hearing so many students ask why, if the college
has so much money, it isn't willing to spend it on things
like extra paper towels, better pool tables, liquid soap or
higher wages for staff, we finally asked ourselves, 'Why
shouldn't it be?' Aslanian said.
The next step is to determine how best to burn through
more than $1 billion bucks before the April 1 target date
Aslanian has set for endowment depletion.
All groups, causes, students and departments are encouraged to direct spending proposals to Parrish 601
throughout the day. The winning proposal will be selected
by a random drawing.
Students were at no loss coming up with suggestions.
"I want a billion dollars' worth of orange marmalade
spend

"

that's actually orange. The stuff in Sharpies is yellow," a sopho-

more said.

Matt Rubin 'O4, president of the first-ever Swarthmore
Rifle Club, thinks the billion should be his. "Why should we
have to go off-campus for supplies and space for target practice?" Rubin wondered. "I want a full artillery as well as a
shooting range right here. There's no real reason not to convert the football field for our purposes at this point," he

pointed out.

As of June 1999, Swarthmore's endowment was the tenth
largest in the nation in terms of endowment money per student. As of June 2000, if all goes according to plan, the college's
endowment will be the smallest in the nation.
Historically, the college has tried to be fiscally resposible
in determining how the endowment is spent, attempting to
balance the college's current and future goals.
But Aslanian and others have since termed that policy "boring."
President Al Bloom said he firmly supported the decision
to spend the endowment. "Now everybody should be happy in
timefor parents' weekend," he said.

IN BRIEF

Daily Jolt dies
A crowd ofmourners, many of them freshmen, could be
seen gathered together in somber clumps around campus
last night, after the unexpected passing of the Daily Jolt.
"This is a great loss to the campus. The Jolt was a
much-needed champion of anonymous hate speech and
will be greatly missed," said Emily Yetanother 'O4.
The cause of death is yet to be determined, but some
speculated that the Jolt was the victim offoul play. "The
Jolt had many detractors, and so conspiracy theories
are difficult to rule out," Yetanother said.
Other students greeted the death of the Daily Jolt
with a different response: elation. "The Jolt was junk.
There is no substitute for writing on the walls of the
bathrooms in Cornell," said Julia Meristem 'OL
Memorial services will be held in the rose garden
Sunday at noon.

New coed housing
The deans of the college approved additional coed
housing yesterday. Students of the opposite sex will now
be allowed to room together in all rooms that are designated singles. Current occupancy limits will still apply
to all rooms, however.
"We are always looking for ways to give students new
housing opportunities, yet at the same time we don't
want to implement drastic changes overnight," Dean of
ResidentialLife MyrtWestphal said. By deciding to designate singles as coed rooms, the deans were able to satisfy student demands for coed housing without worrying about introducing any changes in the dorms that
could be called major.
Some students expressed confusion after being informed of the decision in a reserved students e-mail. A
rising junior said, "If it's just me in a single and it's
coed, that raises serious questions about my identity.
Am I two or am I one? I wonder. And there are practical
ramifications as well as a coed individual, wouldI be
able to choose which bathroom to use?"
Many

students were concerned that the new coed

singles do not improve housing options equitably for all
students especially not for those who intend to live
with a roommate. For those students, Westphal suggested
living in eitherthe lodges or the I and J sections of Worth.
The deansrecently decided to allow coed housing in those
dormsbeginning next semester, granting partial approval
of the housing committee's original proposal.

What every student
doesn't need: surveys
Yet another survey was sent via e-mail to a crosssection of students yesterday. It took approximately
twenty minutes longer than the last one to complete.
Few students took the survey seriously, and even
fewer had even an inkling as to its purpose.
"I wish it had arrived in my inbox as a reservedstudents e-mail, because then my e-mail program would
have automatically filtered it to the trash for me. Instead, it came from [Dean] Bob Gross so I made the mistake of reading it," a junior said.
Other students, while agreeing that the survey was
a waste of time, treated it as a welcome study break. "I
am always looking for new ways to procrastinate on
my economics problem sets," a sophomore said.

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Spring is in the air, and while the season
is being greeted enthusiastically by many
students, George Rose 'O4 wishes it were still
winter. "If today were a day in February, I
still would be anticipating attending
Swarthmore in the fall. Unfortunately, intervening events and the blooming offew flowers have changed all that for me."
Rose was caught by a member of the arboretum staff with bouquet of 13 daffodils
in his possession Saturday afternoon and
was subsequently charged a fine of $50,000,
leading him to decide to leave the college.

"Realistically speaking, it is too large a

financial burden for me to bear in addition
to tuition at this point, so I will be taking a
leave of absence," Rose said.
What Rose is calling his "nightmare
weekend" began around 4 p.m. Saturday, as

he was preparing for what he called a "real
date." Crossing Magill walk, Rose spied a
cluster of blooming yellow flowers and proceeded to pick them. "It was not premeditated," Rose said. "They caught my eye and
I just thought they would help get my
evening off to a good start."
Unfortunately for Rose, he never had a

for fireside chat
BY IMA PYRO
The next fireside chat will involve the use ofreal fire
and burning students, Student Council co-chair Colin
Moore 'O2 announced yesterday.
"Due to concerns expressed about the recent fire in
a Parrish kitchen, we've decided to take measures that
will improve fire safety awareness," said Moore.
SC plans to set fire to Parrish Parlors during next
Tuesday night's discussion and invite students to try to
extinguish it. Additionally, two or three Swarthmore
students will be thrown into the blaze. Moore said he
hoped the chat "will serve as an effective scare tactic."
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave agreed to
participate in the fireside chat because he believes the
event will serve as a much-needed wake-up call for the
student body. "Here at Public Safety we follow a general policy of victim deterrence," he told The Phoenix
yesterday. "Once students see what can hurt them and
where the dangers lie, they'll adjust their behavior appropriately."
Campus Relations Representative Sonal Bhatia 'O2
sought to calm students'anxieties about the event. "Only
dispensable students will be burned," she said.
Free pizza, cookies and marshmallows will be served.

Hungry for 3.4 sandwiches?
Student Council announced it will holding a refer-

endum to allow students to determine how a three-byfour-foot space in the basement of Parrish should be
used. The Swa-Wa proposal has been resurrected after

being edged out by the computing center last semester.
"This space is a bit smaller, but we estimate we could
keep about 3.4 sandwiches stocked a night," said a proposal supporter. "That's about how many students could
find us down here anyway, so it would work out well."

pondering how to pay the "exorbitant" fine.

ever the circumstances, the safest course of
action for students is to leave campus plants
alone. "We understand that students are
tempted to capture a little bit of the floral
beauty they see around them and save it for
their own enjoyment. However, we need to
make it clear that destroying a flower by
picking it is a very selfish and unacceptable
action. This institution is first and foremost
a place for a diversity of plants to grow and
flourish, benefiting the community."
According to Rose, he was indeed aware
that the college was an officially designated
arboretum before he picked the daffodils. "I
remember reading about that in the admissions literature. It impressed me then. It's
such a pleasant-sounding word. Also, the concept of having labeled trees seemed to convey
a sense of order and stability that I appreciated. But now I know that in practice, living
in an arboretum is very problematic."
Rose does not anticipate returning to

Director of the Scott Arboretum Claire

One of the pot garden's biggest supporters is Director of Psychological Services David Ramirez, who said it woul

stress. "I'm all for aiding students in getting wreaked," he said, "Lord knows they

need a way to calm down," he said.
The arboretum will most likely plant

the cannabis in a fenced-off area of the
amphitheater.
"Everybody takes bong hits in the amphitheater anyway," noted campus pothead

Patrick McGarrah 'O4. "It's about time the
college acknowledges our needs and harvests the raw materials right on the spot."
Earthlust president Sydney Beveridge
'O2 also expressed support. "It fits right

in with our efficiency campaign," she
said. "So much fuel is wasted in transporting bud from someone's basement
to the dealer to the smoker. It's more
environmentally conscious for stoners
to get it right from the source."
Liz Wright 'O4 expressed excitement
about the culinary possibilities oftheweed
garden. "Now that I don't have to trek all
the way home to get some pot at a halfway
decent price, I'm definitely going to host a
hash cookie baking party," she said.
As for naming the new garden, the
arboretum has sent a reserved-students
e-mail asking the student body for ideas.
"We've received some great suggestions
so far," Sawyer said. "Hash Patch, Garden

are some top contenders at this point."

Classics department 'hoax,' chair reveals
BY IVAN BOOTH E
Peter Rosenthal, the chairperson of the classics department, revealed yesterday that the department was, in fact,
just a big hoax. The five students who major in the department were discovered to be a collection of fictitious names.
"It's really funny that you people didn't notice it,"
Rosenthal said. "I mean, come on! Marcus Aurelius? Did
you really think that was a student at Swarthmore?"
While courses in theclassics at Swarthmore have, in fact,
been offered from time to time, a major in the department
has not actually been possible for about 15 years.
"I remember about eight years ago someone wrote a
sophomore paper saying she was going to major in the classics," Rosenthal said with a chuckle. "The professors took

up a collection and paid her about $2OO to reconsider," he said.
"Nobody really wanted to put all that time into it, advising her,
and getting outside evaluators for the senior thesis. It really
was way too much work."
The revelation struck a chord with some students, particularly
in Student Council. A student who went only by the name
"Spartacus" was listed as the council's director of fireside chats.
"I mean, yeah, we all wondered why he only had one name,"
council co-president Colin Moore 'O2 said. "And sure, he hadn't
come to any meetings, but really," he said with a wry grin, "that
didn't prove much."

Rosenthal predicted that other than a special election for
the student council member, it would have little effect on the
campus. "Seriously, who cares?" he said. "It's just a bunch of
dead guys."

Dean Bob Gross, Dean Tedd Goundie, Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave, Vice President for Facilities Larry Schallj and Director ofFacilities Stuart

Student Council co-president Anna Woodiwiss 'O2 said

problem, but students will have more options. It will

Provost Jennie Keith, Dean Bob Gross and Acting Admissions Director Jim Bock presented specific plans to aid athletes Tuesday.

Future plans for athletics,
diversity issues discussed
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
On Tuesday, approximately 30 students gathered for a
fireside chat in Kohlberg Coffee Bar with Provost Jennie
Keith, Dean of the College Bob Gross, and Acting Admissions Director Jim Bock. Student Council organized the

meeting to discuss athletics and diversity at Swarthmore.
Keith detailed to the students a list of proposed Ath-

letic Review Committee initiatives, including reducing the
number of scheduling conflicts
that often keep athletes from academic and other pursuits; the addition of lighted and synthetic
fields; improved drainage on
playing fields; and other items
on coaches' and teams' "wish
lists."
She also said the college may
hire an associate athletic director
who would be responsible for intercollegiate athletics, recruitment and serving as a liaison with the Admissions Office.
The provost further introduced an ARC plan to bridge
the gap between athletes and non-athletes by holding interactive workshops, hosted by people with areas of expertise that connect athletics and other student interests. Keith
said some possible topics include nutrition, computer-generated motion, and the psychology of performance.
What appeared to be the major question for most students in attendance, however, was not how to improve the
Swarthmore athlete's time on the playing field but rather
how to better the image of the Swarthmore athlete in the
eyes of non-athletes.

the plans brought up aren't about how to support the athlete
ideologically, and something needs to be done to change the
view of athletes on campus."
One of the main areas students saw as a way to tackle this
goal is in admissions. Though Bock pointed out that about 40
percent of the Swarthmore community played a varsity sport
in high school and were thus aware of the time and dedication required, some students said they felt that many nonathletic members of the students and faculty discriminated
against athletes and could not
comprehend that a love for ath-

on the same level as a
love for music or drama.
Three-sport athlete Katie Tarr
'O2 commented, "Athletics is something you have a passion about,
just like a love for music, a love
for dance or a love for chem lab."
Students further commented
that both athletes and non-athletes seem to believe that recruited athletes are admitted solely
for athletic ability and not other talents and academic prowess. However, both Bock and Keith emphasized that this is

ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH
FOUR YEARS HERE WITHOUT
BEING CHALLENGED, AND
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM."

Many students said they felt the college's attempts to

Mold open-minded and all-embracing individuals neglected
to emphasize that the same level of understanding should
extend to athletes as well.
"Students who don't 'get' student-athletes are allowed

to go through four years here without being challenged,
and that's a big problem," Darren Wood 'Ol said. "A lot of

not the case.
"Some people at Swarthmore talk about athletes like that's
all you are," Keith said. "No one at Swarthmore is just one thing."
Bock added that only people who can do the work are admitted to Swarthmore and that "the only mistakes we make
here are with the people we don't accept."
As possible solutions, students proposed further emphasis
from admissions that no one is admitted solely on athletic ability. They also suggested sending out reserved-students e-mails
advertising athletic events and including mention of academic
and extracurricular achievements in athletic profiles printed
in college publications.
In his closing remarks moderator Jordan Brackett 'Ol
summed up the chat. "We can do things like putting up e-mails
and posters, but it's an ideological thing," he said. "It's about
viewing members of our community with respect and viewing what they bring to the community with respect."

Woodiwiss said she was also happy that the college
was able to take action so quickly after the widespread
expression of student concerns about safety over the
past month. Requests for more lighting and call boxes
were made repeatedly at a fireside chat held after an
attempted rape and a string of vandalisms over the last
weekend in February.
"A lot of the stuff they are doing was on our wish
list," she said. "It was great to have the administrations
come to us and say 'This is what we are doing' so

quickly."
Woodiwiss said that in the meeting, the administrators emphasized that these actions are both a direct response to student concerns and part of an ongoing development and improvement of safety.

Call boxes will be installed outside of Sharpies, on
the back of Beardsley and on the side of the facilities
buildings near the athletics tunnel.
It is also possible that more call boxes will be put on
the sides of signs that will direct visitors around campus, which will be built this summer.
Woodiwiss said it would be feasible for these call
boxes to be installed by next year.
A call box cannot be placed in the tunnel near the
train station because the tunnel is SEPTA property. The
college is, however, negotiating with SEPTA about installing mirrors in the tunnel.
Lighting repairs are currently being made, and members of the council's committee on safety will walk
around campus with Redgrave at night to determine
locations that most need extra lighting.
The college also intends to hire professional shuttle
drivers, which would allow the vans to run later than 2
a.m. A revamping of the Garnet Patrol, which would
include combining or replacing it with a professional
patrol, is planned as well. Both these measures will be
given a trial period next year.

Not all departments will
offer course minors
The political science, economics, sociology and anthropology, comparative literature and studio art majors have decided not to offer course minors outside the
honors program said Craig Williamsom, chairperson of
the Curriculum Committee. All other departments have
submitted proposals to the committee already.
Concrete decisions about timing and implementation
of course minors will be made at the faculty meeting
scheduled for tomorrow.

STUDENT

Rising sophomores
concerned about
limited coed options
BY JON EHRENFELD

Before spring break, the deans of the college approved a proposal to allow coed rooming in the
Lodges and the I and J sections of Worth. Despite
the deans' approval, some freshmen are questioning how available coed housing actually be for them
next year.
Each lodge contains a double and triple. Two
years ago, both men and women could live in a lodge,
as long as they did not live in the same room. Starting next year, men and women may share rooms in
the lodges, and Worth has some two-room doubles
that will be open to coed housing.

"THERE ARE GOING TO BE
TOO MANY SOPHOMORES
WHO WANT COED HOUSING."
-ALEX BRENNAN
With the selection of rooms already minimal,
there are freshmen who do not think they will be
able to live in a coed room this coming fall.
Matthew Miller 'O4 is one of them.When he heard
about the coed housing resolution that passed, he and
some of his female friends decided to live together
next year.

But after looking at the available rooms and talking to Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal he is
unsure of his chances of living in a coed room next
year.

Miller is not interested in living in a lodge, where
five people would live in very close quarters. And
Worth's singles and two-room doubles are almost
always taken by juniors and seniors.
For sophomores, Worth is rarely a realistic housing option. "You pretty much can't" get a room in
Worth, he said.
Despite the deans' approval oflimited coed rooming
this option
a first in the college's history
is not likely to be available to all lottery participants.

"I'm a little worried that there are going to be too
many sophomores who want coed housing and that I
won't be able to get a room," said Alex Brennan 'O4,
who-will be blocking for a lodge. He said he thinks
the demand among sophomores for coed housing will
be high.

Brennan said that it would be easier for sophomores to live with opposite-sex roommates if Roberts or Palmer also had coed housing. These dorms
were included in the original proposal made by Housing Committee.
"Most people, I think, are doing it because they
would feel more comfortable," Miller said. As Miller
sees it, most people who want coed housing choose it
for valid reasons.
The issue of comfort was the stated purpose of
the original housing proposal. The Housing Committee felt that if a student would be more at ease rooming with someone of the opposite sex, that option
should be available. Many students asserted thatthe
current single-sex rules were heterosexist.
Because of this, Miller and others feel that students who want coed housing should receive, if not a
guarantee, at least some priority in the housing lottery. As it stands now, they do not.
This particular problem is one that will likely affect only this year's rising sophomores, since
Westphal has indicated the possibility of more rooms
being added to the coed list in the future.
As this is the first year in which coed housing
has existed, and the Housing Office was unsure what
the student demand would be, the coming year will
be a trial run of sorts.
The future of coed housing may well depend on
its demand this spring and the success of the program next year.

Diversity celebration continues
Poet Eileen Myles read from her book "Cool For You" yesterday evening as a part of the college's first diversity week. A
wide variety of events, including last Saturday's Sager Symposium and a keynote address by Dean Bob Gross Sunday,
began the week. Campus groups sponsored events, such as the discussion on ethnic clumping held by SAO and DU and

the Student Council fireside chat on athletics and diversity Tuesday. Events continue today with a talk by Dr. Nancy
Hornberger on language policy in the Scheuer Room at 7:30 p.m. Tomorrow evening, Shabbat services will be held in Bond
at 5:30 p.m. A diversity week party will occur in Paces at 10 p.m. Friday. The Intercultural Center has been the primary
organizer of the week's events, which are meant to be accessible to all students and to reflect diversity in gender, religion,
ethnicity, ideology, sexual orientation and economic situation.

Legislature may mandate sprinklers in dorms
Fire Sprinkler Act may force Swarthmore to install system in dorms within five years
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

Within the next five years,
Swarthmore College could be required
to add sprinkler systems to all of its dor-

mitories.
The Fire Sprinkler Act, currently
under consideration by the Pennsylva-

nia legislature,
would require in-

stallation of fire

sprinklers in all
dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses of colleges in Pennsylvania within five
years of the law's

enactment.

"We don't have

presence of these fire suppression systems reduces the chances of death in
case of a fire by 50 to 75 percent.

NFPA has no record of a fire killing
more than two people in a building
where fire sprinklers have been completely installed.

articles for tragedies not only in this
commonwealth but nationwide," said
Representative Michael McGeehan (DPhiladelphia), who introduced the bill in

the House.
McGeehan cited the Bloomsburg fraternity house fire of 1994, which killed
five people, and the Seton Hall fire of
2000, in which three students were killed
and 62 people were injured, as two of the
tragedies that couldhave been prevented
by a sprinkler system.
Fire sprinklers work by extinguishing fires while they are still relatively
small. The National Fire Protection
Association's 1997 report states that the

lion in low-interest
loans are made
available to colleges to borrow for
installation of
sprinkler systems.
An alternate
proposal by Governor Tom Ridge

would make $350
million available to
colleges in $7O million shares over

five years.

However, the governor's initiative includes only fire sprinkler systems in dormitories, not in fraternity and sorority
houses. It also does not mandate the installation of these systems.
Despite this counterproposal,
McGeehan expressed confidence in the
passing of the Fire Sprinkler Act.
Larry Schall, the college's vice president for facilities and services, has not
expressed the same level of confidence.
"The detailsof what final bill gets passed
are still not clear," he said. "I think there
was a rush to pass something without
thinking through some very complex

issues, but hopefully the final bill will
deal with many of these."
The college already has a plan for installation offire sprinklers according to
Schall. "We should be done with all
dorms by 2007," he said.
Wharton already has a fire sprinkler
system installed, and placement of sprinklers in Mertz and PPR is planned for
this summer.
Parrish will be completed last, because its size and structure will require
the work to be done in three different
stages.
While the installation of fire sprinklers in Parrish will not fit the time
schedule mandated by this act, the college is hoping it will be considered a spe-

cial case.

"My understanding is that there
will be a process for extensions, and
this might fit under that. We won't
know until the bill is done," Schall

said.
A similar federal bill proposes that
$lOO million be made available annually
for the installation and maintenance of
fire sprinklers in college dormitories
and residential fraternities and sorori-

ties.

It was introduced in the U.S. Senate
on Feb. 27 by Senators John Edwards
(D-NC) and Christopher Dodd (D-

Conn.).

The bill is currently under consid-

eration in the Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-

sions.

Conference advises would-be entreperneurs
Swarthmore will host the second annual
Lax Conference in Entrepreneurship this
Sunday. Vortex Communications Partner
Mark Benerofe will deliver the keynote address, which will focus on how to couple a
liberal arts education with entrepreneurship.

Benerofe will also give advice on entrepreneurial dos and don'ts and the use of the
Internet in the business world. In an interview, he discussed how today's companies
should use the Internet.
Role of the Internet
Because of the Internet, businesses are being "transformed in possibly the most fundamental way since the Industrial Revolution,"

Benerofe said. The Internet's greatest contribution to business is
"the way it [the
Internet] transforms
sales, production, and

distribution," he explained.
"If you're an entrepreneur, you have to
look at your business

and ask what do the

nologies, and distribution technologies

and the Internet is just one component of
that do to transform your particular business or industry," Benerofe said.

The Internet, he elaborated, drastically
changes the way that companies with products that can be bit-streamed operate. This
is true of the music industry, where the product itself is transformed into bits at every
step production, storage and distribution.
Other businesses that are relatively unaffected by the changes in digital technology
will probably not be affected by the Internet
too quickly, he said. There is a whole sub-set
of companies, however, that have products
that cannot be bit-streamed but that can use

the benefits of the Internet to improve the

way they operate.
Benerofe has experience in many areas

of business. He has served as executive
vice president for Priceline.com, chief marketing officer for Walker Digital, senior
vice president for entertainment programming and systems development for Sony
Online, director of interactive media for
Microsoft, general manager and editorial
director for Prodigy, and executive producer of CNN.
A company can use the Internet in one of
two ways, Benerofe believes. First, a business to business (B2B) company that relies
on middlemen to get a product to the consumer can use the Internet as a way to bring

Marketing versus retailing
He noted that Dell, one of the nation's
leading computer manufacturers, has used
the Internet and other technological advances to drastically reduce fixed costs in
the company. Dell assembles computers by
request, rather than assembling computers
and stockpiling them in warehouses to sell
to consumers. By using this method, Dell
has been able to drastically reduce overhead. Although not the only factor, the
Internet has been one of the key technologies responsible for Dell's success.
However, Benerofe cautioned that using

directly to consumers does not benefit ev-

ing to distinguish

from others on

the market.
"One of the
biggest problems
facing these types
of firms is channel
conflict,"
Benerofe said.

Channel conflict
occurs when a firm risks losing major marketing venues due to increased push toward
Internet (or other) sales, he said.
A retail company such as Adidas, for example, relies on retail stores' advertisements in windows, store-sponsorednewspaper ads, and store employees to differentiate its shoe from the competitors. Adidas
and companies like it would risk losing
major advertising and sales support should
they try to consolidate sales on the Internet
and cut out the middle man
in this case,
the retail store.
"The retail store will say to Adidas 'lf you
try to cut me out, I will get back at you by
taking down your company's signs from the
windows or instructing my salespeople to
promote your competitors on the floor,'
Benerofe said.
"A site like adidas.com should be used

"

as a mode of marketing and promotion,"
Benerofe said, "or as a way to improve customer relations and customer service." He
said that, if such a site extends its features
to meet goals far beyond these categories,
the company may risk losing money. It could
also lose key partnerships in its attempt to
increase its presence on the World Wide Web
simply to be there or to be "hip."
The second type of Internet use can be
seen in a company such as amazon.com,
where the company is using the Internet as

a massive distribution channel and focuses
on warehousing, distribution and service as
the key benefits it can provide via the
Internet. These companies can be labeled as
business to consumer (B2C) companies.
Cracking open an industry
Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, first
sought to attack the book industry, as opposed to some other industry in the entertainment field, for three reasons. First, he
wanted a category of merchandise with broad
mass consumer appeal. Second, he needed a
product that could be sampled online. Books
and music, unlike food products or makeup,
can be read or listened to online, providing
consumers with a way to sample the product. Third, it was necessary to have a market in which he could convince suppliers to
support this new distribution channel.
This is where books won out over music. While the music industry is dominated
by three large firms, no book publisher controlled more than 12 percent of the market.
Thus, the book industry was free from the
control of a monopoly or oligopoly, and
Bezos knew he could get his product from
publishers and deliver it to consumers without restrictions.
Bezos set out to create a new method of
high-tech distribution, using the Internet as
a primary facilitator. But when amazon.com
expanded its focus to include other music and
movies in addition to books, it did not achieve
the same success it had enjoyed when focusing primarily on books, Benerofe said.
He attributed this lack of success to the
fact that the music and movie industries are
both oligopolies, dominated by a few large
firms, who can use their power to influence

amazon.com.

Police report no
new leads in crimes
BY HOFAN CHAU
The Swarthmore Borough Police Department said there have been no new developments in the case of an attempted rape that
occurred near Sharpies four weeks ago, citing the status of the case as an "ongoing investigation." There have been no new witnesses to give any conclusive information
that could lead to an arrest.
Similarly, there are still no leads in the

vandalism of several college and studentowned vehicles that occurred the same
weekend as the attempted rape.
In general, cases not solved after 24
hours have a decreasing likelihood of being solved at all, Director ofPublic Safety
Owen Redgrave said.
"At this point, I'm not aware of any witnesses coming forth, and I'm not aware of
[this] getting better over time," he said,
"However, it's still certainly possible."

Despite amazon.com's lack of success in
many of these entertainment categories and
its often publicized lack of profit, Benerofe
said the company has initiated drastic
changes in the way businesses distribute

their products.
Seeking to survive
Amazon's survival as an Internet retailer
will depend on the answers to two important questions, Benerofe said.
"The questions thatremain are first, can
it extend that success beyond the books catwill consumers think of the Amaegory
zon brand as a bookstore or an online 'Wal
Mart?' And second
can Amazon survive
without either a manufacturing component
or a bricks-and-mortar retail partner?"
The application of Benerofe's advice in
a practical situation can be seen in alumna
...

Susanna Levin's company, Lucy. Levin, a
panelist at the 2001 Lax Conference, dis-

cussed how the Internet has influenced the
development of her company, a women's
workout clothing store that offers both a

distinct Lucy line and famous-name brands

like Adidas and Puma.
Levin explained that in the last year she
and her collaborators raised $4O million to
start Lucy. The plan was to establish Lucy
as both an online retailer and a chain of
brick and mortar stores, and Lucy began
selling from their website at Lucy.com.
However, in late 2000 and early 2001 investors abruptly turned away from investment,
and Lucy found itself in a precarious situation.
"We had two choices, either we could
run out of money, or narrow our focus to
one of the two channels," she said. "We
chose brick-and-mortar because the
Internet channel would take both more in-

vestment and more time in order to begin
to turn a profit." Thus, Lucy opened a retail store at Crunch Gym in New York City
and ceased selling from their Web site.
Levin did say that she hoped Lucy.com
would be up and running as a retail
Internet site sometime next year.
According to Levin, "Anytime you get a
new technology it creates business oppor...

tunities," she said. "The Internet is also a
powerful way to create a network with other
people."

Levin cautioned, however, that though
the Internet provides seemingly infinite possibilities, at the present time the possible
onset of a recession has left investors cautious. "Good entrepreneurs have no shortage [of] good ideas," Levin explained, "what
they have is a shortage [of] cash."
Levin said that young entrepreneurs
shouldn't be completely scared away
though, as there is still the opportunity for
those with new and innovative ideas to succeed in Internet businesses.
This Sunday's events will include a keynote address by Benerofe, panel discussions
on attending alumni's entrepreneurial adventures and how a Swarthmore education
can fit into a career in business.
Both Benerofe and Levin commented
that Swarthmore students are often quick
to dismiss business as a "non-academic"
pursuit, but hoped that students would take
advantage of this opportunity as a way to
learn about the business world.
"When I was at Swarthmore, I didn't
think a lot about business," Levin reminisced, "if people come to the Lax Conference they will be surprised at how relevant
and interesting the business world is."

On-line COPHE survey
attempts to evaluate
student experiences
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
All students received a general survey about the
college in their e-mail boxes last Wednesday afternoon. The questionnaire, designed by the Consortium
for Financing Higher Education (COFHE), deals with
issues ranging from facilities concerns to topics of
conversation within the student body
COFHE standardizes most ofthe "College Student
Experiences Questionnaire" to enable the compari-

son of results with other institutions. The final questions pertained only to Swarthmore.
Dean of the College Bob Gross referred to COFHE,
a group of about 30 colleges and universities, as
"Swarthmore's primary reference group" for mak-

ing comparisons. Most large universities question
only a sample of their student body, but Director of
Institutional Research Robin Shores said that "we
felt that with our size it was feasible, and preferable,
to include everyone."
The survey asked students to assess their college
experience in terms of relationships with the community, use of facilities, and skills gained in class or
activity involvement. Others were highly personal,
such as, "Have you ever asked a friend to tell you
what he or she thinks of you?"
Students received the surveys via e-mail as op-

posed to campus mail. The deans saw this as "an
added convenience for students," Gross said.
"The response rate at Swarthmore for similar surveys has typically been among the highest of the
COFHE schools," he explained, adding that he hopes
that continues to be the case.
The results of the survey have not yet been tallied. After they are completed, COFHE processes
them, then returns the data to the college. Shores is
in charge of preparing a report "that highlights sig-

nificant findings," Gross said.
Shores said that "while I will not receive data back
from the vendor before the end of the semester, I
would certainly hope to share some of the results

Swarthmore only, no comparisons with the community in the fall."
Gross characterized the COFHE surveys as "very
useful in pointing to areas of concern or, conversely,
reassuring us that we are doing better than [our]
peers." Although the COFHE data has not been used
very extensively in a few years, he believes it provides "more texture about the student experience"
than other methods of assessment for example, the
senior survey
and that "the feedback from students
will be quite useful to faculty and administration."

SMART selects first student members
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Sexual Misconduct Advisors and Resource
Team (SMART) has selected its first student members, who will receive sixteen total hours of training on campus this weekend.
The purpose of SMART is to help individuals
who have been victims of sexual assault or sexual
misconduct.
Seven students were selected to be sexual misconduct counselors out of 13 applicants. Many of
them were freshmen, said Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol,
who along with Siobhan Carty 'Ol first spoke to

Dean and Gender Education Advisor Karen Henry
about including students in SMART.
Those accepted to be trained were Deanna Wilson 'O4, Lauren Appel 'O4, Mara Gustafson 'O3, Yen
Pham 'O3, Aisha Baruni 'O2, Jeanne Gardner 'O2,
Caroline Celano 'O4 and Katia Bobonis 'O4.
Two of the accepted students will also run the
survivor support group, Howes-Mischel said. For
these positions, an applicant's status as a rape or
assault victim was given special consideration, although applications for SMART did not receive

preference toward victims.
Instead, Howes-Mischel, Carty and Henry
looked for students with experience in helping

another person in crisis, such as a depressive

none did.
Women Organized against Rape (WOAR), a Philadelphia group that providessexual assault counseling and community education, will run the training
session, addressing topics such as date and acquaintance rape, child sexual abuse, the role of drugs in
sexual assault, crisis intervention and ethics.
The five-year-old team has previously comprised only faculty and staff. Students were asked
to apply to be sexual misconduct counselors in an
attempt to make SMART more accesible to students,

and make its resources more widely used.
The SMART team came into existence in 1995
when public safety and Worth Health Center trained
a group ofeight faculty to support students who have
experienced sexual misconduct.

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

Show, not tell
It was a refreshing change to see members of the
Athletic Review Committee speaking openly about the
recent activities of the committee at Tuesday's fireside
chat. Unfortunately, the fresh air was ruined by the
now-stale rhetoric coming from administrators.
After more than three months of promises,
reassurances and equivocation, it's time for administrators to stop coddling the community with touchyfeely fireside chats and produce results.
By now, everyone accepts that, yes, Jennie Keith,
you do want students to be involved in the decisionmaking process. And it's true, Jim Bock, that no one
here is an admissions mistake. It's become sufficiently clear, Bob Williams, that athletics has the
support of the administration.
Now is the time to show students that these words
have some substance behind them. If the administration genuinely wants to change the community's
perception of student-athletes, it will have to start
making concrete proposals for improvements that
show it is not treating athletics as a second-class
pursuit. Adding an athlete's academic achievements to
her profile in The Phoenix or the alumni magazine is a
token gesture. Building dugouts for the baseball team
and erecting a scoreboard for the softball team is not.
Rather than telling students how they really hope
students get involved, administrators need to show
students the efforts they have made to involve
students in the process. That involves more than
simply letting students serve on the ARC. Administrators need to show students that they are opening
communication channels between those who play
sports and those who make decisions that impact the
players.
Making and following through on concrete
proposals designed to improve the athletic experience
of Swarthmore students is the only way to legitimize
athletics at Swarthmore. We grow weary of sophistry
and soothsaying. Administrators, show us that your
words mean something.

An improving SC
We here at The Phoenix are impressed with
Student Council this semester. We have not written
one story about a resignation, a fiasco or an unnecessary referendum. This may sound disparaging, but in
truth, the council has come a long way since last year.
The new SC has become more diverse and therefore
more representative of this campus, a necessary
element of being responsive and credible. And though
it isn't all of those things yet, for the first time in a
number of years Student Council as an institution
seems to be more than the sum ofits members. The
council represents wide variety of viewpoints, leading
to overly long meetings and disagreements, but they
have been able to work as a cohesive unit. This
semester's council members campaigned on issues, and
the council, for the most part, is now visibly trying to
address them, not as individuals, but as a council. They
are also making a collective effort to be receptive to
issues students care about, and have met with some
success, as evidenced by a concerted and effective
effort to improve campus safety (see story on pg. 5).
Some of this progress is clearly due to the new
constitution. Procedures were streamlined and
(hopefully) made more transparent. More importantly, the new council positions are created to
emphasize accountability for things Student Council
should be responsible for.
Of course, this young council has yet to be really
tested. But in the meantime, their next step is to
become proactive, rather thanreactive. It's wonderful
that SC is finally responding to the needs that
students have expressed. Now, it should also be
Putting forth new ideas and proposals independent of
responding to pressing student problems. Keep up the
good work, SC. For the first time, we are all paying
attention.

'I HAVE AL BLOOM'
Dear Editor:
I am Neil Austrian, former President of the National Football League. I have Al Bloom. And if the Board of Managers
does not reinstate the football team by 0700 Tuesday morning, you will never see your precious dictator again.
Right now, I can smell Al Bloom. In fact, I can almost
taste him. His nose, that is, which I have cut up and stirfried in pigskin. Mmmmmm. Did I mention that I was the
President of the National Football League?
I tried to kidnap Al Bloom's wife as well, but, alas, she
would not fit in the small tank I had prepared for Al Bloom.
That is fine, though, because now I have Al Bloom, just as
you have my soul, my joie de vivre, my football.

Every night, after Al Bloom has gone to sleep, I sit quietly by the 4'x4' cage in which I keep him tied up. Sometimes, when I am not looking, my henchman Noyes throws
footballs at Al Bloom and guffaws. As I sit there, contemplating Al Bloom's corpulent figure, I ask myself, why?
So let's make a deal. You need Al Bloom, and I need football. I tire of these "fireside" chats. Convene the board of
managers, buy JennieKeith a new jacket, and let's get this

show on the road.
Otherwise, you can kiss Al Bloom goodbye. Did I mention that I was the President of the National Football League?

INHERIT
THE WIND

My campuswide appeal
I must confess that sometimes I wish this were a
column with more of an avowed theme a political
tract, for instance. In any given week, someone in a
position of relative authority screws up something.
Despite the precipitous decline in wacky national
hijinks of a carnal variety with the departure of our
former president, the U.S. military can usually be
counted upon to destroy something they shouldn't

have.

I wonder if it's something in the national temperament or that we follow the news of other countries
less thoroughly, but you never hear of the British or
French (well, the latter for obvious reasons) militaries bombing foreign embassies or sinking renegade
fishing trawlers, whereas we produce civilian casualties every week and usually in quite ingenious fashion.
Sadly, this column is not about EA-6's taking out
gondola lines. It's not really about anything, per se,
and with a mere three or so installments remaining,
it really should, to return to a much-maligned employment of English I once used, have a big finish.
Should I, in the autumn of my years, now offer
apologetics for my misanthropic stance toward all

ARE WE ANIMALS?!

REAL PLATES.
things in the 19081 ZIP code? I think not.
Those of you who are seniors, I urge you to consider of what portion of the daily goings-on of the
college you genuinely approve and to direct your future donations accordingly. Even Austrian didn't get
what he wanted, and he has the only jersey retired
by the now-defunct Swarthmore football team. Even
my new favorite place to eat in town, the Country
Market, despite being blessed with lovely blonde
cashiers, is doomed, in my opinion, by its failure to
use non-disposable flatware. Are we animals? Even
the French use real plates.
Or a confession, perhaps? My long-lost loves and
hates of Swarthmore. My revenge against a tyrannical administration and faculty: sic semper tyrannis.
Again, I decline. As for the former, they are both too
ephemeral and cloistered for public consumption.
The latter might be a little more germane, especially
given my lack of firm plans for the fall; however, one
should wait for the bridge to be completely crossed
before setting it afire. After all, "you do not know
what tomorrow will bring."
What options remain? What would you, my loyalcum-delusional readers, like to hear with now two
installments at your disposal? Does there remain
some general faux pas of Swarthmore unexposed?
The title of this column, "Inherit the Wind," comes
from Proverbs 11:29: "He that troubleth his own
house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be
servant to the wise of heart." I think even my basest critics will admit I have fulfilled that prophesy

admirably.

This, then, is an appeal to my readers. My talents
are at your disposal but for a brief time. What advice, what rant, what madness, what sadness, what
hostility, what peace, what nicety, what warning
must be preserved on these sacred pages?
Be prompt. In another few weeks, I'll be sitting
under the tree below McCabe, reading old books and
wondering how long the early spring can last.

THE PHOENIX

Article contained factual errors
Dear Editor:
David Ellis's article "Allow local
schools to teach virtue" contains an extraordinary amount of misinformation
and a large number of factual errors regarding the historical and legal basisfor
the separation of church and state.
First of all, while he states correctly
that the Establishment Clause of the
First Amendment only applied to the federal government originally, he goes on
to say that writers of the Constitution
were deeply religious men who wanted
the state governments "to continue their
religious practices without federal interference." He cites as proof of the founding fathers' piety the fact that they appointed a chaplain for the constitutional
convention. This is false. Several weeks
into the convention Benjamin Franklin
suggested that a clergyman be brought
in to offer daily prayers for their deliberations.
The "starkly religious crowd" did not
even bother to vote on his motion and the
convention never had a clergyman. The
Constitution they produced contained not
a single reference to God, and in fact, in

Article VI, stated that "no religious test
shall ever be required as a Qualification
to any Office or public Trust under the
United States." Furthermore, James
Madison, the "Father of the Constitution," was an ardent opponent of any government endorsement of religion and
wrote extensively on the subject in his
"Memorial and Remonstrance."
Ellis continues his aberration of the
truth by claiming that it was the Supreme Court under Earl Warren which
first used the Fourteenth Amendment to
apply the Establishment Clause of the
First to the states. This is completely incorrect. The Warren Court, "an
unelected temporal anomaly that abrogated power from the national legislature," to quote Ellis, used the Fourteenth
Amendment to do what the states had
been unwilling to do end segregation.
The Supreme Court actually ruled
much earlier, in Gitlow v. New York in
1925, that the basic liberties of speech,
assembly, press, and religion were protected from state abridgement by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The court first
invoked this in a religion case in

myself and my family only and not the

that they are outsiders, not fullmembers
of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that
they are insiders, favored members of
the political community" (concurring

that no matter how you while away the time on its clock, you
are one day doomed to give in to it.
Behind it all there is the guilt. What the hell is your problem? How dare you indulge yourself like this? After all the
opportunities you've had, the effort and emotion people have
given to you, you're letting your chances go to waste. Why do
you keep doing this? You're hopeless,
that's why. You're ungrateful, and
you're worthless. And the cycle starts
all over again.
The guilt factor, I believe, is inordinately powerful at a place like this.
We are all here to perform, to excel, to

came to college, and to which we have
been held since our arrival. If we can't,

we work so hard through our childhood and adolescent years, if not to
soar in this final leap to adulthood?
To falter mid-air is to shame a lifetime
of training. We choked. We couldn't
handle the pressure. We don't have
what it takes. We blame ourselves.
This is why Tipper's story is different from mine, from that
of many people I know. She can put the blame and the cure in
the hands of others. Something made her sick; she took a pill
and got better. But some of us can't remember being infected
and can't remember a time when we haven't shown the symptoms. Some of us aren't entirely certain that we trust simple
regulation of our seratonin levels to take away the harmful
thought patterns we must recognize as contributing factors.
For some of us, it is, simply, a lot more complicated.
I'm not convinced that either a chemically-balanced brain
or a therapy-revised mind is the solution. I suspect that the
things I do mentally and the things my body does physiologically have far more of an interactive influence on one another
than the raging battle between medication-mongers and traditional therapists sometimes suggests. All I can be sure of,
though, is that I'll have to continue to walk the fine line between self-forgiveness and self-indulgence, between discipline
and punishment. I have to take care of myself, take responsibility for myself, and do the best I can to make sure those two
goals don't step on each other's toes. That's the most important and the toughest lesson: how to stop blaming and start

The situation, blame and all, becomes much more complicated when that thing has been "happening" for years.
In biomechanics, there is a concept known as the Reynolds
number that describes, among other things, the viscosity of
the fluid (air, water, whatever) surrounding an object.
Reynolds calculations demonstrate that what may seem to be
the same environmental conditions can provide very different experiences to beings of varying sizes. You may feel you're
swimming effortlessly in a pool, but the bacteria on the surface of your skin are struggling through Silly Putty.
Now translate that idea into mental rather than physical
terms. It's the best way I can think of to explain what a depressive episode is for me. What I can't convey at all is the
horrible sense of familiarity, the "here-we-go-again" that
comes with it. The knowledge that you can't escape it is more
frightening than the experience itself.
There are times when picking up the phone or mailing an
envelope are too much to ask of yourself. It's those occasions,
when the responsibilities of daily life are beyond your capacity, that show you why depression is called a mental illness.

Hotel parked in the wrong spot
BY RANDY KEIM
The other day I was thinking to myself, "Self, wouldn't
it be great if there were a bar or restaurant in town where
students could go, drink and enjoy the perks of a typical
college town?" Then I remembered that we are in
Swarthmore, a dry Quaker town that wouldrather build
a barn in the ville than a bar.
But wait! We might build an on-campus hotel with a
bar! Beer! Wine! Rum and coke! Ah, what a great idea.
Well, hold your liver for a second, this hotel may not
be as great as it sounds. First of all, I am a little upset
about how little we all know about this proposed hotel.
It seems that the college is waiting to tell us how the
hotel will affect the students until it gets the liquor li-

cense from the borough. This seems kind of sketchy, especially with the recent questioning of how our administration handles decision-making. My main concern
with this hotel is not so much with the idea, as it could
be beneficial to the college, but with how it will affect
one of the things that I hate most about Swarthmore,
parking.
That's right, parking, the fun aspect of Swarthmore
that pushes public safety to hand out more tickets than
Clinton did pardons. Even without the hotel, public
safety, armed with boots, tickets and little care for the
plea of an unsuspecting parking victim, rolls around and
catches people daily. Worse than this is the amount of

people who are denied parking permits on campus every semester. Ultimately, we do not have enough parking spaces at this time, so a hotel located in the busy
area near the south gate could only cause more traffic
and more confusion about where one could park. The
school claims that a two-story parking complex will be
built with the hotel. But do you really think it will be
open for student parking? If you do, then you might have
already had too many beers and could do without a bar

on campus.
Also interesting is the location of the proposed hotel, which is on top of the old football practice field. Coincidental? I don't think so. I find it irritating that the
school proposed the hotel so quickly after freeing up that
piece of land. A poor way of showing that they haven't
been considering the perks of a football-less Swarthmore
for a while.
I guess now we just wait to see if the borough will
allow a liquor license on campus. Some may think that
the town won't like it, but you never know, some of the
older people want to be allowed to have a glass of wine
with dinner and the ville rats are growing older and
may want to drink some beer when they are crawling
through town. If it does get passed, don't just sit back
and let the administration begin construction so soon
without us knowing more about it. Until then, be careful where you park and take advantage of our own liquor license, the party permit.

'The soft bigotry of
low expectations'
Is the President stupid?
I love living in a country where we can argue
about this. I hate living in a country where the answer might be yes.
Most people feel more secure knowing that Dick
Cheney is there, reading Bush his mail and averting national disaster. Of course, Dubya finally took
a stand on Gridiron Spoof Night Saturday and denied that Cheney is really the one in charge.
"To those people, I say..." His voice trailed off and
he turned to the vice president. "What do I say,

Dick?"
Thanks to Cheney's recent health problems, it
appears that Bush is only a heartbeat away from the
presidency. Sure, there are half a dozen old white
guys with stock options that can fill in as super-chiefof-staff. But are we really talking about a puppet
presidency here? And is George W. Bush really so
dumb?

BUSH'S EDUCATION CATCHPHRASE HAS BEEN TURNED BACK
ON THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF.
Some say no, with a twist. As Slate Magazine has
pointed out, a Washington Post columnist has called
for a moratorium on the Bush-is-a-dummy line, and

a New York Times columnist has lamented that "the
soft bigotry of low expectations," Bush's education
catch-phrase, has been turnedback on the president
himself.
In other words, a "smart" Bush will be held accountable by American voters for whatever goes
wrong. But a "dumb" Bush will never be blamed by
a public that expects little from him and doesn't really think he's in the captain's chair to begin with.
Mark it up as another right-wing conspiracy, one
might say. The economy is sinking, most Americans
don't support a conservative ideology, and the
President's speech patterns happen to be a bit dyslexic anyway. Why not float the idea that W. is an
intellectual light-weight but an overall nice guy?
Enact a radical agenda with impunity, and re-elect
Bush, smart or dumb, in 2004.
Liberals, then, should expose Bush for what he
really is: a smart guy. Gasp!
Smart guy my mouse pad, says Timothy Noah in
Slate, complicating the issue even more: "The mere
fact that journalists... bother to argue thatBush isn't
dumb is itselfevidence that he is dumb." Noah cites
the editor of "Reagan In His Own Hand," who defends Reagan as a not-so-dumb guy because "at times
he cites his sources in the text."
"Now let's be serious," Noah concludes. "If
Anderson said these things about you, would you be
flattered?"

Hillary can run for Senate. Nixon gives the Checkers speech so he can be a crook. FDR fakes polio for

Dear Editor:
Last week, I read a smokescreen, composed in a sarcastic,
dry, witty manner with a rhetoric so nauseatingly distant that
I could hardly believe it was writtenby one of my schoolmates.
David Ellis has dangerously collapsed religion, tradition and
virtue into one and the same for the purposes of his conservative argument.
When EL 1is writes, "Why are local communities prohibited
from teaching their youth virtue? For this we have to thank
the Warren court," he is collapsing the concepts of virtue and
religion. While I believe thatreligion does help strengthen our
moral stance, the one does not have
to necessarily emanate from the
other. Meanwhile, the Supreme
Court under Earl Warren ended
school segregation in the United
States, and in Little Rock, Ark. protectedblack students under threats
from their own state with federal
guard. We learn virtue through

Marxist ideology.
Religious organizations have the right to have a political
point of view, and encourage people to advocate politically
However, a national or state political body that justifies their
laws through theirrighteousness in the eyes of God only paves
the road to oppression.
Now, let's imagine for a second that we follow Ellis' argument about the need for more virtue and religious education.
Increasingly we push towards more vouchers and favor religious education programs, abandoning a quest to restore public schooling. What the children will receive is discipline, certainly, but they will be sacrificing the very exposure to a
mamm^^^^^^^^m
variety of cultures, viewpoints,
and backgrounds that public

looking at these actions.
Also, when writing that "government is the sole agent in society with the legitimate power to
use force in making people do
things against their will," I would
have hoped Ellis saw the irony in his own argument. Such
legitimate power is the very reason why notions of religious
obligation should not be the basis for government actions in
society. Religion is just as powerful a tool for social oppression as it isfor personal reform take a look at Afghanistan,
the Third Reich: religious practices out of step with the majority are systematically terminated with the aid of government force. Religion does not inherently teach virtue in these
cases
our Pope endorsed the policies of Hitler, it is only
recently thatthe Pope has come outpublicly against the death
penalty, and many Christian groups stillbelieve in execution.
Religion does not inherently teach one set of virtues or values
when used by government, it becomes the ultimate rubber
stamp by the dominant social or political ideology. Also, to
reassure Ellis, I also don't believe an atheistic state would be
any more virtuous
look at how China has set about eliminating religions within its borders for the purposes of its

education allows for.
Ellis writes thatthe Warren
Court helped strip the "states'
rights to conduct religion, a
right the people had taken for
granted ever since the first
at
colonists
landed
Jamestown." Once again, he
invokes tradition and nationalism to confusing ends. Was
the Warren Court responsible
for prohibiting people from performing their own religious
practices in their houses of worship? If you want a hellish
instance of states conducting religion, look no further than
the Salem witch trials among the Puritans in traditional New
England.

It is the local communities' right to decide what their children are taught: if the Kansas school board decides to stop
teaching evolutionary theory, then they have that right. However, this is different in the case of teaching religious virtue.
Classes on religious virtue would inevitably alienate atheists,
agnostics or believers from marginalized religions. I'm sure
Christians would invite all such groups to participate, but such
courses should never become part of a required curriculum.
Our very free will is God's way of making sure we come to
him freely, rather than being forced by our local community,
school, or government to recognize his authority.

Jesse Taylor and Maria Alvarez, as the King and Queen, cling to a sense of nobility in Drama Board's latest production, despite being reduced to bit players and wearing trash.

'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' deathly funny
BY DAN MARRIN

"What is so terrible about death? Since we don't know what death is, it is illogical to
fear it," philosophizes the gentle Rosencrantz. Imagine that the only way for anyone to
really pass on is to accept their death. Until acceptance, the almost deceased will have to
repeat the circumstances of his brief life and death, only this time without recalling how
he got there or when it all started. Forgetting the motivations for his actions even, he
becomes a bit player, an observer of the show, with so much time to see the absurdity ofit
all that he would be robbed of the sense of life's greater purpose. Suddenly, death seems
preferable, and it wouldn'ttake much for him to accept deathand pass on. Such is the state
in which we find Hamlet's bit characters, Rosencrantz (Chris Keary 'O3) and Guildenstern
(Laura Wolfram 'O2) in Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."
Catherine Osborne's production of Tom Stoppard's 1967 hit comedy, gives just the right
blend of absurdist fantasy, comedy and tragedy. While Keary emphasizes Rosencrantz's
unending need for logic and the elimination of any arbitrary elements in his life story,
Wolfram taps into Guildenstern's wish to control the play, take a differentrole or stop the
action altogether. To add to the strangeness ofit all, the two are constantly unable to retain
the point of their own conversations or actions after a certain time, like two distracted
ADD amnesiacs trying to get a grasp and continually feeling reality slip between their
fingers.
The third and perhaps most devious participant in the game is The Player (Sam Blair 'O2).
Though based on the actual leader of the band of actors in Hamlet, in Stoppard's hands, the
Player becomes a lecherous, lascivious intruder in the lives ofRosencrantz and Guildenstern,
the one who constantly dissuades them of any other ultimate fate meant for us besides death,
and any other point to the show besides pure entertainment.
Stoppard made it very clear that before any questions of fate or the significance oflife or
death, his play was meant to be funny. Believe me, he succeeds. Just about every word by
Stoppard is a trick, a banana peel. However, the dialogue flies by so quickly that you miss a lot
once you stop to laugh or think. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's dialogue is like a 90-minute
game ofWho's on First?, with a dash of Yogi Berra and uppers thrown in.

Then there are the outlandish outfits, crafted by Laura Seeley 'OL While Rosencrantz and
Guildensternhave been given relatively respectable outfits in the after-death, every character that uses them as a bit part is dressed in trash, from bubble wrap to plastic cups. For
Osborne, the outfits emphasize how main players like Hamlet (David January, in white-anddark trash bags) and the King (Jesse Taylor, with plastic cup necklace and booming bass
voice) and Queen (Maria Alvarez) use bit players and chuck them away once no longer necessary for their schemes.
The simplistic sets, though probably as much related to budget as theme, nicely emphasize
the otherworldly nature of where Rosencrantz and Guildensternfind themselves as they contemplate where, when, who, and why they are. Occasionally propelled back into the
Shakespearean tragedy that previously brought them to their deaths, they become ever more
convinced of the absurdity of the plot of "Hamlet" from their alienated position.
This of course works perfectly, because in observing the absurdity ofHamlet's characters
the audience begins to agree with Rosencrantz and Guildensternand becomes more sympathetic to their plight. Stoppard has performed a role reversal here, turning the smallest peons
into the major players and making Shakespeare's major players into fools. At one point, as
Hamlet, January nobly walks to the edge of a ship, and spits only to have it thrownright back
in his eye. He swiftly walks back past the crowd, ignoring the spit, determined to appear noble
and melancholy no matter what.
If there were one thing I wish, it would have been that Osborne's direction had allowed
for more physical comedy amidst the nonsense of "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern." For all
the wonderful verbal interplay, there are too many moments of the actors just standing
still with arms at sides or justpacing the floor. There is one brief moment where Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern emerge from a barrel, ducking their heads out in opposite directions,
and the very sight of them together like that is enough to make you giggle. The physical
comedy instead comes mostly from the mute Players, from Blair's own suggestive turns
and poses, and from January as Hamlet, who successfully turns one of the most cherished,
studied characters of all literature into an utter fop. That alone is worth seeing this show
for. Catherine Osborne's production of "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead" runs Thursday and Friday night in the LPAC mainstage at 8 p.m.

Dogma versus

decadence
BY ESTER BLOOM
Lasse Hallstrom's "Chocolat" seems to come our way
via Hershey's, not Hollywood. It is as predictable, clearcut, and satisfying in a small, forgettable way as a tinfoil-wrapped Kiss.
The year is 1960. In America, the sexual revolution
is just beginning to shake the amber waves of grain; in
France, the clever north windis blowing Vianne Rocher
(Juliette Binoche) into a narrow-minded, autocratic
village to effect the same change on her own. Her daughter Anouk, who narrates a little here and there, and
Anouk's invisible friend, a kangaroo, are in tow.
They rent out an old bakery and the rooms above it
from Armande (Dame Judi Dench), a foul-mouthed,
short-tempered free spirit. The source of her trouble,
Vianne learns, is that her strict, religious daughter
Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss, looking quite different
than she did in The Matrix) will not let Armande see
her grandson Luc. Caroline is altogether too pious and
protective: she will not even let Luc ride a bike. The
repressed child finds a creative outlet in art and
sketches gory masterpieces and carcasses ofbirds.
This is one of the many problems in the town that

surface inside the chocolaterie thatVianne establishes.
In the chocolaterie, Vianne sets up the equivalent of a
bar and, as customers indulge in her candy
which
seems to have the magical properties of alcohol, pot
and Viagra combined—they lose their inhibitions and
tell their intriguing stories.
Armande is the shop's first regular and Vianne's
first friend; they bond over their unwillingness to go
to church and to conform in general to the rules of
society as prescribed by staid, repressed mayor Comte
de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Vianne and the mayor
get off on the wrong foot from their very first interaction. The Mayor greets Vianne as "Madame" and she
quickly corrects him: "Mademoiselle," she says. "I've
never been married." It does not help that she is serving chocolate in which, since it is Lent, the mayor will
not let himself partake. He scurries away, stomach
growling, and makes it his personal goal to get Vianne
and the corrupting influence ofher chocolates out of
his town.
Further aggravating things, Vianne assists
Josephine (Lena Olin), an abused wife, in escaping
her husband's fist and harbors her when she finally
leaves her husband. Under Vianne's wing, Josephine
thrives and becomes a happy, healthy, contributing
member of society. But the mayor is offended because
she is breaking her marriage vows and this strengthens his resolve to get the better of Vianne.
Vianne, however, is a regular Mary Poppins.
Blown, as is stated over and over again, by the clever
north wind, she travels, resolving issues and sweetening dispositions and generally paving the way for a
more tolerant, permissive age. In this particular town,
she meets her match in river rat Roux (Johnny Depp,
who, with an absurd Irish brogue, fake tan and a wardrobe straight out of a vintage store in SoHo, never
seems quite real). The dilemma arises: will she continue on, borne by that oh-so-clever north wind, or
will she finally stay put? "Chocolat" is as simple as it
is sweet. Its central fight, that of rigid Catholicism
versus confection, is not a difficult one on which to
take sides. And of course, this being saccharine-loving America, it's not tough to figure out which wins.

at Uncle Ed's Liquor Store who just happens to notice that, whereas your ID indicates you are a 6-foot-4-inch, 40-yearold man of Turkish decent named
"Iqmar," you are in fact a 5-foot-4-inch
Caucasian woman aged 19 years. But
whatever the particulars, rejection cannot be avoided.
For my part, I am no foreigner to the
Land of Nay. Even in attempting to
write for this illustrious publication I
was at first stung bitterly by the Hornet of Non-Acceptance. I remember vividly the letter I received from the editors after first sending them my work:

Dear Mr. Spadola,
Your writing is positively atrocious. We
think you would be better off finding
some other way to pass your time.
Perhaps a hobby of some kind.
Preferably one that does not involve
the use of words. Such as
Minesweeper or Parcheesi or, better
still, ice fishing in the heart of the
Siberian wilderness. We have heard
it's pleasant this time of year.
Yours, etc.
But I did not lose heart. I persisted, I
persevered, and most importantly, I
begged shamelessly. That is the key. The
next time your professor turns down
your three-week-late paper, don't sit in
your room and mope about it! Instead,
march yourself right into his or her office, address yourself clearly and professionally, and then mope about it!
Rend your v-neck sweater and whine

like the dickens right in front of his or
her eyes.
Open bribery is another option. If
you happen to notice any Phoenix edi-

tors donning particularly expensive
timepieces, don't think it is because
they've been putting in overtime at the
publications office, ifI make my meaning plain.
So even after suffering the heaviest

blows that fortune can deal, you can rise
up and overcome. But what should one
do, you ask, if pleading and bribery does
not work? The key is preparation. You
must have a way of organizing your life
that fortifies you against any possible
mishap. A shining example of excellent
preparation and organization is the
sandwich bar at Sharpies, where a fork
the size of a standard gardening rake is
used to scoop up individual slices of
cold-cuts packed so tightly that, after innumerable fruitless attempts at stabbing and poking and slicing, you are
forced to give up your efforts and get
the chicken croquettes instead. What organizational brilliance! I ask you, would
anyone eat the chicken croquettes for
any other reason?
Here are some things you can do to
begin learning to handle rejection:
First, go to the nearest mirror, take
a long, good look at the person before
you, and say to yourself: "Why the hell
didn't anyone tell me I had a piece of
spinach the size of a small head of lettuce stuck between my teeth?!" This will
help build your confidence and remind
you that the help and consideration of
friends is indispensable.

THERE IS NO
PROVISION WHEREBY
MEN CAN OVERRIDE A
REJECTION WITH A
TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY
VOTE.
The next thing you should do is make
a list of reasons why you are a wonderful person. If you don't get picked as an
RA, or if you don't get that summer internship, or if you don't manage to buy
that case of Coor's Lite, don't despair.
You must resist the temptation to say to
yourself, "I am worthless. I am just categorically worthless. I'm so worthless I
don't even know what 'categorically'
means." Rather, jot down all the good
things you can say about yourself. Hopefully my list will give you some ideas:
11 play the violin...well, I own a violin
actually it's my roommate's, but I
pluck on the strings every now and then.
2. I've managed to do my laundry with
the greatest possible infrequency by resourcefully neglecting the washing-machine instructions "do not pack."
3.1 can rearrange the letters of my last
name to spell "lapdance," borrowing and
replacing a few letters here and there.
And lastly, when rejection comes
as rejection will whatever you do, do
not attempt to find solace in the many
proverbs and aphorisms with which our
language abounds. You will only become more confused and dejected, because for every proverb, there is another one that gives exactly the oppo...

site advice. For instance: He who hesitates is lost, but patience is a virtue;

there's always room for improvement,

but if it ain't broken don't fix it; life is
short but sweet, but life's a bitch; remember the Alamo, but let bygones be

bygones; whatever happens happens,
but shit happens; etc.
So it's probably best to avoid sayings

of all kinds. In particular, you should
avoid the ever-popular "It could be
worse." This is without doubt the most
irritating phrase of consolation which
ever escaped fromhuman lips. Of course
it could be worse! It can always be worse
even if you're Al Gore. Whenever
someone says this to me (and I thinkthis
is how most people respond), I want to
take thatperson, stick him in a cramped,
unventilated, pitch-black room, and play
Cher's "Believe" on repeat, periodically
interrupting to point out thatit could be
worse.
I have come to a point at which I can
no longer put off discussing the type of
rejection that is most feared and most
devastating, namely rejection by the opposite sex. Guys especially worry about
this. Women, naturally, are entirely
carefree, because they have nature's
blessing: the ability to dish out rejection,
rather thanreceive it. To make a political analogy, their power in this respect
is akin to the president's veto, except
that there is no provision whereby men
can override a rejection with a twothirds majority vote (otherwise Alicia
Silverstone would not be single, because
she has overwhelming bipartisan support in both the upper and (especially)
the lower House of the male body politic).

The drawback for women, however,
is that, by long tradition, they cannot
formally propose new legislation; they
have to operate by insinuation, winking
at key Senators and Representatives
during dinner parties and other political functions. Sometimes, it is true, they
employ friends and sympathizers as lobbyists to plead their case. Nonetheless,
to win over a Congressman, you must
often be willing to sacrifice your own integrity and offer patronage and personal
favors because many politicians only
seem to care about one thing, and we all
know what that is.
So rejection, my friends, is no easy
thing. But, even when facing the worst
of it, you need to keep your head high
and be proud of who you are. And anyway, it's always darkest before dawn.

Naked and psychologically
penetrating, Alice Neel
establishes master status
BY KATE

O'DONNELL

It is no coincidence that most masters, regardless of form,
are only recognized as such once they are dead. And, as much
as they might have claimed, this is not necessarily because they
were so unappreciated or misunderstood.From what I can tell,
it's that it takes a whole lifetime's worth of work in order to
finally achieve and capture greatness.
So in the meantime, I guess I will just live vicariously through
the legacy of the dead masters. No, I am not into necrophilia. My
mind has recently been reeling with thoughts ofAlice Neel, having been to her show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art last
weekend, and the more I think about her work, the more I realize her late stuff is really quite great, to put it simply.
Let's contextualize for a little bit, within the framework ofher
career. Born at the turn of the last century, Neel first asserted
herself in the art world during the Depression. Her work from
this time, which is little
more than wannabe Diego
Rivera, goes through the
motions of recording poverty, misery and tragedy,
but it evokes little pathos.
The show fills two rooms
with this kind of work, and,

whilebleak, it is little more
than that. Gradually, the

show, which is organized
chronologically and is
dominated by portraiture,
starts to hint at Neel's in-

Alice Neel, Self Portrait (1980)

sight, which developed
most fully in the 1970s and
80s. Before then, it's not
like she wasn't living up to
her potential. It's that it
took her a whole lifetime to
her true potential
and finally express it on

{realize
canvas.

Neel is actually pretty famous for a couple ofreasons. First of
all, during the time when America was going crazy with Abstract
Expressionism (think Pollock), ColorField painting (a la Rothko)
and Pop Art (as in Andy and company), Neel stuck to the figure.
In her traditionalism, though, she was the anti-trendy, and, thus,
in her own way both revolutionary and unique.
The fact that she carved out her niche among all of these macho-types is no small feat. And she clearly had connections with
prominent women during her lifetime. Several of the paintings in
the show are of famous artists and art historians such as Linda
Nochlin (with her daughter) and Faith Ringgold. Then there'sthe
portrait ofAnnie Sprinkle: you can make of that what you will
and let your imagination run wild. Or, just go and see the show.
My favorite painting in the show and the one I felt most succinctly embodied Neel's greatness was her self-portrait painted
in 1980. She painted herself nude, adorned only by her glasses,
her aged body perched in a classic wicker chair. She holds a paintbrush and gazes out at the viewer almost, but not quite, face-on.
It is not a comfortablepainting. I don'tknow thatportraiture is
ever comfortable, insomuch as good portraiture penetrates the
viewer's psychology and situates him in a sensitive space that is
by no means neutral. This particular portrait is not comfortable
because it forces the viewer and the sitter and the artist (making
for an interesting interdependent relationship) to confront mortality and the marks of age and time. Neel's glasses codify her age
but also evoke associations about the meaning of sight external
and internal in all ofits forms and the significance thereof.
The significance of a nude, elderly woman must be acknowledged in order to appreciate the consequence of the portrait.
Neel asserts her personal worth, immortalizing herself on canvas and does so within a context that often excludes women

and the elderly. That she sees this frameworkfor exactly what
it is and challenges it is no insignificant feat. That she does so
with such candor and poignancy elevates her to the level of a
master deserving of both popular recognition and self-recognition, even if she was 80 by the time she achieved this.
This portrait isn't the only great piece in the show, but if for
this one painting, situated between a portrait of a female art
historian from Oberlin and a portrait of the art historian Meyer
Schapiro, the show is worth checking out. Or at least, Neel's
penetrative work is worth taking a look at. So that you can see,
not just record and process, but something about individuals,
about human psychology, and just maybe, about yourself.

spike Celebrate diversity: plagiarize
As a student publication required to supply a representative to the Forum For a Free
Press for Spring budgeting this year, we at Spike could not help but notice an upstart publication endeavoring to set itself up as our competition. From their grant proposal, it was
clear that the progenitors of the F-Word were unaware that a Spike co-editor was a member
of the funding committee they dared to claim that their publication would be "funnier"
than Spike, and would publish "a more diverse style ofhumor." The infidels!
This Spike co-editor attempted (successfully) to remain objective, even going so far as

to persuade her reluctant co-committee members that the F-Word deserved a chance to
publish more articles such as "I Fucked Your Mom: An Erotic Adventure" and to establish
themselves as an alternative, non-redundant humor magazine. Though we are wary of

spearheading a direct attack on the F-Word and thus giving them that scrappy underdog
appeal, we feel compelled to answer their challenge of diversification. We could not possibly become more funny, because a black funny hole would open up in the universe, destroying all in its path. Rather, we have chosen to become more diverse, to broaden our
horizons and to welcome a greater variety of humor into our already teeming cornucopia

of humorous fruits.
To this end, we have turned to the masters of funny. We broke out the Ouija board and
channeled our funniest spiritual advisors, past and present: P.G. Wodehouse. Edward Gorey.
God. Dr. Egon Spengler. Chaucer's Miller. We turn to these fine, fine muthafuckas in our
hour of need, and we ask them what they wore to Sager.

"This is big, Peter. This is very big.
There is definitely something here," I whispered. Venkman wasn't listening to me,
though. He, too, was mesmerized by the
lights flashing wildly from within the
structure. When I pointed my
Psychokenetic Energy Meter at the gray,
stony facade, the readings went through
the roof, and the thought of the supernatural activity that was going on inside made
me quake right down to my Ectoplasm-resistant galoshes.
Just then, a spirit dripping with blue
slime emerged from the building. Her hair
stood on end, radiating an uncanny iridescence. Possessed by a ghoul, or an entire
bottle ofExtra-hold Aqua Net? "Ray,"l continued, "This looks extraordinarily bad."
"Let's get her!" Venkman cried.
I was skeptical. "It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building! Something terrible is
about the enter our world and this building is obviously the door. The architect's
name was Ivo Shandor. I found it in the
college guidebook. He was also a doctor.
Performed a lot of unnecessary surgery.
And then in 1920 he founded a secret society. After the First World War, Shandor
decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone, he had close to
a thousand followers when he died. They
conducted rituals up on the roof of the bell
tower, bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end ofthe world, and now it looks
like it may actually happen!" No wonder

the place had been locked up for decades.
Peter, Ray, Winston and I charged our proton packs and went in. It was even worse than
we had feared. "This is hot, Ray," I marveled.
"Ray, it's moving." The room was seething

with paranormal entities. Peter was trying to
get my attention, but I was paralyzed. I didn't
know where to point my proton stream first.
"Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrifiedbeyond the
capacity for rational thought." What kind of
hell nexus was this place? My PKE meter was
going haywire. "Okay, let's say a Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic
energy in the New York area," I began, preparing to bust some ghost. "According to my
readings, the energy in this room would be a
Twinkie thirty-five feet long weighing approximately six hundred pounds."
"That's a big Twinkie," Winston replied.
"I don't think he's human," I agreed, and
we aimed our proton streams at the frightening form of a dancing demon, slimed head to
hairless pectoral muscles to foot, sporting a
dog collar and a leather g-string.
"Excuse me, are you guys Tri-Co?"a girl
wearing a garnet t-shirt that read "Party Associate" asked suddenly.
We looked at one another. "Uh, no," Ray
replied. Then she kicked us out of the party.
Winston glowered on the way back to the
car. "Ray, when someone asks you if you're
Tri-Co, you say, 'Yes!'"

Human rights workers call

fessors, and others about the current
political environment in Columbia. The
talk took place on Monday afternoon in
the Scheuer Room
Spanish professor Aurora Camacho
de Schmidt introduced the speakers and
gave some background.
La violencia, she explained, was the

period of civil war in the 1940s and 1950s
when a bloody civil war between different elite factions left thousands of Colombians dead.

People are speaking of a "new violence," said Camacho de Schmidt, as the
government engages in a war against
guerilla insurgents.
According to human rights groups,
she said, a campaign by the military and
paramilitary intended to target the guerillas has left many innocent civilians
dead and has given Colombia with the
worst human rights record in the western hemisphere.
In the last year, Colombia has re-entered U.S. headlines because of the
government's Plan Colombia.

Under the plan, said Camacho de
Schmidt, $2.2 million in U.S. aid, mostly
military, is flowing into Colombia every
day.
The aid, approved by Congress last
spring, is officially designated for antidrug efforts focused on Colombia's
coca-growing regions. Human rights
activists contend that the money is being used instead by the military in the

war with the guerillas, killing thousands of Colombian citizens in the process.
After Camacho de Schmidt's introduction, Madero, president of the Regional Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights (CREDHOS), discussed
the violent situation in his city of

Barrancabermeja.

Madero spoke of the neo-liberal economic policy Colombia has followed,
which he believes will continue to leave
the masses in poverty.
Many of his activist colleagues, he
said, have been killed in the latest
surge of violence, but it is important
to keep struggling. Plan Colombia is

strengthening a military which does
not respect human rights, Madero

said.
He ended with a call for students and
professors to speak out to others, includ-

ing their congressional representatives,
against Plan Colombia.
Dialogue between the government
and the guerillas provides the only possible path towards peace, Madero be-

lieves.

Palacios, a former priest and current
organizer of the Putamayo Project of
Peaceful Coexistence, took the microphone next. He comes from the southern border of Colombia, near Ecuador,
where the United States began backing
anti-narcotics fumigation last year.
Stressing the devastating ecological
impact which the fumigation is having,
Palacios said that for every acre of coca
plants fumigated, seven surrounding
acres also have to be treated.
This practice causes severe environmental damage, which affects
many non-coca plants in addition to
the intended targets.
He offered pictures of children suffering from the adverse affects of the
chemicals used.
"This policy," he said, "is stupid, idiotic and irreparable. My children and I
will not be able to change this back."
Once, when Palacios was in a church,
guerrilla forces entered and assassinated
several of the priests in front of him.
Palacios echoed Madero's callfor negotiations as the way to peace. If a military solution is attempted, he said, "each
side will only continue to build up its
strength" to offset the other.
Professor Ken Sharpe moderatedthe
question-and-answer period and spoke
to clarify the origins of the United
States' Plan Colombia.The government
of Colombia, Sharpe said, originally
asked only for economic development
aid. The U.S. government refused this
original plan.
The United States insisted that any
aid granted have a large military component to be used for anti-drug measures, Sharpe said.
The government ofColombia was not
looking for a full-scale military confrontation with the guerrillas or the drug
cartels, but that's what Plan Colombia
has given them, Sharpe said, echoing

Madero and Palacios.
Madero and Palacios closed the talk
by asking the audience for a minute of
applause to recognize all of those—military, guerilla and civilian
who have
died in Colombia as a result of violence,
thanking those present for standing up
in honor of the victims.

Former U.S.

senator to
visit campus
BY JON EHRENFELD
Former Senator J. Robert Kerrey will speak about
"Retirement and Health Security in a Post-Industrialist Age" on April 3.
He plans to address issues he dealt with as a senator, including Medicare and the Internal Revenue
Service. The lecture is open to the college and the
public.
Kerrey was the governor of Nebraska from 1982
to 1987. Following that, he served as the senator from
Nebraska from 1988 to 2000.
A presidential candidate in 1992, there has been
talk that Kerrey may again seek the presidency in
2004.
During his tenure as a senator, Kerrey focused
on issues of health, education, fiscal policy and farm

reform.
He served on a bipartisan Medicare commission,
chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement
and Tax Reform and co-chaired the National Bipartisan Commission on Restructuring the IRS. He was
also a member of the Senate Appropriations Com-

mittee from 1989 to 1996.
Kerrey's time in politics saw him recalibrate the
Nebraska budget, work toward strengthening the
state's education system, and design programs to
proliferate online and distance learning.
One of his projects, the Communications Learning and Assessment in a Student-centered System
(CLASS), created a high school distance learning
program over the Internet.
Kerrey entered the Navy as a SEAL during the
Vietnam War in1966. While serving, he was wounded
by a grenade in combat, and received an honorable
discharge in 1969. In 1970, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor. During his time in Congress,
Kerrey was the only member to have received this
distinction.
After his term as senator ended, Kerrey was asked
by the New School University in New York City to
serve as their president. On February 20, he was instituted as the school's seventh president. The New
School, located in Greenwich Village, is composed
of primarily art-based schools.
According to The New York Times, Kerrey had
never heard of the New School prior to being asked
to lead it. The Times speculated that he was likely

sought out by the school because of the breadth of
his experience and knowledge.

Committee represents
student-athletes
BY GABRIEL HETLAND AND ANNA MASILELA

Members of the newly-formed Student-Athlete Advisory Committee
have big plans for this semester, including a jam-packed Athletes'
Day on Saturday, April 7.
The Athletes' Day will include a barbecue lunch with a DJ outside
Sharpies, five home games and an all-campus party that night. Other events
will take place outside the Lamb-Miller field house. A marching band from
a local high school may be invited to perform and other kid-friendly activities are still being planned. Committee chair Randy Keim 'O2 said the
senior class may sell t-shirts and possibly food. The event is intended to
introduce the committee to the campus and community.
Keim says the NCAA has mandated a student-athlete advisory committee for all colleges with intercollegiate sports teams since 1989, and the
Centennial Conference since 1995. Swarthmore's SAAC started to come
together last November when vice-chair Kasia Koziol-Dube 'O3 attended
an NCAA meeting with Marc Jeuland 'OL The inaugural meeting, which
included representatives from every varsity sport except men's soccer and
golf, was held March 2L
SAAC will supplement the other student-athlete organization, the captains' council, which meets twice a year. The captains mostly discuss issues pertaining directly to their individual team's needs. Koziol-Dube said
SAAC gives all student-athletes the opportunity to participate in decisionmaking. "This is about getting the things we need to get done, done," she
(SAAC)

said at the first meeting.
According to Keim, the football controversy from last semester alerted
many athletes of the need to be more unified and informed about decisions regarding athletics at the college. "This is the first time that all of
the athletes on campus have gotten together as a whole," he said.
Keim also said that SAAC hopes to begin talking about decisions and
resources for athletics on campus. One of the group's long-term goals is to
formulate a "wish list" of facilities and equipment and present that list to
the Athletics Review Committee (ARC) and athletics director Bob Williams. Each team will submit the five things it would like to have done,
said Keim, and the 10 most important will be sent to Williams and the
ARC.
Keim mentioned the athletes' wish list during the Student Council-sponsoredfireside chat about diversity and athletics on Tuesday. Provost Jenny
Keith, who is also a member of the ARC, said that it would be a welcome
addition to the wish list submitted by coaches.
Keim said that part of the reason for having such a wish list would be
to put the administration in tune with athletes' own desires. This could
prevent the administration from spending money or time for resources
which athletes don't actually see as necessary, he said.
Part of the group's mission is to improve relations between studentathletes and the rest of campus, as well as to improve the interactions
between athletes and non-athletes. Another reason for forming SAAC, said
Keim, is to gain greater insight into decisions that administration plans
to make. Keim said that athletes have been hearing many rumors about
the borough's hotel proposal, which would involve the relocation of some

Swat softbal needs a win
BY LINDSAY VANSCIVER

The play on the Swarthmore College softball field
this season seems to be as icy as the weather: following a six-game losing streak during spring training
in Orlando, Fla., Swarthmore softball is finding it difficult to put that first "W" on the scoreboard.
Although the addition of assistant coach Katie
Souder to the staff and six freshman players strengthened the depth and potential of the team, the Tide
cannot seem to find the necessary runs at the plate to
grab the wins. However, the Lady Garnet's most recent 5-2 loss to Widener on Monday, March 26, proved
to be an step in the right direction offensively.
A scoreless first inning for the Pioneers provided
the perfect opportunity for the Tide to take advantage at the plate. Tri-captain Deirdre Downey 'Ol lead
off with a single. Tri-captain Heather Marandola 'Ol
and Stephanie Wotjkowski 'O2 also answered to
Widener's defense with back-to-back singles that left
the bases loaded with no outs and a rally at the plate.
A double by Stephanie Cross 'O4 sent Downey home,
and Marandola immediately followed off a single by
Gretchen Heitz 'O4.
Swarthmore's offensive powerhouse start leaked
into the defense as well, where the Tide managed to
hold the Pioneers scoreless until the fourth inning.
"For the first time in a while, we were actually
hitting the ball in a game as well as we do everypractice. I think this strengthened our defense as well,
because we were finally securing runs and coming
close to a win," said centerfielder Pam Lavallee 'O3.

It was in the fourth inning that the Pioneers
broke through, posting four runs. The Lady Garnet was unable to recover their hot bats from the
first inning, and Widener sealed the win in the sixth
inning with a single run. The seventh inning proved
uneventful for Swarthmore at the plate, and Widener walked away with a 5-2 win over the Tide.
"We had to beat Widener. We have the skill, we
have the dedication, the motivation, all that. We
just make careless mistakes that cost us big runs,
and we have a tough time making up for those mistakes at the plate," tri-captain Portia Kelly 'Ol concluded.
The Tide lost its conference-opening doubleheader to Western Maryland on Saturday, Mar. 24
as well as its season opener to Arcadia College on
Tuesday, March 20. While in Orlando, Swarthmore
lost a series ofthree doubleheaders to Western New
England College, Olivet Nazerene College, Bethany
College and Cumberland College respectively. The
Garnet's record now stands at 0-10.
Yesterday, the Garnet lost 6-3 to a visiting University of the Sciences. Swat hit well in the losing
effort, with Downey hitting a single, and Heitz an
RBI. Marandola had a double RBI. The score remained 0-0 until the third inning, when the U of S
had four runs. The Garnet just couldn't capitalize

on their hits.
Next up for the Garnet is Philadelphia University on Friday, March 30. Swarthmore faces a
conference doubleheader at Ursinus on Tuesday,
April 3.

athletic fields. SAAC hopes to move beyond these rumors, so that athletes
will have a clearer idea of the college's policies which could affect them.
SAAC is also seeking to have student-athletes represented on the search
committee for the newly created position of Associate Director of Athletics. The committee will be chaired by athletic director Bob Williams and
engineering professor Art McGarity but no other members have yet been
chosen.
The other officers of SAAC, elected at the March 21 meeting along with
Keim and Koziol-Dube, are secretary Maria-Elena Young 'O4 and treasurer
David Pearce 'O3. Each varsity sport team will have one voting member,
but other members of varsity teams are invited to attend meetings.
Keim, Koziol-Dube, Krista Gigone 'O4 and Matt Goldstein 'O4 will attend a Centennial Conference-wide SAAC meeting on April 1 at Franklin
Marshall College.

Women's lax: sizzling season opener Women's rugby

falls to Navy 57-0

BY KATIE CLOONAN
With visions ofPanama City's balmy skies and sandy
beaches dashed, the women's lacrosse team faced the
season's first tough opponent this past weekend: spring
weather.
Despite frosty conditions, the Garnet Tide arrived at
the Seven Sisters Tournament on Saturday, March 24, determined to come away with an immediate win. The tournament, held at Haverford, hosted a total of eight teams,
including perennial powerhouse Wellesley College and the
wild card invitee Trinity College (Conn.).
Swarthmore started out with a bang as the Lady Laxers
pulled away from Mount Holyoke College. Sharing draw
control duties were 2001 preseason All-American Kristen
English 'Ol and sophomore standout Liz Brainard 'O3. By
the end ofthe game, Holyoke had a difficult time deciding
the Swarthmore offense or the wind
what hit harder
factor. A decisive 7-4 win was entered into the scorebooks
that day in favor of the Garnet.
The following game, against Trinity College, proved
another story for Swarthmore as the team was handed a
loss, 16-5. Led by 2001 preseason AU-American Mary Jacobs,
an explosive offense and fine-tuned defense proved Trinity worthy of the Seven Sisters Championship title the
Connecticut team eventually took home. On a high note,
however, the goalie duo of Jenn Hart 'O3 and Sam Uslan
'O3 wowed the crowd with excellent goaltending, despite
yellow-card-happy referees.
The next day, Swarthmore valiantly fought a nail-biting battle for third place in arctic weather. Despite trailing Smith for most of the game, the Garnet staged a dramatic come-from-behind surge late in the game. Keeping
the crowd on its toes, Natania Kremer 'Ol tallied a gametying goal at theend of regulation with one secondleft on
the clock. Mavis Biss 'O2 scored the game-winning goal in
double overtime to give Swarthmore a hard-earned 13-12
win.
To make the day even better, both Katie Tarr 'O2 and
Hart earned All-Tournament Team honors. Hart had 41
saves over the weekend and was named to the Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll.
Yesterday afternoon, the Garnet lost its conference and
home opener 10-8 to Washington College. In a game reminiscent of Sunday's come-from-behind win, the Lady
Laxers attempted to squeak by the Shorewomen after playing a lackluster first half. With about five minutes remaining, Swarthmore tied up the game at 8-8 after trailing by
four goals at the half. But it was not to be a repeat over-

This past weekend the Swarthmore women'srugby team drove
to Annapolis to battle the Naval Academy. The Quakers, seeded
last in the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union (MARFU) Division I playoffs, went up against one of the top three teams in the
country. Swat suffered a heartbreaking 57-0 loss to Navy.
This was the first time in five years thatSwarthmore has qualified for playoffs at the Mid-Atlantic level. Through it all,
Swarthmore never let their commitment to the game waver and
played surprisingly well defensively. This was Swat's first defensive game this season after offensively dominating the College of New Jersey and Franklin Marshall earlier in the spring
&

season.
After the first few minutes ofthe game, forward Maya Peterson
'O2 shut down a breakaway would-be scorer, pulling her down by
her jersey inches away from the try zone. During the next 15
minutes of the first half, Swat kept Navy from scoring. The forwardshad impressive pushes in the scrums, going toe-to-toe with
the strength of the armed forces.
The A-side back line played aggressively, taking down the
Navy centers time and again. They played a strong defensive
game, making scoring, even for the Navy's trained killing machines, extremely difficult. Wing Emily Sigalow 'O2 popped a
beautiful kick right over the Navy heads, behind their wing and
away from their fullback, gaining Swat much-needed yardage.
Flyhalf Cathy Vaughan 'Ol was fierce, taking down Navy's
mammoth 6'o" fullback with a perfect tackle. Inside center Laura
Blume 'Ol threw herself into every tackle without so much as a
moment ofhesitation. Outside center Katie Harper 'O2 drove their i

time battle, as Washington put one behind Hart to take the
lead two minutes later. With just one second left on the
clock, the Shorewomen sliced in an insurance goal. Stellar goalie Hart had 16 saves. Brainard had three goals and
one assist, while a semi-injured Tarr had 2 goals.
Expect some thrilling match-ups in the next couple of
weeks as Swat takes on two conference foes: Dickinson on
the road this Saturday, March 31; and Ursinus, ranked

With a 59.4 save percentage, Hart

wings crazy with her fast-flying kicks.
Captain Nancy Craig 'Ol said, "Katie played one of her most
amazing games ever. Her kicks landed exactly where we needed
them to, gaining Swarthmore several yards of valuable ground."
In fact, Harper's kicks were so powerful that once she punted

the ball into the river behind the field. Swat fan Jeremy Slezak
'O2 dove in to retrieve it.
Fullback Rabi Whitaker 'O3 came to the assistance of an overloaded back line to make several key tackles for Swarthmore.
Wings Sigalow and Emily Wilkins 'Ol were also indispensable in
this effort, looping fast to cover any holes in the back line.
Scrumhalf Craig struggled valiantly to get the ball out to the
backs, but too many times her Navy counterpart jumped the gun
and illegally tackled her before the ball was even out of the scrum.
After that, Swat's confidence began to slip and the players let
Navy intimidate them into hesitation. What was Navy's brand
of intimidation? Showing off what a Surface Warfare major can
really do under the cover of rucks and mauls. Not only were
punches thrown, but people were thrown too. Penalty after penalty was called until the Quakers weren't sure what game was
being played. Gotta hand it to Navy to know when to use brute
force when confusion about the simplest rules of rugby starts
getting them down.
Navy also played a heavy-handed game against Swarthmore's
B-side. Swat matched up a relatively inexperienced, yet undefeated B-side against Navy's Division II Champions and lost 24-0.
Despite being the victims of many illegal high tackles, the back
line played a tight game. Rookie Emily Rhoades 'O4 showed an
undeniable instinct for the game, making tackle after tackle.
Fullback and rookie Karly Ford 'O3 booted the ball across the
field and away from the Swat try zone. Flyhalf Kirsten Vannice
'O4 made great calls under pressure, allowing the ball to get out
past Navy's strong centers. Wing Payal Shah 'O3 made several
important tackles for the Swarthmore effort. Swat's B-Side forwards were virtually unbeatable in scrums, with hooker Erica
Anderson 'Ol stealing even Navy put-ins. Shannon McGrael 'O3
made her debutat starting B-side scrumhalf, aggressively attacking the ball and getting it out to the fly-half.
Being a mostly defensive game, much of the action occurred
in the Swarthmore try zone. Twice, forward Dani Holt-Lyman
'O3 prevented Navy from scoring in the try zone by getting her
body underneath the ball. Sometimes, Navy even prevented themselves from scoring. A stand-out moment was when a Navy player
ran past the Swat defense into the try zone and then past the try
zone into the road beyond. All in all, Swat held its own against
one of the best teams in the nation. Navy may have won the game,
but they limped off the field respecting a little Quaker school
with a lot of fight.
The women's ruggers were especially grateful to the core of
dedicated fans that traveled to Navy to support the team.
Despite the elimination from the playoffs, Swarthmore still
has a full schedule ahead, continuing against Temple on Saturday, March 31 at 11 a.m. on DuPont Field.

All is not well with my Joe. I recently read in

Badminton's status remains unclear

3H7

statement to clear
up future of team
BY ARI PORTER
In a surprise announcement late
Wednesday, President Al Bloom said the
status of the badminton team "remains
unclear." Bloom expressed hope that his
words would "finally clear up all remaining confusion and uncertainty surrounding the present and future

of badminton

at Swarthmore."
A member of the badminton team
speaking on the condition of anonymity

told The Phoenix that Bloom had pro-

posed making the team a "clarsity" team,
a new classification he intended to propose to the NCAA. The team would compete against other teams that Bloom described as "just like varsity, except not."
The team member estimated that approximately one of these teams actually
exists in the United States.
Badminton was demoted to club sport
status in the Board of Managers' December decision.

Bloom said his attempts to make small talk with badminton players at a match
last month were part of a five-year plan to help restore trust between athletes
and the administration. Badminton players said they did not notice Bloom at the
match.

Garnet prepares for decisive matches
BY MIKE NOREIKA
The men's tennis team entered theheart

host to two tough Division 111 squads. On
Saturday, March 24, Swarthmore displayed
a fearless performance through adverse
weather conditions to defeat the fourthranked team in the region, Mary Washington, 5-2. On Sunday, the Garnet fell 6-1 to
second-ranked Washington College.
Against Mary Washington, Swarthmore
took an early lead, taking two of the three
doubles matches to earn the critical doubles
point. At second doubles, Scott Grant 'Ol and
Jayson Yost 'O3 defeated an overmatched
Mary Washington duo 8-3. The doubles
point was decided at the first doubles position, where Pete Schilla 'Ol and John Thomas 'O2 outlasted their opponents 9-7 to
clinch the first team point of the contest.
With Mary Washington stunned and disheartened, Swarthmore stepped it up in the
singles play to rein in the win. At first
singles, Schilla defeated the utterly dis-

tressed Conor Smith 6-3, 6-1. With his steady
and racket-abuse-inducing play, Schilla picked
apart his close-to-tears opponent and ultimately
clinched the team victory for the Garnet. Second singles was no surprise as Thomas destroyed his Eagles opponent, Kevin Loden, 6-1,
6-2. Thomas continued his trend as one of the
toughest second singles players in the region.
Frank Visciano 'O4, playing in the No. 5
singles position, had a close first set, eventu-

ally taking it 7-5 against David Bristow. However, in the second set, Visciano elevated his
game and ran away to a 7-5, 6-2 victory, adding yet another point to the team score. At
No. 6 singles, Scott Grant 'Ol, in a match that
was much longer than it probably should have
been, endured the forty-degrees-and-falling
weather to win 7-5, 7-6 (7-3). Upon his marathon victory the senior said, "If not for the
rugby team, the match may have gone much,
much longer," referencing a rare occurrence
in the gentlemanly game of tennis. Reminiscent of the 1996 Wimbledon finals where a
streaker halted play, visiting ruggers from
Lafayette College did their naked thing, caus-

OUT OF
LEFT FIELD
While watching Roy Hobbs save the New York Knights

for Coach Pop, your blond bombshell here was swept away
by the moment of sappiness and has decided to pay a tribute
to all of those men and women who have helped us become
the athletes we are: our coaches.
I have always valued the player-coach relationship because my philosophy is: my coaches have watched, played
and coached this sport longer than I have been alive, so they
must know a whole helluva lot more about this sport than I

do.

While at times this philosophy has come into question (I
have a sneaking suspicion my high school baseball coach
had never seen a game of baseball in his life), for the most
part it has allowed me to learn an incredible amount about
sports, teamwork and myself. I hope that it at least encourages you to all think back to the coaches that you've had.
Think back to that Pop Warner football coach that first
taught you how to buckle your chinstrap, or to your Little
League coach who stuck you in right field so you wouldn't
make too many errors and lose the game for the team. Here,
in semi-chronological order, are my favorite coaches. Can't
you just feel the sappiness oozing out?
Frank: One my first ski coaches, he had the unenviable
task of trying to rein in 20 hellish little speed demons as we
wove through trees, skiers and "slow" signs. His summer
job of being a fireman came in handy on one snowy day when
I crashed into one of the signs I was trying to ski under. My
right ski, which hit one of the signposts, snapped in half
and left me stranded two miles from the base of the mountain. I picked up the halves of my ski in my mitten-covered
hands and Frank tossed me over his shoulder and skied to
the bottom.
Coach Lee: The first soccer coach I ever had, he was nice
enough to help me name the team Thundercats, after the cartoon. And although I didn't bring much in the way of"talent"
or "skills," he never complained when I would kick the ball
in the wrong goal or when I skipped practice to attend Game
Five of the 'BB World Series (damn Orel Hershiser).
Bob Brown: The first baseball coach to employ the
"Scott's dad promised me he'd be an assistant coach, so I
guess Scott has to be on my team" technique. And although
he gave my friend the start in the championship game over
me (he gave up nine runs in three innings and we lost 9-8),
he was the first coach to ever sit down and explain the game

ofbaseballtome.

Matt Croghan: My first real swimming coach. He was,
oh, maybe 5'4" and 230 lbs., but he was a good swimmer. The
first day he taught me how to swim butterfly, I thought I
was going to drown. But thanks to his watchful eye and
knowledge of CPR, I'm still here today.
Ron: Another of the Squaw Valley Ski Team's finest, Ron
had to contend with the insecurities and egos of pre-teen
hot shots. Once, in a Roy McEvoy "Tin Cup" moment, I chal-

ing a horrendous scene and inducing many
laughs from the two competing tennis teams.
In the second match of the weekend,
Swarthmore faced a tough team from Washington College. The Shoremen compete in the

Centennial Conference, while the Swarthmore
men's tennis team remains independent.
Washington has won the conference championships since the CC was founded in 1994 and
is currently ranked second in the region. They
outplayed Swarthmore, 6-1, despite admirable
effort all around from the Garnet. The lone
victor for Swarthmore was Visciano, who de-

feated his opponent at fifth singles in spite
of mildly rolling his ankle at the start of
the second set.
With thefirst of two daunting weekends
over, the Garnet now prepare for the upcoming weekend on the road, when they
face the No. 1 team in the region, Emory,
and the No. 5 team, Washington & Lee. A
Garnet trip to Nationals in May rests on
these two upcoming contests. Swarthmore
will take on Emory on Saturday, March 31,
and Washington & Lee on Sunday, April L
Washington & Lee will host both matches.

Coaches I have loved
Paying homage to the coaches who have made a difference
lenged Ron to see who could make five turns in the shortest distance. He agreed, and watched me snap off five of the
quickest turns I've ever made, ending up about five yards
below where I started. Convinced I had beaten him, I
grinned so wide my goggles pushed up onto my forehead.
Then to my amazement and disgust, Ron did five hop turns

and finished above the startingpoint. That was the last time
I ever tried to show up a coach.
Chuck Price: The man to whom I owe any success I've
ever had in baseball. Thanks to his expert tutelage and one
hell of a growth spurt, I was transformed from a mediocre
slap-hitting shortstop into a flame-throwing power hitter.
He coached me to the high-water mark of my career (.843,
17 HRs, 20 SBs, sub LOO ERA). I was 12. It's been downhill

since then.

Coach George Popadopolis: No, this wasn't Webster's
dad, nor was his name really Popadopolis, but it was some
long Greek name with lots of G's and P's. I would estimate
George to be approximately 5'2" and 205 lbs. of solid muscle
not your prototypical soccer coach (what's the deal with
all my coaches being short and squat?). Apparently the guy
was good enough to be an alternate on the Olympic team
for Greece in '92, but he decided to move to the Land of
Opportunity so that he could finally fulfill his dreams of
becoming a youth league soccer coach. His accent was so
thick I could never understand whether he wanted me to
play striker or eat more oranges at halftime, so I just
guessed. Since hisface was permanently painted with a grin
and he always patted me on the back after a game, I figure
I must have guessed correctly. Mmmm ... oranges.
Rick Simmons: This poor guy led a Babe Ruth expansion team of under-aged hooligans to an 0-18 season. If ever
I had a coach that seriously contemplated suicide, it was
Rick. I would have to guess that the low point of the season
came when we were 0-15 and leading 14-6 with two outs in
the bottom of the last inning. Our starting pitcher, Ryan
Mendoza, loaded the bases and proceeded to walk in run
after run until the score was 14-12. Rick finally decided to
bring in our right fielder, Peter Something-or-other, to try
to maintain our lead. Ryan was a little miffed by this move
and yelled, "Fuck you, Rick. I bet ten bucks Peter blows it,"
as he stormed into the dugout. Countless profane heckles
from Ryan and three consecutive walks later, Ryan was $lO
richer. Rick, if you're still alive, I'm terribly, terribly sorry
about that season.
Charlie and Scott Conrad: This father-son tandem
coached me during my final four years of soccer. I always
thought that they were incredibly kind and considerate because they would sometimes have to wait hours after practice until my mom picked me up. However, their compassion came into question when, in my third year with the
team, they doubled over in laughter when I proclaimed that
I would alter my game to become a "finesse player."

Coach P: The only coach I ever had a love-hate relationship with. My varsity football coach heckled me with "Take
Me Out to the Ball Game" as I spewed my lunch all over my
shoes during summer conditioning. He sat me during the
homecoming game against all my friends from my hometown high school (the only reason I even played football),
which brought me to tears of anger. But he didn't give up
on me, even when I had given up on him, football and myself. He got me motivated to play again. He paid me respect
for my efforts when he gave me the goal-line dive in the
championship game. And I believe he played an integral
role in helping me get into Swarthmore.
Bill Lemas: I'm pretty sure I only made his JV team as a
favor to his son, my best friend. He gave me my first taste of
what it was like to sit on the bench and watch a season of
baseball. As an FPR (Freshman Pine Rider), my duties included keeping score, chewing sunflower seeds and dodging projectile boogers from the amazingly accurate nostrils
of Gavin Wilgus. The experience of being one of Bill's FPRs,
while not a pleasant one, taught me to make the most of my
opportunities when I got them.
Frank Agovino and Mike Patrone: Swarthmore's version of the Odd Couple. Frank is the quiet and reserved head
coach. Whether we win 10-0 or lose 24-1 (yes, it happens),
there is little variation in the post-game talk. There's always something we're doing well and a lot more things we're
doing worse. The fact thathe has been able to stomach over
five seasons of Swarthmore baseball is a feat in itself, much
like chugging a gallon of milk. Mike is the in-your-face kind
of coach, the kind of guy that will take the glove offmy hand,
track down a fly ball in the gap that I would have never
gotten to, come back and say "If I can do it, you've got no
excuses." And he's right. Freshman year, I thought the
coaches hated me but were somewhat impressed. Last year,
I thought the coaches liked me but were severely disappointed. This year, the coaches and I like what we see, but
we are crossing our collective fingers and closing our eyes
as the dreaded "rebuilding process" ensues.
Mom and Dad: The only two coaches that have been with
me from start to finish. When I was a diaper-clad two-yearold, my pregnant mother would ski backwards so she could
hold my skis together in a snow plow and in high school,
she would videotape my at-bats so I could analyze every
frame of my swing. My dad used to meet me at the "Big
Tree" after racing practice so we could ski moguls together.
He wasted a tank of gas circling back in the boat to pick me
up in the water until I was finally able to get up on a single
ski, and he was always there to clean up my scrapes from
launching myself off of my mountain bike. They might not
have had the technical expertise nor the genes to turn me
into a 6'4", 220-lb. super-athlete, but they provided me with
the opportunity to find my love for sports
for which I am
forever grateful.

Why Duke will win

Men's rugby routs Lafayette
22-10 in season opener

Given: come Final Four weekend, my brackets look like
the bloodied remnants of the Psycho shower scene. This
year, at least, I was on target with two of the four remaining teams (Duke and Michigan State), though I picked Arizona and Maryland to tank in the Round of Eight. Here's
why:

DUKE: Okay. I mentioned their name. Enough said. This
team, with a legendary coach and two First Team AilAmericans, is the out-and-outfavorite to win the tournament. Why? When Jason Williams can't waltz his way into
the paint for an easy lay-up, he steps back for the three.
When Shane Battier can't connect from outside, he muscles
his way underneath for the clutch basket. When neither
is at his finest (and by that I mean when they combine for
less than 40 points), Chris Duhan steps it up. Two AilAmericans and too many weapons add up to one champi-

onship.

MICHIGAN STATE: MSU, like Duke, has one of the top
coaches in college basketball (Tom Izzo), a mature accomplished senior in Charlie Bell, and a future lottery pick in
sophomore Jason Richardson. Unlike Duke's scoring studs,
neither player is among the select group of top players in
the country. Nevertheless, MSU recorded blowouts against
North Carolina and Florida, as well as solid victories ver-

CHAMPIONSHIP.
sus Kentucky, Ohio State and Penn State. Their 10-4 record
against tournament teams suggests that they have the
stamina to qualify for the championship game. If they meet
Duke there, though, they should lose. So much for the
teams I picked.

ARIZONA: You could say that I was privileged to see
Arizona play several times this season. You could also say
that I know them well enough to know why they were lucky
to advance to the Final Four. To explain what I mean, I
needn't mention more than two words: Loren Woods. When
experts touted him as a certain lottery pick at the beginning of the year, I laughed. Loren Woods is merely the product of a failed experiment to clone Marcus Camby. Sure,
he can block shots. Sure, he's an intimidating help defender. Sure, he promises to play his hardest. It's just that
his hardest is not that good. Last game, he got outphysicaled and out-played by 6'11", pasty-white, benchwarming sensation Robert Archibald. Archibald, who averaged 6.6 ppg in limited minutes this season, embarrassed
Woods with a 25-point effort in the Midwest Regional Final. The prognosis? The Michigan State cheerleaders
should dominateWoods in the low post. Okay, okay. Woods
does have teammates. But apart from backcourt duo Gil-

bert Arenas and Jason Gardner, the teammates won't be
much help; Luke Walton, all six ppg and four rpg of him,
doesn't quite meet the standards set by his father, Hall of
Fame basketball player and annoying sports commentator Bill Walton.
MARYLAND: Truthfully, I haven't seen much of this
team apart from their three games versus Duke. What I
saw in two of the three games was a talented team (see
Juan Dixon and Lonny Baxter) that couldn't handle a
clutch situation against a more mature and seasoned Duke
squad. What I saw in the other game was a group offierce
warriors who marched into Cameron Indoor Stadium at
Duke University knowing they would hand theBlue Devils a definitive defeat. Depending on which team shows up
Saturday, Maryland could upset the favorites. However, if
my (completely speculative and inaccurate) tournament
bracket is any indication of the results of Saturday's
games, Duke and Michigan State will make it to the finals, and Duke will take home the championship.

The

men's rugby team huddle together after a 22-10 season-opening win against Lafayette

BY DAVID THOMAS
On Saturday, March 24th, the Swarthmore men's
rugby team got their spring season off to a strong start,
beating Lafayette 22-12.
Because of a referee shortage, the match began an
hour late, at 2 p.m. Despite only being out on the field
for three days before their first game, the Evil Buzzards
came out strong. After winning back possession of the
ball following the opening kick-off, the men were able
to march down the field through strong rucking and
well-placed kicks for touch off the foot of Diego Johnson
'O2. Man of the match Stephen Duvignau 'O3 scored the
first try by slicing through the Lafayette defense off a
scrum, scooting 20 meters into the try zone. Though the
Buzzards made only one mistake, it cost them when a
Lafayette flanker intercepted a pass and ran it in from
over 60 meters out.
Swarthmore kept the ball in Lafayette's defensive
end almost the entire first half, but was unable to put

any points on the board until Johnson converted a penalty into three points by putting the ball through the
uprights from 35 meters out, putting Swat up 10-7 go-

ing into the half.
The beginning of the second halfresembled the first,
with Swarthmore controlling the game. Duvignau
scored twice more, the first after a short pop-kick to
himself that carried him through the Lafayette defensive line. The second came after forwards Tim Lang

'O4 and David Thomas 'O2 bulled the ball into the try
zone, but were unable to touch it down. A penalty on
Lafayette gave Duvignau the opportunity to put the ball
in play quickly and run it in before the Lafayette defense could recover. Solid defense by the Buzzards kept

Lafayette out of the try zone, so that by the time they
scored their second try, the game was already over.
The Buzzards hope to continue their strong play this
Saturday against Albright. The game will once again be
on the DuPont field, and will start immediately following the women's B-side match, at approximately 1 p.m.
