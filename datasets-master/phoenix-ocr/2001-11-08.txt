Congressman and civil rights activist
John Lewis to give talk tomorrow
example of the depth of Lewis's
commitment to peaceful social

BY NICOLE BRUNDA

Lewis, along with the
other protestors, was trained in

Congressman John Lewis (DGa.), whom political science pro-

fessor Richard Valelly described
as "probably the most signifiant
civil rights leader still alive," will
give a collection tomorrow entitled "Civil Rights and Liberties in
America."
At the event, which will take
place in Lang Concert Hall at 1

p.m., the former civil rights
activist will give a lecture, participate in a question-and-answer
session and attend the following
reception, at which he will sign
copies of his recent memoir of the
American civil rights movement.
Lewis has been an active figure in the promotion of civil
rights and social justice in the
United States for more than 40
years, originally as one of the
forerunners of the American civil
rights movement and currently as
a Democratic congressman repreFifth
senting
Georgia's
Congressional District, which
includes all of Atlanta.
As a civil rights leader and
politician, Lewis has sought to
build a "Beloved Community" in
America, a concept from the civil
rights movement which political
science professor Richard Valelly
described as "a peaceful vision of
justice and equality achieved

through non-violence." Valelly
said Lewis was the "one person in

national politics who still has this
vision."
According to biographical
information on Lewis's congressional Web site, he grew up in a
family of sharecroppers
in
Alabama and began his quest for
social justice as a student at Fisk
University in Nashville by staging sit-ins and other forms of nonviolent protests. He became chairman of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
which helped coordinate student
protests and voter education and

peaceful response to violence. As
he led the group of 600 protestors,
he was struck in the head and

Lewis was one of the "Big Six" of
the 1960s civil rights movement.
registration projects throughout
the South.

History professor Allison
Dorsey said that SNCC, which is
pronounced "snick," was a "pivotal" group in the civil rights
movement. Dorsey, who teaches a

number of courses on AfricanAmerican history at Swarthmore,
commented that SNCC, more than
the Black Panthers or the Young
Lords, was the "group that made
the most substantial permanent
political changes," often serving
'&t the forefront of the political
battle on the streets."
"I can't imagine the black civil
rights movement without SNCC,"
Dorsey said.
Through his capacity at the
head of this organization, Lewis
was soon recognized as one of the
"Big Six," along with fellow nonviolent civil rights activist
Martin Luther King Jr., who

would work with President John

F. Kennedy to plan the "March on
Washington" in August 1963.
Lewis would go on to lead the
peaceful protest march in Selma,
Alabama that resulted in the historic "Bloody Sunday" confrontation, in which a group ofAlabama
state police charged the mass of
protestors, beating them with

clubs.
Valelly described the incident
on "Bloody Sunday" as a striking

knocked unconscious.
The events of "Bloody Sunday"
and a march from Selma to
Montgomery generated a great
deal of publicity for the civil
rights movement. This would
later induce President Lyndon
Johnson to support the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, which suspended literacy tests for voting in

some areas and allowed for the
appointment of federal examiners
who would register black voters.
From a historical perspective,
Dorsey said, the events of "Bloody
Sunday" were "critical moment of
galvanizing public consciousness
about the need for the evils of
racial segregation to end."
Lewis left SNCC in 1966 and
went on to hold a variety of positions in voter registration, eventually becoming the director of
the Voter Education Project,
which, during his tenure, helped
to register four million minority
voters. President Carter appointed Lewis to head ACTION, the
United States's federal volunteer
agency, in 1977.

For his work in the civil rights
movement and commitment to

non-violence, Lewis was honored
with several prestigious awards,
including the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize,
the John F. Kennedy Profile in
Courage Award for Lifetime
Achievement and the Moral
Courage Award.
Many scholars also recognize
him as an important figure in the
civil rights movement.
"He is probably the most significant civil rights leader still
alive," Valelly said.

Swarthmore voters reaffirmed their willingness to continue with

Elric "Eck" Gerner, a current Republican borough council member, was elected mayor. Democrats Tom Huestis, Ken Klothen and
incumbent Lisa Aaron and Republican Alice "Putty" Willetts were
elected to the seven-seat council.
Town officials are not sure who will replace Gerner for the
remainder of his term on the council when he becomes mayor.
"The biggest debate in this year's election was how much the
town should change," said current council vice-president Ann K.
Seidman, who chose not to run for re-election this year. "There's a
level of distrust regarding the changes the college has put forward,
which I don't quite understand or share. But the elections are really not that much about policy; they're really about who is most qualified to make decisions."
Candidates generally agreed on local environmental and public
safety issues, including the undesirability of a curfew, and most
stressed the importance of improving town-college relations. Most
candidates expressed their qualified support of some kind of inn or
hotel.
The Democratic campaign position paper stated that any new
developments must "be of a scale and type suitable for their location
and compatible with their surroundings, and in the best interests of
the borough as a whole."
Republican incumbent Willetts, a more conservative voice on the
council, stated in a position paper, "I am now and always have been
in favor of a small inn and dining room appropriate to the size and
architecture of our town."

Council and deans plan to size up disabilities services
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

requesting

Approximately 40 Swarthmore
students have some type of documented disability. Although
administrative statistics show
this number is relatively small in
relation to the entire student
body, it reflects an upward trend
over the past five years. While the
school offers disability services,
some members of the community
are questioning the effectiveness
of the current accommodations.
Right now, a formal review is
still in the planning stages. Three
student council members believe
that although Myrt Westphal, the

on campus should receive this letter, and Westphal ensures that
they receive a copy of the letter
and understand its ramifications.
After that, she explained, it is up
to the student to make sure every-

"Right now, we
meet the requirements of the ADA,
but I think we could
be doing more."
Ryan Budish 'O4
coordinator of disabilities services, is doing a good job, it is time
for the college to fulfill its disabilities obligations beyond what is
required by law. Council co-presidents Lauren Tobias 'O2 and Anna

Woodiwiss 'O2 and campus life
representative Ryan Budish 'O4,
who is hearing impaired himself,
think it is time to encourage a
review of the school's disabilities
services. Westphal is the only person who addresses the concerns of
students with disabilities, and
this constitutes only ten percent
of her job, a large part of which is
spent in her capacity as director
of residential life.
Current accommodations
Americans
The
with
Disabilities Act requires the college not to discriminate against
people with disabilities. In order
to ensure that the school conforms to these legal standards,
numerous measures are in place.
There is a specific procedure
for accommodating students with
disabilities, Westphal said. First,
she said, a student with any type
of disability physical, learning,
must
psychological or medical
submit a letter to her detailing
the disability.
"I need documentation from
the student about what the diagnosis was, what the limits of the student are based on this diagnosis,

what the student should do and

what the recommended accommodations are," Westphal said.
Once she has this document,
Westphal keeps a copy and usual-

ly sends one to Worth Health

Center as well.
After an administrative review,
she sits down with the student to

discuss possible accommodations.
"During this discussion," she said,
"the student and I talk about the
situation at the college, and we

talk about the accommodations
that are requested and those that

the college can actually give."

After Westphal and the student

thing goes smoothly.
For example, a student with a
learning disability may require
more time on a test. Westphal will
send this recommendation to the
student's professors. The student,
however, must then meet with his
or her professors to arrange a special time and place for the student
to take the test.
"In these cases, college and
high school really differ in their
approaches," Westphal said.
"In high school, it's up to the
school to diagnose the disability
and provide accommodations,
while in college, the student must
put in the request and provide
backup documentation in order to
ensure accommodations," she said.
Westphal also explained some

"None of this should be read
poorly on Myrt,"
Woodiwiss said. "Disabilities are
only ten percent of her time. If
she's overworked, we would like
to look into the possibility of
bringing in someone to help her
so that she doesn't fall even more
under the work load."
"Myrt's doing a great job as

coordinator, but she's constrained
by all the other jobs she has,"

Budish said. "The number of disabled students has more than doubled since she's come here, so her
workload in disabilities has
grown. But she also has so much
more to do here in her other jobs."
What disabled students think
Although the council definitely plans to conduct a review,
views are split among students as
to whether disabilities services
need improvement.
Some students agree with the

"As I grew more comfortable
with Swarthmore, I eventually
preferred to handle things on my
own," she said. "If I had asked
them to do more, I'm sure they
would have been very accommo-

dating."

Gilbride feels that changing
the system and making it more
uniform would be detrimental to
the students.
"My only concern is that
things would get to be too inflexible," she said. "Making it too
standardized does not allow for a
varying degree of attention
based on the needs of the individual student." she said.

On the other side of this

debate is Kira Alvarez 'O4, who is
epileptic. Although Alvarez feels
that Westphal has handled her
case very well, she thinks that
there is clear room for improvement in disability services.

of physical accessibility," she
said. "Using its budget every year,
the college chips away at certain
aspects of the barriers posed to
those with physical handicaps."

Reevaluating current services
Recently, Student Council has

a review of the
disabilities services.
Over the next few weeks, the
council aims to launch a formal
review of the disabilities services.
The main thrust behind their
review will be to establish a
stronger sense of what disability
services need to be improved.
"At this stage, we're concerned
primarily with investigating the
advocating

college's

resources currently available,"

Tobias said.
"We've identified that there is
lots of room for improvement.
We're looking into what can be
improved, what our priorities are
and how we can go about improving them."

The council's most pressing
concern, members said, was the
fact that so little of the college's
time, in only 10 percent of one
dean's job, is spent on disabilities
issues.
"If we can get this review
started up and goingby the end of
the semester," Woodiwiss said, "it
will be a big step toward improving our disabilities services here
at Swarthmore."
In their initial proceedings,

council members maintained
that they are looking at these
services merely to establish ways
to improve them; they stress that
the purpose of a review would
not be to attack Westphal.

revamp the program," she said.

"Someone experienced with the
Americans with Disabilities Act
and with handling students with
disabilitieswill know how to treat
each student and will know to
give advice to students on an individual basis."
Objectives of the review
The council members involved
hope their review will lead to
widespread changes in the way in
which the college deals with students who have disabilities.
Budish explained that one of the
main goals behind the review is to
make the college seem friendlier

toward students with disabilities.
"Right now, we meet the
requirements of the ADA, but I
think we could be doing more," he
said.
"I think it's worth it to look
into how our disabilities services
are organized, how it's structured
and what we expect the disabilities coordinator to do."
With a review still in the first
stages, the council members are
keeping a very open mind about
examining and improving all
aspects of disabilities services. So
far, the council, Dean of the

College Bob Gross and Westphal
are considering how to go about
the review.
One solution is to bring in an
outsider to completely evaluate
the college's handling of disabilities. The other proposal, Budish
said, would be to form a committee consisting of students and
staff. Council members favor a
committee over an outside source.
"I think a committee working
on a disability review would be
able to approach the issue from as
broadly as possible and from all
views," Woodiwiss said.
In the end, Student Council
thinks the least they could
accomplish is to increase communication between the administration and students with disabilities. "The goal is to make the
campus more livable for people
who have specific needs and to
make it more inviting for that
particular group of people,"

College limits bandwidth of Internet file sharing programs
Peer-to-peer

programs like Napster, Hotline placed last on college's priority list; students asked to disable Internet file sharing

BY IVAN BOOTHE
Users of file sharing applications like Napster, Hotline and
Gnutella will soon find their
transfer speeds strictly regulated
by the college.
In a reserved-students e-mail
Marc
afternoon,
Wednesday
Dumic, manager of networking

and systems, announced the col-

lege would be implementing a
new bandwidth shaper which
would severely limit the speed of

peer-to-peer comptuer programs.
"All peer-to-peer traffic will be
segregated and given a low priority," Dumic wrote, and "a limit of
5 [megabits per second] in each
direction will be imposed on the
total amount of peer-to-peer traf-

fic."

Practically,

this means that

students who use music and file
sharing systems will experience
far slower network speeds than
before.
Dumic wrote that the change
was necessary in order to maintain reasonable speeds for academic uses of the Internet on campus. Seventy-five to eighty percent of Internet traffic, Dumic
wrote, stemmed from the use of
file sharing systems.

The goal of Information
Technology Services, the department which oversees the campus
computer network, was to provide at least 256 kilobits per second for every student, faculty and
staff member.
Kim Tu 'O2 agrees with the col-

lege's new policy. "Academic use
is a priority," she said, "because I
have been frustrated in the

library before" by the network's
slowness. She suggested, however, that the college restrict the file
sharing only during the day.
"Maybe at night they could take
the cap away," she said.

Dumic, however, feels that the
restriction is necessary all the
time. "Our outgoing bandwidth
now tops off 24 hours a day at our

limit of 10 Mbps," he wrote. "Our
which
incoming bandwidth,
rarely reached 10 Mbps last
Spring, now tops off at 10 Mbps
for most of the day."
Frederick Heckel 'O5 also
agreed with the restrictions. "I
think it's probably a good idea,
because that sort of thing does
take up so much bandwidth," he
said. "It can really cramp a network."
Essentially, the shaper limits

the traffic on the ports to which
peer-to-peer programs are set by
default. Thus, students could circumvent the system by changing
the ports their program uses.

Dumic acknowledged this possibility, and wrote the college was
"appealing to everyone in the
Swarthmore community not to
attempt this." He added that if a
person did attempt to get around
the system, "we will take appropriate actions to eliminate
infringing traffic."
"I'm sure people will find a
way to get around it," Tu said.
Dumic also asked students to
disable their online file sharing
and to limit their own downloads
to two or three files at a time.
"I wonder if as many people
who are running [file sharing]
realize just how much bandwidth

is being taken up by people downloading things from their comput-

er," Heckel said. "It would be real-

ly easy to cut down on outgoing
bandwidth by not letting people
download from your computer."
The policy of specifically limiting particular types of programs
is a significant policy change for
the college. In the Oct. 5, 2000
issue of The Phoenix, Judy
director
of
ITS,
Downing,
explained that such a policy
would be in conflict with the spirit of the college. "It's just not the
things
way
we
do
at

Swarthmore," she said.
Dumic stressed in his e-mail
that "this new policy, like previous ones, is an experiement in
balancing the variety of needs
and interests associated with
Internet access."

SMART sponsors Sexual
Misconduct Awareness Week
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER

The Sexual Misconduct Advisers
and Resource Team (SMART) is sponsoring Sexual Misconduct Awareness

Emily

Week, which ends tomorrow.
"The purpose of the week is to
raise awareness of how prevalent
sexual assault is and to combat the
myth that Swarthmore is a totally
safe place where this sort of thing
never happens," Mara Gustafson 'O3,
a SMART member, said.
A secondary purpose of the week
is to raise awareness about SMART
itself.
Although "our main purpose is to
serve as crisis counseling for anyone
who has experienced sexual assault
either on or off campus," said
Caroline Celano 'O3, also a SMART
member, "we also run a student-facilitated survivors group."
SMART has fourteen members
including faculty, staff and students.
They have all been trained to deal
with sexual misconduct.
The week coincides with the start
of the safety whistle project, which is
Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff sposored by SMART* the Deans'
Office, the WRC and the Feminist

The WRC gave out safety whistles as part of SMART'S Sexual Misconduct Awareness Week.

Majority.

The whistles are intended to provide a recognizable signal of alarm,
alerting others to call public safety or
otherwise provide assistance. They
will be available to all students."We
want men to have them," as well as
women, Celano stressed.
SMART will host a dinner and discussion from 6 to 8 p.m. tomorrow
night in Kohlberg 228, where the
group will show movie clips involving sexual assault and talk about
them.

There will be a $5O fine for the
misuse of the whistles.
For those anxious to hear their

sound, there will be a gathering
tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. on Parrish
beach to make one collective blast.
Students may also blow their whistles from elsewhere on campus.
In conjunction with the distribu-

tion of whistles, SMART will be
handing out pamphlets with information about sexual assault in Sharpies
and Parrish.

Van shuttles return College Republicans plan rally for Veterans' Day
to student drivers
BY CATHY OANH

BY BENJAMIN KABAK
After two months of mounting complaints against professional drivers, Student Council and the administration hope to
return the responsibilities of the college's van shuttle system to
students. The shuttle vans aim to provide students with safe and
reliable means of transportation from the center of campus to
more distant locations. Throughout the year, however, students
have complained of unreliable services and ineffective drivers.
Due to these complaints, the school is moving to restore the student drivers.
"In general, using professional drivers has not worked
smoothly," Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave said.
"Frequently, the bus gets off schedule, or the driver doesn't know
where to go. This is a service that really needs to run according
to plan."

The shuttle vans currently run from 5 p.m. until 3:30 a.m,
Redgrave said. The vans are supposed to take a route that runs
from McCabe to Mary Lyon with stops in between at PPR.
Additionally, the vans take students to and from the ville; "the
barn," a private student residence; and Woolman.
After multiple complaints addressed to public safety and
Student Council, the college decided to launch an effort to return
to methods that had worked in previous years.
"The decision to revert back to the old way came as a result
from multiple e-mails to Owen [Redgrave] and the SC," council
co-president Lauren Tobias 'O2 said, "in which they expressed
frustration at the fact that the system this year was more unreliable than it had been in the past when students were driving the

shuttles."
Over the next few months, Redgrave and council members
will look into finding students to coordinate the schedule. The
biggest issue facing the school is ensuring full student participation.
"No one knows right now how to go about attracting students
to make this run," Redgrave said. "Whether we switch back to
student drivers is contingent on getting all the shifts filled. There
is a definite concern that we will not be able to staff the vans with
students until 3:30 in the morning."
Public safety has not yet set a date for the return to student
drivers. In the meantime, it is urging students to take advantage
of the escort service if there are van delays.
"If there is a problem with the shuttle, a student can always
call public safety," council co-president Anna Woodiwiss 'O2.
"An officer will come and pick him or her up within 10 to 15
minutes and drive the student to his or her dorm. The officers
are always friendly and do not have a problem taking a student
to any destination."

Bad boys
This week, a Phoenix investigation into the relationship that the Swarthmore borough police has with students showed that, contrary to many students' opinions,
the police are not out to get the college students. The
police swear to uphold the law, meaning that they have no
choice but to issue citations for underage drinking at
times, but citing students is not their goal. If that were the

could issue hundreds of citations each week.
Instead, the police want to protect the safety of all
Swarthmore residents, especially college students who may
have had too much to drink. They use discretion, far more
than most students may realize, allowing many to break
the law while trying to make sure that no one gets hurt.
In almost all cases, police will only issue a citation for
underage drinking when they have no other choice. As
long as college students use some discretion, they can
generally avoid being cited. During the night on which
our reporter rode with the police, the night of the Mary
Lyon Halloween party, no one was cited, despite the fact
that many underage Swatties were drinking.
Although it seems that police presence on campus is
not problematic for those who are cautious, police presence in Worth Health Center is.
Health center workers advise students to have a friend
drive them to the hospital, but most underclassmen don't
have those kinds of social connections, and are doubly at
risk for alcohol poisoning.
Although police should
and must, by policy
respond to ambulance calls, issuing citations to those
who make the right decision by seeking medical attention
for someone who's sick is not a good idea. It sets a dangerous precedent when students are afraid to go to Worth
with someone who is truly in medical danger because
they don't want to get into trouble with the police.
case, they

According to Dean Tedd Goundie's interpretation of the
Student Handbook, in cases of alcohol-related incidents, if
students seek help at Worth, their visit will not be used
as evidence against them. A long-term plan for ensuring
the Worth's status as a "safe space" should be an important concern in the relationship between the college and
the Swarthmore police.
As health center director Linda Echols told The
Phoenix, if someone is left alone passed out in their
room, they could easily aspirate and die. Surely it's better
to risk a citation than it is to risk a life.
Although this seems to be a rare occurrence that
police would issue citations in Worth, and it is good to
know that the deans and public safety were likewise concerned, police would do well to avoid such actions.
In the end, what is important is that students and the
borough police strive to maintain a good relationship,
and avoid antagonizing or misunderstanding each other.

Web reworkings
Six leaves have been the symbols linking Swarthmore
of the world via the Internet for too long. We
were glad to hear that, come Monday, we will move
beyond these leaves with a new Web page. Five years ago,
the college's Web site was not very important, but as the
Internet's importance has grown, so too has the importance of having a navigable and attractive Web site.
Increasingly, the Internet provides prospective college
students with a window onto college life. In fact, for many
students, a trip to Swarthmore is not possible before college applications are due, so our Web site is our only
chance to influence these students. Therefore, our Web
site must communicate to prospective students, meaning
that it must be navigable and must give them a sense of
the college.
Some current students remember the difficulties they
faced in learning about student organizations at
Swarthmore before they arrived on campus. There is no

the new college Web site. Also, many student group pages

college and easier to navigate and use for first-time visitors as well as those who use it every day.

Swarthmore's shame: unemotional wartime reactions inappropriate
Dear Editor:

Having read last week's article "A college at war," one
cannot help but contrast the reactions of two different
Swarthmore generations to their respective days of
infamy. In 1941, the aggressor was Imperial Japan, and
Swatties faced her deceptive attack with "a mixture of
tears, hushed speculation, and indignation." Now, we face
a new form of evil, perhaps even more dangerous than
that before. Alas, the manner in which today's
Swarthmore has responded reeks of lost honor, commitment and sensitivity.
The anger and grief so prevalent in 1941 are sadly lacking on today's campus. (Excluding, of course, those personally affected by the attacks, myself included.) While
such emotions should certainly be controlled, they should
exist as evidence of our humanity. The reaction an earthquake in South Asia or the hate-killing of a homosexual in
Wyoming will generate on this campus is striking. But the
bloodiest act of violence perhaps ever perpetuated against

Americans draws forth no rallies, no generous donations.
One student in my political science seminar offered

forth the following rationale. America is, after all, an enormous and diverse country. Arguably, as many as four or
five nations rolled into one. Hailing from the Midwest, he
explained, he just did not feel that personal connection to
New York or Washington that would make the Sept. 11
attacks more real. Yes, it was horrible what happened, he
agreed. And he felt for the victims and their loved ones.
But, as stated, he just did not feel that personal touch.
Nine hundred dollars. That was the statement this student body made to the 9-11 relief effort. Or, roughly translated, about 65 cents per student. It was the first phase of
the college's big "F-you" to the victims and their families.
In the last few weeks though, the atmosphere on campus has changed. We have had rallies and moments of
silence and donations in abundance! But, oh yes, that's
right. These only found their way here after America
began her counterattacks against the terrorists.

Fascinating. The slaughter of nearly 5,000 people less than
two hours away yields silence and inactivity. But the
bombing of a few tents thousands ofmiles away stimulates
such fervor. One student was moved to go on a "hunger

strike"!
Almost as an afterthought, the organizers of these
recent movements point out that their sympathies lie with
the victims of war here too, as well as abroad. Very cute,
yes. The point remains: Swatties had several weeks
between Sept. 11 and the start of the current air war to
express their solidarity with the victims. Where were the
rallies in their name? The new student groups? The sacrifices? The sympathy? Why only now? Or is it that Swatties
feel some greater personal connection to Afghanistan?
Yes. I charge many of us here on campus with disgraceful insensitivity to our own citizens. Some others on
campus are guilty of even more: forgetting who they are.
The last I checked, Osama bin Laden was not after stockbrokers from New York or soldiers from Washington. He
is after us all. And God forbid you need a personal experience before that sets in. To those of you who think I'm
offensive, I won't apologize. My culminating personal
experience was watching a 3-year-old girl ask her mother
when daddy's coming home from heaven.

Valuing relationships
that break all the rules
BY YEHONATHAN BRODSKI

It's funny how home becomes a place you visit, not live in, after you
start college. I love my parents, but I always find that I'm as excited to
come home as I am to say goodbye when I leave. Maybe it's about letting
myself search for new rules instead of allowing old rules to define me.
My mother always used the Yiddish expression, "Sure, a bird and a fish
can get married, but where would they live?" I guess she thought that a
bird can't run away from home, because he can only survive in his element. But I did run away, and I ended up 3000 miles east. This story is a
cute ditty about growing up and the people who really guide us along:
We met in the Swarthmore Asian Organization room
the
Intercultural Center was where we called home. Her name was Zenzile
and she sat next to the window, and I remember it as if it were a photograph because I thought her glasses made her look more like a J. Crew
model than the tough black girl who grew up in Brooklyn.
It was her speech that was different. Her grandmother had owned a
political magazine in the 60s, so Zenzile had gone to etiquette schools for
the occasional $lO,OOO per person Congress dinners, but she didn't show
it off when she spoke; even Swarthmore didn't dictate what came out of
her mouth. I still remember her complaining about that student who

wouldn't stop "harassing" her in the pasta bar at Sharpies that day
"He has pussy written all over his forehead." I wrote it down in my journal —1012.98.
I can't imagine what it is like to be black, just like I can't imagine
what it's like not to come from a Jewish orthodox family. But I remember the story about the dinner in her grandma's place in Martha's
Vineyard, about that dress her grandmother had ordered her to wear,
and I felt it was Yoni who she described, the Yoni who ran away from
home at 11 only to return six hours later because he had no batteries for
his walkman. I understood the girl who wanted to wear that velvet dress
others had said was inappropriate
it was summer. And I understood

New patriotism leaves no room for dissent
BY ALLAN FRIEDMAN
Is this a great country or
what? I think most people around
these parts would agree that, all
in all, it's not that bad.
All this flag waving for the
past eight weeks has made folks
on the left like me a little nervous. Since the 60s, patriotism has
"belonged" to the right. It's been
associated with a "my country,
right or wrong," mentality that
appears to verge on jingoism all
too often. The same star spangled
banner that represents the freedom for which so many have
fought and died has also served
as a screen to front for protec-

tionism (often racially motivated), neocolonialism, the silencing
of dissent and general enthusiasm for a political agenda.
People take the flag so serious-

ly that they've been trying to pass
an amendment to the constitution to ban any attempts to deface
it. Of course, many of these are
the same people flying stars and
stripes from their radio antennae
that look like they've just been
through a rather violent beachhead assault and leave their flags
out in the rain
all big no-nos in
the flag rules book, wherever that
happens to be. But the book was
under the old rules.
This old form of patriotism is
supposed to be different from this
newfound love of country we all
seem to have experienced in the
wake of Sept. 1L
Unfortunately, it carries a lot
of emotional baggage with it, and
it isn't altogether clear whether
things are truly different now.

Liberals are being handed a
rather unfair dichotomy: we can
either question current actions
or express our love for our country. What's a good liberal to do?
Shall we begin each political commentary with "this-is-a-greatcountry-but... 7*

Now some on the left are tak-

ing it a bit too far, such as the
chair of the Maine Green Party
who is convinced that she was
denied permission to board her
flight because the Maine National
Guard sought her out as a potential terrorist.
Those who believe that the
rest of the country cares too
much about them aside, there's
been a notable lull in any kind of
national dialogue about how we
as a country a great big strong
country, of course
should best

proceed.
In the absence of this dialogue, those in power have been
busy defining patriotism on their

own.

First we have the USA Act,
which snips a few biggies off our
list of civil rights. Remember,
those things that make our country great? Government agents
can now collect undefined new
information about your e-mail
and web browsing, or anything
from any permanent record, such
as medical, educational or financial records without any meaningful judicial review. Or perhaps
you were unaware that the government can now enter your
house or office with a search warrant while you are away, search
and even seize your property, but
not inform you until days or even

weeks later. This last item was

rejected by past congresses,

but
under the auspices of patriotism,
it's acceptable.
Meanwhile, the large corporate lobbies and their congressional friends have been equally
patriotic. The $25 billion stimulus
package doesn't seem pointed at
helping Sally Unemployed or
Mom & Pop Inc. who one might
imagine are the hardest hit.
Instead, it's a retroactive tax cut
(how retroactive? 1986, before
Bush I was in command) that
hands huge chunks of cash to
large corporations, primarily in
energy and mining companies.
Yet a refinery that was unprofitable to keep open before the
package will remain equally
unprofitable after the package
and thus will get shut down anyway, since the GOP shot down
god forbid tie
any attempt to
strings to those taxpayer dollars.
That wouldn't be patriotic.
Oh, and this great land of
ours, the purple mountain's
majesty that everyone's been
singing about recently?

Mining companies not only no
longer have to pay for those publicly owned purple mountains,

but the Department of the
Interior can't even forbid them
from starting new projects.
Pride in country is one thing.
But if more people don't start
questioning what's behind this
new wave of patriotism, I'm not
sure where we'll find ourselves.
Oh, and one more thing: No
true patriot would dare criticize
the current military action. So
just don't even think about it.

Hunt brought campus together in divisive time

Warders of Imaginative Literature for organizing

Say your piece,
but peacefully
BY TED CHAN
I hoped I'd never have to use the words "politics" and "rhetoric" in
an article, but here goes nothing. The fact is the last few weeks' happenings on campus have revealed a great deal about the nature ofrhetoric, reaction-formation and schism in campus issues. If the interest
of student groups and activists at Swarthmore is to successfully promote their views, or make the campus a more comfortable place for
their beliefs or lifestyle, then the reaction of others on campus is
something they must take into account when constructing their campaigns.
Let us start with the SQU chalkings a few weeks ago. Those who got
upset
or ridiculously upset, as we saw
about the chalkings obviously took them out of context. If you're stupid enough to come on to
your roommate because you saw it in pink calcium carbonate on your
way to Sharpies, then I don't know what to say to you. More likely the
chalkings were geared to invade the space of straight folk and illustrate some of the pervading discomfort that heterosexist and homophobic discourse places upon queer people each and every day.
For some, it worked. There were many warm, positive conversa-

The Career Planning and Placement office has
a secret weapon that should not be a secret
weapon, at least not unto the office.
It should be a secret weapon possessed by all
members of the Swarthmore student community.
And the only thmg needed to make it ours is a little motivation and a tad of personal insight. It's
amazing, really, that all we need to do to acquire
this secret weapon is walk into the office and tell
whoever happens to be manning the station that
we'd like an alumni list. Answer two questions
and, bam, it's in your hands: the secret weapon,
the Incredible Networking Device. What occupation? What location?
They type the appropriate codes into their
computers and, in five short minutes, the printer
spews a list whose size depends on the narrowness of your occupational or regional search, and
then you've got the key: addresses, phone numbers, the links to people who, on graduating, made
something of themselves and can help you do the

same.

And they're surprisingly eager to assist, at

least in my experience. I recently wrote letters to

over 25 area alums, requesting assistance landing
the summer.
While my responses have been limited in number,
they've been astounding in their magnitude. The
alums who responded to my appeal have been
incredibly helpful, going out of their way to contact people they know who know people who can
get me an ace internship
and just having their
names, backed by prestige and experience other
than my own semi-qualifying unfinished undergraduate existence at Swat, makes an incredible
difference.
Establishing contacts is a wise maneuver,

even if you don't really know what you want to do
when you grow up, spread your wings and fly
away from Swarthmore. At least in my experience, it's having these contacts, these connections
with people who will back you simply because of

the shared membership of this academic community, that ultimately gets you where you need to
be. And it simplifies the process a whole lot.
Knowing someone in the field who can pull
strings for you knocks down immediate hurdles,
thrusting you directly into the meat of the competition, the true stuff of obtaining a desirable position. Rather than flounder around on your own,
confidently touting your achievements, academic
and otherwise, just like every other applicant,
you've automatically drawn attention to yourself,
simply by including a recognizable name in your
application.
One request, two questions, one name added to
your own, hardly any energy expended on your
part and you're already elevated above the masses, already a more desirable candidate because
of what's in a name.

need of recommendations from established professionals, or simply interested in exploring the
options in a particular field, take advantage of
this remarkable resource: the Incredible
Networking Device and the alumni lists it produces. Take advantage of the fact that other people have been in your shoes, have struggled
through these classes and know what it's like,
essentially, to be you. Sympathetic, successful
alums are a major institutional perk. Or, if you're
uncomfortable personally contacting alums,
attend one of CP&P's many info sessions on

externships and working with alums.

It could mean the difference between another

boring summer spent salting fries at your local
Burger Shack and utilizing your time off from
classes to effectively bolster your resume and
simultaneously enjoy interesting, stimulating
work that may even help you decide what you
want to be when you grow up.

Groups must consider where the opposing

other distance to a certain degree.
tions opened as a result of the chalkings. The problem was, there were
just as many angry reactions. Some openly said they wanted to hurt a
gay person, while others screamed, yelled and cried about it, and still
others scrawled homophobic remarks and crass cartoons on flyers.
SQU's campaign was effective if Coming Out Week was meant to
make their presence felt. If it was about improving the life of campus
queers and making this a more comfortable environment for them,
then SQU unequivocally failed.
No matter what the leaders might want to tell you, there are a large
number of campus queers who felt much more uncomfortable after
Coming Out Week.
If you were coming out, would you want to do it in an environment
where all the homophobes had felt a virtual call to arms, as some
actions indicated?
Now, the Why War? campaign and Pub Nite fiasco also illustrate
the problematic nature of campus politics. A significant number of
Pub Nite frequenters are not in fact, anti-war. In fact, a great number
are in favor of the military campaign. Certainly, many of the fairly
small pro-war faction on campus are Pub Nite frequenters. The reaction to the planned Why War? Pub Nite was mostly negative. Both the
senior class officers and Why War? were trashed in public forums, in
Sharpies and on practice fields.
Both groups decided to go into spin control, so who knows how the
event might have turned out had the outcry not been heard. In a sense,
this is another case of a campus group not everyone is comfortable
with invading a space considered private. After all, Pub Nite has a certain aura of sanctity to it. People actually get pissed off when you have
Gabe Fairman Trivia Night or Why War? Night because that's simply
not how Thursday nights are conceptualized. They're about relaxing,
getting drunk and talking to your friends while ignoring many of the
items that in excessive quantity can be rather annoying, such as globalization, Dann Naseemullah's columns and non-issues.
These are two recent, rather salient examples of the problems of
getting anything done politically on this campus.
Groups must consider where the opposing point of view will be
found, and give each other distance to a certain degree, otherwise, the
feedback received will do more damage than any successes caused by
the dissemination of the intended message. Reaction-formations are
all too easy here. Dann makes some great points about globalization,
SQU and Why War? have many points to make worthy of consideration by all, but harp on it all too much or make people uncomfortable
about it, and you will get the inevitable, "Screw Pakistan, fuck fags
and nuke Afghanistan" from someone.
While most of us are mature enough to ignore those extreme,
obscene views, they can also make the environment very uncomfortable for those who have to live within those spaces, especially when
the issue is sexual orientation.
In the hearts and minds of many Swarthmore students, the memory of large college protests and extreme acts for the love of liberalism
rings loud and true. Yet the fact remains: if you really want to make
social gains at Swarthmore, a tempered campaign focused on campus
moderates is probably the best solution. It may not be spectacular, but
recent events reveal that trying to make a bang results in a hangover
for the groups involved.

The Price of Liberty

Anthrax isn't the problem
This summer, I was an intern at the governor's office in
Massachusetts. One of our duties was opening and sorting the
governor's mail every morning. Sometimes we'd get weirdlooking packages or letters without return addresses. We had
a little ritual for these. Before opening them, we'd turn to the
nearest intern and say "If this blows up, I want you to avenge
my death."
Letter-bomb jokes seem a lot less funny when terrorists
are actually killing office workers and postmen. If I was still
the official mail boy for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
I imagine I'd be pretty spooked right about now. But as is, I'm
a lot more worried by upcoming quizzes than by biological
weapons. I'm not afraid of anthrax, and the vast majority of
Americans shouldn't be either.
Compared to bombs or smallpox or hijacked planes,
anthrax is not a very good weapon. It's not contagious. It's not
particularly virulent. The only people who have caught the
more dangerous inhalation form of the disease are relatively
old, possibly indicating that younger people with stronger
immune systems are capable of fighting it off. And it's not
easy to use in mass attacks. In 1993, the Japanese doomsday
cult Aum Shinrikyo sprayed anthrax from a Tokyo rooftop for
24 hours straight without actually infecting anyone.
It doesn't even seem that these terrorists have high-quality anthrax. The fact that they've restricted themselves to
sending poisoned letters, the least effective means of distributing a bioweapon short of rubbing it on people with Q-tips,
shows that their strain is probably not suitable for use in
large-scale attacks. That means that in order to be infected,
you or your workplace has to be singled out as a valuable target.
Anti-American zealots might not be the most rational folks
on the planet, but they're canny enough to know that
Swarthmore is a lousy place to send anthrax. We don't have a
lot of symbolic value to the nation, like the World Trade
Center. We aren't a strategic target, like Congress or the mass
media. Heck, if they send anthrax here, the odds are good that
they'll kill someone who just wants to "open up a dialogue."
Any terrorist worth his salt can probably realize that a germ
attack on a sleepy little Quaker school would be a waste of
postage.
And what's true for Swarthmore students is true for most
Americans. Most people seem to recognize this. A recent
Gallup poll showed that only about one in five Americans fear
that they are at high risk of anthrax exposure. But that irrational minority could get the rest of the country in big trouble.
Sales of Cipro, the anti-anthrax drug that's gotten the most
media attention, have been skyrocketing. From Sept. 7 to Oct.
12, there was a 49 percent increase in Cipro retail sales, representing about 120,000 new prescriptions. Some people are
even urging the government to break Bayer's patent so that
more Americans will be able to pre-medicate themselves.
Ordinarily, I don't worry too much about people who harbor irrational fears. If my neighbor thinks that he's been
spied on by elves or my friend believes that cigarettes contain
vitamins, it's no skin off my nose. But these hypochondriacs
are a menace to us all. They're consuming health resources
by making themselves sick with Cipro's side effects, which
include dizziness, seizures and severe diarrhea. They're wasting drugs which might be needed in the unlikely event of a
large-scale attack. And worst of all, they're contributing to
new epidemics.
Many common antibiotics, including Cipro, create an evolutionary pressure that encourages the development of drugresistant bacteria strains. When people who have compromised immune systems get sick with one of these super
germs, it's a lot harder to treat them. By gulping drugs indiscriminately, panicky Americans are making their own bodies
into biological warfare laboratories.
This was already a major public health problem before

Sept. 1L The average Joe doesn't know anything about drugresistant bacteria, he just wants the doctor to give him something that will make him feel better. And the average doctor
finds it easier to scribble out a prescription rather than
explain all this to his cranky, feverish patients. As a result of
this overmedication, a lot of nasty diseases are beginning to
pop up in even deadlier forms. And now that thousands of
healthy people are taking one of the most potent antibiotics

on the market, the situation's sure to get even worse. Being
afraid is permissible, but endangering others is not.

Defense of women not a motive for war
Finally, mainstream media pay attention to plight of Afghan women
BY MAYA SCHENWAR
Sunday morning I found a touching photo essay in the online ver-

sion of The New York Times.
Entitled "Allure Must Be Covered,
Individuality Peeks Through," the
photos depicted Afghan women in
traditional head coverings, together with the commentary that the
Taliban's dress code "erases not just
[a woman's] allure, but her individ-

uality."

On a subsequent page, I discovered a story entitled, "Living in a
World Without Women," informing
me that, "Afghanistan has shown a
world of Muslim women just how

bad things can get."
Since the bombings began, the
American media just can't seem to
get enough of Afghan women. Most
major newspapers have run pullout
sections on Afghanistan's women's
rights violations. CNN did a special
last month.
Conservative Fox News host
Sean Hannity lauded a guest from
the Feminist Majority, saying, "I
think it's important that the world
understand what exactly it is that
we are struggling with and battling
here in Afghanistan." Even my
Aunt Rosalie, offering a "feminist"
motive for war, informed me that
"women
in Afghanistan are
oppressed" and it is our duty to
defend them.
This is great. It's great that
women's oppression and exploitation are finally being publicized by
Amnesty
someone
beside
International and the Feminist
Majority. It's great that people like

The Chicago Tribune,
CNN and Aunt Rosalie
should be applauded

feminism.
Aunt Rosalie

don't want Afghan

women to be burned alive for leaving the house. It's great that everyone is so concerned all of a sudden
about the plight of the Afghan
women. The strange part is, we
never cared before.
The
violation of Afghan
women's liberties did not spring up
magically when our "war on terrorism" began. Ever since the Taliban
took control in the mid-90s,
women's "individuality"
the
virtue we Americans enjoy most

has been squelched in Afghanistan
(not to mention much of the rest of
the world). So why the sudden

empathy?
Perhaps we might take a hint
from a Chicago Tribune article entitled, "To Win Terrorism War, Fight
Abuse of Women." Mainstream
media seem to be offering up
women's rights as a reason for liberal-minded Americans to endorse
the war. Don't believe that the civilian deaths of Sept. 11 warrant more
civilian deaths? Don't believe that
terrorism can be squashed by illtargeted bombing? That's okay, you

can still stand united in the cam-

paign for bloodshed. This is a war

for women.

We are fighting for little

Times, who must wear her chador
regardless of her feelings. We are
fighting for every woman not

allowed into a Taliban training
camp. We are fighting for oppressed
even
women across Afghanistan

better, oppressed people across
Afghanistan.
Eventually, when their rights
are restored, they will thank us for
our bombs and our gunshots. And
for those who are killed by our
bombs and not by their husbands?
There's nothing like being condemned to martyrdom. So much for
"individuality" and personal choice
when you're dead you don't have
many options.
Obviously, this war was not
motivated by the oppression of
they are simply a
Afghan women
convenient tool used to popularize
the cause. None of the actions the
United States is taking are promoting women's rights in any way.
In fact, if millions more Afghans
starve this winter because of our
actions, you can bet that half of
them will be female.
The Chicago Tribune, CNN and
Aunt Rosalie should be applauded
...

for

their newfound feminism.

However, if their concern for
Afghan women simply translates
into support for the war, they are
becoming one more vehicle of

BY
Night

has long since blanketed the town of
Swarthmore. In the darkened, claustrophobic cabin
of borough patrol car 95-22, the pale-green dashboard clock paces the marathon evening: a little more than
one hour down, a little less than eleven left on the graveyard shift. A symphony of radio frequencies
from the
borough, from several other districts, and from the college
emanate from the tangle of equipment lodged between
passenger and driver seats. Four cup-holders line the center console. In nighttime law enforcement, your first line
of defense is coffee.
It is exactly 9:12 p.m. when the big Ford Explorer patrol
car rumbles down Harvard Ave. and right past Mary Lyon
on routine patrol. Conversation turns to silence, and the
two bodies in 95-22, cop and reporter, cast parallel glances
at the all-too-quiet building.
"Tonight's the Halloween party, isn't it?" asks Sgt. J.R.
Wesley, a smart, burly, no-nonsense veteran of the
Swarthmore Police Department. He already knows the
answer, because, he says, "They tell us about that stuff."
Yes, tonight is the annual ML Halloween party. Tonight
there will be crowds and noise and underage drinking in
the middle of a residential neighborhood. We drive on.
Between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m., Sgt. Wesley will go on campus exactly four times three times on routine patrol, and
once on a call he wasn't asked to respond to. Four hours,
two cups of coffee, one traffic ticket and one noise complaint later, no students will have been cited for underage
drinking, no one will have called for an ambulance, and no
-

parties will have been broken up. A quiet night in
Swarthmore, yes, but also a routine one.
Borough police, public safety and college administrators all scoff at suggestions of increased police presence on
campus this semester. "The amount of patrol, I would say,
is minimal at best," reports Swarthmore Police Chief
Brian Craig. It spiked after last semester's assault, he says,
but has since fallen back to normal levels. He claims that
ville police patrol the campus no more at night than they
do during the day.
"Unless there's a reason for them" to come on campus,
says Associate Dean Tedd Goundie, "I think they're content not to be too terribly involved with what we're doing
here." Goundie tends to dismiss claims about increased
police presence as perennial grumbling on the part of students. "I get the sense that the students perceive there's an
increase" in police presence, says Goundie. "But," he adds,
"I've been hearing that every year for the last five years."
Many think that policing has actually decreased in the
last three to five years. "You think we're patrolling more
now on that campus?" asks 10-year Swarthmore veteran
William Thomas, his voice rising for the effect. "We actually used to do foot patrol," walking up and down Parrish
Beach.
With public safety and Garnet Patrol covering the campus, most borough officers feel relief that they can spend
more time off campus, protecting those who don't have
their own private policing force. In theory, borough police
always has two officers on duty, but with sick pay and

vacation time, there's often only one. That's one officer for
the campus, the rest of the borough, and Ridley Township,
which Swarthmore patrols by contract. Public Safety will
usually have three or more officers on duty.
Sgt. Wesley says of the campus, "It's part of our job, but
I'd much rather see Public Safety taking care of it." By 10
p.m., Wesley had driven once to each end ofParrish Circle
circling by the Rose Garden at 9:35 p.m. and Tarble at
9:51 p.m. Both times, students didn't seem to notice or care
very much. By 11 p.m., he had patrolled the SEPTA station
on foot but stopped at the campus edge. And at 11:47 p.m.,
he took a drive down Whittier Place and swung around the
DuPont parking lot. He didn't see a soul.
Police presence on campus is not always such a bad
thing, say Deans. "There are plenty of times we ask for the
police," says Goundie. "We ask for visibility on campus."
Following a number of criminal incidents last semester,
the college fielded complaints about heightened police
presence. "Students started complaining that there were
too many police on campus," adds Goundie, "after sitting
in a meeting in Kohlberg Coffee Bar where students were
complaining the campus isn't safe."
For a police force obligated by the law to cover its jurisdiction, most officers spend far less of their time on campus than they do off. The campus, after all, makes up 40
percent of the borough's geographic area and fills an even
larger percentage of its crime statistics. "All you have to do

Police presence on campus unchanged

After an increase in policing following last semester's assualt, patrol has leveled off, say college and borough

is look at the crime stats to see where the most happening
place is," says Patrolman Thomas.
"It's my obligation while on duty to protect the people up
there as much as down here," he adds. But, like most officers, for Thomas, avoiding the campus becomes a matter of
practicality, conflict avoidance and professional restraint.
After a night on patrol with borough police, it's obvious that
most officers are not looking for an excuse to come on campus. If anything, they are looking for an excuse to stay off.
Visibility games
"Right now, this is my town," says Wesley, as he turns his
vehicle down yet another empty street. The routine of patrol
sets in very quickly. Drive around. Come
to a stop sign. Look left, look right, look
left again: not just for cars, but for bad

"Here I am," says Wesley, summing
up his philosophy with no-nonsense
terseness. "I'm out here. And if you do
something wrong, I'm going to catch
you."

enters the lobby, but goes only a few feet, stopping far short
of the party. Molly Manvel 'O2, one of the RAs, greets him.
Are there any problems? Do you know where to reach him?
Manvel shows him the phone number written on the back
of her hand. Lorenzi leaves, satisfied.
Both forces have sworn officers, though not all on public
safety are sworn. Two public safety officers are retired
Philly cops who worked on big-crime investigations, many
more on other forces. Besides similar training and background, personal relationships are also strong. Sgt. Wesley

zone.

Flashing lights, license plate check and $9O ticket follow.
It's all very routine, yet so serious. Before Wesley gets out of
his car, he puts on his police cap, adjusting it for just the
right look. He walks toward the car with his hand on his
gun, his flashlight probing the empty back seat for guns,
drugs or hiding persons.
Nothing there, just like last time, just like so many times
before. After 10 minutes of paperwork, the bad guy is off.
As a police officer, there is a certain way of dealing with
people, an academy-ingrained attitude that is at the heart of
how big you walk and how low you talk. "You're in charge
of the situation. You don't let other people tell you what to
do," says Wesley. "Even if I'm just out on the street, in the
back of my mind I've got where my gun is."
This mentality makes for good policing but bad interpersonal encounters. "There's a natural tendency to get
nervous or
defensive around police," says Goundie.
While he says such skepticism of authority is natural, he
also thinks students go too far in taking a negative attitude
toward police. When borough cops are on campus, he has

Tied hands and hard lines
The difference between public safety
and borough police centers on higher
authority. Public safety is often required
to be soft, both because the administration tells them to and because they can't
express their authority. "I think their
hands are tied. I think they're not
allowed to take action against college students," says borough officer Thomas.
"Whereas me, I'm not obligated to answer the college."
According to Sgt. Lorenzi, public safety often gets caught
in the middle between students and borough police. "It's not
a one-sided misunderstanding. [Borough police] have a job
to do. Sometimes students don't want to see it that way." On
the other hand, police "don't want to take into account that
this is a college, that this is a tough college, and that for one
night a week students want to have fun."
By being more lenient with students, public safety often
gets a lack of respect from students and a feeling of distance
from the more hard-line borough police.
While borough police enforces the law, public safety
enforces the college's interpretation of the law. On most
issues, the two forces act identically. Property damage,
domestic incidents, graffiti, parking tickets these are all
laws both departments are happy to enforce.
Gray area in a bottle
There is, however, one gray area. One area that causes
misunderstandings and uncertainty and occasional ill will.
"Alcohol incidents," says Sgt. Lorenzi, "are the gray area."

flower shop. Wesley, on foot patrol, arrives two minutes
later, just as the other officer pulls up, turning off his headlights as he reaches the alleyway. They enter an open door
in the rear and walk into the corridor. There seems to be no
noise, but after listening silently, they hear the sound of several loud, playful voices coming from an apartment down
the hall. Hardly a blasting party. Wesley knocks on the door
withthe butt of his flashlight. The door opens. He can smell
the alcohol.
The apartment goes silent. "Was there a noise complaint?" asks the girl at the door, a Swarthmore student. No
need for an answer: she promises to keep it quiet. Wesley
asks for identification to take down her name. He looks at
her ID card; she is three months shy of 2L "Haven't been
drinking, have you?" Wesley asks. "Everyone else in there

is over 2f right?" Wesley already knows the answers. He
offers a hypothetical warning: If you were drinking, you

Underage drinking 'gray area' of policing

back," he says, "they're going to get arrested."
After such an incident, one begins to understand what
Wesley means when he says "this job is 100 percent discretion." In a job that technically allows very little discretion
all officers are sworn to uphold the letter of the law the
realities of policing swirl around momentary decisions. The
underage drinker was three months shy of 2L Were she 17,
he says, it would have been a different ballgame.

Leniency never clear cut
All borough police officers will cite students for underage drinking if they are put in a situation where they cannot ignore it. But as police attitudes and two separate incidents from this past semester show, drawing that line
between citations and total leniency is never clear-cut.
Most borough officers say they do not actively seek out
underage drinkers on a regular basis. "When it comes to
alcohol, it's not like I have a vendetta," says borough patrolman Thomas. Citations, he adds, don't mean anything to
him. "The number one concern for me about students up

there is their safety."

Borough police, according to Chief Craig, are not drawn
toward underage drinking in itself. "If the person appears to
be underage, and it looks like an alcoholic beverage," he
says, "98 percent of the time, that's not going to draw the
officer's attention." What does draw attention is the behavior that can accompany drinking, behavior that, according
to Craig, is "outrageous."
Police discretion will only go so far, however. Because
their job and their professional sense of purpose depends on
upholding the law, officers often seem to believe every law
they uphold. "If you're looking for us to say that it's ok to
drink when you're 18 years old, we're not going to tell you
that," says Craig.
"That's not for the student to decide whether they're
drinking responsibly," says Wesley. "The law says wait

until you're 21"
The belief in the law often runs deep. Craig will preach,
for a very long time, about the dangers of alcohol, about
how he has seen lives ruined, about how drinking problems
start at a young age. With his own children, he says, there
is a zero-tolerance policy.
If Craig believes in the danger of underage drinking,
though, he also believes in leniency. Rarely, if ever, has a
student cited for underage drinking received the full weight
of the law, which includes loss of driver's license. Instead,
students must complete a task-force program.
"It's not our intention to be punitive," says Craig. "It's to
be helpful, and as a law enforcement officer your options to
be helpful are very limited."
Public safety, on the other hand, works very explicitly
under administrative guidance on the alcohol issue. Their
duty is not to ignore alcohol-related issues, but to worry
first about safety and then let the deans handle any punitive
measures. Officially, underage drinking can lead to adjudication at the college, but, according to Goundie, this only
happens in context of other behaviors associated with
drinking. But just about any student who public safety deals
with on an alcohol-related matter, says Goundie, is called in
to talk with the deans.

drinking. "I didn't even want to go in, because obviously I
know," he says. "You know as well as I know I'm gonna get
underage kids in there. But I'm not gonna do that."
"If the police were really out to bust every underage
drinker they could find, then every weekend they could cite
hundreds. It's not like they're going out and mounting a
campaign," Bob Gross, dean of the college, said. "We need to
keep that in some perspective."
Two weeks before the Olde Club party, however, a far
less volatile incident did result in two citations. On a
Saturday night, early in the morning of Sunday, Sept. 9, two
students on their way to Worth Health Center had an
encounter with a borough officer, according to Goundie.
The officer then followed the students into Worth Health
Center, where they were cited. Craig resisted giving the
names of the officers on duty that night.
Sgt. Lorenzi said public safety felt such citations were
extreme. "I think you step over the bounds of good policing
when you give Breathalizer tests at Worth."
According to Linda Echols, director of the health center,
police presence is one of the most unnerving aspects of
Friday and Saturday night nursing duty. While she called
the Sept. 9 incident "atypical," she does admit that health
center nurses will sometimes discourage drunken students
from coming to Worth. She also said nurses are cautious
when communicating student concerns. "When [students]
call and when we call [public safety]" she says, "we have to
be careful about what we say on the phone. They'll transmit
what we say" to borough police.

Alcohol, police and Worth
Goundie says that Worth's status as a safe space "has
always been a concern." In the Student Handbook, it states
all students are given the right "to have all incident reports,
medical records and testimony kept confidential." Goundie
says that, in cases of alcohol-related incidents, this means
that if students seek help at Worth, their visit will not be
used as evidence against them.
In response to the citations at Worth on Sept. 9, Goundie
called Chief Craig. Although Goundie would not say exactly
what went on during their conversation, he would say "we
looked at the totality of the situation."
"The message from the police is that it was a legal stop,"
he added.
Craig, who called the matter "confidential," refused to
talk about the details. He did say, however, that there was
an "internal investigation." He worked both with Goundie
and with then-Mayor Bill Cumby, issuing a private report.
No one was reprimanded as a result of the investigation,
said Craig, but, at least according to Goundie, the citations
were lifted.

At 12:08, driving out of downtown, Wesley says he is

may be getting rowdy. We turn on to Yale Ave., then make a

is among borough officers. "I don't want to be the guy to
make them think, 'Don't go to the health center,' says
Thomas, who describes himself as one of the less aggressive
officers on the force. He will, however, cite a student when
an ambulance call brings him to Worth. He'll also question
the student about where he or she got the alcohol. "I want to
know, if this person is so drunk to the point that they're
possibly going to die, who's serving them and is there anybody else at that party who's like that."
"

Testing discretion
There is implicit concern from the side of borough police
that the college is too lenient. Goundie, however, thinks that
the college and borough police have come a long way in
understanding the other's approach. "The borough knows
our position on this and we know the borough's position on
this," says Goundie of the underage drinking policy. The
college, in most instances, sees little problem with borough
police's handling of underage drinking.
On the night of Sept. 22, borough officer Thomas's discretion was put to the test. Responding to a noise complaint
that Saturday from the borough Thomas first went to the
site of the complaint and, hearing music from the direction
of the college, followed the sound onto campus. After successfully getting partiers at Paces to lower the volume, he
went to Olde Club where, he says, after nearly 10 minutes of
waiting, there was no noise reduction. He then went into the
party and shut it down. While he was there, he says, there
was a "mass exodus" of students out of Olde Club.
Why didn't Officer Thomas cite students for underage
drinking? He smiles knowingly, cutting off the question
before it is finished. "I was there for the noise," he says, his
smile working like a secret handshake. Between the students leaving the party and the ones left inside, there was
no doubt in Thomas's mind about the presence of underage

On a "quiet" Friday night in the ville, Sgt. Wesley breaks up
the routine of car patrol by walking the downtown area.

Personal patrolling patterns
Public safety and college administration see aggressive
behavior, the kind that leads to random citations, as the
minority in the borough department. "Just one or two [borough officers] are the ones who will come up" to snoop
around campus, says Lorenzi. "Eight out of 10 let public
safety handle it."

One hour after Wesley avoided citing the students on the

noise complaint call, a shuttle driver reported from the
Halloween party. "Public safety officer over to ML. It's getting kind of rowdy over here." He heard it loud and clear
over the college frequency. Wesley's patrol car was within a
few blocks of the dorm, and heading in the general direction. Responding to the call? "Not unless they ask me," he
responded. Two public safety officers were on the scene
within a few minutes. We made a right turn, heading away.
At midnight, the second officer on duty headed home,

over there isn't around to bust anyone.
After two minutes, Wesley turns around and heads back.
At exactly 1:00 a.m., five hours in to the graveyard shift,
Wesley is back on Chester Rd., two blocks away from campus, when news of a "possible altercation" near the field
house comes in over the college scanner. Wesley hasn't been
called for backup, but he's going anyway.
Just as he enters the downtown, a public safety car pulls
ahead of him, already on the call. He asks the borough dispatcher to let the college know 95-22 is responding on backup. Twenty seconds later both cars approach the field house.
Nothing. Wesley puts on his spotlight and shines it over by
the mechanical buildings across the field house. Nothing in
sight. The public safety vehicle continues up toward
Wharton, while Wesley turns left onto the access road
behind the Mullan Tennis Center.
More than a half-dozen students are walking home from
the Halloween party. He rolls down his window to talk to a
couple of them. The students hesitate. "You guys seen a
They hear the officer

fight around here?" he asks. No, they haven't, they say,
their voices edgy. Wesley drives on.
As he turns around, it is pointed out to him that the first
thing on the students' minds was probably a citation for
underage drinking. "Yeah," he says, as he drives his patrol
car away from campus, "and that' not such a bad thing." ,

Let's talk about sex
BY MATT RUBIN
Tony Award winner Harvey Fierstein's 1989 play
"Safe Sex" owes much to the time during which it
was written. The play is a series of vignettes
addressing the AIDS epidemic and its übiquity, a
topic on the social vanguard a decade ago.
Recognizing that the play has a highly different
meaning more than ten years later, director Marc
Boucai 'O4 has used creative additions to highlight
the themes of the play to make them more relevant
to a contemporary audience.
Boucai's production of "Safe Sex" will be performed tonight, through Saturday, Nov. 10, in
LPAC's Pearson Hall. Each date will feature an 8
p.m. performance, with an additional matinee on
Saturday at 2 p.m. The theater only seats 100 people,
so interested students are encouraged to arrive

early.
In addition to the three short plays that comprised Fierstein's original production, Boucai has
added entirely new segments to the play. "I've taken
these three plays and installed them with dances
and improvs to bring to together a more complex
theatrical process," Boucai said.
While the script is relatively striaghtforward in
its analysis of the AIDS epidemic and its comparatively drastic effects on heterosexual and homosexual couples, Boucai's interpretation takes these
themes and portrays them in a more modern way.
In the first vignettes, "On Tidy Endings," Caitlin
Engelhard 'O3, Joseph Small 'O5 and Matthew Fitting
'O5 perform a story about the relationship between
an ex-wife and a male ex-lover of a man recently
dead due to the AIDS virus. The two struggle to settle the deceased man's estate. Their awkward interactions, replete with jealous accusations and insecurities, are evidence of the novel interpersonal scenarios created by the AIDS virus.
Boucai feels that the relationship dynamics created by AIDS are the central point of the play. He
says that the play "is not about AIDS. [lt] is about
how AIDS is a lens through which to view human
nature."

This Machiavellian view of AIDS is most clearly
corroborated by the text in the eponymous second
play, which stars Erica Cartmill 'O3 and May Blair
'O5 as a lesbian couple struggling with the nature of
their relationship, ostensibly in the wake of AIDS
and its effect on the queer community. Cartmill,
according to Boucai, comes close to stating the point
he is trying to make in a monologue. In the monologue, Cartmill discusses the drastic effect AIDS had
on queer relationships. By focusing mainstream
attention on queers, it has drawn them out of the
"chic, mysterious underground" whose disappearance Cartmill bemoans. This new role for queers has
led to an unfortunate struggle to identity. As she
says, "We were queer, now we're human."
The tension between Cartmill and Blair is palpable, particularly due to the precarious see-saw that
both actresses sit on during the scene. As their
respective roles in the dialogue change, so do their
positions on the see-saw. Their precarious relationship fluctuates proportionately to the prop, building
and dissipating in proportionate uncertainity.
In the final play, Olivia Harmon 'O4 and Petar
Lazaevic 'O3 play a heterosexual couple deciding
whether or not to have sex. Due in part to their fears
of AIDS but more to their emotional insecurities, the
couple fails to resolve any of the important issues
between them. Instead, they orbit around the issue,
using elements of Boucai's innovative direction to
convey a sense of cathartic disarray. By literally
dragging the bodies of their past onto the stage, they
use relatively obvious symbolism to appropriately
convey the justified intensity of their pedestrian
conflict.
These bodies serve as the setting for the ambitious and obscure final dance sequence, which
Boucai wants to keep a secret until the performance.
This reporter got a sneak peak, however, and can
say that it promises, among other things, the aforementioned bodies and radical movement to a soundtrack of Bjork and Verdi. In Boucai's words, "The
ending congeals all the separate pieces. It makes the
scenes, the dances, and everything else into a play,
gives it a shape."

Soundmachine keeps it real during its teen years
BY JOEL BLECHER
No one is exactly sure when it all began. Perhaps that
isn't such a big surprise Soundmachine has always been
clouded with myth. What exists only exists in oral tradition, and so The Phoenix set out this week to bring
Swarthmore's most infamously mysterious group to light.
Soundmachine was born some time during the early 90s
on the third floor of Tarble, to serve as a both a musical
equipment resource and a practice space for campus
bands. Unfortunately, it spent its childhood in a private
and isolated space, giving only a few individuals the "connections" to gain access to the room. Now, presently located on the top floor of Olde Club, things are really starting
to picking up for the blossoming group. "We provide a
helpful service to any students who want to start bands on
campus that aren't directly sponsored by the college," said
co-director Dan Consiglio 'O3. "We give them the chance to
explore musical interests without having to go through the
college itself. Basically, any student who wants to do something musical is welcome to use the equipment."
On a mere $250 annually from the Student Budget
Committee, and a capital replacement fund every few
years, Soundmachine has been able to maintain itself in
Swarthmore's growing student music community. "Right
now we're funded pretty well on a utilitarian level, so we
have equipment that works pretty well. Although there's
no resources to expand, that's okay. We meet the present
needs of most students on campus."
Among the Soundmachine inventory are several guitar
amps, a bass amplifier, a drum set along with microphones
and chords galore. But since their budget is pretty slim,
the directors have had to make some choices. "Often times
we choose our amps and equipment on durability rather
than quality," said Consiglio. "We go with brands like
Peavey that are known for lasting a long time. After all, the
gear gets used more often for practicing than performing.

Once we had a really nice China cymbal, but that degraded really quickly, and by the end of the year it didn't sound
nearly as good." He laughed, adding, "But some of those
amps have been around longer than I have."
When asked what equipment changes Soundmachine
planned to make, Consiglio replied, "Every once in a while
there's talk of getting a keyboard. We weren't really chartered to have instruments others than drums in our inventory, so that hasn't seriously been considered yet. If that

does happen it's not going to be for a while. At the moment
we're concentrating on what we've got." He showed some
discontent with the group's dependence on powered amps.
"Powered amps are a bit more difficult to use and have the
potential to be turned on damagingly loud. We would ideally replace those with better speakers that would be harder to overuse." Soundmachine is also in the process of

basement of the "barn." "It took us a while to round everything up. The bass amp was the only thing left in the
room!" said Consiglio. "But it's been a lot better in the last
couple years. In general the people who use Soundmachine
are respectful of the equipment." Indeed, their biggest
recent loss was the disappearance of a well-loved blue and
green blanket that used to reside with the equipment. "We
didn't really know where it came from or whose it was,"
Consiglio recalled. "And then one day, it was gone."
For now, they're just happy reveling in being more
active. "In the past there've only been one or two bands.
But now we have a larger group of active bands. In fact, we
have seven or eight groups that practice regularly. That's

Movie realness a confusing rarity
BY ESTER BLOOM
Hollywood actors are exaggerations of
only
real people. They're normal folks
taller, skinnier, wittier, more simple, more
lovable, more evil, more dramatic or more
blond, and the characters they play
emphasize all that. The Coen brothers'
newest, "The Man Who Wasn't There,"
portrays a Hollywood-normal town filled
with Hollywood-normal people, and in the
middle of that, one real-world-normal guy
who is just trying to do his thing.
The film, shot entirely in black-andwhite and set in the 19505, is marketed as a
"noir." As a genre, that means deep and
depressing; except that this is "noir" via
the folks who brought you "O Brother
Where Art Thou" and "The Big

Lebowski." The characters are caricatures, but they provide comic relief, at
least at the beginning. And the lonely, cynical anti-hero who watches the world
unravel, cigarette in hand, is usually a private eye here, he's a barber.
Billy Bob Thorton (known primarily as
Mr. Angelina Jolie, i.e. the most sexually
satisfied man in America, and secondarily
for his Oscar-nominated performance in
"A Simple Plan" and his Oscar-winning
performance in "Sling Blade") plays Ed

Crane, a taciturn man in his mid-thirties
who wants more out of life. No one around
him would suspect him of ambition: He is
second-chair in his wife's family's barber
shop, run by his paunchy, excitable brother-in-law; owns a split level house; and has
an outgoing, assertive wife, Doris (Frances
McDormand, who can pull off anything).
The American dream.
As he narrates his life to the audience,
however, it is not as ideal as it seems. No
one listens to him. His wife invites her
boss and lover Big Dave (James
Gandolfini) over for dinner and laughs
extravagantly at his jokes and war stories

18

NOVEMBER 8, 2001

while Ed just watches. He can't escape any
of it: the job, the marriage, his wife's affair.
Then opportunity appears in the form a

man from Sacramento.

"Dry cleaning," he says. All he needs is
$lO,OOO and a partner and he can set up the
first store of what he swears will be the
fastest-growing trend in America. The
idea intrigues Ed. He himself doesn't have
$lO,OOO. But Big Dave does, and as Ed
rationalizes it, losing the money would
hurt, but Dave's been screwing his wife
and that hurts some too. Ed types out a
blackmail note and delivers it.
In proper "noir" tradition, everything
goes wrong. Superficial truths peel away
to reveal rot and corruption. Ed's silence
had invited other characters to fill in his
negative space with their imaginations:
when he proves them wrong, more than
one shouts with confused fury, as though
he's betrayed them, "What kind of man

are you?" And inevitably, people die. But
the Coens never entirely touch with the
farcical elements. They pepper the film
with reminders that this isn't to be taken
too seriously, that it isn't real. They beg
their audience to have a sense of humor,
even while
and perhaps because they
take the trademark "noir" unfairness as
far as it can go.
Consequently, "The Man Who Wasn't
There" is both sad and inscrutable, and it
feels more like a psychological exercise
than a movie. Pulled in different directions and with a narrator they feel for but
don't understand a narrator more like a
real man than a character in a film, and so
almost beyond our Hollywood realm of
the audience doesn't
comprehension
know whether to cry or laugh. In the end,
maybe the only option is to admire the
Coens' ability to make cinematographically beautiful, risky films, and go do something uncomplicated, like have a cup of
coffee.

Emergency contraceptives
to be sold without
prescription in California
BY OYAN TENG
THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE (U. CALIFORNIA-DAVIS)
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. Emergency contraception soon will
be available without prescription in California, according to a
new law signed by Gov. Gray Davis that will go into effect Jan. L
The new legislation will allow pharmacists to offer the socalled "morning-after pill" only after completing special training.
University of California-Davis students seeking the drug currently can go to Cowell Student Health Center, where prescriptions are made after patients are evaluated in the women's clin-

ic.

"[Emergency contraception] is definitely a contraceptive
option that is used [on campus]," said Pat Lindsay, director of
health education. "Our goal is to see to it that students have the
information and resources they need prior to situations [requiring emergency contraceptives]."
Lindsay said the new law is a benefit for students who may
need to use the pills but stressed emergency contraception "is not
an acceptable resource to everyone," depending on an individual's values and circumstances.
Emergency contraception consists of a dose of pills taken
within 72 hours of intercourse and a second dose taken 12 hours

While the new measure has garnered
the support of many of the state's
health institutions, not everyone
believes the increased availability of
emergency contraceptives is a
step forward.
later. The pills reduce the chance of pregnancy by delaying ovulation or, in some cases, by altering the lining of the uterus to
prevent a fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the uterus.
While the California Right To Life Committee Inc. opposes the
new law as a means of promoting abortion, supporters include
the Public Health Institute, the California Medical Association
and Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California.
"[Nonprescription emergency contraceptives] is definitely
something we've supported and backed," said Anessa Lewis,
director of community services for Planned Parenthood in the
Sacramento/Stockton, Calif., area, which includes Davis, Calif.
Women seeking contraceptives on campus are usually
referred to Cowell Student Health Center or Planned Parenthood,
according to Maria Alonzo of Peer Counselors in Sexuality.
Alonzo said emergency contraceptive awareness is part of the
organization's general education programs on safe sex and birth

control.
Students on campus expressed mixed reactions to the new law.
"I'm really torn because I feel it's a woman's choice [to control
unwanted pregnancy]," sophomore Chrissie Twomey said. "I
think having it over the counter will increase abuse of the pill,
which is wrong."

Junior Kelly Manjibar said emergency contraceptives should

be accessible to anyone who needs them.
"I think everyone should have a choice," Manjibar said. "It
should be easily available to them."
While the new measure has garnered the support of many of
the state's health institutions, not everyone believes the
increased availability of emergency contraceptives is a step forward.
"I would consider making it a prescription," junior Eumie Lee
said. "With the increase in sex [among] young kids these days, it
shouldn'tbe so easy to get it over the counter because they would
take it for granted."
Currently pharmacies offer a four-pill package which is the
amount needed to treat one instance of possible pregnancy for
about $3O, a price that may increase after the new law goes into
effect, according to one Davis pharmacist who did not give his
name.
"Probably, in terms of marketing, they'd have to spend dollars

Matt Rubin 'O3, who was running for the position

minority elections inspector by default. Each party
puts forward a candidate for majority elections
inspector in each of the three borough precincts. The
winner is elected majority elections inspector, and
the loser then gains the position of minority elections

"Initially, I wanted to run for borough council,"
said Rubin, who is president of the Swarthmore

whelming."

The election inspector's duties are to ensure that
basic voting regulations are followed, which includes
making sure people are not campaigning too close to
the polls or voting with an open container of alcohol
in hand and administering the voting machines.
"I think it's important that it be known that this is
not the most substantive of positions," Rubin said. "I
hardly pretend that this is some kind of coup for students. It's important because it shows that the citizens of the borough are excited about participation of
college students in their activities."

Politician and activist to give lecture
From LEWIS, pg.

Dorsey called Lewis
pivotal
figure in the transition in old

guard leadership" of the civil
rights movement. Before Lewis,
she said, civil rights leaders tended to move along slowly, accepting
the advances the federal government gave them but rarely pushing for radical reform.
Lewis, "like King, is the voice
that said no, we will no longer be
complacent, we want to know

what side the federal government
is on," Dorsey said.
In taking this stance, Lewis
stood in opposition to not only the
white Southern mob but also to
the group of conservative blacks
who had previously largely controlled the civil rights movement.
This put Lewis in to a situation
Dorsey described as "an amazing
space, where all you have is the
courage of your conviction."
Lewis began his role in politics
in 1981 as a member of Atlanta's
City Council. In 1986, he was elected to represent Georgia's Fifth
Congressional District in the
United
States
House
of

Representatives.

Lewis is currently serving his
eighth term in this capacity and
remains an active political figure,

"We felt that everyone in the student
body would want to
hear John Lewis
speak. All in all,
he's just a fascinating figure to have
here."

Aside from his previous contributions to the civil rights movement, Woodiwiss noted that in his

beyond

the 10 percent level,
Untereker believes the reason the

college has not implemented any
changes is that it sees the current
policy as a workable compromise.
"I believe the 'cap' of 10 percent
of the financial aid budget each
year being made available to as
many foreign nationals as it will

cover has been viewed as a decent,
if imperfect, compromise to pro-

vide economic diversity among
our international admitted students without excessively draining the college's private resources
for student financial aid," she said.
Once an international student is
admitted to Swarthmore, the college will cover his or her full financial need. But students must be
admitted first, and Untereker said
an indication of a need for financial
aid "has tremendous impact on his
or
her admission
status."
Untereker is confident, however,
that this fact has little impact on the
international pool in its entirety.
"The international pool of appli-

cants is incredibly strong already
I can't imagine need-blind admissions changing that," she said.
But Ignatius Immonje 'O4, who is
from Kenya, disagreed. "If the college really wanted to attract more
attention from international students, I think a need-blind admissions policy would really help," he

said. Immonje added that when he
first started looking at American

colleges, he began by searching for
schools with need-blind policies for
foreign students. Although he said
a need-blind admissions policy did
not end. up being a deciding factor

still "focuses a lot on contempocivil rights and voting
issues."
"We felt that everyone in the

said. "All in all, he's just a fascinating figure to have here."

in his final decision to attend
Swarthmore, it was a major concern at the beginning of his search,
and he believes it was for many of
his peers. "It's a very significant

tky

factor for internationals," he said.
Aduke Thelwell 'O3, however,
said she could understand why the

P4YI

college might not want to institute
a need-blind admissions policy for
international students. Although
Thelwell, an international student
from Jamaica, said such a policy
might be more consistent with the
college's mission statement, she
knows that it could be an economic strain on the coUege. She added
that she wasn't sure if a need-blind
policy for international students
was really necessary, as she thinks
that the international pool of students is generally fairly wealthy
and often able to cover their own
living expenses.
"From a moralistic view, I feel
there should be need-blindadmissions," Thelwell said. "But from
an economic point of view, I can
see how it might be difficult."
A need-blind admissions policy is not Untereker's biggest concern regarding foreign students.
Following the events of Sept. 11,
she is instead worried that the
question of financial aid will pale
in comparison to the problem of a

smaller international admission

pool.
"Right now, my biggest fear is
that after the events of Sept. 11,
many international families will
discourage their children from
applying to U.S. colleges or, even
more heartbreaking, will not permit them to enroll once admitted."

of players who will still

tradition.

Paul O'Neill: The veteran was supposed to get
one last victory. He said
after Game 5 that the end

better. But they could have
won number 27, fourth in a

now, Paulie says it's time to go. Hopefully, no one
else will get to wear number 21 again in New York.
At least not until he's ready to come back and
manage his team to that World Championship
that was stolen during the last at bat.
Scott Brosius, Chuck Knoblauch: With all
the ups and downs, one more up would have been

appropriate. These two have slumped, but they
came through when it mattered. They have been a
driving force behind this team. The Yanks had
won every year they were teammates. And if only

Orlando Hernandez: It's ok, they always said,
because El Duque was on a raft. He won with the

Yanks, but in all likelihood he won't be rejoining
this pitching rotation next year. In the end, his
arm betrayed his unknown age. But he always
came through in big games, just as he did in Game
4.
Tino Martinez: He shouldn't go. He had the

unimaginable task of replacing Donnie Baseball,
the man who will one day manage the Yankees.
Tino made us forget Mattingly. He came through
again this season, showing that he still can still
power an offense. George should give him the contract he deserves. We want the man who put his
hj

heart and soul into every game.

So who's left?

Joe Torre, Don Zimmer, Mel Stottlemyre:
The Yankee brain trust. They gave this team solid
leadership. Joe will cement his place in the Hall of
Fame as one of the best managers in the history of
the game. Zimmer will sit on the right, and Mel on
the left. With these three behind the wheel, maybe

Jorge will get better at blocking balls and at throwing out

runners. He'll continue his

rise to stardom.
Mike Stanton, Ramiro
Mendoza: They'll be nasty

out of the bullpen. We'll love
them for it. The righty should
have pitched the eighth. He
was nasty all series, and one
fewer inning pitched by
Rivera would have meant a

dominating finish.
Some will stay; some will go.
New York can say good-bye and good riddance
to Jay Witasick and Mark Wholers. Luis Sojo will
hang it up after this season, and we can only be
left with the memory of "Hey Coney, why don't
you have a dance?" Does David Justice deserve to
be on this team another season? Not after his
incredible record-setting strike out performance.
Sterling Hitchcock proved himself against the
Diamondbacks, and a young arm would be very
beneficial for next season.

It will never be the same

That leaves us with a remarkably different
team for next season. We'll see a few young men
by the names of Juan Rivera, Nick Johnson, Ted
Lilly and Drew Henson. The next generation of
New York Yankees will begin their ascents into

stardom.
We could see a hot shot free agent. Jason
Giambi is available; Barry Bonds is available;
Boomer is available too. But do we want that?
Bonds is an animal. His personality won't fit with
the professional Yankees. Giambi is a joker. And
we all remember David Wells.
It won't be the same. The players we have
Paulie, Scotty Bro, Chuckie, Tino
grown to love
won't be here. We'll have to learn to love another set of Yankees, another group of players who
will still want to win even after it becomes an
annual tradition. We'll learn new faces and new
names with new personalities and new approaches.
If we're lucky, within the next few season, a
new Yankee captain named Derek will lead a
younger bunch of ball players as they establish
their own dynasty and dethrone the A's or the
Mariners or the Diamondbacks.

honors in conference
BY TARA TROUT

Swarthmore athletes are top-notch on the field and in the classroom as demonstrated by the large number of Swarthmore students
named to the Centennial Conference Academic Honor Roll. Early this
week, the Centennial Conference released the names of the 254 student-athletes that were recognized for their performances on and off
the field. To earn a spot on the Centennial Conference Academic
Honor Roll, a player must be a key returning player on a squad, while
maintaining a grade point average of 3.40 or higher.
The Garnet Harriers fielded the highest number of student athletes
on the honor roll, with the men producing three on the list and the
women earning ten spots. The men who made the Academic Honor
Roll include Ryan Budish 'O4, Abram Falk 'O3 and Joe Makin 'O3.
Those who earned the honor on the women's team include Njideka
Akunyili 'O4, Kate Baker 'O4, Cathy Danh 'O4, Krista Gigone 'O4 and
Kate Penrose 'O4. Three-year veteran runners Jeanne McFalls 'O3 and

Sarah Kate Selling 'O3 also made the list, as well as the departing
Christen Lungren 'O2, Loring Pfeiffer 'O2 and Jess Rickabaugh 'O2.
The women's soccer team had four athletes named to the Academic
Honor Roll. Tri-captain Marah Gotcsik 'O2 was joined by Erika
Kaufman 'O3, Lizzie Pike 'O3 and Rebecca Rogers 'O4.
The men's soccer team had two academic standouts, the versatile
Perry Grossman 'O3 and veteran midfielder Aurelio Perez 'O2.
The field hockey team also has some stellar students awarded the
honor, including tri-captains Amy Dißenedetto 'O2 and Carly
Hammond 'O2. Heather Doyle 'O3 and Katherine Murnen 'O4 were
named to the list as well.
On the volleyball team, Christine Hancock 'O2 was recognized,
along with teammate Bryn Rosenfeld 'O3. Second-year veterans Emma
Benn 'O4 and Sarah Donovan 'O4 rounded out the volleyball women
awarded the Academic Honor Roll.
All-Centennial selections
Swarthmore athletes not only excel in the classroom, they also
have athletic prowess and performance. They are also recognized for
their pure athletic ability. Many Swarthmore athletes earned AllConference recognition due to their superior performances in the fall
season. As of press time, the Centennial Conference postseason accolades were released for cross country, field hockey and women's soccer. The rest of the fall sports will be released next week.
For the cross country team, Maria Elena Young was the only person to gain All-Centennial honors, gaining Second Team recognition
because of her ninth place finish at conferences.
Three Garnet field hockey players got All-Conference nods. Tricaptain Katie Tarr 'O2 earned first-team accolades for the second consecutive season. The defender had four goals and four assists on the
season and recorded six defensive saves. A three-sport athlete, Tarr
finishes her field hockey career with 11 goals and eight assists, good
for 30 career points. Her defensive prowess is reflected by her 22
career defensive saves.
Joining Tarr on the First Team All-Centennial is standout forward
Kim Cariello 'O2. With 32 career goals and 78 career points, the
Hudson, Ohio native moved up from the second team this year.
Cariello led the conference with 11 goals on the season. She currently
sits at number six on the Garnet career points list, and number 11 on
the conference list.
Newcomer to the postseason accolades is goalkeeper Kate NelsonLee 'O3. Nelson-Lee got an honorable mention for her L45 goals
against average and an .837 save percentage that ranked fifth best in
the conference. The junior holds the school career record with 285
saves.
The 8-8 Garnet women's soccer team had one All-Centennial selection. Rookie Ele Forbes 'O5 was named to the second team for her outstanding defensive contributions to the young team. She finishes her
first collegiate season having started all 15 games, and with three
goals and one assist.
Swarthmore student-athletes reflect both parts of the description.
These Swatties are exceptional, and they excel both in and out of the
classroom, reflecting Swarthmore's versatility and diversity.

Catching the right coach
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
Earlier this year, Ryan Budish 'O4, a
member of the men's cross-country team,
opened his mailbox to discover a request for
a letter of evaluation for Peter Carroll.
Carroll, who has served as head coach
for men's and women's cross country and
track and field for the last two years, was
not being considered for promotion. Rather,

the request, sent out to many student-athletes, was for an appraisal of coaches who
would be reconsidered for their current
position.
Increased student input is one of many
overhauls the athletic department is instituting in its selection and retention of

coaches.

Currently the department is seeking
four full-time positions on the coaching
staff. Coaches for men's soccer, women's
tennis and badminton, baseball and field
hockey are all positions for which heavy
recruiting is taking place, according to
Athletic Director Bob Williams. And, in
many senses, the revamped model of coach
recruiting is more reminiscent of job
searches in non-sports oriented arenas than
one might think. The publications may be
more specialized than the "Help Wanted"
section of a major newspaper, but the athletic department's understanding of the
value of advertising in conducting its
search is essentiaUy the same.
"Depending on the search, [the search
committees] advertise in the NCAA News,
the NCAA website, local papers, and The
Chronicle of Higher Education," said Adam
Hertz, Associate Athletic Director. NCAA
sources typically elicit the best prospects,
but the specifics of each open position also
determine the approach toward recruiting.
"For sports like tennis, we'll also check
the local country and cricket clubs, as well
as the indoor [tennis] centers," said Hertz

by way of example.
As in most job searches, after coaching
candidates have submitted resumes, phone
interviews are conducted. Next, finalists
are selected to visit the Swarthmore athletic facilities and meet with coaches, athletes
and human resources personnel. From this

reduced group of candidates, a final selec-

"If a candidate tells us

that his or her primary
goal is to win a national
championship, then that
person probably isn't a
good candidate for

Swarthmore."
Associate Athletic
Director Adam Hertz
tion is made. This selection is made by
search committees chaired by Hertz.

Yet-to-be-appointed "student-athletes,
coaches and faculty outside the Athletic
Department" will serve on the committees,
Williams said. Additionally, Hertz notes
that human resources personnel, who have
the ultimate say in hiring decisions at
Swarthmore, will play "an indirect role, but
not an active one, on the committee."
The seemingly simple process is com-

plicated by a host of coaches presently
working at Swarthmore who are hoping to
have their positions upgraded from an
interim designation to one more permanent. "Our interim coaches actually are
full time. In some instances, they've
already been coaching here for years, only

on a part-time salary.

Last year, these coaches were given a
one-year full-time appointment," Hertz

explained. "This allows us ample opportunity to see if the coach wants to continue full
time, and select the best possible candidate
through a thorough search." Thus, while an
extensive advertising campaign is underway for many positions, it is possible that
vacancies will be filled from within the current Athletic Department.

"All interim coaches have been encour-

aged to apply, and are expected to be strong
candidates," said Williams. In addition,
"both volleyball and softball are expected to
be upgraded" to interim status from their
present lesser part-time designation,
according to Williams.
Other reconfigurations of positions will
also occur within the department. Coaches
previously responsible for coaching more
than one sport
such as Karen Borbee,
women's lacrosse and field hockey coach
will be generally restricted to one sport.
Although the position change originated
from the ARC recommendation last spring,
Borbee made the decision to move to a more
active role within the administrative part of
the department based on her commitment to
her family and to improving the experiences
of all Swarthmore student-athletes.

Borbee announced next year's coaching

change to her team after their final game
this season. Although saddened by the loss

of their long-time mentor, the team is looking on the bright side of things.
"I trust that Karen made the right decision for herself as well as the team," said
Katie Cloonan 'O3. "Her decision to concentrate more on her family, lacrosse and
sports administration seems to be a great
opportunity for the team's future. I think
the re-invigoration of athletics will guarantee success." Cloonan is one of three captains of next year's team, and will most likely play a significant part in the search for a

new field hockey coach.
Aside from these structural changes, and
internal recruiting strategies, decisions are
made on a variety of factors corresponding
to the specific needs of a variety of sports.
Internal evaluations of present coaches are
largely based on student recommendations
of the type requested of Budish.
But outside searches are much more difficult. Williams cites a simple formula of the
ideal candidate possessing, "competency,
commitment to the mission of the institu-

tion and to the education of our students."
Hertz concedes that identifying the factors for a winning formula is a bit more complicated. However, he identifies the main
criterion as "an understanding of the culture
at Swarthmore," and goals commensurate
with the reality of the team to be coached.
"If a candidate tells us that his or her primary goal is to win a national championship, then that person probably isn't a
good candidate for Swarthmore," said
Hertz. "The majority of our teams struggle
to achieve a winning record, so a national

championship is not a primary objective.
The understanding of the type of student
that comes to Swarthmore is."
Additionally, the committees aim to hire
coaches "who can teach the sport" and have
"the patience to grow with a team."
Experience and "chemistry with the [athletic] department" are both important factors
as

well.

Finding a candidate who matches all of
these criteria will require immense time.

Thus, the time line for this procedure has
been constructed to provide the maximum
scrutiny of candidates. Fall sport job

descriptions are currently being formulated. Next, ads will be posted, applicants

screened and interviews conducted.
Final selections for fall sport coaches are
expected to be made in late February or
early March, Williams said.

Swimming trounces Ursinus in season's first meet
BY DERRICK WU

The men and women's swim teams are lookanother successful season in the
Centennial Conference. Under the helm of 27year coach Sue Davis, the women's team took
at
the
gold
Centennial Conference
Championships last season. This season, the
Tide looks to repeat last season's success with
the return of several key veteran swimmers,
the leadership of captains Lisa Ladewski 'O2
and Allison Lyons 'O2 and the emerging talent
of the 2004 and 2005 classes. National-class
swimmers Amy Auerbach 'O2 and Natalie
Briones 'O3 helped carry the team last year to
the conference championships. "Amy is one of
the fastest swimmers in the conference," said
Denise Finley 'O3, and "Natalie trained with the
Stanford swim team last summer, one of the
best teams in the nation."
Despite losing Alice Bonarou 'O2 to a semester of foreign study and Davis to a semesterlong sabbatical, the rest of the team is looking
forward to an exciting, competitive season.
"We're really excited about coming back
from a championship season," said Auerbach.
However, the road back to a repeat will not be
easy. "It'll be a tough finish with Washington
and Gettysburg," said Auerbach. On Nov. 3,
Gettysburg lost their first dual meet in
Centennial Conference history to Washington
College. A sure preview of what is to come, the
Shorewomen defeated the Bullets by one point.
Last season, the men's team finished fourth
in the Centennial Conference Championships.

The men's team looks to finish strong in the conference this season.

The last time the Tide captured the conference
title was in 1989. However, since 1995 the team
has produced nine national qualifiers and three
All-Americans. Last season, the team was led
by breaststroke and individual medley (IM)
specialist Ted Sherer 'OL Despite the graduation
of Sherer, the team is still looking to finish
strong in the conference under the leadership
of captain Michael Dudley 'O3 and record-setters David Whitehead 'O3 and John Lillvis 'O3.
Whitehead holds the Swarthmore records in
the 200 freestyle (1:44:09) and 500 freestyle
(4:45:44) events; Lillvis holds the Swarthmore
record in the 400 IM with a time of 4:12:23.
Yesterday the men and women's swim teams
beat conference opponent Ursinus in the first
dual meet of the season. The men won 142-60 and
the women won 135-67. Both teams raced off to a
quick start, capturing first place finishes in the
200 relay. Women's team A with Auerbach,
Briones, Erin Dwyer-Frazier 'O5, and Krista
Gigone 'O4 opened the meet by finishing in first
with a time of 1:58.41; men's team A, with
Dudley, Eric Shang 'O4, Lillvis, and Jake Ross
'O5 also captured the event with a time of 1:45.08.

Other

first place

finishers

included

Meredith Leigh 'O4 and Lillvis in the 1000 free,
Kathryn Stauffer 'O5 in the 50 free, and Ben
Morgan 'O5 in the 200 free. Swat men's swimmers finished first and second in the 200 individual medley, with Shang finishing four seconds behind Whitehead in 2:09.58.

Thefirst major challenge for the men's team
will be on Saturday, when they take on
Franklin and Marshall in an away dual meet.

Ted's fantasy
basketball:
my new drug
We had fooled around before, but only for a couple of
weeks at a time and never too seriously. But last week
with fantasy league basketball, that is.
I fell in love
In the past, I would join public leagues full of eleven...

year-old boys and middle-aged basketball "gurus."
After a week or so of tinkering with lineups featuring
Zydrunas "Sore Foot" Ilgauskas, Allan "O-For" Houston
and Jason "Stat Line" Williams, I would quickly lose
interest in the league. Within another week or two, I
would forget my password, and that was the end of that.
But this year, my friend Phil invited me to join Ted
Chan's hardcore fantasy league, and my competitive
spirit awoke after years of hibernation. Evidently, Chan
has won this thing countless times. What's the exact
number? Well, take the number of women that Wilt
Chamberlain slept with and multiply that by the number
of white guys that start for the New Jersey Nets. Call
that number X. Then add the number of times Olden
Polynice has impersonated a police officer to the number
of times Jeff Van Gundy has taken a joyride on Alonzo
Mourning's leg. Call that number Y. Raise X to the Y
power, and
well, you get the point. Anyway, Chan is a
fantasy league legend, and I suddenly needed to dethrone
him and stake my claim to fantasy NBA supremacy.
The first step in my quest was the fantasy draft.

Misha Horowitz lays out for a disc during Ultimate practice this fall. He is one of three fall captains for the team

to finish fifth; look ahead to spring season

...

I would love to see a Celebrity
Deathmatch featuring Derrick
Coleman and Shawn Kemp. They
could slap each other around
with their double chins and love
handles, and the winner would
get the Oliver Miller trophy.
While I made some good, no-brainer selections (Steve
Francis, Baron Davis, Jamal Mashburn and Jalen
Rose), I cracked under the late-round pressure. My
risky, speculative picks (Matt Bullard, Jacque Vaughn,
Brevin Knight) made the Clippers' selection of Michael
Olowokandi first overall in the 1998 NBA draft look like
a cautious, conservative pick. Needless to say, I may
have found a needle in a haystack when I got Derrick
"Fat" Coleman in a late round. Interestingly enough,
Chan picked up D.C.'s Western Conference analogue,
Shawn "Puffy" Kemp. I would love to see a Celebrity
Deathmatch featuring those two heavyweights. They
could slap each other around with their double chins
and love handles, and the winner would get the Oliver
Miller trophy.
Though my draft appeared adequate, I managed to
fall to fourteenth place out of 16 teams within the first
week. Desperately seeking a band-aid for my ailing
franchise, I acquired the services of L-Fund (Lawrence
Funderburke) and Brian Shaw, and I waived Matt
Bullard and Sean Marks. I've also been eyeing E-Esch
(Evan Eschmeyer) and Danny Ferry. The guys at the
end of your rotation can really give you the edge.
So what's the outlook for the rest of the season?
Since I'm a novice at this fantasy stuff, I'm not really
sure. Right now, I'm last in the league in blocked shots
and second to last in steals. However, I own the rights
to Marcus Camby, Eddie Robinson and Chris Gatling,
and perhaps they will give me a shot in the arm when
they come off the injured list.

BY KATE NELSON-LEE
The Swarming Earthworms finished their fall season
on a high note this past weekend with a fifth place finish

at the CFCC finals at Princeton University. Before the big
tourney, the men's Ultimate team used the annual
Halloween tournament at Haverford as a fun warm-up.
The Earthworms showed up to the Haverford tourney
decked out in the pirate costumes complete with eye
patches. Intended as a fun outing for all, the day included
plenty of "singing of sea shanties and cheers of 'Aarrgh'
throughout the day," said tri-captain John Anderson 'O3.
"We only went 1-4 on the day, but everyone got a lot of
playing time and had a good time."
The team practiced intensely last week in preparation
for the CFCC finals at Princeton. Two previous weekends
of pool play had placed the men as the number eight seed
of sixteen teams heading into the finals. "We headed out
to Princeton ready to play our best line," said Anderson.
"Every game was against a higher seeded team."
First up for the 'Worms was host Princeton. They had
lost 13-4 to the Clockwork Orange on Sept. 16 at the Fall
Sectionals at Lehigh University. The 'Worms were fired
up for the matchup. "We came out really hot on a 5-0 run
to start the game and never really looked back," said tricaptain Misha Horowitz 'O3. They finished the Orange off
15-6.
With the strong win over Princeton, Swat took on
number one seed Bucknell. The perennial powerhouse

,_.

Mudsharks had beaten the Earthworms earlier in the season. Although the team had mixed feelings about the
game, some key players came up with some big plays.
"Pat Hagan 'O2 had a huge grab, going up over two
Bucknell defenders as they sandwiched him for the catch
in the endzone," described Horowitz. "They all tippled to
the ground on top of each other, but Hagan got up
unscathed while his two defenders writhed on the
ground, all pride lost."
The game was tough for the 'Worms, as the Sharkies
led 8-6 at halftime. "We let them get a two or three point
lead on us right in the beginning, and started trading
points throughout the rest of the game," said Anderson.

The 'Worms and Sharkies duked it out in the second half;
the score was locked up at 12-11 Bucknell before they
pulled away for a 15-12 win. Despite the tough loss, the
forward
next
looking
team
is
to
the
Earthworm/Mudshark matchup.
"Both of us ran a similar offense, and Bucknell just
managed to push theirs a little harder and get those couple of extra scores," said Anderson. "We know exactly
what we need to tighten up in order to take them in the
spring."

The loss sent the 'Worms into the losing bracket, with
hopes o f a fifth place at best. First up, the six-seeded
Space Bastards of the University of Maryland. Both the
Earthworm offense and defense came together, collimating in a 15-5 win. Handlers Jeremy Slezak 'O2 and Charles
Small 'O3 tossed out some huge throws to the big men up

front, Anderson and Horowitz. Horowitz cited the great
defense of relative newcomers Ben Mates 'O4 and Wynn
Wu 'O4.
The win put Swarthmore in the finals against fifth
seed George Washington University. The Hungry Hippos
came out strong to take a 4-0 lead over the Swarming
Earthworms. GW was always a step ahead until the
'Worms got a key turnover and scored to take the lead 98.
"We committed ourselves to wining the game, and
came back with some tactical changes in defense to end
up winning 15-12," said Anderson. Key for the 'Worms
were Brandon Silverman 'O2 and Slezak, both of whom
had been playing for the Philadelphia Rage club team earlier in the fall. Along with the dynamic duo, "Andrew
Rosskamm 'O4 played some stellar, extremely patient
offense," said Horowitz.
The weekend saw the return of the all-veteran line,
and a return to the level of play the Earthworms showed
last spring. The result is a new look for the team in the
spring. "Our performance at Princeton should be reflective of how we can do next semester, as we aim to go to
nationals," said Anderson. "We know what teams we can
beat, and we know what we need to improve to oeat the
rest. It's been a great end to a great fall season, and we're
all looking forward to the spring."
