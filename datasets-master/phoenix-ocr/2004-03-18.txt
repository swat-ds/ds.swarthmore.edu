Student interest in EMT program declines sharply
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Graduation is only a few months away, and
Swarthmore firehouse volunteers are apprehensive. With
Commencement will come the departure of more than a
third of the fire department's emergency medical technician staff, and there are few prospects for new recruits.
There are 12 active student EMTs on campus. Nine of
them will graduate this spring. With three EMTs returning
from abroad and two in training, this leaves eight EMTs
for next year, as long as no one decides to leave.
The number of students becoming certified EMTs has
dropped dramatically in the past few years, according to
college ambulance lieutenant Kate Groner 'O5.
Two years ago, there were seven students in the EMT
class, last year five and this spring just two. Groner said
she was not sure if the cause was students having less time
and interest or insufficient publicity for the program.

"It's like adding another class
to your course load. It's just
slightly overwhelming."
Kate Groner 'O5
ambulance lieutenant
In addition, when prospective EMTs do volunteer, it
takes nine months to a year to train them, according to
ambulance captain Charlie Somerdyk. "It just doesn't happen overnight," he said.
Taking the EMT training course is a large time commitment. It consists of 134 hours of class, the equivalent of
almost 12 hours each week for three months.
"It's like adding another class to your course load,"
Groner said. "It's just slightly overwhelming."
Students taking the course learn first aid and CPR as

well as skills like assisting burn victims and using a defib-

rillator.
Mark Hanis 'O5 recalled the classes taking up all of his
but working as an EMT has been even more
Sundays

time-consuming.
"Immediately after you're certified, you can start running as a regular EMT," he said. This involves working at
least eight hours each week, with a 12-hour shift about

every third weekend.
But Jon Ehrenfeld 'O4 said the time commitment was
not impossible to manage due to flexible scheduling. "You
really can set your own hours to a large extent," he said.
Neither Ehrenfeld nor Hanis thought the time commitment was driving away prospective EMTs. They suggested
the cause could be a lack of advertising.
Hanis said that, in past years, details about becoming
an EMT had spread mainly by word of mouth. The activities fair generally attracted few recruits. Ehrenfeld said

Delia Kulukundis Phoenix Staff

Kate Groner and Mark Hanis immobilize volunteer firefighter and EMT Jeff McKinney as part of their training.
the objective was now to "try to raise awareness both
through advertising and active word of mouth." With this
goal in mind, an open house will take place next Tuesday
and Wednesday.
Groner hopes to convince students to give the ambulance a try. "It's exciting and confidence-building and an
incredible experience," she said. "It's something completely different."
Hanis and Ehrenfeld speculated that the drop in numbers also might have to do with pre-med students no longer
being encouraged to join the firehouse ranks.
But Health Science Adviser Gigi Simeone said her
method of advising had not changed, nor had the number
of students pursuing pre-medical studies. She said she
advised all of her students to do some kind of hands-on
medical work but had never specifically told them to
become EMTs.
"We don't push one form of volunteer service over oth-

ers," Simeone said.
According to Somerdyk, historically there has been a
lot of involvement from college students.
"During the day, when most of us are at regular jobs,
the college students can step in," he said. "When they're
not there, it puts a significant strain on the community."
That means that this fall could be a difficult time for the
firehouse.
"While I don't think we are at anything approaching a
crisis, we're certainly at an unusual time," Somerdyk said.
"We do depend to a fairly significant extent on the participation of the college."
Groner agreed that the lack of college EMTs would
make things more difficult.
"It's not like the ambulance is going to disappear," she
said. "It's just going to be a lot harder for the people who
staff the ambulance right now to continue to do it full
time."

This weekend, Swarthmore will reinvent itself.
Production crews will be filming a DVD
video about the college and student life in
hopes of counteracting its reputation of
being too intense.
The process will include "shadowing"
six students in their daily activities.
The image of Swarthmore as a place of
academic rigor has been both an asset and
a challenge in attracting prospective students, school officials said. As a result,
Swarthmore is assessing its national image

and

"This is an issue that the college has

thought about for decades," Schall said.
"This has been a conversation for the last
80 years,
since the 19205, when
Swarthmore shifted to become an intellectual center with the inception of the honors program.
"There is a general sense that there is a
perception of this place that is narrower
than reality. We're not saying this perception doesn't have truth [in it], but it's not
the whole truth," he said. "I don't believe
there is a prototypical Swarthmore student, that there is a perfect Swarthmore

student."
The most recent drive has been to
rework the admissions materials sent to
high school students, for which the college
hired a New York design firm.
The Admissions Office will also create

a DVD video to send to prospective students, high schools and college counselors,
according to Schall.
Jon Huberth and Vern Oakley of Tribe

Pictures were chosen to create the DVD,
the same duo who produced the "Meaning
of Swarthmore" video.
"We envisioned a different approach
that would be successful; extremely cutting
edge," Krattenmaker said.

The goal of the film is "to let the reality
of Swarthmore unfold before them. The
film will allow students to see what its like

"The social aspects, hanging out in dorm

The committee selected six students to
film this weekend based on their interests,

schedules and interviews conducted by
the administration and the filmmakers.
Four film crews will shadow Joseph

Goldstein 'O4, Chloe Le Pichon 'O5, Anjani

"Spend some time giving

Managers meeting, he said that "despite the college's

Le Pichon said she had accepted the offer without giving it much thought.
"I want to show my opinion on Swarthmore, answer
questions [prospective students] may have, let people
know what Swarthmore is for me and what I really like
about being here," she said.

Some of the perceptions about Swarthmore's intensity

may be due to college guides, administrators argued. On
the first page of its review of Swarthmore, for example, The
Fiske Guide highlights a quote of a student saying, "Misery
poker is the most popular form of procrastination."
Author Samuel Fiske has accepted a recent invitation
from the administration to come to Swarthmore,
according to Krattenmaker.

President Al Bloom said Swarthmore is "still a secret

from applying or accepting."
Board member Sam Hayes '57, who has been involved
with various college visibility projects over the 20 years he
has been on the board, sees publicity as a consistent problem with Swarthmore.
Hayes believes the college's negative image is largely

due to a lack of publicity. Swarthmore alumni are concentrated in academia, the sciences and professional fields
like law and medicine, "in a sense in their own little
cocoons," he said, and thus not as visible to the general

public.

"[Swarthmore is] a college version of
The New Yorker magazine, and it
deserves to be known."
David Gelber '63

Board member David Gelber '63, an executive producer
for CBS's "60 Minutes," serves on the board committee
overseeing the visibility initiative. Gelber said he viewed
Swarthmore "as a little bit of a secret, about as good an
institution as it could be. It's a college version of The New
Yorker magazine, and it deserves to be known."
Bock sees the replacement of the existing guides as part
of a natural process, with viewbooks declining in value
three to five years after publication.

Bloom said he felt Swarthmore's image was not always
in keeping with the full breadth and depth of the institution. In his report, he said, "Stereotypes persist that fail to
capture the breadth and joy of the Swarthmore experience

and deter many students, who we know would thrive here,

The current guides are in their fourth year of use. Bock
described the view book as "a very intellectual, very beautiful piece" but said, students are "still really impressionable, looking at print publications to see if they're true to

Tuition to jump 4.5 percent
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

For the third year in a row, tuition will increase
this time to $39,408 a year.
The Board of Managers approved the change
during its meeting last month.
"Our policy is to keep tuition in response with
increases in family income," Vice President for
Finance Sue Welsh said. "This increase is a little
higher than the increases in family income, but we
have to balance providing a high quality education
with matching family income."
Welsh pointed out that Swarthmore was still
committed to need-blind admissions and said this
would not change despite tuition increases.
Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot said the
college planned with financial aid in mind when
determining charges. "When we're putting together budget and charges for next year, we're always
aware of families' increasing needs
we set aside
money for that," she said.
The budget process allows the college to spend
more on financial aid as tuition increases, Talbot
said. Funds, such as those set aside for
by 4.5 percent,

...

Swarthmore scholarships, can alter with changes
in tuition, she said. For instance, the need for
Swarthmore scholarships, which cover aid not met
by work-study, loans and other grants, increased
7.5 percent last year with the 4.5 percent tuition
increase. College funds met the need.
"When we measure a family's need, we take
into account the cost," Talbot said.
The college also tries to make sure its tuition is

in the same range as similar institutions. Because
of regulations against price-fixing, it is illegal for
colleges to compare tuitions with each other before
budgets are accepted, but schools pay attention
once tuitions are announced.
"Gradually schools are announcing their
increases, and 4.5 is on the low side," Welsh said.
A majority of next year's budget is for faculty and
staff compensation, which accounts for 59 percent,
according to the 2004-05 budget summary. Welsh
said faculty and staff expected raises every year.
The budget also includes a five-year plan to
improve retirement for staff. "Ours is below that of
comparable institutions," Welsh said.
"Other costs have also increased. The cost of
insurance premiums and library materials has

risen faster than inflation," she said.
The College Budget Committee, which consists
of students, faculty and staff, meets throughout the
year to recommend a budget, which the Board of
Managers accepted last month.
The 2004-05 budget will get 48 percent of its
revenue from Swarthmore's endowment and 42
percent from tuition.
While this is the third year tuition has
increased by 4.5 percent, it's hard to predict next
year's increase because it is contingent on the
inflation rate, Welsh said. Last November, the CBC
projected that by 2008 the tuition could stand at
$46,000 per year.
Since 1980, the steepest increase was during the
1984-85 and 1985-86 school years, when tuition
increased by 11 percent. In 2000, tuition increased
by a 20-year low of 31 percent, according to Welsh.

ITS in considering a printing queue that would require students like
Kier Wachterhauser and Lauren Kett to verify their print jobs.

ITS may implement new
printer queue service
BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu
With students and faculty printing over 2,000 pages a day on some
public-area printers, Information Technology Services has been testing a queuing printer service that could decrease paper waste by
requiring students to verify print jobs before the printing occured.

The service is a software program that would be installed on computers near the printers in McCabe, Cornell and Beardsley. It would
act as an intermediary between the students requesting a print job and
the actual printing, according to Seth Frisbie-Fulton, user services
coordinator of ITS.
The future of this possible service is uncertain, according to ITS
Director Judy Downing. The particular software has not been purchased or even decided upon, but Student Council and Earthlust have
voiced their support, Frisbie-Fulton said.
While Student Council "fully supports any improvements to reduce
paper waste," it is also concerned that the printer counter would be
"another step toward charging for printouts," Student Council Co-president Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 said.
ITS would only install this service in the libraries and Beardsley,
not in the dormitory clusters, Frisbie-Fulton said.
The software would take any items lined up to print and keep them
on a queue in the computer. Students would come to the computer and
pass the print job through to the printer, possibly by entering a password, Frisbie-Fulton said.
This method could create long lines of documents waiting to print
at the queue computer, but Frisbie-Fulton said there were "already
lines at the printers" as students waited for other documents to print.
With the print queue software, students would see their documents

printed immediately after clearing them through.

Wireless access to be installed in Cornell
Information Technology Services plans to set up a wireless network
at Cornell in the next two weeks in response to a request from the
library.
Students and faculty have been inquiring about wireless access for
a while, Science Librarian Meg Spencer said. Faculty have been walk-

ing to McCabe to use their wireless laptops and wanted the same service at Cornell, she added.
The college is discussing contracting for the project, and it is uncertain when wireless access will be available, according to Spencer.
Swarthmore will not pay any extra for equipment because ITS will
use previously purchased hubs bought as possible spares for the
McCabe network, according to ITS Manager of Networking and
Systems Mark Dumic.
Costs will come from wiring and mounting the antennae in Cornell.
The library will have to pay for the installation costs, according
Spencer.
Computers with wireless cards will be able to access the Internet
and the college network inside the library through a service currently
available at McCabe.
Aside from Cornell, ITS has no plans to install more wireless networks on campus, Dumic said. The college has not asked for more
wireless service on campus, and, given the budget crunch and the
instability of the wireless technology field, it is probably best to wait a
while longer until more networks are installed, he added.

week of June 7, according to Parrish renovations Project Manager Susan Sayer.
Facilities staff will clear out the dorm
rooms and move in the radio equipment.
WSRN staff are responsible for organizing and
boxing all of the equipment they will need for
broadcasting next year.
Station manager Alexander Flurie 'O5 has
been busy preparing for the move. He is planning to end broadcasting early this semester,
either April 17 or 24, to ensure that they have
enough time to pack.
Flurie estimates the job will take 80 hours,
but hopes all of the 161 disc jockeys will lend a
hand to speed the process along. The staff will
also attempt to weed out old, unnecessary
equipment. "It's a housecleaning," Flurie said.
WSRN can also leave equipment on the fifth
floor for the duration of the construction.
"We don't have to empty the space upstairs,"
Flurie said. They just have to vacate it, as it
will not be safe for students to be there.
Sayer does not expect the move to be very
difficult. "We think it's a fairly straightforward move," she said.
Sayer added that she was most concerned
about moving the transmission equipment but

said everyone involved had given it a lot of
consideration.
"I just want to make sure that we know what
we're doing when we move the equipment. It
hasn't been moved in a while," Flurie said.

Station engineer Mark Handler 'O5 is less
concerned about the equipment. He said in an email that it was "reasonably well selfcontained."

'

According to Handler, if WSRN encounters
problems in rewiring the studio on Parrish
third, the station will contact a radio profes-

sional for assistance.

The radio station is not planning to move
the transmitter itself. It will, however, move
the equipment that powers it. "All that we'll
need for this is to extend the wires," he said.
But Flurie is not completely reassured. "The
move is going to be a very big deal," he said.
"When it's pulled off, it will have been excellent
work done by a lot of people."
Handler stressed that "a lot of people" are
necessary. "We're going to need a lot of help to
get this done, and everyone involved needs to
take part," he said.
Once they accomplish the move, Flurie said,
being on the third floor for a year will not be a

Some economics majors planning to go into business said the

campus attitude toward business
was mixed.
"I know of several people who

have negative attitudes towards
business," honors economics major
Carolyn Sha 'O4 said. "I definitely
think it is not a focus here."
But Sha, who wants to pursue a
business career herself, doesn't
think students are intolerant
toward those interested in business.
Charles Sussman 'O5, an economics major interested in banking, agreed that the general attitude toward business on campus
was "pretty much neutral."
According to Sussman, not all students feel people in finance are
arrogant. "A lot of people are open
to business."

Kuperberg thinks "there probasome stigma" toward business
among a set of students and faculty.

But he said he thought the attitude had improved. At one time, a

student going into business was
considered "a pariah," according to
Kuperberg. "I don't think that's
true anymore," he said.
Lok said there was often a stigma against business because people associated it with a negative
view of corporate America and

He expects the station to begin broadcasting

Swatties have to go through red tape to take classes at Perm, Haverford and Bryn Mawr. Is it worth it?
BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Have you been itching to learn Italian
or take a course in natural medicine, only
to realize that (gasp!) it isn't offered at
Swarthmore? Swat has a fairly impressive list of course offerings, given its
small size, but each semester some students decide that's not enough and take a
course at one of the other three campuses
in the consortium.
Most people who take classes on other
campuses think the process is easy
enough to be worthwhile. The college provides shuttles to and from Bryn Mawr and
Haverford, which, according to Maki Sato
'O6, are "way convenient." Students traveling to Penn get reimbursed twice during
the semester for the cost of a round-trip
train fare, provided they keep their
receipts.

But students have to register in person, both at Swarthmore and at the other
college, a task that makes things more difficult for those who want to take classes at
Penn.
"Registration is a pain," said Becca
Galaski 'O5, who is taking American Sign
Language at Penn. "You get a letter to
take to the registrar at Penn. You have to
take it to the Penn registrar and register

there in person. They don't have any
online registration."
"Penn has gotten very strict about the

last day they'll accept registration," said
Elaine Hamilton of the Registrar's Office .
"And you must go to the College of
General Studies; the other schools are not
part of the consortium agreement. You
have to follow all of Penn's rules, because,
if you don't, they'll make sure you never
get a credit, no matter how hard you
work."

Most issues that come up, according to
Hamilton, have to do with registering.
"The biggest problem is when people forget to drop a class, or go to class and don't
register, and then wonder where their
grades are," she said.
Another difficulty is that Penn is not
on the same academic schedule as
Swarthmore, which can upset breaks.

unique opportunity," Buffie said. "Even

Penn has some additional requirements. The application to enroll asks for a
reason "why this course is important to
the student's course of study" and
requires the signature of the head of the
department within

would fall if it were offered at
Swarthmore. Students are not allowed to
take any Penn courses that Swarthmore
offers.

Swarthmore students had returned for

Each class includes some lecture and
some activities to illustrate how people

work together in groups. For example,
"one time we had a group of people, and
one person facing the other way, trying to
throw [rubber] ducks into a garbage can
[behind them]," says Shiah. "They couldn't turn around, so we had to direct them
on what direction to throw the ducks."

more of a hassle.
Even so, more Swarthmore students
take classes at Penn than at Bryn Mawr
and Haverford combined. This semester,
46 Swarthmore students are studying at
Penn, while 21 are going to Haverford and
only 11 are making the trip to Bryn Mawr.
Conversely, 40 Bryn Mawr students and
34 Haverford students are taking at least
one class here. No students from Penn
have taken classes here this academic

Shiah also had more trouble than most

No?

First of all, I do not have belly-dancing "anxieties." I have legitimate fears stemming
from a traumatic childhood experience. If, for example, I had been attacked by small pack

But I digress. Belly dancers or no belly dancers, Fez just isn't that grea
a place to eat. It's dark, it's crowded and the service takes forever. After
waiting 40 minutes (or, if you prefer, two wolves), when your food finally
shows up, it doesn't even taste very good.
The portions aren't very big, either. Eight courses for 20 bucks sounds
like a great deal, but just listen to these highlights and see if your taste
buds are still a-tinglin'. Don't forget to factor in long periods of time
between each course where you and your dining companion sit waiting

Spring, a time to float the cove
Here comes spring and most
of the world is at it again singing
"Oh, Sweet Nuthins" and sporting sunny-day driving caps.
While the lower classes are

enjoying the sunshine, it is still
our burden as academics to rest

our collective chin on our collec-

tive fist and create wisdom for
our collectively cavorting subordinates.

for the evening, it crossed somebody's mind again, and we
talked about what it really
meant to be successful in this

age of technological robots and
internets.
And when the morning light
was peeking through our Willets
window, we saw plain and clear
that the greatest measure of success was the mark that a man (in
a most inclusive sense) leaves on

the world, in a most constructive

sense, and also in a most linguistic sense, through the cliches that

a man is able to create that may
withstand the test of time (such as
that one). For example:
Back home, what we used to do
right when spring was rounding
the corner was to find the most
reliable vehicle of an iceberg and
paddle or sail it across the north
cove of the majestic China Lake.

"Looks like we're getting ready
to float the cove," they'd declare.
"Ayuh," old Elmer would join in.
"Looks like it." And the old-timers
would nod in agreement, staring
at the sunny sky out the window
and spitting at the wall.
We thought we were really
onto something when we opened
the Morning Sentinel to find that
a photo of flowers sprouting up

spring is just around the corner,

So we have been thinking a
lot lately about what it means to

be successful, academically or
otherwise, in this big round
world, so we can finally and
definitively publish a paper on it
and quit this whole idea of subjectivity.
The first thing we did was a
Web search; then, when we realized what we had just done, we

It was, and is, too soon to tell.
It was four years ago this spring
that we announced our idea, and
as yet folks in these southern
parts aren't quite ready to use our
cliche in any comfortable man-

ner. I suspected that everybody
had heard it and was just reluctant to use it, until I asked Alex
about my lurking suspicion.
"What's a cove?" he said.

emblazoned with the masThe Awkward Silence cot. But it's too late for
that now. The best you can
hope for is a look of vague
recognition and a "Huh.
OK ..." when you mention Swarthmore. So you have to
concentrate on your interview skills.
You may ask, "Elizabeth, if you have no job prospects
and you haven't gotten off the couch in a week, why should
I listen to you about interview skills?" Look, if you want
"easy answers," go to Career Services and tell them I said
thanks for the pizza. But if you want some semi-coherent
advice from someone who has been on at least two interviews, keep reading.

THE PHOENIX

Show you are at ease
It is important to show the interviewer that you'll feel
at home in the company, because everyone secretly wants
to hire their family. Try calling the interviewer by his or
her first name. If the interviewer seems comfortable with
that, make up a nickname, like "Spanky" or "Big Daddy."
Casually bring up that you've been "beer pong champ
three years running." Play "Hot or Not" with the people in
pictures on the interviewer's desk. Tell the interviewer
they're on "8.0. patrol" and to "flag me down when it gets
out of hand." Clip your toenails with their stapler. The
interviewer will see you're a fun, creative person to work
with. That's when you pants them.

Play hard to get

Interviewers are a lot like crushes. They'll want you
more the less they can have you. Be non-committal. When
your interviewer asks, "Could you start in June?" say,
"Maybe. We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?" and

wink.
Make the interviewer work to get your answers. Ask
ridiculous clarifying questions, like "What exactly do you
mean by 'previous experience'?" If you cannot answer a
question, tell the interviewer you would like to "use one of
your lifelines and poll the audience."

Show your creativity
Some job interviews may give you logic puzzles to test
your ability to think outside the box. You can stay one step
ahead by speaking in riddles. If the interviewer asks about
the biggest mistake you ever made, say, "It is the same mistake made by a bicycle trying to cross a river."
If you want to show off your eloquence, speak only in
palindromes. Although this may require more time

March 18, 2004

between the interviewer's question and your answer (as
well as some frantic scribbling), your efforts will not go
unnoticed. Answer all the interviewer's questions with

Steve Miller's "Joker" (emphasize "get my lovin' on the
run").

knowing about

will tell you that being prepared means

your potential

employer. Any idiot can reference a company's "business plan" or "position in the
industry." Set yourself apart by focusing on your inter-

viewer. This will create an unspoken bond between you.

Say things like, "Well, I don't plan to sleep my way to
the top" or "That question's easier than your wife!" If the
interviewer actually asks you what you know about the
company, be vague and complimentary. Talk about how
much you admire their "revolutionary paradigm" and
"ability to receive money in exchange for goods and

services."

Have questions ready
At the end of the meeting, the interviewer will ask if
you have any questions. You are supposed to pretend you
don't just care about the salary. So you need to be ready
with some stock questions.
Bring a personality test (I suggest Spark.corn's "The
Purity Test") and ask the interviewer each question. Take
a hookah out of your bag and exhale into the interviewer's
face, saying, "Whoooo are yoooooou?"
If all else fails, you can always just stare and say, "What
the hell have you been yammering about this whole time?"

MUSIC REVIEWS
"C'mon Miracle," by Mirah

(K Records, 2004)
Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn is utterly worthy of adoration. The demurely blithe singer and songwriter, who
hails from Philadelphia by way of Olympia by way of
Philly (and originally, apparently, by way of her parents' kitchen table) is petite and precious and blonde
and bespectacled. She possesses a pure, gorgeously girlish soprano, though befitting her sweet 'n' saucy lyrical
sensibilities, she employs it at times for less than pure
ends. And she's just adorable. But beyond that, she's
responsible for two of the finest records of the last few
years. Though her gentle, personable debut, "You
Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This" may
have included several underdeveloped tunes among its
myriad gems, and the adventurous production of its
acclaimed successor "Advisory Committee" sometimes
worked at cross-purposes to the songs themselves, both
are remarkably charming collections of creative,
vaguely folk-type music, with some truly exquisite

songwriting.
"C'mon Miracle," her third proper full-length, hap-

pily doesn't stray far from the strengths of the first two,
falling perhaps somewhere in between them in terms of
tone. In fact, some of these tunes feel so familiar that I
could have sworn I'd heard them before. Partly because
this is easily her most self-assured release yet, I'm pret-

Iy

sure that even folks who haven't heard her earlier

"Nobody Has to

contrast to the
bombastic opening epic of "Advisory Committee."
"Cold, Cold Water," follows with a delicately plucked
guitar eventually joined by quietly moaning strings
while Mirah pleas for compassion in a lonely world.
The slightly more rocking "Jerusalem" expands that
plea from the personal to geopolitical level, while
"The Light" broadens it even further, with what seems
to be a direct address to the divine: "[We'll] tremble

will live in peace." This opening triptych, gradually
growing in intensity, sets a strikingly diverse sonic
palette for such an unassuming record, and it is just a
foretaste of the loveliness that is to follow.
The luscious "Don't Die in Me," for instance, navigates between lilting indie-folk and an intoxicating
samba groove. "We're Both So Sorry," another standout, opens with a few spare autoharp strums under,
then adds trombone choir and some wispy doubletracked vocals before exploding into a sublimely surreal cavalcade of dubby distorted clicks punctuated
with psychedelic flutes, as the lyrics progress from
straightforward nostalgic melancholy to a barrage of
rather rancorous one-liners and deftly woven monarchical imagery. Similar 10-fi trickery (the production
hallmark of Phil Elvirum, aka Mr. Microphone), as
well as marimba, harp and accordion, pop up elsewhere in the album. They serve always to embellish
and never to detract from the deceptive simplicity of
the songs, many of which are among Mirah's best yet.
Probably the most consistent of her albums to date,
along
it's also more cohesive than you might expect
with her marvelous voice, her delicate acoustic guitar
work on almost every track helps maintain unity. And
it's concise, with just 11 songs clocking in at 36
minutes.
Perhaps because of her understated, nuanced
approach, and the range of emotions and themes she
addresses, Mirah's albums, though always more than
simply collections of songs, tend to feel like progress
reports rather than definitive statements. It may be
that she will never release a single, indisputable "masterpiece" (though eventually historicizing consensus is
bound to designate one, because that's the way rockcritdom
and fandom works). When you get down
to it, there's something rather cold and impersonal in
and that's the antithesis of
the masterpiece idea
Mirah's music. At this rate, though, it's just as likely
that she'll never release an album that's less than
completely worthy of exploration.

as much an illusion
as a Maxim girl's

in our line of sight
the street was nothing more than an ordinary strip of
seedy bars, delis and Dunkin' Donuts. And so we learned
that this trip would be not only about showing off our stylistic devices, but observing and navigating the fashion
avenues outside our familiar closets.
Ripped from the pages of our sordid diaries, what follows is an account of the discoveries, sightings and
epiphanies in our quest for fashion enlightenment.

Lilli: I bought a hat. I rock.
Annie: It is not clear if Lilli found the black fedora hat
or if the black fedora hat found Lilli, but it was obvious
they were meant to be. It was hanging rakishly on the
rack at Stella Dallas, a Village vintage store in the true
sense of the word. "Vintage" is not synonymous with
Trinity Church-style thrift clothing. As opposed to a coffee-stained Hard Rock Cafe sweatshirt, "vintage" is evocative of a certain bygone era
pieces like a 1930s evening
gown or a 1960s minidress. History, unfortunately, does
not come cheap, so we also rooted through the bargain

beer bottles. To my left, another pile of beer bottles.
Realized that, although requisite for spring break,
memory loss is not the stuff memories are made of.
Realized that something must be done. What, we reasoned, would be a more sobering experience than the
Museum of Natural History at 10 in the morning? As long
as Lilli could bring her hat, we were gold.
The "third-grade field trip look," diminutive backpacks
and plastic watches, was clearly popular, and the museum's campy displays provided us with a glimpse into The
Clothes Before Time. Loincloths were big, as was abundant
body hair and the sexy sloping forehead. With the advent
of pants (c. 30,000 8.C.E.) the concept of modesty was
invented, and it wasn't long before Cro-Magnon Man's
superior quality clothing gave him the edge he needed to
drive the Neandertals into extinction. This much, anyway,
we speculated based on the graphic dioramas.
As I rode the subway to miss my flight out of the city, I
reflected on the whirlwind of the past few days. Like the
evolution of fashion be it in the Paleolithic or modern
it seems that, oftentimes, the learning is in the jourage
ney. New York may not have brought us to fashion nirvana, but it did bring us a little farther down that proverbial catwalk. And that's something Lilli will tip her hat to.

Valerie Hollister's "Recent Paintings and Prints," at the
List Gallery until March 28, shows how fast computer technology has moved over the last 20 years. Her silk screens
and paintings are pixelated landscapes and motifs from
nature. The squares are filled in with the bright colors of a
Corel Draw type of palette. She reuses patterns in more
than one canvas, filling them in with different color combinations. Each painting places us before a vibrant virtual
reality
tree branches overhead, a garden bench or a
hillock overlooking a field or a lake.
Hollister's work shot me back to the 'Bos. Back then the

computer-processed world seemed less real than the physical world. Hues on the computer screen were limited to an
elementary color wheel. Virtual images were hardly realistic. Shadows and three-dimensionality were nonexistent.
Although computer images were rough, their uncharted
territory was electrifying and modern. Pixels signified the
new computer-mediated reality into which we were moving.
By now, computer art and virtual reality are well
accepted in the art world. Two artists that jumped to my
mind while wandering through Hollister's digitized worlds
were painter Chuck Close and video artist Sadie Benning.
Chuck Close currently has an exhibition at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Since the '7os,
he has created grand portraits of the faces of his friends
and family by dividing the pictures up into small square
units that he paints individually with a rainbow of colors.
Close's show at the Met focuses on his methods, which,
like Hollister's, include silk-screening and hand painting.
Though Close claims that his segmentation has nothing to
do with technology, the effect on 21st century viewers is
undeniable. We see pixels.
In 1989, Sadie Benning started using a Fisher-Price
PXL-2000 camera to create the impression of a film diary in
her music video. The video told the story of her coming of
age as a lesbian woman. The grainy black-and-white
Pixelvision images filtered her life through a screen of
artificiality. They echoed the fragmentation of her own
identity and the world in which we live.
I don't think we even realize how much the computer
has changed the way we experience the world. Our middle
school teachers cared more about words-per-minute than

how to form a capital 'Q' in cursive. We played solitaire on
our computer screens instead of with cards. Our parents
had to tell us to get off Instant Messenger, not the phone.
We shop on dot-com's more often than in malls. We grew
up with and on computers.
Computer graphics have come a long way since our
childhoods. The video games we play and the computeranimated movies today have incredible three-dimensionality and light and texture effects. You can practically see
through the pixels on the screens.
To our generation, Hollister's work might seem a little

outmoded. Why is she still using the grainy pixels of the
'80s? Her paintings are nostalgic for a moment when the
pixel signified the new. For a moment in the 'Bos,
"Pixelvision" freshly expressed the fragmentation and
technological mediation we were experiencing in our postmodern, technologically accelerating society.
Hollister's work reminds us that, though the pixels are
getting smaller, they are still there. In 2004, we can have
lifelike virtual sex, virtual war, virtual friends and virtual
shopping trips, but, if we zoom in, they are just as constructed as Hollister's coarsely pixelated worlds.

us imagine spring break to be alcoholsoaked, bikini-laden, MTV-style beach parties, many
Swatties do it differently. I set out to find how students destressed during their 10 days of freedom.
The members of a cappella group 16 Feet journeyed
down to Florida for the week. The group spent three days
in Fort Lauderdale at a hotel on the beach. They then rented a van and drove to the Florida Keys, where they stayed
at an island resort. "We chilled out, we did some singing,"
Jesse Young 'O5 said. "We mainly laid out on the beach and
ate great seafood."
The group brought its music to retirees at the Boca
Teeca Lodge, as well as to the streets of Key West and
Fort Lauderdale. "It was a really relaxing time," Young
said. "I think that's what we were looking for
a chance
to get away from Swat stress and lay out and bake in the
sun."
New York City provided spring break memories for
Ryan Croken 'O5. Croken, who hails from New Jersey,
missed his bus home one late night. "I had to spend the
night wandering around New York," he said. "I got tired,
so I went to Port Authority [Bus Terminal] with the intention of sleeping." Croken said he instead sat in the terminal talking to "a prophet" and a homeless person who
asked him crude things. "He gave me some nice-smelling
oil. I also traded a bunch of jellybeans for a wax statue of
Jay-Z," Croken said.
Athletes were lucky enough to travel to warmer climates for a few days of training, relaxing and team bond-

expenses.
The track team traveled south to Florida for nine days.
Twenty-four students and four coaches flew down to
Jacksonville, where they practiced on the Jacksonville
University track and ran on local trails. "It was a lot of
intense working out," runner An Bui 'O5 said. "Everyone
who was there was there to work hard."

For the second portion of the trip, the team competed at

Florida A&M in Tallahassee. During their leisure hours,
the team spent quality time together. "We did a lot of chilling in the hot tub or the pool," Bui said. "We went to the
beach for two days. It was a lot of fun."
"The temperature was a lot nicer," Wee Chua 'O6 said.
"It was in the 70s on the beach at Jacksonville."
Similarly, the men's tennis team traveled to
California for six days to bask in the sun and compete
against several West Coast teams. They played the
University of California at Berkeley's B team, winning 6-

L They also beat Sonoma State 5-4 and lost to UC Santa
Cruz (7-0) and UC Davis (8-1). "It was great," Sam Sidhu
'O7 said.
In between games, the team went sightseeing. "One day
we went to [San Francisco]," Justin Durand 'O5 said. "We
walked from Union Square through Chinatown and to
Fisherman's Wharf and took some pictures on the Golden
Gate Bridge. Then we went on a short hike to the top of a
small mountain and climbed on a few rocks and took some
cool pictures."
Many others indulged their tourist sides. Michelle Lo
'O4 spent six days in Las Vegas with two quadmates.
Though Lo is 21, she did "very minimal gambling. None of
us really know how to gamble, but we played a little bit of

slots and a little bit of roulette."
The rest of the time was spent shopping, tanning and
relaxing at the hotel pool. "We wanted to have lots of fun,
because it was our last spring break, and so we thought
Vegas would be really cool," Lo said. "We did the usual partying stuff. It was really fun to spend time with your
friends on your last spring break." The price also drew
them to Las Vegas, with hotel and airfare costing only $4OO
per person for a week.
Candice Cherk 'O7 and two of her friends were also
attracted to a low-cost, fun spring break. Their group spent
five days in New York City. "I figured I'd rather spend $350
to go and have fun in New York than buy a plane ticket
back home to San Francisco," she said. They visited the
customary sights, including the Empire State Building,
SoHo, Fifth Avenue, Little Italy and Chinatown. "I had a
great time on the trip," Cherk said. "I'd been to New York
before, but it was the first time I'd toured around and got
a sense of New York life."

Clearlake and the Decemberists

@

the Khyber

Unabashedly literary Northwestern post-folk traditionalists the Decemberists have
written songs responding to Irish poet Thomas Kinsella and Brooklyn novelist Myla
Goldberg, but Charles Dickens is probably a more telling stylistic reference point for
their crafty, sometimes macabre, sometimes poignant, always delightful story-songs.
UK's Clearlake, meanwhile, are the kind of band best described with active adjectives
like driving, soaring, stirring and sweeping (though I guess literary and traditionalist
work, too, and sometimes poignant and macabre).

Ask nicely
The recent Animal Rights Coalition initiative to
stop Sharpies from serving veal is a good example of
the unfortunately way activist organizations sometimes approach their dealings with those running the
college, assuming a prior adversarial relationship

with the administration. The ARC developed a
detailed plan for an informational campaign in order
to meet the institutional requirement of a fifty percent
signature rate on a student body petition to force
Dining Services to change its menu. Then, they found
Linda McDougall was willing to change the menu voluntarily after a single e-mail.
ARC should be commended not only for taking ini-

tiative, of course, but for also conscientiously taking
the preparatory step of petitioning an institution's
leader directly before mounting a popular campaign
against that institution. Still, we feel there was wasted
effort in planning a popular, oppositional campaign to
force Sharpies into eliminating veal from the menu that
wasn't needed. The process would have been much
shorter had they begun by approaching those in charge
of Sharpies rather than assuming a lengthy campaign
would be needed. The e-mail to Linda McDougall should
have been step one instead of a just-in-case formality.
It is true that those with radical views must expect
to spend time and energy converting the general public to their point of view, and that authority figures,
whose jobs often require them to be conservative and
cautious about change, often take the most time and
energy to convince. Even so, people in charge of institutions are human beings with principles just like the
rest of us, and the Swarthmore administration, despite
occasional clashes with students, has a history of caring about its ethical obligations to a greater degree
than many other schools'.
This isn't to say that change will always come easily
by asking nicely. But students should understand that
administrators aren't cautious just for the perverse joy
of resisting change. They have a responsibility to represent the desires of all members of the community, and
often it takes time for the majority to convert to a social
cause. On many issues, though, such as the case against
veal, the objections of dissenters to a policy do clearly
outweigh the majority's reasons for acquiescence, and
administrators are capable of seeing this fact and acting
on it.
Seeking social change still won't be easy, but it could

become easier than it is now, and relationships between
activist groups and administrators could be much
smoother and more productive, if, more often, students
gave administrators the benefit of the doubt and tried
the cooperative solutionfirst.

Rethink withholding money
Dear Editor:
I was sorry to see the letter by
Elliot Reed 'O3 ("Alum Won't Donate,"
Feb. 26, pg. 15). He was obviously
upset by the comments of Anna
Perng 'O3, but I don't understand how
that translates into denying financial
support to the college. It seems to me
that, regardless of her views, Anna
Perng is Anna Perng and not the
spokesperson for Swarthmore. I'm
also not sure that Swarthmore's
political climate is substantially
more "monolithic" than at other
institutions, and certainly political
climate is a fluid dynamic that
changes with time. Broad generalizations can be misleading. The statis-

tics I have seen of Swarthmore's student body speak to me of socioeconomic diversity, which must reflect a
diversity of viewpoints as well.
But to the point, I would ask Reed
if he received anything "special" from
his time at Swarthmore, something
that has to do with the nature of what
Swarthmore is, over and above its
function as just another college.
Perhaps he needs something to compare it to. I have the dubious honor of

having attended classes at a total of
six
universities.
colleges
or
Unfortunately for me, Swarthmore
was not one of them. But I have had
enough exposure to Swarthmore to
know that, in comparison, the

Swarthmore experience

can be something “special.” I do regret that this

college could not have been on my
“list,” because I can see from personal experience the positive differences

it offers.
So, if Reed can say that he did get
something

“special”

from

his

Swarthmore experience, I would hope
that he wouldreconsider his decision
not to support the college. If he cannot
say that that is so, then I am sincerely
sorry and I wish he could have attended classes with me elsewhere so that
he could have seen the differences
with me.

Violent proesters ignore pro-life principles
Dear Editor:
As a Christian who strongly opposes abortion, I was sad
to see the article on the shocking actions ofprotesters outside the Philadelphia Planned Parenthood clinic ("Amid
protesters, students escort at women's clinic," March 4, pg.
5). The man with his wagon of children should find more
Christian ways of being a "soldier for Christ." I think I
speak for many pro-life people at Swarthmore and around
the country in saying that hatred and assault of pregnant
women cannot be reconciled with pro-life principles.

Those outside the clinic appear to act out of hatredrather
than love. These people would rather frighten and rage
than help the women entering such clinics to find healthier and more humanitarian methods of coping with an
unplanned pregnancy. The pro-life movement is not about
fear, but care for both the mother and the child. Hopefully

those marching outside abortion clinics will come to real-

ize this and instead work toward finding a feasible, and
necessary, alternative to abortion.

Muhammad was not one of

PATRICK HART

Drawing
will probably end up like
Timothy McVeigh, executed
with solid popular support. Indeed, what would death penalty
foes have to complain about? Muhammad is clearly guilty, he is
an adult, he is sane and, while in many capital punishment cases
there is concern about racial discrimination, Muhammad's
crimes are so atrocious that he would likely have received the
death penalty no matter what his ethnicity. There is no reason
left to oppose Muhammad's execution, right?
Wrong. While the arguments against the death penalty
based on the possibility ofinnocent people dying or on racism
are important, the most fundamental case against the death
penalty has always been the very simple truth that to kill
another human being is wrong. The arguments about innocence and racial discrimination, compelling though they are,
can have the dangerous effect of creating the impression that
the death penalty would be OK if racism disappeared and we
were 100 percent sure that everyone on death row was guilty.
Perhaps someday we will reach a point where we have a per-,
feet judicial system, but the death penalty would be just as
wrong then as it is now.
Although capital punishment has a long history in
America, one can see a clear case against it in some very old,
deeply held American principles. The Constitution's Eighth
Amendment forbids "cruel and unusual punishment." While
courts have usually rejected the argument that the Eighth
Amendment forbids the death penalty, one can see in the prohibition on excessively cruel treatment of convicts a recognition that all people, even the worst criminals, have some
inherent dignity and worth that should not be taken away by
the government. The Declaration of Independence's decree of
equality and the 13th Amendment's abolition of slavery both
suggest a belief that all people have dignity that should not be
denied them under any circumstances.
What about the argument that the death penalty is unpleasant but that society sometimes needs to use capital punishment to defend itself
the argument that some criminals are
so dangerous that executing them is the only way to prevent
them from being a danger to society again? That argument
does not hold water when you consider that the usual alternative to the death penalty for hardened murderers is life in
prison. It would be difficult for John Allen Muhammad and
Timothy McVeigh to pose a threat to society if they were in
maximum-security prisons, wouldn't it?
Arguing against the death penalty is not popular these
days. A 2003 Gallup poll showed 74 percent supported executing convicted murderers. Michael Dukakis was the last majorparty candidate to oppose the death penalty, and, just four
years after Dukakis ran, Bill Clinton highlighted his support
for capital punishment by taking a break from the campaign
trail to preside over the execution of a mentally retarded murderer. The politically expedient thing to do today is to highlight the problems with the death penalty system and call for

The politically expedient thing to do is not always the right
thing to do, though, and, in this case, the right thing to do is to
clearly and unflinchingly proclaim that the death penalty is
wrong. It is easy to oppose the death penalty when the person
who is to be executed is mentally retarded, or could be innocent, or is a victim of racial discrimination. It is not so easy to
oppose the death penalty when the person who is to be executed is someone who is truly evil. It is those difficult cases,
though, that give our society the opportunity to show that it
can rise above its vengeful instincts and affirm that there is
dignity in all people.

“That’s panhandling.

I catch you again, I’ll throw you in jail.”
“Can I play without my case open? It’s not for the
money, I’d really just like to make some music in the
park here.”
“No. If we let you do it, then everyone will.”
Oh, the horror. Imagine the chaos and destruction
that would result from weekly musical gatherings in a
park where impromptu bands would provide free
entertainment for anyone who wanted to listen. Surely
the result would be the complete breakdown of law
and order.
"There's a Starbucks over there. Sometimes the
owner lets people play out front. If he lets you, you can,
because that's private property."
This is not fiction. The only place one can legally
perform outside in Santa Fe is in front of a Starbucks,
and then only if the owner of the Starbucks approves
and they have final veto power over what sort of music
you can play, where you can stand and what instruments you can use.
"Thanks for your help, officer. I'll just be on my way."
Santa Fe is not the worst. Flagstaff, Ariz., has a law
against standing in one place on the sidewalk for more
than five minutes. These laws may seem nonsensical at
first, but placed within the context of urban gentrifica-

tion they gain a twisted and dystopian logic.
Since the beginning of urbanization, there has been
and sometimes violent
a furious
battle for public
space. The battle has been fought primarily between the
elite, who seek to obtain public space for their own private interests and manufacture the appearance of public space for further levels of consumption, and the rest
of the people, who naturally seek to use public space as
a platform for social engagements.
The funny thing about these spaces is that their
architecture is specifically designed to prevent social
activities. Whereas once parks were graced with oak
trees and grass that provided ample shade and sitting
space, now they are hemmed in by unsittable wroughtiron fences and planted with primarily thorny shrubs
that are specifically designed to prevent the homeless
from taking shelter in the bushes.
Park benches now have bars in the center to make

them impossible to sleep on. The problem of urban homelessness has not been solved, but it has been pushed out
of sight. The social interactions of the homeless and their
allies that once occurred in public spaces has been forced
out to make downtown areas more tourist-friendly and to
cleanse urban areas of anything that might interfere

with the daily workings of consumerist America.

Methodist University, writes, "The police state implied
in all of this might be described, with a certain degree of
irony,

as postmodern

that is, a police state designed to

dominate a world of image, meaning and perception."
Throughout the history of resistance to authority,
the primary battles have occurred over the control of
public space. From the "Free Speech Fights" of the
Industrial Workers of the World (the Wobblies) to the
situationists in Paris to Martin Luther King and his
marches, those seeking social change have started their
struggle by attempting to reclaim the public spaces
where social engagements could occur.
As our public space swiftly disappears into an urban

consumer jungle, we must seek new and innovative
ways to reclaim it as our own and create the social ties
that make change possible.

CAFTA a doorway to exploitation
BY ALEX LEVINE-WEINBERG
alevinel@swarthmore.edu

The Central American Free Trade Agreement, finalized in January, will soon come to a vote in Congress.
Since our Delaware County representative, Curt
Weldon, has yet to form an opinion, it is vital for us to
closely examine the issue. Linking the economies of the
United States, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, CAFTA would accelerate the
"race to the bottom" in labor and environmental standards here and in Central America. Free trade is not
inherently bad, but CAFTA, based on the failed NAFTA
model, contains serious flaws that would undermine
labor rights, environmental standards and general wellbeing in the United States and Central America.
CAFTA's provisions open labor and export markets
for large corporations without considering the consequences for ordinary workers. In many countries,
including the United States, agricultural production is
subsidized to ensure food for the population and adequate pay for small-scale farmers. However, according
to Article 3.13 of CAFTA, "The Parties share the objective of the multilateral elimination of export subsidies
[to] prevent
for agricultural goods and shall work
their reintroduction in any form." Additionally, under
Article 8.2, Paragraph L "A Party may apply a safeguard
measure for no longer than four years. Regardless of
its duration, such measure shall terminate at the end of
the transition period [i.e., within 5-20 years]." As agriculture constitutes such a large portion of employment
in Central America (60 percent in Guatemala, for example), these measures would be disastrous.
Small farmers in Central America would face the
extinction of their livelihoods at the hands of U.S.
agribusiness. Many workers would be forced out of the
agricultural sector and into the cities, increasing competition for industrial jobs. Any jobs created by U.S.
corporations' exploitation of Central America's vast
labor markets would at best pay subsistence wages.
...

...

March 18, 2004

CAFTA does not require parties to increase labor standards but merely prohibits lowering of their current
standards. But those existing standards are brutally
unfair to the point of halting the formation of labor
unions. This injustice can be remedied only through
built-in multilateral labor standards, designed to
ensure workers' rights and wages adequate to provide
for basic needs.
Additionally, the environmental standards provided
in the agreement are atrocious. The wording makes it
impossible to enforce any universal environmental
standard. For instance, Article 17.4, Paragraph, 1 reads,
"... each Party shall
encourage the development and use
of incentives and voluntary mechanisms ..." to promote
better environmental standards. The lack of enforcement mechanisms, coupled with Central America's
existing poor environmental standards, exacerbates an
already awful situation.
Perhaps the most frightening element of CAFTA is
Chapter 10, Section B, which contains its investor suit
rules, modeled on NAFTA's Chapter 1L Foreign
investors would gain broad rights and privileges that
do not exist under U.S. law, enabling them to challenge
environmental laws and regulations in extralegal international tribunals.
Under NAFTA, both Mexico and Canada have lost
Chapter 11 challenges to environmental protections,
and the United States faces environmentally related
suits totaling over $1 billion. In Central America, the
mere threat of such costly suits could keep the countries from adopting environmental laws.
CAFTA, secretly negotiated, provides the most favorable conditions possible for U.S. investors in Central
America without correcting for market excesses. The
parties are not held to a uniform standard in labor rights
and environmental protection. And unless governments
retain the ability to protect their economies from market
fluctuations, millions will be doomed to dire poverty.
CAFTA violates the basic humanity of Central
Americans in the name of corporate profits.

He threw down the gauntlet of that great cultural rebirth.
Years later, Dußois' followers, the Talented Tenth, instigated the "Garvey Must Go!" movement, which cast the

Tenth usurped the Harlem Renaissance. As house Negroes
masquerading as New Negroes, they reduced the New
Negro archetype to the house Negro stereotype. The Harlem

civilizations is a pipe dream.
At least these observations are so if Richard Wright and
Ralph EUison, the two greatest black American novelists to
date, truly portrayed the black man of 20th-century North
America. Wright's opus, "Native Son," portrayed him as a
field Negro updated to the city slum. Ellison's only opus,
"Invisible Man," portrayed him as a house Negro updated to
the modern metropolis. They doomed the black man to the
field Negro and house Negro stereotypes, for they failed to
envision his will to power, up from slavery to manly selfreliance. That they were being realistic given the context of
mid-20th-century America is the usual reply to these criticisms. I do not accept that apology.
Garvey, a full generation before, had envisioned the

into the house Negro black bourgeoisie.
Taking the Dußoisian rather than Garveyite Harlem

Renaissance as his point of departure, Ellison created an
impotent hero utterly passive and weak, with neither name
nor identity. His "invisible man" is the house version of
Marginal Man. He hates whitey, but his deepest and most
intense hatred is reserved for the black man who refuses
marginality, who is very visible indeed. Motivated by
resentment and envy of black power, Ellison used his novel
to caricature Garvey as the black supremacist clown, Ras
the Destroyer. He constructed his main character as a hapless victim. He deconstructed the New Negro demigod as a
field Negro buffoon. Here we see Ellison picking up where
Dußois had left off, for it is Dußois, in all his mulatto glory,
who had once described Garvey as fat, black and ugly.
Wright, another Dußoisian disciple, similarly dismissed Garvey. Otherwise, he might have created a hero

March 18, 2004

worthy of the black man's aspirations and ideals. As a
member of the Niggerati, he created a white man's monster no less destructive than Frankenstein's monster. He
named him Bigger Thomas. If Ellison's house Negro protagonist is invisible, Wright's field Negro protagonist is
monstrous. The classical hero, the tragic hero and the
quixotic hero, all driven by ideals, commit deeds which
fundamentally challenge the status quo. Invariably, the
creator of such a hero is a visionary idealist. But Wright
was a "realist." Thus, he created a monster driven by fear,
whose great deed, which he commits out of panic, is the
murder of a young white woman. Bigger Thomas' great
deed, emotional to the core, is accidental. But the hero's
great deed, always volitional, is deliberate. Ellison's house
Negro is invisible. Wright's field Negro is accidental. Both
are marginal. The New Negro is monumental.
Unlike Garvey, who appealed to black self-respect,
Wright and Ellison, like Dußois before them, appealed to
white sympathy. The white supremacist approves
Invisible Man and Bigger Thomas, for he pities them.
These pitiful quasi-heroes flatter his superiority complex.
He prefers Dußoisian victimhood to Garveyite manhood.
A biblical Proverb states: "Where there is no vision, the
people perish." Greeks have the larger-than-life vision of
Achilles and Odysseus. White Americans have the largerthan-life vision of Captain Ahab and Huckleberry Finn.
Black Americans have the smaller-than-life realism and
surrealism of Bigger Thomas and Invisible Man, respectively. Until we aspire to Garvey's larger-than-life vision of
the New Negro, that is, until we rise up from slavery to PanAfrica, we shall not so slowly, and all too surely, perish.

Descending
into Madness
Ah, March. Probably the best sports month of the year. Or
maybe it just seems that way, since it follows February, the
worst sports month of the year. But March has a lot going for
it besides its crappy undercard. The professional basketball
and hockey seasons have evolved into full-fledged playoff
races. In the NBA East, the big question is how many sub-.500
teams are gonna make the playoffs. We're calling four,
Milwaukee, Cleveland, New
York and Miami. In the NBA
West, it's the usual clash of
the titans, with only two-anda-half games separating the
current three through six
seeds. This playoff season
looks to be a classic.
hockey's
Meanwhile,
been riding waves of bad
publicity en route to its highest public profile in years.
But you know what? There's

BEN WHARTON

90% Half Mental

no such thing as bad publicity. We mean, gee, hockey
sure is violent. And, gee, no
one likes a cheap shot punch
to the side of the head. But as
long as pundits both inside

and outside the sports world
continue to comment on a
sport most of them never watch and know nothing about,
they'll just continue to show their own ignorance. Hopefully
now that hockey's in the news, people will finally watch some
games and realize the transcendence that is playoff hockey.
March also means baseball's right around the corner.
Every team has hope of some sort. Maybe the rookies live up
to their minor-league stats. Maybe the veterans get their
careers back on track. The games are played in Florida, and
no one's really keeping score. And then the season starts,
and the games are played in places like Detroit and
Philadelphia where it's 40 degrees on April 5, and the rookies get sent back to the farm shell-shocked and the veteran
pulls a groin. So, cherish baseball in March as well.
But there's one colossal reason that March rules the sports
calendar. The one, the only, the obvious, the Madness. The
brackets and the Cinderellas. The Sweet 16 and the Elite
Eight. And the flurry of research and prayer that goes into
predicting the brackets. It's truly like nothing else in sports.
So now it's our job to try to call this baby. We're gonna
preface this by saying that this is basically a glorified crapshoot. There are so many games, and the parity level in college basketball is at an all-time high. So here goes. We'll run
it down by regional starting with St. Louis. We're gonna go
conservative here and put number-one seed Kentucky in the
Final Four, beating Georgia Tech in the Elite Eight. Our spoiler here's gonna be Nevada, a 10-seed, who we have beating
Gonzaga in the second round (mostly because we hate
Gonzaga). In the East Rutherford regional, we're gonna go
with the two-seed Oklahoma State beating Wake Forest to get
a Final Four berth. We like Saint Joe's, but we don't see them
getting past the Demon Deacons. In Phoenix, we're gonna go
ahead and go a little ACC crazy: North Carolina State over
Maryland in the round of eight, avenging their loss in that
instant classic ACC tournament match from just a week ago.

Stanford we hate, so they're out to Alabama in the second
round. We don't see Emeka Okafor staying healthy for UConn,
so they're done to NC State. And now Atlanta, the most ridiculous bracket of them all. Mike Shoosheffsky, Roy Williams,
Lute Olsen and Rick Pitino in one friggin' regional. You all
know our feelings on Dook, so let's kill them off in the Sweet
16. We bleed Carolina blue, but this year ain't the Heels' year.
Lotsa talent, but no bench and a weak D. Texas goes 10 deep,
so they'll outman the Heels in the second round. So who
escapes Atlanta? The Cinderella. This year's Syracuse.
Illinois. With this year's Carmelo Anthony. Dee Brown. We
think this is just wacky enough to work. Out of the powerhouse bracket will come the unheralded lUini. So now, the
Final Four. Kentucky, OK State, NC State and Illinois. Who
wins it all? Cinderella does. Illinois over Kentucky on April 5
in San Antonio.

Baseball struggles over break
BY MATT SCHILLER

mschilll@swarthmore.edu

Baseball season got underway during spring break as
the Garnet took on some of the country's top teams in Fort
Myers, Fla. The team dropped all five games it played,
surrendering 58 runs during the week while crossing the
plate only 11 times. Swarthmore also faltered in the field,
totaling 16 errors over the course of the week.
The Garnet Tide started a different lineup in each
game and the lack of team chemistry was evident. "With
so many new faces, the record isn't an indication of what
the team can do. The trip was more for camaraderie and
to get the guys playing together," coach Frank Agovino
said. "We just have to keep hitting, keep swinging and
score some more runs. The defense was as good an infield

defense as we've seen in a long time."
In the season opener last Monday, Worcester
Polytechnic Institute beat the Tide 14-5. Chris Rose 'O5 led
the offense with a three-run homer, and second basemen
lan Adelstein 'O7 added two singles, going two-for-four on
the day. Jared Leiderman 'O5 took the loss after giving up
six earned runs and striking out three batters in four
innings of work.
In their second game of the day, the Garnet fell 15-3
against Eastern Nazerene. Sam Faeder 'O7 had a triple, an
RBI and a run scored, and Carlton Davis 'O4 doubled to
provide the offense the Tide. In his first career start, Noah
Cooper-Harris 'O7 allowed seven runs, four of which were
earned, in three innings.
"We didn't play any slouches. Everybody we played
was good. They'd probably all be playoff teams in the conference," Agovino said. "I think we fared pretty well."
On Tuesday, Swarthmore lost its third game in a row,
as opposing pitcher John Elsen pitched a one-hit shutout
to lead Wilmington College of Ohio to an 11-0 victory. Sam
Faeder 'O7 broke up the no-hitter with a seventh-inning
March 18. 2004

single. The Garnet got a strong relief appearance from
pitcher Jacob Anguiano 'O7, who struck out four and gave
up just three runs in four and one-third innings.
The Garnet showed improvement on Wednesday in a
12-3 loss to Clark. They trailed 4-2 and were in position

into close the gap before the Clark offense blew the game
open in an eight-run sixth inning. Matt Goldstein 'O4 lost
his first appearance of the year while striking out five
batters and allowing four runs in five innings. Faeder continued to look good at the plate going 2-5 with a double and
a run scored.
The Garnet Tide remain optimistic despite their slow
start. "We have been working hard over the off season,
and we're starting to come together," said Faeder.
Swarthmore rounded out the week on Thursday when
it fell 6-0 to Illinois College. Leiderman fell to 0-2 for the
season despite a solid five-inning stretch in which he
allowed only two earned runs and notched three strikeouts. Davis was strong out of the bullpen, pitching his sec-

ond scoreless inning of the season. The offense stumbled,
mustering only six hits, but Faeder singled to increase his
hit streak to four games.

"We just need everything to come together,"
Leiderman said. "In some games, the pitching fell
through, and in some the hitting or fielding fell through.
To win against good teams, you need all three. I definitely
think that's going to come. That's what spring training's
for, to see what works and what doesn't."
The Garnet Tide's Tuesday game against Neumann
College and their Wednesday home opener versus
Lincoln College were both postponed due to inclement
weather.
"The freshmen were a bright spot, with Sam Faeder,
lan Adelstein and Noah Cooper-Harris in the infield,"
Agovino said. "We also saw some real good pitching performances. The group is real focused and working very
hard as hard a working group as we've ever had."

At number-two doubles, Sara

match
Carnegie Mellon, we came out

didn't let them into the match at

all of the games. We were very on

The following day, the team
traveled to Salisbury University.
The doubles teams started out
very strong, gathering a 3-0 lead
early on. Number-one Reddy and
Reynolds, ranked fourth in the
region, smoked the 13th-ranked
team of Sam Coldren and Erika

defeat Cassie

Rosier 8-5.
"We hadn't played together
since the fall, and we were losing
at the beginning of the match, but
we came back by using I-formation and Australian doubles to
win the match," Sargent said.
"We were the last match of the
day, so everyone was cheering to
get us through the harder

points."
"They were down four to zero,
but they did a great job of coming
back and staying positive," coach
Jeremy

Loomis said. "Once we

talked about what kinds of adjustments had to be made, they started winning some games and gaining some confidence." At numberthree doubles, Pao and Emily

Townsend 'O6 glided past their
opponents 8-L
"At Salisbury, we did not come
out as strong as at Carnegie
Mellon. We were not on top of our
games for the first part of the
match, until we decided to
change up our tactics," Sargent
said. "At Carnegie Mellon, we
just dominated. At Salisbury,
coming back to win was a question of increased communication
and changing up strategy," she

said.

On the singles side, Reddy
knocked off Coldren, 6-2,6-1, while

Reynolds defeated Rosier 6-1, 6-1
at the number-four spot. At number-three singles, Pao breezed
Mitry 6-1, 6-2, and Marissa
Matthews 'O7 topped Smiles 6-2, 63 at number-five. Townsend was a
6-3, 6-0 winner over Lowe at number-six, closing out the match.
"Since Salisbury is ranked
three spots lower than us, it was
an important match to do well in.
It was our first match outside, so
we had to deal with the wind and
sun, which took some adjustment.
We are at a good point to be at,
doing so well, especially at the
beginning of the season," Loomis
said.
"We are still trying to figure
out our team, which is nice,
because it is still early in our season," Reddy said. "It is great to be
doing so well early on, and we
plan to continue projecting forward, although we will concentrate on taking one match at a
time and improving as we go. We

won decisively at some tough
matches, and we plan to build on
that."

Students bring TOPSoccer program to campus
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu

Ryan Kuker 'O6 didn't think it was fair.
In a recreation league a few years ago, he
overheard a disabled athlete ask his
mother why he couldn't play in the soccer
game as he watched his brother on the
field.
The conversation hit home for Kuker,
a soccer player since the age of 5. Feeling
privileged to have had opportunities to
play and train under dedicated coaches,
Kuker wanted to give something back.
"It's a little cliched, but I do believe
that 'to whom much is given, much shall
be required,'" he said. He started doing

research on youth athletics and disabilities. But without a coaching license,
Kuker could not start his own soccer
camp. So he contacted his state soccer
association, NJYSA, and became involved
with The Outreach Program for Soccer, or
TOPSoccer, a branch program of United
States Youth Soccer Association. During
the summer of 2003, Kuker coached 15 athletes in the TOPSoccer summer program
in Whitehouse Station, N.J.
According to the program's mission
statement, "TOPSoccer gives young people
with disabilities a unique chance to play
soccer and have fun in a supportive, caring
coaching environment." TOPSoccer aims
to build motor skills, promote self-esteem,
learn teamwork and let the kids have fun
playing a great game.
THE PHOENIX

The demand for athletic programs for
disabled youths is high, according to
Kuker. Pennsylvania, one of the founding
states of TOPSoccer, has approximately 15
programs. States that have recently adopted the program, such as New Jersey, have
only two programs. "There are so many

athletes that would want to participate if
more programs existed and if they knew
about it," he said.
Many youth disability athletics pro-

grams are run through schools. TOPSoccer
is able to break through that link and provide a community program rather than one
tied to a school club or organization.
"Parents have indicated that they would
like their child to participate in the same
community sports programs as non-disabled
athletes, to wear the same club uniform, to

play on the same fields, and to attend the
same sports banquets," Kuker said.
Kuker

and

Rhiannon

Graybill

'O6

teamed up this fall to bring TOPSoccer to
Swarthmore. "I got involved because I was
talking to Ryan over the summer, and he
told me how exciting the program was, and
I thought it sounded like a worthwhile program.," she said.
With help from college funds, the duo

began to mold the programs. "We have

received invaluable support from the Lang
Center, the athletic department, and defi-

nitely the Ridley United Soccer Club for
helping with the implementation of the
program at Swat," Kuker said.
The program sprang to life this Monday

with the beginning of volunteer training.
Fellow Swatties attended one of three coaching sessions to learn the ropes of coaching
disabled athletes. Eighteen volunteers have
signed up to coach the 20 athletes in the program. The program will run for six weeks,
and athletes' ages range from 8 to 13 years.
Graybill and Kuker see the program as a
great opportunity for the athletes and vol-

unteers.
"It's something active and fun and

something they've watched but not participated in. It's something they can do. It's a
program tailored to their needs," Graybill
said. During sessions, athletes of all abilities participate in soccer drills, relay races
and obstacle courses.
Volunteers will also benefit from spend-

ing time with the athletes. Sebastian

Indacochea 'O6 has volunteered with youth
sports in the past. "It's a good cause. I was
a little league soccer coach for five years in
my hometown. I got a lot of inspiration
from my high school teachers," he said.
"For the volunteers, we want to dispel
some of the myths about young athletes
with disabilities," Kuker said. "We also
want to encourage some of them to contin-

ue working with youth athletics and dis-

abilities in soccer and other sports."
"I think the volunteers will have a lot
of fun and interact with special-needs
kids. It's the perfect study break. Instead
of doing manual labor, you are playing
soccer and having fun with kids,"
Graybill

March 18, 2004

said.

Kuker credited the positive and teamoriented environment for the program's
popularity
participants.
among

"Throughout the season, we emphasize that
this is a team environment," he said. "At
the end of every session, we bring everyone
in, and we do a cheer. The athletes absolutely love it."
Players who want to enjoy soccer at a
higher ability level have the chance to
"graduate" from TOPSoccer onto a standard youth team. "Over the summer, two
out of the 15 athletes graduated to a local
township's recreation program," Kuker
said. "In essence, we act as a feeder system
to the local programs."
For athletes unable to ever participate
in "standard" town leagues, Kuker hopes to
create a permanent program of TOPSoccer
athletes. "My long-term goals are to establish a PA youth TOPSoccer league, to have
Swarthmore TOPSoccer compete against
another TOPSoccer team in the state," he
said.
Kuker and Graybill hope Swarthmore

TOPSoccer will become a mainstay on campus. "Rhi and I are looking to train coaching volunteers to ensure that the program
is self-sustaining," he said. Graybill added
that they are looking for sustainable
sources of funding as well as dedicated volunteers to help turn over the leadership
throughout the years.
Registration for athletes and the first
practice begin tonight at Lamb-Miller Field

House at 7 p.m.

Men's tennis takes on the West Coast
clash between the historically rancorous rivals served as a

BY MIKE NOREIKA

mnoreikl@swarthmore.edu
The nationally ranked number-19 men's tennis team

left the Philadelphia cold and traveled to northern
California over spring break for some good weather and
outdoor matches. With record-setting heat all week, the
team played four tough matches against some of
California's premier teams.
Despite lingering jet lag, the team took the court in an

informal match against University of California at
Berkeley. With Berkeley's varsity team away for the weekend, Swarthmore players took advantage of playing the
formidable JV team. Frank Visciano 'O4 and Mike Noreika
'O4 led the way in doubles action, winning at the numberone spot. The duo of Brian Park 'O6 and Zac Rodd 'O6 and
the pair of John Reiss 'O7 and Ben Rae 'O4 followed suit
with comfortable victories respectively at the second and
third spots. The team continued its winning ways into the
singles action and lost only one match out of eight. The
final score of the match was 10-2 in favor of Swarthmore.
After a day of San Francisco city sauntering and Napa
wine tasting, the team drove to UC Santa Cruz to take on
the perennial powerhouse Banana Slugs. This Division 111

key match for both sides in terms of national seeding. The
Banana Slugs, by means of a rather terrorizing team mascot, justified their number-five national ranking defeating
Swarthmore 7-0. Reiss and Rae were the only doubles winners at the third spot. Zac Rodd had the number-six
Division 111 player in the country on the ropes but fell in
two demanding sets. Justin Durand 'O5 fared best at sixth
singles by rallying in the second set and forcing a third
and deciding set.
The next day, the team traveled to the third UC school
in a row. Swarthmore sought vengeance the previous day's
loss against Division II UC Davis. Perhaps overwhelmed
by Davis' scholarships and future move to Division I, the
Garnet suffered defeat to this nationally ranked top-20
team. In familiar fashion, Rae and Reiss won at third doubles. Reiss also turned in an estimable performance at second singles, though he fell short of a victory.
The final match of the sardined trip found
Swarthmore traveling into wine country to play Sonoma
State University. Not quite knowing what to expect
against this erratically talented team, the weary Garnet
mustered the energy to overcome their foes. With Rae out
with a sore shoulder, Swarthmore jumped to a 2-1 lead

after crucial wins from number-two and number-three
doubles. Park elevated his game to fill Rae's void and won
in three sets at the number-four singles spot. Justin
Durand, at the number-six spot, rattled off six straight
games to win the match by controlling both his emotions
and his belligerent opponent. With the team score locked
at 4-4, the spotlight centered on Rodd at first singles. The
match looked grim after he lost the first set to his opponent who was coined "the albatross" for his extraordinary arm span.
Fighting exhaustion and enduring heat, Rodd put
together a courageous second set to force a third. With

both teams aware that this set would determine the outcome of the team match, players lined the court and
cheered for every point. In heroic form, Rodd won the
final set and clinched a 5-4 Swarthmore victory. The
excited team celebrated by tossing Reiss into a parking
lot dumpster before heading to the airport.
After the win in Sonoma, the Garnet were more relaxed
than most Californians and looked back east to
Swarthmore. With the heart of the Division 111 season coming up, the team has two weeks of practice to prepare for
their next match; number eight in the nation Washington
and Lee will be in town Saturday, March 27, at 11 a.m.

Women's lacrosse smashes Trinity over break
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The women's lacrosse team
started off their season in stunning fashion over spring break,
trouncing Trinity College of
D.C. 16-3 in its only contest over

the break.
Katie Crawford 'O7 tallied
five scores. Co-captain and last
year's second-team conference

player Jackie Kahn 'O4 put
away three of her 14 shots to
lead the way for the Garnet

Tide on the day. Lindsay Roth
'O7 and Heidi Fieselmann 'O6
also chipped in two goals
apiece to further Swarthmore's

fight.
"We got a really good first
game under our belt," Kahn
said. "Our freshmen had a really strong game also. Lindsay
Roth and Katie Crawford both
played well."
The Tide also turned in a
sterling defensive effort to go
along with their offensive outpouring, allowing only three
goals on 14 total shots, while
winning the ground-ball battle
44-18. Starting keeper Jenn
Hart 'O4 allowed only one goal
on five shots, and Emily
Lowing 'O7 managed six saves
while allowing two tallies.
The Garnet are also scheduled to play non-conference foe
Neumann today at Clothier
Field. They hope to build on
their performance from last
Saturday against the Knights
today. "We haven't played
Neumann before, so we are a
little unsure what to expect,"
Cara Tigue 'O6 said. "We are
focusing on what we have to
do, on us."
Swarthmore will also play
in the 28th annual Seven
Tournament
at
Sisters
Wellesley this weekend, its last
tuneup before conference play
begins against Gettysburg next
Wednesday. Last year, the team
lost its first game to the College
of Notre Dame at Maryland,

18

sending it

into

the

loser's

bracket. The Tide recovered
with two wins over Vassar and
Smith, good enough for a fifthplace finish.

"Our goal for this year is to
be in the championship game,"
Tigue said. "We played well last
year but not as well as we could
have. We really want to make a
statement about Swat lacrosse
at the tournament."
"We might play Haverford in
that tournament, and that
would be a good indicator of
how we can do in the conference," Kahn said. "However the
tournament goes, though, it's
generally a really good indicator of where we are, because its
the type of tournament where
all teams are approximately the

same level. We usually fare
pretty well and expect to do
pretty well this year again."
The Garnet are excited
about entering their conference
season. Gettysburg presents a
tough challenge early on as the
defending
Centennial
Conference champions
and
owners of a perfect 9- 0 record
in conference play last season.
The team is ranked fifth in the
nation.
The Tide are looking forward to challenging the Bullets.
"We are not intimidated by
their record," Tigue said. "We
don't have anything to lose. It's
going to make us better. We
want to compete with them and
improve."

Overall, the team appears
charged and excited about the
start and will look to rely on
both veteran talent and freshman contributions £pr* a sucessful season.
"We have a really strong
freshman class," Tigue said.
"Each of them are going to be
contributors this year. It shows
the direction that our program
is going. We are building on
past success."
The women will face off
Neumann at 5 p.m. tonight.

The women's lacrosse team has a busy schedule ahead of them. This weekend, the team will travel to
Wellesley for the annual Seven Sisters Tournament. When the Garnet return home, they will face Centennial
Conference foe and defending champion Gettysburg.

Diary of a superstar
Chris Rose.

Cal Ripken. These are two names that will forever

be linked.

The reference to Cal Ripken is not completely obvious for
those unfamiliar with Rose’s baseball career. Since his freshman
year, he has sat on the bench for 165 consecutive innings, prompting Rose to label this accomplishment “the greatest streak since
Cal Ripken, Jr.” Rose has always been frustrated by his lack of
playing time, but sitting behind Joe Corso ’02 was nothing to be
ashamed about. This year, he is vying for time at catcher with AllStar Firefighter Clifford Sosin ’04. Last week the baseball team
went to Florida for spring break.
Wins and losses mattered not;
what really was at stake was,
would Rose’s streak continue?
Below is a brief account of what
transpired.

The Garnet softball team spent a sun-filled spring
break in Florida facing off against some of the
nation's top Division 111 teams. Its 1-7 record over the
break does not entirely pay it justice, considering the
tough competition it faced and the games it took
down to the wire.
In their sole victory, the Garnet achieved a monumental first victory defeating 24th-ranked Coe
College 2-L Marianne Klingaman 'O7 captured her
first collegiate win on the mound in a come-from-

behind victory by the Tide.
"It was a well played game, we came from behind

in the fifth inning and played solid defense to finish
it," coach Renee Clarke said. An RBI by Val Marone'
05 in the fifth inning that drove in Danielle Miller 'O6
for the go-ahead run that eventually turned out to be
the game winner.
The Garnet also played ball in two other noteworthy games, although they were unable to add
them to the win column. Against the highest-ranked
team they faced, and in a festival of 7s, the Garnet
took 7th-ranked Cortland down to the wire in a
seven-run game, ultimately falling in the 7th
inning.The Garnet lost 4-3.
Against the University of Massachusetts
Liberal Arts, the squad again took the game into
extra innings but could not pull out the final run
before UMass did in the ninth they lost 5-4. Emily
Remus 'O6 pitched an entire nine innings of solid
throwing to keep the Garnet in the game. The
Garnet managed to tally a legitimate triple play in
the game. After a ground ball was hit to second,
Miller tagged out the runner coming from first base,
and then fired to Christina Procacci 'O6 at home to

confusion, and threw the ball back out to Miller to
end the inning.
Coach Clarke was impressed by many aspects of
play in Florida. She cited the defense, both the

infield and outfield, as strengths that were exhibited
down south. Procacci was a standout behind the
plate making several diving catches for easy outs for
the Tide.
Marone could not be denied at the plate especially in crunch time. She picked up five RBFs including the game-winner against Coe. Samantha Brody

'O5 was key to the Garnet offense by getting on base
frequently as the lead-off hitter. As a catcher
Procacci acknowledged her pitching counterparts,
Remus and Klingaman, as stand-outs.

"Both pitchers did really well-1know it was really hot and they had to pitch a total of eight games in

five days," Procacci said.
Statistically, several of the Garnet batters are off
to strong starts for this season. Four players started
Brody,
the season off with seven hits each
Procacci, Miller and Ashley Brandt 'O7. Procacci is
maintaining a .368 batting average with four RBl's,
while Brandt is hitting .389. First-year players
Brandt, Kelly Siano and Julie Monahan all had their
first collegiate hits.

After their trip the Garnet feel confident and wellprepared heading into the bulk of their season. "We
played fairly well. I think we should be proud of our
performance. I think we should walk away from the
spring trip in really good shape for conference play,"

ever remembered by the Swat boys of summer. Wearing only
shorts and a Tee-shirt, he shivers in the Pennsylvania weather
and grumbles how he wishes he were wearing a Swarthmore
baseball hooded sweatshirt. Noting how Goldstein has given such
a sweatshirt to nearly every girl at the school, Chris suggests
that, in the future, Matt should give girls a new morning-after gift
of a T-shirt, reading "I Hooked Up With Matt Goldstein and All I
Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt." A classic line indeed.

The team has three home games this week. It faces
Widener today at 4 p.m. and host a DeSales doubleheader, 1 p.m. Saturday.

said coach Clarke.

Get down to Cunningham Field on March 20 for the first home games of the
spring season for men's and women's rugby. Both teams square off against
University of Pennsylvania. The women hit the field at 11 a.m., and the Evil
Buzzards follow them at 1 p.m.
Leading the men's team are Randy Goldstein 'O5 and Jon Fombonne 'O5. Aja
Peters-Mason 'O4, Kirsten Vannice 'O4 and Emily Rhoades 'O4 head the
women's team.

crowd goes wild.
March 10,10:24 p.m.: The players eat out for a team dinner at
an all-you-can-eat ribs restaurant. The competition to see who
could eat the most ribs is intense, as the finalists are three players (Porno, Alan Walsh and Rose), one coach (Scott Kushner
and one athletic department official (Kyle Leach). Rose starts out
strong, devouring his first two racks in record time. His short
arms allow for maximum efficiency in transferring the ribs from
the plate to his extra large mouth. When asked how he feels after
two racks, Rose replies, "I'm just warming up. Two racks of ribs
equals only one velociraptor. I've got plenty left."
Unfortunately for Chris, his stomach could not handle the
massive intake of cow meat. While this means an automatic disqualification, Rose returns to the plate and eats on, completing
three and a half racks of ribs to earn him an unofficial tie with
Rib-Eating Champion Scott Kushner. Though the contestants
claim they could eat on, restaurant management boots us out.
March 12, 9:l3pm: In the baggage claim of the Philadelphia
airport, Rose has perhaps his finest moment of the trip. Already
leading the team with a .600 batting average and 1200 slugging
percentage, he is on top of the world. Feeling invincible, he aims
a joke at one Matt Goldstein 'O4. Rose cracks a line that'll be for-
