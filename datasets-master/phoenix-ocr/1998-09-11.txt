Borough police detain students on drinking charges

Alcohol problems plague
Swat campus first week
Ay Kathryn Tong

■Mews Editor
Since the beginning of the
semester, a rush of alcohol-re-

lated incidents has flooded the
:ampus. Three arrests and five
Stations were issued to Swarthmore students by the Swarthmore Police Department.
Two hospitalizations also
resulted from two other unreated alcohol-incidents.
The first arrest was a sophomore male, who wishes to remain anonymous, on the
;vening of Sept. 2, during a private party in Worth Courtyard.
Swarthmore Public Safety
•ushed to the courtyard after re-

ceiving a number of calls from
students who complained about
people throwing glass and loud
noise, said Owen Redgrave, Director of Public Safety.
The officer who made the
arrest said that he went to the
scene to assist public safety after hearing the students' phone
calls on his radio.
"Public safety officers did
not call for help from the police, we though that we could
handle the situation by ourselves," said Redgrave, "but you
can never be sure when we will
need them one day."
The student was cited for disorderly conduct and underage

drinking. According to police, he
was too intoxicated to go back on
campus so he spent the night in

the Media Police Department's
jail cell (the Swarthmore Police
Department only has a holding
cell), until the next morning.
The student does not wish
to comment on the incident at
this time.
The other two arrests were
made on sophomore males, both
of whom wish to remain anonymous, on the night of Sept. 4.
The students were walking on
Magill Walk, one of whom was
carrying an open beer can, when
a Swarthmore police officer on
bicycle patrol stopped them.
One of the students was carrying a can ofbeer and the other
student had alcohol in his
breath, according to police re-

ports. This was enough probable cause for the police officer
to ask the students to take a
breath test. The student carrying the beer had a blood-alcohol level of .05, and the other
student had a level of .06, according to police reports.
The state of Pennsylvania
has a zero-tolerance level. Had
the students been driving, they
would have been charged with
Driving Under the Influence and
had their licenses revoked, said
the police.
The student carrying the beer
said that he had a total of four
beers that night and did not consider himself to be intoxicated.
"I'm upset that I was arrested when I was drinking responsibly," he said.
Although shaken up by the

incident, he says that the does
not know whether or not he will
continue to drink in the future.
The same night of the two
arrests, a male first-year jumped
out of his second floor Wharton
West window at 12:30 a.m. According to a Resident Advisor
present at the scene, prior to his
escape, three R.A.'s were talking
to him in his hall when he decided
to "go check his messages." The
student pushed the screen out of
his window and jumped.
He was taken to Worth
Health Center then to Chester
Crozer Medical Center and was
released after a few hours, suffering no serious injury., said
Tedd Goundie, Associate Dean
of the College for Student Life.
Earlier that night he had attended the Mephistos party in

Willets, when one of the R.A.'s
asked him to leave. The student
also attended the party in
Wharton courtyard, but was not
given anything to drink.
Shortly after he was released
from the hospital, a first-year
female who was rushed to
Chester Crozer Medical Center
for acute alcohol poisoning.
Throughout the night she
had been drinking shots of hard
alcohol and beer,according to
Goundie.
The student's blood alcohol
content was .35, near the lethal
limit. Doctors pumped her
stomach, gave her a breathing
tube and administered medication intravenously. The student
stayed at the hospital for more
than 10 hours before she was
stable enough to be released.

Commencement date remains unchanged College rating drops;

students feign apathy

by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman

[Contributing Writer
Tuesday afternoon, the
Committee on Faculty Procedures decided not to change the
graduation date for the Class of
1999. Although this year's seniors will enjoy a full Senior
Week, administrators are still
deciding whether to hold future
commencements earlier than the
traditional time in late May.
Many believe that shortening or
eliminating Senior Week will
reduce the vandalism that often
precedes commencement.
For two consecutive years,
there have been incidents of vandalism during Senior Week. During the previous academic year's
Senior Week, 12 Scott Arboretum
signs were damaged at a total cost
of over $7,000, according to Tedd
Goundie, associate dean. The
Class of 1998 turned over $5OO
to the college, but Bob Gross,
Dean of the College, said the rest
ofthe damage expenses were absorbed by the budget.
During Senior Week in 1997,
windows were broken in four
buildings, three windshields were
smashed, $5,000 worth of tools
were-stolen and a small fire was
set on the Sharpies loading
dock. The Class of 1997 paid
$5OO for the damage. Now
graduating classes are required
to put down a security deposit
for use in the event of vandalism, Goundie said.
Dean Gross and President
Al Bloom said, though, that the
potential for reducing vandalism
was not the primary reason for
the proposal to change the commencement date.
"It's absolutely not in response to past incidents," said
Bloom, who said the suggestion
:ame from students and faculty,
'the two most important constituencies."

administration considered changing this summer, photo byAlexa Miller

"Students felt that having a
longer period [between exams
and graduation] diminished or
attenuated the sense of excitement or bonding that they suggested [they wanted! during Senior Week," Bloom said.
But, not all students favor an
earlier graduation date.
"I don't think that cutting Senior Week is going to stop [vandalism]," said Gerry Kaufman
'99. "I still haven't heard a compelling reason to discontinue Senior Week. By now it's a Swarthmore tradition."
Ben Fritz '99 said vandalism
was no excuse to cancel Senior
Week. "There's vandalism in
dorms," he said, "so [are they not]
going to let people in dorms anymore? It makes no sense."
Amy Markey' 99 pointed out
that seniors may not have done
all of the vandalism in past years.
Bloom
with
agreed
Markey's sentiments. "I'm not

even sure it was Swarthmore

students who did it," he remarked.
Many seniors said they look
forward to Senior Week as their
final time together as Swarthmore students.
"After orientation freshman
year that's the only time you
have with your class without a
lot of work," said Kaufman.
Gross, however, said, "The
flip side of that is there is too
much free time and too much
booze." He added that some students are eager to leave school
after classes end in the spring.
"People have summer jobs and
they have travel plans," he said.
"Some students would be happy
to leave early and reduce that
period in May."
Gross also said that one difference between Swarthmore's
schedule and that of the other
Tri-Co colleges is Swarthmore's
commencement date. Seniors at

"If you are not an honors
student then you have a very

Bloom.
"There are other issues
here, which include whether
faculty can get grades done,"
said Bloom.
Everyone in the college
community, from students to
faculty to administration, have
a vested interest in whether or
not commencement—and possibly other dates in the college
calendar —are changed.
Dean Gross summed up the
dilemma: "Any decision about

College
Swarthmore
toppled off its No. 1 spot, becoming the nation's second best
liberal arts college, according to
the latest rankings from U.S.
News &World Report.
Amherst College nosed
Swarthmore out of the No. 1 spot
it had enjoyed for the last two
years. Williams College,
Swarthmore's other rival, took
third in the nation.
In this year's rankings, the
weekly magazine gave Swarthmore high marks for faculty resources and student selectivity.
But the college's lower marks in
the categories ofreputation and
alumni giving, and the drop in
its student graduation rate, prevented it from beating out
Amherst for the top spot.
Both administrators and students showed little concern
about the drop to second place.
In fact, many students were
pleased that Swarthmore has
fallen out of the limelight.
"I'm glad," one sophomore
said. "They [the administration]
were using that rating too much
to sell the school. It's time they
cut the crap and concentrated on
better things."
All throughout academia,
the debate as to whether college
rankings are appropriate rages
on. Yet U.S. News & World
Report's college ratings continue to be an integral part of the
of the college search process for
prospective students and their
parents. Even at Swarthmore
most students admit to having
read the rankings during their
college searches. As the college
rankings issue explains "American higher education itselfregularly uses numerical rankings,

especially of potential students
So why are they so touchy
about being ranked?"
Despite this spin, many
people, including Swarthmore
Dean of Admissions, Robin
Mamlet, expressed concern that
the magazine's ratings over-simplify the factors that determine
how prospective students will fit
into a college, such as the
college's academic and social life.
The rankings may get
smaller schools into the public
eye, but their by the numbers
approach raises the ire of many
in education. U.S. News &
World Report itself, in an article
titled "Schools use rankings,
too," quotes Stanford University
president Gerhard Casper.
"Much about these rankingsparticularly their specious formulas and spurious precision-is
utterly misleading."
In fact, many professors and
students speculate that the magazine reshuffles the rankings
merely to keep consumer interest
and circulation up. To some extent, this is true. In its 1996 issue,
U.S. News & World Report
proudly stated "Every year since
the rankings began, we have refined the methodology we use in
this process."
However, aside from some
minor changes in computation,
the rankings criteria for the past
few years have remained largely
the same. This year, as was true
for the '97 and '9B rankings in
which Swarthmore placed #l,
national liberal arts schools
were rated according to seven
weighted categories.
Most students, however, do
not care about the criteria. They
are more concerned about hype
generated from the magazines
ratings.

The Phoenix: no longer
rising from the ashes
The phoenix is a rare bird fabled to live in the Arabian wilderness. According to myth, after a lifespan of 500 or 600 years, the
phoenix burns itself on a funeral pyre, rising out of the ashes to
begin a new cycle of life, refreshed and rejuvenated. The bird
was revered by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, as well as by
the Chinese, and for a time an image of this suicidal bird could
be found on the coins of the Roman Empire. After this rich beginning, the phoenix somehow found its way onto the masthead
of our student publication.
Just how the phoenix was chosen to grace the pages of our
weekly paper is somewhat ambiguous. One Swattie legend cites
the unfortunate and fiery destruction of Parrish in our not-sodistant past as inspiration for the image of conflagration. Another legend claims that the symbol was initially attached more
to the image ofrebirth than fire, as the Phoenix got its start after
an earlier publication folded. Regardless of how the name was
chosen, last semester's Phoenix staff chose to adopt as the motto
"rising from the ashes" to represent the paper.
The image of the Phoenix is certainly a noble and desirable
one, but although the motto chosen by last semester's staff is
both striking and historically accurate, the current staff feel that
it's not appropriate for our masthead. It is true that we are happy
to associate ourselves with this noble creature in many ways, but
we have no desire to perpetuate the idea that we are in a constant
state ofrecovery from some great calamity. The truth, as we have
already admitted, is that not a single member of the present Phoenix staff can even identify the calamity to which we owe our
name. Whether the name was inspired by the collapse ofits predecessor or by an honest to goodness Parrish fire, the Phoenix
has had more than enough time to pull itself together and rebuild. It seems quite obvious, in fact, that the Phoenix has long
since "risen from the ashes," and any attempt to claim otherwise
can only be viewed as an excuse for the existence of a somewhat
mediocre publication at a top notch school.
This semester's Phoenix staff has no desire to make that excuse. We have worked hard to recruit new writers and editors, a
host of vigilant copy editors and at least half a dozen new photographers. New staffmembers bring a rich combination of youth
and enthusiasm to complement the experience of some of our
more seasoned veterans. All in all, the Phoenix staff of the fall
'9B is committed to fully extracting itself from the ashes and
producing a quality paper for the Swarthmore community every
week.

Given the events of the past
weekend, which included an alcohol induced defenestration
(ooh, how I love that word), the
siphoning of a poor girl's
tummy, and a few run-ins with
the law, it seems appropriate
that my article, first published
a year ago, be reprinted for the
edification of the Class of 'O2.
Before I begin, I must say that
I never would have had the courage to write this piece had it not
been for Salmon Rushdie's successful evasion of the Mark of
Death. Still, when I contacted
Mr. Rushdie and asked him if
writing such a piece while living on a college campus was
wise, he called me a "madman"
and promptly hung up.
So I shall proceed carefully.
Beer, and other forms of alcohol, are not that bad. Just the
other night I was playing chess
against my friend Rick, who is
ofroughly equal chess-playing
ability. Rick was "totally

ripped" on his carefully crafted
vodka-and-pink lemonade
cocktails, while I had the misfortune of having my senses
dulled by a television strategically positioned across the
board from me and behind my
opponent. The inebriate
trounced me in consecutive
games. So liquor is clearly not
as bad as "Third Rock from the
Sun."
From the standpoint of the
carpet outside our hall's bathroom, however, beer is considerably worse than "Third
Rock." While "Third Rock"
has been known to cause vomiting at various times in the past
year, it has nowhere near the reverse-peristaltic potency of alcohol. I'm afraid that the male
residents of Wharton F will be
living with the unsightly stains
caused by the highly unnatural
mix of gastric juices and nylon
carpet fibers for the foreseeable
future. That stuff is supposed
to stay in your stomach, and this
is one of the reasons that beer

is bad.
Beer is also bad because beerdrinkers are loud and obnoxious,
usually after they've had a few
beers. This is of great importance to me, because I sleep in a
first-floor room with three windows. Prior to guzzling three or
four Buds, few people would
feel the need to say, "my butt is
sweaty and it itches." After a
few drinks, not only will one say
this, but one's tipsy companions
will be intensely amused and
begin emitting loud, piercing
guffaws which are not conducive to a non-inebriated person's
sleep process. Sleep is good.
Beer is bad.
I know what you're thinking:
"But beer is fun! Are you trying to tell me that fun is bad?"
Fun is good. Fun is even better when you can remember it
the next morning. Okay, not
all alcohol consumers have
prolonged blackouts. Perhaps
a couple of beers loosens you
up a little bit and lets you have
some fun that you can remem-

ber, which is the experience
of most students. It certainly,
in my experience, does not act
to expand your consciousness; the most it can claim to
do is expel your inhibitions.
I like to quote Richard
Feynman on his aversion to
drugs: "I love to think, and I
don't want to screw up the
machine." While you probably won't "screw up the machine" permanently by casual
drinking, you will screw it up
at least temporarily. Frankly,
my machine is screwy enough
that I don't need the extra help
of a special blend of barley
and hops.
To review: Gastric juices inside your stomach are good.
Gastric juices on carpet are bad.
Sleep is good. Drunken laughter that interrupts sleep is bad.
Most importantly: mind is
good, beer is bad.
If you didn't find the this article amusing, have a couple of
beers.
Read it again.

What Happened to Reality?
by Wendy Lawrence
Contributing Writer
It was around here just a second ago, I swear. Maybe under the
pile of new Lit books I bought at the bookstore in exchange for
my parents' mortgage. Maybe I threw it in the pile of recycling
next to the course catalogue (which I read cover to cover) and the
news magazine (whose cover I read). Or did I even unpack it this
year? Could I have left it in Robert's storage? Did I even have it
last year?
Reality. I'm pretty sure it's gone for good this time.
But is this really my fault? Recent conversations I have had
with Swatties have suggested otherwise. That perhaps I didn't
lose Reality. Perhaps Reality lost me. If we consider Swarthmore to be a void unbreachable by Reality, it is easy to see how
this could have happened. We entered Swarthmore from Reality,
and Reality was locked out. It couldn't find us for awhile. Perhaps we re-entered reality for a few summers, but as we spent
more and more time away from it, it became frustrated, confused,
and finally uninterested. Reality simply doesn't have a lot oftime
for a liberal arts undergrad.
I guess my concern here, and that which prompted this article,
is that Reality might be similarly uninterested in a liberal arts
graduate. What if it never comes back?
It is precisely this concern that I wish to address. I know you
have all had the Swattie social-skills-discussion at some point in
your career here. The underlying, fundamental, dichotomy-resolving, paradox-revealing discussion: does Swarthmore make one
lose touch with reality, or do out of touch people make up Swarthmore?
Usually, the discussion takes place in the form of a general agreement: most Swatties have no social skills whatsoever. Dave
Mimno, a Swarthmore Senior Latin major (and socially inept person), noted that while Swatties may start college with limited social skills, the Swarthmore experience finally removes any residual
skills. Julie Schwendiman, a Physics major with a limited and
dwindling grasp on reality, agreed with Mimno and expressed
concern that she might not have the social skills of someone who,
say, was given the occasional opportunity to exhibit them.
It's fair to say there's some sort of positive feedback loop going
on here. Students who are out of touch with reality create a place
which shuns reality. This takes those same students even further
down the road marked "This is the road that goes away from Reality."
I mean, it's annoying being socially inept, living one's life completely detached from reality. Don't you think so? Well, I do too.
Which is why I wanted to use this article to say that it's not my
fault. That Swarthmore has made us this way, and that we are all
like this. So I offer some proof of this, looking at various standardized reality indexes in order to determine the level of reality
here at Swat.
I will examine the baseball index, the social life index, and the
index of The Graduate.
A quick poll should satisfy the baseball index. Are you guys on
the side of Sammy Sosa or Mark McGuire? I bet a lot of you
don't know about Mark McGuire's 62nd home run. In fact, you
might not even realize the significance of 62. Does the name
Roger Maris ring a bell? Do you know what baseball is?
There are other signs of the giant fault line between Swarthmore and social reality. What about the poster in my hall bathroom that asks you if you have "hooked up"? The poster gives
points for physical activities, with a minimum required to achieve
hooked up status. Of course, that minimum was lowered in the
event the test taker is a Swattie.

I mean, why don't we just admit it without all the hoopla of
points? In the real world, you've had a hook up if you've had
sex. At Swarthmore, you're there if your Microeconomics study
group is co-ed.
Perhaps the best, most scientific measure of one's touch with
reality, however, can be based upon one's level of understanding
ofThe Graduate. The more one understands that movie, the further one has come from the Real World, Real People, and Reality
in general. This should be a fairly easy tenet to understand. The
proof is left to the reader.
I'm not embarrassed to say it: I understand the movie. In fact,
I'd even go further. I am the movie. I am The Graduate. Except
it's worse than that—l haven't even graduated. He's one up on
me.

I mean, I honestly wouldn't be at all surprised if any one of
these days I was thrust into a SCUBA outfit by Larry Westphal,
who pushed my head under the surface of Ware Pool while the
Bio and Econ department faculty members applauded and the
entire freshman class cheered.
Is that an odd thing to say? It doesn't seem odd to me, but I'm
pretty sure it is. If you don't find it odd, you are most likely
living in the same sick world as me.
The interesting thing about using The Graduate as a measure of
our collective grasp on reality is that it definitely insinuates that
Swarthmore took reality away from us, that we didn't take it away
from Swarthmore. It's not our fault! Because our understanding
of The Graduate tends to increase directly with our increased time
spent at Swarthmore, we can deduce that our understanding of
Reality decreases during that time.
So how exactly do we solve this problem? I guess we don't.
You can't exactly just start yelling "Reality" as if it were a puppy
dog that will come bounding back. But a few tips in case it is
possible to re-enter Reality:
Don't confuse Honors exams with the End of the World.
Pick up a newspaper at least once a month to assure yourself that
the rest of the world does exist. Practice saying things like "nice
legs." Contrary to popular belief, "interesting paradox" is NOT a
pickup line outside of this campus. Do not visit this campus after
you graduate. Try introducing yourself as a person, not as a major of some department. Never drive one of your parents' friends
home after a party.

Twenty first-years are playing for Swarthmore football this
season. The coaching staff
hopes the freshmen players will

season.
"This year, the freshmen
will have a significant role with

Swarthmore's Head Coach.
Alvanos credits the large
number of freshmen to more aggressive recruiting by his coaching staff. Twenty-five first-years
joined the team before the season started, but several of them
dropped out. Alvanos hopes 18
to 25 freshmen will join his future teams and give him a yearly
total of 60 to 65 players.

is a popular stop for American tourists, photo by Amy Markey
.
In my last days of bittersweet freedom before school started
this year, I took a week-long trip to Paris with my family. As a
first-time visitor to France's landmark city, I found the experience
exciting and culturally stimulating, with the vast array of museums, restaurants, and historical landmarks enriching me with each
passing day.
Yeah, right.
If there's one thing I learned first-hand during my excursion
to Food—l mean France —it's that American and European cultures are vastly different. If you're not the adventurous type who's
willing to sacrifice a little embarrassment for the sake of acclimating yourself to a new environment, you won't last a second.
With that in mind, I've decided to share some of the highlights and pitfalls of my trip, geared specifically toward the
Francophone novice. I hope if you venture off to Paris any time
soon, you can learn from my experience and lessen the blow of
making the inevitable fool of yourself.
Rumor: a lot of people in Paris speak English, so if you can't
speak French, that's okay. Reality: If you can't rattle off rapid-fire
French in an authentic accent, you'll invoke the disdain of the
native Parisian you're so desperately trying to communicate with.
While the concierge at our hotel was nice enough not to snicker at
my feeble attempt to speak French (he was from England), most
people in the real world of Paris were not so forgiving.
Still, if you at least make a concerted effort to use your high
school French with a semi-believabler accent, you'll be okay. If,
however, you have the mentality of some of the clueless tourists I
ran into (and my mom), and don't even bother to put on an accent,
you're doomed. "Bone joor, parlay-voo anglaze?" sounds even
more grating to French ears, I'm sure.
Unlike in New York, crossing against the light or in the middle
of the block in Paris is generally not acceptable behavior. However, driving 80 miles per hour down a narrow, one-lane street is.
So, when you walk down the five-inch thick sidewalk of one of
those quaint little roads, beware of blind corners.
Also, since the vast majority of the vehicles in Paris, including the public buses, have manual transmissions, you might want
to pack some Dramamine before riding anywhere.
It's been said that the French are rude by nature. I initially
thought this was an ugly generalization, but I came to realize it's
an accurate one.
Looking back on my trip, I don't know why French teachers
here bother teaching their students de rien (you're welcome), because no one in Paris says it. Honestly. One woman managed a Je
vous en prie (don't mention it), but she was tending the cash register in a Jewish deli, so it was kind of different.

fool
of myself

An electronic French-English dictionary is an absolute necessity when wandering aimlessly about the city. It's almost a requirement for interpreting menus, and what's more, it helps to be able to
formulate on the fly such basic phrases as Oui, Monsieur, Merci,
Madame; and Excusez-moi, je suis seulement stupide americain.
Tuning through the FM dial in Paris certainly highlights the
cultural divide between France and the U.S. Using my Walkman,
I managed to find five or so stations that came in clearly, only two
of which played music exclusively. Those two, "Cherie FM" and
"Energy" (no, I'm not joking), played a mix of French and English songs that was nothing if not diverse. Think: Romantic-sounding French music, followed by Will Smith.
French television also clearly illustrated the influence of
American culture over there. Watching dubbed versions of "Les
Simpson" and "Picket Fences" (renamed a completely unrelated

later on.
Second, if you do decide to use the magical phrase d'eau du
robinet (tap water) and I suggest you do, because bottled water
is very expensive—be tactful about it. On one occasion, the woman
taking my order expected me to order something to drink in addition to the water. When I declined, she seemed disappointed, and
not the least bit offended.
Lastly, while it's good language practice to look at the strictlyFrench menu (and sometimes, that's all there is), take caution when
you order. Nothing brings down a nice lunch on the ChampsElysees like ordering what you think will be some sort of salad,
and receiving sliced ham with olives. Or choosing your entree at
the last minute under the glaring eyes of an impatient waiter, and
winding up with liver, when you thought that word meant veal.
These minor points notwithstanding, I wholeheartedly rec—

another artistic eye-opener. Wedged
somewhere between a large array of
French rap albums and displays of
"deux-titres" (singles) sat what was
undoubtedly the world's biggest collection of Celine Dion CD's. From
what I gathered, ifyou're French, and
not into either rap or Celine, you're
a social outcast.
No discussion of Paris would be

of its food. It is, I have to admit, everything it's made out to be. The

Summer movie extravaganza found less than intellectually stimulating
Ben Fritz
The Other

Unreal
World
This is the year I come
clean. In print. This is the year
I stand proud and share my love
ofshow business with the world.
That's right, show business.
I may go to the most intellectual college in the nation; I may
discuss Thomas Hobbes and
Kenneth Arrow and Sergei
Eisenstein in class and write
papers with phrases like "I
would argue" or "a survey of the
literature indicates;" but I also
love to read Variety and Entertainment Weekly and have dis-

cussions that start off with "Can
you believe Jack won over Peter Fonda for best actor?"
So that's what this column
is all about. My goal is to bring
the world of show business into
the hands of pop-culture-starved
Swatties each week.
I'm sure some of you would
rather spend four years in ML
basement than hear about the
new Fall TV season or the Oscar race, but I'm also confident
there are at least a few out there
who miss having the time to
thoroughly read their Entertainment Weeklys.
So, what better way to start
off a showbiz column than with
the perennial favorite, the summer movie season in review,
where we ask what worked,

what didn't, why, and what
drugs were the American public on that they made Armageddon the biggest hit of the summer?
When it comes to what
worked, there's actually reason
to take heart. This summer
proved that good word of mouth
does much more than huge marketing muscle of the type that
created such ridiculous expectation for Godzilla that every
American citizen would have to
see the film 5 times to make it a
"hit" in Hollywood's eyes.
My favorite example is, of
course, the $26 million There's
Something About Mary, which
came from a studio, Fox, that
admitted it was very frightened
the film was so over the line that

it would not only bomb, but it
would be perceived as having so
degraded the medium of film
they would become the Bill
Clintons of the entertainment
industry.
But thanks to strong word
of mouth that got everyone talking about how Mary was the
most laugh-out-loud hilarious
movie in years, the Farrelly
brothers' slapstick, grotesque
comedy has already grossed
$ll6 million and is on track to
become the third biggest hit of
the summer (and in terms of cost
vs. gross, probably the best nonindie performer of the year).
The other reason to be glad
this summer was Richard Rodat
and Steven Spielberg's Saving
Private Ryan (Mr. Rodat is the

writer and, contrary to most
people's opinion, deserves just
as much credit as Spielberg for
the finished product), which
showed both that a powerful
film doesn't need powerhouse
marketing and that just because
it's summer doesn't mean only
films with more explosions than
coherent lines of dialogue can
be released.
Ryan was truly an extraordinary film, one of the best of
the '9os (second this year only
to the obscure Irish film The
Butcher Boy, which I am one of
about 10 people in America to
have seen), and made me very
happy not only that it was made,
but that the American people did
right and made it the summer's
second-highest grosser (of

course I'd be even more happy
if they had done it without the
names Spielberg, Hanks, and

Damon attached, but I'll take
what I can get).
Of course, it was the summer and this is America, which
means no one should get too
excited about the success of a
few good films, because a number of mediocre to crappy films
did gross well over $lOO million, sending Hollywood the
message we can't wait for more
of the same shit. I save a special spot in my rectum for Armageddon, so I'll get to that
later, but the list also includes
Deep Impact, which was basically a TV movie-of-the-week

Gomez's debut strong

but disappointing effort
by Patrick Boe
Contributing Writer

I seem to be reviewing a lot of mongrel albums lately. It's
been a long line of music that features anywhere from two to ten
different styles fused together, with more success in some cases
than others.
Bring It On, the debut release from a British band called
Gomez, is its attempt at this all-too-common brand of
alternativization. They've made a really good rock album recalling late sixties, Eagles-type guitar-heavy bands, but they seem to
think the sound needs updating
so they've spiced it up with a lo
of surplus electronic noise.
Sometimes it works. On the
first track, a grinding, scraping
computer vehicle adds some
good mass to the primitive
drums, the sloping, lingerin
guitar that the "best of the six
ties, seventies, and today" sta

the TomWaitsy blues vocals.
Bring It On
In a lot of the other work, it
Virgin Records
fails. "Tijuana Lady" is an unquestionably epic song about a lady the singer remembers from
Tijuana, for whom he's been searching throughout Mexico.
It has a good road feel to it, evoking the open air, dust, and old
machinery. However, the sound is really wide and echo-heavy,
sounding a little over-produced at times.
This wouldn't be a big problem, except that Gomez tries to
cover it up by trivializing the song at the end with some artificial
electric fuzz and some insipid MIDI noise scales. It's such a common trick for a band to play; it's as if Gomez thinks that adding a
little token distortion to an otherwise-extravagant song will make
the whole thing into a clever jibe, relieving it from any stigma of
pretension.
In this case, as in most, it doesn't work. It just wounds what
would otherwise be a fine piece of music.
There are a few pop songs on this album that work pretty well.
"Whippin' Piccadilly," about a wild jaunt around Manchester, is a
fun time.
The band's real ability lies in bluesy rock. When they stick to
it, they can lay a fine groove, and the singing talent really shines.
There's a growly voice and a smooth voice in the band. I don't
know which is which, but together they can take care of all the
vocal tasks pretty handily.
On their next album, I would like to see them confident enough
in their abilities that they don't need to mask them.

like my bedroom closet or under my bed. He seems eager to en

However, it seems really inappropriate to imagine him play

are no gloomy songs on this album, and the cheerfulness and op

The guitar work here is very simple, but his warm strum and
his perfect counterpoint are irresistable. I mentioned before tha
the lyrics are easy and repetitive, but I think it's a testament to
Fox's formidable songwriting talent that I could imagine almost
any one of these songs becoming a YMCA camp favorite.
The repetition and simplicity, rather than just making the songs
seem juvenile, make them resonate. It probably helps that Fox also
has a great voice for folk. It's like he's always straining to sing a
higher note, and as if to do so, he needs to look at the sky.
Every time I listen to this record, I get happier that I have it.

Kid Rock flops despite promise
by George Macros
Contributing Writer
What does one think when
one sees a combination of Boy
George and Vanilla Ice extending his middle finger while holding a cigar in his ring-adorned
other hand? Kid Rock comes to
mind . . right?
The most mainstream production to date from this enigmatic artist, "Devil Without a
Cause" can only be described as
an eclectic smattering of every
possible musical taste that
would appeal to the average
teenager, combining the main
ingredients, heavy metal and
rap, in simple terms.
Kid's rap varies from pld
school beats to west coast
gangsta rap, while the heavy
metal styles he uses range from
Metallica to Alice in Chains.
Backed up by a talented southern rock/heavy metal band
called Twisted Brown Trucker,
Kid Rock masterfully fuses
these two divisions of popular
music.
On most tracks, the hip hop
beat dominates the beginning,
melds with the heavy metal in
the middle and converts to a predominantly heavy metal song by
the end of the song. In addition,
every track includes hints of
other musical genres, from the
mouth harp to gospel soul.
The main question that persists in the listener's mind is
whether his music is a tasteful
blend of many legendary and individual ingredients, or a wild
rampage concocted merely to
celebrate his musical versatility.
Regardless of the conclusion, the listener must first bypass his crass and frequently
obscene vocals which in my
view serve only as shock value.
Ultimately, such barrages of
sophomoric profanities jeopardize the wide musical spectrum
.

Kid Rock brings together gangster rap and heavy metal in a fusion that could only appeal
to the typical American adolescent, photo courtesy of Atlantic Records
for which he strives.
The multiple styles on this
CD represent the varied musical and cultural backgrounds of
Michigan-born Kid Rock. He
unites a lyrical hybrid of "innercity ghetto" and "white trash"
lingo with a dislike of police
authority, something universal
to virtually all American adolescents. These underlying qualities of his music are found
within a brief summary of the
first three tracks.
Kid Rock grew up alternating between the turntables, the
guitar and the vocal microphone, and his knowledge and
experience provide a solid basis for the album.
However, I find it quite pretentious that Kid Rock begins
his album with Sugar Hill
Gang's "Rapper's Delight," a
revolutionary old school track,
considered by many to be one
of the first popular rap songs, as
if his music represents some

"second coming" of the allmighty musical catalyst.
The next track begins with
an utterly hilarious choking
voice repetitiously chanting
"cowboy," the title of the song.
Here Twisted Brown Trucker
momentarily showcases their
smooth transitional abilities,
changing from heavy metal to
deep southern blues with a harmonica, banjo, and the whole
jar of peanut butter.
The third track grabs the
listener out of sheer surprise
with Twisted Brown Trucker's
funky guitar picking and a PFunk bass line with soul vocals
paying homage to the "honkey"
on the title track. The solid, consistent talent of the band
emerges once again as the song
changes to metal without jarring the flow of the music.
To erase any artistic merit
that had materialized at the beginning of the third song, Kid
Rock introduces a child rapper

named Joe C. This child's big

Continued from page 5
with some expensive effects at
the end, the rehash of a rehash
called Lethal Weapon 4, and The
Mask ofZorro, whose exciting
action scenes couldn't nearly
make up for its inane plot and
cardboard characters.
The Truman Show was a
very good movie that did quite
well, but in a way you have to
chalk that up to media hype as
critics and reporters lost their
heads, hailing what is in actuality a decent movie based on
a great but unoriginal idea, as
the most significant film ofthe
'9os~until, of course, a month
later when Saving Private
Ryan appeared and everyone
forgot Truman even existed
and had had major Oscar predictions.
The real disallowment for
hype, however, of course has to
go to Godzilla, which made well
over $lOO million domestic but
didn't come close to recouping
it ridiculous cost and didn'teven
reach the ballpark of the prediction everyone at Sony
(Godzilla's distributor) was
making (one wonders what a
Freudian might make of their
poor performance after boasting
to the world that indeed "size
does matter").

I don't want to be accused
of being all about commercialism, however, so I won't end this
without naming a few favorites
from the summer, both of which
did so-so at the box office. Most
notable to me is Bulworth, Warren Beatty's (and if a nonWoody Allen movie ever belonged to one man, this is it)
slightly awkward and patronizing, but also brave, brilliant, hilarious and scathing political
satire.
Just the fact that a political
movie came out that rests on
more than a simple idea (e.g.
Wag the Dog) and actually has
something worthwhile to say
(unlike Primary Colors) is reason for celebration in my book,
but Bulworth did that and more,
stating what everyone knows but
few people say and doing it in a
way that, like all good satires,
values entertainment over edification.
The Negotiator is also noteworthy in its status as the only
quality action movie of the summer (following, albeit far behind, Face/Off which was in a
similar position last year) and
also for its mainstream introduction of director F. Gary Gray,
who, if The Negotiator is any
indication, has a great future
ahead of him as a crafter of nu-

anced, well-paced films, both
dramatic and action. (Indie fans
please note I'm only writing
about studio pics here; I'm well
aware there were some great
small movies this summer, most
especially David Mamet's The
Spanish Prisoner.)
I can't think of a better
segue into what I promised to
be my last topic, Armageddon,
than nuanced and well-paced
direction, two of the many
qualities director Michael Bay
displayed a mind-reeling lack
of.
Now, I am of course as
much a member of the MTV
generation as all of you and
am used to the quick cuts and
attention span compressing,
but Bay seems to forget that
just because you're cutting
quickly is not an excuse to ignore coherent story telling,
because many scenes in Armageddon are cut so randomly
that it's difficult to even tell
what the hell is going on.
It's almost a surreal experience, like if James Joyce made
a movie, justlacking in any and
all qualities one might associate
with someone actually trying to
make an alternative statement.
The movie reeked of consumerconscious construction, with

What got to me most of all
about Armageddon, however,
was its lack ofexcitement. I just
don't understand what got
people pumped up about this
movie. I mean, the villain was
a rock! Who gets worked up
about a rock? Without a worthy adversary, where's the conflict? The only conflict I experienced while watching Armageddon was trying to control my
gag reflex when Ben Affleck
started playing with animal
crackers on Liv Tyler's stomach.
Why do I have this bad feeling
that 15 year-old boys across the
country, anxious to score for the
first time, bought animal crackers en masse this summer? j
Of course, Armageddon
was the biggest grossing film of

Field hockey
scores back-to-

Cross country
boasts great
season start

back shutouts
by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor
Field hockey continued their winning ways with a pair of shutout victories this week to open their 1998 season. The team, which shared the Centennial Conference Championship last
year with Washington and Gettysburg
and won the ECAC title, rocketed past
Widener and Elizabethtown, by scores
of 2-0 and 4-0.
The Garnet wasted no time and had
posted a goal less than a minute into
their match against Widener's Pioneers. Sweeper Jennifer Hagan '99
converted a penalty corner from
Kristen English 'Ol and Lurah Hess
'99. With nine minutes remaining in
the half, Hagan again found the back
ofthe cage off a corner to put Swarthmore firmly in control. The Garnet
outshot Widener 11-0. Coach Karen
Borbee, in her third year at the helm
of the team, and her players agreed
upon the value of scoring off such opportunities. Hess said, "I see that as
an early strength that will hopefully
carry throughout the season."
In the match against Elizabethtown,
Captain Holly Baker '99 picked up 2
goals and an assist, while Hess also
scored twice. Donna Griffin '99
notched an assist in the outing. Jane
Kendall 'OO, who led the conference
in goalkeeping last year, had to turn
away just one shot from the Blue Jays,
while the Garnet barraged the opposing keeper with 17 tries.
First-team All Centennial Baker and
Second-team All Centennial Hess will
likely provide much of Swarthmore's
offense this year. The two combined
for a total of 36 goals and 18 assists,
finishing second and third in the conference, respectively. The top spot had
been occupied by Danielle Duffy '9B,
the conference's three-time Player of
the Year, who holds the conference
records for career goals, assists, and
points in both centennial action (30,40,
100) and overall games (68, 78, 214).
"Danielle Duffy has been tough to replace because she was not only a big
scorer, but also was responsible for the
majority of our transition for the past
four years. Now that she's gone, we
have to learn how to play a much more
team-oriented transition game," said
Borbee. "Advancing the ball from
midfield to the scoring circle is one of
our main focuses in practice," commented English.
Hess described a new 1-3 offensive
attack that the team has been working
on in practice and tested in the Widener game. "The thought was that the
three midfielders and forwards would
work the ball through to a cherrypicker for a break away or deflection
into goal. While our transition game
worked well with this technique, we
did not score using this offense so there
will probably be some more adjustments," she said.
The Garnet's defense was affected by
the graduation of First-team All Centennial Michelle Walsh '9B. "Michelle
was key at center-back. She created a
physical presence in the center of the
field that was difficult for the opposition to get around," said Hess. However, Hess is quick to add that the defense remains a tough one, anchored
by goalie Kendall and Second-team All
Centennial Hagan.
Six freshmen show much promise
and will likely raise the team's already
high level of play. The new faces on
the squad are right wing Kim Cariello,
forward Alison Gaffney, midfielder
Amy Dißenedetto, and defenders
Katie Tarr, Carly Hammond, and
Christine Crumley. "The freshman had
a great preseason. They seem to be fitting into our team and our system very
smoothly," said Borbee.
The Garnet host Western Maryland

Football aims for wins with
new coach, new attitude
by Uche Eneanya
Contributing Writer

A review of the last few years of
Swarthmore football is grim: tales of
winless seasons, lopsided defeats, and
frustrated players abound. Taking all
this into account, the outlook for the
1998 season might not have reason to
be all that optimistic, with many freshmen joining the team and a new coach
taking the helm. An upbeat attitude by
the coaching staff though has inspired
players and spectators alike to believe
that football's woes will remain in the
past.

As the team took the field in their first
game against Division I Navy's junior
varsity team, many would have written off the squad as the automatic underdog, outmatched by bigger, stronger, faster players. Last season's 38-0
flogging at Navy's hands did not help
to quell these fears. However, the Tide
matched Navy step for step at the beginning. The players refused to repeat
last year's troubled starts and fought
courageously.
Down 14-0 at halftime, the Tide regrouped and only allowed Navy 8
points in the second half. Eventually,
the athleticism of the Navy players did
best Swat, with the final score a disappointing but much-improved 22-7.
Two controversial calls during the
game, which resulted in two scores for
Navy's squad, could have made the
game even closer. According to speedy
wide receiver Kelley Hauser 'OO, "It
was the first time in three years that I
felt we had a chance to win the game...
Our defense played great."
With this positive performance in
tow, the current squad left a skeptical
audience with a good feeling about the
upcoming season. Improvements upon
last season's blow-outs can only be
termed remarkable. The offense and
defense are vastly improved, strength-

last Saturday at the Ursinis College Invitational. The race, which was more
of a warmup than anything else, was
very much a preview of what a superb
season this team could have. The men's

Jeuland 'Ol had a time of 16:03, Marc
Nierman 'Ol finished with a time of

Men's soccer suffers trio of
early season losses, one win
by Amber Adamson

Contributing Writer

Like most Swat teams, men's soccer has
been practicing since before the start of
classes. The team's first win of the season
came against Alvernia (2-0) last Saturday.
photo by Kristen Panfilio

The Swarthmore men's soccer team came to
campus early, as most fall sports teams do, to practice under the gaze of coach Peter Dice and the
sweltering Swarthmore sun. The goal from the
start: to develop into a competitive team. And
that is exactly what the players are doing.
To open its season the team traveled to Holy
Family on Sept. 2, but perhaps because of fatigue
from grueling twice-a-day practices, Swat returned home with a "Big L" (7-2).
"My first college game was, well, an experience I won't soon forget," said goalkeeper Andrew Kramer 'O2. "We didn't come out ready to
play against Holy Family, and it showed...l think
that a loss like that is the fault of the whole team
we weren't mentally ready."
The self-doubt disappeared in the first game of
the annual Swat Kick Classic when Swat shut out
Alvernia with a 2-0 win on Saturday Sept. 5. "We
were like black panthers at midnight, sleek and
—

confident," said Matt Kaelin 'O2. On Sunday and
Wednesday, however, the team lost to Delaware
Valley and Wesley with scores of 3-0 and 4-0 respectively. Despite these early setbacks, Tirian
Mink '9B, one of three captains (also Mike Schall
'99 and Austin Harris '99), feels optimistic about
this season.
With a new coach who is knowledgeable and energetic, experienced upperclassmen, and new
blood from the freshman class, the team hopes to
beat its record from last year. "Every individual
on the team is putting out a tremendous amount
of effort every day in practice and on the game
field," Mink said. "We have a lot of work to do,
and I'm confident things will start coming together
as the season progresses. Unfortunately, we are
our own worst enemy, but at least this is something we can improve on."
Hopefully men's soccer can redeem itself when
the team travels to Haverford for yet another tournament. Games are Saturday at 3:30 against St.
Mary's and Sunday at 3:30 against Goucher.
