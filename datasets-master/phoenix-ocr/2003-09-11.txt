College eliminates
PDC requirements
New writing courses, first-year
seminar program mark changes
to core curriculum distributions
BY RYAN CROKEN
rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

This semester marks the beginning of the end for PDCs, as a gradual overhaul of the college's curricular program is implemented.
The revisions, which will be phased in over the next three to four
years, include the elimination of the primary distribution course designation, the implementation of a writing (W) course designation, a
laboratory requirement and a voluntary first-year seminar program
for all incoming students.
The changes will not affect the class of 2004, but the class of 2005's
six-PDC credit requirement will need to be fulfilled in only two divisions rather than three. For the class of 2006, the PDC requirement will
be reduced to five credits in two divisions, and the class of 2007 will
have a four PDC or W credit requirement in two divisions.
Beginning with the class of 2008, students will be required to complete three W credits in two divisions and one laboratory credit. The
college also hopes to provide every student with the opportunity to take
at least one first-year seminar.
Provost Connie Hungerford emphatically noted that the changes do
not affect the general distribution requirements, including the demand

Westphal said.

Willets was isolated as somewhat of a problematic dorm last

"It's an exciting re-invigoration of the curriculum," Hungerford
said, "but it's building on what we've been doing rather than constituting a really dramatic change."
The new program will be implemented gradually with the understanding that current students have planned their curricular paths
based on the standards of the old requirements.
Additionally, the phase-in period will give the departments time to
design and staff the new courses. For students and faculty, a gradual
transition should be a smoother one, history professor Tim Burke said.
Burke is a member of the Council on Educational Policy.

"It's an exciting re-invigoration of the
curriculum, but it's building on what we've

"You have to phase in new requirements in stages, unless you're
prepared to create enormous disruptions and anxieties," Burke said,
"which is really only justified when there's some kind of huge crisis
afflicting curriculum."

The inconveniences of the old system are not generally viewed as a
huge crisis, but PDCs have fallen under increasing criticism in recent
years. The PDC requirements were instituted by the CEP in 1985 with
the manifold purposes of presenting students with a small, discussion-

oriented, writing-intensive class that was to introduce the methodology of the particular discipline. But after reviewing the program by
means of faculty discussion and student focus groups, the CEP concluded that these conditions were not being effectively met,
Hungerford said.
The CEP investigation discovered that the 25-student enrollment
cap was often ignored, creating crowded classrooms and inhibiting discussion, Burke said. Additionally, many PDC courses were found to be
no more writing-intensive than any other classes.
"We [the CEP] assumed that all of this had happened for good reason," Burke said, "and that the designation of PDC had outlived its usefulness."
Many students found the PDC designations to be somewhat arbitrary, and the PDC requirements to be either pointless or inconvenient.
"I honestly didn't see much of a difference between my PDC courses and any other class I was taking," Ben Perkins 'O6 said.
Registrar Martin Warner said the new requirements were drafted
with the intent of providing a less complicated, constraining structure

Recording industry ups the
ante on file sharing suits
BY GARTH

SHELDON-COULSON

gsheldol@swarthmore.edu
The recording industry on Monday filed a
barrage of 261 lawsuits against people who
share music over the Internet, with thousands
more expected to follow and Swarthmore students are not immune.
In the past two weeks alone, Information
Technology Services Director Judy Downing
has received three e-mails from recording
industry representatives threatening legal
action unless students take down shared music

files. More than 40 students were singled out for
these electronic rebukes, and they have "been
very responsive" to the warnings, Downing
said.
"But I got concerned," she said, "when I saw
the large amount of subpoenas filed recently."
She added that she was "even more concerned" by the fact that some students share
many more than 1,000 files over the Internet,
putting themselves precariously above the
threshold used by recording industry to decide
whether to file charges.
So far, ITS has not been subpoenaed to provide the names of anyone sharing music from
the Swarthmore network.
"We protect the identity of the student.
There's never been a name exchange at this

said.
However, she made clear that Swarthmore
cannot guarantee privacy. If Swarthmore were
served a subpoena, she said, it would be forced
to identify an offender and then could protect
itself, but not the student, from liability using

point," Downing

the 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright Act. The
act limits the liability of Internet service
providers and educational institutions.
Dorm technicians and ITS workers, knowing the risks involved in sharing copyrighted
material, used computer orientation workshops
for first-years to give new students advice about
file sharing.
"We mentioned that ITS doesn't want you to
share, but if you share on the local network, ITS
doesn't mind that much," said Kenneth Patton

'O6, a dorm technician who participated in the
computer orientations.
But to some first-years, the message came
across slightly differently.
"It was more geared toward the college
telling us how not to get suits filed against us

than that we just shouldn't share music," said
Alex Pshenichkin 'O7.
ITS Networking Manager Mark Dumic said
he was "a little dismayed that the dorm techs
said it's OK to violate copyright as long as it's
not too much." Tips like these were only "dorm
techs' interpretation" of the situation, Downing
added. "We wouldn't want to do anything that
encourages a student to violate copyright."
Intra-Swarthmore file sharing is, in fact,

"safer" than Internet file sharing, said Adam
Preset, ITS Unix Systems Administrator. Many
students share files using the file-sharing capa-

bilities built into the Windows and Macintosh

operating systems. Preset pointed out, though,
that even brief or infrequent use of KaZaA or

similar programs can be risky, because it allows
one's music files to be catalogued on one of the
many "supernodes" on the network. These

supernodes can then relay incriminating information to the rest of the Internet.
In the wake of the recent lawsuits, ITS staff
has been drafting the text of a mailing to be
sent to students and their parents. The mailing
will address "the question of what Swat would
do if we were served a subpoena to identify the
name of the person sharing music with IP
address 'X,'
said Downing. She said that the
text would be finalized next week.
Among the 261 people sued by the recording
industry was a Yale professor, a 71-year-old man
whose grandson was responsible for the
infringement and an unemployed New York
woman who did not know she was breaking the
law, according to the Associated Press.
Recording industry spokespeople have said
that they are currently pursuing only those people who share large amounts of music. Students
at Princeton, Michigan Technical University
and Rensselaer Polytechnic University have
already been sued.

ITS upgrades public Macs
BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

This summer, Information Technology Services implemented a longplanned upgrade of all public iMacs from Mac OS Version 9 to OS X, the
newest version of the Apple operating system.
By implementing this upgrade, Swarthmore has updated its Apple computer base to current standards and has facilitated higher security and ease
of use for all users of the public iMacs, according to ITS Manager Doug
Willen.

Willen said that thanks to the software licenses that Swarthmore holds
with its contracted software companies, the cost of upgrades was marginal.
Swarthmore was able to avoid large costs in the new upgrade since
Swarthmore's software licenses have provisions that allow Swarthmore to

Students sued over music files
U-WIRE
U. Pennsylvania
The Recording Industry Association of
America has filed lawsuits against more
than 250 individuals who have allegedly
been illegally sharing and distributing
music online, the group announced on
Monday.
The litigation is the first wave in what
may amount to thousands of lawsuits
against major offenders, according to a
statement released by the RIAA. Users
who will be considered for prosecution
are, in general, those who have been distributing, on average, 1,000 files of copy-

righted material.
This wave of lawsuits follows suits filed
by the RIAA last spring against four college
students
Princeton University student
Daniel Peng, Michigan Technological
University student Joseph Nievelt and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students
Aaron Sherman and Jesse Jordan.
The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported that all four students settled
their lawsuits on May 1
At that time, each student agreed to
pay damages ranging from $12,000 to

$17,500 and to stop sharing music files
over the internet.
In response to the RIAA's actions, colleges and universities are taking a number of approaches to stop file-sharing.
While some have implemented plans to
educate incoming students about copyright violations as part of orientation prosuch as Pennsylvania
grams, others
State University
have taken more direct
approaches such paying the recording
industry to subsidize file-sharing.
Despite the RIAA's strong stance on
punishing offenders, the association has
said that it will grant "amnesty" to peer-topeer users who identify themselves and
promise to stop illegally sharing music on
the Internet, as well as delete any music
files from their computers that were down-

loaded illegally.
"We want to send a strong message
that the illegal distribution of copyrighted
works has consequences, but if individuals are willing to step forward on their
own, we want to go the extra step and
extend them this option," wrote Mitch
Bainwol, RIAA Chairman and CEO.

upgrade its software for free whenever the software company releases a new

version of the software.
Despite the difficulty involved with manually upgrading every single public computer, the upgrade will now facilitate future upgrades. This process
will be facilitated thanks to new software in Mac OS X that allows Willen to
upgrade everything on the hard drive of every public Macintosh on the net-

work.
In addition to allowing more management control, ITS is in the process of
ensuring that students' files saved on the local folders will be completely
erased when users log off of their accounts on public computers, ensuring

student privacy.
"Student privacy has always been one of our main concerns," Willen said.
He expects that this feature will be implemented by Friday.
In addition, the new Mac OS will improve on Apple's already proven security. According to Willen, Macintoshes are much less vulnerable to all of the
viruses that have been plaguing the campus network and the Internet.

Slow login, a common complain of public users, is not entirely the fault of
the new operating system, Willen said. System load, viruses, and new computers all play a part in this problem.
Furthermore, once the bugs of Mac OSX, the source of recent complaints,
are fixed, the system will be much more stable than the old Mac operating
system. This stability is due to the new core of the Macintosh operating system based off of Unix.
Willen said that the upgrade will allow all users to have improved security,
faster response, more up-to-date software, and a state-of-the-art public computer system.
Willen said that his major goal is to create "tools effective for people to get

the work done."

Activities fair hinders recruitment
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

This year's student activities fair was
pushed back to the second week of the
semester this year, giving students more
time to organize but putting pressure on
certain groups.
The fair, traditionally held during orientation and organized by the committee
in charge of that week, is now under the
direction of Coordinator of Student
Activities Jenny Yim, who scheduled the
event for the later date to "give the student
organizations time to meet, get organized.
Not everyone is back on campus that
Sunday before classes start," she said.
The a cappella group Grapevine felt the
pressure of the postponed activities fair
because it often tours over fall break.
Despite efforts to recruit first-years early
and hold auditions the first week of school,
Grapevine suffered from low turnout due
to the timing of the fair, president Jenny
Blumberg 'O4 said.
"Last year, we had 25 people audition,"
she said. "This year, we had 10."

Blumberg added that a number of first-

to Swarthmore's "breadth
and depth" curricular mentality, while highlighting
the importance of expository writing and the seminar
and laboratory experience.
He is optimistic that students will not have to veer

from their academic program to take classes that

"For many students it
will be automatic," Warner
said, "They will want to
take this variety of courses
anyway."
With the 25-student cap

lifted from PDC courses
and

the

12-student

cap

placed on the new First
Year Seminars, the college

may witness a size increase
for introductory courses.
This is one of the issues
that everyone is keeping an
eye on as the curriculum

noted Burke.
But for right now, he
added, "it's hard to predict
with any certainty what

will happen in the next
three to four years as we
adjust."

years approached the Grapevine table at
the activities only to learn that auditions
were over. "I feel really bad that those people were excluded," she said.
Yim said that the a cappella groups had
held a "bell tower sing" during orientation
week to attract first-years before the fair.
Rugby players said the late activities

fair prevented them from getting rookies
onto the field in time to play in their first
game this Saturday.
During the first week, the women's
team held an information meeting and
study break for prospective players, who
began practicing with the team. When
more first-years signed up at the activities
fair a week later, "it was pretty difficult for

them," women's rugby team co-president
Nicole Brunda 'O4 said. The team was trying to prepare for Saturday's game, but the

new players still had to learn how to tackle.
"We definitely liked it better last year,"
Brunda said.

"I understand that
Jenny Yim was trying
to be nice to the student
groups on campus, but
it didn't work."
Jenny Blumberg 'O4
Randy Goldstein 'O5, captain of the
men's rugby team, said the team did not
even attend the activities fair this year,
instead choosing to find players during the
first week of classes. "We did our own
recruiting," he said. "We need our rookies
to be at practice almost immediately."
Goldstein also pointed out that firstyears are more likely to join a new activity
during orientation, saying he felt they
were "slightly more interested in exploring
new ventures" before classes start.
Low first-year attendance was another
concern. Blumberg said returning to an
activities fair held before classes would be
beneficial because "all the freshmen came
to the activities fair during orientation.
"I understand that Jenny Yim was trying to be nice to the student groups on campus, but it didn't work," Blumberg said.
Yim acknowledged that there was lower
first-year turnout for the fair but pointed
out that most colleges, including Bryn
Mawr and Haverford, hold their activities
the third or fourth week of classes.

Home value may have less effect on student aid
the 568 Presidents' Working Group, has decided to cap the
amount of home equity they would use in determining a

BY ROCHELLE HENTGES
THE PITT NEWS (U. PITTSBURGH)
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH
In this time of increasing
tuition rates, it is getting harder for students and their
families to pay for a higher education.
To help with the cost, students can apply for financial
aid at their respective colleges. To do this, students must
complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid form
and, usually, a financial aid supplement for their school.
Schools have traditionally looked at the net worth of
the student's family, which includes income, real estate
and the value of the primary home, Caroline Hoxby, a
Harvard University economics professor, said.
From this net worth, the family's expected contribution to the cost of education is determined. The financial
need of the student is then determined by subtracting the
expected family contribution by the total cost of attendance. The more net worth a family has, the more they are
expected to contribute, and the less financial aid students
from that family receive.
"When colleges do look at [the value of the home], it's
a measure 0f... the savings a family has," Hoxby said. "It
is a form of wealth."
But "some people feel that [their home]
is not the
same as having cash in the bank," and should not be treated as such, Hoxby said. In order to use their homes to pay
for college costs, families would either have to sell them or
take out a second mortgage.
"People don't feel comfortable taking out a second
mortgage," though, because it is essentially another loan
...

to pay off, Hoxby said.

To address this issue, a group of 28 colleges, known as

THE PHOENIX

student's financial need.
Named after Section 568 of the Improving America's
Schools Act, the 28 colleges, which include Yale and
Columbia
universities
and
the
of
University
Pennsylvania, discussed and agreed upon common principles in determining the financial need of students.
Families will still be expected to contribute as much as
5 percent of their home equity toward education costs, but
now the colleges will cap home equity at 2.4 times the
amount of the parents' annual incomes.
Home equity is determined by subtracting what is still
owed on the house from its current market value.
For example, if a student's parents make $60,000 a year
and own a home worth $350,000, but owe $50,000 on it, their
home equity is $300,000. This home equity would then be
capped at 2.4 times their income of $60,000, or $144,000.
So, with this new policy, the family's expected contri-

bution would be less.
While the policy would not affect families with homes
less than 2.4 times their income or families whose annual
income, in itself, is too high, it can affect those
who own a valuable house, perhaps because of
inflation or an inheritance, but don't make much
money.

When a school looks at the value of a home to
determine the expected family contribution,
they have to ask about the home value in a
Financial Aid Supplemental Form designed by
the school. The FAFSA only asks about the value
of real estate other than the primary home.
At Carnegie Mellon University, 62 percent of
incoming freshmen for this year received an

September

IX 2003

average of $23,000 in financial aid. The average total cost
of attendance at CMU is $39,900 a year.
According to Trevor Rusert, Associate Director for
Admissions and Financial Aid at CMU, the student population includes people from all over the country. By taking
home equity into account, it "could negatively impact any
students where there's a high cost of living," he said.
Large populations of CMU's students come from the
New York or Washington, D.C., metro area, where the cost
of living is extremely high, he added.
"I'm glad that we don't consider [home equity] at
Carnegie Mellon
because I think it makes us more
attractive to students," Rusert said. By not taking home
equity into account, and by still offering merit awards,
CMU can "compete with Ivy League schools that don't
offer scholarships," he said.
Rusert said CMU is the exception, since many colleges
do take home equity into account when determining
...

...

financial need.
"Universities are looking to save money," he said, and
they can do this by looking at a family's home equity,
because it decreases the amount of financial aid awarded.

(and stay in the U.S.)

Swarthmore faculty will no longer use electronic reserves but will
instead upload assigned readings onto Blackboard, an online course
management tool first introduced on campus in the spring of 2001

The libraries, which administered e-reserves, made the decision to

switch to Blackboard starting this semester. While both systems
could present documents online, Blackboard also allows users to communicate with each other, according to Information Technology
Services Academic Computing Coordinator Elizabeth Evans.
Using a single platform also eliminates the confusion that comes
from different professors using different programs, Access and
Lending Services Supervisor Alison Masterpasqua said.
To facilitate the switch, ITS, which is responsible for running
Blackboard on campus, ran workshops for faculty before the semester began. In addition, each faculty member is paired off with a support personnel from ITS, McCabe or Cornell, Evans said.
Blackboard is more flexible than e-reserves and allows faculty to

choose how they organize their course material.
Under this program, the professors themselves, not the library,

will upload the readings onto their class pages, Masterpasqua said.
The change has prompted a range of reactions from the faculty,
according to Social Science Librarian Megan Adams. Some, she said,
were excited about being able to structure course materials they way
they want to, while others were a "little less than thrilled" about having to do the initial upload of files one by one onto their pages.
Some features of Blackboard include online discussion boards,
group file exchange and links to other sites, all of which were not
available under e-reserves.
Currently, there are 164 courses actively using Blackboard. ITS
recently added 36 gigabytes of storage space to the server, bringing
the total capacity to around 50 gigabytes, according to Evans.
Evans said that when Blackboard first came to Bryn Mawr,
Haverford and Swarthmore in 2001, it was paid for by a two-year
Mellon Foundation grant. Now the college will pay about $20,000 per
year for licensing and maintenance of Blackboard.

Ezy-Pass speeds up lines
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

In an attempt to reduce the
lines at the entrance to Sharpies,
dining hall staff have instituted a
system to channel students using
alternative methods of meal payment away from those using the
board plan.
A sign that reads "Meals only

this side" was placed above the
left

checker

counter

in

the

Sharpies lobby last Thursday, initiating the new Ezy-Pass system.
Now, only students using the'
board plan will be able to check in

at the left counter. Patrons using
other

methods

of

payment,

including cash, points and departmental charges, must use the
right counter.
The system is a response to
the overwhelming lines of stu-

dents trying to get into the dining
hall area, particularly at 12:30
p.m. when most students are getting out of classes and heading to
lunch, said Dining Services
Administrative Assistant Lynn
Grady.

"The Ezy-Pass idea actually

came from the way the card readers operate," said Scott Tutton,
back-of-house manager for Dining
Services. "On the new card readers, meals and points transactions are on separate screens. It
only takes a moment to switch
between screens, but we thought
it might make a difference if one
checker were always in meal
mode."

Ezy-Pass has made work for
the employee at the counter much
easier, said Nazma Alam and
Jeanine Gadbois, checkers at
Sharpies."Ezy-Pass is working
really well," Gadbois said. "I wish
they all had just meals instead of
using the cash box or the stupid
sticker book."
Sasha Laundy 'O6 agreed with
the employees. "There's never a
line on the Ezy-Pass side of the
entrance. It's definitely much
faster," she said. But Laundy said
there was still a problem in the
serving area of Sharpies.
"I haven't noticed any change
in the serving area of Sharpies
because of Ezy-Pass," Laundy
said. "It's still extremely crowded
downstairs at lunch."
Tutton said overcrowding of
the food serving area occurs
every year during the first few
weeks of classes.
"We started bag lunches this
week and saw an immediate
impact," Tutton said. "As the year
progresses, students' schedules
change, course work becomes
more demanding, and people eat
elsewhere or at different times."
As for plans to alleviate the
overcrowdingproblem in the food
serving area, Tutton said none
were currently in the works.
"I try to tell students to allow
for more time when getting lunch
during the busiest times," Tutton
said. "However, there isn't much
we can do to help the situation
aside from expanding the food
serving area."

Professor's move shocks biology department
BY DEVI RAMKISSOON

dramkisl@swarthmore.edu

After 28 years of teaching in the biology department at
Swarthmore, professor Mark Jacobs left last May to
become the dean of the newly formed Barret Honors
College of Arizona State University.
"It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build a residential four-year college from the ground up, both figuratively and literally," Jacobs said in an e-mail Monday.
He served as associate provost at Swarthmore for three

years, a position from which he learned that he enjoyed
academic administration. He said he wanted to try to make
improvements in the American collegiate system in a new
context and this was an opportunity that he said he "just
couldn't resist."
Jacobs' decision was a shock to everyone, said professor and biology department chair Amy Vollmer. Jacobs did

not reveal his intention to leave until the end of May, she

said.
The move was also a surprise to students, many of
whom did not know that he had left permanently until
they returned to campus this year. Vollmer said several
students were planning on taking courses taught by
Jacobs, only to discover they could no longer do so. He was
the only member in the department that specialized in
plant physiology with an emphasis on study on a cellular
level.
Charlie Buffie 'O6 was one of Jacobs's advisees and a
potential biology major.
"I had no idea that he wasn't coming back," Buffie said.
He said that Jacobs was a "genuinely warm person" who
had a sincere interest in his career at Swarthmore.
Neurobiology professor Kathleen Siwicki said Jacobs
had left because he realized how much he enjoyed aca-

demic administration.
"It seemed like it was the right thing for him," she said.
Although saddened by the loss, Vollmer and Siwicki
said they believed there was now a good opportunity for
the department to examine its curriculum and to adjust it
to suit new developments in plant research. Vollmer said
she hoped the professor replacing Jacobs would bring new
File photo

ideas for the students to learn from and new technology to
share with the department. She said a person who has

most recently left graduate school "can relate to students
in a new, more youthful way."
The department plans to hire a new professor in the
spring of 2004, Vollmer said, and would likely begin teaching classes in the following fall semester.

"It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to build a residential four-year
college from the ground up, both
figuratively and literally."
Professor Mark Jacobs
Buffie said he hoped the new professor would specialize
in plant defense, something he thinks will add to the
department. Although he shared Vollmer's sadness, he
said he will be able to "persevere professionally" with the
help ofhis new adviser, Julie Hagelin, a professor who specializes in animal behavior.
Vollmer stressed that the biology department worked
as a team. Although a valued friend and teammate is
gone, they will continue to operate as best they can, she
said, and they hope to find another teammate who will
add to their efforts in making the biology department
function at an optimal level. However, Vollmer said, the
department will continue to gain from Jacobs' experience
and input.
"There is no danger whatsoever that I won't come back
and visit and also stay in touch," Jacobs said.

Mark Jacobs will be the dean of a new honors college.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Harvard seeks dismissal
164 Boston U. firstyears living in hotels of Crimson lawsuit
BY JASON ABBRUZZESE
THE DAILY FREE PRESS (BOSTON U.)
(U-WIRE) BOSTON
An overflow of
incoming freshmen at Boston University
has again forced housing officials to
employ local hotels to house students.

The Hotel Commonwealth and the

Holiday Inn Boston will accommodate 164

students
a significant reduction from
the 470 students housed in the Hyatt
Regency and Cambridge Radisson during
the fall semester last year.
BU Office of Housing Director Marc
Robillard says BU chose new hotels this
year because the hotels used last year were
too far from campus.
"Both of those properties were good to
the students and administration and we
may do business with them again, but
going over that river put the students at a
disadvantage," Robillard says.
Due to slight shifts in male and female
admittance at BU, the Holiday Inn has only
male
students
while
Hotel
the

Commonwealth has only female students.
"It's hard to anticipate slight shifts in
who is accepted into the university,"
Robillard says. "We try to anticipate as
best we can for housing, but if we're off by
only 1 percent that can be as many as 100
people."

Robillard says BU's policy guaranteeing
housing as long as undergraduates qualify
to stay on campus has caused the need for
hotel housing.
"Our commitment is that any undergraduate student who remains in good
financial academic and judicial standing
will have housing," he says. "Therefore, we

THE PHOENIX

have difficulties making spots for every-

one."
Robillard also says he believes students
will find the hotel rooms more than accom-

modating because they all have Ethernet,
semiweekly maid service and

air condi-

tioning. Also, the men living at the Holiday
Inn get free transportation passes.
Sophomore Karesia Batan says she
remembered the Radisson's relaxed security more than the fully furnished rooms last
fall.
"Anyone could visit without having to
show ID or signing in," Batan says. "The
most security our hotel had was a night
watch guy who stayed at the front desk.
Having the freedom to come and go as we
pleased was nice."
Ariel Pizzitola, a sophomore, echoes
those sentiments and says moving onto
campus has been difficult.
"The security issue is a trade off
because we can't have overnight guests
whenever we want and at the Radisson it
was never an issue. It's (also) very difficult
to plan your day around a shuttle that only
comes every half hour," he says, referring
to the shuttles BU provided.
Robillard says these frustrations factored into this year's hotel selections,
which do not require the university to run
shuttle buses.
"The Hotel Commonwealth was in a perfect location being right in Kenmore
Square, and the Holiday Inn is an eightminute walk to campus and is right on the
C Line," Robillard says.
Robillard says students living in the
hotels will move to on-campus residences
at the end of the fall semester.

HARVARD CRIMSON (HARVARD U.)

(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
Harvard University has asked a judge to
throw out a lawsuit filed by The Crimson

that seeks to force the Harvard

University

Police Department to release detailed
crime reports.
The Crimson, represented by the
American Civil Liberties Union, is suing
after a number of request for HUPD officers' investigation notes were denied.
In a pair of briefs exchanged in the
month since the suit was filed, Harvard
and The Crimson have begun to hash out
the legal issue central to the case
whether HUPD officers are subject to

Massachusetts public records law.
The Crimson argued in their complaint
that because HUPD officers are special

state police officers deputized in Middlesex
and Suffolk counties, they should be subject to the records law, which stipulates
that records produced by agents of public

institutions be available upon request.
Harvard responded in an Aug. 18
motion that the court should dismiss The
Crimson's complaint, because it fails to
show that Harvard or HUPD is a public

entity.

The brief cites Massachusetts General
Law, which lists several broad groups
"any agency, executive office, board commission of the Commonwealth" whose
records qualify as public. Because Harvard
is a private institution by law, and since
campus police officers are not mentioned
specifically in the law, the statute does not
apply to HUPD, Harvard argues.
Harvard concludes in the brief that
HUPD reports do not qualify as public
...

records although the officers who created

them are endowed with "quasi-govern-

mental powers."
In a Sept. 5 brief, The Crimson opposed
Harvard's motion, claiming that Harvard
misunderstood the crux of the original
argument. The brief reiterates that
although Harvard remains a private institution, its individual officers may still act
as governmental agents.
The Crimson claims HUPD officers are
endowed with powers that mirror those of
municipal forces, adding that those power
designations are ample justification for
HUPD officers to qualify as agents of the
state whose records fall under public
records law. They argue that the extent of
the powers held by HUPD officers also jus-

tifies an expansive reading of the public

records statutes.
"[The plaintiff is] saying, in effect, that
The Crimson can prove no set of facts that
would entitle The Crimson to access HUPD
records," the brief states. "The Crimson is
entitled to discovery and to create a full
record on the nature of the appointments
held by Harvard's police officers and the
scope of the authority they hold."
At the time the suit was filed, officials
argued that releasing detailed records that
could contain revealing personal information about students could violate their
right to privacy.
Crimson President Amit R. Paley

'O4

said Sunday that he is optimistic about the
paper's chances.

"The Crimson is confident that the

courts will find that HUPD is subject to the
same laws as every other police department in the Commonwealth and that the
interests of the community are best served
by opening these records," he said.

New theater professor
energizes department
BY ROZINA ALI
ralil@swarthmore.edu
The theater department will start the

new academic year looking markedly
different with a restructured Honors
Program and a newly hired full-time professor.
According to Department Chair Allan
Kuharski, Erin Mee will teach a variety
of courses as well as strengthen the new
Honors Program for theater majors with
her knowledge and experience in direct-

ing and acting.

This year marks the first time the

department will produce honors thesis
projects in acting,

all of which go up

in April. Honors
students will be
allowed to submit
creative projects
as senior honors
theses, which was
impossible

before

[College

"Eight or ten years ago, it would be
one honors major and five course
majors," he added. "It's a great incentive
for students to take honors because they
have this opportunity to do a whole funded individual work or group project, and
they get the privilege of working with
...

off-campus artists."

Kuharski also mentioned Mee as an

example of how the Honors Program has

been strengthened.

someone who can mentor them in the
academic areas of the field."
As instructor in Acting I, 11, and 111,
Mee is also the first full time professor in
the department to teach the entire
sequence of acting classes. Kuharski
believes this will also allow her to serve
as a mentor for students whose interests
are in acting and/or directing.
"It's cool to have Erin here and know
that she's going to be here for a while, so
I can really go to her for advice, and
that's a beautiful thing," said Neil

this week, Mee noted that this was the

"[The students'] verbal skills are
higher here, but also there was an
extraordinary generosity of spirit with
which they approached the exercise,"

Mee said.
While teaching courses, Mee will also
be directing a mainstage production that
will be performed in the spring, along
with the senior honors thesis projects.
Kuharski noted that in addition to

her experience and background in theater, he was further impressed by Mee's
interest in the creation of a foreign
study program in India for theater and
dance.
The theater department currently has
two similar programs in Poland and
Ghana, but Kuharski agrees that since
Swarthmore is moving towards a more

international focus in education, another program would be great in expanding
the scope of the department.
The idea for a program in India, however, will probably not be realized for a
few years because Mee is a new professor who is still in the process of getting
accustomed to Swat life. Kuharski is
sure, though, that the program will happen.

Anyone who frequents the Tarble game

the game room, already in bad shape, bore
the brunt of it. The game room closet was
broken into and supplies were stolen from

Jenny Yim said that tighter security
measures will be implemented this year,
but she cannot comment on the specifics.
"Lots of options are being thrown
around," she said, explaining that the

further break-ins.
Due to a hectic beginning-of-term utilities schedule, these repairs have not been

Caroline comes from outside of Boston. Her mother is
Parisian and has managed several retail establishments
and schooled her well in the Holy Trinity of fashion:
Vogue, W, and Bazaar. She went to high school with a

Oriana comes from three of the hairiest heritages of the
world: India, Italy and France. She's been waxed and defurred so much she is now numb to pain. Because of this,
she is very knowledgeable about beauty and self-maintenance because frankly, if she weren't, she'd be a gorilla.
Moreover she spent the first 18 years of her life as a fashion apprentice under the guidance of her mother, a former
model (clearly Oriana was adopted) and entrepreneur.
Finally, Oriana spent her entire summer in Paris in the
high-powered world of advertising, where face it, the only
thing deep about people in advertising is their wallets.
In short, the two of us are well-versed in the world of

Preparing 'A Delicate Balance'

At a first glance, the members of this year's senior
Felicia Leicht 'O4, Audrey Pernell 'O4,
company
Rebecca Ennen 'O4, Mark Boucai 'O4, Adrienne Mackey
'O4, Sam Dingman 'O4, Matthew Fitting 'O5, and Maria
Alvarez 'O4
seem to have little in common. They're
not all seniors, they're not all theater majors, and a few
of them never imagined that they, too, would someday
undertake the enormous, semester-long project that has
become a tradition at Swarthmore College. But they all
agree that they are definitely excited to be putting on a

show together.

Every year, as a graduation requirement, the college's senior theater majors produce, direct, and act in a
play performed at the end of the first semester. This
year, the company will be performing Edward Albee's "A
Delicate Balance," a story that Mackey, a co-director,
describes as "about a family a husband, a wife, her sister, and a daughter, and what happens over the course of
two days when two friends come to visit." Rounding out
the cast is Maria Alvarez, a senior history major, and
Matthew Fitting, a junior theater major.
"The script magically just appeared," says Leicht.
"We were in the library one afternoon, surrounded by
piles and piles of plays, and we saw this play, and we all
-

it around and everyone liked it." The company
members provided many reasons for singing the play's
praises. Says Mackey, "Albee's an amazing writer
his
material is so juicy. We wanted a play that gives each
actor an opportunity to dig into their characters." "And
the language," adds Boucai, the other co-director,
"there's so much there. It's beautiful, dense and rich."
Confident in their choice of a play, the actors are
excited for the roles they will soon be performing. "It's
deceptive that you only see two days in their lives," says

Dingman, "because these are all incredibly complex people." Adds Pernell, "The characters are fun to play,
because you love and hate them at the same time.
They're not terribly lovable and that makes them more

interesting."

With two directors, the company is expecting the
process of putting the show together to be an interesting
one. "[Mackey and I] direct in completely, totally different ways. We each focus on different aspects, but it's
going to work," says Boucai. Adds Alvarez, "It's exciting
to have two different directors, like a team taught class."
Having two directors "makes rehearsals really different
and fun," echoes Pernell. Everyone meshes with different things and everybody is able to find something in
rehearsal that works for them." Having already memorized their lines, the six actors and are now working on
blocking and interpretation of characters.
All in all, the company members express confidence
in each other's abilities and the production as a whole.
"This company is really rare in that every one (and this
is not cheesy 8.5.) respects each other as artists," says
Mackey. "Such synergy and focus I have not seen."
Perhaps Leicht sums it up best: "We're eight Swatties
pulling a play apart. There's not much left that doesn't
get dissected."

Thirteen' shows teen tendency to aim for the bottom
BY ESTER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu
America is struggling more now than ever before to zero
in on the pre-teen demographic, whose spending power
drives everything from movies to pop music to new clothing
styles. Presently, America is trying to absorb what these
"tweens" want and, at the same time, supply it by offering
option after option after option.
From this obsession with the young and the mess it has
created comes a new movie, one that can be safely said to be
different from all the others. "Thirteen" begins with the
same questions who are thesekids? what turns them on?
but establishes itself as a film that's far more substantial
and visually interesting than its size zero subjects.
The buzz-worthy backstory of "Thirteen" has been featured in several newspapers from Variety to the Washington
Post. First-time director and writer Catherine Hardwicke
enlisted 13-year-old Nikki Reed to help her make a movie
about Nikki's experience.
After co-writing the script and advising Hardwicke,
Nikki auditioned to play Tracy, the role based on herself. She
didn't make it. Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy and Nikki
appears in the film as Evie, a manipulative, charismatic girl
who needs Tracy desperately and leads her astray.
Tracy starts out a pretty run-of-the-mill girl growing up
in Los Angeles with a hippie ex-alcoholic for a mother and
an absentee workaholic dad. Tracy's mom, played with
intensity by Holly Hunter, is a little scattered but clearly
dotes on Tracy while also managing to raise Tracy's older
brother, work, feed neighborhood children, help out her

equally scattered hippie friends and date a recovering crack

addict (Elton from

"Clueless").

Tracy, by contrast, has it together. She has good friends,
she gets good grades. Her mom even seems to be in awe of
her. But Tracy is in awe of Evie, the classic fashionable

THE PHOENIX

embodiment of the Bad Girl, and, when Evie offers her the
chance to be her friend, Tracy doesn't think twice.
From that point, in fact, Tracy barely ever thinks. She
lets Evie lead her into a whirl of drugs, drinking, shoplifting,
piercing, and casual sex-like activity. Perhaps most crucially, she stops eating. Her older brother's early warning, "You
get mean when you don't eat," is like a stop sign that Tracy
zooms through at 70 miles an hour.
Her old friends, her teachers, her brother and her mom
watch, equally helpless, as Tracy applies the Type A
instincts she once put toward success toward self-destruction. Seduced by the idea of total weightlessness, Tracy jettisons everything that used to matter to her. Evie's rebellions,
by contrast, seem unfocused. Even though Evie is the ostensible leader, Tracy commands the viewer's attention as the
stronger, goal-oriented character, the one truly intent on hit-

ting bottom.
"Fight Club" and "Girl, Interrupted" have also dealt with
this issue recently: the compulsion of otherwise normal people to hit bottom with the help of an edgier, more attractive
person of the same gender. In "Thirteen," the otherwise normal person happens to be a 13-year-old white girl in L.A., so
she uses the tools available to her and responds to the cultural norms of that place.
Primarily, that is what this film is about: not what 13year-old white girls

are like, but the way that one can hit bot-

tom by following the American media's cues. One motif in
the film is an ad of a huge blank model's face with "Beauty
is Truth" written across it. Tracy embraces this, uncritically, on the way down.
Another one of Tracy's least self-conscious choices is

using the black boys that the media informs her are erotic
and exotic. She sees this as being color-blind, murmuring
after one hookup, "If everyone dated someone of another
race, there'd be no prejudice." Black girls, however, exist
nowhere in her sphere of vision, not even as friends, and the
SeDtember 11 2003

sex acts themselves seem only to bring her closer to Evie.
The film remains at enough of a distance from Tracy that
the viewer can sympathize with her and her mother as both
fall apart. The casting of Hunter and Wood, virtual lookalikes, as mother and daughter creates a strong visual bond
between the two. The casting of Nikki Reed as Evie makes
her, on a meta level, more sympathetic: if Reed as an actor
can portray Evie, it helps the viewer understand Evie as just
another flawed person too. There's no real villain in
"Thirteen" except our soulless culture, just as there's no real
lesson, except maybe love your mom and yourself.

stupid.
For example, last
week, a freshman asked

me where McCabe was.

I told him he was stupid, then tried to find
someone who knew.
Anyone with half a brain on top of his shoulders knows
that I couldn't tell McCabe from a hole in the ground.
Some activist-types might worry that freshmen will be
offended when they read this column. There is no cause for
concern, however, because most freshmen don't even
know how to read. Let me explain. I was at a party this
weekend, and I saw a sign clearly stating the Pennsylvania
state law that people under the age of 21 are not permitted
to consume alcoholic beverages. Well, you might find it
hard to believe, but I actually saw not one, not two, but several freshmen consuming alcoholic beverages. Apparently
none of them could read the sign.
Now, I know what you're probably thinking: Maybe
these freshmen were 2L If so, they are even stupider than I
first thought. A 21-year-old freshman? Ha, ha (we laugh),
freshmen are all 14, stupid.
By the way, when we say 'freshmen,' we don't mean to
exclude freshwomen. Rest assured, they are at least as stupid as freshmen, if not more so. It just takes longer to type

'freshmen-or-women' or 'freshfolk.'
Things have sure changed a lot since we arrived at
Swarthmore. Back then, freshmen weren't stupid. They
were just regular people like us. As each year has pro-

gressed, however, freshmen have gotten stupider and stupider. Now look what we're stuck with. I hardly recognize
a single person on this campus any more. This is clearly
because freshmen are stupid.
Whatever happened to admissions requirements?
If you happen to be a freshman (stupid), you might be
thinking to yourself, "Dun, me no want is stupid be no
more." Tough nuts! Stupid goes on freshmen like white on
rice. Or like piss on a urinal. Or like Bill on
um, Ted.
A lot of people have asked us lately, "Aren't freshmen
stupid?" Yes! Haven't you been paying attention to our column? We honestly don't think we can make our stance on
this any clearer. But we're glad you agree with us (stupid).
Lest you get the impression that freshmen are the only
stupid things around, here's a list of other things we know
are stupid: sophomores, juniors, seniors, super-seniors, professors, freshfolk, babies, Nalgene bottles and first-years.
Seriously, sometimes I swear the whole world is stupid

On the first day of my college life, my dad climbed into
the super-sized Adirondack chair on Parrish beach and
surveyed the campus like a king. Horrible thoughts ran
through my head. He had violated my first and most
important rule
don't draw attention to yourself! People
might see him! I was so embarrassed by his carefree
parental nonchalance that I called him on my cell phone
at a safe distance away and ordered him off the chair.
Everyone gets embarrassed at some time or another,
sorry, excuse my political
most often in your freshman
first-year. No one has enough aweincorrectness
inspiring coolness to avoid the inevitable. Thanks to
those few of you brave enough to own it.
Embarrassing moments range from frustrating to tragic. For Qing 'O7, it was aimlessly meandering around
Cornell on a Saturday morning, looking for a biology lab
and discovering only one locked door after another. For
Humbled Break Dancer 'O7, who wished to remain anonymous (like so many others), it was the following drama: "I
was at the Paces party the night it opened, dancing with a
girl. She asked me about my break dancing moves, so I
tried to do a few. I wasn't that good. A really big upperclassman started making fun of me. He kept saying, 'Whoa,
break dancing here, break dancing here.' I got pissed. I told
him to do certain special things and I gave him the finger.
At that point I noticed the red plastic cup in his hand. He
was obviously drunk. He walked up to me and pushed me
really hard and said, 'F*** me?' I apologized, but he was too
drunk to care. A bigger upperclassman dragged him out,
but, for the next five minutes, he kept trying to force his
way back in. Eventually he disappeared."
The lesson in all this? Don't let people keep you from
following your dreams. All you searchers for the open
door to the science lab, don't give up until you find the
one that is unlocked. All you mediocre break dancers out
there, keep spinning. Don't let the big man get you down.
Then there are the typical fishy blunders. "I left my
key with my roommate, so I was locked out of my dorm
room. My RA had to wake up another RA to get the key,"
reports Annie Hansen, class of 2007. A laundry room confession by another anonymous first year: "I was doing
laundry for the first timeand there were two other guys,
upperclassmen, I think, there with me. I wasn't very
graceful and while I was loading my wet things into the
dryer a thong fell out onto the floor. I threw it in quickly
and slammed the door. I don't think they even noticed
but my face got really hot." Of course, the first week of
college isn't complete without the nightmare classroom
entrance. "I went to choir for the first day and got there
late. Everyone was on stage and the director was standing with his back to me," said Jaselyn Justiniano 'O7. "I
dropped my stuff and walked towards the stage.

was staring and laughing at me while the
director continued teaching. I waited 10 minutes for him
to see me. He finally turned around and gave me a desk.

Everyone

While I was loading my wet things
into the dryer, a thong fell out onto
the floor.
I sat down and just put my head down."
But what about lordly upperclassmen? Surely they
never did anything embarrassing in their first year. Still,
it was worth asking. It turns out that alcohol-related
episodes are the first ones to emerge from memory. One
anonymous junior admitted that she got so drunk during
freshman orientation that she had to be carried up several
flights of stairs by a guy to her dorm room. And this from
a sophomore: "The second week of Bio, I came to class with
a hangover and sat with a cold water bottle on my head. I
kept thinking, if I have to throw up, will I make it in my
bag? I managed to walk out without doing so." Another
sophomore remembered when she fell down the stairs in
Tarble; that's the only part of the night she recalls.
Further inquiry resulted in a few sober recoUections.
"I was sledding down hill during winter break my freshman year," a sophomore said, "and there was this tour
group watching me and, like, cheering me on. I sled by
them and knocked into a tree. The group watched the
whole time. They kept asking, Are you OK?'" One junior
told of getting lost coming back from Springfield Mall. "I
had to stop at houses and knock on the door for directions,
and it was already the end of the semester!" she said.
The most embarrassing first-year moment of all lasted more than a moment. It lasted for all of orientation
and was shared by myself and all other fish in Parrish.
Having just been uprooted from our familial MTV, each
of us in turn explored our way to the upper-story lounge
to see our favorite shows. No matter when we went, there
was always the same guy there. We figured he was one of
us, even if all he ever seemed to watch was of the XXX
variety. But no one would ask him to watch something
different or take programming turns. Why wasn't he
going to any of the activities? Did he ever leave? Was he
living there? As things turned out, he was living there.
As a squatter. Campus security resolved the situation,
but we found ourselves both incredibly embarrassed and
relieved. Embarrassed that we had let the situation go on
as long as we had, but relieved that, though we may view
ourselves as a little weird, we weren't that weird.

Splashy, flashy or just plain nasty
BY LISA GUNAYDIN
lgunaydl@swarthmore.edu
It's 6 p.m. and you've just finished huffing, puffing,
and pumping iron at the gym after a full day of classes,
running on two hours of sleep. You're exhausted, about
to collapse, but you manage to lug your backpack and
your gym bag back to the dorm and up three flights of
stairs. Of course, there's no air conditioning. The only
relief you can hope for is a long, cold drink of water. But
that's not always what you'll get from Swarthmore's
water fountains. If you need water and need it fast, here

are some fountains to avoid.
1) The "water gun" on the third floor of Kohlberg.
Stopping here is only a good choice if you're in desperate need of a midday shower. As Lillian Dunn 'O7 said,
"it squirts on the wall and drips to the f100r... I always
wonder if it's going to damage the carpet." Other students show more concern for their own safety than for
the condition of the carpet. Henry Swift 'O7 says of his

recent water fountain assault, "It reminded me of an
angry llama. It spit water all over my face."
2) The "nah-nah-boo-boo-you-can't-figure-out-how-toturn-me-on" fountain on Ist floor Parrish. This automated water fountain certainly has fun teasing stu-

dents. On her way past the post office, Julia Morrison
'O7 stopped here for a quick drink. She searched for a
button but couldn't find one. She waved her hands furiously in front of the fountain; nothing happened. As she
turned away in frustration, suddenly a jet of water shot
out, causing her to jump back, startled. "Just when you
give up, that's when it goes off!" As Morrison reacted to
her experience, the fountain went off again at whim,
and again she gave a little surprised hop. The administration may have installed this fountain to frighten
intruders away from the mail room, or maybe just to
provide a little entertainment for the offices across the
hall.
3) "The miser" in the Field House lobby. Many athletes have qualms about this stingy fountain, which

only dispenses eight ounces of water at a time. "I hate
that thing!" complained Natalie Dunphy 'O5. "Yeah,
there's nothing worse than coming back from a hard
practice and only being able to drink one cup of water,"

Nobody seems to understand
why, of all places, this fountain is located in the athletic
center. To those looking for just a quick sip, however,
this fountain might seem more wasteful than anything
else, since it won't shut itself off until it churns out
exactly eight ounces. So is this fountain stingy or overly generous? Is the glass half empty or half full? A few
questions to ponder while you're waiting for the next
eight ounces.
Dorm water fountains tend to be less idiosyncratic,

Val Marone 'O5 added.

with a few exceptions like the moody Mertz fountains.
One day they're not working. The next day they won't
turn off. In Mertz, it's hit or miss this year. Maintenance
crews have so far done a good job of preventing dehydration and flooding in the building. And, on a good day,
there isn't a bad word to be said about Mertz's cold,

great-tasting water.
Parrish residents enjoy similarly palatable, wellchilled water. In Parrish, however, you have to work to
get your drink. The first-floor fountain is, well, to be
avoided, unless you've mastered the fine art of activating its sensor system, and the second floor has no easily
accessible water fountain. Only on the highest floors are
you rewarded with a nice cold drink for the grueling
hike up four or five flights of stairs. It's work hard, play
hard here. Even for water.
The most complaints about residential water fountains

come, curiously enough, from third-floor Wharton. They
are, according to Sophie Horowitz 'O7, 'as warm as bath
water" and "very, very noisy." Our sympathies are surely

with the Wharton residents for their great misfortune.
If you happen to live in a dorm with dysfunctional
and antiquated drinking fountains, have been humiliated by the automatic fountain in Parrish, or been assailed
by Kohlberg's jet d'eau, just remember one thing.
There will always be bottled water.

Swarthmore in a new light: a look at a guide to Swat history
BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu

When I first arrived on campus two
weeks ago, I received my first year orientation packet, a large and thick brown
envelope filled with countless pieces of
paper describing how the college operates
and its academic offerings. As I rummaged
through the contents, waves of anxiety and
anticipation flowing though my bones, I
caught sight of a small burgundy pamphlet. It wasn't another listing of courses,

nor was it information about opening a
bank account or other assorted business
handlings. Interested, I pulled it out of its
confines and read the words, "Thoughts on
Swarthmore: A New Student's Guide to the

College's History." Normally, I would have
seen something like that and immediately
pushed it aside. I mean, who really wants
to hear old boring stories about the school
they're going to anyway? Curiosity, however, did kill the cat, and I settled down to
begin reading. What I found inside were
not the usual cheesy and trite facts, but
instead a thoughtful and innovative take
on Swarthmore's history.
Written by Jed S. Rakoff (Class of 1964),
who is currently a United States District
Judge, and Harrison M. Wright, a
Professor of History at Swat from 19571993, the 16-page booklet outlines quirky
facts about the school using slogans that
students have probably heard, but never
knew the origins of. For example, how else
would you realize that the phrase "Mind
the Light" is not a lost line from the movie
"Poltergeist" but rather a peaceful mentality rooted in the ideals of the Quakers? Or
that the popular "Guilt without Sex" is a

THE PHOENIX

quote reminiscent of Swarthmore's begin-

nings, in which social interaction between
males and females was pretty much nonexistent? These anecdotes and more about
the history of the college are illustrated
with precision and humor.
Where did the idea to make such a pamphlet originate? Director of Alumni
Relations Lisa Lee 'Bl says it came purely
from Rakoff s head. This is true, as Rakoff

that
Swarthmore was at one point an all-girls'
school. (Not true.) Rakoff speaks candidly
about the booklet in which he reveals that
most first years (and the occasional upperclassman) do not have the opportunity to
read a short and simple overview of

Swarthmore's history. Thus the guide was
born.
The booklet took a year to create and
was done in two stages. The first six
months
were largely reserved for
research, in which both Rakoff and Wright
read everything from countless Ph.D. theses to various books about the college. The
Alumni Relations department was integral
in this stage by providing the books about
Swarthmore, some situated right in the
library. Interestingly enough, the Internet
was also a place to find information. "The
Web is a wonderful thing," Rakoff said,
admitting that search engines are a helpful
way to come across research materials.

stage were used to write, and the last three

College from 1902 to 1921) still does not
have a building or fund named in his
honor, the pamphlet provides the tools to

"no censorship" during the making of the
guide, even though it illustrates the "college's good points and not-so-good points."
Could he be referring to the Swarthmore
graduate who attempted to blow up the
IBM offices in New York City? Yes, that
blurb is also in this eye-opening and comprehensive work.

It's the second week of classes, so
of course it feels like finals week at
one of those "other" schools. Face it,
you're stressed. You need a break.
You need a massage.

GO AWAY

If you want to learn how to give
massages to deserving classmates,
while getting all the kinks in your
neck worked out at the same time,

head on over to the first Swarthmore
massage classes next Monday and
watch that stress melt awwaaayyy

There are too many people at this school. Or at least that's what
everybody is saying. Two people squashed into one single, overflowing lines in Sharpies, over-enrolled classes, sharing mailboxes.
And whose fault is it? Yours.
Yes, you in your fifth year. Graduate already. You, junior feeling
all cozy with four semesters in Swat's warm embrace under your
belt. Go abroad, travel just get out of the country. You, freshman
who didn't look at any other schools. There were better colleges out
really. You, standing on the line for wing bar. Why don't
there
you get a bag lunch? You, living on campus for your senior year?
There are plenty of nice apartments in the ville, without the chatter of your asinine classmates.
And you, bitterly complaining about the overcrowding of

the cruelty of caging these beautiful creatures in fish tanks, and
the dangers of the increasing shark population after strict shark

PDC? W? So?
Student Couricil and the administration have been flooding
our inboxes, holding meeting after meeting, getting the student body all in a ruckus with their sound and fury over the
complete overhaul of the college's academic requirements

and, in the end, signified, if not nothing, not that much.
The most obvious feature of the great PDC-to-W switch is
that it's not actually a switch: "writing" courses may be a
more descriptive label than "primary distribution courses,"
but the definition is exactly the same. Perhaps changing the
label will help them weed out PDCs that ought not be PDCs,
but getting our act together over mislabeled courses isn't
exactly a revolutionary idea, is it?
As far as the first-year seminar idea, departments where
first-year seminars are useful and professors have the
resources to offer them generally already have them. The idea
of "encouraging" the professors who have chosen not to offer
such courses to change their teaching habits seems a bit presumptuous of the administration, given that professors supposedly know best about how to teach their own courses.
Natural science FYS's, for example, seem a questionable idea.
The only real, major change in policy is the eventual
reduction of PDC
OK, W
requirements to three courses
in two divisions with the compensatory additional requirement of one lab credit. But, under the current system, the
largest and most available science PDCs have been mostly lab
courses anyway.
No, the lab requirement aside, the real change that people
seem to avoid actually naming is that there are going to be
fewer requirements, plain and simple. The class of 2008 can
fulfill all their requirements their pass-fail semester and get
off scot-free for the rest of their Swarthmore career.
Much as this ticks off those of us who came a few years too
early to share in this glorious freedom, it also a few disturbing big-picture implications. We're a liberal arts college, and,
in theory, our first priority ought to be turning out wellrounded Renaissance people.
well, c'mon, virtuA system that could potentially allow
ally guarantees
a completely major-focused curriculum for
many students after one pass-fail semester seems to weaken
this element of Swarthmore's personality in the name of giving students yet more autonomy. (Worked out great for
Brown, didn't it?)
Good idea? Bad idea? Who knows? But the answer to that
question is probably more important than turning "PDC" into
"W" or preaching about how cool seminars are.

Day of mourning has become a political tool
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
Where do we go from here?
That, I think, is the question on everyone's mind as the
United States limps past the second anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks. Some people might argue that the United
States has a clear direction now, 730 days after the attacks.
Aren't we busy pursuing the War on Terror, trying to
make the world a safer place while promoting the spread
of democracy?
I don't think so. In fact, the United States is on shakier ground now than it has been in the last 30 years. Not
since the Vietnam War have Americans been so torn
apart by political conflict and global affairs. While some
people say Americans have become a different people
since Sept. 11, 2001, that we've changed for the better,
we're worse off now than ever before. The one issue symbolic of all of our problems can found right at ground zero
this year. The World Trade Towers, which once represented the strength of the American economy and the triumph of democracy, now represent the worst aspects of
American politics and are symbolic of the problems that
could
jeopardizing the United
some might say are
States' position in global affairs.
No one knows what to do with Sept. 11 or the land at
ground zero. The fight over memorial space and new office
space in Lower Manhattan has become indicative of this
nation's larger political struggles. First, the design committees acted on their own with little feedback from New
Yorkers as to what should be rebuilt over ground zero.

THE PHOENIX

Then, different private and city groups with claims to the
end engaged in the battle over memorial space and available office space. Only recently have the various sides
been able to reach some sort of agreement on the land use
for ground zero.
As with almost everything in America these days, the
fight over ground zero turned into a political battle.
Competing groups were at each other's throats for control
over the land. Instead of realizing the symbolism inherent in the 16 acres of land and the sanctity that millions
of New Yorkers and Americans hold in this site, the different people and organizations saw ways to advance
themselves politically through their wrangling over the

site.

*

In some ways this isn't that much different than the
larger scheme of American politics. President George W.
Bush neglected to visit New York today because his advisers thought it would not be politically beneficial for his
reelection chances. Since Bush and his staff have so thoroughly embroiled themselves in a very murky not-quagmire situation in Iraq over the issue of terrorism, the president's political advisers think that Americans would associate Bush's visiting New York on the anniversary of 9/11
with the recent failures of a quick solution to rebuilding
Iraq. I personally don't care if Bush doesn't visit New York.
In fact, I would rather not have this president come anywhere near my hometown, but Bush should not stay away
because it's politically beneficial for him to hide under the
sheets in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Bush also picked the start of this week as a good time
to request billions of dollars that America does not have
September

IX 2003

in order to sustain the military presence in Iraq. Maybe
Congress will be feeling generous this week, what with
the symbolic nature of Sept. 1L Maybe they'll just approve
a ridiculous budget instead of questioning the location of
the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or the freedom
that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden are still
enjoying because, hey, it's Sept. 11. Bush has taken the
image of Sept. 11 and is using it to overplay his political
advantage.
What then should we do with Sept. 11? As long as Bush
is the president, Sept. 11 and the United States' military
advancements of the past two years will be associated with
each other. Our president has taken a day that should be a
day of memorial and has turned it into a cheap political
advantage.
I think the easiest solution is to take politics away from
Sept. 1L Our government should turn Sept. 11 into a
national holiday. To most people alive today, Sept. 11 would
have more symbolism and meaning in our lives than
Labor Day ever has. Ground zero, the Pentagon and
Pennsylvania crash site should all feature permanent
memorials to those who lost their lives, and the president
could visit any of them for whatever memorial services
were planned for that year.
As American stumble through world politics, it's
important to remember the events of 2001, and it's important to memorialize those who lost their lives. While it is
also vital to move beyond tragedies, there is an appropriate time and place for political maneuvers. The time surrounding Sept. 11 is not and never will be that appropriate
time.

Iraq war a six-year-old
project by conservatives
When Aaron McGruder came to campus last winter, he told us that
there don't need to be any conspiracy theories: Everything we want to
know about the actions of our government can be learned by reading a
newspaper. While I can't say we could ever know it all (and we'd probably lose our lives in a carefully orchestrated "accident" if we did), I
feel that the man spoke to us truthfully. If we can't expect truth in the
mainstream media, then we're going to
have to read between the lines. Take,
for example, what I was turned on to by
picking up a copy of July's Adßusters:
the existence of a club of Washington's
25 staunchest conservatives by the
name of "The Project for the New
American Century."
Imagine what would happen if Dick
Cheney, Jeb Bush, Donald Rumsfeld,
Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle, Henry S.
Rowen, Paul Wolfowitz, William
Kristol, Robert Kagan and everyone's
favorite, Francis Fukuyama, among
others, sat down six years ago and
MARISSA VAHLSING drafted a plan dictating America's role
in the next century. Then imagine if
Progresso Sauce they actually came into power and
implemented it.
They did.
All of us, liberals and conservatives alike, are compelled to see our
recent actions in Iraq as inextricably connected with the events of
Sept. 11, whether on account of al-Qaeda-Saddam relationships or as
another move in the war on terror that began as retribution for that
day's events. However, the plan might have been written and published four years prior to Sept. 11 and before any of the current "reasons" for dismantling Saddam ever materialized. If you visit the Web
site of the Project for the New American Century, you may be appalled
to see the detailed play-by-play of the motives and war plan for removal
of Saddam that was written in 1997 before any evidence of his nuclear
capability surfaced or, ahem, was forged. At the time, the plan seemed
unfounded and improbable. However, six years later, with most of the
signatories of the project in office, or at least imposing influence on
those who were, it became a reality.
A quick visit to the PNAC Web page will show what we should have
seen coming. In 1997, the members wrote: "We aim to make the case and
rally support for American global leadership." They went on to outline
four basic principles of the project which were drafted June 3,1997:
"To increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out
our responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the
future."
"To strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge
regimes hostile to our interests and values."
"To promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad."
"To accept responsibility for America's unique role in preserving
and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity and our principles."
Although these broadly defined ideas are nothing new from the conservative camp, it is only when they are used to justify and buttress
actual political activities which jeopardize the lives of thousands of
people that we should be concerned. In a statement printed in January
of 1999 in The New York Times, PNAC members William Kristol and
Robert Kagan argued that "Saddam Hussein must go" and that the air
strikes carried out by the Clinton administration under the "Iraq
Liberation Act" were not enough to protect "our interests." They wrote
in their op-ed "Bombing Iraq isn't Enough" that "the only way to
remove the threat of the Weapons of Mass Destruction was to remove
him, and that means using air power and ground forces, and finishing
the task left undone in 199L" Pay special attention to the part about
"our interests." These interests were defined nine months later, when
Robert Kagan wrote another article in the Weekly Standard entitled "A
Way to Oust Saddam", Kagan cited those incentives: the protection of
"the safety of Israel, of modern Arab states and of the energy resources
on which the Unites States and its allies depend." Irony is dead, and so
we don't even need to look for coincidence in the fact that today we are
waging this war for the "liberation" and protection of the Iraqi people,
rather than these "interests."
In addition, Kagan even published the plan of attack drafted up by
his friend Paul Wolfowitz. When we attacked Iraq (and we would), we
would be coming in from the south, and the effect would be a full force
of air and ground invasions. The plan was already there. It was written out six years ago by current Deputy Secretary of Defense and
PNAC member Paul Wolfowitz, and it spelled out the script for the
show we all witnessed this past March. Maybe if we had read this six
years ago, we would have known that the retribution was decided
before the reason for that retribution even occurred.

Politics, Hollywood style
BY ARTHUR CHU
achul@swarthmore.edu

I've been an ambivalent Californian since 1998.
I'm still an East Coast kid at heart, and I've had to
do some adjusting since leaving my hometown in
New England.
I held on through the rolling blackouts, even
when it meant suffering through jokes along the
lines of, "What's the difference between California
and the Titanic? When the Titanic went down, its
lights were still on."
I listened patiently while Californians vied for
last place in education with Texas, some pundits
shouting that the SATs should be abolished for
being essentially Eurocentric and others proposing
replacing all final exams with standardized tests.
I sat and watched patiently while local news
gave seven minutes of coverage to the local rapist
on the loose and thirteen to the upcoming Oscars.

If we elect an actor as governor
again, I'm officially identifying
as Pennsylvanian from now on.
In short, it's been pure Hollywood-style politics.
But hey, it's in the nature of important people to do
stupid things and in the nature of the rest of us to be
unduly fascinated, and though California might
seem a particularly strong example, worse and
stranger things have happened elsewhere.
Remember all those Texas Democrats who fled
the State House for a motel room in Oklahoma, pursued by sheriffs deputies and the press, to prevent
the passage of that redistricting bill?
Or how about the coverage that pretzel incident
in the White House got?
Or how about the combination of media hype,
political bungling and shortsighted voting that got

Minnesota stuck with a wrestler for a governor?
Then the recall petition happened.
Sigh.
This recall election has all the classic elements
of a political fiasco: uncertain times; a fickle public, notoriously easily manipulated by the media
and hungry for fifteen minutes of fame; a media
eager for quick-breaking, dramatic stories and
quite willing to trade fifteen minutes of fame for

five Nielsen rating points; and politicians schooled
in hard-bitten Machiavellian tactics using all of the
above factors to their own ends.
What we have is basically a redo of the original
election engineered by a few ambitious Republican
bigwigs. The justification? A bad economy, which
these days is about equivalent to high crimes and
misdemeanors. The process? An election as
rushed, disorganized and camera-friendly as possible.
Hundreds of publicity hounds saw it as a chance
for easy exposure, and the media, as always, failed
to disappoint. Porn stars, movie stars, former child
stars. Tax attorneys, programmers, panhandlers.
Most of them have three things in common:
they like attention, they have no real qualifications for being governor and they have no chance
of winning. Some people, notably Arnold
Schwarzenegger, like Jesse Ventura and Ronald
Reagan before him, fail to meet the latter criteri-

on.

Sorry, but I've had a little too big a dose of
Hollywood this time, and I'm fed up with it. Fed up
with the willingness of those who guard our political
process to prostitute themselves to media bull, and of
the general public to be hypnotized by it, and journalists to make a quick buck by making of it. Fed up
with a system where our instinct in times of crisis is
to turn to the reassuring smile of a glamorous,
charismatic figurehead.
If we elect an actor as governor again, I'm officially identifying as Pennsylvanian from now on.
Don't ask me what I'll do if Larry Flynt wins.

Public Safety slacking on dorm thefts
Dear Editor:
Residents of Parrish, and the
student body at large, should
remain vigilant in the wake of
inadequate
Safety's
Public
response to crimes committed on
campus at the end of last semes-

ter.
Public Safety has worked capacase of
repeated thefts from unlocked
offices along the first floor of
bly to investigate the

Parrish.

Unfortunately, less attention
has been paid to what they've

deemed "unrelated" thefts from

Parrish dorm rooms (March 27,
2003, "Thefts in Parrish HaU con-

tinue.")
In Public Safety incidents
number 03-03-17-030503 and number 03-05-19-030525, a thief managed to enter a locked Parrish
dorm on two separate occasions
and steal almost a thousand dollars worth of electronics from a

student's room.
The fact that the thief was able
to gain access to locked dorms in
Parrish on multiple occasions
without sign of forcible entry is
alarming. I was further surprised

to learn that the locks to Parrish
dorms had not been changed for

the new school year.
I recommend that the rest of
the school work together to pick
up Public Safety's slack on this
issue. The admissions office can
help in the long term by not giv-

ing prospective students misinformation about the crime rate on

campus.
In the meantime, students
should avoid becoming complacent about the issue of crime on
campus.

Palestinians ask Israel for peace, give only hatred

months, the Palestinians
have failed to make even a

Bursting the Bubble

I

Upon his taking office
as prime minister, it was

hoped

that
Mahmoud
Abbas would wield real
influence over Hamas,
Islamic Jihad and their fell°w terrorist organizations. This was impossible, however, because Yasser
Arafat refused to cede any control over Palestinian security forces to Abbas. Arafat purportedly appointed Abbas to
foster the peace process and curtail violence, yet gave him
no physical power to implement change. Though Abbas

THE PHOENIX

reiterated his unwillingness to use force against terrorist
groups, his pleas for a cessation of violence were especially unheeded in light of his inability to enforce them.
But what vested interest did Arafat have in preventing
Abbas' attempts to curtail terrorist groups? One of those terrorist groups is the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, direct affili-

ates of Arafat's al-Fatah faction and a driving force behind
the Intifada. It is unlikely that Arafat would actively do anything to remove this element of his waning power. And
while Arafat's disinclination to compromise is a hindrance
to peace, the Palestinian problem does not end with him.
Last week, Abbas asked the Palestinian Legislative
Council, the voice of the Palestinian people, for more support in his political struggle with Arafat. Rather than support the man who supposedly supported an end to terrorism against Israel, 15 members of the council enacted a noconfidence vote against him. They initiated a no-confidence vote against the only official Palestinian leader who

has ever

acknowledged the likelihood of Israel's perma-

nent existence as a definite outcome of the peace process.
This no-confidence vote is sadly a reflection of the lay
Palestinian attitude, seen in protests and vandalism directed at Abbas. Many Palestinians actually accuse Abbas of
collaborating with Israel and the United States to suppress
a free Palestine. Yet these are the people we expect to one
day live peacefully beside Israel? It is no wonder that
Abbas has so hastily submitted his resignation.
When Palestinian terrorists broke the 90-day cease-fire,
they demonstrated their inability to work within the conSeptember 13, 2003

fines of the road map and

peaceful negotiation. The suicide

bombing of a Jerusalem bus full of civilians
including
many children
on Aug. 19 gave Israel no choice but to
declare war on those groups that would murder its inno-

cent bystanders. Palestinian intentions are treacherous,
demonstrated by their constant targeting of non-combatants. Israel, on the other hand, has been motivated to protect its civilians by specifically targeting the terrorists
whose leadership allows such despicable attacks to occur.
This point is best seen in the recent Israeli attack on
Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in
Gaza City. A sponsor and planner ofattacks on Israeli civilians, Yassin was a relatively easy target for the Israeli military. Yet rather than use enough force to ensure Yassin's
death, Israel used a smaller weapon in order to minimize collateral damage. Israel actually compromised its mission to
eliminate a man responsible for thousands of Israeli deaths
in order to save the lives of innocent Palestinians. Never
have the Palestinians showed the same human decency.
Without effectual leadership dedicated to real change,
the Palestinians will forever remain trapped under their
own insistence on futile murder. What good was a 90-day
cease-fire? Even if it had lasted its intended length, an
armed terrorist after a 90-day rest is still an armed terrorist. As long as the Palestinian Authority is unable to control its monsters, Israel has not only the right but the obligation to fulfill that role.

Employers used the EPA statement
to justify sending employees back to work downtown, and employees declined to use respirators because they had been led to believe
they were out of harm's way, said Dr. Stephen M. Levin, the medical director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental
Medicine at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.

Many workers did develop lung problems from the particulate
matter in the air, despite later test results by academic researchers
and private companies that ultimately support the EPA's statement. We had here what I will call a Type A Communications
Breakdown

one type of information is expected, another type is
delivered. Our society is such that, when the government makes a
formal statement, we expect it to be researched and in the best

interest of the public. This particular statement, while possibly
true, was made prematurely and without supporting evidence. If
New Yorkers were looking for observational or anecdotal evidence,

they could have asked their neighbors.

Blackout 2003, which swept through the northern leg of the Lake
Erie Loop from Ohio to Michigan, into Canada and down through
New York and New Jersey, caused a power failure for three days,
forced commuters to sleep on the streets and left millions of dollars
worth of perishable food to be discarded, not to mention the food
poisoning and heatstroke that resulted. Although all that I've read
affirms that this was an isolated problem that got out of hand, I can't
help but recall the California energy crisis and feel that the northeast power grid is headed for a similar debacle. The congressional
investigation of the blackout that started on Sept. 3 is sure to reek
of a Type B. We already know that Ohio utilities failed to warn anyone that the Great Lakes power grid, the origin of the blackout, was
in trouble. Testifying in hearings last week Michigan Governor
Granholm was quoted in The Washington Post as saying, "No one,
myself included, knows who is ultimately responsible for ensuring
reliability in the power grid." "Someone needs to be in charge,"
Ohio governor Taft said in testimony. Recall election, anyone?

If I were to draw a pyramid representing the hierarchy of world political power and influence, there
would be little doubt to where the United Nations
would stand: lurking hopelessly at the bottom.
Skeptical? Just compare how many covers the U.S.
press has dedicated to Jessica Lynch during the
month-long war on Iraq and how many Newsweek
covers Kofi Annan can boast in seven years as the
U.N. Secretary-General. Or, along that line, check to
see how many people on your hall remember who
Sergio Vieira de Mello

was.

In fact, the United Nations' powerlessness and ineffectiveness have become a commonplace: its diplomats

public eye as a heart

every
guys who, regrettablj
lack the clout and influ
ence necessary to heal th
world's diseases. Alternatively, the United Nations is
often described as a phantom entity maneuvered by
shady lobbies in Washington, ready to throw the cloak
of international legitimacy upon the United States'
shoulders whenever it needs to fight its dirty wars or
slap sanctions on the day's rogue state. The events of
the recent months have partly subverted this theory,
but I can assure you it is still very popular among my
Leninist buddies back in Italy.
I find some truth in both these positions. The
already mentioned Sergio Vieira de Mello was an
eminent example of brilliance and probity, and the
fact that powerful governments often hijack the
United Nations cannot be denied. Notably, the members of the Security Council
with the possible
exception of Britain
often seek official recognition
of their righteousness in questions of foreign policy
by pushing resolutions that will endorse their
actions and by vetoing the ones that condemn them.
Unfortunately, this is not the only problem that
underlies the United Nations.
Ask your 11-year-old cousin what principles the
United Nations stands for and he will know the correct answer: democracy, freedom and human rights.
Consequently, the United Nations should be a congress of free democracies whose names are absent
from Amnesty International's annual report. Simple
enough. Guess what? About half of the 191 members
are regimes that repress minorities and torture, kill
and maim their "citizens." Ironically, the 2003 U.N.

nations. The Kurdish nation is not represented, nor is
the Tibetan one or, for that matter, the Sioux and the
Navajo ones. Instead, these nations' rights are
entrusted to the same governments that oppress
them. I have a hunch that the Swarthmore population
is not very well represented up in the Glass Tower in
Manhattan. Since it is governments who appoint the
state member's envoys, oppositions are ignored as a
whole, even if they represent majorities.

inhabitants), Indonesia or Brazil (both around 200
million). It is important to safeguard the interests of
smaller nations, but this borders on farce. Does every
Tuvaluan really count as much as 90,000 Indians?
The third, baffling idiosyncrasy is the structure of
the Security Council. Its composition (permanent
seats and veto rights to the United States, Russia,
France, Great Britain and China) reflects a mindset
that is not only bluntly undemocratic but also obsolete. It is hard to find an explanation for France's
inclusion in this elite and, for instance, India's exclusion. India is an influential regional power, with
nuclear weapons and a billion inhabitants, about 17
times as many as France. Also, it is, at the very least,
odd that a cruel dictatorship such as China or a very
fragile democracy like Russia should be included in
this small club when solid democracies as Germany
and Japan are left out.
States should not be represented unless they are
democratic and they enforce human rights, oppositions should be taken into account, voting power
should be proportionl to population and the Security
Council should be reconsidered as a whole. But these
much-needed reforms, even if proposed, would be
hampered by many of the current members. As it is,
the United Nations can still be vital in providing aid
and relief, in coordinating nation-building and in
promoting democracy, but it will never be able to
achieve its wider goals: world peace, prosperity and
the respect of human rights.

After a year of arduous trial and error, I have finally
found the perfect "Swarthmore" solution to balancing
school work and social life. Though my weekly allotment
of time for work is surely well above that of the nation's
average college student, I still have time to enjoy the addi-

Hello everyone!
My name is Lorpu Jones (also known as LP), and I am a
sophomore extremely eager to become a part of the social planning core of Swat. Organizing is what I do best. And it's what
your student events advisor should eat, sleep, and breathe.
Whether we're talking about gettinga new group up on its feet,
hyping up an all-campus event, or revitalizing an older organization, I've been there and done that. But as we all know, work
here is never done, and neither is mine. I want to keep doing
what I do, and do it in a new and exciting way. With my experience with SBC (Student Budget Committee) and a handful of
other student organizations (chartered and unchartered), I
understand the importance of improved communications
between campus organizations as well as careful and patient
event preparation. Both will be central to the work I do as student events advisor.
Furthermore, I believe accountability is key to any organization's success. As student events advisor, I understand that I
will be held accountable to SAC, Student Council, and most
importantly, the student body. I will do everything I can and
more to fulfill your expectations in those regards. I will make
myself accessible and open to any and all suggestions. So,
you've got the ideas. I've got the plans. And they've (Student
Council and SAC, that is) got the money. What else do you need?
Vote Lorpu Jones 'O6 for student events advisor today!
PEACE.

My name is Anna Masilela 'O4, and I would like to be
your student events advisor. I will work on the following
initiatives if elected to Student Council:
L Campus-Wide Online Activities Calendar: Doesn't it

participation.

Swarthmore College motivates students to take advantage
of all the incredible things it has to offer. A majority of this
opportunity presents itself in the classroom, but evidently,
the rest lies in additional extracurricular activities such
as political activism, club involvement, off campus entertainment, and of course, parties. So 'O7, it's time to say
goodbye to pin the tail on the donkey and spin the bottle,
because as your elected student events advisor I will be
dedicated to my position and my responsibilities. Not only
will I be a familiar face at the Social Affairs Committee
(SAC) meetings, I will take my job so seriously that I will
be in attendance at the social affairs. I think it is incredibly important that the college continues to sponsor and
fund both small and large scale events, and that these
events be exciting, enticing, and available for the entire
student body to attend. If you enjoy all the activities that
Swarthmore offers and you want to make sure that you
have a strong leader to bring those things to you, vote for
Patricia Funk for student events advisor.

accordingly. The online calendar would also provide a onestop site for students to check up on all the activities for
that night.
2. More SAC-funded parties: You work hard during the
week so you want some fun on the weekends. Each Friday
and Saturday, SAC should provide you with the option to
party. I will work with various groups on campus to make

sure that every weekend is a party weekend. So go ahead —
dance, hang out, canoodle and take part in the social scene.
3. Variety in SAC funding: When you're looking for a
change of pace, SAC should be there to help you out. A student band concert, a poetry slam or a roof-raising folk
dance extravaganza could be just the thing to make your
weekend. Good ideas deserve support and I promise to
help provide the campus with

Missed calls, chances cost Garnet games
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND

aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's soccer team struggled to put points on the
Hopkins Alumni
Invitational Tournament in Baltimore, Md., falling in
both contests 1-0 to the Savannah College of Art and
Design and Bridgewater College of Virginia. The Garnet
Tide slipped to 1-3 overall on the season with the losses,

"They're going

to have veteran players, and it will be a tough test for our second regional
game, but we're physically capable of handling them.
We'll also be playing in front of our home crowd, and I
think that can make a big difference for a young team like
us."
The team will focus on attacking the net more aggressively and maintaining possession for longer periods of
time against the Greyhounds to try to boost their stumbling offense while trying to match their solid defensive
efforts from the weekend. "Obviously, based on the scores
from this weekend, we played very well defensively,"
Wagner said. "We just need to focus more on keeping possession of the ball by putting it on the floor and not trying
to force things too much, giving our creative players time
to score. But at the same time, we still need to be more
aggressive in attacking the net on corner kicks, because
guys who are crashing hungry will score."
Against Savannah College of Art and Design, the
Garnet Tide lost the hotly contested matchup in double
overtime as the Bees scored in the waning minutes of the
game. While neither team dominated the match, a late
defensive lapse by Swarthmore was all it took for
Savannah to put home the winning goal. "We had played

hard all game, and it was unfortunate that it ended with
one unmarked man getting a good head on the ball,"
Goalkeeper Nate Shupe 'O5 said. "It was tight the whole
game, and that one slip-up was enough to cost us."
While the Garnet had an 8-4 edge over Savannah in corner kicks throughout the game, Swarthmore's inability to
capitalize on these opportunities hurt them in Saturday's
contest. "We had the run of play most of the game," said
Wagner. "We just failed to convert."
The team was also the victim of two controversial
penalty calls that could have changed the face of the game,

one in which forward Andrew Terker 'O6 was hauled down
on a breakaway, resulting in a yellow card but no penalty
shot for the Garnet Tide. Later, the Bees goaltender tipped
away the shot of forward Brandon Penix 'O7 while out of

the box, which drew no call from the officials. Either call

would have granted Swarthmore a man advantage for the
remainder of the game. "With a couple of breaks here and
there, a couple of mistakes, we could easily be 3- 1,"
Wagner said. "But, even still, you make your own luck,
and hopefully we can turn it around."

Against Bridgewater, the Garnet Tide stayed close
throughout the first half but seemed to play without the
fire they displayed against Savannah. "The game was

going to be decided in the middle of the field by a couple
of big plays, and we were picking it up during the middle
part of the game," Shupe said. "We thought we had a
chance, but after they scored it just seemed like we were
going through the motions."
Both Shupe and midfielder Vernon Chaplin 'O7 garnered all-tournament honors for Swarthmore. The team
will play St. Mary's this Saturday on the road and
Neumann next Wednesday at Clothier Stadium before
kicking off its conference schedule against Dickinson on
Sept. 20. Eric Wagner was the head coach at St. Mary's
until 2002. The trip will be his first as the coach of the
Swarthmore men's soccer team.

Rose would become the subject of hyperbolic praise from
baseball writers, who were
searching for a throwback in
an era of free agents and
Astroturf. Rose was the every-

man, a player that blue-collar

fans in cities like Cincinnati
and Philadelphia connected with like few before or after.
After his playing career, Rose transitioned quickly into the
role of manager, where he found relative success.
In 1989, five years into Rose's managerial career, Major
League Baseball released the Dowd Report, finding that Rose
had been betting on baseball games while carrying out his
duties as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Rule 21(d) is posted
in every clubhouse and it states that any player, umpire, team
official, or employee betting on a game in which they have
duty to perform will be suspended for life. The report found
that Rose had bet on the Reds, as well as other teams. Rose
and Commissioner Giamatti eventually reached a signed
agreement in which Rose agreed to be banned from baseball
for life, as long as he need not admit to ever betting on baseball and he had the avenues for reinstatement left open for
him.
Fast forward to the present. Rose is constantly newsworthy. He was included on baseball's All-Century Team and
appeared at the corresponding ceremonies before Game 2 of
the 1999 World Series at Atlanta's Turner Field. He recently
bought pricy season tickets to the Reds' new stadium, Great
American Ballpark. Every year calls for his reinstatement
seem to increase in frequency and intensity. Things are looking up, Pete.
And this is a shame. Pete Rose should never, never be reinstated to the game of baseball. He didn't just violate a rule that
every player simply must follow. His actions undermined perhaps the most basic assumptions of sports: that the players
are playing to win. That when mistakes happen, they are
actually mistakes. That the games contain a shred of integrity in an era of greed.
Some people claim Rose got a raw deal. They say the Hall
of Fame is full of unsavory characters. They say that Rose
was treated unfairly by the media. They say that Rose never

ever bet on the Reds to lose. These claims are mostly true. Ty
Cobb compares nicely with Pete Rose, since Cobb is generally considered the worst human being in the Hall of Fame.
Cobb was racist, violent, greedy and generally unpleasant.
Cobb's crimes, however, have nothing to do with the game of
baseball. When Cobb was on the field, no one wondered if the
game was fair. When Cobb was on the field, the field was
level. The media, mostly the same media that had made a
hero of him 20 years earlier, treated Rose harshly. A lot of the
enmity stems from feelings of betrayal on both sides. And it's
true that Rose never bet on the Reds to lose. This is not really that important, however. Experienced gamblers can learn
a lot from how much a manager bets with certain pitchers
scheduled and on which occasions that manager declines to
bet entirely.
If Pete Rose's situation teaches us anything, it's that athletes should distance themselves from gambling as much as
possible. As for the rest of us, we probably shouldn't bet on
sports either; at least, never on the Miami Dolphins to beat
the Houston Texans.

Ultimate teams storm Mertz field
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu
To people on the fringes of Ultimate Frisbee, it's
called a layout or a bid; but to those who fling themselves horizontally in a masochistic, self-sacrificing
dive just to catch the disk, it's just another afternoon
practice on Mertz field. "The layout," senior tri-captain
Alison Landrey 'O4 explained, "is part of the whole bebrutal-to-your-body Frisbee cult."
With the fall 2003 Frisbee season upon them, the
men and women's teams are looking to build a strong
core group of players. On the women's side, the tri-captain of the Warmothers, Cassie Barnum 'O6, has hopes
of training new players this fall. "Our goal is just to
recruit new people and teach the game; hopefully win a
few games, maybe win a tournament, and have a lot of
fun," she said.
During the fall season, the Warmothers compete

against club teams in the Mid-Atlantic region. The
team looks forward to its biggest challenges in late
September and early October as they compete in
Sectionals, Regionals, and Nationals. While Nationals
may not be a priority for the team this year, Barnum

said, "I do have high hopes for next year and the year
after that."
Landrey is looking forward to teaching the game to
the new faces on the field. "It's a really new team this
year," she said. "We are looking for people to really
step up and play new positions."
Barnum added that many first-years that come out
for Frisbee usually "have a very steep learning curve.

see great things from sophomore Victoria Swisher."
The Earthworms, the male counterpart to the
Warmothers, have also taken to Mertz field as of late
and are gearing up for another winning season.
Leading the team this year are tri-captains Andrew
Rosskamm 'O4, Billy Schwarz 'O5, and Rob DeVoogd
'O6.
Recruiting people through

word of mouth, as well
as putting on a show out on the field, the men are

"The layout is part of the whole bebrutal-to-your-body Frisbee cult."

There are several freshmen that have been playing
with us, and we are really excited," she said.
With key player Marie Laurenza 'O6 sidelined with
an ACL tear, the Warmothers need top performances
from returning players. "Alison Landrey, senior Anna
Stratton, and tri-captain Dana Variano are going to be
important to our success," Barnum said, "and I hope to

up

the

potential

of the first-years.
'O6 commented, "The

freshmen are all solid
class seems to be getting better."
Like the women's team, the men use the fall season
to prepare for the competitive college league spring
season. Although the team graduated seven players,
they still have enough depth to put on a good showing
in October. "We'd like to make a good run at club
regionals this fall," Weintraub said, "and we are really concentrating on building an experienced team for
college regionals this spring."
The women will make their first appearance on the
field Sept. 21 at the sectional tournament at Lehigh
University.

Newfound depth puts cross country at head of pack
The men's and women's cross country teams are
off to a quick-paced start this year. Both teams have
been diligently training in and out of season for this
year's competitions and are focused on improving the
squads' impressive results of last season.

In addition to the returning runners, both the

men's and women's teams welcome a total of 13 firstyears; all of whom are experienced runners that will
greatly add to the dynamic of both teams. "The firstyears had trained a lot over the summer and are working hard in practice. This is really helping the team
progress this year," co-captain James Golden 'O5 said.
The men's team is working hard to place higher
than its fifth place finish last year in the Centennial
Conference Championship. This goal, according to
both Golden and head coach Pete Carroll, is very

22

much within the Tide's grasp considering the returning talent and the precautionary steps the team has
taken to prevent the injuries that have plagued them
in the past. "We have a nice pack of six this year
our deepest training group yet," coach Carroll said. So
with this experienced "training group" and the hard
working first-years, the 2003 men's team is ready for

the challenging season that begins with the Haverford

Meet on Sept. 19.
The women's cross country team this season is just

as enthusiastic and driven as the men. Again the addition of the first-years is making a significant difference in the depth of the team. "We have some wonderful returning athletes that are ready to race,"
Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 said
The women's team, also focused on avoiding

September

injury, is looking to this season with much anticipation. The returning athletes, led this season by senior
Maria Elena deTrinidad Young 'O4, are a promising
group, capable of piloting the team to Nationals this
fall. "As a team we.hope to be smarter runners this
year in our preparations and in our goals," Gardner
said. "More of us are taking greater precautions
against injuries in hopes that we can be at our peak
for conferences, regionals, and hopefully beyond

that."
This year's women's cross country season should
be fruitful and one to definitely keep an eye on. The
team's first meet is also on Sept. 19 at Haverford. The
Garnet women are also looking forward to hosting the
Seven Sisters tournament on Oct. 18.

Rodd impressive in tournament tuneup
Garnet put forth strong effort in match play against Division I teams
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Men's tennis is off to a promisin preseason play. The
team is poised to take advantage
of its strong force of upperclassmen and a talented group of firstyears. Swat men's tennis, notorious for its deep roster and general talent, seems to be ready for
another exciting year of play. Last
weekend, Swat hosted the Tim
Berman Memorial Tournament,
bringing in players from Goucher
ing start

and St. Joseph's to compete individually in four flights of play.
The result was a strong showing
against two Division I schools on
all levels of play.
Zac Rodd 'O6 made it through
some intense tennis to get to the
A Flight singles championships
only to lose to SJU's Van Homer
Pangilina 6-3. Rodd blamed the
loss mostly on the fatigue caused
by playing four matches on
Saturday. He admitted that "he
had no real expectations for the
tournament" and that he was
"outplayed in the final."
This was no simple task, as he
has been recovering from a rotator cuff injury. Rodd sees the pre-

season

as an opportunity to

adjust the lineup and integrate

the freshmen into the team's

dynamic.

One of the strongest showings
of the tournament was first-year
Jonathan Reiss's domination of
the third flight of competition.
Reiss
defeated
Francisco
Velazquez of SJU 7-5, 7-5 in the
final. An impressive feat consid-

ering Velazquez teamed up with
Pangilina to win A flight doubles.
Reiss, who spent his summer
practicing four or five times a
week with his younger brother, is
looking forward to the team
atmosphere found at Swat tennis.
He won't deny that tournament
play was "more competitive", but
he would trade that any day for
the ability to "play with five to six
guys in a friendly team environment."

Frank

Visciano

'O4

was

impressed by the level of play that
the entire team brought to the
court. "There was an overall
strong performance by the freshmen," Visciano said. He was also
impressed with Brian Park 'O6,
his doubles partner. Visciano and
Park lost in tie break the A flight
doubles final 9-8 (4). On Saturday
evening, in the first doubles game
Visciano and Park played together, Park was beginning to feel the
games he'd played earlier that
day. "Brian was cramping, his
legs

were tightening, but he

fought it out," said Visciano,
"which is more than he could say
for one of his opponents. In the
end, Visciano sees a season of
quality tennis that is adaptable
for any enemy.
Ben Rae 'O4 also trained hard
this summer and was ready for
some good tennis this weekend.
For the most part, he was
impressed with the energy the
team brought to the courts. Rae

and Mike Norieka 'O4 defeated
SJU's Chris Spencer and Ravi
Pujara 8-3 to capture the B flight
doubles

championship.

"played pretty well" with Norieka
but admitted that he personally

"could've done better."
"Hopefully, we'll have a good
year," Rae said.
The Garnet dominated the D

flight finals, having an allSwarthmore fight for both D
flight 1 and 2 single finals. Firstyears Adam Wallwork, Sam
Sidhu and Shingo Murata joined
Pino Spadola 'O4 for the Swat

challenge. Wallwork defeated
Sidhu 6-2,6-2 in D Flight L Murata
closely beat Spadola in a third-set
tiebreaker 6-3, 4-6, (10-5).
To quote Rodd, "We're getting
there."

Swarthmore College gets a Giant Shockey
After reading my column online last week, Jeremy
Shockey wrote me an e-mail, appalled at how I had left his
Giants out of the playoffs. After exchanging emails for two
days, Shockey asked to meet so he could straighten out my

"Well," I had to say, "people here care about other
things. Like vegan food."
"Wow," he responded, noting how small the weight
room was. "This place is more pathetic than the Eagles

offense."

Last Monday, his only day off this week, Jeremy drove
down from northern Jersey to pay me a visit for the day.
He pulled up in front of
PPR at 7 a.m.; I didn't mind
waking up early to greet
him, and I brought him
upstairs to my room. "Man,
this place shafts you in
terms of space. And you're
a senior?" My thoughts
exactly. "And what the hell
is this? Is this kid stupid or
something? I thought this
was a smart school," he
said, pointing to a sign
reading "ENDWAR" on the
door of my neighbor.
"Davis, I've been here three

minutes and I don't like the
place already. Let's go get a

workout in."

We changed into some
workout clothes and I took
him down to the Mullen fitness center. We were the first
ones there so we had the place to ourselves. We walked in
and, seeing how it was empty at 7:30 in the morning, he
asked, "Where is everyone? Is everyone at this school fat
and out of shape or something? It's prime lifting time."

THE PHOENIX

"Yeah," I said. "What's worse is that it's new! This
school doesn't care much about its athletes."
After lifting Jeremy and I went out to the stadium field

to throw the pigskin around a little. "Where's the football

field?" he asked.

"You're standing on it," I replied. "We don't have a team

anymore."

"What the hell kind of a college doesn't have a football
team? Who's in charge of this place? Someone's gotta pay
for this," he said.
We walked up to Parrish second to see if Al Bloom was
around. As luck had it he was, and Jeremy barged into his
office. "Hey, Davis, you sure this is the guy in charge? He
looks a little short and angry to wield any power. He only
comes up to my waist!" I assured him that Bloom was
behind the football decision, and Shockeyproceeded to pick
him up by his neck, slam him against the wall, and tell him
how he has done the students of this college an injustice by
cutting the game.
Satisfied he had gotten his message across, we left and
went back to my room to play some Madden. After wasting
three hours doing that, I gave him a campus tour, and he
surprisingly took a fascination in all the signs and posters
all over campus. "SQU?" he asked, "What's that? Hey,
they're having a meeting right now. Let's stop by." I didn't
think it was a good idea, but he insisted.
We went to Bond and stopped in on the SQU meeting.
"What the hell is this?" he shouted.
September 11

2003

"Swarthmore Queer Union," somebody responded.
"What? Y'all a bunch of homos in here.
Where's
Parcells?"

"Uh, Jeremy, that's pretty offensive," I said. "I think
you should apologize.
Besides, over 20 percent of
Swarthmore consider themselves homosexual. They pride
themselves on this fact."
"Damn, Davis, you didn't tell me that. Let's get the hell
outta here. And I'll deal with Parcells next Monday."
Infuriated at what he had just learned, Jeremy spent the
next several hours fuming and blowing off steam. We went
to dinner at Sharpies, where Shockey spent the entire meal
complaining how the food was no comparison to even the
worst team meals he eats with the Giants. I told him I

couldn't relate but that the dining hall did the best they
could.

After suffering through a long day at Swarthmore,
Jeremy was ready to party. He wanted something fun and
something big, but I told him it was a Monday night so not
to expect much. I took him down to Phi Psi, thinking some-

thing might be going on, but, the minute we walked in, he
exclaimed, "This place sucks. There's nothing happening
here." Stupid me for not knowing that. We went next door
to DU, which seemed to please Shockey much better. "This
is what I'm talking about. Good people, good times. Hey,
who's that guy over there? He looks like he can party."
"Oh, him? That's Rico Suave."
"Not bad. Nice name. Well, I'm going to go enjoy myself.

Thanks for showing me around."
And, with that, he went downstairs to do who knows
what. Hopefully, he showed up at practice on Tuesday.
