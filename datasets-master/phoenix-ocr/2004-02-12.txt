Historian encourages dissent in wartime
BY BENJAMIN KABAK AND
BREE BANG-JENSEN
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu and
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu
Contrary to the words and actions of the
Bush administration, Arthur Schlesinger

Jr. believes dissent is an important part of

a healthy democracy during a time of war.
He also thinks Americans may regret their

overzealous patriotism in the not-so-distant future.
"In a state of panic or wartime, we often
overdo our patriotism," he said. "Then, we
hate ourselves in the morning."
Schlesinger, the 86-year-old, two-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and former personal assistant to President John F.
Kennedy, spoke out on Tuesday night
against a policy of pre-emptive war and
against the war on Iraq.
"One is led to believe that the adminis-

tration was bent towards a war on Iraq
long before Sept. 11," Schlesinger said.

As the inaugural speaker for the James
A. Field Memorial Lecture in American
History, honoring a former Swarthmore
professor, Schlesinger spoke to a packed
house in LPAC.
He devoted his lecture to tracing the
role of dissent in wartime throughout
American history.
In his speech, entitled "Patriotism and
Dissent in Wartime America," Schlesinger
taught the crowd a history lesson on the
present
dissent
in
overwhelming
American during wars.
Opening his speech, the historian relied
on the words of John Adams to demonstrate that a third of Americans were not
of even
the
American
supportive
Revolution. He cautioned the crowd not to
forget American history.
"A nation that denies its past will be
hindered in dealing with the future," he

said.

As Schlesinger went on to highlight all
major wars in American history, including
the War of 1812, the Civil War and World
War I, he noted that George W Bush's
attempts to portray dissent as unpatriotic
had been largely absent in U.S. history.

.
"Rallying around the presidents during
wartime is not a historical precedent or
requirement," Schlesinger said.

Wartime presidents, he argued, have
often been unpopular with some portion of
the country.
Furthermore, Schlesinger explained
how the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf Wars
had all played roles in the oustings of
Presidents Truman, Johnson and Bush the
elder.
To bring the USA Patriot Act into a historical perspective, Schlesinger showed
how presidents had tried
and failed in
the past to limit speech in America.
In the early republic, when President
Adams passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
Vermont congressman Matthew Lyon
served four months in jail. At the same
time, he won reelection as Vermonters
seemingly spit in the face of the limiting

acts.

"The joke is that he served two terms at
once," Schlesinger said.
Schlesinger emphasized that being patriotic was not always about agreeing with
administrative policy, and that we should
not surrender the flag to John Ashcroft.
"Going to war does not nullify the Bill of
Rights," he said. "Even when the republic
faces mortal danger, the First Amendment
is still in the Constitution."

In the end, Schlesinger opined that
Bush's new international stance
what he
termed the Bush Doctrine
represented "a
fatal change in the foreign policy of the
United States."
"During the Cold War, preventative war
was unheard of," he said. "He's changed
the policy from peace through preventing
war to peace through preventative war.
Looking back at the 40 years of Cold War,
we can be grateful that the loonies were
powerless. Now, in 2004, they own the
Pentagon."

While the auditorium's first nine rows
were filled with adults, students turned out
in droves to hear Schlesinger rail against
the Bush administration.
Many students showered praise upon
Schlesinger's lectures
"The lecture reminded me of why I want

Center about dissent in wartime as history professor Marjorie Murphy looks on.

to go into politics again," Katie Cassling 'O7
said.
"I thought that a man who has such an
amazing grasp of history can convey better

to Swarthmore students how disastrous the

Bush administration is and how we all
need to come together better than anyone
else," Colin Holtz-Eakin 'O7 said.
Others, however, did not follow all of
Schlesinger's conclusions.
"I agree that dissent is an important
part of American democracy and is crucial
to the democratic process," Randy
Goldstein 'O5 said. "But it is important to
remember that we are in a very unique
time in the world and different situations
necessitate unique responses. I don't think
what we see in the U.S. today is any more

severe or out of line with the historic
precedent established in wartime."
Some students took exception to the
way in which history professor Marjorie
Murphy introduced Schlesinger.
While providing the crowd with
Schlesinger's extensive biography, Murphy
raised a few eyebrows. She cited the importance of speakers such as Schlesinger during "a time when our foreign policy has
returned to the Dark Ages."
"I would have preferred that Murphy
had kept her own opinions to herself,"
Goldstein said. "I see the role of one who is
introducing a speaker to simply introduce
a speaker rather than interrupt her introduction with her own opinions about how
this is 'an age of darkness for America.'

Committee still unsure of large-scale event plans
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
The plans for Swarthmore's annual large-scale event are
still up in the air, prompting many students to question if
another school year will erld without a performance.
The Large-Scale Event Committee has already made an
offer to the well-known indie rock group The Flaming Lips.
The group wa unable to perform because it was recording in
the studio all spring, according to committee member David
Berger 'O4.
The committee met Wednesday and decided to go with a
second choice, Coordinator of Student Activities Jenny Yim
said in an e-mail. Yim declined to comment further until
something can be confirmed.
The fact that it is already mid-February places the school
in a difficult position in terms of scheduling an event.
"It seems pretty late for me. Things that have happened
[in past years] earlier in the semester were already planned
by now. The committee has had trouble reaching total agreement, and that has pushed them back. The business of being
an impresario is a difficult one," Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said.
Last year at this time, the committee had already decided
on performer D J Shadow.
The event was canceled a month later because DJ

Shadow could not come to the college.
The funding that had been allotted for the large-scale

Martyna Pospieszalska 'O6 said she was also "concerned

with the timeline. The next option available was very interested two months ago, but now [that the time has passed],
the plans are not as definite." She said she believed there
was still a "good chance of getting a group."
Berger said he was not as concerned with the timing of

planning the event.
Berger also schedules Olde Club shows and said fees paid
to the performing artists for these shows "range from $lOO to
$3,500, with the median being close to $7OO [per group] and a

Berger.

Jeff Traczynski 'O4, Student Budget Committee treasurer
and chair of the Large-Scale Events Committee, is "not yet"
worried about the timing for the planning of the event.
The committee decided to use opinion surveys that were

passed out to the student body during the beginning offall
semester to assess popular desires for the event. "Students
want a variety of things, but mostly musical acts," and no
particular genre came up often, committee member Bobby

Berman 'O4 said.
So far this year, the committee has been focusing on "collecting ideas from students, seeing what's feasible, and going

through which artists are available for late April or early
May," Berman said.
The Presiden'ts office is contributing $22,500 to a joint
fund for the large-scale event, and Worthstock and SBC is
giving $7,500, according to Traczynski.
The President's Office's contribution comes with "one
caveat: that the event is in keeping with what we originally
intended, something that brings the semester to an end,"
Eldridge said. The event has recently become more a midsemester activity that is not in keeping with the college's
intentions for the tradition, Eldridge said.

Board to consider new
living wage proposal
happen." He said he hoped students "can see
that [the living wage is] a complicated and
complex issue for the college."

BY MEGO LIEN
mlienl@swarthmore.edu

Following the living wage committee's
report issued on Tuesday, the Board of
Managers faces months of research and deliberation on. the long-debated issue of instituting a living wage at Swarthmore.
In a 22-page file sent to all students, faculty and staff, the Ad Hoc Committee on a
Living Wage suggested a living wage of $10.72
an hour for Swarthmore staff, with a "minority recommendation" of $13.89.
Other recommendations included a child
care subsidy benefit of $550 a month, adjusted
annually for inflation, and a health insurance
supplement that "keeps pace with annual

increases in health insurance premiums to

the college."
The board will consider this proposal in
the coming months, starting at their next
meeting on Feb! 27. It expects to arrive at a
decision by fall, although the Swarthmore
Living Wage and Democracy Campaign hopes
to push the board's timeline up to May, campaign member Harris Kornstein 'O6 said.
At its December 2003 meeting, the board
created a subcommittee that would dedicate
itself to the living wage. Board Chair Barbara
Mather '65 said she was reluctant to discuss
the issue before she had a chance to meet
with the board on Feb. 27 and fully consider
the ad hoc report.
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l, who
staffs major committees of the board, understood Mather's position.
"If it's an issue that's alive [at
Swarthmore] and that ultimately requires
their decision, [the board] will want to be
well-informed," Eldridge said. "They feel they
need to do it well and do it right."
Eldridge added that the living wage campaign's request for a May decision "may not

This week marks what should be the
beginning of the end of the four-year living

wage debate, which will culminate in the
board's final decision in the fall. Today,
tomorrow and Sunday, the ad hoc committee
will hold three separate meetings for staff,

and students to discuss their recently
published recommendations.
In conjunction with the ad hoc report, the
living wage campaign has organized a week
of action leading up to the board's meeting at
faculty

the end of the month.
Both the campaign and the ad hoc commit-

tee have presentation times allotted for them
at the meeting. "We're trying to make this an
energetic semester," Kornstein said.
Staff involvement in the campaign has
recently dwindled because the deliberations
have taken so long, Kornstein said.
The issue first received attention in fall
2000, when a group of students involved in an
economics project became concerned about
the wages of employees at Swarthmore.
. By February 2001, the living wage campaign had formed and issued a report to
President Al Bloom detailing its concerns and
proposing the implementation of higher
wages through a "democratic decision-making process," according to a January 2004
report by the living wage campaign.
The campaign met its first success in
spring 2002, when the minimum wage at
Swarthmore increased from $6.66 to $9 an
hour. "That's better than market value,"
Kornstein said, "but it's still not a living

wage."

Bloom then created the ad hoc committee
and assigned members the task of determining a suitable living wage for Swarthmore
employees.

Burke said companies

Although the NACE survey indicates that there will
be more jobs available for

Student Council will distribute a referendum on a living wage.

Council to gauge student
opinion on a living wage
BY PAUL

GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

Student Council has avoided taking a position on the possibility of
instituting a
living wage at
Swarthmore, but it has committed to
providing an avenue of communication between the Swarthmore Living
Wage and Democracy Campaign and
the Board of Managers.
In a recent meeting, Student
Council agreed to hold a referendum
gauging the student body's reaction
to the wage recommendation of the
Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage
(see story, pg. 5). Depending on the
referendum's results-, the council
could pass a resolution. Members
made it clear that, because they rep-

resent students, its decision to commit itself to a living wage would
depend on student opinion of the ad
hoc committee's recommendation for
a living wage of $10.72 or $13.89 per
hour.
"The living wage issue is coming
to a head," Student Council CoPresident Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5
said. "Because of where the living
wage discussion is at right now,
Student Council saw a need to get
involved because of our interaction
with the Board of Managers as well

as our role as representatives of the
student body."
It will be difficult for the council
to decide whether to endorse the
implementation of a living wage if
students are distinctly divided into

two camps, according to Rodriguez.
If, for instance, a "40-60" split were to
occur, Rodriguez said, the council's
resolution might not reflect the
majority opinion of the students.
Instead, the resolution might come
from internal discussion among
Student Council members.

committees and helped facilitate discussion between the campaign and
the Board of Managers and administration.
Rodriguez and Student Council
Co-President Jyoti Gupta 'O5 openly
stated their own support for a living
wage. But Rodriguez stressed the
diversity of opinion on the council.
He also- said he saw Student Council
as a neutral party.
While the co-presidents both said
they did not feel the college could
implement the living wage immediately, they were in agreement with
the ad hoc committee's recent recommendation that funding for the proposal be discussed at a future time.
They also both felt the administration should pledge its support to creating a living wage now that it has
received a lengthy and extensive
analysis of the living wage situation.

Committee suggests higher staff wage
BY CAROLINE GRUBBS

cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

The Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage
released a report on Tuesday that proposed a raise
in the Swarthmore minimum wage as well as
increased child care and health insurance benefits

for employees.

The majority of the committee proposed a $10.72
per hour minimum wage,
but a substantial minority
recommended $13.89 per
hour. The report contained

two recommendations for a

minimum wage because the
committee could not come

to a consensus, according to

A substantial
minority, however, recommended a cap of $5,000
per employee for childcare subsidy.
The committee agreed on the rest of the recom-

mendations in the report, which included a modification of health insurance benefits to ensure that
the lowest-paid employees receive full HMO coverage for their families at no cost to them. The committee also agreed that the amount ofchild care and
health insurance benefits an employee receives
should be based on his salary.
The report did not make a recommendation on
how the college should fund the proposed minimum
wage and increased benefits, Schwartz said.
Schwartz said he believed the committee's recommendations would set an example for other institutions. "There's nothing remotely like what we're
proposing, that I know of," he said. "I think it's a
wonderful model that other places might follow."

The economics of a living wage
Economics professors expressed concerns
about the concept of a living wage.
A living wage means that "an employer is voluntarily paying a wage above the market wage,"
economics professor Larry Westphal said. Thus, as
the college raises its minimum wage, it begins to
February 12, 2004

...

there should be no
presumption that the
more formal education a person has, the
more qualified he or
she is for a particular

job."
According to economics
professor
Mark Kuperberg, the
real goal should be to
establish a "living standard of living." But achieving this by raising wages is inefficient, he said.
"The way to attack the problem is through other
forms of compensation," Kuperberg said.
The other problem Kuperberg saw with a living
wage is that it incurs a decrease in benefits provided by the Earned Income Tax Credit, a negative tax
designed to
help low-income individuals,

Kuperberg said. The ad hoc committee investigated
the affect of an increase in wages on EITC benefits
and concluded in its report that "employees will be
made substantially better off by a wage increase
even when decreases in EITC benefits are factored

in."
Living wage campaign reactions
Students involved in the Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign are pleased that the proposal on the issue has been released and that the
board has acknowledged a need for a change in

wages. Many feel the minority numbers are a better representation of their wishes, though any
wage increases will cause some improvement.
"My personal reaction is more in line with
that of the minority recommendation on the
wage, namely the $13.89 figure, but I'm certainly
not going to discount $10.72 in the least, because it
would be quite an improvement and a major step
forward that I think a very broad swath of people
on campus would like
to see," campaign coordinator Cathy Meals
'O4 said in an e-mail.

There's nothing remotely like
what we're proposing, that I

Lecture series to explore race, class and sexuality
Organizer wants provocative speakers to encourage honest and candid discussions

other nations.

Rafael Zapata wants to challenge people.
This is the fourth semester Zapata has served as
Intercultural Center Director, and he is determined to
bring speakers to campus that will provoke dialogue and
critical thinking.
"I'm just looking for people who help us think critically, who make me think critically, whether I agree with
them or not," Zapata said.
Zapata found what he was looking for in Dr. Carol
Swain, professor of law and political science at
Vanderbilt University. Swain gave a speech entitled "The
New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to
Integration" Tuesday, Feb. 3.
According to a press release, Swain argued that white

nationalists are exploiting contentious issues

including

affirmative action and immigration policies to increase
mainstream support for extremist movements.
Much of what Swain said angered the audience that
crowded into the Scheuer Room
on Tuesday.
Approximately 130 people attended the lecture, and many
were strongly affected by it.
Veronika Dubajova 'O7 was upset by Swain's suggestion that people of all races should begin to identify
themselves just as Americans. Swain thought this would
be a way of avoiding the violence that can come with
increased racial tensions.
Dubajova, who is from Slovakia, was offended by this

She was angered by "the American claim of being
exceptional and better than the rest of the world."
Mariah Montgomery 'O4 did not agree with Swain's
position that there is a new white nationalism characterized by a middle class, professional constituency. This
depiction is not unlike the white nationalism of the past,

crucial and hoped these conversations would continue in
the future.
The annual Jerry Wood memorial lecture will take
place Monday, March L Mari Luz Franco-Ortiz will present "Breaking the Silence: The Experiences of Everyday
Racism Among Girls in Loiza, Puerto Rico."

"I'm just looking for people who
help us think critically, who make
me think critically, whether I
agree with them or not."

Montgomery said.
"My major problem with her argument is that it's rel-

atively ahistorical," she said.
Montgomery was also disappointed that Swain did not
allow students to finish asking their questions and dodging questions by talking about her religious faith.
"It disappointed me because that's not my understanding of engaging in intellectual conversation," she
said.
"I can see where some of the things she said bothered
people," Zapata said. "I think it got people angry, but it
also provoked a lot of thought."
Since this was his primary goal, Zapata was pleased

with the lecture.

"I don't think she was disrespectful or condescending.
She was really honest in her opinions, and it made people think about where they stood," Zapata said.
"That was really the goal
to have an honest, candid
discussion about the issues she discussed and the movement she was describing," Zapata said.
He said he thought discussing contentious issues was

Zapata said that these speeches were a precursor to
the lecture series he is planning for this fall entitled:
"The Intercultural Center Lecture Series on Race, Class,
Gender and Sexual Identity," which will explore contradictions in these demographic categories.
Zapata will organize the series in March. As far as
choosing speakers, he will continue to search for people
who will provoke their audiences.
"I like people who pose challenging questions,"
Zapata said.

Parrish heating under repair
BY MARY MINTEL

The fourth floor of Parrish is slowly becoming
warmer after experiencingproblems with the heating system.
Facilities workers have balanced the heat flow
to the east wing of the building, so that it is now
consistent with regulations, according to Director
of Maintenance Ralph Thayer.
"We don't know if we're out of the woods, but it
certainly looks better than it has in the past,"
Thayer said. "We still want to watch it for a few
more days to make sure it stays stable."
Residents ofParrish Fourth East appreciate the
warmth.

"It's nice coming in from the cold into a warm
room so I can actually shed off the layers instead of
putting more on," Christina Alva 'O7 said.
Thayer is not yet ready to celebrate, however.
"We still have more work to do on the west end,"
he said.
The fourth floor of the west wing is still colder
than the lower levels of the building. Facilities
workers continue in the attempt to correct the
unbalanced heating system.
"We're working incrementally," Thayer said.
The men of Parrish Fourth West will have to
wait for now. Eric Glover 'O7 said he no longer even
noticed the lack of heat.

Problems in the Middle East are the
result of current policies of oppression and
disposition, not age-old hatred or conflict,
according to Diana Buttu, legal adviser to
the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
In her lecture Monday night, Buttu
emphasized the direness of the Palestinian
situation. "The water that the Palestinians
drink in the Gaza strip is not fit to grow
corn in Canada," she said to a large audience primarily composed of students.
Using maps, she discussed the way checkpoints and the planned separation wall
divide up Palestinian populations.

She maintained that Israel had never
taken a policy of reconciliation with
Palestine seriously, stating that Israel wanted to "get rid of the people and hold on to the
land." But she emphasized in an interview
that she blamed the government of Israel,
not the people. "My 91-year-old grandmother lived next to Arabic-speaking Israelis for
years, and everyone got along well. There is
a history and common culture between
these groups that often is forgotten about,"
she said.

As a Canadian teenager, Buttu felt little
affinity for the Palestinian plight. "My
father would often talk about being a
refugee, and I was very dismissive of his
situation. In fact, I remember telling him,
'You need to get over the fact that you are a
refugee. We're in Canada. Life is good,'
Buttu said in the interview.
After traveling to Israel during college,
Buttu became interested in the Middle East.
It was not until July 2000 that a conversation
with an Israeli friend inspired her to action.
"My friend basically accused the
Palestinians of not being able to compromise and wanting everything. I realized
that I hadn't done enough to educate other

Bank and has spent the last three years
working as a legal adviser to the PLO. In
this position, she has been involved with
the Mitchell Committee, the Roadmap to
Peace Plan and other peace initiatives. She
has also advised on issues of human rights.
Buttu takes exception to the fact that
the media has stopped using the term
"occupation" to describe the situation
between Israel and Palestine. "To call it a
dispute implies that there are two equal
parties on the same footing who won't stop
fighting until they feel like it," she said.
She said she felt that "occupation" more
accurately conveyed the uneven power

dynamics.
A question-and-answer session followed,
beginning with an announcement that
Public Safety was present. "It was inappropriate to publicly announce that [they] had
asked Public Safety to be present," Adam
Levine-Weinberg 'O7 said. "I feel like it is
intimidating to go and tell people that there
is essentially a police force listening."
Public Safety was present because
Buttu has had threats to her security in the
past and was once threatened at a lecture
at Harvard.
Although Levine-Weinberg disagreed
with Buttu's conclusions about "why the
Israeli actions have been carried out the
way they were," he said he was impressed
with the talk. "I thought that Dr. Buttu was
the best speaker we have had so far this
year, with regard to the Israel-Palestine
conflict. She came off as having the deepest
knowledge of the conflict, and while there
were flaws in her arguments, they were the
most consistent with factual basis," he
said.

ML evacuation under exam Loud pipes bother students
BY TERESA KELLEY

tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu

Mary Lyon residents were jarred out of their
sleep at 3:11 a.m. Saturday by fire alarms.
Students evacuated the building and stood outside in freezing temperatures and rain to wait
for Public Safety to allow them back into the
building.
"They left us out in the cold," Mary Lyon RA
Josh Zhou 'O6 said of Public Safety.
Most students estimated they were outside
for about 45 minutes waiting for Public Safety
to respond and to find the source of the problem. Zhou said 60 to 70 percent of Mary Lyon
residents had evacuated the building.
Not all students were prepared to wait so
long. Jen Roth 'O7 was wearing only pajamas
and flip-flops. Rachel Shorey 'O6 was barefoot in
a tank top. In an attempt to stay warm, she

stood on a shared sweatshirt.
"It's not safe for students to be standing outside for 45 minutes no matter what the situation
is like inside," Shorey said.
Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
suggested that students use common sense when
evacuating in response to a fire alarm and said
she was surprised students had not grabbed a
coat and shoes since it was a February night and
likely to be cold.

Although students should "act quickly and

responsibly"

when evacuating,

they can "take

an extra five to 10 seconds to grab a coat and
shoes," especially since things are easily
accessible in a small dorm room, Westphal
said.
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave
echoed these sentiments but added that he

does not suggest to also "grab your stereo and
teddy bear."
Both Redgrave and Westphal made it clear
that safety was of utmost importance and that, if
students sensed they were in immediate danger,
they ought to sacrifice personal comfort for personal safety.
At 4:01 a.m, Public Safety officers left, having

tion and unexpectedly long wait outside in the
cold is one inconvenience people "need to get
used to living with when living in a dorm."
This unusual situation was a wake-up call,
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said.
"It didn't click before this happened that ML
is a unique situation,".he said. Isolated from the
rest of campus, there is no "close-by, warm building" for evacuated students to take refuge while
waiting to be readmitted.
"After 15 minutes, it was obvious there wasn't a fire," Tim Johnson 'O7 said. He felt the students should have been allowed to stay in the
the lounge while they waited for Public Safety.
But, Redgrave said, "it's not prudent to let
people back

into

the building until

its

absolutely safe for people to do so."
There will be an effort to re-evaluate the
evacuation procedure for Mary Lyon and consider possible temporary gathering spaces for
evacuated Mary Lyon residents, Goundie
said. He and Westphal cited the Field House as
a possible temporary shelter. Shorey suggested the Strath Haven lobby as a possibility as
well.

Ryan Chahrour 'O4, a Worth resident, found the noise more than a
little annoying.
Beginning at 6 a.m., "It would
bang every two hours for 20 minutes to a half hour," he said. "It
would sound like someone was just
hitting a plank of wood outside my

room."

Chahrour e-mailed Facilities
and called the facilities office, but
received no response.
Frustrated, he voiced his concerns to Director of Residential Life
Myrt Westphal.
Westphal said loud noises were
to be expected in old buildings.
"I suspect if you lived in a fabulous

old historic home with a fabulous old
historic heating system, you'd have
the same problem," she said.
The older buildings and pipes
have settled over the years, trapping pockets of water, according to

The steam picks up these large
drops of water and throws them
around like musket balls in the
pipes until the water evaporates.
Cold weather exacerbates the problem.
"It can get quite loud, because
it's truly a hammering that's occurring," Thayer said in an e-mail.
"Every turn in the pipe is a target
wall for the slugs of water. In a
high-pressure system, you can liter-

ally blow a hole through the pipe

Short of locating every problem
area in the pipes and tearing out
entire heating systems, there is no
way to completely stop the banging.
"We'd love to replace the heating
systems in all of these old steamheated buildings," Thayer said.
He explained that hydronic heating systems would be more efficient
and much quieter. This would be a

installation, however, and
would only be possible as a summer
major

project.
Meanwhile, Thayer has been trying to solve the noise problem by
tilting the radiators.
This has eased the problem
somewhat, Thayer said, but also

noted that it could also be because

A Greek tragedy turned Italian love story
look at her. Whether the opera ends in his

failure or success remains to be seen.
The ancient myth of Orfeo and
Euridice (characters known more widely
by their Greek names, Orpheus and
Eurydice) is a popular one, having been
set as an opera over two dozen times by
different composers, orchestra conductor
Andrew Hauze 'O4 said. This production is
Christoph Willibald Gluck's original
Italian version, with the libretto by
Raniero De'Calzabigi. "I think this is one
of the best versions," Hauze said.
"It's from a series of reform operas that
Gluck wrote," Thatcher said. "He changed
the direction of opera by cutting heavy
embellishment."
Thatcher, Hauze and Lorn worked
together to create a bare-bones atmosphere
that would distill the meaning of Gluck's
simple melody lines. "Instead of trying to
make the most incredible sound, we try to
go to the essence," Lom said.
"The singing is not virtuosic," Thatcher
[Yet Orfeo]
said. "The singing is simple
is the absolute perfect role for an operatic
character
his music is powerful enough
to tame hell."
Interestingly, the part of Orfeo was not
made for a strong, deep voice
the part
was written for a castrato, a male singer
with an artificially created soprano or alto
voice. The part is otherwise sung by a
female or a counter-tenor, and luckily
Thatcher fills that need. "I put this whole
thing together because I wanted to do the
role," he said.
Thatcher's ideas came to life through
grants from Sovereign Bank and the music
department. "We have a pretty big budget,"

Mark Thatcher rehearses for this weekend's performance of "Orefeo ed Euridice."

BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
For those Swatties looking for an extraspecial Valentine's Day weekend activity,
the student-run production of "Orfeo ed
Euridice" may be just the thing.
"It's a wonderful opera for Valentine's
Day," the production's choreographer
Katia Lorn 'O6 said. "The final message is

that love triumphs over all."

The storyline is rife with romantic
drama and tragedy. "It begins as a funeral
scene," said singer, director and all-around
coordinator Mark Thatcher 'O6. Euridice
(Emily Shrader 'O4) has been bitten by an
adder, and a grieving Orfeo (Thatcher) sings
a lament. The opera moves into a trip to the
underworld, where Orfeo pays a visit to the
Goddess of Love, Amore (Tamara Ryan 'O6).
She offers Orfeo the chance to be reunited
with Euridice, on one condition: He may not

he said. This afforded an orchestra of 21
musicians
"four outside players, two
alums, and 15 students," Hauze said. "There
are a few special effects in the orchestra.
When Orfeo enters the Elysian Fields, we
imitate bird calls and other aspects of it."
Lom's ballet-influenced choreography
helps flesh out the story's missing parts.
"The dancing in this opera helps like the
chorus in a Greek play," she said. "There
are four main dances, and they're at crucial points."
The combination of baUet, singing and

mythological subject matter led Thatcher
to build a "fictitious world" for this opera.
Instead of setting it in ancient Greece,
Thatcher did not create a "uniform style in
any of the costumes or the dancing."
"It's more symbolic through the different stages [of the story] than an actual
place or time," Lorn said. "It's a really
beautiful opera. It's worth coming to."
"Orfeo

ed

Euridice"

marks

Swarthmore's first entirely student-run
opera since 1982. "Last year, there was a
large production of 'The Magic Flute' with
students in the cast, but it was all profes-

sionally done," Hauze said. For "Orfeo," no
are involved. However, Hauze did
cite the late music department coordinator
Judy Lord as an adviser. Both performances will be dedicated to her.

'Formation,' by Jeremy Fahringer is currently on display at the Kaori Kitao Gallery.

Student art comes to Kitao gallery
BY CLAIRE RUUD
cruudl@swarthmore.edu

Every piece in "The 3D Show" at the Kaori Kitao
Gallery asks to be circumambulated, touched, played
with or peered inside of. The exhibition, open through
Feb. 17, displays the sculptural work of 12 Swarthmore
students, ranging from graceful ceramic-ware to a functional life-size seesaw. It is the first show of students'
sculptural work in my memory, and the individuality
and craftsmanship of each of the pieces makes me wonder why Swat hasn't done this before.
On Monday night, I got a sneak preview of the exhibition. Stella Kyriakopoulos 'O5, the show's head curator, was putting up the work, while I helped her heft

pedestals across the floor, chatted with her about how
she put together the show and scribbled notes about the
art in my notebook. Kyriakopoulos and the Student Art
Association put "The 3D Show" together because sculpture is an underappreciated medium, and, besides, it's

so much fun.

In the hands of Swarthmore's artists, the gallery has
become a playground. There is a batch of cute little
chocolate-chip cookies with faces by Audrey Chan 'O4; a
crazy wheel made out of boys' jeans and sneakers by
Jeremy Fahringer 'O6; a gigantic piece of delicious-looking baklava by Kyriakopoulos; a seesaw for grown-ups
by Andrew Kazakes 'O4; and a light-hearted flip-book by
Andrew Gregory 'O4.
I'd love to quote for you snatches of every artist's
statements about his or her work, because they often
captured the character of their pieces so succinctly, but
unfortunately I haven't got the space. If you see any of
the artists at the gallery, pull them over and ask them
about their work. You'll be glad you did. Gregory said
something that stood out to me particularly, capturing
how pleasurable many of the 3D show's pieces are.
"There's one thing about making flipbooks that makes it
matter," he said. "Whenever someone picks one up and
gives the pages a crack, a big, fat smile spreads across

THE PHOENIX

their face. Without that it's not really worth my time."
But there are many other reasons to come to "The 3D
Show," too. Yes, it's fun, but it's also sensual and reflective. None of the work is superficial. There's a group of
gleaming, spiraling, wood-nymph forms by Jeff Mao 'O6;

three glowing urns by Marissa Vahlsing 'O6; a tactile
artist's book filled with memories of Rome by Emily
Alvarez 'O4; a tranquil, watery bowl by Chloe Le Pichon
'O5; burlap sculptures evocative of severed limbs by
SooKyoung Lee 'O5; architectural terrains made of dollar bills, wood and plaster by Adam Gerber 'O5; and an
elegant teapot embellished with a brush painting of a
snaking dragon by

Carol Trevey 'O6.
of works is meant to snag your interest and send you trekking down to the Kitao (between
Olde Club and DU) this weekend to see the exhibition
for yourself. Every single work is delightful.
Unfortunately, Kyriakopoulos says this will be the last
show she curates. It's a whole lot of work, and she has
to start concentrating more on her own art as she prepares for senior year. However, the board of the SAA
will continue to use the space for exhibitions and workshops.
I hope we see more student art like this on campus in

the future. We have such incredible artists on campus
and a great space for student shows. Our artists and art
historians should step up to the plate and make the cre-

ativity of Swarthmore's student body more visible on
campus. Organize a show of your own work or come up
with a concept for an exhibition. The space is there, the

resources are there (through SAA and other campus
funding) and, as "The 3D Show" proves, the art is worth
seeing.

"The 3D Show" is at the Kaori Kitao Gallery until
Feb. 17. The gallery is open Monday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday 7-8 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday 12-3 p.m. The closing reception will be
this Tuesday, 5:30-6:30 p.m.

February 12, 2004

So, Valentine's Day is here. Not being inspired or cheesy
enough to come up with a Seventeen magazine "the cutest thing
my boyfriend ever did for me"-type scheme for your
significant other, nor thrilled at the prospect of flower or chocolate shopping, you've turned to the classic Valentine's Day gift.
You've decided to purchase some sexy underwear for the
man/woman/detachable showerhead in your life. And while
chocolates and flowers are perishable, underwear lasts until
someone else rips it off, so you better choose lingerie wisely.
The following guide is to give you an idea of some of the
stuff that's out there. And most of the lingerie sold on the
Internet is, indeed, out there. I started with a basic Google
search, using the keywords "Valentine's Day" and "underwear." The first site of those listed was "Lingerie for the
Sensual Teen." Lingerie, check. Sensual, uhhhmm. Teen, well,
OK, that applies to about a third of the people at Swat. So I
clicked, arrived at the site of a company named The Sensual
Woman (www.the-sensual-woman.com), and was treated to a
large selection of crotchless bodystockings. Undeniably sensual. However, I would not recommend many of the products on
the Web site, as they are not returnable. I can't imagine why
the company wouldn't want someone to return a once-worn
seamless fishnet open-crotch bodystocking, but, if you get the
size wrong, then you can't get that $19.79 back.
Intrigued by the small selection of fantasy costumes on the
site, I decided to explore this avenue further with a search for
"fantasy costumes." If things have been a little boring lately
with your significant other, you might want to try role-playing
(you be "Tinkle-my-Bell," I'll be "Captain Hooker"
both
costumes courtesy of www.sexy-costumes.net). Whereas most
of the Web sites under the "Valentine's Day underwear"
search had been all naughty bras and panties, what I liked
about this particular subset of lingerie was that there seemed
to be as many offerings for men as there were for women. Most
take a uniform or other wardrobe
costumes were the same
cliche (cowgirl, geisha, Red Riding Hood), make it vinyl and
tight and missing some important pieces, and you have the
Sexy Lingerie Country Gal.
Of all the sites I went to, wildfree.com had the largest selection of naughty costumes. Other observations: Many Internet

lingerie sites offer the same costumes but with variations on
the name and price, so, if you're interested, shop around. Also,
many Internet lingerie Web sites are not concerned with the
possibility of offending Native Americans. I found the
Naughty Navajo costume and variations thereof on many of
these sites. My personal favorite from the fantasy-costume
investigation was a man's outfit I named the Reverend, which
consisted of a silk Lycra tank-top with clerical collar and silk

bike shorts with a special cross-embellished penispouch. Come unto me, indeed.

Lycra

I can't imagine why the company
wouldn't want someone to return a
once-worn seamless fishnet
open-crotch bodystocking.
But I digress. If you're not quite as adventurous, or if
you're worried about the very real possibility that your significant other will be put off by an Internet purchase, just go
classy. For women's underwear, go to Victoria's Secret or
some other respectable establishment. The selection there
ranges from an imported Italian bustier and panties set at $398
to a four-for-$2O deal on cute pink V-string undies. The selection of Valentine-specific underwear is good and much more
wearable than, say, the Miss Miner costume of hard hat and
vinyl hot pants. For men, if he doesn't desire a leopard-print
Power Sock (the new power dressing!), then a relatively classy,
comfortable pair of boxers should suffice. It will also help hold
off doing laundry for one more day, which, for many, is as
valuable as Godiva chocolates.
The last option, for that special Saturday date, is to concern
yourself with underwear as little as possible. Spend the money
that would have gone for a rhinestone thong or silk boxer
briefs on a nice dinner for your sweetheart, and go commando. Sometimes, not worrying about underwear is the sexiest
thing of all.

A Valentine's Day date
Deirdre Conner Phoenix Staff

When opposites attract
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu
Some people believe in love at first
sight. For Krista Gigone 'O4 and Eric
Shang 'O4, however, it took a little longer.
They admit they didn't quite hit it off
after their first introduction at a swim
team meeting freshman year.
"I used the word 'fuck' about as much
as the word 'the'," Eric said.
"I heard as many swear words in 10
minutes than I had heard in my whole

life," Krista said. "It was a little
off-putting ..."
"She thought I was a jerk," Eric interjected. Krista reconsidered, giggling.
"Yeah, pretty much."
Now one of Swat's well-known supercouples, Krista and Eric shared "no common ground at all" when they went on
their first date to the Valentine's Day
formal three years ago. She's from a
small city in rural Pennsylvania; he's
from Silver Spring, Md. While Eric had
gone to parties and dated in high school,
Krista played Scrabble with her friends
and got straight A's. She went to bed
promptly at 10 every night; he was a

night owl. Krista was raised Christian;
Eric was brought up atheist.
During a swimming training trip
where they spent hours in a van every
day, Eric decided to try talking to her

without the cursing. It worked a little too

well. One evening, they were continuing
an intense conversation into the early
hours of the morning in the stairwell of
Wharton AB, as only first-years can.
"Somehow, it came out that I had a
crush on someone on the swim team,"
Eric said.
"I was hoping it was me," Krista said.
It was.
The years' since have caught up with
them. Shang peppers his speech with

terms like "bull caca" and "freakin.'
Gigone can stay bright-eyed well past
midnight. They recount stories in tandem
and finish each other's sentences without
realizing it.
And from now on, the two hope they
will have everything in common: They
got engaged on Christmas Day. Eric even
summoned up the courage to tell Krista's
father his intentions the night before.
While they never imagined themselves in the old-fashioned role of plan-

Eric and Krista said they knew they were
on to something right away.
"It's definitely a little hard getting

your mind around it sometimes," Eric
said.
"I think we just fell in love right from
the start," Krista said. "Five days after we
started going out, he told me he loved
me."

Terri Peterman met the love of her life in the middle of the night, while wearing pink rollers in her hair and fuzzy bedroom slippers on her feet. She was 20.
It was 40 years ago —"before instant hot chocolate was available" —when her
twin brother, who worked the night shift at a dairy, would wake her up when he
got home. Lured by the promise of borrowing his car, she would often get up to
make hot chocolate for him and his friends from the dairy.
"I didn't usually want to date his friends, so I didn't pay much attention to what
I looked like," she said.
But Tom Narkin, then 22, was paying attention.
"She had beautiful eyes and an easygoing personality," he said, smiling at her

They went on their first date Feb. 14,1963
"He knew I liked driving, so the line was that he'd gotten a new car," Terri
Narkin said. "Obviously, it went very well," Tom said.
They were married two years later. Ever since, Valentine's Day has been a special kind of anniversary. It's nothing extraordinary, usually dinner out and flowers. But Tom and Terri Narkin say effort and special attention have kept the glue
of their 39-year marriage strong.

"It's like a switch clicks. You just know."

we would do a 'getaway weekend,' Terri said, especially
when the kids were young. But they never went far
usually to the Willow Valley
Inn in Lancaster, Pa. "It was just to have each other to ourselves. You need time
together, or it doesn't work."
Today, Tom works in the physical education department, and Terri works in
Public Safety. They can often be found eating lunch together in Sharpies.
Now that their children are adults, they have been able to pursue more farreaching interests. They went to Ireland last year and are building a house.

"I thought you were going to kill us!" Terri said. They laughed merrily at the
memory of how disconcerting it was to drive on the "wrong" side of the road.
"People say, oh, you're so lucky to have stayed married all these years, but it's
not lucky, it's hard work. The luck part is just choosing," Terri said. "It's easy to
throw in the towel."
Finding the right person may seem like the hardest part for the young, but the
Narkins said they're convinced that's a cinch. "There was just a feeling
in my
mind there was no question," Terri said. "It's like a switch clicks. You just know,"
Tom said. "You'll know, too, when it's right."

Love is a million miles away
BY F EUBEN

-

i ir most couples, Valentine's Day is a time to renew
com litments, when love rises to the surface. But for
thos I in long-distance relationships, like Carla Greenberg
'O4 i > id her boyfriend Alex, Valentine's Day doesn't mean
quit as much. While many couples will spend this
Sah 'day at restaurants, plays and movies, Carla and Alex
will be hundreds of miles apart. Carla is a senior at
Swe thmore. Alex is a Marine, preparing for deployment

to t i Middle East.
' leir relationship

started like so many military
nces. After her freshman year ended, Carla went to
wori as a temp on the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier
turn:d museum, situated in the Hudson River off of
Man lattan. Alex was in New York on leave during Fleet
Wee:, an annual event during which the city is swarmed
by n en and women in uniform, looking for a good time.

go ti check his bags. She thought he was the cutest guy
she' ever met.

"

pho e," Carla said.
I month later, in late June, while training in the
Sou west, Alex was involved in a training accident; he
was -un over by a Humvee, his foot nearly crushed. After

being released from the Naval Hospital, Alex returned to
North Carolina to continue his rehabilitation.
"I found out he was gonna be on his own, on crutches,
and on a lot of medications. The day after he got back to
South Carolina, I jumped on a Greyhound (against my
mother's wishes) and went down to take care of him for
four days. That's how we fell in love."
The couple had been living together in Swarthmore
since last June, until Alex was alerted of his imminent
redeployment. When asked about the importance of
Valentine's Day, Carla had little to say.
"We haven't been together for any of the Valentine's
Days that fell during our relationship," she lamented.
What's the hardest thing about a long-distance relationship? "Communication."

"We got into so many stupid fights over the phone"
over small things, she said. "It just makes all the difference in the world to be face-to-face. And it costs a ton of
money to visit each other," Carla said.
Many college students, even those in committed relationships, view living with a significant other as a far-off
prospect. Still fewer Swatties have worries that a loved
one will be lost or wounded in the line of duty, in some
combat zone so far from home. Yet for Carla, such fears
are a reality she doesn't seem to dwell on. Instead, she
focuses on the Alex she knows and loves so well. "He was
the first guy I'd ever known who has treated me as an
equal but also as a woman. There's something about our
daily rhythms that matches really well. We're hungry at

the same time, we're tired at the same time."

Christine Costello and Chris Artz in Myrtle Beach last

summer,

A wink and a smile
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu

In the fall of 2002, Christine Costello's mind was abuzz with
typical high-achieving high school senior stuff. She was focusing

on schoolwork, applying to college, hanging out with friends in
the suburb near northeast Philadelphia.
During a fateful trip to a church weekend retreat, though,
something completely unexpected happened. She fell in love.
Chris Artz was sitting across the room from her in a game
like musical chairs, where you wink at someone, then switch
seats with them. He winked. Later, they sat next to each other.
"It was his eyes, something about the way he looked at me,"
Christine, a first-year, said. At the end of the weekend, they
exchanged phone numbers. When they got on the phone, they
wound up talking for three hours.
"I never would have imagined. I figured I would have to go
through the college and post-college dating scene, just like in
high school," Christine said.
While many first-years struggle with ill-fated long-distance
romance, Christine and Chris have done just the opposite. He
asked her to marry him at the stroke of midnight on New Year's.
While at first she worried about how her friends and family
would react, she said they have been overwhelmingly positive.
She understands how some might think they're too young, but
firmly brushes the concerns aside.
"There was just no doubt in my mind that he was the person
I want to spend the rest of my life with," she said. And she
believes the pieces have fallen perfectly into place. "I always
wanted to marry someone who was Episcopalian like me. I want
to teach German, and he has a German last name. It was like,
wow, everything kind of fit together. It was all too much of a coincidence."
Christine bubbles with excitement at the mention of this
year's Valentine's Day.
"He says he's got a surprise for me," she said, patting the
stuffed puppy he gave her sometime over the past year and three
months they've been dating. "I can't wait to see what it is."
Christine will be spending the weekend with Chris, who goes
to the Pennsylvania State University in Reading (though he's
transferring to the main campus in Unversity Park next year).
She's not apprehensive about spending the next few years four
hours apart.
"When I look at how fast the first semester went and how fast
this semester has gone, I don't worry," she said. "It gets hard
it gets frustrating not seeing him as much. But we talk every
night for hours."

Crush tactics

What's a single to do?

Ways to show you (don't) care

BY EMILY GASSER

You know how sometimes you're walking through campus
and feeling cool, like someone should be following you with a
stereo blasting "Shoop" or "I'm
Too Sexy"? Then you see your
crush and you trip over a
garbage can. Or you run into
them in the mailroom and end
up rambling about how there
"sure is a lot ofmail today"?

Love it or hate it, Valentine's Day is coming. "I associate it with the third grade and getting little cards and
candy," Jason Lee 'O6 says. Of course he's upbeat; he has
a girlfriend. For the rest of us, Valentine's Day can be
outright depressing. As a recent post on the Daily Jolt
Forum so succinctly puts it: "Valentine's Day sucks."
But just because you're single doesn't necessarily mean
next Saturday must be spent wallowing in self-pity.

ELIZABETH HOLMAN

The point is: They know.
And now it's Valentine's Day,
and you want your crush to
think that you'd rather have
your cell phone go off in class
than spend it with them. You
want them to think that the 56times you made eye contact
with them in Sharpies today
were accidental. It's time for

The Awkward Silence

some evasive action. Or, rather,

it's time to be evasive in order
to get some action.
There are basic ways to
show your crush you're not interested. Blatantly insulting them
to their face. Filling their backpack with garbage when they're
not looking, then coming up later and throwing squirrels at
them. But, let's face it, if you're going to do that, you might as
well perform a lip synch to "I'll MakeLove to You" in their chem
lab. No, it is time for stealth, the kind of subtle manipulation

■

that only a Phoenix columnist can inspire.
Act aloof

Most people think being aloof is never commenting on their
crush's seminar paper. While this can be quite sexy, in the case
where your crush doesn't know or care who you are, it may not
have the desired effect. You need to be more calculating.
Offer to turn their homework in and then "forget."
"Accidentally" knock their Sharpies tray out of their hands.
Kick them in the butt and run away. This will show your crush

not only that you don't like them but also that you have too
many important things on your mind (friends, work, the squirrels you're holding behind your back) to notice them.

Act hostile
You may ask yourself, "What's the difference between acting
aloof and acting hostile?" This is a tricky distinction that is
sometimes unnecessary. They can be combined into a hostile
aloofness or an aloof hostility, leaving your crush breathless

with desire.

The difference is that aloofness is accidental, as in "she was
so aloof that she accidentally knocked me into the garbage. I
want her." Hostility, on the other hand, is intentional and
directed, as in "She just ran up to me and pushed me into the
garbage! I want her."
One of the best ways to show hostility is to sign up for all
your crush's classes and then undermine them when they talk.
When your crush makes a comment, say something like, "Yes, I
can see how you might draw that conclusion
if you hadn't
done the reading," or, "How interesting, but don't you think
that's more a molecular biology issue?" (This really only works
in macrobiology class. And sometimes English.)
You can also write letters to the editor that seem at first to be
cutting political commentary but end up being an incoherent
description of why your crush "totally sux." Bonus: Nothing is

Pretend someone else has a crush on them
I once did this in kindergarten, and I have never looked back.
It is important to bring it up in context. For example, "Speaking
of interpretational theory, guess who has a crush on you?" Push
people into your crush and say, "Whoa! Get a room! Some of us
are not attracted to you."
This will also give you a way to feel out if your crush might
like you. If they seem that excited some other person likes them,
back off. If they seem weirded out or unnerved by the number of
times you bring it up or push people into them, you're in the clear.
If you've acted aloof and hostile and lied about the feelings of
others but are still alone, then go back to the basics: Lip synch

Valentine's Day can be a memorable occasion even for
the unattached.
First, a little history. I know a lot of classics professors are going to come after me with sticks for saying
this, but some people think that Valentine's Day started
with Lupercalia, an ancient Roman fertility festival celebrated in mid-February. An order of priests called the
Luperci sacrificed a goat for purity, then skinned it and
cut the hide into strips. Youn§
men would run around in s
loincloths and beat
passing women with f
the strips (and with C

Euridice" on Valentine's Day? If you're unfamiliar with
the opera, here's the plot in one sentence: She's dead;
he's sad; he goes to hell; everybody weeps a lot; finally,
after spending a few scenes in hell, they're reunited and
everybody lives happily ever after. Hell and weeping
how cheerful and romantic! Though it does turn out
well in the end. Nathaniel Peters 'O7 is oneof the many

unattached Swatties truly looking forward to seeing the
show. "It makes all us single people really happy to see
so much misery on Valentine's Day," he said.
And speaking of appropriate theatrical experiences,
the classics department is sponsoring a trip to New
York City on Sunday to see Aeschylus's "Agamemnon."
This time it's the husband who dies, but it's not a
snakebite that kills him. It's his wife, who's been cheating on Agamemnon
with his nephew, of all people
while he was off fighting at Troy, in a war caused by
another philandering wife. Now, that's a great
Valentine's story if there ever was one.

MUSIC REVIEWS
Air, "Talkie Walkie"
(Astralwerks, 2004)
Nobody combines abject silliness and utter relaxation like Air. Maybe that should be an odd combination, but actually the two work in tandem: Air's
records are so loose and breezy and unconcerned, the
silly just slides in effortlessly, along with the kitschy,
the earnest, the smooth. Maybe it's all the same
thing.
Much is made of the band's Frenchness, and certainly that explains a portion of their unique sensibility (though not really their music, which
albeit
nodding to synth-schmaltz pioneers Jean-Michel
Jarre and Jean-Jacques Perry and the lounge playboy savoir-faire cultivated by Serge Gainsbourg -

draws far less from traditional Gallic song forms
than from American pop>auteurs like Bacharach and
Wilson and from the film scores of Hollywood and
Italy). Air evoke, though, less another place than
another time specifically, the 19705. Their hi-tech is
reactionary.

Their futuristic is, inevitably, retro.

they failed to have surnames that were quite as

"Bangalter and de Homem-Christo" or "Zdar and

on the swell "Premiers Symptomes") led to the
beloved 1998 debut LP "Moon Safari," which is still
their crowning achievement beautifully, unassumingly crystalline in concept and execution. "10,000 Hz
Legend," the eventual follow-up (not counting the fan
favorite "Virgin Suicides" soundtrack) was largely
misunderstood. Branching out from the coy simpliciof their debut (which largely skirted recognizable
vocals), Air let their

full-length. Thankfully reigning in some of its predecessor's excess, while not quite returning to "Moon
Safari's" state of grace (perhaps reassuringly),
"Talkie Walkie" falls squarely in the middle of Air's
catalog, which makes it a remarkably comfortable
album. "Venus" sets the tone, kicking off with a twochord piano vamp, some handclaps and a little
acoustic guitar, barely straying except to add some
hazy synth organ and, eventually, some distant
strings and bells. Further along, amusingly named
instrumental "Mike Mills" has some vaguely
Bachian keyboard lines amidst Bacharachian
acoustic swirls; the sweet "Biological" is built around
a lazy banjo figure, and "Alpha Beta Gaga," the
album's most (not very) kinetic moment, features
some inspired whistling with string orchestra accompaniment. It's all very organic
even the occasional
electronic flourishes (like my favorite moment, an
unexpected squelchy breakdown two minutes into
"Surfing on a Rocket") fit smoothly into place. And
the songs are as blissfully simple as the arrangements. "Talkie Walkie" is the rare kind of record I
could pretty easily listen to alljday long (which is
basically what I've been doingrand I'm not sick of it
yet). Truthfully, it's kind of hard to talk about without spoiling its prettiness. But listening to it and I
think, if I were Air, that I should take this as a high
compliment thinly veiled as damningly faint praise
requires no effort whatsoever.

THE PHOENIX

Searching for the subtle subtext
BY EVA HOLMAN

eholman2@swarthmore.edu

It's 5 p.m. on Valentine's Day and you're walking to
Blockbuster, aka fourth floor McCabe, in pursuit of a
romantic movie to watch with your significant other. But
wait! Unhand that copy of "Casablanca." Don't even think
about reaching for "You've Got Mail." Are you trying to
crush all the mystery out of your relationship? Of course
not.
This Valentine's Day, you need to keep your better half
guessing with a movie that isn't overtly sentimental. You
need to let them know that you alone give them enough
credit to read between the lines, to extract romance from
the most unlikely situation. Sometimes, a movie's peripheral relationships can be more exciting than the ones that
are front-and-center. Watch any of the following films,
and you'll soon discover that movie romance, like a lost
50-cent piece, is much more rewarding when you find it
for yourself.
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
Granted, you may have to wait a year to whip this
advice out, because it's not out on video yet. But "The
Return of the King" is a romantic movie. And it's not just
because of the love between Aragorn and Arwen which
culminates with the trilogy's end. The sexual tension

between Frodo and Sam is among the season's most palpable. The two hobbits' reunion after Gollum's attempts
to separate them makes the reunion in "Cold Mountain"
seem like a day trip. Except for the overly defensive "Sam

is not, I repeat, not in love with Frodo. In fact, he's getting
married to that girl he's been in love with the whole time
but never mentioned" ending, "The Return of the King" is
a powerful representation of true love. Don't even get me

started on Merry and Pippin.

"The "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea" box

set"
Fans sigh over Gilbert Blythe's journey from the boy
who calls Anne "carrot" to the young man who gives up his
coUege scholarship for her. But despite all his sacrifices,
Anne still won't have him. Why? Though not obvious in

February 12, 2004

the book on which the movie is based, viewers can see
hints of a tender romance between Anne and her "bosom
friend" Diane Barry.
From the outset, Diane Barry's dark, curly hair and
dimpled elbows seem to dull Gilbert's efforts to become
closer to Anne. The two girls' forced parting after Anne
is accused of getting Diane drunk on purpose is heartwrenching for the viewer. Yet Anne herself cannot even
verbalize a reason for the strange, unsettled melancholy
Diane's marriage leaves her with years later.
Considering that nothing in the book suggests romantic
feelings between the two girls, one can chalk the
onscreen tension up as unintentional or due to creative
direction. Of course, that does make me wonder: Why
was Anne so adamant that Diane drink all that blackberry current?
"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"
Michelle has her ever-devoted nerdy admirer and Romy
has her longtime crush on the boy who broke her heart in
high school. But the first five minutes of the movie establishes a life-long, unbreakable bond between the two main
characters. We are told that they will get together if neither of them are in relationships by the time they're 40.
Watching Romy and Michelle go clubbing together, eat
junk food together, and conspire for cars, boyfriends and
believable yet amazing jobs to boast of at their high school
reunion gives the viewer a rare example of intimacy.
Though their Mary-Rhoda argument escalates to a falling
out shortly before their trip back to high school, the dream
sequence reveals each character's worst nightmare: not
reconciling before their deaths. Each will assumedly go off
on their respective romantic endeavors, but such closeness between two movie characters rarely graces the
movie medium.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you want a lessthan-predictable Valentine's Day, I would suggest taking
a deeper look at films you think you know as utterly
unromantic. I would exercise caution, however. Save
movies like Terminator for your anniversary. Believe me,
your significant other will be flattered you think so highly of their powers of perception.

Combining the fine traditions of all-you-can-eat eateries and
getting other people to pay for you, it's the Pizzathon, at
Pinnochio's Pizzeria in Media. The players: three teams, one all
female, the others, mixed. The goal: to eat as much pizza as
possible. The prize: fame and glory. And the meal is paid for by
the losing teams.
Strategery is important in this eating contest, as teamwork is
encouraged all the teams have at least one 'truster" who's
only job is to eat the lovely, lactose-free crusts of the slices that
the others do not want. Digestive supplements are allowed, and
the trash talk should be flying.
While the teams have already been drafted and formed, the
spectacle ought to be entertaining enough, and maybe you'll
even get to be a judge. Support your local eating-contest scene
and pick up some sweet pizza-eating techniques.
And speaking of techniques, I have one recommendation for
the Pizzathon teams: Ever notice that the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles always eat their slices of pizza in like two bites? Think
like a Turtle. You'll be unstoppable.

Super Furry Britpop
Tonight: Super Furry Animals at the Theatre of Living Arts (334 South St. at Third)

Quite

simply one of the most phenomenal bands on the planet, the Super Furries transcended their Britpop roots to produce a string of freewheeling, forward-looking pop
albums incorporating Beatlesesque harmonies, punkish irreverence, idyllic folk, crack electronic programming and always infectious melodicism and panache. Perhaps the best of
these is 20015's "Rings Around the World" (my favorite record of that year), which comes
off- as a giddy melting pot of Bowie, Beck, and the Boys Beach and Beastie. Last year's
Phantom Planet was a more laid-back, rootsy affair, but it found the band's melodic sensibilities in fine form. Their last show in Philly stretched well past the two-hour mark and featured some lovely video projection work.

Just sayin' no to casual-sex trap
Selfish sex drives not enough to sustain any kind of responsible relationship
sexual relationship takes time, practice and communication. Just because I tell you I "expect" to orgasm every
time or that we're not done, it doesn't mean you can perform to meet my expectations without getting to know my
body and my quirks. So meeting sexual expectations takes
commitment. Realistically, we don't have that kind of time
or energy to throw into a relationship that is just sex.
Fourth, recognition of consequences on your relationship. You can't possibly anticipate these.
Fifth, honesty. First, Amir and Siduri exhort us to be
honest in our casual sexual relationships, and then they
remind us to "be wary of

ing proposals to benefit the community and its skill in
organizing and pushing them through. However, we
believe that once a certain point is reached, Student
Council should recognize that as a small group of students elected as administrators, they lack the authority
to unilaterally speak on our behalf when the issue at
hand deeply concerns the future of our school.
We applaud Student Council's stated goal of keeping

Casual sex is a near impossibility. Last week, Amir
Jaima 'O4 and Siduri Haslerig 'O7 set out the following
guidelines in their column "Just doin' it: a guide to casual
sex" (Feb. 5, pg. 9): informed, mutual consent; regulation of
emotional involvement; definition of sexual expectations;
recognition of consequences on your relationship; honesty; and have fun!

pletely unrealistic.
First, informed, mutual

the lines of communication open between students and
administration but itself remaining neutral on divisive
matters, rather than trying to use their position to
unfairly influence which student voices the administration hears. This is especially true of the living wage
debate, which proposes to commit very large amounts of
the school's resources toward a politically radical end
and whose basic principles and goals are hotly contested by many within the community. We thus find signs of
bias like 2001 council's partisan statement in support of
the living wage disappointing.
We do not believe the current Student Council has

done anything so egregious, but we nonetheless find
signs of the council's biased influence on the living wage
disturbing. We are concerned about the amount of overt
assistance the council has extended the living wage
campaign in communicating their political message to
the administration. They haven't appeared nearly so
involved in pushing other advocacy groups, and certainly don't seem to have been in deep communication
with those students opposing the living wage campaign.
The council is, nonetheless, doing the right thing
now by throwing the decision back to the student body
as a whole in referendum form and promising to communicate the referendum results to the administration.
However, we disagree that Student Council must openly
take a position even if the referendum is inconclusive.
We wonder how they could justify potentially taking a
side on the issue based on "internal discussion" in the
event of a close vote, even to the point of going against a
60-40 decision. This is especially worrying since, when
interviewed in the context of their office as Student
Council presidents, both co-presidents felt strongly
enough about the proposal to publicly support it. How
overwhelming would voter opposition to the proposal
have to be to convince them they had no mandate to
fight for it?
Few of us knew or asked about these students' politics when we elected them into office. It hardly seems
fair for them to take even a minor role in shaping the
student body's position on such a loaded topic.
Student Council should on this issue be a mouthpiece,
nothing more.

consent. Consent is awkward to obtain before the fact, and
after the fact partners rationalize and dissemble. Ideally,
the columnists suggest going about it by writing up a contract. Perhaps they are right: to keep casual sex "casual,"
you have to make it into a business transaction.
Realistically, this kind of dispassionate, sensible interaction isn't going to happen. And who gets turned on by writing up legal documents, anyway?
Second, regulation of emotional involvement. Psych
studies say regulating your emotions is near impossible,
and my experience supports the scholarship. I took an
informal survey of my friends (yes, a totally biased sample, but a valid voice nonetheless), and even the guys said
after the first two or three hookups, emotional involvement increases significantly. How do you not start to care
more about someone with whom you're spending time consistently and whom you experience at such vulnerable

moments?
Third, definition of sexual

expectations. I think

priority in these situations.
We can't be honest with each
other in casual sexual relationships: We're so busy trying to protect ourselves from
what they are doing and

thinking and trying to protect them from what we are
doing and thinking. In this kind of a relationship, where is
the trust for honesty going to come from?
Sixth, have fun! It is really hard to have fun when you
constantly have to monitor or suppress your own emotions, try to satisfy each other sexually without commitment, deal with the havoc the sex may wreak on your relationship and calculate how honest you should be and how
honest your partner is being.
The bottom line is that we have responsibility to the
people with whom we are in any kind of relationship. A
relationship motivated from both sides by the selfish
desire to be sexually fulfilled is bound to be messy and end
nastily. Most of us can't separate the act of sex from our
emotional lives enough to be fulfilled in a purely sexual
relationship. Even if you can, you had better be pretty
damn sure that your potential partner can, too. Each of us
has at least the responsibility to respect the needs and
emotions of others, if nothing else.

Mourning the loss of a beloved familiar face
A student remembers Judy Lord's love for all her children at Swarthmore
BY MAC CARLSON
mcarlsol@swarthmore.edu
Like many who knew and loved
Judy Lord, I was hit hard by the
news of her sudden, unexpected
death last Friday. I had strolled into
Judy's office at the top of the Lang
music building several times last
week to take care of various matters,
and as she had on countless other
occasions in the past four years, she
helped me with whatever I needed. In
these last days, she was as friendly
and energetic as always. It is only
gradually that I am coming to terms

with the fact that I will not see her
again.
Judy was one of the first people I
met at Swarthmore, for I came to
speak with her about the music program when I was deciding to apply to

the college in the fall of my senior
year of high school. Even before I
enrolled in the college, I felt that she
took a personal interest in me.

Alumnus's patience over living wage waning
Dear Editor:
Let me add the voice of one alum on the question of
the length of time it is taking the college's decision-makers to come to a conclusion on the "living wage" for the
non-instructional staff ("Board must open living wage
meetings," Jan. 29, pg. 18). Three years should be

enough. I make no attempt to conceal my partisanship
on the issue; I was one of those who got the first local
government, Baltimore, to enact a living wage by ordinance, 10 years ago. Still, I think any observer would
wonder at the slow pace of the deliberations.

Reasonable doubts
On Feb. 3, as questions
concerning the Bush administration's use (or misuse) of
prewar intelligence
were
buzzing around Washington,
the conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote,
"It is hard
to make the case
...

that the Bush administration
made honest but real mistakes about intelligence
...

One side adamantly wants to
believe that the Bushies lied;
the other side wants to

believe that there were no
mistakes." Sullivan went on

PATRICK HART

to denounce the way that peoThe Drawing Board
ple are commonly accused of
lying in our political battles.
"These days," he wrote, "every mistake people make is
immediately denounced as a matter of bad faith."
Before I get into the problem with Sullivan's statements,
let me admit right off the bat that he has a point. Our political
discourse is often too nasty and accusatory, and pundits and
politicians of both the left and the right engage in what liberal columnist E.J. Dionne calls "the politics of moral annihilation." In his 1996 book, "They Only Look Dead," Dionne
described this form of politics as one in which "it is now no
longer enough to defeat... a foe. Now, the only test of victory
is whether an adversary's moral standing is thoroughly
shredded and destroyed." Anyone who has taken a cursory

look at American politics recently can see that Dionne 1
right. Look at our own school: At Swarthmore, we tend to hea

Choosing most electable evils

EVAN GREER

Everywhere I go, I
hear people
saying,
"Yeah, I know Wesley
Clark is a war criminal,
but Kucinich can't win,
and, well, you know, anyone but Bush, right?" In
fact, nearly everyone
I've talked to on this
campus seems to feel
that they cannot vote for
the candidate that they
feel best supports their
interests. This forces me
to question what is

Thoughtcrime

becoming an increasingly loose definition of

"democracy."
Let's get a few things
straight about our would-be presidents. I'll skip Bush,
since, if you're reading my column, chances are you're

not voting for him. Let's just examine a few of the
Democratic frontrunners.
Let's start with John Kerry, senator of my home state,
Massachusetts. This poster child of democracy voted for
the war in Iraq even though Massachusetts' opinion polls
showed overwhelming opposition to a preemptive invasion. If he can't even represent his constituents on a state
level, how can we expect him to represent us all as our
president? He supports Star Wars missile defense, a highly controversial, costly and dangerous weapons project.
His positions on the USA PATRIOT Act and the war in
Iraq are vague at best. Furthermore, he is one of the only
Democrats who actually plans to increase the Pentagon
budget. (Note that it is already at more than $4OO billion a
year, over $1 billion a day.) My question on John Kerry is
this: How is he going to increase the Pentagon budget and
also improve education and health care as much as he
claims he is going to? The answer: He's not. To top it all
off, in last week's Boston Metro, Kerry said that his view
on gay marriage is "no different than Dick Cheney's."
Moving on to "liberal" sweetheart, former Gov.
Howard Dean. Dean also does not plan to cut the $4OO bil-

THE PHOENIX

lion Pentagon budget. He may have spoken against the
Iraq war, but his policies on Israel-Palestine and
Colombia show that he is certainly no Gandhi. He is

unclear about whether he'd support a pre-emptive U.S.
strike in the future, and he flip-flops on so many issues
that even his own supporters can't seem to keep up.
Finally, we have Gen. Wesley Clark. Amnesty
International declared him a war criminal when he tried
to cover up his orders for troops to bomb civilian targets
in Serbia. In an interview on Democracy Now! radio, aU
Clark had to say was, "I was doing my duty, and I have
I mean, I respect
been looked at by the law, so
Amnesty International. I think they're a good organization, but..." When further questioned, he said he had to
go speak to some other voters. He has yet to take a strong
stand on, well, anything, other than that he's going to
"change things."
The only nice thing I

ever hear people say about Clark
is that he's so "electable." How many more times will we
choose between the lesser of two evils and still find out we
got the devil? Just calling someone a "Democrat" doesn't
mean anything. If their policies are not going to benefit
the working people of this country, and their opinions are
unclear, why should we give them our support simply
based on their party affiliation? Sometimes I feel that if a
clone of George Bush ran as a Democrat, half the people
here would support him because he's so "electable."
Why should we be forced to choose among three liars
and a war criminal? I'm not sure what I'm going to do in

the upcoming election, but I hope that people will realize
that even if we had a perfect president most of the problems in our country would not be solved. Poverty, war,
racism and oppression existed before Bush came to
power, and they will survive long after him, regardless of
which wealthy white man takes the office next.

Voting simply is not enough for those who seek true

democracy. Elections may be an important right, but they
can also be a powerful smokescreen that distracts us from
other effective ways to make change. Democracy is not a
multiple-choice question. It is something we must create
and fight for with every second of our lives.

liberal arguments more often than conservative ones.
That in itself is not problematic; the problem is that som
(certainly not all) on the left assume that right-wing argu
ments are not motivated by well-thought-out beliefs but b
racism, corporate greed or some other malicious factor. As
result, people do not feel the need to honestly, engage th
right's arguments. Why should they, after all, if the right
fundamentally dishonest or evil? I am criticizing the left her
but only because, being at Swat, I tend to be exposed more fr
quently to left-wing views. At institutions dominated by con
servatives, there is doubtless a belief that liberals are mot
vated by irrational anti-Americanism, snobbery or som
other dubious force.
So, if I believe that our political discourse needs to becom
more civil, and I do, why do I take issue with Sullivan's stat
ments? While I respect Sullivan's attempt to get us to ton
down our discourse, I fear that his views go almost toward th
opposite extreme: Instead of assuming that the actions of you
political enemies always have dubious motivations, he seem
to be asking that we assume that everyone in politics
always honest about everything they do.
And that's a dangerous assumption. Just as excessive cyn
cism and angry discourse make our political culture worse, s
also does excessive deference to people in politics. There is
growing body of evidence to suggest that the BUsh administr
tion used intelligence very selectively in its attempt to persuade the American public and the United Nations to support
war in Iraq. I cannot say with certainty whether the admini
tration made honest mistakes or whether it actively distorte
intelligence to support the case for war, though I have my su
pic ions. But suggesting the latter should certainly not be take
as a sign of excessive political cynicism, particularly when th
White House has made many attempts to ensure that the com
mission investigating prewar intelligence does not have th
wide-ranging investigative authority it needs to meaningfull

determine how the administration used that intelligence.
The Iraq intelligence controversy is really just one exampl
of a larger pattern of obfuscation that has been characteristi
of the Bush administration. The White House has not coope
ated fully with the investigation of our pre-Sept. 1
intelligence on terrorism and has refused to provide the name
of the members of the board that advised Vice Presiden
Cheney on energy policy. These are not trivial matters
it i
important for the country to know who is setting our energ
policy, to know whether we went to war based on false claims,
to know whether the Sept. 11 attacks could have been prevented. Certainly, liberals should not fall into the trap of discrediting all conservatives or conservative ideas because of some
questionable actions by our current administration, but nor
should they shy away from legitimate questions because they
fear it may increase political cynicism.

For a radicalism

Everybody knows that
Malcolm X was radical and
that the Rev. Dr. King was not,
but it's usually for the wrong
reason. Most agree with that
statement because one advocated self-defense while the
other turned the other cheek,

as if the dialectic between the
two greatest philosophers of
the last half-century could
come down to something as
petty as "Kill whitey!" vs.
"Love thy neighbor." White

I

and black bourgeois fearful of
black power have caricatured

these heroes as mere icons of
the violence vs. non-violence
controversy. We must see
beyond that red herring to their true African-American
dialectic
human rights vs. civil rights.
It is not a question of either-or, human rights or civil
mmmmmmmmmmmmm

rights. Each is a concentric circle of justice, with civil rights
as the inner circle and human rights as the outer circle. Here,
civil rights are particular, specific to the United States of
America. Human rights are universal, general to every
human being. Since 1776, civil rights have been the North
American Caucasian's by birthright. Since 1965, they have
been the North American Negro's by an act of Congress. The
Declaration of Independence is the white man's holy writ of
freedom. The black man's is the Voting Rights Act.
It is the Rev. Dr. King's crowning achievement. When he
got former President Lyndon Johnson to sign it in 1965, he got
him to establish the basis for Negro civil rights. It expires in
2007. Thus, the Negro's civil rights here, based on his right to
vote, are provisional. Former President Ronald Reagan
amended the act in 1982. Will the 38 states required to pass it
in 2007 renew it for another 25 years? Better yet, how great
was the Rev. Dr. King's crusade for civil rights when at its
very culmination he negotiated the Negro's right to vote via a
renewable contract? Is the civil rights movement so myopic
and shortsighted that its greatest activist couldn't see more
than 25 years ahead?
Every 25 years, Uncle Sam decides the civil fate of several
million Negroes. Every 25 years, Negroes must ask the white
man yet again for permission to vote. Uncle Sam is arbiter of
his freedom, his dignity, his "somebodiness."
The Rev. Dr. King christened Marginal Man "somebody"
and had Johnson sign his life away to an existence along 25year margins. "Somebody" lives wholly within the periphery
of North America as a minority, on the superficial level of
civil rights, a quarter-century at a time.
Malcolm X's "Original Man" lives on the radical level of
human rights. He is part and parcel of the Negro majority living in Africa and all over the Pan-African world. His human
rights go back to Osiris. More immediately, his human rights
go back to the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights.
Civil rights are Uncle Sam's prerogative to give or to
renew or not. But human rights are every man's birthright.
Malcolm X was radical and the Rev. Dr. King was not, because
human rights are radical and civil rights are not. "Radical,"
according to the Oxford English Dictionary, means "forming
the root, basis, or foundation; original, primary." Human
rights are the root and foundation of civil rights.
Like Dorothy and her friends as supplicants of the Wizard
of Oz, the Rev. Dr. King and his fellow civil rights activists are
supplicants of Uncle Sam. The former asked the wizard for
brains, heart, courage and a ticket back to Kansas. The latter
asked Uncle Sam for civil rights as a token of "somebodiness."
Malcolm X saw Uncle Sam not as a savior, but as a criminal. Whereas the Rev. Dr. King saw Uncle Sam as the standard-bearer of justice, Malcolm X more circumspectly saw the
U.N. Declaration of Human Rights as the standard. He threatened to take Uncle Sam to trial before the U.N. tribunal for his
crimes against Negro humanity, namely slavery and Jim
Crow segregation. Tragically, he was assassinated. In the
aftermath, Rev. Dr. King, like Esau, sold out our birthright for
civil rights on a 25-year lease.
Such is the renewable legacy of our great civil rights
activist. But the radical legacy of our great human rights
advocate is for all time, for all human beings.

Think before signing living wage pledge
eflts such as health insurance. It might even make cuts.
Does it make sense to pay some workers more while oth-

BY GARTH SHELDON-COULSON
garth sheldoncoulson@swarthmore.edu

At Swat we take our activism seriously. Indeed, the
appeal of Swarthmore's social conscience delivered
many of us from the throes of admissions ambivalence.
We should be especially serious, then, in scrutinizing
those social causes that will affect not only their intend-

ed beneficiaries but also the college itself. The living
but, sadly, its proponents have
wage is one such cause
shirked the special care this issue deserves.
Last week the Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign distributed a pledge of support at

the top of Sharpies. The pledge stated, "I support a living
wage at Swarthmore.... I believe... this decision must be
made no later than May of this year."
I would be so bold as to suggest that when hungry
some of the most proudly self-avowed liberals
encounter a liberal-sounding pledge on
in the country
their way to dinner they're inclined to sign it. I was.
But this isn't any old liberal issue. This is a question
that could have far-reaching consequences for the quality of the education here. On top of that, it's not even like-

Swatties

ly to benefit the people it sets out to help.

Let's look first at the proposal. The new report of the
Ad Hoc Committee on the Living Wage recommends a
new wage floor of between $10.72 and $13.89 per hour, plus
added health and child-care benefits.
The cost? Between $BOO,OOO and $2l million each year.
(The living wage campaign favors the top end of that.)
That's a lot of money. For, say, $l5 million each year
we employ 10 percent of our full-time faculty. With that
money we could put 60 more students on our average
financial aid award each year.
So that's a lot of money, and for the living wage campaign to propose "not that the current budget pie be divided [further], but that the size of the pie increase" is misled at best. Don't we, students and alumni both, have an
interest in maintaining the quality and reputation of our
education? I think so if, for instance, we want the tools
we'll need to accomplish real change when we leave Swat.
"But Garth! Wouldn't a living wage be 'real' social
change at its finest?!" Well, no, probably not.
First there's the threat of cuts down the road. If forced
to shoulder the spectacular financial burden of a living
wage, the college would be less likely to replace workers
who depart

and less

likely voluntarily to increase

February 12, 2004

ben-

ers become unemployed or lose benefits?
The living wage committee's report tells us we would
"have to count on the college's good will" here. But would
you count on "good will" to win the battle against a tightening budget, especially when nobody's looking?
Then there's the problem of overqualification. If Swat
wages go up, jobs here suddenly become more attractive.
The result, of course, wouldbe that more qualified people
apply for them. Our current staff would, over time, be
not a
replaced by more skilled or experienced workers
bad thing for us students, but a very bad thing for our
current staff and others from their socioeconomic level.
Isn't it them we're trying to help?
The solution, according to the committee, is to 'adopt
hiring criteria
so that employees won't be over...

...

qualified." In other words, we'd have one set of rules, the
current one, to ensure we hire the best people we can, and
a new set of rules to avoid hiring the best people at all
costs. Plus, we'd need to keep new job seekers from
underrepresenting themselves. Not very easy. (Probably
because evading basic economics is never very easy.)
Finally, we should realize that the principle of the living wage couldn't possibly be generalized to the entire
economy without causing inflation or drops in efficiency.
If, for instance, we paid a living wage not only to Swat
staff but also to supermarket workers, farm workers, etc.,
then most things our Swat staff would want to buy would
be more expensive anyway. Oops.
I confess these arguments have responses, and my
views aren't set in stone. I fully support reasonable wage
increases and the dialogue this issue has provoked.
Still, it was irresponsible for the living wage campaign to ask us to sign pledges. Avowedly they hope to
"create a climate in which Al Bloom can't write anything
other than a pro-living wage recommendation." But very
few pledge signatories with whom I talked were even
aware of all its potential ramifications. A pledge is an
unwavering commitment to a considered opinion. Right
now, can many of us truly form either?
So I say we shouldn't pledge support to this very
weighty issue without first scrutinizing it deeply and
completely. Nor especially should we partake in urging a
hasty decision on the matter.
Nor, most of all, should the living wage campaign
have asked us to.

A tribute to Lefty
For those of you drawn to this column by reading the title and thinking
"Finally, somebody is writing about the greatness of Phil Mickelson," well, sorr
to disappoint you. Phil is off to a solid start in 2004, and I will even be so bold a
to say the Greatest Player Never to Have Won a Major will see his lifelon
drought end in 2004. Nor is this column about Swarthmore's legendary lef
handed golf coach, the handsome and eligible, so far as I know, Mark Duzensk
No, instead this column is a tribute to lesser-known sports, sports that don't gar
ner great audiences or have lucrative television deals but that are still equall
as important in our everyday lives. The sport I have chosen today to be repre
sentative of all these lesser-known sports is the sport of refrigerator repair.
Repairing refrigerators is a sport, you might ask? Well, I kid you not. Las
summer, I was driving back from a family vacation on Cape Cod when my siste
Pam and I passed through a little town i
Connecticut called Colchester, up at the intersec
tion of Route 16 and Route 85. Sure enough, righ
there off the road was the Refrigerato
Repairman's Hall of Fame. Granted, the buildin
wasn't as big as the one in Canton or as classy a
the one in Cooperstown. But it was a buildin
that nonetheless served an important purpose
to recognize the best refrigerator repairmen thi
country has ever seen.
Intrigued, my sister and I stopped for a tour o
the facility. The first thing we noticed was th
gigantic statue out front dedicated to Left
Laycock, the "Babe Ruth" of refrigerator repair
and the greatest repairman that has eve
lived. Lefty, who passed away in 1996, when th
CARLTON DAVIS
shrine in Colchester was built in his honor, ha
an incredible story, one that has touched me per
Rounding
sonally and is so compelling that I feel the nee
to share.
Growing up in poverty in urban Detroi
Lefty Laycock had no career goals. He came from a broken family and wa
raised by a single mom with four children. After graduating from high schoo
Lefty had no intentions of going to college, since his mom was unable to pay an
of his tuition. But Lefty's hard work in high school earned him an academi
scholarship to Kalamazoo College, where he graduated with a degree in eng
neering. Instead of using his engineering degree to design bridges or to becom
a consultant, though, Lefty realized, after a summer internship with Sears, tha
he gained more satisfaction from repairing people's refrigerators.
Lefty operated as a repairman from 1947 all the way through his retiremen
in 1972. He was so good in the late '4os that he quickly rose to the top of his pro
fession in a field dominated by famous repairmen such as Jose Encalde
Popeye Wright and Olivio Montella. Within two years of starting his ow
refrigerator repairing business, Lefty was no longer getting calls from house
wives who heeded their freezers fixed. Instead, he was being summoned t
private businesses to fix a refrigerator so that the boss could enjoy a cold one
on his afternoon break. Within five years, Lefty had started an emergency
service hotline where people could call in and request immediate attention to
their important appliances. When once asked why he became a refrigerator
repairman instead of taking a more lucrative job, Lefty replied, "I do it because
I enjoy being called to somebody's house the night of a dinner party to fix their
ice machine. Minutes before the guests arrive, I'll fix the machine, and the
freezer would once again create cubes of ice. The mere thought of somebody
hosting a party with no ice for their guests was horrifying enough. To know I
could do something about such a situation was an opportunity I never could
have passed up."
What is even more fascinating about Lefty is that he worked during a time
when all the refrigerators and freezers, regardless of brand (including big names
like GE, Frigidaire and Kenmore), were made exclusively for righthanded repairmen. Lefty, being left-handed, was at a disadvantage from the
start. He never complained about this inherent disadvantage, and he never gave
up. Instead, he fought through this adversity and let his natural ability shine
through, and he became the greatest repairman of all time, right- or left-handed.
Lefty also revolutionized his profession. Not only are all refrigerators today
made bi-dexterously (the change took place in 1984 after refrigerator companies
realized left-handed repairmen were out there and thus made it easier on the
companies' warranties), but repairmen are also being paid at higher rates than
ever before. Furthermore, Lefty discovered shortcuts while fixing fridges so
that repairmen could make shorter and thus more appointments in a given day.
The reverse triple bifecular method? That was Lefty's invention, an invention
almost as historic as Whitney's cotton gin. Lefty is also responsible for creating
the Refrigerator Repairman's Olympics, held every October in Colcheste
Events in the competition combine speed, athleticism and skill, and the
include the speed repair, the motor refabrication and the icebox obstacle
Needless to say, the annual games attract the best and the brightest repairme
in the entire world.
Lefty Laycock should serve as an example for us all. A person who may no
have been blessed with the most talent made the best of what he was given
found something he enjoyed doing, loved helping others and is now foreve
remembered in the annals of history. So, if you're ever in or near Colchester,
strongly urge you to stop by the hall of fame and pay Lefty the tribute and thank
that he truly deserves.

The men's and women's swim teams fell to the Dickinson Devils Feb. 8. The Garnet now
prepare for Centennial Conference Championships at Franklin and Marshall Feb. 20-22.

Devils burn Garnet ide
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's and women's swimming teams
fell last weekend at Dickinson, as the Red
Devils blew past the Garnet men and women
135-70 and 125-80. The losses drop the men to 36 overall and 2-4 in the conference and the
women to 6-3 and 3-3 in the conference this

season.

But there were bright spots for both teams
in Saturday's performances. For the women,
Michelle Horn 'O7 came away as a double winner in both the 200 IM with a time of 2:19.69
and the 200 breaststroke with 2:33.87. For the
men, Eric Shang 'O4 also emerged as double
winner, clipping out a time of 2:04.85 in the 200
IM and later a 2:21.50 in the 200 breaststroke,
and the team of Anders Taylor 'O7, Andrew
Koczo 'O7, Michael Auerbach 'O5 and Jason
Horwitz 'O7 combined for a winning time of
3:47.43 in the 400-yard medley, repeating their
successful performance against Gettysburg
the weekend before.
Despite their loss to Dickinson, the Garnet
Tide men still felt they swam well against the
top team in the conference. "They swam very
well," Shang said. "We did, too, but Dickinson
is the team to beat this year, especially at conferences. Dickinson is undefeated in the conference, primarily because they lost almost
nobody from last year, while most of the other
teams were gutted."

February 12, 2004

The women's team also swam well against
Dickinson, but was overwhelmed by the more
experienced squad. "Dickinson had some pretty good depth," Horn said. "We swam really
well as a team and recorded a lot of season
best times, but in the end they just had more
depth than we did."
Despite losing their last two conference
meets, both the men's and women's teams
were confident going into Wednesday night's
meet at Washington College, their final
Centennial Conference matchup of the season
before conferences.

"Its our last regular season meet, so we
should have lots of energy," Horn said. "Since
it's the last meet before conferences, we'll go
out and have fun, but we're mostly focusing
more on conferences right now."
Both teams are also focused on. their
upcoming conference meets Feb. 20-22, and
have already begun training for the event.
And, despite their places in the middle of the
Centennial Conference rankings, both teams
are confident they will perform well at the end
of the season meet.
"Its going to be a crapshoot at conferences
because of the way everyone stacks up in the
conference," Shang said. "Primarily, we've
lost sprint free styles in our dual meets, and
the fact that all the other teams are going to
be putting their strength against one another
at conferences is going to help us in the
standings."

Garnet on playoff path
BY MATT SCHILLER

The Garnet men's basketball team
pulled to within a game of playoff
position as it knocked off second-place
Johns Hopkins 64-51 and held off
Dickinson 58-56 in overtime in two
crucial Centennial Conference matchups last week.
Last Wednesday night, the Tide
jumped out to an early lead against
the visiting Blue Jays. Led by the hot
hand of Matt Gustafson 'O5, the team
went ahead 28-16 at the half.
Swarthmore held off a second half run
that pulled Hopkins to within five by
making 15 of 16 free throws down the
stretch. Gustafson finished with 20

points, and Jeff Maxim 'O7 recorded 10
points and pulled down 14 rebounds

for his fifth double-double on the season. All five starters scored in double
figures for Swarthmore.

Women lose two CC match-ups
Point guard Zoey Adams-Deutsch drives past her defender on the way to the basket. The
women have dropped their last two games to conference opponents Dickinson and
Muhlenberg. On Saturday, the women led the majority of the time against the Devils.
Dickinson closed the first half with a 17-9 run, trailing the Garnet 38-30 at the horn. The
Tide turned with just under eight minutes left in the game as the Devils stormed back and
won, 64-59. Tri-captain Katie Robinson led the Tide with 22 points, while Adams-Deutsch
added 13 points. Radiance Walters tied a career-high 16 boards. On Tuesday, the Garnet
trekked to Allentown and met up Muhlenberg. The Garnet could not outlast the tenacious
defense and hot shooting of 'Berg. The Garnet never saw the lead in the 103-56 loss. The
team looks to pick up a win at home Feb. 12 at 7 p.m. against the Bryn Mawr Owls.

his sixth double-double of the year
with 12 points and 13 rebounds. Tricaptain Jacob Letendre 'O4 played all

rebounds for his efforts.

"We'd been playing really well
defensively in the past couple games,
and I think that was the key," coach
Lee Wimberly said. "When we played
[Hopkins] the first time, we had a difficult time defending inside, and I
thought we did a better job this time
around."
The Tide continued their strong
defensive play at Dickinson on
Saturday, where the Garnet slipped
past the Red Devils 58-56 in overtime
to split the season series at one a

piece. The two-point victory improved
Swarthmore to 10-10 overall and 7-6 in
conference.
The first half was particularly

ugly, with neither team shooting
above 30 percent from the field.
Despite trailing 24-20 at the break, the
Garnet battled back to pull even at 52-

52 at the end of regulation. In overtime, Swarthmore fell behind 56-52 as
it failed to score a point for the first
2:54 of the period.
Finally, Gustafson knocked down a
key three-pointer to cut Dickinson's
lead to one. After a defensive stand,

defense the whole game," Letendre
said. "We really kept them off the

boards.'*
The Tide won despite the absence
of tri-captain Jared Passmore 'O4, who
missed the past two games due to back
spasms. Fellow captain Chris Loeffler
'O4 was also limited by a sprained
ankle and foul trouble.
"It was a back-and-forth game the
whole way," Wimberly said. "Neither
team shot the ball very well, but any
road win you can get is a big plus."

The team hopes to ride this
momentum into Muhlenberg on
Wednesday, where the Tide have not
won since 1997. Swarthmore is going
for a season sweep against the Mules
(6-14, 4-9 CC), who have dropped five
in a row and 10 out of their last 12.
Game results were unavailable at
press time.

The Garnet have won eight out of
their last 12 games and remain opti-

mistic about the coming week. "We
have a really good chance to win. We
just need to keep our focus," said

Gustafson, who is the team's leading

scorer with an average of 20.0 ppg.
"We need to keep on trying to minimize turnovers and do as well as we
can on the rebounding."
Swarthmore also plays the Green
Terror of McDaniel (6-14, 3-10 CC) at
home Saturday. Both of these games
are significant for the team if it wants

a chance to make the conference tournament for the first time in the last
seven years. That would be an impressive feat for a team voted to finish
ninth in the conference preseason

polls.

Men’s tennis aces Division I Farleigh Dickinson
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore men's tennis opened its
spring season on Saturday with a win that
lived up to the reputation of the historically successful team. The Garnet swept
Division I Farleigh Dickinson University
7-0.
Zach Rodd 'O6, Brian Park 'O4 and Jon
Reiss 'O7 were double winners for the
Tide. At number-two doubles, Rodd and
Park defeated Brendan van Wasbeek and
Chris Bowers 8-3. Rodd then competed at
number-one singles, defeating Alex Sarria
6-3, 6-4. Park also emerged victorious at
number-four singles, trouncing his opponent Rodrigo Avila 6-1, 6-L Reiss's first
victory came at number-three doubles
with Joey Spadola 'O4, winning 8-1 over
Avila and Diego Palacios. He was also triumphant at number-two singles over Dan
Wayne, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.

"I was pretty happy with how well the
team played, especially for the first match
back," Rodd said. "Spadola and Justin
Durand 'O5 stepped in and played really
well, since Ben Rae 'O4 was out with an
injury. I was just happy to be back on the
court again, because I missed some time"
being injured. I think we still have a lot of
room to improve as a team, which should
be pretty important coming up when we
have matches in February and March
against tougher teams in our conference,"

he said.

Visciano 'O4 secured a 6-4, 7-6 win over
van Wasbeek, while number-five singles
player Justin Durand 'O6 easily overpowered Palacios 6-1 6-L The final win that
sealed the singles sweep came from Adam
Wallwork 'O7, who defeated Chris Bowers
at number six, 6-1, 6-2.
The team's victory was not without
hard work and preparation.

"We had been having captains' practices in the fall, and our first week of official practices began the week before [the
Dickinson meet]. About eight or
10 of us had been playing a couple hours a

Farleigh
day

and working out afterward," Reiss

said.
In his first year of collegiate competition, Reiss overcame any butterflies he
had in his stomach. "I was a little nervous, since it was our first dual match. It
was the first time that we were playing

for the team, because the fall was mostly
individual work. The competition here is
definitely a step up from high school,
especially since we are starting the season playing a number of Division I
teams," he said.
Swarthmore men's tennis has a history of successful seasons. The team graduated 51 Division 111 All-Americans, qualified for 24 out of the past 25 seasons for
the NCAA team tournament and captured

February I£, 20Q4

four NCAA Division 111 team titles. The
team attracts outstanding players from
all over the nation. Alex DeGolia 'O7

played in high school for a team that
placed second and third at a National
Invitational Tournament in Southern
California. "Many people stop playing
tennis after high school, so those who do
play in college are in the top tier of competition," he said. "The talent on the
Swarthmore team is definitely very
deep."
The outlook for this coming season
looks optimistic to Reiss. "This season, I
think we are very strong. It will be tough
to beat the top five or so Division 111
teams to win the national championship,

but I think we have a shot," he said.

The
Garnet Tide hosts Temple
Saturday and matches up against Mount

Saint Mary's Sunday. Both matches will
take place at Swarthmore in the Mullan

Dickinson Dude owns
you, Swarthmore fan
OK, we didn't want to do this. But we have to. We realize that
this column gets written at least once every year. But that's
probably because it has to be. And now we're doing it. We're
writing that yearly column where a Phoenix sports columnist
calls out Swatties for being terrible sports fans.
Take the women's basketball game against Dickinson on
Saturday, which Swarthmore lost 64-59. Frankly, this was a
tough loss to take for a lot of reasons. At times, our team played

brilliantly, but toward the end
we pretty much collapsed. We
seemed to stay stuck on 59
points for the last 15 minutes of

the game, and we committed
some costly turnovers. In the
end, we lost only by a few
points, and Dickinson celebrat-

ed an emotional victory and
season sweep on our home
court. This was pretty bad. But
it wasn't the worst. For us here
at 90% Half Mental, the worst
thing was the behavior of our
own fans.
We'll take this opportunity
BEN WHARTON
to introduce a character that
will figure greatly in the development of this column. At this
game, there was approximately
one Dickinson fan. This is understandable, as Dickinson is over
two hours away from Swarthmore. But this one fan (who we will
call Dickinson Dude) practically ruled the Tarble Pavilion. He
had pots and pans. He stomped out the D-Fence chant. He heckled our foul shooters mercilessly and gave the refs an earful.
Dickinson Dude was loud and very annoying, and Dickinson
Dude serves as an easy and clear contrast with our Swarthmore
partisans (who we will call the Swatties). The Swatties were
meek. The Swatties were mild. No Dickinson foul shooter was
heckled (even though Dickinson took 28 free throws to
Swarthmore's 14). The D-Fence chant arose only sporadically
and was weak. There were no pots and pans. Up against the
force of nature that was Dickinson Dude, the Swatties failed to
even make their presence known. And the worst part of this is
that it was all captured on WDCV-FM 88.3, Dickinson College
Radio. Yes, that's right, any random Red Devil fan milking his
or her cow and listening to the game back in Carlisle would
have heard a bleacher-full of Swatties cowed by Dickinson Dude.
This should not be. Now, you may be asking us, "Ben, why
didn't you make some noise? Why did you not rise up against
the tyranny of Dickinson Dude?" That, gentle reader, is because
we are forbidden to by our status as a game official. That's right,
during basketball games of both genders, we here at 90% Half
Mental serve as the official timekeeper and scoreboard operator
of the Swarthmore College athletic department. So next time
you wonder how the numbers go up on the big scoreboards
inside the field house, look across to the scorer's table, to the left
of the fellow speaking into the microphone, and you will see us,
diligently hitting buttons and flipping switches. As scoreboard
operator and timekeeper, we are forbidden from expressing too
vocally our pleasure or displeasure at a particular event. So
alas, the very vocation that allows us to make money while seated close to the action at nearly every basketball game also prevents us from acting as a true fan should. It's sad, we know.
But this, obviously, should not be stopping you, the average
sports-appreciating Swattie, from expressing both your admiration for our own coUegiate athletes and your disdain for the
goons of the opposing team. We know it can be done. Don't say
you don't have the time. We have an honors seminar and a significant other who monopolizes all our time, and we still manage to attend nearly every basketball game. Yes, we get paid, but
that's beside the point. We would go even if we didn't get paid.
And, as a senior, we can remember back to when our women's
basketball team rose to the utmost glory, winning the
Centennial Conference in 200 L That year, the Swatties made
themselves known, and Tarble Field House became a tough
place for opponents to play. Some things have changed since
then, but the effort level that our basketball players bring with
them to every game has not. It's a damn shame when the only
voice they hear is that of Dickinson Dude.

exact same time in the 800-meter event. James edged out his younger sibling by two-hundreths of a second.

Golden rivalry at Ursinus Invitational
BY COLTON BANGS

Those who attended the Frank Colden Invitational
last Saturday at Ursinus witnessed what was perhaps
one of the greatest races in Centennial Conference history. "That was incredible to watch. It was one of the most
interesting races I have ever seen," Njideka Akunyili 'O4
said of the performance of James Golden 'O5. Golden was
running his first race since cross country season.
He found himself running neck-and-neck in the 800meter against his own younger brother, Haverford runner freshman Tim Golden. It was a classic battle
between youth and experience as well as a microcosm
of one of the greatest rivalries in Division 111 athletics.
With the battle lines drawn, fans from both schools
were sporting "Golden vs. Golden" stickers on their
shirts and screaming at a fever pitch. The two runners
crossed the finish line stride for stride. The race was so
close, runner Vernon Chaplin 'O7 said, "you couldn't
even tell who won. It was a photo finish. We didn't find
out who won until two hours later." Finally, it was
announced that James "the Golden Boy" was victorious
over Tim by a mere two-hundredths of a second, with a
time of 2:05.29.
Other top Swarthmore runners were Garret Ash 'O5,
Akunyili and Sarah Hobbs 'O6. Ash placed second in the
5K run with a time of 15:50.34, which coach Peter Carroll
acknowledged as one of the fastest times in the conference this year. Akunyili placed second in the 800 with a
time of 2:25.61, and Hobbs followed right behind her at
2:28.77.
Another strong race for the Tide was the men's 1,500,
in which Chaplin finished seventh (4:10.77) despite coming off a leg injury. Keefe Keeley 'O6 had a breakthrough

24

run with a time of 4:14.51, and Paul Thibodeau 'O6 and
Alex Elkins 'O6 finished with strong times in the 800
amidst the excitement of Golden vs. Golden. It was also a
good meet for Nat Erb-Satullo 'O7, who ran a personal
best 17:04.85 in the SK.

On the Swat women's team, Emily Wistar 'O6 pulled a
of 10th-place finishes in the 800 and 1,500, while
Jessica Zagory 'O5 was competitive in the 200-meter run
and high jump. Vicky Woo 'O6 and Jennifer Yee 'O7 ran
their first races in the 1,500 and managed to qualify for

pair

the conference championships.
The Garnet travel to Boston next weekend to compete
at the Valentine Invite, hosted by Boston University,
where they hope to, if nothing else, improve on their top
times. "It should be a really tough meet on one of the
fastest tracks we run on all year. It will be our best
chance to post some good times before the conference
meet," Chaplin said.
Regarding the trip to Boston, Carroll said, "The track
is phenomenal
the competition is really good for getting our top kids primed for the conference champi-

onships."
Approaching conference championships, the Tide
are poised to capture high places in several events.
After finishing ninth as a team last year, Chaplin said,
this year could be different due to the addition of
strong athletes in previously unfilled events.
"Hopefully, with increased depth in the sprint and field
departments, the team will climb out of the basement,"

he said.
"For conferences, we focus more on individuals than
how the team does as a whole. For the events, that we do
have people in, we have really good people. I think
every runner is going to do better than last season,"
Akunyili said.
