Claire Weiss For The Phoenix

Although most students now use Windows-based computers in their dorm rooms, most of the college's
labs, like this one in Kohlberg, contain Macintoshes. Some PC users complain of a bias toward Macs.

Two PCs for every Mac, survey says
BY GERRIT HALL
After collecting the college's
first-ever data on student network
use at the beginning of the semester, Information Technology Services discovered that 67.5 percent
of student-owned computers run
a Windows-based operating system. Now ITS, which has traditionally provided more support
for the Macintosh systems übiquitous on campus several years
ago, must decidehow to deal with

the changing reality of student
preferences.
According to the ITS survey,
which asked questions ofall students who use network connections, students withPCs cited network incompatibility and a shortage of public PCs as significant
complaints. Those problems were
not noted as frequently, however,
as the lack of 24-hour access to
public computer areas and lack of
PC support for popular software
like

WordPerfect

Kaleidagraph.

"There's a lot less support for
PC users," said Wuryati Morris
'O4, associate consultant for ITS.
ITS began providing limited
support forPCs two years ago, but
since then the number of PC users has skyrocketed. Some members of the college community
now feel that support should rise
accordingly.

Student complaints about the
bandwidth shaper that has been in
effect for nearly three weeks may
soon be assuaged as Information
Technology Services considers raising the per-person bandwidth quota.
"Right now, the shaper is working very we 11... but we are also not
utilizing all of the bandwidth that
we are buying," said Mark Dumic,
manager of networking and systems
for the college.
ITS, formerly the Computing
Center, plans to increase the bandwidth-per-person limit slowly, possibly up to 192 kilobits per second
(kbps), at which point the network
traffic peaks just under capacity at
10 megabits per second (Mb/s).
"We'd take it slow," he said.
Since the implementation of the
bandwidth shaper, many students
have expressed concern about slow
download speeds. Posting on The
Adam
forum,

Jolt
Kwiatkowski 'O2 wrote, "Instead of
occasional slowdowns lasting a few
moments, we [now] have slowdowns
that last twenty-four hours a day."
Several other students questioned the process that resulted in
the bandwidth shaper. "It was made
without any open discussion with
students," an anonymous author
wrote.

Colin Moore 'O2, the newlyelected Student Council delegate to
the College Budget Committee,
promised in his campaign to push
for the allocation of more money for
Internet bandwidth at the college. "I
think it's unfair punishing the entire student body because ofa hand-

And, according to Moore, Student Councilis planning to fully in-

vestigate the situation this semester. "I would say it's definitely our
chief issue," he said.

Bigger pipe not an option
Last year, Swarthmore, Bryn

Mawr and Haverford shared a single
10 Mb/s fiber optic connection to the
Internet. The service provider did
not constrain the bandwidth use,
however, so that in effect the three
colleges had unlimited bandwidth.
"We were peaking at about 25 Mb/
s," Dumic said.
In addition, last semester ITS had
no way of regulating individual use.
When they noticed a student using
an inordinate amount of network resources, they would go through an
elaborate process to find out the
person's identity. By that time, however, "the damage had already been
done," Dumic said. "We weren't proactive, we were reactive."
Because of the need for more *
bandwidth, each of the three colleges purchased their own 10 Mb/s
line over the summer. ITS felt that
the current system, several times
faster than a T-l line (which only
supports about one and a half Mb/s),
still needed to be constrained, however.
With unlimited bandwidth, the
college peaked at around 18 Mb/s,
according to Dumic. Even if the

Abu-Jamal guilty, says Flynn
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

A modest crowd filed into the Friends

Meetinghouse Wednesday night to listen
to Dan Flynn, a journalist and speaker
whosemission is to debunk the cause for

death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal.
Flynn discussed what he referred to
as the facts of the case, all of which
pointed to Abu-Jamal's guilt. He later
brought up arguments commonly presented by Abu-Jamal supporters and to
refute them. He claimed that Abu-Jamal
had actually confessed to his crime, that
the defense witnesses had given insubstantial testimonies and that Abu-Jamal
had never given an alternative account.
He also cited the lifestyle choices ofsome
of the prosecution's witnesses, implying
that the testimonies of two eyewitnesses
were less significantbecause the eyewitnesses were prostitutes.
Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing
Philadelphia police officer Daniel

Faulkner in 198 L He languished on death
row for 10 years before his case became
the object of public outrage when his
claim that he had been the victim of a
taintedtrial went public via NPR broadcasts.
Although members of Just Cause, an
active pro-Mumia group on campus, were
present at the event to hand out alternative propaganda in favor of granting
Mumia a new trial, no planned protests
happened. One disruption that did occur
was the interruption of Flynn's presentation by a pair of Mumia supporters. At
several points in the presentation, they
loudly questioned the speaker's speculations about Abu-Jamal's case and at one
point yelled at a Villanova reporter for
taking their picture.
Flynn began his presentation with a
quote that "only weaklings suffer no criticism." He proceeded to describe why

those who support Abu-Jamal's cause
have no evidence to support their claims

and are part of a broader system in which
those who promote diversity and tolerance are actually proponents for intolerance of anyone who does not support their
ideas.
Flynn listed various world leaders,
musicians, academics and student groups
that had promoted Abu-Jamal's cause to
the point ofmaking him a celebrity in his
own right. He informed the audience of
Abu-Jamal's own actions taken to promote his own fight, including abook, commencement speeches and radio broad-

casts.
During the question-and-answer session following the speech, a woman listed
justificationsfor her view thatAbu-Jamal
should be granted a new trial and asked
Flynn whether he believed that AbuJamal had been fairly convicted beyond
a reasonable doubt. Flynn quickly said
that he did but then proceeded to tell her
that all the facts shehad enumeratedwere

flimsy.

Departments consider
adding course minors
Though the faculty have already approved a
plan for Swarthmore to offer course minors in
addition to Honors minors, decisions about which
departments will offer minors and the varying
criteria for them now rest at the department level.
The course minors proposal was advocated by
the Council on Educational Policy last spring and
approved by the faculty on May 16.
But the requirements for specific minors are
far from being determined. According to Craig
Williamson, associate provost and professor of
English, the Curriculum Committee has
recommended that all departments propose a
draft for course minors and submit it to the
committee by Dec. 1
According to Charles James, chair of the
English department, the major questions the
departments face now are the number of credits
needed to complete a minor, how to weigh entrylevel courses and primary distribution courses
and whether to offer a capstone exercise or
comprehensive seminar at the end of a student's

studies.
The departments also need to decide if
divisions within the majors will hold true for
course minors as well. In the English department,
for example, majors must take a number of
courses on both pre-1830 and post-1830
materials.
But according to Peter Holm 'Ol student
representative to the Council on Educational
Policy, requirements for course minors shouldn't
vary too greatly from one department to another.
"Each department will determine what constitutes
a minor in that department, but in general it will
be five courses for a minor," Holm said.
Although the Curriculum Committee has not yet
received any proposals for minors from individual
departments, Williamson said he is hopeful that
most departments will choose to offer a minor.
Williamson said the course minor elective will
be in effect "probably at the earliest next fall for
next year's sophomore class."

SAC: Referendum abuse of SC authority
BY DANNY GUEVARA
The two Social Affairs Committee co-directors this week
accused Student Council of abusing their authority over the
committee. SAC's co-directors, who are paid employees of the
student body, said the council failed to consult them when the
gameroom was moved out of the basement of Tarble and into
the smaller student lounge space on the first floor.
Although the council has final jurisdiction over all SAC affairs, SAC co-director Rodney Morris 'Ol cautioned the council
against carelessly wielding that power. "SAC co-directors are
herefor a particular reason and haveoutlines and objectives to
fill," said Morris. "[Council members] are irresponsibly overlooking the mechanism that is already in place."
Morris said the council unfairly took away a student lounge
and deprived SAC of offering more games to students. Traditionally, the gameroom has also contained ping-pong tables,
snack machines, tables and a television for student use, but, in
the new location in Tarble, two pool tables and video game
machines now take up the entire available space.
According to Morris, Student Councilneeds to consider the
practical matter of where to store the extra equipment for the

gameroom before going forward with its planned campus-wide
referendum to decide the fate of the basement space. Voting for
the referendum is currently set for Nov. 1-3.
The council, however, decided this week to go ahead with
the referendum because it believes the decision to move the
gameroom to the student lounge in the main floor of Tarble
was a wise one.
"[A larger] game room was available before, but it wasn't
being used," said council co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol
SAC co-director Christopher Sajdera 'Ol agreed but proposed
that the problem was poor facilities, not an inherentflaw in the
space available.
"We didn't have a real gameroom. There was graffiti on the
walls and broken equipment stored in the basement. It was a
real run-down facility, but there was nothing we could do," said
Sajdera. "Every time we went to [Vice President for Facilities
and Services] Larry Schall, he would essentially tell us to get
lost."
Sajdera also advised against putting the basement space in
Tarble onto a referendum, proposing instead that the student
lounge be restored and the basement be renovated for use as a
real gameroom. He said such a move is overdue.

BCC plans anniversary lecture series
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

The Black Cultural Center's yearlong
series of speeches focusing on
Swarthmore's history of service to black
students will begin Friday with a speech by
Dr. Ilaiyu Moses on black students' self-esteem and ethnic identity.
The series, organized in commemoration of the BCC's 30th anniversary, aims
both to celebrate past successes and reassert the responsibility of the BCC and the
campus at large for providing continuing
support for black students.
Assistant Dean Tim Sams, director of the
BCC, emphasized that the series is a campus-wide event and that support of students
of color is "the entire community's responsibility." He pointed out that Swarthmore
graduates black students at twice the aver-

age national rate and said that "an inte-

gral part of this is supporting black stu-

dents and students of color in such a
competitive environment. Our students

are successful because our campus is
A lot
successful in supporting them
ofother colleges can't say that."
TheBCC describes its mission as providing a "safe space" for students that
reflects black culture and values and
provides opportunities for students interested in cultural leadership. Other
important goals include contributing to
the college's effort to present a
multicultural education to all students
and offering emotional and intellectual
support to the black community,
...

In keeping with these goals, Sams said

that the series will focus on a legacy of
supporting black students in "a concrete

and tangible way." The Anniversary Collection is entitled "Season of Sankofa:
Looking Back, Charging Ahead." Sankofa
is a West African symbol that represents
looking to the past to empower thefuture.
Each speaker will concentrate on a different approach to backing black students, including self-esteem, athletics, the
liberal arts education and the retention
ofcultural identity.
The presentations will include question-and-answersessions. Several speakers will meet afterwards with faculty
members specific to their topic. Moses
will have a dialogue with the dean's staff,
while Olympic bronze medalist Jair
Lynch will sit down with members of the
athletic department.
This Friday's speech will be held at 1
p.m. in theLPAC Cinema.

Wharton renovations
to be completed soon

A sentimental goodbye

Renovations to Wharton will be completed by
the end of fall break if everything remains on
schedule, according to Vice President for Facilities
and Services Larry Schall. The latest bout of
renovations, which focuses on the basement of
the C-D portion of the dorm, is the last part of an
extensive renovation of the dorm begun earlier
this year.
As part of the current work, which began in late
August, the walls and ceiling have been repainted
and separate men's and women's bathrooms
have been added. Plans remain to construct new
lounges and a conference room.
Earlier this year, the entire living section of the
dorm was refurbished. Those renovations
included the installation of new carpeting and
more sprinklers and the construction of new
lounges. The dorm rooms themselves were also
repainted and carpeted, and the entire dorm was
given new lighting.

Two students found
guilty of plagiarism
In separate meetings both held the week of
Sept. 20, the College Judicial Committee found
guilty and punished accordingly two students for
separate cases of plagiarism.
One student had plagiarized from papers
written by another student in a previous
using them for two assignments in a course he
took last spring. He was denied credit for the
course and suspended for the spring 2001
semester.
The other, who had used direct passages from

denied credit for the course but not accorded
other punishment.

BU students protest at debates
BY JON TRIPP
THE DAILY FREE PRESS (BOSTON U.)
(U-WIRE) BOSTON

-

Thousands of presidential debate pro-

testers stormedthe streets outside the University of Massachu-

setts at Boston's Clark Athletic Center Tuesday night, targeting
the exclusion ofthird-party candidates such as Ralph Nader and

Patrick Buchanan.
Demonstrators including a significant number of college
students continually battled with police throughout the day
and night as the presidential debatebetween Democratic nominee Al Gore and Republican hopeful George Bush seized the attentionof the nation.
The debate was in its opening stages when police deployed
pepper spray into the crowd of protesters outside UMass-Boston.
At 9:15 p.m., just 15minutes after the candidates took the stage
inside the building, protesters began crossing police barricades
surrounding the building, at which point police responded aggressively.
"People started across the gates with their hands up," said
Patrick Sawyer, 18, who was among the first to be doused with
pepper spray. "They said that they were nonviolent; they were
just going to walk to thefront door. The cops started hitting people
and spraying the crowd still behind the barriers."
At least 10 people were treated for exposure to the spray, according to paramedics at the scene.
Within 15 minutes, eight people had been arrested for disorderly conduct, said Lt. Morse of the Massachusetts State Police.
After the initial incident the crowdremained peaceful for the
duration of the debate.
At exactly 10:30 p.m., in conjunction with the end of the de-

bate, the protesters once again grew restless outside the Clark
Athletic Center.
Raising their handsand slowly approaching the debatebuilding, 20 protesters again crossed the barricade toward the building housing the debate, at which point they were promptly arrested.
Simultaneously, ralliers tore the barriers containing their
assembly and seeped into the streets. Riot police with nightsticks
drawn and mounted officers quickly movedinto position directly
in front of the crowd, establishing a similar flank to the right of
the protest area.
The protesters used the portable barriers to their advantage,
rearranging them to shieldthemselves from the mountedpolice,
who were attempting to re-establish the perimeter. Protesters
formed a human chain across the four-lane road, chanting
"Whose streets? Our streets!" and "This is what democracy looks
like."
Authorities advanced toward the protesters, forcing themto
move away from the campus or face arrest.
A large number ofcharter buses arrived at that time, and
rumors began floating that the buses were to be used to transport protesters who would not leave the area peaceably.
The debate protests had been violent almost from the very
beginning. Two hours before the debate was even scheduled to
start, Gore and Nader supporters engaged in several verbal and
physical confrontations, at least one of which had to be broken
up by officers.
"They were just yellingat each other," said Che Arrajj, a Nader
supporter, who witnessed one such altercation. "Then (a Gore
supporter) threw a punch." The attacker disappeared into the
crowd before authorities could respond, according to Arrajj.

Both cases were brought to the attention of the
committee by the professors of the courses.

U. Iowa students rally
against Nader's exclusion
from presidential debates
BY ERICA DRISKELL
THE DAILY lOWAN (U. IOWA)
(U-WIRE) lOWA CITY, lowa Ralph Nader supporters
rallied on the Pentacrest Tuesday afternoon in order to
raise issues they said would not be addressed in Tuesday's
debate between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush.
They also wanted to vent their frustration that Nader
was not allowed to debate with the two "mainstream" candidates, said University of lowa graduate student Jeff
Carlson, a member of UI Students for Nader.
Nader, who is attracting between 3 to 10 percent of the
vote in various national and state polls, offers stances on
issues that differ from the center-of-the-line Republican
and Democratic candidates, he said.
"We aren't arguing for a third-party alternative,"
Carlson said. "We are arguing for a second party."
Nader was not allowed to participate in the debate because both the Republican and Democratic parties fear losing power and votes, said UI sophomore Alex Pickett, a UI
Students Against Sweatshops member and Nader supporter.
"We're being silenced and controlled by what's in your
wallet, the dollar," he said about corporations sponsoring
the presidential debate.

Two-thirds of students with home computers now use
PCs. It is a substantial change from prior years, when
Macintoshes dominated the campus.

is not great at this point," said biology professor Amy
Vollmer. "If I have PowerPoint on my Mac, for example,
they have people here who support that. If I have
PowerPoint on my PC, they may or may not know how to
troubleshoot that."
The college's emphasis on Macintosh support datesback
to the 1984-85 school year, when the college had to decide
which computer platform to use. At the time, computers
were primarily text-crunching machines, so the college
went for the superior user interface, choosing the
Macintosh after determining that it was the most user-

friendly system.
Three years ago, the college recognized the growing
popularity of PC computers and began moving toward better accommodation ofPC users. In 1998, ITS (then the Computing Center) began a pilot program for support of PC
computers, and support services for PCs have increased
since then. The fourth-floor computing lab in McCabe,
which used to house Macintoshes, is now filled with PCs.
Despite grumbles from some students, the people in ITS
feel that with these support services they are doing a good
job of accommodating PC users. "We try to support what
people want," said Robin Jacobsen, manager ofclient services and special projects at ITS. "We find software that
runs on both systems and work to reduce conflicts."
The results from the ITS survey at least partially support Jacobsen's analysis of the situation. About 85 percent
of the people surveyed said the dorm computer consultants were usually or always "friendly and helpful." Other
consultants received similarly high marks.
Either way, PC users inevitably face frustrations in the

Macintosh-reliant environment.
"In my computer science class, we use the program
Mathematica on Macintosh computers, so I can't open my
work from my own computer," said Gregory Lok 'O4.
Jacobsen said that she was slightly confused by complaints of PC incompatibility with the campus network.
She suggested in a report to the ITS staff that "early network issues" were the source of such problems.
But when asked, many PC users report minor frustrations such as those reported by Lok. Some students feel it
is illogical for the campus to remain Macintosh-based when
a majority of the students now use PCs.
"That only takes into account the student's perspective,
and neglects what the faculty needs," Jacobsen said in response. She pointed out that many professors, especially
those in the natural science departments, use Macintosh
computers in instruction.
When asked, four professors from the natural sciences
were generally indifferentabout which computer platform
they use. Vollmer preferred Macintoshes, but felt that she
could make the transition to PCs with a little support.
Eric Jensen, a physics professor, said he tends to prefer
Macintosh computers, but finds that the software selection
for PCs is sometimes superior.
"I guess it doesn't really affect me that much," he said.
Ginger Indivero, a chemistry professor, said that she
uses both PC and Macintosh computers, and had no preference either way. Frederick Orthlieb, in the engineering
department, prefers Macs personally, but finds that PCs
have better lab software. He said he would use either platform.

OCTOBER 05, 2000

Since the college budget wouldn't allow for more bandwidth to be purchased,
Dumic said a method had to be found to
keep Internet use within the budgeted
amount. During meetings over the summer, the bandwidth shaper was discussed, and an evaluation version was
brought to the college. After working out
some technical details, ITS decided to
limit each student's bandwidth to 128

THE PHOENIX

Aware of the foggy legal terms surrounding programs like Napster
which, according to Dumic, is the single
largest application using bandwidth at
the college, accounting for nearly a third
of total bandwidth use some students
wonder if the college is simply trying to
protect its assets.

Judy Downing, director of ITS,
stressed that the purpose of bandwidth
constraints is solely to keep student?
within the available limit, not to cut
down on file sharing over the Internet.
She added, however, that "the college
needs to educate students on copyright
issues."

ITS denies blocking ports
Many students were upset at the lack
of student input in the initial decision.

Student discussion of some type, Moore
said, "would have been better than some
decision handed down from on high, in
a random e-mail some afternoon."
Downing explained that most of the
ITS meetings are held during the summer and "it's when we do most of our
thinking for the next year," she said.
"Unfortunately, that means that students

aren't around."
In addition, Dumic said, "This is a
product that was not even available in
the spring."
He emphasized that the bandwidth
shaper was not implemented simply because of the actions of a few. Rather, he
said, it was "the collective increase in
the use. Most applications use as much
bandwidth as they can get." Without any
constraints, he said, the college would
quickly run out of resources.
Some students, noticing slow download times of MP3 files, accuse ITS of
specifically blocking the Internet ports
used by programs such as Napster and
Hotline. Downing denied the claim.
"There is no port blocking," she said.

Dumic conceded that ITS was con-

straining Napster for a few weeksbefore
the shaper could be implemented because "we were dependent on our vendor" for the bandwidth shaper, which
had not yet been released. In the Sept. 14

issue of the Phoenix, however, Dumic
denied allegations of port blocking.
Many liberal arts colleges, including
Amherst, do in fact block programs such
as Napster. Downing intimated, however, that such an act wouldconflict with
the spirit of the college. "It's just not the
way we do things at Swarthmore," she
said.

Complaints abound
Downing and Dumic emphasized that
they have received very few actual complaints about the policy. "It is truly a
few," Downing said. "Probably under
twenty."
But though they may not be voicing
their complaints directly to ITS, many
students are unhappy with the effects of
the bandwidth shaper.
One of the biggest complaints about
the shaper is the effect that it seems to
have on streaming video. It is "no longer
of acceptable quality," Jeffrey Regier
said in a forum post. "I am addicted to
C-SPAN, and now I can't even get video."

Dumic, however, said that there
should be no noticeable change in the
quality of online video. The computers
in Beardsley are bandwidth-limited just
like dormitory computers, he said, and
they "can receive live streaming video
from CNN, ABCNews.com, and other
sites with no problem at all."
He also noted that many streaming
video servers only broadcast at about 20
kbps, "so we've been able to get very good
quality video at well within the band
width limitations."
Other students report slowdownloading times for files.
Dumic, however, said that downloading speeds under the shaper are good.
"We're averaging about a megabyte per
minute," he said as he downloaded a
seven megabyte (56 megabit) file in under seven minutes. He added that most
MP3 files are three to five megabytes (24
to 40 megabits), so students should be
able to download them in under five
minutes.
He said that some students may misinterpret the downloading speeds that
appear on their screens. Napster and
many other Internet applications display
transfer rates in kilobytes per second,
or K/s. 128 kilobits per second is approximately equivalent to 16 K/s.
And that amount should be more
thanmost students require, Dumic said.
"128k is much larger than anything going into someone's house," he said. "It's
equal to a dual-ISDN line; it's twice the
speed of the fastest modem." Cable mo-

dems, Dumic said, are no better, since
many subscribers share the same line.
"I have a cable modem, and the throughput is not very good," he said.

Several options for increasing connection speeds, however, were proposed
by posts in the forum.
The first option involved leaving the
bandwidth shaper on during normal
classtime, from around 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
and then turning it off during the

evening and weekends.
The problem, Dumic said, is that the
peak network usage is between 1 p.m.
and 1 a.m. "I don't see how we could turn
off the shaper at, say, 5 p.m.," he said,
"because that would create problems for
students trying to do useful academic
work."

The second proposal was dynamic
proportioning of the bandwidthbased on
the number of users on the system. In
other words, if 100 students are on the
network, each one gets one-tenth of one
Mb/s, while only ten students would be

allotted a full megabit each.
Dumic, however, was ambivalent
about the idea. "These products are
so new, they are very fragile, and I
would be afraid of breaking them,"
he said. In order to use the bandwidth
shaper in thefirst place, he said, they
had to ask the manufacturer to make
custom modifications.
Perhaps, Dumic surmised. "A year
from now we might be able to do some
more fine tuning." Right now, "It's
just too sophisticated for these products."

Future of bandwidth limits
ITS will likely raise the individual
bandwidth limit until the total bandwidth use is just below the 10 Mb/s
that the college pays for.
And Dumic said that outbound
Internet traffic, since it is utilized

less, might be loosened even further.
Meanwhile, over the next few
months, the CSC will be discussing
other issues important to the distribution of bandwidth, such as equity
whether, in some cases, students
would be allowed access to more
bandwidth.
Moore hopes that the administration will give more careful thought
to future decisions relating to
Internet bandwidth. Increasing it, he
said, "would have a great effect on
student life, much more than they
realize."
"This is something we live with
for a while," Dumic said, "and then
make changes."
He and Downing are both very receptive to the idea of a student discussion or fireside chat to debatethe
issue. "If Student Council asked us,"
Downing said, "we'd be there."

Fighting ville apathy
The Borough of Swarthmore has never been, nor will
it ever be, a college town.
Despite the fact that the college accounts for around a
quarter of the borough's population and is by far the
borough's largest employer, it is the rare day indeed that
businesses in the ville stoop to cater to or even care
about college students.
Borough business owners admit they aren't concerned about serving the college community. "I sell what
I like," said C. W. Smith, owner of Cricket Way, Ltd. It's
not entirely clear what's more disturbing that no one
cares about students, or that when businesses targeted
to students do come along, they almost inevitably fail.
The demise of Sugarplums as well as The Jumping
Cow and The Bean Bag, the two coffeehouses once open
in the train station, hints at a dilemma that should
trouble anyone interested in the economic survival of
the ville. Is the college failing to support the ville, or is
the ville not making an effort to court college students?
The answer is yes and yes. Had students overcome
their apathy toward the ville long enough to realize that
Sugarplums was a worthwhile business, the owners
might still be making milkshakes today. At the same
time, Sugarplums, like other ville businesses, wasn't
aggressive enough in wooing students' minds and
wallets
few borough businesses offer student-friendly
prices, and fewer still consistently advertise on campus.
Over 30 years of not-so-benign neglect have withered
the borough's economic flower, and for both practical
and social reasons, it's hard to imagine the ville ever
becoming a Wellesley or a Williamstown.
What can be done?Students would wholeheartedly
support restaurants and cafes that venture outside the
tried-and-true pizza or Chinese formulas, not to mention
any place open very late to hang out or to grab a bite to
eat. Even simple things like regularly advertising on
campus and offering student discounts would improve
the vine's standing among students.
Until both business owners and students start caring
about the ville, nothing will change. The ville will
continue its steady slide into economic oblivion, and
students will continue to complain abouthow boring the

ville is. It could be otherwise.

A bandwidth solution

Favoring something in theory is sometimes different
than favoring it in practice. Three weeks ago we praised
the idea ofthe college's new Internet bandwidth shaper.
But now that it has actually been turned on and each
student's access to the Internet has been restricted to 16
Kbps, it is clear that the new speed limit is just too slow in
practice.
Our prior conclusion that"another essential part of
the college's computing policy shouldbe purchasing more
total bandwidth whenthat becomes necessary"
deserves much more emphasis. It is necessary now. The
bandwidth shaper permanently enforces speeds once
common only during severe network traffic jams.
College personnel have pointed out that even with the
bandwidth shaper's current speed restriction, downloads

are still faster than with a modem. But because modem
technology is so slow to begin with, that's like saying that
it's faster to send a letter via FedEx than regular mail.
True, but a telephone call is fundamentally faster than
either method. We shouldn't have to resort to comparing
our once-rapid download speeds to those of a modem.
Because of the cost, the college is reluctant to pay for
any more bandwidthunless the current limitation is too
slow for academic purposes, which it may in fact be. But
ifrecreational use of the Internet is driving our complaints about slowdowns, perhaps we don't needthe
college to spend more money. There are plenty of things
with no academic purpose that students pay for as part of
the student activities fee, not our tuition.
A huge share of the activities fee pays for the Halcyon
yearbook, something students never receive until they
are alumni. If additional bandwidth is important to
student life, the college should fund the Halcyon and let
Student Budget Committeespend some ofits money to
help pay for something students want while they are here.

THE PHOENIX

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Lack of WSRN schedule a disservice to campus
Dear Editor:

Every semester in years past, the editors of The Phoenix
have kindly allotted WSRN two pages of space with which to
publish the schedule of radio shows. Though two pages may
seem like a lot of the paper for the editors to sacrifice, the size
of WSRN's schedule demands the space for legibility.
This format had also proven very popular for the listeners
of WSRN. Many would hang this schedule on their halls or in
their rooms as a quick check of what kind of music was playing and who was in the studio. Unfortunately, now WSRN and
its listening community find themselves denied this privileged
service, and we want to voice our disappointment.
Perhaps our substantial appreciation for The Phoenix's
cooperation in this venture has gone too long unexpressed.
Perhaps we have taken this service for granted over the many
years. Perhaps this is the reason that this month The Phoenix
editors have informedthe WSRN board that we would only be
allotted one page of paper. Perhaps this drove them further to
demand that we pay them an advertising fee for this reduced
offering of space (which is too meager to publish a legible
seven-day schedule).
We at WSRN have rejected The Phoenix's offer, instead
electing to publish our schedule independently. We will be
printing a limited number of copies of the schedule at a considerable cost to ourselves
a price comparable to the
Phoenix's "reduced" advertising rate.
This means a significant reduction of circulation of this
semester's schedule. This was not an easy decision to come to
and we would like to express our dissatisfaction with our negotiations with The Phoenix.
The Phoenix editors claim that their decision was driven

by a lack of advertisement funds, as well as a formal policy
demanding that their content not be dictated by any campus
interest. We find little merit in either of these claims. We ask

the editors: what is the purpose of a campus paper, if not to
serve the campus?
We at the board understand that advertising revenues
help keep the Phoenix a viable publication and that the 19
percent budgeting cut has affected all campus organizations, even our campus paper. We also understand that allotting space for the WSRN schedule would demand that
some of the Phoenix's usual content be reduced.
However, we only request this space once per semester
and believe that it is in accord withThe Phoenix's goals as
a campus publication. Some would even claim that traditionally the WSRN schedule has proven the most popular
it's probably the only part of the
feature of the Phoenix
paper you'll ever find hanging on a student's wall.
With regards to the issue ofWSRN dictating the content of
the Phoenix, while we agree that the Phoenix should not be
sharing roles with the Weekly News as a completely eventand organization-related publication, the schedule is a special exception that is difficult to produce in any otherformat.
Also, history will show that this content policy has not
proven unbreakable, as evidenced by past columns by the
Sexual Health Counselors and Spike.
Clearly, while WSRN and the student body have become
accustomed to the schedule service provided by The Phoenix, The Phoenix is not specifically obligated to print the
schedule. However, history has proven that this is a valuable service to the college community. We strongly feel that
the paper should be first concerned with serving the campus, which we feel includes publishing the WSRN schedule.
This semester this will not happen. We hope that the
students at Swarthmore will make it known to The Phoenix that they want the schedulepublished in the paper next
semester and in the future.

Anorexia, bulimia
not laughing matters
Dear Editor:
I am responding to last week's article "Fat! How to lose
weight and look like a British pop star" (Sept. 28). I found
the author's mockery of anorexia and bulimia offensive
and misguided.
Suggesting different methods of losing weight, the author writes, "A great number of people have found that
self-imposed starvation and self-induced vomiting are also
effective methods for losing and keeping off weight. Some
even regularly ingest laxatives to induce 'rectal vomiting.'
Too bad these strategies inevitably lead to unattractive
frailness, enamel-less teeth and chronic shit stains, as well
as a mangled digestive tract."
The author inappropriately makes fun of the
life-threatening and physically damaging symptoms of eating disorders. Erroneous, sarcastic opinions like these stigmatize eating disorders while minimizing their very real
danger. He also falsely suggests that people with eating
disorders are motivated merely by a desire to be thin. However, this is usually just a small part of eating disorders, as
most are manifestations of emotional problems.
Unfortunately, our society continues to find mockery of
eating disorders socially acceptable. We have all heard or
even participated in offhand remarks such as, "I wish I could
be anorexic for a month," "I'll just be bulimic and throw
this up," or "You're eating like an anorexic." Joking about
eating disorders is the same as teasing about cancer, AIDS,
depression or diabetes, which seems unfathomable.
The severity of eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia
and compulsive overeating needs to be realized in the public consciousness in order to dispel the social taboos and
myths surrounding eating disorders. Eating disorders are
serious mental and physical illnesses extracting large emotional and physical tolls.
For example, eating disorders cause death, osteoporosis, heart damage, throat damage, electrolyte imbalance
and liver damage. The individual also suffers deeply emotionally. Only when eating disorders are perceived as serious illnesses rather than shallow girls on extreme diets
will the romanticization of the waif image be eradicated.
Unfortunately, this article perpetuates a popular, harmful perception.

Hip coffee house unlikely
Dear Editor:
This is a follow-up letter to your recent article on the
closing of Sugarplums ("Ville ice cream parlor melting

away," Sept. 28).
I am a Swarthmore resident who was involved with both
The Jumping Cow and The Bean Bag, two coffee houses on

the site of the Swarthmore train station. Both hired
Swarthmore students and, more importantly, were active,
sometimes hyperactive places where the college and the
community could meet.
When the Bean Bag closed its doors in the spring of 1998,
we moved our Poetry Series (Poets Prophets) across the
street to the Booksource. Our next reading there is this Saturday with Russian-American poet Alex Riasnovsky at 7 p.m.
Both venues featured art, music and poetry. In ourpoetry
series, we featured members of the Swarthmore College community, including faculty, staffand students. It was a way for
community poets to meet with poets from the college.
The closing of the Bean Bag was due to the lessor of the
train station deciding he did not want yet another coffee
house there but rather wanted to expand his business, which
was within his rights. However, many of us felt that since
Bill Cumby was also mayor of Swarthmore, he might have
taken community interest more into his considerations.
Many of us feel that we could use another off-campus
place where both communities could meet and interact.
However, the Cow especially presented programs that some
community members consideredradical, though I'm not sure
why. The Poetry Program presented a ConcernedPoets about
Mumia reading, there were numerous angry and political
folk singers and there was some controversial artwork.
However, unless someone with both courage andfinance
is interested, it probably won't happen. Or if it does, it will
be a safe place, where students can fearlessly bring their
parents and "the only news is weather."

Sex ed important to social development
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Professor Schuldenfrei's letter addressing
the sexuality class offered this semes-

ter ("Professor admits e-mail inappropriate," Sept. 28). I appreciate
Schuldenfrei's clear statement of his
concerns about this course and I am
glad that he voiced themto the college
community.
I have not taken Topics in Human
Sexuality at Swarthmore and thus cannot offer any information about this
course in particular. However, I am

concerned that Schuldenfrei's letter

implies that sex education at the college level is unimportant and not deserving of credit (in exactly which
department this credit is given is not
my concern).
Because I did not attend the class
meeting which discussed slang terms
for genitalia, I do not know and can-

not defendthe purpose of this exercise.
However, I think it would be a mistake
to dismiss the value of sex education
on the basis of a disagreement with
one activity of which the exact details
are not known.
Sexuality is of great interest to
most students and given the often inadequate or abstinence-only sex education in many high schools and parents' reluctance to address these issues, a college course may be many
students' only opportunity to receive

accurate information about sex and
their bodies. We are all aware that information gathered from friends or the
media is often negative and incorrect.
The reality is that sex can be a lifeand-death issue and college students
deserve accurate information regarding it.
One of the general goals of sex education is feeling comfortable talking

and thinking about sex, which helps
students understand theirdesires and
boundaries, discuss them with their
partners and protect themselves from
infections and unwantedpregnancies.
Furthermore, if Swarthmore students
are not sexual now, sometime in the
future they probably will be.
The main goal of college education
is to prepare graduates for the future.
If students don'tlearn to talk about sex
and respect themselves, their bodies
and theirpartners, sex can be disturbing and even life-threatening.
I hope that the Topics in Human
Sexuality course at Swarthmore is
consistent with the goals I have outlined, and I hope that my opinion provides a reasonable response to
Schuldenfrei's concern about the
value of the credit offered for this
course.

Suspicion of borough police unwarranted
Dear Editor:
I was appalled by the strong
anti-police sentiment in Brandon
Silverman's and Jordan Brackett's

comments and

in the Student
Council's concern about "increased

police presence on campus" ("Increased borough police presence worries Council," Sept. 28). True, there is
tensionbetween the police and the student body, but it isn't caused by the
police trying to intimidate defenseless

Swatties.

From my observations of student
behavior toward the officers and from
comments such as those made by
Silverman, it seems it is very much the
students' fault. I don't know why
Swatties feel their "elite status" gives
them special privileges, but when students greet police with shouts of
"five-oh" and general hostility, they

can't expect good relations. It is absolutely unacceptable for supposedly
well-educated and socially conscious
people to hate and harass the men and
women who put their lives on the line
to make Swarthmore a safe place and
not a crime-infested hellhole.
It is even more shocking when the
officers are harassed when they come
on campus to protect the students
from a sex offender. But could this student hostility be caused by increased
police presence, so dreaded by the Student Council? I doubt it.
Aside from 911 calls, the last time I
remember seeing a police car on campus was during the MTV techno party
last year, and that was a single officer
parked on the opposite side of Parrish,
not there to bust students but to protect them in case something happened.
This is not exactly what I would call

an "increased presence."
The police come on campus when
they are called, and if you are stupid

enough to get them dispatched, be it
by pulling a fire alarm or starting a
fight, you deserve the consequences.

The truth is that it would be so easy
for police to bust Swatties if they really wanted, but you don't see patrol
cars parked outside Paces, Olde Club
and DU Friday and Saturday nights

picking off drunk students as they
walk home, and I think this is a testament to the police department's desire
to avoid interference with the student
body as much as possible.
So next time you see a Swarthmore
police officer, instead of making them

feel unwelcome, smile and thank them
for keeping this campus as safe as it
is.

Olympic gripes unfounded

Dear Editor:
Can somebody please tell me who it is
that likes me?
About two weeks ago, I got this flattering
e-mail telling me that "someone you know
likes you." For the life of me, I don'tknow
who itis. It is killing me. So if it's you, please
tell me. Or if you know who it is, please tell
me. Or if you just have a guess, let me in on
your hunch.

Dear Editor:
I am not a big fan of NBC, but still I find Ted Chan's complaints
about the network's Olympic coverage ("Olympic coverage too sappy,
cultural," Sept. 28) completely without foundation.
First, I was surprised to find that the author of a sports column
apparently had no idea when the Olympics started. The "two hours of
cultural dance and festivities early in the week in the middle of prime
time, including a seemingly endless pseudo-Peter Pan
little-girl-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean piece" which Chan thought of as
inappropriate "interpretative dance" material shown instead of
"goddamn sports" was actually the Olympics Opening Ceremony. Of
course there weren't any other events going on. Duh.

barrassing.
I have also considered the possibility that
it is just a friend playing a trick on me. If
that is true
Pablo, that's really mean.
There's one more possibility. Since these
things are based on e-mail addresses, it could
just be the result of a typing mistake. My

Swarthmore e-mail is "fmartinl." There is
also an "emartinl," so maybe this person really just likes Eric Martin 'O2 (who is, by the
way, much better looking than I am) and
doesn't even know who I am. That would be
even more humiliating.
So if you can help me out at all, anybody,
please do. One more thing: if you really like
me and want me to like you back, it will probably be more effective if you just sit with me
next time you see me by myself at Sharpies.
Frank Martinez 'O2

Next, Chan complained that NBC does not show events which "just
about every guy... wants to see more of," and that the networkfails to
cover the Olympics on multiple channels. However, events were shown
daily from noon to 2 a.m. across NBC, CNBC and MSNBC, including
baseball, boxing and judo (three of the more manly events in Chan's

opinion). Wrestling, another event that Chan would like to have
watched in the first three days, would not even begin until Day Nine
of the Olympics. Don't expect the TV to spoon-feed you, at least check

the schedules. Geez.
While Chan wants to see more "Americans beating the brains out
of a red commie devil," I personally thinkNBC is doing a much better
job covering the Olympics this year than at Atlanta. I have been happily surprised by the inclusion of events in which no Americans are
in contention for a medal.
As for Chan's particular choice of words, I sure hope he does not
carry the same view towards some of our international students.
My point? Well, it's pretty simple. Next time you attempt to reassert your masculinity, make sure you are not asserting your ignorance
instead.

PAN KURUBKIN

IN
PUBLIC
Dear Ralph,
You probably already know what this letter is about.
You've seen it coming, I know you have. It's about us, Ralph.
It's over. I'm leaving you.
I've hung on as long as I could, you've got to give me
credit for that. I mean, the way you swept me off my feet in
the sixties when you wrote "Unsafe at Any Speed" and led
the consumer safety fight for a generation
that counts
for a lot in my book. Every time the Swarthmore shuttle
backs up and makes that "beep beep" sound, I say to myself, "That's my Ralphie."
But that can only get you so far. Now that you've joined
the Green Party as their candidate for president, I'm a lot
at first I was ecmore skeptical. Don't get me wrong
static. Someone of conviction; a liberal candidate I wouldn't
be ashamed of; a true hero of the little man. But lately, I've
come to realize that what we have together just isn't working. To be honest, you're not that attractive.

First, there's the strategic voting angle. Everyone knows
you're not a real contender for the presidency, and outside
those cute liberal enclaves called universities, no one's really paying attention. In fact, The New York Times' article
about your exclusion from the debates this week was the
first time you received coverage from the Times in over a
month, if you don't count the campaign briefings. And
you're only scoring one to two percent in the polls. Still,
your name is on the ballot in most states, and in a race
where the candidates are running neck-and-neck, you have
the potential to influence the outcome.
Here's the scenario. Assume Gore and Bush are the only
ones with a real chance of being elected. Further, assume
that anyone who votes for you would still vote were you
not running. Finally, assume that anyone who would still
vote were you not running would vote for Gore. The result? Well, we can't mark a "second choice" on the ballot.
One vote for you equals one "vote" for Bush.
Your response to this has always been unapologetic: that

An open letter to Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader
it doesn't matter whetherBush wins or Gore wins; that they
would make equally bad presidents. But surely you exaggerate. In fact, I think there was less hyperbole in Al Gore taking credit for the creation of the Internet. With two or three
Supreme Court nominations due in the next term and a candidate (Bush) who defends his tax cut plan by saying "We've
got lots ofbillions to work with," my vote for you amounts to
no less than a vote against abortion rights and good fiscal

policy —just to name two examples.
All right, suppose strategic voting were to strike me as
too cynical. Maybe I want to send Al Gore and the Democratic Party a message of disapproval with my vote. IfI can
find a candidate whose goals and positions are actually similar to mine, he (or she) would get my vote. That is what voting is for, right?
But Ralph, you are not that perfect candidate that I dream
ofas I scowl at Al Gore.That's why I'm leaving you. Your stands
on the issues are just as absurd as supply-side economics and
just as incompatible with each other as is "compassionate"
with "conservatism." As Gail Collins wrote in her columnlast
month, "Mr. Nader is furious about campaign finance, along
with this is a very, very incomplete list the World Trade
Organization, [NAFTA], the death penalty, genetically engineered food, child poverty, the military budget, the Taft-Hartley
Act, tuition at public universities, the evening news's obsession with the weather, the ban on industrial hemp and the
fact that Al Gore didn't show up for the Farm Aid concert.
And there's no apparent priority to his outrage."
It's true. You are 66 years old, but you sound like you're
more concerned with shutting down the School of the Americas and freeing Tibet than pushing effective policy changes
thatcould make life a little better. You are a featured speaker
at the convention of the American Sociological Association,
but you also want to practice politics. I mean, isn't that a
little naive? There's a timeand a place for everything, Ralph.
For you? Wrong time. Wrong place.
Social Security: You say that there is no Social Security

crisis, that it is a myth thought up by the Democrats and
Republicans together just to scare senior citizens. While it
may be true that the money won't run out tomorrow, longterm demographic shifts are not a myth. You're out of the
ballpark on this one.
Foreign Affairs: You say you've got experience in this
field because you've studied Russian and Chinese and know
lots of world history. And "our government should side with
the peasants." The peasants?
Campaign Finance: You want public financing for all
campaigns, but that should include free TV time for all
"qualified candidates." Um, excuse me, but isn't that begging a question?
Trade: You're against free trade because you say ithurts

the environment and the interests of American workers.
But what about those peasants you were talking about?
Free trade can bring jobs to countries where employment

is like an oasis in the desert.
Ralph, in an interview with Jim Lehrer on the PBS
NewsHour this summer, you were asked whether you were
running on particular issues oran overall philosophy. You
said it was an overall philosophy. You were asked what,
specifically, you would do as president to govern in that
philosophy, and you said you would issue a proclamation
for a 'tieep democracy."
Proclamations for a deep democracy. Running on an
overall philosophy. Ideologues come in many disguises.
You know, I almost mistook that for, say, progressive
politics. Or populism. That's what I thought this love affair with you was all about, Ralph. But I was blinded by
you. You're not the man I thought you were, and I can't let
you take away my vote.
Good-bye, Ralph. Take good care of yourself. But please
don't call me, and please, please don't run for president
any more. It will only make things worse.
Yours,
Dan

THE PHOENIX

Living and arts coverage disappointing
Dear Editor:
Every Thursday last year, I would grab a
copy of The Phoenix and, like every other
newspaper I open, I would immediately turn
to the Living and Arts section. I am a reader

ofliving and arts sections. Sometimes they're
the only thing I read in a newspaper.
This semester, I read The Phoenix front
to back. As a Phoenix fan, I think that the
paper has greatly improved during my
time at Swat, and it still continues to improve. Everything except the Living and
Arts section.
I still open the paper immediately to
Living, but now I'm always disappointed.
This week is no exception to my utter frustration with the direction of that part of
the paper. The featured story, instead of
Catherine Osborne's extremely well-written book review, was about how to lose
weight from someone who obviously never
dealt with weight problems before. Two
more articles on dating to go along with
the Single in September story last week.
Frankly, I don't quite care about
everyone's dating issues at Swat.
And that's becoming my opinion about

w&

the Living section now I just don't care
about its content. It may be well written,
but that's about it.
When I open Living now, I wonder:
where is coverage of the Fringe Festival
in Philadelphia? Where is the interview

withPatrick Dougherty—an artist in residence, easily reachable because he's been
on campus for the last three weeks?
I guess the Living and Arts section is good
in that it makes me nostalgic for last year's
paper, where the interview with Claudia
Gonston of the Magnetic Fields, an appropriate story to be in Living, was thesection's
feature story. Then I could open up the paper and actually learn something about living and arts in Swarthmore and elsewhere.
I'm not criticizing merely to criticize. I
just know that the living and arts section
is something that is often not taken very
seriously. The Phoenix's Living section,
which used to be interesting and informative, is now turning very quickly into unreadable fluff. And it's really disappointing to see a living and arts section with a
lot of potential go to waste.

Smoking: relief for the socially inept or romanticized crutch?
Cigarette breaks a distinct social activity

Romantic image of smoking deceptive

BY JESSICA NAKAMURA

BY ERICA CARTMILL

My roommate gave me my birthday present early. She
tossed it to me, still in its store bag: a Zippo lighter.
In the two years since I started smoking, I have always
lusted over those shiny silver lighters that don't have any
awful, childproof junk on them. I've always been reluctant
to get one because I thought that would be the point when I
was too addicted. But the Zippo is appropriate now
I've
stopped fooling myself, because as much as I plan to quit
over the summer, fall break, the weekend, I know I won't.
There are too many fabulous things about smoking to stop
for those silly health reasons. Smoking is where it's at.
For one, it's a distinct social activity. Socially inept? Just
take up smoking. It allows for natural conversation pauses
that wouldotherwise be quite awkward. At any party, I have
the luxury of going out for a smoke when I see a guy I dated
walk into the room. It eliminates any awkward conversation that we would have to get into. I can avoid that awful
girl who was in my CA group because my cigarette smoke
disgusts her. Social smoking also works the other way. I've
had some of my best conversations at Swarthmore while
taking a cigarette break with someone.
But the most marvelous thing about smoking, the reason why I started and continue to smoke, is stress relief.
Coffee makes me jittery, then tired. Alcohol makes me do
regrettable things and then become tired. But that wonderful drug, nicotine, runs through my body and my work seems
so much more manageable. The best thing about my habit
is that I get to take smoking breaks and escape from a stressful situation for five minutes. When is the last time one of
you non-smokers took an intentional five-minute break in
the middle of writing a paper? It makes a world of differ-

It's James Dean on his motorcycle and the tragic heroine
bitterly reminiscing about a lost love. I find the cigarette
dangling from his mouth and lingering on her delicate fingers incredibly romantic. As a person with a penchant for
the dramatic, I will admit that smoking has a definite panache. Smoking can be sexy and glamorous. I know if I ever
started, it would quickly become a mainstay of my lifestyle.
Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs we know of, but
what is more frightening than any health statistic I could
quote is how severe the mental addiction can be.
The problem isn't that people are under-educated about

i

the risks of smoking; it's that smoking has been romanticized
in our culture and age group, a generation raised on individualism. Smoking has become a symbol of the rebel-artistintellectual, the art house "you don't understand me but you
want to" chick. We have grown up in the largest, most powerful country in the world during a timeof peace and economic
prosperity. We have no causes, nothing to rebel against. Our
generation has a need to be different, unique from the general
ambivalence of the masses sitting around sedately chewing
their cud, or their Wrigley's gum ("when you can't smoke...").
We can try to understand and psychologically profile the
youth in America, but the fact is that it's a travesty that in
this day and age, in a society and age group that is so focused on healthy living, teen smoking is on the rise. Most
adult smokers say that if they knew what we know now when
they started smoking, they would never have started. So why

Complaining: a Swarthmore way of life
And if we had not complained that having ice cream every day was not enough to satisfy our sweet tooth, we would
not have soft-serve frozen yogurt, that most necessary of
artificial, machine-dispensed, all-over-the-floor-getting luxu-

ries.
So complaint is good. But if we were really smart and
not philosophy majors, we would be coming up with solutions to the problems we see that don't involve the restoration of pineapple-orange-guava to its rightful place between
orange and apple juice on the right-hand fountain (the one
close to the small room, that horror of horrors).
No, instead we would be running for senior class officer
or president or general secretary or sahib. But completely
unfit for public office because of certain "youthful indiscretions" involving rubber gloves, a very slow chameleon, and
non-UL-listed Christmas tree lights, we resign ourselves to
Aubrey McFate and the shadows of power.
We complainers are the great men and, of course, the
great women. For we remember the famous statement that

behind every great man is a great woman, and behind every great woman is a great woman's rear. And we get a little
confused.
But it is we who disparage the new alignment of the condiment bar (and we do not laugh to discover that "condiment" sounds like the word "condom"), we who detest the
new, sleek, askew big-room set-up, and we who don't understand how they can remodel an entire building and only
put in one water fountain. We are helpless, useless and
thoughtless.

We have stepped up to the plate of life and been hit by a
pitch. And it hurt too much so we got a pinch runner. We

hate what we have chosen but would choose no other. We
know how many angels fit on the head of a pin, and we do
not care. We made the sound of one hand clapping, but it
sounded an awful lot like the Tomahawk Chop, so we were
offendedand stopped. We slept the sleep of the just but were
awoken by the Willets fire alarm.
Because we are, after all, Swarthmore students.

ARTS

THE GENESIS OF A NEST
And then God said, "Let there be saplings." But it took Patrick Dougherty's
vision to turn those saplings into a work of art on Swarthmore's campus.
BY KATE O'DONNELL
On the first day of the process way back in September, there was an unremarkable Linden tree on the south

side of Trotter. And we all knew vaguely about this tree,
and it was good. On the second day, there were lots of people
talking about the tree. They were interested in the tree, and
it was good. On the third day, these people collected saplings
from surrounding areas and piled them up around the tree, and
it was good. On the fourth day, they worked with the branches, and it was
good. On the fifth day, they also worked with the branches. Still good. On the
sixth day, scaffolding went up, and it was great. On the seventh day, Patrick
Dougherty and his team finished their creation, and it was strange. Goodness

gracious.
Yes, the totem-cocoon-womb-stick structure is strange. I mean, who thinks of
taking sticks, making four similar shapes out of them, balancing these on top of
each other, tilted on an angle, leaning them against the tree, incorporating, at
points, the branches of the tree into the top nest shapes, and then calling it art?
Well, clearly Patrick Dougherty does.
This wasn't always the case, however. When he was first at art school, having
decided to drop his career in medicine in favor of one in the arts, Dougherty was
a self-confessed art nerd, asking incessantly, "Is this art? Is this art?" It was only
when someone told him he that he should "go in there and do what you want.
Who's going to know the difference in twenty years anyway?" that he finally
accepted responsibility for his own, personal aesthetic.
It took a while to figure out what that was, though. He thought, "all the good
ideas are used up... they've exploited every material...You know, there's really
too many of u5..." and so on. It was only once he decided that "the art world was
just gonna have to lump it" that his aesthetic materialized. This translated into
a form of earth art, in which Dougherty manipulates the cooperative forces of
nature and form to extract a source of palpable energy.
And energy there is. I didn't feel it at first, but it's definitely there on that
lawn outsideof Trotter. It's in the arrangement of those malleable saplings, some
positioned horizontally, others arranged on a spiral. The precarious balancing
of the three other nests on top of the main bottom adds a further dynamic to the

arrangement.
The shape of the base nest alone is loaded with energy. The front of the bottom nest is open, tempting one to step inside the hollow, leaf-coated structure.
There, is, sadly, a sign that suggests that this is not a good idea. So, instead, light
plays teasingly inside. In addition to this frontal opening, there is an oval "window" in the back of the base construction, allowing more light to peek through.
If you look in the front and up through the back opening, it seems as if the nest is
framing a patch of the sky. Simultaneously, streaks of light filter through the
openings and ever so slightly through the woven branches, harmonizing the inside of the nest with the outside. In this context, the strange, somewhat gawky
arrangement becomes beautiful.
So it's a little odd and the construction itself isn't particularly aesthetically
pleasing, but the success of the concept is truly breathtaking. The idea of a temporary arrangement working on a structural level to delicately weave sticks
into a natural aesthetic that interacts both directly and indirectly with its surroundings with regard to people is innovative and refreshing. As Dougherty himself says, "It feels like you're stretching and having a good time." Forget the
formal analysis; that's what this ephemeral piece is. And it is good.

Rooms only students could love
BY JONAH GOLD
All of us, whether we are

first-years a month out of the
house or seniors who haven't

been home since last Christmas,
are in some respect wanderers.
Journey(wo)men, if you will.
See, we long ago left our old life,
whatever that may have been, to
begin with something different.
And lingering in the very backs
of our minds, whether or not we
realize it, whether or not it ever
existed, is a memory of that
home a stable environment in
which we lived, played, worked
and generally belonged. There's
no place like it. No place like
home.
But that doesn't mean we
can't try to recreate it. "Damn it,"
we think, as we collapse with our
heads down on the pillow, trying
desperately to catch a few proverbial z's, while our roommate
hunts and pecks out a soc-anth
paper. "Damn it, we can adapt to
this life.
Thankfully, we're right. It

just takes time. And that search
for the elusive element that

changes "any old place" to "my
place" continues, consciously or
unconsciously, through all four
long years of Swarthmore.
And no, that magical element
is not a pair of ruby slippers.
It all starts with the firstyears, entering here without a
clear knowledge of what "here"
constitutes. They come from a
place that is, by all definitions,
"home," to a place that is, by all
definitions, not
a small,

cramped room generally occupied
by someone whom they have never
met before. Someone whose per-

sonal habits and concepts of space
and time are alien to them. Someone who may or may not approve of
that Batman night-light. The end
result is not a conflict so much as a
split, with each side of the room reflecting its occupant's own first attempts at creating the fabled home
away from home. The first nonhome is, actually, half of a home.
For Kim Bussey 'O4, this halfhome is no substitute for her real
"home" by any stretch of the imagination. She does try to make it work,
though, by adorning the room with

concrete things, keepsakes, posters

and in her case, stuffed pigs. Even
the angle of her desk is set up explicitly to bring her 45 degrees closer
to home. "Just so I have a nice little
corner I can hide in," she says, by
way of explanation. Equal effort has
been made on the part of her roommate, Eleanor Kaufman, though it
is far less intentionaland produces
a slightly different effect; replacing
Kim's 'pig' motif with her own,
which involves a whole lot of orange. However, the end result is the
same. Both, in their decoration,
have the two-fold purpose of making their area reflect "themselves"
and recreating what came before
recreating "home." They have their
own respective space, and they're
individually doing, each what they
can with what they have. Even if it
is just a wall, a desk, and a shelf.
But, space-wise, better housing is
to come. As the fledgling first-years
develop, those lucky few who remain standing after two semesters

earn the privilege and the freedom
to choose, at least within collegeacceptable restrictions, the person
with whom they wish to live out
their sophomore year. Andfreedom
of choice generally translates into
more unity within a room —the two

halves merge into a whole which
allows sophomores the freedom to
rearrange.
Sophomores like David White-

head and Jason Kerensky have tinkered with their rooms, adding furniture and rearranging beds for optimum space rather than division of
space. The physicality reflects a
heightened sense of cooperation between roommates to make the room
a better place. In short, these rooms
come off more like oneroom for two
people, and less like two half-rooms
for two people. The problem of coexistence, one of the first big
changes made between college and
home life, is elegantly resolved in
the second year. Thi& feeling that
comes, of sharing a room rather
than dividing it, v> a huge step forward. Because now, at least, the
space is all yours, even if you are
sharing a room.
The nagging thought that Swat
is not home after all is slow to disappear. But it usually does. For most
part, at some point or another, it
happens. As time passes, older,
wiser Swatties, now living in luxu-

rious singles, reach spatial enlightenment with regard to their room.
The obvious reasons (e.g. having
four walls to yourself, not having to
worry about saving floor space from
your socks, shutting your door and
having it keep people out) all apply.
But there are other factors here,

mainly the passage of timeand the
fact that, inevitably, the concept of
home changes. Some, like Katie
Saltanovitz 'O2, no longer have their
own room in their old house. Others, because of summers spent
abroad or at work away from home,
simply just haven't been there in
such a long time that going home
again seems irrelevant anyhow.
Things vary from case to case. But
however it happens, there is, it
would seem, a time when itbecomes
obvious that Swat is where we belong, at least for the moment. It's an
almost Zen idea for some, as
Saltanovitz explains: "It's not something I think about very much. It's
just kind 0f... you know... I live
here."
And with this realization comes
a sort of freedom. Upperclassmen,
both juniors and seniors, often just
stop worrying all that much about
what their room looks like. This is,
of course, partially because ofother
pressing matters on their mind, like
graduate school, the job market and
other things that one cannot hang
on one's wall. But there is a deeper
point here, which is that they are
comfortable living at Swat, and at
the same time, they are ready to
move on. "I was tired of packing and
unpacking" says Young-Ai Lee 'Ol,
who lives in a comfortable, modestly
decorated room that looks less like
a college dorm than a room from a
house. The ability to deal in this way
with one's space, minus the baggage
of trying to make it something it's
not, may well be one of the top ten
warning signs of readiness for reality. And reality, lest we have forgotten, is a good thing.

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Those Swatties who are "in the
zone" with respect to their room
space, who are comfortable in
their rooms without caring about
it too much, have an amazing
kind of flexibility. "I feel at home
wherever my alarm clock and
brush are," says Annie Willman

'Ol This "home" is, for the moment, a Swat dormroom. But beyond that, it could mean pretty
much anywhere in the world.
When you're getting out within
the year, college starts to feel like
it doesn't need to be home in the
sense that "home" is home.
That definition of home, one
with 18 years of memories and
feelings attached to it, is well and
good, and should not under any

circumstances be forgotten, but
as we grow up (so to speak), a
new one is necessary: home is,
and always will be, wherever we
are comfortable being. For many,
that is not here. For some, it is
here and nowhereelse. For some,
it's anywhere.

The ability to adapt to most
any living environment is not by
any stretch of the mind unique
to Swat, but it does have a lot do

with a liberal arts education. Endurance, adaptability, and all
those other great things they advertised in the brochures exist
here not just in the classroom but
right in people's rooms. College
is a rite ofpassage, and the whole
"searching for a new home" idea
found in all good stories of maturation holds true here, as it, indeed, does anywhere. And like
these stories, one would hope, a
happy ending is in sight.

himself right back in the slammer,
this time sharing a cell with a more

intuitive thief than he is. His
cellmate, appropriately named
Jaster" (Robert Pastorelli), had been
the less elusive of a pair of hardcore
theiving murderers who attempted a
heist of the NationalTreasury. Aside
from their initial personality conflict,
the two men encounter other difficulties, including complications involving Jaster's health and some pretty
rank living conditions.
In a twisted attempt to locate the
mastermind behind the National
Treasury robbery, the chief investi"

gator (Doug Hutchinson) conjures up

an intricate, probably illegal, ploy
that involves using Sanders as bait

and releasing him from prison onto
the streets ofNYC with word that he

knows the location of the still-undis-

covered gold. To facilitate this arrangement, the investigator punches and
breaks Sanders' jaw, which he then replaces with a high-tech tracking device
that allows the FBI to monitor Sanders
around the clock, and will, hopefully,
lead them to Jaster's partner.
"Bait" is a somewhat confusing but
also entertaining, staggered trip
through the action and humor and
scheming involved in the government's
attempt to keep tabs on a con man and
to keep him out of jail and on the streets.
Unfortunately, their overestimation of
the power of Sanders' unbelievable stupidity and their underestimation of the
superior intelligence of the man they
are trying to locate prevent the immediate success of theirplan. Still, it leads
the government agents, and, consequently, viewers, through a hilarious
maze of close encounters and sexual
adventures, which, with a little monetary persuasion and a glimmer ofbrilliance on Alvin's part, subside long
enough for the cops to bag the crook and
Sanders to stabilize his life, relationship, and new parental role.
For the most part, "Bait" is a pretty
sorry film. The supporting cast is not
wonderful, with the exception of David
Morse, whose psychotic facial expressions lend themselves nicely to his role
as the perpetrator in hiding, and possibly Doug Hutchinson. The dialogue lags
and is centered unrealistically on Foxx's
quips and one-liners, indirectly subduing their comic effect. And the plot is,

Jamie Foxx in "Bait"

well, not great. How many escaped crook
comedies must we endure before their
directors realize they've worn out their
welcome?

In spite ofits numerous defects, "Bait"
was entertaining as long as Foxx was on
the screen. His talent carried the film and
will ultimately make the movie as it
creeps up the box office listings. Listless
as it was, "Bait" may have provided Foxx
with a necessary step in his acting career.
It seems his predecessors have each tolerated leading roles in similarly stifling
flicks ("Beverly Hills Cop," "Blue
Streak"), surprisingly without adversely
affecting their careers. Perhaps, then,
"Bait" wasn't entirely a waste of Jamie's
time. At least he's out there, his charmingly confounded face reflected on the
retinas of the public and his droll, but
equally dazed, wisecracks filling its ears,
resounding in their chuckles, their
giggles, theiruncontrollablelaughter and
fitting praise of Foxx's comic genius.

Java Joe's excellent for cheap, tasty brunch
I just can't get enough of this little
hole-in-the-wall dinercalled Java Joe's.
The name is generic, the location is
hardly high-profile,but I'm telling you,
the breakfast is out of this world.
I must have passed this place a million times without even noticing that
it existed. It is in the plaza right next
to Wawa on Fairview Road, the road
that leads to MacDadeBlvd. How many
times have I been to Wawa? And I had
no idea that this place existed until just
last semester when a friend, having
heardabout it from a friend ofa friend
of a friend, brought me there for Sunday brunch.
Java Joe's is a diner-style restau-

rant that successfully manages to be
all things to all people. I read in an ar-

ticle on the wall there that the owner
went to Philadelphia Restaurant

School and thenworked the high-class,
four-star restaurant scene before deciding to settle down with a place of his
own in the suburbs. Therefore, the
menu has both your typical diner
staples (like tuna melts and chef salads) and an extensive selection of specialty omelets, sandwiches, and entrees featuring ingredients like
smoked gouda cheese, sauteed spin-

ach, and Vermont rosemary ham. If
you're like me, a yuppie-in-training
who likes to rub elbows with the locals at the counter without neglecting
her taste for havarti dill, roasted red
pepperand egg beaters, why this place
is just seventh heaven. And if you're

not, you'll like it for your own reasons.
Despite its sophisticated offerings, Java
Joe's is surprisingly inexpensive. I regularly eat more than my fill from the menu
and have never spent more than ten dollars forbreakfast there (that was the day I
couldn't drcide between blueberry pancakes and the garden omelet). Usually I
spend about six or seven dollars (including tip). This may be an indulgence for
some, but for the occasional treat, Java

Joe's is well worth the expense. The portions are gigantic, the flavors are robust,
and the ambience is warm and unpreten-

tious.

So far, Java Joe's has been mostly a
weekend brunch kind of place for me. They
serve breakfast every day until 2:30 p.m.
(Sunday until 2p.m.). Or maybe I'll go one
morning during the week with a friend
who is visiting from out of town before I
have to ditch her to spend the rest of the
day in McCabe. Recently, however, something has come up that has forced me to
seriously reconsider this arrangement.
Last weekend I woke up at 8:30 on Saturday morning to meet with the professor
of a class thatI'll never beable to take again
if I drop it this semester. It's a workshop,
and the weekly assignments entail long
stretches of creative writing. The work is
rewarding and could even be fun, but other
classes always take priority.
I woke up ready to put my foot down
and tell this professor that I just don'thave
time to take her stinkin' class anymore and
nothing she can say will make me do it. I
must have fallen back asleep during the
meeting, though, because inside offifteen
minutes, I left having agreed to write for

herclass for a half-hour every day. A halfhour every day?! Never agree to meet anyone to discuss anything before noon on the
weekend, that's all I can say, because it's a
trick. I got seriously duped by this woman.
To console myself after this totally flabbergasting turn of events, I went to Java
Joe's and, over a Belgian waffle, tried to
locate that daily half-hour to writefor this
class. Does it hide behind lunchtime?Is it
squooshed between dance class and my
Tuesday night Paces shift?
Then suddenly it hit me: I woke up to
that half-hour this very morning when I
had to meet my teacher. In fact, I wake up
to that half-hour practically every morning. But then I whack the snooze button,
roll over and go back to sleep. What I need
is to get up every morning and take advantage of that half-hour there. But if
you're like me, that half-hour's got to have
some major incentive to beat out sleep (and
god knows a morning meeting will never
be incentive again). What's something
about ahalf-hour every morning that I just
can't get enough of? You got it. It's Java
Joe's.
A cup ofcoffee at the counter, an omelette, a notebook, and me: that's my recipe
for success. In the interest of my growth
as a writer, artist, and student, I now go to
Java Joe's for a half-hour every morning
to stimulate my senses and write for my
workshop. My studies demand it. I could
never expect the same commitment from
you, dear reader, but perhaps this article
will inspire you to rethink your priorities.
Even better, think about them over a Spanish omelet and homefries at Java Joe's this
Sunday morning.

Sex is fun. Pregnancy is
NOT. At least not for another ten years it isn't.
The most controversial
issue in America these
days is abortion, and it's
difficult to delve into it
without offending someone. Ideologically, I'm going to tsKe as mucn a stano.
on the issue as your traditional moderate, waffling
more than Sunday morning at an InternationalHouse
of Pancakes.
Nevertheless, the FDA's recent approval of RU-486
is an issue that is important to deal with. It's relevant
to almost all of us, and not too many people know all
that much about it. One person I know called it "RD-40"
the other day. Another person I talked to told me it
wasn't a good idea to run Windows 2000 on a 486 processor.
Named Mifeprex by some marketing "genius," the
drug terminates pregnancies of up to 49 days. The drug
interferes with the flow ofblood and nutrition from the
wall of the uterus to the growing fetus. Without this
support, the fetus dies, and the pregnancy is aborted.
Okay, now you know what RU-486 is supposed to do
medically. More importantly, let's explore what it does
to the abortion debate. The truth is, I trust the FDA about
as much as the Somalia Board ofFood and Sewers. And
I have about as much faith in Western medicine as I do
in a pre-Copernican view of the universe. This is hardly
an oops-the-condom-broke morning-after pill; it's something with serious emotional and physical ramifications
to consider.
That said, you might be wondering if using RU-486
will cause any future children to be hideously deformed
or physically harm women who use the drug. The answers respectively (and unfortunately) are inconclusive
and maybe. There's no conclusive long-term data on RU486's effects. The short-term side effects are potential
cramping and bleeding. In about one out of 100 women,
however, bleeding can be so severe that a surgical procedure will be required to stop it (Ugh, so much for this
chips and salsa dinner I was eating). Also, the drug succeeds in only 92 percent to 96 percent of cases, so a surgical abortion may be required anyhow. Both those numbers sound a lot like playing Russian roulette with your
body to me.
A strange misconception is that Mifeprex is going to

be something sitting next to the Metamucil and dental
dams at Osco. One of my friends recently said, "Well, if
they approve it, it'll be much better. Girls won't have to
go into the clinic and deal with all that stuff."
That will hardly be the case. Mifeprex will be available only through prescription or the black market.
So, unless couples are going to buy the pills from a
guy's jacket in West Philly, permission from a doctor
is required to get RU-486. And it isn't exactly your
friendly podiatrist who can prescribe it either.
Mifeprex will only be distributed to physicians who
can determine the duration of a patient's pregnancy,
detect an ectopic pregnancy and provide surgical interventions in case things go sour. So basically, it's
going to involve, for the most part, the same clinic visits which are traditionally extremely difficult on
women.
Also, to answer the question men probably most have
on their minds, an RU-486 abortion will cost about the
same as a surgical one.
Another thing that sounds awfully unpleasant and
makes me rather happy to be male is the fact that in a
Mifeprex abortion, the woman "handles" the fetus herself, as opposed to a doctor handling it in a surgical procedure. That is, the fetus isn't surgically removed, so
the body must handle the removal of the fetus from the
body. Oog, enough of that. If you want to learn more
about it, look it up on the Web.
Well, I hope the slightest potential of humor convinced you regardless of your sex or ideology to read
this article and learn something about Mifeprex. I had
about as much fun writing this piece as I would sleeping on a bed of rusty nails, but these facts are important for everyone to know about.

TOWN

Small, independent towns are nearing extinction in America. The
Borough of Swarthmore is no exception. Does the ville already have
one foot in the grave, or can business owners and borough officials
adapt the ville to meet changing economic and social demands?

STORY

BY BRENDAN

KARCH

This past Saturday, during the Swarthmore Fall Festival,
the ville pretended for a day to be a small town. Cars were
banned from the downtown area and retail shops spilled their
goods onto the dilapidated sidewalks. Antique dealers, raffle draw-

ings, bake sales and a big bouncy tent fun for all ages. Popcorn popped,
lunchtime snacks sold like hotcakes, and the music blared like a good
dose ofProzac: Celllll-E-Brate Good Times, C'mon. Residents came to chit, to
chat, or to appease their restless children with candy.
-

JustinKane Phoenix Staff

Swarthmore Music owner Albert Bein

Everyone reveled in the small-town spirit that sunny day, but no one seemed to notice the
irony. It is anything but good times for the ville. Just hours after the festival ended, Sugarplums closed its doors for the final time. Offices are increasingly taking over spaces vacated
by retail stores. With shopping options galore a mile down Route 320 in either direction, the
ville has suffered an identity crisis.
A 34-point revitalization plan, drafted last year, is supposed to resolve the crisis. Despite
this plan, the ville continues to resist playing to many of its strengths. It resists fashioning
itself as a trendy spot for Main Line inhabitants, and it resists catering to college students.
What most people realize, but some refuse to admit, is that the ville is not a small town. It
is an out-of-the-way enclave in a suburban landscape; it is an anemic shopping district without consistent appeal; and it is a struggling retail zone adjacent to a college that makes up
nearly one-fourth of the borough's population.
Downtown Swarthmore has huge obstacles to overcome, obstacles that require deeper solutions than a hotel or a new Co-op. The revitalization plan states the ville's weaknesses, but
it doesn't state just how ingrained these weaknesses are. They are as much a part ofSwarthmore
as Michael's or the Co-op. And more often than not, they have to do less with economic issues
and more with the spirit of the ville.

THE VILLE'S BUSINESS WOES
The ville has two main types of businesses. Neither type is hugely successful.

The first is what could be classified as essential goods and services. The hardware store,

Michael's and the Co-op are the three anchors of this type of retail. According to a statistical
report from January 1999, these types of stores make up. a large portion of the ville. However,
their customer base has been sharply cut by the presence ofoutside businesses. The Co-op, for
example, only makes up 25 percent of Swarthinore's grocery purchases; in other words, for
every person who shops at the Co-op, three more shop at Genuardi's or elsewhere. With
Michael'sPharmacy, the number is even lower: Nineteen of every twenty drugstore purchases

by residents are made outside the ville.

GHOST TOWN
OUTSIDE RENATO'S
PARK AVENUE
Parking is one of the myriad
problems the borough has
addressed in its revitalization
plan. While they are interested
in making parking more
available for shoppers, the
main concern is making sure
residents are guaranteed
parking in the face of more
customers. The parking
renovation proposal calls for
the addition of parking spaces
on both sides of Park Avenue.

Justin Kane Phoenix Staff

From GHOST TOWN, pg. IS

As Scott Richardson, owner of the small
restaurant and catering business Occasionally Yours noted, "A tremendous number of
people that live in this town don't shop here."
The economic sustainability of such stores
in the face ofintense competition is doubtful.
The revitalization plan, however, stresses the
importance of maintaining businesses despite
their cloudy future. Of the 34 proposals in the
revitalization plan, two call for reconstruction
of the Co-op and expansion of the hardware
store. But in maintaining such businesses, the
borough may be promoting a self-image more
than promoting a vibrant town.
"There seems to be a lack of understanding
about the way people live their lives now," said
one ville resident of five years. He questions
the desire to support what he calls "bad business" such as the hardware store, which offers
limited supply and an intimidating, disheveled
retail space. "It's a simple business plan," he
said. "It's called give people what they want."
So if three out offour people don't want to
shop at the Co-op, why is there, as Swarthmore
Borough Manager Jane Billings stated, a "tremendous interest in having them stay?" Convenience is one reason, especially for
Swarthmore's elderly, who seem to hold a
large sway in determining town interests. But
even for those who don't shop at the Co-op,
the idea of the store is a positive one. What
small town, after all, doesn't have a small-scale
supermarket?
Of course, borough

residents imagining a
small-town atmosphere and supporting a
small-town atmosphere are totally different
activities. "To keep the homey atmosphere,"
said Cricket Way Ltd. owner C.W Smith, "a
lot of them need to remember to support those
homey businesses."
The other type ofbusiness that can be said
to contribute to that homey atmosphere is the
small specialty store. Finlandia, The Studio,
Poco Loco, The Cheese Court, T. Bumble's and
Cricket Way Ltd. line the sidewalks of the
downtown area. Their themes are varied, and
each has a different target customer in mind.
T. Bumble's sells non-violent and non-batteryoperated toys, while Poco Loco primarily sells
clothes for professional women. "I appeal to a
different palate," said Cheese Court owner
Nancy Miller said. Smith defined his product
by personal taste: "I sell what I like."
Most businesses operate in very small
spaces, with low overhead, and most make
small profits. If none draw huge business, then

exactly how do these stores contribute to the
downtownarea? Onecould say that such stores
are by the community and for the community,

but neither claim holds up in the face of reality. Many—if not most —of the specialty shop
owners don't live in Swarthmore. And while
borough residents number more than 5.000.
they fall short of makmg a customer base
"There isn't enough here to support a business," Miller said. "You have to be aggressive."
For most business owners, being aggressive is a relative term. For the most part, specialty shops rely on a small group of repeat
customers, some of whom live nowhere near
Swarthmore, to turn a profit. Courting these
customers is often a matter of word ofmouth.
Thus, Swarthmore's business district gets
very little publicity. For most outsiders who
visit here, the ville is likely the home of one
specific store they frequent rather than several stores they browse. Complicating this
problem are the disparities in target customer: From Finland-phile to cheese connoisseur to conscientious parent, the customer
bases rarely overlap.
The revitalization plan sees little way
around this problem. Sure, the borough can
promote pedestrian traffic, fix sidewalks and
encourage a business association, but they
can't force owners to sell different items. Especially since so many stores sell what they want,
justas much as what the customer wants. Thus,
even if the borough can do little, the invisible
hand of capitalism can do even less. In
Swarthmore, supply determines demand. In
Swarthmore, the customer isn't always right.
Profit-drivenbusinesses are obviously the
answer, but telling that to borough residents
is like telling saying their well-manicured
lawns will be paved over with asphalt. Even
local business owners are skeptical.
"I don't know if slick goes over big here,"
Miller said. "You want things to be profitdriven, to an extent." But ville residents, as
well as owners, have other priorities in mind
too, like nice business owners. Where else, one
resident noted, can you still run a tab at a
store?

"There's a lot that's good about this business community," Miller said.
The bad thing is, vibrancy isn't one of
them.

GHOST

TOWN

The Phoenix asked six random
students "What must the ville do
to make you interested in
shopping or hanging out there?"
Here are their responses:

ing garage

is one of the main features of
the revitalization plan. It's not hard to see
why: The combined floor space of
Swarthmore's businesses isabouthalf the size
of a Home Depot. With residential neighborhoods surrounding the ville on three sides,
it's no wonder the borough looks to college
property with eager eyes.
There is little doubt that a hotel will change
the feel of the town. Bill Pastuzek, local real
estate broker and a member of the revitalization committee, said the new space, if approved, "is going to make the business center
beautiful."
But shifting the center of town to college
property, and across a busy street, may not
be good for the existing ville. "I don't see how
it's going to increase business," said Pastuzek,
who owns about one-sixth of the downtown
commercial property. He questioned what
would happen to retail space on the downtown
side of Route 320 if businesses move into new
spaces on the college side. "There's limited
inquiry for space in the business district," he
said. "What you see here now is, apparently,
what the community needs."
Whether or not the community wants more
space is a hard theory to test. The existing

"I feel that even if
they had stuff, the
fact that people

downtown architecture, most of it pre-World
War 11, is not conducive to remodeling. The
current configuration allows for mostly narrow storefronts with no more than 3,000 total
square feet, about the size of a middle-class
home. "The spaces are
way too small for
the way most people retail," borough manager
Jane Billings said.
The only way to create more flexible retail
spaces would be to create newer buildings.
However, don't expect that to happen anytime
soon; not only is it "economically unfeasible,"

"The most attractive
place is when it
feels like it's being
run by young people
so you can feel more
at ease; the ville has
a really old feel to it
I think a cafe is
probably a good
idea if it's something
that's open late."

Tony Carter-Piff 'O3

Olivia Gruber 'O3

"Not get rid of places
like Sugarplums
that was somewhere
in the ville where we
could eat and hang
out. Now why would
we go down there
except to get Chinese
food, which we can
have brought to our
rooms anyway?"

...

...

according to Pastuzek, but it would conflict
with one of the objectives of the revitalization
plan: "to build upon the attractive and historic
architecture ofmuch of the town center."
There are at least four possible ways to create more space. The new hotel on college property is the mostpopular proposal. But another
proposal, which already has $850,000 in state
funds to its name, is the extension of Lafayette
Avenue. The road runs along the fire station
and terminates at the Co-op; extending it to
Myers Avenue, which runs along the train
tracks, would make a square block out ofwhat
is now two streets. The new street would not
only create more street frontage but also improve traffic and pedestrian circulation.
But the street would only be about 150 feet
long, and much of that frontage would go to a
new Co-op. Substantial additions would have
to come from substantial expansion. But, according to Lisa Aaron, the head of the borough
Planning & Zoning Committee, no one wants
the ville to encroach on the surrounding residential area. "No one is going to agree to have

said Aaron. "The challenge is to make really
good use of that space" that already exists.
In the quest for space; this is where things
get fuzzy. One of the things the revitalization
plan avoids mentioning is just how much nonretail there is in the ville right now. Storefronts are becoming offices, but it goes fur-

T. BUMBLES
Gail Gaustad, owner of the specialty toy store T. Bumble's, has been in
business 12 years. She manages to run a profitable store while
limiting product selection to non-violent and non-battery operated toys.
But, like most business owners, she is concerned with the obstacles to
change. "So many people want things just the way they are."
that seem like retailbusinesses don't actually
rely on traditional walk-in traffic. Occasionally Yours does about 70 to 75 percent of its
business in catering. Residents rave about the
hardware store's service but rarely about its
selection. Park Avenue Travel gets practically
no business from pedestrians. And Cricket
Way Ltd. owner C.W. Smith does 70 percent of
his business online, on eßay.
These stores pose a problem because walkin business is what brings people to the ville.
And a populated ville is one step closer to a
vibrant ville. But in a struggling downtown,
these companies are often more successful
than their neighbors, which raises a question:
can Swarthmore privilege shopping-type busi-

ness over service-oriented businesses, even if
it means shutting out a successful component
of the downtownarea?
With space so slim, Swarthmore may have
to. But that time is still years, if not decades,
away. For now, demandfor space is so low that
it is doubtful anyone will be driven out of

rental space by a higher bidder. For
rent prices to increase, demand
must rise. But for demand to rise,
there must be incentive to move into
the ville.
Thus, reviving the ville rests
squarely on the shoulders of borough council and borough residents,
for better or for worse. Revitalizing
the ville, as Billings said, "is more
than just new sidewalks or lighting."
It involves assessing the spirit of the
town and weighing it against economic reality.
It involves making the choice
between a ghost town and a vibrant
town. The ville is already a specter
of its former self. Right now, the
cards are stacked against it, and
even with the revitalization plan,
there are obstacles —both economic
and moral that cast a thick net of
doubt over its future.

THE CO-OP
The Co-op is the largest retail space in the
Ville and accounts for the most sales. But,
as a business hurt by the encroachment of
area supermarkets, the Co-op's economic
future is less than secure. The
revitalization plan hopes to secure a new
home for the Co-op.

Doubters fuel Corso's fire
From CORSO, pg. 24
The athletic department recognized
Corso's efforts last year by awarding
him the prestigious Dunn Trophy,
which recognizes the sophomore athlete who has contributed the most to
the athletic program.
"[The trophy] was totally unexpected," says Corso. "It felt good,
though, like a pat on the back that says
you're doing well. Sometimes it
doesn't feel like you have the greater
part of the community behind you, and
you appreciate when someone recognizes your efforts."
Motivation and determination
Occasionally, you might suffer a
bout of temporary insanity or insomnia and wander down to the weight
room for an 8 a.m. workout. Well, if
you did, you'd probably find Joe Corso
there, already stretched out and half
an hour into an intense morning liftand-run session.
Playing collegiate football is a fulltime, year-round job. A typical day for
Corso starts at 7 a.m., when he rolls
out of bed and goes down to the gym
for an hour and a half of intense
weight training before class. Practice
goes from 3:30 p.m. to about 7 p.m.,
whether itbe baseball or football. And
then it's time to tackle the stiff academic load that Swarthmore never
fails to deliver.
"Without a doubt, academics are
your No. 1 priority," says Corso, an
economics major. "Any kid on any
team would tell you that."
All of it is draining. Two intense
workouts, classes and staying up late
to finish homework takes a lot out of
you physically and mentally. And
Corso has been a major contributor to
teams that have certainly taken their
share of lumps.
"Being an athlete here is a challenge," he says. "You don't win a lot,

and as hard as you work, people don't
respect you. I mean, it's socially acceptable to call someone a 'dumb jock' here,
and it makes you scared to raise your
hand in class and say something wrong
because you don't want reinforce that
stereotype. They think the only reason
you're here is because you can block or

petitive fire," said Scott Kushner 'O2,
Corso's baseball teammate. "Joe has a
competitive inferno."
"In everything I do, I'm goal-oriented,"
says Corso. "When I decided to play football, I decided I wanted to be an integral
part of getting things on the right track,
of turning things around in the win-loss
column. To me, that commitment meant
doing whatever it takes and overcoming

have questioned whether he can play at
the next level despite the fact that he's

tackle and that's not true at all."
In addition to athletics, Corso is committed to getting everything he can out
of Swarthmore academically and building a foundation for a strong professional
career. He's spent the last two summers
working in trading at Merrill Lynch.
Each day he would get on the bus from
his home in Paramus, N.J. to travel into
the heart of New York at 5:30 a.m., and
he wouldn't return until 6:30 p.m. When
Corso got off the bus, the first thing he'd
do wouldbe to go to the gym to make sure
his work in the winter and spring wasn't
wasted and his falls would be worthwhile. For his career and his team, Corso
sacrificed much ofhis summer, with free
time rarely other than on weekends.
"There were a lot of times when I
knew I couldn't do it as I was getting off
the bus. But in the time I walked from
the bus to the parking lot, I'd change my
mind," says Corso. "The whole summer
made me feel older, but I knew it would
pay off in the fall."
Overcoming obstacles
Those who know Corso will tell you
he is as intense and focused as anyone
you'll ever meet.
"Some people have that spark or com-

Pop Warner through college.
The skeptics add fuel to Corso's fire.
"It gives me that extra motivation to go
on when I'm tired and don't want to do it
anymore," he says. "It makes me wantto
get faster, to get stronger and stronger
when someone says I'm not fast enough.
It makes me want to do better in class
when someone thinks I can't."

These are some of the lessons Corso
has gleaned from his athletic experience.
"I'm going to apply this focus to the
world, to whateverI do, my job, my family
and I think it will help me succeed," he
said. "Focus, teamwork, these are thekinds
of things you learn from playing sports."
For Corso, a lucrative career in the

business world no doubt awaits him with
his sort of drive and attitude. But for now,
he's just living it up, enjoying what he's
doing. "I get to play two sports at a collegiate level," he said. "When I told the
people I worked withthis summer, I could
see a twinkle in their eye. Those guys
would give anything to be doing that. It
really made me appreciate what I have."
Suffice it to say, Garnet sports fans and
Corso's teammate's and coaches also appreciate what they have. Perhaps
Kushner sums it up best: "I'm lucky to
have Joe Corso as a teammate."

BRIEFS
Reddy smashes her
way to nationals
While the fall season is short in length, it's hardly
been short on accomplishment for the Swarthmore
women's tennis team. After winning their own invitational tournament and cruising to an easy dual
meet victory over West Chester earlier in the season, the Garnet traveled to Mary Washington College and made an extremely strong showing at
regionals. The team was led by first-year star Anjani
Reddy 'O4, who surprised a lot of prognosticators by
winning the entire tournament and earning a spot
in the national tournament.
The regional tournament consisted of two 64woman brackets: the A and the B pool. Reddy and
Jen Pao 'Ol represented Swarthmore in the A pool.
Both rolled through their early matches, securing
spots in the semifinals, where they faced each other.
Despite apprehensions about facing her teammate, Reddy defeated Pao by a 6-4, 6-2 score.
"It was tough facing Jen, especially since she'd
been helping me out and giving me advice the whole
tournament and all through the fall," said Reddy. Pao
bounced back to place third overall in the tournament.
Reddy's victory set her up for a finals match with
Lea Shon, the top seed from host Mary Washington
College. After splitting the first two sets with Shon,
Reddy stayed at the baseline and blasted shots by
Shon to secure an exciting 6-4,3-6,6-3 win.
"I was pretty surprised," said Reddy, "I just
wanted to have fun. I'm proud of myself. I went, had
a good time and played well, and that's what it's all

about."

The win qualifies Reddy for the Rolex National
Small College Championships, presented by the
USTA, at The Racquet Club in Memphis, Tenn. from
October 19-22. The tournament features the top players from NCAA Divisions II and 111, NAIA and the
junior college ranks battling it out to determine the
top small-college players in the nation.

Rugby 2-1 on season
The women's rugby team captured its second victory of the season, defeatingBucknell 17-3. Swat came
out strong from the beginning, keeping Bucknell on
the defensive and always a hair's breadth away from
the try line. The first points of the game came from a
penalty kick by Sarah Nusser 'O2, when she sent the
ball through the middle of the uprights. Soon after,

Swarthmore scored again. On a scrum-down five
meters from the try line, Swarthmore fly-half Cathy
Vaughn 'Ol made a fake worthy of an Oscar nomination before passing the ball back inside to Nancy
Craig 'Ol Craig muscled into the try zone. The golden
foot of Nusser converted for two.
In the second half, Elizabeth Meehan 'Ol added a
second stunning try to the scoreboard and Nusser
again converted the try. She responded to her kicking success with a shrug. "It's getting boring. I'd
rather be scoring tries."
The spirit of rugby shone through in Abigail
Stewart-Teitelbaum 'ol's heroic effort in playing for
the entire game despite a broken hand. Her heart
certainly helped pull in the victory.
Swarthmore's last two wins have secured the
team's spot in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union
playoffs at the end of the season.
The B-side also had a great game, despite what
the scoreboard said. Captain Joan Javier 'O3 gained
impressive amounts of ground with her breakaway
runs. Rookie Nicole Brunda 'O4 came through repeatedly with amazing tackles. At one point, she followed
the opposition into the try zone, sliding her hands
under the ball to prevent a try. In the final minutes
of the game, Meg Brennan 'OO and Payal Shah 'O3 also
stopped the opposing team from scoring by chasing
them into the try zone and diving onto the girl with
the ball. This final moment epitomized the spirit of
the two games
teammates working together for
an effective play.

Solid first half deteriorates into 34-13 loss to Bears
BY JUSTIN KANE
The Garnet Tide learned an

important lesson this past Saturday: when a game starts to unravel, it unravels quickly.
After playing the Ursinus
Bears to a 13-13 tie for over 40
minutes at Clothier Field, 10 minutes at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the
fourth proved the Tide's undoing.
Swarthmore came out strong
in the third quarter, stringing
together a 10-play scoring drive

late in the quarter that ended
withfullback Lane Oatey 'O3 diving into the end zone from one
yard out. Just two plays later,
however, Ursinus running back
Shearrod Duncan broke a 50yard run down the sideline, putting the Bears in position to score
on the next play. The run, which
was Ursinus's first offensive play
to go for more than 20 yards,
opened the gate for an explosive
Ursinus team to put 14 more unanswered points on the board.
On the Bears' nextpossession,
a flustered Swarthmore defense
turned a routine screen play into

a 69-yard touchdown reception by
Ursinus running back Josh Barr.
Barr, who caught the ball at the
Ursinus 31-yard line, broke four
tackles on his way to the end zone.
The game was still in reach for
Swarthmore, and the offense
seemed determined to stay in the
game, moving the ball 61 yards in
five minutes with short, effective
passes. Just as the Tide seemed
poised to score, however, Ursinus
defensive end Joe Conte put the
game out ofreach.

Racing around the right tackle,
Conte slammedinto Garnet quarterback Scott Murray 'Ol just as
Murray was cocking his arm to
throw. The impact jarred the ball
loose, and Ursinus linebacker Mark
Hineman picked up the fumble and
raced 78 yards for a touchdown to
kill Swarthmore's comeback hopes
and cap the scoring at 34-13.
"They made a few big plays, and
those buried us," said Garnet linebacker Joe Corso 'O2, who recorded
eight tackles, a sack and an interception. "It wasn't a snowball effect
we just had some bad breaks."
Despite losing control of the
game in the final quarters, the Garnet Tide played even with an

Wide receiver Matt Williams 'O4
snagged a 20-yard touchdown pass
from Murray in the first quarter to
put the Tide on the board first. Although the offense had trouble moving the ball, the defense effectively
shut down a highly-regarded

"We should have scored more
points in the first half," said Murray,
who threw for 151 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. "We
shot ourselves in the foot with penalties and too many interceptions."
"We just have to put more complete games together," Corso said.
"Once we can do that, the wins are
going to come."

Well, this concludes the eighty-first consecutive season

Fortier named Centennial Garnet rally falls short
against Ursinus
Player of the Week
With two consecutive shutouts under its belt and E.B.
Fortier 'O3 recently named Player of the Week in the Centennial Conference, a psyched-up women's soccer team
will take on Western Maryland today.
"The two victories have put us in a winning mood
and we're planning to act on that," said Emily Rhoades
'O4. The Garnet Tide, 3-1 in the Centennial Conference
and 4-5 overall, will face Western Maryland at home at 4
p.m.

"It's time to step up the game to a new level," said
head coach Amy Brunner. The Garnet Tide swept by Bryn
Mawr 3-0 on Monday to secure its first conference win.
Claire Hoverman 'O3 scored the first goal on an assist
from Fortier. JackieKahn 'O4 scored the second goal, also
assisted by Fortier. The final goal was scored by Katey
MacCaffrey 'O4 when she curved her corner kick beyond
the reach of the Bryn Mawr goalie.
"She got a well-deserved goal," said Brunner of
MacCaffrey, who scored the first goal in her college career. "She's been playing well for us all throughout the
season so it's great to see her score."
On Thursday, Swarthmoreblanked 4-0. Fortier began
the scoring with a goal assisted by Hoverman.
Thirty minutes later, she was back in the box, scoring her second goal of the game and ending the first half
at 2-0. Hoverman also scored, assisted by Rhoades.
Brainard finished off the game on a sweet note with her
final goal.
"Everybody on the team got to see some action and
try some fun and exciting plays," said Brunner.

The men's soccer team is focusing on forming a
solid foundation. "Our young players are making big
and needed contributions to the team,"said co-captain
Cam MacDearmid 'O3.
Against Ursinus on Wednesday, September 27, Swat
had its perseverance tested. The muddy field at Ursinus
made it difficult for Swat both to move offensively and
defend effectively. Down by three after the first half,
the Tide picked up intensity as the second half began.
"Our counter-offensive was swift in the second
half," said Kevin Pastor 'O4.
Co-captain Francisco Sersale di Cerisano 'O2 scored
a goal in the first minutes, followed by Frank Yeo 'Ol,
who headed in a rebound that had bounced off the
crossbar.
With Swat within one goal of a tie, Ursinus broke
out of its offensive slump and scored again.
Yeo was not finished for the day; he scored a stunning goal on a bicycle kick, bringing Swat back into
attack mode.
However, Ursinus scored one more goal near the
end of the game, leaving Swat two goals behind at the
finish, 5-3.
On Saturday, the Tide came up empty-handed
against Dickinson, 1-0, losing by one goal in overtime.
Although the team created many scoring chances, especially in the first half, none of them succeeded.
Dickinson scored a soft goal to end the game in overtime. The men's soccer team is 0-4 in the Centennial
Conference and 2-6 overall.

National League Most Valuable Player
Winner: Jeff Kent, San Francisco Giants
Runner-up: Barry Bonds, San Francisco Giants
What do you get when the two most valuable players are
on your team?The best team in baseball. And that's what
the Giants were in this year's renaissance of Bay Area ball,
which I'm sure Scott Kushner will remind me of for the next
year. Kent gets the nod over Bonds because he produced
unheard-of power numbers from 2B and I believe in sharing
the wealth a bit. After all, Barry's already got three MVPs.

AL Cy Young
Winner: Pedro Martinez, Boston Red Sox
Somewhere in the far, far, far distance: Tim Hudson,
Oakland Athletics
The people who want to give this award for the best
pitching to Hudson or David Wells just want to play idiot's
advocate. Martinez was 18-6 with a 174 Earned Run Average.
174!?! That's lower than Bill Clinton's standards. If Martinez
played for Toronto or Oakland, he would have gotten more
run support and been 23-2 or 24-1
NL Cy Young
Winner: Robb Nen, San Francisco Giants
Runner-up: Randy Johnson, Arizona Diamondbacks
Despite a massive el foldo down the stretch, Johnson was
the most dominating starting pitcher in the National League.
I think the people who dole out these awards will give it to
Johnson, but I want to make a case for Nen. Nen was 4-3,
with 41 saves, a 150 ERA and 92 strikeouts in 66 innings. To
me, those numbers put him on par with Johnson statistically.
But Nen was extremely strong in the second half of the
season (he gave up 3 runs in 312 innings), while Johnson
and his D-backs went in the tank.
More Awards...
AL Rookie of the Year: Kazuhiro Sasaki, Seattle Mariners.
An incredibly valuable reliever, though stretching the definition
of rookie at the age of 32. This guy telling you he's a rookie is
like your girlfriend saying, "Oh, of course you're the first."
NL Rookie of the Year: Rick Ankiel, St. Louis Cardinals. A
twenty-year-old lefty who's got curves like Laetitia Casta.
Best Game of the Year: Roger Clemens versus Martinez in
Yankee Stadium. Sox win on a ninth-inning homer by Trot
Nixon. A classic.
Most Disappointing Team: Houston Astros. Even worse
than Jurassic Park 2. Okay, maybe that's not possible.
Team with Least Class: Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Well, at
least the team reflects the character of the city.
Most Disappointing Player: Jose Offerman, Boston Red
Sox. When the Red Sox signed him to hit first in the batting
order, he'd come off a .315 season with 45 stolen bases.
This year he hit .251 and didn't steal ONE base in 116
games. NOT ONE?!! Cecil Fielder had an ass the size of the
Titanic and walked faster than he ran but he could
accidentally steal a base.
Most Annoying: Albert Belle.* Recently compared himself

anything relating to a virgin.

Assorted thoughts
from the sickbed
It is far too early in the year for me to have a little
brown envelope from Worth chock full of scarylooking pills with unknown side effects. But like half
of the campus, I have been fighting off illness (Don't
worry, fellow invalids, the other half will be sick after

break).
Anyway, the point is that my struggle to combat
fatigue and disease has forced me to look at where
my life is headed. OK, OK, I'm being a bit dramatic, I
only have a sinus infection but I definitely have had
to pull myself out of this pit of complacency.
We've all settled down into our routine, plugging
away at problem sets and papers. But then you turn
to the next page of the syllabus and discover that you
have a 10-page paper (the one you forgot about) due
in a week that requires, at the very least, six hours
photocopyingjoumals in Cornell. Hello midterms.
Suddenly you realize that the season is half over
and playoffs are looming. It is time to get down to
business. We must combat complacency and rise up
to educate and fight! Some thoughts to help get you
started in this quest for spirit:
■ First of all, men, I have to address the fashion
side of sports. I know you love that grubby Eagles
shirt and feel compelled to wear it every day, but tshirts are not substitutes for normal wear. They are
for sports and casual Fridays, but please attempt to
look decent during non-sporting hours. T-shirts also
were never meant to be tucked in. Ever.
■ As pleasant as the thought of attempting to
round out my diet by exploring more vegan options
was on Monday morning, by the time I actually got
into the main serving area in Sharpies on "Vegan
Night," I purposefully ate meat to protest the absurd
and offensive animal rights propaganda. Lots of

chicken and beef. And yes, my food does have a
face, and I don't care it was scrumptious.
■ I'm so glad that baseball playoffs have finally
started for three reasons. First, it means that all of
the teams that suck are no longer playing, thus
reducing the large number of games that wasted
valuable time. Second, it reduces my pain as a
person-who-is-from-Red-Sox-territory. Finally, it means
baseball season is almost over. Agony will be
continued next season
■ know that you are all sick of the Olympics and
I
NBC's horrific coverage, but I do have to talk about
Marion Jones for a moment. Her performances last
week were amazing, and even if they weren't all gold,
she did get five medals.
Considering where women's athletics were just 20
years ago, it is a significant achievement both
individually and for all female athletes. You can boo
and hiss all you want, but women's sports have only
been taken seriously for 25 years, and they are still

shockingly under-reported.
■ Speaking of women athletes, you should all go
out of your way to congratulate Anjani Reddy 'O4 on
her spectacular triumph last weekend. If you don't
know who she is, make it a goal to meet her before
October break. It takes a lot of physical and mental
strength to beat out a teammate in the semis,
especially Jen Pao 'Ol
The women's tennis team as a whole did
extremely well in the tournament, especially
considering that last year the coach forgot to enter
the team. The future of the team is definitely looking
good. Don't forget to give Reddy a slap on the back
for good luck in the championships in Memphis.

THE PHOENIX

Junior Joe Corso, one of the Garnet Tide's captains and a middle linebacker, sets tough goals for his life, then pushes
himself to meet them despite the odds. Teammates of Corso, who also plays baseball, say he is a natural team leader.

Corso lives for challenge
BY TED CHAN

Those who have played know that football games aren't
entirely won on the field or at practice during the week.
They're won in the off-season. For a warrior like Garnet captain and middle linebacker Joe Corso 'O2, the season always
starts at the same time:The minute after the last one ends.
Corso has goals academic, athletic and career-wise. In
any given day, week, month or year, there's barely enough
time to achieve them all. Yet Corso, with intense focus, tireless effort and almost superhuman dedication, somehow manages.

A record of accomplishment
Through four games, Corso leads the Garnet with 37 tackles, 6 tackles for losses and 2 forced fumbles. Last season, he

spearheaded Swarthmore's defense with 87 tackles and 13
tackles for losses. Talk to any of Corso's coaches or teammates, though, and they'll tell you that his contributions
extend far beyond the statistics.
"He has been a natural leader on our team," says Gar-

net head coach Pete Alvanos. "His high expectations have
raised the level of play for our entire team."
Corso's teammates demonstrated their respect for his
contributions by electing him captain this year. Co-captain Tony Hillery 'Ol says, "Joe has been an impact player
on the football field since the day he came to Swarthmore.
He is not only a team leader on the field, but also off of it."
Additionally, Corso is one of Swarthmore's top baseball
players, a stalwart at second base and a top run producer
near the start of the Garnet lineup.
