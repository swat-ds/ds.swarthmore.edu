Conscious Consumers is also questioning one of the mandatory guidelines included in the Endowment Presentation
to the Board of Managers. Section VII
of the book states, "As a matter of policy,
the Investment Committee manages the
endowment to yield the best long term
financial results, rather than pursue longterm objectives." But Suzanne Welsh
asserts that although the guideline exists, it does not preclude social objectives from being pursued in addition to
financial objectives. However, the evaluation of these objectives would have to
be a decision made by the entire community, not by the Investment Committee alone. "The guideline was created

"My laws, my country, my culture is lost," said a
Tibetan monk named Thuptn Chonyi at a protest
for Tibetan liberationand Taiwanese independence
last Thursday. Around him, a crowd of middle-aged
activists and students gathered outside of Independence Hall, where the visiting president of China,
Jiang Zemin, was speaking. The protest seemed to
have no official program; the crowd was peaceful
albeit slightly disorganized, with individual clusters of people forming circles around candles, taking walks to pass out fliers, or chanting and holding signs. Swarthmore students from groups such
as Amnesty International and Students for a Free
Tibet were out in full force, yelling chants and waving posters with slogans such as "If We Did This in
Tibet, We'd Get Shot!" or "Give Taiwan Sover-

eignty." Sophomore David Peterson climbed a traffic light, attracting a host of media attention. "The
protest was a lot of fun," said Gabe Cumming 'OO,
"and productive as a publicity stunt. It was cool to
get our new Students for a Free Tibet group involved
in some direct human rights action. Also, it was
nice to start becoming aware of the larger Tibetan
activist community in this area."
Dressed in a dark red robe, with a shaven head,
Thuptn Chonyi said that he hoped the protest would
encourage the United States to support the Tibetan
freedom cause. He seemed determined to fight for
the rights of Tibetan people and angry about how
much ofAmerican politics revolves around money.
In slightly broken English, he remarked, "China

DuPont Lecture Hall was
filled to capacity for Nobel laureate James Tobin's lecture entitled, "Can the U.S. Grow
Faster?" His presentation was
delivered as the annual Pierson
Lecture in Economics, in honor
of the longtime Swarthmore
College professor and chair
Frank Pierson. Tobin, who was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
1981 for his contributions to
macroeconomics and monetary
theory, focused his talk on policies that would and would not
work to increase the rate of
growth of the United States'
economy.
Tobin first attacked several
policies whose proponents
claim would have the effect of
increasing the U.S.' growth.
Jack Kemp's proposed 15% tax
cut, Tobin said, would have the
effect increasing the U.S.' rate
of growth, but this effect would
be short-lived. Similarly, a reduction of the capital gains tax
and various congressional proposals to set up IRA's and IRAlike medical savings accounts
would only increase growth in
the short term. The reason,
Tobin said, that these policies

long-term is that they would
have their greatest impact on
income and wealth that has already been accumulated, not on
future economic activity. Explained graphically, the effective barrier for the GDP might
be shifted up by these policies,
but it's slope would remain constant; so that while the U.S. sees
increased growth as the GDP
closes the gap to the higher barrier in the short-run, once it
reached that barrier, growth
would return it previous levels.
Policies that would result in
gains in growth in the long-run
included balancing the budget,
as well as greater savings and

In addition, the Queer-Straight
Alliance sponsored an open meeting in the Intercultural Center for
anyone interested in talking about
the event. The primary reaction
was serious concern over safety
issues and fear of confrontation
with the perpetrators of the incident. Those in attendance at the
meeting expressed an array of suggestions about the way the community should handle this anonymous act. Suggestions included a
march, an all-campus mailing, and
editorials in The Phoenix. Dialogue with the perpetrators was
suggested by some students, while
others considered a day of silence
to be more effective. A day for
males to show their support of the
gay community by wearing
dresses was suggested, as was the
establishment of an action/response committee consisting of a
core group of organizers prepared
to make decisions about how to act
quickly if a comparable incident
arises in the future.

The Swarthmore Queer Union in
conjunction with the QueerStraight Alliance sponsored a
number of chalkings around campus to promote tolerance within
the college community during
Coming Out Week. A backlash
occurred on the night of October
30 as many of SQU's messages
were defaced and replaced by
strong anti-gay rebuttals. In response to this incident, Bob Gross,
Acting Dean of the College, issued
a statement which read,
"Swarthmore values the lively presentation of dissenting views, but
we deplore this cowardly and
anonymous form of expression.
There is a sad irony in the fact that
the defaced messages were expressions of hope for tolerance. I
hope that everyone reading this
message is committed to a community based on civility and mutual respect."

The members of Conscious Consumers are working to form a committee that
will advise the Board of Managers
(BOM) on socially responsible investing. In the past month, Conscious Consumers have discussed their ideas with
the Alumni Council, President Al
Bloom, the members of the BOM, and
Treasurer Suzanne Welsh.
Conscious Consumers are concerned
with the college's investments in firms
that they believe are operating questionably. As of June 30, 1997,the school has
invested $l2 million in Phillip Morris
and RJR Nabisco combined, both of
which have come under fire for possibly encouraging smoking among minors.
Conscious Consumers are also criticiz-

ing the college's $3.2 million investment
in Disney, a company that has been accused of contracting international sweatshops.
The school presently has an endowment of approximately $748.1 million.
Operating under the auspices of the
Board of Managers is an Investment
Committee comprising 13 investment
professionals who decide how the endowment should be invested. Private
firms are then commissioned to devise
the college's stock portfplio and handle
the day-to-day transactions of the
school's investments. Over $6OO million
of the endowment is invested in four areas of the market: 59% in domestic equities, 19% in international equities, 8%
in alternative equities, and 14% in fixed
income and cash. The endowment generates 42% of the college's annual bud-

In response to a request by Student Council, the Student Activities Committee agreed to begin
the process of establishing concrete procedures that may eventually result in SAC modifying its
policies for funding parties. The
recent move ends a brief conflict
between SC and SAC over the
role the former should play in
writing the procedures.
Several SAC members have
voiced concern to SC leadership

in recent weeks over the lack of
formal procedures regulating
SAC's operations and, in particular, its decisions regarding funding ofcampus social events. Additionally, students have questioned SAC's policy of holding
closed meetings. SC decided at
its October 26 meeting to establish a workgroup to create procedures for SAC's practices but
SAC declined to appoint any representatives to the workgroup at
its meeting two days later.
SC Co-Chair Ari Plost '9B
warned SAC co-coordinator Jo-

seph Armah '9B on Tuesday that
further failure on the part of SAC
to initiate the workgroup would
constitute "insubordination" and
that "appropriate measures will be
taken." Armah did not dismiss the
value of formalizing SAC procedures, but questioned whether SC
should be involved in the process.
The conflict was complicated
when SC decided to send a representative to a normally private
SAC meeting Tuesday evening.
SAC initially protested but later
allowed the SC observer after SC
threatened to in effect nullify the

SAC meeting by refusing acknowledge its existence without
the observer.
SAC decided Tuesday against
forming a workgroup to discuss
its procedures and opted instead
to hold a retreat in the next few
weeks and report to SC with its
findings by November 23.
SC, later Tuesday evening, was
informed that there was dissent
within SAC and that the decision
to plan a retreat as opposed to a
workgroup may not have been the
consensus of SAC members. In
response, SC Co-Chair Sarah

Pheasant '9B announced in an allstudent email that it was holding
an "impromptu meeting" to
clarify the actual intent of SAC.
"SAC's desire to go on a retreat
is both understandable and a smart
move organizationally, by which
I mean it will promote better understanding among both members
of SAC and between members of
SAC and SC," Pheasant said. "But
ultimately I feel strongly that SAC
needs to move toward concrete
procedures and that the notion of
it having closed meetings—given

Hate speech: be wary of
quick, blanket judgement

The

got, Jap,

im

of
Swarthmore
College, or any
age

We are quick to characterize the most egregious statements of unpopular opinion as

other institution of
higher-learning,
as a civil, respectful and lively forum for the discussion of politi-

"hate speech that deserves no protection.

members of the
student body and
faculty like to envision. Some ofthe
recent incidents anti-homosexual
chalkings threaten this image because of their intellectual bankruptcy, yet there is a distinction to
be made between "Kill a faggot"
and "Gender is a biological construction." Certainly, the former is
not posed as a counter-argument to
the queer chalkings, and should be
seen as purely hateful. Yet, the latter does stand to argue with the
queer chalkings. The concept of
free speech is central to the notion
of informed and progressive debate
where unpopular opinions may be
expressed, not to make the process
easier, but to have a true and honest dialogue. Freedom of speech
makes discussion and debate more
difficult and more uncomfortable,
with the outcome being that the
participants may have a better understanding of the nature of the
problem discussed. We are quick to
characterize the most egregious
statements of unpopular opinion as
"hate speech" that deserves no protection. Fortunately, the college
policy regarding disciplinary action
regarding "harassing expression"
requires a pattern ofabuse unlikely
to infringe on the political expression of Swarthmore students.
Before we brand certain types of
expression as "hate speech", we
should examine the majority's commitment to respectful, open discussion and remember that function of
free speech is to protect those not
protected by the dominance of the
prevailing social dogma.
It is our firm commitment not to
deny anybody the freedom of
speech, that forces real dialogue
and the possibility of real change
to occur. Even the most despicable
statement we can conceive of, that
of"Do your duty,kill a [nigger, fag-

speech. It

is a daunting task to try to reason
with someone who is seemingly
unreasonable, but if the goal is to
change people's true feelings and
attitudes towards those who differ
from them, it must be done through
expression and interaction, not
through repression.
We must also keep a vigilant
watch over the actions of the social/political/intellectual majority;
here at Swarthmore it is all too easy
to forget that there are many disagreements that transcend the
questions of whether we should
divest in Philip Morris or run the
morning shuttle. In the classroom,
conservative opinions and religious
beliefs can often be casually dismissed or derided without fear of
reprimand.
We are not arguing'that the
school should begin to more
closely scrutinize the campus for
other incidents which can be
termed "Hate Speech", but that by
allowing a certain hyper-sensitivity towards the majority sentiment,
the college does a disservice to the
cause of real dialogue and change
on campus. We take for granted
that many of these things are
"settled issues" that deserve no further discussion, and this attitude is
manifested in an atmosphere that
can silence the minority opinion.
Our college is largely successful
in encouraging discussion rather
than dismissal, but we as individuals often fall into the trap of accepting the prevailing wisdom because
it is much easier to dismiss one's
challengers than to rationally engage them. It is the duty of both
majority and minority to willingly
and respectfully engage one another to give life to the image of
our college as an honest, fair, and
thoughtful marketplace of ideas.

Letters to the Editor
Hanging on to a Velvet Rope, pre-formal committee left dangling
To the Editor
In last week's potent yet eloquent
editorial, Mr. Salim Ebrahim leveled the challenge, "It is the duty
of every student and every alumnus who feels loyalty to this academic institution to challenge the
virus of guile and deceit that exists
at Swarthmore College." We, as
concerned students, are more than
prepared to take up the responsibility to illuminate what we feel
have been unjust actions taken
against us.
As small group of seniors, it was
our dream to sponsor a pre-formal
event that would stand unparalleled
in the minds of students. Having
attended our share of mediocre to
sub-par pre-formal events over the
years, we gleefully took on the
challenge of improving upon a
time-honored, cherished celebration. In planning for The Velvet
Rope we spent much time negotiating contracts with outside performers, coordinating refreshments, planning the decorating
concept, and advertising. To our

chagrin, we later learned that, because we planned to charge a fee
for entrance into the event (in order
to cover costs), as well as serve alcoholic beverages, we had infringed
a rule in the college handbook
which states, "There may be no advertising, either orally or in written
form, for private parties."
A number of things muddle the
efficacy of this rule, not the least of
which is the unequal application of
the rule to offending parties. Because our ad for the event continued to run a consecutive week in the
Weekly News, we have been fined,
and the status of our event has been
threatened. To date, other groups
with events coming up, whether
purposefully or out of ignorance of
the rule, have broken it without receiving any warnings or punitive
actions. In our consternation, we are
left asking two questions: First, why
has this rule been established in the
first place, and second, why are we
the ONLY group being targeted for
this infraction?
Two deans have offered two dif-

ferent angles on the spirit of this
rule. One argued that, in making
sancrosact Swarthmore's Quakerinspired tradition of dissolving
class distinctions, advertising for
fee-charging parties may be perceived as a form ofexclusion. Equal
opportunity for participation should
be the intended outcome of any
event. We are left to ask, however,
whether this reasoning really addresses that problem, since feecharging events sponsored on campus continue to exist legally? Another dean suggested that it is the
College's alcohol policy which influences this rule. According to the
handbook, it is illegal to vend alcohol without a license. The concern
exists that fee-charging events serving alcohol may be remiss in accentuating other aspects, such as
food, entertainment, etc. Then we
must ask, shouldn't the College be
concerned about the lack of nonalcoholic beverages andfood at free
events? From almost four years of
experience here, we must respond
with a resounding "yes." Addition-

ally, our own advertising for the
event in no way put a premium

on, alcoholic beverages over entertainment, food, and overall atmosphere. In fact, our advertising did not even mention that
spirits would be served at The
Velvet Rope.
We now turn to the second
question: Why are we the ONLY
group, out of a bevy of current
violators, being targeted for this
infraction? We are left perplexed
in attempting to answer this
question. The only thing left for
us to do is to stand up, dust ourselves off, and pursue the dream
we've envisioned for so long and
with such dedication; for, "No
matter what you say or do to us,
we are still worthwhile people!"
and the college community deserves an opportunity to experience The Velvet Rope before the
Fall Formal in Parlors.

The food services are simply unacceptable, here are solutions
To the Editor
Have you ever ran into Tarble at
B:lspm and wondered why the
chicken fingers, fries, and coke you
just got cost $1.50 than it would
have if you would have gotten it
16 minutes earlier? Do you get
tired of playing "Guess The Ingredients!" whenever you eat a meal
in Sharpies? Does it upset you that
faculty and staff members get a
fresh salad bar and hot entree during lunch in Tarble and students are
lucky to get any of the left-over
scraps? Irushort, are you tired of
being forced to pay thousands of
dollars for dining services which
just plain sucks? I know I am. As
a senior, I've endured all that
Sharpies and Tarble have to offer
for over three years now. But now
I've decided to stop whining and
do something about it.
Before I get to point, I should
make a few things clear. (1) Aside
from the infamous "Cheese Incident" last semester, I have only
positive things to say about the staff
in both Sharpies and Tarble. The
women and men who work to give
us food deserve much more respect
than most students and college
gives them. (2) Although the quality of food served in Sharpies can
be improved, that's not my focus
at this time. (3) I understand the
economic impossibility of offering
more meal plan options at a school
with such a small student body
without charging exorbitant fees
for room and board.
With that being said, I've con-

cluded that the following policies
must be examined and/or changed
in talking with several students over
the past three years and doing a bit
of undercover research last semester:

1) OUR DINNER CREDIT IN
TARBLE SHOULD NOT BE REDUCED BY $1.50 AFTER
8:00PM.
2) SHARPLES SHOULD LIST
THE INGREDIENTS IN ALL ENTREES. At a school where so
many people have restrictive diets,
a list of ingredients should be standard.
3) WE SHOULD NOT HAVE
TO PART A SEA OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICES TO FIND THAT
ONE PAPAYA NECTAR WE'VE
BEEN SEARCHING FOR. In
other words, Essie Mae's should
stop stocking the shelves with stuff
people do not generally buy.
4) STUDENTS SHOULD NOT
PLAY SECOND FIDDLE TO
FACULTY & STAFF WHEN
FOOD IS CONCERNED. If you
notice, faculty & staff get a nice
spread for their lunch. The salad
bar is stocked just for them and the
Tarble staff even put out a hot entree for them to eat. If we're lucky
we get the cold left-overs and assorted remains of the salad bar.
5) SHARPLES SHOULD DISCONTINUE "THE GET-THEF***-OUT BARATTHEENDOF
THE SEMESTER. If you notice,
the quality of food falls exponentially (if that's even possible) as

each semester winds to a close. This

insanity needs to stop.
6) ESSIE MAE'S SHOULD BE
OPEN ON WEEKENDS IF
TARBLEIS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE STUDENT CENTER. The
only reason most students go to
Tarble is to eat. However on weekends, Essie Mae's is closed for
breakfast and lunch. The snack bar
should be open during lunch and
possibly past midnight on the weekends. On Friday and Saturday
nights, we have no nearby food
options. If Essie Mae's were open
on those days, the college would
probably make money by selling
pizza, coffee, fries, and the like to
hungry (and sometimes inebriated)
partygoers. This would also improve the aura within the so-called
student center.
7) FOOD SHOULD NOT BE SO
OVERPRICED. $1 for one pack of
unfrosted Pop-Tarts, let's get real
real. I could buy a box of 4 packs
for $.50 more.
8) CUTTING QUANTITIES
AND QUALITY OF FOOD
SHOULD NOT BE A COSTCUTTING TOOL IN TARBLE.
Many ofyou may have noticed that
we now get one less finger with fingers & fries. We also get charged
to have more than one pickle with
sandwiches. These and other
changes in quality and quantity
have been enacted to reduce costs
and save money. I understand the
importance of saving money, but
this goal can be achieved better by
tailoring services to meet student
preferences as well.

9) SHARPLES SHOULD
POST MENUS FOR EACH
MEAL TO HELP CUT DOV/N
ON THE CROWDED LINES
DURING RUSH HOURS.
Most people check out the food
options (or lack thereof) at each
station before deciding which
dishes to sample. If menus were
prominently placed, then people
could get in and get out. Hence
reducing the crowd a bit.
I believe that a healthy body
is important to developing a
healthy mind. At a school as
stressful as Swarthmore, this
principle should undergird every
dining services policy. Unfortunately it does not. At the same
time, we, as students should not
just complain about the situation. We need to work to effectively to deal with the situation.
I plan to make improving food
services my last crusade at
Swarthmore. I'm tired of just
talking about it without doing
anything. By accepting the situation, that makes me a part of
the problem.
If you want to improve the
quality of food services at
Swarthmore please email me at
vjonesl. I hope to work with a
group of students to come up
with concrete, well thought out
solutions to the aforementioned
issues and any other reasonable

concerns which students feel
should be addressed.

Singled out: The
voice of silence
by Vonalis Pina

We

come to college to
have that mystical
"college experience,"
an image which had
been drilled into our
heads since we could remember. "It will
be fun," you hear throughout out high
school; "You can't do without that college experience." So, you choose
Swarthmore because it's the best, it
would be a challenge, the people during
pre-frosh were "really nice" and you
can't pass up on that arboretum. Freshman year, you realize that the green
grass, the blue sky and the beautiful
buildings are all part of this bubble that
only you have created. This bubble, the
one we call Swarthmore, is a microcosm
of the world that we read about in the
newspaper. The same world some of us
were trying to escape when we chose this
school. The only difference is that when
bad things happen, we choose to ignore
it. The community goes on ignoring
things said, making excuses for them,
and just letting things slide. But when is
it too much?
This past Friday, a couple of students
decided to host a mock game ofMTV's
"Singled Out." For those who don't
know what the game is: In the First part
of the game there are fifty single men. A
girl gets brought out blind-folded and by
categories she eliminates the fifty guys
down to three and from these three there
can be only one who can be singled out.
The second part of the game, there are
fifty single women and a guy who is
brought out blind folded. Many who
went to this game on Friday went because they were either curious about it,
or thought that it would be fun. A lot of
the girls and guys who joined the "dating pool" were those brave souls who
really wanted to be daring. So the fifty
or so single guys went up. Every one in
the audience was cheering for their
friends all the way down to the final
rourfd where three guy's remained. A

lucky fellow was picked and it was on to
the second part of the game: The girls
turn. Again everyone cheered for their
friends and the audience was enjoying the
show up until all but four girls and a guy
were left to be "singled out." The guy was
eliminated based on his voice, this was
ok because he was up there for fun and
every one knew this. Then, it was down
to the four girls, one of them was picked
based on a dance. It was still fun. The
other was picked because she answered
a question right; Again, everyone was
smiling because it was turning out ok.
Finally, two contestants had to kiss a paper and the guy was supposed to pick the
pair of lips he liked best. He picked my
lips, so I went up to where the other two
girls were standing. I said "hi"; They
didn't respond, they just stared at me. It
wasn't fun anymore. The room fell silent. A pin could have been heard if it
were dropped. The audience looked from
the two contestants to me and back. My
heart chilled and I noticed then, that every one was staring at me. The questions
started rolling and I was answering truthfully. Now it was down to a tie between
me and one of the other girls. I answered the question wrong and boom,
I was eliminated. "Thank God", I said
to myself. This was the first time in
my life that I have ever been glad to
lose.
During this "singled out" game I was
slapped in the face with an issue that I
hadbeen ignoring. I was ignorant to have
gone so long believing that things like
this would ever happen to me, but it did.
It happens to every one. At Swarthmore,
we hide it, we keep things hush, hush, if
people allude to the subject it's always
because you're exaggerating things, or
blowing them out of proportion. We continuously try to talk about it, but end up
being polite or tactful and agreeing with
the universal "Yeah it's bad and we
should do something about it." But days
go by and we don't do or say anything

until we come full circle again having
history repeating itself. Now what is this
word that I'm alluding to and why has it
become so important to me within two
days? This word is racism. And it is
something that despite my race, I have
been ignoring. I never considered myself in terms of being a bad person to be
friends' with because of my skin color.
Nevertheless that is the first thing people
see when they look at me. They see me
and deep within themselves the overt
differences between us is marked. Forgetting to consider that I have other
qualities, that we may share common
interests I am almost automatically
placed into a category because of my
complexion. This past Friday, I realized
how subtle the racism at Swarthmore is.
I realized that it wasn't everyone, just a
specific group, and even within that
group it could be narrowed down to just
a mere few. But it's those few that influence, and state their beliefs above everyone else's.
Standing in front of all those people
during the "singled out" game made me
realize that they were all staring at me
because they were all held in suspense
over what might happen if I were the one
to win. Since, after all, I was not like
them, not in culture or in color. And for
the first time in my life here at Swat did
I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.
The purpose of this article is not to complain about the event; I was not angered
by what happened, I was just sad. Nor is
it my purpose to tell the Deans that
something must be done. This article is
my voice and my way of telling the community that I did notice; I notice the tension the went through Tarble, I noticed
the stares of what may happen if a person ofcolor were to be singled out with
the Caucasian male. Though not a word
was said by anyone, actions often speak

louder than words. And even when the
racism is subtle, if it be directed at you,
take my word for it, you'll notice. This
bubble had enclosed within the far edges
of its shiny sky the very thing I thought
not find: racism. Hatred has penetrated
the film of green grass, purple flowers
and blue skies. It isn't perfect, it has never
been perfect, and it's time we owned up
to that fact. Last year a certain individual
was reprimanded on numerous occasions
for saying what he believed. Was it right
for him to be punished when he was
overtly saying what he felt? Is it fair that
one gets punished for saying what many
of them feel?
The Deans of the College are coming
up with a Hate Speech policy. But is censoring people really going to help? Won't
there still be that subtle hatred that I experienced on Friday? Actions do speak
louder than word thus by a Hate Speech
Policy, are we going to create another
layer in our so-called bubble? One that
silences us all while dividing us further
because silence does not prevent the mind
from thinking. Something more needs to
be done to unify those who hate or dislike those who are different from them.
But what? A required workshop? A class?
The breaking up of the fraternities? But
in the end would these things even help?
It's sad that in a school such as
Swarthmore, we have to create situations
that hurt the structure of student life. Situations that cause us to alienate ourselves
into different tables during lunch, different groups during parties, even awkwardness when it comes to dating. It makes
you wonder if you really did make the
right choice in terms of colleges. Or
maybe we should just keep on ignoring
things and continue to put layers upon
layers of excuses and policies. Perhaps
then we would see if our bubble was able
to endure our silence.

Responding to threats of
violence on campus
By
Occupational violence has emerged as
a critical safety and health hazard in the
United States. Unfortunately, there are
certain qualities peculiar to colleges and
universities that make them fertile
ground for breeding violent situations.
Campuses are usually "closed environments" —cultural microcosms with
their own mores and rules, partially insulated from society as a whole, but not
entirely the kind of communities that
make threat management essential to
ward off external and internal breaches
to security.
Inadequate security and prevention
plans pose premise liability risks to
campus administrators. The impact of
campus violence far exceeds an isolated
criminal incident. Victims and witnesses often respond to these situations
by filing law suits against educational
institutions with claims of negligence.
Recently, several campus victims have
had success in recovering third party
liability damages against colleges for
physical and psychological distress associated with a violent campus occurrence.
The issue of campus violence is complex and unique to each institution. It
should not be expected that students,
faculty, or staff will be experts in the
assessment of threatening behavior.
However, if there is threatening or bizarre behavior which indicates possible
danger, there should be adequate and
readily accessible resources on campus
to help appraise the circumstances.
Furthermore, a mechanism to design an
intervention plan to choose appropriate
safety measures should be adopted by
colleges and universities. Optimally,
security resources should link together
campus police, a threat assessment
team, and campus or occupational violence training for all members of the college community.
! Several colleges have developed a
model "Campus Security Act" in coordination with legal and law enforcement
professionals. Disclosure of information regarding campus safety policies
and procedures and statistics on certain
crimes that have taken place on campus are made available to the entire college community. The Act further re-

Jonathan D. Leahey, J.D.

quires that colleges and universities
record the number of crimes reported not
only to police but also to anyone who has
significant responsibilities for students
and campus activities.
This epidemic has prompted federal attention. The Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) developed guidelines for dealing with workplace violence. While the guidelines are
not federally mandated, they are often
used to propel plaintiff arguments when
assessing the adequacy of employer/campus security provisions. Many persons,
including experts in the fields oflaw enforcement and employee assistance, researchers, educators, unions, other stakeholders, OSHA professionals, and the
National Institute ofOccupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) contributed to these
guidelines.
Their goal is to eliminate or reduce
worker exposure to conditions that lead
to death or injury from violence by implementing effective security devices and
administrative work practices, among
other control measures.
The suggestions made by OSHA are
simple and include four main components to effectively reduce occupational
and campus violence: Administrative
commitment and faculty/student involvement; campus and worksite analysis; hazard prevention and control; safety and
prevention training.
Developing a Prevention Commitment
It is crucial that Administrators, faculty,
staffand students work in a complementary fashion to ensure an effective security program. Administartors must endorse such an initiative with visible top
management providing the motivation
and resources to deal seriously with campus violence.
Such a commitment should include the
following: Demonstrated organizational
concern for emotionaland physical safety
and health.
Assigned responsibility for the various
aspects of the prevention program to ensure that all managers, supervisors, and
employees and students understand their
obligations.
A comprehensive program of medical

and psychological counseling and debriefing for students and staff experiencing or witnessing assaults and other violent incidents.
Faculty, staffand student involvement
allow the expression of useful information to design, implement, and evaluate
the program.
This involvement should include the
following: Understanding and complying with the prevention program and
other safety and security measures.
Prompt and accurate reporting of violent incidents.
Participation on safety and health committees or teams that receive reports of
violent incidents or security problems,
make facility inspections, and respond
with recommendations for corrective
strategies.
Taking part in a continuing education
program that covers techniques to recognize escalating agitation, assaultive behavior, or criminal intent, and discusses
appropriate responses.
A "Threat Assessment Team," similar
task force, or coordinator may assess the
vulnerability to campus violence and determine the appropriate preventive actions to be taken.
The recommended program for campus/worksite analysis includes, but is not
limited to, analyzing and tracking
records; monitoring trends and analyzing incidents; screening surveys; and
analyzing workplace security.
Post-Incident Response
Post-incident response and evaluation
are essential to an effective violence prevention program. All prevention programs should provide comprehensive
treatment for victims and other witnesses
who may be traumatized by witnessing
a violent incident. A psychological evaluation should always be performed on affected individuals whenever an assault
takes place, regardless of severity. There
are several types of assistance that can
be incorporated into the post-incident response, including trauma-crisis counseling, critical incident stress debriefing,
and campus victim assistance programs.
Training and Education
Prevention training and education en-

sures that everyone is aware of potential
security hazards. Training should cover
robbery and assault prevention, reaction,
and post-incident strategies, conflict resolution, and personal safety.
Security personnel need specific training that includes handling aggressive behavior and the diffusion of escalating hostility. Training programs should include
constant evaluation. The content, methods, and frequency of training should be
reviewed annually. Deficiencies should
be identified and corrective action taken.
An evaluation program should involve
the following:
Establishing a uniform violence reporting system and regular review of reports.
Measuring improvement based on lowering the frequency and severity of workplace violence.
Keeping up-to-date records of administrative and work practice changes to prevent workplace violence to evaluate their
effectiveness.
Complying with OSHA and state requirements for recording and reporting
deaths and injuries.
The Next Step
The first step in designing a comprehensive and adequate violence prevention
strategy is to assess the current security
situation on campus. In most cases, there
is no coordinated effort between administrators, faculty, students and security
personnel. This inevitably leads to a lack
of proper prevention measures and sets
the scenario for a potential catastrophe.
A proper initiative would follow the
model of other institutions by putting the
appropriate authorities on notice. Quite
possibly a responsible student or faculty
committee could submit a memorandum
to all deans, directors, and department
heads with an advisory detailing precisely
how campus staffand supervisors should
deal with violence or the threat of violence. Further action might begin the formation of a threat-assessment team.
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of students, faculty, staff and administration to
take this unfortunate trend of violence
very seriously to insure a safe learning environment.

The
lynching of
Affirmative
Action
By Matthew Kahn
On Monday, the United States Supreme Court,
the final avenue of legal recourse and redress for
all Americans, regardless of race, creed, religion,
color, or sexual orientation, declined to consider the
constitutionality of California's controversial
Proposition 209. By denying the appeal, the Court
let stand a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, who ruled that Proposition 209 is indeed
constitutional.
Proposition 209, which was adopted into the California state constitution by voter referendum in
1996, purports to end "discrimination" of any kind
in state affairs. On the face of it, this seems a worthy goal, and California voters passed the measure
with significantly more than a majority. However,
when the law says all discrimination, it means all
discrimination, which signifies that all affirmative
action in state activities is now against the law in
California. From blatant racial quota schemes to
subtler "taking gender into account" procedures, affirmative action has been erased in one fell swoop
by Californian voters.
Anti-affirmative action advocates, mostly lower
and middle class whites, have heralded the passage
of Proposition 209 as good riddance to an unfair
policy of reverse discrimination.Affirmative action,
they claim, is unnecessary, because discrimination
against African-Americans, women, Asians, etc., no
longer exists. We live in an equal society, where
everyone has the chance to get ahead and succeed
if they try hard enough. Why should I lose my job/
place at a university to a less-qualified minority applicant? They point to the presence of previouslyoppressed groups in business, higher education,
government, and so on, as proof that even if affirmative action ever was necessary, it now no longer
is.
On its face, this argument makes sense. However,
just because there is no active discrimination today
does not mean that the effects of past discrimination are not still felt in our country. Two hundred
years of slavery, repression, and second-class citizenship does tend to leave its mark. Goingfrom a
society slanted toward one group to an equal-opportunity society still leaves the previously-dominant group very much in power. Lyndon Johnson
summed up this situation nicely when he created
affirmative action in the 1960'5: You cannot take
the shackles off of someone who has been chained
for two hundred years, and then expect him to immediately run the race. Thirty years of affirmative
action is nothing compared to two centuries of negative action; some sort of aid for minorities is still
required.
In the face of this evidence, how can so many
people be against affirmative action? After all, it
helps more than half of our country's population.
As it turns out, a lot of California voters didn't even
realize what they were doing when they passed 209.
When polled, a great majority of them stated that
they were in favor of affirmative action in hiring
and college and graduate school admissions. When
informed that women are the greatest beneficiaries
of affirmative action policies (not African-Americans, as is commonly believed), the levels of support rose even higher. Given this information, it
seems counterintuitive that these same voters would
end affirmative action. The reason for their apparent betrayal, however, is that on the actual ballot,
under "Proposition 209," the words "affirmative
action" are nowhere to be found. Neither is "racial
preference," nor "redressing past inequalities."
There is just one sentence, advocating the end of
"discrimination." The average uniformed voters, in
other words, who went into the voting booth without having done much research on the numerous
issues before them, were hoodwinked.
And now the Court has refused to remedy the injustice that Californians have (unintentionally)
done. From one perspective, this refusal may be a
good thing. The Court is very conservative right
now, and would likely uphold the legislation. By
not hearing arguments on it, a challenge to it can
be brought later, perhaps when a more liberal Court
is in session. From a theoretical perspective, however, theirrefusal was ill-advised because the Constitution is at odds with Proposition 209. Regardless ofits rhetoric, the intent and effect of the measure is to remove the slight advantages currently
afforded minority groups, thus creating what in
constitutional law is known as a "suspect classification," which violates the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such a classification would cause the Court to require that the government of California show a "compelling state interest" for the adoption of Proposition 209. There
is no such interest, however. California would attempt to justify the law by saying they were merely
"levelling the playing field," but would be rebuffed
by statistics and studies showing that minority students are still very much underrepresented in government jobs and state graduate schools, and that
without affirmative action the playing field would
be very much slanted towards white men. The University of California's law school, Boalt Hall, is a
frightening example of this phenomenon. Without
a compelling state interest, the law is unconstitutional because it violates the 14th Amendment of
the US Constitution. Proposition 209 is an invidious attempt by conservatives to stall any true equality of opportunity in this country, and should be
overturned.

DU confronts negative image
By

G.A. Balgobin

Rachael Brakke's stolen Honda Accord was returned relatively
undamaged by Delaware police last Friday.

Nick Attanasio

They have their own table in Sharpies.
They have their own house on campus.
They can claim some of Swarthmore's
most illustrious alumni—names like
Hallowell, McCibe and Sharpies—as their
own. In more ways than one, Delta Upsilon has a unique place in Swarthmore's
nearly unlimited pantheon of student organizations.
The notion of the fraternity has often
found itself at odds with the values—most
notably non-exclusiveness—enshrined by
the College. And the general consensus on
campus seems to be that frats as a whole
aren't cool. "Nearly all the fraternities on
campus lack ambition, stature and true purpose," said a male sophomore who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, "Their existence, which is only kept alive by the effort ofrich, naive old men, serves only the
mere function of drinking, partying, and
providing the College's 'finest' a place to
call their own." All three fraternities have
kept an extremely low profile. DU is no
exception to the rule. But the 163-year-old
institution suffers from an unusually bad
reputation. Perhaps the most common allusion which arises in connection to DU is
the stereotypical "dumb jock" image.
Members of the fraternity all agree that
it has been widely misunderstood, although
they seem relatively unperturbed by the absence of public support. According to Ford
O'Connell, the fraternity's public relations
head, the campus perception of DU is
"warped," citing the frequent comparison
of DU to the fraternity featured in the movie

Animal House. "The campus as a whole
hasn't given DU a fair shake," said DU
president Tony Buendia"9B. Buendia,
however, makes a point of emphasizing
that the fraternity intentionally avoids replying to attacks. He casually dismissed the
"dumb jock" label as being merely "humorous." "It doesn't bother me that the
freaks don't like us," said sophomore fraternity brother Paul Willenberg, "it shows
us that society works," although he did express concern about the "ignorance" which
he claims pervades among more mainstream students.
Buendia and other fraternity brothers attribute this anti-DU tendency to several
causes including jealousy, ignorance, and
Delta Upsilon's inherently private nature.
The president feels that some students may
envy the fact that DU brothers still have
time to do well in their classes in addition
to playing sports, participating in campus
activities and remaining active in the frat.
Additionally, Buendia thinks that most
people lack a basic understanding of DU.
"If you ask people who is in DU," said
Buendia, "I don't think they could tell you."
O'Connell suggest that the very nature of
fraternities in general (and DU in particular) could lead people to give the group a
bad name. He also claims that DU is "more
private" in comparison to other campus
organizations. Buendia says that this privacy is not intended "to be isolationistic,"
but is more "a question of being comfortable." Willenberg was anxious to emphasize that compared with other big school
fraternities, Swarthmore's chapter of DU
is not overly separatist. For example, said
Willenberg, "we don't [all] live in the

house" (In fact only one brother lives
there); "when you live in the fraternity, the
fraternity becomes isolated [from the rest
of the college]."
To refute the prevalent image of DU,
Buendia and O'Connell pointed to the academic excellence of its members, as well
as its active involvement in community
work and other campus activities. Buendia
referred to brothers who have attained highest honors and have majored in traditionally difficult departments including engineering and economics. The fraternity can
claim "TA galore" from its ranks, according to Buendia. He also cited the participation of brothers in organizations ranging from 16 feet to SAC. Also unbeknownst
to most studentsis the fraternity's involvement in Big Brothers/Big Sisters, SHIP, and
the group's sponsorship of campus speakers. O'Connell also emphasized the diversity within DU. It comprises "not all the
same type of people," he said, highlighting the fact that brothers in the frat come
from different ethnic backgrounds and
sexual orientation.
According to Buendia, the fraternity has
not received much recognition for these
social efforts because they have not actively
publicized them on their own. O'Connell,
nonetheless hopes to remedy the situation
through his role as PR director. "I really
want to change the image of DU," says
O'Connell.
Despite the current drift of popular opinion, DU seems to have at least one redeeming quality. "A lot people... Monday
through Friday badmouth DU... but come
Saturday night they're all at the party," said
O'Connell.

Missing cars turn up
Endowment comes under firefrom
intact to relief of owners
campus conscious consumer group
By Emily

Shartin

Both Rachel Brakke '9B and Connie
Cheung '9B have plenty to smile about.
After resigning themselves to the dismal
probability that they were never going to
see their cars again, their Honda Accords,
stolen from the C Lot last week, have
turned up fully intact.
Brakke received a call Friday evening
from police in Wilmington, Delaware informing her that her car had been found
abandoned in a nearby lot. She was asked
to come pick it up and told to bring a screwdriver because the ignition was busted.
While sundry items were taken from her
car, all in all "it was in pretty good shape,"
Brakke says.
Cheung received a call from police on
Tuesday evening notifying her that her
Accord had been found in a lot in Yeadon,
Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia.
Initial police inspections show that the ignition was similarly destroyed, but the car
has been towed to a nearby repair shop for
further damage assessment. Cheung estimates that she will not actually be able to
see her car until sometime next week.
Both women speculate that the two thefts
were related, although no suspects have

been taken into custody. Considering that
neither of the cars was stripped for parts,
Cheung says, "It sounds like it was just
some kids out for a joyride."
There was some indication that a possible
link to the thieves had been discovered
when Yeadon police told Cheung that they
"needed to talk to [her] about something
they hadfound in [her] car," possibly something that the thieves had left behind. But
no mention of this mysterious discovery
was made when Cheung went to theYeadon
station to sign her release form. "Nobody
said anything and I didn't ask. I'm guessing it turned out to be nothing," says
Cheung.
Although they now have their cars back,
neither Cheung nor Brakke is taking any
chances. "The Honda Accord is the #1 stolen car in the United States," says Cheung.
"If you know what you're doing, I've heard
that it takes only 30 seconds to get in and
get the car running... I really hope that Public Safety will pay more attention to the
school parking lots in light of these incidents." Brakke adds that she knows she's
"not off the hook" and fears that there
might be little to prevent her car from being stolen again. "I plan on securing my
car tightly from now on," she says.

Welsh.
This is not the first time that the investments of the college have come under scrutiny. In 1986, a campus committee was successful in persuading the
BOM to divest from all companies in
South Africa in response to the national
movement against apartheid.
The decision to divest was supported
by all constituencies: faculty, staff, students, alumni, and administration. The
college ultimately lost money during the
eight years that it did not invest in South
Africa, but President Bloom concedes
that occasionally sacrifices have to be
made. However, these occasions are far

Pheasant stressed that SC is
not interested in micro-managing SAC and that particular
decisions regarding party
funding are its own to make.
However, SC does have a legitimate interest in having its
committees operate under

concrete procedures, according to Pheasant.
At the end of the SC meet-

reached the conclusion that
SAC should write its own
guidelines and that they would
be submitted to SC by November 23. Said SAC member Paul

Corey Datz-Greenberg 'OO, a member

the new committee would not necessarily be to ensure divestment, but mainly
to provide a community voice in the investments of the College. He says that
he would like the committee io work on

Greenberg says that however they decide
to assess this, it will reflect the general

opinion of the entire community. But
President Bloom is concerned that it will
be a difficult task. "Companies are very
complex entities. It is likely that many
people in any community would find
something morally distasteful in any
company whether its the product they
produce, the advertising they do, the environmental impact they have, or the
way that they treat their employees,"
says Bloom.
Many other liberal arts colleges and
universities, such as Bryn Mawr,
Haverford, Wellesley, Williams, and Yale
have established investment advisory
committees. The members of Conscious
Consumers are in the process of doing
extensive research on these other committees, using them as models in structuring a similar committee at

In 1950, the People's Republic ofChina (PRC) invaded Tibet
and forced the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and political leader,
along with thousand other Buddhist monks, into exile. Tibet has
since been underthe control of the Chinese government., and it is
estimated that during this time over one million Tibetans have
been killed, while thousands ofothers have been imprisoned and
beaten. In an attempt to eradicateTibetan identity, Chinese people
have not only been encouraged by their government to resettle in
Tibet, Tibetan women have been forced to become sterile or to
have abortions. Problems of famine and unemployment plague
the country, and there is no freedom of speech, press or religion
in Tibet under the reign of the PRC.
The Tibetans were not the only group to showcase their cause.
Protesters in support ofTaiwanese independence also joined the
protests. In a speech brimming with nationalistic pride, Frank
Huang made his case for independence. 'Taiwan's economy is in
the seventh place in the world. Taiwan has human rights, immigration... things they don't have in China," said Huang. 'Taiwanese should have self-determination for their own future." A poll
taken in September found that, for the first time, a majority of
Taiwanese citizens prefer separation from China over reunification.
Taiwan is currently ruled by the nationalist party, which supports the reunification of the island state and mainland China.
The nationalists retreated to Taiwan after their defeat to the Chinese Communists in 1942 following a prolonged civil war. On
February 28, 1947, an uprising and massacre of at least 20,000
people spurred the creation of an opposition movement for Taiwanese independence. Even after settling in Taiwan, the nationalist government still operated on the premise that it ruled the
entire country and it would eventually reclaim the mainland—hence history textbooks focused on ancient Chinese history played
down the importance of local history. However, popular sentiments have changed dramatically over the years, forcing the government to moderate its stance. Newly rewritten textbooks will
teach middle-school students an entire year of Taiwanese history
and geography. In recent years, many pro-independence who left
the island to escape persecution have been allowed to return.

Holocaust art exhibit expresses what words cannot
"How could six million voices not be
heard, even if they whispered," said Alice
Lok Cahana, a Holocaust survivor, before
a List Gallery talk for "History, Memory,
and Representation: Responses to Genocide" last Wednesday. She stood before
her work entitled No Names, a seven-foot
tall painting ofrailroad tracks that go into
blackness and a blur of dark orange and
green. The railroad, which Mrs. Cahana
said led to Auschwitz, is surrounded by
numbers. As she spoke with students
about the concentration camps and her
symbolic numbers, Mrs. Cahana said,
"we are not people anymore, so we can
be...." She stopped speaking and threw up
her hands in a gesture that spoke of the
inadequacy of words.
There is an aura of silence in the works
of Mrs. Cahana, Judith Ellis Glickman,
and Robert Barsamian that are being exhibited at the List Gallery. During the

gallery talk, Mrs. Cahana said, "How can
we speak for six million? We barely understand one person. Words cannot express it. Art cannot express it. Nothing
can express it. Silence is the only thing
that can tell." Each of the artists depicted
their responses to genocide differently,
perhaps because their life experiences had
varied so widely.
Mrs. Cahana exhibited a series of large
mixed-media paintings rich in symbolism. Of a painting entitled Waiting for the
Magic Bird , she said, "There is a Jewish
folk song in Hungary about the magic bird
with green rings and blue legs that will
redeem us and take us to the promised
land. I imagined the magic bird in many
forms. When the melody resurfaced in my
mind, it was in Auschwitz." Motioning
to the painting, she said, "The wings are
spread but going nowhere. The legs are
going into gas. The painting is very confused." There is also a sense of disorder
in her work named Arbeit Macht Frei

their cast and expands their focus.
If the hooting of a
generous opening
night audience is
anything to judge
by, this is well-received entertainHall
ment for the
Cabaret Beat
Swarthmore community.
Aside from some gender/ed rumblings
dialogue, and a scorching exhortation finale, this Cabaret does not turn their typical mirror at the navel of Swarthmore;
rather, they run their combined satirical
impulses over a broader range ofhuman/
mammalian/vegetable relations.
This year this un-chartered student
group made a conscious effort to achieve
an ensemble format; members of previous Cabarets were asked to leave in favor
of a self-identified core of writer/director/actors. The resulting show reflects
both the joys and sorrows of this enfolding; regardless, over 100 smoking and
drinking students, faculty and administrators packed-in for two and a half hours
of skits and songs this Wensday [sic], and
seemed to thoroughly enjoy the fare.
While occasionally a problem with past
Cabarets, the show seldom drags; it is
propelled straight through with extreme
verve by the frenetic, tightly wound cast
of six. No one would accuse these actors
of a lack of energy: their eyeballs nearly
fly from their skulls in multiple skits and
most scenes wind to a fever pitch of foaming-at-the-mouth fervour.

November 7, 1997

Images of yesteryear,
Swat 100 years ago
from 100,AS
and interesting to revisit Swarthmore college life in 1897. Take a mental journey
back in time: if you were a student in the Fall
of 1897, what would your typical day be like?
A day in the life of a Swarthmore Student: November 7, 1897

Morning

I awaken to the pounding of feet outside
of my dorm room in Parrish West. It is
7:28 and the other members ofmy hall are
rushing to breakfast, which begins at 7:30.
After throwing on some clothes, including
a sweater I recently bought for the bargain
price of $1.50 at Strawbridge & Clothier's,
and after a hasty toilette, I run downstairs to the
dining room on the first floorof Parrish.
On my way, I run into a group women
coming from Parrish East, the girls' end. I
slow my pace to show them due respect.
At first, I wasn't quite sure how to treat the
girls who were my classmates since coeducation is a novel idea in higher education.
Since then, however, I have learned to treat
them as intellectual equals and gentle companions. Mealtimes provide one of the few
opportunities to interact with members of
the other sex, so I look forward to them.
I escort the girls to the dining hall and
join my eating group, which consists of
four men, four women and Arthur
Beardsley, the professor of Engineering.
Over tea and toast, I talk with some of the
other men at the table about the song we
plan to sing during Singing Hour on
Wednesday night, hosted by the matron
Elizabeth Bond in Parrish Parlours. We
plan to sing part of the Alma Mater, which
was recently composed by E.J. Taylor. The
song strikes pride in my heart, especially
the second verse:
Ev 'rystone of Alma Mater, Holds a mem 'ry dear;
Ev 'ry ripple ofCrum 's waters, Is a greeting clear.
Then you 'II hear theold "Grads singing. As they
sang of Yore,
Hail to thee our Alma Mater! Hail, all hail
"

Swarthmore!

After breakfast, I study Physics and Elocution before collection (also known as
chapel). I take a short stroll down the asphaltum, the broad footway from Parrish
Hall to the railroad tracks at the bottom of
the hill. I avoid the paths on the east side
of the campus, which are for the exclusive
use of girls and "no permission can be
given for boys to go there." Afterwards,
from quarter to nine until twelve noon, I
am busy with recitations and study. In the
mornings I have French Language and Literature, which is taught by Edward Hicks
MagiH. previously the President of the college. I spend most of my time on central
core of the second and third floors of

Parrish, where the library and class rooms
are located.
Afternoon:
Lunch consists of an bland combination
of oyster soup, beef Wellington, and custard.
Yesterday, the fare was better since the Managers of the College were visiting. Alas.
After lunch, I go to the Hall Gymnasium
for Boys [the site of current LPAC and
Lang] for a few games of tennis with my
best friend. The Somerville Gymnasium
for girls was built a few years ago [on the
site of current McCabe library], but the
names ofthe accomplished female athletes
are not publicized. After half-past one, I
have Physics and Chemistry classes in Science Hall [now called Trotter Hall]. These
classes mainly consist of men, since the
women seem to be more interested in literatures and languages than the rigorous
scientific fields.
At six, we are summoned to dinner by
the large brass handbell in Parrish Hall and
the college bell outside. I used to belong
to the Knights of the Freezer eating club,
but I now eat in my eating group because I
enjoy the mixed company. The girls change
their shirtwaists and skirts for pretty dresses at
dinnerand the men usually put on a tie.
At dinner, we discuss the requirement
that all students attend the campus Friends
meeting on Sundays. Non-Quakers say that
they shouldn't be required to go, while
some Quakers argue that since the institution was founded on Hicksite Quaker values,
these values should be instilled in students.

Evening
After dinner it is especially arranged that
students will have three-quarters of an hour
each evening for social intercourse in the
parlours. Social hour is rigorously chaperoned by the matron of the college, Elizabeth Bond, who assures the "presentation
of the noblest relations of men and women,
as to check the growth of unwholesome
sentiment." In other words, she admonishes
young women who act too coquettish or
couples who retreat into quiet corners of
the parlor. Along these lines, a poem in
last month's issue of the Phoenix warned
young female freshmen to:
Go to Social Hour, dear, you may be with a boy,
But don't sit in a corner, and do not look coy.
And ifat the station you meet a co-ed,
Don't walk up beside him, but hurry ahead.
Or linger behind withyoureyes on the ground.
After social hour, I have a Delta Upsilon
meeting. Our chapter was established three
years ago, and currently has twenty members. I am a contributor to the Delta Upsilon magazine, which can be subscribed to
for sl/year. Since Swarthmore first accepted fraternities in 1888, our social and
financial power has increased. Currently,

Phoenix staff, 1897. The Phoenix was a bi-monthly publication at that time.
there are three fraternities for men and three
for women. Even when the faculty banned
social functions on any night except Saturday, we rented rooms in the village and
carried on!
Students meet two evenings of the week
for singing: Sundays for the singing of
hymns and Wednesday for college songs.
I'm relieved to be a student in 1897rather
than when my uncle attended Swarthmore.
Then, under the presidency of Edward
Hicks Magill, dancing and music were discouraged while "plain speech" and "plan
dress" were encouraged. In 1882, the year
after The GreatFire gutted Parrish, the faculty
prevented formation of a glee club on the
grounds that it might "perform bawdy songs."
These strict rules caused enrollment to
drop severely. As a result, under Elizabeth
Bond's deanship, the most stringent rules
were expunged and a piano was put in
Parrish Parlours. After 1888, glee clubs
were allowed, to everyone's pleasure.
In the evenings, I also have meetings for
the Eunomian Literary Society, the Phoenix, and the Delphic Oratorical society. A
certain member of the sophomore class,
towards whom I have special affection, is
a member of the women's mandolin club
and the Halcyon staff, so 1 often do not get
a chance to see her in the evenings. She is
also attends Christian Temperance Union

meetings in the borough on Saturday evenings.

Weekends:
On the weekends, I try to escape the campus as much as possible, sometimes by
travelling to Media or Philadelphia. Sometimes, when I'm in town, I sneak a smoke
because the college catalog bans the use of
tobacco among students.
Social and recreational activities are limited, however, since there are few diversions in the borough and transportation is
limited to the railroad. Stuck on campus,
we entertain ourselves with the annual Keg
Rush, sophomore-freshman fights, hazing
activities, and water fights in Wharton. On
the more cultural side, there are sometimes
Dean's teas, fraternity parties, Maypole
dances, and Greek plays.our lives.
Since the college graduated its first class
in 1873 offive women and one man, it has
become a prestigious institution. Now, I
am a memberof a class of thirty-three students, sixteen women and seventeen men.
I am proud to be a student at Swarthmore
College. The words of the popular song
"Swarthmore Forever" say it best,
O Swarthmore ever dear!
No time our bonds shall sever!
Through joyous days and drear,
Our hearts our thineforever.

word Saturday is cut off, which
Mrs. Cahana said was the happiest
day of the week for her family and
her before the Holocaust.
The work of Ms. Glickman, a
Californian who has photographed
Elie Weisel and other survivors,
consisted of a series of subtly disturbing black and white photographs. She allows the images of
concentration camps to speak for
themselves; there is a sense of stillness in her art. Ms. Glickman visited Poland in 1988 and left wondering how many members of her
family had been extinguished in the
Holocaust. Her photograph entitled
Dissection Table, which is of a dark
room with only a gently lighted
table and a cluster of dissecting
tools, inspires the viewer to imagine atrocities instead of shocking
him with obvious pictures. Another
work, Cell, Auschwitz Concentration Camp, Poland, is a haunting
image of a room that has been
marked by prisoners' fingernails.
The floor and the right side of the
cell are obscured in darkness while
a window glowing with light illuminates the prisoners' writing on

sometimes hike on the 240 acre campus,
half of which is devoted to farming purposes. Boys and girls are forbidden to walk
together unless they are brother and sister,
so I meet my female friend at the home of
an approved chaperone. Then, we go walking or canoeing in the Crum. We always return before dinner since therules say that girls
must not return to the college after dark.
All in all, I enjoy being a student at
Swarthmore College. The degree is valuable, but I can still get a decent job without a college education. In fact, only 40
percent of Swarthmore students complete
four years here. The students who are here,
however, are very serious about their studies. In the end, studying is our central occupation even though we try to prevent it
from engulfing the other parts of our lives.

Bunks, Birkenau. Concentration
Camp, Poland a room of stained
cracked concrete contrasts sharply
with a window radiant with sunshine. The light's brilliance is unearthly; it shines across the claustrophobic space with the quality of
a dream.
In the beginning of the gallery
talk, Andrea Packard, the curator,
said, "Hitler assured his soldiers
they would not go down in infamy,
for who, after all, remembers the
Armenian genocide." In what is
often called "the forgotten genocide," one and a halfmillion Arme,

nians were slaughtered in the time
period of and following World War
I. Entering the List Gallery's inner
room where Mr. Barsamian's
mixed-media installation was exhibited is like walking into a shrine.
Mr. Barsamian, an ArmenianAmerican, said, "I realized I had
neglected a history and culture that
was very rich and I did not want to
neglect that. My grandmother...was
a survivor of the Armenian
genocide....l wanted to deal
with...memory." Reminiscent of
portraits, his drawings on delicate
lace framed by wooden branches
rest in each side of the room. In-

Cabaret offers the best of
and student'performed drama
from CABARET,AS
The humour this time stems from witty
writing and good timing, rather than
Swarthmore-specific inside jokes. In previous shows Cabaret has helpfully hoisted
Swarthmore on their own particularly sharp
and profane petard. This show boasts no
such distinctive characters as the "Swat
gangsta" ("from the rugged lands of
Manayunk, yo") or "the fashion police."
This time a few scenes observe sexual malaise
with acutely sharp staged dialogue between
women and men (or Emily Salzfass and Anne
Fricke in particular) that mirrors relationship
conversation of this particular age, regardless
ofsetting. In these scenes theirtalentfor scripted
conversation shines.

Other scenes lambaste British murder
mystery, the Houdini myth, and ursine research. Some of these have moments of
easy humour- (admittedly well executed)
accented ethnic caricatures, vegetable-sex,
masculine might but each boasts the inimitable Cabaret stage velocity. Still, they
exercise admirable restraint: after most
skits lam left marvelling— Cabaret is to
be praised for good endings; each of their
scenes leaves you with something to
savour. Often short comedic skits disintegrate into absurdity and lose their flow.
While numerous scenes here fall back on death
as a terminus, the death comes after fantastic
lines. When MikeZadara finally collapses from
wandering in the desert, his death is to be cel-

dividual reveals himself to be so human that one cannot help identifying with him.
Prouty's acting will grab you with its directness and honesty. This is a truly riveting monologue that will ask you difficult questions, yet also make you laugh.
This scene is followed by "Naomi in the Living Room," by Christopher Durang.
Although this feature writerdidn't get to see the scene, the director, Jerry Melichar,
has this to say: "An intimate look at a "quiet" afternoon visit with Naomi, queen of
the dysfunctional mothers. Find out how Statue of Liberty salt and pepper shakers,
cross-dressing, and an orgasmic couch can all be integrated into one scene. Kathy
Walley, Suellen Lee, and Aaron Carlisle all make their startling debuts on the
Swarthmore stage in this madcap Christopher Durang comedy."
Finishing the night is the off-the-wall farce "The American Dream," by Edward
Albee. Director Dave Ryan certainly proves his ability to capture Albee's insane
style. In this play, Albee looks askance at what we view as a typical American
dream, and what life is like on top. Beth Bonacci pulls off the role of "rich man's
wife" with remarkable panache, and J.B. Farley's theatrical abilities gleam through
his rather clowny role of "Daddy." Both are well complemented by Grandma,
played by Ailleen Miller. The play brings up issues of money, hats, old age, and
love. It will leave you laughing, but you won't be quite sure why.

cense burned on a pile ofashes beneath one of the drawings; the
smoke and fragrance created an atmosphere of reverence. Mr.
Barsamian also used sculpture,
such as pieces of metal fingers and
oxidized coins depicting a crucified
Jesus, to show a more direct and
bitter reaction to genocide. The
main effect of his work, however,
is one of fragile loveliness. Mr.
Barsamian said, "I really need
to...bring the beauty of memory, the
feeling ofmemory., .to reach across
all nationalities to say that these
things happened. They are happen-

ing now."

ebrated; both for the quality of his solliloquy,
and his bug-eyed frothing finally ended.
Their acting imparts the words with the
appropriate slack or urgency. These actors
have a good relationship with their words;
the dialogue scenes seem perfectly scripted
yet casually spoken; the bizarrely set scenes
are well articulated.
One scene where Wilson Kello assails
members of the audience unwilling to admit their craving for sweets escalates into
a frenzy of unevenly-metered rhymes correlating confections and erections. After
this torrent of brilliant verbiage, there is
nothing left to do when the lights go down
but hold yer belly and holler.

Hopefully everyone has recovered from the walk back from ml, Kudos to those who got a ride on the shuttle or were not chased by the
cops (Didn't anyone see the guy in the shopping cart?). Overall, the
Halloween party was a success and had quite a turnout. A good,
solid Party of the Week.

This weekend also boasts a party of epic proportions: The Fall
Formats. Theformatis in Upper Tarbie on Saturday, as always.
On Friday night, there are two parties. The first is a Parrish 4th
party. For those who are questioning the walk up all those stairs, just
ask Austin Harris, he does it everyday. These parties are always
packed and fun for everybody, except those who live there. The other
option on Friday is a party In Upper Tarbie, preceeded by a talent

plays catchy executions of difficult songs,
under the leadership ofKevin Schlottmann.
The Thelonious Monk theme of the first
evening was gladly accepted and well executed. The serious, occasionally latin-inflected jazz, with the masquerading transsexual waitrons, Peter Vella's Delicious Red
wine, and Old Milwaukee Ice beeradd a touch
ofclass to Olde Clubbe.
In the end, Cabaret moves to prove they
are still subversive. Anna Fricke delivers
a searing Swarthmore "end of the world"
apocalpyse solliloquy, invoking sex death
cops and art charging a passive campus to
take action. Once again, Cabaret lulls the
audience into a humoured stupor, only to
shift the final scene into strange serious-

ness. This beatniky buddhistic incitement
to life and art seems out of step only because of its direct tone. When the issue
was rape, as in a previous Cabaret, the d\-~.
rect heaviness could be more easily justified
here they might have lightened their hand. But
it sure is sweeping, and perhaps true.
Conversation with the audience after-:
wards reflects mostly a desire for more
(assumedly lighthearted) Swarthmore-specific
content, for which Cabaret has a well-deserved
reputation. Taking on the BBC requires a different set of expectations; at least this time,
Cabaret has an alcohol permit.
(Cabaret plays at Olde Clubbe November 7 and
at Bpm. You must be over the age of 21 to consume

Field Hockey ties for Conference title; hosts ECAC's
By

Jean Quinn

The field hockey team whipped
Haverford this week, 8-1, to close out their
regular season schedule. The win placed
the Garnet in a three way tie for first place
in the Centennial Conference with Washington and Gettysburg, making this the
first time there have ever been tri-conference champions. A 17-2 overall record
was not enough to garner a spot for the
Garnet in the NCAA tournament though.
Instead, the team will host the ECAC tournament this weekend.
The contest against Haverford, postponed from an earlierdate because of poor
field conditions, came a day after the team
received the unpleasant news that had not

received a bid into the national tournament.
Washington and Rowan, the teams to
whom the Garnet fell, did advance into
NCAA action though. The disappointment, however, did not affect the team's
playing or drive to win. "We had a very
successful game against Haverford. We
dominated start to finish and didn't play
down to their level which is the goal we
set after our Bryn Mawr game. Everyone
on the team contributed," said Coach
Karen Borbee.
Danielle Duffy '9B accounted for four
goals and one assist, while Holly Baker
'99 scored two goals and also picked up
an assist. Donna Griffin '99 and Becca
Stites 'OO each put one past the Fords'
goalkeeper in the outing as well. It was

an exciting day all around, as many of
the Garnet players received all-conference honors. Duffy was named the Conference Player of the Year for the third
year in a row. She led the Centennial
Conference in overall (22-21-65) and
Conference (9-9-27) scoring this fall. In
her career, she notched 26 goals and 39
assists for 91 points in Centennial
matches all of which are conference
records.
Joining Duffy on the first team are
midfielder Baker and defensive back
Michelle Walsh '9B. Baker was the
conference's second-leading scorer with
15-13-43, while Walsh anchored a defense that permitted only six goals in
eight conference games. Lurah Hess '99
-

finished third in the conference for scoring, with 19 goals and 2 assists for 40
points, which earned her a spot on the
second all-conference team. Sweeper
Hagan was also named to the second
team, and defensive back Jamie Flather
'OO was named honorable mention.
The win translated into a three way tie
for the Conference title. Swarthmore,
Washington, and Gettysburg all had 8-1
records in the conference. "We are very
proud to have won the Centennial Conference for the third consecutive time,
even if it is shared with two other
schools. It doesn't take away from the
significance of the honor," said Borbee.
Swarthmore, the number one seed in
the ECAC tournament, hosts two days

of competition this weekend. At 11am
Saturday, the Garnet face Drew, whom
they defeated in the regular season 4-0.
The winner will meet the winner of
Gettysburg vs. William Patterson on
Sunday. The Garnet beat Gettysburg
during the regular season 5-2. "We are
hoping to win the ECAC tournament,"
said Borbee. "I know the players are
very disappointed in not being selected
to go to the NCAA tournament, so I hope
they can get themselves motivated to
play their best. If they do, I have every
confidence that we can be the first team
at Swarthmore to win an ECAC Championship." All are invited to attend the
ECAC games this weekend on
Cunningham Fields.

Garnet Tide losing streak
extends to 18 games
Tootell breaks Division 111 kickoff return records
By

Pat

Donaghy

The Garnet Tide saw its record fall to 08 on the season after a 41-0 defeat at the
hands of Franklin and Marshall Saturday.
All the points were scored in the first half,
as the losing streak has now hit 18,and the
conference losing streak is at 13.
Due to many injuries suffered in the last
couple weeks, the Tide dressed only 27
players against the army of Diplomats.
Many key injuries to the offense caused
Swarthmore to have problems moving the
ball all day. Swarthmore never threatened
a score throughout the game, compiling
less than 150 total yards in the fifth shutout of the season.
Mason Tootell '99 did manage to extend
his streak of catching at least one pass to
21 games, tops in the conference. Tootell

also broke the Division 111 record for kickoff returns and kickoff return yardage in a
season. He is on pace to break the NCAA
records for both.
On the defensive side of the ball, the team
continued to be physical. In the absence of
linebacker Tucker Zengerle 'OO, freshman
Mike Hopper topped the squad with 12
tackles, earning him a spot on the conference honor roll. Alex DeShields '9B, who
joined the squad in the wake of lost players, added 11 tackles in his first collegiate
game. Matt Asano 'Ol had the hit of the
year on the Diplomat quarterback.
The Tide's next game is Saturday afternoon against nationally ranked Western
Maryland. The game is also senior day,
honoring seniors Ben Hall, Bernard
Nossuli, Pete Karacki, Aaron Hultgren and
Alex DeShields, who will be playing in
their last home game.

also a surprising day for Jeff Doyon 'OO
took to the course like a crazed hyena, finished his first conference meet placing 47th
at 31:06. The cagy veteran Phil Jones '99
placed 49th at 31:14. Senior captain Wyn
"Egon" Strodtbeck, the all wise maharishi
of the distance squad, placed 55th at 31:41.
Marc Neirman 'Ol, new freshman sensation, finished 65th at 32:18, and Derek "I
sneer Bruzewicz 'OO finished in 32:35.
Rounding off the rest of the team was the
pack of some of the most spirited and determined runners known to man: Ambrose
Dieringer 'Ol, Dan Schwartz 'OO, Nevin
Katz '99, Gene Yoshida '99, and senior
captain JeffLockman '9B, Lorrin Nelson
'OO, Seth Steed 'Ol, and Dan Marrin 'Ol.
The Swat women ended up capturing a
highly impressive second place, out of ten
teams. Placing second and third was the
dynamic duo of Joko Agunloye 'Ol and
senior captain Danielle Wall '9B, who came

The Swarthmore women's rugby team
travelled to West Chester University on
Sunday to play two games. In the A-side
game, West Chester emerged victorious by
defeating Swat with a score of 19-3. Unfortunately, the B-side game followed the
same tragic path with a score of 10-0 even
though the squadplayed an improved game
over the first.
The only Swat points of the day were
scored by Beth Wiles '9B, during the first
half of the A-side game. The score, however, does not accurately represent the true
nature of the contest. Swarthmore played
a hard game and many individuals played
well.
Alexa Miller 'OO played a strong game
at 8-man, recovering remarkably well after being viciously attacked by a rabid U.
Del player last weekend. Meghan Brennan
'OO however, was not so lucky as to escape
the ravenous jaws of a West Chester player;
she played extremely well at scrum half,
none the less, getting the ball out to the
backs despite the perilous weather conditions.
Swat's back line battled through the wet
rain and managed to produce spouts offan-

tastic offense. Cathy Vaughan 'Ol and
Morgan Kelly '9B both made important
tackles at the wing positions. Becky
Danielle
Snyder '9B was forced to join
Thomas '99 on the sidelines after she aggressively pushed an opponent out of
bounds. Sarah Cross '99 was thus forced
to try her fifth position for the season, tighthead prop, while Rhiana Swartz 'OO took
on the loose-head prop position.
The B-side squad put up a valiant effort
against the savage West Chester opponents.
Liz Meehan 'Ol won the ball often as
hooker in the sadistic scrums. Marisa
Chavez 'Ol provided the much needed support and force for the scrum to bowl over
the forward antagonists. Charity Miller '9B
played well at scrum half for the B-side
game while making a significant impact in
theA-side game, where she returned to her
native position offlanker. The B-side second row duo of Sandra Schrauf '9B and
Sandra'Albero 'Ol (AKA Sandra squared)
held the strong Swat scrum together and
dominated the game's lineouts. The B-side
back line played with heart for the entire
game. Erica Anderson 'Ol and Ursula
Lang 'OO had incredible tackles which kept
Swat in the game up until the lastfew minsee RUGBY, A

The harriers of Swat Cross Country entered into the Championship season this
weekend as they took to the infamous
Ursinus Course, which on race day consisted of multiple laps around a wild wilderness engulfed in wind, rain, and mud.
The process of running Cross Country
encompasses a great many things. Before
the race, it is staying mentally confident
and preparing oneselfmentally for any type
of terrain or racing conditions. During the
race, it is pushing through physical pain
and mental barriers, and running strategically. From a coach's standpoint, it is keeping together a pack of runners who will
work together to pick off jersey after jersey. Throughout the season, it is working
day after day to improve stamina, speed,
and spirit.
In addition to the process, one of the most
notable things about Swarthmore Cross

Country is the people who build the team.
The personalities that provide the support
and work ethic needed for a successful season stretch throughout the top 7 and beyond; by the time the leaves begin to
change color, every runner has developed
a vital role on the team. This past conference meet marked the last time where these
teams would be fighting together as a
whole, under the expert guidance of Head
Coach Ted Dixon and Assistant Coach
Ingrid "Surprise!" Spies.
Amidst disgustingly sloppy conditions,
the Garnet runners stepped up to the line,
ready to compete amongst hordes of dirty
and ferocious athletes; a task that not only
required supreme cardiovascularendurance
and mental determination, but also enough
finesse to negotiate mounds of mud that
were scattered over the course. Sam Evans
'Ol, new freshman harrier, was 15th at
29:30. GrahamLucks '9B, senior who has
been a vital part of the top 7 for four years,
fought his way into 28th at 30:03. It was

team went 0 and 2 this week in a couple of
tough matches. On Saturday, the team,
minus three key players traveled to
Muhlenberg to play the Mules. Jedi Knight

Lewis and Mike "The Admiral" Schall
were out because of too many card, and
James "The Punisher" Chen had GRE's.
After a wet and sloppy game, the game
ended with the Mules up by a touchdown.
On Wednesday, the Washington College
Shoremen came to Swarthmore for (he men's
last home match. Things started out great
for Swat. Three minutes into the game,
Marcus "Who's Your Daddy?" Shin blasted
the ball into the back of the net off an assist
by Chen. Swarthmore maintained control
throughout most of the first half, but Washington College managed to sneak in a goal.
Then in the second half, the Shoremen put
in two more goals. Swarthmore had many
shots and a goal that was disallowedbecause
of a shady offsides call. When asked to comment on Wednesday's game, Schall said "It
[is a real shame] we didn't win our last home
game this season."
This Saturday is Swarthmore men's
soccer's last game of the season. At 1:00,
they travel to Haverford to settle bragging
rights for the year with the Fords.

After poor conditions postponed the
Haverford game on Saturday, the Garnet
began the Monday game excited and ready
for theirrival. The first half remained tied
at 0-0 due to Swat's strong defensive play.
Sarah Jaquette showed her versatility by
replacing the team's injured sweeper. Jen
VanderVeer continued her consistent play
on defense.
With the game tied, the Tide were hoping for a victory. They began the second
half, with what many thought was a goal.
Unfortunately, the goal was called back
because the referee did not believe that after it hit the crossbar it fell in front of, rather
than in, the goal. With this low, Haverford
was able to knock in two goals. The final
score thus read 2-0.
The season ends with the team believing
it was a positive one with a special emphasis on defense.
According to one of the captains, "the
team showed commitment and desire to
play."
With four first-years starting and contributing, Swarthmore remains a young team,
with hopes of improvement next year.
