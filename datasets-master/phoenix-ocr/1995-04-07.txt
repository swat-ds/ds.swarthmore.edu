Gay Swat Student
Battles for Right
to Donate Blood
By JulieFalk
"For men: Have you ever, even
once, had sex with a man since 1977?"
When Andrew Marino '96 read this
question he knew he could lie, but he
didn't. Because Marino answered
"yes" at the Red Cross blood drive in
Tarble-in-Clothier last Thursday,
March 30, he was told he could not
donate blood that day or any other,
but that he could set aside blood for
his own use.
Marino said the American Red
Cross representative was understanding after her initial look of surprise.
"She thanked me for having my heart
in the right place." But Marino, astonished and hurt, needed to ask her
some questions. "If I were a heterosexual who admitted to having promiscuous unprotected sex, would I

I have never cried

—Andrew Marino

He learned that donor criteria are
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. "I asked why the homo-

sexual community was discriminated
against, and I was told it was because

the homosexual community has the
highest percentage of the AIDS/
HIV," Marino said.
Prompted both by what he felt was
outright discrimination and by a con-

cern that there were no questions
about unprotected sex on any of the
forms, Marino consulted Assistant
Deanand Equal-Opportunity Officer
Fernando Chang-Muy, and Gender
Education Advisor Karen Henry.
Marino initially considered using
his situation as a test case but Chang
Muy advised him to "stay within the
system" for the time being. "It would
be virtually impossible to win this
case as [the borough of] Swarthmore
does not have an equal protection
clause," saidMarino. "Fernandosuggested that I go into Philadelphia to
donate...because cities likePhiladelphia which have large gay populations have clauses in their equal rights
code against discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation."
On Monday, April 3, Marino went
to the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, where he again attempted to
donate blood. Once again he responded affirmatively to the question concerning homosexual activity
since 1977. "But this lady was a
bitch," said Marino. "She said the
AIDS epidemic started because of
the gay community. She had no right
to give me her personal opinion." In
a telephone interview with The Phoenix, the woman in question declined

Briefly
Noted
New Computer
Named "Condor"
The staff and officers of the
Swarthmore College Computer
Society (SCCS) voted this week
to name their new UNIX workstation "Condor," in the process
spawning anew Swarthmore tradition of naming UNIX servers
after birds of prey. Runner-up in
the vote was "Osprey."
"I'm not sure how I feel about
the name Condor, but it sure is a
lotbetter thanOsprey," said Nick
Lehmann '97. "Osprey reminds
me of a big-beaked chicken running around laying eggs all over
the place."
Condor will supplement Raptor in Fall 1995. The new machine will handle student and faculty UNIX accounts, as well as
many of the other services Raptor currently provides. Raptor's
responsibilities will be narrowed
to managing the popular student
World Wide Web pages—a task
now overwhelming the machine.
Said Geoffrey Noer '95, President of SCCS, "A lot of work
must be done by SCCS system
administrators until the new system is ready for use. We will
workhard to ensure thatthe transition to the new machine is as
invisible and painless to our users as possible."

ML First Floor Will
House Only Frosh
RA Protests Housing Committee Decision
By Eugene Sonn
When the list of dorm rooms available in this year' s room-choosing was
posted on March 27th, something was
missing—every room on Mary
Lyon's first floor. As part of Housing
Director Myrt Westphal's plan to
stress dorm cohesion over hall bonding, only first-year and transfer students will live on that hall; no firstyears will live in ML's basement.
Deciding to ban sophomores, juniors, and seniors from ML first floor
came at the end of a string of ideas on
how to change the rooming situation
for the incoming class, said Westphal.
She said the Housing Committee considered making Willets an all firstyear dorm and banning frosh from
ML altogether.
In the end, "we thought that putting the new students together would
help create a tight-knit community at
a dorm rather than a hall level,"
Westphal said.
Jonathan Evans '96, the Resident
Assistant assigned to ML first floor
next year, saidhe "really felt strongly
about [an all new student hall]. I
think it goes against Swarthmore
policy to have an all frosh hall."
Evans met with Westphal in an
attempt to change her mind, but she
stood firm, he said. "She was nice
about the whole thing, but they're

trying to change the personalities of
the dormsand this is part of theplan."
Unsatisfied with his meeting with
Westphal, Evans met with Assistant
Dean Tedd Goundie, who oversees
the RAs, on Wednesday. Evans said
Goundie was receptive to his objec-

tions and that he promised to discuss
the issue with Westphal.
"I'm not trying togo over anyone's
head here," said Evans, "I just want
to see if we can change this. One of
the best things I liked when I came
here is that there aren't any frosh
dorms."
Despite his objections, Evans has
been meeting with the other ML RAs
for next year, Josh Silver '97, Ingrid
Spies '96 and Maria Barker '96, to
assure the dorm bonds as a whole.
"I think if it's all freshmen the
people really won'tget toother halls,"
said Robin Canada '96, the current
ML first RA.
YetCanada also said, "It wouldbe
fun as all freshmenbecause thehall is
conducive to hall bonding. It's open
and wide, with space to hang out.
With similarwork loads, agreeing on
quiet hours would be easier."
"Most of my friends in this dorm
live in thesecond floor first-year section," said JeffreyLockman '9B, who
lives on the first floor. He thinks the
all-frosh hall could be a good idea if
it works out like the first-year wing
of the second floor.

Gypsyamber Berg-Cross '96 was
of 18 people from across the
country to receive a Gold CongressionalAward in a ceremony on March
28 at the U.S. Capitol.
The award recognizes young
Americans who set and achieve major individual goals in volunteer service, self-development, physical fitness, and "expeditions," which are
projects involving exploration of the
environment or other cultures.
Berg-Cross was honored for over
600 hours of volunteer work as an

last spring and as an coordinator of
Swarthmore's Chester Tutorial program, as well as for participation on

Costa Rica.
While in high school, Berg-Cross
won the Bronze Congressional
Award, a similar prize for students
achieving smaller goals. A teacher at
her school suggested thatshe participate in the program; she agreed because "these are all things that I was
involved with anyway, and I was
willing to do the paperwork."

various criteria such as research experience and academic record. He
added that theawards are also spread

senators and representatives.

"I feel very fortunate," Peck said.
"I'm very excited." He said the award
is a nice honor to have as well as a
convenient one. The money, he explained, will give him more flexibility in choosing an area of research
and a course of study.

Juniors Win Education Fellowships
By Phoenix Staff

Two Swarthmore students are
among 25 nationwide who have won
Rockefeller Brothers Fund Fellowships for minority students entering
the teaching profession.
Alison McKenzie '96 and Tanya
Wiggins '96 will each receive stipends of up to $2500 to undertake
teaching-related projects during this
summer. After they graduate, they
will receive up to $lB,OOO to attend
graduate school in education or a

related field.

No Strike Here

Wiggins plans to get a master's
degree in education after she graduates from Swarthmore next year.
"The Rockefeller helped me get a
door to graduate school," Wiggins
said. "Graduate school will help me
round out my ideas [about education]
further."
McKenzie has not finalized her
post-graduation plans yet.
EachRockefellerFellow must have

Wiggins's is educationprofessor Eva

Opinions
Considering an "Eclipse" of Values Too Tempted by
Television? Tune in

have welcomed the statement. Others, including Planned
Parenthood, have denounced it. Students at Swarthmore holdmany different views; it would be interesting
to see the response here.
The letter says this situation is due to "the profound
crisis of culture, which generates skepticism in relations to the very foundations of knowledge and ethics.... Then there are all kinds of existential and inter-

personal difficulties, made worse by the complexity of
a society in which individuals, couples and families are

often left alone with their problems. There are situations of acute poverty, anxiety or frustration in which
the struggle to make ends meet, the presence of unbearable pain, or instances of violence, especially against

women, make the choice to defend and promote life so
demanding as sometimes toreach thepoint ofheroism."

This is indeed a discouraging view of the world. An
important question to ask seems to be, are we really
suffering a "profound crisis ofculture"? Is the value of
life undergoing an "eclipse?" Are economic and political forces and growing societal complexity creating a
"structure of sin?"Is this really happening to us? If it is,
what are we to do about it? Can it be reversed?
What a terrifying description. After we graduate from
Swarthmore, we will want to build our lives, but such a
description may well cause us to feelbeaten even before
we start.But perhaps the situation is not so lost. Perhaps
there is a solution.
In the letter, the solution to these problems is offered
as, "Christians, like all persons of good will, are called
upon under grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which, even if permitted by
civil legislation, are contrary to God's law."
This may be a solution (though, to be sure, many
devout Christians disagree with the parameters set by
the Church and must make choices that differ from

those prescribed in this letter). There may be other
solutions. But there must be some solution.The assertion that our world is wrapped in despair could leave us
feeling empty-handed. But, because we are resourceful,
creative human beings, we are not empty-handed. Even
if what the encyclical letter describes is true today, it
does not have to be true in the future.

On March30, Pope John Paul U issued an encyclical
letter to the Catholic Church. Its direct influence on a
huge number of people throughout the world makes it
an important document In it, the Pope paints societal
dilemmas in the starkest terms. These issues challenge
us all, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.
In it, he says, "the value oflife can today undergo a
kind of 'eclipse,'... we are confronted by... a veritable
structure of sin. This culture is actively fostered by the
powerful culturaleconomic and political currents which
encourage an idea of society excessively concerned
with efficiency."
From these assertions, he proceeds to a critique of
ethical relativism, abortion, euthanasia, and the death
penalty. The New YorkTimes printed excerpts from the
letter and an article about its reception in the US. Some
groups, including Catholic leaders, says the article,

|,

To the Editor:

I contend that Ms. Charry's comon the predicament of black
America in "Reexamining..." (3/24/
95) correctly describe the situation
and one of the most fundamental facets of its solution.
Ms. Charry's description of the
"permanent dysfunction [which]
hampers members of minority
groups" is reminiscent of Cornel
West. Regarding nihilism in black
America, especially those at the bottom of the social ladder, he states:
"The proper starting point for the
crucial debateabout theprospects for
black America is an examination of
the nihilism that increasingly pervades black communities. Nihilism
is ...the lived experience of coping
with a life ofhorrifyingmeaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness. The frightening
result is a numbing detachmentfrom
others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world. Life without
meaning, hope, and love breeds a
coldhearted, mean-spirited outlook
that destroys both the individual and
others." (Emphasis by C.W.)
The solution is, in part: "cultural
structures of meaning and feeling that
ments

created and sustained communities;

this armor constituted ways of life

and struggle thatembodied values of
service and sacrifice, love and care,
discipline and excellence.... Tradi-

tions for blacks surviving and thriving.. . were major barriers against the

nihilistic threat These traditions consist primarily ofblack religious and
civic institutions that sustained familial and communal networks of
support." (Emphasis, here and below, is mine.)
"If one begins with the threat of
concrete nihilism, then one must talk
about some kind of politics of conversion.... Like alcoholism..., nihilism is a disease of the soul. It can
never be completely cured, and there
is always thepossibility ofrelapse....
Nihilism is not overcome by arguments or analyses [although they are
indispensable]; it is tamed by love
and care. Any disease of the soul
must be conquered by a turning of
one's soul...done through one's own
affirmation of one's worth—an affirmation fueled by the concern of
others. A love ethic must be at the
center of a politics of conversion."
[Race Matters, 1994]
So, when Ms. Charry speaks of
the "deeper" problems of Black
America for which Affirmative Action is only an unmedicated bandaid, I applaud her concern and honesty. The strong support network of
the family is critical for Black
America. As Ms. Charry said,
"Strong families produce strong children. Strong children grow up to be
strong adults." The dysfunction
which she pointed out in her editorial is not "innate" or "inherent." It
is, as she described, a problem of
"racially based disadvantage" which
has been "institutionalized" and
which "keeps minority groups from
progressing on the socioeconomic
ladder." In the case of the individual,

which those in
the know call not
"the tease" (you
know, for ex-1
ample, "Swarthmore goes Greek"
film at eleven). The tease is the most
manipulative of all commercials;
through overstating the content of
what it is really advertising it commands you to tune in.

it "can never be completely cured," as
West says, because one's childhood
is lived only once and then all one has
is memories and consequences. When
a child isborn into such a system, that
child is raised in nihility When such
problems eat away at those whom you
love and who love you, you are left

Yet, I strongly disagree with one of
Ms. Charry's statements. It's true,
"these childrenhave the cards stacked

grounds upon which to say, "They are
born already failed." This statement
is unacceptable. It ignores theresilience of humanity, especially if one

it is not the only factor. To the contrary, it is inpredicaments where common sense says there is no possibility

"When it comes down to basics,"
Ms. Charry said, "the issue is how a

opportunities would be available to
minorities and whites alike without
bias. Since this isn't a perfect world,
realize that those positions "lost" by
the white segment of our population
were never rightfully theirs to begin
with. A progressive reform of AA,
although crucial and urgently needed,
is neither enough nor the greatest
challenge. That distinction, as West
noted, belongs toLove.
A "love ethic" begins with families and communities working within
a strong cultural context of religious
and civic institutions that provide
meaning, hope and, above all, love. If
our goal is to effect genuine change
in the lives of young people, then we
need leaders and role models to act as
signposts along our way, pointing us
in the right direction.
I don'tbelieve I stray too far from
West's own perspective in recommending Jesus as one of those leaders and role models. I may, perhaps,
be really straying away by urging
that Jesus is the best of all possible
sources for that love ethic. If so, then
I stray and I urge.

In an article in Last week's Phoenix Tara Zahra portayed the welfare
debate between the SwarthmoreCollege Democrats and the Conservative Union as uninformative and amateurish. The article highlighted a
quote from one person at the debate
(who left immediately after he made
his comment) who said that hedidn't
learn anything at the debate he
couldn't have read in journals.I was
shocked to see this portrayal of the
informative, fast-paced, and interesting debate that I had attended.
The debaters themselves were
well-prepared and argued clearly and
powerfully for their sides. The room
was quite full (I had to stand). Some
of the audience remained afterwards
for the question and answer session.

The generic voice-over says something like, "What's the big question

the police erred when they saw his

something along that logic.

was discovered in the Niger delta
about 35 years ago, the Ogoni lands
have borne the brunt of the ruthless

made annually, theirpart of the country is still generally caught up in the

him wrong.
The New York Times in its Tuesday 28th March issue ran a story that
attempted to chronicle the Nigerian
Government's war against its own
people. Nigerians are viewed by their
government as no better than feudal
vassals; each succeeding general has
run the country like a personal
fiefdom. For the past two years, the
Nigerian military has embarked on a
systematic campaign bordering on
genocide designed to crush opposition among the Ogoni people who
live in the oilrich Niger Delta. Their
rationale? The Ogoni people, being
the "bloody civilians" and "ungrateful brats" that they are, are protesting
the massive environmental damage
oil drilling and natural gas flaring

and ShellPetroleum DevelopCompany, the region's main
foreign oil firm, to compensate them
for their losses.
In reply, the government sent in
storm troopers with strict instructions to "rape, maim and kill," and
take whatever steps the company
commander deemed necessary to repulse the advance of the enemy. Note
the language used here. It is deliberate given that the Nigerian government told its troops that they were
been sent to Ogoniland to repulse an
invasion ofCamerounian troops into
Nigeria. One of the most prominent
leaders of the Ogonis has been tried
for murder. Observers have come to
the conclusion that the trial is being
conducted using manufactured evidence, and is a classic attempt to
deprive the Ogonis' of their most
notable leader.
The madness of the military is not
restricted to Nigeria. At a congresment,

sional hearing held a few days ago, a
U.S. State Department official
pointed out that most of the cocaine,
heroin and other drugs currently entering the United States are transited
through Nigeria. Furthermore, in Nigeria today exists what is perhaps the
most sophisticated drug courier recruitment systems and money laundering system. Controlled by local
henchmen of the infamous Carli cartel, the drug operations out of Nigeria, U.S. officials claim, could not
have grown without governmental
assistance. Latin American, Asian,
European, and African couriers are
recruited by Nigerian handlers for a
massive global operation whose
worth is believed to be in the tens of
billions of dollars.
What does all this mean for the
average Swattie ? Remember the last
time you went to a gas station? Who
owned the station? Elf, Total, Mobile, Texaco, Shell, Chevron, Gulf
Oil, Agip, or Standard Oil? Nigeria
supplies 10% of the daily United
States gasoline consumption. 1do not

you pay for gas, part of it is returned
to a sunglasses-wearing, gun-toting
junta, who would stop at nothing,
including genocide, to ensure that
OPEC approved 1.75 million barrels
of oil continues to flow.
The reality is that it is principally
the average American that continues
to prop up a regime that prides itself
on its ability to outdo the Argentine
military's "dirty wars." Many may
not know it but the foreign oil firm's
stringent defense of the junta in diplomatic circles last summer ensured
that the world maintained a tacit silence when the tanks rolled out to

perform a form of the 1989 "Chinese
Solution" on the oil-workers union.
Again, their sin was to call for democracy, and enlightened use of
Nigeria's oil wealth, particularly with
respect to the minorities of the Niger
delta.

Swarthmore Needs Real Liberalism, Not Relativism
By Youngjae Lee

Two weeks ago, Brian Schwartz wrote a
piece in whichhe challenged liberals to "check
[their] premises" before espousing both tolerance and socialism. His argument goes something like this: Liberals say they value tolerance, and they criticize conservatives for being
intolerant. But liberals are as intolerant as conservatives because they believe in taxation.
Taxation is intolerant because it forces me to
spend my money to support what other people
value. Therefore, liberals are imposing their
values on other people and are thus being
intolerant. The only kind of economic and
political system consistent with the liberal virtue of tolerance is laissez-faire capitalism. So,
take your pick. Give up tolerance or espouse
libertarianism.
Of course, this argument cannot be taken
seriously. It is clear that Schwartz has confused
tolerance with insanity. But there is something
interesting about this argument, and it is his
presupposition that having a belief in any value
shouldbe condemned because it is intolerant. It
is puzzling that Schwartz does not count libertarianism as an "intolerant" value system that
he wants to impose on other people. But that is
not the topic of this letter. I thinkKate Atkins'

devastating critique in the 3/31/95 issue ofThe
Phoenix dealtwith this aspect quite adequately.
Seeing this, Atkins points out that tolerance
andrelativism are conflated in Schwartz's mind.
And what is disturbing about this is that, as
Atkins againrighdy points out, many Swarthmore students sufferfrom the same confusion.
Atkins writes that many at Swarthmore believethat "it is reactionary to hold any value as
true because values allow repression of those
who donot share them."Here, although I could
be wrongabout her intentions, I believe thatshe
is expressing her frustration with those whom I
will call neo-Nietzscheans who frequently invoke Derrida and Foucault's theories to oppose
any kind of espousal and justification of any
system of values.These people argue that any
judgments of worth are oppressive because
they are being imposed by and perpetuate the
existing power structure. Moreover, all judgments of worth are invalid because they are
based on standards derived from, abused by,
and in order to benefit, those with power—mainly white males. Roughly, this form of
relativism is the philosophical backbone of
liberalism and its argument for tolerance on
this campus today. I suggest that this is also the
source of Schwartz's confusion of tolerance
with relativism.

Relativism is a bad argument for tolerance. fluence and manipulate people, then I don't see

Scientifically Dissecting a Hairy Issue
By Bob Yang

It is a well known myth that women gradufrom Swarthmore with their hair six inches
shorter while men graduate with their hair six
inches longer. In the past few weeks I have
noticed a trend for women to cut their hair
short This made me wonder if the short hair
myth about women is well founded, and if so,
why the trend exists on Swarthmore Campus.
After a civilized discussion with my hallmates
a few days ago about whether women would
look better with longer hair or shorter hair, I
decided to take it upon myself to investigate
the general opinion about the length of women's hair on the Swarthmore Campus.
Many of you may have seen or heard me in
Sharpies, in lab, on the way to classes, etc.
asking the question, "What percentage of
women do you think look better with longer
hair as opposed to shorter hair?" I can hear the
groans from the people reading this article
already. I have to admit that I am a bit biased
toward women

ble while so that the results could be a true
reflection of the Swarthmore population, and
not of my personal opinion.
I asked 101 men and 101 women their opinion on the hair issue. The mean for women
was 53%. This shows that women think that
about half of the women population looks better with longer hair while the other half looks
better with shorter hair. The mean for men was
72%; men think 72% of women look better
with longer hair while 28% look better with
shorter hair. There is a definite discrepency
between women and men's responses. In fact,
the range of replies for women was between
0% and 85% while that for men's was between
10% and 100%. The fact that more women
than men think that women look better with
shorter hair may be a step in explaining the
recent trend of women with haircuts. If one
looks at the histogram of responses from men
and women, one can see that the women's
responses are normally distributed so that the
mean is a good indicator of average opinion.
The men's responses, on the other hand, are
skewed left. The mean may be pulled down by
a few outliers to the left, and the average
men's opinion may be
higher than what the
mean reveals.

original question would have said "longer" to
the new question. If this assumption is true,
then 43% of women would think that women
look better with longer hair while 86% of men
would think so. However, I think this result
does not reflect the degree to which people
prefer longer hair to shorter hair, and that the
result from the former study may be a more
accurate reflection of people's opinion.
By now, people must be ready to tear me
and this article apart Many people may argue
that theresult has no definitebasis because not
everyone on campus was polled. The "my
answer would have changed the mean" arguement may be countered by using a nifty tool
called the t-test, which I am sure many people
have grown to love. Even though the men's
responses are not normally distributed, the ttest can be used because the sample size is
greater than the cut off point of 36 responses.
A 95% confidence interval was obtained. This
means that I can say with 95% confidence that
if everyone on campus was asked the hair
question, the mean for women would fall within the interval from 50% to 57% while the
men's mean would fall between 69% to 76%.
I am sure that most of us have thought about
the question of whether women look better
with longer or shorter hair from one time to
another. As Swatties, I think that most of us
hate to leave questions unanswered. In fact,
the purpose of this poll is not to tell women
what to do with their hair. This is merely a
study that satisfies my intellectual curiosity
about what women and men thought about the
length of women's hair. Therefore, people can
draw whatever conclusions they wantfrom the
results that I have presented. Perhaps now people can also resolve discussions about women's hair length more scientifically rather than
subjectively.

Serving Life in Shawshank and Murder

I

The obvious predecessor to John Dahl's
1992 Red Rock West is Joel and Ethan Coen's
1984 film Blood Simple, which also tells the
story of a man caught up in a husband's plans
to murder his wife. Several ofRed Rock's settings could have been lifted directly from the
earlier film, and Dennis Hopper's performance
as the hit man is clearly modeled on Joe Don
Baker's in Blood.
Red Rock West lacks the visual originality
and moral depth ofBlood Simple, but compen-

Hopper. His direction is solid, if glossy and
unexceptional, and the film moves at a good
clip.
A crappy, perfunctory ending aside, Red
Rock West is a solid, entertaining piece of
fluff, and with the ugly prospect of Jurassic

Park 2 lurking on the horizon, that's praise
enough.
Red Rock West shows Friday in

joyously convoluted plot which had me giggling with each new development. I can't give
away too much of it here, since most of the fun
of watching Red Rock West comes from
watching the plot unfold, but the story begins
when a drifter named Michael (Nicholas Cage)
walks into a bar in Wyoming, and the bartender (J.T. Walsh) asks him to kill his wife.
When Michael later confronts the bartender's
wife (Lara Flynn Boyle) with this information,
she thanks him demurely, and casually asks
him, as long as he's here, would he mind "taking care" of her husband?
While none of the performances are exceptional, Dahl is to be congratulated for almost
drawing a real performance out of Dennis

Also showing this weekend
(Saturday, in DuPont) is The
Shawshank Redemption, an adaptation of a Stephen King novella
in which prisoners bond while
serving life sentences. On the
grounds that this story may hit
a little too close to home for
some Swatties, I turn instead
to another Stephen King
adaptation playing out in the
big world, this one called
Dolores Claiborne, currently
playing at AMC Marple.
Dolores (Kathy Bates) and her daughter
Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) are reunited
after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of
murder. Selena is a pill-popping big-city journalist who can't stand her small-town mother,
Dolores a tough-talking small-town widow
who can't understand why her daughter hates
her. To make matters worse, the investigator
assigned to Dolores's case (Christopher
Plummer) is the same one who investigated
her husband's "accidental" death twenty years
ago.
Needless to say, he doesn't believe her husband's deathwas an accident—and after a few

of Dolores Claiborne's numerous flashback
segments, we don't either. Her husband (the
normally genial David Strathairn) was a
vicious, abusive clod who responds to his
wife's jibes by beating her with a piece offirewood.
With a past as easily exploitable as this, the
film spends precious little time in the present,
sometimes as little as thirty seconds between
flashbacks. Director Taylor Hackford
uses a series of visual gimmicks to shuttle between past and present, which
might work better if Dolores weren't
shot so clumsily. The constant
switching between time frames
begins to seem mechanical;
scenes end arbitrarily, and flashI backs start to overlap, revealing
things we've already figured out.
But the final sequence, in which
the true circumstances of
Dolores's husband's death are
revealed, packs a wallop,
thanks to powerful performances from Bates and
Strathairn.
Jennifer
Jason Leigh,
maybe the best young actress
in films, is buried under mounds of poorly-lit
pancake, and saddled with a joyless, monotonous part. She gives it a good try, but there's
no transcending this material.
Bates is more successful, and Plummer is
zestfully nasty, but the film can't gather up

Water: Good Music for the Shower
By Eugene Sonn

On their major-label debut, Water blends sweet vocal harmonies
catchy pop guitar lines to make Nipple an excellent freshman
release.
The band's line-up is pretty straight forward. Mark Cohen plays
bass and sings backing vocals, Dean Bradley sings and plays guitar,
John Guest is on the drums and Howie rounds out the group on guitar. Water's basic line-up gives it a hint of indy-rock sound, but it's
too polished to have strong punk influences.
Though their lyrics are confusing and sometimes inane, the words
to the songs on Nipple are largely unimportant because they only distract you from the gorgeous interwoven vocals of lead singer Bradley
and back-up man Cohen. The shower is a perfect spot to listen to this
album since the falling water makes the lyrics unintelligible enough
to focus solely on the music.
In the song "A Moon's Afterlife" we hear the words "Come on
down to my place, we'll hollow our wheels tonight." These lyrics are
typical ofWater when the band tries to be too deep and the words just
turn out confusing. Super-cheesy phrases such as "we're all from the
same seed" in the song "Seeds," make me think the band is trying to
branch out and create a neo-hippie following.
Water's best lyrics are the simple ones which express emotions.
Though the harmonies and guitar make you think they're going to
launch into Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird," the best part of the song
"Strained" is the line "I'm strained" which stretches over a long.
with

beautiful harmony executed with ironic ease.
Despite what their press-package says, it seems the band
agrees that the lyrics are not too important. Throughout the
liner notes, images are superimposed on the lyrics making
some words impossible to read. Other lyrics are shown
hand-written, complete with cross-outs, inserts, and parentheses.

The eighth song, "Hobo Junktown," is the highlight of
the album for its simple melody and forward yet not
oppressive drumming. The guitar complements Bradley's
voice perfectly to make a new harmony. Even the lyrics
are minimal so as not to interfere with the music.
The lead-off song, "Thoughts," shifts back and forth
between a harmony-laden chorus and guitar-driven
verses which build energy and tension only to be ;
released again in the chorus. "Deep" begins with the i
almost mandatory distorted guitar intro but follows the J

College Budget Committee plans and draws
up the college's yearly operating budget which
includes funding for such things as salary

Gabriel BenjaminFernandez '9B
I should be on College Budget Committee
because I will make the welfare of the community my top priority when allocating the
college's funds. College funds are scarce, as
anyone who has gone before Budget Committee asking for organization funding knows.
Improving communication between Budget
Committee and the receivers of college funding would make distribution of funds more
efficient and free up some money for new
student groups.

Tony Cheesebrough '97
My qualifications for this position are as
follows:
1. Student Council. During the two years I
have served on Council, I have acted as both
the CRC Coordinator and Appointments Chair.
In addition, I have served on the Constitution
Committee and also chaired a committee designed to improve communicationbetween SC
and its committees.
2. Budget Committee.As a freshman on this
committee, I became familiar with the allocation of the Student Activities Fund: hearing
funding proposals, making cuts in annual budgets, and working within the group dynamic to

College
Planning
Committee

There are departments that do not fully utilize the funds allocated to them, one of the
reasons being that the financial needs of the
departments change from year to year. Academic departments are likely to ask for more
money when they need it. Departments, however, are not likely to say when they need less
money, because it would then be harder to get
more money in the future. This results in inefficiently allocated funds. Budgeted money is
not lost; it is withheld from places where it
could have been used more effectively.
I will work my hardest to see that College
funds are distributed in the way most beneficial

achieve consensus on nearly every decision.
3. Concessions Committee. As a two-year
member of this committee, I've become both
comfortable and familiar with serving on Student-Administrative committees, and voicing
contrary views to more senior members—including administrators.
I have shown my ability and desire to serve
thestudent body as a StudentCouncil member
through my two years on Council, and serving
as a member ofboth the Student Budget Committee and Concessions Corr-nittee has given
me the experience necessary for a candidate to
the College Budget Committee. If elected, I
would continue to strive to serve the student
body as a memberof nextyear's StudentCouncil and College Budget Committee.

College Planning Committee has discussed
such topics as weekly collections, implementation of a new class schedule, and the
shortening of October Break to allow for a
reading week in the fall semester. There is
one two-semester position available.

Discerning the function of the college is no
trivial matter; the happiness and well-being of
students, faculty, staff, and administration is
crucial to Swarthmore's growth and survival.
When I applied as a freshmanfor the position of
College Planning Committee representative, I
stated that, "As a first-year student, I would
bring a fresh perspective to the planning process, enabling the committee to make informed
decisions consistent with current thoughts and
input." Since my election to the position last
fall, this has come to pass. In the discussion of
issues spanning from foreign student recruitment to the utilization of college grounds for
summer events, I have vocalized my thoughts

Tamala Montgomery '9B
My interest in Student Council is an extension of my personal commitment to make
Swarthmore reflect the rich experiences of its
student body. This commitment is manifest in
my involvement on the Women's Retreat and
Harambe Planning Committees, bodies that
move people from diverse racial, sexual, political, and other differences beyond their "comfort zones" into new and revolutionary partnerships.

Student Council has an obligation to initiate
and facilitate these partnerships, to be revolutionary in its operation, not reactionary. This
semester I attended a Student Council sponsored study break to find out exactly whatrole
Student Council plays on campus. I cringed
upon hearing from members that SC was considered "a joke" among the student body, and
had no real direction or role. I don't blame the
students for this sentiment; the problem lies
within SC itself.

The principal reason for students' ambivalence regarding this organization is that the
organization does not adequately reflect the
students it claims to represent. StudentCouncil
members have no personal accountability for
their decisions, which makes SC a clandestine
body subject to the arbitrary inclinations of its
members. To mitigate this problem, I would:
•Establish a committee that maintains personal relationships with student groups tokeep
SC abreast of the developments, concerns, and
interests of students.
•Make SC more visible and accessible with
a student council table in the entrance of
Sharpies, where you can talk directly to
SC members on a regular basis.
•Get student council involved in the Topics
In Race and Ethnicity discussions, and the
establishment of programs or workshops that

Communication and Accountability: Communication and accountability go hand in hand.

would move to have all Student Council meetings open to the studentbody. I would also seek
to have the minutes of each SC meeting printed

Nancy McGlamery '97
My name is Nancy McGlamery '97.1 transferred to Swarthmore from Bryn Mawr College this past January. Before attending Bryn
Mawr in the fall, I was enrolled at Drew University for two years.
I am running for the Student Council position on the Council for Educational Policy.
Because of my previous experience at other
schools and my place as a transfer student, I am
uniquely suited for this position.
At Bryn Mawr, I was elected to the Student
Curriculum Committee and selected by that
committee to serve as a liaison to the Faculty
Curriculum Committee (which basically has
the equivalent of the combinedresponsibilities
of the SwarthmoreCurriculum Committeeand
Council on Educational Policy). In these two
roles, I used both my experience with Drew's
curriculum and my concerns as a transfer student to make valuable contributions to Bryn
Mawr's on-going effort to restructure its cur-

Hello. My name is Matt Hellman, and I'd

Educational Policy for the upcoming year.
Frankly, I can't claim to have devoted years of
my life to thepursuit of perfecting educational
policy, but I do have some previous experience
in the field, as well as a great desire to help
refine Swarthmore's academic program.
My goals as a member of the Council would

Hi, my name is Franklin Mordecai

am running for two reasons. I feel that I can
make a positive contribution to student council
in general, and I would like to see the proper
balance ofcourses offeredhere at Swarthmore.
Looking into the future, it seems as though
an increasing number of demands are being
made on the college to diversify its curriculum.
At the same time, many students are often
skeptical of straying too far from the canon. I

I feel that while academics at Swarthmore
generally fulfill students' needs for scholastic
rigor, the concerns students have with such
issues as PDC and distribution requirements
are not sufficiently met. In my committee discussions at Bryn Mawr, I discovered that any
issue as integral to a college's identity as its
educationalpolicies is bound to be difficultand
complex. However, I feel that we need torealize a constant commitment to an on-going reviewof the College's educationalpolicies, with
a mind to change those policies that no longer
best serve the needs of thosewhom they affect.
I am committed to engaging in thiscontinual
and forward-looking process, and I would like
to devote the skills I have developed—attentive listening, sound judgment, reasonable expectations, and concern for open and inclusive
dialogue—to a position where I can best exercise my belief in the College's institutional
accountability in matters ofeducational policy.

effectively to suit the needsof the studentbody.
The curriculum at Swarthmore College is
gready influenced by its faculty, specifically
by which faculty are granted tenure. Over the
past two years I have seen great professors get
tenure but also subpar professors get tenure.
The way in which certain professors are
chosen at Swarthmore College is very important in that we (the students) are greatly influenced by them. Being on CEP allows an opportunity to address this issue which I am very
interested in.
For thesereasons, I wouldlike to serve on the

Over the past few months, student council

Thank you for your consideration.

of the Board of Managers and serves as a student voice to that body. There is one twosemester position available.

I am seeking election to theBoard of Managers seat of Student Council. Upon much consideration and research, I have found that this
position is one that I could serve with efficiency and integrity. During this schoolyear, I
have served on the StudentCouncil as the CR~C
Coordinator, as well as being a member of the
Student Council. During my Council term, I
have attended every business meeting and most
of the Thursday night open meetings.
As a Council member, I have been accessible
to my fellow students, advocated the construction of a permanent student run book sale to
occur each semester, sat on the Appointments
Committee and lent my insight (and that of
other students) to Student Council meetings.
As the CRC Coordinator, I was responsible
for regulating meeting time and use of the
CRC, as well as managing the condition of the
CRC. During my time as CRC Coordinator, I
have seen to it that the ceiling will be repaired,

The office I am running for is one that calls
for a responsible, flexible, and articulate individual. It also demands a bureaucratic inclination, complemented by fairness, and a principled approach to life. In short, this is a challenging office. Given my history as one who
never shies away from positions of responsibility and challenge, I feel I am qualified to seek
election.
As your representative to the Board ofManagers, I will ensure that all questions that directly affect the student body receive fair and
extensive debate. In reporting back to the Student Council, I will present my report without
bias. I believe that if elected, I have a right to
uphold the mandate of thepeople, and not that
of any factions or special interests. Your interests will always be paramount.

student input. I have strived to improve the
CRC and make it truly a community space for
everyone, and I believe my efforts have not
been in vain.
As the studentmember of theBoard ofManagers, I will be the voiceof the studentbody to
this very important organization. If elected, I
plan on collecting student concerns throughout
the semester to raise during the quarterly Managers meeting. As the Board of Managers observer, I will be directly responsible to Student
Council and shall relay any and all pertinent
information to the Council.
Aiding my efforts will be the strong, positive
relationship that I share with the present Board
of Managers representative, who will sit in on
the meetings with me and serve as aresource to
me, in the case that I have questions of any sort.
During my time on Student Council, I feel as
though I have not "wasted" my time or shirked
my responsibilities. I have servedmy term with
responsibility, honor, and dedicationand I am
asking you to allow me to continue to do so and
to serve you thebest way that I know how to and
the best thatI can. In me, you have a candidate
with experience and the desire to serve.
I can be reached at x 4661 or jtoddl if you
have any questions. Thank you.

If elected, I will gallantly fight for the creation of a more dynamic Student Council. The

Since their disappointing loss to
Gettysburg in double overtime last
week, the women's lacrosse team has
put together a string of impressive
wins, defeating both Dickinson and
Drew on their home fields. The Garnet facedDickinson last Thursday in
an important Centenial Conference
match, emerging victorious by a count
of 16-4. The scoring in this impressive show of offensive might was
concentrated among three players.
Co-captain Julie Noyes '95 had an
outstanding game, netting 8 goals
and an assist. Kristen Osborne '97
and Lara Ewens '96 also had particularly strong games, adding 4 goals
each to the final score. Defensively,
the team's stellar play was led by

Kelly Wilcox '97 who had 3 interceptions, and Bess O'Neill '95 who
recorded 9 ground balls in addition to

her 2 assists. On Saturday,
Swarthmore faced the Rangers of
Drew University, defeating them by
a score of 10-8. Scoring for the Garnet were Noyes and Ewens, who each
netted 3 goals and 1 assist, Laura
Starita '97, who recorded 2 goals and
Osborne, whoboosted the team with
an additional goal.In addition to leading the team on defense with 7 goals
and an interception, co-captain
Heather Maloney also scored a goal
for the Garnet. This weekend the
team looks to continue its success in
the annualSeven Sisters Tournament
at Wellesley College.

College, this time in the Haverford
Invitational last weekend. The
women's teammade good theirpromise to show theFords who was boss,
but the men were not so fortunate.
Still, Head Coach Ted Dixon said,
"For a mid-season meet, it was definitely a step in the right direction."
In thepresence of no less thannine
teams, both women's 4xloom and
4x400m relays won with times of
52.0 and 4:10 respectively.
Jill Wildonger '97 took second in
theopen 400 in a time of 1:02.1 and
Tori Washington '97 also placed.
Catherine Laine '9B tore up the
track in the open 100 in a time of
12.9 sec. to pull in a strong third
place. She also jumped 33 feet and

to take second.

Unfortunately, there were not as
many stand-out performances for the
men. Too many of the athletes I talked

with for this article preferred not to
comment on their performances, lest
they be embarrassed in print

A couple barriers fell for the men:
Wyn Strodtbeck '9B went under the
big 2:00 mark in the 800 for the
first time in his life with a 1:59.5 and
Walid Gellad '97 broke 53 sec. to set
apersonal record at 52.9 in the 400m.
Mike Turner '96 marked his muchawaited return from a pulled hamstring with a relatively strong performance in the open 200 and a leg of
the 4x400m relay.
"Not being able to run for a month
is like taking the bottle away from an
alcoholic," Turner said. "It's a real
challenge to regain what's lost, but
when you can see your progress, it's
all worthwhile."
Captain Sam Paschel '96 noted
how much the team has become cohesive over the last few months, and
added that "it'll be great to have the
men's two best sprinters back from
injuries."

Zengerle's Famous Last Words: East Good, West Bad
By Jason Zengerle
It is always a satisfying end to the
college basketball season when the
best team in the land is crowned the
National Champion. This has not always been the case, as Cinderellas
have stolen the show at the Final
Four in some years. The past two
seasons, however, have both ended
with the undisputed best team in the
country cutting down the nets on the
first Monday night of April. Last
year it was Arkansas. This year it was
UCLA.
Going into the Tournament, most
casual observers discounted the
UCLA Bruins as pretenders. Even
though the gang fromWestwood was
ranked number one in the country
and had just two losses on the season,
they carried with them the stigma
that has been affixed to West Coast
basketball, and their own program in
particular. To put it bluntly, Califor-

nia basketball is of a much lower
quality than the kind of ball that's
played on the East Coast, and UCLA
has had a sad history of choking in
the Tournament.
This year was different Throughout theregular season, UCLA showed
that they weren't your typical West
Coast, PAC-10 team. Led by the unstoppable Ed O'Bannon, a 6'9" fifth
year senior forward, and 5'9" senior
point guard Tyus Edney, theBruins
showed themselves to be, far and
away, thebest team in the land. More
than anything, UCLA was balanced.
Complimenting their two stars was a
supporting cast that proved time and
again that it could step up the intensity whennecessary.Freshman guard
Toby Bailey, sophomore forward
Charles O'Bannon, and sophomore
back-up point guard Cameron Dollar
are all excellent players who blend
nicely into the mix. Jim Harrick, their
much maligned coach, mixed his line-

ups well throughout the season and
went a great distance toward disproving his reputation as a bad bench
coach.
After UCLA beat Arkansas, 7'o"
center George Zidak said that the
Bruins' championship proved that
West Coast basketball was superior
to that played in the East. That is flatout wrong. UCLA is the massive exception to this general basketballrule.
While they were the best team in
college basketball this year, we cannot assume that theirtalent is indicative of their region's talent-level.
For a true look at the type of team
that is playing out west, one need
only examine the Arizona Wildcats,
the perennially underachieving club
of Lute Olson. Olson is one of the
worst coaches at the head of a major
program, as every year he seems to
find a new way to disappoint fans
with a sorry Tournament performance. While his teams are always

talented, they play with an astonishing lack of cohesion and heart. This
passionless, soft play is typical of
west coast basketball.
So congratulations to UCLA, a
truly worthy champion; let's just not
spread the congrats around too much.
Final Thoughts: This season was a
good one. Aside from the satisfying
finish, there were many fine moments
on the road there. Maryland's Joe
Smith, North Carolina's Jerry
Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace,
Michigan State's Shawn Respert, the
afore-mentioned Ed O'Bannon and
Tyus Edney, Arkansas's Corliss
Williamson and Scotty Thurman,
Kansas's Jacques Vaughn, Wake
Forrest's Randolph Childress andTim
Duncan, Syracuse's Lawrence
Moten, and countless others brought
excitement to the court game after
game. But in our rush to recap the
season, let us not forget the sublime

before the first half ended. The second half, however, despite efforts on

Dave Martinez '96, Henwood, and

Petusky.

This week includes games
against nationally ranked Western
Maryland on Saturday at home
and Dickinson on Wednesday on

the road. The team needs both wins
to remain competitive in the standings before 2nd ranked Gettysburg
and Bth ranked F&M storm in.

Brian Dougherty is the team's returning leading scorer. He has picked
up right where he left off, leading the
team in assists and he has totaled 21
points. In important games, the senior has come up big, including his
four goal game against Drew in an
11-5 win.
Unfortunately, Shannon Brown's
year was ended by injury two weeks
ago in the Cabrini victory. Yet, he
still provides great inspiration to the
rest of the team by consistently showing up for practice when he could be
spending his time elsewhere. He continues to work closely with the young

defensemen, helping out in any way
he can.
With these three captains leading
the way, the team has played tough in
games where the Garnet were big
underdogs.Both wins were theresult
of hard fought battles, including the
thriller under the lights at Drew last
Saturday. Ben Seigel '96 netted three
goals, and Ben Henwood '97 stuffed
20 shots, while only allowing five
goals. Andy Petusky '95 also played
an outstanding game on defense.
Riding the high of the win, the
Garnet traveled to Washington College to face the Shoremen, a team
consistently in the running for national championships. Considered to
have no chance, the Garnet quickly
jumped to a 1-0 lead. As the
Swarthmore defense clamped down
on the attack, the midfielders and
attack were able to hold onto the ball
for much of the first half, holding the
Washington lead to just 4-2. This is
an impressive feat, considering the
Shoremenhad been averaging almost
twenty goals a game against Division
HI teams. But, Washington's depth
and experience soon overmatched the

Athletes of the Week
Bridget Arbour '97
Early in herfreshmanyear, Bridget
came out for one of the most infamous teams on Swat's campus, the
women'srugby team. Bridget jumped

right into the A side games where she
picked up the game quickly as a second row forward player. After suffering from an injury last spring,
Bridget bounced back this fall picking up the flanker position in the
forward pack.
Bridget has continued to use her
speed and talents to help Swat women
ruggers. She is always one of the first

to rucks and mauls in the games and
an all out hustler. This past weekend

Arbour helped Swarthmore defeat
Longwood College in the University
of Virginia Rugby Tournament.
"Bridget adds a lot of personality
to the team. She always gives 100%
in practice and games," said one of
Bridget's teammates. "She's an intense player who never slows down,"
added teammate Jen Philpott '97.
"Bridget is a source of inspiration
both on and off the practice field.
And she's way cool."
