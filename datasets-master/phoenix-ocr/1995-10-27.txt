Piven Chronicles 12-Year Struggle
Over 1993 Motor-Voter Law
By Erik Huneke

Frances Fox Piven, Professor of Political Science at the City University of
New York and author of Regulating the
Poor and Why Americans Don't Vote,
delivered the Political Science
department's annual Charles Gilbertlecture at theLP AC on Wednesday evening.
Piven startedby commenting thatwith
the approach of the 1996 presidential
election, everyonefrom Louis Farrakhan
to unions to the League of Women Voters has been talking about and organizing
voter registration drives. This registration occurs in the first place because the
government needs a listof eligible voters
in order to conduct an election, and, unlike other countries, the United States
government places the responsibility for
compiling this list on individual voters.
Whereas other countries compile their
voter lists from social security information or polling, the UnitedStates requires
each voter to register him/herself individually.
Although she acknowledged the argument, "Shouldn't we want to take the
initiative to get on the list?", she also
notedthat in the past several decades, the
United States has maderegistration more
difficultthan necessary by confining it to
remote places at infrequent occasions
and creating such obstacles as inscrutable forms and intimidating officials.
The combination of these factors resulted
in 60 million members of the potential
American electorate being unregistered,
withtwo-thirds of these people possessing incomes below the median. Voluntary registration drives do not address the
heart of the problem because they do not
delve deeply into theranks of the unregistered; they recruit mainly those voters
deemed necessary for specific electoral
goals.

Piven noted that this registration system did not always exist. Through the
middle of the 19th century, turnout hovered around 85% for presidential elections, but this disintegrated once registrationwas implemented in theaftermath
of strikes in the North and efforts by
wealthy whites to disenfranchise blacks
and poor whites in the South. The effect
was so great that turnout for the 1924
presidential election was only 19% in the
South, with black participation virtually
nonexistent. Since then, with the exception of the union-inspired drives of the
New Deal, voter turnout in major elections has consistently hovered around
50%
Some have argued thatAmericans have
voted less because they are content, but
Piven wondered "why it ispoorer people
who are most satisfied." The restrictions
of voterregistration rules were for others
the main factor. Walter Dean Burnham
believed the onus ofresponsibility fell on
the parties which did not attempt to recruit people to the polls.
Piven believes that the real explanation lies in a combination of the two latter
factors. Rules that tend to exclude the
poor and minorities from the political
system make it so thatpolitical parties do
not need to make any efforts of their own
to address their concerns or attempt to
incorporate them.
The 12-year-long path to the passage

of the "Motor-Voter" bill comprised the
rest of the lecture. Piven and a colleague
aimed to "make voter registration the
most widely available service in the country" by allowing people to register when
they wentto social service agencies ranging from day-care centers to welfare offices. Significantly, those who lose thenregistered status when they move would
be able to renew it more easily.
Piven noted that while "it's easy to
have a goal," it is much harder to create
the methods to achieve it. Her strategies
entailed a "series of experiments," the
first of which was to enlist social service
agencies to offer to register their clients
in 1982. Since these agencies' funding
was threatened by Reagan Administration proposals, they did not overcome
bureaucratic hassles to carry out the goal.
Since an earlier efforts by six Columbia
University volunteers resulted in 1,000
people on a Harlem cheese line being
registered in only four hours, Piven reverted to recruiting volunteersto register
voters in welfare and unemployment
agencies by 1984.
The second strategy consisted of appealing to politicians and parties who
stood to gain from the registration efforts. Governor Celeste of Ohio, White
of Texas, and Cuomo of New York,
elected with significant working-class
support, were convinced to issue executive orders requiring social services to
register voters. Yet their continuing recalcitrance resulted in little upturn in
voter participation in the 1984 election,
and much of that was due to right-leaning
groups registering new car and home
buyers.
The next step was to encourage state
legislatures to pass laws requiring social
agencies to register voters, since states
have often been reputed to be "laboratories for democracy." Yet state governments were only willing to contemplate
registration efforts at motor vehicle registration sites. They also raised concerns
about whether or not the federal government would allow social service agencies to carry out registration or would
provide necessary funds.
The last step, to which Piven had not
originally intended to resort, was to turn
to federal legislation. They received support from 1986 to 1987 from Senator
Cranston and Congressman Swift from
Washington, who was head of the Congressional subcommittee on elections.
Piven worked with him to draft legislation "on her dining-room table" to require agencies to register voters and to
allow for litigation against those states
which did not comply.
"Never in my life did I think I would
work with the League of Women Voters," andfor that matter, other watchdoggovernment groups such as the ACLU.
The League adopted this legislation as its
principal project and lobbied for it persistently over the long term.
The bill failed twice because of filibustering, but was passed in the spring of
1992, only to be vetoed by then-President GeorgeBush. It was passed again in
1993, and signed into law by President
Bill Clinton.
Human Serve, the coalition which had
been pursuing these goals all along, developed a handbook upon passage of the

legislation which was intended to clarify
the implementation of the law. Its members have also met with state motor vehicle directors, civil rights groups, and
even the Ford Foundation to fund that
training of agency workers in registration procedures.
Now, 37 to 38 states are complying
with the law, although big states such as
Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, and
Michigan have tried to stall it through
litigation. Despite this, five million voters were registered within the first six
months that the law was in effect, and ten
milliontotal within the first ninemonths.
Piven notedthat "public assistanceregistration is lagging,...[but] much less so
in the South." For example, by June,
Missouri "had already registered forty
percent of its unregistered voter population."She noted thatthiscouldbe seen as
a "curious reversal of the historic pattern" of the South's exhibiting greater
reluctance to register voters.
The newest strategy consists of the
"implementation watch," in whichPiven
and her colleagues have aimed to "create
a vast panoply of watchdogs at the thousands of sites at which registration is
supposed to be going on." They have
recruited union officials, ACLU members, the AIDS Coalition, and students,
particularly those from schools of social
work, for this purpose.
Piven noted that six lawsuits have already been launched in New York, one of
which is pending against Piven's employer, the City University ofNew York,
which has failed to satisfy a clause in the
legislation requiring it to offer registration during when students sign up for
courses.
Piven then asked that "if voter registrationbarriers were crucial for developing a political system that ignored the
needs of working people and minorities,
can we roll the film back" to create a
more inclusive political system? While
she does not envision a European-style
labor party developing any time in the
near future, Piven nevertheless wondered
whether "the influence of voters [can] be
a match for the kind of money that is
being spent...to shape American public

opinion, to confuseAmerican public opinion about [such issues as] Medicare and

Medicaid." The information that is currently provided is intended more to "push

theright buttons" than to inspire healthy
debate.
While she felt that ten to twenty million voters could not be without impact,
she was not sure whether they could
counteract monetary influences in the
political sphere. In the two states which
have been studied thus far, seventy percent of registered welfare recipients who
had never voted before turned out to
vote, even in the absence of a comprehensive Get Out the Vote program. Piven
believed that maybe "turning back this
legislation will require new waves of
protest.. .that can articulate the issuesand
form new voter blocs," as been done
successfully in the past. She concluded
by noting that the very presence of traditionally underrepresented groups in the
electorate can only foster the protest
movement
and counteract the
government's lingering tendency to ignore their interests.

Lang's Generosity Increases
By Phoenix Staff

Eugene Lang's latest gift to the College provides, among other things, a tem-

porary fix for the Public Policy program's
funding shortage.
According to administration officials,
Lang has added money to an existing
fundfor student summer research. Public
Policy concentratorsmay apply for grants
from the fund to cover expenses incurred
during theirrequired summer internships
with policy organizations such as government agencies.
Political science professor Raymond
Hopkins, who coordinates the Public
Policy program, said the program no
longer has funds to support concentrators
because all of the program's grants have
run out. Hopkins estimates the program
has received grants totaling between
$600,000 and $700,000 since it was
started in 1980,but, he says, the College
"hasn'traised any money for us for five

years."
Many

concentrators receive grants
from College funds for summer social
science research, such as the Samuel
Hayes and Joel Dean fellowships,
Hopkins said. The fund to which Lang, a
1938 Swarthmore graduate, just contributed was another potential source of
money.
Until last summer, when it ran out of
money, the Public Policy Program supported concentrators who could not find
other funding. Last summer. President
Al Bloom used his contingency fund to
support policy concentrators who did not
get other grants; Bloom told ThePhoenix
he will do it again this summer, though
Hopkins says he has not received official
word from Bloom yet. "I haven't heard

that from

him directly,"Hopkins said. "I
wrote him a letter asking if it's true, and
he hasn't denied it."
A permanent solution to the Public
Policy program's need for more funds
will have to wait at least until next year,
when it may receive a real budget from
the College. Right now, said Hopkins,
the only direct support the program gets

from Swarthmore is the secretary it shares
with the Center for Social and Policy
Studies. Hopkins added that while it was
easy for Public Policy to obtain outside
grants when it was "new and avantgarde," it will be more difficult now that
the program is well-established.
Associate Provost Mark Jacobs said
that when the College determines next
year's overall budget this spring, it will
consider giving Public Policy a regular
budget. Hopkins says he hopes this budget will come through. "If you've got
Education and Computer Science and
Black Studies and Women's Studies
funded by the College, it would seem
anomalous to say Public Policy wouldn't
be," he said.
The program's budget proposal asks
for funds to support concentrators' internships, as well as money to hire a
professor interested inpublic policy, preferably environmental policy, according
to Hopkins.
Hopkins believes that dropping the
internship requirement is not an option

for Public Policy concentrators.
President Al Bloom stated, "Gene
Lang's support of off-campus student
research is a further reflection of his
devotion to Swarthmore and of his commitment to empowering students to put
their talents to work to create a more just
society."

Registrar Institutes Seminar
Scheduling Meeting
By Erik Huneke
Following a recommendation made in
the new Honors program outline. Registrar Martin Warner has instituted a new
type of meeting to address scheduling
conflicts between seminars which is taking place Friday, October 27 at 1:00 PM
in the Hicks Mural Room.
This new system replaces the old
method of scheduling seminars at an
Honors meeting at the beginning of the
semester in which they are to be taught.
Such a meeting occurred at the beginning
of this semester. According to the comments that Evelyn Huk will make on
Warner's behalf at the meeting, in older
versions of the Honors program, "honors
students took only two seminars a semester, for their entire junior and senior
years" and "only honors students took

seminars."
Since eligible Course students can now
take seminars and Honors students often
include courses in their last two years,
many faculty members and students have
complained that the old system "was unwieldy and dysfunctional for negotiating
conflicts that now included both course
and seminar schedules."
This "new loop,"recommended by the
Curriculum Committee, is designed to

"allow the negotiation of seminar time
conflicts both for faculty (intra- and inter-departmentally) and for seminar stu-

dents before students register for courses.

Since the meeting is still viewed as an
"experiment," the Registrar and the Provost welcome student and faculty feedback.

On October24, Warner sent out tentative course and seminar schedules to department chairs. While in the past this
draft was intended solely for proofreading, now it will also be used in the negotiation of scheduling conflicts. He encouraged departments to use the time
before October 27 to eliminateany difficulties which were immediately apparent.

When students discuss seminar meeting times with theirprofessors, however,

they will not yet have access to the course
schedule for next semester. According to
Huk's address, the meeting occurs prior
to course scheduling because of
"Swarthmore's longstanding, high valuation of seminar instruction and the Honors Program" as well as "the fact that it is
impossible in a meeting such as this to
negotiate conflicts in both courses and
seminars." In fact, Warner predicts "this
meeting will probably also result in some
changes to the course and seminar schedule."
Department chairs will have until November 3 to implement those changes.
The Official Schedule of Seminars and
Courses will beavailable in late November.

We've all seen Martin Warner in the
halls of Parrish. And we've seen him
bicycling across campus. But how many
of us can say that we've seen our registrar
dressed up as a scarecrow and dancing?
The attendees oflast Friday's Fall Fest
were the lucky few to have seen Warner,
a contestant in the event's scarecrowmaking contest, doing the electric slide
to music played by a disc jockey upstairs
in Tarble. Just one of the activities in the
first autumnal gathering of Swarthmore
staff, the scarecrow-making contest embodied some of the Fest's main goals.
Teams of people from various departments joined together to design scarecrows and pumpkins, and the fruits of
their labor are now on display in the
library, Tarble, and President Bloom's
office (and, of course, the Registrar's
office, buthe'soutof costume rightnow).
"The highlight [of the Fall Fest] was
that it was a nice opportunity for the staff
to get together," said Doug Hasbrouck,
directorof the one of the event's organizers. "It was a very differentkind of social
event for the staff. The teams were one
vehicle to bring people together, but even
people justgoing together and looking at
the scarecrows and pumpkins drewpeople
together."
"It was a good way to get to know
people in departments you don't see on a
daily basis," agreed Pam Knito wski, who
works in Alumni Relations.
In the past, the staff has gathered at a
holiday luncheon, but in recent years the
money for this event has instead been

given to individual departments to use

as

theyplease. However, this year the money
($l5 per person) was given back to be

usedfor an event thatwouldbring everyone together, to be organized by a committee of people from many different
departments.

"But the way the event worked out,"
said Hasbrouck, "We could see doing it
when the students are around and making
it a community event. It would be a way
to increase staff, faculty, and student
interaction."
In addition to the contests and the DJ,
theFest also included a beer-tasting contest led by Hans-Jakob Werlen, Assistant
Professor of German, finger foods such
as German sausage and cheese, and an
oompah band.
"It sort of had an Oktoberfest flair,"
saidcommitteememberAstrid Devaney.
"It was festive, very autumnal and
festive," Assistant to the President
Maurice Eldridge summarized the event.
"And it was a nice event for the staff,
given that everybody else had a break."

Debate Team Continues Tradition of
Excellence at U. Maryland Tournament
By Erica Turner
Each of the two-person teams from
Swarthmore's Peaslee Debate Society
attending the University of Maryland,
Baltimore Campus's debate tournament
went to semi-final competition over OctoberBreak.
"It [the team placings] showed that
even with the departure of the best seniors, S warthmore is still at the top of the
circuit," Michael Scott '97, the team president, said.
Although the team is younger thanlast
year, promising novices, teamwork, the
ability to debate a wide range of topics,
and luck are helping the team do well
according to members.
Only two teams from Swarthmoreparticipated at the UMBC tournament on
October 13 and 14, but both teams made
it to semi-final competition where they
lost.
Scott and Justin Herring '97 placed
third in the tournament overall. Franklin
Rubinstein '97 and Tara Zahra '9B placed
fourth.
Swarthmore was successful because of
members' abilities todebate a broadrange

of topics, according to Herring. "On the
other hand, we got lucky. One of the
cases we had to oppose was an economics case and we are both economics majors," said Herring, who has only attended five tournaments.
Three of the debaters took home
speaker awards. Herring ranked as sixth
best speaker. Zahraplaced fifth and Scott
took home the second place speaker
award.
The team made a comparable showing
at the Johns Hopkins University tournament October 20 and 21 where five teams
competed. Rubinstein and Scott made it
to final round, finally placing second
overall.
In the final round of competition, a
Princeton University team beat
Rubinstein and Scott in a debate about a
gay researcher discovering a gene governing homosexuality.
Rubinstein and Scott's second place
ranking at Johns Hopkins means that
Swarthmore will be able to send an additional two debaters to Nationals, after the
two automatically normally allowed for
participants.
Rubinstein and Scott each took home

speaker awards. The two were ranked
sixth and ninthbest speaker, respectively.
The S warthmoreteam of Tinsley Davis
'9B and Phil Spector '97 was ranked
seventh.
"We also have a number of promising
first year students," Scott said. Among
thenovice teams competing were Michael
Brus '97 and Ed Cohn '99, Jerome
Bushnell '99 and Ben Fritz '99, and
Wendy Lawrence '99 and DamonTaaffe
'99.
First-year novices Lawrence and
Taaffe had a 3-2 record in what was only

final loss was to one of the University of
Pennsylvania's best teams.

"It's very competitive and a lot of

Two Students Arrested by Borough Police
By Erik Huneke

At about 8:00 PM on Saturday, October 2, a Public Safety officer went to a
party held at one of the Lodges because
of loudlyplaying music. By the time the
evening was over, two of the party goers
were arrested for underage drinking and
public intoxication.
When the Public Safety officer arrived, Pat Donaghy '97 explained that no
off-campus people were present, and the
officer said that Public Safety officers
would not return unless someone filed a
complaint with the borough police.
At about 10:00 PM, however, another

officer appeared, and Donaghy asked this
officer whether everything was all right.
Donaghy did not realize that the officer
was a member of the Swarthmore Borough Police, not the College's Public
Safety Department. The officer told
Donaghy that themusic was not too loud
and that he was not responding to any off-

campus complaints.
Only when Donaghy was arrested did
he realize that the officer was not from
Public Safety. Donaghy asked the officer
whether or not he had the right to patrol
the campus, and the officer maintained
that he did not have to obey any restrictions in the areas he could patrol. At the

time, Donaghy was not aware of this.
The officer demanded that someone
else come outside, whereupon another
student was arrested. The officer then
went inside the Lodge to find other
partygoers, but they were no longer on
thepremises. Public Safety also returned
to the scene.
Donaghy has one prior off-campus
arrest and therefore faces a $3OO fine; the
student who walked into the situation
must take a class. The first student intends to plead not guilty and defend himself in court by maintaining that he had
looked out for the best interests of security during the whole situation.

Chester-Swarthmore College Coalition
Obtains New Director, Neilda Mott
By

Phoenix Staff

Neilda E. Mott of Swarthmore has
been named executive director of the
Chester-Swarthmore College Community Coalition, a non-profit corporation
working to improve conditions and opportunities in Chester through a unique
public-private partnership.
"What makes this opportunity so appealing is the chance to work with two
very different organizations that appear
to be succeeding in creating room for real
dialogue in decision-making," said Mott,
the formerboard president of the Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County.
"That dialogue could happen only if the
parties involved in the conversations recognized each other as a valuable resource."
Raised in New York, Mott graduated
from Long Island University with a B .A.
in English and an M.S. in Education.
After 12 years of teaching in Brooklyn,
she moved to Swarthmore in 1981 with
herhusbandand two sons. Her first job in
this area was working with young adults
in a life-skills, career-exploitation and
job-acquisition program housed at the
former YMCA in Chester.
Moving into the private sector, she
managed her husband's law offices. At
the same time, Mott began her volunteer
work with the Domestic Abuse Project.
After working as a hot-line volunteerand
drop-in group facilitator, she was invited
to join the project board, which she went
on to lead as president from 1989 to
1991.
In addition to her position with the
coalition, Mott is a trustee of the Valentine Foundation, which funds organizations supporting women's and girls' em-

Should "Take a Professor Out to
Lunch" Be Expanded to Include Staff?
By Ben Fritz

The 'Take a Professor Out to Lunch"
program isbilled as a way for students to
get to spend more time with their professors in an informal setting-over lunch.
But many students are questioning why
this program only includes faculty. Why
not the staff who are, in the words of
KristinaGutschow '99,"importantmembers of the Swarthmore community?"
Indeed, many students echoed
Gutschow's desire to be able to take out
any non-student member of the
Swarthmore community they choose.
That very question is currently under
consideration by Student Council. According to Rahul Sakhuja '9B, Co-Coordinator of Student Council, the Council
would like to do it, but because they share
the cost of the 'Take a Professor Out to
Lunch" program with the Provost's office, they must get approval from the
Provost's office or get funding from another office for half the money to take
staff members out to lunch. He is going to
10/19/95

discuss the issue with the Provost's office and plans to discuss the matter with
Dean NginaLythcott.Sakhujahopesthat
if the Provost's office declines to fund
staff lunches, the Dean's office will pick
up the slack.
Although by including staffmembers
the program may lose some of the academic qualities for whichit was intended,
many believe expanding it for staff will
help encourage a sense of friendship and
camaraderie between all members of the
Swarthmore community. Many students
share opinions similiar to that of Evan
Goer '97 that "The one staff member I
think is really cool is Maryann." Allowing students like Goer to get toknow staff
members outsideof the student/employer
relationship may let more people on both
sides find out just how "cool" every member of the Swarthmore community really
is (although one might think that Maryann
is probably sick of Sharpies food by
now). Any students with opinions on this
issue are urged to e-mail Sakhuja at
"rsakhujl" by Sunday.

Students of
Caribbean Ancestry
Begin Hurricane
Relief Drive
By Desiree Joseph

Last month, Hurricane Marilyn swept
through the Caribbean, leaving 70 to 80
percent of thehomes and buildings on the

islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix
heavily damaged or destroyed. On the
eastern point ofPuerto Rico, 500 homes
were left in similar condition.
The Students of Caribbean Ancestry
(5.0.C.A.), have recognized this loss to
their home region and have responded
with a food and clothing drive for the
victims of Hurricane Marilyn.
"Pleasebe generous and help make the
upcoming holiday season a joyous one
for those recovering from disaster,"
Marcella Nunez-Smith'96, co-president
of 5.0.C.A., asks of the College community.
Boxes for collection of any clothes or

UC Berkeley Protest Walkout
Students at the University of California-Berkeley staged a massive campus
wide walkout on October 12 to protest
the decision by University Regents to
rescind affirmative action programs at
the 10-school UC system.
The statewide boycott of classes was
part of a larger national day of action to
defend affirmative action organized by
the CaliforniaStudents Civil Rights Coalition. Students in Michigan and New
York participated in the Day of Action to

Patricia White, Assistant Professor of English

On Wednesday, October 25, Patricia
White, Assistant Professor of English,
spoke to a crowded Intercultural Center
in her lecture "Lesbian and Gay Filmmakers: Independent Media." She presented a basic outline of the history of
gay independent film since the inception
of cinema, focusing on those aspects
largely unknown in mainstream cinema.
She discussed the works ofearlier artists such as OscarWilde and followed the
history through to the works of artists of
the seventies including Barbara Hammer
and Chantel Akerman. Most of these
films were produced independently and
greatly differ from traditional narratives,
dealing with issues in far more abstract
and often image-oriented ways.
By the mid-eighties, more traditional
full-length narrative films took theirplace
in queer cinema with movies such as
Parting Glances, Paris is Burning, and
Go Fish. According to White, these
films, though successful, have become a
kind of cultural commodity. Other independent efforts are still endangered because they are largely unfunded and invisible. Outlets that could bring them
exposure, such as PBS, have not given
independent film and video as many venues as they need.
White also emphasized the importance
of the birth of the video, which, since it
requires far less equipment and spending
and as a medium is available to virtually
everyone, has greatly increased the proliferation of gay and lesbian cinema.
The lecture was part of the Intercultural Center's Faculty Lecture Series. It
will be continued with a lecture on November IS by Miguel Diaz-Barriga entitled "Americo Paredes: A Voice from
the Border."

Q: Do you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth?
A: I do.
Q: Then for the record would you
please state your name and academic
yearand any other pertinent information
concerning your involvement in the
College Judiciary Committee election.
A: Hello. My name is Daniel Barnes
and I am a member of the Class of 1999.
I would be honored to serve on such an
influential organization as the College
Judiciary Committee that protects the
repute of the Swarthmore community. I
have previously stood on advisory boards
to administrations in my earlier years of
education. One constant that I feel is
necessary for any Committee person is
compassion. Someone who is brought
before the group is obviously in a very
awkward position; listening to the
student's version of the accusations
brought before him or her is imperative
in order to foster trust between members
of the college community. However, a
guilty verdict mandates harsh sentencing in order to promote the honorof the
world'sgreatestcollege.evenifwedon't
have a mascot. I simply ask that each
voter weighs their decision carefully before choosing the Committee members.
Tinsley Davis '9B
For those of you who can only know
me through this medium, rather than in
person, I hope to convince you of the
strength of my motivations and qualifications for College Judicial Committee.
Most important are my motivations for
running. Swarthmore is a community
that is upheldby the strength ofits members' convictions. As individuals, we
value our rights to express opinions and
be ourselves and must uphold theserights
whether they be implicit or written in the
Handbook.The integrity of our community does not come from punishing those
who violate rules. Rather, justice appears only in the diligent and critical
evaluation of trespasses. Furthermore,
the respect for individuality must be
maintained when the College Judicial
Committee is presented with a case. I
feel it is important for committee members to be aware of these issues.
Varied experiences prepare me for the
challenge of the College Judicial Com-

mittee. I have been a member of the
Amos J. PeasleeDebate Society since the
beginning of freshman year. Debating
has furthered my ability to closely examine all sides of an issue and improved my
analytical skills for considering every
piece of an argument. I've attended tournaments in which I have debated, but
equally valuable has been my experience
judging debaterounds. I've utilized my
objectivity and analysis to advance teams
that successfully argued for positions with
which I would not normally agree. In
addition to having debate experience, I
have been a part of teams and committees
both here and in high school. Inparticular, my position on the Registration Committee last year taught me the value of
coming to a consensus! Finally, I do not
plan to study abroad and am very eager to
make the complete two year commitment to the College Judicial Committee.
Rob Mc Greevy '9B
Although I can't boast of previous
experience, I know I would sincerely
appreciate the value of serving on the
judiciary committee. Since I've gone to
the trouble of submitting this on a "midterm" day, however, I must have found a
more compelling reason than, "I think it
would be kinda' fun," to apply. This
more compelling concern stems from my
interest in therole a peer to peer governing body like theCJC can play in upholding ethical standards of a community. I
am interested to see how a diplomatic
application of ethical judgment can affect a community in a very real sense.
Some day, I hope to extend this interest to
this application in labor relations, etc.
Now, you might say, "It's great you have
this obscure interest, but what I care?"To
thatI would say that I do have experience
representing my peers. In high school,
my classmates elected me their student
body president, finding, I would like to
think, confidence in my ability to represent them. If elected, I would seek to
make students more aware of the ethical
standards we establish as part of a unique
community and our role in upholding
them. With this interest and concern I
apply.
Sara Schulman '99
Experience: 2 years service on high
school Honor Board, acting as Senior
Prefect thesecond year; 1 year serv ice on
high school Disciplinary Committee

Deliberating the definition and enforcementof "doing the right thing" has
become fascinating to me. Determining
whether someone is "right" or "wrong"
in a certain context requires matching
and reconciling. The individual's values with the prescribed set of school
rules. Half of this process may be accomplished through education of the
individual.The second, more intriguing
half involves thoroughly examining the
set of rules, to see whether their ends are
in keeping with the means and are supportive of individual values. This is the
insight I wish to share with the
Swarthmore community.
As an Honor Board and Disciplinary
Committee, I dedicated over 60 hours to
case hearings, in which the Board listened to evidence and related the circumstances to schoolrules. My greatest
challenge was my role as Senior Prefect—l devoted innumerable hours as
the facilitator and strategic planner of
the Honor Board and the public face of
the Honor System. My goal for the year
was ambitious: transform a fledgling
system into an establishedand respected
standard integrated at all levels of the
school community. The first step I enacted was to call forums of people with
different types ofinterests and ask them
the toughquestions thatthe HonorBoard
alone was never able to solve. The second step was to listen to their suggestions, and allow the rules to be transformed to accomadate the individual,
rather than the other way around. As a
result, 17% fewer cases came before the
HonorBoard from 1994-5 than in 1993-

4.

What has impressed me perhaps the

most about Swarthmore is that it doesn't
have a Honor Code per se. I interpret
that to mean that the school expects its

members to hold and adhere to

high,
self-formed standards of integrity. I'm
very eager to further explore this philosophy and its relative success, and I
look forward to adding new input.

OPINIONS
Problematic Gestures: Farrakhan's March

On-campus services

inefficient and over-priced

A Day in the Life of a Swarthmore student:
Wakes up in the morning. Opens underwear
drawerandrealizes to her dismay that today must
be a laundry day. She lives in Worth dormitory.
She gathers her quartersfrom her "quarter mug."
It is 7:00 A.M. She collects her rugby-stained,
raunchy-smelling clothing and heads down to the
laundry room ofWorth. Upon arrival, she discovers one washer and one dryer in use. The other
two washers and two dryers are all out ofservice.
She tells her RA ofthe difficulty and goes to class
(presumably wearing dirty underwear).
The example provided above is not far-removed
from the average laundry experience of a
Swarthmore student In the Worth dormitory
alone, there are only three washers and three
dryers provided to service over 100 people. The
inadequate number of machines is particularly
evident when breakdowns occur, as they so often
do.
When the machines do break down, who fixes
them, and why does it take so long? How efficient
is the process of communication between the
students and the technicians? First a student must
notify her RA. The RA then e-mails "workbox."
John Tull (the man behind "workbox") must then
contact the technicians. The technicians arrive on
the scene anywhere between a few days to weeks
after the complaint is lodged. The middle-men in
this complex process could be eliminated, of
course, if students simply called the number provided on the machines. These numbers are often
difficult to discern as age, vandalism, and other
factors commonly wear out the labels. So who is
one to call?
Now, this laborious and time-consuming process would almost be understandable if the students ofSwarthmore werereceiving cut-rateprices
on their laundry needs. Sadly, this is not the case.
Over the summer, prices for the dryers doubled to
fifty cents a load, for half an hour. We all know
that it takes these aged, decrepit dryers much
longer than half an hour to truly dry a load of
towels or jeans. A typical load of laundry, therefore, costs between $1.75 to $2.25. That is a lot of
quarters.

Not only is there an inadequate number of
laundry machines per dormitory, but they are
over-used and inefficiently serviced. Students
wait longer and pay more to get clean underwear.
In a Phoenix poll, 60% of the student body stated
that they are unhappy with laundry services at
Swarthmore.
The student exits her class with hopes ofreceiving good mail. After looking through her boxmate' s
ten personal letters, she finds one for herself.
From STC Services. Upon opening the bill, she
discovers that she had been charged twicefor the
calls during the month ofSeptember. And, unless
our heroine was making calls in her sleep, her
phone bill seems to be significantly higher than in
years past. She says to herself, "I wish that I

By Chuck Stevens

could talk to somebody about my phone bill. I
know, I'll go talk to Dick Templeton!" So the
gravely indebted student proceedes, phone bill in
hand and hopes soaring that Dick will solve everything, to his office in the basement ofßeardsley.
"What'sthis?" she asks uponarrival to Beardsley,
"Dick Templeton isn't here anymore, nor is the
office. No one is here to answer my questions!"
Again, this sad saga is not an atypical experience for Swarthmore students. The switch of
phone companies to STC Services has brought
numerous headaches and empty pockets for
Swatties. This editor compared her current STC
bill to one from last year and discovered that her
in-state, long-distance daytime calls are now costing her almost twice as much per minute.
Once again, one would reasonably assume that
an increase in rates would entail more efficient
and accessible services. And once again, this is
not the case.
STC Services is located neither on nor near
Swarthmore's campus, but in Allentown, PA, a
town far enough away from the Philadelphia area
that it even has its own airport. Even if a student
deposits his/her bill in the drop box in Parrish on
time, there is a
delay between the
student's deposit and the processing of the bill by
STC Services. In this period, one's phone services could conceivably be terminated.
Another issueis technicaldifficulties with one's
phone. Without Mr. Templeton, who is one to
call? Well, call whomever you want but the only
person who will deal with your problems oncampus is Michael Rapp. Previously employed
by the College as a computer technician (one of
the school's only computer technicians), Mr.Rapp
now finds himself saddled with the additional
overwhelming burdenof being the sole repairman
on Swarthmore's campus. Mr. Rapp now has to
divide his time between repairing all of
Swarthmore's computers and all of Swarthmore's
phones. As any Economics major knows, this is
NOT an efficient Pareto optimizing condition..
And so, our heroine now falls down upon her
bed.frustrated, broke, with a pounding headache.
Reaching for her free Worth Health Center (an

on-campus service) aspirin, she proclaims "I'm
fed up with this shoddy service! My phone bill is
too high, I haven't received any good mail, and
I'm wearing dirty underwear!"
We know efficient, adequate services on-campus can be provided. The new copy machines in
the libraries are proving to be in satisfactory
condition and when problems do arise, they are
repaired the same day. In this case, we are paying
slightly more than before, but are receiving genuine, high-quality service. The Phoenix staff suggests that these same reforms be implemented for
the laundry machines as well as for the phone
services. We do not necessarily object to paying
more, but we do expect a higher level of quality
for the price.

Your columnist is an idealist at heart, really. He
dons his cloak of cynicism each week because,
let's face it, starry-eyed romanticizing makes a
lousy column, but underneath all that sarcasm lies
a Pollyanna of the most intractable sort. Accordingly, it pains him mightily to admit to himself
that all is not well among institutions and organizations thathe respects.. .but duty is duty, and duty
demands now and again that one criticize notions
otherwise held dear.
This newfound spirit of resolution is occasioned by a variety of things, notably a perusal of
a revealing piece in the October 22 New York
Times, but it also stems from pondering the Million ManMarch and realizing that your columnist,
despite his sympathy for its ends, was thoroughly
turned off by the march as it was. The ideological
schizophrenia he feels in attempting to support a
movement yet denounce its leadership testifies to
the predicament of the white liberal in today's
racially charged climate, but also to the dire state
of the civil rights movement—and, sorry to say,
your columnist sees no way out of this particular
mess.

Darn near juxtaposed in the Week in Review
section of the Times was a somewhat rhapsodic
description of the march—a "great living tapestry," it seems—and a comparison of therhetoric
of the Nation of Islam with that of the National
Alliance and other white-supremacist groups. The
image was fitting: an earnest attempt on the Times'
part to rationalize away the march's PR problems
by emphasizing the positive outcomes, followed
by a disturbingly honestexamination of why those
PR problems have come about.
Your columnist found the schism, which resembled his own, a bit disquieting, partly because

O.J. Verdict
is a Bad Sign
By Justin Herring
Those of us in Sharpies when the verdict came
down probably remember the shouts of "Not
Guilty!" from the trial addicts watching itonT.V.
Even in Sharpies, the depth of difference in reactions was loud and noticeable. Hoots of joy mixed
with curses and exclamations of disbelief. Like
many Swatties, I was dismayed and even shocked
that O.J. Simpson was acquitted. I had heard at
various times from "experts" that he might walk,
but I didn't believe it would actually happen.
The skill of thedream team aside, the evidenee
seemed to leave little room for doubt. Admittedly,
I speak only with the authority of someone fairly
interested in the trial, not a serious addict However, you don't have to listen to hours of expert
testimony to know the significance of DNA or
understand that O.J. had a history of violence
towards Nicole. Afterwards, at the prosecutors'
press conference, the District Attorney made a
revealing statement, "All of us here have lost
close trials before. What makes this hurt so much
is thatnone of us thought it was close." Clearly, by
the standard of proof thatthese prosecutors were
accustomed to there should have been a conviction. So why did O.J. walk?
I'veheard a lotof competing explanations. One
of the most popular is the idea that O.J. bought
justice (or injustice, in this case). O.J.'s money
and the fame of his case certainly attracted an
extremely skilled legal team .Thatkind of defense
is far beyond the means of an ordinary citizens.
Without them he couldn't have afforded the expensive experts to argue against the scientific
evidence. Without them he wouldn't have had
such a skillful and shameless manipulation of the
'race card' working in his favor.
It seems pretty clear that O.J. Simpson would
have gone to jail had he been an ordinary man. The
implications for our justice system are dismaying.
Our legal system is based on thenotionof equality
before the law, and to have our beliefs shattered so
starkly is upsetting.

It seems pretty clear that
OJ. Simpson would have
gone to jail had he been an
ordinary man. The obvious
implications for our entire
system of justice are shattering to all of our beliefs.

long-held suspicions. To wit: the Nation of Islam
believes that "intermarriage or race mixing should
be prohibited," while Christian Identity Online
(some strange far-right folks) opine that "interracial dating and mating" are "entirely unnatural";
the Nation ofIslam wants "separate schools", and
the NationalAlliance wantsto give whitechildren
"a race consciousness...thereby to make racial
patriots out of them." There were other noteworthy areas of overlap—notably in parallel calls for
racially pure nations—that reinforce the notion
that there is plenty more going on here thanblack
pride.
The controversies surrounding Louis Farrakhan
are well known, and will not be rehashed, but it
seems noteworthy that he did little to play down
his image as themarch approached. CallingAsians
and Jews "bloodsuckers" was only the most obvious manifestation: he also reiterated his call for
separatism (complaining of "irreconcilable differences") and excluded whites and women from
attending.
And while, quoth the Times, attendees at the
march stated that they came to support "issues, not
personalities", the buttons commemorating the
event—a faraway suggestion of a rally with
Farrakhan's face superimposed—suggest that the
organizers feel a tad differently. That Farrakhan
could go on being, well, himself, indicates thathe

felt no particular need to do so, and that the civil
rights movement—once part of the mainstream, a
movement that needs mainstream support—could

identify itself with such a leader as this implies a
lot of things about the state of that movement,
none of them good.
Your columnist's internal divisions are all the
more accentuated by therealization that the organizers did, in fact, get some things right. Call him
a reactionary or a sentimentalist if you like, but he
applauds the emphasis on "improving and affirming moral values in the black community." (Actually, he kinda thinks communities of all races
could use a bit of that. But hehas nothing against
racially specific appeals if they're heard.)
Renewed solidarity within the black commu-

nity, despite possibly troubling implications exacerbated by the messenger, is hardly a negative
thing; the presence, well documentedby the Times,
of a mostly middle-class, moderate black population at themarchindicates a beliefin the march no t
as an instrument of division, against whites or
anyone else, but as a means of reconciliation
between city and suburbs, poor and middle-class.
And your columnist supports that sentiment loudly.
But—even though he thinks many of the men at
the march were there for reasons he supports
Farrakhan's presence lends the whole idea an air
of conflict, ofseparatism, thatmakes it impossible
for him to endorse it.
Most discouraging is thereality that Farrakhan
is a product of the times as much as anything, a
symptom rather than a cause of the racial chasm
that extremist rhetoric widens. The O.J. verdict
evokes cheers from blacks and snide remarks
from whites, racial motivations evident in both
reactions; debates break out over whether the
races are truly intellectually equal; police brutality leads to race riots lead to separatist rhetoric
from both whites and blacks while liberals handwring. A Martin Luther King would be nearirrelevant today, when self-justification rather

Yes, yes, you're right. Common Sense last
week and Louis Farrakhan this week, your columnist makes a career out of shooting fish in barrels.
But Farrakhan seems a rather significant fish, all
things considered, given the hesitancy of that
erstwhile ideological ally, the white liberal—a
lonely species nowadays, true, but hardly irrelevant—to embrace the civil rights movement in
its current state.
The violence of the rhetoric, the extremism of
the racial politics, and the spirit of exclusion
deepen the distinctions between today's movement and thatof the sixties, and therefore make it
ever more unlikely that theNation of Islam or any
similar organization will ever spark a large-scale
mobilization on the left as was inspired by the
movement of thirty years ago, regardless of the
vehemence of action on the right. As long as
blacks in America seek to confine the movement
to themselves instead ofrallying against injustice
in generalized form, as long as they deny the
support and sympathy of the white left (think Jews
have something to do with it, oh Honorable Mr.
Farrakhan?), the Nation of Islam (and anything
associated with it) will stay where it belongs: on
the fringe.

To the Editors:
The recent move to abolish affirmative action
in academia reflects a common and widespread
misunderstanding of the meaning ofmeritand the
role of academic ability in judging merit. Academic standards rest on a myth- that high grades
equal real-world ability. In fact, they don't.
If a black person with a lower grade point
average or SAT score is admitted to to medical
school ahead of a white person with a 'higher
score, that doesn't mean that a less qualified
person has been admitted. He or shemay be more
qualified.
Scientific American reports:"Three decades of
research has led a group of investigators to conclude that excellent performance in medical school
(as measured by grades and scores on examinations) has no correlation with excellent performance in medical practice." In an article "Grades:
OneMoreTilt AttheWindmill" Arthur Chickering
notes that "evidence
massive evidence from
hundreds of studies, does not support the assumption that high grades mean successful graduates."

The same point is made by Ohmer Miltonm,
Howard R. Pollio and James A. Eison in Making
Sense of Grades. "Numerous studies going back
at least seventy-five yearsreveal that there is little
or no relationship between grades and any measure of adult accomplishment."
If colleges and universities were luxuries
availible to a few who wanted to pursue academic
studies and leave the commercial world to others,
we would be right in allowing colleges and universities to select on the basis ofacademic ability.
But if colleges and universities control access to
real-world jobs, then society is not well-servedby
admissions standards which fail to reflect real
world ability and merit.
Since academic ability does correlate with social class standing, I would guess there's an unwritten agreement between leading universities
and the upper half ofAmerican society that says:
"Give our children first-class tickets in the world
of training and certification, and we'll support
you." The move to abolish affirmative action
hears it loud and clear.

than finding common ground seems to be the
order of the day. Farrakhan's separatism had its
roots in the '6o's, of course, but it lacked the force
then that it has today—and it seems not so farfetched to link the appeal of that anti-integrationist sentiment to the economic realities that widen
the gap between have and have-not. Radicalism
has its base in radical disaffection, after all, and
poverty is one eternal source of discontent.

he takes off his rose-colored glasses in regards to
civil rights, he has trouble seeing with anything
other than a skeptical eye.

us to where we are now are reinforced and legitimated by the same sentiments that have Congress

CRAZY ONE-ARMED MAN, GIVE ME SOME CANDY!!
Strange Days: Strange, Strong Stuff Pandora's Psychic Predictions
by lan Bricke

Kathryn Bigelow's Strange Days is a
hallucinatory, semicoherent mess. It's
also one of the most intense movies of the
year, achieving a viscerally stunning
impact, something close to sensory overload. The film starts with a bang, plunging the audience into the midst of a virtual-reality robbery, narrated (like much
of the rest of Strange Days) with brilliant
point-of-view camerawork courtesy of
Bigelow and cinematographer Matthew
F. Leonetti. The clip
belongs to Lenny Nero
(Ralph Fiennes), an LA
vice cop turned downand-out dealer in
SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) technology. Lenny makes ends
meet by offering his clients pieces of other
people's lives, captured
on virtual reality
disks— sex, violence,
love, hate— you name
it, this self-styled
"Santa Claus of thesubconscious" can get it for
you.
Whenhe'snot out on

implausible series of revelations.
Cameron and Cocks don't have the guts
to follow through on their incendiary
premise. And that's a shame, because
Bigelow brings its world to life with eyepopping ferocity.
The LA ofStrange Days is one of the
most convincing urban purgatories ever
depicted on the silver screen (right up

there with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner
and Alex Proyas' The Crow). The streets
are packed with flaming wrecks and armored limousines, the skies are punctu-

Sizemore, both in unfortunately pivotal
roles, are, as usual, irredeemably bad).
Ralph Fiennes (the commandant in
Schindler's List) and Angela Bassett
(What's Love Got to Do With It) turn in
career-defining performances. Fiennes'
Lenny Nero is the last word in lovable
fast-talking sleazeballs. Fiennes makes
Lenny very, very human, more than just
a charming anti-hero, bringing out the
doomed romance in Lenny's unrequited
longing for Faith. But the show belongs
to Angela Bassett. Time and time again,
Mace saves Lenny's
sorry butt from as■ sorted bad guys.
Mace is the most convincing female action hero since the
Linda Hamilton

screenplay goes soft

Bassett is an absolute delight—sassy,

his apartment and watches his own clips,
digitized memories of his ill-fated love
affair with a rock singer named Faith
(Juliette Lewis), now the girlfriend of
diabolical music promoter, Philo
(Michael Wincott), whose superstar client, rapper JerichoOne (Glerm Plummer),
has just beenmurdered. Lenny's guardian angels, private detective Max (Tom
Sizemore) and bodyguard/chauffeur
Mace (Angela Bassett) are worried about
him, with good reason. Someone has •
handed Lenny SQUID clips of the brutal
deathof a prostitute and the assassination
of Jericho One. The evidence points to a
conspiracy, a conspiracy which could
plunge crime-ravaged LA, just a few
days short of the millennium, into an
apocalypse of violence.
Unfortunately, none of it is a complicated as it sounds. The screenplay, by
James Cameron (director of the Terminator films) and Jay Cocks, incorporates
everything from the LA riots to Mark
Fuhrman into its strobe-lit VR stew. It
isn't until the final twenty minutes that
the story is revealed as distinctly moldy

Strange Days is not all that strange
is 1995's America taken a step or two
closer to the abyss. The movie is at its
best when it is simply exploring this
near-future nightmare,coasting on a stateof-the-art soundtrack (Me Phi Me, Tricky,
Deep Forest, Peter Gabriel). Bigelow's
camera captures images of eyeball-searing power: two punks jumping a Salvation Army Santa Claus; a crowd, 10,000
strong, dancing in the streets of LA on
New Year's Eve; a blood-soaked cop, his
dead partner handcuffed to his wrist, staggering through the teeming revelers on a
mission of vengeance; the clinically brutalrape and murder of a prostitute, one of
the most horrifying scenes I have ever
seen. None of Bigelow's previous films
(Near Dark, Blue Steel, PointBreak) can
hold a candle to the feverish brillianceof
her work here.

tough and passionate. These perforlike
mances,
Bigelow's direction,

are more than the
material deserves.
Is Strange Days a
success? Yes and no. On a story-telling
level, the film is addled, at best. To
paraphrase T.S. Eliot, it ends with a whimper, not a bang. As a spectacle, as a threering circus of apocalypse, Strange Days
is a visionary triumph. Bigelow has
achieved everything that Oliver Stone
attempted to pull off in Natural Born
Killers. A fast, brutal, action picture.
Strange Days raises profound questions
about thepace, brutality, and violenceof
American society. The film acknowledges its own role in the creation and
glamorization of violence even as it indicts the audience for getting off on that
same violence (the audience, like Lenny's
SQUID-addicted clients, arepassiveparticipants in the film's horrors). Strange
Days is not necessarily a good film, but it
is an extremely important one. More
than any other film this year. Strange
Days acts as a fractured funhouse minor
image of today's America. And the reflection is anything but a pretty sight.

Sharples Was Never Like This:
"Love Bar"? Oh, Not Again!!!
If you could have sex as often as you
ate, you'd probably bitch a lot less. And
diets would be even more awful. Most
human beings on this campus recognize

think back to the "hygiene" chapter of
7th grade health.
So, you may ask, "How, then, do I
'swing it' in Sharpies?" "Now I know
whatnot to do, but can you accentuate the
positive?"
Well, surely. First, pseudo-sophistication reigns supreme: make your own
meals. Using the microwave is impressive, as long as you don't try to hard-boil
any eggs or re-enact that scene from
"Gremlins." The wok is, of course,
multicultural. Pretend to have a theory
about wok use, making comments like.

the intimate connection between love
and food. With this, we do not mean
"Golly, I sure love blintz bar!" There is
a much, much more direct connection.
As we all know, there are two dining
etablishments on this campus: Sharpies,
our ski-lodge-style dining hall; and
Tarble, our "snack" bar (not to be confused with our illustrious "blintz," "poUUo,""pasta,""Dean,""crow,""hotdog,"
"Power," "breakfast,"
"fantasy show," "polish
sausage", "behind,"
"veggie tempura," or
"zanzi" bars). There are

impressions upon one's

When eating a meal with
a "date," one must be surprisingly careful, and one
can be extremely crafty,
possibly acheiving a level of adeptness "Be sure to add the soy sauce after you
that matches that of the lady who carves cook the vegetables, or else you'll dehydrate the meal" or "An empty wok is like
sharks out of cucumbers in Sharpies.

Other foods to avoid include onion ever it was that Kim Basinger ate in "9 1/

utensils. Statements like "The eyes are

food to your mouth, and not vice versa.
See, mom was helping you out all along.
And if at all possible, place an extra chair
to your side, so that you can casually
drape your arm over it while talking
about wok theory for thethird time in the

while reading. See, don't
you look cool?
Now, the age-old question: to throw or not to

And then, the final, ecstatic climax—dessert. Get a bowl of pudding 4 feet
high and 3 feet wide. Say you're going to
"slip into something more comfortable."
There's also food waiting in theroom.
Try ordering Chinese, and say you made
it in the wok. Or anice stromboli, and say
you made it in the wok. Get out some
candles, wine glasses, and a little Ripple
(that's the wine that they serve at receptions here). And of course, plug in the

This Weekend's Night of Scenes
Showcases Scenes From Four Plays
By Anne Frankenfield

Looking for a change of pace for your
weekend?This Friday and Saturday night
at 8:00 in the LP AC is your chance. Night
of Scenes, a student-run drama production, is a compilation offour scenes taken
from various productions from wellknown playwrights. The idea behind this
small-scaled production is to get more
students involved in drama, in both the
acting and directing aspects.
The first scene is from theplay Franny
and Zooey, written by J.D. Salinger. Directed by Rebecca Roth '97, it is set in the
1950's and takes place in a bathroom in
which Zooey (Josh Lifton '9B) and his
mother (Paula loanide '99) discuss the
nervous breakdown of Zooey's sister,
Franny. The scene is basically a dialogue
between the two in which the mother is
concerned about Franny and is asking
Zooey for help. Roth describes her scene
as "funny and deep with some spiritual
themes."
A scene fromAUMenAre Whores: An
Inquiry, written by David Mamet, is the
next segment of the production. The director, Kevin Kish '9B, explains his scene
as fifteen monologues between two men

(Ilmi Gamoff '99 and Simon Harding
'99) and a woman (Courtney Clark '9B)
that are "emotionally forward, violent,
vulnerable, and sex-crazed." The three
characters are talking about crucial aspects of their lives that involve sex with

violent undertones. David Mamet's language is philosophical and overwrought.
The third piece differs from the others
in that it contains scenes from two plays
by different authors. Cut and Paste, directed by Stephen Svoboda '9B, includes
the famous balcony scene from
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and a
piece from Arthur Kopit's dark comedy
Oh Dad, Poor Dad. Momma'sHungYou
in the Closet and I'm So Sad. The latter
play begins this interesting scene.
Jonathon (Brantley Bryant '99) is a
seventeen-year-old who acts like he is
five because of his mother's pampering.
Jonathon's mother is anecropheliac who
killed his father. The other character in
the play, Rosalie (Zara Zambarado '9B),
is Jonathon's nineteen-year-oldbaby-sitter, a sex maniac who has never been able
to find love. She believes the only way to
loveand be loved is through sex. Rosalie
proceeds to seduce Jonathon, who becomes very scared. During this interac-

tion, the dead body of Jonathon's father
is discovered (corpse played by James

Harker '99).
After a surprise ending, the set switches
to the balcony scene with Romeo (Bryant)
and Juliet (Zambarado): Rosalie's vision
of what ideal love would be. The piece
then returns to the original set and the
actors revert back to their old characters
to end the unique production.
The final work is from The Valentine
Fairy by Ernest Thompson. Directed by

Professor Brings New Approach to English
By Kate Bernstein

Patricia White is only in her second
year as a faculty member at Swarthmore
and she has already implemented a much
needed change in the curriculum. Introducing such courses as Feminist Film
and Media studies; Lesbian and GayFilm
and Video; Women and Popular Culture:
Fiction, Film, and Television; American
Narrative Cinema; Film Genres; and
Colloquium: Film Theory and Culture,
White has opened up an opportunity for
film and media studies that was virtually
nonexistent in the past
White hopes that the new classes will
lead to further film opportunities at
Swarthmore. "Swarthmore was very late
in introducing film studies and considering it as a field worth studying," said
White. However, now that severalclasses
have been introduced. White hopes for
the formation of a film or media concentration and more film classes. While
White is amember of theEnglish Department faculty, her courses are cross-listed
with Women's Studies and Lesbian and
Gay Studies. "Everything I do is interdisciplinary. What attracts me to a liberal

Jazz lovers will be treated to the Myra
Melford Trio on Sunday, Oct 29th at
7:30 PM in the Lang Performing Arts
Center. The trio has been praised by
Village Voice as one of the "very best
small groups in jazz."
Described as "very much the complete
modern pianist," Myra Melford has
gained recognition as an important new
pianist and composer in the jazz-new
music scene both inEurope and the United
States. She is known for her innovative
approach to playing the inside of the
piano, applying mallets to strings and
reinforcing bars, bowing harmonics, and
other percussive techniques.
Melford has earned the praise of critics nationally. Opt ionMagazine says that
Melford has "dazzling speed and technique, but her unifying principle is a
vigorous, rock-solid blues/gospel sensibility," and that "she satisfies the soul as
well as the intellect...absolutely
timeless...executed with mastery."
As a "bracingly original soloist"
Melford has traveled all over the world,
performing at theBolzano Jazz Festival
in Italy, the Horfest in Austria, theWomen
Piano Meeting in Zurich, the Composers' Forum's series in NYC, NewLangton
Arts in San Francisco, Southend
Musicworks in Chicago, Yale University, the University of Massachusetts and
elsewhere.
In the fall of 1994, Melford was

awarded an Arts International grant to
travel and perform at festivals in Finland, Estonia, andLithuania. In 1993 she
received a Music Composition Fellowship from the New York Foundation for
the Arts. A semifinalist in theThelonious
Monk International Piano Competition,
she has been awarded a Harvestworks
Programming Residency and many Meet
the Composer performance grants. She
was also voted talent-deserving-widerrecognition in the 1991,1992, and 1994
downbeat critics' polls.
Drummer Reggie Nicholson andbassist Lindsey Horner are more than just her
accompanists. They have been described
as "strong players who are also very
astute listeners." Along with Melford,
the three have been together since the
spring of 1990 and "they can anticipate
and shadow each other, note for note."
Fans can enjoy the trio in four critically
acclaimed CD albums: "Alive in the
House of Saints," "Jump," "Now &
Now," and the recently released "Even
the Sounds Shine."
The performance on Sunday will be
preceded by a panel discussion with Myra
Melford. Leading the discussion will be
writer and critic Francis Davis and jazz
commentator Ludwig Van Trikt from
Philadelphia. The topic of the panel is
"Women in Jazz." The concert is the
first performance in the 'Three Stellar
Women Jazz Pianists" concert series
sponsored by the William J. CooperFoundation.

A more perfect script could not have
been written for the end of the women's
volleyball season. Winning each of its
last five matches, all against Centennial
Conference opponents, the team turned
what had been a disappointing season
into a success. Finishing 6-4 in the conference and 11-13 overall, the team set a
schoolrecord for most conference victories and established itself as one of the
best teams.
Each of the departing Seniors can be
very proud of what they accomplished
both personally, and as a team. Co-captain Nancy Rosenbaum '96 was the most
dominating athlete on the court all season. She hit the ball harder and ran down
more balls on defense than any other
player. But by the second half of the
season, she no longer felt like she had to
carry a large burden for the team. "Each
person didn't matter so much by the end
of the season, because the team was
playing well," she said.
Co-captain DianaBieber '96 seemed
to hit twice as hard during the second
half of the season than during the first
half. Always one of the most spirited
players on the court, she offered encouragement and support to the many freshmen and sophomores who got their first

significantexperience this season. She'll
always remember her final match as a
Bieber vs. Bieber contest. Alisa also led
her team, Haverford, to a school record
in conference wins, with three, but on
Wednesday Diana showed everyone
which Bieber led the better team.
Laura Pitman '96 was sidelined for
most of the season due to an injury to her
rotator cuffincurred during the first practice. She began playing again the week
before October break and has played
through her pain ever since. One of the
steadierpassers on the backline, Pitman
finally got her wish to hit against Ursinus
and recorded a couple kills.
The other senior on the team was
Marcela Escobari '96, but scheduling
conflicts prevented her from being a
full-time contributor. She has a fierce
serve and covered a lot of the court on
defense.
Second year Coach Larry Perry deserves a lot of credit for the winning
streak and successful season. The strategy and techniques he began teaching
last season finally paid off. His perseverance was noticed and appreciated by the
co-captains. "He's invested a lot more
time mis season. I feel like he put a lot of
thought into everything. It helped a lot of
players improve."

"His emphasis on defensereally helped
us get to where we are. I think the reason
it took so long was our faulC'said Bieber.

Rosenbaum also recognized the Garnet's
defensive improvement as a key point in
the season. "I think the turning point was
when we as a team started reminding
each other to always be ready to
move,"she said.
The Haverford match was ended fittingly on a block by Heather Stickney
'9B, who will be one of the key players
on next year's team and a favorite to
anchor the front line as a middle hitter.
Setter Jordan Hay '9B will be the most
experiencedplayer on the court, and will
have to assume a leadership role. Holly
Barton '99 was probably the rookie of
the year with hard-hitting Deena Bahri
'9B on her heels. Along with Christina
Costas-Russell '99, next year's team has
a core of young players with some varsity experience.

Rugby Teams Face Tough Opposition, Come
Up Short in Bids for Championship Play-offs
By Tony Sturm

Swarthmore Men's Rugby played two
games over break, beating Drexel to
qualify for theplayoffs, and then losing to
East Stroudsburg thenext Saturday to end
their post-season hopes.
When the Buzzards confronted Drexel,

thematch was full of meaning: thewinner
would proceed on to the playoffs, while
the loser would end their official season
The game was played in intermittently
pouring rain; therain would occasionally
stop just long enough for the players to
become caked with mud before starting
up again.
Swarthmore came out triumphant in
this particular match, winning 10-0.
Swarthmore's forwards once again
showedthat they are among thebest in the
league, compensating for their lack of
size with speed. They won almost every
ruck in the game, and crushed Drexel's
hopes of scoring with an incredible try
line stand in the second half.
"For the weather conditions, we played
an almost flawless game," said Guy
Danilowitz '96. "Our forward rucking
and the back's defense won us the game."
All of Swat's points came in the first
half. About halfway through the period,
Adam Blescia '97 tackled a Drexel back
around the Drexel 40 meter line. When
the back released the ball, Tony Sturm
'99 picked it up, and out ran a couple
Drexel players into the try zone to score
his first try. Chaz Teplin '96 made the
conversion to put Swat up 7-0, and five
minutes later, he kicked in a penalty to
finish off the scoring.
It looked like Drexel was going to answer, however, in the second half, when a
Swarthmore penalty was called less than
tenmeters away from their try zone. Drexel
elected to go for the try, and over thenext
ten minutes, had many opportunities to
score, but could never quite touch theball
down.
"That stand told Drexel that they
weren't going to score in the game," said
hooker Chris Jahnke '9B.
Swarthmore was able to put together a
remarkable stand over those ten minutes,
shutting out Drexel while withstanding
five Drexel scrums from the five meter
line and three Drexel penalty attempts
from within ten meters.
Jack Schecter '96, a back who made
some great open field tackles earlier in the
game, added, "The sheer force of our will
kept them out of our try zone. That, and
some great rugby."
Swarthmore also swept its first opponent this year, when in theB-side game,
Dan Green '99 scored all three tries and
kicked a conversion in an intense game of
seven on seven, as the Buzzard's B-side
defeated Drexel's B-side 17-12.
The win put Swarthmore into the playoffs, as Swat qualified to play East
Stroudsburg in thefirst round at home the
following Saturday.

and the play became very sloppy.
Swarthmore was missing several key
players, and the forward pack was full of
new players and players atnew positions.

Stroudsburg scored
their first nine points

In the second half,
Swarthmore had a
chance to gain some
ground because of
Strousdburg penalties
in their own end, but
failed to convert on a
trio oftheir own kicks,
missing all three wide right.
East Strousdburg iced the game with
ten minutes left, scoring the game's only
try. The kick was missed, but at the rate
points were being scored, there was a
feeling that the Evil Buzzards were not
going to come back.
The rugby team's season is not over
yet, however. They have a game tomorrow at Dupont field versus Villanova at
1 -.00. It is likely thelast home game of the
season for the Buzzards.

Even after enduring a Herculean

managed to pull together an awe-inspiring race that won them an amazing victory The women combatted the stress of
typical Swarthmore schoolwork with
persistant injuries and still managed to
claim a third place finish.
After a quick dash into the woodsled
by Swat's Ingrid Spies '96, the pack
settled down into their respective zones
for a few hills, a few dales, and some

team that received a third place finish.
Solai Buchanan '96 and Spies filled out
Swat's top seven in their heroic battles

Now that these women have gotten a

cross-country season needed any more

drama, fate dealt Swarthmore's Men's
Cross-Country a joker card this past week.
Coming off their most exhausting and
challenging week of training yet, a reduced squad raced competitively against
nationally ranked Haverford (#7), and
easily defeated Lincoln and Widener
Universities.
Kerry Boeye '97, Stephen Laubach
'96, and Gordon Rouble '99, had outstanding races— Boeye breaking into
Haverford's top five and coming within
15 seconds of Haverford's top four runners.
A rash of minor injuries and freak
accidents, however, have dampened the
spoils of this victory and forced the men
to recollect their spirits for November's
regional meet.

Missing
Swarthmore's top group are front runners Scott Reents '96, Graham Lucks
'9B, and Wyn Strodtbeck '9B. Reents
pulled a muscle in hisback while running
with friends at Bowdoin College over

recovering from pneumonia.
In the week following the race, captain and top-five runner Laubach suffered a severe ankle sprain while running
in the Crum. And as if there were a hex
on this season. Rouble had his foot run
over by a car on Wednesday. Laubach
will most likely not run this Saturday at
the Conference Championships, but
should be ready in two weeks for the
critical Regional meet.
Coach Ted Dixon remains upbeat in
the course of these events, maintaining
that the depth of this year's team can

grow stronger through them: "We anticipated being spanked by nationally ranked

Swarthmore women's badminton enthusiastically commenced practice thisweek
for the 1995-1996 season.

a positive outcome for the new season.
Under the guidance of coach Dan
Sears, in his second year with the team,
improvement is expected over last year's

The experience of many third and

Football... from page 1
Minero's extra point was no good and
12-6. Risky would be an
understatement to describe the ensuing
kickoff. The kickoff team lined up as
usual but MattMinero '96 kicked the ball
onside.The gamble paid off whenMinero
recovered his own kick at theS warthmore
47 yard line.
"While watching video of Dickinson
during the week, (defensive backs and
kickoff) Coach Nocito noticed a weakness in their alignment." said Minero.
"The on-side kick simply exploited this
weakness. It was a great coaching move
on his part."
With the momentum clearly on their
side, the GarnetTide offense setoutouce
again for the end zone. The offense advanced to the three yard line where the
field goal unit came out to attempt what
would have been a chip shot field goal.
Before Minero could attempt the kick,
Dickinson was penalized for an illegal
substitution. The ball was placed at die
one yard line and Head CoachKarl Miran
decided to go for it
Frank Amar stumbled into the end
zone, and the Minero extra point gave
Swarthmore a 13-12 lead. Swarthmore
had held the football for 12 consecutive
minutes and not only did they now have
the lead, but they were brimming with
confidence.
The Swarthmore lead, however, was
very short lived. The Red Devils once
again used theirunderrated passing game
to their advantage. The Red Devils covthe score was

ered 80 yards in just over three and a half
minutes, capped by a 22 yard McGee to
Henry Lewandowski touchdown pass.
The extra point attempt was no good,
making the score 18-13 Dickinson.
Not to be outdone, the Garnet Tide
also hit to the airwaves. Pat Straub '97
(11-21,118 yards) directed a 10 play, 64
yard drive, completing 4 of 5 passes for
52 yards, including a 13 yard touchdown
pass on a spectacular effort by receiver
Sam Paschel '96 (6 catches,7o yards).
With the score 19-18,the defense found
themselves in a very familiar situation:
protecting a lead in the fourth quarter.
The defensive front seven turned it up a
notch, withKeith Pieck '97 registering a
sack andKurk Selverian '97 and Joaquin
Sanchez '99 combining for a sack.
Dickinson was forced to punt, and
while the Garnet Tide was unable to add
an insurance score, they were able to run
three minutesoff the clock, and MattPoe
was able to pin Dickinson down at their
own five yard line.
With three minutes remaining and 95
yards to go, the Red Devils were determined to mount one last scoring drive in
an attempt to salvage the game. Abandoning the run, the Red Devils sought to
cover the vast difference through the air.
Once again, the contingent that had

ference match-ups. The team, whichhas
a record of 10-8, struggled but played
strong matches against top ranked conference and national teams.
On Saturday the 14th, the men traveled to Gettysburg to take on a very
strong team ranked second in theCentennial Conference. The offense, still struggling over the loss of leading scorer
Leonard Cuello '96, and the strong Swat
defenseplayed a hard-fought game,holding the score at 0-0 into overtime. The
team almost scored on a shot from Dave
Lane '97 but was unable to convert.
Gettysburg scored two goals in the extra
periods and won 2-0.
Wednesday, the Garnet fought back in
their home game against Ursinus. The
team played well, dominating the Ursinus
team for a large part of the game. Austin
Harris '99 and DaveLane '97 both scored
nice goals for the Garnet in their 2-1 win.
This win led the team to Muhlenburg
and thebest competition they had met all
season. The game, originally scheduled
for Saturday the 21st, was pushed to
Sunday because of heavy rains.
Muhlenburg, ranked in the top 20 in
the nation, gave the Garnet a great game.
The Swat team suffered a 4-1 loss with
