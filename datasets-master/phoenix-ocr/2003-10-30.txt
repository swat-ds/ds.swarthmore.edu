Election memos now
hosted by 30 schools
Swarthmore shuts down links to
anti-war site, plans future action
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

In the past week, computer users at 30 other colleges and universi-

ties have broken the law by possessing more than 13,000 potentially
damaging memos written by employees of a national voting machine
corporation, all following the initial example set by a student at
Swarthmore.
In that same week, Swarthmore itself has taken further steps to
comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), of which

it found itself in violation last week when it received two cease-anddesist orders sent from Diebold Election Systems Inc., a voting

machine firm.
The orders demanded the removal of more than 13,000 memos taken

from an internal Diebold Web site that was accessible to the public.
Diebold, in the order, claimed that possession of the memos constitut-

Swarthmore students may pay up to 50 percent more for textbooks than students in other countries.

Bookstore defends prices
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu
An article that appeared in The New York Times
last week brought to light the skyrocketing costs of
college course materials and some students' discovery that American publishers sell their textbooks for
much less abroad.
Whether the Swarthmore Bookstore has lost
sales because of publishers' high domestic prices is
not easy to tell.
"Lost sales are difficult to track," Bookstore
Director Kathy Grace said, "but I'm sure there has
been some effect." In general, she said, the percentage of assigned books students buy at all is going
"down, down, down." Grace named an increase in
borrowing from the library and sharing with classmates as possible reasons.
As for the bookstore's view on students buying
online, Grace said her goal as director was simply to
cover expenses for course materials.
"If students have found ways to do things that
cost them less, that's fine with us," Grace said. The
bookstore is expected to make a return on general
merchandise but not on course materials.
"I am absolutely not saying we're the cheapest
game in town," she added. "But I'm also not saying
we're the most expensive game in town. I think our
prices are in the ballpark with what other online
bookstores have them for."
The inexpensive overseas market has prompted
the Swarthmore bookstore itself to purchase some
texts from foreign countries, which it sells for the
price of a used version. The Times article gave the
example of a biology textbook that cost $146.15 on
amazon.com but $63.48, plus $8.05 for shipping, on
amazon.co.uk, the British Amazon site.
The article also claimed that "just like prescription drugs, textbooks cost far less overseas than they

THE PHOENIX

do in the United States." But economics professor

and department chair Mark Kuperberg rejected the
comparison, pointing out that governments regulate
prescription drug prices but not those of textbooks.

A reserved-students e-mail the bookstore staff
sent last week said the American publishing indus-

try had defended its practice of overcharging booksellers in the United States by claiming that it must
pay all of its development and marketing costs
through U.S. sales.
Better than comparing the textbook market to
that of prescription drugs, Kuperberg said, would be
to ask two questions: why the domestic and foreign
prices for books are different in the first place and
how they have managed to stay that way.
"The first part is still a bit of a puzzle to me,"
Kuperberg said. "I'm still perplexed about why [the
publishing industry] thought they could get away
with higher prices in the U.S."
Charging different prices for textbooks here and
abroad is an example of price discrimination, he
said, in which manufacturers charge people in different locations for the same thing. But he said he
was unsure of why the publishing industry was able
to force higher prices on Americans. Price discrimination is possible because people value things differently depending on where they live, Kuperberg
said, but does that difference in value exist between
Americans and Europeans?
The question of why the prices have remained
different has a simpler answer. Until 1998, the United
States did not allow Americans to re-import textbooks sold cheaply abroad, citing copyright law. But
the Supreme Court ruled against the American publishers five years ago. The consequences are appar-

ent now.

"It's taken a few years for that to work its way

ed copyright infringement.
A user at the college, who is also a member of the organization Why
War?, had gained access to the memos and had stored them on his hard
drive.
The college disconnected that user's computer from the network last
week, complying with DMCA safe harbor guidelines, which protect the
college legally in possible cases of copyright infringement. But the
memos are still available on the group's Web site, www.why-war.com,
and have been for the three weeks.
The college has also taken steps to ask any user providing a link to
the Why War? Web site to remove it, a move that Dean of the College
Bob Gross '62 said was recommended by the college's legal advisers.
Group member Micah White 'O4 characterized the move as ridiculous. "That's the whole point of the Internet, is linking. It's our college
basically going as far as possible to take a stand on these memos," he
said.
Even so, White said, in the past week, when it became known that

"Why War? is asking us for an immediate
decision, and this is something that
requires a deliberative process."
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62
the college user and Why War's Web site carried the memos, more than
20,000 to 30,000 users worldwide have downloaded the entire archive of
communication between Diebold employees. That amounts digitally to
more than 11 megabytes. Users at 30 other schools, by downloading the
memos, have now raised the risk for their institutions of facing a similar order, and four already have.
"What's really interesting is, as far as I know, there's very few
examples of mirroring controversial materials across colleges and universities," White said.
Why War? members, however, expect that their server will be likewise receive a cease-and-desist letter within the week. White said they
were unsure how the server managers would respond. "Our host has
told us that they believe mirroring [of the memos] is legal," he said.
National media, including The New York Times and MSNBC, have
been questioning the corporation more and more in the past few
months regarding the quality of its product, which is used by roughly
52 percent of polling places in America. The company's chairperson
has aroused concern by raising $9,000 for President Bush personally
and raising more than $lOO,OOO from other donors for the President's reelection campaign.
At their most potentially damaging to Diebold, the memos state that
a smart card available for purchase to the public could change the
number of votes registered by a machine. They also reveal that in one
precinct in Florida in the 2000 Presidential elections, Al Gore received
negative 16,000 votes, an impossibility on a paper ballot.
White continued to criticize the college's refusal to take a stand on
the issue, but he said there was hope for a change. "We're not giving up
on Swarthmore," he said. "We think Swarthmore still has the chance
to change its decision and support legal voting. One thing we think

that measures would be

The council is planning
another fireside chat for
November with members of
the Board of Managers.

"Now is the time to reach out to new
donors," Malcolm said. "That is the only
way we'll ever achieve this."
Malcolm is confident that the goal of
$230 million, the highest in college history, will be reached.
"I'm very optimistic about our capacity to achieve the goal, and yes, I also recognize it's an extremely ambitious goal,"
he said.
In comparison, the last campaign's
goal was $75 million, and the college
raised about $9O million. The reason for
the recent unprecedented ambition of
"The Meaning of Swarthmore" is simple:
"The college just needs more money
now," Malcolm said.
"If we want to preserve our pre-eminence and our standard of excellence, we
need to add new programs, and if we
want to add new programs, we need new
money," he said.
The funds from the campaign are
designed to support a wide variety of
projects and programs to achieve these
aims. The money will go to preserving
need-blind financial aid, staff the multicultural affairs office, providing internship opportunities, strengthening the
athletics program, expanding career
services, supporting the honors program, hiring new faculty members and
constructing the new Science Center and
residence hall, as well as many other
projects.

campaign has faced since July of 1999,
including a slow economy, war, the deci-

before the planned date of the campaign's national public kick-off event.
The attacks caused the event's postponement, setting the college back over

$lOO,OOO.
"It really hasn't been the best time to
throw a campaign," said Dan West, vice
president for development, alumni and
public relations.
Eldridge credited the success of the

campaign so far to "generosity on one
side, hard work on the other."
West said the development office had
done much more face-to-face fundraising
than it has in the past.
"There really isn't any other way to
raise money," he said. "Face-to-face
interaction is by far the best way to do it.
You can send out letters all day, but, in
the end, you've actually got to get out
there and see somebody. And we've been
in touch with an awful lot of people."
Malcolm said the campaign had
acquired the most of its donations from
alumni and "friends of the college." It
also receives significant contributions
from corporations, the government, and
foundations.

ITS block on P2P traffic may be permanent
BY GARTH SHELDON-COULSON
gsheldol@swarthmore.edu

After a spell of fierce network worms, Information
Technology Services is considering blocking peer-to-peer
music sharing for good.

Swarthmore's connection to the Internet has taken a
beating over the past two weeks, often slowing to a crawl
or becoming completely inaccessible as newly written
worms exploited holes Microsoft Windows systems all
over campus. Two aggressive new file-sharing programs
flooded the network with data packets, overrunning ITS's
firewall machines.
In response to the overload, ITS blocked all file-sharing
programs last Tuesday, which have been disabled ever
since. Now, ITS staff indicate that, although the outages
were caused by a mixture of afflictions, a permanent
choice might have to be made between "academic" network traffic and "entertainment" traffic.
Colleges and universities all over the country have
been dealing with similar problems, according to ITS

4

Director Judy Downing.

"Many schools block P2P traffic permanently. Our consultants are always amazed at how open we allow our net-

work to be," she said.

A problem for ITS staff is that, while they can block filesharing to reduce stress on the network, they cannot easi-

ly predict or prevent attacks from new worms and viruses.
File sharing and worm attacks combined can bring down
the network, as students experienced last week.
"The nature of these worm attacks has changed," ITS

Network Manager Mark Dumic said. "They are a lot more
complicated now, and they aren't going away."
Despite the dangers, ITS is working to restore the net-

work to the status quo ante, at least for now. "At the
moment, we're just working out the finer technical points
of restoringP2P," Downing said. She added that Bit Torrent
and Blubster, the two programs most responsible for the
overload in file sharing traffic, will remain permanently
blocked.
But, regardless of ITS's progress, some students are fed
up.

October 30, 2003

"It's unreasonable," Chase Dußois 'O7 said, of the idea
that ITS might block file sharing permanently. "They're
here to manage network traffic, not manipulate it. They
can probably figure out a better solution."
ITS, however, places some of the onus on students to
alleviate the problem. "There is an element of personal
responsibility here," said Downing. "We may have to
look to the student entertainment realm to fix the problems."
She added, "Swarthmore is always in touch with peer
institutions, both small and large. Everyone is experimenting with different strategies."
Two recent changes to Swarthmore's infrastructure

might help. The college recently negotiated a new bandwidth agreement with its Internet service provider,
increasing available bandwidth by 50 percent. A new firewall was also put in place last week.
The file sharing question will be decided by ITS and the
higher-ups in the college's administration. For now, students can only hope that file sharing is restored soon, even
if it might be down again before long.

Students, professor offended by Zionist speaker
Klein blames Palestinian terrorism for Israeli-Palestinian conflict
BY ELEANOR JOSEPH

ejosephl@swarthm ore.edu

Since the day posters went up around the Swarthmore
campus advertising Morton Klein's lecture, sponsors
Students for Truthful Israel Representation and the Forum
for Free Speech found their signs defaced and ripped from
the walls.
"I think it's kind of disappointing that students ripped
down signs. Students assumed they knew what was going
to be said. In addition, they are not allowing for free
speech," STIR President Randy Goldstein 'O5 said.
Goldstein indicated that Swarthmore students needed
to understand that Klein was influential both in the
American government and the Israeli Knesset. Goldstein
also noted that there was no defacing of property when
Palestinian journalist Ali Abunimah spoke at the college
last month.
Klein, the current national president of the Zionist
Organization of America, had an underlying premise on
which he based his presentation to the Swarthmore community last Monday.
He said the majority of active Palestinians held as their
political agenda the "undermining of Israel's survival as a
Jewish state." Klein argued that the war was a religious
one rather than territorial.

"The Peace Process should not continue until terrorism stops and
[Palestinian] obligations are fulfilled.
End of discussion."
Morton Klein
To support his assertion, Klein gave statistics and a
substantial amount of history on the Middle East. He said

the Middle East is comprised 22 Arab countries that take
up a land mass twice the size of the United States and that
the land known as Israel takes up one-sixth of one percent
of this land. Klein stressed the importance of facts and history throughout his presentation.
"It is extremely important to state the facts. History is
not irrelevant, but rather extremely pertinent," Jon
Fombonne 'O5 said.
"The point that was really brought home to me was
that Mr. Klein deeply and sincerely believes that most
Palestinian Arabs still want to destroy the state of Israel.
Based on that assumption, his beliefs are fairly reasonable," math professor Steve Maurer said.
Klein advocated a hard-line stance against Palestinian
terrorism. "The peace process should not continue until
terrorism stops and [Palestinian] obligations are fulfilled.
End of discussion," Klein said.
Klein promoted the end of Israeli appeasement toward
Palestinians to show that the world would not tolerate violence in the form of terrorism. Klein also said he believed
Palestinian terrorism the greatest threat to the world since
Nazism. He made other statements comparing the
Palestinian regime to the Nazi regime, which clearly upset
some students who attended the presentation.
When probed by questions regarding instances of
Israeli military brutality, Klein continued to revert back
to his underlying idea that Israeli military force in most
forms was necessary for security in Israel and was solely used in response to terrorism on the part of the
Palestinians and their "holy obligation to hate and kill

Jews."
Klein said that the Israeli government had tried all its
other options and is left with no choice but to continue
military mobilization until Palestinian terrorism comes
to a halt.
As expected, many Swarthmore students took issue to
Klein's argument. One student described the lecture as
"beyond awful." Fombonne said that he felt Klein had
made "sweeping generalizations and didn't convincingly
back up his arguments."
He pointed out that at times, Klein changed what he
was saying. "He had just finished saying that there was no

increase in the number of Israeli settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, but then he turned around and said
that there were, but it was out of desperation," Fombonne
said.
Maurer said he did not necessary agree with Klein but
understood where he was coming from.
"Personally, I'm discouraged that a fair percentage of
advocates of Israel hold these opinions. Everyone would
like to see some progress soon. I guess [Klein] believes
that playing that sort of hardball might make a difference, but I suspect it would lead to more violence. I don't
see how there can be a resolution."
Mix Gould-Werth 'O7 felt "STIR betrayed their
acronym. It was the least truthful representation of
Israel that I've seen. It was so racist." Contrary to what
Klein was stating, Gould-Werth said, "I don't think that
Israel has offered something that should have appealed
to Palestinians."
Not all students, however, were so disappointed with
the presentation. Ross McCullough 'O7 said he was glad
that Klein had come to campus.
"I definitely think that people at Swat needed to hear
that viewpoint. The impression I've gotten so far is that
people here are pretty intellectually arrogant, which was
an issue for Klein. Students did not receive Klein as
warmly as they did Abunimah, whose lecture I also

attended," McCullough said.
While McCullough said he largely agreed with what
Klein said, he was "not quite as optimistic as [Klein] is. I

October 30, 2003

don't actually believe that there is a solution right now.
Eventually, there will be so much violence that they'll call
for peace, but I don't see a resolution outside of that."
During parts of his presentation, Klein did not properly allow students to finish or formulate their questions
before responding.
Maurer said, "I had no problem with Mr. Klein's talk,
but I did have a problem with the way he was 'having a
dialogue' with the students. With one particular student,
he didn't let a word go by with which he disagreed."
"I was the only faculty in the audience," Maurer said.
"And I felt I was the only person who could speak out. If
you speak at a college, you sometimes get speeches
rather than questions. Klein needed to try and give students a little more slack."
McCullough agreed that Klein was slightly aggressive
in the way he interrupted people and that he wasn't as
respectful as he could have been. "But he definitely
brought passion to the issue, which was what came out,
not blatant disrespect." In addition, McCullough said,
"Some of the kids were kind of playing the victim. If
you're coming to Swarthmore and you're asking a question of a speaker, you should be able to take counterassault."
McCullough described Maurer as coming off as a little
condescending, insinuating that the students couldn't
handle the counter-arguments.
He concluded by saying that Maurer "definitely had
our best interest at heart and acted in good faith."

Israeli women share a peaceful vision
Three Israeli women representing the Christian,
Jewish and Muslim faiths spoke at the Scheuer Room last
Tuesday at the lecture "Jerusalem Women Speak: Three
Women, Three Faiths, One Shared Vision."
They emphasized that Israel's illegal military occupation of the West Bank was the root cause of the PalestinianIsraeli conflict.
Palestinian women Rawan Damen, a Muslim, and Mai
Nassar, a Christian, spoke of life for Palestinian Muslims
and Christians under occupation. Yehudit Keshet, an
Israeli Jew, told the audience that the only way to achieve
peace and justice is to end oppression of Palestinians.
The women brought with them a range of life experi-

ences to the lecture. According to organizer Saed Atshan
'O6, Damen, 24, is a children's rights activist, author and

documentary maker. Along with her sister, Damen has
studied Hebrew with Jewish adults in Israel. Nassar, an
English professor at Bethlehem University, has had her
home bombarded several times during battles between the
Gilo settlement and Beit Jala. Keshet is the founder of The
Tradition Center, a cooperative, multi-cultural puppet theater that works with sources common to Jewish, Christian

and Muslim traditions.
The event was sponsored by Students Against the
Occupation and the President's Office. It was part of a
speaking tour organized by Partners for Peace, a non-profit organization which for over ten years has sought to educate the American public about key issues in the quest for
peace and justice in the Middle East.

CNN correspondent defends right-wing viewpoint

in an extensive political career and her

surprising opposition to the Iraq war.
"I enjoy speaking to young people, particularly liberals," Buchanan said when asked
about coming to Swarthmore. "I find they
aren't as familiar as they think about conservative ideas and are able to have a more
open mind when they are better informed."
"I'm still in politics because the only
time you're beat in this game is when you
quit," Buchanan said about her career in
politics. Buchanan, former campaign manager for her brother Patrick Buchanan's
bid for the presidency, spoke about three
lessons she has learned in her career that

Love of People," "A Love of Ideas" and "The

Politics of Intimidation."

"I like being called an activist and a

"Although I'm a liberal and don't agree
with many of her beliefs, I believe Ms.
Buchanan correctly identified the problems that confront the Democratic and
Republican parties," Patrick Hart 'O6 said.
Buchanan said both Democrats and
Republicans were hindered by what she
called "the politics of intimidation," where
members of both parties are afraid to take
a strong stance on anything, particularly a

controversial topic, for fear of losing a

reelection or being called too radical.
"You need to go through the firestorm in
politics," Buchanan said. "You must have
courage of your convictions."

Buchanan said she was against the Iraq

war because she did not believe there to be
an imminent threat in Iraq and did not support the "global army" that seems to be
forming in the United States. Buchanan
said she did not blame Bush for the war in
Iraq because she believed he truly thought

there to be an imminent threat.
Instead, she blamed Congress for
approving a war they believed to be wrong,
a month before an election and at a time
when polls indicated that Americans were
in favor of the war.
"In the past, the Republican speakers

we have had on campus spoke about strictly conservative topics," Randy Goldstein
'O5, president of the College Republicans
said. "The College Republicans thought
that Ms. Buchanan could appeal to a wider
variety of Swarthmore students based not
upon shock value but pure interest."
"Her perspective is unique," Matt

Students join ACT UP in AIDS fight
BY ANDREW SNIDERMAN
asniderl@swarthmore.edu

On Sept. 14, 1989, five members of ACT
UP, the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power,
chained themselves to the VIP balcony in
the New York Stock Exchange. Trading
halted immediately.
One thousand activists converged on
Wall Street that day to protest exorbitant
prices for AIDS drugs set by profiteering

pharmaceutical companies. Soon, prices
for AZT, then the only effective drug to
fight AIDS, fell precipitously.
Fourteen years later, ACT UP's fight
against AIDS continues, and Swarthmore
has joined the campaign.
On Oct. 19, Jean Schneider 'O6 participated in the annual 12-kilometer AIDS
Walk in Philadelphia. The walk blends
exercise with fund raising. Schneider
raised more than $lOO for "more than 40
organizations providing AIDS education,
prevention and direct service care to people living with HIV in the nine-county
Philadelphia region," according the AIDS

Walk Philly Web site.
"People were coming from a lot of different perspectives," Schneider said. "I
was pleasantly surprised by the number of
high school students."
Schneider spoke to a mother of an AIDS
victim as well as numerous exercise buffs
content to walk or run for a good cause.
Schneider is a leading member of a
chapter of the Student Global AIDS
Campaign, which emerged at Swarthmore
this fall. The SGAC is the biggest student
grassroots AIDS group in the United
States. Its priorities include ensuring
access to life-saving drugs for AIDS
patients around the world, dropping illegitimate foreign debt and pressuring the

United States into increasing AIDS-related
foreign aid.
"We're planning a number of events for
this semester," SGAC member Abena
Mainoo 'O6 said. "These will include two
more postcard-writing campaigns focusing
on debt relief and access to essential medicines, one all-campus teach-in on the week
of Nov. 10 and a World AIDS day fundraiser on Dec. L"
The organization ACT UP combines let-

"ACT UP was founded by people with
AIDS who looked at long-term strategy but
who also had a strong sense of urgency,"

Dinsmore said.

Today, about 40 people attend meetings
every Monday, though many more participate in various campaigns, and thousands
attend ACT UP rallies. Members include
medical students, undergraduate students,
the homeless and other volunteers like
Dinsmore and Krass. Many members have
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
"It's easy to figure out your priorities
when you're constantly working with people with AIDS," Dinsmore said.
ACT UP is currently organizing a
demonstration on Nov. 24 protesting the
Bush administration's deadly policies for
people with AIDS, both at home and
abroad. It will revolve around "the undermining of the Global Fund for TB and
malaria and [Bush's] own global AIDS
plan; the attacks on good prevention programs that reach out to queers, drug users
and promotion of 'abstinence-only' programs; and the underfunding of the AIDS
how most peoDrug Assistance Program
ple in the U.S. get their AIDS drugs,"
according to Dinsmore.
Last spring, during the state of the
union address, President George W Bush
promised $lO billion in new international
AIDS funding.
But Krass views the current administration's AIDS initiative more as a public
relations campaign than as a firm commitment to fight global AIDS.
Since the announcement, the United
States has failed to fully fund the AIDS bill
it authorized or to prod its allies to mobi-

ter-writing, lobbying, direct action, strategic press work and grassroots organizing
in its effort to garner attention and support
for people infected with AIDS.
In 1987, a group of predominantly white,
gay men who were HIV-positive founded
ACT UP. Not a single founding member is
alive today.
Kate Krass, a member of the group since
1989, calls ACT UP the "best, fastest way to
win against AIDS. It's the best group in
Philly and the best group in the country,
and it has been for 10 years," she said.
Allison Dinsmore, from Maryland,
joined ACT UP Philly three years ago. She
spends 10 to 20 hours a week working for
ACT UP, in addition to her job as a massage

lize against AIDS.
There are currently 300,000 people outside the United States receiving drugs to

combat AIDS, Krass said. "There is a
capacity for 480,000 more people to receive

treatment," she added.
The Bush administration justified its
billion-dollar cut in AIDS funding this year
based on a lack of absorptive capacity of
countries receiving foreign aid.
"It's a lie that there is no absorptive
capacity. The gap is money, not infrastructure," Krass said.
The current administration's plan calls
for setting up new infrastructure by
American non-governmental organizations
to deliver aid. According to Krass, six million people will die from AIDS before the
new Bush plan goes into effect.

Swarthmore activists should pay close
heed to Krass's accumulated wisdom from
14 years with ACT UP.
"Activist victories are completely different from victories for people with AIDS,"
Krass said.

"The question is not, 'What can we do?'
but 'What will work?'
You have to pick
the most effective tool for the job," Krass
...

said.
Krass explained that not all forms of
activism which generate press and make
activists feel good are always very effective

at changing policies.

"Is the boat full of drugs going to the

afflicted country? Are their lives

improv-

ing?" asked Krass. "This is what really
matters."
SGAC will be tabling today in Sharpies,
advocating relief of illegitimate debt for
countries severely affected by the AIDS
pandemic.
ACT UP meets every week at 13 Pine
Street in the basement of St. Luke of
Epiphany. They are organizing a demonstration on Nov. 24 in DC. Free buses leave
Philadelphia at 8 a.m.

30 schools join Diebold memo dispute

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Wednesday's public

people don’t realize is, if someone doesn’t stand up,

this issue won’t get resolved until after President
Bush’s re-election. It’s a necessity. Someone’s got to
take a stand.”
Though Gross said the college was unwilling to
engage in an act of civil disobedience and allow the
memos on its server, White said there were other
options. One possibility would include forming an ad
hoc committee to investigate the potential educational value of the memos, which would involve students
and faculty members reading all of the more than
13,000 documents.
The University of California at San Francisco in
2001 set a precedent by doing just that when several of
its students obtained memos potentially harmful to
several large tobacco companies. Though the companies brought legal action, the university ultimately
won the case that questioned its decision to form a
committee, which took place in the United States
Supreme Court.
Gross did not rule out this or other future options,
all of which are currently under discussion. “I
wouldn’t say that’s out of the question, but [Why War?
is] asking us for an immediate decision, and this is

something that requires a deliberative process,” he
said, adding that such a process would have to involve

the Board of Managers.
“I’m not familiar with the UCSF situation, but it
may have taken them a little time too,” the dean
added. “I think it’s something we should look into.
We’re not in a position to say the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act is wise or even that the orders we’ve
received from attorneys are compliant [with the
DMCA].”
Gross received about 300 to 400 e-mails before last

meeting in Parrish Parlours,
where the dean and the head of Information
Technology Services answered the college's questions
about the situation. All the e-mails praised him for
protecting the user who was holding the possible illegal memos.
After the meeting, the college announced it would
disconnect that user's computer, but support any
counter-notice sent to Diebold questioning whether
possession of the memos was, in fact, copyright
infringement, as Diebold charged in its cease-anddesist order.
After the meeting, and in the week since, Gross
said he has received "another few hundred calling me
a coward."
Swarthmore will soon issue a statement explaining
its actions to the community, the dean added. "So far,
the characterization of the college's reaction is [solely] from Why War?" he said, implying a dissatisfaction with that situation.
Though the college has not heard from the 30 others now, according to Diebold, in violation of the
DMCA, Gross said Swarthmore welcomes discussions
on the subject. "We'd be happy to engage with others
in seeing this about," he said. "We'd certainly like to

MIT students unveil
file-sharing alternative
BY JASON AMIRHADJI
CAVALIER DAILY (U. VIRGINIA)
(U-WIRE) CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

Amid a continu-

ing campaign by the Recording Industry Association of
America to crack down on Internet users suspected of illegal
file sharing, two students at MIT unveiled Monday a new
system to legally distribute music to students and faculty on
campus.

The Library Access to Music Project uses the campus television cable system to broadcast music to listeners, who
can go online and sign up to customize the playlist on any
one of 16 available music channels.
Unlike digital music distribution systems over the
Internet, such as iTunes and Rhapsody, LAMP broadcasts
over an analog medium and is therefore subject to less
restrictive copyright laws similar to those that govern radio
transmissions, according to an MIT press release.
The project cost approximately $35,000, or 60 cents per
student, and was funded by iCampus, a collaboration
between MIT and Microsoft Research.
The majority of the cost, $25,000, went toward acquiring
the music and licenses necessary for distribution.
The physical equipment that runs the system was purchased off the shelf for $lO,OOO.
The students who designed the project are releasing the
source code royalty-free so that other colleges and even local
communities could implement similar systems.

licly."

Swarthmore Coalitionfor the Digital Commons, a

student group which considered filing a counter-suit
against Diebold, would not comment on the situation.
As of yesterday evening, memos were hosted by
students at schools including Amherst, Boston
University, Duke, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, UC
Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of
Pennsylvania, University of Southern California and
Yale. A cease-and-desist order was sent to MIT on
Tuesday and UPenn on Wednesday.

said.

CBS radio and CNN Headline
News have produced features on
the high prices American publishers charge domestic bookstores and their effect on college
students who already pay expensive tuition, according to an email to college store staff from
Laura Nakoneczny, spokesperson
for the National Association of
College Stores. She also said ABC
Evening News was preparing a
segment on students who import
books and resell them to other
students.
The Times article profiled two
men who began buying American

textbooks from other countries

and reselling them to students
when they were juniors at

Williams. The phenomenon of
purchasing a product at a low
price in one location and reselling
it in a place where people typical-

ly pay

more is called arbitrage,

Kuperberg said, and, "where it's
possible, it always defeats price

discrimination."
A letter to The Times from
Patricia S. Schroeder claimed the
high prices students pay for
course materials at college bookstores included "a 'mark-up' that
may well exceed the 25 to 30 percent acknowledged by bookstores.
The same is true for 'used' textbooks, which the bookstores sell
at a hefty 'mark-up' over the 'buyback' price the stores pay to the
students who originally pur-

chased them as new editions."
Schroeder is president and chief
executive of the Association of
American Publishers.
Swarthmore's bookstore uses
a 20 percent margin on most new
books, which means it purchases
a book for 80 percent of its selling
price and uses the remaining 20
percent to cover expenses, such as
shipping fees, returns and labor.
If the bookstore purchases texts

The Left: 'rocking, really, really
BY ROZINA ALI
ralil@swarthmor.edu
A little to the left. A little more
to the left. Keep going. Just a little
more to the left. OK, stop. The
Left. That's perfect.
That's
what
exactly
Swarthmore's only hip-hop and
rock band thinks of its new name,
The Left. With a slight makeover
since it was first born this time
last year, The Left has been rocking through Swarthmore as well
as other places such as Camden,
N.J., where it performed this
summer. Many students on campus may know the band by its former name, "A Little to the Left."
Along with other changes, however, the band decided to change its
name to "The Left."
Why? Because "A Little

to the Left" disregards the sylla-

ble rule that says bands shouldn't
have names with six syllables or
more, according to

the band's

drummer, Karen Zaino 'O6. "A-Little-to-the-Left. That's six syllables. That's a mouthful," Zaino
said. "The Left. That's just two
syllables. It's just The Left."
Now, with an only a two-sylla-

ble band name and six members

with diverse backgrounds, The
Left is finally beginning a year
after its birth. Apart from a rising
reputation and a new name, The
Left isn't like other bands on campus in other respects. With a laid
back singer, a funny guitarist, an

enthusiastic pianist, a mysterious
bass player, a wannabe sexy

drummer and an energetic vocalist, how could it be? The differing
musical talents of Olivia Harman
'O4, Ben Sailer 'O6 , Michael Duffy
[???],
James Golden 'O5, Karen
Zaino 'O6, and Adrian Mathur
[???] in compose The Left and create a band that is awesomely
unique, Zaino said.
"The Left is different from
other Swat bands because we play
a different kind of music. Most
other bands on campus play indie
and punk rock. While we use elements of those genres in our
music, our songs have also been
heavily influenced by hip-hop
and, to an extent, jazz and funk as
well," guitar player Sailer 'O6
said.
Zaino agreed. "It's very interesting, almost an innovative
approach, to it just because we're
all such different musicians. And,
also, I think we're good enough
that we can use our differences
rather than just sounding incoherent," she said.
Veronica Betancourt 'O6, a fan
of The Left, said the diverse collection of musicians set the band
apart from others because members were always willing to try
something new. "I feel like they're
definitely ambitious and committed to creating new sounds all the
time. They also have a great campus presence," she said.
The band, however, wasn't
always rockin' *n' rollin' its way
into the hearts of its fans. It has
undergone many changes since it
first started last year. Jeff Wu, a

Swarthmore alum, founded the
band late last September, and left
to study furniture-making at an
art school in New York, according
to Zaino. The lead singer, also a
Swarthmore alum, left the band,

as well.
The loss of the two members
allowed the band to recruit new
members to its group. After deliberation, the band took on Golden
and Harman into the group."lt
was a very difficult process.

Many talented singers applied.
We did turn down both Madonna
and Cher, deciding that Olivia
[Harman] had both a nicer name
and a nicer singing voice and a
more photogenic face. Those were
the main criteria," Zaino said.
The decision seemed to be the
right one. Harman fits easily into
the band, according to Zaino.
"I love the process of working
out new songs. The kids in this
band are very cool, and we have
fun and it is lovely to get together
for the sake of music," Harman
said.
The popularity of The Left
with its audience suggests that its
fans, too, prefer Harman's singing
skills to those of Cher and
Madonna.
"They've gotten a lot better
since last year. They seem to be
comparatively pretty good and
pretty much in tune," Rachel
Shorey 'O6 said.
Although they have praise for
the band, some fans are skeptical

about The Left's future.
"I can't really imagine all of

them giving up everything else
do in order to be in a band,
which is what I feel like you need
to do to make it," Shorey said.
Sailer, however, has higher

Passing the time: a meditation on the noblest of arts
BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadoll@swarthomore.edu
An extremely urgent issue has been addressed to me by
several of my comrades, who all desire ardently to know:
What is the most effective way to waste or kill time in a
giant arboretum whose full geographical extension does
not exceed 600 meters squared? I say "comrades," because
only those select few who have justly recognized that we
do not actually have any function or purpose to carry out
at this school (such as the purported "attending class" or
"writing a thesis") and that any affirmation to the contrary
only these enlightened
is a bourgeois white man's lie
few search and demand a solution to their valid existential

dilemma.
The first problem to be addressed is the very vocabulary we use in the western world to describe our relation
with time. We kill time, nous tuons le temps, matamos el
tiempo, ammazziamo il tempo. We waste time. We rot away
time. We squander time. This is the very kind of vocabulary typical to a conflictive and uncooperative relationship. You don't want to waste and squander something that
pleases you. You don't kill what you cherish. At the same
time, you wouldn't use terms like waste and kill unless the
object in question had some value to you. You can't waste
garbage. You can't squander the mom's meatloaf served at
Sharpies.
That said, I shall now give a brief, incomprehensible
list of things one could do to pass the time, to use a neutral
term. It should be noted that none of them involve, or are
compatible with, any use whatsoever of controlled substances.

L Practice the moribund epistolary art by writing a
love letter to a random attractive friend whom you met, or
never met, in a distant land. Start it thus:
Amor mio,
My dove, though I

never told you in so many words, I
am madly, blindly, irrevocably in love with you. If you
remember who I am, or if you ever at any point even knew
who I was, write back. Till then, I have the honor of being
Your most humble and obedient servant, etc.
2. Write a solemn allegorical speech devoid of any real
significance for an event or occasion that you do not plan
to attend.
Fellow Citizens,
I stand before you on a solemn and weighty occasion.
The Sands of Time are slowly fading in the Winds of
Despair; the Elevator of Existence is leaving the top floor
of the Building of Hope; and the Coffee Pot of Possibility is

brewing at a fervent boil. Be not afraid. Face the challenge
before you. And always wear sunscreen. Thank You.
3. Be nocturnal. Nothing productive ever gets accomplished in the dark.
4. Initiate a moral campaign against all forms of mainstream behavior. You might wish to write a pamphlet promoting your doctrine:
Marginal individuals of the world, there is a specter
haunting this campus. The specter of being odd. Do not be
a conformist. Do not allow yourself to be homogenized. Do
not respect any norm dictated by the Man. Do not say
"fine" or "good" or "well" when someone asks you how
you're doing. Do not go to sleep before 4 a.m. And never

wear sunscreen. Weirdoes, unite! Throw off your chains!
Until the victory always!

5. Be a heathen and an alcoholic.
6. Be a Prude and Teetotaler.
7. Write an indignant, overly-intellectual letter to a
major newspaper explaining how offended you are by a
certain tongue-in-cheek reference to Miss Afghanistan, in
which the author muses over whether "she [Miss
Afghanistan] will be penalized in the Swimsuit
Competition for wearing a veil."
Dear Editor,
Religion is no joking matter. And your bourgeois,
American, colonist, imperialist, ethnocentric, self-aggrandizing, bigoted, ignorant humor is an insult to the dignity
of all the free and enlightened peoples of the world. So go
shove it.
Yours, with all due admiration, etc.
8. Drink wine and take walks.
9. Be a highbrow aristocratic snob.
10. Be a vulgar blue-collar bum.
1L Remind yourself that "c'est le plus grand des exces
que de n'en faire aucun," that is, it's the greatest of excess
to commit no excess.
12. Write an absurd pompous column containing
French maxims for a small college newspaper for which
your readership is not likely to extend beyond the three
friends to whom you already read the article before it was

And thus the list goes on. I hope to have transmitted the
general idea behind "passing time," and the reader might

they do their scholastic
ones, which may explain
why so many of us are
willing to deal with the
frustration and delayed
gratification
of long
distance
relationships
(though the, uh, "uniqueness" of our student body
may also have something
to do with it).
It would seem that they
are also fitting relationships for our notoriously
sexually repressed cam-

pus, since it is very difficult to hook up with your significant other when they are in a different time zone for the
much of the year. Sappy and lovelorn phone conversations
have their place, but they are so repetitive and can prove
more draining than comforting. You both miss each other,
so move on. Why not switch gears and utilize the tools of
technology in order to reconnect in more physically, and
potentially emotionally, pleasurable ways with your
honey? Enter phone and cyber sex.
Last year, my roommate, who had previously never
had a problem with my boyfriend sleeping over when he
came to visit, and even cheerfully sexiled herself on occa-

sion, suddenly freaked when I told her I had fooled around
aurally with him.

"You had

her lamp hearing me talk dirty, which is probably more
laughable than hot, anyway, was just too much for her. Of
course, being the tolerant person I am, I laughed in her
face and pointed out her inconsistency, but on further
thought, I think her reaction is very natural given the
negative associations many people have with this kind of
sex. People think of sleazy-looking ads for "fantasy chats"
on the last page of CityPaper or instant messages such as,
"age/sex, wanna cyber?"
Although I wasn't at all disgusted at the idea of this
particular brand of sex before I tried it, I was extremely
self-conscious. I simply had not had a lot of
to
erotica or porn before, and so doubted my ability to do the
job well. And, indeed, there were moments in my first
attempt where things kept coming out of my mouth as
um
questions rather than desciptions, as in, "I'm
kissing you?"

is completely normal, but don't let them stop you from

kind of sex play, but so many of us do just that merely
because we assume there's no other choice. Well, I am
here to tell you that there is, and these forms of sex can be
as "loving" or as kinky as you want them to be. In other
words, you won't have to feel like a phone sex operator
unless it turns you on.

Phone sex and cyber sex can both be great fun and very
fulfilling, but you may find that you want more visuals.
Happily, that is now an affordable and relatively easy
option for those of us with fast Internet connections (hey,
might as well use it while we've got it). For about 50 bucks
you and your honey can get two cameras that hook up to
your respective computers, and after that all of your real-

time cyber fondling is free. It seems that this is the closest
thing to tangible partner sex around. Plus, in a non-sexual way, it enables you both to see each others' faces when
you are waxing lyrical about your relationship, if you're
into that sort of thing. All right, I'll admit it. I am, too.
If you are interested in trying any of the above types of
sex but really feel that you don't have a clue how to begin
to go about it, go to Borders and read some erotica. (If old
ladies shake their heads sadly when they see you, don't
worry. They almost always take a peek at the titles as they
primly walk by.) Although there is a popular belief that
sex performance is instinctive, it is always a learned
behavior. The only difference is that inexperience in this
kind of sex is clearly visible by both parties rather than
just one. Unfortunately, because some of us were having
nail polish parties while others were having porn sleepovers, we were not properly educated and need to do some
serious catching up. So swallow your self-consciousness
and give it a try. What do you have to lose other than your
sexual frustration? Plus, this is one form of sex where
braininess is a definite turn on. Trust me, you'll gain even
more appreciation for your computer nerd or Englishmajor honey.

Capitol Steps: tell me something I don't know
BY JOHN TUHILL
jtuthill@swarthmore.edu
I won $2O from Reuben when the Capitol
Steps opened with a song that paraded through

the Californian gubernatorial candidates, concluding with a muscular and equally horny and
incoherent Schwarzenegger character rhyming
about his recent victory. Next was Laura, who
introduced George and his rip-roaring tune,
"Papa's Got a Brand New Baghdad," for which
Reuben won back his 20 bills.
From there, money exchanged hands easily
between Reuben and me, as the Steps predictably progressed through Saddam, a sketch
about shoddy airport security, and the search
for a Democratic presidential candidate, which
turned up none other than Hugh Jimbecile.
John Ashcroft, as the Phantom of the Opera,
sang about his goal to eliminate left wings from
hockey teams nationwide.
They touched on Bill, Hillary, Lieberman,
Kerry, Clark and Dean, each with their own
parodied oldie hit. And Bob Dylan, who used to
get wacked on weed (and apparently used to
wear a tie-dyed T-shirt), is now allegedly using

a weedwacker. Reuben's billfold was shrinking
while mine was growing.

The French are wusses, Martha Stewart is
mean, George Bush is obtuse, feminists are
exceedingly angry, and nobody knows who the
Speaker of the House is. For two hours,
Washington's favorite comedy troupe zoomed
through a list of America's familiar headlines
with their witty songs and humorous dialogues. The staleness of their material made it
unbearably easy for Reuben and me to predict
the focus of each act, and the outcome of the
betting (my fat wallet) was due only to
Reuben's chronic bad luck.

The Capitol Steps joined forces in 1981 for a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Christmas
party. Conceived and written by Bill Strauss
and Elaina Newport, the group has prospered,
it claims, due to the excess of constantly updating material. The act is the most successful theatrical production ever to come out of the
nation's capital.
The comedy in the show turned out to be

10

fundamentally mainstream, a sort of exceptionspruced up regurgitation of what
Americans read in their newspapers everyday.
One must commend the troupe's ability to fit a
recognizable song to a recognizable issue, as it
did several dozen times over in Friday's show.
Equally admirable was Strauss' ability to perform his vaudevillianroutine in which the first
letters of important words or phrases were
switched to create confusing and highly suggestive syntax.
Yet other than these slapstick crutches, the
Capitol Steps' humor relied heavily on hackneyed observation and moderate popular teasing. The act truly revealed its reliance on
cliched humor when the dialogue disintegrated
into the beating of Swarthmore's dead horse of
humor. Strauss told us in his hilarious jumble
speech every shaggy dog story that has ever
been repeated by bushy-tailed freshmen the
day after orientation. Guilt without sex, guilt
ally

without sex, Swillies are

WIIIIIH

Its the

work for non-profits and we are all notoriously

Beyond the comic value of the troupe's
musical and dramatic talent, the humor never
really developed or attempted to go for any
comic jugular. Instead, it remained content to
scratch the surface of a treasure chest of material, side-stepping any truly offensive issues or
persons.
So the show wasn't anything like satire.
Satire is being really mean and hateful in order
to show how stupid something is. People hate

satirists or don't understand them or love them
for their insight. There certainly aren't many
people doing that sort of act today, and, if they
are, you'll never see them on Larry King.
Satire should offend somebody, because

that's what happens when you make fun of people. And I don't want to laugh along with Tom
Ridge and his color-coded danger yardsticks. I
would rather point at him and guffaw to his

face so he knows how ridiculous his system
really is.
Capitol Steps put on an entertaining show,
and the performers were superb. But it would
have been better if some people had gone home

astounded or crying.

No column about Halloween is complete without at least a

can actually be found in a 1951 Canadian statute called the

Canada had been known as the "land of sin." Lyndon Johnson

tried to adopt the policy, but American linguists failed to correctly translate the Canadian word for "food," which was

replaced with "candy." Thus the holiday was born and half of
our kids are now above the obesity line.
The tradition of wearing costumes developed mysteriously, but some say its roots can be traced to either the generally
frightening appearance of Canadian orphans, or some very
advanced tricks involving costume and dance. Either way,
you need to wear one, so we thought we would provide you
with some suggestions. You are welcome to try any of these,
but if they cause a campus-wide uproar, it's your fault, not

ours.

What Was Your Best
Halloween Costume?
Tom Whitman, assistant, professor of music:

I was rather staid (translation: boring) whervl was a student. The only Halloween event I can remember was a
party in Willets which took place immediately after a
classical music concert I had taken part in at Lang
Concert Hall. Since I was already dressed up in a suit
and tie, I picked up a copy of The New York
Times, held it in front of my face, and told
everyone that I was an "indicted co-conspirator." (This was the late 1970'5, after all; it
seemed funny at the time.)
Kelly Wilcox, coach and instructor in Physical

Education:
One year, eight of us dressed up as Miss Universe contestants, compliments of my closet and my hideous
brightly colored prom dresses of the 'Bos. We opened up
an atlas and tried to pick the most random countries. By
the time we graduated from Swat, we realized they
weren't all that random after all.
Larry Schall, Vice President of administration:
As a boy, I went about 10 straight years as a hobo. I
actually got myself in the most serious trouble with my
dad as a result of this costume. I went into his closet,
climbed on top of a chair, and took an old hat of his and
cut holes in it. When he came home from work, I proudly
showed him how creative I had been. The trouble was
that this hat was his most expensive and favorite dress
hat that he had bought somewhere in Europe
and kept for special occasions only.

Stephen Maurer, professor of math:
About 15 years ago, I went to a Halloween
party in Philly at the apartment of some of
my wife's business colleagues; I dressed up
as a professor! That is, I wore the orange-striped black
gown and hood I otherwise only wear at graduation.
When my kids were younger, I chaperoned them as they
went around. Once I dressed up as a washing machine.

My best Halloween story goes back to my senior year in

college. My husband and I had just started being a couple. Our residence hall had a party, and we went as
Peter Pan and Tinkerbell. We made our costumes. Peter
Pan wore brown tights and a green felt outfit. I

'You're never too old for free candy'
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
Is trick or treating, the essential Halloween activity, a
social faux pas here at Swat? According to an informal
poll of 16 members of the classes of 'O4, 'O5, and 'O6, only
two of the students had been trick-or-treating so far during their college years.
Most of the students polled simply didn't consider
trick or treating a viable option any longer.
"We're a little too old to go trick-or-treating in the
Ville," Billy Schwarz 'O5 said. "In high school, people
thought it was sketchy enough that I was going trick-ortreating, let alone in college."
But there exists a small but passionate troupe of trickor-treaters who venture out into the night in search of
candy.

"I went trick-or treating last year," Nick Ward 'O5
admitted. "I lived in Mary Lyon last year,
and the neighborhood was really close by. I
went as a basket of dirty laundry. [The people who were giving out candy] seemed to
be entertained by that. [The reaction] was
either 'Nice costume' or 'Aren't you too old
to be doing this?' But I got candy!"
Elaborating, Ward said, "We just kind of wandered
around the neighborhood. It was kind of late, and people
were giving away lots of candy because all the kids had
already come. It must have been 9 or 9:30 p.m. and it was
mostly college students and Ville rats."
Ward said his experiences had led him to discover
prime trick-or-treating locations. "A lot of people go up
on Whittier Place, where several profs live, past the

math department, Papazian and ML. We
went straight out across from ML, across
320 and over near Yale and Countryside
Market."
"There's this one house on College Ave.
across from the tennis courts," An Bui 'O5
said. "A retired professor lives there, and he hands out
healthy snacks like apples and peanut butter crackers."
Trick-or-treating in the Ville also allows students and
Swarthmore residents, especially faculty, to interact.
"One year I ended up at Myrt Westphal's house," said
Ward. "It was like, Trick-or-treat! Oh wait, you're
Myrt.'"

Ward also said that ML often allowed neighborhood
children inside early in the evening to go trick-or-treating from dorm room to dorm room. "I suppose there're
enough people giving out candy for it to be worth going
to. Last year they put up signs as to who was doing it."
Gaertner 'O5, who has trick-or-treated as a
the past two years, said she saw Swarthmore
as welcoming to trick or treaters. "I think if
up, the houses are really friendly. It's always a
good sign when the houses are really decorated, because
they're usually more enthusiastic. They're happy to see
Swat students and they give out good candy." She said
she recommends starting out around dusk. "Maybe five,
six, seven o'clock. That's when the little kids are out.

When she returns to her dorm, Gaertner said she is

important part of my lifestyle. You'll have candy for weeks
and you can give it to people in your classes, and they'll

Among first-years, of course, there is much enthusiasm
about extending beloved Halloween rituals an extra year.

tions between its familiar and unfamiliar elements stand

The summer of 2001 was a shining time for me. I did
a lot of climbing mountains and exploring new cities and
otherwise playing in the sun. I got to spend a lot of time
in northern California. I was blissfully in love for the second time in my life, with the added poignancy and immediacy of impending separation. It was also the summer
the Shins entered my life.
I picked up a copy of their debut, "Oh, Inverted
World," in a used record store on Telegraph Avenue; I
was instantly won over by its lovingly crafted vignettes
of snail-collecting and untied shoelaces; its affecting
accounts of relationships fraught with uncertainty; its
wistful but optimistic vision of a life "cradled softly in the
hands of some strange and gentle child." There was something wonderfully unassuming and refreshing about the
album, not only the lyrics but the music as well. It was
sunny and plaintive and fresh. Folks made a lot of comparisons, especially to music from the '6os the Byrds,
the Kinks, the Beach Boys and I could understand what
-

they meant, but to me none of that felt quite right, or

rather it was missing the point. It was hard to pin down,
but it seemed to me that the Shins had used familiar elements (soft, jangly guitars; understated touches of synthesizer) to create a wholly original sound. A lot of it had
to do with songwriter James Mercer's uncanny way with
melody and song form: He imbued each section of a song
with an arresting melody all its own, but linked them so
that verse and chorus (or, just as often, more inventive,
unorthodox structures) flowed together in unexpected
and deeply gratifying ways. And the Shins did it effortlessly, never sounding complex or unnatural. Simply
stated, "Oh, Inverted World" speaks to me on a more
direct and personal level than almost anything else I've
heard before or since. What's more, most other people
who have encountered it seem to be similarly charmed.
So I was far from the only one who'd spent the last two
years anxiously awaiting more Shins music, a long wait
that has finally ended with the arrival of "Chutes Too
Narrow." This is the new album: ten songs, just over half
an hour of music and a lot to live up to. Getting to know
a new album by a familiar artist, especially one I've loved
so dearly, is an delicate experience. It usually takes a few
listens before I can even begin to consider it on its own
terms. At first I can't think beyond how it compares, on
the most basic, sonic level, to the earlier albums, and

never retro-stylistic affectation). Generally, the greater

The fact that such comparisons are possible isn't by
any means a criticism in itself. I certainly don't subscribe to the cult of originality, and anyway there's nothing unoriginal about having evident stylistic influences.
Besides, surely, "Chutes Too Narrow" sounds more like

the Shins than anything else. Mercer's charmingly literate lyrics, poetic but rarely pretentious, have lost none of
their humor and perceptiveness. As I've suggested, his

Contemporary rhythm and blues music, beginning in
the Motown era, has evolved through the decades into
the slick genre of R&B. Some would say that rhythm and
blues is no different from R&B. However, Al Green,
Stevie Wonder and The Temptations are vastly separate
entities from Ginuwine, Tyrese and B2K. Whatever your
opinion of the genre, there is an artist that bridges the
gap between the two styles. He is a man that can be as

days with Public Announcement. The obligatory club
songs that many Swatties shake their groove thang to at
parties on campus are included, most notably "Thoia
Thoing." Sweet, slow songs like "I'm Your Angel," his
duet with Celine Dion, nicely balance out the overall
vibe of the album.
For people that can't bear to listen to a compilation of
old songs, have no fear. Kelly brings the new "Touched a
Dream," which showcases his soulful vocal ability and
smooth musical arrangement, reminiscent of Marvin
Gaye's earlier work. There is also the lyrically honest
"Ghetto Religion," featuring Wyclef Jean. In this track
he displays a recurrent theme in his music: acceptance
of situations and various circumstances of life, dealing
with suffering and inevitably with repentance for sins,
as in the song "I Wish."
Another socially conscious track is "When a Woman's
Fed Up," which deals with relationships. "The World's
Greatest" could be described as an uplifting ballad centered on self assurance and worth. A limited edition CD
of remixes is included in addition to the album for good

measure and good fun.

Through this album, the listener can realize R. Kelly's
evolution as a singer, songwriter, and producer. From
the popular guilty pleasure "Bump 'n' Grind" to the critically acclaimed "I Believe I Can Fly," the 'R' in R&B
washes away all preconceived ideas about his personal

life and forces the listener to hear the music. And it's
amazing music, indeed.

Irrational fear
Healthy fear of expensive litigation never hurt anyone, but the college's actions in the past week reflect an

almost absurd level of paranoia.
We stand by our assertion in last week's editorial
("The good fight", Oct. 23, pg. 14) that it was reasonable
for the college to protect itself from Diebold by complying with its cease-and-desist order. That means shutting
down a network user's computer for containing documents on his or her hard drive that might constitute
copyright infringement.
However, this was before we became aware that the
college was asking users to remove links to the Why
War? Web site from their sites and asserting that "providing access" in this way is equivalent to hosting the
file. This goes beyond what we consider reasonable; by
the same logic, many Phoenix articles are now also illegal, and our newspaper violates the law by maintaining
them in our archive. They include the following:
A news article from Sept. 11, 2002, detailing the evolution of the anti-war group (http://www.sccs.

swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-0912/news/1216Lphp); a opinions article in support of the

2001(http://www.sccs. swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2001/

sees.

2001-11-01/news/11483.htm1).

Using the college's logic, it, too, is now once again in
violation of the law, because the college hosts SCCS,
which hosts the Phoenix Web site, which contains the
archived articles, which contain the link. In fact, extending the college's logic a bit, this editorial itself now also
moves Swarthmore onto illegal ground: It links to an
article that links to a Web site that contains the memos.
So does this week's cover story on page three. Anyone
who's surfed the Web knows how a daisy chain of links
can form and how silly and impossible it is to restrict
access to information by, effectively, restricting what
people can tell each other to read. What the college
appears to have defined "good-faith" compliance with
current copyright law goes far beyond even the currently extended definitions of intellectual property to the
point of suppressing student speech, plain and simple.
We feel confident that the 30 other colleges and universities now hosting users with the memos on their
hard drives will, coUectively, start to build substantial
pressure on Diebold soon, and someone will take the necessary step of formally investigating the validity of the
memos, preparing for legal action. For now, we should

continue to avoid the sort of witch hunting that the college has, in the past, avoided on less substantial matters,
as with disputes with the RIAA and MPAA over illegal
music and movies. We implore the college, in a spirit of
fair and respectful treatment ofits students, to apply the
same letter-of-the-law hands-off policy here.

Joy of Ramadan month arrives
time of intense personal reflection and devotion.
Ramadan provides an opportunity to increase one's
patience and self-discipline as well as compassion
for those in need of the necessities of life and to further a sense of self-purification and a renewed focus

BY SAED ATSHAN

satshanl@swarthmore.edu

Monday marked the beginning of Ramadan, the
ninth month of the lunar Islamic calendar. Islam,
with 1.2 billion followers, has become the secondlargest religion in the world. It is also the world's
fastest-growing faith with nearly one-fifth of
humankind as its followers from all across the
globe, including over 7 million in the United States.
People in the West tend to equate Muslims with
Arabs. In reality, Arabs make up only a small portion of the Islamic world (Indonesia and India have
the largest numbers of Muslims worldwide) and
many Arabs are Christians.
Ramadan is a very important time for Muslims.
It begins when a community sights the new moon
(that is why some communities began Ramadan on
Sunday). For the duration of the month, fasting, the
fourth pillar of Islam, takes place. Muslims who
have reached puberty and are in good physical and
mental health abstain from all foods, drinks, smoking, sexual activities and immoral acts from the
break of dawn to sunset. The elderly, children, pregnant women and travelers are all exempt from the

on spirituality.

Ramadan is also a social and festive month in
which nighttime is given new life and strings of colored lights and lanterns brighten streets throughout world capitals. Families, friends and neighbors
get together to break fast, people reach out to the
poor and visit the sick, mosques organize prayer
sessions and services, and many people try to read
the 30 chapters of the Quran (one each night). The
month culminates with sighting of the full moon
which marks the holiday of Eid ul-fitr. For three
days, communities celebrate the successful completion of Ramadan and huge festivities are organized.
It is also a sad time to say goodbye to the blessed
month.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
told his companions, "God has said: 'Fasting is like
a shield. A person who fasts experiences two joys.
He is joyful when he breaks his fast, and he is joyful
when he meets his Lord' (Hadith Qudsi 10).

Lecture marred by disrespect
Dear Editor:

I wish to discuss the lecture on Monday evening
given by Morton Klein, President of the Zionist
Organization of America (see news article, pg. 5). I
do not, however, want to revisit his words, policies
or theories, nor do I wish to recount the opposing
views stated by the students and faculty present at
the lecture.
Unfortunately, the talk and following discussion
were clouded by the severe lack of respect from the
audience and from the speaker himself. As
Swarthmore students, we pride ourselves on our
academic standards and intellectual ability. In nearly every discipline, we discover that there is not a
black-and-white solution to any issue, social, political or even scientific. Our professors encourage discussion within class and papers because of this idea.
I was duly astounded and appalled when members
of the audience physically expressed their disagreement to Klein's speech while he was speaking. There
were side conversations, smiles of disbeliefand even
THE PHOENIX

audible laughter. These actions were committed by
students who opposed Klein's ideas; these actions
were committed with a complete lack of respect.
This disrespect was directed not only at Klein's
ideas, but more importantly at Klein personally and
at the student group, our very peers who brought
him to encourage discourse on campus. The disrespect continued into the question-and-answer period
where, unfortunately, Klein himself became clearly
affected by the audience's reaction.
This does not excuse Klein's exhibited lack of
respect, for disrespect has no place at such an event.
But how can we encourage discussion and learning
when we cannot even respect the other person? Can
we learn without listening respectfully? We must
keep in mind that we are not always flawlessly correct, that life is not a black-and-white issue and that,
even though opinions may oppose our own, we must
respect those people and their opinions in order to
have a fruitful discourse.

health for us and Earth
On Sunday, these two headlines
were juxtaposed in The New York
Times: "Evangelicals Sway White
House on Human Rights Issues
Abroad" and "No, You Go First:
Cutting Greenhouse Gases, or
Not."

Here we have Bush's greatest
concern and greatest neglect, evangelical Christians and America's
outstanding contribution to global
warming.
Apparently, we live in a very
devout society. Swarthmore could
have fooled me, but anecdotes from

voter base convince me that
America is religious.
The good news for those who
want clean air, land and water for their children is that we can
harness our nation's religious zeal and our own holistic worldviews to secure such human rights. Evangelical Christians and
their mainstream counterparts have been environmental advo-

cates on Capitol Hill for about a decade. The Interfaith Council for
Environmental Stewardship, the National Religious Partnership

for the Environment and the Interfaith Panel on Global Climate
Change are three major interfaith organizations.

Healing happens from within, so massage
and breathing are the surest way to a

The National Religious Partnership actually formed as a
response to the Open Letter to the Religious Community published by 32 Nobel laureates and other eminent scientists in
January 1990. It said, "The environmental crisis requires radical

the most diplomatic move we can make as environmentalists contending with the Bush administration and its appointments is to
sign our political letters with the name of our house of worship at
the bottom, or, even better, to get religious organizations to
endorse environmentally sound positions as institutions.

picture of why goes something like this.
First comes acknowledgement of the mind-soul-body continuity, then the realization of the body as merely the sensory barrier
between the inner environment and the outer environment and
finally the whole picture, our selves as one part of a grand, interconnected world. Some variation on this perspective seems pretty
fundamental to holistic wellness. But that's just the conversation
that has begun on campus: holistic wellness and students' lack
thereof.
A group of students has been in conversation with Linda

Echols, director of Worth Health Center, and Mari Clements,
Swarthmore's nutritionist, about facilitating student well-being.
Specifically, we're talking about training a small group of students in wisdom from different cultures about nutrition, massage,
breathing and stretching, so these students could organize programs or study breaks where people could chill out therapeutically and learn some techniques. Healing happens from the inside
out, so, as far as I'm concerned, massage and breathing are the
surest way to a strong environmental movement.
So, if it seems like I'm saying two things, you might still see it
that way, but they're part of the same continuum. First, hype up
your religiosity in your politics so Bush will sign an international document for emissions reductions and think he can count on
your vote. Second is a call to take care of our whole selves, so that
as we strive for well-being, we'll extend that concern to community health and environmental health.

I do not consider myself an
idealist when I say that I am
shocked and disappointed by

the administration's decisions
during the past week with
regard to the Diebold memos. I
understand Bob Gross's point
about Swarthmore's purpose

MARISSA VAHLSING

Progresso Sauce

being that of an educational
institution whose first priority
is to maintain its ability to provide an education to its students. Clearly, this view would
engender concern that a hefty

lawsuit from an oversized cor-

poration could not only jeop-

ardize our endowment but also
limit the school's ability to provide the standard of education

that we currently benefit from. Nobody can deny that a lawsuit
against Swarthmore would be rather disastrous, but, on the

other hand, Swarthmore and all similar institutions should
realize that, in the long run, the price they are paying for their
protection right now will be one that none of us as American
citizens can afford to pay.
As we all know well, the Diebold internal memos outline
15,000 pages revealing not only that the company, which runs evoting in 37 of the 50 states, is aware of inherent flaws within its
voting system, but also that in the 2000 election such flaws led
to over 16,000 votes being subtracted from Al Gore in a Florida
precinct, more than the amount which Bush won by. When
these memos found their way onto the personal computer of a
few Swarthmore students, and subsequently onto the Web page
of Why War?, Diebold reacted by sending a cease-and-desist
order to the Swarthmore ISP. In the wake of chaos that ensued,
Bob Gross not only found himself "slashdotted" and harassed by
e-mails from the country's finest tech gurus, but last
Wednesday he sat before a crowd of over 50 students in Parrish
Parlours and told them that Swarthmore could not support Why
War? and the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons'
attempt to host these memos.
As one of those students sitting in the Parlours that afternoon, I watched as Bob Gross deflected student exclamations
from all angles. When he was told that this would not bode well
for Swarthmore's reputation in the activist community, he
responded that our statistics there were already high enough
and that we needed to boost our party stats instead. Chuckle.
And when Evan Greer 'O7 read out loud from Swarthmore's mission statement "to help its students realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential combined with a deep sense of ethical and social concern," Bob Gross diverted the conversation by
saying that the college serves as an institution of education, not
a political entity. In reality, there is actually no legal liability if
the college were to refuse to chastise its students' actions. The
"fair use" principle of copyright allows the circulation of documents that are critical to the public good, which no one can
deny that this is. Even still, the administration's points sound
legit. No one can be sure that we won't be sued, but the odds are
slim, and the costs of not supporting our students are high.
Because of this, I would like to ask the administration what
the point is in all we are learning if we cannot believe in any of
it. I have spent more time learning about democracy (and, at
times, its discontents) at this school than anywhere else. What
does all of this learning amount to, what meaning does it retain,
if, when the very core of such principles is threatened, we
cower behind our books and stone walls? Why even bother
learning about the Electoral College and primaries and campaign finance reform if Diebold has already promised in its
memos to do what it can to deliver its home state (Ohio) to Bush
in 2004? If the college cannot stand for truth, what can it stand
for?

And for those of you who think this is just sensational journalism, go directly to the Why War? Web site and read those
memos. Read through them and realize the implications of their
words. Then you will understand why Diebold is so concerned
about exposure, and I can tell you right now it is not solely
based on a theoretical appreciation for the protection of intellectual property. You will probably be in disbelief that the college does not feel a moral obligation to help them remain public
knowledge. I mean, democracy is just something to learn about,
not to actualize, after all.

Diebold proves futility of voting
Dear Editor:

Throughout the years of the progressive (don't you dare use the
word "liberal") political movement,
there has been somewhat of an

obsession with the right to vote, and
the right to a "free and fair" election. To me, the concept of a fair
election is rather bizarre. What is
fair about me marking someone's
name down on a piece of paper, and
them then having the right to tell
me what to do?
My interest in exposing the
Diebold memos has nothing to do
with
in
"saving
democracy
America" or any other such blindly
patriotic endeavor. Rather, I hope
that the Diebold memos will help

people to see just how much control
corporations and the elite have over

our supposedly "democratic" government, and that voting only
serves to legitimize a failed system.
I was worried when I read our
first press release. It seemed to
imply that the only reason we
oppose Diebold is because they
might help the Republicans win.
Oh, the horror. I hate it when a rich
white male calling himself a "republican" defeats a rich white male who
calls himself a "democrat." It's just
much nicer to say "democrat"; it
brings on a sense of security indoctrinated into me by my parents

October 30, 2003

from the time I was old enough to
ask who that guy on TV was.
In reality, history shows us that
there is no difference between
Democrats and Republicans, and
that attacking the President as a
person or a party is useless, while
the economic system that creates
poverty and war remains intact.
I feel it is dangerous to propagate
the myth throughout the movement
that voting
or working on eleccan change anytion campaigns
thing other than the face we have to
look at when we watch CNN. Voting
is a very useful tool for the elite to
keep the people from truly rising up
and engaging in activities that
might bring about real change. I
know many good activists who
spend a majority of their time work-

ing on election campaigns that

either lose or have little effect. As
Emma Goldman once said, "It may
be claimed that men of integrity
would not become corrupt in the
political grinding mill. Perhaps
not; but such men would be

absolutely helpless to exert the
slightest influence in behalf of
labor, as indeed has been shown in
numerous instances. The state is
the economic master of its servants.
Good men, if such there be, would
either remain true to their political
faith and lose their economic sup-

port, or they would cling to their

economic master and be utterly
unable to do the slightest good."

The Diebold memos are a direct

challenge to the myth of democracy
in America. My hope is that they
will provoke people to question the
assumptions that they have always
held that voting for the most "liberal" candidate is the best they can do
for the oppressed of the world, and
that otherwise they should just
work and consume. An employee in
the memos is quoted as saying, "If
voting ever changed anything, it
would be illegal." I've got that pin
on my bag. Think about it. If we
accept that the ruling class
by

definition

controls the state, and

therefore have at their fingertips
the state's massive powers of violence and coercion, we can assume
that they have the ability to formu-

late whatever rule of law they see

fit. If this is so, why would they
legalize anything that might have
the slightest possibility of changing
their position as members of the
ruling class?
I'm tired of "Regime Change
Begins At Home" bumper stickers.
Regime change implies that after
the supposed "change" there is still
a regime in place. Why not get rid of
the regime altogether?

Diebold claims copyright over the memos. This of
course confirms that the memos are indeed theirs. It
is a clear violation of free speech to suppress this
important information. In any case, as this issue is
of such fundamental importance to democracy, it is
no time for timidity.
I attended Swarthmore in part because of its students' history of courageous activism and the institution's courageous stands on moral and political
issues, including the college's promise to replace
federal financial aid to students denied aid because
they refused to register for
the draft. I was proud of the
college for this and many
imporother stands. It is for that
timidity. reason that I have made
donations to the alumni

fund nearly every year
since I graduated. Now that students are behaving
with similar courage in defense of democratic institutions and in exercise of their free speech, I urge
the college to rise to this occasion and allow the students to maintain the Diebold information on their
Web site(s).

Swat does College's role not neutral
what it can
Dear Editor:
I for one do not believe that
the college's position on the
Diebold
memos matter is
unprincipled as stated on the
Why War? Web site; rather, the
college is acting on a different
principle from that endorsed by
Why War?
The college does not budget
to engage in litigation as a matter of course for each issue,
even as worthy as this one, that
becomes hot for students.
At the same time, it does
work to ensure that the student
voice is heard. Diebold, meantime, is likely to be over-

whelmed by the public domain.
Google hits reveal that the

Dear Editor:
I would like to add my name to
what I am sure is an ever-lengthening list of alumni urging the
Swarthmore administration to
support the students involved in
the Diebold controversy. I can
think of almost no challenge to
our democracy more terrifying
than the prospect of electronic voting machines that can be easily
manipulated by interested parties.
I would have hoped that
Swarthmore College would take
an active role in making sure that
this does not come to pass. If not,

then they should at least get out of
the way and let the students do
their part. Contrary to what Dean
Gross says, the decision to block
access to the student's Web site
does constitute an "official position on the issue," specifically that
Diebold's interpretation of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
is correct. This is not at all clear
and it seems to me that opposing a
law that so severely restricts
debate on important public issues
does indeed "directly relate" to the
college's mission.

Diebold Election Systems may
be poorly managed. Its programming practices may be sketchy and
its security assurances may be
lacking. Given the prevalence of
Diebold products in elections
across the country, these allegations merit further investigation
and inquiry.
To this supposed end, Why War?
and its sympathizers have taken a
reckless and illogical approach. By

risks and costs.
Why War's tactics in addressing
wm^
this issue have not demonstrated a
desire for reform but rather seem concocted from some naive
notion of protest against corporate America. These tactics may be
appropriate as a last resort, but they are being employed at a point
when a number of legal, effective alternatives remain unexploited.

the Bubble

Regardless of its implications for a changing notion of democ-

racy, the Diebold issue is not the direct business of Swarthmore as
an educational entity. Why War? would like the college to comply
with a barrage of cease-and-desist orders while agreeing to a tacit
agreement to allow students to transfer the location of the Diebold
documents every three days. Though Why War? may argue that
this practice would shield the college from legal repercussions,
this is no guarantee of safety. If Why War's actions are brought to
court, it is unlikely that Swarthmore can remain an uninvolved
party.
And aside from this legal risk, Why War? neglects that fact that
the Diebold issue presents a real cost for the college. ITS, which is
already overworked this semester, must waste valuable time com-

plying with cease-and-desist orders. And though the college has
legal counsel, any time spent on Diebold is time not spent on matters directly pertinent to the college.
Even if the costs were negligible, it would be inappropriate for
Swarthmore to take a stance on this issue. Though Why War?
argues that the college is neglecting a "pro-democracy" view, it
fails to understand that, regardless of its politically charged climate, Swarthmore is an educational, not political, institution.
Were the college to adopt every issue that a politically aroused
student group deemed morally worthy, it would find its ability to
fulfill its academic mission quickly compromised.
In response to Swarthmore's refusal to knowingly allow this
illegal activity on the college network, Why War? has accused the
college of the "suppression of the Diebold memos." If Why War?
were truly dedicated to changing the operations of Diebold and
influencing American voting processes, it would not find it necessary to attack Swarthmore, essentially an innocent bystander in
this fiasco. An issue as important as Why War? claims this one to
be could surely subsist without attachment to Swarthmore's elite
reputation.
Why War? is blinded by a romantic notion of protest whose
methods are simply inappropriate in achieving their stated ends.
It claims that violating the law is acceptable in the name of civil
disobedience. Because it disagrees with the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, Why War? chooses to ignore Diebold's legal
demands. What it fails to realize, however, is that civil disobedience is historically an act of desperation. A situation whose origins are merely a few months old hardly calls for desperate measures.

If Why War? and its associates wanted real change for Diebold,
they would follow the route most likely to be effective. They would
remove Swarthmore from the situation and seek to correct this

on its own demerits. Why War? should take its
own "pro-democracy" stance and use the tools of democracy to
pursue change rather than skirt the laws of civil society.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has the right idea in filing
legal claims against Diebold. These claims will allow our courts to
decide Diebold's merits rather than a few rogue college students.
If Why War? were serious about challenging electronic voting
standards, it would take a similar approach. In its self-righteous
attempt to bypass the law and create bedlam for Diebold, Why
War? has marginalized its chances of effecting any real change.

Tide wipes out Bryn Mawr in a wet one
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
The women's soccer team (8-8, 4-5) lost last Saturday at
Dickinson College 3-1, mathematically eliminating the
Garnet Tide from the Centennial Conference playoff chase.
Going into the match, Swarthmore needed to win its final
three conference games and receive a lot of help from the
rest of the conference in order to qualify for the conference
tournament for the first time under Coach Amy Brunner.

Despite the disappointing loss, Swarthmore rebounded to
thrash conference rival Bryn Mawr 4-1 on Tuesday night.
Senior Katey McCaffrey scored two goals in the Garnet
Tide victory, including one just 12 seconds into the contest,
setting a Centennial Conference record for the fastest goal
ever scored in a women's soccer match.
Entering their game against Dickinson College (9-5-1, 53), the Garnet Tide retained hope for a berth in the
Centennial Conference playoffs. A victory over the Red
Devils would leave Swarthmore three points behind
fourth-place Johns Hopkins for the final playoff bid.
In the opening minute, however, Dickinson immediately went on the attack in the friendly confines of Biddle
Field. The Red Devils earned a quick corner kick. On the
ensuing set piece, senior striker Alyssa Carlow struck her
team-leading 12th goal of the season to give Dickinson a 10 lead just 59 seconds into the game.
Despite the early goal, the Garnet Tide quickly
regained their composure. Tough defending and strong
midfield play allowed Swarthmore to create holes in the
Dickinson defense. In the ninth minute, Swarthmore's
hard work paid off, as McCaffrey knotted the score 1-1 off
an assist from Natalie Negrey 'O7. After receiving the ball
on the left side of the box, Negrey dropped a pass to an
onrushing McCaffrey. McCaffrey deftly eluded two defenders and fired a right-footed shot that gave Swarthmore new

life.

Following the Garnet goal, Dickinson increased its
pressure on the Swarthmore defense. Swarthmore was
initially able to absorb the Red Devil attack, but, as the
half wore on, Dickinson took increasing control of the
game. In the 31st minute, senior Kathleen Holmes capitalized on another corner kick to put Dickinson ahead for
good. In the 66th minute, first-year Jess Griggs added an
insurance goal for the Red Devils to put the game out of

reach.

"In the first half we had a iot of trouble playing balls to
feet. We had a lot of turnovers. We got it together in the
second half, but we just couldn't find the back of the net. I
honestly don't know what it was," defender Kasie Groom

'O7 explained.
"We possessed the ball well, but we continually had problems getting into the attacking third of the field. It wasn't
that there defense was that strong; we just couldn't connect
on the last pass or two. Our defense played well, we just

The Garnet defeated Bryn Mawr 3-1 at home last Tuesday. Captain Katey McCaffrey scored two goals in the victory.

allowed way too many corner kicks," McCaffrey said.
For the game Dickinson drew 14 corner kicks, 13 more
than Swarthmore's total.
Swarthmore returned to Clothier field for a Monday
contest with rival Bryn Mawr (4-11-1, 0-9), only to be greeted by torrential rains. The game was played Tuesday
night, despite the continued inclement weather. "It was
wet and cold. That pretty much sums up the game.
Everyone was sliding everywhere," Groom said.
Despite the conditions, McCaffrey was able to score the
fastest goal in Centennial Conference history. After Bryn
Mawr took the kickoff, Swarthmore immediately jumped
on the attack. "They took the kick off, and passed it back.
Stephanie immediately put high pressure on, which forced
a bad pass. I picked up the loose ball around 40 out. I dribbled a bit, and just took the shot," McCaffrey said. The
shot from 30 yards out dipped over the outstretched arms
of Bryn Mawr goalkeeper Sarah Caldwell to give the
Garnet Tide a lead they would never relinquish. In the
18th minute, Groom found a streaking Negrey in the box

off a cross from the left flank. Negrey collided with
Caldwell, forcing the ball through to the back post. Sarah
Hobbs 'O6 pounced on the loose ball for her second goal of
the season. Valerie Maulbeck 'O6 gave the Garnet Tide a 30 advantage with her first goal of the season in the 35th
minute off a Hobbs assist. Maulbeck said Hobbs had
"chipped the ball over the sweepers head. Becky [Strauss
'o6] and I were right there, I just happened to have a better
angle." Maulbeck controlled the bouncing ball and calmly
chipped the onrushing keeper.
In the 39th minute, the Owls were able to get on the
scoreboard with a goal from Arianna Voigt to trim the
Garnet Tide lead to 3-1 at the half. Bryn Mawr was unable
to get any closer in the second half, however, as the Garnet
Tide coasted to the conference victory. McCaffrey added
an insurance goal in the 72nd minute to end the scoring at
4-L "It was raining and cold, but people were having fun
and enjoying the game. Everyone was happy that we were

doing well, scoring goals. It was a nice change of speed,"

Maulbeck said.

this is a championship.
Yet when ultimate fulfillment is the clear goal, it is not assured that, in
basketball, roster-loading is the best method to obtain it. In baseball, a

success of one star does not impinge on that of many teammates: On

Basketball is different, though. Because of time limits

One player scores a field goal at the expense of a teammate hitting th
bucket; two star teammates could score 50 points each in the same game
but, more likely, one will score 50 and others' totals will drop.
Return to Hiero's comments and replace "tyrant" with "all-star calibe

players satisfied when their desires are growing and there are not enough
resources to distribute? Last season, the Mavericks attempted 85 field

Vernon Chaplin takes on a Ursinus defender in Centennial Conference action last night. The Tide must close out the season with victories if they hope to make the CC playoffs.

Tide hope to make CC playoffs
Despite key loss to McDaniel last weekend, Garnet Tide still remain in playoff hunt
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND

aryanbol@Swarthmore.edu

The men's soccer team fell last weekend to
Centennial Conference opponent McDaniel 3-0, losing to
the Green terror away from home to fall to 5-10-2 on the
season and putting a serious damper on the Garnet
Tide's playoff chances for the season. Swarthmore also
played conference foe Ursinus this Wednesday in what
was a must win for the team, but the results were
unavailable at press time.
Saturday, the Tide were overwhelmed by a fast and
tough McDaniel squad, which took a 1-0 lead into halftime and never looked back, adding two more tallies in
the last half to blank a lethargic Swarthmore team.
"Giving up three goals was disappointing because
we're a better team than that, but we weren't as prepared mentally on Saturday as we needed to be," head
coach Eric Wagner said.
"But I have to give credit to McDaniel. They were a
very good team, very physical, very fit, and they
worked hard off the ball, so they took it right to us, he
said"
The loss hurt the Garnet Tide's chances for making
the Centennial Conference playoffs this season, as they
must now rely upon other teams to have key losses as
well as being forced to win out the season themselves.
THE

PHOENIX

"The loss certainly dampens our chances, but we're still
in the hunt," Wagner said. "We just need a lot of help,

and instead of our chances being there within our
grasp, now it's really up to a lot of other teams."
Against Ursinus yesterday the team went into the
game trying to step up its intensity on both offense and

games and being held scoreless in its last two contests.
"It should be a good game, but all we really need to do
is come out with the same intensity we showed against
Johns Hopkins the weekend before," said forward and
defenseman Brandon Penix 'O7. "It's a must win game,

October 30, 2003

so we'll play like it, and I expect us to be able to win."
The game against Ursinus marked the Tide's final
home game of the season, and also the final game at
Clothier Stadium for captain Brendan Moriarty 'O4, the
squad's lone senior. "It's Brendan's last game, and that
makes it kind of special for the team," Wagner said.
"And it promises to be a physical game, because Ursinus
will be physically strong and ready to work hard. It
should be a good game."
Swarthmore will finish out its season against historic rival Haverford this Saturday over at Haverford at
1 p.m., where the Garnet Tide will try to end the season
with a victory against the Fords, who are currently 6-73 on the season, on their own turf in what is the 81st
annual meeting of the two teams.
"It should be easy for us to get up for this game,"
Wagner said. "It's a conference rivalry, last week of the
season, so our guys should be pumped to play and get
after it. I think the rivalry brings something more to the
table, but it shouldn't be too different than playing
Hopkins or any other conference game.

for this team, because we've made some real big strides
this season and we want to keep it going into the offsea-

The team will also be hosting its annual alumni

When life was Life
As a regular watcher of World Series of Poker on ESPN and
the Travel Channel, I often sit in front of the television telling
myself I would fare better than the so-called "professionals" I see
on the screen. After hearing that 2003 World Series champion
Chris Moneymaker learned Hold 'Em strategy by playing thousands of games on his computer, I thought that I, too, could find
success through such a method. After all, wasting time playing
games on the computer is what I do best. However, after just thirty minutes at pokerroom.com, my money had been "generously
donated" to other players. Not
surprising for a guy who seems
to get wiped out at blackjack
every time he visits Atlantic
City.

Realizing poker wasn't my
game, I searched for championships of other games I felt I
could master. Scrabble, Monopoly, Checkers and Risk are just
a few games I found that have

Instead of dedicating a year of
my life to reach such a championship, however, I felt my time
would be better spent reflecting
CARLTON DAVIS
on the times I enjoyed as a youth
from the board games I played.
Rounding Third
The classic of all board games,
Monopoly, taught me to love
money at an early age. Money, I
learned, is the root of all fun. What better feeling was there than
landing on "Free Parking" and collecting the mess of dark
orange and tan bills that lay in the middle of the board?
Unfortunately, this lesson did not serve me well, as I quickly discovered no money was ever given to me for free. I also struggled
in high school economics when learning about monopolies. I
thought the word was the result of, not the impetus for, the name
of the board game.
I knew at a young age I didn't want to be a doctor. After playing Operation, I realized I wouldn't be able to live with myself
after all the patients I would have killed. Operation had no factual base to it; what kind of a doctor reaches into a person's body,
with tweezers, and pulls out healthy, in tact bones? They should
have named the game "Quack." The mother of a friend of mine
banned her daughter from playing Operation because she feared
the game would turn her daughter off from being a doctor!
I played a lot of Life as child. The guys I hung around with in
elementary school had few, if any, friends. I suppose you could
say the same about me, so we always liked to play the game
where we could all be winners. After all, it only took the spin of
a wheel. Remember Jenga? I used to play dirty Jenga as a kid
with a group of guys and girls, where, after each turn, we had to
do something sexual or embarrassing. We ceased playing this
version after my mom walked in on one of my friend's pulling
out unsuccessfully.
Mouse Trap was a game that held a lot of promise but when it
boiled down to it had no point. It took an hour to set up all the little traps, and finally when you pulled the trigger to set the trap
all the crappy plastic pieces just fell down and nothing happened.
Risk was always a game in which I was dominant; Kramer and
Newman would have been no match for me. At night I used to
dream of conquering Irkutsk and Kamchatka, and it wasn't until
middle school when I started learning about Hitler and world
domination that I noticed eerie similarities between my youth
and his. I haven't played the game since.
While all my friends were "improving their vocabulary" by
reading books in high school, I simply played Scrabble anc
looked up the words that everybody else put on the board. It was
just as effective a method as reading, and much less time consuming. Nowadays, I play a ton of Boggle, and my knowledge ol
three- and four-letter words has increased exponentially. Any
time I see three connecting letters that look like a word, I'll write
them down and look them up later. I am a Boggle stud. Want to
know how I studied for the SATs? Board games like these.
Speaking of board games, did you know Milton Bradley is the
only person to have his face on money, design hundreds of board
games, and hit .300 in the major leagues over a full season?
That's just a tad more impressive than my resume of not having
my face on money, having designed zero board games and consistently hitting .200 against crappy Centennial Conference
pitching. I am, however, a master at board games, so at least I've
got that going for me. Now if I could just make it to a work
championship of some kind, I could finally cash in on my talent.
