Project Pericles

touts civic ideals
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER
ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

A group of 13 students, faculty and
administrators from Swarthmore traveled
to New York City the weekend of April 3 to
participate in the first conference of Project
Pericles, a program with the goal of advancing social responsibility in liberal arts education.
Debra Kardon-Brown, assistant director

of the Lang Center for Social Responsibility,

described the "Conference of the Pericleans"

as a "mixing of people, ideas and responses
to the challenge of increasing civic engagement on campuses, while also determining
how to evaluate programs and sustainability"

The conference, which brought together
more than 170 people representing 10 liberal
arts colleges nationwide, is the result of
Swarthmore's involvement in a pilot program called Project Pericles. Eugene Lang
'3B designed the initiative in 1999 to combat
what he perceived as a national dilemma:
the political and civic disengagement of
young people.
At the conference, the mission of improving "civic engagement" loosely described

both

community service.

Kardon-Brown said that, just as the co.

and staff to teach civic leadership.

"Is service just something

change?"
Debra Kardon-Brown,
assistant director of
the Lang Center

attempted to examine

whether service projects were actually
accomplishing their goals and whether colleges across the country could replicate successful programs from other schools.
Kardon-Brown said what she had gained
from the conference was an understanding
that other colleges share the challenges
Swarthmore is facing. These challenges
include broad issues, such as how to connect
activism and service and how to work with
community organizations, as well as smaller
operational issues, such as organizing transportation and location needs.
Officially, Project Pericles "challenges
colleges and universities to broaden their
missions to include learning experiences, in
and out of the classroom, that give students
the intellectual and experiential foundations
for responsible citizenship." It also requires
that participating colleges incorporate the
goal of social responsibility into their mis-

sion and promise a formal commitment
from the administration.

Swarthmore's response to joining Projec
Pericles was to establish the Lang Center fo
Social Responsibility, which opened in
September 2002 and is expected to move t
the renovated Swarthmore train station in
mid-July. Kardon-Brown described the Lan
Center as "a centrally located institution
that serves as an organizational base for a

she said.

To meet the
expectations ofthe Project Pericles, the Lang
Center hopes to coordinate three major com
ponents of civic involvement: preparation
and reflection. Kardon-Brown
stressed the necessity of preparing student
to effectively combat social problems.
"We need to ask ourselves, 'ls service jus
something we do make ourselves feel gooc
or are we really trying to make a positiv

change?' We need to train students to as]
more fundamental questions about how to
solve social problems, not just treat th
symptoms," she said.
While the establishment of the Lang
Center is the most visible result o
Swarthmore's participation in Projec
Pericles, students and administrators hop
the effect will be more pervasive in th

future.

"Swarthmore is beginning to examin

more ways to join community service anc

authentic and genuine opportunities fo

in an e-mail. Lee founded the Learning fo

schools.

Graffiti mars SEPTA depot
A man removes spray-painted graffiti, which included the messages
"Bush=Saddam" and "Bush=No penis." The words covered advertisements and
buildings around the train stop near campus. The station is the property of the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, but the SEPTA police asked
Public Safety to help investigate. Owen Redgrave, director of Public Safety, said,
"We have no legal reason to be there or enforce anything." He reported that, at
3:15 a.m. on Saturday, April 12, about the time the vandalism occurred, someone
saw three people by the train station. They later left the station and went up Magill
Walk. "We think they could have been involved," Redgrave said.

Both Kai Xu 'O3, who attended the conference as an intern of Cooperative
Involvement of Volunteers in Communities
(CIVIC), and Karima Wilson 'O3, a recipient
of a Lang Opportunity Scholarship, said the
event had put forth ambiguous goals. "There
was a lack of clarity. Civic engagement
means a lot of things to different people.
Some stressed voting, while others were
talking about community service," Xu said.
The role of the faculty also concerned
them. "The faculty doesn't have the incen-

tive to meet these goals unless we broaden
the requirements for tenure, to include service, for example," Xu said. But political science professor Ben Berger, who also attended the conference, said that, while lack of
incentive may be a problem at some schools,
he did not believe it was a concern at
Swarthmore.

"I have found the faculty as well as the

April 17, 2003

administration to be extraordinarily recep-

tive to service-learning initiatives and other

means of enhancing political engagement

campus," he said.

on

Instead, the problems he perceived were
the possible lack of academic rigor in service-learning courses, saying some faculty

might "look down on service-learning courses as intellectually soft and thereby discourage others from teaching them." He also said
some colleges at the conference had advocated faculty research concerning civic engagement but that this could impinge on the faculty's right to determine their own research
topics.
The project, which hopes to "claim the
legacy of Pericles," is named after the
Athenian political and military leader, who
encouraged
civic participation and
advanced democratic ideals in the fifth century BCE.

group rallies

Pro-Palestinian activists speak

for educational reform
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore students and faculty rallied at the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg
Monday to demand that lawmakers
change state education policies. They
joined over 75 students from more than 15

Pennsylvania colleges.

The rally was part of the Stand for
Children campaign, an ongoing presence
at the state capital to remind legislators
that every child in Pennsylvania needs
and deserves a high-quality education.
Campaign members are there every day
the legislature is in session. Monday was
the 16th day of the protest, which will continue until June. The campaign is spon-

sored by Good Schools Pennsylvania
(GSPA), a statewide non-profit organization that works for comprehensive public
education reform.
The students gathered at the Capitol
around noon. There are about five bills
that legislators have proposed, but not all
of them are desirable to the protestors.
Robert Boostrom 'O5, a member of GSPA,
said, "A lot of them only fix half the problem or fix a problem not really about education."
Most groups at the rally expressed
their support for Governor Ed Rendell's
new compromise bill, the Plan for a New
Pennsylvania. It is a budget package that
proposes to reduce property taxes an
average
of 30 percent
across
Pennsylvania and invest significant new
state revenue in education, specifically
programs proven to boost student
pre-kinderachievement, including
garten, full-day kindergarten, small
class sizes and tutoring.
After rallying and discussing legislation for an hour, the students attempted
to meet with senators and representatives, but a memorial service for the
Speaker of the House was taking place,
and no one was in. The students still visited each office and left behind baseball
cards showing the state's education statistics. The students felt the trip was successful despite the setback. "It was a bit
of a disappointment, but we'll get them

was the second time the
Swarthmore chapter of GSPA had participated in Stand for Children. They last visited Harrisburg on February 25 and spoke
with Senator Edwin Erickson of the
Delaware County district, whom they said
was supportive.
"This movement has a strong chance
for success because it unites so many different groups of people," Paris said. "It's
not just college students who participate."

The campaign sponsors special days that
range from senior citizen day to
Methodist day. Boostrom said, "It's a really complex kind of movement. There are
so many different kinds of people and so
many different reasons to get involved in

While their reasons for joining GSPA
varied greatly, members share common

such as all-day kindergarten, pre-kindergarten, smaller class sizes, advanced technology, extra academic help and social

Former Israeli leader urges strong action in Iraq
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Although
former Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres

received a Nobel Prize for his
attempts to achieve peace in
Israel, he spoke in favor of the
United States' military action in
the Middle East during a presentation at the University of
Pennsylvania last Sunday.
"Military action in Iraq creates an opportunity that we
should not miss," he said, as he
addressed a crowd of approximately 800 at the Annenberg
Center for the Performing Arts in
University City.

Peres has been a part of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament,
since 1959 and served as Minister
of Foreign Affairs under Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon until
October. He shared the Nobel
Prize with Yitzhak Rabin and
Yasser Arafat in 1994 for their
effort to reach a peace agreement
in Israel. Peres has served two
non-consecutive terms as prime
minister. He was the prime min-

ister after the assassination of
Rabin in November of 1994. Peres
came to speak in Philadelphia as
part of a growing organization
called Caravan for Democracy.

"I wish that the Arab
nations would unite
and harmonize their
behavior with that of
the United States."
Shimon Peres
Founded last October as a
joint venture between the Jewish
National Fund (JNF) and Media
Watch International, Caravan for
Democracy has hosted 50 events
on college campuses across the
country. Its purpose is to feature
Israeli leaders who explain the
political situation in Israel and
the Middle East. The organization's slogan summarizes its
political agenda: "Israel and
Sharing
America:
Hopes;
Sharing Values."
JNF President Ronald Lauder
opened Sunday's presentation by

explaining the goal behind
Caravan for Democracy. "We
have seen recently a great deal of
misinformed discussions and a lot
of half-truths and lies about
Israel," he said. "It is important
for students, both Jewish and nonJewish, to hear from various leaders about what Israel stands for."
According to Lauder, Caravan
for Democracy encourages student activism in addition to providing an education in international affairs. "We want you to be
able to talk to people who are
telling lies about Israel and tell
them what you know," he said.
After Lauder introduced
Peres, the former prime minister
took the stage to a standing ovation. His speech lasted approxi-

addressed the challenges facing

declared his
for
America's current defense policy.
"The U.S. was attacked," he said.
"It's not that the U.S. has
attacked the terrorists. The U.S.
went to war in order to defend
the security of its people."
Calling Saddam Hussein "one
of the greatest killers of our
time," Peres said that it was time
for the Iraqis to accept the modern age. "When you realize what
sparked the war, it was people
who thought that modern life and
high-tech would destroy their
own tradition," he said. "The
Iraqi people will taste freedom
and will taste the future thanks
to the efforts of America and its
allies."
Peres went so far as to say that
it was of no consequence whether
or not the United States found
weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq. Rather, he said that Saddam
Hussein's personality provided
the impetus for war. "Hussein
has shown that he has the will
personnel
and
to produce
weapons of mass destruction," he
said. "He has shown that he will
use them. What does it matter if
you find them?"

Furthermore, Peres called for
the United States to use modernity to secure the end of global terrorism. "Without modernity, we
cannot move ahead in the world
where flying is dangerous and
living on the 20th floor is a risk,"
he said.
After his speech, Peres spent
the remainder of the hour fielding questions from the audience

he
said.
"The

In
his
antiPalestinian statement, Peres
declaredthat he would not accept
a Palestinian state that would
compromise the current borders
of Israel. "We're against a

"We're against the partition of

In closing, Peres addressed
the supremacy of the United

against what he termed "the sick-

ness ofanti-Semitism."
"I wish that the Arab nations
would unite and harmonize their
behavior with that of the United

Throughout the hour of questions, no student attempted to
challenge Peres on any ofhis proIsrael or pro-war statements.

Themed housing scrapped
Options fail to attract required applicants

iors were not interested in applying because the rooms in
Woolman are all doubles. "I guess sophomores just weren't
interested," Mister said.
Westphal said Housing Committee would look at the
failure of the themed housing options and determine
whether they should be offered again next year. "The poll

40 people were interested," Westphal said. "We will have to

BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ

abrownil@swarthmore.edu
Due to a lack of interest, the multicultural education
hall and substance-free housing will not be available next
year.
The number of applicants totaled less than half of the 21
spaces available in Woolman for substance-free housing
and less than a quarter of the 24 spaces in Mertz for the
multicultural education hall, according to Director of

Residential Life Myrt Westphal.
Westphal
identified several reasons Housing
Committee may have failed to attract the required number
of applicants. A lack of publicity, an inability to counter
the negative response of the campus and a failure to educate the campus about themed housing may have been the
causes, she said.
Students may have also been unwilling to use their
block positions to apply for the housing or worried that
their friends would not apply, Westphal suggested. She
said one student interested in substance-free housing told
her he was worried he would be identified by his housing
choice. She said that the student felt that being substancefree was only a small part of his personality.
Westphal also said she had heard criticism that the
deans had imposed the new housing, though the housing
options were entirely student-initiated.
Jon Rosa 'O3, who proposed the multicultural education
hall, felt the petition opposing the hall might have been a
detriment. "The bad press didn't necessarily help it," Rosa
said.
Rosa also thought students perceived the hall as a "hall
for people of color," which prevented them from applying.
In the case of substance-free housing, David Mister 'O4,
who proposed the housing, thought that juniors and sen-

"I guess sophomores just weren't

She said the committee would ask itself whether the
failure was in the concept or the implementation, whether
there is a way to fix it and what the committee could learn
from the failure of themed housing.
Westphal said that, next year, the Housing Committee
would have to decide whether the themed housing fits into
the general housing philosophy of the college.
"This year, we felt, 'Let's give it a try'," Westphal said.
Next year, she added, the committee may not feel the same
way.
Applications for the themed housing were due on April

Committee may transfer benefit
bank credits to fund health care

The Faculty and Staff Benefits
Committee may reallocate funds from
the benefit bank credits (BBC) as a
way to increase funding of family
health care plans for college
employees.

The committee must file a formal
recommendation to the Board of
Managers for their approval before
the college will implement it.
In a letter addressed to the committee, the Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign voiced
concerns that single low■

and

employees would be at a disadvantage by the loss of the
benefit bank credits. The
campaign said the college
should increase the budget
for family health-care funding by $ll million rather than

"Though I understand the Living
Wage Committee has doubts
regarding our process, I believe
you couldn't find a more democratic process."
Martin Cormican

The FSBC expressed a
commitment to funding all
health plans equally, which
would cost $l.l million.
The allocation of benefit bank
credits was identified as one of the
reasons for the unequal funding,
according to the committee. Of the
$1.6 million annual budget, $600,000
of BBC money is distributed as cash
instead of as benefits.
While the benefits committee recognizes that reallocating these
funds to increase health care benefits would mean a "take-away" for
many, it also feels this change may
be the best solution to the problem.
The presentation concluded that, to
equalize health-care funding, the

benefits committee would have to
phase out the BBC.
But this decision is far from
final. In March, FSBC held 20 open
meetings to obtain feedback from
faculty and staff on the possible
change. Approximately 120 members

of the faculty and staff came to these

A small fire broke out in the Paces kitchen on

alarm also went off.
A Public Safety officer soon arrived on the

The Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association

Firefighters examined the scene to ensure that
no secondary fires were still burning and ventilated
the building. Aside from the dishrag, there was no
damage, Redgrave said.
At the time of the fire, Paces was locked and
had the lights out. Many people, according to
Redgrave, have access to the Paces kitchen and
those who were interviewed denied involvement.
"We don't think it was intentional," Redgrave
said.

Worthstock gains funding
Festival to offer four bands, guitar workshop
Benjamin Galynker 'O3, Ross Hoffman
'O4 and David McCandlish 'O5 organized
this year's event. Compared with previous
years, Worthstock 2003 has a bigger budget
and more off-campus bands, according to
McCandlish.

BY SUE CHEN
schenl@swarthmore.edu

Worthstock has received about $7,000 to
host four bands this year, $4,000 more than
the its usual funding. Held annually as a

part of Spring Fling, the all-day music festival will take place on May 3 this year.
The event received $2,500 from the
Social Affairs Committee, $4,200 from the
President's Office, $3OO from WSRN, about
$lOO from the Intercultural Center and $75
from the Black Cultural Center.

Galynker had originally wanted to
bring a blues festival to Swarthmore but
thought it would be a good idea to join
forces with Hoffman, who organized

Worthstock last year.
Originally, Lukas and Harris charged

about $7,000 to perform, but after rounds of
bargaining, the bands lowered their fee.

"We really wanted all four artists,
because they really round out the music
spectrum," Galynker said.
The planning began at the beginning of
this semester, but the guest list was only
finalized recently, since organizers had to
obtain money from various sources and
bargain prices with the artists.
"The hardest part is being up in the air
on whether all of your blood, sweat and
tears will amount to what it is you dreamed
of in the first place," Galynker said.
In addition to the all-day concert, there
will also be a guitar-playing workshop by
Lukas on Mav 2.

"They really round out the
music spectrum."
Benjamin Galynker 'O3
The performers will include guitarist
Gary Lukas, blues guitarist Corey Harris,
the five-piece salsa band Frank Bambara y

klezmer group King Django Roots and
Cultural Band, according to Worthstock
organizers.

Al Bloom discusses
Swarthmore's mission
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER
ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

President Al Bloom asked more than
30 students about their "questions and
concerns" last Thursday evening in
Kohlberg Coffee Bar, saying that "it was
the best way to get to know each other."
The students had come to hear Bloom
speak on the future of the college. Prior to
asking for questions, Bloom had
explained
his
with
involvement
Swarthmore as a linguistics professor and
administrator before he became the college president in 1990. He then spoke on
the distinct advantages of Swarthmore's
educational atmosphere, including its
commitment to social responsibility and
civic engagement.
"Swarthmore students and faculty
have a real commitment to using their
knowledge to make the world a better
place and to engage complexities within
the ethical realm," he said, adding that it
was "the student body who reinforces this
culture of ethical intelligence that is most
distinctive in the atmosphere and legacy
of Swarthmore."
Students inquired about what Bloom
perceived as Swarthmore's negative
aspects.
Bloom
said he thought
Swarthmore's small size, with only 17,000
living alumni, made it difficult to have the
visibility of larger universities. In addition, he recognized the stress most students felt and said that it was "hard to recognize how special what is happening to
you is while you are still here."

Students also raised concerns about
the lack of acceptance for political diversity, which Bloom said he found disappointing because lack of respect goes
against everything that Swarthmore
stands for.
Bloom also addressed the future of the

"Swarthmore students
and faculty have a real
commitment to using their
knowledge to make the
world a better place and
to engage complexities
within the ethical realm."
President Al Bloom
Bloom urged students to come talk to
him in his office if they ever had questions. "There's nothing I enjoy more than
getting to know students," he said.
Most students appreciated the opportunity to hear from Bloom, though some
said they wished that Bloom had recognized the negative aspects of Swarthmore
equally.
Ryan Budish 'O4, co-president of
Student Council, said that "what is important is that there was over an hour of letting students discuss what is important to
them and to directly engage and challenge
the head of the school."
Educational Policy Representative
Melinda Lee 'O4 said it was "important to
respect and admire that the administration is willing to put itself out there, to
combat student attitudes."

increases. In addition, he attempted to
explain socially responsible investing,
which he said is an inherently complex
topic, considering the administration's
desire to balance the interests of all constituencies of the college.

Can one 'win' the room lottery?

Mary Lyon: Walking to and from ML will freeze you in the
winter and annoy you in the fall and spring. The rooms are
large, and this dorm probably has the most distinctive character of any campus space. For many, the character of the
place is a problem, while, for others, the ML community is
like a family. Mary Lyon appeals to: Swillies. Also: sex

addicts.
Willets: The smell of vomit and marijuana welcomes students
to Willets. This description will attract some and drive away
others. Willets appeals to: first-years, people who don't sleep
and drug abusers.
Wharton: Seniors and

first-years

love Wharton. The

singles

Dana and Hallowed: No one will ever visit you in
Danawell. The halls are riot-proof (read: confusing and claustrophobia-inducing), and the dorms almost hidden in the
Crum. The bay windows are nice, but only in the outside
rooms. Danawell appeals to: recluses and people who are good
at mazes.

PPR: Huge, airy rooms with lots of natural light. Hooray!
Long walk up a hill to reach your classes. Boo! P and P have
their fair share of socially inclined first-years and sophomores, but Roberts offers large blocks of dormmates you'll
probably never meet. PPR appeals to: people who love long
distances and people who require huge amounts of space.
Worth: If you live here with friends, it can be like having
your own apartment. If you move in here alone, it could be a
lonely year. Worth appeals to: cliquey seniors, recluses.
Woolman; The most hidden dorm, Woolman almost went substance-free this year. It kind of already was. Still, it offers a
nice space "on the other side" for a few lucky sophomores and
an experience totally removed from all the other dorms.

Got number 1,190? Hah!

through. Wharton appeals to: virtually everyone, not that it matters, since you won't get it, 'O6.

Mertz: In most years, Mertz is a desirable living option, but
next year might be a low point. Residents will have a construction project as their neighbor. The other two downsides
of Mertz are the Frisbee players the residents must dodge on
their way to dinner and the Bog. Mertz appeals to: Frisbee

themselves as more privileged than

and the tour groups constantly coming

Parrish: This noble architectural achievement towers over
the campus and houses the entire administration, which
seems like a plus. You can show people your room on the college's logo. Neato! The downsides of this dorm are the fact
that it is a deathtrap in the event of a fire, the walk to do laundry is excessively vertical and you will get tired of sports
teams practicing by running up and down your halls. Parrish
appeals to: people scared of the opposite sex, fire-resistant
students.

The Phoenix realizes that choosing a room
is difficult.
There are many factors to consider;
thus, follow the example of the pair of
first-years our editor discovered in her room last
year. They were
hunched over, counting
the number of electrical
HJtlets and meticulously making
•ally marks on a clipboard.
Obviously, they understood the
power of information in an otherwise overwhelming situation. For
even with a nice, low lottery
number, you might still be foolish enough to "buy" a room
with thin walls or no closet if
you don't do your homework
...,e a good Swattie should.
The first thing to do, of course, is to eavesdrop in Sharpies and discover what hall "that
kid" is going to pick onto next year. Then avoid
that hall. But when it comes to the more subtle
distinctions, we all can use a little more advice
than the housing committee can bring us.
Forthwith, our own guide to campus dorms.

romance and first-years crying about the
housing lottery
these are the traditions of April. The experienced upperclass people laugh as they hear frosh ask
each other "Is U32 a good number?" and
discuss whether they should try to live in
Worth, Wharton or Mertz as sophomores.
Some may think it is hypocritical or
just plain mean for a rising senior to
write about the humor of housing. I will
be living in a nice single in Worth next
year. The first-years reading this article
won't be so lucky. However, my tale of
woe is a long and sad one, and the fact
that I survived should bring hope to even
the most terrified of first-years.
As a first-year, I applied for three
blocks, received none and ended up in
ML basement. It was so miserable that
the college completely renovated the hall
as soon as I moved out. At the end of that
year, I applied for three blocks, received
none and went to study abroad, worried
about the possibility of living in the
Haven upon my return. I was continually
unhappy with or worried about my housing for 18 months in a row.
Despite the fact that some of you
won't be overjoyed with your housing,
you should look for the humor in it. If I
can do it, then you can, too. The housing
lottery brings a lot of stress into many
lives on campus, but worried first-years
should try to recognize the comedy
inherent in this event. And the frosh
aren't the only ones providing the
laughs.

The seniors are a surprisingly amusit comes to housing.
When the rest of us receive our numbers
and talk about blocking or the lottery,
they adopt an attitude of superiority.
"Oh, housing. That is so plebeian," many
ing group when

of those about to graduate say. The best
response is, "Oh, and where will you be
living? Your parents' basement?" Most
seniors will stop talking at that point.
Some have been known to whimper
weakly and begin to cry. The lucky few
going straight to grad school or good jobs
are impossible to cut down to size, so
never talk about housing around them.
The rising seniors are not too humorous. They all end up in hot singles in virtually whichever dorm they want. This is
the spot of privilege. All members of 'O4
should remember to laugh at everyone
else this year.
Rising juniors are often intensely
nervous. Many of them lost big in their

only previous lottery experience and fear
ending up in the ML basement singles.
The worried expressions on their faces as
they contemplate a move to a tiny offcampus single with no natural light is
enough to evoke a belly laugh from even
their most empathetic friends.
Finally, there are the first-years. They
are so innocent, so foolish and so destined to end up in a terrible room. When
they return home from the lottery and
tell you, while choking back tears, "It's
in oh, God" [student runs off wailing],
you have to laugh. Thinking about the
concept of a four-digit lottery number
certainly brings a chuckle to the minds
of most upperclass people.
...

The reason that all these students'
fears and emotions are funny is that
housing is really not the big deal most
first-years make it out to be. If you and
your bestest friend don't live next to each
other, you can still visit. If you live somewhere terrible, you will survive. One
year is short, and you will be back on
campus in a cushy single before you
know it. Remember that you will survive
your new room, and remember to laugh
loudly at the absurdity of all the people
grieving at the lottery.

Student caterers
combine business

BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

Sharpies got you down? Do you wonder if your favorite Tarble chicken
sandwich is really all that
dead? Does your campus event
well
require more than the mundane, putrid, yet oddly habit-forming, lime-flavored nacho chips and [insert flavor] soda from Tarble? Then perhaps it's
time to look into a more sophisticated means of sustenance. Fortunately
for you, there lies a hidden treasure in the Swarthmore gastronomic community. First-years Ja'Dell Davis and Jordy Owen have just started their
own campus catering business.
Davis and Owen had been cooking for Swarthmore African-American
Student Society dinners for a semester and a half without thanks. But
then, like the brilliant Swatties they are, they devised a plan. "We both
loved to cook and we've been doing it so long that we figured, why not

we pace and our palms sweat over some newly

can't just replace work with sex. Swat, we need

Now, let's gather in a circle and hold hands
OK, just kidding. But here are some ideas for
dealing with raging to-do lists and raging hormones at the same time:
Make time. Unless we're talking secondsemester honors seniors here, this is really a
distinct possibility. Your lab report can totally
wait a few hours. In this carefully set-aside time
slot, do something new and sexy. Practice some

charge for our services?" Owen said.
The partners have been cooking since they were lowly sous-chefs within their families. "My mother used to own a restaurant and is now a parttime caterer," Owen said. "She taught me pretty much everything I
know." Davis began cooking alongside her grandmother in what she
called "the fattest but happiest state in the country," Louisiana.
Owen and Davis let go of their mothers' apron strings but took what
they had learned to college with them. Davis's specialty is banana pudding, while Jordy has perfected a "mean beef stew." They specialize in
Caribbean and soul food and recently have been learning to cook Thai
food. "We're certainly not limited to these types of foods," said a grinning
Owen. "We're also pretty good at following recipes."
The partners use the Black Cultural Center and the Campus Resource
Center kitchens to prepare their delectable dishes. "We usually start to
prepare the food the night before the event," Davis said. "After getting the
preparation work done, we spend about three or four hours the day of the
event finishing the job."

Davis began cooking alongside her
grandmother in what she called
"the fattest but happiest state in
the country," Louisiana.
They will make their debut culinary appearance tomorrow night at the
Gospel Choir's Good Friday dinner. The pair will serve chicken fettuccini, a breaded filet offish, green beans, seasoned red potatoes, salad, bread
and strawberry trifle at the dinner. "It's going to be a lot of work," Davis
said, "but we're both very excited about the opportunity."
Their rates start at $6O for small gatherings and increase to $l5O for
larger events, not including the price of groceries. "We started out charging a per-head rate," Owen said, "but that got to be too complicated, so we
opted to go with a general flat rate depending on the size of the event."
So if Sharpies' homestyle tofu just isn't "homestyle" enough for you or
if you're sick of having cheese curls as your event's main entree, consider Jordy and Ja'Dell's catering service.

The Hitachi Magic Wand may

a really easy way to convince yourself to take a
break from that problem set. If you're not single
or you're up for some self-romance, get the hell
off campus and go ballroom dancing or something. Think Philly for dinner or even Paces for
a party so you can grind together (for once) and

stumble home happy.

Thinking of suggestions makes me wistful to
take my own advice as well as ask, "What do
romantic people without Swat workloads do for
fun, anyway?" Drunk on spring, do they lounge
in hammocks? Sip drinks on porches? Wiggle
bare toes in the grass while picnicking (or,
ahem, practicing after-picnic debauchery)?
Well, why can't we do it, too? We can! We will!
It's spring, and we're crazy!

'I am trying to break your heart'
Documentary maker Sam Jones shows the humanity and the greatness of Wilco's leader
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu
Jeff Tweedy, the lead singer and songwriter for Wilco, is in a musical category
whose only other occupants are The
Beatles and Miles Davis. Like those visionaries, Tweedy has created a musical genre
and then single-handedly restructured it
multiple times.
In 1990, he and Jay Farrar, as part of the
band Uncle Tupelo, released the album "No

Depression," which spawned not only a

band but an entire eponymous genre as
well. Tweedy and Farrar proved that punk
rock and country music shared the same
basic principle
by
teenage frustration
imbuing
their dissatisfaction with
Midwestern small-town claustrophobia
with the vigor of youthful snotty British
disenchantment. Even after Uncle Tupelo
disbandedfour years later because Tweedy
and Farrar could no longer coexist, Tweedy
followed the same blueprint with his new
band, Wilco.
Then, something funny happened. 1999's
"Summerteeth" featured countless keyboards, as though Tweedy wanted to surf
the Mississippi with the Beach Boys. The
band's most recent album "Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot" disproved Jerry Seinfeld's theory
that you can't over-die, because Tweedy
killed the "No Depression" genre once
again. The lyrics were surrealist; although
the album's first four words were "I am an

American," the next two were "aquarium

Of course, destroying your own creation
is a precarious task, which filmmaker Sam
Jones verifies in his documentary "I Am

Trying to Break Your Heart," a chronicle of
the making of Wilco's last album. The film
opens with statements about how Wilco
has always been a band just beyond the

grasp of mainstream success and that this
album is crucial to the band's career,
which only increases the pressure of complete aesthetic revision. Scenes of the

recording process follow, featuring the
band members continuously reworking

taries because it's not over-indulgent,
redundancy still permeates Jones' film.

The story behind "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" is
a classic three-act production and directs
itself; anyone could have pressed "play" on
the cameras and thought of a few provocative questions, and it would have sufficed.
In Act one, the band is happily and independently working on its own artistic masterpiece. Act two features the obstacles presented by Reprise Records, Wilco's label.

Tweedy uses the same approach with songs
as he does with entire genres. He creates
something and then destroys it specifically
for the purpose of building something new
and greater around the original theme.
But although "I Am Trying to Break

Tweedy forces multi-instrumentalist Jay

Still, perhaps Jones is simply using a
new approach to honor Jeff Tweedy.

Tweedy for his artistic genius, Jones
humanizes him. He makes sure that

Even Sandler can't save 'Anger Management'
BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu

Adam Sandler is funny. Usually. At least, I don't ordinarily leave his movies feeling like I want to kill something. The same can't be said for Jack Nicholson. He's
done some pretty bad flicks. But his role is usually the
refresher, sometimes the sole reason to even bother with
a movie. This, sadly, was not the case for "Anger

storyline.

Most of what transpires between
Dr. Rydell and David does not make
any sense, even when the writers
try desperately to wrap the whole
thing together at the end.
In a totally confusing, barely amusing series of senseless aerial events, Sandler's Dave Buznick finds himself
in court before a seemingly retarded, ruthless judge who
sentences him to 20 hours of anger management therapy.
There's nothing angry about Dave, though, and I guess
that's the funny (or the ultimately ironic) part. The
movie opens with a clip of his younger years: awkward

THE

PHOENIX

in his Dukes of Hazzard baseball tee, gaping at an eighties-style pretty girl, garnering the courage to approach
her when he finds himself suddenly pantsed by the
neighborhood bully, his smallness and insecurity both
fully exposed. Apparently, the incident etched itself permanently on his psyche. Apparently, being 12, bucktoothed and fully humiliated leads to being 30, timid and
a totally self-doubting doormat. So David's not angry,
and he's going to therapy under the care of Nicholson's
Rydell, who, incidentally, is a raving, very overtly angry
lunatic and was the impetus for the whole legal mess.
Eventually, Dr. Rydell, via another sequence of baffling
fiascoes, winds up moving in with David to monitor his
every move and treat him accordingly. This leads to a lot
of, I guess, funny situations. The 4'9" middle school kids
who sat in front of me were laughing when the crazy doctor snuggled into bed with his reticent patient, flopped his
thick, hairy arm over the cowering man's body and loudly
farted. Most of what transpires between Dr. Rydell and
David does not make any sense, and little of it is very cohesive, even when the writers try desperately to wrap the
whole thing together at the end. Too much random crap
happens with too little foundation in anything other than
the fact that, in isolation, the events could possibly be construed as somewhat comical.
All of the characters shy from three dimensions, and
the two hours are spattered with a little too much overdone penis humor. All of what was supposedly the substance of the plot was entirely predictable and not nearly as original as a plot containing so many haphazard,
matchless instants of idea should have been. I guess I
should have predicted the flop, but I was optimistically
counting on Sandler to keep things interesting (which

the lamest, most boring and most severely unyielding
character possible) and on Nicholson to at least provide
a stellar delivery in the midst of what might otherwise
have sucked. But Dave Buznick didn't give Sandler an
inch, and Nicholson, despite his well-tousled locks and
his perfectly cracked-out grin, had some major performance problems. I didn't expect "Anger Management" to
be a quality film that would be the target of allusions for
years to come, but I did expect a decent giggle, and, in my
injudiciousness, I wound up in need of therapy myself as

'Man Equals Man'
Acting

111 students have worked hard on
"Man Equals Man." If all goes accord-

ing to plan this weekend, the audience
will work hard, too.
Cast members, who have rehearsed the
Bertolt Brecht play under the directorship of
professor Roger Babb, spoke of epic theater
and Brechtian acting methodology as "challenging." Sam Dingman 'O4 described one element
of Brechtian theater with which he has been
wrestling. "Rather than playing the character,
I'm trying to quote the character," he said.
"Brecht wants to show you the inner workings
of the characters' environment rather than trying to show you the inner workings of the characters." Dingman plays protagonist Galy Gay, a
character Joe Small 'O5 described as "a gullible
everyman who is transformed into a killing
machine by the play's end."
Cast member Felicia Leicht 'O4 explained
epic theater as "presentational" and "distanced." The goal, she said, is "keeping the
audience and the actors from empathizing with
each other." This "alienation effect" is achieved
through "finding an action that says more than

grand, emotionatly gripping performance where
an- audience member personally empathizes
with the characters," according to Small.
"This is a group effort," he said. "There is a
protagonist, but, in this play, everybody is needed." Small said Brecht's plays were "designed
to challenge the audience, to make them think
immediately as well as afterwards, motivating
them to create social change."
The actors interviewed emphasized that the
point of epic theater is to entertain while being
discomfiting; it seeks to express a message by
capturing attention. Leicht described the play
as "very surprisingly accessible, since, so much
is presented directly to the audience."
Summarizing the plot of "Man Equals Man,"
Dingman highlighted the play's "timeliness in
light of current international events." This
"super topical" play is "about this guy, Galy Gay,
who goes out to get a fish for dinner and meets
three soldiers on his way." The soldiers have
lost their fourth squad member on a temple
raid and will get in trouble at roll call, so they
get Galy Gay to help them out by joining their

people," Dingman

■

In addition to the piece's political overtures,
cast members expect the audience to be
turned on by certain gimmicks the class has
developed to enhance the experience of epic
theater. For example, the character of the
Widow Begbick is simultaneously played by
Leicht, Kate Hurster 'O3 and Adrienne Mackey
'O4.
"She's a very potent presence," Leicht said
of the widow. This interpretation of the character, she said, came from director Babb and the
class as a result of exercises the students ran
before casting the play. "It's been a particularly
fun time creating a third of a character," Leicht
laughed, adding "and it's not too jarring; [this
interpretation] actually works with the text."
The Acting 111 class has further colored the
play-by inserting Brechtian theory. The cast
added lines explaining certain aspects of the
theory, spoken by Jedd Cohen 'O4. Small
the insertions as "a consciously fun way
people to understand what Brecht was
thinking.' Unconventional and pterruptive,
insertions are meant to achieve the alienabout it "If I was in

SE KING
ASYLUMS
bY

In a Daring Exploits insane edition, our intrepid explorer tackles
two unexplored mental hospitals for your ereeped-out delight
After failed expeditions to the prosthetic leg house and the nuclear
missile site, Erik Osheim 'O3 and I decided to return to our abandoned
insane asylum roots last weekend. Amid padded rooms, underground
patient-transport tunnels and zealous security guards, how could we
help but find adventure? For added punch, we included two institutes
in our travel plans: the Pennhurst School and Hospital as well as the
Philadelphia Hospital for the Insane, also known as Byberry.
In the late 19th century, social reformers believed in "moral treatment" for people With mental illnesses: If the insane were separated
from society and housed in ornate buildings with views of natural
greenery, they would eventually recover. When these methods failed,
doctors turned to more brutal methods: shock therapy, sterilization
and lobotomy. Rather than treat illnesses, mental hospitals served to
confine patients and prevent them from contaminating the gene pool.
Overcrowding resulted in further cruelty. By the 19605, mental health
care had degenerated from placing patients in idyllic atmospheres
to locking them in cages and poking them with cattle
prods. Public outrage brought about new reforms.
With the advent of improved medicines, asylums across the country were vacated and
left to the elements.
Pennhurst follows this
model. Founded in 1913 to treat
"epileptic, idiotic, imbecile and feeble-minded persons," the hospital
eventually became a grotesque
menagerie of abuse. Today, an
Internet search for "Pennhurst"
results in a list of lawsuits filed
against the institution for .
mistreatment.
patient
Pennhurst closed in the 1980s,
and carousing youths like Erik
and myself have trespassed on its
grounds ever since.
We arrived under cover of darkness and crept along an overgrown path
to the complex. Brick structures lined a
v
courtyard full of brambles. All buildings
were dark
aside from one, from whence lights
glowed. Who could be inside? Security guards?
Practitioners of the dark arts? Not caring to interrupt either
group, Erik and I avoided the well-lit edifice.
We entered a building labeled "CNEN" to look for the hospital
morgue. Paintings of cars and cartoon characters peeled from the
walls, and gun magazines were strewn all over the floor. We found a
padded chair with a restraining strap, a smashed TV and the ruins of
a barbershop, but nothing truly shocking. For that, we ventured down
to the underground tunnels.
Erik led the way with our flashlight-truncheon. Distinctive bits of
graffiti served as markers as we made our way through the winding
passageways. After turning several dark corners, I gasped to see one
room illuminated by a functioning light bulb. We tiptoed our way into
it, only to find a rotund and unidentifiable piece of furniture.
Scattered in the room behind it were typewriters, word processors
and notebooks full of receipts. Evidently, we had reached the account-

quency; surely we would find the morgue before long! We turned th

series of electronic beeping sounds disturbed the quiet.
An alarm!
Erik dashed away with the flashlight, leaving me stumbling in th

puddles as our breathing echoed down every hall. At last we reachec
the stairs and stomped outside into the fresh air. We didn't fully rela

patient?) had lived in a hole in the wall

comb and shoes remained.

Erik and I stamped through briars around the mortician's

building. In the moonlight, we spotted an open door, but just before
we stepped inside, a flashlight beam flickered past the entrance. We
froze and waited for the light to pass. Throughout the night, Erik and
I heard footsteps and screams, though we never actually saw other
people. At one point we found a lighted candle where we'd noticed
none before. Frightful!
Word has it police monitor the hospital in white buggies, nabbin
every trespasser they find. We didn't spot a single go-cart, though w
did accidentally verge upon a security van parked along the perime
ter. When the officer inside switched on his searchlight, we waited fo
him to bumble out and harangue us. However, he failed to exit th
vehicle, and we continued breaking into various buildings.
At around three in the morning, we decided to quit the dank stru
tures in favor of Swarthmore. One night is simply not enough timefo
two asylums. Someday we'll return to Pennhurst and Byberry fo
another weekend of morgue-hunting drollery.

love transcends, you pessimistic son of a bitch. Besides,
after a weekend with Neal's mom, I'm pretty sure she was
diggin' me. I am, after all, very, very hot^.
We first decided to meet at the group session with Bob
Gross, Al Bloom and the provost. It went something like
this:

Ben: Hey, Neal's mom!
Neal's mom: You are the most attractive man I have ever

seen.

Ben: Thanks!
Bob Gross: Ben, you are the meaning of Swarthmore.

that kind of thing with adults2 .
This week's date comes out of respect for that sacred

After the trip to the zoo, the hot air balloon, the limou-

sine tour of New York City, the backpacking trip through
Europe and the precious time we spent working together
in the Peace Corps, our weekend was nearing its end. I
realized it was time to say the words that Usha so desperately wanted to hear.

Comic books that rule: A beginner's guide to the good stuff
You might think the comic book world populated by 'derivative garbage,' but give it just one more chance
I'm trying something new this week and cutting right
to the main point: Comic hooks rule. Rule, as in "totally
rock your face." If you knew that already, you have my pergo read "Krazy Kat" or somemission not to read this
thing. But the thing that makes me sad is I know there's at
least a big chunk of you who are all like, "What? Comic
books? Ick!" Or, if you're male, "Yeah! X-Men! Seventh

And while the X-Men are indeed pretty
sweet, I'm hoping to dissuade you both a bit. Seventh grade
did not, in fact, rule, and comic books are something you

should check out even now.
First, let's backtrack a bit. Last weekend I saw Art
Speigelman at Haverford, home of many ducks and some
Quakers (or is it the other way around?). For the uningrade ruled!"

formed, this is the guy who did "Maus," that comic book

("Graphic novel?" Whatever, Mr. Highbrow-pants)

that

sophisticated people are allowed to say they like because it
won a Pulitzer. It deserved that Pulitzer; it's amazing,
moving, frightening and everything else a comic about the
Holocaust featuring anthropomorphic mice should be. If
no one has made you read it for a class yet, go check it out
now. It's in McCabe.
Speigelman is not a mouse in real life. He looks and
acts about like I imagined, an aging hipster type with long
hair balding on top and a hint of the classic New York
accent. He cracked endearing jokes, smoked numerous cigarettes and had entertaining difficulties operating his
PowerPoint presentation. And he talked about comics with
a passion I wish I could channel here.
Comics, said Speigelman, are "the art of dense juxtaposition." Comic artists place words next to pictures, and pictures next to other pictures, and BAM, or POW
all of a
sudden it's a story. One panel Charlie Brown's running to
kick the football, the next he's in the air, and we know
what happened in between. Ouch! Poor Charlie Brown!
That nasty Lucy! Comics are just what that sounds like;
stories, in a natural form for telling stories. They can have
themes, excitement, character development, explosions
and everything else you expect from a piece of literature

14

and/or good

entertainment. Which is exactly what they
are, goddamnit.
This probably doesn't offend you as much as it might
have 20 years ago. If you're a Swattie, you probably have a

friend who's into Chris Ware ("Acme Novelty Library"
again, I refer to McCabe) or something similar. So I'm not
going to do the whole "comics as art" spiel more than I just
did. And I also want to point out the obvious, which is that
most comics are pretty lousy. No one will deny this. Ninety
percent of the output of Marvel Comics and DC Comics

(the people who make all those superhero comics you
either read when you were a kid or know from the movie
versions) is derivative garbage.
This is true of all mainstream entertainment, more or less, but even more so with
comics. Most are designed for socially limited 12-year-old boys, and there are better
things designed for socially limited 12-yearold boys, like the Insane Clown Posse. But
that doesn't mean the good stuff isn't there.
Neither kind of comics, good and artsy or
good fun, is easy to find in the morass of
crappy comics about giant-breasted women
fighting robots with killer lasers. With that
in mind, I'm going to do something I don't

feel terribly qualified to do but that someone had to at this point: I'm going to recommend some comics. These are personal
favorites. Many, but not all, of these are in
McCabe. Here goes:

and other historically accurate individuals. The Johnny
Depp vehicle of the same name is a pathetic imitation
this is the real deal. The appendix alone is like a novel in
itself.
"Bone," by Jeff Smith. Published by
Cartoon Books. This may be my favorite
comic of all time since middle school. This is
at once the epic Tolkien-esque story of good at
war with the forces of evil, a funny animal
comic, a children's comic, a romance and so
many other things it boggles the mind. It follows three cousins, Fone Bone (the hero),

JONAH GOLD

Phoney Bone (the greedy one) and Smiley
Bone (the happy one), on their adventures
away from their home in Boneville. Smith
manages to create entertainment that is "for
the whole family" in a real sense, i.e., that
adults will like as much as children. It's
but not saccharine, engaging but
ot simplistic, and completely beautiful.

Where Eagles Dare

"Ghost World," by Daniel Clowes.
Published by Fantagraphics Books. You may know this as
a movie, but, following the principle of adaptations, the
comic book is better. It's a funny but mostly gut-twistingly
sad tale of two teenagedbest friends growing apart in posthigh school wasteland. The art's detached style only adds
to the alienation of the storyline, which rings far too close
to home for me to read comfortably.

April 17, 2003

"From Hell," by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.
Published by Eddie Campbell Comics. This is one to steer
clear of if you're looking for light entertainment, but,
damn, is it impressive. In what may be the best-researched
comic book ever, freaky British writer Alan Moore dissects the Jack the Ripper murders in a dark Victorian
London populated by Freemasons, freaks, conspirators

That's just a starting point. As I've said,
there's more. So go to it. Remember, comics
are easier and faster to read than "real books"
and thus ideal for supplanting your thick and ugly poststructuralist seminar reading. The good ones are acres
better than Rolling Stone. And many such are in the
library, free to read. What are you waiting for? Read a
comic book today!

Enjoy the sun.
Outdoor activities abound during

Graffiti vandals undermine own movement
Dear Editor:
I write this letter in response to the anti-war graffiti
which now graces the walls of the tunnel leading to the
train stop and the advertising boards next to the track.
In my opinion, this may be one of the most useless and
destructive ways of protesting a war. I question the
nature, the target audience and the overall utility of this
display.
First, let me address the technique of spray-painting.
Congratulations, you fiendish devils, you have illegally
vandalized someone else's property. SEPTA will have to
absorb the cost for cleaning the walls and advertising
boards. The vandals even had the gall to deface an advertisement advocating AIDS awareness. They are culpable

of a crime and should be held accountable.
Second, I can't help but ridicule the pragmatism of

vandalizing a space for which the effective target audience is the Swarthmore student body. If, as I believe,
Swarthmore students were responsible, they should
know that there are numerous other legal and effective
ways to communicate their sentiments.
Third, I would like to point out that the vandals have
effectively detracted from the credibility and momentum
of the anti-war movement. This act of mindless vandalism is an insult to all those thoughtful individuals who
have built a strong, rational case against the war (including, yes, conservatives). Furthermore, you most probably cemented the opinions of many rightists who tend to
dismiss the anti-war movement due to its lack of content

and lack of direction.
Let me move on to the frightfully inane commentary.
It ranges from the more coherent "THIS WAR IS

"NEW FOREIGN POLICY PLEASE" to my
favorites, "BUSH=NO PENIS" and "F— $." And how
could I forget the insightful "BUSH=SADDAM"? Last
time I checked, President Bush was the head of a democratic country, had never used chemical weapons on his
citizens, and had the support of the majority of his country. If you are so entrenched in the anti-war movement
and a perverted leftist dogma that you actually believe in
crude, simplistic reductions like the Bush-Saddam comparison, I suggest you open your eyes. The world is not
as simple as you would like to believe.
The vandals wrote that "WE WON'T STOP UNTIL
THE WAR DOES." I suggest you do everyone a favor and
adopt a more constructive tactic. This display is a disgrace to the anti-war movement.

Free speech under
fire at Pipes event
Freedom of speech is an integral part of America. The ability to challenge and criticize freely that with which one does not agree is perhaps
our most fundamental value. There is a threshold, however, beyond
which certain individuals are willing to bastardize this value in such a
way that they actually hinderthe rights of others to free speech. This was
the case at Swarthmore last week surrounding a lecture by scholar and
Middle East expert Dr. Daniel Pipes. The events that transpired prior to,
during and after this lecture were indicative of a heinous attitude that
lurks among us. They were acts of intolerance and oppression. They
were fundamentally anti-American and anti-academic. They were intimidation of ideas to a degree that would surely draw anger and protest if
directed toward a more typical Swarthmore lecturer.
The most despicable way to repress free speech is to do so anonymously. In the days prior to Pipes' lecture on "The Palestinian-Israeli
War," signs advertising the event were coated with glue and covered with
new signs that were intended to smear the event as anti-Muslim, to confuse people as to the correct time and location, and to generally discourage attendance of a lecture that the hangers of these signs felt would be
offensive. While public criticism and challenging of this event would have been well

within these scoundrels' rights,

they

forfeit-

ed any credibility by obstructing the sponsors of this event, Students for Truthful
Israel Representation (STIR), from advertising to the community at large. For the
record, I am a co-president of STIR.
This act is more than innocent protest.

Though

inflammatory style.

would commit such a deed are blatantly
rejecting the liberal values that they
undoubtedly purport to defend. They
desired to silence Pipes rather than listen to
what he had to say. This is distinctly antiacademic and anti-Swarthmore.

Pipes was asked to speak on the
Palestinian-Israeli war specifically because
of his academic, professional and nonHis lecture was calm and scholarly and intended to

put forth his theories without becoming entangled in the morality of the
region's near-daily violence. In what has become typical of the treatment
of conservative speakers at Swarthmore, student audience members
attempted to draw Pipes into emotional topics with fuU knowledge of his
refusal to discuss the individual acts of violence that he believed were
symptoms of the larger conflict rather than its cause. A particularly contemptible instance of this occurred when a student, after identifying
himself as Palestinian, voiced a long and provocative criticism of Israel
that ended with an inconsequential question along the lines of "Wouldn't
you agree?" Pipes, realizing the futility of such an argument, attempted
to move on to another question, but he was interrupted three times by
this student's rude outbursts. At that point, Jeffrey Rogg 'O5, a member
of STIR, approached him and told him to respect Pipes' refusal to answer
the question or leave. As it was STIR's responsibility to ensure a smooth
and productive event, Rogg was fully justified in peacefully asking the
student to contain his disrespectful behavior. Pipes later approved of this
action, noting that the Palestinian student had sought to elicit hostility
in a lecture that was intentionally non-confrontational on an issue
around which confrontation often runs rampant.
The final act was committed not by a student but by Allison Dorsey,
an associate professor of history. At the reception following the lecture,
"Professor Dorsey approached Rogg, shook his hand, smiled, asked him
for his name, and then proceeded to berate him for his actions. At no
point did she introduce herself. When she concluded her diatribe, she
turned her attention away from Rogg and chose to ignore rather than
engage him. For a student to do this would have been condemnable. For
a professor to do this is simply unforgivable. Whereas a civil discussion
of Rogg's actions would have been acceptable, Professor Dorsey's
approach obstructed rather than encouraged dialogue. To the portion of
the Swarthmore community that has similarly criticized Rogg's actions,
I ask if that criticism would be muted if it had not been a conservative
Jewish student asking a rude Palestinian to respect the rights of others
to enjoy the lecture. I suspect it would be.
Essential to the very essence of liberal academia is the freedom to
speak and to be heard. At Swarthmore, there exists a core that would
deny that freedom to the community at large. When Pipes did not deliver the inflammatory lecture that these individuals desired, they tried to
forcefully extract it from him. Contrary to their behavior, Pipes
remained calm and rational. Those who attempted to discredit this event
before, while and after it occurred committed academic hypocrisy of
great magnitude. If they came to Swarthmore expecting this self-indulgent behavior to go unnoticed, they were sadly mistaken.

editor

Students must allow each other to speak
Dear Editor:
This letter is in response to the message left on
my voicemail by Randy Goldstein 'O5. Goldstein
introduced himself as one of the co-presidents of
Students for a Truthful Israel Representation
(STIR) and a columnist for The Phoenix. He
informed me that he was writing a column for the
April 17 issue (see left) in which he planned to
address the events surrounding the lecture by Dr.
Daniel Pipes, a paragraph of which would be devoted to "your confrontation with Jeff Rogg at the
reception after the lecture." Mr. Goldstein noted
that he would express his opinion that he expected
a college professor to "approach the situation in a

more productive fashion."
I want to thank Goldstein for the "heads up" on
his column. I appreciate his interpretation of the
events following the lecture. It must be said, however, that I do not share his interpretation.
"Confrontation," similar to the expression "heated
argument," which appeared in last week's report
on the lecture, is not how I would characterize the
events. I did question Rogg and tried to engage him

in conversation. It is my interpretation that Rogg
became agitated once he understood that I had
approached him to express dismay at his behavior.
He persisted in expressing his opinion, which of
course he has every right to do, that he believed my
disagreement with his behavior was "attacking
him." When another student stepped between Rogg

and myself and chose to engage me in conversation, I simply stopped trying to speak to Rogg. I
also had conversations in response to several other
students, Matthew Meltzer 'O6 and Arthur Chu 'O6
among them, all of whom disagreed with either my
speaking to Rogg or my point of view. My point'of
view was and remains
Swarthmore students do
not menace each other into silence when they disagree.
I would also note that while Goldstein is perfectly within his rights to express his opinion that
my decision to express my amazed disapproval of
Rogg's behavior was not "productive," I am also
within my right to disagree. I do not understand
disagreement, even strenuous disagreement, to be
"unproductive." More important, I do believe that
old adage "He who is silent is understood to consent." I was stunned by Rogg's actions. I believed
his actions to be "un-Swarthmorean," in the
extreme. I chose to address what I saw as an inappropriate- behavior, lest students assume by my
silence that I accepted or approved of such behavior. Both my understanding of pedagogy and my
own sense of integrity demanded that I speak.
In closing, again, let me thank Goldstein for his
honest expression of his interpretation of events.
Indeed his phone message encouraged me to offer
my final words of this event.
Dr. Allison Dorsey
Associate Professor of History

Pipes should answer student questions
Dear Editor:
The response to Daniel Pipes' lecture
("Vehement reaction marks pro-Israel talk," April
10, pg. 3) has missed the point. Pipes made significant suggestions as to what Israel and the United
States must do to resolve the conflict or "war"
with Palestine. However, he claimed that he was
making these suggestions without any basis in
either morality or policy analysis. When asked to
clarify his position, he refused to discuss either
its moral or political implications
implications
he called "details."
Oddly enough, Pipes based his argument on a
moral assumption
the assumption that the state
of Israel should exist. In fact, this is an assumption
that I share, but it shows a fundamental flaw in his
argument that he felt he could make implicit
moral judgments but did not aUow issues of morality to enter the debate when he was afraid that he

wouldn't be able to address them.
More specifically, the fact that he was not able
,to answer the question of Saed Atshan 'O6 indicated major holes in his argument. Atshan asked
why Pipes was using words that hide the unpleas-

ant realities of the situation, such as calling the
situation a "war" and calling Israeli settlements
in Palestinian territories "villages." Pipes was
trying to steer the conversation away from

instances of immoral Israeli action because he
was unable to account for it in his plan to wait
until the Palestinians had a "change of heart"
before going forward with any sort of negotia-

tions.
In fact, Pipes was so afraid of having to answer
Atshan's question that he had to silence him.
Whatever your views on the issue at hand, the
fact that Pipes felt he had to raise his voice, verbally attack a student one-third his age and then

delegate another student as a bouncer demonstrates both a complete lack of respect and also a

lack of desire for any real discourse.
If we are going to promote intellectual diversity at Swarthmore, people should not accuse everyone who brings up valid arguments against their
point of hate-mongering. Atshan's point was valuable, and silencing him, especially in such a crude
manner, did nothing to further the discussion.

Anti-Muslim lecturer a threat to society
Dear Editor:
The harm Dr. Daniel Pipes
poses to American society is
much deeper than his views on
Israel ("Vehement

differing views on the PalestineIsrael issue, and it is not one
that can be solved with these
few "dialogues." My concern
with Pipes is his utter disregard
for the safety and well-being of
United States citizens and his
willingness to encourage hatred

toward Muslims around the
slandering
world. Besides
numerous individuals using falsified information
such as his
claims that professors call Jews
"baby-killers" because of their
views of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict and that colleges includ-

Pipes intentionally uses the
fears that Americans face today
as a means to foster a hate

toward Muslims. Because of his
unwillingness to use facts, his
articles are rarely found in anything other than tabloid-esque
journals such as the New York
Post. Reading his articles, which
can be found on campuswatch.org, danielpipes.org and
meforum.org, one gathers a
sense that to be Muslim or to
support anything. Islamic is
inherently anti-American and
terroristic. To merely teach
about Islam in colleges is antiAmerican. Further, he writes
that approximately 15 percent of
the world's Muslims are terrorists, though it seems clear from
his definitions that the majority

some way terroristic. Though
his beliefs are not uncommon, it

Movie debate
is total 'Bull'

op-art

by

annie

ronan

Dale Petroskey, the president of the Baseball Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., recently cancelled a 15thanniversary showing of "Bull Durham" because Tim
Robbins and Susan Sarandon, among others involved with
the movie, had made anti-war statements. Petroskey is,
among other things, a former PR flack for the Reagan
administration. And he is an idiot.
According to Petroskey, Robbins and Sarandon's "past
history" made him fear they would turn the showing of a
decade-and-a-half-old movie into a statement on war.
According to Petroskey, Ken Griffey Jr. was also a good
move for the Cincinnati Reds to make. According to
Petroskey, the band Limp Bizkit is "kickass" and "super
sweet." Mr. Petroskey, obviously, has problems discerning

reality.

This selfsame manager of free speech has invited Ari
Fleischer to Cooperstown in the past to speak. (Fleischer is
the current press secretary for the White House, and he is
skin-crawlingly deceitful in the role). Why is it OK to have
a Republican flack with a grand stage speak at the Hall of
Fame but not liberal actors
who are in the movie
you're showing? Well,.first,
you have to act as if you
have no brain. In a publicly released statement,

would attempt to politicize
the event, and, anyway,
how do you comment on
the Iraqi war through "Bull
Durham"? Even the most
postmodern schmo here

would have a hard time turning Tim Robbins wearing
women's underwear into a rebuke of the Bush administration's policies.
Why would the president of the Baseball Hall of Fame
literally bully actors away from coming to an event, even
going so far as to cancel the event rather than having the
actors come and maybe, just maybe, having to talk to those
icky lefties? Well, there is the aforementioned crippling
stupidity, which played a large factor, I have to believe. I
have to think that even the most partisan conservative
could have engaged in this conversation:
TIM ROBBINS: "Hey, Tim Robbins here."
CONSERVATIVE FELLOW: "Mr. Robbins? I'm calling
from the Hall ofFame and just wanted to run something by
you. Can you and Ms. Sarandon not politicize the 'Bull
Durham' anniversary later this month?"
sure! We weren't planning on it,
TIM ROBBINS: "Urn
actually. It's a movie about minor-league baseball. You
know that, right?"
CONSERVATIVE FELLOW: "Yeah, yeah. I'm no Dale
Petroskey."
(Wild, raucous laughter ensues. The phones are hung
up, and both ponder what it must be like to be Dale
Petroskey. Sad, they decide. Sad and lonely.)
This is not to say that Petroskey is alone in this ridiculousness. The people who put posters over the Daniel Pipes
advertisements are just as guilty of this sort of ideological
bullying, and it has just as little place here as it does at the
Baseball Hall of Fame. The same attitude is running rampant across the country. At Yale, in a span of two days,
anti-war students were assaulted, insulted, harassed and
terrorized by pro-war Yale students for no reason other
than what they believed. A National Guardsman was spit
on and harassed by anti-war protestors in Washington,
...

D.C.

Regardless of what you think of this war (I was and still
am against it, not out of purpose but out of principle) or of
your ideological opponents, we must realize one thing. In
America, we're supposed to know what freedom means,
more so than anyone else on Earth. To consciously work
against that principle is unfathomable, yet we manage to

do it anyway. Just stop it.

War coverage hides other events
Iraq, Iraq, Iraq. The reasons I'm thrilled by the recent
announcement that the end is in sight are manifold, but
not the least of them is the invigorating notion that I will
finally be able to open my paper, turn on my television and
visit cnn.com without encountering the same tired pro- or

anti-war editorials or the latest update on the number of

Iraqi men who have kissed some hulking marine, grateful
for his gun-toting role in their tyrant's topple. I can't stand
to talk about Iraq, not because I'm apathetic, but because
I'm bored to tears. It's time for something new, time for our
focus to broaden, time for us to remember that there are

of a new government headed by a highly hopeful chief minister, hasn't changed a whole lot. The economy's still stagnant, violent militancy's still rampant, citizens still struggle to feel secure in their daily lives. But Saddam won't be
in power. And that's security enough for everyone.
Half the world continues to live in abject poverty, and
things are far from fabulous on the home front. Kids go to
schools in our own developed country in which books are
decades old and missing pages. Children die or disappear
every minute because our foster care system is overwhelmingly inadequate. People stab bouncers because
they can't have a freaking cigarette inside a club in New
York. Our children are still taking big guns to school and
spraying streams of bullets at each other. Our government
has placed an outrageously low limit on the number of
acres of unused land that must be preserved, and our own
unemployment rate is soaring. Still, it's all about Iraq.

attended to before have only gotten worse during our Iraqobsessed hiatus? As the war on Iraq winds down, I will relish the waves of ecstasy spawned as our nation collectively returns from the Middle East to plug back into the persistent glitches in our backyards and the raging crises
worldwide to give currently back-burner issues the atten-

tion they deserve.
We might even get the chance, in the midst ofreawakening our global awareness, to actually celebrate such
major milestones as the long-awaited completion of the
human genome or the fact that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has just improved its E. coli tracking technique and promises to recall a lot less beef and kill a loi
fewer American meat-eaters.

Castro stays
in the news

letter

to

the

editor

As the Bush administration wages war on Iraq and possibly nearby Middle Eastern neighbors, 76-year-old Fidel Castro
has refused to be excluded from breaking-news headlines. He
recently arrested 30 dissidents and human rights activists in
Cuba and accused them of conspiring with the United States
to undermine his government. This has created a great
amount of international outrage, which has led some (such as
those at the White House) to believe that the aging
Communist leader is exhibiting good, old-fashioned totalitarian dictator-like behavior, like Stalin during his last days. But
with the United States dismantling Iraq and God knows what
else, and the various United States-led coup attempts on
Castro's government and life over the years, perhaps Castro
has good reason to be worried about the possible undoing of
his already weakening government.
Fidel is surely being unreasonable. He has arrested
activists like Luis Enrique Ferrer, a local coordinator for the
Varela Project, which is a Cuban reform group and petition
campaign. Ferrer and other dissidents, such as opposition
leader Hector Palacios, the poet and writer Raul Rivero, economist Martha Beatriz Roque and independent journalist
Omar Rodriguez Saludes have
been sentenced to over 20
years in jail. Fifty other dissidents await sentences that
will be handed down from the

closed courts that the Cuban
government uses to administer these proceedings.

All

defendants have been accused
of treason.
Stephen Gibbs, a BBC correspondent in Havana, said

the sentences indicated the
most serious crackdown on

Soluz

domestic opposition in the
country since the 19605. And
Brian Alexander, director of

the Washington-based Cuba
Policy Foundation, which lobbies for an end to the U.S.
embargo on Cuba, said the
crackdown suggests Castro is no longer willing to tolerate
challenges to his unstable rule. Alexander suggested that
Castro would no longer pursue a charm offensive but that "we
can expect to see relations soured by harsher rhetoric and
Castro demonstrating a lack of interest in multilateral ties."
Alexander said it seemed a strange time to provoke
American antagonism, given that, despite the current
administration's dislike of the Cuban regime, the United
States Congress has been working to lift the embargo.
Although the international community is outraged at
Castro's seemingly Stalinist tactics, it seems that U.S.-Cuban
relations of the last 40 years have given Castro plenty of reasons to be paranoid.
In February 196 L Castro explained for the first time that
he was building socialism in Cuba. Shortly thereafter, the
CIA made another attempt to assassinate Prime Minister
Castro, this time poisoning Castro's favorite Cuban cigars
with botulism, a toxin so potent that its fumes are strong
enough to kill. Then, Col. Sheffield Edwards of the CIA delivered capsules containing the same toxin to his mafia contact
Roselli to have them sent to Castro. Both attempts failed.
Later, in April 196 L the United States launched its disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion, which sent 1,300 CIA-trained Cuban
exiles to the island. Their defeatafter three days ofbattle was
a huge embarrassment for President John F. Kennedy. Then
came various madcap assassination schemes. President
Castro has survived 40 years of sanctions, which the United
States is refusing to lift, and various attempts on his life.
President Bush's "deep concern" for Castro's "heavy-handed"
tactics is understandable, and perhaps so is Castro's concern
for his Cuban Revolution.

Although it seems that Cuba is not the only country worried about aggressive U.S. schemes, this time Castro may
have gone too far. His recent actions show him to be more of
an oppressive dictator than a revolutionary, and his lack of
tolerance for dissidents to his regime smells of totalitarian
terror that tends to plague authoritarian regimes. Although
the United States' economic and diplomatic embargo has
made the Cuban revolution incredibly difficult, seeking
revenge by silencing innocent activists is not the answer.

Parrish music too loud too long
Dear Editor:
We understand that the weather's
been nice lately and people want to
bring their music outdoors with
them. However, for people living and
working in the Parrish dorms and
offices, it has become increasingly
difficult to do constructive (or even
not so constructive) things in the
afternoon because music is being
blasted so loudly on the beach. It can
be heard distinctly anywhere in
Parrish near a window, even on the
far side of the building, usually for

the entire afternoon. We no longer
have the alternative of going out to
the beach to work, because that's
exactly where the disturbance is
coming from. We've tried closing
windows (torturous in this weather),
turning up our own music (which
doesn't make working any easier),
asking the DJs to turn it down (at
best a temporary reprieve, though
they've all been very polite thus far),

this matter, and we're not the only
ones who are concerned. We don't

want to ruin people's fun, but we desperately need some quiet time. We
wouldn't make this a public complaint except that we don't know to

whom we should address our concerns. Would it be possible to at least
limit the music playing to a more
reasonable duration?Feel free to con-

tact us to discuss this issue.

and asking the administration whom
to contact (they don't know, either).
We've talked to other people about

Pipes controversy overblown
BY ARTHUR CHU
achul@swarthmore.edu

I don'tblame anyone in particular for the recent incident at Daniel Pipes' recent lecture. (See "Vehement reaction marks pro-Israel event, April 10, pg. 3). Dr. Pipes was,
I think, very patient with a fairly hostile crowd, and did
a good job of presenting a position that many
Swarthmore students disagree with in a civil fashion.
Saed Atshan 'O6, who grew up in Palestine, legitimately
felt more strongly about this issue than others because of
his personal attachment; Pipes let him speak, but decided
the emotions were running to high for him to legitimate-

ly respond.

Atshan, unfortunately, chose not to let it go and to
interrupt. At that point, there should have been a neutral
moderator present to speak to him, ask him to calm down
and promise to address his questions afterwards.
Unfortunately, as Randy Goldstein 'O5 said afterwards,
no professor was available whom the organizers thought
could function as such (See column, pg. 18). This is where
the fault, I think, lay. Rogg, because of his emotional
attachment to the situation, his reputation and his physical demeanor, was a poor choice to perform any sort of
moderating function.
Even so, the point at which I think the situation was
inflated out of proportion was when history professor
Allison Dorsey decided to address Rogg personally after
April 17, 2003

the lecture.

She was well within her rights to do so, but I feel her
comments unnecessarily dramatized the situation by
using language like "physically silencing a student."
First, Rogg was simply doing his job by asking Atshan to
follow the rules of the lecture; yes, he should be more
aware ofhis body language and tone, but to ascribe a violent intention to him because of that is unfair and untrue.
More importantly, I disagree that there is anything
inherently oppressive in a student group holding an
event and having certain rules about conduct at the
event, particularly rules I think of as natural and commonplace elsewhere. Disruptive speakers should either
defer to the lecturer or else be asked to leave to carry on
their discussions in private.
That the counterposition is being so widely defended
bothers me. I do not agree that "free speech" implies that
anyone who wishes to can hijack and determine the tone
of a lecture, leaving no recourse for the event's organizers but to be shouted down.
I think it's time we realized that this sort of attitude
is why people in the real world find the core of
Swarthmore's aggressive progressive culture annoying
and don't listen to us. If we were to teach and enforce
rules of etiquette, civility and respect for our political
opponents as much as we encouraged the opposing
virtues of self-confidence and activism, we would be
much better served.

Track sets sights on Penn Relays, CC championships
Ntoso takes second in 110-meter hurdles; Zagory finishes second in high jump
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
The 2003 Ursinus Invitational last Sunday saw the
Garnet Tide outdoor track and field teams take on a slew
of local college track programs, ranging from Division I
La Salle University to Centennial Conference rival
Franklin and Marshall. The Garnet endured another day
of relatively poor weather conditions, competing against
not only the other athletes but the cold and wind yet
again, in preparation for the bigger Penn Relays and
Centennial Conference Championships.
Jessica Zagory 'O5 led the Garnet women in the field
events with a second place finish in the women's high
jump, soaring to a height of 4'B". Robin Dawson 'O6 finished close behind at sixth with a jump of 4'6".
"Staying focused through the wind and cold temperatures was what allowed Robin and I to jump better than
the competition," Zagory explained. "I've been dealing
with a meniscus tear in my jumping leg, and the colder
conditions make it difficult for me to perform well.
Ursinus also doesn't have an ideal high jump approach
area- it's considerably smaller than many other tracks,
so I had to adjust to running through a section of grass."
"This season has been satisfying in terms of my consistency, but it's frustrating to not be able to break
through the plateau and establish myself as one of the top
jumpers in the conference. Njideka [Akunyili 'o4] was
also feeling the same frustration having gone four weeks
without breaking the minute mark in the 400, but she
finally accomplished that during our 4x400 relay on
Sunday. It's really exciting and builds confidence going
into the Penn Relays next week. Furthermore, watching
Nji catch the entire field during her leg was reminiscent

of Imo [Akpan 'o2] and inspired both Sarah Hobbs ['o6]
and I to finish off a strong team performance."
Rounding out the field event highlights, Sarah Kate
Selling 'O3 finished fourth in the pole-vaulting event,
reaching a height of B'6".
"I've had a number of really good vaulting practices in
the past few weeks that have helped my confidence in the
vault," Selling said. "I've been pleased with this season so
far, and I'm hoping to improve even more. My goals for
the rest of the season are to clear 9' and maybe 9'6" and
hopefully place in the top five at the conference meet."
"The team has been pulling out a lot of strong performances. It's been great to see so many people doing
well, especially since we've encountered unpleasant
weather at some our meets," she said. "The next few
meets should be exciting as we encounter better weather
and good competition."
In the track events, Akunyili finished third in the 400meter run in 60.53 seconds to pace the Garnet women.
Britta Ingebretson 'O5 led the Garnet in the 5000-meter
run, finishing fourth in 20:24.80. Harrier Emily Wistar 'O6
finished fourth in a cool 5:11.33.
"I have been really proud of my teammates this season, and I feel like our hard work has been paying off,"
Wistar said. "Most of us have been rewarded with faster
times and better races. I am looking forward to the next
few meets, because I think that we will continue to
improve as the season winds down."
Krista Gigone 'O4 followed Wistar, finishing eighth in
5:30.36, while Hobbs ran to a ninth-place finish in the
women's 800-meter run, finishing with a time of 2:33.59. The
women's 4x400-meter relay A team finished fourth in 4:25.57.
In the men's 110-meter high hurdles event, Kwaku
Ntoso 'O3 led the Garnet with a second place finish in

16.20 seconds. Ntoso also finished fifth in the 400-meter
high hurdles event in 61.23 seconds.
"Personally, I did not feel like I ran that well this past
weekend," Ntoso said. "This was only my second meet
this season and I feel that I have a lot to work on before
Penn Relays and Conferences."
"I think that the team is progressing, but there is still
plenty of work cut out for us. The distance guys are running very well and they should be able to score a lot of
points at conferences this year," he said. "We just need to

get better every week."
In the field events, Brian Hwang 'O5 led the Garnet
men, placing third in the triple jump with a jump of 12.20
meters and eighth in the long jump with a jump of 17'9.5".
Rob Melick 'O3 threw to a fifth place finish in the men's
shotput, reaching 12.82 meters with his best throw of the

day.

Out of a field of 27 runners, James Golden 'O5 finished
fourth in the 800-meter run with a speedy time of 1:59.67.
Harrier teammate Garret Ash 'O5 finished close behind,
placing eighth in 2:02.42. Adam Hunt 'O6 finished 12th in
2:04.45. The men's 4x400-meter relay A team finished
third in 3:40.07.
In the men's 5000-meter run, Keefe Keeley 'O6 finished
fifth in 16:48.61. In the men's 400-meter dash, Kier
Wachterhauser 'O4 finished eighth in 53.37 seconds. In the
200-meter dash, Tyler Lyson 'O6 led the Garnet with a 12th
place finish in 24.67 seconds. Matt Steele 'O3 paced the
men's team in the 100-meter dash, finishing 13th in 12:46
seconds.
The Garnet head to Widener University next Saturday,
April 19 to compete in the Widener Invitational in the last
preparatory meet before the much-anticipated Penn
Relays and Centennial Conference Championships.

Tide tame Mules but fall to Diplomats
BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore.edu
Sometimes, hard work and determination get the job done. Sometimes, no matter
what you do, it just isn't enough. The
Garnet men's lacrosse team worked hard
last week, determined to walk away with at
least one victory. On Saturday, the Tide
battled
ninth-ranked Franklin and
Marshall but lost 13-3. However, earlier in
the week, their efforts paid off when they
defeated
challenger
conference
Muhlenberg by a score of 7-2. With two conference games left in the season, the Garnet
are now 7-5 overall and 3-3 in the conference.
Family members filled the stands
around Clothier Field last Saturday during
parents' weekend. With theirresolved leadership, the young team was able to hold
nationally ranked F&M to a two-goal
advantage in the first half.
"We were in pretty good shape at halftime, only down two goals to a very good
team," Chris Murphy 'O4 said. Swat battled
the Diplomats for 30 minutes, trailing only
3-1 at intermission, but things took a turn
for the worse as the Diplomats found a new
burst of energy. They outscored the Garnet
10-2 in the second half to end the day with a
win. "Our zone defense was doing well, but,
in the second half, they began to figure the
zone out and started pouring in the goals,"

Murphy said.
After the Diplomats scored three goals
in the first quarter, Joe DeSimone 'O4 took
charge at the start of the second, scoring a
man-advantage goal to put the Garnet Tide
on the board. F&M tore up the third quarter, scoring three goals in a short span of
1:04. With three minutes remaining, the
Diplomats had a 7-1 advantage. Senior
John Murphy scored one minute later to
get the Tide to within five. Chris Wathey,
for the F&M offense, hit the back of the net
with a minute left to close out the third
quarter scoring.

The Garnet Tide split their two matches last week. After beating Muhlenberg 7-2, they fell to ninth-ranked Franklin
Matthew Perez 'O6 scored his first
career goal for the Tide at 12:11, getting the
Garnet to within 9-3. "Matt Perez stepped
in for me and played pretty well," said Paul
Chung 'O5, who is out for the rest of the season with a broken ankle.
In the last quarter, "F&M kept attacking
and we couldn't contain them," Chung
said. The Diplomats added four more goals
to make the final 13-3. In goal for the
Garnet, Ryan Croken 'O5 rejected 13 F&M
balls by the end of the day.
Earlier in the week, the Garnet tamed
the Mules with a conference victory. John
Murphy rode the Mules, scoring a game-

high three goals to contribute to the 7-6
win. "We got a little complacent after we
were up 7-2, and they capitalized by making the game closer than it should have
been. But it was a good win for us
and Muhlenberg has some good young
players," Chris Murphy said.
In the first quarter, Muhlenberg jumped
out to a 2-0 lead. John Murphy picked up
his first with 2:24 left in the quarter to cut
the lead in half. He tied the game two minutes into the second and DeSimone scored
at 8:44 to give the Garnet a 3-2 halftime
lead. Court scored unassisted at 13:49 and
John Cleaver 'O4 made it 5-2 as the Garnet

Baseball rolls in offensive clinic
From BASEBALL, pg. 24
Jody Fisher 'O5 contributed three RBIs on 2-for-6 hitting, and center fielder Brandon King 'O5 added
three more RBIs on 3-for-7 hitting. Only Ryan
Chahrour 'O4, who entered the game in the top of
the ninth as a pinch hitter, failed to contribute a hit
to the Garnet's offensive juggernaut. Overall,
Swarthmore scored 22 runs on 20 hits despite leaving 13 on base.
The Garnet got off to a slow start, failing to net
any runs in the first inning. In the third inning,
however, Swarthmore got going, when shortstop
Wes Sconce hit a one-out single up the middle and
Schlossman drove him home with a monster tworun homer. The blast gave Swarthmore a two-run
advantage and, according to Goldstein, some much
needed momentum. "It was orgasmic. It just felt
good to break out of my slump and get my swing

back on track," Schlossman said.
Despite generating so much offensive power,
Swarthmore did fall behind early, as Washington
scored two runs in the second and added another in
the third to take a 3-2 lead. But an explosive fiverun effort in the top of the fifth put the Garnet up
for good. Swarthmore added an additional four

runs in the next two innings, and a combined 11
runs in the final two frames put the game more
than out of reach.
The win was only the second Centennial
Conference victory of the year for the squad, but
the team's record does not necessarily reflect its
performance. As Goldstein indicated, "There have

22

been five games where we've been winning going
into the final inning of the game. If you take those
five games, and calculate our record if we had won
those five, and we'd be .500 in the conference right

now."
The squad lost leads to conference opponents
Johns Hopkins, Muhlenberg, McDaniel, and
Gettysburg in the final innings of play, as well as
another game to a non-conference opponent earlier
in the year.
Swarthmore has also been short-handed
throughout the year, a problem which has given
the team many fits. "It's been tough," Goldstein
said. "We only have 15 guys and a pitching staff of
just about five."
However, Goldstein thinks that the team can use
the Washington win as a springboard. "We've got
some games we can win coming into the last part of
the season. Our performance against Washington
last game has people motivated and excited."
Next up for the Garnet is a home game against
Washington, Friday at 3:30.

Brawl interrupts win
Swarthmore's 22-13 win couldn't be entirely perfect. A scuffle broke out between the two teams
when Davis and the Washington second-baseman
got into a tiff following a Davis slide into second.
The 35-man Washington team converged on Davis,
and Swarthmore then emptied its 10-man bench. "It
was a memorable game," Schlossman said,
"because those things don't really happen that
often."

Tennis climbs rankings
BY DERRICK WU

It was another good week for the women's team. The Tide defeated Bryn Mawr and Johns Hopkins without dropping a single match,
bolstering their Centennial Conference record to 8-0. They also
jumped 12 spots in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA)
rankings to become the 17th-ranked Division 111 team in the nation.
The Tide's greatest threat last week was complacency, easily
defeating Johns Hopkins 9-0 last Sunday and Bryn Mawr 9-0 last
Thursday. Head coach Jeremy Loomis said, "Against Bryn Mawr
and Johns Hopkins, I thought we did a good job of staying focused.
It can be easy to relax, especially since it's just about the end of the

season."
The easy victory over Johns Hopkins was payback for last season's loss. "Not giving up a point against Hopkins was particularly
impressive since we didn't have Anjani playing that day and last
year we lost to them. Our depth really showed that day,' Loomis
said. Emily Townsend 'O6 added, "Our match against JHU was exciting because they're one of the tougher teams in the conference and
everyone played really well to blank them 9-0."
Lopsided CC victories have been the Garnet's signature all season long. Thus far, they have outscored their CC opponents 65-7, and
teams outside the CC have noticed the Tide's success. The April 14
ITA rankings have Swarthmore ranked 17th in the nationand fourth
in the Atlantic South region. "We play like we study, which is why
we're fourth in the region," Sonali Shahi 'O6 said.
Besides the team's hard work ethic, there have been many reasons for the Tide's wave of success this season. One important factor has been the outstanding play of first-years. "We owe a lot of that
to freshmen like Emily Townsend and Elli Suzuki," Sonia Vallabh
'O6

said.

Kahn's offense can't lift Garnet Some gripes
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore women's lacrosse team dropped
two games to Muhlenberg and Stevens Technical
Institute, 16-4 and 13-4, last week. Junior attacker
Jackie Kahn 'O4 scored a total of six goals in the two

losses.

The Garnet arrived in Allentown, Pa., on April 12,
their 11th straight win over the
Muhlenberg. The Mules jumped out to a 9-1 lead in the
first half, frustrating Swarthmore efforts. Instead of
hanging their heads, the women gathered their
strength and encouraged each other to keep fighting
for the remainder of the game. "Motivation is never
really a problem with Swarthmore athletic teams,"
midfielder Katie Cloonan 'O3 said. "More often, we
have to work at relaxing and playing our game instead
of reacting to our opponents."
Head coach Karen Borbee paid the team a big comhoping to produce

pliment. "This team never quits," she said. "They went
out in the second half and played even harder than the
first." Although it was too late to catch up to the
Mules, Swarthmore fought until the horn sounded, tallying three more goals to their total. Kahn finished the
competition with all four goals of the team's goals. On
defense, goaltender Sam Uslan 'O3 stopped 15
Muhlenberg attempts. For the Mules, Lynsey Caldwell
tied her own school record for assists in a season,
accumulating five during the game and bringing her
total assists for the season to 26.
Kahn, the team's leading scorer with 43 goals in 13
games, earned a spot on the Centennial Conference
Honor Roll this week. "As the only returner on offense,
Jackie has been the player the opposing team has
keyed on," Borbee said. "I think it will make her an
even more effective player in the future."
On the opposite end of the field, Uslan has come
through for the team in many tense situations. "Sam is
an amazing goalie with great team sense and confidence," Cloonan said.
"Sam has really come through for us. There have
been games where Sam has played exceptionally,"
Borbee added.
The team, however, does not consist of these players alone. Much of the Swarthmore offense has also

come through first-years Heidi Fieselmann 'O6,
Christina Vu 'O6, Chloe Lewis 'O6 and Niamh Shortt 'O6
as well as Ele Forbes 'O5. Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3,
Catherine Salussolia 'O4 and Cara Tigue 'O6 are stalwarts in backfield for the Garnet.
On April 13, the Garnet looked to bounce back from
their Muhlenberg loss as they took on Stevens
Technical Institute (STI) in Hoboken, N.J. Kahn boosted the Garnet to a 1-0 lead 1:41 into the match, but STI
answered with three goals in a seven minute period.
Jamie Larson 'O5 cut the lead to one at 19:19. The Ducks
would not die, however. Stevens Tech's outstanding
attacker, Valerie Barnhart, netted three more goals in
route to her nine-goal performance. Swarthmore went

sided."
The second-half scoreboard did not read in the
Garnet's favor. STI connected on five shots and
increased its lead by nine. The efforts of Shortt and
Kahn, each of whom had a goal at the end of the game,
could not propel the Garnet to victory. Sam Uslan
recorded 21 saves for the Tide.
Teammate Anna Ruff 'O6 described Uslan's performance as "simply awesome." Ruff added, "Sam had

a ridiculously good game against STI. Some of her
saves were incredible."
The result of the game, however, was not at all
indicative of effort that the team put forth. "We played
a very solid first half," Borbee said. "Overall, we

played the best game, energy wise."

Ruff agreed with her coach. "We have never played
with that much heart before. It was amazing to see the
hustle and spirit of everyone," she said. "Mentally, we
were hyped up and ready to play."
Swarthmore dropped to 5-8 overall with a 1-5 record
in the conference. From here, Borbee wants to keep
the team on track with overall season goals. "We just
take it one game at a time and try to improve each
time we step on the field," she said. The women look
forward to their next game against Centenary.
"If we go in and play to our ability, we'll beat
Centenary," said Cloonan.

The Evil Buzzards notched their first win of the spring season on Saturday, swarming local rival
George Washington University 22-15. The Buzzards scored first on an Erik Munroe 'O4 try and never
looked back. Swarthmore led 12-5 at halftime and maintained a comfortable advantage throughout the
remainder of the game.
Munroe picked up a backwards drop and ran around the George Washington defense to score
Swarthmore's first try. Munroe was dominant with his speed, but a hard hit before halftime knocked him
out for the rest of the game with a concussion. Jeff Rogg 'O5 suffered a dislocated finger, the squad's
only other injury.
Also scoring for the Buzzards were "Crazy" Greg Nelson 'O4, Matt "Hippie" Block 'O5 and Brandon
Carver 'O4. Jon Fombonne 'O5 made a conversion to bring the Buzzards' total score to 22.
With the win, Swarthmore improved to 1-2 on the season, or 1-4 including games at the Penn Rugby
Tournament two weeks ago.
Saturday's scheduled game verus Bucknell has been canceled but may be rescheduled for a later date.

d. Uniforms
Does prewrap count as part of an athlete's uniform?
If yes, I am very dissatisfied. We should have garnet or

much hitting in baseball, anyway. Plus, I am sick and tired
of watching American League
pitchers throw at batters'
heads with impunity. Make
the pitchers swing a bat and
have fastballs whistle by their
ears. Then we will see just
how tough they are and just
how many batters they plunk.

Swarthmore students need

to start showing up to sporting
events. For some of you, sports
aren't your bag. Others of you just hate sports. But a vast
majority of you are either indifferent toward or enjoy athletics. So go out and support your fellow student. It will make
athletics here more enjoyable. It will cause Swarthmore athletes to support you at your next function, be it athletic, dramatic or
debatic. You might just have fun at a game, too.
Players need to give coaches a break. I do not want to hear
a player whine to the media when their coach leaves for
another school. Does it suck? Yes. But you know as a player
that, if your coach is any good, movement is always a possibility. And, by the way, coaches have no choice when a star
player declares early for the pros, and you do not see coaches
complaining about this in the media. So, players, suck it, up
and put on a happy face. It makes you look a whole lot better,
and you still get to go to college for free.
The last thing Doug Collins needed to do was bring up his
gripes about player relations in the press conference following Jordan's last home game. That night was about Jordan,
not you, Collins, so don't soil it by airing your dirty laundry.

Hockey sucks. That is all.
The NFL should lighten up. Charles Roger's urine sample
gets red flagged because it was diluted? I don't know if that
one is going to hold up in court. Um, maybe he was really

or maybe he had to throw back a few Evians in order
to go for the test.
In the world of the NBA: Stephon Marbury should have
made the Olympic team over Mike Bibby. I like Bibby as
much as the next guy, but after the year Marbury has had?
Come on. Tim Duncan should win the MVP award. Do not get
caught up in the Garnett hype. A greater level of improvement does not mean you deserve to be called most valuable.
Duncan is the most effective player in the league, on the best
team, surrounded by role players. It may be close this year,
thirsty,

but he deserves it.
I think Jeff Kent is delusional. He was quoted as saying
that he and Barry Bonds are like brothers. I didn't know
brothers told national magazines that the other is a cancer in
the clubhouse. Also, Kent speaks with a southern twang.
Hello, Jeff, you are from California.
Finally, it is about time Swarthmore offered cable in dorm
rooms. If a kid doesn't want to watch it, he doesn't have to.

Survey says...
It’s always fascinated me how much timeand thought the
Athletic Department puts into evaluating itself. Just yesterday, I filled out the annual participating student-athlete survey concerning my level of satisfaction with various aspects
of my athletic experience.
And while the concept of the
survey is a good one, some of
the questions are extremely
bizarre.

L How important to you

is your participation in
sports at Swarthmore?
Well, I spend over 24
hours per week participating
in sports (including

off-the

field activities), and while
perhaps that time could be
spent reading my brains out
in McCabe, we all know that
I just watch TV in the off-seaKATE NELSON-LEE
son. I think it’s pretty safe to
say that anyone enrolled at
Up in the Skybox
Swarthmore who takes the
time to play on a team here
considers sports important. Besides, it’s an excuse for not
doing all the seminar reading.

2. How would you characterize your experience participating in sports at Swarthmore?
Currently, my team’s warm-up tape is a power-hour mix.
I think my experience is definitely positive, though our
record might not reflect all of our team’s, um, hard work.

Yeah, that’s it. We work hard.
3. How did the opportunity to participate in intercollegiate sports affect your decision to attend
Swarthmore?
Playing time a good education good opportunity. This
seems to be the common thinking of most student athletes
here, though it seems everyone complains that they don’t
get enough of the former. It’s like all the econ majors in the
department have evaluated the opportunity-cost of riding
the bench. Here’s my thinking: If you’re on the sidelines,
then you are watching. If you were not on the team, you
would still be watching sports, though in the lounge and
with pizza. Pizza is good, but it costs money, which you
don’t have. Why not watch your friends play sports and get
meal money, which you can later use to pay for pizza when
watching more sports? If you play the entire game, you
might get tired and not stay awake while watching sports
later. Therefore, not playing the second half of the Bryn
Mawr game is, in actuality, a good thing.
4 Did your athletic performance improve over the
course of your participation in sports at Swarthmore?
When I was a freshman, I might have been as fast as half
the team. Now, as a senior, everyone’s faster than I am.
However, I think it’s quite safe to say that I have more
endurance, especially on Saturday nights, while it has been
+

=

rumored that a few'of those fast little frosh have to be taken
home before midnight. Don’t worry, little ladies, you’ll work
up that tolerance by the time you’re a jaded senior, too.
5. How satisfied are you with the following facilities/resources of the athletic program?
a. Playing Fields/Courts
I will save you from the “we have no dugouts, the Mullan
Center sucks, and our grass fields are horrible” mantra that
all student athletes feel they have to spout at least three
times a day. Did you know that we have squash courts? Did
you know that the lines haven’t been updated since the U.S.
switched over to international rules about, oh, five years ago?

the Green Terror. Swarthmore squad fell to Gettysburg on Sunday, but bounced back against Washington, 22-13.

Baseball dominates Washington
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
After losing several one- or two-run heartbreakers
over the past weeks, Swarthmore hit its stride on
Tuesday, pouring in 22 runs in an offensive clinic
against Centennial Conference rival Washington.
The Garnet did give up 13 runs on the day including a grand slam to James Barossi in the sixth inning
but hit the Washington pitching at will.
Swarthmore turned to the fourth starter in its rotation, Carlton Davis ’O4, to lead the club. Davis did exact-

ly what the team needed, limiting Washington’s run output to seven runs in the six innings he pitched. Davis
also locked up his first win of the season.
On the offensive side, Davis drove in three runs, but
it was first-baseman Adam Schlossman ’O6 who stole the
show for the Garnet, going 4-for-6 with seven runs batted in and two runs scored, leading a Garnet squad that
brought only eleven players on its trip to Washington.
Co-captain Matt Goldstein ’O4 also contributed four
hits to the shalacking, going 4-for-5 with three RBIs.
