Student group investigates need
for dean of multicultural affairs
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Swarthmore has myriad organizations and administrative positions that contribute to the goal of promoting diversity in education. The Diversity Task Force. The Intercultural Education Team. The student-run Ethnic Studies
course, the Tri-Co orientation program, the Intercultural
Center, and the Diversity Coalition, not to mention a sea
of acronyms: BCC, HOLA, SQU, SAO, SASS, WRC.
Yet many people see a glaring problem in this confusing web of associations and officers.
There is no post whose sole purpose is to tie it all together, to provide, in the words ofAssistant Dean and Gender Education Adviser Karen Henry, "an overarching vision about multicultural issues on campus."
Although there are plenty of support systems for stu-

THERE IS NO POST WHOSE SOLE
PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE AN
OVERARCHING VISION ABOUT
MULTICULTURAL ISSUES ON CAMPUS.
dents of specific minority groups, there is no one whose
job it is to unite students to take advantage of the

multicultural environment Swarthmore offers.
Each support group provides a haven for its members
and educates the campus through open events, but no administrator or student group works solely to create
multiculturalprogramming with the exception of the waning Diversity Coalition. And most students who are part of
the white, heterosexual majority have not been educated
on what role they should play in contributing to a diverse
community.
The position of associate Dean ofMulticulturalAffairs
would fill this gap. This station has been vacant since 1995,
when Joe Mason, previously director of the Black Cultural
Center, resigned from the post.
Past efforts to hire someone new have fallen through
twice, and there is currently no search committee for the
job.

Now, for the first time, a student group has taken an active
role in the issue: ADVICE (Advocating Diversity and a Variety of Ideologies in a College Environment), a nexus of racial,
ethnic, gender-based and religious support group representatives which was formed two years ago, decided this fall that
its primary goal would be to push for the hiring of a Dean of

MulticulturalAffairs.
ADVICE has already expressed its ideas about the
multicultural dean position to Provost Jennie Keith, President Al Bloom and Dean of the College Bob Gross. But much
remains to be done. "Right now, it's a conversation on the
table at this point, no more than that," said Pat James, directory of community service learning and former head of a
search committee for a multicultural dean. "When there is an
official search for a position, there is a committee made specifically to search for a candidates, an office ready for that
person, funds to pay that person with, probably some administrative assistance for that person. If we want to have a
multicultural dean by the fall, a search committee and process must form and begin really soon."
James said that for that to happen, students have to show
administrators that they want the position filled. Past efforts
to hire a multicultural dean have fallen through due to a simple

lack of community input.
The notion of a dean of multicultural affairs has been tossed
around for quite some time. "It's been on the table for a good
four or five years now," said James, who headed a search committee for a dean two years ago.
The post was actually filled in 1993 by Mason, a former
Black Cultural Center director, but it has remained empty
since his resignation in 1995.
Since then, two official searchcommittees comprising students, faculty and administrators have sought to hire a
multicultural dean. One search began in the fall of 1995 but
fell through due to protests by black students; the other started
in June 1999 but tapered off due to lack of sufficient student
involvement.
"Students on the committee were feeling very, very uncomfortable about a lack of input from the larger community of
students," said James of her committee. "We decided to reconvene later when there was more opportunity for student

Claire Weiss For The Phoenix

Gloria Chan, ADVICE coordinator, is helping to formulate
a survey that will show how students feel about the
need for a dean of multicultural affairs.
In this effort to seek out more community involvement,
however, the search was dropped. The college is now back
at square one, with the possibility of hiring a multicultural
dean no more than a widely discussed idea.
ADVICE plans to circulate a survey this weekend in an
effort to assess student opinion on this topic. "We're trying to gauge what multiculturalism is and what diversity
is" in the eyes of the student body, said Gloria Chan 'O2,
coordinator of ADVICE and president of Swarthmore Asian
Organization.
The survey will be distributed to eight or ninehalls and
will ask general questions about how students define cultural terms and what they feel could improve the cultural
situation at Swarthmore. Student response will be used to

input."

Coed housing proposal meets positive reaction
BY JON EHRENFELD
Next school year, there will very likely
be coed housing at Swarthmore. In a public information session Monday, Nov. 20 the
Housing Committee and Myrt Westphal,
dean ofresidential life, discussed the proposed housing plan.

Coed housing has been discussed intermittently for several years, but the most
recent official proposal for it came from

Tim Stewart-Winter 'OL
The proposal is designed to accommodate queer students who might feel uncomfortable rooming with someone of the same
sex.

According to Stewart-Winter, the Housing Committee supported the original proposal.

The Housing Committee, which is comprised of students, advises Dean Westphal,

but has no decision-making authority. The
deans often approve recommendations
made by the committee.
This proposal provides for coed housing in four residences: the Lodges, Roberts,
Palmer, and Worth.
Stewart-Winter's proposal is modeled in
part on the housing policies of Haverford,
Hampshire, and Wesley an colleges. He is

optimistic about the future of the proposal.
"It would be an unusual step for them to decide not to implement coed housing next
year," he said. "This is an option that a small
group of people will take advantage of— but
a group whose needs should be respected."
The open session was relatively short, due
to a lack of discussion material.
Westphal and others cited the lack of controversy on campus: nearly everyone, she
said, felt similarly about the issue, and was
willing to support coed housing.
Some possible objections to coed housing
revolve around admissions and couples.
The admissions office has always de-

scribed Swarthmore as a school without

theme dorms; with coed housing, this might
have to change.
In addition, the possibility of male-female
couples housing together was brought up as
a possible downside to the proposal.
Following the public discussion, the Hous-

ing Committee and Westphal convened fur a

closed meeting.
Whatever the outcome, Westphal said,

there was no hurry to come to a decision immediately. The deadline for the deans to decide on the issue is in March, which leaves
plenty of time for smoothing out the details of
the proposal.

Roberts is one of the dorms that would have coed housing under the proposal currently
before the housing committee. The committee has expressed support for the proposal.

Rezoning proposal faces ville opposition
BY IVAN BOOTHE
A college-sponsored proposal to rezone college property
has stalled in Swarthmore Borough Council. The college
made the proposal in hopes of recouping the loss of land
incurred by the proposed hotel and retirement community

developments.
The college brought the rezoning proposal to Borough
Council in early November in hopes of gaining more flexibility over college-owned land currently zoned for residential use. But the proposal, which recommends that the

council rezone the land for institutional use or as an overlay district, has met with concerns about its fairness.
The rezoning would allow the college significant freedom in deciding what type of buildings to erect on the land.
The college does not have specific plans yet for the property it wants rezoned. These include properties between
Chester Road and Cedar Lane, the block enclosing the Black
Cultural Center; properties north of Elm Avenue; and an
area near the Mary Lyon dorm.
"We're looking out 25 to 50 years from now," said Larry
Schall, vice president for facilities and services. "What
we're looking for is some kind of increased flexibility, without committing to what we're going to build."

The college is not concerned with how the borough
grants that flexibility: rezoning for institutional use or an
overlay district, which would allow the college limited maneuvering, were both acceptable, Schall said. "There is a
whole series of ways this could work," he said.
Some Swarthmore citizens, however, do not favor the
plan. At a Borough Council meeting on Nov. 6, several residents voiced opposition to the proposal, citing the increase
in traffic and an impact on surrounding property values.
Some said that since the inn is primarily the idea of the
college, it should not be compensated for the loss.
"I'm neither in favor nor opposed to the rezoning request per se," said Lora Lavin, a former Borough Council
member and Swarthmore resident, in a telephone interview. But, she said, "The inn was never a borough initiative, it was a college initiative.... It was enthusiastically
embraced by the community, but that doesn't change the
fact that it came from the college."
For many at the college, however, the hotel proposal is
as much the borough's as it is the college's.

"If people believe that the college would be doing this
on their own, they're mistaken," Schall said. "The Board
of Managers was very clear that we're not interested in
losing four acres of land to this."
Schall said the college made the request because of the
land the college will lose to the proposed hotel and restau-

rant complex.
The plans for the complex include realigned roads, more
parking and space for a bookstore, which would take up
between four and five acres south of the train station, on
land that currently is college athletic fields.
"The borough is asking us to give up over four acres of
land that we now own for the inn," Schall said. "This is the
time to make sure that the college's long-term interests are
preserved."

college."
The college is willing to discuss limits to the proposal, such
as height and use parameters for the buildings.
Rather than the college coming up with an absolute proposal, Schall said, representatives want to join borough officials in hearing public opinion and forming an agreeable solution.

This ambiguity, however, makes the issue hard to deal with
for the Borough Council, said Ann K. Seidman, the Borough
Council vice president. "It's hard to respond to something as
vague as that," she said.
The proposal, she said, was also unexpected. "The college,

without mentioning it in the steering committee process,
said that if they gave up some of their land they'd want
more flexibility elsewhere. I was certainly taken by surprise the first time I heard the idea," she said.
Schall explained that the college wants to work with
Swarthmore residents to develop a specific plan that is acceptable to both parties. "I think we need to have the college put its interests on the table, and craft some kind of
compromise that works for everybody," he said.
Seidman compared the rezoning proposal with the inn
proposal, noting the difference in the details. The plan for
the hotel, she said, "has a footprint, how they're going to
use it, how many square feet the bookstore will be, where
the road is going to g0... it's very concrete." The flexibility
proposal, however, is "very amorphous," she said.
"If we got an idea of how they would use it personally I would hate to see those beautiful old buildings torn
down I'm still thinking it can happen," she said.
The Borough Planning Commission and representatives
from the college will discuss the proposal at the next planning commission meeting on Dec. 13.
Schall said that the commission would be inviting
people to discuss the issue over the next few months. "This
committee is going to kind of broker some middle ground,"
he said.

Unlike Schall, Lavin does not support the idea of rezoning
land in exchange for the inn. "The college certainly has a right
to ask for the rezoning," she said, "but I don't think the borough should consider it a tradeoff for an inn."
Lavin noted that the borough had conducted economic
impact studies thatindicated that the financial benefits of the
inn on downtown Swarthmore would be minimal. "The inn is
not going to do anything economically to help our town center," she said.
Schall, however, said he feels differently. "One of the clear
things the town favored was a hotel-restaurant development,"
he said. "It is an attempt to revitalize the business district,
not just a place for people to stay when they come to visit the

The college is seeking to have land it owns rezoned as compensation for other land lost if the proposed hotel is built on
four acres of land currently owned by the college. The area lost to the hotel includes the C parking lot and the softball
field, pictured above. Some borough residents, however, feel the issues of the hotel and rezoning are unconnected.

Students slow to
claim SBC funding
BY AN ASTASIA KOLENDO
The abundance of funds remaining unused as the school year is almost half over was one of the most prominent issues discussed at the
Student Budget Committee fireside chat this Tuesday, during which
SBC also informed students of its plans to increase its budget.
Next year, the committee is planning to recommend a budget increase of$21,250 from this year's amount for student groups. This raise,
besides covering the projected inflation, wouldadd $11,740 to the groups'
budget.
So far this year students groups spent only $95,000 out of the allocated $317,000. According to SBC Treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2, by this
time in the year usually $140,000 is spent. Approximately $5,000 of the
Social Affairs Committee's funds for this semester remains unspent.
In addition, despite complaints that some groups had no money to
fund certain events, few of them came to SBC asking for more. SBC
sets aside $35,000 each year for the funding of special events.
In effect, this semester's budget is a paradox. While much complaining has come from both large and small groups regarding the infamous
19 percent budget cut, from the figures it would not seem that the cut
money is needed. At the chat, students offered their own interpreta-

tions.

The psychological pressure of the looming deficit of funds due to
the cut was one explanation mentioned.
"It definitely puts a mental restraint on us
thinking there is no
money," said a representative of the Drama Board present at the meetClaire Weiss For The Phoenix

Melanie Young addresses staff in the first presentation by a human resources director in over a year.

Human resources director addresses
staff, says pay needs to be examined
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL

After nearly a year without an administrative
voice to represent their concerns, on Nov. 17 college
staff were given the chance to express their opinions
to newly-inaugurated Associate Vice President for
Human Resources Melanie Young, who spoke critically of some college employment policies and articulated many long-standing staff grievances.
"I think you've got to pay people generously.
You've got to set your standards high and then hold
people to them," Young said to a large audience of
staff in the LPAC cinema. "I know [that] has maybe
not been the case here," she added, alluding to compensation practices that until last spring in many
cases were below the market averages.
Young, who was hired in April, has already established herself as an advocate for staff on campus.
This fall she successfully pushed the administration
to retract a vacation pay policy that some staff had
felt was unfair. Young changed the policy, which put
a monthly cap on the accumulation of vacation days,
so that staff may carry over 30 vacation days a year
into the next year.
But in her speech, Young focused on what remains
to be done. She cited a wide array of problematic
employment policies.
The compensation system, she said, needs to be
revamped. "Some of you don't trust our system. It
needs to be looked at and a new one needs to be developed," she said.
In an interview, Young said she is searching for a
replacement to the current process that would allow
for greater mobility within the wage scale, which is
currently meticulously divided into 32 pay grades.
She said that one of the options being considered is
a broadband scale with as few as five grades ofgreater
wage ranges that would allow staff more room to

advance in pay.
Young also stressed the importance of being open
with staff about compensation policies, promising
that top levels for pay grades will soon be published
on the Internet. Currently the college's site shows
starting and average market wages for various pay
grades, but staff have complained that without a top
pay limit they lack a goal toward which to work.
"I want you to be confident that you're being paid
fairly," she said.

The process by which staff are paid will also be
changed, Young announced. "Lots of you find the
whole payroll process very cumbersome," she said.
Currently different departments use different payroll systems, but Young said that the process will be

streamlined soon. When she said that the streamlin-

ing will happen later than previously expected, which
was mid-December, the audience let out a collective
groan.

Young spoke about"the great faculty/staff divide,"
as she called it, alluding to the feeling of some staff
that they are underappreciated on the campus.
"I can see now that I've been here six months
[that] this is a very complicated issue," she said. "We
have to approach this as an invitation to have a conversation."
Young also talked of improving training to allow
for job mobility, examining and possibly abolishing
the evaluation system and providing assistance with
health care providers that can be complexly organized and unforgiving.
In an interview, she said that she has more on
her mind than what she spoke about to the staff. "My
list is long," she said of the additional changes she
plans to make to employment policies. She mentioned
initiating a new employee orientation the college
and
currently doesn't have one for all employees
revising the employee handbook.
Young's presentation was received well, with a
few spontaneous bursts of applause.
"She said that people shouldbe compensated well,
and that means a lot," education department administrative assistant Kae Kalwaic said. "A lot of people
felt positively about Melanie's speech."
Kalwaic added that she would like to see Young
push the college to pay above-market wages, especially for veteran staff. She said that the college shows
evidence of wage compression, a phenomenon in
which wages of veteran and incoming employees
gradually converge.
Young said that a number of factors, including
sudden growth in fields like Internet technology and
a flourishing economy, can cause wage compression.
But she acknowledged the employer's role in the matter, too. "You only get that problem if an employer
doesn't move people along at the correct rate," she
said.

With

Young

on board, that might just happen.

ing.
Another cause for the unclaimed funds is the lack of group activity,
Barron noted. Some suggested that groups have not been very active
because leadership has been spread thin. In order for groups to be active, they must all have a core of very devoted members, but with 97
groups chartered on a small campus that also tends to be academically
very intense, this dedication is often hard to muster.
Some said that groups have been slow to organize events this semester because of the hype surrounding the budget cut, which has
pushed groups to be tight with the purse and led them to mistakenly
believe that additional SBC funding is not available.
"[Money] has definitely been an issue," said Chela Delgado 'O3, the
representative ofthe several activist groups at the meeting. "We weren't
getting enough to begin with," she said of the funding cut.
The plight of small groups was one of the issues brought up at the
meeting. These groups find it hard to plan their budgets a year ahead,
as required by the committee, due to their uncertainty of their activities, and they are looking to have the policy changed.
The committee argued that without solid plans for events it cannot
allocate money, however.
Some suggested that increased publicity about SBC policies could
help solve miscommunication. A student attending the meeting suggested that the committee build a home page explaining the details of
how to apply for funds, as the committee currently lacks a Web site.
Committee members said in defense of their policies that they distribute packages detailing the application process to group treasurers.

"The dean's office pretty much has its mind made up

Although ADVICE is the only group whose main focus

tute.
According to Sams, the dean would also help advise the
freshmen entry diversity workshops. Sams said that there is
a strong possibility of the dean "doing orientation activities
around diversity" for all students.
The dean would also coordinate Beyond the Boxes, a traveling conference started by Swarthmore students three years
ago whose purpose is to address multiculturalism at other liberal arts colleges, said Sams.
"A multicultural dean would work with as a liaison with
students, faculty and administration," said Annamaria Cobo,

college community.

The Intercultural Education (ICE) Team is "charged
with these kinds of questions," saidICE member Tim Sams,
who is director of the Black Cultural Center, co-chair of
Diversity Task Force and advisor for ADVICE. Similar in
makeup to ADVICE, the ICE team is a group of administrators from specific interest groups who address issues
such as tolerance, diversity in the classroom and retention of all students and faculty.
If hired, the Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs
would oversee the ICE Team, providing leadership and a
common vision for its members and the entire campus.
Although it addresses diversity on campus, the ICE team
does not deal specifically with multiculturalism.
Sams said that "none of us are directly responsible for
dealing with [it]
multiculturalism concerns everyone

on campus."

Indeed, there exists no administrator whose only job is
to address these concerns.
The college's array of support groups work only with
students who fit into certain minority categories.

Freshman entry discussions on diversity and hall-based

diversity dialogues are run by individual students affiliated with the remnants of what was once the Diversity
Coalition.

The Diversity Task Force is a group of primarily faculty and administration whose purpose includes hiring and
retaining faculty of color and advising the provost and dean
of the college about issues of diversity. They are currently
exploring what position, if any, they want to take on the

issue of the multicultural dean.

ofcolor and the Multicultural Winter Insti-

associate dean and director of the Intercultural Center. She
also pointed to Student Council and faculty as other channels
in which a multicultural dean could address issues of diver-

sity and multicultural education.
The dean would also help institutionalize, if not teach, the
student-run ethnic studies course presently offered at the college. He or she would need to "develop some courses above
and beyond what students have been doing," said Sams.
Above all, a multicultural dean would "serve the campus,
and the entire campus," said Tran.
"This is vital," added Cobo. "It is important that this person is for everyone not only be for students of color, [but
...

also] for white students and for Jewish students. We have an
IC, a BCC, a WRC, an Interfaith director, but [the multicultural
dean would be] someone who would bring people together."
Resistance to the hiring of an associate dean of
multicultural affairs is hardly present, at least among those
who would work with the new administrator
that is, the

directors of resource centers like the WRC and BCC.
"There is no outward opposition to the multicultural dean,"
Sams said. "The question is how to go about hiring and using
one."
"A lot of folks are still assessing what is the best modelfor
us," said Sharmaine Lamar, the college equal opportunity officer.
"Swarthmore does provide an arena for multicultural education," said Cobo, "through student groups, curriculum, community service, even the president's and dean'soffice. We are
all pieces of this puzzle," she added, "but, to complete the
puzzle, we need the multicultural dean as a catalyst. Then we
would be closer to an environment where we will all learn."

Bag lunches
not likely to
return soon
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

The program allowing students to pick up bag

lunches from Tarble using meal credit was
temporarily suspended two weeks ago, and is not

likely to resume in the near future.
After one of the card-swiping machines was
stolen from Sharpies on Oct. 31, the unit used for
bag lunches in Tarble was brought in to replace the
stolen one to avert long lines at meal times,
putting an end to bag lunches.

"We are so sorry for the inconvenience. We do
understand that it is an inconvenience," dining
services manager Therese Hopson said. On a
typical day, about 200 students used bag lunches.
In comparison, about 900 students usually eat
lunch at Sharpies.
For many students, bag lunches provided a
convenient option, and many wish they were still
offered. Sorelle Friedler 'O4 said that she used bag
lunches mainly for the convenience factor when
she was in a hurry.
Hopson emphasized that the goal is to
eventually reinstate bag lunches and that dining
services is looking into purchasing a new C-BORD
machine.
It is "not a process that happens overnight," she
said, especially since the card-swiper has proved to
be a difficult machine to replace. The model the
college currently uses has been discontinued by
the manufacturer. The newer model is considerably
more expensive, and would require re-wiring work
before it could be used.
The easiest solution, Hopson said, would be to
have whoever stole the C-BORD machine return it.
"We really hoped someone would have returned it
by this time. About every year one is taken as some
kind of prank. Usually they do show up again by
this time. I don't know why it isn't back," she said.

Coffee bar to serve late-night snacks in McCabe
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Students craving a late-night cup of
coffee while studying in McCabe will
soon need to search no farther than the
ground floor. A coffee bar in McCabe will
likely open within the next several
weeks, according to Ushi Tandon, an administrative assistant in the library who
has been working on the idea all semester.

The coffee bar will be open for three
two-hour periods on weekdays and for
two two-hour periods on weekends. The
intent will be to open the coffee bars
during hours students can't get food
many other places on campus, and it will
be open from 10 p.m. to midnight on
weekdays. "We want to provide a service
students can't get somewhere else,"
Tandon said.
The coffee bar will fill an obvious
desire among students, she said, as many
already bring food and drinks into the
library on their own, despite the signs
on the doors prohibiting them. "Our biggest concern is to keep students in the
library, to keep them motivated," she
said, explaining that the addition ofa coffee bar will help accomplish this.
The location set aside for the coffee
bar in the first floor lounge is very small,
and Tandon said this will restrict the
variety of food that can be sold. Currently, coffee, tea and muffins will be on

the menu. Fair Trade coffee will be
served. In the early stages of planning
the coffee bar, Tandon contacted
Starbucks as a potential supplier. When
the student group Conscious Consumers
heard rumors of this, however, they suggested using Fair Trade coffee. As this
alternative coffee proved to be "negligibly more expensive," Tandon said it "was

an easy decision to make."
The coffee bar was originally
scheduled to open before Thanksgiving, but Tandon said when it actually
opens will depend on how soon a
group of reliable students can be
hired and trained to staffthe bar. A

Tuesday advertising the jobs.

SCCS proposal wins gameroom space in runoff

laterthat the council decided to put the space

Swarthmore Computing Center Society
achieved a solid victory in the runoff round
of the gameroom referendum held Nov. 1517, beating the opposing SWa-Wa proposal

up for referendum.
Stepleton said one change SCCS had already decided to make to the original plan was
to use tables instead ofthe countertops present
in the original design. This will allow SCCS
to use the money for other things, including a

by 203 votes.

Members of SCCS will meet with staff
soon to work out details for the renovation
of the old gameroom in Tarble basement.
According to Tom Stepleton 'O2, SCCS
member and a major architect of the proposal, construction will begin sometime
next semester and be finished before the
start of the next school year, possibly even
before the end of the spring semester.

As the winner of the referendum, SCCS
will receive the old gameroom space as well
as $35,000 with which to make physical
improvements. SCCS will pay for additional amenities, such as the Play Station 2

it proposed.
Stepleton said, "Right now all we're
promising for the big screen is the
Play Station 2, but we will be moving on
from that fairly soon."
The plan features a computing lab with
nine workstations, as well as a conference

room, a multimedia viewing room and a
closed server equipment room.
According to Stepleton, the architectural plan of the gameroom was completed
last year, when the college supplied an architect to design a computing center for

SCCS.
After SCCS lost its bid for the Sharpies
111 space to the Student Art Association,
Student Council approached the group
about renovating the gameroom space and

video projector.

According to Stepleton, SCCS systems ad-

ministrators will serve

as custodians for the
space. The computing center willalso feature
added security, including motion detectors
and a closed circuit camera system for when
the center closes, which will be around 2 a.m.,
Stepleton said.
Stepleton said, "We are really excited about
having this space. In a sense we are also relieved, because remaining relevant on campus is important to us. We felt our future was
basically contingent upon getting an actual

physical presence."
SCCS had plans of opening a smaller computing lab in their current space on the fifth
floor of Parrish, but Hurricane Floyd put a

hole in the roof, so the group abandoned those

plans, Stepleton said.

He added that SCCS is still actively pursu-

ing its campaign, begun in the first round of
the referendum, to get more student space on
campus. The campaign included posters and
a petition encouraging Student Council and
the deans to work towards providing meeting
spaces for all student groups.
For the time being, Stepleton said SCCS is
willing to share its space.
"We welcome all groups to come and go in
the computing center," he said. "In fact, we
think it's important that we make this space

Council approves online voting
BY GERRIT HALL
In its last two meetings, Student
Council pushed the idea of extending the pass/fail deadline; took action against a Computing Services
Committee (CSC) bandwidth proposal; and approved online voting
for the upcoming elections.
Curriculum Committee (CC) representative Chris Morello 'Ol reported that at a CC meeting on
Thursday, Nov. 16, the department
heads who sit on the committee this
year were less opposed to extending
the pass/fail deadline than in the
past.
Currently, students must declare
after two weeks whether they wish
to take a class for a formal letter
grade or for a pass/fail grade. For up
to seven weeks, students can opt out
of a pass/fail grade and receive a
formal grade in the course, accord-

ing to Morello.
"We were proposing to move the
deadline to eight or nine weeks, or
even better, to not have to declare
[pass/fail] at two weeks, but at eight

or nine weeks," said Morello.
Morello spoke to the student
council at the meeting on Monday,
Nov. 20. The council strongly supported the idea, and urged Morello
to throw his full weight behind the
issue at future CC meetings.
According to Morello, some faculty members believe that such
changes will "keep class involvement higher."

The student council also drafted
a letter to the CSC regarding the

CSC's bandwidth proposal. The CSC
had proposed to make additional
bandwidth available to students at
the cost of $4O per month, not $4O per

semester as previously reported by
the Phoenix, according to Stephen
Maurer, associate provost for information technology.
In the letter, the council asked
the CSC to "table any proposed plans
to charge students for additional
bandwidth." The council wrote that
allowing students to buy individual

bandwidth would "undercut our
ability to push for more bandwidth
for the entire student body," and also
raised questions of equity.
In response to the letter, the CSC
has halted discussion of selling
bandwidth.
"We regard that as being on
hold," said Maurer. "When an organization asks you to do nothing,
that's pretty easy to carry out."

The CSC is waiting for student

protest or new informationfrom the
student council before taking action.
"In the absence of student disagreement, we're happy just to sit
on it. The ball's in the student
government's court right now," said
Maurer.
The student council did not mention bandwidth at its meeting this

Monday.
Finally, the Student Council
made plans to allow online voting
for the next Student Council elections, which will be held in early
December.
The first three days of voting are
going to be done online, using the

will then determine who has al-

Morello stressed the advan-

tages ofonline voting over traditional voting. "You don't have to

won't have to make a hasty decision," he said.

Science Center woes
$45 million can buy a lot of things: 30,000 Power
Mac G4 Cubes, 450 Hummers, 20 spacious downtown
Manhattan apartments, one large academic complex.
But $45 million might not buy the science center
Swarthmore needs.
With over a year of cost-cutting completed and

another round of cuts on the horizon, the departments
in the natural sciences are discovering that the new
Science Center may be insufficient to meet their
needs in the next 10 years. Numerous faculty are
worried that the Science Center will be outdated
before it's even completed, that it will lack the
laboratory and office space they need for the future.
These concerns are deeply disturbing. Cutting
corners and slashing programs is no way to support
the college's fundamental mission. A well-planned,
well-built science center should last the college at
least 20 years not five.
As the college continues its vaunted capital
campaign, those in charge should be aware that it
makes sense to do things right the first time. If this
means laying out an additional $5 million to $lO
million, the college should strive to secure those
funds and earmark them for the Science Center.
We realize that the funds available to the college
are finite and that even a few million dollars are
difficult to spare. But this is a long-term investment,
and with something as important as the Science
Center, we don't want to be saddled with the academic
equivalent of a fitness center without locker rooms.
So we urge those in charge to do things right the
first time and build a Science Center that meets the
college's present and future needs. After all, what's
another 5,000 G4s or three Manhattan apartments
when you're building the future?

and women to room together even on a very

option.
While co-ed housing has not yet been formally
approved, it is quite possible that it will, in fact, be an
option for the next academic year. The proposal has
been recommended by Housing Committee, but that
body has no decision-making power and the idea now
goes to the deans.
If the deans do approve the proposal when they
make a decision next semester, it is not likely to
change rooming patterns for most students. The
current plan calls for co-ed housing to be limited to
dorms without any freshmen; freshman housing
would remain unchanged.
The plan will be of primary benefit to queer
students who have been uncomfortable sharing rooms
with members of the same sex. Of slight concern to

heterosexual couples roomed together. But other
schools with similar policies have mostly avoided
those problems. That is probably because it is
possible to trust students to make wise choices for

themselves and their relationships, whether that
means it is better to live with a significant other or
whether it is better not to.
Another option that has long been available to
heterosexual couples is to simply flaunt the rules and
cohabit regardless. The co-ed housing proposal is
good policy because it makes legal a practice relatively few heterosexual students now choose anyway
while finally offering queer students a bit of parity on
something as close to home as, well, home.

Dear Editor:
I was unaware of the Athletic Review Committee and the
college's decision to re-evaluate the athletic program at
Swarthmore until I read your article online the other day. I
pray that those involved with the decision-making process

will do so without bias.
As your article pointed out, there is a great deal of prejudice directed at student-athletes and athletics in general at

BY FAR THE SMARTEST AND MOST DRIVEN
PEOPLE I KNEW AT SWARTHMORE WERE
THE GUYS I PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH AND
THE WOMEN I KNEW ON THE FIELD
HOCKEY AND LACROSSE TEAMS.
Swarthmore. For an institution and community as openedminded as Swarthmore, I feel as though this issue is continually brushed aside. Regardless, athletics should and must
remain a part of Swarthmore to maintain the diversity that
makes Swarthmore such a unique and great place.

I personally feel as though athletes are in fact different
from the average Swarthmore student and that they do need
to be handled differently. Should this make the college shy
away from athletics or dealing with these students? Absolutely not. Why? Because these students bring so much to

the school and the community.
By far the smartest and most driven people I knew at
Swarthmore were the guys I played football with and the
women I knew on the field hockey and lacrosse teams. I believe many of these student-athletes would not have chosen
to attend Swarthmore if they were not afforded the opportunity to participate in intercollegiate sports.
I must say that if the school were to get rid of athletics I
would feel betrayed. I would feel as though we, as a school
and community, did what was easy and not what was right.
That in and of itself goes against everything Swarthmore is
about. I hope that the ARC will make the correct decision
and keep athletics as a part of Swarthmore.

IQPINIONSI
Letters TO THE EDITOR

Board's actions were wrong
Dear Editor:

To clarify my resignation from the Phoenix last week, I

believe an editor should edit. As tautologically true as that
sounds, The Phoenix editorial board disagrees. A few weeks
ago, a Phoenix columnist wrote an article which included
statements that cavalierly made light of rape and also opposed
standing up to people who advocate rape in innocuous situations.
These statements would seem to be perfect territory for
the Phoenix staff to exercise editorial authority and remove
the statements. However, the statements were not removed.
While I loudly protested the statements, the Phoenix editorial board was as silent as the Pope Pius XII.
I confrontedthe editorial board about this problematic nonresponse. I was told that they had phoned the writer for an
apology (which, by the way, he declined). They would not reprimand the writer nor take action against him. They would
not write a retraction. They would not edit a columnist's views
because although the comments were "offensive," they were
not "unprintable."
I find that problematic. I loved writing for The Phoenix.
But just like my parents wouldn't join the Rotary Club until
the Supreme Court opened the Rotary Club's membership to
women, I will not have my name associated with a newspaper that does not edit out sentiments that tolerate the advocacy of rape. This is why I am really resigning from this position.

There are several conceivable reasons why the Phoenix
editorial staff did not or does not remove the objectionable
statements. Here they are, followed by my refutations:
First, you could argue that the author has freedom of
speech rights. Therefore, the editorial board should not limit
his speech. But the first amendment protects against government infringement of speech. People can say as many
stupid, offensive things as they want on the streets or in

their home. That doesn't mean The Phoenix should pay them

to write these statements and print it for community consumption.
Second, you could argue that the marketplace of ideas is
good. All arguments are welcome. But The Phoenix has a limited amount of space. Therefore, certain inappropriate comments that are not well thought out should not be included
because The Phoenix can't serve as a marketplace to all ideas.
For instance, some people think certain racial groups aren't
human, and thus, should be enslaved. This idea, however, is
utterly wrong and not worthy ofputting in a student-run newspaper. Discussion on who is to blame when rape occurs could
possibly be construed as worthy of discussion. Making light
of rape is not worthy of discussion.
Third, you could argue that anything not "unprintable" is
fair game. But The Phoenix editors concede they would not
allow Holocaustrevisionist statements or arguments that support the enslavement of various races. Those are, by their
definition, "unprintable."
The reasons to urge The Phoenix to exercise more edito-

rial control are clear. The Phoenix is the student newspaper
because it is supposed to serve the students. But allowing
clearly offensive statements devoid of intellectual merit serves
no one. I hope Swarthmore pays more attention to what The
Phoenix prints and demands that our newspaper start exer-

cising more self-restraint.
I can only hope that the editorial board will consider exercising their authority more prudently, that those in charge
will ask about this philosophical question to the candidates
for editor next year when interviewing, and that supportive
students urge the current editorial board to exercise any reasonable standard in editing comments in the newspaper so
that we can all have a newspaper to be proud of. But until
then, I resign.

John Dolan 'Ol

Columnist did right thing 'Progressive' label doesn't
Dear Editor:
We are writing to applaud former Phoenix columnist John
Dolan for his courage and insight.
In a staunchly pro-rape community such as this one, it
requires great strength of character to take a personal stand
against such a popular and universally accepted activity in
such a public venue. Many of us remain silent while the numerous pro-rape organizations on campus spread their lies,
write their editorials and plaster campus centers with their
fliers, but Dolan has courageously made himself a shining
example for us all ("Take a stand against rape," Nov. 16).
Not content to simply point out the problem, Dolan does
not hesitate to tell us where the blame lies, even if this means
going up against powerful administrative forces like the College Judiciary Committee. We can't imagine a better articulation of the problem than the one he provides: "The burden
of proof to win a College Judiciary Committee rape case is
absurdly high."
The CJC's lackeys would point out that the requirement
that guilt should be determined "on the basis of whether it is
more likely than not that accused student has violated the
Student Conduct code or any rules, regulations, or policies of
the College" (Student Handbook, p. 36) is much more progressive than the medieval demand ofreactionary states like Texas
that guilt be shown "beyond a reasonable doubt." Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that it still rests on the presumption
of the innocence of the accused, who is invariably a rapist.
In addition to standing up for his beliefs and refusing to be
silenced (except, perhaps, by his own resignation), Dolan helpfully directs us to an instance of the problem that might have
been missed by a more careless observer. Many less socially
conscious students would have assumed that a reference to
rape in a humorous remark about a thoroughly fictitious video
game, quoted in an article about "very stupid things," was
mentionedfor satirical effect, but not our hero. No, he correctly realizes that it is not only implicitly condoning, but
actually offering advocacy for the "culture of rape" that is
being systematically and insidiously advanced in virtually
all channels ofpublic discourse and personal discussion here
at Swarthmore.
Let us all pray that the efforts of brave people like John
Dolan are enough to save us.

excuse anti-gay legislation
Dear Editor:
I would like to respond to two letters in the Nov. 16 issue
of The Phoenix.
First, the letter by Eric Shang 'O4 ("Swat's liberalism confining"): if the letter writer has not yet realized why queer
people are the coolest people on earth, someday he will, with
any luck. The objections to Coming Out Week stated in the
letter are neither subtle nor original; every year somebody,
feeling defensive, mutters the same thing. I'll leave it to someone more patient to atomize those arguments. And if you do
get around to starting that Heterosexual Club, you certainly
won't have any coming out to do. Heterosexuals are (by and
large) the most out and visiblepeople at Swarthmore. They're
in every club I know of except for SQU. And some of us queers,
believe it or not, want to hang out with each other.
Secondly, the letter by David Ellis 'O2 ("Swarthmore: too
liberal for Paul Wellstone?") troubled me more than a little,
not least because the arguments are cleverer than Mr. Shang's.
Perhaps you're right that we're a little too quick to throw
around the words "racist" and "homophobic." But I'm still
convinced that those two words are apt descriptions of ideas
and behavior that are very real and present at Swarthmore.
I'd rather make a distinction more exact than homophobic or

not homophobic.
I'm a bit surprised that Ellis was so concerned about
"whether [our] designations of people that disagree with gay
marriage and group preferences as homophobes and racists
is fair." Fair? We may not have a precise vocabulary for why
Paul Wellstone voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, but
he did vote for it. Why worry about an abstract continuum
of "progressive" or "not progressive"? He may be genuinely
progressive in other areas, but that does not make his support for this virulently anti-gay legislation any less objectionable.

If Ellis is not gay, I'm curious why he's chosen to speak on
behalf of gay people. Or was he simply critiquing
Swarthmore's political vocabulary? I'm sorry if you feel persecuted, like JosefK., by labels. My advice: get over it. If your
principles (unlike JosefK.'s) really are clear, no one will mistake you for racist or homophobic.

Letter writers use
questionable tactics
Dear Editor:
If it weren't for the ad hominems and easily ruffled
sensibilities, would you have any letters to print?
Fallacious criticisms of various political or social
viewpoints abound on the editorial pages, with articles weighted with equal parts invective and argumentation. Subtle fallacies are all the more dangerous as they go undetected and promote an ill-spirited
atmosphere for discussion.
Take a look at the letters in the Nov. 16 issue. Offended by SQU's Coming Out Week, Eric Shang atwhich
tempts to perform a reductio ad absurdum
by its nature is a rather impolite form of argumentation
of the views of "liberal" students on campus.
To emphasize his disgust with these students, Shang
employs sensationalistic language. In his appeal for
athletics, Jay Schembs poisons the well by characterizing opposing arguments as absurd and naive.
Kara Spangler is "insulted" by the prospect of an
honor code.
Meanwhile, four other letters were written in response to earlier writers who had ridiculed the beliefs of Falun Gong practitioners and ETS members.
In a laudable effort, David Ellis uses a salutary ad
hominem (Wellstone is no conservative (yay!) yet he
voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (boo!)) to establish that ad hominems (e.g. 'you homophobe') are
unfair. At least he got it half right.
To complement Swatties who employ questionable
rhetorical tactics, there seem to be Swatties who will

be offended by the rhetorician. This is a bad mix, and
I think this sensitivity flourishes within an illiberal
intellectual environment. By "illiberal" I mean that
many students do not want mere neutrality of political, social and spiritual ideals at this institution ae
they do not simply want to live and let live. Instead,
they want the community to embrace them and agree
with their values. Yes, that's right, we live among
communitarians, and communitarians don't handle
conflict well.
Confusion mounts as liberals (warm and fuzzy)
are confused with liberals (J.S. Mill) and conservatives get their feelings hurt because the Millian liberals do not run the school. Liberals (the fuzzy ones)
get confused because they can't reconcile forcing their
warm sentiments down others' throats while also
being liberal (the Millian kind).
Just because you deeply disagree with someone
doesn't mean his views are absurd. Most likely (and
this is the devil in me speaking) you're both gravely
mistaken. Ironing out those differences should proceed more sensibly in a place like Swarthmore.

Posters, chalkings
intended for publicity
Dear Editor:
The board members of the Swarthmore Queer
Union would like to respond to allegations made in
Eric Shang's letter "Swat's liberalism confining"
(Nov. 16, 2000). The "strategically" placed poster on
Mr. Shang's door was not placed by the Swarthmore
Queer Union, nor do we practice "invasive tactics"
when publicizing Coming Out Week or any other SQU
events. We would also like to make itclear that posters and chalkings are publicity methods utilized by
many other groups on campus on a regular basis.
We also would like to remind Mr. Shang that we
do in fact live in a "90% is not enough, recruit, recruit, recruit" world. In our society, heterosexuality
is presented as the only acceptable sexuality and is
enforced through the media, religion, law and social
norms. While the "10% is not enough" chalking was a
tongue-in-cheek jab at that hegemony, a "90% is not
enough" chalking would only be a painful affirmation of the existing social imperative. Additionally,
an important part of our "liberal" school environment is to grant all students their freedom of speech
and expression, including the Swarthmore Queer
Union and especially during Coming Out Week.

Rape policy, procedures inadequate

INHERIT
THE WIND

BY DONNA JO NAPOLI

Though absent spring
semester, be with us
There is a small, an infinitesimal chance, al-

though no smaller than the Florida House of Representatives deciding a presidential election, that I will
not be gracing the pages of this newspaper next semester. I have to re-apply for this esteemed job, and

the tradition is that last-semester seniors do noth-

ing, rarely even leaving their rooms. I am not certain of the logic of this; perhaps we fear that, if we
leave, some professor will catch us and realize that
we failed to fulfill the dreaded political theory requirement for political science. In any event, and
especially in light ofrecent assaults on my magnanimous character, my decision is far from being made.
Moreover, I am sure there are several of you out
there who, despite being loyal readers of this column, will not be with us, or perhaps only in spirit,
in the spring, due to early graduation, foreign study,
violations of the Mann Act (which I deplore as lending itself to a dreadful pun, as my better half once
said), failing out and the like. Come back with your
shield or on it, as my distant ancestors used to implore their warriors.
I have always admired travelers; I would like to
think that in a better age I would have been an explorer or a mendicant. As it is, I am forced to write
squirrel-related bestiality jokes while hoping not to
say anything too incriminating. You should see (figuratively, of course) the suggestions for themes that
arrive, twisted like the Beloved, in my mind. I was
once going to transcribe the lyrics to the Skee Lo
comic-rap classic "I Wish," but it seemed a little too
Pynchonesque for The Phoenix. I was going to complain of the frustrations of the now-infamous Love
Monkey, but using this column as a pimp seemed
base, and it was all a computer scam. Plus, as I once
remarked of dance clubs (this is a mixed example,
but bear with me), the chance of my girl being at a
dance club (thus, by extension, sending a Love Monkey message) seems inscrutably low.
I was even going to describe my unique concept
of the "celebrity girlfriend," but I didn't want to lose
a chapter of my dissertation to fair-use restrictions.
The additional problem is that I would have to come
up with an example that everyone knew or include
a picture; I don't think I have the authority to do

the latter, and the former is difficult. Let it suffice

to say that the girls of the Nickelodeon of my youth
hold great sway.
In the end, for better or worse, this column, and
I, on occasion, have delusions of humor, and my
pseudo-philosophical ramblings, while humorous in
an ironic way, are not as funny as my now-distant

and certainly-immature attacks on the listening
habits and vocal abilities of freshman girls.
And so I close, this time with an idiosyncratic
finish, by relating to you the best advice I got here,
though it will make no sense without a large background story that respect for the persons involved
forbids me from telling. So I translate, from the
mouth of M.M.M.H.: Though you are compelled,
though you make mistakes that seem to deny you
what you once thought you merited do not settle.

and to beseech you quite shamelessly to do the right thing,
whatever you decide that is.
In my 14 years teaching here, four students have told me
they've been raped. One was hospitalized after she attempted
suicide. One essentially lived in her dorm room for her last
year of college, cutting off her long, beautiful hair and losing
so much weight she looked like a Dachau victim. One took
medication to keep her from acting on suicidal urges, but that

didn't stop her unrelenting tears. One simply refused to talk.
Or smile. After she graduated, I never heard from her again.
When these women came to me, I held them and we cried
together. But it never occurred to me to question how the college had handled their situation. They had reported the rape,
so as far as I was concerned, the college must have handled it
properly. After all, this is Swarthmore, a place that commands
my intense admiration, a community I am proud to be a member of.
But I've since learned about both our rape policy and our
rape procedures. You can learn about them, too. You can read
the official college policy. You can walk into the health center
and say you've been raped and discover the procedures for
yourself.
Both policy and procedures are inadequate. I came to that
conclusion after talking at length with staff in rape crisis centers and reading extensively about rape. That's why I'm writing to you.
This is what I think proper policy and procedures should

include.

Every rape victim should be assumed to be in shock and
should be treated accordingly. The college should take the victim immediately to an emergency room with a rape crisis center. The victim should have all physical and verbal evidence
of the rape collected properly by people who are trained specifically to deal with this crime and who know the latest medical and legal information relevant to the crime. (One rape crisis center staff member told me, "Both the medical and the
legal sides are complicated. Colleges simply cannot set up thenown mini-rape crisis centers. They'll do it wrong.")
Here are some things that typically happen in a rape crisis

center.
L A rape kit is administered to collect DNA evidence.
2. A police officer questions the victim. (Both 1 and 2 are
essential; without proper and thorough data collection, medical and verbal, the victim's chances of ever bringing a successful lawsuit, should she/he decide to press charges, are
minimized. Maybe nil.)
3. Emergency room staff care for the physical health of the
victim and test for HIV and STDs.
4. Psychological counseling is offered immediately.
The above four typical things should happen. Anything less
is irresponsible.
But proper rape policy and procedures should also include
sessions for all students at the beginning of every semester
aimed at preventing rape and at informing students what is
likely to happen if a rape does occur (i.e., describing the type
of policy and procedures I outlined above). Among the information that should be included in these sessions are:
L A victim does not have to press charges when a police
officer questions him/her. (It is important for victims to know
this ahead of time, so that they do not get frightened away
from receiving the proper care of an emergency room based
on a misconception.)
2. Having sex with someone who does not consent is wrong,
and may well fall within our state's definition of "rape" depending

In The Phoenix of Nov. 16, 2000, John Dolan wrote a column urging the end of rape jokes on campus. I wasn't aware
of these jokes, but the column hit me at a moment when I've
been concerned with the college's rape policy and procedures.
So I'm making this an opportunity to tell you my opinion

on circum-

stances.
3. A drunk person
cannot give consent.
The second point

seems obvious, but
given thatrape is being
joked about on this
campus, I conclude that

it's worth saying.
The third point also
seems obvious. But it
needs support. You
very well might not
know that the person

Heather Doyle For The Phoenix

you are with is drunk. So here are some things to consider in

trying to make that determination.
The state of Pennsylvania is now discussing lowering the
blood alcohol level to .08 as a threshold for drunkenness for
the crime of DUI. In this discussion our lawmakers are looking at studies concerning inebriation.Females get drunk faster
than males, and the rate at which anyone gets drunk is inversely proportional to body weight.
This is significant information. For example, I would have
to drink only one-fourth the alcohol my husband would have
to drink in order to reach the .08 blood alcohol level. Please
listen up. This means that if you're a man and you've had
three beers and you're feeling great and hyped up for sex and
you ask a woman beside you to your bedroom, thinking that
since she's also had three beers, she's probably feeling great,
too, you may really be dealing with a woman who doesn't feel
great at all.
It's as though she's consumed multiple times what you
consumed maybe four times (as in my husband's and my
case). So you're sitting beside a woman who feels like you feel

after you've downed twelve beers. How do you feel after twelve
beers? I can't guess, but I can bet you're in no shape to give
consent.
I have advice. Don't invite anyone who's been drinking to
have sex with you. Make sure your partner wants to have sex
with you. Ask when the person is stone sober. Be decent.
More advice. Know that sex is important. Sure, there is
casual sex and there is sex that grows out of love. But in either case (and in all the cases in between), sex is important. It
is intricately connected to our identities, to our hopes and
dreams and politics and fears and joys. If you deny that, be
careful to make sure your denial is not simply self-serving.
Honor your sexuality. Be decent.
It's been over three years since one of my students was

raped. We write to each other often. She has finally, just this
fall, stopped crying. But she may never feel safe. Never.
These are my opinions. But this is your college. Ifyou want
whatever policy
a responsible rape policy and procedures
and procedures you believe are right please work for them.
No one else can protect you. Please protect each other.

Too close to call

DEJECTION 2000

I'm renouncing my Florida heritage

Well, folks, we're nearing the final weeks of this year's big
contest, and the whole nation awaits the outcome with bated

breath.

No, not that contest. No one cares about that one any more.
I'm talking about Time Magazine's Person of the Year, arriving
on newsstands in mid-December. The race is close, but here are
some of the contenders.
Al Gore: Famous for his oratorical skills and his popularity
in his home state of Tennessee, this brick waU-turned-presidential candidate made a good showing in Campaign 2000 by tying
his cognitively challenged rival and throwing the electoral system into unprecedented chaos. Most recently, Mr. Gore has been
given the opportunity to demonstrate several personality traits
which merit recognition: remarkable perseverance in the face
of adversity; selfless dedication to the democratic ideal of one
man, one vote; and self-reliance in the face of temptation to file
for unemployment insurance.
George W. Bush: This is undoubtedly the hardest-working
man in the country, for even though he has announced his transition to the presidency he has not yet resigned from his very
demanding job as Governor of Texas. Still on the Texas agenda:
execute a man who believes in Santa Claus; do something about
that law he signed approving of manual recounts in close elections; and continue to work with both Republicans and Democrats in the ideologically-divided Texas legislature. Despite his
busy schedule, Mr. Bush is able to maintain several worthy hobbies, such as playing with his dog, whom he named Spot.
Dick Cheney: If this vice-presidential candidate wins the Man
of the Year honor, it will almost certainly be for his bravery and
innovation over the last week. Some 59-year-olds who wind up
in the hospital with their fourth heart attack will shrink in the
face of impending doom, but Mr. Cheney modestly shrugged off
his "minor cardiac event" and kept on chugging. Within days
he was leading Mr. Bush's presidential transition team, and
when the White House denied him transitional funds because
he and Mr. Bush hadn't actually won anything yet, he kept his
campaign's promise to get rid of big government by opening up
his own private presidential transition office just blocks from
the White House.
Katherine Harris: Like Mr. Bush, Ms. Harris possesses the
amazing ability to juggle two difficult jobs at one time, in her
case Florida Secretary of State and state chairperson of the Bush
campaign. After running a tough state-wide presidential campaign for Mr. Bush, most people in Ms. Harris' position would
want to take a vacation. But in a stunning display of honor, selfsacrifice and lipstick, she went right back to work over the next
few weeks and took it upon herself to make the tough decision,
twice, as to who should be the next president of the United States.
It is true that she has already received many flowers and chocolates from conservative think tanks and political action committees, but Woman of the Year is an honor only Time Magazine can bestow on her.
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas: This Supreme Court
duo would make a fine Men of the Year cover story for Time
Magazine. George W. Bush himself has specifically cited them
as his favorite Supreme Court justices, and they will certainly
make headlines tomorrow when the Court hears the case asking them to make Mr. Bush the next president. But lest anyone
be fooled, these two justices do not always think alike: Justice
Thomas, 52, has warned liberals that he will be on the bench
until the day he dies, while Justice Scalia has been quoted as
saying that he will resign in protest if Mr. Gore wins.
Slobodan Milosevic: International candidates for Person of
the Year are always in the running, and Mr. Milosevic is no
exception. As Yugoslavia's tyrannical president during the
NATO campaign in Kosovo, he gradually lost popular support
and won only 30 percent of the vote when he ran for reelection
this fall. At first he pretended that he had won the election, but
pro-democracy societies around the world can feel good about
his honorable decision to concede defeat and leave office. Mr.
Milosevic is truly a paragon of electoral virtue.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide: The comeback kid of Haiti, this onceand-futurepresident displayed commendablerestraint this week
by declining to claim himself victor until all the votes cast in his
country have been counted. But the American government, ever
aware of its own strengths that other countries should look up to,
urged the Haitians to correct their "electoral flaws," among them
"low voter turnout."
Those are my nominations. Don't forget to send in your own.
I'll count every single vote and faithfully report the fair, accurate results to you in a future column. Honest.

BY DEIRDRE CONNER
I've had it. Ever since Nov. 7, I've been expecting birthday wishes. What have I gotten? Harassment! Practically
everyone I know keeps pestering me with all these accusations about my "stupid state" and "what the hell it has
done to American democracy." They won't leave me alone,
and since I have no excuses to give them, today, after what
seems like eons of this election absurdity, I now renounce
any and all blood and geographical ties I have with my
home state, Florida, and my hometown, Miami. I distance
myself from all my Floridian ancestors, who are flopping
in their graves at this very moment. To prove it, I even
spent Thanksgiving in New York.
You see, my fellow Americans, we're not really in
charge of what's going on in this country. Our grandparents are! Besides that, I feel I must pass on one of
this country's greatest and most sacred traditions: blaming everything that goes wrong on the previous generations. That's right, I myself take no responsibility at all
for the confusion. Instead I choose to blame it entirely
on the scads ofretirees who have invaded our great state
of Texas
I mean, Florida.
I can no longer offer up any kind of explanation for
the retired Jewish New Yorkers causing a ruckus in Palm
Beach, nor do I need to. Anyone can see that the ballot
was confusing
after all, most people in Palm Beach
County haven't even heard ofPat Buchanan. "In my day,"
say these retirees, "we didn't have all these newfangled
parties. We just had the Democrats and the Republicans, and if we didn't like it, we just had to make do!"
With all the choices, the elderly population in Palm
Beach County just got confused. It's easy, you know? A

BEACH COUNTY JUST GOT CONFUSED.
IT'S EASY, YOU KNOW? A PAIR OF

KNOWS WHAT CAN HAPPEN?
pair of glasses left in the car, and who knows what can
happen? Like I said, don't blame me ge I sent in my absentee ballot on time, with no dimples, no hanging chads
and certainly no unexpected pregnancies.
Throughout this process, I have also not been able
to account for the election/installment of Florida officials like Jeb, Katherine and the woman who had to retire from the canvassing board. She was 70, and just too
old to do all that recounting. That was (no joke) her explanation. I guess Strom Thurmond was her hero.
And with a margin of just 500 or so votes,* I can bet
Al Gore is kicking himself (or his budget people) for not
including plans to get just one more van to take more of
the less mobile elderly to the polls. Just think, if he'd hit
one or two more of those Century Village Retirement

Communities, he could have been home free!
Or maybe not. Come to think of it, maybe it's better
this way. Before the election, a lot of people didn't really
care who won. Maybe this time, it will drag out for so
long that by the time we actually have a president, no
one will be listening any more. In fact, don't tell me!
Don't tell anyone! Whoever guesses which one gets inaugurated first, wins.

Thank you, and God bless America.

Hell, a detail
Steve Salter and Collin Peng-Sue (top) share a drink and talk about their woman
troubles in "Society, a Detail," an original work by Jessica Nakamura 'O3. Peng-Sue
and Mara Gustafson play a couple bickering over the announcement of their
engagement at a cocktail party set in the late 19505. Guests include a quibbling
married couple (Salter and Amy Robinson), a has-been drunk musician (Adrienne
Mackey) and the young fiancee's vocal coach (Felicia Leicht). "Society" opens this
Friday in Olde Club with Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit" (left). In "No Exit," Estelle (Elisa
Matula), Garcin (Samuel Dingman) and Inez (Catherine Osborne) are herded into a
poorly decorated room in hell by valet Jeff Ebert. The three quickly realize that each is
destined to torment the other two for all eternity. Both "Society" and "No Exit"
address the issue of inevitability. Nakamura designed the minimalist set to
emphasize the acting focus of both pieces. Assistant direction by Amy Robinson,
lighting design by Kate Nelson-Lee and costume design by Suzanne Wu. "No Exit"
and "Society, a Detail" will be performed this Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. in Olde
Club.

Sexual health
myths undressed
Growing up in such a sexually charged
atmosphere causes all of our heads to spin
occasionally. We are fed so much information

concerning safer sex and the ways our bodies work
that sometimes it is hard to distinguish fact from
fiction. Even worse are the times when sexual
health myths are perceived as facts. This week we
want to debunk some common sexual health
myths.
Myth: Only homosexuals practice anal sex.
Fact: According to The Guide to Getting it On by
Paul Joannides, 30 percent to 40 percent of all
heterosexual couples in the United States have
tried anal sex, and half of these couples continue to
occasionally have anal sex.
Myth: It can be harmful to have intercourse
while a woman is menstruating.
Fact: Menstruation causes absolutely no harm
to either partner in any way. In fact, according to
Joannides, when a woman engages in intercourse
while having her period, contractions of orgasm
push accumulated fluids out of the uterus, which
helps decrease menstrual cramping. As a bonus,
intercourse with a menstruating woman can
sometimes feel especially pleasurable because of
the added lubrication and the fact that some
women are more sexually aroused during
menstruation.
Myth: It is okay to linger inside your partner after
intercourse as long as one of you is wearing a
condom.

Atom and His Package, minus the package
BY JONAH GOLD

The brotherhood of man and machine can be a beautiful
thing. Case in point: the formidablePhiladelphia-based human/
sequencer duo known as Atom and His Package. The duo consists of a certified chemistry teacher Adam Goren, also known
as "Atom," and a collection of sequencing and synthesizing apparel, plus a real instrument or two thrown in, collectively
known as "The Package."
Together, they write and perform silly, enormously catchy,
synthesized punk songs about such diverse subjects as punk
rock in high schools, why the metric system is better than the
English system of measurement, obsessing over Enya, and how
cool it is that Judas Priest ex-singer Rob Halford is gay. Atom
and his Package produces music for anyone who's ever tried
to reconcile liking and laughing at punk rock. Atom can laugh
at himself; and, more to the point, he can also laugh at far more
deserving targets. And that just makes for good music.
I phoned Atom at his record label for a chat. The Package
was regrettably incommunicado.

How did you become Atom and His Package?
It wasn't really supposed to be a band-type thingy. It was
just kind of like, my band had just broken up. A friend ofmine
played me a song he wrote on his music sequencer thingy.
Basically, I just got [a sequencer] because it was fun, and it
was a good time for me to be able to do stuff by myself. I set up
a tour for my friend's band, Franklin, and they were like, "You
should come play some songs with us." And people wanted me
to put out records, and it was just like that.
Where did The Package itself originate?
The Package is now kind of a number of different things
sub-packages. [The components of The Package] have been
gotten at various music stores around the Philadelphia area
but I guess originally they came from Japan.
Do you have a goal, musically or ideologically, for Atom
and His Package?
so it's
I enjoy writing songs, and I enjoy playing shows
not like I have an agenda. So there's no
it's fun. But I do take
the music seriously, and I think that the music is getting better; so that's good.
What's the most danger you've ever been in because of
an angry standard system supporter or metaihead?
The only real danger probably wasn't so much because of
the [Metric System] song but some real drunk crazy person,
and there was the part in the song where I say something about
"sticking your foot up your ass," because a foot is a foot, and
I'm very clever, and some guy thought I was talking about him,
and came at me but I don't think he was an English system

Courtesy Atom and His Package

Under what circumstances would you run for president?
IfI could get my hometown of Oreland to secede from the
union.
What would your platform be?
Death penalty for crimes much less brutal than homicide.
Death to assholes.
Do you like salt and vinegar potato chips?

No.
If you could change one thing about yourself, what
would it be?
My head would be aligned horizontally.
Who would win if you fought:

...

Fact: A condom can leak if a man waits to
withdraw until his erection is diminishedafter
ejaculating. It is best to withdraw the penis from the
vagina immediately after ejaculation.
Myths About Men
Myth: Because men always awake with an
erection, they are always horny in the morning.
Fact: "Dream sleep erections" occur no matter
what a man is dreaming about. "Morning wood" is
nothing more than a floppy penis trapped inside an
erection, and is different from a "waking-state
erection," which is caused by sexual arousal.
Myth: As they age, males' libidos decline

of measurement supporter.

How do you feel about the state of mainstream music today?
I don't know. I mean, people are still making good music,
and people do make good music; so I'm not like "all the good
music has already been done."

What do you think of Swat? [Atom and His Package

have played here in recent history]
I think that room where they have the shows is a really
neat room, and the guy who bills the shows, Andy, is a swell
guy. Yeah, and everyone was really nice, and the pizza was
really awesome.
What are you doing next?
I just finished recording the next full-length, which comes
out in March, and there's a split seven-inch, with my friend
Sean from Sean Na Na, and at some point maybe there's a
seven-inch tribute to the Mountain Goats, which is a couple
songs by them that I really like.
Do you have any grand, sweeping final statement to the
world?
No.

naturally.

Fact: It is being out of shape, rather than
increasing age, that causes a male's decline in
libido. However, age is responsible for the penis
hardening less completely and expelling less
ejaculate in older men.
Myths About Women
Myth: A woman's level of sexual arousal can be
measured solely by her vaginal wetness.
Fact: Some women become wetter during
different phases of their menstrual cycle
independently of sexual arousal. Additionally, some
women become just as aroused as their wetter
female counterparts but their vaginas remain dry.
Myth: Douching is a healthy way for women to
clean their vaginas.
Fact: Douching can be an extremely harmful
practice for women. Douches' antibacterial agents
kill normal bacteria that fend off unhealthy
microbes, often giving way to infection.
Myth: It is unsafe to use the birth control pill for
anything but birth control.
Fact: Actually, the pill is useful for many health
needs, including putting your period on hold for a
few months. There is no medical reason why a
woman should menstruate every four weeks, so
some experts say that it is completely safe to use
the pill to delay or even to stop having your period
altogether.

Squad 5-0 should suck

BY JOEY SPADOLA

BY JONAH GOLD

Today's world is becoming ever more complex. Machines
are being used for just about everything. The term "family"
has changed in meaning to "several persons who may or may
not know each other's names living together in a place ofresidence with at least one internet-access site." Music no longer

Christian rock, as a genre, is lame. Not that
God and guitars don't mix, necessarily. Certainly,
plenty of great music, from Dylan to the Violent
Femmes to Nick Cave, has been made from a
sincerely pro-Jesus perspective. The problem at
work here is broader. Bands that exist by virtue of
their beliefs rather than their musical ability,
whether the beliefs in question be based in
Christianity, Satanism, or Star Trek fandom, have a
ready-made audience and thus tend to worry a
good deal less about little things like "quality
control." Just ask Marilyn Manson.
Exceptions to do occur, however. Squad Five-0
is a Christian band on major Christian record label
Tooth & Nail,
which is

costs money. Mr. Rogers has hung up all 128 of his sweaters
for good. Add to this chaos the movie "The Piano," and whatever was once black and white in life is now a dizzying
mixture of neon green and hot pink.
In such a crazy world, we are in need of a very special
kind of guidance. That is, we need to take time out of our
busy schedules to heed the ancient and penetrating wisdom that we encounter over every meal of pork fried rice
and an eggroll. That's right, the knowledge gained from
the few, graceful words on that little slip of paper inside a fortune cookie, if duly perused,
can bring a new dimension of enlightenment to even the most skeptical modernFor most of my life, like most folks,
I did not pay much attention to the
contents of my fortune cookies.
Rather, I simply read them aloud
to my dining companions, maybe
changing a word here and there
to suit my fancy, so that "Don't

"You are an extremely
charming fellow," giggle, and
then toss them away without

giving them another thought.
It was not until my fortunes
started to become eerily accurate
and relevant to my life that I began
assess their advice far more carefully.
For instance, I recently got the following
two fortunes: "Psychiatric help is not just for
the seriously afflicted," and "The waitress who refilled your bowl of crunchy noodles is pretty cute, eh. Her
number is 567-3423." (Actually, the latter was justa cruel prank
played on me by several friends, which resulted in my calling
"Tony's Discount Car Dealership" and asking, with great anticipation, for Danielle.)
Now I make no decision, small or large, without first consulting a fortune cookie. For instance, if I am deliberating as
to whether to study or to go out, I'll immediately get myself
one of these prophetic desserts and rest my faith in its wis-

dom.

It is possible that I would get one thatreads something like
"Hit the books," but we must keep in mind that such fortunes,
like all true fonts of knowledge, cannot be taken literally. These
edible purveyors of fortune must be combed for an underlying meaning. In this case, I wouldhave to determine the meaning to be, roughly, "Go get drunk!"
I should warn my readers that not all types offortune telling are as legitimate as fortune cookies. The 1-900 horoscope
hotlines, for instance, which allegedly employ "trained experts" who are capable of perceiving even the most detailed
aspects of one's life, right down to one's underwear size, are
not really as good as they seem in the commercials, which
generally go something like this:
FORTUNETELLER: Bob, I see a woman in your life... I sense
that you're having a troubled relationship right now.
CALLER: Oh my God! That's exactly right! I just got in fight
with my girlfriend. How did you know?!
FORTUNETELLER: And Bob, wait, your job, I sense
something's happening with your job. Are you employed, Bob?
CALLER: Yes! I DO have a job. And something IS happening with it. I feel like you've known me my whole life!

Don't be fooled! As I found out when I called one (or maybe
23) of these hotlines myself, they say the very same thing to
every caller. The hotline workers base their fortunes on the
fact that every person in the world over 18 has some kind of
problems with a relationship and (usually) has some kind of
job or career plans.
So beware of such fraudulent sources of prophecy. Fortune
cookies stand out among the lot, and it is only they that I can
recommend as being true predictors of the future.
Fortune cookies have another distinguishing quality that
marks their greatness; they put to use the ingenious notion of
putting messages inside items of food. This notion was first
conceived in ancient Roman times, when Emperor Marcus

Five-0 have going against them. First, they look

Aurelius sent his most private
messages stuffed inside various
delicacies. One such message was recently found by archeologists inside the remains of a dish of mutton. It reads, "Infelix
superat foliis oleaster amaris" (in translation, "I wish I were

an Oscar Mayer wiener.").
Actually, the practice of sending messages via food remains
in use among present-day statesmen. For example, Bill Clinton
conducted his private relationship with Monica Lewinsky
through the exchange of message-bearing Hostess Twinkies.
(Note to guys: nothing says "kinky sex" like a love note romantically placed inside a cream-filled pastry.)
This system, however, was never really effective as a general means of communication, mostly because there is no way
to know when a particular food item contains a message or
when it is just plain food to be eaten. The annals of history
are thus filled with tales of inadvertently eaten pieces of ad-

vice, confessions of crime, absentee ballots, etc. In fact, it is
generally agreed among historians that the attack on Pearl
Harbor could have been averted if FDR had not unwittingly
eaten an important piece ofmilitary information that had been
strategically placed, for reasons of secrecy, inside his pastrami
sandwich.
But, to return to the topic at hand, there are countless reasons to give your fortune cookies their due respect, even if
you don't believe in prophecy or don't find the idea of messages inside food all that clever. One such reason is that you
can actually learn Chinese by paying close attention the oneword translations on the back of the fortunes.
Before I started to truly appreciate fortune cookies, I knew
only one word in Chinese, namely "zaizi." I learned this word
from a friend, who would use it whenever he stubbed his toe
or got a poor grade on an exam or got cut off by a taxicab,
from which I infer that it translates roughly to "Gosh, how
very irritating." But now, owing to the linguistic teachings of
fortune cookies, I have a formidable 18-word vocabulary that
enables me to say such things as "Hello mountain Chinese
New Year" or "Telephone eat Mitsubishi."
So don't forsake what is perhaps the truest source ofknowledge in this day and age. Even when Mr. Rogers, on account
of being older than dirt, no longer can, fortune cookies provide you vital information regarding relationships, school,
work, lottery numbers, you name it. And remember: the truly
wise man has more sweaters than answers.

and mirrored sunglasses. Second, they have a
truly stupid name, and third, the band's new
album's title, "Bombs Over Broadway," isn't much
better than their image.
This band should, by all means, suck. Yet,
somehow, they don't. One could conceivably call it
a "miracle," but that would be in pretty bad taste.
The fact remains, though, that if one can manage
to put all religious prejudices aside, "Bombs Over
Broadway" is a fairly appetizing piece of blatantly
glammy retro-rock.
That is not to say it's a work of genius: to like
this kind of music, one must be in a certain frame
of mind to begin with. Squad Five-0 certainly don't
going to get any points for originality. The band is a
relic from a time when rock stars wore tight pants,
guitar hooks were big and stupid, and with a
straight face, one could sing/snarl lines like:
"Things go better with a little bit of rock'n'roll." A
majority of their songs, with or without the creepy
religious undertones, would not sound out of place
on eighties hard-rock radio alongside Whitesnake,
Twisted Sister, and the like.
However, this is all made up for by the fact that
they do what they do so damn well. The lyrics are
stupid, the sentiment is questionable, and the
sound is nothing you haven't heard before, but
these guys know how to rock. "Bombs Over
Broadway" contains anthems worthy of hundreds
of mosh pits filled with sweaty mullet-heads, from
the classic-punk-ish "Lost Boys" to the truckerrock-sounding "They'll Never Take Me Alive." The
tracks are catchy, with riffs galore and big, fun
choruses you can headbangto until you realize
how ridiculous you look. If nothing else, "Bombs
Over Broadway" is perfect music to listen to while
you bide your time waiting for Axl and Slash to get
their acts together and reunite Guns N' Roses.
If you have little shame, an affection for
delicately-cared-for shoulder-length hair on boys,
and fond memories of Queen, don't let the fact
that Squad Five-0 ostensibly have something to do
with Christ keep you from picking up "Bombs Over
Broadway." With music this endearingly moronic,
the message is far from the most important thing.
Just listen to it and enjoy it. Your lord and master
Satan really wouldn't mind. He's pretty permissive
about that sort of thing, I hear.

Plain women
'Bounce' back

Collectors' items

BY MORGHAN HOLT
Gwyneth Paltrow really should not have
dyed her hair, I decided, slumping further
into the familiar threadbare theater chair.
Munching my popcorn alone in the movie
theater watching "Bounce," I convinced myself, without much debate, that the blonde-

to-brunette switch was not aesthetically in
her best interest.
But I have to admit that her haggard, unnatural look, coupled withher lacklusterhair
and the purplish bags that weigh down her
eyes effectively enhanced the realism of her
role. So I guess it's a good thing that she dyed
her hair.
Abby Janello (Paltrow) is nothing special,
really. She's pretty in a plain-Jane sort of way.
A skinny brunette whose long locks have
seen the worst of hairdryers, Abby corrals
her two sons into the family minivan, then
shoves the dog in after them... and that's her
life: completely unglamorous, entirely humdrum, chock-full of kids, dogs and work.
So what about her attracts the attention
ofa hunk like the slick-suited, quick-tongued
advertising honcho Buddy Amaral (Ben
Affleck), who watches her from his car, wishing he could muster the courage to approach

her?

Perhaps it's that her husband's dead. But
L.A.'s crawling with single women. So why
her? Why Abby Janello, withher hostile children, her crookedly nervous smile, her
cramped two-bedroom house and all her under-eye baggage? What, besides guilt, has him
drooling over this ordinary woman, eventually filling her with lies and trying desperately to convince her that he's worth her
time, trying to convince her that she can, as
the movie's title suggests, "Bounce" back and
look for love again?
From the minute Buddy first encounters

Abby, he tells her lies. And she tells them
right back. He lies to her about the reason
for his visit. He pretends that he doesn't feel
responsible for her husband's death, that he
doesn't feel responsible for having switched
airplane tickets with him in an attempt to
get laid, only to wake the next morning and
find that the plane's crashed, and all its pas-

Taylor desecrates subjects
through documentation
BY KATE O'DONNELL

Braids without an owner. Braids without context.
Once upon a time, these braids
hair were very much a part

of
of
women's lives and possibly even their
identities as women. Once upon a
time, these braids were a sign of
women's femininity. Once upon a
time, these braids were sexually
charged; they were braids of the long
hair that attracted men, the long hair
their owners they played with, curling tantalizing strands of itaround an
index finger, the long hair their lovers ran their fingers through. But, on
paper, without a head, a body, a personality, the braids of hair are meaningless.

Holiday ideas
BY CATHERINE OSBORNE
With Thanksgiving over, it is time to think about
holiday gift giving. In particular, it can be hard to shop
for books. After all, what will people enjoy? What
haven't they already read? This week, I've put together
a selection of books that would make great holiday
gifts and are slightly off the beaten track. I have selected them for numerous reasons, including their
clarity ofintention, sense of humor, and beautiful style
of prose or verse. However, my main criterion in selecting thesebooks was that they should befun to read,
though not necessarily funny. All of the books are exceptionally smooth reads, perfect for a winter break
afternoon. Enjoy!
Novel. "The Lyre of Orpheus," by Robertson Davies.
Third in a trilogy, although capable of standing on its
own, this buoyant book traces gypsies, businessmen,
scholars and artists through the production of a new

I like Judith Taylor. She looks just
how you want an artist to look, with her
all-black attire, Buddy Holly-esque
glasses, her red hair swept up and off
her forehead, exposing her ivory skin.
And she acts how you want an artist to

act: she's personable and dramatic.
Because of this, I want to like her
work. But I don't. Not at all. At first
glance, her show isn't particularly remarkable, but the more I looked at each
piece and the more I thought about the
show, the more disturbed
even repulsed I became.
First, I am not sure what is particularly creativeabout her work, and, thus,
I question why it is art. (Not that I am
going to open that can of worms right
now, or ever, for that matter.) My more
concrete objection is that her work
seems to trespass into sacred parts of
women's lives. It's kind of creepy.
Taylor's exhibit in the List Gallery
is a collection of photograms and large
photographs of "feminine" objects
from rings and hair to flowers and journals. The hair and the journals seem to
be the highlight of the exhibit.
For her photograms of hair, each of
which is named after a specific woman
who is or was presumably the owner of
the hair, she placed the dismembered
hair onto developing paper and then exposed it to the sun. The result is what
we see in the gallery: lopped off braids.

opera. This is a process that for some ofDavies' char-

As for whether Taylor's exhibit is appealing, that is definitely answerable.
The answer is no.
With her art, Taylor is trespassing
into these women's lives, but she is trespassing by using the impersonal medium
of photography. An object. Light. Images
on a sheet of light-sensitive paper. Photos inherently fail to capture soul.
Taylor wants her viewers to believe
that she is merely documenting something worthwhile through her photograms. But photographing personal aspects of women's lives, which at one point

resonated of some human essence
whether that essence is socially constructed or not
is neither insightful
nor useful, both literally and essentially.
For that matter, neither is photographing a little girl's journals. In my view, this
is even more disturbing than trespassing
into the personal lives of adult women.
The very nature of a journal is that it is
private, secret, sacred. A person in her
most basic state words.
The idea is that these journals represent unadulterated thoughts, that the
photos themselves are pure. But Taylor
desecrates the thoughts of the journal's
purity in exposing them detachedly, for
anyone and everyone to scrutinize.
-

It's interesting that many of the journals have heavily inked-out passages, suggesting that these little girls knew that
their internal thoughts were not fully protected by the sanctity ofthe diary medium,
that they anticipated the exploitation of
their thoughts. Given that Taylor doesn't

actually steal these journals (she finds

them or receives them), maybe she herself
realizes the perversity of her work and
chooses only those journals that will make
explicit her distortion of the complex relationship of a young girl to her diary.
Taylor talks abouthow sheis interested
in the "spirit" of the objects that she photographs. But what happens to this "spirit"
once it is taken captive on paper? Is it immortalized? Or is it stripped of its essential vitality, its beauty, its truth? Taylor is
not eternalizing this "spirit"; she is raping
distilling it from its context, pouring
it
it on paper for the world to gape at with a
penetrating gaze.
Yes, Taylor's work is feminine
insomuch as she depicts stereotypically
feminine subject matter. But it is not "feminine" or "feminist"

in the sense that it celebrates womanly traditions. Taylor's work
is subversive. Instead of uplifting the objects and their spirits, she stomps on their
sanctity, almost in parody.

Affleck insincere, Paltrow moving
From MOVIE, pg. 16
he says nothing.
Based on lies, the relationship between Abby and Buddy
is of course incredibly volatile. As a privileged member of
the audience, I was on edge, trying to predict who would find
out what and when the lies would start to unravel along with
the relationship. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Abby. She
is realistically pathetic, nervous, unsure of herself in her relationship with Buddy and her boys; she is even uncertain in
her relationship with her deceased husband.
Affleck's portrayal of Buddy is another story. I know I was
supposed to like Buddy for overlooking Abby's baggage, for
cleaning himself up, for overcoming the odds, but frankly,
Affleck's Buddy made me sick. I didn't buy his tears; they
seemed forced like his words, which was not what I was ex-

pecting.
I thought Affleck would do his usual knock-up job, but he
failed on this one. I didn'tfeel Buddy's pain, at least not like
I felt Abby's. Even with tears streaming wildly down his face,

Affleck's portrayal of Buddy felt cold, insincere and ineffective. Maybe it was the lying that got to me.
Maybe I thought Affleck should have displayed more re-

filled his words with more than the knowledge that he
was being paid to play the part. Or maybe I was just frustrated
with the character's inability to own up to his part in Abby's
husband's death. Maybe I just wanted him not to mess things
up, knowing that his lies would surely impede anything resembling true love that could develop between the two of them.
In any case, Affleck didn't do it for me. He sobbed, and I
wanted to kick him in the teeth. He professed his love, and I
wanted to ball it up and shove it down his throat. Whereas
when Gwyneth simply smiled or, rather, forced her sweet smile
over tears, standing in silent strength whileher boys yelled at
and cried to her, I could feel Abby's jumbled emotions pouring
from the screen.
So she's got bad hair, I thought, rising from my seat. But at
least the lady knows how to cry. And a good cry can carry a

Short Fiction. "The Complete Saki," by H. H.
Munro. Wicked humor and a compact style mark the
very brief stories of Munro, who was killed in World
War I (Saki was his pseudonymous alter-ego). They're
like extremely funny potato chips: it's difficult to stop
with just one.
History. "Parting the Waters," by Taylor Branch. A
historian of the first rank, Branch writes so vividly
and with such copious detail that he allows the reader
to almost see the events of the early Civil Rights Movement, a period of time between 1954-63. Lesser-known
personalities like Bob Moses, Bayard Rustin and John
Lewis spring to life alongside the more exalted Martin Luther King, Jr. For those of us who didn't live
through those years and even those who did this
book should be required reading.
Poetry. "Cemetery Nights," by Stephen Dobyns.
Dobyns has a trick of beginning a poem in a manner
that is laugh-out-loud funny, then turning around at
the last minute and delivering a swift knockout punch
in the last five lines. The collection is worth buying
for the poem "Spiritual Chickens" alone.
Mystery. "The Raphael Affair" and five other novels, by lain Pears. This series of charming mysteries
revolves around a slightly untidy English art historian and two members of the Italian art squad, a subset of the police force that deals with crimes involving art. Murder, forgery and theft are naturally the
order of the day. The plots are very neat, but Pears'

skill with one-liners is what lands this series on my

permanent gift list.

Stewart. Stewart is an updated version of the fifth
Beatle; he was a drummerfor the British group Gen-

esis, but threw it all away to shear sheep. Later, he
moved, practically on a whim, to a bare-bones farmhouse in Andalusia, Spain. How he found time to write
this book while simultaneously being a full-time
farmer and trying to settle in to the local life is beyond me, but we're lucky he did.
Children's. "Swallows and Amazons," by Arthur
Ransome. Neither the first nor the last in the genre of
children's literature best described as "resourceful

children on their own in the wilderness," Ransome's
series is surely at the genre's pinnacle. A lake in the
north ofEngland serves as the setting for holiday sailing and camping adventures from the 19305. The first
seven of his twelve "Swallows" novels have been recently reprinted in American editions.
Finally, I want to recommend that you simply read
volumes ofletters. Like poetry or short stories, they
offer the chance for a swift glance into an author's
writing; like long narratives, volumes ofletters give a
larger picture of a person's life. Before we lost the talent for letters Gong before e-mail, the telephone did it
in), Virginia Woolf, Tennessee Williams, John Keats,
Jane Austen, and uncounted ordinary Joes sat down
on a daily or weekly basis to write pages of impeccable prose. It's hard to discount the sinful thrill of
overhearing private conversations.
I hope you all find plenty of time for non-school
reading over winter break these books and others.

THE PHOENIX

Before

construction on the new Science Center begins this
summer, faculty and administrators may be forced to
make cuts that would endanger core features of the program, according to faculty representatives of the Science Center User's Group.
The current estimated cost for construction and renovation
is $4B million, well over the $43 million to $44 million budget.
Before construction begins this summer, the price tag for the
Science Center may be cut by $3 million or more. While Vice

President of Facilities Larry Schall said the Board of Managers may increase the budget, he added, "Our hope is to move it

to under $45 [million]." '
That could pose major problems for the User's Group, which,
according to faculty representatives, has already cut almost
everything possible from the Science Center without adversely
affecting the core spaces
classrooms, labs and offices.
"I think we've already cut the things that were able to be
cut without eliminating program," said professor Paul Rablen,
the chemistry representative on the User's Group. According
to Rablen, chemistry will be operating with very little breathing room the moment it moves into the new Science Center.
The department originally was slated to lose 50 percent of its

research space and had to fight just to keep their current space.
Physics is facing a similar problem: they get no overflow
lab space, but may soon be hiring another full-time faculty
member, meaning that their research space will be inadequate
before the building is built. "If we want to hire another faculty
member, we're in trouble," said physics representative and
professor Michael Brown. "And everyone is."
According to computer science professor and representative Lisa Meeden, "Ultimately, to have the best building, it
should be a bigger building."
Overflow offices are scarce, overflow labs even scarcer, and
with complaints of offices being too small, there is a strong
current of opinion thatthe new Science Center needs to be bigger. This doubt is only strengthened when the issue of population growth is included. The college has been growing, and with
the construction of a new dorm to add beds to campus, a bigger
Swarthmore could be a headache for the Science Center.
Professor Amy Vollmer, the biology representative to the
User's Group, felt that "if the population of the school is rising,
I think we'd need a completely new building." '

Faculty representatives see few places
where cuts can be made without cutting into
program space, and even these items have
strong support. One of the main items up for
eliminationis the excavation of physics' basement, which makes up a large part of their
total lab space. Brown said, "It's still in the
program and we think it's very important."
By not excavating, physics' basement will
have very small windows at the very top of
the rooms. Yet this feature only adds $162,000
to the cost of the building, still leaving several million dollars in cuts.
According to Rablen, another feature that
indidoesn't compromise square footage
vidualthermostatic control for each office and
lab could also very well be cut. But such a
measure would trim only $lOO,OOO from the
budget.

These cuts come after a year-long saga of
price increases and "value engineering"—the
industry term for cost-cutting. The college's
vision was brought into focus in the summer
of 1999, when the User's Group met regularly
to hash out departmental needs. What had
originally started as a limited, concentrated
effort to improve facilities, particularly chemistry labs, grew into a full-scale rethinking of
science space. Biology was included in renovationplans, the size of offices and labs grew,
and a science commons, fashioned after
Kohlberg's lounge, was added.
Several months and several design steps
later, Schall received quite a scare when the
first cost estimates came back. While initial
cost estimates were based on simple dollar per
square foot calculations, these more detailed
figures both came in well over the $39 million
previously budgeted for construction and
renovation. But the real surprise came when
the figures were compared against eachother:
the independent firm estimated a much higher
cost than the architects. Much, much higher.
According to Schall, the two firms' estimates were "tens ofmillions of dollars apart."
Biology professor and User's Group Co-Chair

Rachel Merz recalled how the Group was
"smacked in the face withthese numbers that
were really stunning." Suddenly, the feasibility of the entire project was cast into doubt.
But as it turned out, the firm that was tens

Claire Weiss For The Phoenix

of millions higher miscalculated severely, and
after a period of reconciliation between the
two numbers, a finalized estimate was produced. Construction and renovation were to
cost $5l million, about $l2 million more than
the $39 millionbudget. After discussions with
Al Bloomand the Board of Managers, the budget was raised to between $43 million and $44
million, still nearly $8 million short of the cost
estimate. Cost-cutting was unavoidable.
So, during the early months of 2000, the
Science Center lost many ofits quirkiest features, and a few practical ones, too. The landscape stair that would overlook the Crum and
the underground tunnel connecting Cornell
and Martin both disappeared. Also gone was
a chunk of basement space, with mechanical
systems being moved to the roof. Flooring,
exterior materials and classroom layout were
all changed to lower the costs.

This spring's cuts saved the project a total
ofabout $3 million, bringing the cost to $4B million, still $4 million to $5 million over budget.
The budget stillstands at the $4B million mark.
With extensive cuts already made, and almost every square foot of the Science Center
maximizedfor cost efficiency, many representatives are concerned that cuts will have to
be made to the core program spaces in order
to bring the project under budget.
According to Schall, a wildcard in the process that could work to the school's advantage
is contingency money. About $8 millionhasbeen
set aside as a buffer against unforseen costs from
the architects, construction companies or inflation. With the architects'jobs almost complete,
a large chunk ofthis money could soon be freed
and
up. But how much money there will be
where it will go
is still undecided, leaving
the extent of the upcoming cuts in doubt.

Science Center construction to last until 2005
BY BRENDAN

With

KARCH

construction not slated to finish
until winter 2004-2005, only those
current first-year students who stay
for a fifth year will be able to appreciate a completed Science Center. The rest of us can expect minor headaches and a major eyesore
without the reward of a finished building.
Much of upper campus, including half of
the Kohlberg-DuPont quad and the entire
rugby field, will give way to construction
materials and equipment. Pedestrian traffic
will be rerouted to accommodate construction.

Departments will be turned out of their current homes and moved into makeshift quarters, promising a space crunch.
Phasing, the official term for arranging departmental moves, has been a slow-moving and
somewhat contentious issue among faculty.
Because of the construction timeline, physics
and math must move out and then back into
renovated space, while chemistry and com-

puter science stay put until their new homes
are ready. Chemistry makes out best, being the
main beneficiary of new construction and the
first to move into new space, but losing research space during renovation. While the in-

equity in terms of inconvenience has not led
to outright envy, those who will be dislocated
longest are concerned about where they will
move to and how that space will be created.
Demolition of the math wing and the
DuPont Lecture Hall is scheduled for this summer, and as of yet, no makeshift home has
been set up for the math department, which
will be displaced until the completion of the
project in late 2004.
User's Group Co-Chair and biology professor Rachel Merz suggested the department

demolished. A new 200-seat lecture
hall will be put up in the same spot as
the old one, but will extend into the
upper-campus quad a little more. A
new, two-story chemistry wing will be
built where the math wing currently
exists.
■ A new 2000-square-foot science
commons with a balcony will be built
between Cornell and Dupont. It will
connect the science library with the
lecture hall and is intended to be a
social center that is a science
counterpart to the Kohlberg Coffee
Bar. Food will be offered.
■ The rest of DuPont the physics
and chemistry wings, and the
research annex in the rear of the
building —will be renovated, with
math moving into the first floor of
chemistry's vacated space and
computer science moving into the
second floor. Computer science will
receive significant increases in
space, including a second computer
lab to complement their current Sun
lab. The vacated space in Sproul is
expected to be used as office space.
■ In addition to the 200-seat lecture
hall, an 80-seat lecture hall will be
built in the new chemistry wing. The
new wing will also hold one 50-seat,
one 40-seat and one 30-seat
classrooms. The physics wing will
have one 40-seat classroom, and the
math wing will have a 30-seat and a
24-seat classroom. A 24-seat
"commons" classroom will be built
adjacent to the 200-seat lecture hall.
Most departments will have their own
seminar room and lounge space.
■ Astronomy will have a telescope
installed in a new third-floor
observatory, to be placed on top of
the chemistry wing.

CORNELL
■ Cornell will be integrated with
DuPont by virtue of the science
commons, but access will be from
hallways only.
■ A new two-story complex is being

built in front of Cornell; the first floor
will hold two 40-seat classrooms, one
of which is expected to eventually
serve as a computer classroom. The
second floor of the new construction
will house biology labs.
■ A second-story walkway will
connect Martin and Cornell.

MARTIN
■ Martin's main renovation is
centered around Kirby Lecture Hall
and the ground-floor lab space
beneath it. Kirby will be split up into a
new departmental office, seminar
room and lounge space, and the lab

space beneath will be renovated.

Biology will also get student research
labs and a new microscopy suite.

renovation of the current structure.
At that point chemistry will move into
its new home, and physics will move out of
its old wing. The physics department's destination remains unknown, but it must find
a considerable amount of free laboratory
space.

Physics professor Frank Moscatelli is
especially worried that "planning has gone
a little too slowly," adding, "There's no plan

at the moment [for] where to put [physics]."
Martin could also be feelinga crunchfor

both Kirby and DuPont lecture halls will be
renovated during spring 2003, creating a possiblepinch for large classroom spaces.
Renovation of the current physics and
chemistry wings will take about 18 months,
and construction equipment may not be
cleared until the end of the 2004-2005 academic year. If the timeline is followed, math,
computer science and physics can expect to
move into theirrenovated space in time for
the spring 2005 semester.
Math will occupy the first floor of
DuPont's rear corridor, and computer science will get the second, while physics will
stay put in their current wing. All told, four
departments will move six times. That is
not counting, of course, the endless rerout-

ing of student traffic during those threeand-a-half years or the extra distance students may be trudging to get to their pro-

fessors' offices.
"I think everyone on this campus is going to be miserable to one extent or another during construction," math professor Thomas Hunter said.

Bird watching

Strong showing for
frisbee at tourney
BY TIMOTHY KOBAYASHI
Snaking its way across campus, the wind rustled
through the trees of Swarthmore College. Stalking
its favorite prey, the wind searched high and low for
the 175-gram Frisbees that would normally be flying
through the air. During the weekend of Nov. 11
however, the wind passed silently over Mertz Field,
disrupting not a single throw. Where could the flying
discs be? The wind blew its way south along 1-95,
passing though four states before finding what it
was looking for.
Swat's Ultimate teams packed into a van last
Friday night and began a long trek down to North
Carolina. Bright and early the next day, the
Earthworms and Warmothers took to the field.
Seeded fourth in their pool, the Worms beat their
first two opponents but lost to the third, North
Carolina State University (NCSU).
Now ranked second in the pool, the Worms
advanced to the championship pool. In the first
game, Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 valiantly laid out for a
disc, almost knocking over the tournament director
in the process. The biggest insult to any team at the
tournament at that time was, "You're tied with

Swarthmore!"
Unfortunately, UNC-Wilmington decided not to
remain tied with Swat, and pulled ahead to a tight
13-10 victory. The Worms, however, turned the
tables, edging their next two opponents 13-10. The
last game deserves special note, as it was against
Georgia, which is known to have a top-notch
Ultimate team.
The next day, seeded fourth among the
remaining eight teams, the Worms faced off
against NCSU again. Worms captain Matt Murphy
'Ol completed multiple hucks downfield to Collin
Peng-Sue 'O3 repeatedly for the score.
On defense, however, the Worms could not keep
up with the fast-paced style of NCSU. While
defending a NCSU player in the end zone, Brandon
Silverman 'Ol another Worm captain, failed to
defend the disc. So bad was the defense that the
NCSU player "showed" Brandon the disc. This
means wiping the disc down the back of the
defender, something that Brandon knows a lot
about.

Misha Horowitz 'O3 said, "Overall, I believe that

impressively well, despite the intensely stiff
competition among my fellow collegiate athletes."
The Warmothers also did their share of sending
other teams home early during the tournament.
After stomping the University of Pennsylvania first
thing out of the vans, the Moms lost 13-6 to
Georgia Tech.
After taking out their aggression on the poor
Disco team that had to suffer their loss in front of
their parents, the Moms went head-to-head with
the University of Georgia team. The University of
Georgia women, both "very good and collectively
very beautiful," squeaked out a victory only after
the game was hard-capped.
After a first-round bye the next day, the Moms
played against the University of Virginia in the
quarterfinals. UVA finally pulled ahead after a close
game to win 12-8. Captains liana Luft 'O3, Alyssa
Bell 'O3 and Sarah Stanton 'O3 all played "hardcore style" while Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol and Jenny
Hoedeman 'Ol played huge defense and offense.
The Warmother rookies, Alison Landrey 'O4, Ay
Jy Phoun 'O4, Michelle Lo 'O4, Rebecca Van Fleet
'O3 and Laurel Eckhouse 'O3, played with the skill
and dexterity of veterans. Pat Hard 'Ol the captain
of the NCSU team, was considered the hero of

many a Warmom.
Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 was pleased with the
showing Swat women put on at the Eastern
Collegiates. "We played very well together as a
team and it showed," she said.

Young players
provide spark
BY ANNA MASILELA

Garnet extends winning
streak to four games

The Swarthmore men's basketball team is
young, but the new players are already emerging to
take charge of the team. Despite its youth, the
team nearly pulled out victories in recent weeks
against tough opposition, falling only in overtime to
Gwynedd Mercy and Bates and playing Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute even for a half.
"There's a lot of pressure on the shoulders of
the younger guys, but they're playing right up
against our opponents," said captain Eli Silk 'Ol
Off guard David Pearce 'O3 has led the team in
scoring, averaging 17.8 points per game. Last
week, he was named to the Centennial Conference
honor roll for his play during the Equinox Classic.
Zack Ellison 'O4 has also been a solid scorer, while
point guard Jacob Letendre 'O4 has been dishing
out the ball with skill.
Swat suffered a 98-41 loss to Division I Lehigh
University on Nov. 28, bringing the overall record to
0-5. The Garnet were unable to match the
Mountain Hawks' outside shooting and three
players over 6'10".
At the end of the first half of Swat's game
against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) on
Nov. 25, both teams were in a dead heat at 34
points. RPI, however, pulled ahead in the second
half and Swat ended up with a 78-63 loss. Eran
Ganot 'O3 and Pearce led the team with 17 and 16
points, respectively. Ganot also grabbed nine
boards.

"WE'RE SET ON TURNING THE
PROGRAM AROUND IN THE NEXT
COUPLE OF YEARS"

Swat lost its second overtime game to
Gwynedd Mercy College on Nov. 21 83-80. The
team came out strong but later allowed Gwynedd
Mercy to pull ahead. "It just went down to the wire
on that one and we ended up the losing team,"
said Letendre, who contributed a solid 43
minutes, tallying 14 points, 5 assists and 3 steals.
Chris Loeffler 'O4 tallied a double-double, scoring
16 points and snatching 19 rebounds. Pearce
scored 19 while Ganot made the most of his
opportunities, putting in 16 points on 6 of 9
shooting.

The 101-97 loss to Bates on Nov. 18 was
another overtime heartbreaker. Swarthmore
picked up the pace in the second half, rallying to
send the game into overtime. Two sophomores
posted career-best point totals: Pearce, with 29
points, and Ganot, with 19. Ellison scored 25,
including 4 treys, and Letendre came out with 16
points and six assists. On Nov. 11 in the first game
of the Equinox Classic, Swat lost to LaVerne, 87-70,
despite 20 points from Pearce.
While the week was frustrating for the Garnet,
it was encouraging that they were able to stay in
game against good teams. With such a young
nucleus, the team expected to struggle early
while young players learned the system and
developed chemistry with one another. First-year
players like Zach Ellison, Chris Loeffler and Jacob
Letendre have stepped up and played well in the
absence of several upperclassmen who are not
available to head coach Lee Wimberly this
semester.

"We're real young and real small and that's
hard on us right now," said Letendre, "but we're
set on turning the program around in the next
couple of years."
Swarthmore will play the team's first Centennial
Conference game of the season at Western
Maryland on Friday.

Rookie discovers
value of sports to
Swat experience
BY ANNA MASILELA

I played soccer for the first time this
season, and I amazed myself, for I had
never considered myself an athlete. Being
part of a team truly gave me a new
perspective. First and foremost, I formed
close bonds with a group that I otherwise
might have dismissed out of hand as "not

After crushing Ursinus with a women's win of 112-69 and men's
win of 106-59, the Garnet Tide splashed things up with the Washington and Lee Generals on Nov. 18. At the start of the meet, the
women took both first and second places in the 400-meter medley
relay. This event set the winning tone for the remainder of the
meet, with the women's team making numerous sweeps. Most
notably, Amy Auerbach 'O2 won both distance events (1000-meter
free with a time of 11:12.81 and 500-meter free with a time of 5:27.74)
and swam a leg of the winning 400-meter free relay.
The men's team, with a 131-73 loss to the Generals, was not as
fortunate. Although Jason Kerensky 'O3 was just touched out of
first place of the 100-meter free by eleven-hundredths of a second
(50.87), he swam a strong leg of the men's 400-meter free relay,
contributing to a second-place finish in a time of3:36.17. All-American Ted Sherer 'Ol was a double winner in the 200-meter individual medley (2:04.28) and the 200-meter breast (2:19.97).
On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the GarnetTide women were able to crank
out a 120-85 win against Widener. Despite Widener's strong firstyear class of swimmers, the Garnet women were victorious in
nine out of 11 events. Natalie Briones 'O3 had an outstanding swim

in the 200-meter individualmedley with a national 'B' cut time of
2:13.50. Julie Corder'O3 swam a 100-meter free personal best (1:08.74)
for a leg of the 400-meter medley relay.
The men's team suffered a heart-wrenchingly close loss, 107.597.5, to Widener. The meet, which came down to the very last event,
was both exciting and full of surprises. After swimming neck to
neck for 20 laps of the pool, JohnLillvis 'O3 tied the 500-meter free
with a time of 5:03.22. First-time swimmer Nii Addy 'O2 swam an
outstanding race in the 100-meter free with a personal best time
of 56.06. First-year swimmer Jesse Hartigan 'O4 dropped a whopping 45 seconds from his time three days before at the Washington and Lee Meet, swimming the race in 3:09.62.
"Widener, with a team full of new swimmers, pushed our team
to swim faster times in close races," said assistant coach Claire
Arbour 'OO. "Once again, Swat posted several best times, as well
as fast races in general."
The women are now 3-1 and the men are 1-3. The teams will swim
against Western Maryland on Saturday at 2 p.m. in the Ware Pool.
Head Coach Sue Davis was unable to attendboth the Washington and Lee and Widener meets after an equestrian accident. Assistant coaches Arbour, Leisha Schaffer, Charlie Kennedy, and
Patricia Flynn will step in to guide the teams in Davis' absence.

Thankfully, I took the chance. Now I
have a friend who's an organic chemistry
fanatic and another who sews beautiful
dresses. I found that the team was
composed of distinctly unique individuals,
yet everyone immediately accepted me,
the most rookie-ish rookie ever, as a part
of the team.
Before I came to Swarthmore College, I
had never played for a sports team before.
In fact, there was only one time when I
participated in a team sport. In fourth
grade, I played one game of soccer during
recess. I ran down the field, scored a
single goal and felt amazing.
Needless to say, soccer turned out to
be somewhat more complex in college. I
had expected to learn how to charge down
the field, pushing defenders out of the
way, and slam in a goal. Instead, I learned
how to find deep angles and communicate
with teammates. Well, I tried to learn
when you have no idea how to dribble the
ball without looking down at your feet to
make sure it's still there, glancing around
and locating good passing opportunities
becomes a little harder.
Every person who comes to
Swarthmore expects to try something
outside their expertise, whether it's
hosting a radio show or protesting
globalization or taking the course "In
Search of Reality." Well, I also wanted to
try an activity that, although old hat to
some, was a new experience for me.
I am glad that I took the opportunity to
jump into soccer at the very beginning of
my freshman year because I fear that had
I waited, I might have never ended up
doing it. Sports can seem like a very poor
allocation of time and money at
Swarthmore, and the wind of public
opinion might have swayed me from them.
The more undesirably sports are
portrayed, the more ingrained the
stratification between athletes and nonathletes at our school becomes.
Eventually, the only people participating
will be recruits slotted for that purpose,
with their isolation serving to reinforce the
stereotypes, both within their minds and in
the Swarthmore community. There will be
neither room nor acceptance for people
like myself who just want to try something
new.
Each student has an opportunity to
sample the many experiences the
campus has to offer, and sports should
be accorded the same status and respect
as any of the other activities available.
The whole point of being in college is
trying new things with different people.
Why should sports be treated any
differently?

NO HOLDS
BARRED

You can't go home again

A blazing start

I had a pretty interesting break. Besides outrageous consumption and gluttony, I also found out my hometown ain't
what it used to be. First off, upon returning to town, I read
about how our football team, state champions whenI played
for them, was on the verge of finishing an 0-11 season where
they broke records for the most points allowed.
Then I found out that they cancelled all middle-school
dances for therest ofyear because of promiscuous dancing.
WHAT?! My sister is in themiddle school, so this freaks me
out. Probably what freaks me out most, though, is how
greatly this differs from my recollection of middle school,
where crossing the side ofthe room to the girls' side was as
dangerous as a crossing pattern with Chuck Ceciland Ronnie
Lott at safety. I mean, ifyou gave me a choice between a tour
of duty in Vietnam or reliving the gut-wrenching awkwardness of seventh and eighth grades, I'd have you hand me a
M-16 and ship me off tomorrow.
Every time I go home, it's a reminder that things just
aren't the same anymore. At first, I was very pleased when
I got home andfound Boston Bruins tickets waiting for me.
I've been away at school, so I haven't been at the
Fleet Center for a game since its inaugural season replacing
the legendary Boston Garden. I may not ever go back again.

First off, theBruins and Celtics are terrible and my children's
children will probably be dust before they are championship caliber again. The Bruins, in fact, are abominable. They
don't hit, they don't pass well and all of their defensemen
are Scandinavian players who are used tobig rinks andwideopen spaces. In other words, they play like Harry & David
fruitcakes. All of their supporting players seemed to be
named Kukklakaken and wear a number in the 60s. We lost
to the Carolina Hurricanes, the team formerly known as

the Hartford Whalers.

Hometown teams softer than Charmin' don't help, but

one of thereal losses is the difference between theFleetCenter

and the old Boston Garden. Look, if I was born ten years
later, I probably wouldn'tbe a sports fan at all. Whathooked
mewas going to Fenway and the Garden as a kid. Man, when
the games got close, the place would get so loud the floor

wouldrattle. You would swear the whole place was about to
fall over. It'd get up to 95 degrees in there and you wouldn't
care. The subway would pass through North Station and
you could swear it was a 7.5 on the Richter scale.
I sat in the luxury club seats at the FleetCenter. Hell, my
ticket was embossed with gold foil. I ordered an Italian Sausage, the same thing I've ordered at every Celtics or Bruins
game I've ever been to. You used to get a ton of onions on
your sausage, sizzling hot off a cart. Now the carts are gone,
and so are the onions. It's no sausage if your girlfriend is

still willing to sit in the seat next to you.
Now a waitress punches your order into a contraption
not unlike a PalmPilot You choosebetween the Southwestern Fajita Wrap and the Shrimp Caesar Salad. Eventually, if
you squint enough, you can find the good stuff. It's too expensive. The waitress never leaves your view. Another
woman comes with your order within five minutes. Ah,

wireless.
You're reminded of it everywhere
Cellular One is
among the advertisers that invade each and every one of
your senses... as do seemingly a million other ads. Crappy
Eiffel 65 blaring through a sound system that's way too loud
has replaced the traditional organ tunes that fired the crowd
up. It's just not the same. There was nothing better than
seeing a Celtics game in the Garden, even in the post-Bird
era. And there's nothing better than going to Fenway. It's
not about comfort, it's about an aestheticand cultural experience. Find some other way to fix up an old stadium. People
are creative as hell these days and technology can do just
about everything.

Boston's considering building a new Fenway Park. To
thatI say, "Fuggedaboutit." The strongest argument against
it is thecharmless FleetCenter. Luxury is better than nothing, which is why you should tear down a hellhole wind
vortex like Veteran's Stadium, but you can't build tradition
and history. Let's hope history has taught us a lesson here.
Save Fenway.

Alison Furman goes for a lay-up in the women's basketball team's 72-9 rout of Bryn Mawr on Tuesday.

Women's basketball fires out of the starting
blocks, begins season with four lopsided wins
BY CAITLIN RYLAND AND EMILY GRAY
Women's basketball head coach Adrienne Shibles and
her crew of 11 ferocious court-mongers have been tearing
up the Tarble Pavilion in pre-conference play, shredding
opponents by large margins. In the 1999-2000 season,

Swarthmore women's hoops recorded a record number of
wins, crowned a Conference Player of the Year in Heather
Kile 'O2, and saw its first Centennial Conference Playoff
berth, among other remarkable accolades. They look well
on the road to repeating that type of season or topping it.
Shibles, in her fifth season at Swarthmore, is flanked by
assistant coaches Kira Cochran-Bond 'OO and Doug Rouse
'9B, two accomplished Swarthmore athletes. Building on
last year's success, the Garnet Tide fans can look forward
to some exciting play from rookie guards Katie Robinson
(Medfield, MA), Gretchen Heitz (Oakton, VA), and McKenna

Coll (Nazareth, PA). Rookie Jerusha Rodgers (Denver, CO)
will see significant time in the low post. Tri-captain Heather
Kile 'O2 said, "This class of first-years perfectly complements
what has proved to be an already talented squad of veteran
players."

The Tideswomen brought the house down in the third
annual Swarthmore Tip-Off Tournament with a well-rounded
rout over the Randolph-Macon Women's College 92-27. All 11
Garnet players scored in the victory. Kile and Sarah Tufano
'O3 combined for 31 points, shooting 14 for 18 from the floor.
Also logging in double figures were Alison Furman 'O3 and
Gretchen Heitz 'O4, with 13 and 11 points, respectively.
In the tournament championship game, the Garnet Tide
soundly defeated their next opponent, the Beaver Knights,
by a score of 82 to 54. Kile lead all scorers with 18 points and
16 rebounds. Tufano and Furman chipped in a solid 16 points
