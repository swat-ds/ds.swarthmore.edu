Intruder bypasses unlocked doors, threatens student
BY MARA REVKIN

mrevkinl@swarthmore.edu

At approximately 4:20 a.m. on Monday morning, an
unidentified intruder entered Willets dormitory, where he
opened a female student's unlocked door and threatened her
with what may have been a knife. According to a Public
Safety Awareness Bulletin that described the incident as an
sexual assault," the student had been sleeping at
the time of the intrusion but woke upon hearing her room
door close, at which point the suspect approached her bed.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal said that
the student screamed, prompting the suspect to flee the
scene immediately. According to Westphal, the entire interaction was over in a moment. "It happened very fast. The
student became aware pretty quickly that someone was in
her room. She yelled and ran," Westphal said.
According to the Awareness Bulletin, the victim notified
Public Safety immediately after the incident and described
the suspect as a 20-30 year old dark-complexioned male of
"medium to tall height, medium to stocky build, wearing
long jeans and a white tee shirt." Public Safety promptly
notified the Swarthmore Police and other local police departments, but a joint campus-wide search did not turn up any
individuals conforming to the profile provided by the victim.
Director ofPublic Safety Owen Redgrave said there has
been little progess in the case. "There have not been many
leads developed. We often hope that the Public Safety bulletin produces some witnesses and that hasn't been the case,
though it's still a bit early," Redgrave said.
The incident occurred at a time of heightened activity in
campus dormitories, as students hurried to move into their
rooms prior to the start of classes on Monday morning.

According to Willets basement Residential Assistant Loretta
Gary 'O9, many doors in Willets and other residential halls
were left propped open over the weekend to facilitate the
move-in process. "No one really paid attention to the fact
that doors were being left open, because so many people
were coming and going. But now we're going to have to deal
with the problem, for sure," Gary said.
On Monday morning, Westphal met with Gary and other
Willets RAs to discuss the incident and brainstorm strategies for improving the building's security, including the distribution of signs bearing the slogan, "Stop the prop."
Willets RAs warned students to be wary shortly after the
incident. "I sent an e-mail out to my kids to tell them to lock
their doors, to be careful," Willets RA Alvin Melathe 10 said.
In a follow-up email to the Public Safety bulletin, Dean of
Students Jim Larimore confirmed that the exterior locks to
Willets would be changed. "While that work is being completed, measures will be taken to direct access to Willets to
the main entrances which can be more easily monitored,"
Larimore said in the email. Larimore also urged students to
be proactive in ensuring that the campus is safe. "I ask that
you please report any doors or locks that are damaged or not

working properly to Workbox immediately," Larimore said
in the email. "Likewise, while it might inconvenience some
in the short term, please report 'or un-prop any exterior
doors that you notice being propped open or otherwise left
open with the locking mechanisms disabled."
Larimore recommended carrying keys and locking doors
to rooms, especially for those living on lower floors, and to
contact Public Safety if concerned about suspicious activity.
Redgrave agreed with Larimore's recommendations.
"One of the first tenets of security is to have locks and the
second tenet is that you use them," Redgrave said. "People
locking one's door and locking the outside doors to resident
halls is a significant step towards keeping things safer."
This is not the first security breach to occur at a transition time on campus. Monday's incident was reminiscent of
two separate intrusions that took place on the same-day,
August 28, 2006. On the Monday of the first week of classes
almost exactly two years ago, two apparently unrelated suspects stole a student's clothing from the Parrish laundry
room and pulled back a shower curtain on the fourth floor of
the building.
According to Westphal, intruders are more likely to enter
dormitories undetected during transitional periods such as
move-in weekend because of the unusual volume of unfamiliar students, siblings and parents "coming and going at
all hours of the day and night." At these chaotic times of
year, not only are students more likely to prop open the exterior entrances to dormitories; they also tend to leave the
doors to their individual rooms unlocked.
The latter situation is even more common in doubles
and triples, where "roommates can have totally different
opinions on the necessity of locking the door," Westphal
said. Some roommates fundamentally disagree on the
optimal level of security for their living space, "a point of
friction that reflects the variety of places students come
from," Westphal said. "I feel very safe at Swarthmore, but
if I came from a different environment, I might have different concerns about my personal safety and the security
of my belongings." According to Westphal, incidents such
as Monday's intrusion are rare on Swarthmore's campus,
"so when a case like this occurs, it is important and dra-

matic."
The magnitude of Monday's security breach may renew
calls for increased security measures like swipe card access
to dormitories, a request that students put forth last year in
discussions with administrators and board members concerning the college's long-term planning strategy. According
to Westphal, "[The administration] last considered implementing a swipe card system six or eight years ago, but at
the time the cost of installation was prohibitively expensive." Since then, however, the technology has become more
affordable and the administration "is definitely revisiting
the issue," Westphal said, adding that the deans "have
already started conversations to discuss the feasibility of a
swipe card system." Westphal acknowledged that the intr-

entrances to Willets on Monday morning.
duction of new technology can reduce the vulnerability of
dormitories in general, but it cannot prevent intruders from
targeting the campus community unless students take
responsibility for their own security and that of their peers.
"There are some fundamental things that students can do to
prevent this kind of activity, whether it is locking your own
room or asking the last person awake to check to make sure
an external door is secure," Westphal said.
Guaranteeing security in residential halls requires a
joint effort by students and administrators. "We as administrators have a responsibility to provide a safe environment,
but students also need to think of the community's safety
when they make individual decisions," Westphal said.
Westphal said she did not believe that increased vigilance in dormitories would undermine the atmosphere of
trust and mutual respect that the college strives to cultivate.
"There are so many other areas in which we are an open and
trusting community and I don't think those qualities are
going to be eroded by making an effort to be more aware of
our surroundings. I think that we are fundamentally safe
here, but that doesn't mean thatunsafe things can't happen.
This kind of incident just reminds us that the real world is
out there," Westphal said.

Hate crime on campus illuminates need for renewed dialogue
Along with disgust toward the racial

BY ALEX ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore.edu

An offensive message was left outside
the dorm room of a Palestinian student on
Monday. The student, who wishes to
remain anonymous, said that he discovered
the slur written on the whiteboard outside
his door at around nine in the morning.
He posted a request below the message
asking the author of the comment to come
discuss it with him, but the only response
he received was another offensive comment.

The student who was the target of this
attack feels that it was racially rather than
politically motivated. The comment did not
attack his viewpoints but his race: "This
was an attack on who I am, what I was born
into, who I'm proud to be," he said.
It also challenged his image of the
Swarthmore community. "It definitely
changed what I think of Swat. I'd never felt
this secure before, living in Palestine but
now I feel more threatened."

aspect of the act, many students reflected
on its significance in relation to the college.
"It just goes against everything the school
stands for, including having a meaningful

dialogue," Sven David Udekwu 'O9 said.

As part of Swarthmore's commitment to
this campus-wide dialogue on issues of
diversity, the Intercultural Center was
founded in 1992. Rafael Zapata, Assistant
Dean and Director of the IC, was appalled
by such an 'Atypical" display of discrimination at the school. "At Swarthmore, we do
not shy away from difficult situations, especially here at the IC. Differences of opinion
can be a wonderful opportunity for learning, as long as they're open and respectful,"
he said. "This kind of expression though is
cowardly, absolutely cowardly."
Some have used the term "hate crime" to
characterize this incident. In many ways it

resembles hate crimes that occurred several years ago, mainly targeting homosexual
students on campus, as documented in
"Sager fund turns 20 with 'Boundaries of

Queer,'" in the March 27,2008 edition ofThe
Phoenix. While hate crimes of that sort
have since become much less prevalent,
many have said that racism against people
from the Arab world, and particularly
against Palestinians, has received less
attention on campus than other forms of
discrimination.
Sarah Brajtbord 'll is one of the
founders of Free Palestine, a new student
group on campus. Referring to the political
controversy between Palestine and Israel
she said that "the dialogue on these issues
has been really quiet, almost non-existent.
We've been trying to get the conversation
going again. There's been a pretty strong
influence of pro-Israeli groups recently.
What has been said has been pretty onesided."
While acknowledging that the IsraeliPalestine topic is not discussed as often as it
should be, Zapata said, "Some of the most
compelling dialogue has come from within
the Jewish community." While many students expressed their horror at this kind of

September 4, 2008

intolerance at Swarthmore, some thought it
might have been a drunken joke, especially
given that the comment was probably written in the early hours of Monday morning.
Joking or not, the comment left many
appalled. "It is a big deal. Whether he [the
author of the slur] thought it was amusing
or not, it was hateful," Rayan Khan 'lO said.
Along with the attempted assault of a
female student living in Willets, many students are finding their impression of the
security and openness of the Swarthmore
community being challenged. "Coming into

Swarthmore you don't expect that kind of

thing," Augusta Christensen 'll said.
Others were less surprised by a show of
discrimination at Swarthmore. "It doesn't
surprise me at all. This is a place where if
you deviate from the accepted thought, you
will be discriminated against. Yeah we all
look different, but after a while you hear

people saying the same things," Shaun
Kelly 10 said. "In a place that puts so much
emphasis on ideas, diversity of thought has
definitely been lacking."

Presidential search committee reaches out to campus
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

The College's search for a new President continues to
advance as the committee reaches out to a broader academic and administrative community. After two meetings, hours
of communication and hundreds of e-mails, the presidential
search committee developed an advertisement seeking candidates for the presidency which will be published in the
Chronicle of Higher Education on September 5. The advertisement will also run in a diverse array of other publications, including Women in Higher Education, Hispanic
Outlook, Diverse Issues in Higher Educations, and The
Economist in an effort to reach out to a spectrum of potential candidates.
"We've placed an advertisement in a bunch of different
publications that will help publicize the position, and we're
working on the exact position specifications that we'll be
sending out," chair of the presidential search committee
Tom Spock '7B said.
"So typically what will happen is it will take a couple of
months for people to figure out that the job is open, to think
about it a little bit. Certainly we will be contacting certain
people who have been nominated and encouraging them to
apply. During the fourth quarter of the year, we will be in the
business of narrowing down the list and interviewing semifinalists," Spock said.
Although the committee does not yet have specific qualifications for a candidate, it is seeking individuals of diverse
backgrounds to apply. "Most people will read the Chronicle
of Higher Education but we wantto bring in a diverse crew,"
history professor Pieter Judson said. Judson is one of three
faculty members serving on the presidential searchcommit-

tee.

Last year, President Al Bloom announced his intent to
resign from his position after an 18-year tenure. Chair of the
Board of Managers Barbara Mather '65, who will be working
with the presidential search committee, sent an e-mail in
June calling for members of the Swarthmore community to
both nominate candidates and contribute their opinions
regarding the search.
The presidential search committee, formed at the end of
the past academic year, is the group charged with recom-

mending a single candidate for the presidency. Headed by
Chair of the Finance Committee and Board of Managers
member Thomas E. Spock 78, the committee is comprised of
representatives of the major constituents of the college community: alumni, students, faculty, and staff. Four alumni
including Spock, three faculty members, one staff member,
and two students serve as the official liaisons between the
committee and the broader college community.
Initially, the committee focused on compiling as much
information as possible from the college community in order
to produce an overview of the kinds of qualifications and
values they look for in an appropriate future president,
explained Lauren Stokes 'O9 and AaronSchwartz 'O9, the two
student representatives on the committee.
So far, the primary medium for doing so has been
through e-mail. The committee will also be hosting a fireside
chat also on Friday, September sth in Kohlberg coffee bar at
7:30 p.m. to gauge student concerns regarding the next pres-

ident.

Spock reported that the presidential search committee is
making progress. "It's been great meeting everybody on the
committee, and it's honestly been fun. I've certainly really
enjoyed it, and we've been educating ourselves about how
these searches usually go, what the process is, what the general expectations are out in the marketplace for people interested in these jobs. And we've been working with Shelly

well-known
search
consultant."
& Associates, according
to the new
Swarthmore Presidential Search website developed by
Director of Communications Nancy Nicely and the News
and Information Office, is a "minority-and female-owned
retained executive search firm."
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '7l is not directly
involved in the presidential search, but he is optimistic
about the progress made so far. "It's a good beginning," he
said. "What I'd really like to see is what [the committee] published] as the kind of fuller description of the college and
what they're looking for, what we are in effect looking for,
and because that's going to come from input from various
constituencies... I haven't seen that yet. That's what I'd really like to see," he said.
The wider college community as well as potential candidates for the presidency will be able to track the progress of
Storbeck,

Storbeck/Pimental

the search through the new website. The site provides a general timeline for the search process and relevant documents,
and will be continually updated. It also provides a background of Swarthmore's past presidents and a history of the
college. A feature of the site allows visitors to nominateindividuals they believe would be good candidates as well as
make suggestions. Most significantly for Eldridge, the website ensures transparency in the process of selecting the next
president. "I'm glad to see the website," Eldridge said. "That
promises there will be more information and there will be
transparency to this process."
One area of the search process will necessarily remain
confidential. "A lot of the people we hope will apply for this
position... will need absolute... confidentiality," Spock said.
"When it comes down to the exact identity of semifinalists
and finalists, we are going to have to be extremely confidential or else we are going to lose candidates."
After a certain point, it will be difficult for the committee
to predict the course of the search. "It gets hard to predict
because you don t know how strong the pool will be,
although early indications from the consultant are that it's
very strong and doing very well for this early in the
process," Spock said, "but we'll only know as we get into
December or November how many semi-finalists we'll actually identify and how many individuals will actually make
the short-list for campus visits and additional interviews
and so on. Certainly it is everybody's hope and expectation
that in the first quarter of next year this decision will be
made."
According to Eldridge, the committee has invited members of the Al Bloom's senior staff to meet with the search
consultant, the chair of the committee and the chair of the
board to get their individual takes on what they're looking
for. "People who are in the senior staffdon't really get a hand
in choosing their own boss," Eldridge said.
As far as the senior staff knows at this point, there is
unlikely to be a major change in administration when the
new president takes over. Nor does Eldridge anticipate
major changes to the college in the next few years. "We've
been going through a planning process which is really an
attempt to try to anticipate to some degree what the future
will bring and what we need to do to meet that future. I think
that the core of who we are is pretty clear," Eldridge said.

Changes to first-year orientation schedule spur IC/BCC debate
-BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
First-year orientation is always a prime
opportunity for student groups to reach out
to potential new members of their communities. A change in the orientation schedule
this year and a communication breakdown,
however, spurred a controversy within the

Intercultural Center and Black Cultural
Center communities that resulted in an
impromptu open house on the Saturday of
orientation and a discussion on the role of
the orientation as a time for student affinity
groups to let first-years know of the diverse
communities available to them on campus.
The primary relevant change in the orientation schedule involved cutting the individual group meetings that the Intercultural
Center groups and the Black CulturalCenter
have traditionally held during orientation
week. Assistant Coordinator of Student
Activities Paury Flowers said the decision to
do so was purely logistical, and not motivated by any desire to give preferential treatment to any particular group over the other.
Rather, she hoped to level the playing field
for all student organizations in their efforts
to reach out to first-years. Also responsible
for creating the orientation guide, she hoped
that cutting down on events would produce
a more streamlinedand readable document.
"For individual student groups, the first
time that I want them to have that connection is when it's fair to everyone, and that's
at the activities [fair]," Flowers said.
"Instead of giving specific individual groups
a space in the schedule, we decided to support open houses with direct connections to
the dean's office folks."

4

Without any kind of explanation as to
why their groups did not have individual
meetings during the orientation as they had
in years past, several leaders of the student
affinity groups responded with confusion
and shock upon arriving at Swarthmore.
"Initially I was just really surprised and
confused. Then shocked and angry," Sable
Mensah 'll said. "I was unclear as to why
they were cut and I was a little bit confused
as to why I hadn't heard about it," Cecilia
Marquez 11 said. Mensah and Marquez areboth leaders in the IC/BCC community.
Some initially perceived the exclusion of
the student affinity groups as a precursor of
a.gradual withdrawal of institutional support for diversity groups on campus. "What
might have seemed like a smallincident felt
very large for those of us in the IC/BCC community," Marquez said.
A particular point of contention was the

inclusion of the Women's Resource Center
barbecue in the schedule. A student representative from the WRC sent a request by email to Flowers on Aug. 11 to ensure that the
group would have a barbecue during orientation. "I sent the e-mail to Paury Flowers
because the WRC
is making a big effort
this year to reach out to the Swarthmore
community and we believed that a good way
to do that was to host an event that would
introduce the WRC to incoming freshmen
who may be interested in getting involved,"
Kristin Caspar 'O9 said in an e-mail. "I
requested] if the WRC could host an event
for orientation and I was then directed to a
member of the orientation board. From
there it was very simple and we were put in
the list of events," she said in an e-mail.
Flowers did not receive similar written
...

requests from leaders of other groups over
the summer. Had they done that, Flowers

said, she would have directed them either to
the activities fair as the first point of contact
or suggested they do some kind of open
house which is what they eventually did.
In a spontaneous move, leaders of several
IC/BCC groups met in Sharpies to discuss a
course of action. They decided to e-mail
Flowers stating their concerns and requesting institutional support for an impromptu
open house, Marquez said. They also stated
their intentions to inform first-years of the
open house with flyers and an announcement at the end of the diversity workshops.
When leaders of the WRC found out that
the IC/BCC groups wouldn't be able to have
their meetings, they considered canceling
their event. "We were ready to cancel our
meeting in solidarity with the IC/BCC community," Dina Kopansky 'll, a member of the
WRC board, said. Once the IC/BCC groups
organized their open house, the WRC decided to keep the barbecue. WRC board members spoke withthe Dean of the WRC, Karen
Henry, and Flowers, both of whom were
-

really responsive, Kopansky said. "The
deans immediately saw that there was a big
problem with what was going on," she said.
Flowers responded by supporting the
affinity group leaders' plan to organize the
open house. She sent an e-mail to the class of
2012 informing them of the upcoming event,
and also sent an e-mail to several affinity
group leaders explaining her motives for
removing the individual meetings from the
schedule. "What was missing from [the]
equation was communication. I never minded that any group organized special meetings or events during the week. I just didn't

September 4, 2008

want to support some and not others," she
said in the e-mail. "Granted, with 20/20 hindsight having removed the meetings, I could
have had a talk withRafael about hosting an
Open House but believe me and I'm sure
he'll attest in the few times we encountered
each other there were many other things
that needed to be discussed and the thought
didn't cross my mind," she said in the email. Planning for the first-year orientation
begins an entire year in advance.
"The bottom line is your feelings were
valid given that you had no information or
communication from me or anyone else to
go on," she said in the e-mail.
Regardless of communication issues,
Marquez and Mensah believe that the individual affinity group meetings are an essential component of the first-year orientation
that should not have been cut from the
schedule. "I think what we really did was
say, this can't be cut, we're saying that this
is just as important as listening to the dean
of students speak. It's important for students
of color and queer students to know they
have the community here," Marquez said. "I
think it's especially important to do this during orientation, when they're still finding

themselves and their communities," she
said.
However, the first-year orientation is not
necessarily the most crucial time for affinity
groups to meet and bond with first-years,
Assistant Dean and Director of the IC Rafael
Zapata said. "I think the early meetings give
people a sense of what's available, but like in
any relationship, the first impression needs
to be augmented with what you do going forward," he said. "The first meeting can give a
good impression, but it's not everything."

Beardsley Media Center opens for student use
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore.edu

The first floor of Beardsley hall now

features a new media center housing an
array of equipment including audio and
video editing tools, a color printer and a
large format printer for student use.
The center is supported by Academic
Computing and Media Services, which
are also located on the first floor of
Beardsley, and is open to any student
with a Swarthmore ID and password.
The media center is located in the former Helpdesk and ResTech area, presenting a challenge for the ITS department to find a place for every department. The Helpdesk has now been
moved to a new, more open location
down the hall and most of the ITS staff
has been interspersed throughout the

first floor.

The Administrative Systems team
and Web Services team, however, are
now located in the Swarthmore train
station, which formerly housed the Lang
Center.
During the first few weeks of the
semester, many students are plagued
with computer issues and it may seem
like an inconvenient time for a shakeup.
However, Chief Information Technology
Officer Gayle Barton is confident that
the move will not lead to any delays for
students needing help.
"Facilities was very helpful and this
whole project came together very quickly this summer. We may look a bit
unsettled in parts, but the actual moves
were completed by the middle of
August," Barton said.
The center is currently open while
ITS staff is in the building. Barton hopes
to hire additional staff as well as a few
student workers to keep the center open

for additional hours. Over the long term,
Barton envisions a schedule that will
allow students to access the media center until 9 p.m. on weekdays and for a
few hours on Sunday evenings.
With its state-of-the-art equipment,
the media center was not easy to fund
and is still very much a work in
progress. Barton mentioned a push for
high definition video equipment and
new furniture so that the center could
comfortably house as many as twelve
workstations. "We will continually be
updating the space as the technology
progresses," Barton said.
Barton also hopes to consolidate
some media technology that is used in
multiple departments in the Beardsley
Center. She cited the equipment used in
multiple departments to transcribe prerecorded interviews, pointing to the fact
that it would be much easier to have all
of the equipment and people trained to
assist in using the equipment in one central location.
Currently the media center offers six
workstations with software and equipment for video and audio editing and

A small room off to the side offers a
quiet space for recording audio or video

printer for poster-sized projects and a

both letter-sized paper and tabloid-sized
paper.

All of these resources are available to
students with some restrictions. "There
is a lot of waste generated by printers,"
Barton said, "People try to use [the large
format printer] to print out a life-sized

it's here for." There are other resources
on campus for students interested in
technology and media. The Language
Resource Center, for example, offers a
variety of international media and a
host of audio and video editing tools for

language students.
Barton, however, believes that the
Beardsley Center is open to a wider
audience. "The facility in Beardsley is
designed to be a place that is open to
anyone interested in audio, video, or
graphics," Barton said.
Additionally,. Swarthmore College
Computer Society (SCCS), offers video
cameras that students, faculty and staff
can borrow, but the video editing equipment can only be used when an SCCS
member is on site.

"This has been a terrific service to
the student body but we think it is unrealistic, and perhaps unfair, to expect

that a student organization can provide
support for multimedia
a service
that has become a critidevelopment
cal part of the academic program and an
essential component of the ways that
people communicate," Barton said.
The media center is now able to serve
the broader Swarthmore community,
which Barton believes sets it apart from
similar facilities on campus.
"One of our goals is to work closely
with faculty who want to use digital
media in their teaching and this should
be easier with the new configuration,"
Barton said. And so that any student
can use the equipment regardless of
media editing experience, there are

Students are also excited about the
prospect of gaining experience on audio
and video editing equipment. Blaine
O'Neill 'll spent his summer working
on high definition video editing and
expressed his support for the new center. "For students interested in digital
design and video, this is a much-needed

addition," O'Neill said.
Students have already begun to utilize the space in the first few days of
classes. The sketch comedy group Boy
Meets Tractor used the equipment to
edit a video that was shown during their
Orientation show this past Saturday.
Sara Lipshutz 'IL one of the video
editors of Boy Meets Tractor, was among
the first students to use the equipment
in the Beardsley Center.
She had previous experience working
on the computers in SCCS, which were
not open for as many hours and did not
have the software that is ideal for video
editing. "It's great that [the Beardsley
Center] is open to us and has set hours,"
Lipshutz said.
Because Lipshutz and the other members of Boy Meets Tractor were working
on their project before the semester officially began, the media center was not
fully staffed. However, they still
received help, which Lipshutz enjoyed.
"I'm still learning and I know I'm
going to need help and it'll be great
when someone is there to help me,"
Lipshutz said.
While the media center will be useful
for making last-minute color copies, Film

interested in audio and video editing will
undoubtedly use it most.

Four students volunteer in Bosnia
In a former war zone, the Swarthmore team implemented a unique curriculum emphasizing dialogue and cooperation
BY TRAVIS POLLEN

tpollenl@swarthmore.edu

Over the summer Andrew Loh 'lO,
Trude Raizen 'OB, Lisa Riddle 'O9, and
Deivid Rojas 'll traveled to Zenica,
Bosnia, from June 12 to July 18 to teach
local children, ages 5 to 15, English and
nonviolent conflict resolution through
games, arts and crafts, and cooperative

physical activity.
Jess Engebretson 'O9, a transfer student and past participant in the program
through the College of William & Mary,
helped to plan the trip. "It was such a
great experience when I went the summer
after my freshman year that I wanted to
bring it to Swarthmore," she said.
Sezam, a non-governmental organization located in Zenica, began this low-cost
summer program in 1995 after the end of a
devastating three-year war as a way to
keep children off the streets and away

from their televisions screens. At the
time, there were no other summer enrichment opportunities available to children
in Zenica.
According to the CIA World Factbook,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the second
poorest country of the former Yugoslav
federation, and although Zenica is the
third largest city in Bosnia, it remains
dilapidated. Its economy is stagnant,
unemployment is high, and crime is widespread.
Along with six William

&

Mary stu-

dents, the group of four teamed with
Sezam to assist in the efforts to improve
the lives of the local youth in Zenica.
"We all arrived very late on June 12.
Over the next three days we got to know
our host families and the town, and we set
up the classrooms. We brought some supplies, but William Mary shipped boxes
of supplies over," Riddle said.
Over the course of the ,next few weeks,
the students would design the entire curriculum, exploring the city and country
extensively in between.
What resulted was a mixture of school
and camp, as daily activities included
vocabulary practice, translation from
Bosnian to English and vice versa in
order to emphasize the importance of the
native tongue, field activities, and games
such as Jeopardy, hangman, bingo, and

mafia.

"Since Andrew is Asian
and I'm Hispanic, the kids
found out that not everyone is blond-haired and
blue-eyed."
Deivid Rojas 'U
"We had international days every
week representing different countries.
Since Andrew is Asian and I'm Hispanic,
the kids found out that not everyone is
blond-haired and blue-eyed," Rojas said.
The students divided the children by age
into three sections of about a dozen each
and taught in pairs.
"Their education is very structured
and rigid. Here, they could be very creative," Rojas said.
One of the most rewarding activities
was the mural project that students and

6

children alike completed on a side of the
school during the culminating week.
"Going into Bosnia, I was thinking about
a project that would involve all the kids,
something that everyone could work on
together," Rojas said.
"We spent days and days talking about
it and looking around the city. After a
while, it just kind of came to me."
The wall first had to be painstakingly
cleaned of graffiti and painted white. Only
then could every child place his or her
hands on it to help make the shape of a
tree, flower, sun, or rainbow. "The kids
loved the end result," Rojas said.
In English Sezam literally means "open
sesame." While the organization "aims to
unlock children's hearts and minds"
according

to

www.bosniaproject.org,

Riddle said she felt that the children
arrived on the first day with this openness and a set of conflict resolution skills
already in place.
The group dynamic did change over
the course of the progam, as the partici-

pants became more familiar with one
another. Some started off shy, others
aggressive, but by the end of the program,
the children were noticeably more
respectful of their peers.
"The atmosphere was much friendlier
at the end. If someone were sitting out,
one of the kids would go over and ask
them to come join in. We also had to
watch out for kids making fun of each
other in Bosnian, so Andrew learned a lot
of Bosnian insults," Riddle said.
In previous years, Sezam had more
interested children than space permitted.
However, this past summer they expand-

Ed into two school buildings, providing
services for well over 100 youngsters.

Nevertheless, enrollment was not as high
as expected, due to a lack of advertising
and organization, said Riddle.
One disagreement was over the issue
of money.
"I thought the kids weren't going to be
charged for the program. I got mad even
though it was only a small fee," Rojas
said.

"The kids [were amused
by] the way we pronounced
things, but there are three
pronunciations of
the letter C!"
Lisa Riddle 'O9
Another obstacle the students encountered was the departure of the in-class
translators, local university students who
had volunteered to help facilitate but
ended up studying for exams instead.
For some of the students, it was their
first time abroad. Not only did they teach
the children, but they also learned from
them.
"The kids there were incredible. They
were really motivated, and they really
wanted to be there. We take our education
and the resources we have for granted,"
Rojas said.
The students gained an understanding

September 4, 2008

of cultural differences and diverse opinions of history and even learned a little
Bosnian. "The kids thought it was hilarious the way we pronounced things, but
there are three pronunciations of the letter C!" Riddle said.
While the teaching and planning experience may have been draining, the students had most of the afternoons and
evenings for leisure and sightseeing. "It
was tiring but in a very satisfying way,"
Riddle said.
A significant portion of funding came
from the Davis Projects for Peace, for
which the college submitted its application just before the deadline, thanks to the
help of the Lang Center and Professor
Steve Piker. Additionally, students raised
an even greater sum through other
sources such as friends, family, and the
college itself.
They were able to contribute well over
$5,000 to the NGO.
Since the program is no longer starting
from scratch, it is Engebretson's hope
that having a team of experienced returning students will facilitate preparations
for future years.
E-mails from the children demonstrate
how they anxiously await the students'
return next summer.
However, funding will have to come
from sources other than Projects for
Peace, which finances only new ventures.
The future is thus uncertain.
Rojas believes, however, that there is a
strong need for such programs all over
the world, not just in Bosnia. Riddle, for
one, would love to go back. "The best summer I've ever had," she said.

Dining Services increases prices, meal plan options
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu
In addition to changing the
default meal plan for freshmen
from the 20 meal plan to the 17
meal plan, Dining Services has
implemented other small changes
that will affect the entire student

body.

Director of Dining Services
Linda McDougall decided to
extend the 17 meal plan option to
freshmen after many voiced concerns that the 20 meal plan was
too restrictive.
"We suggested that it's awful
that freshmen didn't have the
option to go on the 17 meal plan,
and dining services was receptive," Student Council President
Yongjun Heo 'O9 said.

"The

freshmen

are

all

assigned to the 17 meal plan, but
they can switch to the 20 meal
plan until September 5," Linda
McDougall said. "In fact, anyone
can switch their meal plan until
September 5."
In addition to increasing the
number of meal plan options for
Dining
freshmen,
Services
increased the number of points
available to students to accommodate rising costs in Essie Mae's
Snack Bar. "With Tarble, there's
been a slight price increase. The
cost of everything is going up, so
we have to increase the price of

our food," McDougall said. "Now
the 17 meal plan has $BO in points,
and the 14 meal plan has $l5O in

points."
McDougall said that meal
equivalencies have also increased
to $2.60 for breakfast, $3.75 for

lunch, and $4.60 for dinner.
"We've also increased the meal
equivalency, so hopefully students can get the same full meal
despite the price changes," she
said.
To address these changes and
discuss future modifications to
the meal plan, Dining Services
and Student Council plan on hosting a forum in the coming weeks,
McDougall said. "We should have
something by the beginning of
October. We want to have a forum
with students and the administration to discuss possible future
changes to the meal plan,"
McDougall said.

After student outcries last

semester when Dining Services
attempted to move away from
selling many packaged goods at
Essie Mae's to offering more prepared food, Dining Services
agreed to delay any major
changes until next semester, said

Nate Erskine 'lO, the Student
Council Appointments Chair.
"We are very committed to
creating a dialog between Dining
Services administrators and the
student body," Erskine said.

"What we are striving to do
with the forum is have something that can educate the students on the way dining services is run, give them an overall
picture of the challenges they
face, but we also want to give
students a chance to submit
ideas and see how they would
possibly like to see the meal
plan restructured," he said.
Student Council Vice
President Sven Udekwu 'O9
agreed that balancing student
interests with administrative
concerns is important. "We're
trying to talk about streamlining the changes at Tarble next
semester to benefit the students as much as possible,"
Udekwu said. "We want it so
that things work out better for
Dining Services in a monetary
sense, but still we can still
maintain a good modicum of
choice for students."
McDougall stressed that
Dining Services strives to
accommodate student needs
when implementing changes to
the food plan.
"The other thing that is
really important to understand
is that you all are our customers," McDougall said. "We
want to do what we can for you
within reason. If you have any
suggestions or complaints,
please let us know."

ITS server visualization effort
BY LAURA BACKUP
lbackupl@swarthmore.edu

In an effort to increase the reliability
and efficiency of Swarthmore's computer
server, Information Technology Services
has shifted to virtual servers, which will
allow the college to consolidate the
servers by hosting multiple applications
on a single piece of hardware.
In the past, certain applications
required individual hardware, but the
new servers are partitioned in such a way
that they are capable of supporting multiple different systems simultaneously.
Though no longer physically independent, "they run just as independently as if
they were still their own stand-alone
hardware," Chief Information Technology
Officer Gayle Barton said.

"I do think Swarthmore
got an early and
aggressive start in
[server virtualization],
and it's gone very well."
Gayle Barton

Chief Information
Technology Officer
Swarthmore is at the forefront of the

virtualization movement.

Though IBM mainframes were capable
of running multiple services on a single
computer 30 years ago, the technology has
only recently become available for main-

stream computing.
THE PHOENIX

progresses according to schedule

Similar programs at other liberal arts
colleges are currently in development:
Bryn Mawr has very recently begun to
virtualize its server and Haverford
intends to begin the process soon.
"I do think the industry as a whole is
moving in this direction; I do think
Swarthmore got an early and aggressive
start in doing this, and it's gone very
well," Barton said.
A number of prominent businesses
have likewise turned to virtual servers, in
order to cut costs and optimize performance.
"Industry is going for virtualization
because they want to reduce data center
space," Data Center Supervisor Don
Tedesco said.
Though cost of space is not a critical
issue at Swarthmore, the shift to virtual
servers nonetheless provides the college
with the opportunity to support additional applications.
With the virtualized data center, the
space now contains far less hardware
than was previously required.
The college is currently equipped with
eight physical servers, each of which can
accommodate 16 to 20 virtual servers.
This "allows [ITS] to be much more
responsive

in

providing

services,"

Tedesco said.
While ITS does monitor its hardware,
rarely used servers are sometimes neglected and thus problems with such hardware can go undetected.
The consolidated servers are more
robust than isolated servers, as well as
easier to monitor and update.
System Administrator Jason Rotunno
described the new system as "more reliif one server goes down, it's autoable
matically moved to another piece of hard...

ware."

New menu boards which display the increased prices for prepared foods
were installed in Essie Mae's this summer.

Servers reside in two separate data
centers, one in Beardsley and one in
Parrish. In the event of a problem, ITS is
capable of migrating a server to the alternate center without halting the applications.

ing...we had no cooling problems this
summer whatsoever [and] we're below
what it was specced for," Tedesco said.
"[Various types of hardware] require
dangerous chemicals, caustic chemicals,
things that are hard to dispose of
[because of virtualization] we've reduced
power, we've reduced cooling, and down
the road we will be putting 18 fewer
servers into that waste stream."
Server virtualization is conducted
through downsizing and streamlining
rather than proactive upgrades.
"We move a service to the virtual server when we need to upgrade or when the
hardware is at the end of its life," Barton
said. "We have to upgrade servers at such
a frequent pace that it works nicely."
Some of the applications used by the
college are natural candidates for virtualization.
Tedesco cited the protocol DHCP,
which "needs to be running all the time,
but in reality uses a very low amount of
RAM and has a very low network load
...

"Industry is going

for virtualization
because they want to
reduce data center
space."
Don Tedesco
Data Center Supervisor
A piece of hardware can be taken down
for service without affecting the services

it provides.
"The goal is for everything to be

redundant, everything set up for automatic failover," Barton said.
Ideally, hardware malfunctions will
have absolutely no effect on the campus's
access to applications.
Aside from reliability and ease of
maintenance, the virtual servers are vastly more energy-efficient, as the eight virtual servers consume much less power
than the dozens of individual servers that
they replaced.
There are also a number of less evident benefits. Tedesco explained that
servers generate a significant amount of
heat and require a strictly controlled, air-

conditioned environment.
Since investing in virtual servers,
"we're using a lot less air condition-

application
there are some things that
just don't function well in that environment," Barton said.
Though it is likely that some applications will never be virtualized, ITS hopes
to soon finish consolidating all servers
with applications that can be virtualized
without compromising service.
Tedesco said that he thinks it probable
that all viable applications will be virtualized by the summer of 2009.

Astro department acquires new observatory with deck and telescope
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

Four years after the opening of the $74 million Science
Center, the college has fulfilled one of its ambitions for the
astronomy department by installing the new Peter van de
Kamp Observatory. On August 15, a crane lowered a shiny
silver dome atop a small room adjacent to the astronomy
observatory deck on the roof of the Science Center. Within
the next few months, the installation of a research-grade telescope will complete the observatory, setting Swarthmore's
astronomy facilities on par with those of rival institutions
nationwide.
According to Assistant Professor of Astronomy David
Cohen, the installation of this telescope has been in the
plans all along. "The dome is new but that rectangular room
that it's on has been there ever since the building was built,

because the college knew that one way or another, we would
eventually have a telescope," Cohen said. Funding for the
new observatory comes from three sources. A National
Science Foundation grant covers the cost of the telescope, as
well as pay for student researchers. An anonymous donation by an alum made in the name of former astronomy professor and Director of the Sproul Observatory Peter van de
Kamp funds the dome. Finally, the Astronomy Department's
"Scientific Equipment Fund" pays for computers and other
specialized equipment to be used in conjunction withthe telescope, Cohen said.
According to Cohen, the astronomy department began
the process of applying for a grant from the National
Science Foundation five or six years ago. "Our goal for a
where stulong time has been to develop a facility here
dents who want to get involved in astronomical research
here on campus have modern equipment, a modern telescope, to do that research," Cohen said. After three
attempts, Professor of Astronomy Eric Jensen and Cohen

which will be

used with a separately-funded camera and spectrograph for
faculty and studentresearch."
For many, the arrival of the new telescope is a long...

...

awaited event.
Colin Schimmelfing 10, an astrophysics major, has been
anticipating the research-grade telescope ever since last
summer, when, while working on an astronomy-related
computer program with Professor Eric Jensen, he happened
to spot an invoice left in the printer for an expensive new
telescope. He remembers feeling really excited, especially
spectroscopy device. "Hopefully I'll be
for the
able to take data with it to use over the summer. Maybe I'll
find something no one else has."
Zach Sinemus 'lO, who plans to major in Astronomy and
Philosophy, is also looking forward to using the telescope.
"It'd be great if we actually get to use the observatory
Especially since it means we won't have to be outside in
freezing weather to look at the sky," Sinemus said in an email. "Right now we use the 5 telescopes on top of Cornell
which are good quality, but having had that giant observa...

Tory sitting next to Wharton and not being able to use it was
kind of a tease."
Both students are likely to use the telescope in the future,
for it is especially suited for advanced labs and research.
"Students will work on big ongoing research projects that
the astronomy professors already have underway, and we'll
hire students to make observations and analyze data,"
Cohen said.
The telescope will particularly serve those who plan to
pursue graduate degrees in astronomy. "Maybe half our
majors go on to grad school, and most astronomy grad studentshave to go or get to go observing in places like Arizona
and California and Hawaii and Chile, which are sort of the
four main places where there are big telescopes, and when
our graduates get to those telescopes in major observatories,
we want them to have had experience using a modern telescope ... with a modern computer control system and a modern camera and modern instrumentation," Cohen said.
However, underclassmen and incoming students shouldat least
n't anticipate extensive use of the new telescope

not immediately.
"Probably Astro 1 students will be able to use the telescope too, for something recreational, like looking at
Saturn," Cohen said, "but we're not sure how useful it will
be for intro level courses."
Currently, the biggest telescope on campus resides in
Sproul Observatory. Astronomers and those pursuing
astronomy master's degrees in the 1950soften used the older
telescope. Astonomy students have been using relatively
small, portable telescopes for their nighttime observations
on the observation deck atop the Science Center. However,
professors have had to travel to other institutions and locations across the world to conduct up-to-date research. With
the new telescope, professors and astronomers from all over

the nation will be able to conduct their own research at the

college.

Whether the Peter van de Kamp Observatory will draw
more students into the astronomy department, nobody can
be sure. "I hope that it'll bring more people into the astronomy fold, because it's not a very visible department,"
Schimmelfing said.

Colleges across country question and reassess campus security plans after threats and crises
BY LEXIE CLINTONTHE DAILY
CARDINAL (U. OF WISCONSIN
With so many campus
crises this year, headlines like this one
are ever-present, however, safety officials
at UW-Madison and other campuses say
blanket terms like "lockdown" are misleading and infeasibleto implement.
"To lock down a campus makes no
sense to me," UW-Madison Police Chief
Susan Riseling said. "People throw these
terms around without really thinking
(U-WIRE)

-

them through."

After the Virginia Tech shootings,
nearly every college campus reassessed
crisis security plans and decided how to
contain thousands of students, faculty
and staff. Along with these plans came
terminology from past campus tragedies,
like the mass shootings at Columbine
High School in 1999.
Lockdown was one of the terms that
blossomed from Columbine, according to
Alison Kiss, program director at Security
on Campus Inc., a non-profit organization
promoting secure campus environments.

"A lot of what is attributed to a lockdown is from Columbine and high
schools whereit's generally locking down
one building," she said.
For universities with multiple campuses and tens of thousands of students,
the idea of a lockdown has never translated well, safety experts on campuses
say.

"People have a lot of different definiabout,"
Riseling said. If locking down means clostions of what we're talking

8

ing all buildings, Riseling, who authored
an extensive UW System-wide security
report in 2007, said she does not know

what that means.
Like many big state schools, UWMadison is not isolated. It's located'
throughout downtown city streets, has a
24-hour hospital and 330 buildings, many
of which need to be hand-locked by a

smaller, the campus in Dover, Dei,
stretches over 400 acres.
The university experienced a latenight shooting incident among a group of
students this fall and decided to confine
students to dormitories and close the
campus for the weekend.
Delaware State spokesperson Carlos
Holmes said simply calling those actions
a lockdown is not accurate.
"Locking down makes it sound like
we're bolting the doors shut," Holmes
said.

"The University of WisconsinMadison is a city," Riseling said. "A lockdown is just not feasible. It's akin to locking down a city of 60,000 people."
Declaring a lockdown can also have

If it happens to be an intruder you

want to keep out, that can be good, Cook

explained. On the other hand, if it happens that students are trying to seek shelter and are stuck outside, that's not a
good thing, he said.

At Minnesota, Cook said he cannot
remember any time a campus-wide lockdown was used. He said there have been
several bomb threats that involved evac-

uating multiple buildings.
Even at a much smaller university,
like Delaware State University with
about 3,700 students, safety planners also
say a full lockdown is infeasible. Even
though the number of students may be

"We don't have impassable walls all
around campus," he said. "There is no
possible way that we could be sure that
nobody comes in or goes out of the campus at any time."
Although schools have strayed from
calling crisis plans lockdowns, these officials say heightened media coverage of
school safety after Virginia Tech may
paint a false picture of information flow.
"We hear about everything that hap-

September 4, 2008

pens immediately," Cook said. "It creates
many expectations, but there are only so

many resources."
Even in the age of to-the-minute web
updates, e-mails and mass text messaging
systems, Cook said keeping the entire
campus informed during a time of crisis
is not the main goal. Rather, available
resources would be channeled toward
solving the situation at hand.
"The people making the decisions
know who is in harm's way," Cook said.
"If the threat is a couple of miles away
and located in another building, there is
no threat to other people,"
Still, the idea that everyone wants to
know what is going on can be frustrating
for university police.
"Everyone thinks they need to be told
everything, and that's just not rational,"
Riseling said.
UW-Madison experienced a gunman
threat on the health sciences campus this
fall. The incident was a half mile from
central campus, but some central buildings decided to lock doors—an action
Riseling said police did not ask for.
"To me, it's silly to lock a building
down far from where the problem is. It's
just not relevant," Riseling said. "What's
happening on one end of campus doesn't
necessarily affect the other end."
At the time of a crisis, Riseling said
the police's main goal is to directly
respond to the situation, not declare a
blanket lockdown. "I appreciate people
who are scared," she said, "but when we
don't need to affect everybody, there is no
sense in creating that level of fear."

RIAA renews initiative to combat file-sharing

BY JEFF DAVIDSON
jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu
The soon-to-be reauthorized Higher Education
Opportunity Act is yet another step in the initiative to combat illegal file sharing over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks on
college campuses. Although officials do not believe the law
will go into effect until July 2010, colleges are still required
to make a good faith effort towards pro-activity in the never
ending battle against illegal copyrighted material.

"There is still this attitude that

Abigail Weathers 'ID
Since 2006, the Swarthmore community has received 272
complaints from companies demanding a removal of
unrightfully obtained copyrighted content from the campus's network. Complaints are usually in email form and
detail everything from the user's IP address to the file size to
the artist, game, movie, TV, or software name. All of this
information is first relayed to the Information and
Tecnhology department, where it is then processed, recorded, and disseminated to the student in what Gayle Barton,
the director of ITS, said takes at least an hour of manpower.
Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998,
copyright owners can send internet providers, such as col-

leges and universities, a letter forcing them to remove content from the system or else face legal liability. Once
Swarthmore receives a notification, the student in question
is given 10 days to comply; otherwise the student will lose
access to the campus network.
Last spring alone, the Recording Industry Association of
America, Inc. (RIAA) issued 24 complaints, while HBO,
Paramount, Columbia, Time Warner, and NBC sent 26 more.
All of these required the college to respond to the problem,
while the new Education Act requires the college to initially
prevent the problem.
"The Higher Education Act wants us to combat the problems," Barton said. "We've just been responding to the problems clearly we need to do more. At this point we're talking to students and people in the Dean of Students Office to
find out what to do."
One step towards fixing that problem is an annual disclosure that briefs students on the dangers of bringing their
P2P file sharing programs onto campus. The e-mail, sent on
August 21, describes how much more difficult it is to remain
virtually hidden on a campus network. It also impressed
upon students the financial consequences they could face if
caught sharing files.
The most disastrous problem for a college student is the
pre-settlement letter, something that, although less common
in recent months, is still not uncommon in the technological
world. In March 2007 the first RIAA pre-settlement letters
since then the ITS received 13
began shipping to colleges
letters to be relayed to students. The letter is nearly the same
as a complaint, except in this case a student is forced to pay
-

a settlement between $3,000 and $5,000 or face a much higher fine in court. This letter, usually the first notification a
student gets of his or her wrongdoing, leaves the user with
few options.
"There is still this attitude that the college will protect
[its students]," Abigail Weathers 'lO said. "People think this
only happened to two students, it won't happen to me. It's fun

to be like, 'I need this song,' then you just get it. But the
whole RIAA stuff is scary."
For those who do remain afraid of a potentially large fine,
a powerful option for Swarthmore students is DC++ for
Windows or Shakespeer for Mac, completely legal file-sharing programs restricted only to the college campus. Anyone

can search and download files from students on the campus
network.
"My RA just told us to delete everything else from the
outside because DC++ is safe, easier to use, and no one outside of Swat can access it," Lorenzo Ramirez 10 said.
DC++ is only one of the many safe and legal options available not only to Swarthmore students, but to anyone who
chooses to utilize such resources. Pandora Radio is an online
arena for free streaming music
listeners can simply
choose an artist they like and the website immediately
begins playing songs by that and similar artists.
Hulu.com is an online site that offers hundreds of TV
shows and movies for free while Qtrax is a new player that
allows for music download onto any computer for no charge.
Both of these resources are ad-supported, meaning the user
must only deal with a few short clips or images from advertisers and the content is then free. Since the websites and
programs gather enough revenue from advertisers, the
music, movie, or TV industry is safely paid in full for the use
of their products.
These services are still in the early stages and will continue to grow as the RIAA and similar organizations continue to enforce their copyrights.
"The entertainment industry needs new business models
that make the music easier to get," Barton said. "I think the
industry is adjusting to the new world, but it's going to take
some more time. I think the problem [of illegal file sharing]
to some extent may go away."
For now, Swarthmore students are urged to stay away
from illegally downloaded content and instead utilize the
plethora of free resources available to them.

Rachel Head settles into new position as assistant dean
Rachel Head recently assumed her role
as -Assistant Dean of Residential Life, a
position vacated after Liz Derickson 'Ol left
to attend graduate school. Holding a
Bachelor of Science from Florida State
University and a Master of Education from
University of South Florida, Head comes to
Swarthmore with years of experience in
both residential programs and social work.
In email correspondence with Phoenix
Managing Editor Kaitlin Kyi 10, Head elaborated upon the changes she hopes to bring
about as assistant dean.
Kaitlin Kyi: First of all, welcome to
Swarthmore! At the time of publication, you
will already have been situated here for
around 8 weeks. How are you settling into
your new surroundings?
Rachel Head: Thanks for the welcome!
You know, I started at Swarthmore during a
great time. The summer is a relaxed and
laid-back timefor the college. I was able to
start out slow and get my feet wet during

July, prior to things getting really busy
with RA training and preparing for the
Early Return students, not to mention the
20125! During the past 8 weeks, I've been
able to get to know a number of students
and other members of the Swarthmore community in an informal and welcoming environment.
I feel very at home at
Swarthmore. Everyone has gone above and
beyond to make me feel welcomed and
make me feel like part of the community.
I've enjoyed the summer
and now I am
psyched for students to arrive and for the
...

Fall term to begin.
KK Will it be a change to coordinate
housing at a smaller school like Swat?
RH: It is funny, I have kind of been working at smaller and smaller institutions over
the past several years. When I moved from
the University of South Florida to
Dartmouth College a few years ago, I went

THE PHOENIX

from working with a student population of
nearly 40,000 students to working with a
student population of less than 5,000.
Moving* to Swarthmore means working
with an even smaller student body. I think
that I am a better fit for smaller schools. I
love that, while at a school like
Swarthmore, it is really possible to get to
know each and every student. I also like
that the staff and faculty at Swarthmore
have the opportunity to get to know each
other; it is nice to work at an institution
where everyone in the administration is
working together to help create a positive
and supportive environment for students.
KK: Since we've turned to talk of the
future, what do you hope to accomplish as
Assistant Dean for Residential Life?
RH: I really hope that I can continue the
good work accomplished by Liz Derickson
and the other Housing Coordinators.
Students have expressed to me that they are
happy with how things have been working
in regards to residential life, so I hope that
I can continue that work. I am a big supporter of student governance, and I think
that I a lot of opportunities exist for students to share their input on the housing
process. The Housing Committee is a great
I am looking forward to
example of that
the opportunity to work with individual
and groups of students, and to hear their
concerns, ideas and thoughts about housing
policies and procedures.
I also hope that students will be able to
see me as a resource person for things outside of residential life. I worked for several
years coordinating Americorp programs, I
used to work as a social worker at a juvenile law clinic, I spent time working abroad
and traveling through Europe and I
changed my major about 12 times while in
undergrad. I put that out there to say that I
have background and experience outside of
residential life and I love sharing those

experiences with students. I hope that I can
work to connect with students in an advising capacity, as well as in a specific housing
capacity.
KK: If you had to choose, what dorm
would you most want to live in?
RH: This is a great question! Hmmm,
probably either Palmer/Pittenger, because I
love how every room is different and
unique, or in Worth (again, the spaces are
unique and have a lot of character).
KK Any personality quirks or traits we

might look

forward to when stopping by

Parrish 116?

RH: First off, I really do encourage people
just to stop by. I am new here, so please stop
by and introduce yourself, let me know who
you are, where you live, and share with me
anything that you want me to know. It is
kind of exciting being the new person in
town. I can't wait for the students to get here
this week so I can get to know everyone. As
for quirks or traits, I do have this serious
fear of dogs, so, don't be surprised if I freeze
up if a student comes walking in with a huge
dog! Hmm, what else
I am not sure. I do
have lots offun stuff to look at in my office,
though, so come on by and say hello!

Supported by a grant from
Swarthmore Project in Theater, the
AD HOC Theater Group is made up

Back in June, the group decided
to center their play around the
eruption

of Vesuvius because the

nature of the catastrophe "gave us a
way to investigate disaster and loss
from a distance greatly removed in
both time and space—this allowed
us to avoid the positioning problem
associated with making art about
more recent events," van Winkle

said.
Actor Stephanie Duncan 'OB, who
is the play's informal narrator, was
similarly drawn by Pompeii's
themes of "historical inference...the
romanticization of the past." "It
seemed like it would be plausible to

find amazing resources on these
themes across artistic and academic disciplines," Duncan said.
From these resources, which
ranged from historical eyewitness

er. While the elder Rudholm
ultimately
returned
to
Sweden, Hill did not end up as
lucky; he was arrested in Utah
for murder in 1914 and was
executed by the state.
According to Rothenberg,

Rudholm's inspiration for the
play came about through two
gifts he received from his
grandfather: a union songbook containing works by Joe
Hill and Georg Rudholm's letters to his wife still at home.
Even though many of these
labor songs were written to
rally the workers at the time,
the lyrics and music still resonate today. Hill's "Rebel
Girl," for example, is a feminist song supporting the many
female allies of the union,
obviously written at a time

when such sentiments were
unpopular.

As

FLETCHER WORTMANN
We Are Far Too Young and Clever
Every year I return here and inevitably, inexplicably, there are teenagers here.
This confuses me, because everyone else tries
to escape Swarthmore at the first available opportunity. Prospective students attend a class, sleep
on a floor covered in sweaty undergarments and
encrusted pizza fluids, and move on. Sophomores
and juniors study abroad and engage in the
intense study of subjects like 'European sexuallytransmitted diseases' and 'heavy foreign beer as

a breakfast food.'
But I cannot understand why freshman would
come here in the first place. And every year, they
come. It's baffling. It's like living on a duck pond
next to a freeway. Every spring, the parent ducks
fly to the pond and another generation of
adorable ducklings is born. They toddle about
and squawk endearingly and you shout at them:
"Get out of here, you miserable sons of bitches!
There're cars and pollution and probably ozone
depletion and you know those stupid plastic
things you find around sixpacks of soda? Those
are everywhere here. People drive up with giant
plastic bags of them and just dump the damn
things into the pond. No, I have no idea why.
Maybe they just love to watch baby ducks suffocate." But the next morning you wake up and the
highway is covered with tiny patches of fluffy
gore. And then it happens again, like clockwork,
every year. You could set your watch by thatfirst
indignant, splattering quack, sounding out and
then suddenly cut short by a roaring tractor-trail-

Needless to say, there are people here who
love to suffocate baby ducks, and, as I'm sure you
suspect by virtue of your rigorous SAT preparaAt
tions, I am using a metaphor here.
Swarthmore, you see, the crushed suffocating
baby ducks are you. I am morally and financially obligated to prepare you for the trials ahead;
the Phoenix is paying me an average of three dollars and fifty-seven cents per column and I would
not want to see their generous stipend ill-spent
(this is a lie, actually, as I intend to spend their
stipend in the illest way possible, on large quan-

tities of inexpensive alcohol or possibly on a
Beastie Boys album).

You're already staying in the abandoned shack
with the shambling undead and the mutant
inbred yokels and the six-hundred page readings

Kamchatkan peat-bog workers due Friday.
Metaphorically, of course.
Still, I would like to leave you with something
inspiring. I don't know how many of you are
familiar with the recent film The Dark Knight,
based on the finest sequential arts. Now in his
sixty-ninth year of fighting crime, the titular
Batman faces his most formidable challenge yet
with the reappearance of his oldest foe, a limping
Cirque-de-Solei expatriate wearing whitefaceand
brandishing pencils with deadly nihilist accuracy. The murder-clown is facing down the
Batman's girlfriend, portrayed by my high-school
sweetheart and fiance Maggie Gylenhall. The
clown-fellow invents a story to justify his bold
sartorial choices, and then asks the defining
question of the film: "why so serious?"
Understand. This is Gotham City. This is
where every punch and explosion is punctuated
by explosions of bright cardboard and ono-

matopoeia. Where Academy Award-winning
actresses dress up in bestial dominatrix outfits

and lick themselves for some reason. Where it
has been determined that the most compassionate
and effective way of caring for the mentally ill is
to lock them in Jack Skellington's summer house
and then plunge syringes of condensed liquid terror into their veins. Where the penguins wear
rocket-packs, and where bulletproof body-armor
is made from the finest latex and is gloriously be-

nippled.
Surely, if the residents of such a terrifying
burg can maintain their optimism, and more
importantly their sense of humor, then so can we.
This greasy clown-zombie is an inspiration to us
all, a modern Candide, relying on his wit and his
zest for life in these darkest of times. I pledge to
you, my readers, that I will use my editorial position to follow his grimy, staggering example.
And look now! The city is burning! The explosives are rigged to the ferrys and the rocket-penguins fly like shooting stars! Laugh with me.
Share a drink and watch me make this pencil disappear, as if by magic! And please, my friends,
permit me to ask one last time:
Why so serious?

LIANA KATZ

Digital
When I was in middle school, mix
tapes were my musical saviors.
Before I received my first mix tape, I

was content with listening quietly to
Dido's dull harmonies while doing
pre-algebra homework. Then a friend
placed a rectangular piece of plastic
accompanied by a hand-scribbled
track listing in my hands. Soon, my
desire to be a mathematician was
nipped in the bud and the songs on
that tape still remain among my
favorites ten years later.
Although it is a now virtually
obsolete art form, the mix tape has a
rich and sentimental history tied to
the development of underground
music scenes and musical technology. The first mixes appeared on the
monstrous 8-tracks of the 1960s and
early 19705. When tape players infiltrated the market and eclipsed the 8track, it became easier than ever to
compile personal mixes with high
quality sound. The ascendence of the

mix tape introduced a new era of
musical freedom. The ball-and-chain
of LPs and EPs fell away as listeners

could mash together their own
"greatest hits" albums.
In addition to providing another
nerve-wracking way to confess your
true feelings to a potential significant
other, the mix tape also played a significant role in hip-hop's rise from

the parties of the Bronx to the mainstream. Early hip-hop artists such as
Afrika
Bambaataa
and
DJ
Grandmaster Flash would record
portions of their live shows, increasing their notoriety via the circulation
of their tapes. In more recent years,
Chamillionaire worked his way up to
winning two Grammys by independently releasing his own mix tapes.
Today, the mix tape is generally
regarded as an artifact of one's fuzzy,

youthful years. Books such as Rob
Sheffield's "Love is a Mix Tape" and
Thurston Moore's "Mix Tape: the Art
of Cassette Culture" have washed
mix tapes in pastel-colored indie
schmaltz. In my opinion, however,
the mix tape does not deserve such
literary dirges. The fact is that while
the tape is a relic of the past, the function of the mix tape has been
absorbed into contemporary ways of
listening to music. Media players
such as iTunes allow users to pick
and choose what tracks they want to
hear. Playlist and shuffle functions
have the power to create endless
numbers of digital mix tapes that can
be repeated once or a thousand times
over. Blogs have now taken over the
domain that once belonged to torn
pieces oflooseleaf paper.
While the internet and digital
media have significantly expanded
the possibilities of the mix tape, I am
sometimes guilty of waxing nostalgic
over clunky cassettes. When I hear

that someone has never received a
mix, I have to fight the urge to drag
my tape and radio combo player out
of the attic and compile 80 minutes of
music. Luckily, the International
Mixtape Project finds a happy medium, using the internet to coordinate
an international web of mix tape
exchanges. I am signing up today.
In closing, and, to introduce my
column, which will explore the intersecting paths of music and technology, I offer Side A of a mix tape
inspired by Progress with a capital P.
Imagine my loopy handwriting in
place of the neat typeface below.
Track 1: "Airbag" by Radiohead
In which Thorn Yorke warbles
about his dislikes (cars, car crashes,
airplanes) and likes (seatbelts).
Track 2: "1984" by David Bowie
After reading George Orwell's
1984, Bowie was inspired to compose
this ode to a society under the oppressive eye of a totalitarian regime or
something along those lines.

This is what encroaching technological insanity sounds like.

Event, makes music about the everyday, music that comments on the transient relationships that very fortuitously unfold and causally deteriorate, music that strips away
at the illusions that people create instinctively to avoid
confronting the truth. "You're supposed to be a social critic as an artist, so that's what we're trying to do, in our
own way," co-founder and bassist Brendan Canning said
to me in a phone interview one summer afternoon. "We're
not going to hit you over the head with our own political
message, we're just trying to do the right thing."
And while I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to talk about the cataclysmically explosive moments
of quiet in "It's All Gonna Break," the cyclical, gossamer
melody of "Anthems Of A Seventeen Year Old," the way
the vocals in "You Forgot It In People" blend almost indistinguishably into the quiet haze of creeping instruments,
Canning kept coming back to more political imperatives
that I had somehow missed in my five years of listening
and to what he perceived to be his role as an agent of
change: "There's more to life than playing guitar and
entertaining the masses. I think we were all put on the
planet to help improve the planet
Music is a gift, and
[like other gifts], you can use it to try to improve upon
...

things."

The politically or, socially critical aspects of Broken
Social Scene's music weren't actually discernible to me
for a while. The images that I, admittedly very subjectively, associate with the band's music
summer solstices,
the haze of pollution in big cities, leaky faucets, taking the
Downtown 4 train at 7 a.m. on a Monday morning wearing
clothes from the night before when everyone else around
you is suited in perfectly tailoredblack Wall Street wool
always seemed to remind me of interconnectedness and
the relationships we innately have with each otherrather
than songs that voice some sort of political concerns.
And while I initially dismissed Canning's recurrent
emphasis on the band's simultaneous role as social critic
and artist as the sort of "If I could change one thing about
the world, I'd create world peace" beauty pageant answer
that you're supposed to give just because, I started listening a bit more closely and started to get a better understanding of the way in which Broken Social Scene
approaches what they understand to be their task of social
criticism. The way they confront their listeners isn't with
hugely broad, epically important, grand world problems
but with the small, everyday things that we can more
directly control.
And when Kevin Drew's desperately pleads that he
really doesn't "want to think about those things anymore"

THE PHOENIX

in "Superconnected," his very singing about "those
things" really only forces us to confront the things that we
don't want to think about, the things that are easier to
deny but more responsible to face up to, the things that we
know we can improve upon if we just put in the smallest
amount of effort. We might "all want the lovely music to
save [our] lives," but by exposing that there are so many
things we try to ignore, Canning, Drew and the other
rotating members of the Toronto supergroup boister a
sense of personal responsibility (and "superconnected"ness) when it comes to our local communities and the way
we treat the people and things around us.

"You're supposed to be a social
critic as an artist, so that's what
we're trying to do, in our own way."

RJD2:I would agree; it is different. But I mean, I would
like to think all my albums are pretty different from the
others. Other than the drums, this one definitely uses samples a lot less compared to the others.
EC: What influenced you in branching out from your
usual style? Was it a conscious decision?
RJD2: Um, I guess it's hard to call it a decision; it's more
natural than that. What's normal is for people to change,
tastes in music to change. I guess I would call it conscious,
but not a planned or premeditated choice.
EC: Will you be playing much from "The Third Hand"
this weekend?
RJD2: Not really, I think most of it will probably be
pulled from my first two records. I won't have my band
with me, and a lot of the instrumentals in the new album
would be impossible to recreate by myself.
EC: Which do you more prefer, playing college shows or
shows at more public venues?
RJD2: Right now, I prefer college shows. I prefer the
attitudes of the people who come; they're more excited. In
general, I also just like smaller, more intimate shows
more.
EC: Who are your favorite musical artists? Who has

influenced your music?

RJD2: In general, Stevie Wonder is my all-time favorite.
Other than that it's hard to say
it changes a lot.
EC: Okay, random question: What'd you eatfor breakfast
this morning?
RJD2: (laughs) Let's see... I had some kind of peanut
buttery, crunchy cereal. Yeah, you know, that peanut butter crunch stuff.
EC: And what do you think you 'll have for dinner?
RJD2: Today, I'm pretty sure I'll make a linguine with
seafood. I'll throw in some basil, tomato, with some
shrimps and scallops in there.
EC: That sounds pretty good!
RJD2: Yeah, it is. I've actually made it enough times
now, so I hopefully won't screw it up.
...

"I care about a lot of things," Canning said, seeming
almost offended when I asked him to talk about the things
that he cared most about (Hey, if anyone should have been
offended, it should have been me
he was the one who
was "running a bath" while I was trying to have a conversation about music with him).
"I care about having a happy life, living in a city where
the air quality is not that good and is everything going to
be okay in life
am I going to be happy making music or
do I want to do something else and is this band going to
satisfy me and is my dog going to stop growling at me and
is my garden going to be growing nice flowers until the
fall and are my evergreen trees on the side of my house
going to dry out because they're not getting enough rain
or are they getting too much rain or do I need to fix the
roof before next year or do I not need to fix the roof and
should I have a green roof and am I going to go to Africa
someday? I care about everything." And the kinds of
things that Brendan Canning cares about are the kinds of
things that his band's music seems, to me at least, to try
to get us to take more of an interest in and be a bit more
conscious of.
While Canning told me he believes there's more to life
than just playing guitar, it seems like he instinctively creates his own illusions while trying to dispell ours because
it's "not for [him] to believe" that "art can fail you" his
responsibility as an artist is to subtly confront the
bleached teeth, flashing smiles and trash talking of seventeen year old girls, not necessarily aggressively or directly, but in ways that are much more subtle, thought-provoking and übiquitously sensory.

'Graduate' misrepresentative of Swarthmore's values

JOEL SWANSON

They're Watching
Since I'm supposed to be writing a column about film this semester, I figured
there was no better place to start than with
the movie that is perhaps the closest
Swarthmore has to an official work of art:
"The Graduate." "The Graduate" is, for
whatever reason, undeniably a bona fide
Swarthmore classic. Every year the new
freshmen watch it the evening before
classes begin and are initiated into the cult
of Swarthmore by learning which lines
they are supposed to applaud for and
which moments are most significant, so
that the next year, the process can be
repeated for the next class of new students.
No one seems to be quite sure how this tradition began and that is almost irrelevant
at this point. The more pertinent question
is: What does it say about the Swarthmore
community that we have selected "The
Graduate" as our symbol of ourselves, our
emblem of our anxieties, our archetype of
our collegiate angst? The answer to this
question, I fear, is deeply problematic.
"The Graduate" was released in 1967,
and at the time, it was intended to be a
challenge to the conventional, prevailing
attitudes of social morality that were still
around from the 19505. In this sense, it was
part of the same movement that spawned
such films as "Easy Rider," "One Flew

14

Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Bonnie and
Clyde," and Stanley Kubrick's "A
Clockwork Orange." Though today it may
seem almost passe, the relationship
between Benjamin Braddock (Dustin
Hoffman) and Mrs. Robinson (Anne
Bancroft) was probably fairly shocking at
the time, at least to those sheltered
Americans who had managed to miss out
on all of the cultural innovations of the
preceding few years. The sexual revolution of the 1960s was a necessary challenge
to the sexist and heterosexist social mores
of the time and an attempt to expand society's conceptions of what acceptable
expressions of sexuality, love and desire
are. But "The Graduate" does not represent any of these positive aspects of the
sexual revolution. For all of its supposed
challenges to the repressive 1950s archetype of sexuality, "The Graduate" is in the
end a profoundly regressive, patriarchal
film that should not be endorsed in any
way by Swarthmore.
The most troubling element in the film
by far is the relationship between
Benjamin and Elaine Robinson (Katharine
Ross). Benjamin is almost pathologically
unable to accept his rejection by Elaine
after she learns the truth of his affair with
her mother and he resorts to stalking her
in an effort to "win her back." Worst of all,
the viewers are presumably intended to
fmd this behavior somehow "romantic"
and admirable, as an attempt for Benjamin
to follow his dreams, regardless of social

does not seem to care one bit, for he views
himself as deserving of whatever he wants
in life. He is defending a conservative, sexist and fundamentally regressive view of
human relationships in which men are
entitled to pursue women as they see fit,
without any regard for the women themselves. So much for overturning the values
of the preceding decade.
Swarthmore should not be endorsing a
movie that is, at its core, essentially an
endorsement of stalking, which is a horrific act of emotional violence that destroys
lives. What kind of message does it send
for freshmen to attend the Acquaintance
Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP) workshop on the first Sunday evening of the
school year and then, just half an hour
later, to go watch a movie that is an
endorsement of a form of sexual violence?
Why do we, as members of a community
that prides itself on being progressive and
intolerant of sexism and sexual violence,
adopt a movie like "The Graduate" as a
symbol of our college? I have asked fellow

students in the past to explain to me why
"The Graduate" is so significant to
Swarthmore, and usually the answers that
I get are about how it symbolizes the struggle to pursue one's own path in life after
leaving the college environment.That may
be, but it does not excuse the fact that
Benjamin pursues his path at the expense
of Elaine's rights as a person.
I am not saying that "The Graduate"
should not exist at all, or even that it is
wholly without merit as a movie. At the
very least, the Simon and Garfunkel
soundtrack is excellent. But I am saying
that we as a community should be having
a dialogue about what our values are and
how our symbols represent these values. If
"The Graduate" is so unrepresentative of
Swarthmore's values, then perhaps it
should not be our film of choice to be
screened each year. Worse, if it is representative of our values, then those values
desperately need to change.

convention.

"The Graduate" is in the
end a profoundly
patriarchal film that
should not be endorsed in
any way by Swarthmore.
...

It is not admirable in the least.
Benjamin's actions in "The Graduate" are
illegal and immoral, and most of all, deeply
disrespectful to Elaine and her desires. He

were
fashioned according to formula. I thought clay was a dull medium, relegated forever to fulfill a utilitarian purpose.
A visit to the Clay Studio, however, quickly changed
my perspective on ceramics. Shiny and vibrant glazes,
intricate carvings, fanciful decorations and pristine
forms dazzled my eye, while statements written by the
Clay Studio's resident artists enhanced my superficial
appreciation. I discovered that one contingent of clay
artists is strictly dedicated to the medium's heritage, further exploring and expanding upon its functional applications. Another group seeks to guide the medium away
from dishware toward wider expressive freedom.
"Just Desserts," a selection of cake plates and ice
cream bowls by eight artists, presents utilitarian pieces
that have sweet implications. The artists evaluated the
ritual of dessert-eating, considering presentation and
aHBIa^^H^B^HHHHHBaMH^^^HH

functional necessities.
Artist Hiroe Hanazono writes in her statement: "My
desire as an artist is to create pots that serve not only as

a vehicle for the fine taste of food but also to transcend
visual pleasure and to stimulate appetite." Her minimalist toppings dish and ice cream bowls are decorated with
light pastel colors and delicate patterns. These porcelain
pieces limit the extent of visual competition with
dessert, allowing rainbow sprinkles, red cherries and
chocolate ice cream to take center stage.
Kristin Pavelka, on the other hand, arouses desire for
sweets through a mirroring device. Thickly applied, the
creamy glaze of her "Cake Plate" invokes a craving for
decadently-applied, velvety vanilla frosting. My sweet
tooth sprang into action while I looked at the plate, even
though an actual cake was not sitting atop the throne.

"Jen Allen: New Works" is a separate, small exhibition, connected to the desserts exhibitions by its concentration on functional works. Inspired by sewing and the

comforts of home, Allen translates the characteristics of
textiles to her porcelain works. She darts the edges of her
cups, customizing the mold like a tailor. She adorns the
surfaces with graphic patterns derived from post-WWII
fabrics and Arts and Crafts era designs. The visual association between fabrics and porcelain gives a softer glow
to the hard material.
"Colleen Toledano: subFORMATION" stands dramatically apart from the other two shows. Her works are nonfunctional, lacking purpose on a dining room table.
Toledano both recognizes and departs from the ceramic
arts' utilitarian focus. Intrigued by the popularity of cosmetic surgery, Toledano fashions her own "Do-ItYourself' tools for self-improvement. She combines selfmade porcelain pieces and shaped practical devices like
clamps, with purchased industrial tools in her mixedmedia sculptures.
Though the individual parts are functional, the sculptures as a whole do not provide a real-world purpose. For
example, "Behind Wood
Ray II" augments breasts
insulation material through a system of pipes, pumps
and sprinkler handles.
•

The inefficacy of Toledano's sculptures speaks to a new direction in
ceramics that emphasizes expression and welcomes exploration of
unconventional form.
...

I am deeply intrigued by this contradiction. Toledano

pays homage to function on a micro scale and then purposely fails to deliver a tool on a macro level. The inefficacy of Toledano's sculptures speaks to a new direction

in ceramics, one that emphasizes expression and welcomes exploration of unconventionalform.
I also enjoyed the process of translation in
subFORMATION. Toledano discusses several different
types of cosmetic surgery in the show, but she codes the
procedures in her distinct vocabulary. "Behind Wood
Ray II" is easiest to identify as an interpretation of
breast augmentation surgery through the two prominent
bulbs that protrude into the viewer's space. Other pieces
are more elusive. I read "Workspace I" as a representation of lap belt surgery. A porcelain clamp squeezes a
leather bag, tightening it at the middle.
Ultimately, identifying the procedure is beside the
point. The constricting device speaks to society's desire
to find tools to lose weight, to become smaller. Toledano's
art cannot help us lose the pounds, but it encourages critical evaluation of our desire to manipulate our bodies.

Feet at the Painted Bride Art Center
Willi Dorner, a Vienna-based choreographer, partnered with Lisa Rastl, a photographer, to capture
dancers' most important tool
the foot. Through the
ongoing project, Rastl has photographed 23 contemporary choreographers, from Yvonne Rainer to Carlos
Orta. Dorner and Rastl bare their discoveries in "Feet," a
traveling exhibition making its first stop in North
America.
Being limited to a very narrow subject matter, "Feet'
could have become repetitive quite easily. However, the
team expertly avoided this potential result. Rastl worked
with each choreographer individually, using varied settings and scales. As a designer, Dorner broke up the
arrangement of photographs on the wall, preventing the
gallery from becoming a cathedral to feet.
When the project began in 1994, Rastl took photographs in a neutral studio space. Many of these early
black-and-white photographs remain in the show. Naked
feet contrast beautifully against rich black backdrops.
However, Rastl shifted toward more expressive settings a
year later. By capturing the choreographers in their own
environments, she provides fuller portraits of their characters.

Dorner split the exhibition between two floors, each
having a very different aesthetic. On the first floor,
images of feet hang above and below the viewer or directly at eye level. A limited number of images are framed.
Scale varies dramatically, from very small 5x7 photos to
others approximately 20 inches high. Both color and
black-and-white photography is included. The conscious
avoidance of uniformity among the pictures' presentation breaks up the show, spurring interest and further
exploration.
I particularly enjoyed the second level. Here, large

cardboard boxes sit on the floor. Inside each box is a

blown-up black-and-white image of dancers' feet. By
bringing the art off the walls, feet are returned to their
natural location, the floor. However, the soles face
upward, revealing the wear and tear of age and use. The
feet demonstrate dancers' extraordinary reliance upon

their feet.

Integrity lacking
As the second issue of this newspaper goes to print, it
seems fitting to reflect on the subject of journalistic
integrity. As a starting point, Merriam-Webster aptly
defines "integrity" as a "firm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic values." But in the case of journalism, this definition needs to be made more specific.
Integrity means more than simply having a set of do's
and don't's; it means writing in the public interest.
Tragically, we find ourselves confronted with two problems: first, that the public interest as it pertains to the
media has become blurred; and second, that several seminal media institutions have failed to live up to this rigorous standard ofmoral behavior.
In order to elucidate what the public interest is, it's
essential to understand what it is not. First and foremost,
the public interest is not tabloid-esque inquiry into politicians' personal affairs. And nowhere is that more evident
than in the media circus surrounding Republican vicepresidential nominee Sarah Palin. Upon the announcement of her nomination, the ordinarily cautious
Newsweek burst forth with a rather unsavory take on
Alaska's "hockey mom," calling her nomination "good
theater" but otherwise declaring her wholly inept.
The fact that Newsweek represents the high water
mark in the media's treatment of Palin is horrific. Both
the New York Times and the Washington Post ran pieces
questioning Palin's decisions regarding her most recent
pregnancy; specifically, her choice to return to Alaska
from a conference for the birth of the child.
And every paper, from the Times to the Wall Street
Journal to USA Today, jumped on the story of Bristol
Palin's pregnancy. This cannot be made more explicit:
the choices of Ms. Palin's daughter are not news. Even
Barack Obama (who has little to gain from downplaying
the story) has told reporters to drop the subject. The fact
that, by and large, they have not is indicative of a problem not with Bristol Palin or her choices, but rather with
the media's fixation on entertaining, but ultimately irrelevant scandals.
An affinity for scandal is far from the mainstream
media's worst vice in this electoral cycle. Even big
names in the print media have shamelessly published
unresearched and astonishingly ignorant perspectives on
the election under the guise of "news." Taking a love of
the irrelevant one step further than the usual newspaper
rabble, Wall Street Journal reporter Amy Chozick offered
up the following commentary on Barack Obama's candidacy: "In a nation in which 66% of the voting-age population is overweight and 32% is obese, could Sen. Obama's
skinniness be a liability? Despite his visits to waffle houses, ice-cream parlors and greasy-spoon diners around the
country, his slim physique just might have some
Americans wondering whether he is truly like them."
Ms. Chozick here is guilty of two crimes. First, she
falls into the same trap she fell into regarding Bristol
Palin her article is not relevant to Mr. Obama's candidacy. Thefact thatBarack Obama is not overweight is an
almost laughable talking point, and one which Mr.
McCain's campaign staff has, fortunately, not echoed.
But second, and more seriously, her article fails to
meet the research and evidence standards one would
expect from a paper like the Wall Street Journal. Her primary source is a Yahoo! Message Board thread that she
anonymously started with the rather leading questions,
"Does anyone out there think Barack Obama is too thin
to be president? Anyone having a hard time relating to
him and his 'no excess body fat'?"
The Journal ought to be ashamed to have someone
like Chozick on their payroll. In the midst of one of the
most significant elections in recent history, there is little
room for shoddy and immaterial reporting, especially in
one of America's leading papers. And here, the Journal
is not alone. While Amy Chozick's questionable research
skills have earned her a degree of infamy, she is far from
the only reporter to fall into the trap of turning the presidential election into a personality contest. "Human
interest" reporting has come to take the place of substantive analysis, to the detriment ofactual journalism. And
left unchecked, this pattern has the potential to turn the
2008 presidential election into an uninformed crapshoot
between, as Paris Hilton put it, "that wrinkly whitehaired guy" and "that other guy" who promises change.

I thought it would be
appropriate to give

this column that title since what I hope to accomplish
through this space is to provide a look at Latin America
from within. More concretely, the goal of this column is to
digest and present to the student body and readers of The
Phoenix the most interesting and controversial current
events in Latin American politics. Ideally this will both
inform and spark interest in what I consider to be a very
pivotal time for Latin America politically and socially

speaking.
A brief background of how things stand:
As of 1998 Venezuela has undergone deep structural
changes under the Bolivarian Revolution. Nonetheless, it
is not the only radical political movement in Latin
America today. In Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, former
leader of the Sandinista NationalLiberation Front, is currently leading a revolutionary process much like the revolution in Venezuela. Evo Morales, in Bolivia, is the first
indigenous president since the Spanish conquest. He was
the leader of the cocalero movement, played a central role
in the gas protests in Cochabamba and is spearheading a
socialist revolution. Rafael Correa is a young president
educated abroad and has also put forth a socialist project
in Ecuador much like the one in Venezuela. Ex-bishop
Fernando Lugo was recently elected president of
Paraguay. His first decree was to give up his salary in the

name of those "who need it more than he does." The heads
of states in Argentina and Chile are women who defy the
region's widespread patriarchal tradition and propose

new visions for the continent. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva,

president of Brazil, is the leader of the worker's party and
has a prominent presence in the region. Colombia and
Peru, with Alvaro Uribe and Alan Garcia respectively,
currently live under rightist regimes.
In December of last year I contributed to a Phoenix
issue in the hopes of communicating to the college what
was, and still is, Hugo Chavez's only democratic defeat

since 1998. At the time, Venezuelans had been asked
whether or not they supported a radical constitutional
reform put forth by President Chavez. It included a total
of 69 changes to articles in the current constitution (written by Chavez himself in 1999) among which the following
two stood out: an extension of the presidential term frdm
five to seven years as well as the possibility of immediate
and indefinite reelection, and the dilution of the Central
Bank's autonomy from the branches of government.
As some of you many know, the reform was not
approved by popular vote and therefore did not pass.
Since then, many things have happened in Venezuela and
in Latin America. Among these one could underline the
fact that the head of the FARC (a prominent guerilla group
in Colombia) died unexpectedly, the opposition in Bolivia
has gained important political ground, former presidential candidate and hostage Ingrid Betancourt was freed in
a Hollywoodesque rescue mission orchestrated by the
Colombian government and in Cuba, Raul Castro
assumed the reigns of power.
As Venezuela prepares itself for regional elections in
November, the Venezuelan head of state has proposed a
so- called "packet" of 26 laws to be presented to the
National Assembly. Strikingly enough, most of the constitutional changes that were proposed in December are now
"camouflaged", so to speak, in the 26 laws. Politically
speaking, it must be mentioned that Chavez counts with
an approval rate of over 90 percent in the National
Assembly. In other words, it seems to be the case that the
Chavez administration is trying to pass a series of
changes in Venezuela's legislative texts via the National
Assembly that failed by way of popular vote. This, of
course, is unconstitutional.
How and why the head of state of a nation can propose
and intend to go through with a motion that is explicitly
unconstitutional may put the political reality of Latin
America, and Venezuela specifically, in context. If anything, that is precisely what I hope to do in this space: put
current political developments in context. I hope you will
join and contact me with any topics that interest you
specifically.

Why Bergman still matters
the ways they are oppressed in the real
world. And "Persona" is after all, in so
many ways, a movie about making

movies. But in choosing such self-referential modes of movie making Bergman's
film almost becomes about the artist himself. Beginning with a montage of images
that replicates the process of filmmaking,
the film introduces the two main characters as static portraits, images flashing
across a screen. Persona quickly becomes
an experiment in epistemology. How do
we construct knowledge about characters
in film? How do we construct knowledge
about two female characters, whose gender is a source of social isolation?

It's been almost a year, give or take,
since Ernst Ingmar Bergman passed away
on the island of Faro. I felt a sense of sad-

Elisabeth that she once committed adultery. The explicit description of the act
offered by Andersson's character subverts

ness, not so much for the man himself,
who lived an artistically fulfilling and
long life, but for the art to which he devoted so much of his imagination. It is the
end of an era. Few men have the strength
of heart, the insight, or the eloquence to
pull apart all of life's messy details the
way that man did. Bergman, contrary to
popular belief, was not some nihilist who
thought life was horrible beyond repair. I

who posited the existence of a Spider-God
in "Through a Glass Darkly" and portrayed the harrowing damage of the black
plague in "The Seventh Seal." Yet he was
also the man who brought us the image of
Bibi Andersson serenading crotchety old
Viktor Sjostrom in "Wild Strawberries,"
and the surreptitious kiss between Gun
Wallgren's ripe old matriarch, Helena,
and Erland Josephson's noble, generous
Jewish merchant, Isak, in "Fanny and
Alexander." (One has to love Bergman's
notion that amorous desire is not to be
reserved only for the "beautiful people").
No, Bergman was not some arbitrarily
mopey intellectual who saw the bad in
everything. He was simply relentlessly

honest with himselfand the world. And in
genre film Hollywood, Bergman's simultaneous empathy and cruelty is to be much
specifically, the clarity with
admired
which he portrayed the inner workings of
femininity. So much of pop culture is composed of either overtly sexist images of
women or veiled misogyny. Even the most
ardentfeminist can listen to music featuring epithets such as "bitch" and "ho" with
a numb heart. Chick flicks are marketed
with ease. And it would be easy to
describe Bergman's view of women as
refreshing or reassuring in contrast to
more prevalent representations. And yet
Bergman's vision of society is of a world
so cold, cruel and utterly indifferent to the
needs of women that it is genuinely frightening. The Swedish auteur succeeded in
bringing the ugly truth about the female
predicament to the screen.
-

"Persona" (1966) is easily Bergman's
most radical film, aesthetically. His first

film with Liv Ullman and one of many
with Bibi Andersson, it centers around a
nurse, Alma (Andersson), and a patient,
Elisabeth (Ullman), whose personalities
begin to merge. Ullman's character is an
actress, calling attention to the dilemmas
of the female performer. Bergman was
very clever to choose an actress as the
symbolic bearer of feminine existential
insecurity, for the ways in which women
are represented are always indicative of

18

much of the same anxieties as Ullman's

patient, who remains mute for nearly all
of the movie. In one stunning scene,
Andersson's character confides in

traditional

gender

characterizations.

Sexual conquests have always been the
domain of men, who have always been
permitted to speak frankly, on and off the
screen. Bergman sets the scene in a
hushed, confessional setting. He allows
Andersson's Alma to speak while
Ullman's Elisabeth sits back in amazed
yet empathetic silence. The mise en scene
is composed of the modest interior of the
cabin in which Elisabeth seeks rest.
Alma's tale of debauchery is not for the
faint of heart. Yet Andersson's quivering
delivery invokes a profound sense of loss
as expectations give way to shattered
dreams of security. Bergman's portrayal
of the two women is always cruelly intimate yet steadfast in its empathy.
"Cries and Whispers" (1972) is an
ensemble piece, focusing on four women

Hate crimes cannot be ignored
BY MEENA ELANCHENNY
AND AILYA VAJID
melanchl@swarthmore.edu and
avajidl@swarthmore.edu

If you have never been singled out based
on your race or ethnicity, consider yourself
lucky. Having been on the
receiving end of racial
attacks before, I can attest to
the sinking feeling of exclusion and inadequacy that these slurs produce.
In a country that prides itself on multiculturalism, hate crimes are still alarmingly frequent. And although Swarthmore has been
largely free of these occurrences, racial tensions still linger on our isolated campus. Case
in point, on the morning of the first day of
classes, a student awoke to find "FUCK
PALESTINE" written on his door. When the
student left a note asking to discuss the issue
later that day, he received a vulgar response.
The victim has been actively involved in initiating a new student organization, Students for
a Free Palestine. The student asserts thatsuch
hateful attacks only further motivate him to
continue the fight for the Palestinian cause.
After the initial shock of hearing about
such a disgusting act in our tolerant haven of
Swarthmore, I began to recall all those too
quickly forgotten moments of the past few
years: the rolling ofeyes during discussions of
race, the bigoted speakers invited to campus
and the sense of fear among students to
address racial and ethnic issues outside of a
closed group of friends. What frightens me
about this crime is its very nature: that a political statement, in this case a "Free Palestine"
sign on a door, could result in such blunt and
malicious political and racial attacks. But

ceptable that these crude events go almost
unnoticed. By ignoring them, we are both condoning such acts and accepting the underlying racial and ethnic tension that bubbles
beneath the surface at Swarthmore.
Most disturbing about this particular
attack is that it targeted a specific individual
who, even after the incident, did not express
rage or sadness, but rather a desire to understand the reasons behind the actions and to
discuss the issue at hand Palestine. A few
years ago, I could never have imagined such
hatred to be possible on a campus that prizes
equality and understanding.
Today, however, it seems that this is not
the case. Perhaps the incident on September 1
will fade into a distant memory in the near
future, but I can guarantee that the hatred
that spurred it on will not. We at Swarthmore
cannot let attacks against Palestine or any
other race, ethnicity, or nation be swept under
the carpet. By opening the door to discussion
about more sensitive racial, political and ethnic issues, we can reach out to those who
express hostility through their hatred and
ignorance. In fact, this is exactly the goal of
Students for a Free Palestine, the organization
co-founded by the student victim: to educate
the campus on the history and rights of the
Palestinian people. Perhaps then the next time
a person is targeted due to his race or ethnicity, he will not be standing alone, inadequate

and excluded, but with an army ofSwatties of
every background and ideology rooted firmly

behind him.

played by Kari Sylwan. Her sisters, Karin
and Maria, played by Ingrid Thulin and
Liv Ullman, are too mired in their own
existential maladies to pay much attention to their sister's passing. But Bergman

never portrays them as callous wenches,
consumed in superficiality, but rather
women overwhelmed by society's constraints and their inability to disentangle
themselves from a meaningless existence.
Bergman shocked viewers with a
scene in which Ingrid Thulin's Karin
takes a shard of glass and shoves it up her
vagina in an attempt to ward offher husband's sexual desires. But juxtaposed with
this physical carnage is the spiritual detritus of remorse, infidelity, suicide and
irreconcilable family differences. And yet
Andersson's performance as a woman on
the brink of terrible, ghastly death offers a
glimmer of hope. The culmination of
"Cries and Whispers" brings Karin and
Maria face to face with the spirit of their
dead sister and ultimately with their own
emotional impotency.
For a while I thought I had moved
away from Bergman. His aesthetic
seemed too conservative, especially compared to other, younger, New Wave
national movements. And yet in a world of
increasingly apathetic, escapist consumerism, his example gives me hope that
a new kind of art is possible. As Anna discovers in "Cries and Whispers," there is

The
Party gave the residents of the Gulf Coast the
respect that they deserved and a chance to

important to them. In curtailing its convention length, the Republican Party unwittingly
averted the possibility of voters having to listen to four solid days of attempts by McCain
to justify his choice ofSarah Palin as his running mate.

McCain's pick, while historic for the
Republican Party, is 24 years behind the
curve set when Geraldine Ferraro was the
first woman picked by a major American
political party as a vice presidential candidate.
McCain's pick represents great
progress for a political party stuck in the previous century; with that said, it is insulting
that McCain thought she was the best qualified Republican woman in political office to
serve as Vice President, given her general
lack of qualifications and the numerous outstanding Republican woman currently serving in Congress.

previous experiences do not qualify her to be

Branch of the United States. Only her two
years as Governor of Alaska might qualify
her as a viable candidate, but even so, her
selection as a vice presidential candidate is
astounding considering her inexperience
with national and international political
issues, as well as economic ones.
McCain has had much more experience
than Palin, which is why McCain felt confident enough to select such a wild card vice
presidential candidate. Even though he has
much experience in the national government,
it is doubtful that the pair of them will be able

to govern effectively. Our nation cannot
afford to spend four more years without
strong leadership from both members of a
ticket, and the past eight years are the best

evidence yet of an ineffective duo in the
Executive Branch.
The last thing that the voters on the Gulf
Coast needed this week was the Republican
Party waxing poetically about its supposed
principles and excess success under the current administration. For once, inaction was a
good decision by the Republicans, unlike the
inaction seen over the past eight years. Sadly,
there are few reasons to believe that McCain
and Palin would not continue down this path
ofinaction when it comes to issues that affect
most Americans. If they stay the course, they
can simply continue to deprive America's
dying cities and decaying infrastructure of
funding, perpetuate the human rights abuses
of Guantanamo detainees, ignore the failing
healthcare system, turn a blind eye toward
the increasing number of foreclosures, and
support our economy's reliance on oil. Now
wouldn't that be great?

Though I have been

both summer and winter, I have never watched the

that one little girl lip synch because they thought the

her nation on worldwide television. To me that's like
kicking a dog, you just don't do it. Regardless, anyone
who watched the Beijing Olympics watched history being
written and the experience is something I will never forget.

Of the most enjoyable aspects ofthis summer's games,
I would have to say watching Michael Phelps dominate
the sport of swimming after being hyped up non-stop for
months really made me proud to be an American. After
observing the much-anticipated lead-up to Bode Miller's
performance (read: debacle) in the last winter games, I
was just hoping that this kid barely older than myself
could deal with the pressure. Equally as amazing was the
emotion displayed by the kid's mother with every race he
demolished. Can't really blame her though, if I was in the
Olympics like he was I would hope my mother would do
the same. Phelps had more gold around his neck than Mr.
T, though I wonder who would rather shank him more
right now, Mark Spitz or all the other swimmerswho had
to listen to the national anthem constantly. His performance is the kind of thing I want to tell my kids I watched,
even though they probably wouldpay less attention to me
than Mike Tyson to his money.

In addition, Usain Bolt's ridiculous medal wins in the
100-meter and 200-meter dash were unbelievable. That kid
just took off and never looked back. Bolt was so fast that
I thought he was about to lift off down the stretch, totally
unbeatable. You know you're a badass when you have
enough time to look around and celebrate before you
even cross the finish line. I mean this guy is such a beast
that on ESPN they said his 40-yard dash time would be
absurd, like sub-4.0-seconds fast, so fast that the wind ripping past you blows your clothes off. Also there were
rumors that he wanted to try playing in the NFL. I would
draft him. You can't coach that, and even if he couldn'l
catch I would give him a pair of those new-age football
gloves that are basically so tacky you couldn't drop a pass
if you wanted to.
I'm certainly not the first to comment on it but those
Chinese gymnasts look like they couldn't even get into a

go toe-to-toe with a certain Cuban Tae Kwon Do competitor now that guy is a lunatic.
Not that the Olympics are over and we have to wail
until London 2012 for the next summer games I guess I'll
need to find other reasons to be proud about my country
other than just the medal count. Interestingly enough
while surfing through the internet tonight I saw that the

After completing a rigorous preseason, the men's and

starting what they hope will be a successful season. The
runners and the coach hope to improve on last season, when
the men's team finished in fifth place at the Centennial
Championships and the women's team placed four runners
in the top-50 at the Mid-east Regional Meet.
Both teams have worked hard to develop their captains
as leaders during the preseason. The captains of the men's
team and women's teams are Erik Saka 'O9 and Daniel
Hodson 'O9, and Kathy Feeney 'O9, Faith Pampel 'O9, Bess

Defender Eileen Earl thwarts an offensive attack in Sunday's game against Moravian College.

BY DENNIS FAN

clf3inl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore Women's Soccer kicked off
their season with confidence, finding the back
of the net often to post two shutouts in a 5-0 win
against Farmingdale State College and a 3-0 win
against Moravian College at the Swat Kick
Classic this past weekend.
Megan Colombo 11, Samantha Song 'l2, and
Elizabeth Mills 11 had individually outstanding

performances, scoring two goals apiece while
Laura Bolger 11 and Kelsey Cline 11 contributed to the victories with a goal each. Over
the course of the two-day tournament, Sarah
Reece 11 also made a considerable contribution
to the team's offense with three assists.
Stunning performances by the team's
defense stopped any counterattacks, allowing
only four shots on goal in the entire tournament, which goalies Lauren Walked 'O9 and
Marie Mutryn 'l2 stopped easily with two saves
each. The women also dominated in time of possession, handling the ball with precision, and
controlling the pace of the games.
Coach ToddAnckaitis attributed their recent
success to a highly fruitful preseason. The team
looked fit and energized during their matches,
often out-hustling their opponents to the ball
and racing past defenders as was the case when
Amy Langdon 11 sped past a defender and
around the goalie to assist Mills for an easy finish.
"This preseason they [the team] worked really hard to get back to midseason form," said
Anckaitis, who complimented the team after the
game. "I challenged them and they stepped up,"
he said, also commenting that he was proud that
the women performed at the high level that he
felt they were capable of playing at.
According to Anckaitis, one of the keys to
Swarthmore's success this weekend was the
depth of the team's roster. This depth allowed
him to freely substitute all the bench players

20

into the game at points where they would have
the best opportunity to make an impact, and to

have the flexibility to even change formations
in the Moravian game when Swarthmore
switched from a 4-4-2 to a 3-5-2 system.
Anckaitis jested that so many great players
made it increasingly difficult for the coaching
staff to pick starters and settle into one system.
Captain Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 added that,
"More than ever we have people who can play 90
minutes." Mullarkey also complimented the
team on the Farmingdale State game, stating
that the women's soccer team had not scored
five goals in a single game for many seasons.
Despite sweeping the tournament, Anckaitis
also saw room for improvement, commenting
that he would like the team to be more aggressive around the box to create more scoring

opportunities.
As the women's soccer team started their
season with a dominating 2-0 run, it is difficult
not to look ahead to how they could top their 142-3 performance during the 2007 Fall Season.
Coach Anckaitis sets the bar high for the
women's team this year, hoping that with continued improvement, the team can reach the
NCAA Tournament. Both Farmingdale State

and Moravian had reached the NCAA
Tournament the previous season, and during
the preseason Swarthmore scrimmaged and
defeated York College, another NCAA
Tournament participant.
Captain Alexa Bensimhon 'O9 offered words
of wisdom, commenting that she was anticipating the rest of the season, but that it was important not to lose focus and look too far ahead.
Hoping to continue their excellent play, the

women's soccer team looks forward to their
home game against Albright College at 7:00 P.M.

this Friday on Clothier Field.
