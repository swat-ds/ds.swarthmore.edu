The Swarthmore Phoenix
SWARTHMORE COLLEGE Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

At first glance, George Iredale might not seem like
such a tough guy.
Iredale, a friendly man bearing a congenial smile,
comes across to the casual observer as anything but
intimidating. Standing over six feet tall, with a wiry
frame, thin, dark hair, and light gray sideburns, he
conveys the image of a stereotypical, albeit thin,
teddy bear. There is even an affability to him, his
friendly demeanor and gentle stride overshadowing
an otherwise authoritative air.
But don't let the innocent facade fool you. This
man knows his stuff.
As a military police trainee, and during two years
spent in Germany, George Iredale was exposed to
the dark and dangerous side of humanity. As a 25
year veteran of the Pennsylvania State police, he experienced his fair share of the fast side of law enforcement. And as a lieutenant for the Swarthmore
College Public Safety Department, this third-rankand reing Working Supervisor has dealt with
incidents of
mains ever prepared to confront
youthful exuberance gone wrong.
But Lieutenant Iredale seems far from frazzled by
it all. On the contrary, as he stands determinedly in a
corner ofPublic Safety's small, but cozy, squad room
on the first floor of Ben West, his disposition is one
ofcoolness and calm. It's 8 p.m. on a raw and dreary
Friday evening, and Iredale's 3-11 shift is more than
half over. As routine dictates, he'll soon head out for
yet another drive around the campus, but now, before taking to the streets, he has paused long enough
to give a visitor a lay of the land which is Public
Safety's home base.
"It's small and cramped, but it's home," says
Iredale, as he surveys the neat, well-stocked room.
Far from resembling the stereotypically gritty police
squad room, the likes of which highlights NYPD
Blue, this modern, clean office contains computers
and a mobile scanner, in addition to the prerequisite
clipboards, microwave, coffee maker, and bagel box.
A group ofblack binders, including, "Crimes Codes,"
"Criminal Law Digest," and "Vehicles Law" for
Pennsylvania, sits on a desk; on the wall hangs a large
map of the campus. Among the many records littera list of
ing the office can be found a "tow list"

students whose cars havereceived numerous citations
and will be towed if found illegally parked on campus again. (To prove they mean business, an officer
will hand deliver a notice of warning to student offenders, to make sure they've been forewarned.)
In the hallway just outside the room, Iredale remarks a display case containing a broad range of
patches from various law enforcement agencies, with
those of nearby departments intermixed with patches
from other states. "This is the first patch I wore," he
says proudly, pointing to an old Pennsylvania State
Police patch. He adds that the design has since
changed.
Adjacent to the foyer, in an even smaller room,
Iredale notes the communications officer. A chameleon of sorts, the officer plays many roles, he emphasizes, including that ofcentral communications liaison for the entire campus
from college operator
to dispatcher
and receptionist for campus visitors
(as Ben West is the official college visitor center). As
with patrol officers, a communications officer is on
duty around the clock, often the first recourse for a
wide range of crises.
"We get every kind of phone call imaginable," says
Iredale, though not all are exciting. Some calls pertain to accidents and other emergencies, but many
deal with maintenance problems, such as stopped-up
toilets and broken fire extinguishers, which may be
handled by Public Safety or deferred to Physical
Plant.
Interestingly, though well-suited to the department's
operations, Ben West has not always been home to
Public Safety, according to Owen Redgrave, its director. Once called "Security and Safety," the department used to reside in the Physical Plant building,
where officers would sign in and out of a log book in
a tiny office. They wore gray uniforms, carried paga far
ers, and had comparatively littlereal training
cry from today's standards, which require that all full
time officers attend an academy for a full time, 16week course.
On par with Swarthmore's size, the Public Safety
team comprises 14 full-time employees, in addition
to four part-time patrol, and two part-time communications, officers, the latter of which are not authorized to go out on patrol. Extra help may be brought
in for such big events as the Nutcracker Performance
last December, Harambee, and sports games against
rivals, like Haverford.
Despite the occasional increase in manpower,
though, Iredale insists that "this is a very, very safe
environment," more so than many others college campuses. "We do not have a lot of physical confrontations, with students or otherwise."

9 o'clock rolls around, andLieutenant Iredale leaves
Ben West with newly-hired SergeantMike McMahon,
a retired Philadelphia police captain, whom Iredale
is in the midst of training. The two prepare to embark on a routine check of the campus, which is done
two or three times a shift. Fully suited up, Iredale
now resembles the familiar public safety officer,
sporting a darkblue winter jacket, black shoes, black
pants, and a white shirt. The color of his shirt, as
well as his gold badge, indicate his Lieutenant ranking, and all, except for the shoes, are issued by the
department.
On his belt hang a walkie-talkie, flashlight, ring of
keys, and handcuff case (though he doesn't see a need

Basenese Over Assault
by Andy Murray
A case involving the verbal intimidation and physical assault of a Swarthmore student was decided by
the College Judiciary Committee late Tuesday
evening. The CJC, consisting ofActing College Dean
Bob Gross, two students, two professors, and one additional staff member, found Lou Basenese 'OO guilty
of verbal "intimidation" and "violence and assault"
against Mark Dingfield 'Ol.
After deliberating for two evenings on an appropriate course of action, the CJC decided to suspend
Basenese for the rest of the Spring semester and required that he perform community service before returning to Swarthmore. If Basenese chooses to return
to Swarthmore after the suspension, he will be placed
on probation for an additional year.
The charges against Basenese stemmedfrom an altercation he had with Dingfield in the early morning hours
of Sunday, February 22. Basenese, along with fellow
Phi Psi member Dan Johnston '9B reportedly went to
Dingfield's room on Parrish 4th at about 5:00 a.m., where
Basenese, according to the CJC's official report, "physically attacked [Dingfield] repeatedly." Sources have confirmed that Johnston pulled Basenese off Dingfield, but
Basenese approached Dingfield a second time.
When asked, Dan Johnston confirmed that he was a
party involved in the altercation being adjudicated by
the CJC, but preferred not to comment for this article.
Joseph Genereux 'Ol, one of Dingfield's hallmates,
heard yells from the hallway and called Swarthmore
Public Safety. "I heard it because my bed is right by
the door," said Genereux. "The incident went on for
a while. It was still going on when I called Public
Safety." Genereux estimates that he waited 20 minutes until he heard what sounded like someone being
hit, before calling Public Safety.
Matt Halpern '9B, a friend of Dingfield who says he
arrived on Parrish 4th immediately after Basenese assaulted Dingfield, described the events somewhat differently. "When we got up there, Mark was getting off
the floor," says Halpern. "After we got there, Lou was
yelling at Mark for about 20 minutes. My testimony [to
the CJC] concerned what happened afterwards. It was
clear he showed after effects of a pretty intense beating."
Seth Murray '9B, the Parrish 4th RA, confirmed that
Dingfield had visible signs of injury following the assault. Murray described the injuries as "dime-sized"
cuts and bruises on Dingfield's head, bruises on his
back and shoulders, and a rug-burn like cut on his knee.
Swarthmore Public Safety was notified by Genereux
at approximately 5:40 a.m. and, according to Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave, arrived on the
scene at 5:46. The officers left shortly thereafter.
"Nobody gave us any indication that there was a fight...
[or] that anyone was injured," says Redgrave.
According to Halpern, however, Public Safety officers initially asked if someone was fighting and
Halpern replied that there wasn't. Halpern says that
he then clarified that Basenese had assaulted Dingfield,
but that the fight was already over. At that point, says
Halpern, "They [Public Safety] just said 'keep it down,
people are trying to sleep,' and walked out."
A number of sources have confirmed that the assault
originated in an apparent dispute involving Basenese,
Dingfield, and a female student. None of the principal
parties involved would comment on this report.

Following the announcement of the CJC's sanctions,
brothers of the Phi Psi Fraternity circulated a petition
at Sharpies Dining Hall questioning the severity of
the committee's punishment. According to Phi Psi
President John Delatush '9B the "consensus of the
brothers at Phi Psi is that what happened was obviously wrong and cannot be condoned, but the punishment [Basenese] received was too severe considering
cases that have gone before the CJC in the past."
Delatush mentioned two other cases that have occurred in the last four years at Swarthmore which he
says involved less serious consequences. At press
time, The Phoenix was unable to speak with the deans
to confirm the facts associated with either of these
two cases, or their subsequent disciplinary actions.
Concern has also arisen over the fact that Dingfield's
mother sits on the College Board of Managers. Late
last week, friends of Basenese drew attention to this
fact through chalkings and all-campus broadcasts.
They suggested adjudication would not have been so
swift had Dingfield's mother not held this position.
Associate Dean of the College for Student Life Tedd
Goundie said that the severity of the violation, the values of the College community, and justice were all concerns the committee repeatedly raised during deliberations. Goundie also added that the committee tried to
"incorporate an educational component into the decision."
Disagreeing with the decision to suspend Basenese for
the rest of theyear, Delatush responded, "I think if you're
going to expel someone, you have to say that what he
did outweighs all the good he can bring to Swarthmore."
Speaking as one of Basenese's friends and teammates, Delatush says, "I think Lou is a great guy...
He's always been supportive of me, he has been very
active in volunteer work with Phi Psi, and he's been a
great influence on campus." Delatush describes
Basenese as leading the fraternity's involvement in
Operation Smile, a fundraising project to raise money
for children who need medical operations.
Explaining how the CJC weighs a student's contributions and the accusations against them, Goundie
said, "We know people are going to make bad judgments
[We ask ourselves] 'how can we help them
learn from that?'" According to Goundie, reconciling differing perspectives and determining the appropriate punishment is always a "tough job." He added,
however, in this case testimony was taken from a number of principal figures and witnesses, but "in many
cases there wasn't any discrepancy between the two
[sides]."

Conflicting reports have also arisen as to whether
or not the deans of the College have barred Dingfield,
Basenese, and Johnston from commenting publicly
on the CJC proceedings and the assault. According
to Dingfield, Goundie and Acting Dean of the College Bob Gross both told him not to speak to the press
about the CJC proceedings or their resolution.
According to Goundie, however, he only "advised"
students not to talk about the proceedings and that he
normally offers the same advice to other students who
have taken part in adjudication hearings.
In a statement to The Phoenix, Dingfield said, "I
am putting the issue behind me and I am going to
move on." He declined to comment on any particulars
of the incident or the conclusion reached by the CJC.
At press time Basenese could not be reached for comment.

Ruling Could Jeopardize FMFCU Customers
by Emily Shartin
Last Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a 5-4
decision in the case ofNational
Credit Union Administration v.
First National Bank and Trust
Company, a ruling that could seriously affect the Swarthmore
community's membership in the
Franklin Mint Federal Credit
Union. There are currently about
2,800 Swarthmore students and
employees who bank at
FMFCU.
The Supreme Court decision
invalidates an interpretation of a
1934 Federal law that requires
credit unions to limit their member bases to "groups having a
common bond of occupation or

association." A number ofbanks
have construed this ambiguous
phrase to mean that each credit
union can only serve one specific
group with a common bond, usually a group of employees. However, in 1982,the National Credit
Union Administration, with government backing, began allowing credit unions to take on multiple groups with no general relation, provided that each of
these groups had its own internal common bond.
In exchange for membership
limitations, credit unions, which
operate as non-profit cooperatives, are exempt from taxes and
often able to rent office space at
reduced prices. Members enjoy
significant privileges as well.

While credit unions cannot offer as many types of loans as
banks, the loans they can offer
tend to be at lower interest rates.
An article appearing in
Tuesday's Wall Street Journal
entitled "Credit Unions Still Top
Banks on Deals for Basic Service" further explained that
credit unions "offer the lowest
average fees and the most competitive rates on savings and
checking accounts, many loans
and other products."
The American Bankers Association has argued that by being
allowed to expand their member
bases, credit unions have been
given an unfair advantage over
commercial banks. Since 1982,
15 million people have joined

credit unions, and currently a
total of 32 million people reap
thebenefits of credit union membership. FMFCU's membership
alone has jumped from 7,000 in
1986 to 37,000 this year.
In 1996, a group of North
Carolina banks took their complaints to the U.S. District Court
of Appeals in Washington D.C.
and secured an important victory
when Judge Thomas Jackson
agreed that credit unions compete unfairly, and issued an injunction illegalizing them. The
National Credit Union Administration appealed, and a stay on
the injunction has protected
credit unions for the duration of
the Supreme Court deliberations.

College Hires New Football Coach

A new chapter in Swarthmore football begins this
week with the hiring of Peter Alvanos as head
coach. Alvanos comes to Swarthmore after ten
years of coaching, the last four at the University
of Chicago, where he was the defensive coordinator and played a major role of the resurgence in the
football program. Coach Alvanos is looking forward
to the challenge of turning around a GarnetTide program that has lost 20 straight games and has had many
players quit in the past year.
Coach Alvanos graduated from Drexel University in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science degree.
He began coaching as a graduate assistant at Louisville University. After receiving a MasterofArts
there in Physical Education, Alvanos moved on to
Lehigh University, where he was a linebackercoach
for three years. In the two years prior to his hiring
at Chicago, Alvanos coached the defensive line and
was the team conditioning coordinator at University of Redlands in California. At Chicago as a defensive coordinator, a linebacker every year received
All-Conference honors. In addition, Alvanos was
the special teams coordinator, a recent problem area
of the Tide.

According to Director ofAthletics Bob Williams,
"CoachAlvanos has unbelievable enthusiasm and
excitement. He had gone through the reconstruction of the Chicago program not only as an assistant, but he also was the primary recruiter. He told
us that he can do the job, and we are very fortunate
that he has accepted the position. We are all excited
about the future prospects of football here."
Recruiting, according to members of the search
committee who interviewed the final candidates
for the job, was a major factor in selecting coach
Alvanos over the more than one hundred applicants for the coaching position. "He has the ability to get kids that might otherwise have gone to
an Ivy League school, or other Division One programs. He knows what kind of student-athletes to
go after, coming from the same type of program
that we have here," said junior J.P. Harris. Swarthmore has consistently had trouble attracting football players to the program here, and the result is
a severe shortage of team members.
Coach Alvanos will have an immediate impact
on recruiting, as "all the recruits have been asking
about the coaching situation. I think once coach
Alvanos gets in touch with these kids, that will
have a big part in some of them choosing S warth-

more," said recruiting coordinator Frank Amar.
Though this is his first head coaching job, not a
single member of the search committee had doubts
about the leadership abilities of coach Alvanos.
"He's energetic and a tough disciplinarian, which
is something we need here. He's won everywhere
he's been and I'm confident that he can do so here,"
said Charlie Parlapanides '99.
The Athletic Department has given coach
Alvanos a great deal of support. Alvanos was given
a three year contract, which, according to A.D. Bob
Williams "is rare and shows the kind of commitment that will be made." Additionally, Williams
points out that there will be two other full-time
coaching positions and one other intern position,
which is similar to other Centennial [Conference]
football programs.
Coach Alvanos is looking forward to his new job:
"I am certainly excited about coming to Swarthmore.
I am anxious to revitalize the program, while getting
everybody involved. It will be a lot ofhard work, but
I hope everybody is ready to make a commitment."
Alvanos understands the academic reputation of
Swarthmore and the type of student-athletes here. "I
understand thatkids come to Swarthmore for the best
education in the country. You have to understand their
needs and work with it. That is something I dealt

Another Note From the Editors
The past few weeks has seen the evolution of a lively campus debate over
our decision to print a letter written by Holocaust-denier Bradley Smith. At
times the discussion was tense and heated
the ultimate source of all this
tension, we believe, over these past few weeks is the tendency of Swarthmore students
to too deeply entrench our own beliefs, a
including us
pattern that has been reinforced by the sensitive nature of the debate. It's a
fine line between unequivocal belief (read: believing that one is absolutely
right and expecting everyone else to follow one's ideas) and having confidence in one's ideas while remaining open to others' opinions as well. But
we feel that people on this campus are intelligent enough to identify the distinction and pull themselvesback if they have crossed the line. What we have
learned from these past few weeks is the importance of respecting perspectives differentfrom our own. In deciding to print the letter alone, not only did
we overly defer to our journalistic instincts, but more crucially, we failed to
recognize and acknowledge a certain point of view. Certain differences may
be irreconcilable, but that does not preclude a peaceful and constructive coexistence. Respect does not entail belief. We do not expect everyone to follow our line of reasoning, and in the same token, we expect that others will
not forcefully impose their ideas upon us. And it is our sincere hope that
through a rational dialogue, we can "let a hundred flowers bloom," and at the
end of the day, everyone involved will emerge from the experience with a
broader and inclusive understanding of each other. On that note, we would
like to make the following clarifications:
At the outset, we would like to clarify the confusion over the article titled
"Pamphlet at Heart of Hate Speech Debate," which brought Smith's pamphlets to the attention of our readers for the first time. We concede to and
apologize for having been slightly lax in our characterization of the pamphlet, loosely switching between the terms offensive, hate, and harassing
speech. However, the final characterization was clear: that material like Smith's
is a particular headache because it doesn't even qualify as harassing speech,
hence the prospects for legislation are close to none, yet its effect can still be
hurtful.
At the center of the debate is a fundamental difference of opinion over the
nature of Smith's intentions. In our opinion, the call of whether or not to
print Smith's response was strictly journalistic. Smith's words are not inherwe will refrain from making a judgment on his underlying
ently hateful
agenda and by printing a legitimate response to our material by Smith we
do not think that we were committing any sort of moral wrong. However,
some members of the campus community believe that his revisionist rhetoric
is simply a facade for a much more malicious purpose, and that by printing
the letter, we were conferring legitimacy upon his stance and furthering his
ill-intentioned agenda. (See letter to the editor.) First of all, The Phoenix
does not endorse any of the ideas expressed in the letters to the editors column. And treating Smith just like any otherrespondent, we were cautious to
not let ourselves become a platform for his agenda. As mentioned in our last
editorial, we never printed any of the propaganda Smith has sent to us over
the course of the semester. After printing his letter, we wrote a letter to Smith
reiterating our policy to not sustain the type of back-and-forth debate that
would render us prone to becoming a propaganda vehicle for special interests and specifically stated that we would not be printing any materials
we received from him from that point onwards. On the
including letters
other hand, we felt confident enough that people would recognize the absurdity of Smith's ideas. As firm believers in the marketplace of ideas, we strongly
believed that whatever "legitimacy" we don'tthink there was any might
have been conferred on him by merely publishing his response to a Phoenix
article would be heavily outweighed by the blatant falseness of his beliefs.
However, having said that, by not adding some sort of commentary to refute Smith's Holocaust-denial beliefs, as suggested, we realize that we were
not as respectful to the sensibilities of the campus community as we could
have been. In weighing our journalisticresponsibilities against our responsibilities to the campus community, we leaned too much in favor of the former
and consequently overlooked the scathing impact of Smith's mere presence
on certain members of the community. For that, we offer our sincerest apologies.

Another notable characteristic of the debate was the outstanding diversity
of opinions present on campus. Both Jewish and non-Jewish students supported and questioned both our decision to print the letter and our handling
of it. A majority opinion did not exist. Thus we strongly feel that it is highly
improper for anyone especially elected student council representatives
to claim that (s)he can speak on behalf of the entire campus community on
this issue.
In addition, we would also like to comment on the strong reaction to the
editorial cartoon published last week:
Editorial cartoons are not meant to represent the truth
their main purpose is to satirize or cast a comical light on current events, which is exactly
what the cartoon in question accomplishes. It poked fun at Mr. Plost's proactive efforts to get his opinions on our decision to publish a letter from
Bradley Smith heard. Another common criticism is that we failed to provide
a context for the cartoon. Editorial cartoons do not assume perfect information, which is why one is very likely to stumble upon a completely incomprehensible cartoon in Newsweek or Time. In order to qualify as appropriate
material for a cartoon, the subject simply must have already become public
knowledge. In this case, both through word of mouth, and as a result of the
news story published by The Daily Gazette
which has a readership exceeding 1000 Mr. Plost's "heated exchange" with our Co-Editor-in-Chief
Patrick Runkle was made known to a substantial portion of the campus community, enough so that it would qualify as, indeed, public knowledge. We
stand by our cartoonist and our decision to print the cartoon.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Criticism of The Phoenix Questionable
Plost Cartoon
To the Editor:
Robert Weinberg, writing on behalfof the
History Department (letter, Feb. 27), is correct to point out that the First Amendment
does not require the Phoenix to publish letters written by Holocaust deniers, but he
demonstrates a disturbing lack of respect
for the spirit of free speech. In his letter,
he effectively skewers Holocaust denial on
its merits, yet goes on to suggest that the
Phoenix never publish letters written by Holocaust deniers.
Weinberg says that publishing such letters "does not contribute to the intellectual
life of the college." On the contrary: after
reading Bradley Smith's pamphlet, his letter, and Weinberg's responding historiographical mini-lecture, I now have a much
better understanding of the importance of
priority-setting in the discipline of history
than I would have ifWeinberg had censored
the Phoenix for me.
He also chastises the Phoenix for "inadvertently help[ing to] propagate the views
of Holocaust deniers" by providing "a forum for them."
Weinberg forgets that the letters published by the Phoenix did not actually argue Holocaust nonexistence, but criticized
the president and a Phoenix reporter for
substituting haughty, unsubstantiated exhortations against "hate speech" for atten-

tive, reasoned responses to the words of the
pamphlet. It seems thatWeinberg wants not
only to keep bad historical ideas out of the
Phoenix, but to silence all people he suspects of denying the Holocaust, no matter
what they are saying.
Does the history department have so little
trust in the ability of Swarthmore students
to weigh historical evidence for themselves
that it must prevent the discussion ofthe idea
of discussing the existence of the Holocaust?
The First Amendment is more than just a
federal regulation that happens not to apply
to private colleges; it is a philosophy of inclusive tolerance, a way of approaching the
world ofideas that is intrinsic to the liberal
arts. As Judge Learned Hand wrote, it "presupposes that right conclusions are more
likely to be gathered out of a multitude of
tongues, than through any kind ofauthoritative selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon
it our all."
Swarthmore students are mature enough
to seek truth using reason within an intellectual marketplace based on the principles
of the First Amendment. I am glad that professors contribute their expertise to discussions of ideas, but I think their propositions
for censorship are out of place and condescending to students.
-Jonathan Pyle '99

Phoenix Misrepresented Holocaust Debate
To the Editor:
We are writing to you to express our
concerns about theeditorial decisions The
Phoenix has made relating to issues of
Holocaust denial over the past few weeks.
While we are pleased to learn that in the
past The Phoenix has chosen not to print
advertisements and other materials from
Bradley Smith, Holocaust denier, we are
disturbed by the manner in which this
material was recently given a voice in The
Phoenix and the resulting effects on the
college community.
We feel that The Phoenix misrepresented the issues at hand as ones of free
speech and open debate, obscuring the
seriousness ofHolocaust denial and further serving the purpose of the growing
national Holocaust denial movement.
Groups like Smith's CODOH propagate
their anti-Semitic agenda by gaining free
publicity in college newspapers such as
ours. They gain entrance to such papers
by manufacturing precisely these debates
on censorship and free speech. Therefore, we must take exception to the Editors' implication that Smith's primary
purpose in his letter was to redress journalistic wrongs in an article published
about him in the previous week's issue.
As evidenced by many similar situations
in college newspapers across the country, the primary purpose ofHolocaust deniers in getting a letter published in a
campus paper is simply to further their
hateful cause.
As the campus newspaper, The Phoenix has the responsibility of appropriately
framing debates relevant to the college
community while maintaining journalistic integrity. We feel that there are several things which The Phoenix should
have done differently in each of the last
three consecutive issues of the paper to
better serve our community. In the February 13 edition of the paper, when The
Phoenix originally reported on the distribution of CODOH pamphlets on campus, the article inaccurately implied that
these pamphlets constituted hate speech,
clouding the issues at hand. In the February 20 edition, The Phoenix printed two
separate letters to the editor from people
sympathetic to CODOH's cause, without

acknowledging the hurtful nature of these letters, and the gravity of its decision to print
them. Given the source of one of these letters, and the views expressed in both, we feel
that The Phoenix should have paid greater
attention to these issues, since it chose to print
them. Such attention could easily have taken
the form of an Editorial Note accompanying
the letters, acknowledging that these letters
might prove hurtful to some members of the
community, and explaining the rationale behind publishing them. Given its role in this
community, it was irresponsible ofThe Phoenix to allow itself to be used as a forum for
CODOH, without some attempt to explain
the context of these letters.
We are grateful that the editors gave us an
indication of the thoughts behind these decisions in last weeks editorial, but we do not
believe that this editorial addressed the real
issues involved, as summarized above. Furthermore, we were dismayed that immediately adjacent to this editorial was a cartoon
whichpersonally attacked a student for bringing some of these very issues to your attention. We appreciate that you have apologized
to those hurt by the letters in last weeks editorial, but we feel that The Phoenix has not
yet acknowledged its errors. We would
greatly appreciate some indication that the
paper has learned from the events of the past
few weeks, and would not make such errors
again in the future.
All of us should learn from the events of
these past few weeks the importance of
greater communication among individuals
and organizations on this campus.

To the Editor:
We are hurt by the cartoon conveying, "Censored by Ari Plost" in the last issue of the Phoenix. Rather than representing Ari's argument in
a productive academic debate, the Phoenix editors instead chose to publish a personal and
malicious attack on Ari. We also feel it is inappropriate for a student newspaper to engage in
attacks on private/unelected individual students.
We request an apology for the Phoenix's personal attack. Such an apology, because of the
magnitude of the cartoon, should be placed in
the newspaper as well as in an all campus email.
Ari never advocated censorship. Instead, Ari
believed that the letter by Bradley Smith should
not have been printed because it is offensive
and insensitive. While one may disagree with
Ari on this point, his argument never fell under
the category of censorship.
By depicting Ari's position as censorship, you
have not only misrepresented him, but created
an atmosphere of misunderstanding on campus.

Phoenix Not at Fault
With Cartoon, Letters
To the Editor:
The Swarthmore community has made quite a rush to
judgment against The Phoenix in the debate over the
Bradley Smith pamphlets. In attacking the editors, crit,o-.
ics threaten to strangle debate on campus.
First, people disputing the decision to print Wilson
Kello's cartoon satirizing Ari Plost seem to have forgotten that public figures are fair game tor satire, even if
the editors are battling that figure. The New York Times
continued to satirize Bob Dole while he repeatedly "attacked it for liberal bias against him during the 1996
campaign. Whether or not Plost actually advocated censorship is irrelevant to the decision to print the cartoon
(penned by Kello, not the editors), as is the editorial on
the issue which was printed adjacent to it. Satire is fuadamentally political speech, and Kello's cartoon is no
different. I believe that Plost is a public figure as the
President of the Swarthmore Zionist Organization, especially when he publicly commented on the controversy in a Daily Gazette story.
I understand that students don't want to be singled
out at such a small college, especially when public debates already become personalized so quickly here.
However, we as students still choose to make ourselves
public figures when we run organizations or comment
publicly on issues. As a result, we are subject to public
criticism. As the co-host of a WSRN talk show, Editorin-Chief of The L-Word, and Co-President of College
Democrats, I consider myself a public figure and subject to that same criticism. We couldn't have healthy
debate without it.
Additionally, people continue to argue that The Phoenix should not have printed Smith's letter two weeks
ago because doing so furthered his ends. If the letter
was printed, they believe that it should at least have beep
accompanied by some sort of piece denouncing Smith's
beliefs regarding the Holocaust (which were not really
addressed in his letter). However, the letter itself Simply stated that no one actually dealt with his argument,
which is true, regardless of its actual merits. What 1
wonder is where those advancing such arguments would
draw the line in the future, or where I might be forced to
in The L-Word. Should a letter from Pat Buchanan not
be printed because it will help his ends, or because he
himself is offensive? What about Charles Murray, au
thor of The Bell Curve! I disagree with both of them,
but I still believe that they should be refuted rather than
silenced. Finally, The Phoenix should not be forced to
editorialize against everything it prints that might be
offensive. While journalists should try to be sensitive
to all groups, we should not take that principle too far
and fundamentally weaken public debateat Swarthmore.

watched these proceedings, which many consider vital to establishing Milosevic's reputation, with horror. While theKosovo Albanians
had hardly been treated fairly under Communist Yugoslavia, many realized that
Milosevic's appeal to Serb nationalism would
lead to ethnic conflict.
While the Yugoslav National Army (JNA)
established martial law and committed numerous human rights violations against the

Kosovo Albanians, the world's attention
shifted to other areas of Yugoslavia. As
Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia seceded from
the Yugoslav federation, the JNA became
known as a code name for troops the Belgrade
government provided to Radovan Karazdic's
Serb nationalists. When the West became
fully aware of the horrors in Bosnia, the press
repeatedly lamented the fact that the countries ofNATO had allowed such events to tran-

spire.
History may grimly repeat itself. Kosovo,
the largest non-Serb enclave with the rump
Yugoslavia (excluding Montenegro, which
voted to remain in the Yugoslav confederation) has been in recent days, the scene offurther violence. Although the repression of Albanians in the state has continued, along with
both violent and nonviolent responses, the
Yugoslav government had succeeded in keeping it out of the world news. The recent assassination of a Serb policeman by members
of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) which
led to fighting that killed 20 people over the
past weekend could spark further fighting.
Given the Serb repression of Albanian organizations and denial of the civil rights of
ethnic Albanian residents of Kosovo, it is
highly probable that only a small spark will
be needed to once again plunge Yugoslavia
into turmoil. The popularity of the UCK indicates how ready Albanian nationalists are
to use violence, rather than the nonviolent
methods that have established an underground
government (complete with taxes, schools,
and a university), indicates a readiness to do
battle. On the other side, Milosevic's (now
the president of Yugoslavia) repeated use of
harsh reprisals against UCK actions and ethnic Albanians has culminated in his request
that the rest of the world stay out of and ignore the conflict. In view of recent Yugoslav
history, it would be highly unwise to do
Milosevic's bidding. Histdry has shown that
ignoring ethnic tensions and repression is
highly unwise, particularly in a region such
as Kosovo where the issue is so polarized. All
the signs for another vicious war are present,
including nearby Albania, which could very
well make the conflict international.

A couple of days after I returned home for the holidays this year, I went to my favorite independentlyowned video store, Video Manor, to pick up some exciting titles that can only be found at exciting video
stores, like / Spit On Your Grave in the original, huge
early 80's box. To my shock and utter dismay, Video
Manor was gone.
I stood at the empty storefront looking through the
glass, and I was just staring into blackness. I couldn't
believe it. As I remembered the thousands of videos
and countless memories that originated from that store,
I felt a small part of me die, and I knew it could never
be recaptured.
The only remnant of Video Manor's 15-year existence was a Casablanca-esque note on the door which
read: "We may be gone, but we'll always have the
memories. Thanks for your patronage." I was in a bad
mood for weeks.
I kept going over it in my head: How could this have
happened? Video Manor was easily the best video store
in town. Why did people
stop going? What is it
about Blockbuster that attracts people to rent videos
from a faceless corporate
giant that censors movies?
Video Manor was the
only store in my hometown that had all Faces Of
Death and Faces of Death
rip-offs, a Charles Bronson
section, a Chuck Norris
section, and multiple copies of Puppet Master. Only
after independent video
stores took the chance to
provide customers with
what they actually wanted
to see did Blockbuster start
putting something other
than 50 million copies of
Ace Ventura in its stores.
The people at Video Manor, and at most independent
video stores around the country, were nice and had actually seen some of the movies they rented to people.
They knew the difference between Lionheart and
Dragonheart, and they even knew the difference between the 1987 Lionheart with Gabriel Byrne and the
1991 Lionheart with Van Damme. And besides, Video
Manor was always cheaper than Blockbuster.
The owner of Video Manor told me he just couldn't
compete when the big guys moved into town, and 1
realized then that I was seeing a real effect of the corporate takeover of the American people and the corporate stranglehold on theAmerican way of life. The old
people who showed up at meetings to protest Wal-Mart
always said that we were going to lose something by
letting them in, and I always kind of discounted what
they had to say. Sure, a couple businesses might suffer, but it's all competition, right? Wrong.
The situation I describe above is analogous to Wal-

mart's invasion of small-town America, with one important exception: Video Manor was cheaper than Blockbuster, had a better selection than Blockbuster, and provided better service than Blockbuster. But still people
chose the corporate giant, because the corporate giant
can put commercials on TV, dress up its employees, hawk
microwave popcorn with its name printed on it, and appear like it's cheaper than the little guy.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. What I have
and I hope it will be a wake-up call to the next
seen
is the free choice, selection, and variety of
generation
a specific community destroyed by a faceless giant. Some
movies that they had at Video Manor, like the NC-17rated version of Bad Lieutenant, have been censored by
major video chains, and will not be seen in my hometown again.
American ideals are under siege, and we need to regain the ground that we have lost. We cannot allow ourselves to blindly swallow the party line and march like
automatons into the banal, homogenous future of dehumanizing corporations.

My title is a reference to Holocaust survivor Jean
Amery's essay "On the Necessity and Impossibility
of Being a Jew." In analogizing my situation to his, I
in no way mean to imply that misogyny in America
is comparable to a systematic, genocidal program of
physical extinction; rather, I would regard my imitation of Amery as the sincerest form of flattery.
Amery deals with the problem of living the results
of being identified as Jewish under the Hitler regime
the Nuremburg laws and later deportation to
Auschwitz
despite being a non Jewish Jew, without any connection to cultural Jewishness.
Like many Swarthmore women, I do not particularly identify with many of the customary attributes
of femininity
I wear make-up maybe twice a year,
don't have a presentable pair of nylons, and (immersed in the academic environment ofSwat as I am)
am not really from day to day aware of the implications of my gender. I identify as a feminist without
really being very conscious of being feminine; even
my relationship with my boyfriend revolves so much
around escaping sex role stereotypes that I find myself comfortably believing in my own relative immunity to the consequences of being feminine in a
misogynist culture.
The problem, for Amery, of suffering as a result of
being identified as part of a group with which he
shares no culture or common experience (except suffering) is his belief that if he attempts to dissociate
himselffrom that group then he becomes a partner in
its oppression; on the other hand, he feels it would
be fatuous to identify himself with a group with
which, prior to Hitler, he would have said he had nothing in common with. What content could there possibly be to such an identification?
Here is where the analogy ends; while recent accusations offeminism centering around white, middleclass woman have made unearthing some universal
content for feminism more difficult, I do not believe
it to be impossible. I have become more aware of
one facet of that content in the process of taking
Aikido and Self-Defense in the last couple of years.
I have noticed a re-relating of myself to violence,
even though I have always been an extremely firm
believer in self-defense. Let us take the case of the
attacker behind Wharton last year: prior to taking
Aikido, I would have said that there must be some
way to fight back or avoid getting hurt. Perhaps I
could have thrown my backpack at him. I used to
carry pepper spray as well. After taking a little Aikido,
I think: ah-hah, hit on the head with a bottle, that's a
shomen attack. I can counter that. I must have done
Shomenuchi Ikkyo a hundred times.
There is now a real, practical body of knowledge]
behind my conviction that self-defense is right. IM
not good enough to be confident about using
in a real situation, yet I can already feel the
ness of the change in outlook which really kiH
not justtheoretically believing
that I col

picture I had in my head of me, as a woman, cfl
ing myself came from the stuff we see in the rS
remember the recent James Bond film,
trailer shows him pulling along the female co-star
(an Asian martial arts star who could easily kick the
shit out of him) by the hand as they run away? Even
the women portrayed by the media as successfully
defending themselves aren't shown doing it very competently. And the self-defense techniques for women
which the media promote are stand-there-and-scream
and flail-your-arms-ineffectively.
And we make fun of that, we know that. You are all
nodding your heads. But I know you still don't get it,
because I know that I didn't get it. It takes real, actual experience
a practical body ofknowledge
to counter the onslaught of images in the media. It
takes getting on the mat and learning how to do it
before you really believe in it.
Being a feminist in the sense of undermining gender stereotypes is more difficult than just denouncing the stereotypes we see around us. The only way
we can counter them at the gut level is by combatting them with lived experience. What is true for me
may be true for you: the ability to fight for yourself
may give you a greater belief in your own worth.
Why haven't all women taken a martial arts course?
We all see the statistics. We all know the danger, it
permeates our lives. Why do we let self-defense remain an abstract ideal?
Aikido is offered on this campus as part of the physical education program. You are welcome to join.
Maybe that's a good place to start.

In 1995, the first pictures of the Omarska
concentration camp were shown widely on
television. Not since the last World War, a
half century before, had human brutality presented the world with such naked pictures of
genocide and sadism. The Second World War,
When Omarska had also served as the site for
a notorious death camp (then run by ethnic
Croats rather than Serbs), is an apt comparison, in large part because it fueled the genocidal rivalries that racked the Balkans earlier
in this decade. When Serbs and Croats returned to fighting each other in 1991 after a
half-century hiatus, they described each others as Chetniks and Ustasha, the names of the
Fascist death squads of the two ethnicities that
had participated in the Second World War.
In retrospect, commentators have feasted
upon the slow and inadequate response of
NATO countries to what the journalist Misha
Glenny has termed "the fall of Yugoslavia."
Even before the collapse ofEastern Europe's
last truly multinational state, there was evidence of ethnic tension rising to the surface.
Among these was then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic's revocation of Kosovo's
autonomy, in 1989, before the breakup itself
occurred. Kosovo, an economically impoverished area ninety percent of whose residents
are Albanian, holds special significance to
Serbs.
Exactly six centuries before Milosevic's
declaration, Serbs lost the Battle of Kosovo
on the Field of Blackbirds. The 600th anniversary of the battle also sparked festivities
that saw Serbs and their descendants worldwide return to the battlefield to commemorate it. TheAlbanian majority in the province

Riding With Swarthmore's Finest
Crummy Advice
THE BEAR (as toid to KATIE MENZER)

Dear Bear,
I was standing in checker line at Sharpies
last Thursday during the 12:35 p.m. lunchtime rush, when I heard the words from the
woman in front of me that struck fear and
dread into my heart: "Damn, I can't find my
I.D. card." She was frantically rifling through
her backpack, pulling out handfuls of pens
and toiletpaperand muttering to herself. Suddenly, she was at the front of the line. It came
to a standstill as we all watched her search.
Several minutes past. Finally, the woman
loudly sighed and said, "I just can't find it. I
know my number, though." I groaned. The
poor checker began to rattle offher familiar
refrain, "I'm sorry, but I need to see your card.
You can sign on the book, though. What's
your last name?" The next few minutes were
spent finding the notebook that held the students' sign in sheets, finding a pen with which
the student could sign her name, finding the
student's name in the book, and, finally, signing the her name in the book. By the time I
got into the serving area, the only food left
was one cherry tomato and single bagel that
appeared as if it had been gnawed on by rats.
Who did this student think she was? You
don't go to Sharpies during the busiest time
of the day and make everyone wait as you
search in vain for your card. As I stood behind her, I had to muster every ounce of will
power I had to stop myself from removing
my rain-soaked shoe and flogging her to
death with it. And it was at this moment, as I
stood there contemplating her bloody demise,
that I realized that I am way too stressed. If I
want to kill someone just because they are
making me stand in line a few minutes longer,
I think I might have some "issues" that extend beyond the mere act of queuing. I've
got some significant, impotent rage built up
inside me, and I've got to let it out before it
escapes on its own. Do you, wizened bear,
have any suggestions ofhow I could lose this
loathing feeling?
Sincerely,
Angry But Thin
Dear Angry But Thin,
Well, it sounds like you need to work off a
little pent-up energy there, pooky. May I suggest a naked romp through the Crum at midnight? The fresh air will do you good. You
might get a little chilly though, being naked
and all, so consider covering yourself in

Unfortunately, that takes the L-shaped

the ground level alone, so it's also a bad idea.

hidden exits, the windows are small and penal, and, most importantly, it houses the largest, most pretentious department on campus,
Biology. It also holds both carcinogenic and
biohazardous materials as well as many angry, mutated lab animals. Once you and your
trustworthy, bipolar cronies strap on the explosives you've concocted in organic chemistry, marched into Martin, locked each door
and posted sentinels, and threatened to hold
your own 4th of July celebration inside Martin, the administrators' imaginations will become filled with images of pussy, boil-covered students bleeding from the eyes and running in blind terror from the wrath of giant,
one-clawed crabs with revenge on their
minds.
The campus will be at your mercy. They
will ask you for your list of demands. Now
this is where the fun begins. You don't have
any demands. You're just doing this to blow
off some steam. But they don't know that,
right? Tell them that they have to "guess"
your demands, and each time they guess
wrong, you will kill one ofyour hostage/professors. If they get smart and say they just
won't guess, tell them you'll kill one hostage each hour anyway, so they might as well
start playing. In three or four hours, you'll
feel like a new man, and what's the harm,
after all?

An Up-close and Personal
Encounter with Public Safety

for handcuffs, and therefore, doesn't carry them). The
department forbids officers from carrying a weapon,
which is just fine with Iredale.
"I do not feel we have to be armed in this environment,"
he says, pointing out that other universities, such as U.
Penn, Temple, and Penn State, are. Nor does he see a
need for sprays, such as Mace. Thieves can find easy pickings by walking down halls, and bike theft is always a
problem, he says, but the number of reported complaints
has declined recently, and last semester was "very, very
good, as far as major incidents." He attributes both to the
24-hour locking ofall dormitories' (except for Parrish's)
outside doors.
Nonetheless, should trouble strike, officers have full
authority to make arrests. What's more, he says, "We have
an outstanding relationship with the borough police,"
noting that they will often back up Public Safety for major incidents, such as out-of-control large parties, and are
only a radio or phone call away.
Iredale and McMahon
traverse the front lawn towards the familiar, white,
four-wheel-drive Jeep
Cherokee, the words "Public Safety" emblazoned on
both sides. Equipped with
blue and red emergency
lights, a 4 liter/V6 engine,
and a mobile two-way radio, the Jeep is one of two the college owns. The vehicles
are standard equipment when two officers work one shift,
but if three or four are on duty, one or more may do "foot
patrol" or ride a mountain bike (when nice weather permits).
Making a right out of the parking lot, Iredale heads towards the campus's south entrance, where he will wind
his way up the road leading past the gym. The run serves
a dual purpose, allowing Iredale to both make his checks
and continue to mentor Sgt. McMahon on the ins and
outs of patrolling.
"When training new officers, it's repetition," he explains, "going around until they feel comfortable"
At the outside of the ride, the two make it clear that their
priority while driving is to get to a scene safely. Not only
is an officer's mentality one of caution, but it is departmental policy to avoid pursuit. Should they come upon, or
fall victim to, an accident, the Jeep contains accident rethough reports are
port forms, as do all college vehicles
done on computer, using custom-designed software.
As a matter of course, the vehicle also has a PA capable
of transmitting voice or one of three different sirens,
though Iredale has never in his 22 moths on the job used
the siren, and rarely uses the rooftop lights. "It's there if
you need it," he says of the lights, "depending on the
situation."
The Jeep's mobile radio, used while riding, contains
two channels the main one used by Public Safety, the
shuttles, and maintenance personnel; and a second, private one, used for local communications between officers. The borough police can monitor public safety over
the radio, as can eavesdroppers in the shuttles
a situation deemed less than ideal by Iredale.
The officers' first stop is the heating plant, where Iredale
checks columns and writes numbers on a log sheet, explaining the significance of various gauges above the loud
din that encompasses the room. After the brief stop, they
cross the bridge above the train tracks and make a right, at
which point Iredale points out the Women'sResource Center, Sharpies 111, and two fraternity houses, the last of which
had a couple of fights last year, but none this year.
The drive culminates behind the dining hall, where the
officers park and proceed to head inside. As they walk

across the dock, one young man standing nearby notices
them and asks, "Swarthmore Police?" Without missing a
beat, Iredale responds, "Yes," in a friendly voice. They
continue to make their way into the building, passing several young men and women, some with buckets, other
with hoses and brushes. Nearly all are working diligently,
but most remark they officers as they pass.
Walking through the kitchen, Iredale explains that most
of the cleaning crew hired by the College to service the
dining hall is learning disabled, and is quick to offer his
wholehearted support to the program. "They're really a
good bunch of kids," he comments in an earnest voice,
"and they're able to do some meaningful work."
Soon, the two officers reach a lone office in the back of
the kitchen, where Iredale retrieves the lost purse he was
called for. Finding a name on some credit cards, he calls
in the information, but since the person isn't listed in Public Safety's computer, he leaves with the purse, which

then used to pick up the dishes which have
a stew-like quality to them. Eating food
this way is supposed to be a "delicate art,"
but, oh well. This is a great date place,
too. The quintessence of the bonds are
often demonstrated in the form of gursha
that is, the placing offood in the mouth

The first thing we noted upon entering
the restaurant were the oddly-shaped
tables. They were low to the ground,
round, made of straw and resembled small
coffee tables. After being seated we

complimented the posters and decorations
which might have looked cliche but
worked well with the dim lighting and the
ambiance. We enjoyed our company as
well; we struck up a lengthy conversation
with the other people at the tables near
ours, one of whom was a chef who claimed
that this was one of the most authentic
Ethiopian restaurants in or near Philadelphia.
The restaurant has quite a variety of
dishes to choose from, and unlike the other
places we have visited, vegetarian dishes
are a staple of Ethiopian cuisine. All of
the dishes, which were made from scratch,
are flavored with a range of spiciness from
very hotly spiced with berbere, a typical
Ethiopian red pepper, to mild. While sipping on mango juice, "pretty good for
mangos not being in season" according to
Arati, we initially ordered Yedoro Spinach,
tender chicken cooked with spinach, onion and garlic, and Yebeg Kay Watt, lamb
cooked in berbere sauce. However, we
decided not to overwhelm out taste buds
with the hot sauce and opted instead for

the YebegAlicha which is (somewhat) succulent lamb meat cooked in a mild sauce.
The staff was very accommodating considering we made the change while the
food was being prepared. The chicken and
spinach was a nice mix and though the
spinach itself had a lot of flavor, it did not
transfer to the meat. The lamb was slightly
less tender than the chicken, and also had
the problem of the flavor not being integrated into the meat, this opinion being
held by both Jo and Arati. The vegetarians got a combination of dishes including a mix of spicy lentils, cabbage and
potatoes, and okra flavored with berbere.
Cayley wasn't a huge fan of the meal
altogethr, particularly the lentils, but did
enjoy the okra and the injera upon which
everything was placed. Rachel enjoyed
the whole meal and was quite satisfied at
the end of it.
We all agreed that the style of Ethiopian
dining was quite pleasurable and eating
from the same plate gave us a chance to
sample everyone's food. (Everyone's meal
came on one plate which had a large piece

of injera on the bottom of it.) Using your
hands and the extra pieces of injera on the
side to pick up your food is an interesting
experience, though Jo was not a fan of the
underlying lemony taste in the bread. The
food was slightly healthier and lighter than
meals we have eaten in the past due to the
fact that none of it was fried. Rachel was
the only one of us who was full at the end
of the meal, so we ordered baklava for dessert which was flaky and sweet.
Both Cay ley andArati agreed that they'd
had better Ethiopian food before and
would not necessarily choose this particular restaurant to return to. Rachel, the only
one fully satisfied, did enjoy the restaurant and highly recommends it. Jo sided
with Cayley and Arati noting that if you
eat out you should feel full at the end of a
meal. However, the prices are pretty reasonable, and on Tuesday from 5-7 pm there
is an all-you-can-eat buffet. The restaurant
is open daily from 4-11 pm and has live
music on the weekends. Dahlak is located

On Sunday afternoon, the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology held a screening of Isaac
Magnusson's Power, a documentary which
premiered at the U.S. Sundance Film Festival. The film depicts the struggle of the Cree
tribe of Native Americans against the building of a hydro electric dam on their land. The
fight lasted from 1990 to 1995, and
Magnusson has created a moving document
of the activism, the internal problems, the legal struggles, and political maneuvering that
surrounded it. The film also manages to produce a strong awareness of the influence that

Most disturbingly, Levinson never seems

movie lacks the technical skill and scope

Undermanned Earthworms Win 2 of 3
by McKenzie Funk
Early on Saturday morning, much before the sun lit upon a campusfull of waiting Screw-goers, Swarthmore's Swarming
Earthworms were well on their way to the
first tournament of the spring frisbee season. As the team had been warned of a
possible conflict between this and ScrewYour Roommate activities, many of the
more eligible bachelors opted to stay behind, crimp their hair, and ready themselves for the big dance. Thus it was a
small crew that set out for Lehigh, one
made up of the hard-core, the dedicated,
and the likely dateless. But while they
might not have been able to prove their
worth on the dance floor, they more than
made up for it on the field. Led by captains Roger Bock '99 and Matt Menendez
'99, the Earthworms managed to pull together a fine set of games. Despite poor
fields, a general lack of subs, multiple injuries, and strong opponents, both the A
and the B team finished the day with good
records.
Swarthmore's A team, consisting mostly

of juniors and seniors, did manage to overcome the absence of the hair-crimpers, yet
it continually struggled to make ends meet.
Because it had only 9 players, only two at
a time would have a chance for rest. And
this situation, indeed a recipe for exhaustion, worsened at the very beginning of
the first game as the Earthworms took on
Rutgers. In a heroically futile dive for the
disk, junior Noam Unger managed to entangle himself with an opposing player
and do lasting damage to his leg. With
three games ahead of them, the Earthworms had lost one of their key players.
Unger, who surprisingly did have a date
for that night's formal, summed up his
mixed reaction, "At least now I will have
a good excuse for my poor dancing skills
tonight, but it sure is hard not to be able to
play with the team." But those of us who
know him well realized that there is no
excuse whatsoever for his dancing and that
his injury was a great loss for the team.
Nevertheless, the Earthworms moved on.
With but one substitute and many points
ahead of them, they battled against Rutgers.
This match proved to be the most grip-

ping of the day. The teams traded points
all the way to the end, with almost every
Swarthmore point answered by Rutgers.
All were worn down by the tough play to
such an extent that time-outs and water
breaks seemed longer than the points
themselves. In the end, though, the Earthworms exposed their secret weapon, Sasha
"Jailbait" Clayton, whose superb handling
skills inspired them to lock up the game.
Clayton's hot play led them away from
their tie at 12 to an overtime win of 14 to
13. They had little time to savour their
victory, however, for the next game against
Bucknell followed soon. Though the
Earthworms showed some signs of fatigue, this game proved to be an even
greater victory. After a quite equal first
half, they came to dominate the field.
Their stamina and experience, exemplified
in senior Carl Mas' sterling offense and
exciting defense, broke past Bucknell for
a runaway second half. The final score
was 13 to 6, a technical shutout by Swarthmore. The last match of the day, this
one against the University of Massachusetts, was unfortunately the most disap-

pointing. The surprising strength which
had kept with the Earthworms despite the
team's small size finally dissipated in the
face of a team twice their size. For much
of the game there were no subs at all and
the tired team was slapped with a 4 to 13
loss. However, considering their overall
2 and 1 record and their small size, the
Earthworms went home satisfied.
On the B side the players were equally
pleased. Though plagued by similar problems of low numbers and fatigue, they
were graced with the leadership ofVinnie
"Eye of the Tiger" Pallaver. He kept their
spirits up at every step and was integral in
keeping their two losses close and their
one victory resounding. All this effort,
unfortunately, wore him out and made him
quite useless once he was called up to the
A team, but he still served as a symbol of
sacrifice for the team. And perhaps he
was rewarded for his sacrifice, for he was
reportedly later seen having a fine time at
Screw Your Roommate. If I'm not mistaken, both he and Noam were indeed
shaking their thangs as well as any hair
crimper.

Women Win
Track Finals
Men Place Fourth

by Pat Donaghy

by Jill Belding and Tony Sturm
Last weekend Swarthmore's women
dominated the Centennial Conference
Indoor Track Championship finishing
30 points ahead of the runner up,
Haverford, with 123 points. With one
of the smaller teams present, the Garnet proved that quality is more desirable
than quantity.
Senior Danielle Duffy was voted outstanding female performer of the meet
once again, repeating the honor she received last season. Duffy won the 200
and 400 meter dash, and participated in
the winning 1600 meter and 800 meter
relays.
Catherine Laine '9B left Dickinson
College with seven medals weighing her
down, gaining the team high total of 53
points. Laine got silver to teammate
sophomores Desiree Peterkin 'OO in the
triple jump, with a NCAA provisional
qualifying mark. She also placed second in the 55 meter hurdles, the 200
meter dash and the 55 meter dash. In
addition, Laine took bronze in the long
jump. Laine gathered two gold medals
in the 800 and 1600 meter relays. With
Laine, Duffy, Peterkin and Wanda Joseph, the Garnet took first in 800 meter
relay. Duffy, Laine, Peterkin and
Stephanie Herring '99 ran to first in the
1600 meter relay.
The women won major points in the
field events. Peterkin excelled in the
triple jump, placing first, reaching the
automatic qualifying mark and matching Laine's school, conference and
championship records from the previous year. Peterkin will travel to
Waltham, MA for Nationals over spring
break. Herring placed fifth in the high
jump.
In the distance events, Joko Agunloye
'Ol finished third in the 5000 meter run
while Danielle Wall '9B ran to sixth in
the 1500 meter run. Agunloye, Sarah
Jay 'Ol, Jessica George 'OO and Shalini
Ayyagari 'OO teamed up to place third
in the 3200 meter relay. Also claiming
bronze was the distance medley relay
consisting of Wall, Herring, Jay and
Ayyagari.

Last Saturday, the Swarthmore Women's
Rugby team took to the field for the first time
this season and emerged victorious, leaving
Lehigh's squad begging for more. In the first
game, Swarthmore "ripped it up" winning by
a score of 29-0. While the second team lost
with a final score of 7-5 the two point margin reflects the determination with which
Swarthmore played.
As usual, it was raining- tries that is! And as
usual, Forward Captain Becky Snyder '9B ravaged the opposition scoring three of
Swarthmore's five tries. The highlight of her
scoring blizzard was the try she scored off a penalty play; before either team knew what was
happening Snyder snatched the ball from ref/
coach Alan Matas and flung herselfinto the tryzone for five points. Sarah Cross '99 contributed to Swat's lead, by deftly manuvering her
body, and thus the ball, around a herd ofLehigh
forwards in order to score a try. Scrum Half
Megan Brennan 'OO capitalized on a "stoopit"
mistake by Lehigh and touched the ball down
in the try-zone. Kicking extrordinare Beth Wiles
'9B cemented Swarthmore's win with 4 points
in conversion kicks.
Whilq Swarthmore had had little opportunity to practice their tackling before Saturday,
there was no dearth ofhard hitting on the field.
For example, Lynn "the nine fingered wonder" Mathews '9B took revenge for her shortened season last semester by pulverizing a
Lehigh back into the ground. Leora CohenMcKeon '9B refreshed after a briefhiatus from
the sport, returned to Dupont field strutting her
stuff and her senior attitude; she and fellow
forward Cori Garrett-Goodyear '99 both returned from semesters abroad in Africa and
showed Lehigh who's boss.
The second game was a field day ofrookie
highlights. The Carribean Connection, consisting of Cristina Costas-Russell '99 and
Danielle D'Olivera 'OO returned to the sport
after recruiting internationally for the team
(yeah, we mean Alejandra and Maz).
D'Olivera showed her stuff in the first quater
when she sprinted faster than Jackie JoynerKersey to prevent a Lehigh try. Starr "you
know who she is" Glidden'9B managed to hurt
her knee in the first five minutes of play, but
never fear she'll be back. We'd also like to
acknowledge rookie wonders: Kara and Anne:
these two players are the lucky recipients of
the Halsey-Thomas "you rock" award.
The women ruggers will return to the field
March 21, to take on U. Penn. at 11:00.

Desirce Peterkin 'OO takes Swat to victory. The Swardimore \Cbmens Indoor Track
Team placed first at the Centennial Conference, beating Haverford by 30 points.
The men's team finished fourth with
63.5 points. Haverford again dominated
the meet, scoring almost twice as many
points as any other team. Haverford distance runner lan Frasier was named
outstanding performer of the meet, despite the fact that he graduated two
years ago. The 24-year-old re-enrolled
this year and is using his last year of
eligibility.
Sophomore Steve Dawson's performance in the jumps was the highlight
of meet. Amid cheering from the team
as well as meet directors over the PA
system, Dawson cleared a career best
6' 9" in the high jump and won the
event by over six inches, made an
NCAA provisional qualifying mark,
and broke the conference and championship meet records. Earlier, Dawson
proved that he has not only a huge vertical leap, but can clear distances on the
ground as well. Dawson won the long
jump and placed second in the triple
jump.
Almicar Priestley 'OO surprised ev-

erybody, claiming bronze in the long
jump and clearing 20 feet for the first
time in his career, and setting a personal
record by over a foot. Junior Mason
Tootell grabbed silver in the 55 meter
hurdles. Tootell also finished fourth in
the long jump. Daveßruemmer '9B ran
to sixth place in the 400 meter dash.
The men's relays fared relatively well.
Tootell, Keith Gilmore 'Ol, Tony Sturm
'99 and Julian Haffner '9B placed fifth
in the 800 meters while Tootell,
Gilmore, Sturm and Bruemmer claimed
bronze in the 1600 meter event.
The 1600 relay was edged out by
Dickinson in the final stretch, finishing
behind both the relay and the entire
team in the meet. The 3200 meter relay of Gordon Roble '99, Nevin Katz
'99, Lorrin Nelson 'OO and Graham
Lucks '9B finished fourth. Roble,
Bruemmer, Lucks and Mark Jeuland 'Ol
also placed fourth. Franklin and
Marshall, behind some impressive
sprinters and distance runners, took second in the meet.

The men's lacrosse team looks to rebound from last year's 0-13 disappointing season. The Garnet will lose only
three players, while 13 new players take
their place. Swarthmore is a very young
team, but with almost the entire defense
intact and an exciting mix of players at
attack, the Garnet hope to stand victorious this year.
The defense is lead by Tucker Zengerle
'OO, a second team all conference player
last year, which is quite an accomplishment considering that the Centennial
boasts four teams in the top 20 in the
country. Sig Rydquist 'OO gets the nod at
goalie after significant playing time last
year. Senior captains Alex DeShields and
Aaron Hultgren are solid players that can
throw a takeaway check on defense and
lead fast breaks. Charles Fischette 'Ol
and Ford O'Connell 'OO will share the last
defensive spot.
On offense, a pair of high school AllAmericans lead the way. Freshmen Mark
Dingfield and Mike Lloyd are threats to
score anytime they touch the ball. Fellow
attackman Steve Shin '9B is a good finisher. The midfielders boast six or seven
players that can score. A trio of sophomores make up the first middie unitMarcus Shin, Toby Patterson, and Adam
Dickinson. All three started last year and
combined for one-third of Swat's scoring
last season. Senior midfielders Matt
Halpern, Tony Buendia, Chris Rockmore,
Pete Karacki, and Erik Johnson are
counted on to provide leadership and can

all score and play solid defense.
The Tide traveled to Villa Julie Saturday for
their opening game of the season. After spotting the opponents with a goal, Dingfield
started the scoring for Swarthmore with two
goals in the next threeminutes. Villa Julie then
took a 4-2 lead, but Aaron Hultgren threw a
check and lead a fast break that finished with a
Mike Lloyd goal. However, the offense then
stalled as it forced the ball and turned the ball
over too frequently. "We made so many mistakes on offense and it cost us," said Pete
Karacki. "We're a young team, and that's to be
expected."
Following a halftime 5-3 halftime deficit, the
men's lacrosse team turned into the Garnet of
last year and struggled in the third quarter. Villa
Julie dominated the quarter and scored seven
unanswered goals to break the game open at
12-3. Swarthmore never gave up, however, and
scored four of the next five goals of the game
to cut thelead to 13-8,but there was not enough
time for a comeback, and the Tide fell by a
final score of 15-8. "Our defense just got too
tired by the end of the game. It was disappointing to allow 15 goals. Most of the goals
were in transition and off the faceoff, and that
is justsomething we have to get better at," said
Hultgren afterwards. Conversely, Swat's offense was able to capitalize on fast breaks
throughout the game, something that was nonexistant a yearago. Dingfield finished with four
goals and an assist in his debut, while classmate Lloyd finished with one goal and an assist. Marcus Shin and Toby Patterson also had
goals, while Steve Shin and Tucker Zengerle
finished with assists. The team will travel to
Virginia for Spring break, playing RandolphMacon and Shenendoah during their stay.
